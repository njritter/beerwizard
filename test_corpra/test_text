Not having tried the elusive first batch, I can't comment on whether the second batch is actually inferior compared to the original. Given the way it tastes, however, I'm willing to bet that the second batch isn't so much the shadow of its predecessor that people claim it to be, but its perceived mediocrity is a result of the evolution of the craft beer market and the trends that have changed since the original "DB Huna" graced this earth almost three years ago and shocked all those that were lucky enough to try it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Perhaps I'm becoming further and further estranged from my adopted American roots, but since trying the original Hunahpu on the Mexican Stout special and drinking the Double Barrel, I've come to wonder how a beer with such flagrant flavors and characteristics has achieved what seems to be universal acclaim among its drinkers. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Whereas the mix of cinnamon, spicy vanilla, and dry chili spices seem to elicit an aroma familiarly recognizable as "oriental medicine" or "chinese liquorice," these flavors--correct me if I'm wrong--aren't a mix frequently found together in North American cuisine, yet oddly it seems that most that try it seem to be able to appreciate or even confess to liking it.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Maybe it's the #whalezbro effect, or maybe it's because all those unique flavors have been expertly melded into a thick 11% ABV sludge, but there are bound to be those that find this brew repulsive due to a personal aversion of one of its many pungent and exotic flavors; case in point, almost nobody who claims that this brew smells or tastes like oriental medicine profess to be particularly fond of oriental medicine, yet everyone seems to agree that this is a phenomenal brew. 
Occam's razor would probably dictate that the superior flavor integrity of the base beer, removed from all the added adjuncts, is the reason for this possible anomaly; or perhaps that the combination of the said adjuncts with the base is what makes the otherwise repugnant flavors desirable. Yet when people tend to point out what is or has been most memorable about beers like these, the credit almost always seems to be given to the adjuncts rather than the base. God I'd make a shitty philosopher.
A familiar confetti of "chaotic" aromas comprised of dark chocolate, cinnamon, chinese licorice, dried chili, and spicy vanilla flood the olfactory receptors, this time accompanied by a generally sweet, light werther's-like notes of rum, and a minutia of woody/musky apple toward the back.
The flavor on the palate is where the brew really starts to distinguish itself from the non-barrel variant. The same decadent flavors that captivated imaginations with the original Hunahpu's is clearly established in the brew, but whereas they were somewhat lacking a big overall picture in the non-barrel, this time they're all blended into sweet harmony by a smooth and delectably sweet rum flavor. The Mayan gods work in mysterious ways on the back and of the brew as a bitterness which resembles dark-roasted coffee start to form the final impression on the tongue, but is ever so slightly mellowed out by a subtle toffee apple-like flavor, accompanied by something that reminds me of the slow burn you get when sipping on brandy.
The body feels a little thicker than the regular, but the brew sports the same thick creamy mouthfeel with the gentle, simmering carbonation. There is a very negligible amount of heat toward the back, but this tastes so rich that you're hardly likely to notice it. 3,561 charactersamano_h, Monday at 06:16 PM

4.53/5  rDev -3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From bottle into Huna chalice.
Appearance was extremely dark with no foam head except for ring around edge of glass.  Initially, smell was of brandy, some rum, along with chocolate and light cinnamon.  Initial taste while cold was primarily brandy.  Chcocolate and cocoa was most pronounced, with very little cinnamon.  As it warmed, the chocolate stayed but rum barrel note really came out in a big way.  This beer had tons of barrel character.  Mouthfeel was medium for a BA stout.
Overall, a high end beer with tons of barrel character that changes the taste as it warmed.  I am typically not a fan of regular Huna but this beer was tranformed by the barrel ageing into an exceptional brew. 695 characterseifster82, Jun 18, 2017
4.94/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review is of b1
Look: Almost a jet black, and pours thick as oil.  Hugs the side of the glass.  Has the thickest appearance of any beer I have had
Nose:  Some heat with a sweet backbone.  A slight smell of peppers with cinnamon more pronounced
Taste:  So many waves of flavor.  The apple brandy and rum work in perfect harmony.  Almost no burn from the peppers is left.  What is there is more the ancho than the pasilla.  Super chocolatey and decadent.  
F: Probably the thickest beer that I have had, even after a few years.  
O:  I'm not a huge fan of Huna, but this takes the beer to a whole new level.  Easily one of the best beers I have ever had as everything seems to work together in perfect harmony.  I never got to try this beer fresh, but it is holding up incredibly well. Although, I'm not sure it will improve much past where it is now. 849 charactersRNbeerfan, Jun 14, 2017

A weird bell pepper almost pickle like flavor ruins this for me. The cinnamon and vanilla are muted compared to batch 1. There is definitely some nice barrel character and the full bodied base beer shows, but they are overpowered unfortunately. 357 charactersDanny1217, May 26, 2017
