Oude Schaarbeekse Kriek nor as tart as LPF (different fruit but naturally draws the comparison), this beer provides a wonderful balance between funk and fruit. A real treat that I hope to drink again sometime in the not-so-distant future. 362 charactersTychoNDC, Sep 26, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Was surprised to be able to find a 2012 750ml that could be consumed on site at Hill Farmstead.  Beer is a murky ruby red in glass with pick 2 finger head.  Aroma is a blend of sweet fruits and earthy funkiness that blends really nicely together.  Taste is amazing.  A perfectly blended mix of all the good things I like in a Belgian Lambic/sour and done better than most any I've had to date.  It's only slightly sour, mixed with tartness and sweetness from the fruit, but finishes so clean.  No syrupy sweetness on the back of the tongue like you get from some other fruit beers.  It was quite the highlight of my Vermont trip to finally get to sample something from Cantillon and if I can't have it at the source in Belgium, then sitting at Hill Farmstead on a 75 degree sunny fall day sure isn't too shabby a venue either. 826 charactersbubseymour, Sep 21, 2016

Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy dark ruby red with a three finger dark pink head and sparse lacing.
Aroma: Marzipan, cherry and almonds dominate with hints of biscuit. Only some light sour tartness.
Taste: Cherry and almond dessert cake. Very nice. Light sour, tartness, oak and a touch of sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: Another stunning Lou Pepe variety with great balance. Easy to drink and refreshing. I tried Framboise on the same day and not to take anything away from the Kriek as it is still really really good, but the Framboise was near perfect. 731 characterskitch, Aug 21, 2016

L: Red wine lipstick crimson on the body with heated Jell-O colored foam on the pour. 
S: Predominantly red wine and oak, with bits of earthy funk and muted fruit lingering on the nose. As the beer warms, the aromas open up, highlighting a wonderful blend of vinous cherry notes that take over the olfactory senses. 
T: Very tart up front, showcasing Cantillon's signature lambic, then mellowing after the first wave as the sour cherries begin to pop; acidic fruit flavor then takes over, resonating throughout the palate, leaving hints of oak and mild tannins that finish with a taste of sweet cherries. 
F: The mouthfeel is light and clean with a dry finish. Well carbonated. 
O: This is one of the finest beers I have ever had. It showcases the best of what a fruited Belgian lambic can offer to the senses. For me, it is the near perfect balance of sour, funk, fruit, and meticulous barrel aging, all coming to together to create a masterful beer. 1,027 charactersrodmanfor3, Jun 03, 2016

Pours a vibrant ember to lilac color with a fizzy, bubbly head, leaving back a thick film of lacing at the rim of the glass.
Dusty, leather accompanied, funky cherry from the very first smell. Produces a ripe, dark sour cherry impression, while ensuring an intriguing complexity, due to wood bark, dried oak and heated cherry pit among a fermented tartness.
Drinks soft and perfectly balanced, while adding a subtle dryness to the uprising, associated tartness during the finish, exhibiting the beers flavor richness perfectly well.
Amarena sweet cherries among a pleasant, earth coated funkiness, showcasing the fruits ripeness with a sugary peak to them. The beer produces a prominent stone quality among a dusty, pleasantly pungent funkiness. Utmost fruity in the finish, featuring almost overripe, juicy cherries in all its facetts and layers.
A different beast than their regular Kriek, way more complex and fruitier. The sherries establish a fantastic characteristic between lusciously ripe, and already fermented fruits, tied together by a crisp, citraic sour punch. 1,099 charactersaleigator, May 08, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 vintage. 75cl bottle at In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst. 
Cherry pie is the immediate impression I'm getting straight from the get-go. Lots of tart, fleshy fruit skins, funky spicy oak, and a bit of vinegar on the back end. 
Sour cherries hit you hard with the first sip, followed by some lemon-y zest, and an almost a Sauvignon Blanc like dryness. Tartness and barnyard hay remain as the cherries subside, but it's a very moderate amount of both; not a butthole-puckering level of sour, and whereas there's a good amount of cheese and vanilla present, it certainly isn't as funky as some of Cantillon's other offerings. Again, superb balance is Cantillon's game, and Cantillon does it better than anyone else.
Very mild carbonation, and light-bodied; for some reason I always think Krieks should be a little sticky, but this one doesn't leave any unpleasantries behind.
This is certainly better than Cantillon's 100% Kriek Bio, but surprisingly didn't run circles around it quite the same way I expected it to. Nevertheless, there probably isn't too much room for improvement to be found in this amazing classic. 1,129 charactersamano_h, Feb 19, 2016
5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Flawless beer. I was fortunate enough to venture into a new place in DC called The Sovereign and grabbed the last Lou Pepe. It was a 2012 and so worth the pricetag. It has a beautiful red pour and tastes like cherries. 
I've only started getting into this style within the last six months, so have less ability to compare than others. That said, I can't see a beer that is much better than this. 396 charactersjrubenst12, Feb 18, 2016

They must have liked us, because they gave us a pitcher on the house of this while there were bottling it in the other room. Since it was not bottled yet, the beer had no carbonation.

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 label. Best kriek I've ever had and one of the best beers I've ever had, especially in the acidic category (up there with 2011 Framboos and VSB for me). 
Deep red and cloudy with a nice pinkish white head. Nice retention.
Nose is straight jammy, cinnamon pie filling cherries with that Cantillon funk (which I think works the best with their fruited lambics). 
Taste follows the nose completely.
Perfect acidity, carb and mouthfeel. Light and effervescent but with a fullness to it.
One of the best and my favorite Cantillon to date (right ahead of 2014 Fou). 569 characterscultclassic89, Nov 05, 2015

Pours deep ruby red with almost no head.  Funky on the nose with the fruit more subdued and muted.  Some sweetness and cherry to cut the funk, but age has turned this into a deeply sour beer.
I would love to get a hold of a fresh bottle one day - a delicious beer, but the fruit when fresh must be amazing 327 characterspagriley, Oct 24, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Cantillon stemmed taster glass. 2012 label, 2014 cork. Acquired in a trade.
Pours a deep cherry, maroon body with a quickly rising pink head that reduces at a moderate rate, leaving a thick ring of retention that sticks around for a while. Slightly fizzy. 
On the nose is straight cherry pie, berries and tart fruit skins, slight funky mustiness, vinegar, and oak barrel. 
Upon sipping I get notes of super tart, nearly sour cherries, light berry, dry white wine, lemon zest, light vinegar, lacto funk, light muted hops, ends with a tongue-drying tartness and citrus. Medium-high carbonation, very easy to drink, light body but packed full of flavors. Very nice.
Overall Lou Pepe Kriek was fantastic. A good amount of sour, nice amount of cherry without being over-fruited, and very smooth and drinkable. Worth seeking out! 861 charactersgcamparone, Jul 25, 2015

The beer pours a lovely, ruby red color, opaque and cloudy, cherry and raspberry hues with a pink/off-white head, moderate retention and little lace. The aroma is lovely, cherry pie instantly comes to mind or perhaps cherry cheesecake from the funkiness. Big fresh cherry aromas, tart and fleshy, musty funk, spice, woody oak, mild vinegar coming from the lambic base and some pale grain gives the pie crust some life. The flavors echo the nose really well, loads of tart and sour cherries, the two year old lambic still has a shell of itself, not completely drowned out by fruit, funky, light vinegar, aged hops, oaky must, pale grain, lemon citrus that has a light zing, but really binds this beer together. The mouthfeel is great, coating, zippy, creamy at times, high carbonation but very gentle, tart bite at the finish.
Verdict: A great fruited lambic from Cantillon, something that is quite easy to say. The cherry aspect here is fantastic and really does evoke a pie or a cheesecake with the supporting flavors. While cherry is the star, the base lambic and oak aging really help to balance this beer and make it truly world class. 1,274 characterskevanb, Jul 07, 2015

750ml bottled 9/5/2015. Poured into a Cantillon stemmed glass
Appearance: Pours a dark ruby red color with a finger of a pink head that dissipates almost instantly. No retention or lacing. Body is dark, but only lightly hazy when held to light, with mild visible carbonation. 
Smell: Cherry skins, juice and cherry pit. Very oaky with notes of hearty red wine, musty basement and hay. 
Taste: Lots of whole sour cherry character. Like the aroma, it's not just cherry juice, but the entire cherry that comes through. There's also a good amount of barnyard funk (more than in the nose), hay, mild cheesiness and hints of vanilla and green apple. Sourness is medium.
Mouthfeel: Light-ish bodied a somewhat soft feel and mild carbonation. Dry finish.
Overall: Another great beer from Cantillon, and while I prefer this to the regular kriek, I'm not sure the gap is as wide as I was expecting. Still well worth seeking out though. 945 charactersJonada, Apr 24, 2015

Pours a brilliant deep clear red, with a spotty small head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells quite sour and pretty funky, tons of lactic acid, some lemon, and a plethora of fresh sour cherries that are still bright and vibrant all these years later. I get cherry skins, and a good amount of oak. This one's pretty sour at this age, but it's not bracingly so, making it really drinkable. The sourness does not linger long with each sip.
There's a light body on this one, with a crisp and juicy mouthfeel- it goes down so easily. There's a higher level of carbnation.
This is a classic and one of the best lambics there is. So good. 764 charactersGreesyFizeek, Feb 15, 2015

A bit of dirty socks on the aroma, and the sour fruit will make you pucker.  And then somehow it will make you want to take another sip.
I think the brewers at Cantillon wish that people preferred the 100% lambics over the "Lou Pepe" versions, but my taste buds agree with most people. 347 characterscfalls, Jan 20, 2015

This is a very good, very enjoyable beer with the right amount of cherries to be tasty without overpowering.  Difficult to tackle on your own despite the low ABV, but a great beer to share. 215 charactersmrn1ceguy, Sep 27, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%Great beer, lots of cherry.
This is a classic lambic kriek. It pours a red beer. Smells of funky yeasts, and cherry candy. Taste is sour, yet it is also sweet. I could not help thinking of a cherry soda, since this beer has that type of feel. Not much foam forms at the head. This beer is pretty light, and I wouldn't say you can drink the whole bottle, but at least half easily. 381 charactersJulioH, Sep 12, 2014

The flavor follows with cherry candy, cherry jam, a stone like minerality throughout the mid palate onto the finish. Tart qualities are balanced by this minerality, along with hay like funk interweaving the experience. 297 charactersdar482, Sep 02, 2014

Appearance is a gorgeous, deep cherry red bordering on marroon. Or maybe it's past red and in purple/marroon territory. I mean it's deep. Lovely two finger pink head builds and holds well before settling to a nice froth layer. One of those beautiful beers to look at. 
The aroma is also about as perfect as can be for a Kriek/Cherry sour. Tons of earthy cherry juice, pit, skin. A host of funky notes with horse blanket and damp earth predominating. I love krieks that show some funk through all the fruit. But you also have some oak, vanilla, and burgundy wine complimenting the cherry and funk. 
The taste is, well phenomenal. I think I popped this baby right on time. The finest tasting LPK I've had to date. Like the aroma, this is so freakin balanced between Cherry, barrel, and funk. And the acidity has not even begun to accelerate so it's maintained that high drinkability of fresh LPK. Everything cherry is in this, juice, earthy pit, tart skin, and a touch of Cherry jam. The funk is cleaner on the palate than on the nose but offers up musky cave and a little minty leafiness. Oak is soft and red wine is fruity with medium tannic level. Acidity is low still and that's how I personally like it. 
Mouthfeel is light, fluffy, and almost silky. I love the fact this doesn't sport a high carbonation level as it sometimes spoils the lambic experience. Despite the sweet cherry flavor characteristics this is invitingly dry and tart from front of the tongue to back. 
Like in most cases with Cantillon, quite amazing. I've grown a soft spot for Krieks over the years and this proves that they too can blow me away. I am usually more fond of framboise so now is the time to crack a LPF to see how it compares to this Kriek. If you have any 2012 vintage (10' sticker) Lou Pepe Kreik, it's drinking amazing right now. Unless you prefer bracingly sour beer, it probably can't get better than this at this point. Or who knows with the endless possibilities of aged Cantillon :). 2,055 charactersMarcWP, Aug 13, 2014

Appearance: Pours a vibrant, pretty much opaque grapey red color, and leaves a hint of reddish head that fades away almost immediately. A unique looking beer for sure. (4.75)
Smell: Big tart cherries, a bit of funky cheese, oak, grape skins. Really balanced and mouth-watering aroma. (4.75)
Taste: Tons of tart cherry, but not overly tart, decent amount of that Cantillon funk, spiced oak, vinegar. So much cherry, straight off the tree. Really drinkable and balanced. Not nearly as sour as Cantillon Kriek. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a great feel, and a dry finish. (4.75)
Overall: This is a fantastic kriek. The cherry comes through so nicely and is just the right amount of tart. This combined with the oakyness and funk is a wonderful combo. The balance is great, and this is an easy drinker with a lot of flavor. 936 charactersResuin, Jul 02, 2014

The nose was tart and sour cherry but was minerally.
The flavor is like candy, not too tart and not too sour. Its mellow sweetness highlights the natural raspberry flavor.
The feel is light and bubbly, sprite and delightful.
This is absolutely delicious, well constructed and a a true beauty to behold. 396 charactersKYGunner, Mar 26, 2014

Awesome score here and had to leave work early to snag it. 2010 sticker poured into a tulip on February 15, 2014. Pours bright bright darkish red and totally clear. Bright pink fizzy one finger head on top and dissipates quickly. Aroma of lots of vinegar, tart cherries and cherry skins. Flavor is sour vinegar up front and then lots of cherry skins and tart but sweet cherries. The balance here is outstanding. Not medicinal at all, cherry is highlighted but not overpowering like the New Glarus cherry brew, and it comes together beautifully. A nice vanilla oak in the backdrop that really mellows this out. Juicy cherries but lightly dry finish. Medium light mouthfeel, full flavored, and big bubbly carbonation. While cherry isn’t my favorite in beer, this balances it as perfectly as possible. Very nice. 832 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 16, 2014

A - Pours a dark cranberry body with a froth light pink head. Settles down into a pink ring of froth around the glass.
S - Tart to sour nose full of cherries, funk and light oak.
T - Not hugely sour or even overboard tart to me at first. Definite funk going on mixed in with mild oak and acidic qualities. The finish is more sour to me than the beginning.
M - Light bodied, high carbonation and a dry finish.
O - Very enjoyable, to say the least. 489 characterscvm4, Feb 14, 2014

A. Fairly aggressive pour yields a dark ruby color and light ruby head of one finger. Mildly effervescent. 
S. Tart. Tart cherries mainly. Sour yeast and bacteria. Fairly straight forward. 
T. A little more going on compared to the nose. Medium tartness. Sour cherries certainly dominant with a noticeable neutral oak component. Minor notes of plumes, cranberries, and apples. Mucha fruit. 
M. The viscosity thins out as it warms which makes it much more smooth. Low carbonation. Light body. 
O. This is a beautiful kriek. Wonderful smell and taste. This maybe my favorite Cantillon (so far). I would certainly purchase this ale again. Certainly recommended. 789 charactersmacher0, Feb 09, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had at Novare Res 12/13/13 for "Bier Geek Christmas."
I was told by the staff that this is a blend of 1, 2, and 3 year old gueze's that then spend about a year on cherries. If this is indeed similar to their regular gueuze blend, the fruit has really taken the acidic and sour notes down a notch, this is maybe a 3/10 on sourness.
This beer poured a very red color (sort of like red wine, but a bit hazy). It is literally cherry red. The foam is a lovely pink and settles down quickly to some lovely pink lacing around the class. Beer is essentially opaque. 
The nose is nothing like what I expected. It is mostly tart funk, not too acidic, not too much fruit, perhaps some hints of must (general lambic awesomeness). I had expected the nose to be really fruity and it really isn't.
The taste is a three part event. Up front I get a semi-sweet cherry bit, this slowly fades to a definite fruity sweetness (fruity not malty) that peaks a second or two after tasting and then fades to an acidic/tangy/funky bit in the aftertaste. This beer is by far the most complex beer I've ever had, so much going on here.
Great palate coverage, its a thin beer, but it never seems "watery" it holds up well on the palate.
This beer was simply fabulous, it was totally worth the $9 per 8oz pour, simply delightful. 1,305 charactersBowdoinbeerboy, Dec 14, 2013

poured into Cantillon wine stem.
Appearance: medium red colored beer with 3 finger of head that quickly drops tothin ring around glass.
Smell: moderately sour nose. Tart cherries. Slight funkiness.
Taste: Mild sourness atleast a 4/10; also has moderate funkiness. It is more funky that I expected from the nose. The funkiness is the signature funky note from most Cantillon sours. Tart cherries and a hint of lemon in the finish.
Mouthfeel: low end of medium bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation levels. This sour is very drinkable. Fantastic drinkability. I really enjoy how awesome the mouthfeel on this beer is. Semidry finish.
Overall: After finally having all three of the LP series Cantillions; Its close to a toss up which of the Lou Pepe series beer that I like better. I think the gueuze wins by a small margin. 910 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Nov 24, 2013

4.54/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 sticker, bottled August 2012; Bottle at Cantillon, served in lambic basket.
A – Initial pour is an intense clear red with hints of brown. Initially half a finger of light pink head, which quickly dissipates to leave a thin, persistent collar.
S – Aroma is a combination of intense cherry, and pleasant earthy funk. Cherry aromas are not the least bit medicinal, but clean, fruity and acidic.
T – Similar to smell, a nice mix of cherry and funk in the taste. The cherry is mostly dry and tart, though a small amount of sweetness remains. After the initial burst of tart cherry, some funky elements come in and linger through most of the taste. The finish, however, is pretty much all cherry. Clearly a stronger cherry presence than the regular kriek (though this is also a relatively young bottle), and it works beautifully. Looking forward to comparing to an older bottle to see how this develops.
M – Light mouthfeel, mostly dry but with a touch of sweetness. Finish is clean, dry and tart.
O – Just wonderful. At this young age it is nicely acidic, but not overwhelmingly so and still highly drinkable. 1,124 characterswarnerry, Sep 13, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.7575cl bottle from 2010; ordered and poured at Brasserie Cantillon into the Cantillon wine glasses 7/5/2013. 
Acidic and very pungent nose with a strong sour cherry scent and a small amount of musty funk. Basically the Cantillon 100% Kriek on steroids.
Lighter red body, almost even a bit pink. Beautiful and glowing beer. Very well carbonated with a large pink head that persists for the entire duration. No lacing.
Straight up cherry tartness, certainly very sour as well. But this is also a bit sweet compared to the 100% Kriek, which makes for an even nicer balance. More complexity in this one as well; the oak, earthiness and funk seem to be stronger here and brings more balance overall.
Lighter medium body, very well carbonated. Refreshing and extremely drinkable. Aftertaste is cherry tartness and sourness, no true sweetness here. Not a particularly dry finish which I have come to prefer and what Cantillons deliver.
Overall: 50% more fruit and 100% more balance and flavour. I really loved this beer. The cherries really bring a nice complexity to this compared to the framboise versions that are made here. 1,123 charactersStevedore, Jul 05, 2013

A: Pours a deep plum with a light pink head. Sits pretty in the glass - if you were to show this to someone they might call it a chick beer. Poor ignorant bastards.
N: Lots of ripe sour cherries, oak, some vinegar and glue. Wine grape and raspberry jame in here. Some straw and lemon zest. 
T: Cherry dominant. Rounded sourness with a touch of fruity sweetness. Has a wonderful depth of oak and fruits. 
M: Sharply carbonated with a light, manageable body. I love how the Belgians are able to get such character into such a drinkable beer. 
O: Tasty and it seems like it's balanced out the fruit and the funk at this point. Delicious. Need more. 767 charactersSarlacc83, May 23, 2013

Appearance - Bright pink with a faint pink head. Thick collar. Hazy.
Smell - Really nice cherry flavor. Deep cherry flavor. Oaky and vanilla is very strong. A ton oof acidity but not a ton of funk.
Taste - Sour cherries. Lots of oak. Vanilla. Funk is much stronger. Barnyard is more prominent here too. The cherries are the star of the show though.
Mouthfeel - Dry, very sour. Medium body.
Overall - Fantastic cherry flavor. Best characteristic of this beer. 540 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 20, 2013

Nice deep red colour, with a cap of white head, good retention, little lace. Smell is funky, sweet cherry still very much upfront, light balsamic, acidic, overall very nice mix of sweet and sour cherry with a big funk present. Taste is sour and puckering up front, big acidity followed by sweet cherry that cuts the acidic flavours nicely, balsamic, lemon and puckering fruits toward finish, drying finish. Light-medium carbonation, medium bodied, nice crisp mouthfeel. Fantastic stuff, less sour than the Bio Kriek but more complex and well rounded, certainly a world beater. 621 characterspeensteen, Apr 08, 2013

2008 vintage. I shall call him Lou le Pew. Tee-hee. Anyway, this stuff pours a clear burgundy-ruby topped by a finger of off-pink foam. The nose is a blast of sweet cherry wine (insert Tommy James reference, with or without Shondells), with a hint of light apple cider in the back for good measure. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the cherries come through with a bit of tartness, though with a clear restraint that keeps things from peeling the enamel from my teeth. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a decidedly dry finish. Overall, a very tasty cherry lambic, one that more than deserves the praise it receives. 685 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 17, 2013

I get some jammy qualities and almost a bit of rhubarb. Notes vinegar on the nose with slight hints of oak. The taste is delicious. Plenty of puckering tartness up front with delicious cherry forward profile. Not a whole lot of other adjectives I can use than cherry, but that is okay because this is delicious. Mouthfeel is heavily carbonated and tasty. Overall, delicious. 459 charactershomebrew311, Feb 16, 2013

S: aroma is pure cherry essence. There is a very strong vinegar aroma that seems to burn off as the beer warms revealing the tart cherries.
T: Taste is more cherry. Tart cherries, but with some residual sweetness, which is nice since the sweetness is usually fermented out in these types of beers. 
M: Lighter side of meduim in body. Heavier carbonation. Mild tartness.
O: This is a very very nice beer. I can really appreciate the restraint shown on this one, as this beers balance makes it quite enjoyable. 618 charactersFlorida9, Feb 16, 2013

Lots of cherry. A little sugary sweetness and acidic quality from all those cherries. Marzipan. As always a little funky. Oh yeah. 
When served to me the Lou Pepe Kriek was referred to as the Rolls Royce of Krieks on account of the amount of cherries in it. It is hard to deny such a title. Almond and barnyard.
A good nice easy carbonation with medium body. A little dry.
Pretty much a Rick Ross(bawse) Kriek. 502 charactersMattSweatshirt, Jan 22, 2013

Easy drinking, just the right amount of funk and the perfect sweet/sour combination. Probably the best Cantillon beer I had so far. 358 charactersCiocanelu, Jan 21, 2013

The beer pours a relatively clear, light colored reddish/rusty brown with almost no head. The nose is tart ...with a lot of funk, but no distinct cherry. The taste is definitely pungent with a whopping fruity tartness. The mouthfeel is highly acidic and dry with very little remaining cherry sweetness. This beer drinks like only a Cantillon would after 10 years...a serious champ. 454 charactersThePorterSorter, Jan 08, 2013

It pours a wonderful pink cold with a white head. The head quickly turns to lace which vanishes quickly. 
It smells of deep barnyard funk, with a light cherry smell. 
Initially you get a much subtle taste of the barnyard funk followed by the cherries as you drink this beer. There is a delicate balance kept between the funk and the cherries, a lesser brewery would have failed, but this succeeds. 
There is a light carbonation, which allows this beer to go down smooth. 
Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and worth the money on. 586 charactersSStein, Jan 01, 2013

Pour: Hazy ruby red, with a very nice fluffy magenta head. Head is somewhat fizzy, and while parts of it recede rather quickly, and nice bit hangs around. Doesn't leave much if any lacing.
Smell: Big barnyard funk up front, followed by tart cherry skins. Some pear skins. A light oak, and a light lacticity come through.
Taste: Follows the nose, but big tart cherry juice and cherry skins hit first. Some pear. A big barnyard funk next, followed by a lactic sourness. Finishes sour with cherries and funky.
Mouthfeel: Sourness is next to puckering, yet with mixed with the funk, it is awesome. A sipper thanks to how sour it is, and I enjoy it.
Overall: A really fantastic kriek. I think I enjoy this more than 3F Schaerbeekse Kriek. 824 characterscfrances33, Dec 25, 2012

It is a great Kriek, and will be my everyday beer when I win the lotto.

Thanks to ThoreauLikeAGirl
Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle shared with my wife.
Pours a nice deep cherry red with a nice 1 inch pink head. The head is very active and billows up but begins to recede immediately. The deep ruby color of the brew is near perfection. It is like an abyss of ruby red. (5.0)
Aroma of sweet cherries start things off with intense underlain funk. Nice lactic acidity in the nose as well. Tartness is definitely perceived in the nose. There is also a nice woody oak note to the nose. (4.5)
The flavor follows the nose pretty well. Starts off with some cherry tartness slightly balanced by some nice sugary sweetness and some slightly yeasty phenols. Some nice slight vinegar tartness is perceived that blends so well with the more cherry fruity tartness. There is some good funk and oak notes on the middle and back end. The mouthfeel is smooth with lower carbonation perceived in the palette. (4.5)(4.0)
Overall this is a delicious Kriek. Very tart with great cherry notes and some good chalky yeast notes as well. The oak also adds a nice earthy dimension. Very nice. (4.5) 1,162 charactersJoEBoBpr, Dec 23, 2012

A: Pours a reddish purple with a thin effervescent pink colored head. Excellent retention and clarity, and nice lacing.
S: Slight funk, delicious cherry, toasted oak, cinnamon, a little raspberry. Almost a red wine nose once warm.
T: Mouth puckering tart red cherry, some light barrel character, funk, tartness is mild to moderate and doesn't limit drinkability.
M: Smooth medium body and medium-high carbonation
O: The cherry complements the beer perfectly. Tastes real and in good balance with the base. Overall just really nice and highly drinkable. I could drink this all day. 612 characterspmarlowe, Dec 10, 2012

S: I know it's a kriek, but I get tons of different fruits in here from raspberry to cherry to lemon. 
T: resembles the smell, with a fantastically genuine flavor unlike any other kriek I've tried. The richness of the fruit complements the sourness of the beer very well, but this is very much a fruit-forward lambic, even though I think this was a 2006 sticker date. 
M: fine, light carbonation gives a slight lift to the acidity, but for the most part this is teeth-etchingly good. 
O: fantastic beer, so glad someone shared this at a recent tasting! If I find myself with the opportunity to buy or trade for another, I certainly will. 763 charactersHolland, Dec 03, 2012

4.53/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My favorite kriek to date. 2009 vintage, bottled in 2011. Pours an incredible deep cherry color with a frothy pink head that settles down slowly. Patches of pink lace stick to the glass. Powerful tart cherry aroma, oak, lemony acidity, hints of barnyard funk and hay follow behind.
Flavor follows the aroma; tons of fresh sour cherries taking center stage. The sourness is moderate in comparison to something like Hanssen's, so this stays away from the teeth-melting level, but it's still ample and pleasant, and doesn't start repeating on you after you finish the bottle. Lemons and trace vinegar notes, oak, funk, grass and hay all play elements. Very modest levels of both sweetness and acidity. Not quite a full pucker.
Medium to slightly light in body, crisp and lively carbonation. Supremely drinkable, full of subtleties and interesting nuances, a bottle I'd buy again in a heartbeat, even at thirty bucks a pop. 921 characterstobelerone, Nov 27, 2012

A-Pours a deep red/burgundy in color with about a fingers worth of light pink head. Head dissipated rather quickly. 
S-Nose is stellar, it’s Schaerbeekse cherry skins, lemon, and some mustiness. 
T-Nose translates over to the flavor. It starts out with the sour cherry and continues with lactic lemon goodness. The cherry endures well throughout the sip. 
M-Light mouthfeel, heavy acidity, light carbonation, and a long finish. 
O-My third favorite of the regular Cantillons fruit lambics behind Fou Foune and Saint Lamnivus. Great color, nose, and taste on this, I could drink this by the gallon (and subsequently did when it was on tap at Zwanze Day 2011). 724 charactersTnudish, Nov 02, 2012

A: Pours a very nice red/purple color with a pink head that foams up nicely. Decent retention, slowly reducing to a nice ring on top. Decent lacing. 
S: Very nice cherry flavor, a hint of vanilla and wood. A bold tartness mixes in, slightly acidic. Very big, bold, and inviting. 
T: Big cherry flavor upfront mixed with some other stone fruit. A very sharp tartness with nice acidity. A little bit of wood comes through, but not as much as in the aroma. Very tasty. 
M: Medium bodied with a great level of carbonation and sourness.

Pours an unreal, super cloudy, vibrant, deep pink/purple with a dense, light purple head that has excellent retention and lace. Aroma is light band-aid that quickly moves to baked cherry pie, freshly baked/burnt sweet cherries. Incredible. Taste is tart, not too sour, full of cherry pie. Really has no flaws at all. Soft, lactic, cherry yogurt palate. 9/5/9/5/15=4.1
750mL 2007. Pours perfectly with a creamy pink, thin head that lasts throughout. Nose is just so awesome. Soft, tart, cherries, cherry pie, raspberry yogurt. Taste is similar: a play off raspberries and sour cherries with such a soft, beautiful body it really is not even fair. This is definitely the perfect kriek.

A- A very bright, deep maroon red brew. Evident carbonation but no head in my pour. I saw pink head in other's glasses. Looked like cherry kool aid.
S- Funk me!! very funky, lot of bugs in this. I also pick up on the oak, with of course healthy doses of dried sour cherries.
T- A marvelous blend of tart, sweet and sour cherries. The oak plays a role in the flavor as well as the feel of the beer. This is moderately sour but not in your face. The funkyness not as pronounced as it was in the nose.
M- Dry, crisp and tart. Tongue smacking with every sip. Scrapes the tastebuds clean.
O- Great Kriek. I'm pretty new to the lambic style but this is by far the best I've had. Well balanced. 806 charactershaazer, Oct 01, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours bright red with almost no head. The color is so vibrant that it looks artificial, though obviously it's all-natural. Aromas of tart cherries dominate with almost no perceptible funk at all, which is surprising. Taking a first sip... wow, just wow. It's nowhere near as tart as it smells. The umami taste that cherries have (but are muted by the natural sweetness) shines through in this brew. The mouthfeel is simply luxurious: imagine the sensation of chewing cherries but somehow the experience is distilled into liquid form. I could drink this beer all day, any day.
Krieks are near the top of my favorite styles of beer. And while I've been lucky to enjoy many stellar offerings, Cantillon's Lou Pepe has surpassed them all. World Class! 748 charactersJimsArcade, Sep 30, 2012

The head is a bit on the fizzy side and has a very nice looking pink color. There isn't any retention or lacing on this beer. The smell is of tart cherries and some minor sweet malts in there too. The taste is actually a lot more subtle than I expected. It is definitely tart but it seems to be nicely balanced as well between the tart vs the sweetness. The mouthfeel is sharp and crisp, it feels clean and doesn't coat your mouth with any syrupy cherry flavors. Overall I enjoyed this actually. I am not a big fan of these kind of beers but I did appreciate having this one. 681 charactersKnapp85, Sep 30, 2012

A dark red color with a creamy pink head that rose and fell quickly. Some stray pink bubbles cling to the sides of the glass. Large amounts of tart/sour cherries greet you as you lean in for a whiff. Some clean hay and acidic notes along with an underlying aroma of oak. On the palate, loads of fruit. Cherries and raspberries lead the charge onto the palate with some acidic notes quickly in tow. A sugary sweetness lingers with a moderate acidic tartness. The finish is primarily sour with a touch of hay funk. A smooth, even mouthfeel with low carbonation. Really on point here. Just lush and smooth as it rolls around in the mouth. This is an excellent kriek. Great fruit flavor with a solid punch of sour. Delicious. 756 charactersColForbinBC, Sep 25, 2012

***Review 550***
A: Pours a reddish pink. Fluffy off white pink head. No lacing. No alcohol feet. The head sticks around for a little while. Really pretty beer.
S: Tart cherry. Funk. Barnyard. Delicious.
T: Tip of the tongue, tart cherry. Not overly sour with the age. It's just really amazing how clean this is in comparison to American sours. Actually pleasant. Close is dry but not bone dry.
M: Light leading to medium.
O: A 517 charactersinlimbo77, Aug 24, 2012

A - Pours a glorious almost crystal clear fruit punch hue with a nice one and a half light rosey pink head that fades to leave a thin blanket. Wonderful.
S - Aromas of solid funk, light tart cherries, and subtle barrel.
T - Taste is an explosion of floral oak, light funk, and tart cherry juice. Its so floral and potpourri that it almost lends a perfumey vanilla quality to the lambic. So delicious.
M - Mouthfeel is quite nice for a lambic. Again the floral and oak qualities dance around with the lighter carbonation.
O - Overall this beer is just as good as everyone says. Love having it on draft, works wonderfully with the raspberry and espresso tarimisu. 782 charactersrudzud, Aug 20, 2012

4.33/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52007 Vintage. Pours a dark red color with a medium, light pink head that disappeared quickly. Scent was quite acidic at first with sour cherries and other red berries. Tons of oak aromas with a subdued funky aroma (not one of the funkiest Cantillons I've had). Some spiciness with barnyard hay and some more berry...raspberry. Taste is very tart cherry at first, but casually transform to sweet and juicy. Slightly acidic with some lovely oak barrel flavors. Not the most sour Cantillon I've had, but very complex. Makes me wonder what this tasted like fresh. Probably like Cantillon Kriek. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and highly carbonated. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this beer was fantastic. Not the best Cantillon I've had, but they're all so good and all so different (even when it's the same beer, just a different batch)...this one was great though! 863 charactersDovaliHops, Jul 21, 2012

A - Pours a dark strawberry jam hue with beautiful thick creamy pink head and sheet lacing.
S - Sour cherries as you'd expect. Some natural syrupy sweetness shines through the funk along with some wet bark. 
T - Wowser, that's pretty sour. Huge tartness dominates, backed some fruity sweetness and oak. Lots of acid, was too much for the wife who dropped out early with heartburn. More for me. 
M - Great balance, medium body and carbonation. Bringing the funk in a major fashion and throwing in serves of gum destroying tartness. Big beer.
O - I remember having my first Cantillon Kriek last year and wondering if lambics just weren't for me. Having developed my palate since then, I'm sure I would appreciate it for what it is next time. Stepping up and over to the Lou Pepe though, was not regretted. 822 charactersdansmcd, Jun 25, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Deep Ellum for their pre-Festival Throwdown. One of the beers I was most excited to try. 2009 Vintage. 10oz serving served in an oversized wine glass. Consumed right after the event was supposed to start, so I'm guessing very freshly tapped.
A- Appears a fairly opaque dark red almost blood red in appearance, some translucency towards the bottom of the glass. No head, just a very thin foamy ring of reddish white bubbles around the edges. Small carbonation bubbles appear around the edges of the glass, slightly below average carbonation.
S- Very aromatic smell of tart/sour cherries, maybe some raspberries, a tiny bit of wood, and acidic aromas. Most predominate by far is the sour cherries.
T- Tastes of sour/tart cherries, a tiny bit of raspberries and other berries, definitely plays with the palate and leaves a sugary sour cherry aftertaste that lingers in the mouth and around the lips for longer then I've ever experienced in a beer (I finished the beer about a hour before writing this review and I feel like I can still taste it). I feel like I can lick the taste right from my lips.
M- Fairly light, perfect for the hot summer day today (90+ degrees), the carbonation perfectly complements the sourness and adds a great dry, sour, slightly bubbly finish to the beer.
O- I don't drink sours too often, I've always been more of a stout and DIPA person but I definitely enjoyed this beer. I started off the night with this beer and craved the taste of it so much that I had to order it again before I left (also considering I knew this beer is fairly rare). At $13/10oz serving this is saying something- I very rarely order $13 drinks, never mind twice in a night. I thought the beer was great in almost every way and I wish I could order it more often. I can definitely see why this is considered one of the best krieks/sours in the world. 1,866 charactersjaasen64, Jun 22, 2012

750 ml bottle served into a tulip
A: Bright cherry red with pink hues throughout, some maroon edges. Fluffy soft pink head with not much lacing and a thin cap of retention. Slick, tiny bubbles.
S: Oak, cherry puree, bright red fruits in general; strawberry and raspberry. Very funky on the back, hay and a mild acidic sour note.
T: Again bright red fruits, plenty of cherry with the dryness of some wood/oak coming in mid-palate. There too is that classic funk and mildly puckering sourness. The funk carries through with some hay-like qualities.
M: Highly carbonated, bubbly and spritzy on the palate delivering it to all corners of the mouth. Presence of a dry, woody finish. Classic Cantillon, and more importantly classic Lambic in style.
This being fairly fresh, the acidic bite I got from a recent 2004 vintage is absent. This focuses more on the bright red cherry and fruits, along with the funk. Torn between which I like more, though I can safely say this ages extremely well. 1,018 charactersShanePB, Jun 07, 2012

Beautiful ruby color. Very limited pink head that vanished almost immediately. Left a ring of small bubbles around top of the beer.
Tart cherries and some peppery spice. Some light musty wood and acidity.
Tart cherry is at the forefront followed by the peppery spiciness. Fairly acidic throughout, but there is a nice syrupy sweetness that backs everything up.
Dry and tannic, but there is a little bit of syrup that doesn't make it super-dry. Medium-light body, with a decent amount of carbonation.
A very awesome brew that we were very lucky to find. The bottle didn't last for too long, but I'll be thinking about this one for a while. 706 charactersjeremy13586, Jun 04, 2012

Pours a flat hazy raspberry red. Lies still. No foam. 4.0
Funky punch with a nose of tart cherries, sour raspberry, wet leather, straw, horse blanket, and slight acetic acidity. 5.0
Tart cherries fall back into a supporting role, the age scales back the fruitiness. Tannic acidity with a solid Bretty note. Backend lingering bristle from the oak. Concentrated fruit flavor like a cherry reduction sauce. Peppery note in the middle. Phenomenal complexity. 4.5
Little bit of spritz left in this one. Tannic, but wet enough. 4.0

A: The same color as a red ruby from Zelda with a scrumptiously pinkish white head. Minimal lacing, but who cares, it's fucking beautiful. 
S: Acidic strawberries and cherries, slight funkiness, hints of woodland aromas. Smells like a lambic on steroids. Way more potent smelling than any other lambic, but not in an offensive way.
T: Sour fruits with cherries being the most dominant flavor. This is definitely sour, but not overly sour. Compared to Cantillon Rosé De Gambrinus (the only other Cantillon I've ever tried) it's less sour. Flavors are strong, but not so strong that you have to brace yourself for each sip. 
M: Sour, low carbonation, very full for a lambic.
O: Wow, this is fantastic stuff. I'd drink the hell out of this if I could find it on a regular basis. Definitely a whale worthy of it's fame. Definitely my favorite sour yet. 926 charactersLordquackingstic, May 26, 2012

2009 Vintage (1pt 9.4 fl oz bottle) poured into a flute
A: Ruby red with 2 finger head that quickly disappears into nothing, almost zero lacing. 
S: Wow, lots of funk, sourness, some oak, some fruit notes (can't tell if it's sour cherries). 
T: It's not super sour (like Cantillon Classic Geuze), but it's definitely sour. I wish it was a tad bit sweeter, but this is a great tasting lambic. I can taste the sour cherries, funk, yeast, and then some oak and wood towards the middle/end, finishes with more medium sourness and tartness. Very complex. 
M: Perfect. Good amount of carbonation, light to medium body with a little bit of stickiness at the end. Not much puckering though. Gentle finish. 
O: This one is amazing. Maybe I need to venture out and try more lambics - I haven't tried too many varieties, but this one is by far the best out of the ones I have tried. Perfect on a sunny day like today! 954 characterssukwonee, May 12, 2012

Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek pours an almost intimidatingly vibrant ruby red. The two fingers of dark pink foam that crown the beer briefly, before disappearing without a trace, is similarly impressive in terms of vibrancy. The nose has a solid ripe cherry presence, before fading into aromas familiar to anyone who's had a great lambic. There's a little bit of wood (barrels? cherry pit? both?) that plays well with some of the more earthy brett aromatics. Meanwhile there's also some wet hay. The cherry aspect of the flavor profile has just a hint of sour/tartness to it, but otherwise it forms a nice opening before letting all those woody, earthy, and barnyard notes to fill out the beer. The body is light and crisp, with a positively champagne-like carbonation. Superb mouthfeel. This is my first time drinking one of Cantillon's Lou Pepe beers, and I'm not sure how much better this is than their regular kriek, but it's definitely a fantastic beer. 1,075 charactersaxeman9182, May 11, 2012

Beer is a dark pink, reddish, with a pinkish head. Head does not last terribly long.
Smell is very nice. Lots of tart cherry accompanied by a funky, horse blanket scent. Works well together, neither dominates the other.
Taste is like the nose. Tart cherry and funky yeast. Oak is present as well, which I do not get in the nose. Flavours work perfectly together- they are totally integtated into a cohesive package. Fruit taste very real, very juicy. Quite sour but not intensely so.
Moderate carbonation, light to medium bodied, a bit puckering.
Overall, excellent. A really well crafted lambic. 642 charactersjrenihan, May 10, 2012

Smell. Beautiful juicy sour red cherries,a little bit of horse barn and just a slight bit of light grains. The cherry is just awesome.
Taste. Plenty of tart red cherries, but not in the big way that the nose suggested. Nice moderate sourness, just a little funkyness. Not sweet, but just enough to keep it amazingly refreshing. Really nice.
Mouthfeel. Pretty light body with below medium carbonation.
Overall. I'm really enjoying this one. Fantastic tasting cherries and just enough of the classic lambic characteristics. Like the LP Framboise, I'd drink this all the time if I could find it and afford it. 743 charactersRutager, Apr 27, 2012

This beer is brewed with significantly more fruit than the standard Cantillon Kriek and it shows right from the get go. This beer is a striking ruby red with a crown of pink foam that disappears within a couple of minutes. The abundance of cherries really shows in the nose and appearance. The nose is so deep with sour cherries. The Cantillon funk struggles to make it through the onslaught of cherries. 
This beer is an ode to sour cherries. Puckering and sour upfront. Slightly sweet lingering cherry flavors at the finish. Not as dry as most Cantillons. Intense tartness, intense cherry flavors but somehow incredible drinkable. Not the most complex fruit Lambic on the planet but very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is good, I found the level of carbonation to be very good. Overall, this is an excellent fruit lambic and another Cantillon home run. 881 charactersBrew33, Apr 12, 2012

I love when krieks pour out this beautiful hazy red pink color with a small pink head. I think it's the most beautiful of all beers. A second pour gave off a much larger frothy pink head, but also much more haziness. 4.5
Oaky aromas with a big cherry note. It smells like when I made the Duchesse du Borgnone cherry pie. Sweet, but tart with a full cherry aspect. The tartness is for balance. 4.5
The taste continues the huge, dark and tart cherry theme that I am just crazy for in krieks. Aptly sour, it's completely focused on cherry and oak. So sweet, so balanced, I wish I could find more of this. It's fantastic, dare I say perfect? Again, slight variance across pours. Some are very sweet, others hint more towards acidic. I got the sweeter end (from the top of the bottle) and am quite happy I did. The second pour from the bottom of the bottom is acidic and aggressively sour. 5
The body is nicely medium with some carbonation. I'll just keep saying it: crazy drinkable. 4.5
This was served with a melt in your mouth lamb lollipop (thankfully without nuts, thanks Monks!) the cherry gastrique was simply perfect to pair with such a sweet kriek, and the lamb was delicious. 5 1,262 charactersrusswbeck, Apr 11, 2012

Crimson red with no head, only a ring of foam around the edges. Kind of opaque and rich looking. 
Subtle hints of vinous funk and tart cherries, with a dose of acetic qualities. Not in your face but certainly pleasant.
Opens with a real tart cherry flavor then quickly moves into the classic Cantillon lambic qualities. Acetic, horsey, and a little cheesey as well. Not real earthy, much more fruity and tart than funky. Good stuff.
Sticky on the lips, dry on the finish with a medium body and moderate carbonation.
Solid tart cherry flavor but I have to admit, I am a tad underwhelmed with this. I was expecting loads of fruit but was left wanting more. Still a solid beer, just a little hyped. 756 charactersauroracrisis, Apr 02, 2012

Cantillon's site says: "The Kriek contains 200 g of fruits per liter on an average, while the Lou Pepe beers contain about 300 g. This fruity taste, combined with the wine flavour coming from the Bordeaux barrels, distinguishes these special beers from the other Cantillon products."
Bubble-gum pink, fluffy head.
Aroma of fresh sour cherries. Brings me back to my grandparent's cottage out in rural Ukraine where we'd eat baskets of ripe sour cherries. Note that these are not the sweet Bing variety most Americans are probably used to. Rather, these cherries are smaller and mouth-puckeringly sour. Oh, but how delightful.
Flavor is pure cherries. What I love about this beer is the absence of any flavor that stands in the way of tasting these cherries - no harsh alcohols, caramel flavors, hops, or off-flavors. Just sour cherries. The acidity perfectly accentuates the fruitiness.
It would be interesting to see how this ages - a year, two years. I suspect that fresh is best for high fidelity to the fruit.
Mouthfeel is light, but not watery due to the acidity that forms this beer's backbone and the mild carbonation. 1,143 charactersjibbyvonjibb, Apr 01, 2012

Pours a light white head. Color is a stunning grapefruit ruby red. 
Aroma: tart cherries with a some acidity. Funky and sour with some vinegar. Cobweb and basement must.
Taste: tart cherries but also some sweetness. Cherry pie filling. Lemon citrus and acidity. Very fresh and fruity but still has some old funk and cobweb flavor.
Mouthfeel: tart and sour. Light bodied with a fine amount of carbonation. Ends clean.
Overall, this was a really nice kreik. Very drinkable and flavorful. Not medicinal like some can be. I dig this one.

Not as big of cherry as the 2013, but still has that cherry pie filling flavor. Not very tart or acidic which is nice. Light sweetness. Some funk and oak with alight vanilla, but mainly fruit. Ends a little dry.
Solid vintage, but the 2013 sticker still trumps this. 4.3 967 charactersmothman, Mar 10, 2012

2009 vintage, had in Feb., 2012.
Poured bright red, a little cloudy, with some pink-white bubbles on top. It's a kriek, so, aroma of cherries, as would be imagined; hints of acid. Nice tart cherry taste, balanced with maraschino sweetness, mild acidity, but not at all acetic, so the fruit is dominant on the palate. Medium body, tingly carbonation, no alcohol detected at all. Very nice drinker overall, but nothing to go ape over. 523 charactersRifugium, Mar 01, 2012
4.12/5  rDev -8.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip. Brewed in 2008, bottled September 8th, 2010. I had a 2010 non-LP Kriek a few months ago and it was quite an ass-puckering experience. I hope this is a little less caustic.
3.5 A: Lightly hazed deep cherry mahogany color. Two and a half fingers of pink, fizzy head. Retention isn't so great and no lacing is left.
4.0 S: I'm a bit surprised. This is way more funky than fruity/tart. Musty basement type funk dominates with rotting wood and old sweatsocks. Cherry is surprisingly faint for how "young" this is. Mildly tart with mild to moderate notes of lactic acid tanginess. Very light acetic acid. It's quite nice, but I was expecting a bit more depth.
4.5 T: The cherry definitely comes out more in the taste. Mildly tart with a big hit of cherry flavor. Again, this is much more funky than sour. Musty basement, musky large mammal, dry-rotted sweatsocks, decaying wood, and apple orchard. Mild lactic acid, but it's just enough to add some fruit depth. Acetic acid isn't really detectable. 
3.5 M: Medium body. Carbonation is on the higher end, but it's fine except that it isn't very spritzy. Also could use a bit more creaminess. Super smooth though.
4.0 D: What a completely different experience than what I had with the regular Kriek! This one is not only palatable, but also mighty tasty. I'm not too crazy about the price of this though. 1,372 charactersDavoleBomb, Feb 27, 2012

Deep red pour with ample reddish-white head. Decent lace and strong aroma of fresh cherries linger. Yeasty notes hit the nose too, but fresh cherries remain in my mind.
Taste begins where the aroma left off: cherry fruity-ness meets a mildly acidic base, blending into an extremely pleasant mixture of fruit and tartness. Mildly tart, not extremely sour, but exceptionally balanced. Overall, this is a better, more balanced beer than the Cantillon 100% Lambic Kriek '07 I've had on multiple occasions. My palate, however, prefers the super acidic, extremely sour flavor profile that resulted from that 2007 batch.
Regardless, I really love Cantillon. Bring me more! 744 charactersbrystmar, Feb 06, 2012

Vintage 2008
Look: Pours a darker shade of pink body with a lighter shade of pink head that is just over 1/4 inch and ok retention
Smell: The nose is full of sour cherries and a bit of grassy funk
Taste: Mild sour cherries with a touch of oak and a touch of funk on the backend. Very nice
Mouthfeel: Light body and ample carbonation

2009 Sticker date
Bottled on 01 September 2011, good for 10 years. 
This is the 8th beer in my series of sours and is the first of my 3 krieks. 
Appearance: This is hands down the best looking lambic I have had! Absolutely stunning deep pink body topped by a large, creamy, pink marshmallow coloured head. The subsequent pour cause more clouding and a much deeper pink, almost purple tinged, body. 
Smell: Mmmmm, this smells absolutely delicious. My first whiff seemed to be all funk, but with each subsequent sniff the fruity cherry character seems to increase until the point that is almost more dominant than the funk. The cherry character is both tart (dominant) and sweet (underlying). Other notes include: Sweet strawberries, vinegar, lightly vinous, old wood, musty, wet hay, oak and a hint of feet. 
Taste: Simply delicious! Wonderful balance of cherries (mostly tart this time) and funk. Tanic cherry skins, a touch of sweet berry, oak, musty hay, old wood, sweat and a touch of vinegar are also noted. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate, fine bubbled carbonation. Moderate tartness (not mouth puckering) and a light dryness in the finish. 
Overall: I have heard this beer described as one of the most intense fruit beers on earth and I wholeheartedly agree! Stunning mixture of sweet-tart cherries and funk. I will certainly be having this again in the future! 1,455 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 25, 2012

2008 Vintage
Thanks to ZX6Chris for sharing
Shared at MrHirschybars tasting
App- A good bit of a mix between pink/purple in the glass with a good white head that fell quickly with a bit of dotty cling.
Smell- A whole lot in this glass. Very tannin forward with some great oak, funk, fruit and sweetness behind it.
Taste- A sour beer to say the least but was very temepered and balanced with fruit/sweet and the oak treatment. Didnt have a huge puckering flavor but was more of a sipper. Cherries are there and provide a bit of acid and vinegar but this was just sublime.
Mouth- A good bit of a light-medium with some very medium-high carbonation to it. The after taste is very wine like with some acid/tannin and fruits. Well balanced residual flavors.
Drink- Chris brought his A game on Saturday and I can't thank him enough for this treat. It was very well balanced, fruity and tasted great. I am very glad I have a bottle at home to now sit on and savor for a bit. 1,019 charactersFosterJM, Jan 23, 2012

2008 vintage.
Pours a murky cranberry red with an off-white head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of lots of sour and funky cherry aromas along with some woody aromas. Taste is the same and has a great but very sour flavor. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great lambic with fantastic aromas and flavors. I am very happy I was finally able to try this one. 531 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 22, 2012

Bottle from September 2009. Cork in perfect state.

S: Acid and fruity on the nose. Cherry tart. Oak and Lambic yeasts
T: Mild sourness. Cherry, crispy malts, barrel and yeasts

4.42/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52008 vintage. I've been dying to open this for some time now, glad I'm pulling the trigger finally.
A: Very deep ruby red, this has some serious color to it. A massive spritzy pink head forms that goes down real quick. A pink ring sets around the beer but there's no lace.
S: This has amazing wine characteristics, gobs of oak and sharp fruity tartness. Cherry is in full effect, real fresh smelling. Bugs also cut through the mix no doubt about it, this smells crazy funky. I can practically smell the barrel room at Cantillon in this.
T: The cherries actually keep this grounded when you first take a drink, there is some building tartness initially but the darker cherry offsets it some. Just as in the smell, this is very woody-tons of oaky vanilla, years worth of wild yeast and bacteria. It gets fairly acidic on the teeth, I wouldn't drink this on an empty stomach. As far as sourness this isn't even close to Rose de Gambrinus or the more readily available beers; The sourness is kept in check, to a degree. The carbonation gives you a nice kick of sour while swallowing.
M: This has a lighter-easy drinking body with high carbonation. It really dances on the tongue.
O: LP Kriek lives up to the pedestal I put it on. This beer tastes very mature, the brewer let the beer come into it's own without trying too hard. Simple and complex at the same time, sour enough to appease sour fans, yet down to earth enough for most newcomers. 1,444 charactersschwaeh, Jan 21, 2012

A: Massive 1" pink head that dissipated quickly over murky dark raspberry vinaigrette coloured liquid.
S: Funk, vinegar, some oak and cherries.
T: Tartness and vinegar up front, and this acidity breaks into flavours of sour cherries and some oak on the back end.
M: Thin viscosity and a high level of extremely fine carbonation.
O: The viscosity was much thinner than I had expected, and this has more vinegar and funk than fruit taste as compared to some of the non-aged Cantillon lambics. I found this to be extremely drinkable once my palate settled down. 650 charactersDaftCaskBC, Jan 19, 2012

Shared by whiterascal and poured into a Russian River glass. Brewed in 2007 with Schaerbeek cherries and bottled in 2009. 
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. The beer’s a brilliant crimson with perfect clarity. One inch of rosy, pink foam is dense, sticky and homogeneous. The cap fizzles away fairly quickly, becoming a thin, frothy top layer.
Sugary cherries, soft barnyard funk and lactic tartness in the nose. Packed with spices, like mulled cider. Cinnamon, apples, anise and more. Such balance and complexity.
Major lactic, vinegary tartness is first in the flavor. Tart Cherries are in there as well, along with some soft horsey funk. The swallow brings that amazing cherry cider complexity: cinnamon, sweet cherries, vanilla, more mulled spices. Hefty lingering tartness on the sides of the tongue. Complex, drinkable, awesome.
Highly carbonated and fizzy, bringing life to the medium-light body. It’s a bit thin for me, with a bracing acidity that grips the teeth.
Lou Pepe Kriek is a damn near perfect example of the style, exhibiting a masterful balance and blend of tart, sweet flavors. 1,128 charactersPhelps, Jan 06, 2012

Hard to review this one as I really found no flaw with it...in my eyes the perfect Kriek. Pours a hazy grapefruit pink body with an inch of pink coral head. Smell is brilliant. Fresh tart cherries, oak, slight tannic dryness, a touch of musty funk. Tastes flawless too. Starts off with a kick of fresh cherries, very tart but balanced acidity, lots of oak notes and a little barnyard wildness on the finish. Also picked up some floral, almost perfume-like, notes on the finish. Mouthfeel was less thin than the standard Kriek and perfectly carbonated even with the age. Overall, I can't see a Kriek exceeding this one. Not sure if the age made the difference here but it sure didn't hurt. Seek this one out and buy it if a recent vintage is on the shelf. 815 charactersDrewZ926, Dec 29, 2011

Note: 2008 edition (bottled 2010)
Appearance: Bright red, a cherry color - thin pink head, some lacing - pour from the first half of the bottle is clear, second half is cloudy thanks to the delicious sediment
Smell: Hay, cherries, cherry skin, barnyard, horse blanket, funk - the funk is quite substantial with an undercurrent of farts and feet - the unpleasantness fades, however - some acidity, some tartness, some sweetness
Taste: A ton of tartness and cherries - dry, not as funky as the smell - a little vinegar, acid - definitely sour, but more tart than sour - some light fruitiness, tannins, wood, a little puckery
Mouthfeel: Very tart and mouth-drying, not particularly puckering - medium body, very smooth, good carbonation
Overall: Great, but not mind-blowing
This is a great kriek with a lot of depth. I split this bottle with Goblinmunkey7 at the Ale House in Amesbury, MA. We paid $30. Was the bottle worth $30? No... but close considering the bar markup. I would love to have this again if Cantillon weren't so expensive and impossible to find. 1,107 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 27, 2011

A tight dense head of light lavender-esque pink appears and disappears just as fast. A juicy nose, filled with tart cherry, wild funk, damp basement, faint graham cracker crust. This beer opens with a lactic tart cherry hit, lots and lots of cherry/berry flavors, some pie crust in the taste and brett charecter and oak. On the finish this beer is like a perfect sour cherry. Not thin, clean, crisp, dry. This is one of my top cantillons to date, tons of flavor, well crafted, balance....but could have had a bit more sour. 615 characterspmlondrigan, Dec 27, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage. Picked up a bottle at the Cantillon brewery in Brussels.
A- Pours a dark cherry color, produces a finger of pinkish red head that fizzles quickly to a thin ring.
S- Big tartness, cherry sweetness, some vinegar and oak.
T- Starts out similar to a lot of Cantillon beers with a big blast of Jolly Rancher / Warhead sourness, but from the first sip you can also pick up on a more pronounced oak flavor. As your palate gets used to the tartness a delicious cherry pie flavor comes out, very fruity and tasty. Earthy yeast funk rounds out the background as expected.
M- Medium bodied, well carbonated, finishes semi-dry.
O- Another slam dunk from Cantillon, the fruit and oak is more pronounced on the Lou Pepe than on the normal Kriek, although both are absolutely delightful beers. I look forward to finding another bottle. 839 charactersWillCarrera, Dec 22, 2011

T/M: Thin body with a tart sourness in the back of the lower jaw. Hints of funky vinegar. Lots of cherry playing well with all of this. Finishes quite dry.
O: A delicious beer that could be paired with many light and fruity dishes. 428 characterskjyost, Nov 25, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - pours a ruby, cherry red without much of a head on it
S - the nose consists of cherries with citrus and funk. Nice smelling nose, but to be expected at the same time.
T - sweet cherries up front fade to a citric sourness. The sourness is a bit understated; this isn't as sour as the regular version of this beer. As this warmed, the cherry flavor started to really pop, imparting a really nice cherry pie finish to this.
M - medium body that finishes dry
D - pretty solid kriek. My second venture in the LP series and another winner. This isn't as acidic as the 3F kriek I had next to it or the '05 Cantillon Kriek that I also tried. This had the perfect amount of cherry and lambic to it. Worth the hunt? Tough question when the regular kriek is so damn good as well. But Yes.
Update: I had a couple pours of an '06 LPK in Summer 2013, so 7 years later. The beers was amazing - the fruit was still exploding, the lambic more funky and acidic than fresh. Age this one! 977 charactersbirchstick, Nov 23, 2011

A - Potent, bold, red coloring with a deeper color around the edges. No head, carbonation, retention, or lacing. This one sits very still. 
S - I nosed this one for a long time. Excellent cherry component. It is 100% pronounced yet not at all overpowering, and despite the years of aging the fruit smells fresh and intoxicating. Behind the cherries are candied sugar, grass, dry hay, earthiness, dirt, and oak barrel notes. Not deeply funky but well-balanced. 
T - Again, great cherries here. Sweet fruit and sugar front notes lead into a sour backend that rivals Classic Gueuze. The tartness lingers in both the finish and aftertaste. 
M - Medium body with adequate carbonation. Somewhat smooth. 
D - Can't wait to see what age does to this one. I'm feeling blessed to have sampled this one with an identical vintage sitting in the reserves. 972 charactersAuracom, Nov 10, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a 750 at Provisions,
A: Pours a gorgeous red with a heady cap of pink foam. Nice lace.
S: Cherry pie, notes of funk, definitely fruit forward.
T: This is brewed with 50% more fruit than the regular Cantillon Kriek and it shows. Delicious pie cherries, a great interplay of sour and sweet. The fruit dominates, that's fine with me as is true and delicious.
M: Medium-bodied, fairly light acidity for Cantillon, round in the mouth, unctuous at times, but only slightly.
O: Another classic delicious beer from Cantillon. Not as good for my palate as compared to the regular Cantillon Kriek (much more acid, good interplay of flavours - acid and fruit) this is wonderful as well. Fans of the fruit will adore this. 720 charactersHalcyondays, Nov 07, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Split a bottle with a friend. Ah, this is the way fruit beers should be. The cherries complement the base beer without overpowering or oversweetening. There's still that biting citric sour character, but with a gentle layer of the fruit blending in with the funk. That said, this wasn't a life-changing lambic worth the extra cost of a Lou Pepe, but a fine example of the kriek style. 384 characterstempest, Nov 07, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750ml bottle "2008 sticker/vintage" meaning this was bottled in 2010. Poured into a matching Cantillon stemmed tulip glass. This brew appears a perfectly clear ruby red color. A pink stained head appears 2 fingers strong and rapidly dissolves. Some spotty lacing sticks to the glass. The head holds with a fine ring around the edge of the glass.
The smell of this brew is quite earthy with pitted cherry quality that is deep and almost stem-like and rooted. Lactic sourness fills the nose with a sour and funky quality that makes me salivate. There is some raw oakiness across the back mixes with a light bit of must character. When swirled it brings forth a bit of stinky cheese aspect.
The flavor is sour and earthy with a distinct taste of cherry pits that is flavorful enough to display a mixture of both over-ripe cherry character as well as an exaggerated sourness of unripened tart cherry as well. Some cheesy quality is present as well as the classic Cantillon funky quality. At times this brew gets lightly medicinal but it isn't distracting because the fruited quality is very natural tasting an not sweet. There is some raw oak and musty quality present. It leaves the tongue quite drying on the finish.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Sharp and sour with a very enjoyable earthy cherry flavor that doesn't retain any residual sweetness. There is seemingly no alcohol impact on this brew. It carries with it a pretty big salivation factor. I couldn't get enough of this. Surprisingly for being the same vintage as what I had on tap recently, the experience from on tap verse the bottle is drastically different. This bottle was more sour like the normal Cantillon offering while on tap it was much more fruited and sweet tasting. Certainly worth a try by either means. 1,829 charactersstakem, Nov 03, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank from my Duvel tulip and shared with my buddy Sam.
A - Pours a clear Ruby Red colour with a tight pink coloured head that reduces to a thin film.
S - Plenty of woody oak with some sweet cherry like aromas.
T - First off is the bitter oak vineous flavours that are well balanced out by the sweetness and a really nice cherry vapour fills your mouth.The finish is a nice sourness complimented with the strong cherry vapour that lingers around. Exquisite
M - Light body with full carbonation giving a sprtzy feel.
O - The best Kriek that I have ever tried, and I'm still to have an average beer from Cantillon. 617 characterseric5bellies, Oct 13, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 bottle split between 3 people.
Pours a bright deep red with a light pink head. Looks like a Raspberry soda if there were such a thing. The nose is lightly vinegar with big cherries and a touch of funk. The taste is big cherry and a mild amount of sourness or funk. Not particularly sweet, which is nice. It actually drinks quite easily and is almost surprisingly quaffable. Good carbonation, not too excessive like some sours seem to get. Overall, I think I was expecting more, but quite enjoyed what was delivered. 520 charactersseeswo, Oct 10, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a flute. I had this at the bottle funk even at Teresa's Next Door.
Appearance: Pours a dark red color with a layer of pink head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Very tart cherry with some herbal bitterness and a sweet cherry finish.
Taste: Not very sweet at all. There is tart cherry throughout each sip. The finish is tart but not biting. This beer was very smooth, I'm not sure of the age of the bottle my pour was from.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with mild carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: This is a good lambic but it didn't wow me like I expected it to. That being said, I'm sure I'll have it again if I get the chance. 682 charactersoline73, Oct 05, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52007 vintage bottle thanks to ksurkin for the sample. Pours a deep red body with a light red on the outside of the glass. It smells like sour cherries all the way. You can tell it is going to be a puckering beer as soon as you smell it. The taste follows the nose as expected and is balanced by just a touch of sweetness to keep this from being an all out assault on your palate. I wish I could have this beer everyday whenever I wanted. My oh my what a wonderful beer. 469 charactersdoppelme, Sep 29, 2011

A: Pours a light red with a quarter of pinkish head.
S: Cherry fruitiness and nice mild funk.
T: Cherries up front with the tartness coming in late. This tastes just like a Brut sparkling cherry wine. The carbonation is tighter like a champagne.
M: Light body with good carbonation.
O: I would drink this again. 371 charactersjale, Sep 27, 2011

Draft at Monk's Cafe - served in flute glass
Vintage 2008
L: Hard to say as it was quite dark in Monk's at the front bar; however, I'll go with V8 Splash-esque color (i.e. mix between cherry, raspberry, and strawberry swirled together). No head.
S: Mixed basket of fresh berries. Nice and different, but in a good way.
T: Combo of cherry and raspberry tartness mixed together with dramatic sourness. Hidden vanilla that tries to accent some type of wood character, but I cannot make it out.
M: Light and smooth. Not what I was expecting based on the appearance of this beer, but good nonetheless.
O: Tasted quite fresh and I really enjoyed this beer. I will definitely seek it out again going forward! 718 charactersspdyfire83, Sep 23, 2011

Zwanze Day 2011
Bottle Share
Stone Brew Co.
Escondido, CA
(Aged for 2 years)
Cloudy yet bright red with glowing grapefruit edges and a thin pink head. Spots of lacing down the glass.
Rich cherries and biting sourness combine to make an incredibly aromatic and uniquely special smelling beer. The cherry aroma is vibrant and alive while the biting sourness is stinging yet not overly aggressive. There's a bit of wood and a mild farm funk as well.
Rich cherry flavor coupled with a stinging, full sourness without being too acidic or attacking, balanced remarkably well with comforting, inviting flavors of hay, earth, and a bit of wood. 
Light to medium bodied with lots of carbonation. 
Blissfully good beer. 730 charactersehammond1, Sep 20, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 vintage on tap in a Cantillon long stemmed flute at Zwanze Day.
Appearance: The pour is a hazy cherry color, hazy enough that I can't see through the narrow glass. The head is a pink ring that never bubbles up or really fades.
Smell: The aroma is full of cherries, slightly on the tart side, slightly sweet, with a little bit of straw and barnyard funk in the back. 
Taste: Up front, light toasted grains roll into sweet cherries. Gradually the flavor turns sour. It never becomes too acidic, and the sour is more tannic and dry as opposed to vinegary. The finish is somewhat sour but fairly clean.
Mouthfeel: For a lambic, the carbonation and body feel to be right in the middle of the spectrum. Moderately sour, slightly dry. This does not really cause salivation or puckering.
Overall: This is my second time having this vintage, and although I really appreciate the quality of the beer, the lack of intense funkiness or puckering sour keeps me from loving it. I was definitely in the minority of people who did not enjoy this as the favorite of the day. 1,067 charactersKickInTheChalice, Sep 20, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at Zwanze Day Chicago. Served in a Cantillon glass. I easily drank fifty dollars worth of this yesterday. So amazing. 2008 vintage.
Appearance – Pours into my Cantillon stemmed glass with an utter radiant cloudy red color. This is the type of liquid you don’t want to spill on any clothes because you know that bright stain will never come out. Just a hint of pink head that dissipates almost as soon as it is poured.
Smell – As expected, loads of ripe and tart cherry aromas. Earthy notes sidled by barnyard funk, mixed with vanilla and oak. 
Taste – Just fantastic. This is in my opinion leaps and bounds above Zwanze 2011. While the tart cherries do come through, there are also the wonderful overly ripened cherries right behind it so add a subtle sweetness to the beer. Throughout the sip there is a somewhat strong oak and vanilla flavor. A nice acidic quality with musty hay to finish it up. The mixing of flavors is fantastic.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, prickly carbonation, exactly what I would expect.
Overall – What can I say. This was a fantastic beer and I was able to purchase one too. I will probably never consume as much of this ever again as I did yesterday. Delicious. 1,215 charactersSpdKilz, Sep 19, 2011

Lots of tart cherries. Very bold and fresh. Lots of oak in this, really balanced out the bright cherry.
Nice mild carbonation an quite smooth. Bits of dryness in the finish. Oak residue on the teeth.

4.03/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 408 bottle into a tulip; sampled at Ebenezer's Night of the Great Thirst.
A: Cloudy ruby body with a finger of frothy pink foam. Good retention, spotty lace. Beautiful.
S: Fruity, juicy, cherry combined with powerful and distinctive Cantillon funk: lemon, grass, mustardseed, barnyard. Quite nice, but nothing extraordinary.
T: Sour cherry, mild grassy funk, and a clean, dry finish. Simple and good.
M: Medium body, frothy, and pleasant.
O: This is a great beer, but it suffered by comparison with the Oude Kriek de Cam, which was better in every way. I was expecting more of a cherry explosion here, and actually found its impeccable balance between fruit and sourness to be a bit boring - I wanted it to be the inverse of the fascinatingly abrasive regular Cantillon Kriek, but the cherries just didn't "pop" like I was expecting. Oh, well, there's really no greater luxury than nit-picking a delicious Lambic.

4.25/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Argh. This is the second Cantillon cork I've broken.
Poured into Victory Pint.
Appearance is a cherry juice colour.
Head is pink white. Overall impression is of a creaming soda. Nice lacing.
Smell is pencil eraser, funk with a markedly synthetic edge. There also seems to be cinnamon and cinnamon sugar. Toasted marshallows. The oak's presence is less chocolatey and more savoury, charred; even faecal.
Taste is sour. Not straight lemon sour but a measured, slightly sweet, fruity sour. So I guess that's where the cherries come in.
Body is medium with medium high carb (and sour).
Overall a great beer especially for the harmonious and balanced taste and mouthfeel. Would have a slight preference for the Framboise over this but it's always a delight to sip and contemplate a Cantillon. 794 charactersdanieelol, Aug 27, 2011

Nose: Sweet yet tart cherries, oak, vanilla, musty barnyard funk and slight lactic acid.
Taste: More tart cherry than the nose, lactic acid, slight vinegar, drying oak, hints of vanilla and funk from the classic Cantillon yeast.
Mouthfeel: Light, refreshing and slightly drying in the end.

Appearance: Bright red in color, with some nice carbonation. 
Aroma: Fresh, sweet and tart cherries upfront. Some vanilla and earthy notes balance the sweet, tart cherries. Lots of horse blanket and barnyard notes are present too.
Taste: Fresh fruit and tart cherry notes hit first. The tart cherry is not as intense as in the classic kriek. A nice smooth vanilla note really opens this up. Plenty of funk as well. Extremely well balanced and complex.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied and plenty of carbonation. Very refreshing. 
Overall, a really nice and complex kriek. The cherries balance the line between sweet and sour really well. This really is completely different from the regular Kriek, but is also amazing. Definitely something I would not hesitate to get again and somethnig I would love to try with more age on it. 998 charactersGosox8787, Aug 19, 2011

S - Tart, a little skanky, cooked cherries somewhere in the middle.
T - Like smell, but VERY tart and the cooked dark cherry flavor mixes very well with the tart.
M - Medium to light body, nicely carbed and balanced.
D - The tartness could wear you out, but a very nice beer at a low ABV! 448 characterssrandycarter, Aug 18, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this beer on Thursday at monks after the outstanding Monday event they held. Poured a beautiful red hue with a minimal amount of head that dissipates quickly leaving a nice little ring around the glass. The aroma is huge tart dark dried cherry. There is a mild funk, but I didn't detect it here nearly as much as some of the other cantillon they had there. The flavor is eerily like cherry pie. Cooked cherries with a tartness and a little too much sweetness, but only a little bit. Mouthfeel is nice and light with lively carbonation. I really enjoy this beer. Outstanding beer by cantillon. 596 charactersAgold, Aug 11, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5'08 vintage poured into a 6oz wine glass at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia.
Bright bold beautiful red color. Spritzy bubbles come to the surface with little head, but ample carbonation. Aroma is a smorgasbord of ripe juicy cherries and acidic tart sourness.
Taste is excellent and mirrors the smell quite well. Beautifully complex cherry flavor that rides the line between cherry pie, sour cherries, and fresh picked cherries off the tree. Biggest disappointment would be the lack of depth beyond these flavors as I'm struggling to find the barnyard flavors that I love from most Cantillon vintages. I'm finding that I may prefer the regular Kriek with a few years of age.
Mouthfeel is pretty standard. Prickly carbonation and slightly puckering. Pretty much what I expected.
Another amazing beer by Cantillon. Not the best Kriek I've had, but really delicious. Interested in seeing how my '07 bottle compares when I open it in a few weeks. 941 charactersvictory4me, Aug 10, 2011

The smell of cherries and oak is present in the glass. The taste of cherries with a little sour backend. Good mouthfeel, not overwhelming. Overall, a good lambic that's not strong but very drinkable. 480 charactersWestsidebuddha, Aug 07, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 vintage poured into my favorite chalice. A cloudy ruby brew with a large pinkish white head.
Smells sour with notes of cherry, medicinal funk and the wild yeast. When I distance myself from the glass I can pick up a very appealing strong cherry smell. 
This beer is very tart up front, tart cherry, sour cherry candy. The sourness of the beer is not what I expected, it's more tart then sour. A medicinal funk finishes the taste. There is no sweetness in the taste.
A fairly full mouthfeel.
I find lambics to be very different from what I drink on a daily basis. This was really good, none of the flavours are wrong or over the top. 641 charactersalpineclimber, Aug 02, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52005 vintage poured into a wine glass at Monk's Cafe, split with a dear friend. What a treat - I don't think I have the financial self-restraint to consider moving to Philly. 
A brief disclaimer: I ordered this bottle at 12:30 on a Friday night/technical Saturday morning, and Monk's has a sort of reverse-Apple store lighting scheme going on to begin with. That said, I'm pretty sure I could see the vibrant cherry red body of this beer even if there had been no lighting at all. There's a billowing white, slightly-pink head that forms from even the slightest pour. Gorgeous lacing.
Oh, it smells sour. Pungent acidic cherries and tart lemons predominate. And there is funk in abundance here. I hate to recapitulate the countless Cantillon reviews before this one, but I'll be damned if there's not a serious barnyard funk, horse blanket aroma going on. 
It's difficult to compare the taste of this beer to any of the younger LP bottles I've had in the past. It tastes like Sour Patch Kids - the purest, most amped-up Sour Patch Kids ever created. Bracingly sour, but the cherries come through beautifully. So much citric acid and grassy funk, it tastes elemental and pure. 
The carbonation is flawless: perfectly bubbly, with a rich, lush mouthfeel. The years have done nothing to diminish the lively feel of this beer. Eminently drinkable.
Time has treated this beer exceptionally well - I would love to try an older bottle. A phenomenal beer, world-class. 1,465 charactersamphion1065, Aug 01, 2011

Appearance -- Pours a vivid rose red hue with a tuft of fluffy mauve head. Handsome.
Smell -- Highly acetic with wet oak and a bold tart cherries being the most pronounced. Dank basement-like funk also in attendance. A top-tier aroma for sour heads.
Taste -- Deep, penetrating sour from the onset - high acetic tartness paired with tart cherries. Again, musty basement funk in solid quantities, which adds some contrast to the unrelenting sourness. As it warms, the acetic qualitiy relents slightly to reveal a pie cherry sweetness. Very much a roller-coaster ride.
Mouthfeel -- Medium-bodied with tight fluffy carbonation. Incredibly drying.
Overall -- I struggle to think of a kriek that stands up to this one, even amongst the Scharbeekse cherry krieks. Great depth of flavor, and nicely tuned sourness. World-class for certain. 994 charactersyeahnatenelson, Aug 01, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Had this last night to celebrate the life of someone I just lost. 750 ml bottle; 2007 vintage, bottled in 2009. Poured into an oversized wine glass...
A - Exceptional looking beer. Poured a beatuiful cherry red color that is quite clear. A gorgeous foamy, pink head forms about 2 fingers thick. Very nice retention.
S - Cherries out front, but I am not bombarded with their sweetness like I feared I would be. It is a mix of tart, sweet cherries and cherry pie filling scooped right out of a homemade pie. Wood notes and classic Cantillon barnyard funk come next mixing very nicely with the sweetness of the cherries.
T - Cherry is much more integrated into the flavor profile here and is really complement ed nicely by the slight sourness and acidity. Funkiness and tartness work well together to make a truly unique tasting lambic. Woody undertones add nicely to a really tart flavor profile.
M - Very nice carbonation and a medium bodied beer. Nice dry finish to this one. Puckers the mough for sure, but it is that great kind of tartness you want from a beer like this.
O - Awesome, awesome beer. This is why Cantillon is the best at what they do. Exceptionally balanced beer and one that I am going to seek out every chance I get. 1,240 charactersKAP1356, Jul 26, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the Brick Store. 2007 vintage.
Pours an opaque bright crimson color with a half off-white, half pink head that leaves decent lacing.
Smells of robust cherries that are crisp and tart. Also present are medium malts and good amounts of funk – wet hay and leather. There are multiple layers and each is well represented.
Tastes similar to how it smells, though not quite as complex. Moderately dry medium malts up front are joined almost immediately by bright and lightly tart cherry flavors and hints of raspberries. Midway through, the funk really comes into play, carrying through to a mildly tart ending. Mouthfeel is good, with soft carbonation.
Overall this is a phenomenal beer and one that I’d like to have regular access to. Well worth a shot if you see it around. 788 charactersglid02, Jul 26, 2011
4.06/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I was super excited to see this one on draft, it was at the Bavarian Lodge is Lisle, and it was my birthday. That place is too good.
The color is a deep red with a slight purple tint to it, with a head that is a pinkish hue. Pretty hazy throughout.
The aroma gives notes of the cherries used to create the beer, a sweetness plays through those flavors along with the funk you expect.
This one has a strong acidity to it, the tartness and sour dryness is remarkable, leathery tannins are just outstanding. The cherries come through to make an outstanding tasting beer in every right, and the funk adds alot of complexity. 
Finishes so very dry, makes you want to take such small sips, and sip again a few seconds later, and i accept. 732 charactersChadQuest, Jul 25, 2011

4.89/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52008 vintage had on-tap at ChurchKey. Practically sprinted to the tap when I saw it was offered. After trying the standard Cantillon Kriek for the first time, it instantly joined my nebulous top-five-of-all-time-that's-probably-more-like-15-or-20... So I knew that the beer that was three years its senior and probably more complex from the get-go likely wouldn't disappoint.
Well, it was probably one of the best beers I've ever had. No question. Take the standard Cantillon Kriek, add some sweet spices, tone down the yeast activity and grow it three years in the tooth, and here you are. I usually think of BFM's tea-brewed beers when using words like subtle, understated, and complex, but this beer takes that delicacy and may leave BFM's best in the dust.
It's an opaque, ruby red with a shocking amount of carbonation considering the complete lack of head. Cherry funk, barnhouse flowers, and a raw, boozy citrus that seems to magically dissipate the longer it stays in your mouth. There's no really great way to describe this beer; it's pretty much sublime, so go out and grab one when you can. 1,103 characterspetacutlasaurus, Jul 22, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 42008 vintage, bottled: 21 September 2010. Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip. 
Appearance
This is the deepest red I've seen in a lambic. Its just so densely red through and through. The color of beet juice and fully opaque. A small pink head flashes away with next to no lacing. Swirling brings up a substantial bubblegum pink ring that leaves slippery lacing that just doesn't have cling. 
Aroma
This isn't the strongest aroma, but its quite nice. The cork certainly smelled amazing. A nice punch of horsey funk kicks things off. There are big wafts of veiny, moldy cheese as well; I bet this would kick my ass with a selection of bleu cheeses. Cherries bring a little bit of tartness, but they also seem to smell quite fleshy and sweet. 
Taste
Quite sour, but this is Cantillon. Plenty of funk is actually tasted right off the bat, and even more so as the beer warms slightly. It has a myriad of funky flavors: old paper, wet dog, straw, and an aged cheese sharpness. Cherries come out towards the end and are fleshy and ripe. The finish yields a citric level of acidity, calling to mind grapefruit rind. The taste really comes into it's own after the beer has sat in the glass for a little bit. 
Mouthfeel
Geesh. This carbonation is out of control. As soon as the beer hits the mouth it explodes into foam. It fizzes up, expanding to fill the mouth. You can swirl away some of the excessive Co2 but its still a bit much. The beer is very dry and crisp, which is nice. 
Overall
Drie Fonteinen's Schaerbeekse Kriek is still fresh in my mind. I actually wish I had held on to it so we could do a little Schaerbeek lambic tasting. But to compare out of memory, I'll always favor 3F's crazy funky aromas, but I think the Cantillon tastes better. This really is one of the better krieks out there, but I'm not certain that it lives up to the hype. 1,845 charactersMbpBugeye, Jul 16, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5EDIT: ratings edited from recent tastings, review not edited.
Bottle has 2008 sticker date, poured July 2011 for my Cantillon birthday tasting.
Beautiful ruby red color with a red foamy head. Frankly this beer looks even better than it tastes.
Some sour cherry on the nose, but more metallic sour and funk than fruit.
The flavor is good but a little disappointing after the miraculous Lou Pepe Framboise we opened just before this one. Good cherry flavor, but not anywhere near the level of fruitiness as the framboise had, not really any more fruity to my taste than the normal Cantillon kriek (granted, I have not had them together on the same night). The sourness is also less acidic than the framboise and more of a metallic funky kind of sour. The cherries just don't shine through as much as I hoped they would. Still a tasty beer.
This beer was good, very solid lambic, but not a standout amidst the other wonderful Cantillon beers we tried the same night. Not really worth seeking out when the standard Cantillon kriek is much more readily available. As good but no better than the classic kriek. Weird how that happens--I also enjoy the standard 3F Oude Kriek more than the 35 Schaerbeekse kriek.

4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured on tap at ChurchKey first into a small snifter, then into a tumbler. Vintage 2008. Shared a pint with other BA drabmuh!!
An absolute gorgeous ruby color and clear. That is it. No head, no lacing. Just a gorgeous dripping red and glowing with perhaps a slight puck. Love this color.
First nose is a hint of heat and lambic like sour. But then gets more interesting and diverse. Lemon, a distinct wood smell (can't pinpoint) even some white hot pepper. Cherry with minor chewy sense. Just incredibly complex nose just wonderful and one that you can just bury in without being overwhelmed by tartness. I am just blown away by this nose just flat out amazing.
The first thing that hits me on taste though is an incredible tight fizzy carbonation. Sour jolly rancher candy of cherry taste and body.
If it wasn't for this tight carbonation I probably would have rated this much higher and may very well have been the best lambic I ever had. This an exceptional fruit lambic period, just fantastic. 1,002 characterssmakawhat, Jul 01, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Max's. I missed out on bottles, and figured if I could get two glasses at Max's for the price of one at Church Key, I would.
Pouring a turbid cherry color with a dense, pink head that recedes to a thin ring, this looks pretty good for a kriek. However, I shall dock half a point because it looks so girly that this chick asked me what the sweet, fruity beverage I was drinking was. The nose, OTOH, was fantastic. Rich, deep cherry character, with a wonderful schaerbeeks cherry character with a blend of leather, cherry pie and a little less cocoa (than the 07 vintage, at least) present. Fresh, tart rhubarb, bright and piquant, are noticeable, along with a strong, lactic sourness with a subdued vinegar character. Not much vinous or oak character are present.
The palate opens with a brilliant blend of bright cherries, a little leather and a dense, complex parquet of cherries and lambic. I can't really describe it better than saying that that's what I want a kriek to taste like - intensely sour but never wearing on the palate, incredibly fruity, pleasantly oaky and moderately tannic with an illustrative blend of oak tannins and skin tannins. Soft, frothy and fluffy on the palate with a mildly fruity and pulpy character, this beer is a masterpiece on the palate. I drank about 25oz, and could have gone for another 25 if I didn't have to go home. A stellar kriek, I'm being stingy here only because I think the 07 was the best possible kriek there is, and this isn't quite there yet.
**Edit 30 Aug 2015**
Drinking my lone bottle of the 08 LPK, which is the same vintage as reviewed above. Beautiful nose with masterful funk,  leather, earth, preserved lemons (mild, compared to what the 07 vintage was at its prime). Soft, fruity, beautiful. So sad i won't be seeing this again. 1,802 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 30, 2011

A - Pours murky red, bordering on pink, with a small film of pinkish tinted head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of tart cherries, horse blanket funk, light vinegar, and a good bit of sourness. This is one nice nose, lots of things going on but not to the point of going overboard.
T - This was a bit of a letdown after that nose. The tart cherries this beer is known for where there initially but they are quickly swallowed by the overwhelming sourness. Some dry wood and light sweetness creep in toward the end but they fade quickly. The finish is more sourness, lingering for some time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Very tart feel with plenty of sourness lingering throughout the finish.
O - Overall this beer is very good. I have had it multiple times out of the bottle and it has always impressed me. I would have liked a bit more out of the taste department but these things can be a bit hit or miss. Glad I have a few bottles of this stuff in the cellar. 1,101 charactersorangesol, Jun 27, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 Lou Pepe kriek on draft at Max's today.
The beer pours a gorgeous reddish pink color with good head retention and light lacing. The nose, of course, is off the charts... there's nothing quite like the aroma profile one gets from Cantillon. In this case it consists of white vinegar, wet blanket, moldy socks (seriously) and bright cherry. In combination, the aroma profile is nearly indescribable. The flavor profile isn't quite as interesting, as it's completely dominated by the sour funk. The fruit peaks through on the mid palate, and there's some wood and vanilla on the finish, but the dominant flavor in this beer is sour, sour and more sour. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a fairly long, sour finish. The alcohol is completely unnoticeable in this beer, which enhances this beer's drinkability (such as it is). 
Couple of thoughts.... obviously, this is a beer for sour lovers, but really, I think a bit more fruit would benefit this beer, giving it more of a sweet tart flavor as opposed to just flat out sour funk... but that's just me. Sour beers are just not my forte. Still an impressive effort and a very interesting beer to sample. 1,164 charactersJohn_M, Jun 27, 2011

S - Solvent, plasticy phenols, barnyard, red summer fruit.
T - Begins with a rounded tartness, which fades but never leaves thoughout the whole drink. Cherry appears in the middle but is pushed to one side by citric tartness towards the end. Long finish of apple and slight tobacco. Astonishing fresh and vibrant given it's the best part of a decade old. Nicely integrated.
M - Medium, verging on full body. Initial spritz of carbonation fades and leaves a creamy mouthfeel.
D - Cantillon delivers once again. Well integrated yet retains a bright red fruit flavour. Definately less tart than their other beers I've had and has aged gracefully. 802 charactershaz77, Jun 26, 2011

Nose is tart cherries, hints of wood, some barnyard funk and something that is coming across almost minty. Flavor is quite balanced, especially compared to some of the other Lou Pepe iterations. Tart cherries, oak, earth, barnyard funk, lemony acidic character fairly restrained for the series, real dry finish, beautiful carb.
One of the better Cantillons I've had, fruity and funky with a drinkable yet complex sourness. 634 charactersritzkiss, Jun 25, 2011

A: Pours a hazy bright cherry red with a thin collar of pink film.
S: Really dry and tart smelling, musty, similar to an old woody attic or a wet, dank basement. I get some slightly cheesy notes as well as tart cherries.
T: Big fresh cherry taste along with some cherry juice. Really flavorful, woody and musty. 
M: The tartness is so clean when drinking Cantillon. The carbonation is tiny and the body is extremely bone dry.
O: Straight forward tart cherry goodness. I could drink a ton of this. 
EDIT: 2006 vintage:
This vintage is super-duper funky. Like, nasty old cheese inside a pair of sweaty socks in a gym locker in the sun funky. This is a great vintage if you’re into nasty cheese, which you are. 725 charactersscottfrie, Jun 23, 2011

A - Pours a deep red, with a big fluffy white head. A slight haze, but not much... looks awesome.
S - Definitely cherries first, followed by some serious Cantillon funk, earthy barnyard, definitely going to be tart, and also some slight wine character.
T - Not quite as sour as I thought it might be, but definitely tart. Sour cherries dominate, with some always solid Cantillon lambic to back it up. This lambic had some flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on the whole time, but it seemed very familiar to me. Perhaps a combination of the schaerbeek cherries, the sweet liquor, and the wine barrel. The combination of those flavors made this one of the best sours I've had. Great stuff.
M - Bubbly, puckering, dry, all things that make lambic great.
O - One of the best sours I've had the privilege of having. Had this directly following the standard Cantillon Gueuze and it stood well above. Something about this kriek gave it a very unique aspect that I haven't seen in other fruit lambics. I hope I can get a hold of another one these... 1,136 characterskhumbard, Jun 12, 2011

T- Tons of cherry and sour overall fruit flavor. Funk, acetic, oak and wine hints add to the complexity.
MF- Foamy light body with high, fizzy carbonation. An obvious cheek puckering sour finish.

Strong, tart cherry in the nose, with oak and some cream.
Very fruit forward in the taste, surprising amount for Cantillon. Strong, fresh cherry, oak, wine notes all around. Sourness and light funk comes out more as it warms but the cherries definitely win here. Smooth, light mouthfeel, carbonation on the lower side for the style.
Definitely the most drinkable Cantillon I've had so far, smooth, tasty and goes down too easy, but truthfully nothing blew me away about this. I was hoping for a bit more considering the price. 728 charactersChico1985, Jun 10, 2011

S: Smell is funky and oaky with a light hint of cherry 
T: Wow, this is an intensely cherry (like authentic cherry pie cherry) without being that sweet and the funkiness and oak carry into the flavor, it's got some sourness to it, but the sour is definitely in the background here while the cherries dominate. 
M: Carbonation is fairly high and beer is medium bodied, nothing particularly spectacular, but solid for this beer.
O: Overall this is a hell of a beer. It's not as sour as I expected given how sour the regular Kriek is, but there's still some sourness there.

Served in an 8oz whit wine glass. 
A: It pours a deep red color with lovely purple hues in the light. There was a small white head that dissapated rather quickly leaving no lacing. 
S: The nose is full of succulent tart ripe cherries. There are also notes of hay, leather, and wet socks. The lactic acid has obviously performed it's duties as wafts of sour funk fill my nostrils. Oak is present but extremely subdued amongst the other prevalent players. 
T: This is everything I daydream about in a kriek. The cherries are front and center but any hint of sweetness has been gobbled up by the yeast and critters. It is extremely tart and sour with a wonderful presence of brett; barnyard, leather, and hay are all there and really balanced. The oak shows up on the palate in the form of a nice woody finish.

Wow, blood red Hawaiian Punch. The deepest and brightest red I have ever seen in a beer. Two fingers of spritzy and quickly evaporating head forms, bright pink, and then leaves nothing behind. This beer is gorgeous.
Was expecting to be overwhelmed by cherry in the nose, but instead, I am overwhelmed by that wonderful musty Cantillon funk, it dominates the nose. Aroma leans more to the sweet side rather than sour, probably because of the relative freshness of this beer. Fresh, ripe cherries are powerful, just not as much so as the funk...
Again, expecting to be overwhelmed by cherries in the taste, instead the musty, earthiness aspects of the flavor come to the forefront. Heavy on the funk, usually these flavors are more prevalent in aged Cantillons, not a fresh one such as this. A very quick, biting tartness when you first sip, the fruit character is not all that apparent, that is, until you lick your lips, that is where all the cherry was hiding. The cherry becomes stronger as I sip, but still, the funk is king. Finish is big on the oak with a lingering, woody dryness...
Body is on the lighter side with a moderate level of carbonation. Not as spritzy as a fresh "regular" Cantillon Kriek, this one could use a touch more bubbles. Still quite a nice drink either way...
Another wonderful beer by Cantillon. $30 per 750ml is very steep, is it worth it? Well no single beer is really worth $30, but whatever, I'd buy it again if I saw it :) 1,581 charactershawks10, May 21, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle, 2007 vintage. Pours a dark deep red with a thin pink head. Aromas of sour cherries, oak and funk. Flavor is exactly the way it smells. Tons of sour, tart cherries with hints of oak and acid. Medium bodied, with good carbonation and excellent balance of flavor. This one is definitely more tart/sour then your typical Cantillon. 341 charactersalampear, May 14, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5On-tap at Fountainhead
A - It pours a seemingly blood-red hue, but it is quite dark in the Fountainhead so I cannot really tell; it is capped with some filmy froth.
S - The nose is pungent cherry first and foremost, and is backed strongly by the requisite Cantillon musty funk. As soon as I accomodate myself (and recoil from my Floridian shock relative to seeing Cantillon on-tap,) bright bushy green notes suggest a melange of freshly foraged berries, beyond the cherry.
T - The lambic is fairly sweet and quite heavily laden with potent fruit flavor. Cherries are the most distinct fruit, but suggestions of varied drupes including currant, raspberry, blackberry and blueberry are faintly implied, and the punchy tartness seems to derive from the fruit rather than the funk character.
M - Almost medium-bodied, softly effervescent.
O - Cantillon LP on-tap? You gotta be kidding me. I should stay in my seat until I drain this keg. 938 charactersktrillionaire, May 08, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Lauren (ThoreauLikeAGirl) for sharing this bottle of 2004 Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek with me, Kaydogg, jeffcrowther, phillybeer7779, and BrewerDan23. This is the first bottle of Lou Pepe I've had--due partially to the cost (~$30 each), but mostly because finding people to share the bottle and talk about its contents isn't always easy. I am grateful to have friends that bring beers like this to share. Now to the review...
This beer is a beautiful garnet red with pinkish-red highlights when held up to the light. The carbonation is on the lower side and doesn't produce much head, not surprising. As soon as the beer is poured, you smell FUNK. Diaper-y, assertive brettanomyces acridity, along with bright cherry sweetness in the nose. This doesn't sound the most pleasing I know but to me it smells good in the way that you can't look away from a car wreck.
The beer is very sour and dry. The beer itself undoubtedly was sour, but the addition of the sour cherries furthers the acidity. The lambic has a lot of the funky flavors you'd expect, but what I didn't expect was the creamy smooth mouthfeel. The acidity and low carbonation, made this beer feel so full in my mouth probably because the acid draws water from my mouth without any astringency.
A very tasty treat shared with friends. I've heard that the 2005 LP Kriek was better, so I look forward to the opportunity to try that vintage to compare.
___
The 2008 was much less funky with a brighter acidity and a black cherry sparkle in the finish. It still has the complex interplay between barnyard and tart, but the balance is a bit more level and both are a little more refined letting the fruit shine through better. 1,692 charactersSoonami, May 07, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of the reddest 'beers' I've ever seen, a pink and red color blend, minimal carbonation to this one. Definitely delivered on the cherry and sour aroma.
Taste, another winner from Cantillon, this one delivered more of a cherry mouthfeel than the 100% kriek I've had from them, but was not as sour. This one is more for the cherry lover who truly likes the mouthfeel of cherries than the sour tart puckering mouthfeel that much of Cantillon does oh so well. It is very reminiscient of the New Glarus Belgian Red, but with some sour compliments to it. Not dry, its a heavy cherry feel. 
Tiny bit of wet oak. More viscosity thickness than expected. 649 charactersBeerandraiderfan, May 04, 2011

s - totally raunchy funky gueze-esk stank. like an old mans armpit in the best possible way. the fruit is there, but definitely is fallin off a bit. 
t - way sour and funky like most cantillons ive had. absolutely delicious. grapefruit and cranberry bitterness but definitely a lot of sweet cherry. it seems to be fading off. slighty perfumy on the back of the throat.

A: The beer pours a medium light red in color with a 1.5 finger pinkish head that has excellent retention and lacing.
S: The smell is mostly of cherries, with a touch of funk and earthiness deeper down.
T: The taste is a nice balance of sour and sweet cherries. The sweetness comes through more at the beginning with more of the sour kick at the finish.
M: Crisp, with a nice level of carbonation. This has a great aftertaste and a nice overall feel.
O: I wish I had bought some bottles of this when I had the chance. It’s excellent, and unfortunately think it’s sold out in the area. I would gladly have it again. 668 charactersglazeman, Apr 29, 2011

4.55/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A bottle from 2000 provided by Dyan at our recent tasting. The 2nd of the Lou Pepe varieties that we enjoyed that day, and the 12th beer overall.
The deep rich red schaerbeeke cherry-enhanced lambic seems to glow in the light of the room. Light carbonation streams upward from a few nucleation points. 
The aroma is sweaty barnyard hay on top of a rich cherry sweetness...remarkable after around 10 years in the bottle. The sweetness is balanced nicely with a lactic sourness and some earthy and fruit skin tannins. Light lemon rind aromas from the lactobacillus round it out. The flavor tracks almost directly from the aroma, except that the cherry evolves to an almost cherry pie filling sweetness. The bone dry and earthy finish is far different from the lambics made by other traditional brewers, but again, just completely phenomenal.
As I recall from my review of the 2007, age does begin to bring out some more earthiness where there was only fruity sweetness early on. This beer will hold up for years longer. A side by side of old and young would be very interesting. 1,079 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 17, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 Edition. Bottled 2009 . Poured into my cantillion tulip
A: Pours an absolutely beautiful rich, dark cherry color with a towering bright pink head that settles into a nice pink ring around the edges of the glass. 
S: The initial nose is a lovely bright cherry aroma with a little bit of sweetness followed by a wonderful tartness. A little bit of acid in the nose, but it appears as if most of this character is coming from the cherries. 
T: Tart cherries and a bit of a puckering feeling as a result. A nice, crisp acidity comes through, and it goes down really smoothly. Cherries are absolutely the dominant flavor without much else coming through. Perfect balance between the sweetness and tartness within the cherries, especially alongside the slight acidity that comes through as well.
M: Light to medium-bodied with just the right touch of carbonation. 
D: Supremely drinkable. 892 charactersbeerpirates, Apr 16, 2011

A: Standard pour yields a .5 finger fine light strawberry colored head with good retention. Beer is a clear red. Lacing is sparse with little to no stick. Nice head retention but otherwise rather standard.
S: Nose is dense cherry puree, Brett funk, wet wood, and a slight cheesiness. Deep and subtle. Enticing if not the most aromatic.
T: Opens ascetic and sour lemon rind with slight hints of sweet and tart cherry fading in and out. Time has really taken the fruitiness out of this one. Vinegary towards the middle. Hay, straw, and Brett funk at the end with a sharp, tart finish. Aftertaste is puckering sour lemon and cherry. Very well balanced but seems a bit past it's prime in terms of fruitiness.
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth with a nice dryness and biting tartness on the tongue. Goes down nice and silky with an accented tartness at the finish, which is dry. Aftertaste is dry and slightly puckering. Feel is near perfect for it's style
O: At this point, this vintage is a bit past its prime in terms of fruitiness. However, it's still an incredible representation of it's style. Very well balanced in terms of smell and flavor and with a near perfect mouthfeel. 2 or 3 years ago, this may have been a perfect 5. Currently, its simply very good. 1,426 charactersSpeedwayJim, Apr 09, 2011

Pours a purplish/maroon color with light pink head. slight hint of fruit in the nose, but mostly a nice funky aroma. taste is tart and sour, but mellower and not as biting as many lambics/guezes are. almost refreshing like a nice juice as well. mouthfeel is light. overall, very nice offering, better than the 100% kriek. I like how balanced this one seems. It's sour, but lets the fruit flavor shine and goes down much smoother. 443 charactersBlanco, Apr 09, 2011

A: Poured with a small-moderate, light pink head that very quickly diminished down to a ring. Body is a beautiful dark pink/purple color, with excellent clarity. Effervescent.
S: Surprisingly mellow aroma of sour cherries, with a touch of sourness/acidity to the smell as well.
T: Wonderfully complex. Strong cherry flavor, but not sickening/overbearing in the least. Moderately sour, some acidity, with a touch of horse blanket funk. Just awesome.
M: Moderate-high carbonation, maybe even high, with a light body.
O: Just an awesome fruit Lambic. I've also had the 2008 in the past, and they're fantastic. Get your hands on some if you can. 660 charactersberley31, Apr 03, 2011

Beer poured into a Cantillon crystal straight sided tumbler. Hazy red, but very bright and evenly red when held up to a light. Very pink soapy head leaving a lot of pink lacing as the head receded. Vigorous carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass. 
Nose is sour cherries, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, sweet cherries. Some oak and lighter red wine aromas as well, mainly tannins. Grassy wet hay funk mingles with the sour and sweet. 
Taking a sip, vibrant cherries, very sour initially, but then a lot of sweet cherries and red fruits with light biscuit malt washes over the tongue. A bit of oaky tannins and fresh grassy funk lingers with sweet cherries on the tongue for a long time. Absolutely delicious.
Light bodied, highly carbonated with soft bubbles to really release aromas in your mouth without tiring out your tongue. Had two glasses of this one since it was so good. 984 charactersnataku00, Mar 28, 2011

Pours a clear dark pink with a light pink head that settles fairly quickly and leaves some light lacing on the glass. This is definitely one of my favorite looking beers. The aroma is huge cherry, pie crust, some hay, funkiness, and some lactic acid. The cherry is phenomenal. The taste has an initial light cherry sweetness and lots of of lactic twang. There is also funkiness, hay, and pie crust. Finish is fairly tart with lactic and tons of cherry. Medium-full bodied. Slightly creamy mouthfeel. Medium-low carbonation. Just an amazing beer. The amount of cherry is overwhelming. This is definitely the best fruit lambic that I have had.
5/5/5/5/4.5
Draft at the Trappist. 2008 Vintage. Pours a darkish read with a two finger pink head with good retention that leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. Just beautiful. Aroma is huge cherry. Smells like a cherry pie. Typical Cantillon funk, but just a background note as the cherries are front and center here. The initial taste is sweet, juicy cherry. Tart, but certainly not overly sour. Perfect balance to the fruit. A little bit of the barnyard funk, but again just a background note behind the fruit. Nice tart finish. Almost no astringency. Medium body. Medium carbonation. I enjoyed this when I had a bottle, but on tap it is phenomenal. Easily one of the best beers I have over had. If this were available regularly I would be ecstatic, but my wallet probably would not.

Vibrant black cherry red with a short-lived pink head. The nose is all cherry pie filling, sweet and sour, incredibly multi-dimensional and complex. Sour, sweet and earthy with flesh and skin and pit. Tastes ridiculously good, cherries at the forefront exhibiting ripe juicy sweetness, tannic skin and earthy pit. Moderate lactic sourness backs the fruit, it's not full-on sour by any stretch, more of a balanced presence. Funk is mild, buried beneath the fruit. This is just an astoundingly good beer on tap, a true session lambic. 570 characterslargadeer, Mar 26, 2011

A dark pinkish, almost red color. Pink hued whitish head. Two fingers. Amazing retention. 
Smells of sour cherries, oak, and funk. Very Cantillon. Not quite as sour as I had hoped, but it is very tasty. It is becoming more sour as it warms. The flavor is delicious and intense. I personally think I prefer 100% Kriek. The cherries here are very sour, but there is some underlying sweetness that gets cut through by a sharp lactic note. 
Body is medium and well carbonated. Nearly perfect. 
This spectacular. The fruit is huge and delicious. The sourness is nice. I like this beer quite a bit-- I just wish it were more sour... 659 charactersAleWatcher, Mar 19, 2011

UPDATE 3/14/11
Opened a 2008 vintage last night and it was even more stunning that I remember. This vintage is brilliant in every way and I am bumping up my old score of 4.5
ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:
Pours a stunning ruby color with 3 fingers of bright pink head
Aroma is light on the funk for a Cantillon, but there is still some cobweb present. On top of that is some cherry tartness, earthiness, and a bit of citrus peel.
Much like the aroma, the funkiness and sourness I associate with a great Cantillon is tuned way down. However, in this case, it is not needed because the cherry flavor here is awesome. Light barnyard mixes with the fresh picked cherry flavor to produced one of the best fruit beers that I have tasted.
Mouthfeel is medium with a bit of sharp carbonation. Standard for the style.
Overall this is a very fine lambic and definitely belongs in the discussion of the best in the world. 914 charactersalcstradamus, Mar 14, 2011

A: Pours with a surprisingly good amount of carbonation and nice small head. The initial pour is surprisingly clear as well. However, as sediment gets stirred up it becomes a translucent amber red color.
S: Fresh tart cherries with a strong acidity. Oak with almost a vanilla aspect. Strong bretty funkiness. Definitely the best cherry smell I've experienced.
T: Wow! Amazing cherry flavors with a perfect level of acidity and funkiness. The oak flavors are amazing with a vanilla character as well. Very complex with flavors that are a bit hard to describe. There is a bit of a salty flavor as well which is interesting. 
M: Phenomenal mouthfeel with the perfect level of carbonation. Puckering acidity and drying tannic qualities. The flavors are very coating in the mouth and linger for quite a while. Very wine-like.
D: This is extremely refreshing and drinkable for such a strong flavored beer. Would be a great summer drink on the shore. Too bad this stuff is so damn expensive! 1,003 charactersmmercede, Mar 06, 2011
3.85/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.52007 Edition, from a 750 ml green bottle, capped and corked. Pours out a rich translucent garnet hue, tall pink fizzy head that quickly settles.
Sharp acidity and earthy tart cherry sums up the aroma.
Sharp acidity up front in the flavour, tart and sour cherries back this up, revealing mild earthy malt near the finish, more sour cherry, with some barnyard funk joining and lingering in the aftertaste.
Medium-low mouthfeel, sticky and acidic texture. low carbonation.
For those who adore acidic ales this stuff will make their toes curl, however for the kriek fan there's not much being offered from the fruit. I'm rather on the fence with this one, I can appreciate it for what it is (and how rare it is to get), however am quite content after half a glass and not craving any more of it. 795 charactersIronDjinn, Mar 02, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to jedwards for sharing. 2008 vintage bottled in 2010. Pours a gorgeous raspberry color with a semi-hazy clarity and a mere skim of a head. Nose expresses tart cherries up front, followed by a sweet quality and some sourness, perhaps grapefruit seeds. Taste consistent with nose, with the addition of a cinnamon character reminiscent of atomic fireballs, as well as vinegary cherries and a saltiness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a mild, even carbonation that falls just short of being still. Acidity and astringency stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. This beer is everything a kriek should be - flavorful, tart and refreshing. 663 charactersJwale73, Feb 20, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5a phenomenal beer every time. fresh, aged, whatever. reviewing the 2008 (bottled 2010) version. pours a glowing red with a lively pink head that shrinks to a collar pretty quickly. collar stays around the whole time. very pretty. nose reveals many layers of different fruit (strawberry, cherry, citrus), earth, must, funk, cobweb, vanilla, oak, and what is coming off to me like almond paste (like the semi-sweet chalky/pasty stuff in the little metal tube they use for those delicious Moroccan cookies). wow. there are wine barrel hints in there in the back end for sure as well that brings almost like a bloody minerality. taste is divine. the brightness of the cherry and tartness hit first, but before sour can take over, edges are rounded out by vanilla, wood and nuttiness, while grapefruit pith notes come in adding a touch of bitterness that helps lift everything back off the palate. once again, something very reminiscent of wine comes through in the back end of the taste, and if it isn't wine barrel aged, i'd be surprised. creamy, medium-full body that tingles just a bit from moderately prickly carbonation drinkability? i could drink this all night, and everything about it makes it feel like a special occasion. epic good. cantillon does it again. 1,263 characterstimtim, Feb 16, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 vintage, bottled in 2010. Consumed on 01.23.2011. Poured into my Cantillon wine glass.
I've always enjoyed the blood-red body of this and 3F's Schaerbeekse Kriek. It glows a vibrant red. One inch pink head settles to a cm thick ring about the glass. 
The most cherry-pie-reminiscent beer I've smelled or consumed. I've heard the schaerbeekse yield for this year was better than normal, and it's redolent with their sweetness and tartness. Citrus, cherry pits, and a quiet barnyard funk. 
Juicy cherries, raspberry berriness, lots of oak, some earthiness, a nice leaves-you-wanting-more tartness. The cherry really shines through the oak and cobwebby funk. Slightly tannic, with a dry finish that leaves a tiny note of citrus on the the tongue. 
Medium-to-medium-light-bodied with light, but lively carbonation. 
So bright and fresh, this is just as good as (if not better) than 3F's own. The standard for the style. I look forward to seeing how this develops. 969 charactersVerecund, Jan 24, 2011

4.6/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle into Duvel tulip. 2004 vintage, bottled in September 2006.
Appearance: No sludge on cap, and the cork (which smells good) comes out easily, with no subsequent gushing. Free pour yields a half inch, fizzy, light pink head that dissipates quickly into a persistent frothy ring around the glass. Pours an interesting clear orange/pink-tinged red, and leaves short lasting islands of lacing. 
Smell: Huge Brett funk; it's "barnyard" but pleasant, and full of more nuances than I can meaningfully attach to metaphors. Some mildly acetic cherry underneath that gradually moves to the forefront. The smell is full, pungent, and adventurous.
Taste: Starts with a slow onset sourness that fills the entire mouth. At the same time, there's a strong musty funk up front that quickly gives way to sour cherries, culminating in a long, satisfyingly sour finish. The constantly changing aroma enriches the taste, bringing out myriad fruit flavors along with the deep tangy funk. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with perfect, lively but not distracting carbonation. Juicy but never watery in the slightest. Dry finish, but not too dry; the mouth still feels full of tartness with sweet highlights.
Drinkability: Once again, Cantillon delivers a perfect lambic to sip for hours. The flavor is aggressive, but so complex and engaging that I don't tire of it. 
I opened this bottle with high expectations, and got exactly what I was looking for. Easily worth the $22~ I paid for this. 1,480 charactersPahn, Jan 11, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 vintage, poured into a tulip snifter. Love the aesthetics of the bottle!
Pours a sensual, dark purple-and-crimson with about a finger of creamy, cranberry and strawberry-colored head that slowly disipates into a thick ring around the glass. When tilted or swirled, the lacing creeps slowly down the sides, almost like a puree or an ice cream float. One of the most delectable-looking beers I've ever seen.
Smells like tart cherries, with a powerful barnyard funk, a hint of vinegar, wood, and a fair amount of fresh grass in the backend. Refreshing, with an underlying sweetness that prevents the nose from being overwhelmingly sour.
The flavor is dominated by exceptionally sour cherries and undeniable Brett funk. Tannic, vinous grapes; lemons; apples; strawberries; a hint of wood; and fresh grass round it out, mitigating some of the tartness and making for a crisp and refeshing finish. Unlike other krieks I've tried, the flavors in this are very bold and, simultaneously, very well-balanced.
Given the relatively low abv, the beer is pretty full bodied. It's vibrantly carbonated and a pleasure to hold in my mouth.
A fantastic kriek! Very complex, wonderfully refreshing, and incredibly easy to drink. I wish I could perpetually keep bottles of this on hand. The epitome of the style. 1,302 charactersElendinn, Jan 09, 2011

Great funky aroma with underlying notes of lemon, apple, barnyard and cherry. Very good.
Smooth and tart yet complex and balanced. This starts off with a prominent tartness (not sourness) which is accentuated by the Shaerbeek cherries, a moderate funk note also comes through with an underlying sweetness. The finish is tart and dry with a lemony note which really works.
Medium body with some real fullness to it balanced by moderately-high carbonation. Good.
A really solid beer with lots of flavour but true balance. Another well crafted beer from Cantillon. 672 charactersdgilks, Jan 01, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Tasted from bottle purchased at Discount Liquors, Vintage 2005. Pours a cloudy but bright brick red color with an average rose head that recedes to lace. Nose is sour and funky with just a hint of vinegar and lactic acid, some vanilla oak, and a very fresh cherry aroma that also has a hint of sweetness. Most Krieks I have tried smell more like a Kirsch brandy, where the cherries here smell much more fresh. The flavor starts off very sour and acidic, but quickly and seamlessly moves to the oak vanilla and very fresh cherries that throughout seem to give an illusion of sweetness, but I don't think that there is anything sweet to this beer at all. The body is medium with almost sparkling carbonation and a long sour and fresh cherry finish. 746 characterswedgie9, Dec 31, 2010

S-great barnyard funk to this, strong nose of earthy funk and a touch of mushroom. The cherries lie behind the funk accentuating the nose, lightly sour with a touch of acidity. very solid nose but the cherries seem slightly overshadowed.
T-cantillon does such a good job with a very focused funk that plays so well into the beer and adds such a nice balance to it. the cherries are ripe and juicy, the sour is light and pleasant with an ever so light touch of lemony acidity in the finish. well integrated bright flavors that truly show complexity and balance with a level of subtlty that shows a truly solid beer.
M-full bodied and very creamy with a lively carbonation and prickly feel to it. quite dry in the finish with a light lingering tart bitterness.
D-this is another great cantillon beer that has a very concise funk that is centered and balanced. the fruits are so fresh a delicious and the sourness is assertive but not biting. 1,043 characterscpetrone84, Dec 27, 2010
4.41/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a magnificent, clear ruby red with a thick, rocky head that looks like a pillow of cotton candy.
The smell is citrus peel, cherry and fresh berries. The acidic quality manifests on the nose, but there is little to no funk here, just pure lambic goodness.
Mouthfeel is appropriately light with sprightly champagne-style carbonation that brings the tartness straight to your tongue.
The taste mimics the smell. Light raspberry and cherry fruit with a solid, but not overwhelming sourness. The sourness builds appropriately, but never dominates the palate, making this a candidate for pairing with lighter fare like summer salads or fruit-based desert. Insanely drinkable and a classic stepping stone for those looking to get into sours. 743 characterschicagobeerriot, Dec 14, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Combo of two rates, ones from 2007 and one from 2010.
Beautiful blood red with fizzy pink head and lush, full laces. Cherries in the nose are pretty awesome. Full and meaty, not sweet but really capturing the essence of the fruit and not just drying and souring the crap out of it. Mouth worked very well, so much better than a lot of the krieks we consumed that night. Fruit was fully realized but dry, oaky, and expressive. Not medicinal or acidic in the least, which is probably the greatest achievement here. Great stuff and possibly the best cherry beer in the world.
I want to add another rate, early 2011 from a 2007 bottle. Consumed right after a 2010 Cantillon Kriek. Poured a darker shade than the Kriek, quite opaque and deep, like a rich mahogany, with a fluffy, pink cotton candy head. Much more dry than the regular Kriek, rife with a deep cherry pit and funk that were tied together seamlessly. As with most Cantillons it was really tight, dry, and sour. I was thinking "black cherries" the whole time where I didn't really think that from the regular Kriek. I've had several vintages of this, and at different ages, and it's always sublime. One of their best beers consistently I think. 1,204 charactersJAXSON, Dec 05, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On Tap at Eulogy Belgian Tavern for Their Sourfest in a 8oz glass, I had two because it's been a while for me. Review #900, boy how time flys.
I gotta say, this is a very pretty beer, A very pronounced deep shade of red with a somewhat purpulish tint to it towards certain lights. Looks like cherry juice. Up top a pretty in pink cap thats sudsy and foamy and together. It sticks for the whole show but not to the glass.
A funky nose on this sucka, Im greeted by a sour funk mixed in a boatload of cherry aroma. The wood comes out more(than 100% Kriek) from the additional aging in the barrel. Some more barnyard with warming and some leather mixed in with the earth. Cherry cherry bo berry.
And another one.. Yep this is a Cantillon alright, you just know when you taste it, nothing like it in the world. Sour cherry flavor, some black cherry as well. Oak/wood is large but not beating the fruit in this case. Tannic with some accidity as well. Some barnyard and outside earth with a small yeasty taste towards the end, very small though. This is like cherry juice with a kick.
The body is lively and there is a lot of activity, this is certainly not dead beer. A very low bodied beer with a spritzy carb going for it. I find the sour/tart appeal is lower off the spout than in the bottle, and that goes for most Cantillons. This is the 2007 vintage by the way. This remains a very refreshing beer in the mouth.
Well, the verdict is that this is great beer and a treat if your into the style. Easily drinkable. I just wish the sour I get from Cantillon bottles would translate more to the tap versions, although this is a sour sucka, and im a sucka for sours. 1,665 charactersBARFLYB, Nov 28, 2010

Pours a dark cherry red with bright hues slicing through the color. A light bubbly rose pink head eventually fades completely leaving no lacing. 
Scents of tartness, cherries, light fruit sweetness, and a touch of bitter in the nose. 
Puckering sour right up front with some earthy tones. Oak and pleasant cherry flavor swirl. Notes of almost bitter cinnamon with more dark fruit. Some biting citrus zest and rind mix with the clear cherry flavor. Finishes sour and dry with lingering taste and a touch of warmth. 
Lighter bubbly body, dances on the tongue, some dry feel towards the end - very tasty and easy to drink, and the alcohol is masked well. This isn't really a favorite style of mine and I was still really into it - super high quality beer here. 802 charactersxnicknj, Nov 24, 2010

NOSE: loads of lactic sourness; raspberry and cherry; some old oak barrel; moderately expressive to expressive.

TASTE: incredibly sour; cherry pie; quite delicious; not for those who don't like extreme sourness; doesn't taste like it's fading; not funky; fresh; no noticeable alcohol; whomever says not to age these fruited lambics is crazy - I bet this would be silly-good with another 5 to 10 years of age on it. This beer was made using two years-old lambic beers that were aged in used Bordeaux barrels; additionally, 300 grams of cherries per liter were soaked in barrels from Bordeaux; interestingly, raspberry is listed as an ingredient, so I suppose this is technically a kriek/framboise.

Smell is musty, enough that I actually coughed after the first whiff. Mouthwatering lambic tartness and a promising cherry candy sweetness to the aroma. 
Musty, tart and sour, with a deep rooted cherry sweetness that provides another dimension of complexity. 
There is a fullness to the bod and some feeling of stickiness. The carbonation feels as natural as any brew I've had. 
Tasty? Delicious actually. Drinkable? Yes, but only if you are into this type of beer. I could certainly see someone being overwhelmed by the tartness of this one. 719 characterselricorico, Nov 18, 2010

Appearance is like a muddy dark cherry mixed with other fruits, so is the nose - with tons of added funk. Really red. Knows what it is. The taste is tart up front, funky in the finish, and ripe in the middle with sweets - mostly cherry.
It's a light body with a medium feel because of some solid carbonation. I want to drink this instead of finishing leftover Halloween candy and just enjoy the complex concoction.

750ml bottle, 2007 vintage...
This beer pours a hazy cherry red hue, with lots and lots of tight fuzzy candy floss pink head, which fizzes away, leaving nothing in the way of lace. It smells of tart cherry and lemon juice, grainy, powdery vitamins, and barnyard funk. The taste is sour, vinegary cherry, a bit of malty sweetness, some earthy yeast, a slight dry woodiness, with a bit of mild funk bringing up the rear. The carbonation is moderate, the body light, fruity, and acidic. It finishes very dry - slightly woody, and fruity, the tart cherry and lemon notes still pretty strong.
Definitely one of the more balanced lambics from Cantillon - the tartness is present, but not sourpuss inducing, thus it goes down slowly, but steadily. That said, it's still a good beer to have with food, to soften the edge. For me it made an interesting accompaniment to raspberry rhubarb crumble. 1,141 charactersbiboergosum, Oct 19, 2010

A. Pours a deep red velvet with a thoroughly pink creamy head.

4.48/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52007 vintage (bottled in 2009) - I always like to sample fruit lambics on the fresher end of the spectrum before aging them significantly. Poured from a capped and corked 750mL bottle into my Drie Fonteinen tumbler. 
Sangria body, largely clear (with a careful pour), topped by a highly active yet lasting ultra pink (Crayola) head of sizzling micro-foam. Fast runing lacing, returns to the liquid as if on the edge of a whip.
Pungeant yet very well balanced aromatics - aged lambic comes through clearly with dusty penicillin, barnyard scents, and maybe even ant pheremones. Faint cherry notes abound as well, like a crop of them wafting over on the wind.
Very dark cherry notes, fairly sweet but not cloying - with a tartness coming more from the lambic and oak than the fruit itself. Pickled plum (umeboshi) notes and a slight and bright wine vinegar quality come through mid-palate. Subtle grassy/hay-like finish with light tannins from the oak. "Yummy!"
Light bodied, quite well carbonated for the style, and no real astringency. Smooth drinking.
Very high quality fruit, a distinctive varietal seems to be used here (some say Schaerbeekse, but I haven't sampled 3F's namesake yet to compare) - yields a sweeter smoother base (though still 100% natural tasting) than some other krieks, which serves as a nice foil to the artful complexity of the aged lambic. If not the apex of the style, it is certainly among the very best and exudes quality, care, and tradition. 1,475 charactersaugustgarage, Oct 03, 2010

T- the taste is pretty sour. lots of acidic and vinegary notes. a little bit of the oak barrel comes through. the classic cantillon musty/earthy funk comes through stronger than the smell would have indicated. the cherry is all gone at this point.

Pours a glorious dark ruby color with a pink-tinted white head. Tiny rising bubbles visible in the glass. I'm already drooling. Lifting it to the nose I get tart cherries, balsamic vinegar and... vomit. Just a wee bit. A weird funky note of stomach acid. 
Taste-wise, this has quite a bit more cherry flavor than the regular Cantillion Kriek - with the latter, you get the IDEA they were there, whereas with the Lou Pepe they're clearly still around. Big, ripe & sour cherries, with less of the usual green apple and lemon notes. Still very tart. The vomit-y (or perhaps sweaty) note from the nose is present in the taste, but nowhere near as offputting as that sounds. Perhaps I'm just having trouble coming up with an adequate descriptor. Barrel hints of wood, vanilla and coconut come and go as they please, for a split second at a time. A little damp hay underpinning everything. Finish is sour and salty, almost savory. Not the most complex Cantillon I've had, but big bright flavors throughout. 
Quite high carbonation with a clean and very dry finish - positively sucks the moisture from your mouth. You need another sip. NOW! And another. And so on. Wonderful beer. 1,191 charactersParrotshake, Sep 13, 2010

The cork was seeping a little bit but there were no real issues in opening it up. The beer pours hazy and translucent, with deep ruby colors about 1/3 inch of off-pink foam. The aroma is so funky and acidic, with tart cherries and musty basement/barnyard aromatics. It tastes about as highly sour as my senses can register, there could not be a more sour initial taste. Puckering and enamel-etching, and delicious throughout, at least based on my current tastes. The sour flavors don't last in the after-taste, there's more a mix of cherry sweetness and some kind of saltiness. Excellent. The beer is well carbonated, even after 5 years in the bottle, nice body and presence. I'm rating the drinkability high as I love this style of beer, but I could see many people struggling through 1 glass, if you're not familiar with sour ales. 1,020 charactersTurdFurgison, Aug 22, 2010

A - Straight ruby-blood red with a plump and well-retained pink head. No lace left over but that's to be expected with the acidity.

2007 vintage poured into my tulip. The beer is deep strawberry red with a finger of bright pink head that fades leaving a small soapy lace ring.
The aroma is INSANE! Tart cherries with a bit of spice and vanilla. Sour funk is mild but enough to let you know it's present. This reminds me so much of a slice of cherry pie.
The flavor is just as awesome as the nose. Sour yet smooth cherries. The barrel wood is very subtle yet adds to the complexity. A bit of spice and vanilla along with just a hint of funk. Absolute perfection.
Medium to light creamy body. A solid amount of carbonation.
Overall one of the finest beers I've had the chance to try. If not for the price tag I would seriously drink this non stop. Thanks so much for sharing this with me sweem. 933 charactersbeerwolf77, Aug 04, 2010

(A)- Pours a beautiful deep dark ruby red hue that produced a good pink colored head that dissipated to a light layer of foam; some lacing here and there. 
(S)- A dry yet fruity tart cherry aroma with a little bit of hay funk. Very dry, yet fruity tart raspberries in the background too. Great; beautiful aroma of tart fruits and dry funk. Lovely.

(M)- A great; lively carbonation level that lightly fizzes on the tongue. A great sourness that is diverse with the tart fruits at the same time. A light yet present hay/funk dryness throughout the range of the beer too. Pretty much an all around joy/orgasm/party to drink. 
(D)- A fantasticly beautiful lambic. Tart and sour with a great fruit profile. Has a great acidity to it that combines well with everything else. The pinnacle of the style in all areas. I could easily have a whole bottle to myself no problem. 1,127 characterssweemzander, Aug 01, 2010

 A-This beer has a very hazy red body with a strawberry pink foam and a strong carbonation of tiny bubbles.
 S- The aroma is pretty clean, as it was served to cold, but as it opens up the fresh cherry aroma grows and grows. It starts to take on some over ripe cherry notes but it becomes more perfumed bright but dark cherries in the finish.
 T- The full flavor of tart cherries clings to all parts of the mouth. There is a nice light cheese and brett funk in the finish but then the cherries linger afterward. The tartness as some more acidic lactic character as the beer opens up but that only enhances the cherry complexity.
 M- The light mouthfeel has a nice tartness to it but no real lockjaw astringency. Tight carbonation dries out finish nicely. D- This is all about the fruit bit it has great support from the lambic adding nice depth that grows with each sip. Delicious. 913 charactersrhoadsrage, Jul 26, 2010

A - Deep, yet vibrant red coloring with a similar head
S - Amazing, complex cherry notes that just leap out at you. Upon deep inhalations, I get some wheatiness
T - World class. Sweet on the tongue to start with a slightly sour finish. I will compare all krieks from this point onward to the Lou Pepe
M - A gentle swirl elicits a wave of feeling starting with a slight tingle on the tongue moving backward and into the cheeks. However, after swallowing the sensation moves back upward to the front of the mouth....amazing
D - I could be happy drinking little else for the rest of my days 709 charactersebin6, Jun 18, 2010

S - Sour, lot of oak and vinegar wine influence. Get a huge cherry blast at the end. It's actually pretty amazing and unexpected.
T - Very tart, lot of vinegar taste and wine influence from the barrels. The cherry flavour is nicely present. Little tannic in there, with an amazingly dry and lingering finish.
M - Light, with carbonation that gives it a nice little bite and kick. Almost perfect.

2007 Vintage (Bottled in 2009). Poured into a La Chouffe tulip. The beer is a beautiful burgundy with a fantastic dark pink head that's roughly an inch and a half high. 
Ripe cherry flesh greets my olfactory, accompanied by a hint of cherry skin. Oak is subtle, as are tannins, and there's a light tartness. Brett is fairly tame, imparting a light musty quality but allowing the vibrant fruit character to shine. A moderate lactic presence is perceivable. This smells outstanding.
The flavor displays a wonderful balance of oak and tannins, with tart cherry skins and lightly sweet flesh having the most influence. It's reminiscent of cherry pie. There's a lower moderate level of acetic character, tartness is at a moderate level, and lactic sourness is at an upper moderate level. I perceive musty notes, as well as a little barnyard character. The cherries exude quality, and the flavor, though slightly sweet, is pretty dry overall. The finish is a tantalizing amalgamation of oak, vinegar, tannins, and fruit. The beer displays an increased level of acidity in the end. Stunning.
The beer is upper light bodied with a high level of carbonation and a dry, sticky mouthfeel. This is just a fantastic beer, and probably the best Kriek I've ever had. Bravo Cantillon. 1,282 charactersHopHead84, Jun 13, 2010

T: great cherry bang on the palate with vinegar and acidic accents and beautiful sour puckering with oak funky flavors. Great power behind the ingredients on the lou pepe kriek.
M: medium body with light bubbly carbonation that had a fabulous sour dry finish.
D: this beer was very drinkable a bit acidic but had great flavors that lingered on the palate for awhile. Very potent taste and another great beer from the cantillon brewery. 679 charactersGobzilla, Jun 11, 2010

2005 vintage. Pours a nice, hazy, ruby red color with thin puff of pinkish hued head. Scent is of muted tart cherry, mild sweetness and mild funk - very low key. Taste is aggressive tart cherry, hints of graham cracker and sweet cream. Background notes of sourness and oak. Medium bodied, spritzy and dry. An excellent kriek.
Update: Cracked a 2007 vintage on 10/22 and the flavor and tartness of the cherry dominate as the funkiness is much more pronounced. Still a good beer but much better with age. 528 charactersrfgetz, Jun 10, 2010

A: Dark blood red. Nice one finger bubbly pinkish head. Quickly receded to a nice skim and collar. Spotty lacing left in the glass after each sip.
S: Tart and sour cherries hit right from the start, a bit of musty funk and acidic vinegar. 
T: Delicious cherries. Simultaneously sweet, tart and sour. Waves of flavor sensations come at you with each sip. A nice underlying funk, and musty oak -- that quintessential cantillon vibe is definitely here. Some general acidic notes round things out. I am a fan of aged krieks even though they start to lose some of the cherry flavor. This was divine.
M: Medium bodied with good gentle carbonation. Smooth, almost juice like. Quite puckering.
D: I had one glass, and probably could of had a second, but this was a small sip beer for sure. 830 characterscallmemickey, Jun 08, 2010

Pours deep dark ruby with big pink fluffy bubbly head. 
Aroma is dominated by cherry, but has huge grapefruit and lemon along with a little vanilla and a touch of funk.
Great sweet fruit up front and then a fantastic sour cherry finish. I really can't describe it much better than that.
The Lou Pepe Kriek is medium bodied and almost like thick fruit juice, but the great carbonation balances it well. Slight butteriness but always drinkable.
Overall an exceptional beer that I'll be drinking many times in the future and a great example of a kriek. 625 charactersChrisPro, Jun 07, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2007(label) with a cork date of 2009. Poured from a 750ml cork and capped bottle into my tall Allagash chalice/snifter glass. Pours a cranberry red with a very large pink colored head. Head rises to about 3 fingers and has very decent retention. Light fizzy quick sliding lacing. Appearance is hazy.
Aroma is pretty much as to be expected. Funky, tart, citrus, sour currants, oak. Cantillons have such solid aromas behind their beers!
Flavor is wonderful. Not as sweet as some Krieks, especially Lindemans...but very good. Big tartness right off the bat, followed by a carbonated oaky, tart, and currant flavor. This is another beer to be drank at cellar temp. Fridge temps won't do this beer justice as the flavors become blanded as your palate is shocked by the chill. Mouthfeel is light and crisp, carbonated, and finishes dry. Overall a very pleasant kriek style lambic from Cantillon! 899 charactersShadesOfGray, Jun 06, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'll have to check but I believe it was a 2007 bottle. Beer is red and forms a pink head of medium bubbles. No lacing really, carbonation is high and made of small bubbles that rise through the beer quickly. 
Aroma is wonderful. Not as much cherry as the 100% but still pretty good. Classic Cantillon sour aroma with great lactic and slight acetic notes. 
Taste is surprisingly smooth with only subtle cherry flavors. I tried this immediately after the 100% Kriek and if I were to do it again I would reverse the order. The tartness is nice and the lactic character highlights a nice cherry flavor. I wanted it to be stronger overall but this was amazing. I can't wait to try my 2005. Yum.

I've had this again and my reviews were way way too low for this beer. This is probably one of the best sours out there, hands down. 830 charactersdrabmuh, Jun 02, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cantillon products have become a rarity in SoCal these days, so finding this variety at one obscure chain store was a welcoming surprise. 2007 Vintage, on to the beer:
Red violet color, almost looks like fruit juice. The color of the head is almost that of the body, with decent retention. The aroma is on the mellow side, with sweet/tart cherries and lemons going around. The flavor doesn't explode on your palate like some sour/tart, but still, the flavor is great. Slightly sweet from the cherries, mellow tartness, cherry flavor sticking onto the lips, a little oak, some random critters. Overall, it's extremely balanced. It's healthy in the mouth, and be careful drinking it, because you will keep bringing that glass to your mouth, and before you know it, it's empty. 
Although there are a number of ways I could have spent the money on other beers, there's no denying that Lou Pepe Kriek is great. An excellent example of a fruit lambic. 947 charactersDoubleJ, May 27, 2010

A: The pour is blood red in color with a big pink head that dies down to a thin cap.
S: Lots of cherry skins and bugs. A wet straw and musty funk, along with wet oak. Quite a bit of lactic acidity as well.
T: The cherries offer both some sweetness along with a sour note and plenty of tannins (fruit skin flavor as well). The lactic tartness is there, but not quite as overwhelmingly acidic as some lambics. The brett is funky and drying, just the way I like it.
M: The body is medium with a low, rolling carbonation and a nice dry finish.
D: The cherries stand out wonderfully and help to balance out the base lambic, it would seem. Pleasantly sour without being overly so. Well worth the exorbitant cost. 742 characterswomencantsail, May 25, 2010

Pours a deep dark cherry red with a two finger frothy redish pink head that has very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind. Comletely opaque with slightly visible carbonation bubbling up.
Earthy funk aroma with a blast of uber fresh tart dark cherries. It shocking how prevalent the frut still is in the nose. Lots of earthy oak and barnyard horsey funk with hits of bandaid and sweatsock but again the sweet smelling cherries balance things out nicely.
Medium body with lots of tart sour funk and the perfect amount of acidity. Again as in the aroma, the flavor is bursting with luscious tart dark cherries. I can't understand how the frut has held up so well but although this beer is funky as hell the cherries still dominate. We also sampled an 05 Lou Pepe Framboise and it was nowhere near as complex. The fruit was almost completely faded and it was insanely funky. This beer has hints of earthy oak and plenty of sour barnyard funk that balance out the cherries and sugar added but again the cherries are prominent. This beer has developed very well into a delicious, complex lambic and the mouth puckering finish left me salivating for more. Highly recommended! 1,312 characterscorby112, May 17, 2010

This lambic pours a stunningly gorgeous, brilliant ruby color with a beautiful off white head reminiscent of sea foam. No lacing left in the wake, as to be expected, given the style.
The aroma is fantastic. Cherry pie jumps out at you if you get your nose anywhere in the vicinity of the bottle. Classic Cantillon barnyard funk along with hay, straw, wild yeast give the beer a very inviting scent.
The taste is even better than I remember from the previous occasion I drank this beer in 2007. All aspects of the flavor are spot on. The sourness in relation to fresh fruit ratio couldn't be better. This beer has incredible depth and complexity, and is just phenomenal. It is obvious why this barrel was specifically chosen to be a Lou Pepe. 
The feel is incredibly smooth, with a great lingering aftertaste that continues to develop long after each sip.
On a night with many great beers on the table, this was without a doubt the highlight of the evening for me. This is one of my all-time favorite beers. 1,046 charactersHuhzubendah, May 15, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42005 vintage bottled in 2007 consumed in 2010
Cherry-red color with a pink head that fizzes down pretty quickly only to be seen again for the pouring of the second glass.
A bouquet of cherry barnyard, a hint of acetic nail polish remover, and sweaty leather jacket. Dark, acidic, and mysterious.
The taste at first is shockingly sour, even for a sour lover it's in your face. Some grapey, sort of acids akin to certain red wines, astringent hints of leather, and subtle cherries in the finish. Tannins are there, not overwhealming, but noticable. The extreme sourness distracts from some of the complexity it would have and will leave you smacking your lips for a while before you can think about another sip. 
The carbonation and mouthfeel are pretty standard for this style, kind of flat, leaving the acidity to do the work the carbonation would normally do.
Hard to drink in any quanity, the first three or four ounces were great, then my tongue and palate were completely bruised and battered shortly thereafter. Not my favorite cantillon by any stretch of the imagination, wouldn't buy it again at the price it is, but as always, a solid offering. 1,157 charactersbrownbeer, May 07, 2010

I will re-review in a couple weeks when I get another ($30 down the drain) but I believe that this one should be part of my review because a company having a bad product should not go unnoticed.
2006 vintage
Pours a deep red raspberry ish color. No head. No lacing. Looks flat.
Aroma is of Sulphur and cherries. Almost plesent but the sulphur is kinda strong. Smells tart and funky as well.
Tastes just as it smells. Lots of sulphur and funk. Cherries are there but these other flavors are just too much.
Mouthfeel is straight flat. And sort of thin.
Overall I dumped half a bottle ($15 worth) of beer down the drain and me and my buddy choked down the other half. Very dissapointed I paid $30 plus shipping (not sold in So Cal any more for some reason) just for it to suck. Hopefully my St. Lamvinus is better. 870 charactersPeprSprYoFace, May 03, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Burgundy color with an slightly above average sized, bubbly light pink head. About average, maybe slightly below average, retention. Just a slight bit of lacing left on one side.
S - Fairly acidic, vinegar smell along with some cherry tartness. Just a slight cherry sweetness. Hints of charred oak and a muskiness. That said, it is strongly acidic and tart.
T - Initially there is a strong acidic vinegary taste and a pretty strong tart/sour cherry taste. Fairly puckering taste. This gives way to a more funky and musty taste along with a hint of oaky/woody flavor. Then more fruity flavors come out in the middle to the end of the sip. Lots of cherry, still mostly tart/sour but a touch of sweetness, and hints of raspberry and grape like flavors. After drinking it for a while, the tart and acidic flavors go down a bit and the fruitiness comes out a bit more.
M - Medium body with about average carbonation. Fairly creamy and smooth but definitely has a drying and puckering finish to it.
D - Fairly good drinkability. A nice beer to sip on. Sour, tart, and acidic flavors quite prominent but there is a nice fruit taste and slight sweetness on the finish to balance that. Those make it so it is definitely a slow sipper, but an enjoyable one. Especially after it opens up a bit after drinking it for a while.
Notes: 2007 Kriek bottled 2009. Good sour beer from a brewery that knows a thing or two about sours. It was a little more acidic/tart and less fruit than I thought it may be, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Really opened up after drinking it for a while, and the fruit started coming out a bit more. Enjoyable beer to sip, definitely recommend trying this. 1,687 charactersFreshHawk, May 02, 2010

Incredible tartness works the side of the tongue, but the sweetness of the cherries and malt balances this and makes it into something divine. Lots of lemon and citrus zest and some grapefruit. Man, smooth, delicious. In typical Cantillon fashion, complex and very hard to describe. I'll buy one of these whenever I see one. 507 charactersraoulduke37, Apr 17, 2010

Resounding pop upon pulling the cork. Plumskin red with a short-lived carnation pink fizzy head. Somewhat hazy. The nose is of tart cherries, of course, along with an almost medicinally citric sourness. The acidity is pungent, and the aromatic experience is not dissimilar from smelling mentholatum. Much less sour than I expected, but there is a wonderfully full tart cherry flavor. Every bit of the fruit's flavor ended up in the beer, which is a triumph in my book. Some leathery and bitter orange flavors emerge around the edges. Crisp but unobtrusive carbonation, light yet substantial heft, and fairly dry finish that is somewhat muted by the impressive cherry flavor. Not my favorite kriek (I prefer De Ranke time and again), but this is undoubtedly world-class. Great for a breezy mid-April afternoon in New Mexico. 880 charactersorfeu, Apr 14, 2010

Pulled from the fridge, opened, and allowed to breath for twenty minutes before pouring. Pours a medium hazed cranberry with a short lived bright pink head. Certainly looks like a 'girlie' beer, but that's fine. Leaves a small pink ring and miniscule specs of lace. Very pretty beer for sure. 
Nose is sweet malt, dry oak, sweet/sour cherries, vinegar, candied citrus, lemon, cherry gummy candies, faint funk, a small touch of old leather. Strangely clean and soft for a Cantillon Lambic. Some horse as it warms. Very inviting. 
Mmmm. The palette is spot on to the nose. Cherry candies, tart cranberries, black pepper, lemon acidity, cider, balsamic vinegar. A biting sourness on the finish that balances out the dry oak and cherry sweetness. A real light funky note, some barnyard at the end. So many different things going on, it's hard to pick out everything. 
Mouthfeel is surprisingly thicker than expected. Most Lambics I've had are quite dry and borderline astringent, but this has what seems to be a bit of residual fruit sugar. Not heavy by any means, but not the typical bone-dry thing that this style is known for. A heavy carbonation keeps it lively and breaks up the medium body. As it warms it seems to dry (the oak) in the mouth a bit more, bringing it more in line with other Lambics. 
Obviously a beer to be appreciated over the course of an hour or so, allowing all the nuance and depth come through with warmth and air exposure. This is surprisingly easy to drink though, as this style (and particular brewery) is known as a hard to approach and oft misunderstood tipple. I wish I had this all the time, it's like a delicious sour cherry candy, which just happens to be an all time favorite of mine. And thus far, this is my favorite beer to come from the Lembeek region of Belgium. Oh, and the bottle and label are the usual high quality Cantillon affair. Of course. 1,936 charactersFlashsp2, Apr 07, 2010
3.19/5  rDev -29%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I drank this 2007 version from a 750 ml corked bottle into a Lindeman's flute.
This lambic pours a dark blood red, reminds me of sangria. There is tons of carbonation, a 4 finger dark pink head rises quickly with surprsing retention. The lacing is pretty light.
The aroma is quite subdued, especially compared to its sister, the Lou Pepe Framboise. The aroma is pretty much just sour cherries. It is not overly funky or have the typical barnyard funk I'm looking for in a lambic. The sour is more in the form a naturally tart fruit as opposed to mold. Its quite disappointing in his regard. 
The taste is almost equally as boring. The taste is totally dead from start to finish. As you start to swallow you finally get some sourness hit you but its much to late and not balanced at all with any amount of sweetness from the cherries. At the very very end after you swallow you get a little sweet cherry.
The feel is on the lighter, but it does have quite a dry finish that makes you pucker.
The drinkability is high for a lambic because there is no funk that puts you off. However, it is quite bland so why keep drinking.
Overall, I was terribly disappointed. This lambic is severly lacking in so many ways. I believe it gets it lofty rating from those that are more accostomed to a fruit lambic, as a opposed to the try sour lambics that Cantillon is so known for. Maybe, I just got a bad bottle or it needs to age several more years. For now though, I'd advise all true lambic lovers to avoid. 1,501 charactersjrallen34, Mar 08, 2010

Pink head.. hazy reddish/pink brew... 
Nose immediately reminds me of chokecherry syrup... tons of lactic sour with dusty dank basement funk.... 
Bushels of cherries... a fair amount of sweetness that is balanced perfectly by a super sour bomb.. great sweaty horsey funk.. but wow oh wow... sour.. puckering lactic.. very little acetic qualities.. the brett has had a long time to blossom and it is all over the place and lingers with a fruity and very sour finish forever... 
Amazingly balanced... the sweet is honestly just perfect for the amount of perceived acidity... wonderful... Expected sparkling wine like body ... carbonation is a tad less.. 
I need to find some more of these... but christ, pulling the trigger any time soon is not going to happen... I wish Cantillon would make it to Boise more regularly... Thanks again Jeremy, this was a treat.

750ml bottle, corked and capped. 2005 vintage, bottled in 2007. sampled feb 16/2010.
pours slightly hazy deep red. looks almost burgundy from a distance, but shows nice ruby and garnet hues up close. a nice layer of dense pink head forms, quickly dropping to a wide ring around the glass and leaving spotty lace as it falls.
aroma is sour! sour cherry. lemon. malt and cider vinegar. there's some spice to it too, like montmorency cherries or a cherry pie. hint of alcohol. white bread and cracker. bit of straw. light vanilla. raw oak. earth and wood.
taste is great. sour cherry, with a nice cherry spice background. bit of lemon and malt vinegar, but it's far less acidic and vinegary than i expected and am accustomed to with cantillon. straw. white bread. bit of cracker. touch of nutty character. light horse blanket and a bit of leather. hint of vanilla. earthy and a bit woody.
mouthfeel is good. medium-light body with a pretty dry finish. fine medium-high carbonation.
drinkability is good. nicely balanced acidity and sourness. alcohol is almost completely hidden. nice complexity and depth. a really nice kriek. 1,171 charactersgrub, Feb 17, 2010

Pours a hazy dark red, almost purple/maroon, really nice colour, pretty thick light pinkish head forms, settles down to a pretty thick layer around the glass for a lambic, very stick, some lace spots stick, great retention.
Smell is intense, super acidic, tons of tart cherry, wood and a lot of earthy character, lightly fruity, a bit of cracker, vinegar, more cherries, charred wood, pretty crazy and acidic, burns the nostrils.
Taste is crazy, hugely acidic and sour up front, really intense black cherry flavour, charred wood and lemon, wood, very earthy, big sour cherry flavour, fruit pits, lightly nutty, really neat flavour, almost a bit of spice in the finish, not overly acidic in the flavour.
Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, really nice acidity to this one. Not overdone, just awesome character. 921 charactersViggo, Feb 17, 2010

A: Pours an absolutely beautiful rich, dark cherry color with a towering bright pink head that settles into a nice pink ring around the edges of the glass. Perhaps the most beautiful beer I have ever seen.
S: The initial nose is a lovely bright cherry aroma with a little bit of sweetness followed by a wonderful tartness. A little bit of acid in the nose, but it appears as if most of this character is coming from the cherries. 
T: Tart cherries and a bit of a puckering feeling as a result. A nice, crisp acidity comes through, and it goes down really smoothly. Cherries are absolutely the dominant flavor without much else coming through. Perfect balance between the sweetness and tartness within the cherries, especially alongside the slight acidity that comes through as well.
M: Light to medium-bodied with just the right touch of carbonation. Very elegantly balanced.
D: Supremely drinkable. This is one I would love to quaff back all day long. 1,016 charactersThorpe429, Feb 17, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I currently have the remainder of the bottle in my glass as I type this. Huge thanks to Matt for bringing over this special treat, which we enjoyed alongside a 2004 Fou Foune and a 2005 Lou Pepe Framboise. This vintage is from 2006.
The pour produces a strawberry body and a small wispy white head hat soon dies to nothing. More or less standard lambic, and in particular, kriek, appearance. The aroma is sharp and funky. There's definitely some vinegar in there, alongside some tart cherries, and a nice old sour barrel.
The tartness hits from the first sip, though this is not quite as sharp as the other Cantillon beers we had tonight, and there's a nice dose of residual sweetness. So, yeah... lots of sourness at first, moving on to a large funkiness, some oak, and then settling into a tart, but slightly, sweet cherry character. Quite complex, and very pleasing. Light body, with a slight sticky slickness to it, and very limited carbonation. Its practically perfect.
I liked this one - the lou pepe series obviously delivers, though I'm not sure the added price brings a lot more to the table. Between this and the framboise, the kriek is definitely the winner. Thanks again Matt! 1,191 charactersbobsy, Feb 01, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52006 Vintage bottle that I scored about a year ago and kept in the cellar ever since. Served chilled and poured into a snifter, this one was consumed on 01/22/2010.
The pour was about what I would expect given the age on it. Dark reddish color with minimal head and lacing, nothing really to write home about, but given the style a good representation of what to expect. Aroma is sour as all hell. Acidic with notes of tart cherries and wood that are buried underneath a wall of sour yeast. As I take the first sip I am slammed back into the chair with tons of barnyard funk. Loads of lip puckering tartness that rip at the taste buds before settling in and the lovely cherries come forward to show their might. A touch of sweetness is still left in here, but you need to look for it. Smooth, even body and a wonderful finish leave this one fresh on the palate and literally made me salivate looking for more.
One of the best offerings they have hands down and with a little age on it really shines. 1,001 charactersmikesgroove, Jan 24, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 vintage, bottled Aug 2009 and poured into Cantillon tulip.
Immediate deep pink head of foam on first pour which soon settled down to a ring of lace. 
I drank this young as I enjoy the notably higher fruit profile of the younger Cantillon lambics (as I had done with the 2009 Fou Foune and Blabaer and Zwanze... all delightful) 
The sour cherry flavour of this master-kriek almost has a creaminess to it which is wonderful and sets it apart from the regular kriek, although there is additionally a light spritzy mouthfeel which just adds to the drinkability. This did not seem mouth puckeringly sour to me, but I am sure most of my friends would still be wincing, even though I'd insist that the lambic sourness did not dominate the fruitiness. 
Drinakbility ... ridiculously high... like all the Cantillon's I have tasted. I am looking forward to my next visit to rue Gheude! 882 charactersHabanero58, Jan 23, 2010

Poured from the tulip into my gaping maw.
Drinkability this high is a bad thing. I like beer I can drink slowly and savor. Lambics are a fine example as their acidity forces me to prolong my enjoyment. In this sense, most Cantillon products border on the Tantric.
But fresh LP Kriek is far and away the smoothest Cantillon I've had. So fast was I guzzling it that I had barely enough time to observe its attributes.
I managed to catch a few of them as they flew by: cherries, oak, cherries, funk, and cherries. I can confirm that this was a kriek. 652 charactersalfrantzell, Jan 21, 2010

Pours a slightly hazy deep red color with a medium-sized white head and great lacing.
Aroma is intense tart cherries and barnyard funk. You can feel the acid burning your nostrils, and it's great.
Flavor is super-sour and acidic, but amazing. Loads of tart cherries, cherry Jolly Ranchers, funk, and lacto/pedio/other wild bug tartness. Brutal, but awesome.
Medium bodied with very high acidity and lively carbonation. The sourness stays with you for awhile on this one.
Drinkability is pretty good for a beer this sour. Overall another great one from Cantillon. 708 charactersnickd717, Jan 11, 2010

2002 vintage. Pours reddish brown with white head. Aroma is very sour, with wood, cherry, funk and vinegar all playing a part. Very complex and inviting. The flavor is very sour cherry with wood and barnyard funk also in there. This is one of the most tart beers I have had, but it is immensely drinkable. This is a beer I hope I get to try again. 376 charactersMora2000, Dec 30, 2009

Taste is strong, rich cherry, very impressive after 5 years. Mineral spritz, some funk, but not very sour. Very nice fruit though. 
Mouthfeel is dry and slick, medium light bodied. 
Drinkability is very good for a pure fruit beer, the sourness can stand to be amped up for my taste, but the cherry really shines, without being syrupy sweet. 527 charactersccrida, Dec 28, 2009

Aroma of naturally sweet and tart cherry is quite wonderful. Taste is also dominated by loads of lightly sweet and fresh cherries with some tart notes and a funky aftertaste. Acidity is very well balanced which is a bit surprising considering the base beer. World classic for sure and something I would drink more often is it was cheaper and more easily available. 477 charactersPhyl21ca, Dec 27, 2009

Pours completely flat with no carbonation. Glowing burgandy/ dark maroon in color. No lacing.
A sour cherry nose that has taken on a strong oak presence from the the barrels it was aged in. Red grape tones give it a vinous quality and the aging has given it a bit of musky funk as well.
Wow the first sip is sensory overload. Puckering and very sour. As I dig more into the lambic, I become more accustomed to the sourness and the aged wood and funk become more tangible.
Extremely dry and astringent. More so than any wine I've tasted to date. Lighter bodied and void of carbonation.
This really is something special and was a treat to have. It really pushes the boundaries of beer which I truly respect. Obviously at this price point, it is to be enjoyed on rare occasion. 931 charactersibbjamin, Dec 19, 2009

A - Pours a dark purple, looks like Barney's blood, with a light purple head that doesn't stick around long at all. There's pretty much zero head and no retention to speak of, along with no lacing, just a dark purple liquid.
S - Lots of fruit notes, some sweet, some sour. Cherries, grapes, raspberries, oak. Overall, cherries, lots an lots of sweet and sour cherries. 
T - Really strong tart and funk notes right off the bat. Cherries, oak, sour grapes. Pretty straight forward here...I don't mind that at all. Horse blanket, funk, funk and funk.

D - If you're in the mood for a wild and want a bunch of cherry notes, this is your beer. Very good, will purchase again. 806 charactersSean9689, Nov 26, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Drank on-tap at Lord Hobo, Cambridge, MA
Served in a Cantillon tumbler
2007 vintage
The beer poured a hazy yet brilliant burgundy color with pink highlights. A tiny cap of light pink froth quickly settled to a thin ring of lace.
The aroma was an amazing balance of both sweet and tart. Strong notes of sour cherries were nicely countered by a moderate oaky, earthiness. Fruity (lemony) and zippy. Slightly funky.
The taste was terrific and quite similar to the aroma in many regards. Lemony and slightly acidic up front. Notes of earth and funk came through in the center. Sour cherries made their appearance here as well. The clean, crisp finish was lemony and quite sour. A faint herbal hoppiness was also detectable.
The mouthfeel was outstanding. This beer was fuller bodied for the style with a very fine yet lively effervescence. The liquid was silky smooth and pillowy and it covered my tongue like a blanket.
Drinkability was terrific. This beer was both flavorful and refreshing. While many of the better lambics overwhelm the palate with intense tartness and funk, this one impresses with its grace and finesse.
The key word in describing this beer is "balance." Cantillon Lou Pepe Kriek walks the line between fruity and funky like few others do. This is a world-class fruit lambic and one that I will definitely be visiting again. 1,348 charactersDamian, Nov 20, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Chilled bottle into a glass. 2007 vintage (with 2009 crop) purchased at the brewery and shared with some friends in London. The brewer remarked that he personally felt this year's fruit batch was amazing, so I was looking forward to this. 
A: Pours a hazy reddish-magenta color in the glass, adorned by a light reddish-pink froth that vanishes as quickly as it appears (expected for the style). It remains in the form of a hint of bubbles on top of the brew, with a thin halo and active carbonation up the glass. 
S: Like smelling cherry pie, on the first whiff: cherry, cinnamon, bread. But it gets woodsy and foresty as I explore the bouquet, and finally I detect the telltale brett aromas of horse blanket and funk. 
T: Liquid cherry pie, although with a twist as it is composed of sour cherries. The tartness commands attention at first, but it lessens its grip as the flavor progresses into a palette of grassy, funky / musty / hay flavors. The finish is lightly tannic and semi-dry. 
M: Light-bodied, lively carbonation. As mentioned above, this is semi-dry, but not nearly as dry as the austere Lou Pepe Framboise. We felt this was a better finish in that regard. 
D: My second favorite of the Lou Pepes that we tried, and the better of the two fruit varieties. I'd love to have this again. 1,302 charactersArbitrator, Nov 10, 2009

Smell: Tart, sour cherries, french oak, leather, bit of barnyard funk
Taste: Perfectly acidic. Nice mix of tart cherries, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, wood, leather and funk.
Mouthfeel: Tannins seem to give it a nice mouthfeel, not a bit of sticky sweetness.
Drinkability: 750ml isn't enough, high price but absolutely worth it.
NB - In my mind, this is second only to Blabaer for fruit beers. 550 characterscraytonic, Oct 05, 2009

I loved their regular kriek when I had it, but this just takes it to another level of sour-cherry-amazingness. Opaque red in color with a small head. Awesomely funky sour lambic nose with lots of tart cherries. There is a lot of cherry on the flavor as well, but very dry and sour in the mix. Very lactic and citric in the tartness, but very rounded into the cherry. Light and spritzy mouthfeel. I need to get the rest of the Lou Pepe lineup now... 545 charactersbulletrain76, Sep 25, 2009

Pours dark amber/red with a small redish white head. Not as lively as I had expcted, but a Good looking beer none the less.
Smells of cherries and citrus tartness. There isn't much else there... maybe some malt notes, but it's all dominated by the tart fruit aroma. I love it.
Sweet pucker, it tastes sharp, sour and mildly fruity. The cherries come through very well and the clean Cantillon sourness is outstanding. Great beer. It could be a little more drinkable, maybe if there were more carbonation it would lighten it up a bit, not sure, but half a glass was enough for me. 610 charactersTheEremite, Sep 13, 2009
4.02/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5well, what can you expect from a Cantillon beer? Their definite signature... of course! It's stinks, but we like it!!!
Beautiful colour. Ruby red, translucide without any yeast suspension. This is quite surprising. Nose is typical of cantillon. It smells bad, like dirty sweaty feet! Definitely Cantillon yeast signature. Carbonation is low, almost no head when poured. Sweetness from the fruit is nearly absent and fruitiness is low too! This is certainly due to the high acidity of this beer. For having tasted the regular Kriek and the Lou Pepe kriek to far apart, I cannot tell major differences between the two. This is to bad because I'm sure their are notable differences...
This is a very good traditional Kriek. Don't expect to drink something sweet as the Lindemans... For aficionados only! 802 charactersblaje, Sep 09, 2009

Pours a dark ruby, or cranberry juice, color with a fizzy quarter inch of foam.
Theses beers always bring a tear to my eyes...Wonderful aroma. Cheesy, hay, sour and dried cherries, leather, lemon, oak, vanilla, and red grapes. Complex, yet very well blended and crafted beer.
Some leathery flavors upfront with some sweet and tart cherries in the middle, cheesy in the finish. On second sip I get some lemons, tangy wheat, and musty flavors. Nice dryness in the finish with just a touch of tart cherry juice sweetness. Later on I get a taste similar to salty apricots, vanilla, mellow oak flavors, deep cherry pit, and green apples. Medium acidity and not too harsh on the stomach, quite easy to drink. Fizzy and effervescent on the palate.
What a wonderful beer. 962 charactersseaoflament, Jul 15, 2009

A - Pours deep blood-red into a wine glass. Very little head, looks almost flat. Upon further inspection, there are *some* bubbles. Thank god. 
S - Aromatics are predominantly of sweet wild cherry and grass, kind of flowery, a light perfume. Doesn't really smell very funky or woody. It actually smells rather fresh and pastoral rather than dank and barrel-aged. I swear it almost smells a *little* hoppy.
T - Now this, this is one sour beer. Cherries are dominant, but we're talking fully fermented cherry here, absolute zero residual sugar. Frankly, I think there's more sweetness in a bottle of lime juice. Acidic as all hell, mouth-puckeringly acidic and uncompromisingly dry. Complexities really pull through given the dryness - here are the tannic and vanilla notes from the oak barrels as well as some cured leather and a little goosey funk. Masterful. 
F - I was afraid this would be too flat, but given the level of sourness this seems just right. Not really as flat as it looks, with lots of soft bubbles. 
D - This is one you either sit down by yourself with and savor while you listen to darkwave, or share with other sour-lovers. I wouldn't go bringing this to the BBQ or tailgate party, that's for sure. Quite a massive, refined beer, packed full of flavor and personality. The Dos Equis guy doesn't really drink Dos Equis when he chooses to drink beer, he drinks Lou Pepe Kriek. 1,444 charactersPatrick999, Jun 18, 2009

Pours a very nice pink with some white bubbling. Reddish hues in the center. Actually, quite a gorgeous beer.
Smells faintly of sour cherries, but mostly of vinegar and acidic lemon. Taste is a bracing assault of sour wood, lemon, some biting unripe apple, and a citrus zest. Very good, but not superlative, and the unrelenting sourness does get a bit one note after a while (as compared to, for example, Consecration).
Nice lively mouthfeel, and this is certainly a very good beer. 554 charactersOverlord, May 09, 2009

this stuff is a little scary under the cap... brownish gray stuff resides just under it. once it's popped, brownish liquid bubbles up around the spongy cork... gross... but awesome, i'm pumped.
pours a very dark ruby, actually garnet red. there is a small pink head, that fades to a white ring. i'm surprised these's anything quite frankly.
the aroma is a vinegar-y barnyard of aromas. hay, horse blanket, sulfer, a touch of feet. there is also a medicinal cherry in the mix, almost jolly rancher-like.
the taste is tart but remarkably smooth. the aging seems to have ironed out any harshness or rough edges. the fruit really comes through, with a rich black cherry and lemon, like cherry lemonade. juicy and delicious. maybe just a bit of oak in there.
this beer is actually mildly carbonated, with soft delicate bubbles in a medium body.
the drinkability is very good for this type of beer, it's sour, smooth, and refreshing. one of the best sour beers i've had the privilege of tasting. 1,005 characterskmo1030, Apr 24, 2009
3.93/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5750mL bottle 2001 vintage poured into a tulip.
Pours a hazy cherry red with brown hints and a big fluffy pink head that stays on as a cap for the duration.
The aroma is initially funky but as it warms the cherries come out a little bit more, more tart than sweet, but definitely there. There is a bit of sugary sweetness in there as well but the funk and acidic vinegar is pretty strong.
The taste has the same acidic funkiness as the aroma with a combined tartness from the cherries up front that puckers the lips from the outset. After the initial kick, the sugary sweetness of the cherries makes an appearance along with a bit of brown sugar. But the finish brings back the sourness and funk.
The mouthfeel is dry and puckering with good carbonation and medium bodied.
Once again, Cantillon has produced a beer that I enjoy but has really kicked up the vinegar sourness to point that it takes over the cherry presence. Still, very good. 944 charactersgford217, Apr 19, 2009

Smells of acid, cherry, lemon; and almond.
Strong acidity. Lemon, cherry, vanilla and more lemon. Awesome.
Mouthfeel is so tart and in your face, smooth yet prickly. I love this beer.

Aroma really sings with sour cherries, rich and tart, a bit dry. Sharp vinegar comes through as well. 
Taste is sour cherry from the beginning, dry and tart, the sharpness balanced by the very full cherry note, balanced and delicious. Because of the balance, one of the most drinkable Cantillons I've had. Superb. 458 charactersJohnQVegas, Mar 15, 2009

A: Pours a cloudy cherry red color. A one finger pinkish head forms and leaves light lace.

T: Sweet and sour cherries that are more pronounced than in the nose. Definitely sour, but not mouth puckering at all. A very interesting spicy cinnamon and woody/oak flavor that brings everything together perfectly. Slightly acidic.

A: Deep red under a quickly lost pink head. No lace, very little retention.
S: Cherries and some woodiness. Bit of a wild funk character, sort of meaty. Bit of mixed fruit as well.
T: Not as sour as expected (not to say that it isn't sour, just not as much as the framboise). Cherry is there with a very fresh, slightly syrup like taste. Very good. Bit of wood and slight funky character. Overall, this one seems a bit more balanced then the framboise version. Not too heavy on the sour, lets some of the other flavors shine through.
M/D: Light bodied, carbonation is heavy but not very puckering sour. Drinkability is nice. Excellent beer. 725 charactersNCSUdo, Nov 29, 2008

D: Fairly straight forward. Perhaps wouldn't pick it up at the store, personally, but a decent brew. 533 charactersProteus93, Sep 29, 2008
3.92/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle courtesy of dkachur, split threeways at a tasting - thanks! Poured into a wine glass.
Appearance: Incredibly hazy reddish/purple-bodied beer with a nice foamy one-finger head that fades quickly, leaving trails of lacing around the edges of the glass.
Aroma: Major earthy horseblanket, farmhouse musk, and dirty yeastiness. Next up is, obviously, the cherry - sour cherry dominates, but there are a few sweet, sugary, simple cherry notes as well. Some saltiness, woodyness, fresh cut hay/grassyness all mingle well. 
Taste: Pretty puckertastic. Tart acidic quality dominates and covers up a lot of the other notes - sweet cherry, leafy herbalness, a few earthy, woody notes. Doesn't taste nearly as complex or pleasant as it smells. Very dry.
Mouthfeel: Dry, spritzy, crisp, good level of thickness. Minimal carbonation, which is nice.
Drinkability: I liked the smell on this one a lot more than the taste - it was just a little too tart for me. The smell was fantastically complex though, and since the alcohol is hardly a factor at all, I can't knock the drinkability on this one too much. All in all a decent beer. 1,128 charactersCrellMoset, Sep 24, 2008

A-Deep pinkish tinged red with a thin pinkish head...is this beer?
S-Kinda like those magic markers you used back in grade school. You can can actually smell the tartness!
T-Crack-a-lacky...BAM! This is beyond tart. Like a sour cherry bomb with a bit of residual sweetness. You had best like tart for this one.

750 ml. bottle: poured into a flute.
Appearance: Pours out a hazy kool aid red/purple color. Head is a small, frothy off-white cap with a very appearant red hue. Great head retention.
Odor: Ripe sour cherries, metallic and earthy yeast funk is strong and unmistakable.
Consistency: It's hard to pin a body type on this beer because there's so many other things going on. Between the extreme puckering tartness, moderate carbonation and funky yeast flavors, it comes off as having a firm, medium body. Very dry.
Taste: Puckering cherry tartness hits you first and sticks around. Flavors begin very juicy and vibrant then shift gears into dry, tart territory, almost as if the beer has evaporated. Finish is relatively clean despite the leftover sensation of dryness, leaving a bit of lingering funk & acidity.
Like many, I was introduced to this style with a bottle of Lindeman's Kriek, so this was somewhat of a rude awakening. This is a one of kind beer. 1,025 charactersWalken, Sep 11, 2008

A - Opaque ruby-colored body wth one-finger pink head that diminished into a thin ring of retention and left minimal lacing. 
S - Wow! Really strong sour nose with plenty of funky Brett and a hint of vanilla. There is also a paint thinner or magic marker character to the aroma. 
T - This is the most sour concoction I've ever tasted. This packs a huge cherry flavor with some vanilla. This is seriously one tart, sour brew with somewhat of a chemical flavor, yet I kept coming back for more!
M - Light to medium body with poppy carbonation and a prickly mouthfeel. Pretty thin and watery, though. Ridiculously sour and acidic on the palate. This will definitely make you pucker up!
D - Man, this is one sour beer that tastes more alcoholic than it probably is. This goes quite well with chocolate, which complements its intense tartness.

4.73/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5For my 1000th review, I thought I would review a beer from one of my favorite breweries, Cantillon. There are all sots of extreme beers out there, but in a way none are more extreme than those from this brewer. Most have modest amounts of alcohol, but they are packed with flavor while displaying subtle nuances of tastes and sometimes are challenging in the directions they take. People applaud, and rightly so, the sour beers of Russian River, Lost Abbey, and Jolly Pumpkin, among others. As great as those beers are, I think the beers of his brewery are just as good, surprisingly more available, and woefully underappreciated by many BAs. The Lou Pepe series of beers are masterpieces, and the history and tradition, and sheer difficulty of craft that is evident in every bottle makes them something special. Of the lambics, kriek has always been my favorite. I love the winey depth of the cherries, the startling burst of rich sourness, and the faint hint of almond from the pits. I really love this particular kriek and I wish more people who are serious about beer would try a bottle and review it. It's worth the cost.
This beer pours a a beautiful ruby red, and it's a bit hazy. There is a nice light pink head that sticks around and leaves some lacing. There are beautifully melded aromas of sour cherry, spice, oak, some light funkiness, and some acetic qualities. The taste is an explosion of vibrant sour cherry, a nice zingy acetic sourness, spicy oak, and a tart finish. Not particularly funky, but there is a slight hint of ripe cheese in the depth of this beer. Very complex and deep. The mouthfeel is slightly tannic and quite smooth. The tannins lend a refreshing break from the onslaught of fruit and sourness and give some nice backbone to the body. Utterly delicious. This is not my absolutely top-rated beer, but it is high in the pantheon. An absolutely oustanding kriek. 1,896 charactersGeorgiabeer, Aug 11, 2008

A- Pours with a really nice clear bright red and a pink head that fades really fast. 
S- You can smell some real funky smells from the yeast that are pretty pungent yet a bit restrained. Ultimately the stinky aroma gives way to a really nice sour cherry smell.
T- Quite sour, moreso than I expected. The cherry is there the entire time and develops into a really concentrated sour cherry taste (though there is some sweetness at the same time). Cherry tastes real concentrated compared to other sour cherry beers.
M- About normal for this kind of beer.
D- As good as it was on the senses this beer was too acidic for me. I haven't really experienced anything that was too acidic since my very first sour beer and thought I had just gotten use to it, but this really burns (the 2 other people I was drinking it with said they felt throat and esophageal burning from it also). So just a bit on the acidic side but that is to be expected somewhat. Still really nice, a good beer to enjoy a glass of, though I don't know if I could take more. 1,056 charactersMiScusi, Jul 29, 2008

Well blended cherry in the taste, a nice mix of sweet and sour flavors, with a decent bit of funk and a hint of cinnamon spice in the background. The sourness approaches a moderate intensity. Lightly drying. Solid mouthfeel, good for the style. 
Overall an enjoyable lambic experience. The age has mellowed it well, so it's not overpowering. Very easy to drink but doesn't have the extreme tart bite I was looking for. Recommended... 620 charactersbennetj17, Jul 15, 2008

Pours with a pink froth that dies rapidly. Has a pretty red color.
Smells of cherries, sourness, funk, a bit acidic and more cherries.
Wow, the first sip was good the second made my mouth pucker I love it. All I taste is cherries and a tart acidic sourness. Definitely worth the money. 495 charactersirishkyle21, May 09, 2008

Poured an translucent and hazy red with a large foamy pink head.
The aroma was bursting with tart cherries, brettanomyces barnyard funk and lactic acid.
The flavor was intensely tart and acidic. The fruit flavors wer very rich a full. Mad cherries tell ya. The beer had a clean biscuity and wheaty malt backbone (very subtle, but nice).
The carbonation was spritzy the mouthfeel was light and crisp.
This beer was incredibly refreshing, as are all Cantillons, and extremely drinkable.
Probably the best kriekbier I've had. 542 charactersSacoDeToro, Mar 13, 2008

A: Served a cloudy dark ruby red. Almost like cranberry juice. Slight whisp of a head that disappeared almost immediately. Just a tiny pink ring.
S: Incredible sour fruit aroma. Plenty of funk, wood, leather belt (?), musty basement. 
T: Acidic sour cherry mixed with the aforementioned musty funkiness. Lots of oak.
M: Tart and puckery. Very dry. There is a lively spicyness to the mouthfeel that also makes this so interesting.
D: So refreshing. Once the initial real lambic shock wears off after 1 or 2 sips the underlying complexities of this jump out of the glass. Temperature is the key. Perhaps Map Room's draft lines were just wee to cold when they served this. After enjoying this for about 30min I noticed that as it got closer to room temp, the acidity dialed itself down a few notches and a subtle sweetness began to emerge. Incredible. 938 charactersGbVDave, Feb 24, 2008

Cap is grey underneath, cork is wet, and also turning grey. Something about musty old lambics is very appealing, though the reason is hard to pin down. The tiniest "pop" is heard once the cork is extracted. Wisps of smoke appear, and the crimson liquid pours with a suprising amount of crackling pink foam. 
Honey, hay, fermenting black cherries, exquisite natural aromas. 
Wild funky yeast gives off the prerequisite waft of horseblanket.
Tangy sour cherry at the tail end and into the long dry finish. Otherwise, fairly mellow and woody. It comes together well, without the brashness of a young lambic, it lets the subtleties really shine. Rich Schaerbeek cherry intensity, almost like cherry pie, with the complexity of cherry skins and pits thrown in too. Long, dry finish that has sublime aged wood and sour fruit flavors. Residual lemony sourness on the lips. Honey in the aftertaste, with a hint of clover. One to savor, and not on an empty stomach! 1,013 charactersemerge077, Jan 19, 2008

Pours an extremely slightly hazed garnet color with a pink head that doesnt stick around. Smells like when you have a band-aid on and it gets really wet and you dont take it off for a while, but when you do, your skin smells funny. Antiseptic smell. Also a fair amount of fruit and a very mild yeast influence. Flavor is of the best aged lambics. Mildly funky at first with a typical sour punch in the mouth that isn't overly powerful. Definite wood influence on the palate. Calmly there, but not overpowering at all. Feel is typical. Not a ton of bubble, but a little bit. Extremely drinkable. In my limited experience with lambics, this is by far the best I have had. And rightly so for $21 a bottle. If you see it, try it. Worth the money IMO. Bloody marvelous. 826 charactersRblWthACoz, Dec 30, 2007

Vivid, exciting bright real red fresh cherry juice vibrance, alive with dripping moisture and a wildness of the pits. Florid and bright vermillion, with a rose fringe and blush head. Flavor is a sweet, chirping acidity in the note of perfected aged cherry alcohols, fresh flesh and pining pits. Amazing balance derived singularly from the fruit.

4.68/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap a few days ago at the Publick House. I side by sided this with a bottle of standard Cantillon Kriek for comparison. This Kriek had far more fruit flavor and a bit more sourness, as well as other complexities that just aren't in the standard Cantillon Kriek. This isn't to say that the regular Kriek was bad or mediocre, but this one really shined and made the regular Kriek seem (at the time!) flat and dull by comparison. Also, it was cloudier than the regular Kriek.
Too bad this beer has been retired, though I currently wouldn't really have much trouble getting it at Charles Street Liquors... 609 charactersEmilNoldSinclair, Mar 26, 2007

This is a jewel of a beer. The pour brings an inviting and intense ruby-red color that is largely opaque. A pink-ish dainty head rises just off of the surface but just as quickly falls.
The usual intense tart and souring aromas without becomming overly musky or horse blanket-like. Strong cherry aromas are supported further with berries, apples, and a red wine vineousness. 
Tastes are sweet and tart with the cherries with a well rounded malt sweetness and sour complexity. Almost vinegar-like. The feel is a light but smooth texture, nearly too thin. Finishes with a light tartness that intensifies and lingers indefinately. 
This is a great thirst quencher and a very complex brew. A firmer body would score a near perfect 5.
Thanks Cheezdawg! 789 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 03, 2007

Nice red color with a pink-ish head that dissipated leaving only a ring around the glass. Smell was certainly sour, had some barnyard funk and very tart cherries; I have not seemed to care for other beers with some of these characteristics, but this one is very nice. Taste is much of the same, but its just put together so well that I can't help but love it. Light bodied, but thankfully not bone dry; carbonation was light-medium. This was definitely a joy to drink, I think I'll be searching out more Cantillon; hopefully they can match up with this one. 576 charactersbadbeer, Dec 18, 2006

The appearance is very nice with a very dark red color that has a pinkish lacing. The smell is sour with horse blanket and cherries in the backround. The taste is a sour kick, but in a good way. The cherries are in the backround of a real lambic flavor with the horse blanket making a big impression on the palate. I can say it's the best lambic I have ever had. The mouthfeel is very good, full bodied. Overall this is a great beer and will get more. 476 charactersErdinger2003, Dec 16, 2006
4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured on tap at O'Brian's into a tulip
Pours a bright red with a small pink head that lingers for quite a while. The beer has wonder champagne feel to it with the many tiny bubbles circulating in the beer.
The nose was everything you would expect from a wild beer. Sourness with a slight barnyard to it. You definitely pick up on the cherries, but more of an unripe, slightly tart cherry. Beautiful, couldn't wait to taste.
Ahhh the taste. Reminds me of sucking on some sour candy when I was a kid. Makes the mouth pucker with tart delight. The sourness subsides leaving beautiful sweet cherry taste. Ah, the joys of Brett, pediococcus
and lactobacillus at work.
Mouthfeel is tingly from carbonation but you can't help but mention again the mouth puckering sensation when discussing mouthfeel.
Now of course this beer will turn many people off. If you respect the true style of lambics, this beer is a grand example of one of the most truly unique styles known to brewing. In my opinion Cantillon rules the lambics. At least the many I've had. For my wedding night we opened a bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise that was amazing, but I wish I had the Kriek. Thankfully I have a bottle sitting in my cellar now. 1,223 charactersCallenak, Dec 13, 2006

Pours a dark murky red with small pinish head. Large amount of tight carbonation throughout drinking.
Smell: Light cherry smell. Strong musty, brett yeast smell with some citrus. Just smell sour/tart.
Taste: Definite brett yeast taste with tart cherry. The cherry is not overpowering. Very dry musty wine like flavor. Overall pleasing tartness more than sourness. I can't quite describe it; it is complex in the taste, but it is so well balanced altoghether it doesn't seem complex.
Light bodied with lots of carbonation without being stinging. Very dry in the mouthfeel without being astringent. Clean feeling and refreshing. 
A true joy to drink if this style is your bag. A great beer to enjoy, but 1 or 2 will do just fine. 767 characterslaintringulis, Nov 07, 2006

Appearance: This beer is a very pleasing ruby coloration. The beer has light carbonation. This beer has no head to speak about.
Smell : This beer is a soup of citrus and brett yeasty funkyness. The beer has a fairly sharp acidic smell; however, the smell never gets over powering or offensive. The beer has a bit of sour cherries layered amongst the funk.
Taste: This beer is very layered. The sourness of the cherries and yeasty bret funkyness comes in pleasing waves. 
Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is light bodied but never watery. The beer has light carbonation. The flavors are very layered. This beer is not for everyone. The beer has a fairly large sourness and acidity. I on the other hand enjoyed this beer from the begining until it disappeared. 841 charactersnlmartin, Sep 17, 2006

It pours a rich dark red with a foamy head that disappears quickly. The aroma is of tart sour cherries, malt, horse-blanket funk, and sugar. The taste is incredibly sour, and yet the strange yeast flavors push their way past the sourness, it almost taste as if something went wrong, yet you know that everything is right. The finish is very dry and the palette is left feeling clean. A strange and yet very drinkable beer, at least for those who like something very sour and complex. 551 characterschaduvel, Aug 11, 2006

Smelled like cherries, not sweet cherries, but cherries nonetheless, great fruit aroma, followed by a tart note
Taste is very sour and tart, as if they somehow removed all the sugar from this beer. Very dry, cuts right through the palate, but the cherry makes is enjoyable.
Mouthfeel is good, but the acidity shows through.
A great beer to taste and enjoy in small portions, an unusually complex beer, comparable to a good dry wine. Good onya Cantillon. 533 charactersstoner420, Aug 03, 2006

1999 Vintage, aged in good shape for 7 some odd years! Wow! Poured a beautiful ruby colour, thinly vieled with a soft pink head that circled the trim. A really beautiful - perfect - appearence. A pungeant funk aroma. Not fruity - certainly gueuzey though. Surprisingly not much fruit in the taste either. I might not have guessed this is a kriek. Perhaps the fruit aspect has softened with the time its been aged ? Whatever the case any fruit notes are certainly faded (at best!) That however, would be the only thing I could hold against this beer. This is a sipper, only if you can resist the urge I had to keep going back for more. More of a "puckerer" than a "sipper". You lick your lips and it's like you just ate a ton of sour candy. Leaves that sugary residue in the mouth/on the lips. So sour - it's fantastic. This actually has become like a crazy rose wine in many ways. That may be the msot accurate way to describe it. It really burns a hole in the of the mouth. Kinda burns! And this is at 7 years old - again, fantastic. Very tart. I could have used more flavour but the whole experience of the mouthfeel is nothing short of incredible. Be happy to finish off with the sediment - wow. Thanks again Sammy. 1,264 charactersbiegaman, May 25, 2006

Pours a very deep red, far deeper than the normal cantillon kriek. Head is 25% of glass vol.
Nose is typical cantillon mustiness moderated by some sweetness, i can just smell some cherry, unlike the regular cant. kriek.
Taste - this is noticeably milder than their normal product. The cherry is far more pronounced, I can actually distinctly taste sharp cherry in this beer. Furthing tasting tells me that in this case the fruit character is stronger than the lambic character. IF (big if) this is not a blended lambic it would explain some of the lack of complexity in the lambic notes.
Aftertaste is a cherryish mild lambic mustiness, not complex at all. 
Interesting variation on their normal kriek, but I am not sure if I prefer it to their normal version. This does seem sweeter and the lambic-sourness is far more subtle. As far as rating, this beer is highly recommended, I am quibbling over minor issues in a masterpiece. 1,111 charactersdogfooddog, Apr 22, 2006

It arrived with a light, scarlet toned head. The nose was an intense sour cherry, like Montmorency, mixed with vinegar. The color was a cloudy cranberry, approaching the rich color of red velvet cake. It had a really tart, sour cherry flavor on the tongue that actually caused my eyes to water.

Marchiano cherry red juice in a chalice with a pink fuzz floating on top. The smell is distinctly cherry with a prevailing citiric sourness and a touch of peanut sauce that seems weird with the usually sour funk. I thought I was in for the intense sourness of the other Cantillion cherry I have had, but no this was soft stinging sourness with a cherry flavor that melted over the tongue and really carried me away. In the very noisy bar as I sipped this beer I was in another world unto my self and the beer. Great carbonation and the mouthfeel is superb and this is very drinkable at such a low avb. 680 charactersHigravity, Mar 16, 2006

 The taste is well blended, no sharp sourness, but it is sour. Same thing with the cherries and funk, everything is layered rather than hitting you all at once. Mouthfeel is great, this may be the most drinkable lambic I've ever had. 500 charactersSephiroth, Mar 11, 2006

Presentation- 750ml bottle, foiled and corked. 2001 version, yet the cork says bottled in 2002. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
Appearance- Cherry colored pour...as expected. Medium sized off white, rather pink champagne style head. Medium to light lace left behind.
Smell- At first, nothing but ripe and tart cherries. There seemed like a bit of clove or some kind of spice in there as well. After a bit, a strong body oder scent entered the mix which wasn't that appealing. Would have been a close 5 for smell if it wasn't for that. A bit too much funk of a kind I didn't want to smell.
Taste- Cherries, cherries and more cherries. The first taste was pretty mellow. Kinda like biting into a cherry pie. Then it became like drinking pure unfiltered and no sugar added cherry juice. Super astringent and very tart towards the middle and end. The flavor is very nice though.
Mouthfeel- Tart, which turns to a high sourness. I can still taste a bit of cherry after two beers consumed after it.
Drinkability- If you can handle the sourness and the burning in your stomach that comes with it, this beer is for you. Cherry up the ying yang! Flavorful and quite the experience. 1,264 charactersGClarkage, Feb 01, 2006

The aroma was classic sour... mostly tart cherry aroma, but had a definite subtle horse-blanket note as well. Very nice.
The taste was a mouth-puckering sour, very much so upfront... but eased in the aftertaste. Finished quite sweet actually. Rather tame for a lambic.
The mouthfeel was nice... medium bodied, with a moderate amount of carbonation.
Overall, very drinkable, and went nice out in the patio on an August evening. 579 charactersSixpoint, Aug 01, 2005
3.82/5  rDev -14.9%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42001 vintage.
Cherry red - purple color, hal inch of foam, pink, quickly falling.
At the smell: cherry, black sour cherry, cherry stone, leather. The gueuze taste is well present, and strong.
At the taste: tartness, astringency. Good cherries, anyway. Leather notes, just a bit. Strong tartness.
With a full sip, the relative sweetness of the fruit cover it a bit, but with a little sip, the tartness and acidity it's very strong.
Well, goo! Very good. Fruity notes again (meybe unripe grapes), and citron.
Fruty in the aftertaste, dry finish. 551 charactersstcules, May 21, 2005

Aroma: Sour cherry pie and cinamon. Lovely.
Taste: Ungodly amounts of sourness. Dry cherries, more specifically dry cherries, like cherry pits. Rude.
Mouthfeel: Thin, sour, and caustic. Harsh. 
Drinkability: This is a punishing beer, not bad so much as punishing. 
This beer was a big hit at the tasting (Silverhand's review of this beer is from the same), however, I found it ultimately hard to drink. 465 charactersNaerhu, Apr 04, 2005
3.93/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Wow. This was really nice.
It pours a deep opaque red, with a minimal white head. It's really quite attractive. The depth of colour is fantastic.
The nose is, unsurprisingly, dominated by sour cherry, but with complex tones that invite the first sip. The flavour follows, with strongly acidic sour cherry tempered by slightly wood-like characteristics. I was reminded somewhat of fresh cranberry - tart, sour and wonderful.
The mouthfeel is very, very dry, with such a deeply acidic, sour beer, but is not at all unpleasant - just the opposite, in fact.
While one of the others in the room (clearly not a BA!) compared this beer to vinegar after a single sip, do not let that dissuade you from trying what is truly a very good brew.
It's not a beer I'd want to drink all afternoon, but was really very, very enjoyable. 823 charactersthesilverhand, Apr 03, 2005
4.7/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Monk's Cafe. Good for them. 
Appearance: Did I mention this was on-tap? A Lou Pepe, in a proper lambic glass, served in just about the most authentic place this side of the Atlantic. Awesome. The body is a bright and somewhat cloudy red with a little maroon. No head or lace, but a real nice carbonation.
Smell: Absolutley the most sour nose I've ever smelled. A strong smell of sour cherries, that have a noticeable acidity even in the nose. Ripe Cherries. Alive and bright, and slightly dulled by the lambic into having this unmistakeable funky scent. Nice and floral, sweet, sour, funky, sour and sour.
Taste: This is really good. This is unbelieveably good. This lambic has so much real flavor of cherry and fruit that I find it hard to believe that it has been cellared for nearly 3 years. The sweetness is there, and the fresh blossoms are there, and the bark of the tree itself. The dank flavor of wild fermentation conjures tastes of the Belgian countryside, the slightly rotten smell of damp grass, and the horseblanket. It's very much like the regular version only with a more pronouced acidity and raw sourness. The added fruit makes this a nice variation and I can imagine that in bottles the sharp sourness might round out giving an even more lush flavor profile. This is still great stuff though.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It doesn't matter whether this is cold or warm. The carbonation is active and adds to the unique feel of this beer. In a proper lambic glass everything is right, the visual appeal nearly matches the beer's allure in the mouth and nose. So easy to drink, the acidity makes this very quenching and easy to have even when full. To get a nice large glass of this for $6 is outstanding. I don't know about a $30 bottle, but on-tap this is a real treat and one I'm lucky to have come across. 1,842 characters99bottles, Feb 20, 2005

I've never had a berry beer that was this darkly colored. The top is shocking pink too.
The aromas are almost unbearable. Penetrating roomfulls of cherry pulp, cherry sap, skins, seeds and flesh characterise another savory bouquet from this house. That's it : this is wine -- not "beer." Mouthcoating with globs of dry, fruit essences and succulent mousse, there is a paint-like permanence to the flavors. It's like a Cornas from August Clape : sappy, full of energy and yet still immovably dense.
Sucked through clenched teeth and chewed on, it gives velvety rich texture and briny, stewpot succulence.
The finish is quite long and drenched with satisfying acidity. 724 charactersputnam, Jan 25, 2005
4.43/5  rDev -1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A beautiful, dark mix of fuscia and violet with a pinkish head -- sure to invoke, "That's a beer!?!?" from any non-beer drinkers you may be with when you pour it.
A bit of a sugary aroma mingles with cherry and subdued (but unmistakable and unintimitable) Cantillon beer funk. The fruit redolence is quite robust and really lends the impression of cherry preserves or fresh cherry pie.
The naturally lactic, ascerbic nature is really supressed through the extra cherries and the sugar dosing. It's still very clearly a natural fruit flavor as opposed to any sort of syrupiness -- but still, as a lover of the intensity of most Cantillon products, this is just a bit too tamed. The Lou Pepe Gueuze was subdued to the point of allowing a lot of natural complexities to really shine. In this case, it seems that the tartness is subdued to really highlight cherry, cherry, cherry. Appropriate for a kriek, I suppose -- but it's just a bit much.
All in all, another spectacular beer from what is possibly my favorite brewery. Big fruit flavors and a nice full, well-carbonated mouthfeel. Immensely drinkable for a lambic. 1,125 charactersmarburg, Jan 01, 2005

Musty aroma of cherries and tartness...ofcourse!
Like I have said before, I find it very redundant to describe the flavors of almost every lambic. This particular one had a much more pronounced fruit profile than the standard Cantillon Kriek but it lacked assertion, especially with its sourness. Quite dry on the finish. Still very good and this was certainly a pleasure to consume. I just wish that they could have blended an older lambic so the sourness would have been a little more pronounced. 513 charactersCrosling, Sep 30, 2004
4.68/5  rDev +4.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A small oval label says "KRIEK 2001." The cork says bottled in 2.002. I'll believe cork.
Beautiful looking brew. Perfect scarlet red hue. Perfect clarity. And a good sized head with a grapefruit pink tinged light raspberry red color. Great head. The retention is solid. And the lace is moderate. The aroma is sweet and tart. Brown sugar sweet. Acidic cherry tart. A little bit of the barnyard and horse blanket tones, but not much on the nose. The smell invites me, "Drink me. Drink me." So I do. And I'm not disappointed. Tart, acidic tones hit up front. Sour and puckering. But in that good, lambic sort of way. (Or in reality, I should say, "in that good, Cantillon sort of way." Because not many do them as good as Cantillon.) There's a nice cherry pie sensation, but this beer is more about the funk and tart than it is the sweet. Cherry tones are juicy, yet tart. The funky barnyard tones are present, but subdued, and enjoyable. Oh yeah, bring it on. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly. A bit cleansing. And the body is about medium or so. This one is incredibly drinkable. Glad I've got her all to myself. 1,115 charactersBighuge, Sep 03, 2004
4.7/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Kriek 2001 Vintage:
Presentation: Spied this during a beer store rummage with Davo, so I immediately picked up this beauty. Cost me all of $20 whilst in NYC back in May. The typical 750ml Cantillon green glass bottle comes with a cork/crown cap, all covered in a thick black foil that covers the slender neck. Once the foil and crown cap were removed it revealed a pristine cork. The main obverse label is a generic one for the Lou Pepe, and it has a picture of the area around Mannekin Piss statute, which is also the view seen from the Poechenellekelder. A small oval sticker above the main obverse label lists this as Kriek 2001, but the cork has a bottled date of 2002. The Lou Pepe range was created to mark the handing over of Brewster activities at Cantillon from father (Jean-Pierre) to son (Jean). The Lou Pepe Kriek is one of the better 2 year old lambics steeped with 50% more Cherries (300g/l as opposed to 200g/l) than its standard stable mate and reinvigorated with a sweet liquor sugar solution. Bordeaux barrels are also used, lending some further unique flavors to this special Vintage Kriek.
Appearance: Poured into a straight sided Cantillon tumbler. Deeply red-purple, burgundian, dark, cloudy and impenetrable. A decent sized pink head forms and fizzes for all its worth. The effervescent rousings are loud and spit small bits of Kriek up into the air. When the fizzing finishes and the quiet returns, there is little but a pink halo sliver and a small broken floating thin island in the middle of the head. A gentle swirl reveals some dissolved carbonation, enough to give life to this fruity-luscious marvel. Superb appearance.
Nose: Freshly baked Cherry Pie straight from the oven that has its crisp crust broken revealing the inner whole cherries and the warm vapors of the thick syrup in all their glory. This is fantastic. Tart and sharp, not quite as much as the usual, but the deeper whole cherry fruits make up for it. Slight acidic funk in the latter third. Dont breathe too deeply though, for Cantillon Virgins it will still make your eyes water!
Taste: The best part by far. Sheer Kriek Indulgence. Massive blast of sharp Cherries, fruity yet acerbically tart, so pungent it induces deep breathes through your clenched jaws and teeth. The smooth 2 year lambic base saves itself for the middle and dry finish. Amazingly astringent, yet in a completely acceptable Cantillon manner. Superb!
Mouthfeel: Smooth, sharp, cutting, slashing, ducking and diving. Its here, there and everywhere. Cherry chews in the middle, lambic funk start and finish, with a saliva stripping long lingering end that can at times induce the rare condition known as scrotuminusdisappearus.
Drinkability: I am deeply biased, so I will unashamedly admit to admiring the way Cantillon and its tart mastery of the fruity lambics can still create a masterpiece that induces death by dissolving the imbiber. I managed the whole 750ml to myself, but fuck knows where my testicles are.
Overall: Supreme. Masterful. Insightful. Cantillon seem to be able to get their minds inside every cask of lambic and into the very heart of each of the fruits that they use. They seem to know just how it will mature and react in the many environs that they envision. Simply Marvelous and Sheer Genius.
I love the way that the Masters at Cantillon always push the traditional boundaries but in a deeply respectful manner. They do no wrong for me. 
Shockingly Brilliant!!! A Kriek Premier Cru if ever there was one. 3,537 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Aug 31, 2004
4.2/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Enjoyed at The Moan & Dove, Amherst, MA. Presented in a Cantillon glass.
No head whatsoever over the deep red liquid. The appearance tempted a few ladies in our party to try my "fruit beer", but they were not impressed. Oh well, their loss is my gain, more for me. Aroma is the expected Cantillon lambic funk, which I won't even attempt to put into words, if you've had one you know what I speak of. Suffice it to say, after many different brews from them, apparently this is the way it is supposed to be. Flavor is a duet of sourness and cherry splendidness, which is an event for the taste buds. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good, I will enjoy Cantillons whenever I can, for they are such rarities around here, and should be enjoyed as such. 748 charactersppoitras, Jun 06, 2004
3.94/5  rDev -12.2%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Enjoyed with Oakes, tiggmtl, kimchee and martint thanks to Nexxus. It pours a beautiful dark bloody red with a short-lasting pinkish head. Aroma is not too intense for a lambic although some of the characteristics I look for are in there. Blood orange meets cherries, strwaberries, blood, leaves, cinnamon... As it warms up, theres a solvent or toothpaste quality emerging and it seems far less complex like a minty cranberry juice. In mouth though, the cherry flavors is good and clean. Its quite sour, cherry flavored lemon juice alike, but the acidity is clearly mostly lactic. Orange fruity flavors, dry finish which is surprisingly not too astringent. Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. Im impressed at how this is still somehow well balanced and rather thick. Accessible Cantillon, but the best? I think not. 829 charactersRastacouere, May 24, 2004

There is little carbonation in the beer, but it doen't really detract from from this fine beer. The sour cherry is up front and then the funkiness hits. It finishes with some vanilla and a slight woodiness. It is not as complex as the botled version, but more mellow. Still it is excellent. 410 charactersark57, Apr 19, 2004
4.73/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I shared a bottle of this which was bought at Cantillon after we toured the place. Seeing it in person made me appreciate Cantillon beers so much more. Anyway, this Lou Pepe Kriek was pretty damn good. I'm pretty sure it made me smile. It poured a deep but not dark red colour with a light pink head. Very nice to look at. It had that funky lambic smell to it in the background, along with cherries and spices. Reminded me a bit of Quelque Chose but not as sweet. Taste was again full of cherries and spice, like cherry pie kind of, very mellow compared to other Cantillons I'd sampled. I wonder if it's because it's straight from the brewery so it's so fresh? Don't know, but it's good. It was soft in my mouth, not syrupy at all for how fruity it is, and yeah, I could drink lots more of it if it were around. Definitely worth trying, especially if you can get it from Mr. Van Roy himself! 891 characterserica, Apr 07, 2004

This beer pours an ever so slightly hazy deep red color. It is topped by bubbly light red to pink colored head, that never quite disappears entirely. The carbonation is persistent, though not overly high either. The aroma is sour and woody at first, then notes of Barnyard funk kick in. There is a definite musty, leathery, ancient dusty room type aroma here. At the very end I get a bit of sweet cherry notes in the nose.
The tasted is softly acidic (for a Lambic) and it is accompanied by a rich body. There is a definite dry, tart, tannic cherry note here. The time spent on the cherries seems to have increased the body quite substantially. This is quite good, and quite different from what I was expecting. It is a bit softer, and a bit better integrated than the standard Cantillon beers. It is nicely sour, with notes of citrus & vinegar. The finish is woody and reminds me of cherry skins. This is certainly a beer I could drink a lot of. The cherry flavor is quite good in this beer. There is no sticky sweetness, like that found in the more commercial versions, instead there are these intense, chewy, mouth filling, cherry skin, dry, tart flavors that just proclaims that there are cherries in this Lambic. I really like this, and it certainly has grown on me as I finish the bottle. 1,351 charactersGueuzedude, Apr 03, 2004
4.61/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml, 2001 vintage bottle, bottled in 2003. Purchased in Bruxelles at the Cantillon brewery. Mr. Van-Roy rang me up personally. This bottle was about $7. Compare that to the $30 that we would normally pay for a lou pepe here!
Appearance: As always the appearance is awesome. A well carbonated red brew with a small head of pinkish/off-white foam.
Smell: The aromas seem a bit subdued for a Cantillon offering. The classic Cantillon lambic funk is there, but it is in the background more than it usually is. I also pick up cherry pie filling, and a melange of spices in the aroma.
Taste: The taste is an awesome blend of cherry pie filling, acidic lambic funk, and light malts. This really is different than many other Cantillon brews. Perhaps this is because this is a very fresh bottle? Or perhaps it is because the Lou Pepe beers are supposed to be much fruiter than the regular fruit beer offerings from Cantillon? Either way, it works! This is like Quelque Chose (which I loved), but the complexity and funk that this brew throws, makes it even better!
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and everything that one would expect from a Cantillon offering. Swish this one around in your mouth, and just hold it there for a while.
Drinkability: The drinkability of this monster is awesome. A sweet, cherry-pie-filling-like brew that will satisfy you until the last drop is down your gullet.
In the end: Highly recommended by me, and absolutely amazing fresh. It may be $30 here in the states, but it is still worth every penny. C'mon treat yourself! 1,575 charactersfrancisweizen, Apr 01, 2004

This lambic poured a hazy, ruby color with no foam at all. The smell was a modest sour cherry aroma -- nice but subdued. The taste was tart cherry, somewhat sour, with a bit of horse blanket. A very good flavor overall. The mouthfeel was dry and crisp and tart with medium body and low carbonation. The slightly sour cherry flavor lingered pleasantly on the tongue. This was a very good kriek lambic, good to the last drop. 454 charactersUncleJimbo, Feb 08, 2004
