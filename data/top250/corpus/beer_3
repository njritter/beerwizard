L - The color is very hazy cream sickle orange with a thin but fluffy white head
S - I get orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and malt sweetness
T - The flavor is tangerines, passion fruit, and grapefruit.  It's a slightly bitter bite on the finish
F - Very very creamy and full bodied.  Surprised an Ipa can get this thick.
O - Balance is where it's at.  Great citrus flavors without being overpowering. 421 charactersbrewaddict, Apr 27, 2017

4.6/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Canned a week and a half ago.  Tulip glass.
A: Pours a straw/light golden color with two inches of fluffy snow white head which deflates over the course of a few minutes leaving rings of lacing.  Very good retention.  The usual Tree House haze/opaqueness.  
S: Smells like raw hop pellets, noticeable even from a few feet away; this mellows as it warms.  Peach, white grapefruit, orange, kiwi, a bit of grass.  Moderately sweet aroma with some light bready malt.  
T: Tropical (peach) and white grapefruit notes dominate,  alongside some supporting orange creamsicle character (no doubt accentuated by the ultra creamy body), finishing with a very mild and soft bitterness.  Medium-light but fairly sweet bread malt character as well which lingers on the finish.  The bitterness tempers the sweetness but it’s still fairly noticeable.  A bit of astringency on the finish as it warms (I’m guessing hop derived).
M: Thick, creamy full body with light carbonation.  Carb is maybe a bit too light to really cut the rich body.  Light alcohol warmth.
O: Among the better of the Tree House hazy IPAs, on par with the usual suspects (e.g., Trillium Melcher St. and Tired Hands Alien Church).  I like sweetness in an IPA like this, though this is a hair more than ideal (if I had to complain about something). 1,309 characterspmarlowe, Apr 05, 2017

Pours thick into a deep, cloudy orange, with almost a little grey to it – like orange fog. The head dies down quickly leaving tight lacing along the sides. Very small bubbles of carbonation. Solid hop foundation with layers of subtle top notes – they reveal themselves as they moves around my tongue. Mango and orange highs, with some notes of grass, hay, and earth, with some rising bread dough mixed in – yet none of these flavors dominates. So soft and smooth – even with the higher abv there's only a little alcohol bite. This one really makes me slow down and savor it as it deserves. 705 charactersSicilianDefenseR, Apr 03, 2017

This one pours a surprisingly very hazy bright orange, looks super thicc, with a lot of lacing.
This smells pretty tremendous, with a ton of mango and pineapple, mainly, and a hint of pine and weed. This is just so pungent.
This is probably the best beer from Tree House that I've had. There's just so much tropical-ity here, mangos and pineapple and juicy tangerine, with a slight but pleasant bitterness. This has a nice creamsicle quality to it.
This is medium bodied, definitely creamy and full feeling, with that classic TH mouthfeel that's always killer.
This is absurdly nice. This is a really killer IPA. 662 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 03, 2017

Reviewed 3/31/17.
Poured into Tree House tulip glass.
A: Very turbid, light golden orange in the glass. A full finger of white/off-white head - somewhat rocky bubbles. Dissipates to a film.
S: Peaches, mango, and orange are leaping out of the glass on this one. At the same time, it smells dank. Haze is missing an explosive aroma like some of the other Tree House beers, but Very Hazy delivers. Maybe a slight hint of bready malt, but hardly noticeable.
T: This is incredible. the flavor really pops in an explosive way. It's that blended fruit smoothie that Tree House is known for. Big mango, peach, orange. The flavor doesn't just explode, but it really shines in your mouth in a way that I have never seen in another IPA. The bitterness is seductively smooth. The dank character that is familiar from Haze. Bready malts are present, but subdued and overshadowed by the dankness. Typical Tree House yeast profile still very present on the back end.
F: This isn't quite Green/Very Green thickness, but I have yet to encounter another IPA that is. It's still medium-plus mouth feel, still pillowy and fluffy. The thing that makes this beer what it is, though, is the carbonation. The carbonation is absolutely perfect. It rolls over the tongue, but still lingers on the inside of the mouth.
O: This is amazing. I was nervous diving into this beer that this beer could not possibly live up to the level of hype that surrounded it. But it did and then some. This is on its own level. 1,504 charactersSpoild, Apr 01, 2017

4.98/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A 16 oz can poured into a Tree House teku. The date was smudged but it looks like 3-23-17. 
Appearance- A hazy pineapple-orange color with a thick 2 finger plus head. Nice lacing down the glass. 
Smell- A super aroma pineapple, peach, and grapefruit. As soon as I opened the can it was screaming drink me. The fruit and hop aroma really sets Tree House apart from other beers. 
Taste- The fruits blend so seamlessly blend with a hop kicker for the finish. A little dryness for the finish but so juicy. 
Feel- A fluffy feel with no bitterness or alcohol. Medium carbonation and smooth. 
Overall- A phenomenal DIPA from Tree House. I'm not certain how you would get a better blend of juicy fruit taste with the nice hops. Easily one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. I could only get one and it was definitely worth it. 823 charactersKdouble, Mar 30, 2017

4.94/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I like regular Haze but it isn't amongst my favorite TH beers so I didn't expect this version to completely blow my mind. But it did. 
Beautiful completely opaque hazy neon peach appearance. The nose is peaches and cream with some citrus and birthday cake. 
Stone fruit dominates the taste. Much more peach. Lots of apricot. Hints of orange and grapefruit as well as some soft serve vanilla ice cream. No malt presence. No bitterness. The booze are hidden much more effectively than most TH DIPAs. There is absolutely no trace of the 8.6% ABV. 
Mouthfeel is huge. Full, fluffy, and creamy. This is Tree House at it's finest. This beer has no flaws (except for the fact that it tastes nothing like a beer). A really unique drinking experience. 742 charactersSenatorSpaceman, Mar 27, 2017

Very Hazy is aptly named, about a finger and a half of big bubbles in the head and beautiful lacing.  Aside from the bubbles, looks like orange juice in the glass.  Smells like tropical fruit and citrus....quite strongly.  Tastes incredible, very hop forward citrusy and tropical.  Its balanced with a slight biterness on the back end, no alcohol tasted in this at all....very dangerous at 8.6%, and I mean that in the best way possible.  Another wonderful offering from the best brewery I've had the pleasure of visiting. 614 charactersmfrank421, Mar 25, 2017

5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This might just be the greatest beer that Tree House has ever had and that I have every tasted. This beer is perfectly named with a truly opaque murkiness. Incredible head/lacing, a bouquet tropical aromatics that smells like fresh blended juices. I get a lot of guava, papaya, passionfruit, and pineapple. There is a ever so slight hop/bitterness note towards the end that sparks and sizzles. There are so many layers of complexity that it is rather difficult to capture solely with words. Drink fresh. Cheers to the many blessings Tree House has bestowed upon me. 565 charactersTrevor11, Nov 09, 2016

This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had.
I've been lucky to have several beers from Tree House and hope to keep adding to the list.
Very hazy is  8.6% and incredibly drinkable.  Full of flavor, grapefruit and tropical fruits.  Hoppy  of course but not overpowering.  Just another incredible brew. 420 charactersryno6616, Oct 19, 2016

Hazy, juicy body with a half inch of head. The aroma is spectacular, offering a bouquet of tropical fruits and fresh hop. Cantaloupe, pineapple, orange, grapefruit. Sweetness perfectly melding with bitterness. Crushable. Amazing. I don't know how this beer can improve. In regards to IPAs, Tree House reigns supreme. 364 charactersHuhzubendah, Oct 12, 2016

L:  Pours classic hazy Tree House style (No pun intended).  One finger of white, whispy head that dissipates relatively quickly.
S:  Nose is pineapple, grapefruit, peaches.  
T:  Tastes of tropical fruits with a nice resinous hop finish that shines through in the background.
F:  As always, great mouthfeel and body, consistent of a Tree House IPA.
O:  This is another fantastic IPA from Tree House.  Not as fresh as I've had (Reviewing 9/27), and I think its somewhat noted here.  However, I think that compliments it even more that it still has such bright hop and fruit characteristics.  Excellent. 643 charactersNic1985Ace, Sep 28, 2016

As the name says, the beer is very hazy.  Looks like OJ that stayed in the fridge too long and began to bubble a bit.  Thin small bubbled head settles quickly, rings the glass, and leaves sticky lacing.
The beer explodes with earthy, resinous, and citrus hop aroma.
Flavor is deep hoppy.  Earthy, resinous pine, grapefruit rind and zest.  As good as can be.
The beer is moderately carbonated, medium mouthfeel.
Overall this is an excellent brew and brings the best aspects of everything Tree House does to the forefront. 567 charactersjhavs, Sep 06, 2016

This is another epic offering. Unfiltered , cloudy; huge tropical nose that doesn't disappear. Flavors  - this one has an incredible balanced mix of tropical flavors and grapefruit bitterness. And of course, the super soft Tree House mouthfeel brings it home. Perfect carbonation. Ever so slight hint of the 8.6 at the very end, but hardly noticeable. Mad props again to lunchboxhead for his more than generous trade that included this gem. In my opinion this one stands among the very best of the TH giants. If buying into the Monson hype is wrong, then I don't want to be right. 712 characters11-52_4hops, Aug 31, 2016

5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Canned 8/19/16. Consumed 8/26/16.
A: Just when I didn't think it was possible for Tree House to release a hazier, thicker-looking beer, this thing comes along. Pours a murky golden yellow with a finger and and a half of the softest, creamiest white head. Seriously, the head defined what I think of as pillowy with the tiniest of bubbles. Sits in the glass completely opaque, a dark and murky orange-yellow.
S: My god. Aroma literally billows out of the glass. The sweetest most delicious-smelling assortment of tropical and citrus fruits. Pineapple, mango, yellow peach. Tons of orange and tangerine. The furthest thing from subtle. The fruit notes are overwhelming, almost arresting. As it warms, I get a good amount of that signature Tree House candy/bubblegum yeast character as well.
T: Absolutely insane. Unlike anything I've ever had before. Explosion of flavors that follow the nose. Super ripe pineapple, yellow peach, and mango up front. Punches of of sweet citrus fruits follow, and a significant presence of the sweet bready, bubblegum yeast character that underlies the hoppiness. Sweetness from the fruit flavors transitions beautifully into a VERY lightly malty sweetness on the finish, which actually perfectly complements medium minus bitterness and creates and extraordinary drying aspect that leaves you ready for another sip almost immediately.
M: Perfect. Truly, truly as good as it gets. Fully creamy, silky smooth, and lightly bitter on the finish. Carbonation is exquisite, providing a delicate effervescence to complement the smoothness. As mentioned above, the dryness of the finish is perhaps the most unique aspect of this beer, making it dangerously drinkable for 8.6%. Notably, there the slightest appearance of heat in the throat as it warms, but it's quite excusable given the style--and the fact that it's easily overwhelmed by the other incredible elements this beer has to offer.
O: Not sure what to say here. Tree House has outdone themselves once again. I've now been lucky enough to try a fair share of their hoppy rotational offerings, and Very Hazy has absolutely solidified itself at the head of the pack. It epitomizes everything I love about Tree House beers (hefty and creamy mouthfeel, pungent tropical aroma, and a flavor profile reminiscent of a freshly made fruit smoothie, to name a few) and adds a few unique elements of its own, most notably a significant dryness on the finish. It reminds me most of Haze (of course) and Green, offering an intensified version of the flavor profile of the former combined with an intensified version of the aroma and mouthfeel of the latter. Simply put, this is the best hoppy beer I've ever had. 2,686 charactersavas, Aug 27, 2016

Taste is sweet peach, nectarine, and orange.  Like regular Haze, my previous favorite Tree House brew, but with extra fruit flavor.  Heavy bodied, thick, slight bitterness and lots of goodness.  May be my favorite Tree House brew.  Well worth driving out for.  Only my third perfect beer in 2,500 ratings.  Cannot see how an imperial IPA can taste any better, but am willing to search for that brew. 527 characterstigg924, Aug 21, 2016

L: Murky, and very hazy dark yellow orange. A beautiful glowing orb with some light behind it. Gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing.
S: This is definitely super haze... A concentrated burst of spiced and hopped pineapple, papaya, peach and passion fruit. Very sweet on the nose.
T: Sweet tropical fruit followed by bitter bursting hops,an amazing blend of sweet fruit and pronounced dry hops. Dry bitter hop finish making you want the sweet fruit again.  
F: This is where VH really shines... just a glorious inflated hop orb with almost no carbonation feel but dancing prickly hops hitting you all over.  I barely want to swallow it.  
O: Another masterpiece from the geniuses at Tree House.  The beating and variety of flavors is staggering.  The dance from sweet citrus to sweet hops to dry bitter hops is amazing. 860 charactersjoezak5, Aug 20, 2016

5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a medium gold hazy color.
The aroma pumps out of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, citrus peel, tangerine, yellow grapefruit, bright citrus, white peach, without being overly juicy, fresh breadiness.
The flavor is insanity and arguably one of the best DIPAs around. The flavor is not too juicy with pineapple candy and ice, pulpy and pithy orange, grapefruit, white bready malt, onto grassiness and herbaceous. Medium plus mouhtfeel leaning towards creamy.  The beer in soft for days like Haze, with a touch more drinkability despite its ABV bump with the sharpness on the beer towards the finish. 617 charactersdar482, Jun 29, 2016

Pours a "very hazy" orange body, super turbid and cloudy just as the name suggests. Two finger white head rises and falls slowly to leave a layer of retention and spotty lacing. 
Aromas are delicate but forward, lots of tropical fruit, grapefruit, mango, pineapple. Light alcohol shows up. 
On the tongue are layers of tropical fruits and citrus, mango, papaya, soft orange creamsicle, very easy drinking for the ABV, smooth and creamy but full of taste, very light bitterness on the finish. Definitely an imperial version of haze, but it's missing the unusual watermelon note I get in haze. Still very delicious. Medium body with light carbonation. 
One of the best Treehouse IPAs I've ever had and definitely worth the hunt. 863 charactersgcamparone, Jun 29, 2016

Look - hazy, cloudy yellow in color with a thick white head and pretty nice lacing
Smell - bursting aromas all at once.  So much complexity it's hard to tell what is present.  Super citrusy and all very bold: melon, pineapple, orange, grapefruit
Taste - complexity continues.  Pineapple is strong as well as grapefruit.  There really is so much going on it's hard to describe.  Really tropical and flavorful.  So much going on it is a lovely combination of flavors.
Feel - very juicy.  Not creamy at all, which means the 8.6% comes from the hopping techniques.  Very drinkable but the ABV is somewhat present.
Overall - a really well done beer.  This is complex as I have stated a few times.  Really tropical, dank, juicy.  Just everything I want in a DIPA.  Lovely. 820 charactersrabbott2, Jun 09, 2016

4.93/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is almost perfect for me.  Words can't describe how good this beer truly is.  For an 8.6% this beer is dangerously drinkable.  The crazy part is I wasn't a real big Haze guy to begin with because of the first batches that, let's be honest here, were bad batches but once they got it right ... my god is any Haze growing on me.
Looks like any other TH DIPA with a cloudy orange look and lacing on the glass with pillowly foam in the class after an aggressive pour.   I can't tell the difference with smells because of my  broken nose but I will say that TH's DIPAs are more distinguishable than their others for me.  The taste is god like.  Like I said before I wasn't a huge Haze guy but my god is this the best DIPA from TH for me.  Probably the best DIPA I've ever had.  Feel is that awesome creamy mouthfeel I yearn for from TH and it just coats your mouth ... just awesome. 
Overall you need to get this beer in any manner.  Hands down perfection from what is routinely being describe on BA as the best DIPA in the world.  And I can't disagree with them. 1,065 charactersBEEPOP, Jun 05, 2016

4.96/5  rDev +4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a can dated 6/2/16.
Pours a completely opaque golden straw color with a 2-finger fluffy white head. The head sticks around for a while and leaves a nice film atop the beer as it dissipates. Has some splotchy lacing.
The aroma is a fruit apocalypse. An incredulous amount of peach, orange and grapefruit as well as pineapple, mango, and melon assault your nostrils. This is like Haze if all the tropical and citrus fruit notes in that beer took steroids and then beat the crap out of it.
The flavor is like an apocalypse in the Bahamas.
With loads of melon and mango, as well as pineapple, there's also an absurd amount of peach. The citrus is more subdued but it's absolutely there. Finishes subtly piney.
The feel is medium-full bodied with relatively light carbonation. Smooth and creamy as expected, and hides the ABV extremely well. It's hard to call a DIPA "soft and fluffy" but TH does it. Again.
Overall, this is just absurd. I didn't expect this to be a lot different than regular Haze and while it's very similar, it takes everything that makes Haze great and turns it up to 11. This is possibly the best beer I've had from them and that's saying a lot. 1,179 charactersScaryEd, Jun 03, 2016
5/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Can dated 6/2, it is only hours old! This beer pours a completely opaque golden orange identical to orange juice. The head is slow to form but ends up being huge, dense and bright white. Retention is excellent and there are webs of lacing down the entire glass. Smell is amazing. Easily the best smelling beer I have ever encountered, if I could rate it a 6 I would. Orange, peach, pineapple, grapefruit, and dank citrus pith explode out of the glass. No joke you can smell it from across the room. Taste is the same with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Feel is amazing, cannot believe this is 8.6%. It is so soft, smooth, and sticky with a little prickle from the bitterness on the finish. Overall what can I say? Only beer I have ever rated a perfect 5. There is literally nothing that could be done to improve this beer. Perfection in a can. 848 charactersCNoj012, Jun 03, 2016

S: Intensely juicy with a twinge of malt. Tons of citrus and stone fruit...mango, peach, etc.
T: Pretty intense. Lots of tropical hops masking a tiny bit of ethanol; so much fruit from the flavor it almost seems like there is a bit of nectar added. Crazy long finish.

Minimal white head and lots of lacing. The aromas are mind-blowing. The only other beer that has shocked me this much was Juice Machine... aromas of tropical fruits dancing around. The flavors definitely follow suit with peaches, pineapple, tangerines, and other tropical citrus fruits. There is a little bit of dank and minimal malt; the ABV is well hidden with this one! The carbonation is on point and mouthfeel is very creamy. Overall, this is an absolutely phenomenal DIPA from the aromas, to the tastes, to the mouthfeel, to the color, and so on... this is worth seeking out! Super drinkable beer!

Pours a light yellow-orange body, appropriately hazy as the name indicates, one finger white head with good retention, some lacing. Very promising nose reveals a fair bit of tropical fruit and citrus, resinous with a nice mild caramel sweetness in the background. The hops are explosive as expected, with resin and pine following in the background. It's really a lot like Alter Ego which I had just before this. Seems to me that the malt backbone is a bit more sturdy here, however, providing some semblance of balance. Palate wise, the hops are more balanced with the malt, with a big preponderance of tropical fruit and citrus, finishing off with resinous pine bitterness that coats the palate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, well carbonated, just great in terms of how drinkable it is with all the hops in there. Another very nice IPA from Tree House, at this point, they can pretty much release similar IPAs with slight variation and it's all going to taste similarly great. 1,012 charactersStevedore, May 02, 2016

S:  Gorgeous aroma, tons of citrus up front, followed by pineapple, papaya and mango.  Aroma is very sweet and tangy.  Some ethanol on the nose
T:  Reflection of the aroma, tons of fruity hop notes.  Very sweet with obvious notes of pineapple juice.  Finishes with a bitter bite but is very balanced. No detectable ethanol.  
F: Typical treehouse, full frothy mouthfeel, like a light milkshake in ways.  Smooth as hell.  Full body rounds out the bitterness for a highly drinkable experience.

Look: Unfiltered, Yellow/Orange color. Very weak head due to the age, but very nice looking beer. (9/10)
Smell: The best Bubblicious you could ever imagine. Sweet, Spicy, Fruity, Dank. The hop aroma is overwhelming. (10/10)
Taste: The bubble/fruity gum taste is incredible. It's such a pleasant, fresh, clean taste that is so different from any other beer. The classic tropical fruit and hop tastes are strong that turn into a spicy bitter but pleasant aftertaste. No presence of the alcohol. The hops over power the Malts so much that you don't even think about them. (10/10)
Feel: Exceptionally balanced beer, no bite or bad aftertaste. Incredibly smooth, no alcohol taste. (9/10)
Overall: One of my favorite beers by far. It's incredibly smooth and such a pleasure thing to drink. (9/10) 844 characterscurtis6290, Apr 17, 2016

Appearance- the name says it all. Easily the haziest of all the treehouse IPAs.  Light orange with minimal head and strong lacing .  
Aroma- dankness initially.  Citrus hits in second wave
Flavor-  resembles smell.  Dankness then citrus.  This beer to me tastes much more dry than Julius and alter ego.  
Feel- creamy like all the tree house IPAs.  
Overall-  this is a really good beer but imo below Julius,King Julius and doppleganger.  This is marginally better than haze.   I really enjoyed it, but would not wait an hr in line for it again. 580 charactersjcflorian, Apr 16, 2016

L: Incredibly turbid murky pineapple hue, a little brighter than their other offerings. Nice white head that holds forever.
S: So dank and tropical, but not oniony, which I'm fine with but without it is better. Guava, pineapple, mango, you name it.
T: Just the same. It's perfect. Very tropical with just enough green hop presence to balance it out.
F: So full and creamy, light carb. Perfect TH mouthfeel as usual.
O: It really is Haze turned to 11. Haze is very close, but Very Hazy just has that extra kick that I want out of Haze, which is my favorite standard TH beer. I'd probably say it's worth the hype, but you'll do just fine with Haze, which is much easier to get. 731 characterscultclassic89, Mar 26, 2016

Epic juice/hop bomb, surpasses King Julius and Juice Machine in the "juice" department, and also successfully eclipses Haze, which in my opinion is one of TH's most delicious beers. Best IPA/DIPA I've had from this phenomenal brewery. 435 charactersMomack229, Mar 07, 2016

4.64/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the 16 oz can dated 02/18/16 (with a nice "Haze me bro" tag underneath), 7 days old. This beer  lives up to its name and comes out opaquely hazy, orange juice colored, nice foamy head leaves beautiful lacing. Perfection!
Smell is pure Tree House, that juice laden smell wafts through the room after cracking the can top. The head builds and the hops dance around the room. Huge orange/tangerine notes, bitter hop resin, yum! Flavor is so potent, dry crackery malts provide some bready notes, but then the big citrus fruits come out, some mango and a bit of pineapple sweetness, subtle. Ends with a great hoppy oil aftertaste, just slightly herbal and vegetal to give you hints as to how loaded this recipe is with those lovely green flowers.
Finishes dry in the mouth, body is deceptively light, no alcohol presence. Very Hazy lives up to the hype in all the right ways, just a total tangerine bomb here. 918 charactersBranfordBound, Feb 26, 2016

Taste:  Apple, pineapple & peach, slight bitterness and slight alcohol on the finish.  Not as sweet a finish as the regular version of Haze.
Feel:  Very nice, some lingering phenol - this is an "imperial" IPA!

Completely opaque yellow orange color. Can't see through it all. Aroma is powerful fruity citrus hops you can smell across the room. Taste is a juicy citrus bomb with a creamy thick mouth coating feel. Zero alcohol in the taste but maybe the slightest hint in the aroma. Impressive at 8.6%.

4.9/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Pours the perfect "hazy" pale yellow color with a nice white fluffy head and lacing all the way down the glass.
S: Probably the best smelling ipa i've had. Hits you strong with tons of fruit smell. Orange, peach, papaya, and an almost sherbet smell. The very backend you get a little hint of some hop smell.
T: Follows the nose very well. Tons of fruit/citrus. Orange sherbet, some delicious peach, and papaya. Toward the back you start to get some pineapple. With that you do get some bitterness and hop oil on the end that stays on your tongue a bit.
F: Best of the best. Its super creamy and coats your mouth just right, while somehow still giving you the carbonation and refreshing ness.
O: Another world class ipa from treehouse, some of the best mouthfeel and fruit flavor i've ever had. I do slightly prefer this to very green, but doppelganger still has a special place in my heart. 894 charactersGinjaSlice, Feb 21, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5L - Classic hazy (pun intended) golden orange with two fingers of white head
S - Melon, orange zest, orange sherbet, hop juice
T - Intense peach and orange juice. It's like chewing Juicy Fruit then taking a bite of an orange. Orange sherbet and creme with a finish that has hop juice and bitterness.
F - Creamy and soft. Pillowy. Like touching your tongue to a cloud. No alcohol presence.
O - Very Hazy is the Peyton Manning to the standard Haze is the sense that is on HGH. Calling this Haze dialed up to 11 is an understatement and it almost becomes its own being with the ludicrous amounts of citrus and the heavenly mouthfeel. Not to mention how easy it is to drink as this DIPA has no syrupy or resinous feel. Probably the best Tree House IPA I've ever had. 766 charactersThrewRedButter, Feb 19, 2016

4.89/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5L - pure clementine juice. Floury haze with a peachy turbid murkiness. Reminds me of a lighter Green. In the right light, it looks like fresh-squeeze pink grapefruit juice. Thin, crisp head to top it all off. 
S - whoa, pure peach and orange on the nose. Tons of pineapple, mango, citrus smoothie. Strong hops in the back, this one is pungent as shit. 
T - as with all Tree House IIPAs, an initial bready wheaty punch. Galaxy hops? Insanely smooth as flavors of peach and candied apricots shine through. Tangerine, clementine, satsuma. Delectable light, flitting citrus flavors all tied together with a delicate malt backbone and acidic grapefruit rind bitterness. 8.6% my ass. This one is dangerously smooth. 
F - light on carbonation, heavy in creaminess! Not too overbearing and syrupy like a lot of beers in this ABV range tend to be. Has the perfect soft, but commanding character to hold this beer upright. 
O - another home run in this latest series of IIPAs from Tree House. Probably one of the better ones. A kicked up Haze, but manages to capitalize on everything Haze left unfinished. Arguably better than its baby counterpart. 1,142 charactersagreenman19, Feb 19, 2016

Murky pale orange 
Signature Treehouse with that smooth mouthfeel.
Strong citrus scent, with mango
Another juice bomb, OJ, Grapefruit, Pineapple, Holy Peach
It's funny, because all the other flagship doubles reminded me of the standard beer.  However, Very Hazy doesn't remind me of Haze all that much.
Another Holy Crap! beer.
They continue to amaze me. 414 charactersHorbar, Feb 19, 2016

Nose brings tons of tangerine and orange juice, creamy fluffy malt base and orange cream, juicy citrus and Clementine, lots of big juicy citrus, little orange peel. Touch generic tropical papaya like fruit. 
Taste brings a lots of creamy malts, oats perhaps, some grassy wheat I think too, little grainy malt, toasty, mild sweet cream note, and faint touch of booze. Plenty of citrus again, orange peel, tangerine, little orange cream, faint tropical notes generic mostly, mild bitter grassy like flavor too, with nice grapefruit pith, and even a touch of melon pith rind thing. Finish is dry and mildly bitter, long juicy citrus and grapefruit pith, little faint bitter pine on the back end.
