Well, first, you have to jump into Mr. Peabody & Sherman's W.A.B.A.C. Machine, going back to the early-to-mid-1970's. There, a youthful Bro. Woody spent a LOT of time on his maternal grandparents' property, abutting a working farm. A young neighbor girl traded comic books & played tetherball with me. She grew up, married a fellow local beer aficionado & during a recent road trip to VT, they knew to bring me CANs! Viva The CANQuest (tm)! It pays to advertise. 
From the CAN: "Drink from the CAN!"; "Focal Banger(R) is an Ameri[CAN] India Pale Ale. We have a real love for IPAs here at The Alchemist, and we strive to offer you the best hope experience that we possibly [CAN]. This beer is brewed using Citra and Mosaic hops and our favorite British malts. Truly, an abundance of hoppy goodness ... Freshness and [CAN]trol have always been my main [CAN]cern when it comes to our beer. We are [CAN]mitted to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the CAN? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop oils that we have worked so hard to retain. If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom - leave them in the [CAN] when pouring. This beer is perishable and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer today, you could be dead tomorrow ... John Kimmich The Alchemist Waterbury, Vemont"; "Don't be a D-Bag. Recycle this CAN!" 
Well, as much as I disdain going against a brewer's/brewery's directions, there is NO way that I am drinking a "World-Class" rated beer directly from the CAN. I used to scoff at those who would mention that a CANned beer tasted "metallic" & caution them to deCANt their beer as opposed to French-kissing it in its vessel. Grr. John Kimmich may be the D-Bag in this case. Calls 'em as I sees 'em. 
I listened closely for the heraldic singing of angels as I Crack!ed this CAN open, but I only got silence & the background whir of my dishwasher. Is it possible that this beer is not the embodiment of The SeCANd Coming? I shall find out! I began with a gentle Glug that raised two fingers of dense, foamy, creamy bone-white head with incredible retention, refusing to fall away. Color was a gorgeous Yellow-Gold, more like Sunshine in my glass than another unnamed, previous beer. Of course, it also called forth The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas & Croesus who assured me that they could hear Sirens, if not angels. Well, s**t! If I have been mistaking the singing of angels for the clarion call of Sirens all of these years, then the onus is on me! We huddled around the glass in a frenzy of ecstatic CANticipation & I have never seen such reverence from these guys. Nose held a resinous, grapefruit-like pungency that seemed to waft upward & straight into our nasal cavities. The CAN seemed to indicate that such would be the case. It was a soft citrusiness, allowing for an underlying biscuity maltiness to also assert itself. Nary a sip had been taken & yet a wave of ecstasy overtook us all. I raised the awaiting chalice & took my first draught to great applause. The mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not as big as in a DIPA, but big for the style. Here we had an iron fist in a velvet glove. The taste was initially light & pleasant with a modest grapefruit citrusiness, but it slowly built to a roaring crescendo that echoed from my sinuses to my eardrums! Gad. It was like having a front-row seat for the orchestra! I remember having done so at The Paramount in Oakland, CA for a screening of "Vertigo" & the orchestra brought me out of my seat at various intervals. The taste of this beer was welling up behind my eyes, causing them to pooch out & giving the impetus to the beer's name. I could almost stand it no longer as I swallowed, allowing the seraphim to enter my belly. I sat back in a satiated state of ecstasy to allow the exbeerience to sink in. The CANQuest (tm) has taken me to the lowest of lows (hear me, Minhas?!?), but this may have been the highest of highs. The dry finish restored my Focal acuity while prompting a bout of sneezing as the Zephyr winds blew across the Sahara Desert in sympathetic response. OMFG. I am spent. Jeez-O, man. CAN this be toppered, er, I mean, Topped? 4,550 characterswoodychandler, Jun 27, 2017

Smell is dank and citrus.
Taste is grapefruit and lemon. Maybe some orange rind. Nice bitter bite on the backend.
Feel is creamy and crushable. Moderate to high carb.

4.6/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into the alchemist IPA glass.  A gold yellow pours in with a large, thick and bubbly head forming.  Giant glaciers of head begin to melt and collapse apart in the glass.  It Peels away leaving lace all along the glass.  Little bubbles rise to the too as hop resins fall to the bottom simultaneously.  Unfiltered and gorgeous. 
Before I was done with the appearance I could smell dank hops.  Super dank, pine, lemon, orange and grapefruit aromas.  Really wonderful nose.  
Orange pith, grapefruit and some lemon peel.  Bittering aftertaste.  Alcohol well masked.  Very balanced, not overpowering like the nose. 
Silky, creamy full bodied IPA.  The body on this is like a stout but drinks so smoothly.  Highly carbed and insanely drinkable.  
Despite the crazy nose and the visible hop residue floating in this Beer it's surprisingly balanced.  Better than heady?  Possibly.  Both are world class and insanely drinkable. 929 charactershaazer, Jun 11, 2017

A - Pours a mildly hazy gold color with some heavy particulate that settled quickly to the bottom of the glass. The head was a rocky/soapy white head of nearly two fingers that dissipated rather quickly. (3.75)
S - Sweet citrus (orange, tangerine, grapefruit), melon, gooseberry and moderate sticky pine pop on the nose. Soft and delicate, yet impactful. (4.5)
T - The aroma carries through onto the palate with aplomb. Sweet and fruity that ends with some sticky pine and then transitions to a citrus rind dryness. (4.5)
M - This is perhaps the beer's highlight...soft and creamy on the mouth with just enough lingering citrus rind bitterness to have you coming back for more. (5.0)
O - Although a rather quick study, this beer is all about balance and it achieves that in spades. Although I've heard it said (even by employees at the brewery) that this is better than Heady Topper, my jury is still out to pasture. If I were to agree, it is the mouthfeel that would surpass their flagship. In short, Focal Banger is another winner from The Alchemist. Although not easy to obtain (pretty much, brewery only), the $12.50 4-Pack price tag is more than reasonable for such a well-made hoppy beer. (4.75) 1,285 charactersthreeviews, Jun 11, 2017

The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange (grapefruit looking) color. A two finger white foamy head started off and dissipated within about a minute leaving messy foamy lacing clinging to the glass. The smell had a big sweet sticky burst of bitter grapefruit rind, extra lemon/orange rind helps to embed a nice edge. Light grassy tones arrange to balance. The taste was bittersweet sticky citrus weaving into the aftertaste and leaving a wet grapefruit bitter finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation seemed good for the style and for me allowing the bitterness to take effect of the harshness on my tongue. Overall, hot damn, everything is in place to be the best AIPA on the market. This one may have eluded me for so long but now I want this all of the time. 937 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 05, 2017

Taste: all of the big citrus fruits- grapefruit, orange, and mandarins standing out. Finishes with moderately bitter, dank, piney hops. 
Feel: I'd say oily feel but slightly dry. Leaves a resiney, bitter hop aftertaste at the roof of my mouth. 
Overall: A special occasion IPA. I prefer this hop formula over Heady. Australian tropical hops are hot now, but I still appreciate Citra and Mosaic IPAs. 598 charactersmnbuffalo, May 21, 2017

second half
Pungent citrus aroma just explodes from the second I opened. Tropical citrus oranges, tangerines, pineapples with grapefruit rind. Piney/grassy notes as well..maybe some melon and lime but Bright, Sharp, overwhelming citrus/tropical fruit! Like Z. D. on steroids 
Tastes like tangerine, grapefruit rind, pineapple, and other tropical fruits...again pungent and overripe maybe?
Dank with some piney/grapefruit bitterness
leafy hop flowers..citra & mosaic for sure!
Just poured into my Hoppin Frog snifter
bright orange but not hazy
suspended hop/yeast particles floating everywhere
looks like an unfiltered homebrew!
Medium light carbonation. I almost want to call it a juice bomb but it's bitter and piney with not much other than pale malts in the brackground.
It's delicious ..glad I traded for it for sure 888 charactersNMA, May 13, 2017

A: Medium gold with orange highlights - hazy with some suspended sediment chunks (a characteristic it shares with Heady) - pours with a medium size white head, fades to a nearly solid cap, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: Have you ever smelled Citra and Mosaic before? Well, if so, imagine the best possible result - bursting with bright, ripe citrus, tangerine, orange, grapefruit flesh and juice - floral citrus and hints of lime - sharp pine needles and some resin - dank and woodsy - some tropical aromas, mango, melon, passion fruit - some tropical pine - some grass - pale malts at the base
T: Juicy without just being a juice bomb, which is admirable - big amounts of tangerine, orange, grapefruit flesh and juice - floral citrus and some citrus zest, touches of pith - dank, weedy, herbaceous notes - leafy hop cones - resinous pine - tropical pine (Mosaic) - some tropical flavors, melon, mango, cantalope, but the citrus really dominates - clean, pale, fairly neutral malt base
M: Medium body, smooth with a touch of oil, medium carbonation, dry finish
O: Step 1: Focus. Step 2: Bang
I've had this a few times in the past and I have been eager to sit down with a can to over-analyze. My overall verdict fits with my initial impressions; Focal Banger is absolutely delightful. It shares a lot with Heady, but it's an entirely different beast, and it may be even easier to drink. Focal, like Heady, is a sweet spot between the now-trendy East Coast juice and classic West Coast hop bomb. Win. 1,522 charactersangrybabboon, May 02, 2017

Pours semi hazy with a frothy carbonated head. Looks pretty bubbly. Juicy fruit and mango. Not a totally a total juice bomb, but certainly highlights it. Pine an resin  with a light malt bill. Taste is fruity and piney with subtle fruit undertones. Mouthfeel has low carbonation and a strong resinous hop bite.

4.26/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Drank it from the can, but it tastes cloudy.  I'm giving it a 4 for the can art.  
Big hops in the nose: orange, pine, grapefruit.  
Nice hoppy taste that follows the nose.  Orange, heavy pine resin, decent malt backbone.  There's a juicy burst on the backend and a pithy bitterness in the aftertaste with sort of a dry puckering finish.
Medium bodied with a soft, pillowy mouthfeel with a slight prickliness.
Delicious. 425 charactersthebeers, Apr 24, 2017

One of the more intense single IPAs on the market! Lots of flavor above and beyond most DIPAs these days, lots of complexity balanced with some decent bitterness and being super crushable! A truly awesome beer! 467 charactersJohnnyMc, Apr 17, 2017

4.16/5  rDev -9%look: 1.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25This beer has more ups and downs than a roller coaster, certainly an experience worthy of review.
Look is atrocious, it looks like someone blew their nose in a Coors Light, or to be less disgusting a well shaken snow globe.   I know I know "DRINK FROM THE CAN" but you cant properly assess look and aroma from the confines of a 16 ounce can.
Aroma doesn't hit all the right notes either.  Smells like someone farted on a fruit salad.  Is it more fart than fruit?  Not sure, it's certainly unique.
Taste, well the most important category knocks it completely out of the park, it's fresh, crisp pear, cantaloupe, blueberry,... dank.   Everything for everybody an incredible taste, washes down a little bitter but flavors persist, Shocked to see such a disparity between nose and taste.  The dirty gaseous fusel fruity bogus-ness vanishes and a delicious flavors takes its place, complex and GREAT! 898 charactersMikeyBadnews, Apr 16, 2017

Took the higher price plunge to try 6 different highly rated Alchemist, Fiddlehead, and Lawson's.
Not disappointed at all, although cannot continue to spend $$$$$ on getting them here.
Focal banger is locally banging my mind.  Solid IPA, 7% really, wow, just a quafftastic drink.  The smell is unreal.
Need an Alchemist hop candle.  
Overall I need more, and fast, but that comes with a price.
Don't really need to describe the true taste, plenty of near perfect reviews on here. 597 charactersProperGlassesNeeded, Apr 11, 2017

It is visually stunning! The perfect color. I imagine that the brewer doesn't want you to see the collection of "Beer Floaties" ( yeast? ), but I think it only adds to the value of the brew. 
It has a tremendous taste. Very full in flavor. I don't really taste the mix of all the tropical fruits that others claim. Just a very bold IPA that is crisp, extremely well balanced and not at all bitter. 499 charactersIMWizzy, Apr 03, 2017

4.4/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, no can dating. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/grassy/citrus peel/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, red grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, cracker, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; with an amazing malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, bready/grainy/creamy/sticky, and lightly resinous/rindy mouthfeel that is insane. Perfectly balanced. Zero warming alcohol for 7%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity/earthy hop and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and pretty refreshing to drink. Super dank and fairly juicy on hops; just enough malt for bitter balance, with minimal residual sweetness. One of the smoothest IPAs I’ve ever drank. It gets quite resinous/drying through the glass; but still remains very crisp, drinkable, and never astringent. A really delicious and highly impressive offering all around. 2,267 characterssuperspak, Apr 01, 2017

A golden-orange hazy color with a modest white head that settled into a firm cap.   Serious floaties that entertained me. Aromas included berries, grapefruit, mango, and a touch of bready malt. Not a blast of aroma (unsure on the canning date) but very nice. I had big expectations going into the first sip, and this did live up to the hype. Nicely balanced juicy citrus, berries, resin, and faint crackery malt. Love the juxtaposition of the citrus/dank in the one. Firmly bitter and clean on the finish with a slick feel. 567 charactersBuck89, Mar 27, 2017

That's honestly the only knock you can really have on this beer, and it's the part I care about the least. This beer has  great mouth feel, and that perfect combo of Mosaic and Citra. Arguably better than Heady, but it depends on my mood haha 399 charactersJrodsmrs51, Mar 19, 2017
4.58/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful hazy orange-gold IPA, topped by a thick foamy snow-white head. Outstanding head retention, leaving behind blotchy patches of lacing.
Peppery herbal aroma, with light notes of mandarin orange, pineapple, flowers, and mango, along with a sweet pale malt base.
Crisp and thickly hoppy on the palate; fabulously clean. Chewy creamy body, yet still lively, really allowing you to savor the waves of hops. Fruit up front, more tropical but with a hint of citrus - mango, star fruit, and pineapple, balanced against light lemon and a hint of grapefruit rind (notably so on the finish). As the waves continue, the tropical fruit flavors grow in strength, adding a dank, earthy sweetness that complements and never overwhelms.
Somehow, the bitterness balances out the entire package, allowing the pale malt to just barely make an appearance, and lending a semi-dry finish to the sip - a remarkable contrast to the creamy body.
The Alchemist may as well be the old guard of the modern IPA, but this is as good as - if not better than - anything the new brewers at Trillium and Tree House are putting out.  Really a fantastic, flavor-packed, and unbelievably creamy IPA.
As expected with these hops (Citra and Mosaic), the dank flavors recede with time. Depending on your preference for hop profiles, you should drink this beer at the appropriate time. For me, 2-3 weeks is better than fresh. 1,396 charactersRoguer, Mar 19, 2017

Look- Pours a transparent brilliant gold leaving a couple fingers of frothy white lingering foam. Heavy lacing is left in it's wake and many floaties can be seen. 
Smell- Passion fruit, grapefruit, fresh rubber and some floral. 
Taste- Passion fruit, mango, grapefruit, fresh rubber and floral esters in the finish along with a kiss of malt. 
Feel- Resiny slick and creamy with a crisp, slightly bitter dry finish. 
Overall- It may not look as pretty as Heady when poured in a glass, but it delivers on every other level. A wonderful array of citrus and floral with a magnificent drinkability. I wish I could drink this every day! 825 charactersPrager62, Mar 12, 2017

Aroma isn't as strong as I would have expected but it is complex; I get pine, citrus, stone fruit, and tropical fruits. Taste hits the same notes as the aroma; pine upfront, tangerine, grass, smooth mango, and some nectarine. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Quite a tasty beer, I preferred the Heady that I had last night but this isn't far behind. 446 charactersmnj21655, Mar 11, 2017

It was after a few Tree House Beers and this one came across as excessively bitter and harsh.  I have since had it on a fresh palate and like it a lot.  It is assertively hopped and more bitter than other Alchemist beers but still nicely balanced.  It is a palate wrecker and you will have trouble properly judging any beers consumed immediately after.  Personally, I like Heady better but that is what makes this all so much fun.  Try one if you can. 528 charactersKidDoc, Mar 08, 2017

4.45/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured half the can into a glass and got a hazy gold colored brew with a ton of sediment floating around in it which looked like a snow globe and went up to a 2 finger thick foamy/cloudy bright white colored head that was packed with bubbles of all sizes, dissipating very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing that slides down the glass, some sticking around.
Smells of pineapple, lemon, tangerine and grapefruit up front, with biscuits and grains coming through for a second before a wave of floral hops kick in that reminded me of dry weed, German hops like Saaz, fresh cut grass, peppery spices, some tropical fruit and trailing piney hops. There's an odd potpourri that took a little bit away from those other lovely hop aromas, otherwise it was top notch for a regular IPA.
Tastes like it smells but with a lot more floral notes, like dry hops, tea leaves, herbs and chalky yeast. It almost seems like spruce tips or something very earthy is in the mix, dulling some of the citrus notes out as this hop struggle goes back and forth. It's more floral and herbal, but still complex and full of citrus hop notes. Not nearly as smooth as Heady Topper, but still a hop bomb for sure.
Mouthfeel is full but on the smooth side with average to light carbonation, a medium body as well as a medium level of bitterness, and nice balance for such a hoppy brew which covers up the ABV masterfully. 
I drank most from the can and I must say that I liked it better from the glass. From the glass it seemed to open up the fruit flavors and not seem so floral like dirty plants were dipped in the beer along with some Windex. Overall it was very good and enjoyable, but I disagree with John Kimmich here...drink from the glass, not the can. 1,734 charactersCHickman, Feb 23, 2017

Aroma is citrusy, resinous, with lots of pine too. Pretty dank smelling.
The taste is resinous, piney and has a lot of citrus rind to it as well.  Fresh tasting and refreshing IPA with loads of flavor.
Full bodied, well carbonated and a bit chalky due to the floaters.  Satisfying hoppy finish.
This is a raw beer, simply put.  The appearance is not the best, but the beer scores highly in other categories.  I heard stories of people filtering out the floaters themselves, and I can see why.  Still, it is a very tasty, intense and drinkable beer. 666 charactersStinkypuss, Feb 21, 2017

A: The body is glowy yellow, being translucid until I poured the end of the can, where lots of yeast turned the beer very solid, aspect-wise. But until that, perfect. The head was one to two fingers thick, white.
S: Focal's aroma is a more northeast aroma, having a less fruity and malty tones to get instead a earthy, resinous and fruitless aromas. So this beer's presents itself being more green than expected, but still shows a fantastic pillar to activate taste buds. It's very good indeed.
T: On the mouth, it has a fruity beginning of citrus, turning and having a very good connection with the hops bitterness, coming from the citrus. There's also a big grassy and resinous profile here again.
M: Body is medium to medium high. Carbonation is perfect. Bitterness is high.
O: Amazing. 815 charactersjoaopmgoncalves, Feb 20, 2017

Deep hop complexity is complemented by the Alchemist's signature malt balance. Minor points against because the loose sediment is a turnoff for some. I'm just glad it's not  so murky I can't shine a flashlight through it. Then again,  perhaps this is a moot point considering one is supposed to "drink from the can!" 414 charactersa_andersen, Feb 16, 2017

Reviewed as: American IPA 
Misc.: No COD; Did not drink out of the can like it said
Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Was really looking forward to this one, having head Heady Topper a few times. Thinking this would have to be in the 4.50 range.
Poured a light yellow hazy color with three fingers of rocky white head. Lots of light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good foamy spotty lacing. Excellent foamy retention. (Sight - 4.00)
Smelled juicy mix of citrus and tropical from the first whiff. Got Citra up front, followed by grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, subdued Mosaic, melon, mango, pine and herbal. Started out awesome, but flavor escaped rather quickly. (Smell - 4.25)
Tasted slightly better and more flavorful than the nose. Really and extension of the first whiffs. Got Citra, mango, pineapple, grapefruit pulp, bitter tangerine peel, melon, sharp pine, subdued Mosaic, herbal and hints of menthol. Tastes maybe even more than the 7 pct. ABV. (Taste - 4.50)
Medium body. Oily texture. Lively-to-fizzy carbonation. Juicy bitter finish. (Feel - 3.75)
This was a very good IPA overall, but not as good as advertised in my opinion. (Overall - 4.25)

4.49/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a light hue somewhere between yellow and orange with a layer of haze and fog to it. Head formation is two fingers, with an aggressive start, and a conservative finish. Foaming action of the head is easily controlled. Great head retention followed by great lacing left behind after each sip. Off to a strong start. Aroma is citrus, papaya, and mango. Malts are well hidden, keeping the aroma centered on citrusy hops with little divergence from the bulls-eye. Flavor profile is a smooth induction of light citrusy hops, with not much else to finish it. It's very one dimension in that the flavor profile is all delicate citrus hops, and yet it refrains from being bitter or unbalanced. There is a hint of biscuit malts in the back. Mouth feel opens thin, with a feel that gets a little fizzy and thicker as the beer warms on the palate. Overall, a slightly fizzy, but otherwise smooth IPA. It drinks much smaller then a 7% IPA, and yet has plenty of powerful flavor. Nicely constructed and executed. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 1,032 charactersHarrison8, Feb 05, 2017

4.96/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I’ve drunk quite a bit of Focal Banger before, so I’m coming to this review with a fair amount of bias, but I’m trying to approach it as though I’m drinking it for the first time. Also, as a writer who cares a lot about “authorial intent,” I’m extending that concept to “brewer’s intent” and drinking it out of the can. So there:)
Since I’m deferring to Mr. Kimmich’s wishes and drinking from the can, I can’t comment too much on appearance, although the drops that cling to the lip of the can when I remove it from my lips are golden straw in color. The aroma is singular; I’ve literally never smelled beers like the Alchemist’s—something like bright grapefruit/lemon rind, but with a simmering piney dankness underneath. The mere smell makes the tongue seize up a little in anticipation, like it knows something special is about to cross it. So many times, one looks for words other than “hops” to describe a beer’s smell, but one gets the feeling that Focal is somehow a Platonic expression of hops; i.e., if someone were to ask, “what do hops taste like?”, you could just hand them a Focal. Which kind of covers the taste aspect, although there’s an astringent, almost tannic aftertaste that I really love. It’s quite different from a beer like Swish, whose taste disappears almost completely upon drinking. The taste of Focal lingers long; for me, almost an hour after drinking. Mouthfeel-wise, it’s sort of a 360-degree attack on the inside of the mouth, not so much effervescent as needle-y, not subtle at all. But very pleasing, even welcome. It makes many other NE IPAs, especially the haze bombs, seem wimpy and soft. 
Overall, this is one of my favorite beers, maybe even my favorite single IPA. Also, for whatever reason, it doesn’t matter how many of these I drink, I’m never hungover afterward. (Same with Heady, which makes me wonder about the Alchemist’s brewing process and/or water.) Do whatever you can to obtain it at least once. 2,005 charactersJayORear, Feb 03, 2017

When you pop the can, it's just like opening up a pack of fresh hops. There is so much citrus and dank green hop aromas going on. Can't see what it looks like cuz I drank it straight from the can as instructed but the artwork is killer and top notch. Tastes great. So much ripe dank hop goodness. After this and a Heady Topper previous to this one, the alcohol is going straight to my head. 
This is really an awesome beer. Glad I made the pilmagrige to the Alchemist today. John is really running a top-notch operation. Cheers! 586 charactersjwhancher, Jan 31, 2017

Taste is bitter, but juicy. Like biting into a grapefruit, pith and all. Moderately carbed with a semi-dry finish. Overall, fanfuckingtastic. Per usual, drink fresh. (Had a case and after a few weeks the flavors fade noticeable, though the bitterness reamins.) 537 charactersmoose1980, Jan 24, 2017

I'm walking through a rainforest just minutes after rainfall. In a small, misty clearing there's a bowl of fresh, local fruit. Focal Banger tastes like I imagine how that would smell.  
I heard the hype. I heard the praise. I thought it would be good, knew it would be good. Heck I knew it would be great. Did not expect it to be as wonderful as it was. 
It surpasses the reputation it has. Find a way to get your hands on this one folks... 520 charactersweakascheese, Jan 23, 2017

S- earthy, green, resin-y, tropical fruits for day, stone fruit in particular.
T- resin, hops and earth dominate the front palate for me.  mid palate has a sweetness that is welcome.  it finishes with a classic IPA bitterness.  
F- great depth, thick, carbonation is good and strong.  Especially out of the can it come alive blowing the hop flavors into your sensory.
O- This is a classic IPA and my second from Alchemist.  Really very impressed with the depth of character in their beers,  Definitely wish they got the beer outside of VT.  The suggestion to drink it out of the can is spot on as I tried both (for the sake of science of course) and out of the can the carbonation is held longer which has the effect of pushing the flavors, especially the hop/resin notes up into the olfactory... killer beer, can't wait to go back!!! 912 charactersdadplusbeer, Jan 13, 2017

Drank half/half can and glass. It pours as expected- some particulates, slightly hazy and juicy-looking. 
The aroma from both the can and glass was solid, if a bit muted. Fruit salad with a touch of vinaigrette.
The flavor is a grand slam. We've done it- humanity has created the perfect IPA. Mild melon flavors, complemented perfectly with a pineapple bite and flowery, dandelion, moderately bitter finish. This has it all in perfect harmony.
The flavors ride on the wave of the Alchemist's perfect, proprietary mouthfeel, like a light piece of yellow cake. Just a touch of sweetness.
This beer is overwhelming. It's nearly perfect. 738 charactersstonermouse, Jan 12, 2017

The smell is immediately striking you right after opening - herbal, hoppy, fruity (quince, grapefruit, pineapple,) and a bit flowery. So is the taste, with an overall pleasant bitter feel. It has a balance in it that's not so easy to attain.
I think it's a reference beer for the IPA fans.

01/08/2017
Drank most from the can as suggested.   Poured the middle third into a snifter to better assess aroma and appearance.
LOOK:  clear yellow color, small white head.  
AROMA:  tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, 
TASTE:  some floral and and fruity notes, but mostly dry hair spray.  
FEEL:  good carbonation, light to medium body, easy drinking.
I thought i was starting to understand some of the ipa craze, but this is one beer I thought I would really like, but I think it is only ok.  It is certainly not bad, the mosaic hops give it decent flavor, but not what I would expect from the 30th highest rated beer on BA.

Pours hazy like Heady but slightly less so. Bright white head is aggressive if you don't pour carefully. Absolutely massive hop bomb in the aroma. Dry hopped for days. Stinky pineapple and peach, a little melon as well. Flavors combine those with orange citrus and bitter pith. Some pine in the back end as you swallow and take in the crisp mouthfeel that includes some malt creaminess. Superb. 529 charactersdd43, Jan 08, 2017

Nice, light orange color and slightly hazy appearance with a white two finger head.  Loads of pine, resin, yeast, and papaya aromas.  Some lemon, orange and dankness breaks through as it warms in the glass.  Flavors totally mirror the aroma with hoppy bitterness and subtle fruit sweetness.   Nice, hoppy bitterness lingers for some time.  Great IPA! 420 charactersremingtonsteele1987, Jan 07, 2017

4.03/5  rDev -11.8%look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Drank first couple of sips from the can out of respect and finished in a glass. 
Look: "curdled" comes to mind. Heavy clumps of particles floating and accumulating at the bottom of the glass
Smell: pleasant but very muted. 
Taste: similar to smell, this was very enjoyable but somewhat more subtle than I had expected based on the BA reviews. Noted the typical citrus flavors with a little more balance/spice than what is typical of IPAs from that region.
Feel: the highlight of this beer for me - very drinkable and smooth with a pretty full mouth-feel
Overall: enjoyed but underwhelmed. If this was local, I'd likely stock the fridge but would not seek out through trade again. Shipped fresh but consumed after Swish - this may have contributed to my experience. Will open a 2nd can soon and revisit. 802 charactersDatdubj1988, Jan 07, 2017

Smell: As soon as I popped the can I got a WOW nose full of fruits in the orange family.  The more I smell this drink I notice more lemon in it.
Taste: Mostly lemon and there were some peachy notes to it.
Feel: A very tickle-y feeling in my mouth.  It felt for me to be more of a kick from the fruit aspect of the drink (every part of this drink) as opposed to a high alcohol content to it.
Overall: Would only recommend to drink this if you really enjoy fruit drinks.  Overall, I feel that The Alchemist makes better drinks then this and I would recommend to look elsewhere if you're considering to purchase this beverage.  That's just my two cents though. 750 charactersh0wdy, Jan 06, 2017

4.4/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Nose just barely hints at the peachy stone fruit melange that is to come, providing a seamless transition from aroma to flavor.
Tangerine/lemon-lime/pine bomb blows up the palate. Big, juicy stone fruit up front, and then almost minty with cool, herbaceous hops. Pretty stiff bitterness, although not as much as Heady. Hints of guava, peach and papaya emerge as it opens up and the palate softens. Second time around reveals some big, savory onion/garlic notes.
Full, yet dry in body. Some mouth coating resin. Some of the tropical flavors that are reminiscent of Sip of Sunshine, but without the sweetness.
Overall, this is a real serious hoppy treat that continues to unfurl its flavor as it warms in the glass. At turns, deeply piney, deeply bitter, and deeply pink-fruit tropical. Clearly all about the hops, with no malts getting in the way. 849 charactersMongrel, Jan 05, 2017

L:  A super hazy medium amber orange color with huge chunky floaties. I had the can stored upside down which obviously led to the massive yeast.  Nice lacing. 
S:  Huge citrus, tropical fruit and alcohol on the nose.  Some sweet biscuit malt. 
T:  Loads of fruity hops with huge tropical fruit, citrus and stone fruit.  Mango, guava, pineapple, peach, melon, grapefruit, just a fruit assault on the mouth.  The sweetness is there but biscuit and bready like with a huge full semi dry finish. Alcohol pokes through and mixes with some slight pine.  Great beer.
M:  Full, coating, prickly and alcoholic.  Nice carbonation. 
O:  A fantastic beer!  Is it better than Heady?  To me, not quite since it shows more alcohol, but still it's a world class beer. Awesome. 817 charactersKadonny, Jan 01, 2017

This beer has been a big "hype" and I really looked forward to try it. 
For the sake of it I have to tell you that i DID also drink from the can as stipulated! 
Well, it is great but it’s not meeting my expectations. 
Nowadays the brewers are getting better and better and a great IPA today is a F*cking Amazing IPA a few years ago.

4.51/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have to agree with many of the reviewers that this beer is better than heady. For me, it's way better! Focal Banger has more balance with the fruitiness (I taste a lot of peach) working well with a sustained bitterness. I find it pretty smooth/drinkable. Really enjoyed this one! 281 charactersELS, Dec 30, 2016
4.27/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a teku pint.  No freshness date.
A- Pours a slightly hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of surface foam.  Sticky resilient lacing.
S- Juicy floral hop aroma that's a bit sweet brings to mind papaya, peach and mango.  Also a bit of earthy yeast character.
T- Assertive bitterness dominates with a decent amount of hop flavor accompanying.  Bright and citrusy but also very dry.   ABV is hidden decently well.
M- Very sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a lightish body.
O- Not sure why everyone's saying this is better than Heady.  Unless I'm dealing with a not-so-fresh can (still have no clue as to why they don't provide canning dates), this falls short of Heady by a wide margin.  Too much bitterness without enough actual hop flavor to back it up.  Maybe my expectations were a bit high but, even with that taken into consideration, I still wouldn't call this any more than "very good." 1,032 charactersImmortale25, Dec 30, 2016

Haziness is there, but nothing like some of the beers coming from TH.  Smells of pine and pot.  Taste is a bit light for my taste... nothing stood out distinctly.  The bitterness lingered, although not overwhelming.  Medium-light body with perfect carbonation.  I prefer its bigger brother, but this was an absolutely wonderful treat. 450 characterszizouandyuki, Dec 28, 2016

Appearance: Dark gold, getting towards orange-y, bubbly and moderate white head, mildly hazy (can see the shadow of my fingers through the glass)
Nose: More "juicy" than Heady, orange, juicy grapefruit pulp, sweetness, some light dank
Taste: Same wonderful carbonation, more sweet fruit that is balanced out by a subtle lingering bitterness on the finish (which both Focal and Heady seem to have)
I'd rather have Focal Banger than Heady any day of the week. 530 charactersaac5269, Dec 25, 2016

4.49/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. Drank from the can countless times, but I had to pour it for appearance and aroma! Purchased at the brewery. 
Lots of sediment in this can, golden body with a frothy white head that leaves a ton of retention and lacing, just how I remember alchemist beers. 
Aromas are piney and citrusy, floral with the distinct alchemist creamy malt. Taste matches the nose with a lightly bitter aftertaste. More citrusy and floral than heady topper with lots of pine and creamy malt. Medium carbonation and body. 
A classic masterpiece. 567 charactersgcamparone, Dec 24, 2016

Thanks Mark for passing a few cans my way. Focal Banger sports a grimey golden body verging on tarnished bronze. It looks mildly hazy but upon closer inspection there's a nearly infinite number of floaties suspended throughout the body. The foam grows to a finger on the pour and recedes fairly quickly to a skimming and ring. A spot or two of lace is left clinging to the glass after each drink but it falls right back into the body.
The nose is bright and vibrant. Tropical notes that are a little tough to pick out specifically are equally intermingled with forest floor and parmesan cheese rind, a little dank and funky in the hop department.  Sweaty. Underripe mango and dried apricot make their presence known over the top of a softly sweet candied malt base with a caramel swirl. The nose certainly is inviting.
The dried apricot and peppery mango kick it off while a wave of unidentifiable tropical fruits was through the middle. The dank and funkiness come through in the middle. It's got that loamy/pine needle thing going on with that sharp parmesan cheese rind leading into the sugar cookie sweetness. There is a swirl of caramel and a touch of honey but the malt base is pretty clean.
The body weighs in at moderate with a lively carbonation. The bubbles make it feel lighter overall. It's spritzy on the back of the tongue with a bitterness that falls just short of moderate. The finish is fairly dry and it leaves me wanting another drink. This is an easy one to put away, that's for sure.
There's a reason you're supposed to drink this beer from a can. It's unappealing. The nose is bright and vibrant and it's pungent and dank on the palate. An easy beer to put away. I'd happily drink some more of these in the future. Thanks again, Mark! 1,770 charactersjoe1510, Dec 21, 2016

bar tender poured it into a wine glass but left a few ounces left in the can
not sure what there is to say about this that hasn't already been said but i was excited to try it.
i didn't intensely scan it, but i didn't see any floaties that a number of reviews have mentioned.
with all the dankness, bitterness I loved how smooth it was. nice medium mouthfeel.  crisp.  really bright and lively feeling of freshness.
its an intense beer that i thoroughly enjoyed, i'd gladly drink it again if i could find it.  hopefully they are more available at bars in NYC now! 642 charactersc_tails, Dec 11, 2016

4.91/5  rDev +7.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Alchemist Focal Banger
A: This single IPA from the legendary Vermont brewery that arguably started the NE IPA craze pours a pale, lightly hazy golden yellow. Lacing is excellent, and the two fingers of virgin snow head stick around forever, eventually settling into a densely-packed half finger of foam. This would be a perfect appearance of it were not for the ridiculous levels of yeasty, hoppy detritus; it looks like a beer snow globe as it is tossed around by the above average carbonation, and if it all were to settle, there would be over a finger of sediment at the bottom. Many will find this off-putting, and it is less aesthetically pleasing than the truly hazy (as opposed to packed with chunks on chunks on chunks of floaties) NE IPAs that have come around since The Alchemist (arguably) first broke that ground. 3.5/5
A: Even though this uses two of the fruitiest hops around in Mosaic and Citra, what wafts from the glass and empty can is pure, resinous dankness. Pine, grass, pungent marijuana, and earthy spiciness lead the way, but it is not all brutality. Juicy grapefruit, orange flesh, citrus peel, bitter pith, white grapes, blueberries, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, lemon, and lime. Lightly honeyed malt is hardly present at all, as this is a clear showcase for the hops and nothing else. 5/5
T: Shockingly, the flavor comes off significantly fruitier up front than the aroma led on, but the balance remains impeccable. Candied pineapple, juicy mango, orange, white grapes, white grape skin, tangerine, clementine, papaya, passion fruit, ruby grapefruit, mandarin, lemon, lime, and blueberries are all noticeable. There is a surprising amount of sweetness that really makes the fruitiness pop. Building throughout each sip is that moderately high dank, piney, earthy bitterness, which had added a hint of garlic and onion to cover basically every hop flavor possible. Truly a magnum opus of hoppiness. 5/5
M: Continuing perfection, Focal is on the lighter side of medium, yet it still comes off creamy, slick, and slightly sticky. The finish is almost entirely dry with the above moderate bitterness. Carbonation is moderate, right where it should be. Each sip remains interesting for the duration and beckons for another drink. Wonderful. 5/5
O: For my money, no single IPA is better than this. Some are equal (Hill Farmstead offerings mainly), but apart from the comparably lackluster appearance, there are no flaws to be found here. This beer contains the best of both sides of the IPA spectrum and everything in between in aroma, taste, and mouthfeel. It is bitter enough to satisfy West Coast hop heads yet juicy enough to hang with the best NE IPAs. Additionally, this is also better than Heady Topper thanks to the more svelte malt bill (which also helps it crush The Crusher). The Alchemist is still king, accept no substitutes. Pair with the similarly ahead of its time high watermark "Obscura" by the inimitable Gorguts. 5/5 2,970 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Dec 04, 2016

Can't review the look because it's supposed to be drunk from a can but the smell is very intense and pungent hop notes with citrusy characteristics. This beer strikes the perfect balance between flavor and carbonation. Shyttt is bomb 354 charactersbigdaddymick, Dec 02, 2016

Pours a very hazy orangey golden color with a bunch of thing suspended in the beer.  Smell is generalized citrus with grapefruit predominating.  Whereas Heady had the more complex smell, this one has the more complex taste.  Taste follows right along with smell.  Citrus yet it has a dry finish and is not at all sweet.  Very balanced and not overly bitter on the back end.  Feel is medium.  Overall this is a great beer, mostly due to the hop profile.  Classic NE IPA. 527 charactersAmguerra305, Nov 19, 2016

A - Pours a hazy medium gold color with a very frothy, white, creamy head.  Carbonation is moderate and steady.
S - Weak nose.  Herbally, yeasty, with some citrus.  The nose is nothing special. (Contrary to the label art.)
T - Balanced from start to finish.  Citrus, grapefruit, yeasty, some spicy citrus rind and ends with some moderate piney/citrus bitterness.
M - Heavy medium body with light prickly carbonation that quickly gives way to a creamy finish.
O - This is a really solid beer but a "100" rating is over-stated. 586 charactersjzeilinger, Nov 12, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5(October 2016) Everybody loves a good citra-mosaic mashup, so it's not surprising that the Alchemist has one. The aroma on this one is pretty bright in the way you'd expect, and the taste is awesome, bursting with citra-mosaic goodness. The thing that really puts Kimmich's beers over the top, in my opinion, is the nice malt balance he gives the beers; they've all got substance that really adds to the fresh hop flavors.
In terms of look, this is probably the only beer that I can genuinely see an argument for drinking out of the can. I'll still always drink it out of a glass, but the sediment in the Focal can is thick enough that it's genuinely off-putting. Not really a mark against the beer (outside of literally when I'm ranking beers based on look), but I can see the argument here.
Either way, this is the beer I'd always get, were I at the Alchemist. Tastier than Heady, and slightly less bitter than Crusher, this is a new favorite of mine. All 3 are great beers, but Kimmich really hit it out of the park with this one.
Note - I've raised the "look" category to a 4.5 to reflect the fact that that portion of the rating drops the beer down slightly more overall than it deserves. The look is at best a 4.25 to me (if that), but since this is one of my top 5 DIPAs all-time (to date), there's no reason to let the look get in the way. 1,350 charactersSeanBond, Nov 07, 2016

Solid , creamy three finger white foam head. Could float a bottle cap on it. Great  lacings. Translucent yellow orange with loads of micro carbonation. One yeast thread clings new the bottom of the glass. Hence the instructions to drink it from the can. 
Great aroma , smell orange citrus when I pop the can. More citrus on the pour
First sip from the the can tastes of citrus and pine hops.  Orang and citrus hops dominate from the glass pour. 
Suds up very well , creamy smooth, a hop bite that lingers on the tongue.

Look: I'm going to try to overlook the chunks of floating sediment. Beer comes in a light golden color with medium to medium minus haze. Nice even bubble structure but not much head.
Smell: Can definitely tell this is a derivative of Heady of Topper. Less Pine than Heady.  The lemongrass which was very much in the background with Heady is the predominant aroma here along with that wonderful yeastiness that I got in Heady Topper as well. It also has a nice herbal/mintyness.
Taste: Very refreshing. Lots of citrus but it's pithy as opposed to juicy. A little pine on the back end but it is still just hitting me with over the top pithy bitterness. 
Feel: Not the thinnest IPA I've ever had but I would not call this beer creamy.
Overall(Style points): While this beer screams Alchemist its not as much of a juice bomb as I was hoping for. 91 Points. 1,068 charactersMikeyMcD86, Nov 05, 2016

4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Nosed from the can, it's straight pine and marijuana.  Poured into two separate teku glasses (yes, yes, I know, flaunting the instructions on the can), we see a hazy orange beer, with a one-finger white head.  Nosed from the teku, it's dank as dank can be.  This beer smells like pure marijuana, in a way that is unlike any DIPA I've ever tried before.  The palate......wait.  Wut?  This beer tastes like week.  I think they replaced humulus lupulus with cannabis for this canning.  Pine and weed blend in an incredibly savory beer, accented by a faint undercurrent of honey-sweetness from marginal malt addition.  Mouthfeel is solid medium.
I'm pretty sure this beer could be poured into a bong, smoked, and would induce a high.  This beer is unique.  Unlike anything I've tried before (even The Crusher and Heady Topper don't have the same bold MJ note of this beer).  It's singular.  It's incredible.  It's absolutely world class. 934 charactersLAp, Nov 01, 2016

A: Poured a small amount into a glass to rate appearance and drank the rest out of the can. Hazy, yellow-gold in color with a large foamy white head with short retention. Foamy white lacing.
S: Aromas of lemon and citrus fruits. Pineapple and passionfruit. Piney and resinous hops.
T: Starts off with milder notes of grapefruit and melons followed quickly by strong notes of piney, earthy, and resinous hops. Very hop-forward with an extreme lingering bitterness. Tropical fruit notes become more evident as the beer warms.
F: Light to medium bodied, crisp, and fairly dry. Good carbonation.
O: Overall, a great IPA. Straight hop bomb. Love all the hops, but the fruitiness that comes forth as the beer warms is a refreshing balance. Would love to try this fresh from the source. I did try another can earlier and remember enjoying it much more than this, but I didn't write review notes for that one. 967 charactersBeerGuy8315, Oct 29, 2016

Palate Contaminants: none
The look is a slightly opaque, light gold with plenty of head.
The smell is pistachios and mango, mostly. There's a little citrus and a little pine, but they're in the background. It has a really nice balance of savory and sweet.
The taste up front is a blast of tropical fruit, mango and papaya. It's slightly acidic, but it's not particularly citric. From fruit, it turns to moss, then to hoppy bitterness and malt that also has a bit of white wood. It really does show up in phases.
The carbonation is very well integrated. I just wish the aftertaste was more complex, it's just the woody bitterness that's also the last flavor before swallowing. 708 charactersZythophile, Oct 29, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5In a time not so long ago there was a beer called Focal Banger It seems at first, It was only available in local bars and restaurants. Well, being a local, I got used to this.  Then, as quickly as it came, it vanished  from the greater Burlington area. Rumor on the street was that it would be available exclusively at the retail location in Waterbury. After several months of listless pining, I felt I had finally grown to accept this new reality. Nevertheless, I found myself occasionally  compelled to request it at places where Heady Topper appeared on the menu. I knew the anwser, but asked it anyway- perhaps as a sort of symbolic gesture or solemn ode, to the beer that once existed so prominitely in the geography of my daily life. Then suddenly it happened. An anwser I did not expect. From the most unlikely of casual chain dining reauraunts inbetween a movie theatre and Best Buy. Yes. We do have Focal Banger, she replied. In disbelief,  I had to ask the  waitress to repeat this. And she did. And it was true. And she wisked off. Then there it was- that mythical  black and silver can,  all shining and gosaamer. And I drank it. And it was good. And  it reminded me if the old times, when everything was right with the world. 1,238 characterswbizbot, Oct 29, 2016

S: A faint musty or basement smell, along with some onions. Makes me think at first that this can may be dated, but Keith assures me it is not. As it warms, I get more tropical fruit, predominantly of the pineapple variety.
T: Modest malt foundation is stepped on by pine, grass, grapefruit and tropical fruit. Lots going on, but at times I'm not sure it melds together seamlessly. Still, I'm giving this a pretty good score, as it's real tasty. 
M: Medium in heft, with a slight sharpness or bite to it.
O: Very good stuff. I personally prefer Heady, but I'd like to get a few more cans of this under my belt. 690 charactersKendo, Oct 25, 2016

Look:  Except for the golden hue, things are not pretty.  Particulate galore.  I understand the latest hop bombs may result in this appearance, but still a little jarring.
Smell:  A signature Mosaic hop nose, faint honey and herbal notes.
Taste:  Piney bitterness front, a little bit of sweetness/honey in the middle then the piney flavor hits on the back end. Very satisfying.
Feel:  Good for the style, finishes quite dry.
Overall:  Very good brew but I probably don't see this as the top 10 beer that most seem to. 555 charactersNewport_beerguy, Oct 23, 2016

Suggestions of earthy, musky citrus fruit and with herbal pine around the edges, keeping it tight with tongue-clenching bitterness. Medium-light body, ample carbonation, and a clean, crisp feel. Finishes with a craving for me, but here in NY, I'm lucky I even got to try one. I like it more than Heady... 544 charactersGreywulfken, Oct 23, 2016
4.59/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pouring a cellar temp pounder can into a snifter. Guess Im going against the order to drink straight from the can.
The beer is a bright yet slightly hazy gold color with a frothy bleached white head that billows up and over the rim of the glass to a height of 4 cm easy even with a gentle pour.  The foam recedes to some sticky islands and an edge layer. 
The aroma is apparent straight from the pour with all hop with pine notes and citrus dominant, grapefruit and pineapple come up. I also get some general fruit with peaches maybe. 
First sip reveals an average body with fine yet tingly carbonation that prickles my palate on each sip. Flavor is some brief hits of sweet graininess that rolls to a complex hop mash of citrus rind, grass notes and some general astringency.  I also get some tropical fruit but no booze comes through anywhere making this bigger beer extremely drinkable. This is a hop forward complex beer and I really enjoy it.
Definitely worth a shot if you get it and a less aggressive brew than the Heady. 1,028 characterssulldaddy, Oct 23, 2016

A hazy yellowish look with a little over a finger of beautiful white head. Head lasted a while and left a lot of lacing. 
The smell is phenomenal as soon as you open the can. The citrus aroma is everywhere. Grapefruit with pineapple and maybe a little peach in there or mango. 
The taste matches the smell with all of the citrus flavors coming through. The mosaic hops blend superbly with the malt. It seemed like every drink left me wanting one more. 
Fantastic IPA with such a juicy taste. Definitely a world class IPA. I could have this everyday. 656 charactersKdouble, Oct 19, 2016

A:  Hazy pale yellow with 1-2 finger white head.  Lots of floating particles.  If I had regular access to this, I would probably drink from the can.  Decent retention and leaving some moderate lacing.
S:  A punch of citrus aroma hit me as soon as I popped the top on the can.  Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and peaches.
T:  Very citrus forward - tons of pineapple, grapefruit, and mango.  Some pine and plentiful dank hops.
M:  Medium body with average carbonation.  Finish is juicy and lightly bitter.
O:  Excellent IPA.  I'm not sure it's possible to have a single favorite IPA these days with all that's out there, but this would certainly be near the top of my list. 711 charactersrichj1970, Oct 17, 2016

Pours golden, somewhat cloudy.  
Aroma is fantastic, whether in can or glass, like a grapefruit and a mango were interbred to make a fruit better than either.  Don't want to recycle the can, as the smell lingers.
Taste tilts more to the grapefruit, with notes of pine, too.  Intense hops, yet moderately bitter in some moods I could take more bitter, but this is delicious.
Moderate carbonation, suits the flavor profile.  Could drink this all day.
Pretty great beer, up there in the IPA pantheon. 618 charactersprofessorchow, Oct 15, 2016

I drank from the can like it says you should do but I also tasted it from a glass. I think it taste the same from the can and from the glass, but you get more aroma from the glass. Anyway,
Look - It has a Golden color with a thin white head.
Aroma - The aroma wonderful with fruit, citrus, and grapefruit.
Taste - The taste is tropical fruit, grapefruit, mango, there's pine, and it is dank.
Overall - Well carbonated, a bit dry, and it is juicy, just perfect. 552 charactersThomas_Wikman, Oct 14, 2016

careful pour reveals hazy yellow body with persistent small white head, leaving good lacing.

Similar tasting to Crusher, just with more of a grapefruit bite to it. Delicious. 
A tad below full on the mouth. Somewhat bitter grapefruit finish.

Has a slightly hazy orange color with minimal egg white head, no lacing. 
Smells of earthy pine malt, grapefruit, a tad of spice and hops galore. 
Taste of rustic pine, floral happiness, grapefruit and some type of spice. Well balaced and very drinkable, but a tad dry. 
Mouth has a decently juiced approach, with a fairly dry finsih. 
Decent beer overall, not sure if it's at 100 like the scores above, but I would definetly drink this again, but not sure if I would hunt it down. 576 charactersDrinkThemAll, Oct 12, 2016

Pours a heavily hazed pale gold with a lush two-finger head of creamy foam. Retention is good for better than five minutes (I can't wait any longer!) and leaves fat wads of scummy lacing all over the glass. It looks, in short, excellent.
Smells sharp and yeasty, juicy citrus pulp and fresh macerated grassy hops.
Taste is tangerines, grapefruit, sugar cookies and pine needles. Earthy and dank. Finishes with a long, pleasant leafy bitterness.
Feel is medium-bodied, well carbonated and refreshingly dry.
Stupidly good beer. Do I prefer it to a Heady? They're both similar and they're both different. I think I prefer Focal Banger's hop profile but I'm not willing to give up my Headies. Don't make me choose!

Yellow and cloudy with a lot of carbonation.  Topped with 2 fingers of white, foamy head.
The taste is incredible.  Pine and  blueberry gum, sweet and floral and fruity in a berry kind of way, and bitter.  Yes, a big solid bitterness on the finish.
Lots of foamy, frothy carbonation, medium body, and a balance of sweetness with tannic hop finish. Ruby red grapefruit in there too.
Got at the Alchemist a few days ago while travelling through the area.  Drinking Oct 1st, 2016 after 1am.  Amazing brew.  The hops are incredibly fresh, floral, dank and bitter.  Nice sweetness in the balance.  An amazing brew. 713 characterspatre_tim, Oct 01, 2016
4.77/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pour is a semi hazy, medium orange hue. Big frothy head that sticks around for a while, lacing galore. Smell has that same, herby legitimate fresh hop smell that heady has. Mosiac hops shine through over everything, with hints of mango and other various tropical fruit. But the pungency of the hop character stands out over everything. Taste is that same herby, resinous hop character I get in the aroma. Solid amount of citrus rind and a tart buscuit malt character in the back end. Mouthfeel is relatively palate coating, but not quite as thick or oily, or even juicy as heady. Overall, this is a solid IPA. Not as complex as heady, or as tropical or juicy in my opinIon. More sessionable. 691 charactersMateo2699, Oct 01, 2016

4.51/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Gotta say on the front end that the can I enjoyed had some age on it, at least a couple months.  Poured into a tulip but also sampled some directly from the can to compare (from the glass was better).  Light orange body with a thick, bubbly, white head that actually kept building after the pour as bubbles flooded up the sides of the glass.  Beautiful, big-bubble lacing throughout the consumption process.  Not nearly as hazy as I expected, but certainly not clear.  And that's the first of multiple notes of "fantastic but not as unique as I thought it would be."  Smell is extremely pungent, dank, herbal, piney, citrusy, tropical, and grassy.  Some almost herbal notes of green tea, tobacco, and hemp mixed in, as well.  As it warms the dankness drops off just a bit and the bright citrus comes more to the forefront.  Taste is fantastic but, again, not as differentiated from many other big hop bombs that I've had before, and I was absolutely expecting this beer to be in a class of its own.  Juicy, but not nearly as much as Heady, at least to my palette.  Bitter, resinous pine, tart citrus rind, sweet tropical fruit, dank, biscuity cracker.  The bitterness coats your teeth and tongue, with an almost sour quality floating in the background.  Truly delicious, but not overly distinguished from a number of other citra- and/or mosaic-heavy beers I've had over the past year.  Feel is chewy, sticky, thick, and smooth.  You want to somehow simultaneously sip and chug it, the feel is so wonderful.  Poured the last few ounces out with authority so as to enjoy the sea monkeys they produced, and that didn't do any harm to the drinking experience, at all.
So, overall, a wonderful beer, especially if comparing it to IPAs (not IIPAs).   But maybe the hype was just too much.  Admittedly, some of the above "constructive" commentary is relative to Heady, which perhaps isn't fair because they're different beers.  Revisiting my scoring, I've tried to make sure I'm thinking of Focal relative to its category (American IPA, not IIPA), and with that in mind this beer is truly great.  And my god, the post-drinking burbs.  Glorious. 2,138 charactersAmeriCanadian, Sep 29, 2016

Pours hazy golden yellow with minimal head and nice lacing.  
Aroma- citrus forward . Light malt on back end .  
Flavor-  nice combination of up front bitterness and back end smoothness.  I get citra first with malt and mosaic on back end.  
Mouthfeel-  very appropriate for style.  Not as creamy as I expected but still nice
Overall-  I personally enjoy this a lot more than heady topper.  This is not a juice bomb by any means but I love the balanced bitterness coupled with juicy flavor late.  
93/100 overall. 551 charactersjcflorian, Sep 29, 2016

4.51/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours up with ample effervescence which creates a consistent white head that crowns the hazy, golden-ochre body leaving evident lace as it settles. The aromatics are layered with fruitiness (citrus .e.g. grapefruit, pomelo +pineapple), earthiness  (berry, evergreen, pine cone) from the hops & a light-moderate graininess. Flavor starts off lightly bready with a pale maltiness that's quickly cut by an increasing amount of bitterness that somehow manages to stay balanced without becoming harsh. Superbly balanced IPA with an excellent creaminess that carries all those hops. Focal Banger is mind numbing. Cheers! 614 charactersBeertracker, Sep 26, 2016

Hazy orange appearance with a 2 finger white head, great retention and thick lacing on my glass. Aroma is bright with juicy tropical notes. Flavor is very tropical and dank, pineapple, mango, and papaya with hints of berry. Finish is on the bitter side. Feel is medium, well carbonated, and finishes dry. Another outstanding beer from The Alchemist. 379 charactersRi0, Sep 25, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours pale gold and quite hazy, a bit of an orange hue to it.  Large white bubbles on the 2 finger head.  Pretty good retention and nice lacing.
Quite dank aroma.   Pine and citrus in the form of lemon and orange.  Bread dough and caramel malt.  Straw, cut grass, and grapefruit.  
Not much of the pine from the nose shows up in the taste.  Orange and grapefruit.  Some thing floral going to herbal.  Blueberry, honey dew, and pineapple.  Doughy malt, not as strong as the nose but still a strong complement.
Medium body with medium carbonation.  Moderate bitterness  overall but a bit more on the aftertaste.  A bit of dryness.
Great IPA here which I prefer to Heady.  Love the mix of citrus, tropical and floral I picked up on the taste. 743 charactersleroybrown10, Sep 24, 2016

Nose is citrus, pine, grass and a fresh, juicy hop bitterness. More mellow than I thought it'd be but still very good. Beer opens citrus, grapefruit and cantaloupe up front with a bark and grass hop bitterness in the back. One of the driest IPAs I've ever had. More citrus with a big malt backbone balanced by a hop presence that's more dry and acrid than bitter. But it works. Feel is light bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Just perfectly silky and smooth in the mouth and bone dry going down, leaving the palate thirsting for more. 
The balance between being overwhelmingly flavorful and extremely balanced is impressive here and the feel just can't be beat. An excellent beer all around. The fact that its only 7% is icing! 766 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 22, 2016

16 oz can, half in a teku, half in the the can.
A- A hazy golden copper with a large white head.
S- Pineapple, mango, tropical fruits, some grapefruit, very dank, hints of malt sweetness.
T- Super dank resin hops, very bitter finish, nice pineapple/mango thing going on, hints of caramel malts, some grapefruit/citrus.  Probably the dankest beer I've tried.
M- Smooth, medium body.
O- A great IPA worth seeking out.  With that being said it is not the fruitest IPA out there, definitely considering it is brewed with citra and mosiac, but isn't as overwhelmingly dank from the can.  Very drinkable, taste lingers beautifully. 655 characterslarryi86, Sep 19, 2016

About a finger of dense white foam leaves little lacing. Smell and taste are hugely fruity and piney. Orange, pineapple and mango blend with fresh resinous hops. Pretty big and delicious bitterness on the back end is offset with a touch of sweetness. Slight bready malt makes an appearance, but only just. Insanely good, one of my all-time favorites. 463 charactersBeers-es, Sep 15, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25appearance- Golden amber in color, turbid yet a little clearer towards the bottom of the glass, and pours a two inch head.
aroma- Pineapple, citrus, berries, grapefruit, and a little pine.
taste- Starts off with juicy citrus, berries, and tropical fruits. Towards the middle the bitterness picks up and more acidic fruits (grapefruit in particular) show up.  The finish has a bready malt which adds some flavor and sweetness leading to semi clean finish.  A little bit of bitterness that lingers and adds some astringency, but this is minor.
feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, soft, a little resinous, but clean overall.
overall- For an ipa this hits on a lot of key notes. The hop flavors range from juicy pineapple/citrus to grapefruit and pine, the texture is soft (almost pilowy), and it delivers a nice snap of bitterness. My only knock is that the finish is a little astringent, which gets much worse as this beer gets older. I'm usually lenient with IPAs and age, but I definitely wouldn't let this get older than 2 weeks. 1,039 charactersCTbrew32, Sep 01, 2016

T - Follows the nose with notes of pine and a very dry bitter finish; more bitter than I would like it to be.
M - Medium full, very pleasant.
O - Too hyped, I think; but I need to give it a second try. Not a fan of so much malt presence and the extremely bitter finish. Still a good beer, but with so many other great options out there, I wouldn't try too hard to try to find this one. 656 charactersdiemilio, Aug 28, 2016

Served in a tulip glass
This beer pours pale yellow and is cloudy. It looks like pineapple juice. It is topped with several inches of fluffy, white head that leaves chunks of lacing as it recedes.
The aroma is loaded with tropical and citrus fruit. It smells more tropical than citrus. Very nice.
The taste begins with tropical fruit that gives way to bitter grapefruit. It finishes with fresh pine needles. 
Medium to full mouthfeel
It was great to start out. The pine flavor began to build the more I drank it leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. It is a two and a half week old can. 600 charactersbuschbeer, Aug 28, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Can (couldn't see a date):
Hazy yellow golden, decent white head volume, but nice sustaining power.
Nose was powerful from the can, but faded in the glass a bit.  Strong bitter green pine, dank and fresh.  Little green onion in the glass, but also a funky citrus note that is familiar to my nose as Citra hops.
Taste is like the nose, but there is a nice malt backbone (I want to go biscuit - a little bit of sweetness than meekly stands up to the hops).  The fruit flavor is more tropical after the opening malt note, and is constantly morphing until the pith, pine, dank notes start to take over and rip at my tongue a tad.  But the bitter notes never get in a clean punch, and the feel is a bit more well-rounded than I would expect.  The blows are powerful, but not to the point of being a knockout.
Lovely beer - one of the better ones I have ever had.  Up there with the very fresh Dirt Wolf I had at Victory.  In profile, it is similar to a few Ocelot IPAs, though this beer is a little more full and well rounded. 1,024 characterscjgiant, Aug 26, 2016

Initial burst of pineapple, tropical, hoppy nose. Initial taste is very Citra forward - grapefruit followed by more earthy bitterness on the back end.  No big surprise that there is a ton of hops, but as with Heady, there is a balance and drinkability that is harder to find in IBU-heavy brews. If I am just buying into the hype, then I need to buy me some more. Bottom Line - world class. 556 characters11-52_4hops, Aug 24, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a a slightly hazy golden amber color with excellent head retention and considerable lacing.  The nose is attractive as well, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, onion, grassy hops, light tropical fruit, pepper and a dash of clove.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with a huge dose of hoppy bitterness on the finish.  The citra hops in this ipa are very prominent.  There's a hint of heat from the alcohol on the finish, but otherwise, there's not much to complain about in this hop bomb of an ipa.  Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied in this no holds bared ipa, and the finish is hugely bitter.  I guess this could be a bit better balanced, but that's obviously not what the brewer is going for here.  
Not sure I could pound down more than one or two of these at a sitting, but this one tasty ipa for sure.  Impressive. 858 charactersJohn_M, Aug 24, 2016

Taste is sweet citrus with tropical notes like pineapple and Mellon on the front of the tongue. Bitter hops build in the mid palate and finish along with lemon lime and green herbal notes which come on a little too strong for my liking. Mouth feel is creamy, full, and tight. There's so many great IPAs available today that it's hard to compare. This doesn't strike me as one of the best, but honestly it might just depend on the day when I'm grading IPAs. This is definitely a good one and worth seeking out. 582 charactersdanh53, Aug 24, 2016

A:
Cloudy golden straw with three fingers of soapy head that slowly drops to one+.  Great retention, puffy clouds of lacing all over.  (4.75)
S:
Bright, rich citrus, stone fruit, bubblegum, dirt, woodsy hops, hard water.  (4.5)
T:
Like concentrated grapefruit essence with waves of peaches, apricots, etc., white pepper, rising hop resin finish running the course, slight alcohol hint (no heat, though).  (4.5)
M:
Rich, coating hop lacquer with soft, sweet feel (not sticky); medium carbonation and lingering oily finish (hoppy hum).  (4.5)
O:
Fabulous beer!  
To my tastes, this strikes a nice balance between Heady's über dank hoppiness and some other IPAs' juiciness.  Loads of grapefruit and peaches with a hint of malt body and a slowly resinous finish.  Very drinkable (albeit strongish).  Sweet, not sticky.  Resinous, not sappy.  Nice balance within its intentional unbalance.
Tasty beer; hope to have it again.  Worth getting ahold of.  (4.75) 980 charactersTheDoctor, Aug 19, 2016

M - Medium mouth feel and carbonation.

4.99/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This might be the best beer I've ever tasted. It's not a beer I could have more than one of at a time, though. I was lucky enough to acquire a 4 pack from a friend who made the trip to Vermont. Had one fresh the day he returned. This beer is very complex. Now having had all 4 over the last week I can say that it's different things to me at different times. 
The smell: First impression - what is that? floral yeast like a Treehouse brew? No, something more. I smell grapefruit and spices - coriander, allspice . . . and Mosaic. Lot's of mosaic. 
The Taste: Starts out with that warm, sweet floral Treehouse flavor but then it quickly turns bitter. This is more complex than any Treehouse I've had. The bitter lingers perfectly, just the right amount. Finally, I'm left with Mosaic; lots of it, that weedy/sour pucker tang.
The feel: Tight carbonation. It's not juicy. It's not like syrup. It feels very light and effervescent.
I think the best way to describe this is to say that it is something like a cross between a TH Alter Ego and a NEBCO Supernaut.
What's funny is that I didn't notice the Mosaic with my first one. At that point I was totally focused on the up-front floral yeast character and the bitter finish. Tonight, having my 4th and final it's all Mosaic to me, the smell, the taste. 1,304 charactersdms, Aug 15, 2016

I see they are still not proud of the visual appearance of their beers considering the can art declaration that drinking from the can is still best. I'm a believer that aroma really makes a beer what it is, and if you can't smell the beer through the tiny hole in the car while drinking it, then you're not getting the full experience, period. Plus, it must be said, since nearly every brewery out their trying to keep pace with this style of IPA is doing the same thing, it's time to embrace the haze. After a few of these, I can definitively say they definitely have quite a bit of sediment in these cans--I've had one with an absolutely enormous colony of yeast clumped together and swirling around at one point. Definitely unseemly. You don't get this from Trillium or Tree House, ever. And Maine or Hill Farmstead, well they're on another level in regards to appearance.
Smell is nutty, cheesy tangerine, with a light dankness, light young pine, and a slight hint of apple cider vinegar.
Taste is tangy and spicy green pine, pink peppercorn, tangerine, grapefruit and cracker. Bitterness builds over time, with grassy, sharp pungent hops being the primary cause.
Focal is much more nuanced and balanced than I thought it would be. Fruity yet piney, juicy yet bitter. I do like it more than Heady, if only by a hair.
Finish is slow and steady to develop on the palate, but is dry with mild bitterness. 1,506 charactersSabtos, Aug 13, 2016

More great can art in the vein of Heady Topper, with a wild-eyed gent blowing hops out his ears while savoring the aroma from an open can.
Acquired at the new brewery yesterday.  Have not had this one before although I tried last year when it was only available in cans at Waterbury's Prohibition Pig, without success. 
a: Hazy orange with an inch thick white head which receded to patchy surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Intense citrus and pine resin.
t: Follows the nose with a double-IPA-like oomph, over a medium biscuit malt base.  Bitterness lingers briefly on the dry finish.  ABV is excellently well covered.
m; Medium, very good body and carbonation tingle.
o; The inevitable comparison to their flagship and perennial top rated Heady Topper puts Focal ahead for overall bitterness but slightly less drinkability despite a point lower ABV.  Some hopheads may like Focal better. 929 charactersscotorum, Aug 12, 2016

Aroma is like brie - cheesy with hops. Somewhat fruity/floral and citrusy with a hint of tropical appeal.
Taste includes plenty of fruity hop qualities that are pulpy and resinous with a clean bitterness that has a mild tropical feel long into the aftertaste like pineapple.
Light in body with moderate to lower carbonation. There is a mild alcohol feel to this that blends nicely into the hoppy bitterness. This is quite a fine brew that seemingly evaporated out of my glass in no time. Id certainly drink it again. 702 charactersstakem, Aug 11, 2016

Appearance: pours a lovely, hazy, golden-yellow color, with a thick and sudsy white head. Body is quite turbid, with tons of floating hop particles. Probably why Kimmich advises drinking from the can. Towards the end of the beer, the hop chunks are slightly off-putting. Still, the rest of the beer is amazing looking, including the can, so I can't knock it too much.
Aroma: loads of hop character here. Typical Citra and Mosaic profile; lots of citrus, grapefruit, some peach and mango. There's also more bitterness and pine than most modern NE-style IPAs. 
Taste: following the aroma, loads of fruity hop character, along with moderate bitterness and some malt as well. Not incredibly over-hopped, like the beers this and Heady pre-dated. This beers balanced, but still with an uber-hoppy punch. Excellent!
Feel: full-bodied, and with moderate carbonation. Nice and crisp, with a somewhat dry finish.
Overall: this is an excellent beer, and pairs perfectly with Heady. I'd have figured that the new Alchemist might have some growing pains, but this is fantastic. 1,150 charactersTheElectricOne, Aug 10, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours pale yellow with a fluffy white head. The aroma is a complex assault of pine, grapefruit, nut, and relentless dankness. IMHO, it's the star of this beer. It is bitter up front with more grapefruit and some malt sweetness and then finishes clean. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, it's delicious. How does it compare to its Heady brother? I'm not sure... Anybody willing to contribute multiple cans of each for testing is free to message me and we can arrange a trade. :) 469 charactersRyanthebear, Aug 08, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Focal Banger pours a hazy/opaque gold with a nice thumb and a half of head that lasts and lasts.  There is fantastic lacing as the head breaks and as one drinks.  A great looking beer.
The smell for this beer is a hop lovers dream. Piney and grassy with citrus bringing the whole shebang together.  
The taste carries on the dominance of the hop aromas as the pine and citrus just burst in your mouth.   There is a lingering bitterness on the palate, but not overpoweringly so, it provides a pleasant experience.
Feel is medium with nice amount of carbonation present.  This beer goes down nicely, but you can't drink it too fast or too slow...you need to find that sweet spot.
Overall, Focal Banger is a fantastic IPA.  I have to admit, I chased this beer for a while, and it seemed every time I arrived at a pub, they had just run out.  Now that I have finally had it, I appreciate what the hubub was about.  It's on the list of "oh hell yeah" beers for me.  Ones that are just that memorable. 999 characterspolloenfuego, Aug 07, 2016

Ripe tropical fruit aroma. Grapefruit, pineapple, tangerines, and papaya. The taste is lots of grapefruit followed up by the papaya and tangerine. Some pine and floral notes as well. Grapefruit finish. Very drinkable with a moderate alcohol presence. Lots of carbonation with an oily mouthfeel. I had this years ago back when the brewpub still existed and was pumped to see it make its return. Overall, outstanding IPA. 523 charactersPicoPapa, Aug 06, 2016

Smell is orange, grapefruit, pineapple and dank pine. Taste is the same but even more flavorful. Starts of fruity and finishes dank and bitter. World class. 
Feel is light and slightly resinous with a prickly bitter finish. Overall amazing. Not as soft and pillowy as Treehouse or Grimm, but I like a little bite. Definitely prefer Focal to Heady.
Drank half from the can and half from the glass. Out of the can tastes more dank and bitter, glass is more fruity and juicy. I preferred straight from the can, but what do I know? 683 charactersCNoj012, Aug 05, 2016

I consider this IPA a top tier, BUT Heady is a DIPA and in my opinion, going against Heady Topper, Heady will always win for me. 352 charactersGregA135, Aug 04, 2016

Delicious, two fingers of foam with a vigorous pour and beautiful color.   Prefer Crusher to this but it's an unfair comparison as they are different animals (and splitting hairs, it's world-class).  Perhaps the most balanced of the Alchemist triumvirate.  Great, great beer. 385 characters4truth, Aug 03, 2016

Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with two inches of white head.

Overall really good. I put it slightly ahead of The Crusher but below Heady due to HT's smoothness. 280 charactersmdfb79, Aug 01, 2016

Light orange haze filled the glass.  Aromas of sap, pine, resinous dank.  That resin and pine stays with the taste along with citrus and tropical fruit flavors from the Citra + Mosaic hop.  Medium mouthfeel.  Very smooth and easy drinking after-taste.  Something I could drink all sumer.  It reminds of a juicer and more robust version of Tree House Sap.  Great combination of best of the North West along with what is considered a New England easy-drinking, juicy haze brew.  I like Heady Topper a lot, but I might just pick this if asked to pick between the two. 603 characterseifster82, Jul 23, 2016

Look is a hazy yellowish brew.  Nice lacing that sticks. 
Smells is amazing.  Citrus and mosaic hops bursting through the glass. 
Taste follows the nose.  So much citrus. Love the mosaic hops and the fruit hangs in the middle of the palate. 
Mouth feel is medium bodied and damn near perfect.
Overall, love it.  I've had Heady a few times and this is better.  I could drink this every day.  Great can, great name, great brew.  #homerun 506 charactersJay_P22, Jul 17, 2016

At least, in my opinion although I'm probably in the minority. The Alchemist doesn't offer much for variety so they can focus on a couple of beers and really perfect them. And perfect them they have.
Focal pours a light golden color and is very hazy, much like Heady. But that's where the similarities end. Aroma is citrus juice and candied fruits. Taste follows. Very juicy and very citrusy with a slight candied fruit taste. The finish is dry with a moderate bitterness. I get a lot of grass and pine from Heady, but not Focal. It's more of a straight up juice bomb. Mouthfeel is medium with perfect carbonation. What an amazing beer. It's a shame they don't distribute it to the same stores as Heady. 785 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 17, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy yellow orange color with no vision of anything.  Spotty lacing down the glass as as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Wicked weed, grassy, herbal, spicy, lemon, tropical, bready, wheaty, and pale malts.
Taste:  Awesome citra and Mosaic lasting hop flavor.  Nice malt bill, a little chewy, and light tingly bitterness.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, a little chewy, and light tingly bitterness.  Very delicious.
Overall:  A friend just gave me this can and drank it right away.  Solid choice. 646 charactersFlounder57, Jul 10, 2016
3.99/5  rDev -12.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 416oz can, half poured into a blank tumbler glass, half kept in the can to compare as the can directly states "DRINK FROM THE CAN". Fresh can from the re-opening of The Alchemist's public retail space. 
The beer pours a really hazy golden peach color, apricot and orange hues, cloudy but not turbid by any means. A massive, fluffy white head appears, about 2 or 3 fingers high with fantastic retention and beautiful swatches of lace left clinging to the glass. The aroma is pleasant, lots of tropical fruit, sharp pineapple, bitter grapefruit peel, dank pine, really green grassy hops, lots of earthiness coming out with some crisp cracker malt. The flavors are good, loads of bitter hops, grapefruit peel, pineapple juiciness, dank, weedy grass, earthy hop spice, very resinous, pale wheat and cereal grains linger with a light alcohol character and a stinging bitterness. The mouthfeel is okay, very coating, extremely dry, active carbonation, but not abrasive, medium body and a monster dry kick at the finish.
Verdict: A nice IPA from The Alchemist, but boy this is intensely bitter and doesn't offer much in the way of sweetness or juiciness to offset the bitterness. This was definitely a nice treat after some housework, but I'd hardly put this up with any of the other world class IPAs that the region can produce. 1,323 characterskevanb, Jul 10, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Fresh can about a week old. UPDATE: Second review on 8/9/16 from a fresh can consumed on day of pickup from new Alchemist brewery.
A: Pours a vibrant, opaque gold that transitions to a deeper orange as it sits. Ginormous yellow-white fluffy head sticks around for a while, one of the most well-retained I’ve ever seen. Some lacing on the glass.
S: Ripe pineapple, grapefruit, orange. Undertones of melon and peach. Definitely picking up on some dank notes as well from the Mosaic.
T: Starts off heavy on the citrus. Orange peel/pith Transitions to a bridge that reminds me just a bit of Heady… Kind of herb-y, floral spiciness. Just a touch of sweet bready malt precedes a dank and resinous finish with a lingering, grassy pine aftertaste that sticks to the back of the tongue for a while.
M: Medium to medium/full. Very smooth, though not quite as luscious and creamy as its NE-style contemporaries. Medium+ bitterness on the finish, lingers for a while. (UPDATE: Second time I had fresher Focal, there was waaaay less bitterness than I remember--I'd say medium- at max.) Carbonation is spot-on.
O: Focal blows its elder sibling out of the water. It's an excellent balance of fruity juiciness, floral dankness, and resiny bitterness. I found it to be far less bitter--and almost 5/5--when I had it the same day I picked it up from the brewery. However, every other time I've popped a can (anywhere from 1 week to 3 weeks old), I've felt the grassy bitterness that hits mid-mouth could be reduced, as--to me-- it too quickly overshadows the tropical fruitiness that dominates up front. That being said, to me, Focal Banger is an excellent blend of the west coast and east coast styles, and I'd be happy to drink this any day of the week. 1,746 charactersavas, Jul 09, 2016

L - initial flow from the can was a crystal gold, but as it settles in the glass, I'm getting a curious, opaque lively orange. I know, I know, I shouldn't be pouring this, but hey, I'll save the second half for the can! Huge fluffy head fills the glass right away and slowly pops, bubble by bubble until a reasonably sized head remains. 
S - monster aromatics from the moment I cracked the can. John Kimmich was right, pouring sure as hell smells nice. Ripe orange and pineapple. Tropical without being stupid juice. Crisp and crackery with a mosaic spiciness. A quick swirl and a sniff yields an acrid, acidic smell reminiscent of a burning orange peel. I know what this smells like because once upon a time I was doing that thing where you squish a peel through an open flame into my whisky and, well, one thing lead to another. 
T - more dank that I had expected! Tingly tangy grapefruit and other pithy rindy fruits. Tropical citrus abounds, balanced by puckering spice. Piney, earthy, and floral. Primal. Resin on the finish... and what's that? Some juice? I can dig it. Slight mango and lemon under all the hoppy bitterness. Speaking of bitter, it leaves a nice tingle tangle to tip my tongue. 
F - lush and creamy. This is the icing on the cake that reminds me of a clearing in a forest during the late morning hours. 
O - probably like this better than Heady. Has loads of depth and complexity and a killer mouthfeel to top it all off. Mosaic is a strange beast and one can do some strange things, usually resulting in a unique and flavorful brew. 1,631 charactersagreenman19, Jul 08, 2016

I personally rate this one a tad higher than the Heady - and the reason being it's a bit on the lighter side. Not in flavor, but in drink-ability. I refer to it as a girly heady topper. As it is essentially, a fruitier version. 248 charactersMamaHoney, Jun 29, 2016

Lighter on the malt, heavier on the tropical fruits, and a beautiful dry finish. This is a top tier IPA, and manages to maintain high bitterness levels, while incorporating some of the softer flavors associated with these NE IPA's. Man, I can't wait until this is available by the case. 417 charactersJMUbrewz, Apr 26, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Just wow. The absolute only thing that could be classified as a complaint is the tiny amount of floaties on the bottom of the can (which I personally see no problem with). It's the same tingly hoppy floral and citrus perfection as heady exception in a slightly lighter and less dry IPA form. Perfect malt backbone to catapult the hop character. A little bit less complex than Heady, but don't let that take anything away from this gem. 435 charactersRABouffard, Apr 26, 2016

L: Not unlike HT, a hazy pale golden. Minimal head and lacing.
S: Grapefruit, other citrus, mango (there's your Citra hops), light malt.
T: Generally follows nose. More light grapefruit than anything else. Resiny and piney on end.
F: Light to medium bodied, light to medium carbonation. Good drying with no bitterness and the famous Alchemist balance.
O: Definitely Heady Topper's little brother, more sessionable and a little less intense. Can't wait until they retail. 606 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Apr 12, 2016

4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5L: If you like your beers clear, you may want to keep this one in the can. Opaque with minimal head, and lots of floating hop goodness. Minimal alcohol legs but this is to be expected with a %7 brew.
S: Right off the bat I get punched with orange and lemon peel, there is some pineapple that pokes it's head through supporting the citrus tones perfectly. There is a touch of dankness behind all of this but the citrus tones take front stage.
T: This one really is an assault on the pallet, the taste doesn't carry as much of the citrus peel flavors but rather gives way to some of the underlying pineapple and mango that rests beneath. Directly after the fruit juice bombardment I was hit with a metric S-ton of bitterness that did not overstay it's welcome falling off clean giving way for the pineapple/mango to resinate.
F: This brew has an amazing mouthfeel, it is smooth as can be and has an almost creamy quality to it. This was one of my favorite aspects of Heady and this is right up there with its older brother. 
O: This is an absolutely amazing beer, it can be hard to get but is definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop head such as myself. It is hard for me to do justice with words just how good this beer really is, I honestly can't think of a single flaw. 1,280 charactersbugzy3188, Mar 14, 2016

Very solid. Worth the hype. 235 charactersmothman, Mar 12, 2016

Did not pour any into a glass, so I'm assuming the look is as awesome as the rest of it.  The aroma is an explosion of citrus smells, as good as any IPA out there.  The taste that follows is well balanced between hops and citrus, with a great, smooth feel.  Really enjoyed this beer.  It exceeded my expectations, and I'd take this over Heady.  I hope they distribute beyond bars.  It's a keeper. 449 charactersBeerasaurus, Feb 22, 2016

In hindsight, I preferred it from the can; as you would expect, there were floaties galore in the glass - doesn't bother me one bit. Not overly turbid or murky. A nice cloudy orange gold. It's such a balanced IPA, it's beautiful. Part crisp citrus, bushy pine, tropical fruit and exquisite bitters, this IPA sings a balanced tune from start to finish. Not too juicy, resiny, bitter or hot. It's the beer that Goldilocks would drink after breaking into the bear's house. Fucking hard to find, for sure, but it really is a treat when you do track it down. 630 charactersManapuaMan, Feb 14, 2016

4.88/5  rDev +6.8%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Consumed from a can purchased at the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, VT.
I give the appearance a neutral 3 because I drank the beer from the can. 
The aroma brings an absolutely absurd amount of citrus. Smelling this beer is like taking a walk through Odin's orange grove wearing a Smell-O-Scope. There's so much juicy grapefruit, and orange rind, but just enough bitter, grassy hop resin to balance everything out. Absolutely incredible. 
The taste follows the nose with an atomic explosion of grapefruit and tropical fruits, followed by some bitter, earthy hop resin. Bitterness lingers for a while after each sip. 
The mouth is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Extremely creamy, smooth and lightly bitter. 
Overall, I simply need more of this beer. It is incredible. It is every bit as good as Heady and the flavors and aromas really stand out on their own. Can't wait for this to start getting retail distribution. 934 charactersScaryEd, Jan 14, 2016

Great beer for those who cannot handle the explosive taste from HT.. It's not a true "session" because Focal Banger still packs a lot of flavor. Were it a standalone, it would probably be rated higher but it's hard not to compare to the older brother.
Worth trying if in the area, but outside of that nothing that amazing that stands out 362 charactersbol3by, Jan 08, 2016

S:  big citrus aromas with perfume florals. The hop notes are intense out of the can, so much that it muddies the aromas and it ends up smelling like a lot of citra and mosaic ipas. Inside the can, however, its more subdued and much more elegant.

O: maybe not quite the masterpiece HT is, but I prefer this one. I wouldn't say I was becoming bored with HT, because I still haven't had that much of it, but this beer reminded me why it blew me away in the first place--The Alchemist's totally unique style.

Not sure exactly how to explain it, but it definitely had that familiar mouth feel...like HT, but a touch thinner.

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I can't really say anything about look since it came directly from the can. When I first heard of the Alchemist I couldn't wait to try Heady Topper. The day I had my first Heady, my wife said I looked happier drinking that beer than I did on my wedding day. I can't say I agree but I was pretty pumped. During my most recent trip to Burlington I got to try Focal Banger for the first time. I was taken away by how good the beer was. I'd even go as far to say that it is better than Heady Topper. I just hope that when The Alchemist opens up their brewery that they put more of a focus on getting this beer distributed to places other than restaurants. 651 charactersCoulombemj90, Dec 07, 2015

Smell- Delicious and intoxicating tropical fruit and dank resiny hops. This one is so juicy!
Taste- Very interesting and complex. I get a lot of bitter passionfruit, alcohol infused papaya and grapefruit rind. Big buttering hops and citric/grapefruit hops in the finish leaves you almost bone dry.
Feel- medium bodied but a bit lighter than some other more malt forward IPAs. Good balance.
A great brew. It provides an interesting counterpoint to Heady Topper. While HT has an intense smoky and tobacco leaf type hops feel and generally bigger malt body, this one has a thinner bodied and slightly softer hops complexion. I love both! 739 charactersGajo74, Dec 05, 2015

I asked for a glass, sorry John Kimmich, I wanted to give it a "correct" review.
They gave me a stemmed pilsener. Hmmmm...not sure how this is gonna go given, wrong glassware. Here's the rest based on observations.
The appearance was the typical TA unfiltered look, yes, the floaties John likes to hide. Muddled brown to orange color. One finger white foamy head that dissipated in about a minute. Some stringy lacing here and there.
The smell had a big burst of the grapefruit to piney oily hops. Resinous and pounding my nostrils in a harsh way.
The taste was sweet yet bitter and pounds at my taste buds nicely. Lingering resinous aftertaste slides into the finish.
The mouthfeel was sharp with the resin hitting my tongue in a pronounced yet profane burst. In trying to say "uncle" to the beer, I think I fell off my chair.
Overall, in every way known to mankind, there are IPA's that do their respect to be bittersweet. But this one just takes the cake to the extreme, wooeee. Send me to bed, momma, of course I'd have this again. 1,083 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 24, 2015

4.48/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (Jester King stemware, once again). This was purchased about two weeks ago at the Stowe brewery, and has been refrigerated consistently since then. I’d say these are pretty damn good tasting conditions. 
Appearance (4.25): Three full fingers of ecru-colored foam rise off of the pour, capping a hazy, honey-orange body. Light passes through, but it’s well-hazed nonetheless. The head dies down very, very slowly, leaving uneven, scattered legs and broken collars of webby foam. The body is gorgeous, the head is beautiful, and the lacing is adequate. 
Smell (4.25): Classic NE IPA: tons of sweet red grapefruit, sweet orange peel aromas, and some skunky weed, accompanied by lean malt aromas: baking soda biscuits, common crackers, etc. Limeade, for sure. A bit of overripe mango, too. As the beer warms, grassiness and a bit of gooseberry come out, along with a touch more mango. 
Taste (4.5): Absolutely bursting with a mélange of sweet and tart citrus fruits: pineapple, kumquat, tangerine, and sweetened ruby red grapefruit juice. Then comes the crisp, lasting wave of bitterness: unsweetened yellow grapefruit juice, tart limeade, and then green banana peel, and finally edible flowers, with a decidedly floral bitterness. The malt is, again, lean and biscuity, crisp with pain de campagne crusts, and common crackers. The dominant character here is really a bracing but not overwhelming bitterness that lies somewhere between grapefruit pith, a wad of fresh-cut grass, and floral notes supported by gentle but bright citrus sweetness—mango and limeade. 
Mouthfeel (5.0): The body is perfectly medium-weight, and the carbonation is lush, washing all over the palate with a soft foam before expanding and flushing out with a gentle tingle. The scrubby hops leave a lingering dryness bolstered by a light starchiness. Despite this beer’s (fitting) size, it is down right crushable, but thoroughly satisfying at the same time. 
Overall (4.5): This is, ultimately, a “classic” NE-style IPA that’s executed to perfection. It’s not breaking any barriers, but it’s meeting or exceeding all expectations of what a top-notch IPA is supposed to be. It’s not quite the game changer that Heady was, but it’s a damn fine IPA in its own right that can stand up to the best of them. Very, very highly recommended. 2,387 charactersfmccormi, Nov 06, 2015

I've been fortunate enough to have had several cans of this over the last year. Consumed right out of the can. Upon opening, a huge blast of fresh hops and grapefruit hit the olfactory senses. Unapologetic and assertive hops. Dank and resinous. Juicy and delicious. I'm not saying that this is better than Heady Topper, but like Heady Topper, I feel that this beer is essentially flawless.

I had the Heady first and will review it later. The local folks recommended I try the Focal since it was only available in restaurants. To my palate, it was sweeter than Heady. Excellent Hop Balance. Very smooth, no notice of alcohol. Do drink it in the can, the Alchemist folks really have mastered World Class beer in a can. 451 charactersallhoppedup2, Oct 15, 2015

S: Smells like papaya, fresh pineapple and mango, with hops hops and more hops that burst through your nostrils just like in the picture on the can.
T: Best IPA I've ever had IMO. Blows SOS out of the water. The power of the hops and dominating citrus without over doing it makes this simply the most drinkable and pronounced IPA I have had. At 7% the drinkability is scary. No alcohol presence whatsoever.
F: This and Heady are in a class of their own when it comes to mouthfeel. The hops just roll down the back of your throat and it's not so overpoweringly bitter like most other IPA's are when they try to mimic this style.  Similar mouthfeel to Heady but not as strong.
O: Like I said best IPA I will probably be able to enjoy, perfect beer that I would drink every day if I had the chance. Even better than Alter Ego. 956 characterscaptainsdaughter, Oct 13, 2015

4.94/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank from a 1 pint can at Hen of the Wood, Waterbury, VT
Served in a snifter
Cloudy, amber-tinged straw yellow appearance. The beer was topped by an inch-plus tall cap of bubbly froth that quickly dissolved. Droplets of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was amazingly hoppy and bright. Super fruity. Tropical fruit notes dominated. Loads of musty passionfruit, papaya and mango. Uber juicy. Orange juice definitely came to mind. Tangerine as well. Fairly sweet. There was also an intensely dank, weed-like quality. Really fantastic. The passionfruit notes intensified as the beer warmed.
The flavor profile was very similar to the nose and just as incredible. Loads of tripical fruits. Mango, papaya and passionfruit were most apparent. Citrus notes played a bigger role here than in the aroma. Very orange-y. Orange peel appeared on the back end. The beer finished with notes of white grapefruit rind. Just the right amount of bitterness for balance. Piney, resiny notes lingered after the swallow.
The mouthfeel was amazingly creamy and supple. Fluffy and almost cloud-like. A fine, zippy effervescence made the liquid seem much lighter than it actually was.
Focal Banger definitely lived up to the hype. As much as I love Heady Topper, I have to say that this beer is even better. 1,297 charactersDamian, Oct 11, 2015

Pour - I'm just going on a limb here saying that it looked great. Drank out of the can
Smell - tropical with citrus coming out strongest. definitely piney
Taste - much more refreshing than heady, nothing overpowered anything else
Overall - more drinkable than Heady, but still very potent 366 charactersChrisP802, Sep 27, 2015
4.78/5  rDev +4.6%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I drank it right from the can, as ordered.
I give it a "3" for looks, though I never saw what it looks like. I thought about a "4", but The Alchemist overcooks the goofy beer commands: "Don't be a D-bag", "Drink from the can"....enough, already. It's not the message, just the way it's sent.
Super fresh hop aroma, like fresh pressed hop fluid. Its cousin, marijuana, pays an aromatic visit. Lot of pine, too. The aroma is very pleasant and opens the nasal passages, refreshingly.
Lots of citrus hop flavor, strong grapefruit. A bit piney, a bit tropical. Enough malt to balance and keep it a beer.
Full feel, clean and refreshing. Not a trace of the 7% abv. Lasting bitterness and tongue tickle but not overly bitter. 
I'm not getting the "dank" that I read in other reviews. I'll take it over a Heady, TY. 812 charactersNiceTaps, Sep 27, 2015
4.86/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had at a few locations during a trip to Vermont: Stowe Wine & Cheese (unexpected), Doc Ponds, and Hen of the Wood. Poured some out just to get an idea of looks but kept 95% of it in the can, as specified. Pours a hazy golden color with a decent head that sticks around. Smells of... sweet baby jesus: pure hops. I should call the police because my olfactory cells just got assaulted by an angry mob of hops. Grassy, super herbal, notes of stone fruit. 
OK, let's drink this 16oz of elixir. Starts with the faintest sweetness from the english malts, but then it's blown away by the most epic wave of hops encountered. Very herbal and grassy, tons of stone fruit like peach and mango. Notes of citrus. Finishes ultra bitter with a mild carbonation kick to fight the hop oils which linger in the mouth for minutes afterward. 
The body will get to you after a little bit and a the whole can will leave you feeling somewhat full, not as much as Heady, but this beer will defeat your taste buds. They will beg for mercy. They will never be the same after this, they'll need years of therapy of tasting pale lagers, hefeweizens, porters, and witbiers to recover. 
Overall an amazing experience. I tried this next to Heady Topper and HT could not keep up. If you're in Northern VT and this is on the can list, don't even consider any other option. 1,342 charactersBranfordBound, Sep 27, 2015

From a 16 oz can into a snifter
Citra and Mosaic hops
APPEARANCE: Pours a 2+ finger, medium looking, slightly foamy white head with good retention. Hazy opaque amber orange with lower levels of carbonation evident. Head fades to a foamy cap and leaves some foamy lacing on the glass. A splotchy wisp remains until the end leaving more foamy lace down the glass as it empties. Nice color, but really hazy and foamy. 
SMELL: Lots of hops on the nose. Just piles. Lemon, citrus, mango, passion fruit, melon and pineapple on the nose. A bit of grapefruit as well. Lots of citrusy, fruity hop aromas. Really nice. Excellent. 
TASTE: Melon, passion fruit and lemon notes up front. Lots of hops with a bitter swallow, then waves of hop flavor in the finish. Lingering grapefruit, lemon, passion fruit, some mango, citrus and lots of bitterness dance all over the place. Really nice stuff though perhaps a touch too bitter for perfection. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, slightly foamy, goes down fine and finishes very dry. Lots of bitterness lingers. 
OVERALL: This is awesome stuff. The aroma and flavor are spot on here, and make for a really wonderful hopped-up drinking experience. The look and feel are a bit too foamy for absolute top scores, that those are minor issues. We actually compared this to Heady Topper and both are world class, though the particular can of Heady Topper might have been slightly better executed. Regardless, this stuff is excellent and I'm very happy to have had the chance to give it a whirl. Thanks again Joe! 1,751 charactersJeffo, Sep 16, 2015

Hopped with Citra and Mosaic and both of varieties best qualities showed.  Tropical fades to juicy berries.  Totally unbalanced with all flavor coming from the hops but a retstrained bitterness finishing dry.  A treat to have. 287 charactersGivemebeer, Sep 06, 2015

Taste is overwhelmingly delicious with bready malts and hoppy bitterness.  So well balanced, but slightly favoring the hops.  Extremely crisp and flavorful.  Can feel that carbonation with a slight bite and peppery mouth-feel.  This beer, much like Heady Topper, surpassed my expectations.  If you stumble on the chance to try it, it's an absolute must. 461 charactersanteatr23, Sep 01, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -6.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25People giving this high ratings for appearance are smoking crack. The number of particles floating in this is like OJ pulp. The color isn't very vibrant but it's fine. Head doesn't stick around long and the lacing is pretty weak. There's no getting around this with a subjective "I like hazy beers". The smell is nuanced but subtle. Definitely citrus - mineola tangerine, lemon and orange pith - and a funky vegetation element - wet grass / crushed leaves, maybe even something like zuchini. Flavor delivers more of the same with the vegetation becoming a bit too pronounced, like silage. Body is creamy, almost chewy, soft and round, coating rather than crisp. Finish is a bit flat. I'm picking on this beer a bit simply because I think a lot of the reviews are blind accolades. It's good. It's very good. But it's distinctly ugly and the nose and feel have some serious flaws. 878 charactersKurmaraja, Aug 26, 2015

Tried several spots that had run out but got lucky at the Blackback pub which had some left.  Very tasty beer.  Smooth with nice flavor.  Close to Heady.  Did a back to back with Heady and Second Fiddle and it was extremly close.  Heady still wins by a nose due to - IMO - better flavor but this is still a top notch brew thats not to be missed if you can get your hands on some. 467 charactersnjcraftguy, Aug 18, 2015

I dare say this beer has Heady beat. It's crisper, fresher, and doesn't have that synthetic backend that Heady Topper has. Citra and Mosaic are two hops that fit well together. Beautiful notes of citrus and pine. This beer is dank, fruity, and drier than you'd expect. A fantastic brew that lives up to its hype. 392 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Aug 15, 2015

4.87/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a can (about a month old) into a tulip glass.
Look: Hazy yellow to peach color. Small head with a continuous stream of small bubbles percolating.
Aroma: Tons of grapefruit. Smells like fresh grapefruit juice. Also some lemon, peach and dank elements in the background.
Taste: Tropical fruit upfront (grapefruit, lemon, orange) followed by dankness (onion, basil, pine). Bitterness is all in the back of throat. 
Feel: Great mouthfeel, has that biscuity NE IPA feel which leaves you lip smacking.
Overall great IPA, I prefer this over heady. Defiantly seek this out. 577 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Aug 15, 2015

Tons of citrus and tropical notes on the nose, grapefruit, oranges, mango and pineapple are all there. The taste is just like the smell, lots of tropical fruit, with a kick of bitter grape fruit peel cutting through like a knife at the very end, and enough malt to balance out the battle of hops going on. Seriously delicious beer. 616 charactersSteveB24, Aug 14, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +5%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Can taken from Sunset Grille in Stowe VT and poured about 60% of contents into a shaker.
Turbid lemon yellow slightly, with a pineapple like color.  Bit of a glow too it, good body and not wet looking.  Creamy top forming two controlled fingers with ease.  A bit of styrofoam like appearance but also hangs well.
Aroma is just incredible and big.  Thick notes of peach, pineapple, orange, mango.. and a big fruit smorgasborg going on.  Airy mint and strangely dried smelling herbs of lavender and lemongrass on top of it. Just a hop aroma dream.
Palate is just not what I was expecting at all.  Incredibly supper juiced tropical flavored bomb that takes a big turn.  Huge notes of melon and peaches, the big hop quality comes through... all of it from tropical to citrus hinted at the nose, iit's the malt character that blows my mind.  Biscuit cookie notes, even a little bit of toast and dryness.  Chewy almost wheat like.. it's almost as I am tasting every different kind of grain in a mash bill or something.  Palate feel manages to give a boost but it's the last thing you notice and does provide a bit of boost.
Overall just an incredibly controlled brew, with so much things you can dissect without being sledgehammered either.  Doesn't even taste like a high ABV IPA either.  Just a big winner. 1,306 characterssmakawhat, Aug 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Release 7-27-15. Poured from can. 
 A:  Golden color, floating hops present, nice layer of head.
S:  Citrus, Piney, fruity, grainy, huge aroma
T: Fruity, crisp, balanced, full-bodied mouthfeel, nice bitterness, not overwhelming, so perfectly intertwined flavors
M: Full bodied, but not as heavy as Sip of Sunshine, medium overall.
O: One of the best, if not best IPA (almost DIPA) ever had.  It’s extremely balanced and hop-forward but maintains that fresh VT water and intense flavors.  Truly a great beer from The Alchemist. 533 charactersCtmuri, Aug 04, 2015

had the first 4-5 sips from the can, poured the remaining 10oz's in a Pro Pig tulip
excellent fruity hoppy nose.  very strong malty back end that led to my pouring it into a glass, thinking this might free up some hops.  At 7% it's not a heck of a lot "weaker" than heady, but it's a different beer, far more similar to Sip of Sunshine.   It's an excellent IPA, in the top of the class. 443 charactersmrz200, Aug 03, 2015

The new can design is quite nice, though. The beer is yellow, fairly pale, with just a bit of orange to it. Pretty hazy. Big white head. Lots of lacing and very good retention. Big juicy hop aroma. Lots of tropical and citrus fruitiness with a solid resiny backbone running through it. It’s big on pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit, pine, mango. Good stuff. The taste has moderate to medium bitterness. Lots of hop flavor. Mild pale malt character. A nice mineral note. Finishes pretty dry. Easy drink. Soft, full mouthfeel. Packs a lot of flavor. It’s a very satisfying IPA. Excellent work from Vermont. 714 characterspopery, Aug 02, 2015

It had the same murky quality of Heady, but the head was beautiful, soft as a pillow, and generous in the lacing it left. The feel was thinner and the taste was pinier than Heady, but it still hit that wow mark that Heady does. Not quite as mindblowing as its older brother, but way closer than I expected it to be. 359 charactersAlpacaAlpaca, Jul 29, 2015

I could have 6 of these and keep going.  They are still very hoppy and run you through a gamut of flavors, but are much more drinkable than their older brother.  The can is awesome, too (for those who care). 442 characterstomparadis, Jul 28, 2015

A nice pale hazy orange, a 3/8" head and nice lacing
a very fruity and citrus smell jumps out of the can.
wow what a tasty. a smooth crisp sweet hoppy tasty .
Has a light feel good medium to light carbonation.
It is not a "heady Lite" as people say. it is a banging beer in it's own right. it drinks and tastes smooth as silk with a bang. has banging dank hops  with each taste. it is something that i could drink every day. in my opinion it is better than Heady. Wow a pleasure to finally try it. 576 charactersScarfer_Brad, Jul 26, 2015

A-  can't say much here other than the can looks cool.  I didn't pour this one out, but had it other times and can say it looks basically like Heady.
S-  lots of fruit jumping out of the can.  Pineapple, pear, mango, and others. Maybe a small hint of biscuit or grainy bread.  Basically the citrus fruits take control of the nose.
T-  wow, tastes similar to heady but has it's own little tartness thing going on.  Tastes very fruity and crisp 
M-  great mouthfeel.  Nice crispness but also has a beautiful medium bodied texture.  A little more of a bite on the finish in comparison to Heady, which I drank side by side with this one.
O-  outstanding beer.  Was stoked to see this on the menu where we stopped and it certainly did not disappoint. 800 charactersEveningCordial, Jul 04, 2015

Very hop forward aroma, big flavor, juicy and strong pine. 
Tastes fantastic.  The hop flavor is dank and so damn fresh.  The finish is very smooth, leaving you wanting more. 
One of the best beers I've ever had.
Re review over a year later. From an IPA glass, nice white puffy head that leaves nice lacing, a golden bright orange with loads over sediment after rolling the can. Increased the appearance rating from 3.75
Juicy hops on the aroma and palette. Grapefruit citrus, dank resinous, some pine. No shortness of bitterness on the back end. Increased around from 4.5
Medium bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. 705 charactersJordonHoltzman, Jul 02, 2015

A: Hazy pale amber body under a half inch of fine white head. Ok retention, light lace. Pretty nice.
S: Intense herbal, floral, and citrusy hoppiness. A bit of pine, too. Really dank, powerful aroma. Excellent.
T: Follows the nose at first, but with a bit more emphasis on grapefruit pith and pure bitterness. Long, bitter, herbal aftertaste. Really resinous.
M: Delicate body with some lively carbonation. Works well with the intense flavors.
O: Terrific IPA; not quite the masterpiece that I often find Heady to be, but a beer that I'd love to drink any time.
Cheers! 655 characterswoosterbill, Jun 27, 2015

EDIT 8/5/2016 (fresh can from the brewery):
A: Hazy, opaque, light yellow straw on color with a super soapy/foamy head that dissipates into a frothy white lacing.
S: Super dank, oats, the tropical citrus seems to force it's way into the aroma. It's super enjoyable when it's fresh. My first can (above^) must've been old.
T: Similar to the nose. Super dank, tropical citrus, grapefruit juice and pineapple. Yummy!
M: Moderate carbonation with a crisp, hoppy and slightly to not bitter/dry presence. 
O: Love it!! This is an A+ beer!! 702 charactersMA_hops, May 18, 2015

A: Hazy, bright yellow in color with a thin, white, foamy head that doesn't dissipate.
S: Dank resin, mild citrus notes, piney/grassy. Some malty sweetness to it.
T: Similar to nose, tasted zero alcohol, very balanced IPA, the malty sweet backbone balanced perfectly with the bitter hop kick to it. Has a nice grapefruit aftertaste. Picked up some dank stickiness mid sip.
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, mild to moderate bitterness.
O: I thought it was an extremely good IPA, not the best I have ever had, but it's definitely up there. 599 charactersCoffeePorter, Apr 27, 2015

Very hoppy with a nice clean finish and mouthfeel.  I wish they would distro this beer as I have only found it in VT restaurants and hotels and would love to buy by the case.  Much recommended. 282 characterselvisdoc, Apr 26, 2015

T: Raw hops. Earthy, leafy, herbal, peppery. Sweet cannabis. Passion fruit. White grapefruit, mango, pineapple. Stiff bitterness. Doughy and slightly honeyed. Gritty and earthy hops lay down herbs and freshly cut grass on a long finish.
M: Medium-thick body. Round and velvety texture. Ridiculous smoothness. Acutely sharp carbonation. Gritty hop astringency is minor.
O: This is every bit as good as Heady Topper. Raw, rustic, and bursting with hop flavor. The Alchemist has really honed the art of crafting an excellent ipa. This is about as good as it gets. God I love Citra and Mosaic. 911 charactersryan1788a5, Feb 09, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Drinking the first 1/3 or so from the can and then pouring the rest into a Dogfish IPA glass.
Appearance is a hazy golden, straw yellow with lots of sediment floating around. I can see through the beer the tiniest amount when I hold it up to the light. The head is slightly off white, with tight bubbles that cling and stick to the edges of the glass, but dissipates slightly from the initial pour. Lacing looks inviting. From the first glance, I wouldn't think this was an IPA.
Aroma is really pungent, lots of citrus; mostly orange. The aroma is just pouring out of the can. I get a bit of a malt backbone, but it's mostly just huge hops on the nose. Real dankness.
Taste has a nice hop bitterness up front, but nothing overwhelming. The middle of the mouth takes a huge turn into piney goodness that I wasn't getting on the nose.  There's a lingering bitterness and pungent flavor on the finish. The flavor doesn't quite stick around in your mouth as long as Heady does, but it's still a fantastic beer. 
Mouthfeel is medium, leaning towards the thinner side. Really creamy carbonation that is probably my favorite characteristic of this beer. Extremely drinkable. If it were just a little bit more full, I would give the mouthfeel a 5.
Overall this is definitely a super drinkable IPA that I would buy regularly if I were able to. Not quite up there with my favorite IPA's but definitely world class. Worth trading for and will continue to search for more. Cheers! 1,473 charactersswedishmailman, Jan 21, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Can: Poured a clear light yellow color ale with a nice white foamy head with excellent retention and some great lacing. Aroma of huge floral notes of grass notes with some light resinous notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by an all-out hops assault with tons of grassy notes with light limey notes and some resinous hoppy notes. Residual sugar can be detected but doesn’t stray the taste from the hoppy notes. Body is about average with great carbonation. Very enjoyable but almost close to being unbalanced with those sharp hoppy notes. 552 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 15, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can from Steve, many thanks to you!
Has a glowing, hazy apricot orange color, with a decent, stable head.
Aromas are defined by a dank fruitiness of both, pineapples and lemon. Also bread, as well as papaya shine through less intense, together with honeyed malt qualities.
Begins well balanced, with resinous lemon among a distinct biscuity maltiness. Then a crisp, almost sharp, bitter lime hoppiness emerges on the palate, supported by grassy herbs. This brew has a very pronounced maltiness which blends flawlessly into the the hops, beginning with honeyed, biscuity notes, turning into a bready, earthy direction. Helps to bring out the hops, which start grassy and a bit resinous, heading into a more and more fruity direction, with a slick lime and orange ending. Drinks outstandingly smooth, with a bitter, incredibly hoppy finish. 841 charactersaleigator, Jan 08, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This is a good IPA, very nice flavor profile. Its definitely a hoppy beer. Its not as fruity as I like my IPA's to be. But it is well made. It has the blend of malts and hops but leans on the side of earthy hoppiness rather the fruity juicy flavors. 
Color: Golden hazy, nice head retention that sticks around. 
Smell: Floral earthy hops. This one is very aromatic. 
Taste: Its on the very floral earthy side of the IPA scale. It is definitely not too malty or too hoppy but well blended. 
Overall: This is not Heady Topper but it certainly is a  solid IPA. Its not the best I have had but it certainly is not the worst either. Top 20 I would say, anyway. 659 charactershumuloner22, Dec 20, 2014

A. Pours a 90% opaque lemon rind yellow color with a white 2 finger head. 
S. Big citrus tropical fruit fills the nose. Slight biscuity malt.
T. This is delicious. Citrus fruit presence very balanced with malt and a perfect amount of bitterness. Aftertones of pine and leafy greens almost like b a by spinach. Very nice! 
M. Medium bodied with a crisp carbonation that doesn't chase the swallow much.   Lingers on the tongue for a couple seconds.  Pleasant. 
O. Definitely am digging this over Heady. This beer is well balanced.  Perfect amount of bitterness, malt and fruity hop with a nice grassy/piney aftertaste.  The mouthfeel and carbonation is great for the style. Aromas of tropical fruit fill the nose. And it's beautiful and curious to look at. You just want to know what this beer will be like when you look at it.  Highly recommended and I am a very satisfied recipient. 918 charactersIPAGeorge, Dec 20, 2014

4.49/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The color is a very murky medium yellow, completely opaque except at the edges.  The head is a fluffy, rocky and very dense one that's very close to pure white with the slightest yellow tint.  IT finally rests at no less than 1/4 finger but it's a thick and heavy pillow that remains, dropping lace in a blend of spotting and netting as it does.
The bouquet is very nice, lots of citrus and earth, even a bit of must with, interesting, a crackery sort of note.  There's even a touch of nut and herbal leaf riding underneath.  It's very well hopped with no harshness resulting, more and more raw greenery developing as it sits.  IT seems to develop a bit of acidity as time passes, dry and mildly sharp.
The taste brings out that herbal green right up front, and this beer's balance while relying on hops to carry the flavor meets expectations.  A not-quite-piney note grows with the earthier undertones.  The finish shows just a little rind and lingers with some dryness and a flash of wood.
The body is as firm a medium as it could be, lots of balance between crisp and smooth while running semi-dry from very beginning to lingering finish. 1,141 charactersBrenden, Dec 13, 2014

Well-balanced, hop-forward without being obnoxiously so, pours with incredible white head and a citrusy taste with the lightest pine bite that completely disappears almost as quick as it pops up. If I was to bring one beer on a desert island, this would be it. I didn't think much could tango with Heady, but this takes the cake for me. 361 charactersrynegne, Dec 12, 2014

Nutshell: this is like if Heady were a Citra bomb.  
It's super intense and delicious: "decadent" is probably the best word.  And while that's great, the lack of depth of hop profile holds it back from excellence.  Heady can get away with its largeness because the hops come at you with wave after wave of cascading variegation.  The relative simplicity of Focal makes its heft more salient, and finishing a can is a bit like trying to eat half a cheesecake in one sitting. 569 charactersmynie, Dec 06, 2014

4.05/5  rDev -11.4%Thanks again to Joe_Grizzly for drowning me in Alchemist, really looking forward to this one. I got your Silver Bullet right here, mother….16 oz. can dumped into my purty Kuhnhenn glass. 
The thing I love about Alchemist IPAs is that when you pop the top, the smell hits your nose at the speed of light. No need to suck in copious amounts of air, wet your nose, or otherwise search for the aroma. It is PRESENT. Filet knife sharp citrus, honeysuckle, bunch of airy tropical notes. The brew is a light, dull orange, with a head that appears focused on sticking around until the weekend arrives. 
Focal Banger is an underhanded, dishonest brew. My first sip I thought “What kind of sweet, malt-driven-ass IPA is this…”  & then my thoughts scattered. A malty base of sweetness, clover, & honey gives way quickly to the mid-palate of hops that stick close to the nose. A moderate bitterness rides along with the tropical punch, roaring citrus, bit of spiciness, fragments of lemon & perhaps  banana. The end is interesting, as the bitterness builds with every sip, until the top of my mouth is wallowing in spite. Grassy. Light. I would have to say this is one of the easiest-drinking beers I have ever had, I’m drinking this about twice as fast as I would a ‘normal’ brew. 
I like to compare stuff, so I’m going to say this isn’t quite in the same league as All-Stars Heady & Crusher. Which is to say this is merely excellent, rather than amazingly superior. I’ll take that kind of third-string any day. 1,523 charactersmaximum12, Nov 07, 2014

A - Opaque, sunny amber.  Slight head retention.
S - Lots of juicy fruit.  Definitely some tropical notes like mango and pineapple.  But also some citrus and berry fruit. 
T - Follows the aroma.  Lots of wonderful, juicy fruit up front.  A little bit of dank resin.   Packs a ton of flavor for a single IPA.  The mild hoppy bitterness makes this one incredibly drinkable.  Very little malt presence, similar to other Alchemist hoppy beers. Absolutely delicious.
M - Fairly light for the style. Carbonation is appropriate.  Smooth and refreshing. 
O - A truly wonderful American IPA.  Brings out all the bright, juicy hop flavors from citra and mosaic together quite nicely.  Nothing but hops here with still a refreshingly smooth finish.  This may be my favorite of the The Alchemist's hoppy beers, though they are all great in their own way.  I'm looking forward to The Alchemist being able to make this more regularly, once the new cannery is up and running. 1,058 charactersHeadyTheElder, Oct 15, 2014

Appearance is a hazy, bright creamy yellow, with a finger of white dissipating head, and average lacing
Aroma is citrus, mostly grapefruit, and pine
Taste is dominated by the pine, but followed up with citrus (white grapefruit) and some tropical notes.  Up front bitterness slowly fades, leaving mostly the hop aromas and some malt in the finish.  
Mouthfeel is nice and dry with perfect carbonation, just right for the alcohol level.
Overall, a super tasty American IPA.  Not really a surprise, being from the Alchemist.  With the described abundance of Citra and Mosaic hops, I sort of expected more tropical fruit rather than pine, but a wonderful beer nonetheless. 710 charactersFFreak, Oct 06, 2014

A- pours a bright golden-yellow color with a slight haze, creamy two-finger white head that retains nicely, eventually settling down to a film skimming the top
S- loads of tropical fruity hop aromas with notes of mango, pasionfruit, papaya, melon & apricot.  Also picking up some earthy pine, fresh grass, and herbal spice.  Malty undertones let the hops shine
T- tropical hop explosion hits the tongue with a plethora of peach, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, papaya & melon.  Mid-palate gives flavors of fresh cut grass, leafy, & earthy.  Big resinous notes close it out with a linger of pine, fresh mint & citrus juice
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that finishes creamy, crisp and dry.  Highly drinkable
O- quite simply, this is the best single IPA that I've tried.  The amount of hops that are packed into a 7% ABV IPA is remarkable and it lingers on the palate long after consumption.  The usage of citra & mosaic is definitely a big plus for me, an outstanding beer 1,043 charactersTreyliff, Oct 01, 2014

Appears a bright, golden hazy color with a thick, 2 finger white head.
Nose is heavy on citrus, slight floral scents.
Grapefruit, Lemons and Oranges dominate the taste.  Slight bitterness and almost a bit of saltiness to it.
Overall a solid IPA but in my opinion, not even close to as good as Heady. 342 charactersTWStandley, Sep 14, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%I've heard by many that this beer surpasses Heady Topper.  I'm a huge fan of anything brewed with Citra or Mosaic so I had to give it a try.  While quite good, I find something very slightly off with the way the hops mingle in the after taste.  Will definitely drink again, but IMO, I still prefer Heady. 304 charactershudsonheat, Sep 10, 2014

3.75/5  rDev -17.9%Nice white head, great golden straw color, aroma & flavor of citrus.  Great overall beer with nice mouthfeel and think it's quite sessionable but the hop flavor and aroma seem a tad muted versus other IPAs that are similar.

5/5  rDev +9.4%A: Poured into a tulip glass.  Poured with a nice white head.  The beer was light golden/straw colored with a good amount of haze.  Nice looking beer.
S:  Big aroma hit me as soon as I opened the can.  Lots of citrus and tropical fruit.  Lots of Pineapple, some mango, some lemon notes.  Great aroma.
T:  The initial taste follows the nose.  Lots of fruit notes as described above.  The finish was really nice though, it had a wonderful baked bread note that added some depth to the brew.
M:  Medium carbonation and body.  Nice sticky hop resins coat your mouth as you drink.  Dry, but not overly so.
O:  Between this and Heady, I'd never want to drink anything else if I had regular access to this brewery.  I really can't imagine a standard IPA being better than this, though there are a few others in the same league too.  Great beer! 841 charactersBrams17, Sep 05, 2014

A-	This beer has a great toasted gold color to it with thick haze that you cant see through.  The head is two fingers, light and fluffy looking. Tight bubbles and smooth across the top.  No lacing as the head recedes. 
S-   Huge mango and sweet lemony scents with a hint of grass in the background.  You can smell this thing from two feet away. 
T-   Amazing taste.  Big sweet fruit flavors take over your mouth followed by the perfect hint of bitterness along the edges of the tongue. The flavors are smooth and balanced and linger forever. I taste no alcohol in this beer.
M-  The mouth feel is crisp and light with tight carbonation.  It kind of floats on the palate.
O-  This is one of the best beers I have ever had. ( too many favorites) .  After a sip of this beer my mouth began to water like I was watching the cooking channel.  The drink ability of this beer is off the charts. I'm using all of my will power not to drink everyone I have in the fridge.  I can’t wait till this stuff is distributed on the regular. My trips to VT will become more regular. I hate to say it because Heady got me into craft beer but I put this one over it by far.

5/5  rDev +9.4%16 oz. can gifted from GMRFx, unknown can date but purchased at the most recent Alchemist tent sale on 08/11/2014, poured into a small plastic glass at a BJCP study group, drank 08/27/2014 over an hour.
A: 3/3 - bright golden coloration, minimal clarity (can see or read through), off-white head dissipates into a glass lacing that persisted throughout the drinking session; small alcohol legs
S: 11/12 - as expected, huge hop aroma right up front: super intense citrus and tropical fruit - mango, pineapple and papaya predominate; there is some fruitiness as well - blackberry, apricot and Meyer lemon; some alcohol and malt notes are also present but the hops are clearly the star
T: 19/20 - on the anterior tongue, there's a slight bitterness but is quickly overpowered in the middle of the mouth by huge tropical fruit and berries; the alcohol is present in the taste with some minor malt characters to hint at balancing; this is just dumb juicy and super drinkable
M: 5/5 - moderate bodied with thick hop oils coating the tongue, 7% ABV is present but not overbearing; high carbonation for style/ABV and moderate carbonation
O: 10/10 - definitely one of the best IPAs that I've ever tasted; it's like biting into a perfectly ripe juicy fruit pineapple; I wish that I can offer a flaw with this beer but, alas, I'm coming up totally short; highly, highly recommended!

It's cloudy and a golden yellow much like Heady. Taste is bursting with tropical fruit flavors, pineapple, oranges, mango, and a hint of piney bitterness. Medium body with moderately low carbonation. Overall another outstanding IPA from Alchemist. Worth seeking out. 406 charactersAaronDz, Aug 28, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.4%A: Hazey, Golden Orange, Cloudy, 2 finger white head, decent lacing and a medium-medium/high carbonation.
S: Citrusy; Pineapples, Orange Zest/Tangerines, Grapefruits.  Tropical; Guava, Mango and Passionfruit.  Dank/Grassy, Pine/Resin and lightly Floral.
T: Citrus up front; Grapefruit and Orange Zest, following into a Guava/Mango in the middle that marries into a creamy/bready malt backbone, before finishing dry Dank/Grass and Pine/Resin, the backend is delightfully bitter, the bitterness on this one builds beautifully and the taste is perfectly balanced start to finish, leaving you only wanting more.
M: Medium-Medium/Light Body while maintaining a certain chewiness VT IPA's and PA's are known for.  
O: This is a 100/100 for me, it is on my top 5 list of beers I have ever tried and isnonie of the best examples of an American Single IPA's on the planet.
Notes: Absolutely one of the best IPAs on the planet, deserving of a much higher ranking, for me personally this is better than Heady on flavor profile.  Get some if you can! 1,043 charactersVTLocal420, Aug 26, 2014

Fuller side of medium body with a sticky sweetness, starts creamy smooth and finishes dry. This is an amazing IPA, Alchemist has a way with hops. 562 charactersHopBomb515, Aug 09, 2014

This IPA of ultimate dryness and utter hop dominance brings out a taste in pale ale that's likely not yet been seen, better yet- tasted.
Focal Banger jumps right out with a burst of citrus and a backing of tropical aroma and taste. Supporting malt sweetness is thin and honied, giving the fruit flavors a sense of dripping with sweet and tangy fructose nectar. The sweetness seems right at home with the hops.
And the beer simply blossoms over the middle, really opening up those tangy and tart red grapefruit, mandarin, lemon drop, pineapple, mango and juniper flavors. And as the sweetness gently fades, the hops stand out even more, releasing notes of lemon verbena, mild chive, grassy botanicals and a floral drift of honeysuckle perfume.
its massively dry backbone becomes a honeycomb of malt texture where its flavor presence has dropped off entirely. What's left is a creamy-dry hop bitterness that strips the palate of thirst with ease. Its light body throughout perfectly preserves the attitude of American IPA. 1,136 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 31, 2014

4.87/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The best. Better than Heady, Pliny, or Crusher. Lots of hops, but not over the top. Not too thick like a lot of doubles. Just perfect.
Light color, huge smell, and epic taste and mouthfeel.
For me, Heady is too light. I call it "tine bubbles." This is thicker, but still retains the Alchemist character. 305 characterssupaadam, Jul 31, 2014

Pours a hazy yellow with strong head retention. Sipping on this is like riding a hop rollercoaster. As the sip works its way down the flavor changes a few times, starting as an intense yet well rounded piney citrus to mellow grassy notes to an intense, full, life altering multi-hop finish. One of my all time favorites, if you like IPAs you will love this. If heady is a 100 focal banger is a 101! 494 charactersbeerjunky413, Jul 28, 2014

The nose has a malty background but the Mosaic hops are very evident. The aroma has some honey, oranges and pineapple before turning earthy and grassy.
The flavor is sweet and sugary, like a citrus fructose, with the evident Mosaic hop character punching through. The hop finish is grassy, earthy, not overly bitter, with a spicy character.
The feel is so light, airy and smooth but it still has a good amount of heft.
Very well crafted IPA with some different aromas and tastes then the standard fare. 612 charactersKYGunner, Jul 27, 2014

-Pours a really nice golden color with about a finger head. Nice looking beer.
-Smells nice. Citrus and piney scent. There is definitively a strong lime scent.
-Piney bitterness with Grapefruit and Lime taking the backseat
-Spectacular creamy bitterness with the citrus lingering in my mouth.
-Overall it's a pretty good hoppy beer from the Alchemist. I did had high hopes for this brew, but it was still a treat. 481 charactersNAPO, Jul 22, 2014

A - Pours a rather light (for an IPA) amber. Fair head, average amount of lacing.
S - Citrus. Lemon, slight hint of mango. Some pine cone and earth, too.
T - Rather light for an IPA, but still has a tasty malt backbone. Slightly sweet. Citra hops are certainly noticeable. Mango, citrus (especially lime) in good amounts. Bit of pine and an almost perfect level of hoppy bitterness for an IPA.
F - Incredibly drinkable. Dangerous, actually. Crisp, but still enough kick from the malt where it doesn't venture into IPL territory. Not that IPL's are a bad thing, but it's certainly IPA feel. 
O - An outstanding beer by The Alchemist (would we expect anything different? Hell no). Not Heady quality, but you can't expect that. An outstanding beer, loved it. 803 charactersstella77artois, Jul 04, 2014

S- Nice hoppy aroma with lots of citrus aroma of grapefruit, pineapple, etc.. Nice aroma strength with the citra and mosaic coming out very nicely. 
T- Hoppy, juicy, resin, bitter grapefruit, lemon peel, guava, and other tropical fruits, finishes with a light tropical tang. This tastes amazing, the citra comes out very nicely and definitely rivals Heady.
M- dangerously drinkable, incredibly smooth, no alcohol at all, possibly the best feel for an IPA that I've experienced.
O- Each sip I take it gets better and better. Great overall offering and crazy drinkable.

Bitter, Grassy, Rind, Piney
Yeah, I know, “Drink From The Can!” I had to take a look though. Pours very hazy with a beautiful dense head. Smells and tastes like fresh squeezed hops if that was even possible. Bitterness is there but never reaches the level of no return and the palate has to deal with wave after wave of extra juicy, citrusy, piney and grassy hop flavor. Yes, it’s better than Heady Topper.

Appearance- Poured into a tulip glass. Two finger creamy white head on top of a light orange-yellow unfiltered body. If you just looked you'd think it was a hefeweizen.
Smell- Big, bright, grassy citrus, orange . Big Citra hop aroma. Really nice.
Taste- Huge hop bill, dominating everything else. The malt is almost unnoticeable. Tons of bright resinous hop, lots of orange pith, lemon, grassy flavor. Tons of flavor for a "single" IPA.
Mouthfeel- Smooth going down, with little carbonation. 
Overall- Really fantastic IPA, my first taste of the Alchemist. Decided to kill this one before taking on HT to keep the progression logical. Tons of flavor and aroma. Again, labeled as a "single" IPA, but could easily be mistaken for a "double" (these distinctions really mean something right? Not just arbitrary? Hello?) 891 charactersThepleasantimbiber, Jun 07, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%Did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper.
It was the lightest colored of the 4 beers with light yellow/golden hue. Almost like a lemonade.  On the nose I got pine and floral notes, persimmon(?) and lot's of nice dankness.
Taste: Very delicate, refreshing (perfect for a hot sunny day), piney, enough bitterness and slight chewiness.  This is a delicious beer and in my opinion (right now) superior to Heady Topper.
Overall, I had a hard time between this and The Crusher for top place but based on balance between bitterness and sweetness I placed it behind The Crusher. Oh, and this batch is much better than the previous one. 699 charactersDCLAguy11, Jun 06, 2014

Cloudy hazy lemon orange color with a huge frothy bubbly bone white head that persists forever. Citrusy tropical fruit lemony pine and resin dominate the aroma with just a bit of sweet bread deep underneath. The flavor holds a touch of lemon with lots more citrus and tropical flavors like the aroma suggested. Bread and light caramel maltiness bring in a hint of balance. Moderate level of hop bitterness with a lingering bite at the end of every sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a resinous sweet watery mouthfeel. Quite easy to drink and very flavorful, its a great beer. I prefer the depth of flavors from Heady, but I could drink this one regularly with ease. 739 charactersjohnnnniee, Jun 03, 2014

Aromas of key lime, tangerine, pine resin, and a solid bitterness, all on a light, toasted backbone. Flavors are tremendous, with a blast of tart lime and grapefruit, followed by a solid, rich, sticky, dank blast of resinous bitter. Holy hell. There is a subtle cracker backbone, but this is a compliment at best to the barrage of citrus and sticky hops characteristics coming at you. Wow. Robust, yet light bodied, which keeps the drinkability through the roof. The aftertaste is surprisingly subtle, in comparison, with subtle grass, tart grapefruit, and hints of bitterness. Smooth, slightly dry finish. Just a damn near perfect beer in this can right here! 796 charactersGarthDanielson, Jun 01, 2014

Grapefruit, and pine, subdued malt and grain, and a nice bitter finish. Another home run from the Alchemist, which I would gladly stock in the fridge if readily available. Heady light? No way.

Had this beer on tap at blackback and liked it way more. The smooth and crispness is unlike any other beers i've had recently including the HF releases. Hope they keep the kegs of this flowing through Waterbury!
A- Golden and pours with a nice head.
S-Classic hoppy alchemist smell, I don't know there's any other brewers out there that have such a distinct smell in their beers across the board.
T-Amazing, I found it to be a little less overwhelming/confusing than a Heady which I really enjoyed.
M-Cant mark down anything on the taste, I loved how smooth it was compared to other ipa's with a 7% abv.
O-Amazing beer, heady is still number one but my first taste of the focal was just fantastic. It is definitely a nice change of pace and can't wait until they begin to can it full time!
Cheers to everyone at Alchemist, another home-run. 858 charactersTmyhre802, May 29, 2014

Pours a deep golden yellow, almost opaque, with some orange tints. 2 inch fizzy head slowly recedes into lots of sticky lacing on the glass. Really a beautiful sight, knocks the appearance of Heady out of the water.
Smells so pure and juicy, thanks to the large amounts of two of my favorite hops, Citra and Mosaic. Orange, pineapple, and a bit of grapefruit.
Tastes like a bitter dank orange creamsicle. Just pure hop goodness, they wrung some nice flavors out of the hops here. Not a whole lot of malt flavor, the malt manifests itself as the caramelized sugar on the oranges and pineapples. A little bit of pine, and some pleasant bitterness. I honestly wish this was a bit more bitter, but it's hardly a huge complaint.
Medium bodied, just unbelievably drinkable. No noticeable alcohol, a small amount of carbonation, really the perfect amount.
This isn't quite up to the level of Heady Topper, but it's pretty close. A juicy, hoppy delight. 1,038 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 28, 2014

The color is pale golden with white head with great retention. The smell is a lemon-lime like mix of hop odors with slight dank herbal accent. The feel is excellent nice level of bitterness with support of malt and practically no alcohol presence with low astringency. 
The taste is as close to perfection as an IPA gets for me -some pleasant dank hop flavors mixed with a moderate amount of citrus and tropical fruit  with a light malt sweetness to provide a foundation for the semi-bitter hops as the flavor finishes on the dry side.

Pours a cloudy whitish-gold hue with a frothy head into my glass. Can is a generic can with the Focal Banger logo sticker.
Juicy with a floral/citrus profile due to the "copious additions of Mosaic and Citra hops". Indeed.
Acidic tart grapefruit greets the tongue, followed by just a touch of mango with a chewy texture. 
To me, the finish is similar to what would happen if you gargled with hop juice. A long lasting bitterness.
All hail The Alchemist! Focal Banger will do for IPAs what Heady Topper did for DIPAs. It's just a matter of time before their second brewery comes on line. 621 charactersBrad007, May 25, 2014

O: Another distinct and enjoyable beer from The Alchemist with big hops that are perfectly balanced by sweet malts. I would love the chance to get more of this. 689 charactersFondueVoodoo, May 12, 2014

Can to Stemless Alchemist Glass
16 oz tall boy
Thanks to Jake and Mike
App- When I crack the can on this one, I do get a good solid IPA pour. The color reminds me of a orange and pineapple color combo with some decent orange and light yellows and a bit of gold. A smaller head was there and the disappears. The cling is nice down the glass and its a mix of bubbles and sediment coming towards me.
Smell- This was a good mix of tropical bursts from the hop combinations and then trails off into a bit of forest like pine and resin with a little bit of a skunk aroma to me. The prevailing citrus note is that of pineapple.
Taste- I will say I am quite enjoying this beer and I am aware its not meant to be a Heady. This was good and rated as such. The fruit and citrus forward taste from the hop combo is delicious. Prevailing fruits of orange, tangerine, pineapple dominate the front and the pine take center stage in the back.
Mouth- A creamy and airy medium body with a good medium carbonation behind. Silky like a stout, but bubbly like a DIPA. I enjoyed the balance quite a bit.
Drink- This was a treat. I never expected to land a can, because I dont trade that much, but that you fellas. This was a great tick. I love the dont be a Dbag sticker because they ran out of stickers. A good beer, could be great if not to be outdown by another beer from the same brewery. 1,396 charactersFosterJM, May 06, 2014

S-Oh my goodness, Mosaic and Citra blow the skin off my face here. Full citrus bouquet, peaches, sweet pineapple. Some earthy and viny hoppiness. Papaya! Pure, ripe fruit-juice medley of hops. I would wear this as cologne.
T-The flavor just rolls over the tongue and the hoppiness oozes into my taste buds. Mango, papaya, peach, pineapple and medley of citrus. Some bitter flower stems. Even a bit of lemon. The malt is tasty in its own right; it provides a pleasurable sweetness that pairs so convincingly with all the juicy hop goodness. Citra and Mosaic in perfect harmony.
M-Resiny. Bitterness doesn't melt the palate. Lingering flavor. Medium bodied and a bit creamy. Very drinkable; it was made to be in my mouth at all times.
O-An obvious gem. The brewery that does hops the best nails an IPA, what a surprise. So lucky to try a can of this. It is simply stellar. I love this goddamn beer. 1,024 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 25, 2014

4.89/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a bright golden orange with tons of particle matter in there.
The aroma is definitely a mix of Citra and Mosaic. There’s sweet peaches, apricot, orange peel, tangerine along with this bubble gum note of Mosaic along with its big dankness on the back end.
On the flavor, its follows with much more similarities to Heady Topper than the aroma. In the front. The front hits of peaches, papaya, guava, citrus peel, with the main flavor being grapefruit bitterness. A signature malt quality of Heady with a creamy body and a light breadiness, but still really crisp. The finish is very Heady Topper with this herbacious, floral, piney dankness.
In the end, despite the different hops, this beer follows Heady Topper very closely. Kimmich just cannot disappoint. A really hoppy and easy drinking brew along with a big dank herbacious quality in the back. 871 charactersdar482, Apr 02, 2014

A: Pours straw colored with three fingers of pillowy white head which takes a few minutes to deflate, leaving a wall of sloppy lacing.  Very good retention.
S: Pineapple, mango, candied fruit, with a light floral note and light crackery malt in the background.  
T: Creamy mango and pineapple with a bit of flowers on the backend, finishing with a somewhat sweetish malt character and a slight bitterness to offset.
M: Mildly creamy, medium-high carbonation with medium body.
O: Tasty, refreshing pineapple-forward IPA.  Probably my second favorite IPA from Alchemist after Heady. 610 characterspmarlowe, Mar 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Alchemist - Focal Banger, poured into a Lawson's Tulip.
Look - Pours a cloudy protein coagulation sediment laden orange juice with a good sized foamy head that dissipates slowly. New batch, no more protein BS.
Smell - Aroma is ciltrus grapefruit and passion fruit, some sweet mango.
Taste - There it is! Nice blast of grapefruit and pine. Clean and finishes pine bitter. Got a nice tinge of that semi-ripe that some of the newer hops have in there.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Similar mouthfeel to Heady Topper here, juicy and drinkable, packs a punch. I prefer this to Heady, it's lower key and smoother, but doesn't sacrifice hop flavor at all.
Overall - Heady's litter brother. This is a great beer. They just need to clean up the coagulated proteins next time and I can rate it higher on appearance, didn't affect the taste in the least bit. Second review, this is still Heady's little brother, but I think it's better than Heady. 966 charactersJMScowcroft, Mar 21, 2014

Appearance: translucent orange/yellow bodied beer with tons of suspended white chunks in the beer. 3 fingers worth of bone white head that leaves behind a thick lacing of head on the side of the glass. The head had alot of staying power and eventually drops to a thin cap.
Smell: sweet citrus mostly oranges are what I smell immediately. Grapefruit and resinous pine notes next. Hint of tropical fruits. Slighty biscuity malts and maybe even a hint of honey. 
Taste: Mild almost moderate bitterness from this hoppy beer. Oranges and tropical fruits. Grapefruit and resinous pine. Hops taste dank and dirty; just like Heady Topper does. Finishes with mild bitterness; mostly grapefruit rind and resinous pine. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied beer with low carbonation. The beer is really really crushable, but its slightly watery. Just a slight fizz as the beer goes over your tongue. Needs more carbonation, but I will give it a decent score because of the drinkablity factor.
Overall: I like Focal banger better than heady topper. Citra and mosiac hops are always an outstanding combo! 1,121 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Mar 19, 2014

Beautiful aroma, full of hops and that "typical" Heady smell. Really feels like a lighter version of Heady Topper, perhaps even a little more drinkable? Smooth, almost buttery mouthfeel.

A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains an excellent blend of fruity citrus, floral hops and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with a quick burst of citrus and caramel sweetness. Then a strong but not over-powering floral hops bitterness comes in. The malt character is a bit on the thin side for the style but it works quite well for this beer and provides a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a tremendous beer to drink for a very long time. 843 charactersTheManiacalOne, Mar 03, 2014

S- The aroma is excellent, highlighted by dank tropical fruit, lemon zest, and biscuity malt. Mango, blueberry surprisingly, orange, some mossy/earthy/herbal notes, and some yeast at the end. Some peach as well.
T- Pretty dank, juicy, and earthy. Actually hits a lot of notes that Heady does, which must be attributed to the yeast. Bitter citrus is prominent, but some sweeter peach and mango notes are there as well. Herbal and resinous, this coats the mouth and is bitter from the middle through the finish. The biscuity malt backbone is nice and crisp.
M- Coating, dry, bitter, and biscuity. Plentiful carbonation, and a medium body.
O- Very good IPA! The tropical fruits in the nose would make this world class if they were as prominent as in the flavor, but still an excellent beer! 921 charactersSadMachine, Mar 01, 2014

Appearance- Cloudy orange with lots of yeast floating around. Quick one finger white head left some nice lacing.
Smell- Peaches for days. So much tropical fruit! Tangerine, nectarine, oranges. Very fruit forward with some mild grassiness. Smells like a peach ring.
Taste- Peaches, pears, oranges, floral herbacuesness. Lightly piney with similar earthy notes, but again, very fruit forward. No booze hint either.
Mouthfeel- Pretty spot on. Good medium-full carbonation with a medium body and no booze heat.
Overall- I really hope they start canning this soon. Love that mosaic! 657 charactersSeanniek91, Feb 27, 2014

Pours hazy, dirty gold color with soapy eggshell head that settles to a nice layer. Looks like an Alchemist.
Aroma is bright juicy orchard fruits with peach, nectarine, tangerine, apricot, and pink grapefruit. Tropical mango and guava to top it off. Just juicy all around.
The palate explodes with grapefruit rind, pineapple, peach, Meyer lemon, spice, some dank junior, and just a touch of crisp malt to round things off. Very much in style with its big brother Heady, there is a ton of hop character with a clean malt profile and a fruity, spicy yeast ester base. It takes you in so many directions, wanting to go fruity, spicy, earthy, dank, and floral all at the same time but overall maintains a central focus. Top notch.
Mouthfeel is perfect for an IPA. Slightly heavier side of light body with a fluffy carbonation that sits well on the palate and makes you go for another drink. 
This is one of the best single IPA's I've had. Such potent hop character and a great use of the Citra and Mosaic hop variants. The similarity to Heady must come from the malt bill and yeast strain used. I might have actually enjoyed this a bit more than Heady. Hope this gets canned on a regular! 1,218 charactersMarcWP, Feb 26, 2014

Appearance: Pours a very hazy, orange-tinted honey-amber and leaves a finger of slightly off-white head which lingers for a bit before fading to a layer atop the beer, leaving some lacing on the glass.
Smell: Big citrus/mango hops. Some resin, hint of pine. Lots of tropical notes. Really expressive and powerful aroma. Mouth-watering.
Taste: Matches the aroma well, but a bit more pine. Citrus, mango, pineapple, resin, a hint of honey, earthy notes, orange rinds. Huge hop presence. Finishes smooth and a little bitter.
Mouth-feel: Well carbonated with a medium, slightly creamy body. Finishes smooth - the 7% is well hidden.
Overall: Another really nice IPA from the Alchemist. Plenty of similarities to Heady Topper but definitely has its own personality. Refreshing, but with really big flavor. Really tears up the palate with the hop explosions. 956 charactersResuin, Feb 22, 2014
4.53/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Focal Banger pours a hazy honey yellow with a small, creamy head on top. The foam fades quickly leaving spots of lace all over the glass.
The aroma is loaded with citrus and a little funk. Orange and grapefruit with tropical fruit and a little vegetal (garlic) note. 
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is creamy with moderate carbonation. The flavor is nicely balanced between grapefruit and lemon citrus, pine and tropical fruit. Sweet malt balances all the hop bitterness. It finishes mildly bitter and dry with a little vegetal funk. Once gone the citrus and tropical fruit lingers on the palate.
Delicious, well balanced beer. Not as bitter as Heady Topper, but just as flavorful. 689 charactersWanderingFool, Feb 22, 2014

Pours a hazy yellow orange with some floaties and a two inch white head that leaves loads of lace. Smell is tropical mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and a hint of grapefruit. Taste follows the nose everything thing blends perfectly, maybe a little more grapefruit lingers on the tong then you would expect from the nose. Body is medium large for its abv, plenty of life, a touch dry, and amazing drinkability. One of the best ever, as I expected. 501 charactersSawDog505, Feb 21, 2014

Smells chalky with fresh mashed tropical fruits and orange sherbet with a hint of vanilla.
Taste follows the nose, citrusy hop forward, dry, chalky, grapefruit crush and a hop bitter finish.
Medium body ale with a light fleeting foam feel.
Overall a bit sharp on the grapefruit that kind of thins it out. 356 charactersWillytee3, Feb 20, 2014

A: Hazy orange with a nice 1/2in white head. As the head receded it left nice lacing on glass.
S: Juicy citra and mosaic hop aroma. Lots of citrus fruits, and maybe a tiny bit of hop resin.
T: Taste follows the nose in a great way. Citrusy hoppy goodness. Conan yeast comes through plain as day, so there are some definite similarities to Heady, but Focal does not have the malt backbone of Heady, the flavor is all hops and that yeast. 
M: Good carbonation, similar in feel to Heady IMO. Maybe a even a bit more drinkable.
O: Excellent IPA. This, HF Susan, and fresh Lawson's Triple Play are all in a dead heat for best IPA to my palate. Looking forward to when this is more regularly available. I know this is still a work in progress and they are still finalizing the malt bill, so I'll be curious to try the final version, but this is pretty close to perfect for me. 923 charactersbahnfire, Feb 20, 2014

Smell is very vibrant, grapefruit and pine mostly. Very juicy. There is a lot of flavor in this ipa. Everything from the aroma comes through. Very resonious. Mouthfeel is very slick and creamy, hops just hang around for days on the taste buds. There isn't a ton of tropical flavors, or really anything special, but there is a ton of flavor here and I love it. Just a well done, grassy/piney ipa with a touch of grapefruit. Similar to HT, but not as heavy 567 charactersMikeypnh, Feb 20, 2014

3.92/5  rDev -14.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Great deal of hype surrounding this one, much due to the notoriety of Heady Topper. If they can make such an outstanding DIPA, why not an AIPA? Well, I must say, as much as I wanted to love Focal Banger, it severely underwhelmed me unlike their previous draft release, Ourborous. 
If you're from Vermont, you're probably familiar with Fiddlehead IPA. It's a very decent American IPA that I'd never turn down yet also never seek out. Focal Banger, to me, has all the trappings of Fiddlehead IPA with much, much, much higher expectations. As such, as my good friend put it, "it's everything that Heady Topper is not," and that's not necessarily a good thing.
Try it for yourself, but don't expect too much. 706 charactersBTVflatlander, Feb 18, 2014
4.96/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I wasn't able to get any of the canned release on Saturday, Feb. 15, so I consoled myself over a fresh pour at The Reservoir in Waterbury while watching the Canada/ Finland hockey game.
This may be the best beer (iPAs are my specialty) I have ever enjoyed. It combines the best of my two favorite beers into one beer that is eminently quaffable. I liken it to the perfect combination of Heady Topper and Lawson's Double Sunshine.
Sometimes a Heady (more often than not, at these times it is my second, third, or fourth Heady) is just a bit too citrussy for my palate. Those are times when a Double Sunshine will cut through the flavor of a Heady to deliver a cleaner, sharper hop-high.
Now i am too respectful of the integrity of the brewers and their brews ever to mix myself...and now that temptation is forever removed. I cannot wait for more to appear in cans. 867 charactersunclejimmyjim, Feb 18, 2014

Pours a slightly blonder hue than Heady. Hazy, light golden with a finger of head that dissipates.
Smell has some pine on the front end and a whole lot of Citra comes barreling in with juicy aromas.
Taste is delicious. It's juicy with more mango, pineapple, even a touch of peach. Felt the grapefruit was there but is not as pronounced as it is with Heady. The taste of Focal Banger is a clean and juicy and drinkable IPA.
The mouthfeel was maybe a touch more thin than with Heady, not as silky. But refreshing!
Overall, Focal Banger is certainly an amazing IPA. This beer is going to be canned regularly once the second brewery is opened. Once more people get to enjoy this beer, Focal Banger will be one of the best reviewed beers on BA. Book it. 795 charactersBoldRulerVT, Feb 17, 2014

A- Pours a nice translucent pale golden yellow with just a slight haze, perfect amount of carbonation with an awesome consistency, about a finger and half of white frothy head forms that has excellent retention slowly receding to a thin layer.
S- Nice hoppy pine resin aroma balanced with lots of citrus fruits of grapefruit, starfruit, pineapple, etc.. Nice aroma strength with the citra and mosaic coming out very nicely, possibly my two favorite hop aromatics.
T- Piney hop resin, lightly bitter grapefruit, lemon peel, star fruit, guava, and other tropical fruits, finishes with a light tropical zestiness. This tastes amazing, the citra comes out very nicely and is up there with all the top IPAs I've ever had, definitely rivals Heady.
M- Insanely drinkable, incredibly smooth, some light hop oils, no alcohol at all, possibly the best feel for an IPA that I've experienced.
O- This is the second can that I've opened, each sip I take it gets better and better. While Heady might be slightly more flavorful, Focal Banger definitely beats it in drinkability even though it's only 1% lower. I'm looking forward to this becoming a regular offering from The Alchemist and while they are still tweaking the malt bill for their final recipe, I think this is almost perfect already. 1,427 charactersjaasen64, Feb 17, 2014

App- hazy yellow-orange body, fair one finger white head, some retention, some lacing. Looks awfully identical to the Heady I had sitting next to it. 
Smell- juicy citrus, mango, pineapple with just a hint of bread and biscuits backing it all up. Smells great and certainly promised to be a hop-forward beer. 
Flavor- similar to the nose but even better. Insane juicy citrus and passion fruit notes with a nice semi-balanced biscuit and caramel sweetness. Not particularly bitter either. 
Mouthfeel- medium bodied, similar to Heady Topper. Good carbonation. Not terribly bitter. 
Overall- very juicy and more fruity than Heady Topper, and less bitter to boot. Excellent IPA. Glad this is coming into full production. Thanks Laura!
Re-reviewed: had this out of a tallboy can 5/7/2014. Thanks Joe. This one essentially supports my first impression based on a tap pour. So juicy, hop-forward with just the perfect amount of biscuity malt backbone that I prefer, with a great mouthfeel. Glorious IPA that I wish I could have more of. 1,134 charactersStevedore, Feb 13, 2014

Hazy yellow-orange pour into a Hill Farmstead wine glass (as is the way of things at Blackback), topped with a small, creamy, white head that retained well and left some strands of lacing on the glass. Aroma of citrusy hops, tropical fruit, some pine, fresh cut grass. An assertive hop bitterness right up front in the taste, all the qualities detected in the nose, grapefruit, mango, grass, some light floral notes, with a soft, bready, pale malt profile. It's about as hoppy/bitter as Heady Topper, but a bit lighter and softer, and at only 1%ABV less, it's pretty comparable overall. Light-medium body, crisp and dry, and easily drinkable. When this goes into bigger production, trying the two beers side by side will obviously be something I look forward to doing. 805 charactersRifugium, Feb 07, 2014
