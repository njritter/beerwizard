4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- The beer poured a deep murky brown color with mocha bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. 
Smell - The nose is that of magnificent sweet dark fruits with a hint of booze. 
Taste - I detect prunes, nuts, caramel, raisins, and a slight vanilla presence with the wood coming through at the end. The overall profile is like that of a port. 
Mouthfeel- Even with little carbonation, this still seems a bit thin. 
Overall - I wanted this one forba long time. It was worth the wait. 497 charactersJohnnyHopps, Oct 30, 2016

S - Caramel, dried figs and dates.  
T - more of the same, with thick sweetness and slightly oxidized sherry notes
F - really thick, almost no carb
Overall an amazing beer, but the low carb does pull it down from being the best it can be 322 characterspagriley, Sep 22, 2016

Overall, a delicious and very drinkable BA ale. 315 charactersFFreak, Sep 10, 2016

Smells of caramel, dark fruits, chocolate, tobacco and oak. Tastes of dark fruit with sweet flavors of chocolate, toffee, brown sugar blending perfectly with flavors of soy, oak, bourbon, leather and tabacco. Almost zero carbonation with a slightly sticky mouth feel that helps give this virtually flat beer some body. Overall, an amazingly delicious and complex BA old ale. The lack of carbonation may throw some people off, but doesn't take away from the drinking experience to me. 570 charactersOleDixie, Jul 08, 2016

poured into a snifter
A- pours a deep murky brown color with just a wisp of fizzy head that disappears immediately, leaving nothing behind
S-  tons of dark fruit and oak on the nose.  Strong raisin, fig & date. Also plenty of earthy tobacco & leather that mixes with a sweet caramel, toffee & brown sugar character.  The three years of oak aging brings out strong woody notes that give aromas of wet oak, earth & a hint of vanilla.  Incredibly complex
T- the flavor lives up to the aroma in complexity.  Opens with tons of dark fruit; fig, raisin, date & plumb.  Mid-palate brings lots of earthy flavors of tobacco & cocoa.  As it nears the finish, plenty of oak kicks in with flavors of wet wood, vanilla, caramel/toffee and a hint of chocolate on the close.  The linger extends to dark fruit flavors long after the finish
M-  as with most HOtD beers, carbonation is virtually zero, but the mouthfeel is thick enough to match up to the abv.  Velvety throughout, with just a hint of abv warmth on the linger
O- one of the best old ales I've had.  The complexity of this beers is insane and goes down way to easily.  World class for sure 1,154 charactersTreyliff, Apr 16, 2016

S: Bourbon, vanilla, and aged oak
T: Initial burst of soy, met with a complex melange of cocoa, light roasted coffee, plums, blackberries, and dark fruits
F: Medium body and absolutely no carbonation
O: This is another interesting and complex old ale from HotD. I thoroughly enjoyed this 2014 batch that was replete with several nuanced and well blended flavors. 439 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 14, 2016

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2512oz bottle of the 2015 vintage. Served in a snifter glass.
Pours a dark mahogany brown body, half finger white head with minimal retention, no lacing. It's pretty short-lived, but not to the point of clearly lacking any carbonation. Smell is rich dark fruit, bourbon, sweet chocolate malt, tobacco, touch of smoke, lots of oak. Complex and sweet, a touch boozy. Flavour is similar in its complexity. Dark fruit, a bit of smoke and ashiness, tobacco, char, chocolate, molasses, plenty of bourbon. Hefty bourbon presence is quite nice in mellowing out the rest of the beer which may otherwise be overwhelming. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lower in carbonation but still reasonably carbonated. Mild bourbon heat on the finish. Very nice and complex beer with a lot of flavours going on here, and certainly superior to the Rye version from 2015. Not flat, but carbonation is not ideal either. 889 charactersStevedore, Mar 20, 2016

Aroma is intense on dried fruits, mostly figs and plums, with a fortified wine character. Taste is also very fruit forward, sweet but not cloying, syrupy, sticky, woody, intense and complex. Body is heavy, almost flat, a bit boozy as well. Feels like a liquor. Complex taste and aroma but feels too boozy and flat to be up there with the best of the style. 397 charactersCiocanelu, Jan 30, 2016

The flavor is sweet chocolate malts, dark fruit, roast and some strong bourbon alcohol.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with no carbonation.

Aromas of molasses, sweet toffee, dark caramel, leather, dark fruit. 
Taste is oaky vanilla, brown sugar, sweet caramel and toffee, followed by a roasty dark chocolate. Uncarbonated and medium body, not as thick as I was expecting.
Interesting.. This one was complex but a little too syrupy for me, especially because it was uncarbonated.. Decent and worth a try 467 charactersgcamparone, Jan 21, 2016

A:  Deep mahogany in color, viscous, with virtually no head or lacing upon a moderate pour.
S:  Tons of caramel and burnt sugar at the front of the bouquet.   At the edges, booze, sweetened.  Notes of pit fruit linger.
T:  The pit fruit aspect is more forward on the palate, with notes of plums and dates joining the caramelly overtone.   The tobacco notes so prevalent in Adam are a little subdued here, presumably from how barrel aging rounds and smooths the flavors.  Raisiny, maybe some holiday spice mid-sip, before a long, sweet, boozy finish.  
M:  Chewy, viscous, but not as much as might be expected for a 12% ABV brew.
Definitely lives up to the hype.  A delicious brew with a lot of similarities to the finest barrel-aged stouts. 791 charactersrand, Nov 29, 2015

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42015 12 oz bottle. Thanks Bob. Murky dark brown. Aroma of figs, raisins, sweet dried dark fruit. Oak, caramel, touch of vanilla. Taste is like chewing on a bourbon barrel flavored tootsie roll. Brown sugar, boozy without the heat. Mouthfeel is watery and uncarbonated. Seems out of place in such a flavorful beer. 313 charactersDrunkAl, Nov 17, 2015

Great aroma, though, even with my cold - I got the nice vanilla and bourbon notes. Taste was intense vanilla and strong, boozy bourbon. Too boozy, to be honest. Perhaps this ages to perfection, but this version was not the right balance to me. 304 charactersLouZ, Nov 12, 2015

Dark brown pour, almost black, completely flat. Smells like apple brandy, cherries, plums, figs, cocoa, vanilla, bourbon and alcohol. The taste is very well balanced and quite complex, with notes of coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate up front, followed by cherries, raisins, plums, figs, vanilla, maple syrup, brandy/bourbon. After a while, I can identify some tobacco in there, as well. Very smooth and silky texture, especially due to the complete lack of carbonation. Sweet, bourbony, aftertaste. Definitely a world class beer. 611 charactersMarius, Nov 07, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Reviewing the 2015 version
- Pours deep murky dark brown, completely still.
- Aromas of smokey oak and bourbon, but not overly aromatic (probably since still).
- Flavor is oaky tobacco, leather and sweet whiskey. Very deep and well rounded, not sharp, but still intense. The 3 years in barrels really tames the booze. The mouthfeel takes some getting used to since it is completely flat.
- This beer is so unique and outstanding, I enjoyed every sip. Love the unique flavor profile, so complex with the huge oak mixed with the bourbon, leather and tobacco. Certainly not for everyone because there is no carb and it tastes like you soaked a cigar in a glass of whiskey.
Note: I've had the 2011 version which is carbed, but I actually prefer the 2014/2015 which are flat. 774 charactersdeschutes_fan, Aug 19, 2015

Pours a murky brown with very little head and minimal lacing. The nose presents rich dark fruit and sweet, sweet bourbon. The taste - thankfully - follows suit, with toffee and caramel in tow.

Beautiful burgundy colour without an ounce of carbonation (as foretold by many) with a robust aroma of figs, dried stone fruit and a variety of woods.  The slick mouthfeel finishes with none of the alcohol heat I'd expect from +12% ABV.  Taste has more depth & layers than I can begin to list, but combine to a warming and delicious well balanced barley "port".  The nicest port I've ever enjoyed!  This was a 2014 bottle that could have aged much longer. 561 charactershopsolutely, Jul 24, 2015

A: Dark muddy brown with no head. What you would expect from a BA old ale.
S: Intense heavy malty notes with some vanilla and oak from the wood. Finishes with some nice bourbon heat.
T: Way less flavorful then I was expecting. The flavors in the aroma are there but they taste blunted. Disappointing.
M: Nearly uncarbonated and a little thin.
O: Very slightly above average for an old ale. Nothing special. Not worth seeking out in a trade especially given the asking price for it. 640 charactersjvillefan, May 31, 2015

Flat and mahogany brown. 
The nose is ensorcelling, deep, and bizarre. It smells like...Arby's? Meat and cheese and horseradish. Also booze though. Scotch. 
It's a delicious beer, if thin and almost perfectly flat. Fruity notes, some chocolate and toffee. 
Great, but normal Adam is just so good. 315 charactersAgentMunky, Feb 20, 2015

The flavor on this beer is all over the place, in a peculiarly good way. Sweet caramel and dark fruits up front, then an alcoholic heat, followed by residual oak and earthiness, finishing with leather and tobacco notes. 
2011 is adequately carbonated, 2014 is flat, though carbonation has little effect on how enjoyable the beer is. 2014 might have a slight edge on 2011 in terms of taste. 
Overall, a very interesting and well executed beer. 547 charactersrodmanfor3, Dec 08, 2014

4/5  rDev -10.7%Bottle: Poured a murky dark brown color ale with zero carbonation. Aroma of tobacco, bourbon, light vanilla and molasses is quite singular. Taste is also dominated by tobacco with some molasses and bourbon notes clearly identifiable. Residual sugars are also easily identifiable with light warming alcohol. Body is quite full with almost zero carbonation. This is almost like drinking an old sherry or xeres and makes for a perfect nightcap. 441 charactersPhyl21ca, Nov 06, 2014

4.93/5  rDev +10%The beer comes in a murky dark brown.
The aroma offers rich dark fruit soaked in a pungent sweet bourbon. An intoxicating combination of fruit, sweetness, bourbon.
The flavor follows of sweetness in the front of toffee and caramel. Then in the middle is leather and tobacco. The beer transitions to a touch of chocolate, almost towards roasted malt. Then there's more sweetness of brown sugar.
The lack of carbonationis not a big issue and I thought it would be. The complexities of the beer linger and the medium plus to full mouthfeel make up for the lack of carbonation. 576 charactersdar482, Nov 04, 2014

A- Flat as my high school girlfriend. No head ever forms with sparse carbonation appearing in disappearing within three second. Color is a deep, rich mahogany with some light pushing through on the fringes.
S- What a bouquet. Caramelized raisins sprinkled with brown sugar. Backing all of this up is some firm oak and vanilla.
T- Drink this just below room temperature. I started drinking at refrigerator temp, and wasn't a huge fan. Once it warms, though, it opens up beautifully. All the sweet flavors mentioned above are balanced out by the superb oakiness. So smooth with hardly a trace of the 12% alcohol.
M- Again, drink it warm. Body felt thin and awkward, again, like my high school girlfriend. However, as it warms, it matures and the body is more robust, complimenting the flavors beautifully.
O- If you read this, heed my advice: don't bother letting this get too cold, as it must be had warm. Unless, of course, you enjoy muted flavors and a thin mouthfeel. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and am eager to try the cherry variant. 1,190 charactersjbwimer, Jul 16, 2014

Pours opaque black, no carbonation, the end..
Aroma is huge charred dark fruits like raisins, figs, prune. Spiced rum, smoke, leather, oak, scotch, dark caramel, and hints of cognac. Tremendous nose on this and like Cherry Adam is among the best for Old Ales.
The taste is huge leather, caramel, fig, smoked maple syrup, old raisin, shaved wood, Brandy, and vintage rum. Sweeter than base Adam, with deeper booze and dark fruit flavors. Also has an earthiness to it but it's possibly the oak tannins reacting with the smokiness of the beer.
Mouthfeel is slick, sporting a light heavy body. No carbonation, I think Cherry had a just a bit. The lack of carbonation really isn't a spoiler. Just makes for a different drinking experience.
This is wonderful. It's meaty yet sweet like dessert. But it's not cloyingly sweet as the oak really drys out the finish. I think the lack of carbonation is what gives the impression that the beer is sweet since there are no scrubbing bubbles to clean the palate. I love the aroma, enjoy the flavors, and would be ecstatic to have this around all the time. I still think I prefer Cherry Adam though. 1,182 charactersMarcWP, Jul 16, 2014

Aroma of leather, booze, cigar tobacco, damp aged oak, bourbon barrel char and vanilla. Big dark fruit presence with some more tart, sweeter fruits. The taste follows with a big damp woody, oaky booze with a lot of fruit - notable tartness on the finish.
This is outstanding, very glad demand was down and I got several bottles. This will be fun to revisit the next few years. 481 characterstimc100, Jul 12, 2014

The beer pours listlessly and limply from the bottle, dark cola brown color, burgundy hues, lacking in opacity with no head or lace to speak of, just dead and flat (which is stated on the label.) The aroma is very complex, huge fruit character, plum, prune cherry, dark grape, definitely get the vinous thing, not tart, but just vinous, lots of oak, leather, tobacco, spice, rich grain, and alcohol. The base beer really shines, while the oak aging just adds to the complexity. The flavors follow suit, so much character from so many layers of flavor. Beautiful fruit, layered earthy flavors of tobacco, spice and molasses while oak and toffee play with the rich grain that finishes a bit leathery with some potent alcohol heat. The balance is good and definitely improves as the beer warms up, really showcases everything that this beer has to offer. The body though, lets the beer down, it's flat. Yes, it's stated on the label and no, it doesn't kill the beer completely, or really to that big of a degree, but it feels so weak. It struggles to coat the mouth or dazzle the tongue and finishes a bit watery.
Verdict: I liken this to something like a tawny port wine, a very fine one at that, but with so many flavorful and complex oak aged beers on the market, this just doesn't seem to match up with a flat body. I definitely enjoyed sipping on this over the course of an evening and it was a lovely after dinner beer, but the potential for true greatness slipped past this one. 1,564 characterskevanb, May 27, 2014

Bottle to HOTD Tulip
12 oz 2011 Vintage
App- A purple/red creamy looking pour. Very little in terms of bubbles/head or lacing. Just flat. So Adam is a different animal in terms of bubbles. I’ve noticed the base beer pours great but with barrel treatments not so much.
Smell- So with only being aged on oak, I wasn’t expecting the sweetness to it, but this had a bit of dark fruits and licorice behind it. The base of Adam came in a little bit and then evolved with a bit of the oak. A bit rustic and damp smelling IMO.
Taste- This was for me the best of the 3 Adam’s I have had. The Cherry Adam is nice, but a bit tangled in terms of flavor. The AFTW is a great beer that plays off the strength of Adam and amps it up a bit with a fine oak flavor and a bit more wispy booze.
Mouth- Medium bodied with a low carb level. Creamy dessert beer is the best way to say it.
Drink- I pretty much made a trip to PDX for this and I am glad I did. 966 charactersFosterJM, Dec 17, 2013

L: Dark hazy brown, pretty much black. No head, no lacing. Not your typical looking beer, but it is beautiful in it's own way.
A: Big bourbon and vanilla notes backed up by chocolate/caramel malt, dark fruit, and smoke. Rich and perfectly balanced between heavy bourbon notes and rich malt.
T/M: Opens up with big sweet caramel notes, moves into bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and toasted coconut. The mouthfeel is huge and vicious, and the flavors linger through for ages.
Overall, this is just about the most magnificent beer I have ever tasted. Very unique, and crazy delicious. Beyond World-class. 627 charactersSiriusfisherman, Nov 26, 2013

S: So much delicious powerful smell. Bourbon, oak, chocolate, raisins, smoke, leather.
T: Speaks very true to the smell, this is an extremely flavorful beer. The kind where a really tiny sip is all you need for a huge amount of flavor. More roasty smokey chocolatey malts with bourbon, oak, and leather in the taste. You can tell its Adam at the base, but 3 years in a barrel does so much to smooth it out and transform it into something much more complex and mind blowing.
M: Thick
O: One of the best beers out there. Its got that undeniably Hair of the Dog quality and takes it close to the apex. Even the flat 2014 batch beats out most other big barrel aged beers for me, although it is of course better with carb on tap or from 2011. Superb! 775 charactersanteater, Nov 10, 2013

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Same deal as Matt- no head appears. The head is probably a light beige but I really can't be sure. The body is more of a dark chocolate brown that a black. Almost has hints of ruby. There is also no lacing, just like Matt.
Nose- Very subtle from the bottle but it may need some time to open up. Honey, some apples, minor chocolate. There are also some raisins which are very subtle. A little more chocolate and some cocoa. Coconut and soy start to show themselves. A little disappointing after Matt. Chocolate becomes richer as it opens. 
Taste- Starts off with some bourbon, minor wood (oak) and moves into light coconut. Quite subtle which is only natural after 3 years of aging and 2 more in the bottle. I actually wish it were fresher. Slight notes of plum and raisins but I don't really get any soy at first but this does appear on the finish after my second taste. No heat at all. Much more subtle than the fresh Matt. Deceptively simple though it obviously had incredible complexity. Chocolate, coconut, and raisins are still very strong. Somewhat vinous on the finish in a very complimentary manner. Dry finish wraps this up nicely but I would probably enjoy a little bit more of a linger. Starts to show more and more presence as it opens up. Soy starts to come through more and more as this opens up but it's nice- not too sweet or sticky as a lot of soy notes in beer. Little bit of leather and tobacco meets with a slight cinnamon on the finish.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied but the lack of fullness doesn't bother me as much as it did with Matt. Slight carbonation as well but a little more zip which blends with the slight spice.
Drinkability- Incredibly easygoing. Light bit of heat that is masked well by the dominant flavor profile notes. Wouldn't pay 20 bucks for it again.
Overall- Great beer. Really solid. Definitely worth a try. Is it 20 bucks good- I'm not sure but probably not. 1,915 charactersartoolemomo, Oct 20, 2013

Pours a dark cola with a fleeting head. Not much lacing to speak of but there is carbonation. 
Smell is raisins soaked in bourbon. Delicious. I know I'm in store for something good. 
This is what I search for in beer. This taste, smooth liquid raisins aged in bourbon barrels, is so, so smooth. 
Very sticky yet smooth mouthfeel. Goes down entirely too easy for 12%. Certainly a sipper. Only thing missing is a fire on a cold winter night. 
Outstanding beer, though no surprise to anyone. Worth it if you're ever in Portland. 617 charactersCruisaC, Sep 05, 2013

M- Syrupy, tangy.

3.81/5  rDev -15%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.25 |  overall: 3.75Thanks to wsucoug96 for the bottle. Been saving this one for a special occasion. Enjoying it on my birthday. 2011 batch. Tasted 3 August 2013, reviewed from notes.
Pours a deep, sludgy, murky blackish brown. Even moreso at the bottom of the bottle as something gets stirred up from those depths. Barely any head, no matter how aggressive I pour. If I swirl it, I get a little foam sticking to the glass.
Smell is big and rich, with a lot of the deep aromas that good malty barrel-aged beers often carry. Molasses, plums, vanilla, some woody notes. Quite rich and enjoyable, but without the pop of some.
Taste is also malty, rich, and sweet, but it bogs down in the heavy fruits and syrupy sugars. Plenty of complexity, but lacking brightness, and lacking the dance of flavors - things just sort of settle in. It's got some fantastic flavors, but mostly I get a muddle, rather than the layers of deliciousness that some big barrel-aged beers provide.
Feel is not good. It's flat. I could tell that from the appearance. And I don't expect it to be bursting with carbonation, given the type of beer and the age, but I need more than this. Need something to stir the pot, to keep it from getting stagnant. It's not just flat, it's flat and syrupy, like uncarbonated soda.
Good stuff, but not what I was hoping for. It's flat, and that's problematic, as it's a heavy beer and it ends up feeling sludgy. Also, the flavors are potent and varied, but not to the degree that I'd like. Don't get me wrong, this is a really good beer. But, IMO, it's not on the level (at least at 2 years) of many of my favorites. HotD Matt, for example, has much better barrel integration and is just a much better beer. I even like the regular Adam better than this one. 1,749 characterszeledonia, Aug 11, 2013
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75330ml bottle 12,0% Abv. 
Served lightly chilled in a snifter. 
2011 Vintage. 
Appearance: Adam from the Wood looks almost identical to the regular Adam that I had back in 2011. The body is an ultra deep brown in the glass, with a back light revealing a beautiful deep red that at times seems to have a purple hue. A rough pour doesn't leave much more than a thin cap of cream coloured bubbles that fad away fairly quickly. Tilting the glass reveals beautiful cascading carbonation and a swirl coats the glass in heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: Perfect! All other breweries take note, this is how you barrel age a beer! The barrel character is mellow but still well noted and adds to the complexity of the base beer, rather than obscuring it. 
The interplay between the barrel and the base beer is phenomenal and sadly almost impossible to describe, so I will have to settle with simply listing a few of the notes present in the nose: Mellow bourbon, soft vanilla laced caramel, butterscotch, a little toasted coconut, oak, brown sugar, a ton of dark fruits (plum, preserved figs and black cherries), leather, a touch of chocolate, light molasses and the faintest puff of smoke. 
Taste: Hmmm, the first thing that I notice in the flavour is a little oxidization. It is not really bothersome, but I certainly did not expect it.
The barrel character is a little milder than in the nose, but still present, offering vanilla, oak, a hint of toasted coconut and a little booze. 
The flavour is quite sweet upfront, with notes of brown sugar and dark caramel. This quickly fades into the expected dark fruits (plums, cherries, figs and raisins) as well as notes of earthy leather, chocolate and a hint of soy. 
Mouthfeel: Adam from the Wood surprisingly has a higher level of carbonation than the batch 79 Adam that I had - the medium level is a little too high for my tastes, but is smooth enough to not warrant any vigorous swirling. The body however is spot on - just shy of full, but quite sticky and mouth-coating. 
Overall: Adam from the Wood is an outstanding barrel aged old ale and had it not been for the little bit of oxidization in the flavour, I am quite sure that it would have been in my all time top 5 beers. 2,218 charactersThehuntmaster, Aug 08, 2013

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I believe Jeff provided this one... huge thanks to him for nailing yet another one of my long time wants. 2011 vintage, 12 oz. bottle edition. It pours deep brown, very nearly black, with some dark ruby edges that only pop out when light is shining through the beer. The khaki head sifts quietly on top of the brew for a while before misting into a chunky ring and collar at the edge.
It's got an aroma that would only be fit for a Hair of the Dog brew; figs, raisins, woody oak, prunes, soft leather, tobacco, bourbon, back end anise, and a never-ending battle between sharp booziness and balancing sweetness that keeps you guessing with each and every whiff. Just like many other Hair of the Dog beers, Adam From the Wood's complexity is something to ponder.
Warmth only brings out more nuances and opens this thing up like Pandora's box. More sticky molasses sweetness, more booze-soaked, dense oak, dark fruits, leathery tobacco; approaching perfection for the style, no doubt. In all honestly, I enjoyed the nose on Matt just a bit more, but that's like saying I like the Corvette ZR1 better than the Z06. They're still both fantastic.
A surfboard of oak crashing across a wavy ocean of smooth bourbon with black cherry, date, and sweet raisin buoys engulfs your palate with even the tiniest sip. Warming up to Adam From the Wood, it starts to reveal its sweeter side, with generous helpings of burnt brown sugar, mild vanilla, and more of that signature "leathery tobacco" that Hair of the Dog is notorious for.
Even the smallest sips contain so much action; the flavor density of this brew is phenomenal. A lingering finish of brown sugar, dark fruits, and boozy oak keeps your palate happily waiting for the next sip to come its way. Monstrous in terms of body; this thing is huge, sticky, heavy, and chewy, and will coat the inside of your mouth like honey. Low carbonation, understandably, lends a hand to the smooth mouth feel.
Glad to finally get a chance to try this beer and see what everyone has been raving about. No wonder people love it. As good as it is, though, I still prefer Matt just a bit, as it's slightly more complex, yet even more drinkable, or at least as drinkable as any 10% ABV old ale could dream to be. No matter, Adam from the Wood is fantastic, and I need to keep my hunting spears ready when the next batch is (hopefully) released. 2,373 characterstectactoe, Jul 21, 2013

Pours deep caramel brown with half a finger of tan head. Head dissipated pretty quickly, leaving only a thin ring.
Aroma has a lot of dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel and roasted malts and a very pleasant bourbon aroma.
Taste is full and rich, but not heavy or too sweet. Some sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and oak, brown sugar, mild leather. Lots of dark dried fruits. Very smooth taste. Bottle says it is barrel aged for at least three years, and the smoothness supports that.
Mouthfeel is smooth with some sticky sweetness. Finish is surprisingly dry and earthy.
This is a great beer, and I am happy to have had it. A big beer that doesn't get carried away with sweetness, and incredibly smooth, both in terms of flavor and feel. 771 characterswarnerry, Jul 09, 2013

Inky blacked out pour, completely opaque in color with a thin layering of tanned head. Collar of film retains with some streaking of legs on the glass while drinking. 
Rich, sweet and boozy in the nose with a peppering of dark fruits including raisins, dates and figs. Soft smokiness coupled with bourbon warmth, vanilla and oaky char. Truly wonderful. 
I immediately wanted to dive headlong into the glass - rich layering of sweet bourbon tones, roasted dark malts and candied fruits. Booze-soaked dates and figs with raisin and pleasantly understated leathery smoke. Heavily layered malt, warming and chewy throughout while drinking. Finishes with alcohol, oak and vanilla. 
Fuller medium body, softer carbonation, chewy and soft on the tongue. Holy crap, these barrel-aged HotD beers are seriously out of this world. Between the Cherry Adam and this I was reeling, immediately fawning all over the place, telling people how great it was. Complex, warm and explosively flavorful. I want more. 1,067 charactersxnicknj, Jun 12, 2013

From a bottle into a snifter
Vintage 2011
Drunk right after a regular Adam batch 86 and before a 2012 and 2011 Cherry Adam. 
APPEARANCE: Pours out transparent brown and produces a small, medium looking, tan head with decent retention. Head fades rather quickly to a bubbly ring. Sits dark brown in the glass, almost black, with lower levels of carbonation evident. A muddy seal brown is perhaps the most accurate color description. A faint ring remain until the end, leaving some dots of lacing down the glass. Head is a little less impressive than the regular Adam, but body is much the same. 
SMELL: Oak, vanilla and coconut with light leather and smoke notes from the base beer. Bourbon barrel is more prevalent than the base beer, but they work decently well together. Lots of oak, with some light chocolate and cherry notes. Nice stuff. 
TASTE: Oak, vanilla and caramel flavors up front, with a big, huge finish of bourbon barrel, coconut, dark chocolate and oaky vanilla again. A touch of booze, with light smoke and leather from the base beer. Bold and lingering finish is barrel forward, with plenty of booze and some light cherry notes. Very flavorful. 
PALATE: Same as regular Adam. Medium-full body, syrupy, and slightly lower levels of carbonation. Nice and creamy on the palate, goes down smooth with a slight bit of heat and burn after the swallow. Finishes somewhat mouth coating. Very nice feel. Perhaps a touch less carbonation than the base. 
OVERALL: This was excellent. It's definitely barrel heavy, but the interplay between barrel and base beer works here, with enough leather and smoke from Adam to make an impact. A really good barrel aged ale that lived up to my already high expectations. Would definitely drink this again. Cheers Claaark13! 1,892 charactersJeffo, Feb 19, 2013

Roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and brown sugar. Has a medium body. Very little alcohol presence, wood, bourbon, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and oak all come together to make this a world class brew. This is one of the best beers I have had and the only counts against it are the no carbonation and head. Otherwise, one of the best I’ve had.

3.94/5  rDev -12.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4355mL 2011ed thanks to a generous BA at Southampton Russian Imperial Stout release. Pours a clear sepia generating a denser, cappuccino head. No lacing really. Quick dissipation. Nose: oh yeah. Super tawny and old feeling, wet detritus, muted chocolate, muted peat bog. Subtle complexities with an old ale feel. Toffee, port, old Madeira. Lots of English malt character approaching something like Thomas Hardy Ale. Taste...up front it is much much sweeter than I remember typical Adam being (plums, raisins) moving to some muted alcohol heat and buttery chocolate frosting. Finish is a little bit sweet raisins, tart red wine, richer and full bodied with hints of paper that don’t materialize thankfully. Very rich. I’m not sure I like this better than normal Adam. The palate seems creamier and richer, but the taste is sweeter black barleywine. As it warms, I can really appreciate the complexities- oil, red wine, butter, acid. Yum. I’m not sure why this stayed in barrels for SOOO long and why they picked Elijah Craig, which produces vastly inferior bourbon to say Booker’s. Something smoky like Adam could do well for a short time period in a top notch Scotch barrel like Ardbeg.
I would highly recommend NOT aging this since it is A) already so old, B) is slightly red wine and port tart so may gain acidity, C) is already delicious, D) can really only gain more of an old/oxidized character. 1/31/2012 8/3/8/4/16=3.9 1,433 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

Pours a cola brown with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is lots of bourbon, oak, and caramel. There is also some smoke, a bit of tobacco, and quite a bit of alcohol. The taste is very sweet with lots of bourbon, some plum, and a hint of cherry. There is also lots of caramel, some vanilla, a bit of leather, and a light smokiness. The finish is quite boozy with lingering sweetness. Full Body. Low carbonation.

Thanks to hannont for hooking this one up...shared with the local group in a HotD horizontal alongside Adam and Cherry Adam from the Wood. poured into a HotD taster.
2011 vintage
a - like all the adam variations we tried this was dark purple maroon with a very thin head. not as nice head as the adam, but more head than cherry adam.
s - most similar to adam with a dark fruit and fig vibe. booze soaked dark fruit. nice complexity.
t - really solid and complex. boozy dark fruit. extremely tasty. big wood/bourbon flavors.
m - the most carbonated of the bunch. fairly chewy, but damn good.
o - ovearll, really enjoyable. great beer and very much worthy of the hype it receives. i've had this one before and remembered digging it a bit more the first time around, but still an incredibly impressive beer. my favorite of the three. 852 characterscosmicevan, Aug 28, 2012

Pours deep brown with a red hue small off white head
Smell is dominated by oak with some nice smokey notes from adam shining thru
Taste follows the nose as far as the oak goes but it mellows out after a few sips to the classic adam dark fruits and tobacco 
Mouthfeel is fairly thick and carbonation is on the lower side

Dark brown with reddish brown highlights with no head or lacing, this beer does have nice legs and for that reason, earns an appreciative nod from a mildly inebriated me. The nose, OTOH, is unreal. Big and boozy, yes, with vanilla and bourbon noticeable, but the Adam base is fantastic and comes through. Smoky, sweet, leathery, fragrant, bright yet mildly oxidized and mildly tobacco-like, this is incredibly complex. The combination of smoke and bourbon is unreal.
The palate opens bourbon-forward, mildly apple like with vanilla, oak and alcohol. The mid-palate is chewy, smoky, leathery and with a tobacco character that's awesome enough to make me want a pipe, this beer is a treat. Brash but harmonious, this beer is full in body, medium-low in carbonation and mildly boozy on the finish with mild vanilla and oak tannins, this is exceptionally good. Lives up to the hype IMO. 985 charactersDefenCorps, Jul 29, 2012

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is Adam aged in bourbon barrels for three years. 2011 vintage, poured into a tulip at the tasting room. 
Looks like black plum sauce. Super-thick and syrupy, the brew blocks out all light. At the absolute edges, a touch of orange is noticeable, and atop sits a very thin, silky layer of light tan bubbles.
Oh dear me, yes. The aroma’s beautiful: black cherry, leather, raisin, plum sauce, bitter chocolate, a touch of smoke, a little toasted coconut. So smooth. 
Bourbon has taken over a bit more in the flavor. Red wine-like in fruit and oakiness, with a lot of grape, cherry and berry notes playing off a hint of soy. Smoke, leather and green apple swirl in the mouth before the swallow, which is all bourbon, delivering toasty oak notes, coconut and dark chocolate.
Very creamybody — a viscous medium-full. Mild, tingly carbonation tingles the tongue. Alcohol comes through the nose a bit, but is nowhere near 12 percent.
My only complaint: I wish there was more Adam below the bourbon. Great blend though. Very rich; a beer for sipping. 1,054 charactersPhelps, Jul 24, 2012
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42011 vintage, tasted at the Tasting Room in Portland in July 2012.
Pours a deep black, heavy and oily at the edges that seems opaque, although whether from haze, or just the depth of colour, no-one will ever know. Head is a slightly yellow white that forms a filmy fine ring around the edge. Doesn't leave much lacing, but the body leaves legs as it's tilted. Looks remarkable.
Big, big aroma: booze, coconut and vanilla, and tonnes of straight, spiritous bourbon. Sharp, brusque and powerful. The oak character gives a hint of wine as well, which is a pleasant counterpoint to the big, boozy sweetness. Amazing stuff.
Light burn on the front of the palate, with a sharp hit of spirits. This melds later into smoother notes: chocolate, oak, port and a brusque earthiness that becomes dominant later, leaving a hint of oxidation and wet cardboard. Some cream characters bring up the rear. Aftertaste is very hot.
Feel is surprisingly light: certainly lighter than you expect for all the richness on the palate. But it maintains that burn from the booze meaning however the texture, you feel this beer all the way down.
I had this side-by-side with the Matt, and this was clearly the lesser of the two (although that's comparing something to near-perfection). This was sharper, crisper and harsher. But there's no doubting the complexity and scope of both these beers. They are truly impressive examples of the craft. 1,420 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 24, 2012
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5After having a conversation on here with Barrythebear, I was "assigned" drinking a bottle of Adam and Adam from the Wood and review both. I decided to drink them side by side for the sake of Science. Hooray Science!
Poured into a Hunahpu's snifter. 2011 bottle.
Appearance: Pours dark brownish black with a finger of mocha/tan head that settled down to a ring around the edge of the glass, almost stout like.
Smell: Adam turned up to 12! The dark fruits really come to the front of this one, especially the aroma of figs and raisins. The bourbon isn't as heavy as I thought it would have been, but the alcohol sting is heavier than the regular Adam, which isn't surprising. I prefer the heavier aroma of the dark fruits in this to the regular Adam.
Taste: Bourbon raisin right off the bat. Vanilla, plum chocolate, brown sugar mixed all together into a sweet nectar (of the gods). 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and ridiculously smooth. Almost like sipping on a fine cognac or scotch.
Overall: I really liked this beer, and while it's a 4.5 on my rating, I'd say it's closer to a 4.75. What a great treat from Barry, which was definitely appreciated in December 2011 when he gave me the bottle, but even more tonight when I drank it. ISO more bottles! 1,250 charactersAxic10, Jul 22, 2012

A- Pours a murky dark brown with a thin off white head and no lacing. Not the prettiest girl at the prom. 
S- Wet leather, a variety of dark fruits including plum, raisins, fig, red grapes, black cherry followed by oak, light smoke, burnt caramel, tobacco and a hint of coconut. Very complex.
T- Again leather is fairly prominent, with notes of tobacco, plumb, fig, black cherry, smoke, brown sugar, oak and coconut. Fairly sweet, but not overly so. 
M- Low to medium carbonation with a syrupy body that finishes a touch dry. 
O- Really complex and another great sipper from HotD. Would love to get another bottle and age it for a year or two. 801 charactersiadler, Jul 08, 2012
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512 oz bottle of the 2011 vintage into my Darkness snifter. 
Pours a very dark brown verging on black with some lighter brown highlights around the edges. Head diminishes quickly to a thin ring with some spotted bubbles.
Loads of fig and raisin on the nose. Bourbon plays soft vanilla and is met by the strong leathery presence of the base beer. Also, like regular Adam, I pulled blueberry here as well. This is a very rich smelling beer, decadent even.
Many of the base attributes are found here in the taste: blueberry, leather, fig, and raisin. Sweet malts play a starring role here as well. What is different from the base is obviously the barrel. The barrel aging here is very batter forward, bring a rich chocolate...German Chocolate?...vibe, which explains the coconut. Following the sip, the aftertaste is like a fudge laden ice cream sundae. 
Carbonation is a bit high but the flavors meld wonderfully and this beer is a sublime sipper. As a lover of the base beer, I am pleasantly giddy with this incantation. A must seek for sure. If you don't like this beer, please bm me and I'd be happy to work something out with you. 1,135 charactersBarrytheBear, Jun 28, 2012

a - Pours a very dark brown, almost black color, with one inch of bright white head and low carbonation evident.
s - Smells of clay, fruity malts, figs, plums, oak, light booze. Nice and sweet, but a little old/clay smell to it.
t - Tastes of dark fruits, sweet caramel malts, cedar, toasted malts, plums, figs, raisins, and light clay. MUCH better than the nose; very sweet, but very good.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, very smooth and creamy body to it. Not hot at all in the mouthfeel.
o - Overall I thought this was a really nice beer. The nose was a little old and boozy, but that booze didn't come through much in the taste. It is a sweet beer but a good one. Would like to have it again. 901 charactersmdfb79, Jun 27, 2012

Pours a burnished deep brown, thin ring of head around the edge of the glass, nary any head, sans dissipation, no visible carbonation. A truly complex nose, the light charring of the barrels produces a clean wood character to go along with the ever-present Adam leather and smoke notes, much more subtle than the base beer. Taste is equally complex, leather, smoke, some vanilla, raisins, a bit of chocolate, brown sugar, hops are a secondary partner in this ultra-complex beer of the gods. Mouthfeel is medium, not much in the way of effervescence. One of the best beers on Earth, period. Well done Alan! 684 charactersjdense, Jun 18, 2012

Split with Steasy66, others.
Muddy, murky brown with a gushing head that leaves very soon and apparently takes all carbonation with it. Vanilla and wood in the aroma. Good barrel character in taste; vanilla, booze; and roast from Adam. Yeah. Feels thin.
This is a good beer but I completely fail to see the hype. In my opinion the barrels make it whatever it is, a decent beer from a base beer that is subpar.

Thanks for opening this with me, BdubleEdubleRUN!
(Aged for 6 months)
Muddied, hazed brown in color with dark ruby edges and a very small brown head. There's not a lot of visible carbonation, though I don't necessarily need much in a beer of this style. Small dots and oily sheets slide down the glass.
The aroma is complex and incredibly nice: earthy and rich bourbon, oak, dark fruit, baker's chocolate, and a little bit of earthy/honey sweetness. Very, very nice.
The flavor, if possible, is even better than the aroma. The bourbon flavors are distinct and powerful, though they aren't overly hot or difficult to stomach. Rich notes of vanilla, wood, earth, and vanilla come together nicely, paired well with chocolate covered raisin and some fig/plum character. This is incredible stuff.
Medium bodied with low to moderate carbonation.

A - Looks like Adam with less carbonation - Very dark, murky brown coloring. 
S - Awesome barrel notes. Vanilla, ripened dark fruit varietals, milk chocolate bar, tad bit of roast, well contained toffee and caramel, a touch of alcohol at the back.
T - The oak is phenomenal. All of the notes from the aroma with a great vineous, almost earthy characteristic at rear palate. Leather, hint of smoke, heavily roasted pecans, bourbon soaked figs. Roast and dark fruit aftertaste. Does everything I would hope for from the base Adam. Overall it's less sweetness and more woody, bitter, and dry. 
M - Medium-heavy body, low but truly perfect carbonation, bitter, oaky, tannic finish.
D - A truly great expression of a totally unique beer. It smells great, drinks great, feels great. Lives up to the hype.
Edit - A revisit of the same batch at HotD's brewpub confirms that this is some stellar shit. 1,023 charactersAuracom, Jun 11, 2012

A: Dark chocolatey brown and heavy, a thin yet persistant ring of head around the inside of the snifter. Looks great.
S: A rich mix of leather, ripe prunes, wet pipe tobacco, rich vanilla, oak and crusty bread. Wow. I could keep going, too. I expected this to be much more bourbon forward, but it doesn't reach up and slap you in the face. Very nicely integrated.
T: Just like it smells. Delicious. Adam on it's own is rich and complex, but the barrel aging really takes it to another level. I'm so glad to see that the bourbon flavors are muted. It really lets you enjoy the subtleties. The oak in particular compliments the normal Adam flavors well.
M: Flawless. Medium/low carbonation, very smooth but also slightly viscous.
O: This brew absolutely lives up to the hype. One of the best I've ever had in any style, and totally unique. Seek it out. 867 charactersNarcoSolo, Jun 10, 2012

The look is nice, almost approaching black with some brown highlights. Some nice lacing, a ring of cream colored head. 
The smell has a nice cupcake bakery smell to it, fluffy vanilla and coconutty aromas that signal a lighter bourbon barrel that was used in the bottle. Some brown sugar and sweet potato like aromas in the malt, wet bourbon barrels in this. Some smoky malts. 
The taste is quite nice, some great bourbon flavors to this beer with a nice dose of smoky malts to the beer as well. The flavor is very complex and layered, some alcohol heat in the taste as well adding to the cherry like flavors and burnt caramel. Nice overall. 
The feel is pretty good, I was hoping for a little thicker of a feel but it is sticky and a littl bit of heat.

Look: Pours a very dark muddy brown in color with traces of red. A fairly small head and ok retention with some spots of lace
Smell: Upfront is quite a bit of tobacco leather and brown sugar. If you search hard enough you can find some vanilla notes and even a touch of bourbon
Taste: For me it is very similar to the nose with copious amounts of tobacco and leather. The level of flavor does not end there behind that is some nice maple syrup brown sugar and bourbon
Mouthfeel: The body is pretty thick and heavy and chewy

Pours a murky dark brown with a tan head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, molasses, citrus zest, dark fruit, and bourbon. Taste is the same with some slight leather, tobacco, and ash flavors.

Big rich nice nose. Pretty boozy smelling. A bit of rich dark fruit. Dark molasses, caramel and smoky maple syrup. Chaw like tobacco. 
Big great flavor. Maple syrup, caramel, a touch a vanilla, rich fruit. Lovely. 
Surprisingly medium bodied. Low carb. 
Overall a fantastic beer. Great all around. Easy to drink actually.  402 charactersMrVonzipper, Jun 03, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage, courtesy of classroom13, thanks Sean! Adam from the Wood pours a medium bodied cola brown in color with a one finger, creamy light beige head. It looks perfect and the creamy head stayed for the entirety of the beer. The nose is smooth and creamy. I get a lot of dark fruit and cola along with vanilla and cream. It smells like the perfect old ale. The flavors are ridiculous. It's plenty malty with just a touch of bourbon. There is smooth cream and vanilla with some figs. It's really interesting and complex. It drinks light and velvety, so smooth. I really like it although I prefer Old Stock Bourbon and Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia to it by far. The difference is the amount of bourbon. This tastes like it is aged, since it is, and is a few years old and I would assume it has mellowed out a tad. I'd would love to try this at year two from the barrel. 875 charactersaasher, Jun 02, 2012

A - Slightly tan, 1/4" head that gets down to lacing. Dark brown, decent legs. Looks really good. 
S - Spices, some oak, some alcohol, some smoke. The barrel is very present.
T - Smokey spices, some caramel from the oak, then oak, smooth finish. The smoke/roast in the middle and finish is mild, but present. Slight amount of evaporation on the tongue after it warms up.
M - Medium body that is a little heavier on the tongue, slight carbonation. 
O - This is a fantastic beer. I really don't know what else to say. 650 charactersclaaark13, Jun 02, 2012

Appearance - Dark brown, murky, with zero head. 
Smell - Vanilla, oak, caramel, malt, little bit of bourbon. 
Taste - I get a bit more bourbon in the taste than smell. It's Adam + a bit more sweetness, oak & bourbon
Mouthfeel - Not much carbonation, thick and syrupy

Appearance: The beer pours an opaque mahogany color with a layer of off white head that goes away pretty quickly.
Smell: Very sweet with some dark fruit notes and bourbon heat. I'm getting some brown sugar and vanilla as well.
Taste: Wow is all I can say. Sweet and malty, I'm getting some vanilla and brown sugar with some bourbon heat. This beer tastes like liquid bourbon candy. Phenomenal.
Mouthfeel: The body is thicker than medium with smooth carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: This is a fantastic beer. The difference between this and the regular version is huge. I would love to have more of this beer. 656 charactersoline73, May 26, 2012
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cracked this 12oz bottle after a rough day at work. I'm a big fan of opening a favorite brew after a long day.
Dark brown body, plenty of tan head. Great retention and lace give AftW top marks for the style. Surprising since Old Ales are typically ugly.
Nose is bursting with bourbon, vanilla, booze, and tons of malt. Can't say it's my favorite aroma but certainly enjoyable.
Malts and caramelized booze up front; bourbon makes its way in shortly thereafter. Leathery and tobacco-y too. Caramel and vanilla linger after swallowing as the alcoholic warmth soothes my throat. Superb.
Huge, viscous body brings everything together. Tons of well-crafted flavors make this immensely enjoyable; AftW is something every beer geek needs to sample. One of my favorites! 765 charactersbrystmar, May 22, 2012
4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle thanks to hopsbreath. Poured into a Kate the Great snifter. 2011 bottle.
Appearance - Pours a murky brown with no head. No bubbles. Nothing. Looks quite dead in the glass. A bit chunky with sediment at the end of the bottle.
Smell - Vanilla and oak barrel character. Nice. Sweet malts. A little bit of cola in the aroma. It has a really nice deep malt aroma like a sweet scotch. Touch of peat and leather. Awesome.
Taste - Less complex and a little bit more muddled from sweetness. Bourbon makes its first appearance here, though. Sweet caramel and lots of it. More cola flavors and a slight earthy flavor in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Tingly warm alcohol sensation and it's nearly flat. No real carbonation. Not as thick as I'd think or perhaps like.
Overall - It's an impressive beer with impressive flavors. Too sweet, which is strange, because Adam is hardly sweet. I'm also surprised it isn't as dominated by Bourbon. Three years is a long time. 966 charactersAlieniloquium, May 22, 2012

S - Amazing smell. The aroma is full of sweet molassis and vanilla. There is a hint of smoke and leather.
T - The taste is full of chocolate, vanilla and molasses, with a nice dose of wood.
M - Medium carbonation and full bodied. A very nice mouthfeel on this one.
O - Wow, Adam is already one of my all-time favorite beers and this takes it to another level. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and can't wait to see how it ages. I had this the same night as I had a Dark Lord and it boggles my mind how Dark Lord gets so much hype and a beer like this almost flies under the radar. 670 charactersSkiBum22, May 21, 2012

The chocolate is stronger, sweet dark fruits, notes of bourbon and faint heat. The body is a bit thinner, still silky but not as creamy, fair carbonation. Not as good as base adam but still a nice beer. 486 characterscpetrone84, May 03, 2012

Smells deeply complex and alluring. Old bourbon barrel, molasses, brown sugar, prunes, raisins.
Tastes how it smells, delicious, sweet but not overly sweet at all, once my palate adjusts it's just right. Big dose of bourbon barrel, but very well integrated, and it tastes like the barrel, not just the bourbon. That long time in the barrel really paid off.
Full bodied. Great beer, complex, balanced, and delicious. 506 charactersBeerzebub, Apr 30, 2012

A: Pours black with a few cm of dull, dark brown head which slowly fizzles away, leaving a frothy ring.
S: Big bourbon, toasted oak, winey dark fruit and cherry, and chocolate aromas. Very aromatic, and smells delicious.
T: Thick dark chocolate and dark fruit (plum, cherry), sweetish bourbon, and a lengthy cocoa finish. A little alcohol taste, esp. on the finish. More chocolate and less oak/bourbon than I was expecting. Off dry.
M: Full bodied and medium-light carbonation. A little sticky. Imparts a nice warming sensation in the belly.
O: A slow sipper with phenomenal complexity and flavors. Fantastic stuff, this shows so many flavors over the course of a bottle. Another winner from HotD. 729 characterspmarlowe, Apr 29, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks to Bgramer for hooking me up with this trade.
A - Pours nearly pitch black with half finger head with aggressive pour. Excellent lacing.
S - Sweet bourbon, toffee, molasses, raisin, plum, dates.
T - Sweet bourbon heat right up front followed by a wave of bourbon soaked raisins, figs, plum, a little bit of soy and some chocolate as well. So much going on in this one. Nearly perfect.
M - Medium bodied but may be a tad on the thin side for the style. Low carbonation makes this an easy sipper.
O - One of the best barrel aged beers that I've had. This one reminds me a bit of King Henry with maybe a bit more complexity. Perfect amount of bourbon, not too hot, not too sweet or cloying this is a top notch of a beer and worth getting your hands on a bottle if you get a chance. 790 characterspigc, Apr 28, 2012

4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours deep brown almost black with a very thin head receding almost immediately to nothing. Not unexpected from the ABV.
Tons of raisin in the aroma. A little bit of leather and tobacco along with an earthy quality and vanilla oak and bourbon.
Same flavors come through as the aroma. I get a ton of raisin and fig along with subtle bourbon, vanilla and oak. The barrel is nicely integrated and let's the base flavor shine through. A little extra brown sugar sweetness and a little sweeter overall than I'd prefer, but very complex.
Almost flat which detracts a bit, but in a style like this, carbonation levels should be low anyway.
Pretty good beer, but not sure given how much it takes to trade for, if I'd value it that high. Glad I got to try it. 754 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 23, 2012

4.0 A: Pretty damn close to black in color. Two fingers of frothy/creamy tan head. Retention is pretty good for the ABV, but no lacing is left.
4.0 S: Lots of the typical HOTD aromas in this. Caramel, brown sugar, tons of raisin and tobacco. Fig, date, and plum fruitiness in that order. This has a fairly strong earthy vinousness as well. Oak, vanilla, and peaty bourbon.
4.5 T: Tastes like the nose. Lots of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, tobacco. Fig, date, and plum fruits. Still a bit vinous, but not as much as the nose. Bourbon is peaty, earthy, and minimally spicy. Oak and vanilla are back. It's super complex for sure.
4.0 M: Heavy body. Thick and viscous. Chewy with a moderate creaminess. Moderate amylase coagulation going on. 
4.0 T: It's very tasty, but probably not worth the hefty trading value. BB4D blows this out of the water anyway for half the price. In any case, I'm glad I could try it. 986 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 18, 2012

The aroma has a bourbon soaked dark fruit quality to it. I get some raisin, plum and caramel mixing with brown sugar, vanilla and oak. The bourbon barrel really compliments very well. Great aroma to it, things really come together well in it. 
The taste has a great mix ox bourbon and sweet maltiness to it. The dark fruits, caramel and toffee of Adam really come through, but the bourbon really shines for me. I get some really nice brown sugar and vanilla flavors coming out of the super smooth bourbon. Again, It's really well balanced between the barrel character and the maltiness of the base beer. The flavors really come together well and compliment each other perfectly.
The mouthfeel leans a little towards the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall, I thought it was a fantastic beer. The bold mlatiness of Adam is perfectly complimented by the smooth bourbon. It really comes together well and they balanced the barrel and beer flavors perfectly. it was incredibly smooth for 12% as well. 1,183 charactersbillab914, Apr 13, 2012

Deep molasses with a smallish tan head that hangs around. Nice trails on swirling.
Rich malty flavours of baked caramel, fairy floss and liquorice in a sea of light smokiness and oak.
Like most of my favourite deserts wrapped up in one. Choc-caramel, sticky-date pudding, caramel butter fudge, raisins, caramelised dates, leathery oak, brandied cherries, golden syrup and stewed plums. One of very few beers where diacetyl is a desirable quality and enhances the flavours. Delicious!
Rich, palate coating but velevety smooth. Entirely appropriate. 
Relentlessly decadent brew that is an absolute must for sweet-tooths. Those who aren't will undoubtedly prefer the base beer. 721 charactersspicelab, Mar 13, 2012

S - A sweet bourbon vanilla scent with just a touch of oak.
T - A soft vanilla bourbon ale, so smooth. Its a little sweet, I think it is from added candy sugar and again there is some oak to be discovered.

Vintage 2014.
poured into HotD Tulip glass!
Appearance: dark murky brown bodied beer with a few bubbles from a hard pour. No head. Looks flat. Decent booze legs on the side of the glass after each sip. 3.0
Smell: Lots of malts and rich barrel notes. Very oaky, tannic, and bourbony. This smells more like spirits than it smells like a beer, but you can still get a small glimpse of the base beer used the old ale Adam. Brown sugar, tobacco, molasses, leather, and light meaty smoke. 4.5
Taste: Very bourbon barrel forward. Sweet, but not cloying. Bourbon, oak tannins, molasses, caramel, brown sugar, coco powder, and dark fruit malts. Hints of leather and tobacco with a slight splash of soy sauce that is slightly salty adding some contrast to the sweetness. The beer finishes with a light meaty smoke and dark fruits. Very complex flavor profile and all these flavors linger for a long time. 4.5
Mouthfeel: full bodied beer with no carbonation. Its definately flat. Slightly syrupy and coats your entire mouth. Fairly mellow, not very boozey, but you get a little bit of spicy booziness after each sip. 4.0
Overall: Yeah they said this vintage was flat and thats confirmed. No bubbles at all. 2014 AftW is still a really great beer, but not as good as when AftW is properly carbonated like the 2011 vintage that I have drank in the past. It needs carbonation, but is a beer thats still very enjoyable despite its short comings with the lack of carbonation. 4.5
2014 overall score of 4.38.

Vintage 2011.
Appearance: dark murky brown colored beer with a lite to medium tan head. The head is about 2 fingers high and slowely receded to a cap on top of the beer. Spotty lacing on the side of the glass. 4.25
Smell: Sweet malts and vanilla. This really smells like the barrel; huge oak notes. Its also earthy smelling almost like peat moss. Fairly smokey as well. 4.5
Taste: There is alot going on in this beer its really got alot of big bold flavors. Its starts really sweet with the malt profile and the barrel notes complimenting each other quite well. The notes I get from the Adam (being the base beer) are figs, smokey, caramel, and toffee. The barrel notes are loaded with tons of oak and coconut; mild vanilla, leather, and lots of bourbon. I can get both parts of the beer(the base beer and the barrel notes), but they both blend together nicely and compliment each other well. The beer has a mild bitter finish imparted by the earthy hops that seems to mix well with a warming booziness. 4.75
Mouthfeel: full bodied beer its a huge Old Ale. Moderate and lively carbonation. It quite impressive that this beer is as carbonated after spending at least 3 years in an oak bourbon barrel. This beer has a surpurb mouthfeel to it. 4.5
Overall: I really liked this beer it was great to get to try this rare treat(at least when you live in the great lakes beer region). I really enjoyed adam and adam from the wood is no exception its even better. This beer makes me happy! 4.5

Pours a dark hazy mahogany with a small tan head that recedes to a thin collar and leaves some sticky legs along the sides.
Aroma is stunning with sweet caramel malts, molasses, tobacco, leather and lots of booze-soaked dark fruits. Some raisins, plums and lots of bourbon and oak. In short, all kinds of things going on in the nose.
The taste is more of the same - so complex. There is an initial bourbon kick with the coconut and vanilla sweetness. The backbone is all about the sweet caramel malts and molasses. Sweet fruits and a dry barrel-heavy finish.
The mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with soft carbonation and oaky and dry in the finish.
This is a superb beer. The aroma is probably the best I've ever come across in the style. The taste is pretty damn close if not a notch below the aroma, but, either way, this is a fantastic beer. Right behind the Brandy Old Stock as best I've tasted in the style.
As a side note, I tasted this one side-by-side with Matt and Adam and this one was the best, no comparison. I thought Matt was world class, so I was shocked this one was clearly superior. So glad I got to try this one. 1,154 charactersgford217, Feb 29, 2012

2011 Bottle.
Poured into my Portsmouth Brewery Snifter and there was NO head at all. Just a touch of carbonation as some foam formed and vanished immediately. Dark, dull brown in color. No lace.
A bit of alcohol, molasses and woody oak aroma. (yes, it’s soy.. that’s what I smell.. could not place then later re-read the label.... yep that’s it)
Some dark fruit. Some bourbon filled chocolate candies.. (My Mom & Dad’s next door neighbor used to make chocolate candy laced with bourbon. THis tastes just like I remember that. The soy is there and the Oak is really prominent. Interesting that I don’t get any vanilla or what I would describe as Bourbon... 
Velvet like, not hot but you know the ABV is elevated.
A beer to savor and enjoy. I like it, but it’s not as epic as I thought. 872 charactersReagan1984, Feb 17, 2012

-- Thanks, Johnny --
A: Pretty enough. It's a bit darker then expected, though it's also a bit cleaner too. A good, firm pour yields a mere .25 finger head that fades quickly. No lacing or collar.
S: Herbal and a bit minty. Not nearly the bourbon bomb on the bouquet one would expect. The alcohol is well masked, but in the end it comes off a bit one note.
T: Pleasant up front, yet it's a bit stunted. It really takes a minute to open up, where the residual sugar kicks into gear on the mid. The finish showcases toasty oak, vanilla, booze and a kiss of char and bourbon.
M: The barrel really did a number on this bad boy. It's thinner then I'd like, and comes off with a real "cask" vibe. To call the mouthfeel disspointing would be accurate.
O: HotD's Adam from the Wood is a nice beer. A good beer in fact. It also screams "overhyped". Limit production, get the proverbial word out and watch the hype train roll.
Look, I liked this a lot and would without question drink it again. But when asked what my favorite barrel aged Old Ale is, I can assure you that Señor Adam de la Wood won't be topping my list. 1,182 charactersRhettroactive, Jan 24, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage served alongside regular Adam.
Pours a dark brown with a reddish hue, head is tan, beer and head are both noticeably darker than the regular Adam. Smells of bourbon and dark fruit, interestingly a bit like a quad. Taste is awesome, the bourbon really mixes perfectly with the dark fruit and the maltiness of the base beer, has notes of vanilla as well. Incredibly easy to drink for the abv, delicious! Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and pretty much spot-on. Overall, this beer is really amazing, an incredible execution of barrel aging with an already fantastic beer. 582 charactersstarrdogg, Jan 22, 2012

4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512oz. bottle poured into a snifter. 2011 release. Huge thanks to Jason for this bottle!
(A)- Pours a very dark burnt sienna color that produced some surprising tan froth considering the ABV.
(S)- A big big body of rich aromas. Tiny hints of oxidation, but tons of raisin, prune, cocoa, plum, leather, tobacco, and a dry vanilla-like oak. Even tiny bits of licorice at the end. All rich, but each part subtle and dynamic as hell.
(T)- Again, an array of wonderfully rich characters. Raisin, prune, cocoa, plum, licorice, tobacco, and a great subtle almost smoky vanilla barrel character. Lots of an almost spicy dry oak on the finish. Extremely complex to say the least and my description fails to fully comprehend it. Lets just say its tastes freaking delicious!
(M)- A mellow carbonation level that comes off extremely smooth. A dynamic and complex beer of profound richness, but expertly balanced and blended. And despite having a rather large 12%ABV, it just rolls off the tongue (well hidden).
(D)- Yet another profoundly excellent beer from Hair of the Dog. Each release just makes me more and more impressed particularly when taking into account the barrel aged beers in their portfolio. Definitely a sipper if there ever was one, but one I would and could easily have a whole bottle to myself. Right up there with Matt as their best beer I have had from them so far. 1,378 characterssweemzander, Jan 15, 2012
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 bottle. Pours a very dark burgundy/chestnut that appears near black in the snifter, with a small creamy beige head of super tight bubbles. Nose is dates and cherries soaked in brandy, leather, smoke, a touch of brine which is just classic Adam. Very decadent alcoholic details on the nose. Mouth is very creamy, rich, alcohol heat throughout, lots of dripping dark fruits in brandy, bourbon, brine and leather in the mid palate, with a pleasantly hot finish. Takes the edgy qualities of a 2 year old Adam and just adds dimensions of complexity. I've been looking for this beer, wistfully, for years and was stoked to see it was being released again, and it doesn't disappoint at all. 688 charactersJAXSON, Jan 14, 2012
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5'11 batch shared by beerdy last month. Pours a dark brown that borders on black, topped by a thin cap. The nose is rather decadent, showcasing a ton of bourbon and oak. The signature leather and tobacco aroma of Adam is still present, along with vanilla, light nuttiness, smoke and somewhat brash but not unwelcome alcohol. The palate is warming and sweet, bourbon at the forefront with plenty of oak, tannin, vanilla and caramel. Lightly oxidized, still surprisingly hot despite all the years in the barrel. The earthiness of Adam shines through past the big barrel flavors, contributing leather and tobacco, dark fruit, subtle smoke. The body is medium-full; it feels a bit more hefty than the non-barreled Adam. A fantastic beer overall, though it may benefit from some time in the bottle to tame the heat. 809 characterslargadeer, Jan 12, 2012

I found this to be pretty similar to the regular Adam in most ways (which is good), other than perhaps more of a boozy quality, naturally, from the barrel aging. Maybe more aging would accent that trait a bit more. But otherwise, the beer came to me in a HotD sampler glass (love those things), dark cola brown with a lasting, creamy tan head. Aroma of burnt caramel, semi-sweet chocolate (really like this aspect of the beer), dark fruit notes, and bourbon-soaked oak. The barrel has not detracted from the smoothness of the beer for sure; tastes of chocolate, vanilla bean, molasses, some dark fruit, licorice, and a hint of bourbony oak. Very nice. Smooth, full-bodied, and very drinkable. 
I have a few bottles of Cherry Adam that I'm looking forward to trying soon. 939 charactersRifugium, Jan 10, 2012

A: Deep, dark, impenetrable brown with ruby traces. A nice quarter finger of cream colored head that fades to a quarter finger ring around the edges of the glass. Pretty good head retention considering the ABV. Minimal spotty lacing is left behind. Loving how dark a color this is and the presence of actual head here. Great.
S: Loads of raisin, ripe dark fruit, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Lots of booze on this, this could possibly use more age. It's got an extremely sharp bouquet, with the ripe fruits and booze cutting right through. Little bit of leather and tobacco. Smells good, but I think this will continue to develop with age.
T: A lot of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, oak, brown sugar, leather, some mild tobacco, and a lot of booze. This needs another year to fully develop, but it's drinking effing spectacular right now. The brown sugar sweetness and booze will drop off and the tobacco, leather, and raisin will pick up. But that being said, this is an amazingly complex and enjoyable beer.
M: Bottom line: it's hot and fairly aggressively carbonated. Flavors are all well integrated, but the booze needs to take a back seat and I would have liked to see less carbonation on this.
O: Adam FTW doesn't quite live up to the hype, but only because people are asking for 750mL bottles of CBS for one 12 oz bottle of it. It is a spectacular BA Old Ale that should be sought and savored. Just don't trade your cellar for it. 1,463 characterssiege06nd, Jan 07, 2012

Pours a dark purple/brown. Bubbles! Even more than "barely carbonated," which is appreciated given the track record here. 
Smells are musty old barrels, wood, tobacco, dark fruit, leather. Sweet too, actually reminded me quite a bit of cherry adam. 
Dark fruits (plum, fig), leather, tobacco, typical aged Adam stuff. The barrels add another layer, musty wood mostly. No solvents, and minimal alcohol overall. I guess that's what happens when it's been sitting for 3 years. Integrated as hell. 
Perfect mouthfeel, really. Full, not thick or syrupy. Doesn't linger too long. 
Old ale, indeed. I don't think sitting on this is going to help it. It's aged already, and ready to drink. 700 characterscaskstrength, Jan 06, 2012

A turbid but still beautiful brownish red, topped by a thick skim of brownish beige head.
Crazy legs oil their way down the glass sides.
Strong aroma, full of barrel, lots of oak vanilla chocolate bits of coffee, other dark ripe fruits beyond capture, lingering sweet like pollinating flowers.
The strong flavors of this are less sweet than their description here might indicate. All the flavors of the nose front the sip, joined now by deep plum, especially as it warms. Well blended, yet well defined. Specific tastes come into the sip strongly, fade into a delicious blend at other times. The finish is kinda sweet and full of fruit, like a clean bomb of oaked flavors that are delicious.
Low carb., despite the look, full bodied (to understate), and a morphing finish of flavors of fruit whose characters have lingered strongly and made a killer finish.
Were this still drinkability a 5 here would be a no brainer. Forget it, you won't find a beer of this style of delicious and full flavor as drinkable as this. Still a 5 best of the class here. 1,121 characterscavedave, Jan 04, 2012

One of the last beers of night two. This is a biggun.
A. Bold and dark, very dark wooden brown. Looks like a clear quad. Decent tan head, fine retention. 
S. Sweet, tons of residual malt sugar. Boozy, warm and inviting - not too sharp. Oak, heavy but not overdone. Dark fruits - prune, especially, orange? Works together well, this is a massive, oaked and fruity malt bomb. Needs to be nearly room temp to fully bloom. As it warms, and as you smell this more, it gets very complex. Simply excellent.
T. Follows the nose. A sweet and almost JW Lee's like complex old ale - surely one of the best I've had from the West coast - and simply has to be tried. Layered caramel sugar, chocolate, sherry, oak, warming alcohol, Christmas fruits. 
M / O. Mellow carbonation is exactly what is needed here, and delivers. The finish is long and sweet and rich. This is a dessert beer, and quite sugary, but it is also excellent.
Adam from the Wood isn't just the best beer I've had from Hair of the Dog, it's one of the best big beers to come off the West Coast in a long time. Highly recommended! 1,146 characterskkipple, Jan 02, 2012

The beer pours a fairly dark brown color with good head retention and fairly decent lacing. The nose is attractive, showcasing considerable bourbon, along with chocolate and brown sugar. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this fairly sweet beer, but is dominated by chocolate, vanilla and even some light coconut. There's still considerable booze as well, but it's not as pronounced as I was expecting, given the aroma profile. Mouthfeel is excellent, and I just love the long, soft, almost creamy aspect to this beer. The beer finishes well, and once again I'm amazed by how well integrated the alcohol is in the flavor profile. 
Very interesting to sample the new bottled version, after having had the 2008 draft version on tap last summer. IMHO, the extended aging definitely improved this beer, as I did not find the bottled version nearly as good as the draft version. That may well change with a couple of years in bottle, but right now I would probably hold off drinking any bottles of the new AFTW, if I happened to own any (which I don't).
Edit from 3/14. Lucky for me, I now live near the HOTD tasting room again, and so get to taste this beer from time to time. As expected, time has been this beer's friend, and bottles of this now taste incredible. I have modified my ratings and score accordingly. 1,355 charactersJohn_M, Dec 29, 2011

A: Dark chocolate brown with very little head, even with a fairly aggressive pour.
S: Just fantastic. Sweet, oak, bourbon... immediately after some swirling, the glass fills with wonderful dark jammy fruit.
T: Sweet, bourbon, dark and sticky fruit, alcohol is well placed, complex but everything is in great balance. It is not just an "oaked Adam"... it is like a different beer, in fact there are parts of Adam that I did not even taste in this beer. 
M: Smooth, easy to drink. Light carbonation works well. It seems to coat your entire mouth almost like a thin syrup. 
O: Just delicious, I can't get over the smell... it was fantastic. 756 charactersbignuke61, Dec 29, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep brown with slight reddish hues. Small head, less than a finger, dissipates quickly leaving some bubbles floating about. Definitely more carbonated than Bourbon Fred which I was a little disappointed with.
Smell is simply amazing. Deep, deep, warm bourbon tones and smokey oak tones. Rich malts, caramel, maybe some plums. The barrel aging just made this beer a different creature, so great!
The taste actually tops the aroma which I was surprised. I scored it perfect mainly because of how balanced it was. The bourbon is there and great, but it doesn't dominate the beer. The multiple levels of caramel, toffee, leather, dark sugary fruits, and oak are just amazing. The beer seems to morph and reveal new layers with every sip.
The mouth feel is impressive as well, slightly syrupy, but very smooth and not too hot. Great carbonation level which real makes this beer that much more enjoyable after having tried Bourbon Fred which felt like water in the mouth. 
Awesome! Amazing! Delicious! I want more! So much more! what else can I say?...If this isn't on he top of your wants/whales list....PUT IT THERE! 1,125 charactersiflah45, Dec 26, 2011

Pour looks like Adam with bourbon colors. Deep brown with more likable level of carbonation that the other Adams. Nose is gorgeous: bourbon, wood, malty, leathery. All balanced perfectly. 
Adam from the Wood is a bloody work of art. Deep bourbon notes are almost subtle, but become deeper & more aggressive as the beer warms. The bourbon just absolutely coats everything it touches, with a long, lingering aftertaste. Sweet malts, leather, vanilla, lots of drying wood, dark fruits. A flowering field full of great tastes, wonderfully integrated. Smooth & easy, this is a beer that could be consumed in quantity.

Served with Matt, Adam, Cherry Adam from the Wood, Fred, Bourbon Fred, Doggie Claws '05.
First off, this beer's aroma is the first thing I noticed, before the appearance. This beer is heavy with bourbon and booze, Adam is one of my favorite beers under certain cirumstances, and this is like Adam on crack and whiskey, serious. Wow.
Beer is brown, mildly hazy, sweet, lots of bourbon, lots of malt, the liquor wins out there with me.
Beer is medium in body, a little thinner than expected, a little stronger than I expected, very oaky, very vanilla and bourbony, strong throughout. Very good, an interesting variant on Adam. Adam still is awesome but this beer is slightly more awesomer. 922 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 19, 2011

Poured into a matching Hotd tulip, this brew appears a very dark brown with a finger of tan head. The cap dissolves leaving a thin layering pattern across the top. When held to the light, it displays some lighter shades of brown and red coloration when tilted. A light swirl brings forth a finger of tan head and produces some spots of lacing on the glass.
The smell of this brew is crazy. It carries a very familiar aspect of the base beer but with a pleasant freshness and brighter smoked quality that is very well integrated with barrel characteristics. The first thoughts that come forth are smoked chocolates mixed with raisins, tobacco and leather. There is a woodsy quality present mixed with a tangy incorporation of alcohol that is very pleasing throughout. As it warms up, a faint amount of caramel sweetness to toffee/vanilla inclusion come forward.
The taste is bitter chocolate mixed with a solid smoked flavoring. Toasty oak character is present which really ties together the taste of bitter chocolate and smoked grain. There is a mild fruity alcohol inclusion tasting of burnt raisins which creeps down the back of the throat with some solid warmth. The aftertaste is a combination of earthy tobacco, leather, oak, bitter chocolate, smoke and a hint of fruity alcohol. Very deep and enjoyable brew that makes for quite a sipper.
This is a full bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. While the individual ingredients and flavoring of this can be picked apart as drastically unique in their own right, they really blend and tie together very well in this. This is a fantastic sipper of a brew with a great depth of character. I know it is already so many years in the making but honestly I am curious what more aging would do to this already fine example. 1,840 charactersstakem, Dec 12, 2011

After visiting Alan at Hair of the Dog last summer and learning of the release of this, I was anxious to try it. After all, I am a huge fan of regular Adam. Poured into a Hair of the Dog branded tulip.
A: Pours a deep murky brown (nearly black) with some red crimson hues when held to the light. Tried to pour prudently as to keep the sediment in the bottle. Atop the beer appears a half finger tan head. Overall, looks very similar to regular Adam. Pretty much identical.
S: A cornucopia of intense flavors just explode. The scent starts with a nice, mellow leather, followed by slight smokey ash. Smells rather dry. Followed you get sweet soy and sherry, deep purple plums soaked in bourbon. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak and more pronounced bourbon. Just so much going on. Usually when there are this many complex flavors, it can get messy. But this is just greatly blended and mellow.
T: All the flavors in the scent are there in the taste, but amped up a notch. Bourbon soaked black cherries and purple plums, smokey ash, rich dark leather, deep chocolate, and slight sherry. All mixed with a great blended bourbon flavor.
Overall, this beer is just what I expected, and more. Great job HotD. If this ages like your other beers, this will be even more heavenly in a few years. 1,338 characterstreyrab, Dec 07, 2011

A- Very dark brown. Off-white ring of small bubbles circles the glass. When I hold the glass up to the light, I can see more bubbles on the bottom and sides of the glass. Carbonation does not seem to be an issue at all.

M- Full creamy body with perfect carbonation. Light boozy/oaky heat, definitely not overwhelming as it is combined so well with many other flavors.
O- Definitely a wow factor beer. Big, complex and in your face. Just delicious and an improvement on one of my faves in regular adam. 824 charactersstx00lax, Dec 04, 2011

3.19/5  rDev -28.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 5 |  overall: 2.5Pours black with a persistent quarter finger of head. Aroma has tons of tobacco and some creme brulee sweetness. Flavor is absolutely overwhelming with the tobacco and smokiness, overpowering the barrel even. Oh my god there is so much tobacco and beef jerky and soy in this, what the fuck. I know those flavors are present in regular Adam, but this is cranked up to 11. Interesting, provocative, and unique for sure but I wouldn't use ''highly enjoyable'' on my list of descriptors. 
The body is full and creamy and perfect, but overall this beer was a total letdown. 569 charactersalcstradamus, Dec 04, 2011

A: Pours dark brown with light brown head that leaves just a bit of lacing around glass.
S: Very bold and complex with dark fruit, some chocolate with mild leather, oak and tobacco. Some alcohol presence but it is very mellow for 12% ABV.
T: Extremely smooth and robust with lots of oak, tobacco, dark fruit, chocolate malt and leather. Faint bourbon notes that I imagine have mellowed out significantly after over three years in barrels. Some warming from the alcohol but there is next to no detectable heat. This is easily one of the richest, most complex and flavorful beers that I have ever had.
M: Thick medium-full bodied with low-moderate carbonation, finishes smooth and sweet.
O: If there is any beer out there to slowly savor and sip on, this is it. So much flavor packed into every little sip. Adam is a fantastic beer to begin with, but put him in bourbon barrels for over three years and you have a masterpiece. Many thanks to Alan for continuing to create such incredible and unique beers! 1,088 charactersAzurescens, Nov 30, 2011

An outstanding beer which for me had only one minor disappointment - a would have preferred just a little more carbonation. The light carbonation left it feeling just ever so slightly thin.
Taste was incredible - think Adam with strong bourbon, coconut, and vanilla notes. The bourbon was in perfect balance with the beer and not overpowering it. It doesn't feel hot at all either - it's wonderful to drink immediately. 506 charactersrobsee, Nov 29, 2011

A: Pours an opaque, maroon body with a small percolation of brown bubbles that quickly settle out of solution and vanish. The beer is pushing the boundaries of low carbonation, but it does have bubbles. 
S: I should probably state straight up that I have a soft spot for Adam (one of my favorite beers, and particularly one of my favorite old ales) as well as its variants. The aromas of aged base Adam shine through: tobacco, leather, smoke, chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit. On top of that is the barrel character: a caramelly bourbon, vanilla, coconut, nuts, oak, and a noticeable booze singe. I can't realistically give a 5.0 to something with booze in the aroma, but I suspect this will fade with time. 
T: The barrel complements the aged Adam spectacularly. Vanilla, coconut, hazelnut, and oak blend seamlessly with toffee, chocolate, leather, smoke, and tobacco. Dark fruits are noted throughout (plum and fig), as well as a touch of oxidation that produces elements of soy and sherry. Again, my soft spot for Adam should be noted, but I am not giving this beer much of a pass. It seems like Adam was made to support bourbon barrel flavors. It bears them well. 
M: Oily, slick. Adam amped up to 11. The body's heft doesn't quite hide its booziness, but the flavors linger without leaving any unpleasant sensations. 
O: Very solid. It's a bit young, but I predict it will age phenomenally. I'm looking forward to tracking its progress in a year or two. In retrospect, I regret not asking for more of this. 1,626 charactersArbitrator, Nov 28, 2011

2011 batch opened at 55 degrees. Snifter.
A: The bottle opens with a much welcome sinister sibilance that signals carbonation. This is a good thing. The body is a brown so dark it borders on black with a finger of light brown foam that slowly dissipates.
S: The aroma is great initially, but it really opens up after 10 minutes. Coconut melds with plum and a light nuttiness, perhaps macadamia. Oak is strong and bourbon is pronounced. Caramelized sugar accompanies apple and toffee. Vanilla is pervasive. I get a trace of smoke, as well as tobacco, earth, and a little leather. The aroma is so many things at once. At times it reminds me of a fine port. Oxidation is pleasant and complimentary, imparting light soy notes.
T: Light alcohol warmth up front with a strong combination of wood and bourbon. Vanilla blends with coconut and a light leather note. Tobacco is evident, and I get notes of plum and fig with a dash of chocolate. Graceful oxidation is reminiscent of sherry with a little soy sauce. I get traces of ripe apple and tannins. Alcohol is present in the finish, but it's is not at all inappropriate for the beer's ABV. This is stunning.
M: Medium in body with upper moderate carbonation, which seems a little high for this beer but that's a very picky thing to complain about as it's easy to swirl out. There is a lot of alcohol warming on the palate, as well as stickiness.
Overall: This beer is quite an experience. It's among the best I've ever had. Highly recommended. 1,505 charactersHopHead84, Nov 27, 2011

Pour: The deepest, darkest brown with just a slight ring of dark tan head after it settles.
Nose: This smells absolutely stunning. You get the leather, peat smoke, tobacco and chocolate from Adam mixed with a luscious bourbon that draws you deep into its toasted coconut, luscious vanilla, and charred oak.
Taste: Even better than the nose. An amazingly well integrated bourbon gives you thick and chewy fudge, vanilla, toasted coconut, layers of toffee and charred oak, peat smoke, and dark fruit (plum and fig). Amazing. The sweet tobacco at the end is so luscious and invites you back for more.
Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy with a creamy finish.
Overall: This beer is pure decadence. Probably the greatest, best tasting beer I've ever enjoyed. So glad to have a case of this. A once yearly treat for my birthday.
Alan, you've made another masterpiece...like I'm surprised lol. 936 characterswaltersrj, Nov 25, 2011

A: Black color. Not pitch black but very close. One finger light tan head with amazing retention and lacing.
S: Big bourbon and oak. Dark fruits, brown sugar, leather, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and some roasted notes come through lightly. Oak and bourbon definitely dominate this complex beer. 
T: Very sweet caramel upfront with sweet milk chocolate. Brown sugar, dark fruit, oak, and roasted coffee in the middle. Bourbon, butterscotch and toffee in the finish. The oak and bourbon are very light compared to the nose. Very complex indeed. Alcohol is almost non existent. 
M: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky. Finishes slightly dry.
O: Amazing beer. Not the best ever but certainly complex and good. Scary drinkable for 12%. 818 charactersdoughanson78, Nov 24, 2011

A - Pours dark brown, nice tan-colored head, thin collar, wisps.
S - Very rich, big brown burnt sugars, caramel, toffee, smooth booze, nice oak. All very nice and decedent. The sweetness, booze, and oak are excellent here.
T - Burnt sugary sweetness, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, earthy tobacco, smooth bourbon booze. This beer is rich and the alcohol is really no where to be found. Perhaps a touch hot, but really, pretty darn smooth to me. 
M - Body is medium, nice light carbonation, sweet creamy rich finish.
O - While I thought the 2000 vintage had too much oak, the 2011 vintage is just spot-on outstanding. The booze is well-hidden, the oak is perfect, the the sweetness is top-notch. An awesome beer, to say the least. 951 charactersSean9689, Nov 24, 2011

A: Very dark brown and opaque like prune juice with a tight half finger of espresso like head that slowly recedes to a fuzzy thick glass ring. No lacing but who's expecting any? 5/5
S: Smoke, leather, and tobacco are all adjectives I've used with regular Adam. They're all here as well but more intense. Add the wood, and coconut comes to play as does dark fruit and strong brown liquor. 4/5
T: Sweet decadent fruity sugars, beautiful bourbon, rum notes, raisins, smoked meat, chocolate heavy on the cacao, heavy handed alcohol, and more of that wonderful tobacco. 4/5
M: The alcohol is a little aggressive at this point and my tongue has some tingling alcohol burn going on. Some time in the bottle (whenever it actually get's bottled) should help reduce that alcohol bite. Thick and appropriately carbonated with a cleaner finish then I expected for such a big beer. Not too sticky. 4.5
O: A truly wonderful beer. Just like the base Adam, it's one of a kind. Call me crazy, but I think I actually prefer the non-barrel aged base beer though. That could be due to (as I stated in the mouthfeel) the alcohol being too big and hot at the moment. I'd love to stash a few bottles of this away for a year or so and see if that helps it integrate better.

A: The beer poured a deep mahogany brown, approaching black. No light comes through the beer except for on the edges. It came with a small head, "soft" mocha in color. Little to no lacing on the glass. 
S: Wow, huge caramel notes combined with toffee and figs. Oak and bourbon notes come next with plenty of alcohol legs behind them. Also getting slight milk chocolate, nuts and coffee. One really good smelling beer. 
T: As many have noted before me, this beer is very rich and sweet. It really reminds me of a barrel aged Lagunitas Brown Shugga. It has a excellent pairing of caramel, toffee and dark fruits. Following those comes the bourbon, oak and alcohol. Very mellow and smooth. 
M: Thick, creamy and smooth. No alcohol heat. Low carbonation, but not flat. 
O: I am very impressed with this beer. After the let down known as Cherry Adam, I wasn't sure any barrel aged Adam was going to make the cut and I was wrong. This beer is exceptional. 1,038 charactersCaptainTripps, Oct 01, 2011

A: Deep, deep brown with a 1 finger mocha head. Pretty decent retention for a strong barrel-aged beer.
S: Really heady chocolate and coffee aromas. Lighter notes of bourbon and oak.
T: Rich chocolate, a little alcohol heat and a bit of wood in the finish. Surprisingly restrained for having spent 3 years in the barrels. As it get up to room temperature at the end of the glass, the alcohol gets a bit more upfront, but never overwhelming.
M: Rich and heavy, but not at all sticky or cloying; hits the perfect balance for a sipper. Light carbonation.

The aroma is nice, with toffee, dark fruits, bourbon, wood and some general sweetness.
Tastes pretty damn good too. The barrel characteristics are pronounced but not overpowering, with bourbon, wood, vanilla and a little bit of leather. Dark fruits like dates and figs are teamed with some alcohol warmth. The malt backbone is big, with toffee, some sweetness and maybe a slight, dry, cocoa presence. Once again, there is a little bit of alcohol warmth in the finish, but it is pleasant.

Appearance: Served in a Hair of the Dog tulip. Dark and mysterious, framed with mokah hues where the brew meets the glass. Thin outer ring of white creamy head.
Smell: Intense nose of Bourbon, oak, vanilla, marshelled on by dark fruits, plum, candied apricots
Taste: Astoundingly complex, more so than my vocabulary and beer knowledge can comprehend. Roasted malt, intense, unrelenting oak aged character; vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Followed by sweet caramalized and candied dark fruits. You have to drink it to realize what it is. My words cannont begin to expound upon it's brillance.

M - Very low carbonation, no heat, medium-full body, chewy, viscous, and moderately tannic.
D - Delicious stuff that has aged extremely well. I'm curious how the new batch compares, seeing as it was only aged for roughly half as long. In any case, this was a real treat. A sipper, with it's rich flavor and deceptive alcohol. 930 charactersMasterSki, Jul 31, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A tulip pour at Hair of the Dog's Tasting Room; $8.50 for 12 oz. (split to two glasses with my wife). 'Fred from the Wood' was still listed on the menu, but our server made sure we knew the Adam from the Wood was now on.
A batch of 2008 Adam, barrel-aged for 3+ years, or so I'm told.
A: Deep and dark, just as murky and chocolate-brown as 'regular' Adam. Short head of beige foam, tight and a little sudsy at the ringing edge. Slowly the head breaks, leaving small patches of film. No lace, some viscous legs trailing almost like they would with wine.
S: Phenomenal scent - a huge burst of sweet fermentables, fruity like raisins, figs and prunes. A 'sweet meat' savoriness, molasses and maple sugar glaze, teriyaki maybe? Fudgy whiffs, jam and leather. Oh, and 'barrel'- all full of vanilla and spice. Adam is a ridiculously complex beer; multiply that here. A '5' score barely does justice.
T: The Old Ale nuances are all here, amplified by bourbon and wood-toned subtleties. Toffee and brown sugar, lots of berries drenched in chocolate (I'm thinking 'chambord' as I sip). Warm vanilla, then definite prunes and earthy raisins (I've recently tried a couple of kvasses and noted some similarities to the fruity profile and deep breadiness...). Puffs of smoke and barrel-toasting interect well. A stunner, evolving with each taste.
M: Smoothness is wonderful; carbonation is still present and body holds to its medium-fullness, but all seems so much more even/creamy. Aged, dare I say, 'perfectly'. Booze is held well in check, but there's still a slight warming burn at the back that prohibits my '5'... but, man, is it close...
O: One of the best beers I've had in a long while - a 'WOW' that I was sad to have come to an end but so happy to have tried. I have been in love with the Adambier from Day 1; this just takes it up a notch or five. A rumored bottling in Fall 2011 should put this acclaimed ale into many more eager hands and bellies... the line begins forming now. 1,985 charactersmsubulldog25, Jun 10, 2011

i remember sharing some of the 2000 adam from the wood i had with the CT dudes back in the day.. that was 5-6 years old. it was totally smoky and developing port wine flavors.
at 3 years, this is definitely bourbon heavy.. in addition, they did not choose a particularly smoky adam to put in those barrels. and even after 3 years, its still pretty damn hoppy and bitter. i'm thinking the smoke is dwelling in there, but the beer needs another couple years to meld the heat and suppress some of the hops, vanilla & oak. as a bourbon barrel aged strong ale, this is a hands-down great beer. compared to the 2000, this is just good. this will be released in bottles this fall (guessing $15/12oz) and it will be imperative to purchase several to sit on. if i can recreate the magic of the 2000 batch with age, it will be worth every penny. 1,066 charactersgoodbyeohio, Jun 09, 2011

D- Its a big heavy beer, but it has so much flavor I couldn't stop drinking it. If I had another bottle I don't think i could let it sit very long and probably would opened it by now. What an amazing beer. I am usually not a fan of old ales, but this is one of the best. 880 charactersnkersten, Mar 20, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Magnum that was shared at the opening of the new Hair of the Dog Brewpub!... Poured opaque, brown with no head, except for a little bit of bubbles at the surface. Aroma had lots of bourbon, and brandy-like booze, heavy with alcohol and even notes of cocoa, and buttery malts. Not as smokey as regular Adam, it seemed to have lost that in either the barrel aging or the bottle aging. Little carbonation, hot with whiskey flavors, and notes of prunes, currants, savory meats, and a little bit of roast. Very fortified, like a fine port wine. 539 charactersboMD, Aug 14, 2010

A: The pour is a slightly muddled dark brown color with a few highlights of red.
S: The richness of the bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate is really impressive. A slight bit of alcohol heat, but it is quite smooth and pleasant.
T: A nice sweetness in the form of vanilla and chocolate. The wood is quite prominent and provides some nice tannins and even more vanilla. A bit of bourbon and warmth on the finish.
M: The body is full with a low, smooth carbonation and a nice warming feel on the tongue and all the way down.
D: A fairly high ABV beer, but very smooth and easy to drink. The bourbon presence might be a bit for some, but I found this on quite enjoyable. 699 characterswomencantsail, Jun 04, 2010

This beer was the absolute standout, despite the entire barrel aged collection that Sam had. I had parabola after this and it tasted like old diner coffee. That is how good adam from the wood is. 
2008 vintage. Sweet, bourbony, delicious beer with (as my good friend stated) the after taste of tollhouse cookie dough.
I had two
Wish it was four...
Get to stuffed sandwich stat. 422 charactersgregmoscetti, Jun 04, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I've had Adam before, but from the woods, this was beautiful. There wasn't very much head and it did fall fast.The flavors settled really well and stayed in your mouth. Thick cream but smooth finish. Definately a winter warmer but there was no part of this beer that i didnt enjoy. All the way through it was unbelievable. SO TASTY ! I sank into the moment with the first mouthful. mmm 385 charactersbangerang, Dec 23, 2009
4.02/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.512oz bottle. Pours a dark brown/red color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very alcoholic - bourbon, oak, coffee-roast malts, some dark fruit. The flavor has a lot of caramel and bourbon/oak flavors, but even more alcohol flavor. Fairly sweet finish. Also has some earthy bitterness that sticks around on the tongue. The mouthfeel is moderate, but the alcohol and bitterness stick around on the palate making this one a little less drinkable for me. Very interesting beer. 530 charactersclvand0, Jul 20, 2009

Caramel and liqueur in the smell - quite similar profile to Dave. 
Almost flat, but nice and smooth on the tongue. Caramel, molasses and brown sugar play against some vinous bourbon characteristics.
Very well done and very tasty. 316 charactersrallison, Apr 01, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412 ounce bottle brought to the SeaO'Floydster tasting by cquiroga, thank you very much for bringing this Chris, it was great to be able to try this on the same night as Dave and compare their similarities and differences, reviewed from notes, poured into my Rader snifter
A-Dark brown with some mahogany, thin 1/4 inch beige creamy head, goes away pretty quiclky, nice legs but no lacing
S-Oak, booze, roasted malts, vanilla, milk chocolate, bourbon, dark fruits, brown sugar, and molasses
T-Starts off with a nice boozy flavor, chewy and roasty malts in the middle, great whiskey-like finish, lots of vanilla and oak later on, more sweet and boozy than the standard Adam, did not have the toastiness either, still nicely balanced and pleasantly warming
M-Sweet, roasty, warm, and dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, very little carbonation, taste lingered a long time and was nice
D-Could have drank this bottle quite easily, only concern with drinkability is that it does not hide the alcohol very well, still very smooth and inviting
I knew I would like this and who would not enjoy Adam that spent over seven years in a barrel, another great brew from Hair of the Dog, cannot wait to try the cherry version now and compare these, I hope this is released again in the future, I want more, recommended 1,299 charactersFloydster, Apr 01, 2009
4.69/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4HUGE bottle at Mikey's going away party, courtesy of Jim. I drank a ton of this beer, as there were only three of us that seemed to want second pourings.
Murky, swampy brown, with no head at all. Honestly, it didn't look particularly appetizing, but to convey the overall awesomeness of this brewski, I have to give it a higher score.Pretty light aroma, consisting mostly of port-like dark malt, tons of sherry steeped fruit, vanilla, and oak-soaked creamines. Smells like it's been waiting for me to sip, and waiting patiently. The flavor follows suit, with malt engraved into wooden slats, absolutely soaked in vanilla-like oak. No "barrel" feel, just straight oak and all its creamy wildness. Powerful roastiness. Minimal, if any, carbonation. The barest sparkle on the swallow. Pretty much flat. If you like cask ale, this is great. If not, this might not qualify as beer to you. Huge, thick body with a coating, lasting mouthfeel. The juicy malt flavor lingers forever. Hops leave trace residue of earthiness, but contribute no bitterness at this point. Finishes molasses-like and hugely biting in its sweetness. Very sweet, so much so that it's reserved for true beer aficionados only. Many people at the gathering could hardly manage three or four ounces of the stiff. More for the rest of us!!! I certainly indulged, and enjoyed every sip. Adam should always be kept in the wood. Imprison that evil bastard. 1,416 charactersUnionMade, Sep 01, 2006
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A most interesting aroma of peat, alcohol, scotch, port. Appearance was deceiving because of soap like bubbles, no head. Taste barley, bourbon, salty, barrel wood. Thanks to Woolfs at Doug Shoemaker tasting. The taste, the alcohol - must be sipped. Speed bumps slowing us all down. 281 charactersSammy, Sep 12, 2005
4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to a very kind BA for pulling this out at the Dark Lord release. Poured a thick, extremely dark brown, nearly black with a miniscule tan head. Amazing nose of deep vinous aromas, plums, grapes, dark fruits all over the place along with a massive oaky, woody cellar aroma. One I could sit and smell all day.
Big fruity malty molasses flavor that has a strong woody undercurrent. Each sip is an experience in itself. Bourbon sweetness with vinous notes. Damn good stuff.
Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with a syrupy, nearly liqour like consistency. Just a damn fine brew that I dunno if I'll ever be able to try again. Highly recommended and I seriously hope I get the chance to run across this again someday. 718 charactersorbitalr0x, May 05, 2005
