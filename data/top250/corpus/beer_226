A: Very little head sits atop a dirty yellow gold body.
S: lots of pineapple and yeast, a little honeydew and sweetness.
T: Lots of pineapple, a little floral, and herbal hops 
M: Medium to fuller body with decent carbonation.
O: It's too dirty tastes like an unfiltered Homebrew. The beer has no structure and too much of a yeastdriven taste. If I would hide the label on this someone would tell me I was trying to feed them an unfinished beer. Because it is Trillium people fall all over themselves for it. 569 charactersSomethingClever, Jun 09, 2017

Pours a hazy yellow with a w creamy white head.  Smells super citrus, like sticking your head in the tropical fruit isle.  Taste bring forth a citrus explosion akin to drinking orange juice that someone squeezed from the rind.  I say that because there is no sweetness, and also an accompanying bitterness on the palate after the beer goes down.  Awesome stuff. 497 charactersgibgink, Mar 13, 2017

Look- A very hazy orange to yellow and thick. Around 1 finger of foamy head that dissipated quickly. Nice lacing down the glass but rather thin. 
Smell- A huge aroma of citrus. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple and some others. A subtle touch of hop and pine in there too. 
Taste- A massive hop blast. The grapefruit and orange citrus was dominant. The finish was fantastic with the hog and pine notes really shining. Finished dry and the taste was more subtle. 
Feel- Crisp and next to no carbonation. It was super drinkable. 
Overall- A fantastic double IPA. Such a super juicy flavor with a fantastic hop kick. Not really like anything I have tried before. Definitely get some of this if you get the chance. 770 charactersKdouble, Mar 01, 2017

S: Pineapple, potpourri of dried flowers, lemon, tangerine, and light mango.  
T: Follows the nose, though a little more citrus forward.  The body gives this a citrus creamsicle aspect.  Finishes fairly dry with minimal bitterness and a bit of yeasty astringency. 
M: Medium body, medium-light carbonation, with creamy texture.

The aroma is green and fruity, citrus, grass, pineapple, green tea, and honeydew.
Taste is big citrus up front, honey dew and green tea, a little peach and pineapple, grapefruit bitterness. Reminiscent of earl grey tea.
Medium body, crisp, and nice biting carbonation. Drying.
Overall I like this more than the first time I tried it, when the fruity notes were lost on me and it was very green and vegative, but this time I'm getting both the fruits and the vegetative flavors leading to a nice earl grey like flavor.

A: Pours a super hazy, pale, yellowish orange in color with a 1/2 inch, foamy, white head with minimal retention. Thin, white lacing throughout.
S: Aromas of tropical fruit and citrus consisting of pineapple, melons, guava, papaya, orange, and grapefruit. Milder notes of earthy, piney, and floral hops.
T: Huge juicy hop bomb! Starts off with notes of grapefruit, orange, and citrus rinds followed by pineapple, melons, guava, and mango. Finishes with a huge palate smacking, lingering, piney, resinous hop bitterness.
F: Medium bodied, smooth, juicy, and crisp with moderate carbonation. Somewhat dry on the finish.
O: Overall, this is an awesome DIPA. Super hazy and juicy. Juicy hop bomb with great balance between both flavor profiles. Excellently crafted. The DDH version adds a whole new element and elevates this to an entirely new level. So happy I got to try this one and would definitely seek it out again! 972 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 24, 2017

A: Tangerine gold with some orange at the core and honey around the edges - even more turbid and hazy than the average Trillium hop soup - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a few wisps, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: Juicy, obviously - lots of citrus, with some orange and grapefruit juice, zest - herbal, leafy, a touch grassy, dank - spicy - some sharp lime - earthy - damp pineapple - pear and apple - some light sweetness, pale malts
T: Sharp, bright citrus - orange and a lot of grapefruit - citrus juice, zest, pith - bright lime, maybe a touch of lemon - herbal with some grassy notes, spicy green hops, a bit woodsy -  not getting as much pineapple as in the aroma - some underripe peach, melon rind - moderately herbal - above-average bitterness - some light bread, pale malts at the base
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth, sharper finish than most of the DDH Trillium beers
O: 2 Scales 2 Furious
Double dry hopped Trillium beers are consistently interesting, at the very least. Not all are better than their "single dry hopped" counterparts. Maybe I am not in love with DDH Scaled because I don't seem to love big amounts of El Dorado  in Trillium. Still, it's definitely worth a try. 1,242 charactersangrybabboon, Feb 23, 2017

4.55/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: hazed out light orange juice with foamy white bubbles head, sticky lacing.  Its bright and milky
S: sweet aromas of fresh pineapple, citrus rind, some grass and a light bitterness that is overshadowed with sweet scents
T:  it starts off sweet, tropical mango and pineapple with light pine and earthy grass to finish.  Orangemint hints as well. Its extremely dry being double dry hopped and it has that dry hop twang at the end that will make your throat tickle a little as well. 
M: medium to light bodied and light carbonation
O: overall a very well put together new england ipa.  I havent really had eldorado hops in many beers that i can recall but as far as that goes this is by far the most memorable of them that i have had.  Refeshing, highly drinkable with a dry finish.  I enjoyed melcher street slightly more but you cannot complain with this great beer 870 charactersalpinebryant, Feb 17, 2017

4.53/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5On draft at Trillium (Canton).
Had this in a 4-way comparison at the brewery (Headroom, DDH Congress St and Galaxy DH Fort Point were the other 3).  And although quite a solid beer, I would rank it behind the other 3.  Tropical fruit notes with some earthy flavors as well, similar to that of Galaxy DH Fort Point.  But there was another element to the taste which I can't describe and it didn't help it in my opinion.  The feel was like all other Trillium: super smooth and easy to drink. 490 characterseifster82, Sep 28, 2016

One of the better single IPAs I've had and great representation of NE IPA style. 295 charactersdrew42e, Sep 28, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L - classic Trillium. A solid block of pale OJ haze. 
S - the nose on this one is insane. Getting wafts from the moment I cracked the can until I actually put it up to my face. Incredibly bright and grassy. So many hops. Orange, pineapple, and melon. It's not just the smell, it's the WAY it smells. Penetrating and expansive, aroma fills the air. 
T - not as bitter and hoppy as I was preparing myself for! Loads more smooth and creamy. Has a sweetness to it along with doughy grains. Pineapple and nectarine. Juicy nectar with earthy undertones thanks to the dry hopping. Really like Trillium DDH brews because you can literally taste the hops. The raw, primal grassiness of eating straight hop pellets. Well-balanced which includes the extra hops. Starts strong and finishes strong with robust flavor throughout. 
F - viscous and creamy. Only 7% you say? Drinks like a double. 
O - just a well-done beer. Amazing how dry hopping can really take over the flavor and ingrain itself so deeply into the base beer. Usually dry hopping is a gimmick and tacks on some grassiness separate from the rest of the beer, but this feels natural. 1,138 charactersagreenman19, Sep 25, 2016

A - Very-cloudy golden-orange with a 1-finger white head that fades quickly leaving moderate lace. 
S - Fresh pineapple, papaya, navel orange, pine needles, more floral than dank.
T - More hop forward than the smell indicates.  Nice burst of gooey hob bud flavor and bitterness before the big fruit flavors kick in with pineapple, orange, apricot and watermelon.  There's a light biscuit flavor with just a hint of caramel.  Big pine flavor too with some earthy spice and woody accents.  Finishes with a sharp bitterness with grass, tea and pepper accents.  
M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation.  Resinous, prickly and finishes dry. 
O - A flavor bomb.  Only knock for me is I'd have liked a bit more fruit sweetness in the finish to counter the lingering bitterness.  I prefer their normal Scaled for this reason. 921 charactersTucquan, Sep 24, 2016

Pours a hazy golden orange, with no head. Looks like juice. 
Smells of grapefruit, orange and mango, with a slight hop kick.
Taste of grapefruit and orange, tad bit of mango and a slight hoppy kick. Pretty dry. Taste like it's lacking something. Solid beer nonetheless 
Fairly light bodied with decent carbonation, orange and fruity dry finish. 
Good brew, but taste like it's lacking in a few departments. Would definetly drink again, but would prefer a few others first. 517 charactersDrinkThemAll, Sep 21, 2016

Medium body and carbonation. Another great IPA from Trillium. 343 charactersCiocanelu, Aug 23, 2016

Smell is mango, papaya, passion fruit, guava, and grapefruit rind. 
Taste follows loads of tropical fruit from start to finish, wow really a tasty IPA, some pine and grapefruit in the slightly bitter finish. 
Mouthfeel is a little bigger than medium, moderate carbonation, not dry at all, and as drinkable as it gets. 
Overall another non filtered and amazing IPA, thanks @jzeilinger for this juicy treat! 595 charactersSawDog505, Aug 21, 2016

S - Biscuity, pineapple, citrus.
T - Pineapple and grapefruit rind with a balanced spicy, peppery fruit rind finish.
M - Medium body and chewy. 
O - Bursting with flavor.  The East Coast continues to differentiate themselves from the West Coast by brewing hazier, "chewier" IPA's and to each their own.  It's definitely a flavorful beer but if every brewer decided to brew their IPA's this way, I'd totally shoot myself. 515 charactersjzeilinger, Aug 12, 2016

Hazy sunset yellow. White head. Seriously, so much haze.
Flavor doesn't match the nose. It's good, but doesn't have that pop. Some citrus and earthy bitterness. Lemon peel. Some herbal/honey notes.
Solid, but I wish the flavor matched the nose. 298 charactersmothman, Aug 09, 2016

Bottled on: Aug-2-2016
A:	
Pours a hazy almost mountain-dew-like color that is turbid as could be with a finger or so of soapy head that evaporates to nothing immediately.  No retention; no lacing.  (3.5)	
S:	
Candied citrus with a whiff of ethanol; lemon drops, mandarins, some pine sap, vodka.  (4.25)	
T:	
Dry, slightly resinous hop bitterness that kind of sticks to the palate.  There is a little citrus sweetness but nothing like the nose.  (4)	
M:	
Medium body, active carbonation, almost-fluffy feel in the mouth, lingering "resinousness".  (4)	
O:	
Decent dry-hopped IPA from Trillium.  
This is definitely not my favorite I have had from them, but it is far from being a mess.  For starters it is the first I've had where I would agree with people who say that they (turbid IPAs) are not visually appealing.  The nose is delicious. Like a yellow dum-dum dipped in everclear.  The boozy part I could do without, but otherwise the aroma is very appealing.  The flavor is dominated by a flat, even bitterness that doesn't seem too much like the aroma.  It is pretty drinkable and pretty tasty all told, though.  Would have again, though if I had the option I'd choose one of their other beers (not to sound entitled or anything).  Still, a kickass IPA, to be sure. (4.25) 1,299 charactersTheDoctor, Aug 07, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bright hazy yellow-orange with a thin, white fizzy bubbly head.
Super bright tangerine on the nose paired with sweet apricot and bubblegum. This is just loaded with absolutely vibrant hops, with some spiced orange.
This beer has so much fresh orange flavor, I think it may be the most prominent of any other hopped brew I've ever experienced. All of this is attributed to the really fresh, bright hops, and not for a single instant does it seem like there is anything artificial. It's just big time, juicy, sweet tangerine, with some balancing but light green pine and some distant herbal dankness as it warms. Soft light oat or wheat develops as well, with some lemon.
Overall this is a very bright, light, tangy and tingly brew with nothing heavy, too bitter or overpowering at all. DDH Scaled is just so damn drinkable!
Addendum: I just recently had a 4 month old bottle of this that I kept around before they transitioned to cans, and it's absolutely crazy. I've never had a "stale" IPA that tasted and smelled this fucking good. It smells like a very dry, herbal-esque, essential oil, perfumey bouquet. I've never had an old IPA that didn't turn into a complete pine forest or grain showcase. Taste became apple, pear, honeysuckle--just a super floral meadow of birds and bees. Outstanding! 1,299 charactersSabtos, Jul 12, 2016

Taste comes across a little dry, which works well with the grapefruit, pineapple and pith. It also sets it apart a bit in what is becoming a very crowded NE style IPA field.  Slight hop bitterness on the back end which seems appropriate for this beer. Heavy carbonation for an IPA, but it works in this case. Very refreshing. A great summer beer. 426 characters11-52_4hops, Jun 24, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a snifter, the beer is an opaque, honey-yellow coloring, with a steady flow of carbonation feeding a clingy, foamy, white head. Aromas overflow as you pour, with notes of bright citrus, heavy on grapefruit, lemon, and orange rind, blended perfectly with candy-like tropical fruit aromas of kiwi, passion fruit, mango, and papaya. Very juicy, with only trace hints of bitterness. This literally smells like liquid candy. Flavors are very juicy, heavy on the citrus forward, with a bold splash of orange juice hitting the taste buds first. Solid mango and passion fruit blend follows, with only subtle bitterness peaking around the fringe here and there. Very juicy, low bitterness IPA. Delicious. The body is smooth and chewy, but never overbearing. The drinkability is through the roof on this beer. The aftertaste is all juice...like a liquid fruit cocktail, with a citrus base, of course. Slick, smooth, light finish, with a solid citrus linger. Great beer! 985 charactersGarthDanielson, Jun 23, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -10.8%look: 2.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 4750ml brown bottle, purchased at Gordon's Wines in Boston, MA. This sample was in my beer fridge for an extra 10 days and much of the sediment had settled to the bottom. 
Pours a nearly completely hazed out dull orange hue. Lacing holds for the duration. Fresh citrus zest, lime leaf, mint, pine cones, & green tea in the nose. Lots of dry-hop character on the palate, blonde tobacco, citrus zest and rind, herbal tea, melon rind, and fresh grass. Slightly smooth, warming expressive esters, nutty yeast, and a bready malt within. Bitterness is there, also a slightly mealy tone. While I'm not a fan of a look (extra haze) and the mealy tone the hop and alcohol flavors do seem to do very well here. With the mouth feel the way it is and the carbonation level being a bit low nothing really pops here but the aroma and flavor are on point. 840 charactersJason, Jun 18, 2016

Pours a nice creamy fluffy foamy 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, nice frothy lacing, typical super murky milk-shake honey blond tan color.
Nose is as expected, loads of citrus, big juicy orange juice, pineapple, some grapefruit pith, no real rind bitterness, a touch of tropical like almost mango, nice creamy base malt, with juicy orange flesh and tangerine, a little orange sugar candy. 
Taste brings more of hte same, so much orange flesh out front, like biting into an orange with plenty of pith in there, a juicy tangerine, even some lemon, just explosions of citrus, with some nice tropical notes, a big pineapple, touch resin and some mango skin, with fair bitterness. Nice creamy malt base, a little juicy malt taste, a little touch of booze warmth. Hops start to turn grassy floral and a bit earthy later, actually an interesting earthy mossy flavor in there from out of nowhere late, drier finish, a little sticky, big citrus orange juice and pith lingering.
Mouth is med to fuller bod a bit chewy, nice creamy, popping bubble zesty carbonation, just about no booze.
Overall an awesome IPA, maybe not quite as good as I was reaching for, but I was reaching really high since I had such an incredible IPA yesterday, this was def way up there though, a delicious IPA I will sip and enjoy all the way to the end, and then wish I had more. 1,462 charactersjlindros, Jun 08, 2016

4.04/5  rDev -9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml bottle, stamped with what appears to be 05.24.16, poured into a Trillium snifter glass.
The beer pours a ridiculously murky orange color, hues of tan and gold, intensely cloudy and turbid with a firm, white head, good retention and plenty of spotted lace. The aroma is really intense with sweet citrus juice, a bit of tangy lime as well with some wildflower, honey, strong pale wheat and graininess that lingers nicely, tame bitterness, but really just a ton of juiciness. The flavors echo the nose well, loads of juicy citrus, orange and tangerine at first with bitter grapefruit peel, some pine and earthiness creeps out behind it before a bit of a floral note and some strong wheat flavors take over offering some sweetness to counteract the bitter hoppiness, while the lingering flavor is tart lime juice. The mouthfeel is good, coating, full bodied with gentle carbonation and a very smooth texture and a dry kick at the finish that isn't too abrasive. 
Verdict: A nice IPA from Trillium, not my favorite combination of hops, but plenty of stuff to like here. Not the most complex IPA and it feels a bit muddled rather than layered, but this was a very nice beer for a warm June evening. 1,200 characterskevanb, Jun 07, 2016

Along the same lines of many Trillium Pale/IPAs - cloudy, aromatic, juicy, delicious. What makes this one different from say, Fort Point or Congress Street? Damned if I know. More hops = more expensive ($23/64oz). Someday I'll do a side-by-side and see if I can detect the nuance. But for now I'll enjoy another superb Trillium offering!
EDIT: Same day edit- that's a first! Anyways, just tasting a pint of Congress Stree - it has some very different characteristics and taste from the Scaled.  I suppose all great breweries have their trademark taste, whether it's from yeast or grain or hops. 699 charactershudsonvalleyslim, May 28, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25750ml bottle. Served in a snifter glass.
Pours a hazy, darker orange-copper body, one finger white head, great retention, lots of lacing. Looks great. Smells of dank citrus and earth, not so much tropical fruit.  A bit of grainy cereal sweetness, but as par for the course, it's very heavy on the aromatic hoppy aromas. Flavour is a nice refreshing dank earth, bitter grapefruit and a touch of melon. Grainy cereal. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft, creamy and perfectly carbonated. Typical of Trillium- a soft, highly aromatic pale ale that is guzzleable. 557 charactersStevedore, Feb 22, 2016

The aroma hits of orange zest, yellow grapefruit, pineapple, medium ripe mango, nectarine, and a "wet earthiness" that is well described by the website. Green herb, dank, doughy malt.
The flavor hits of a chemically dank flavor up front that turns on the palate as bitter pithy orange peel, lime concentrate take over, with hints of pineapple, a light bready malt offers a medium chewy mouthfeel, onto more green herbaceous and earthy lingering aftertaste. 511 charactersdar482, Feb 20, 2016

The nose is a bit muted compared to their other offerings, but the taste is just unique with the El Dorado hops taking the forefront and Citra and Columbus helping out on the back end. The mouthfeel is just killer, billowy, thick and rich. Overall, another killer Trillium brew. 334 charactersKramerbarthomer, Feb 13, 2016

Pours a murky, bright orange color with one inch of off white head and moderate carbonation evident. Citrus hops, oranges, grapefruit, juicy topical fruits. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Super easy to drink.
Overall a great beer; wish I had bought more of these. 378 charactersmdfb79, Feb 11, 2016

This one pours a turbid, soft-looking and bright orange, with a 1.5 inch head, and a lot of lacing.
Smells likejust insanely juicy and sweet tangerine and orange marmalade, with some very slight grassiness and grapefruit.
Like much of Trillium's lineup, this is just straight up hoppy fruit juice. There's so much candied tangerine, orange rind, slight grassiness, grapefruit and overripe peach. It's unbelievably juicy, as is to be expected.
This is medium bodied, fairly thick but not quite as thick as Trillium's other mega IPAs, which is fine. It's got a really juicy mouthfeel.
Another banger from Trillium. 677 charactersGreesyFizeek, Feb 10, 2016

S: Floral hop-forward nose replete with a hearty dankness and big citrus notes
T: A rush of bitter hoppiness is then greeted by mangoes, pineapple, grapefruit, and tangerines; the El Dorado hops are pronounced and provide a lingering bite of pepper and dryness
F: Soft mouthfeel is contrasted by heavy carbonation somewhat in contrast with other Trillium beers I've tried
O: This is another excellent hoppy offering from Trillium, who just can't seem to miss lately. The El Dorado dry hop adds a crisp dryness that counterbalances the sweetness of the fruit and citrus in a manner reminiscent of an Other Half IPA. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and it stands on its own among Trillium's varied offerings with a unique flavor profile that incorporates many of the brewery's signature touches. 882 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 04, 2016

Medium bodied with a pronounced bitterness that is still remains somewhat restrained letting the hop flavors shine.

01/19/16
Served in a pint glass
The beer poured a turbid, dull orangey-amber color. This looked exactly like orange juice. A fluffy, frothy, bright white, two finger tall crown topped the body. The head slowly faded to a lasting cap of foam. A few large, odd shaped patches of lacing stuck along the glass.
Lots of interesting stuff happening in the aroma. Weed-like notes dominated initially. The beer smelled almost like straight fresh bud. As the beer sat, citrus notes also became quite apparent. Lots of lime juice. Crisp and zesty. Orange peel also came through strong. There was a generic tutti fruity quality as well. Mango appeared as the beer warmed. The tropical fruit notes continued to intensify. Some peach came forth as well.
The flavor profile was also impressive and very similar to the nose. Citrus notes dominated. Lots of fresh orange juice, orange peel, tangerine and zesty lime. A bit margarita-like. Tropical fruits were rather apparent. Mango was most noticeable. Bit of pineapple. Some sweetened white grapefruit appeared on the back end. Orange rind came through in the finish. Hint of pithy bitterness. All in all, really juicy and immensely drinkable.
The mouthfeel was classic Trillium but perhaps a touch lighter than anticipated given the style. Super soft and plush on the palate. Creamy, slick and smooth. The liquid contained a fine, subtle effervescence.
Double Dry Hopped Scaled is a flavorful and supremely crushable IPA, but it is definitely a few notches below Trillium's best work. The strong lime notes and citrusy tanginess set this one apart from most of their other hoppy offerings. 1,715 charactersDamian, Feb 01, 2016

Pours this hazy, completely opaque pineapple juice/orange juice looking color. 
Aroma is an explosion of pineapple juice followed by sweet orange and tangerine. Mango, peach, apricot, bittersweet grapefruit just tons and tons of overly juicy tropical and citrus notes!
Flavor is also a crazy amount of fresh squeezed pineapple juice, orange juice, tangerine, mango and grapefruit followed by an earthy dank note. Complete and utter juice bomb with a nice dank finish. 
Medium bodied with a super creamy mouthfeel and a nice dry finish. Not overly bitter, but provides enough bitterness and dryness to balance those crazy juicy fruit notes. 
A new favorite for sure! Reminds me a lot of what Hoof Hearted is doing in Ohio. Awesome beer! 786 charactersJohnnyMc, Jan 29, 2016

Literally pours like its a glass of pineapple juice with a splash of orange. Completely turbid looking. 
Decent lacing as the glass empties. 
The smell is what really gets me ! The second I cracked the cap, Bamm ! Pineapples for days, with a touch of orange. 
Taste is very close to the smell for me, lots of citrus. Pineapple, bit of orange and maybe a hint of lime ?  Extreme juiciness here, these folks got it going on. I concur with most other reviewers here about all aspects of his brew. It's a supreme NE IPA. 
The feel is incredibly smooth, I didn't notice much bitterness here, which I like at times. Creamy feel with medium carbonation. As you close your mouth to swallow, there is just this smooth easy feeling without a ton of dry bite, which I really like. 
Overall, a total fruity fantastical juice bomb ! Trillium is crushing it and I apload their efforts. 
Seek them out at all costs. Cheers ! 1,020 charactersSteve_Tkachuk, Jan 26, 2016

Pours a super hazy, orange-juice-like body with a frothy white two finger head that reduces slowly to leave pretty heavy lacing. Really nice looking. One of the most cloudy beers I've ever seen. 
Aromas are apparent the second you open the bottle, huge citrus and sharp, potent, crisp tropical fruits, oranges, lime, anise, grapefruit, pineapple juice, damn this smells amazing! Perfect. Definitely going to be a fruit bomb. 
Taste follows the nose, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, vivid fruits followed by a slightly peppery, floral hop zing with a touch of bitterness that lingers for half a minute. Superb balance. Medium low carbonation with a medium -light body (I don't want to say watery, but a little dilute, but if the flavor matched the nose this beer would have been perfect). 
Great beer, just straight hop juice. So raw, balanced, and tropical. Another killer from Trillium 1,036 charactersgcamparone, Jan 25, 2016

A: Unbelievably cloudy orange pour. Completely opaque. Doesn't look far from drinking a lightened orange juice. Small fizzy white head that sticks around decently well enough. Doesn't seem to stick to the glass at all though.
S: Oh yeah. Super juicy. Pineapple, oranges, limes and hints of grapefruit. Hints of herbal and spicy hops but it's pretty much all juice all the time otherwise. 
T: More of the same. It's not intensely bitter especially given the freshness and the abundance of hops. But boy do those tropical fruits shine. Definite lime in there and in spades. Don't taste that too often so it really stood out. Pineapple, grapefruit, citrousy flavors in general. Turns into more of a spicy, herbal, almost garlicky flavor in the finish for a bit. Long lingering drying hop bomb of an aftertaste.
M: Medium bodied, soft and smooth.
O: Hell of a nice IPA. Soft mouthfeel reminds me of a HF or TH IPA. It's bitter but the bitterness doesn't stand out - the hops do. Great kaleidoscope of flavors. 1,045 charactersDope, Jan 24, 2016
4.23/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.532oz growler poured into a 13oz tulip, filled on 1/21/16, reviewed same day.
A — Appearance: Pours a murky yellowish color. If you were to mix pineapple and orange juice that’s what this looks like (and smells like). Very thin head with some nice lacing starting right from the get go. I should say that these Northeast beers look different than any other. They are turbid and opaque and that is desired. This looks like a glass of pineapple/orange juice.
S — Smell: The smell is lime and citrus right off the bat. Lemon zest, some citrus peel, all the good smells in a typical Trillium juice bomb. 
T — Taste: Wow. This is an absolute juice bomb. If you are not yet familiar with that term, it’s becoming quite common to describe the new breeds of Northeast APA/IPA’s, huge tropical fruit and citrus with a medium/light malt backbone. There’s a citrusy lime thing that pervades the taste and the finish is mildly bitter. No alcohol presence which at 7%, can be dangerous. Leaves me wanting more and more. 
M — Mouth feel: This beer coats the tongue then dances around before vanishing. It’s a soft mouth feel to be sure. It has a bitterness that remains for a while and slowly dissipates. Not overpowering but it lets you know it’s here. Finish is dry and clean. 
O — Overall: This is another absolute juice bomb from Trillium. This is how the Northeast breweries are differentiating themselves from West coast style hoppy beers. Tropical, citrus and hops with a nice balanced malt presence.  It leaves me wanting more and more. This beer is awesome and if you happen to be lucky enough to get some, I am sure you will agree. 1,652 charactersJRakAttack, Jan 23, 2016

Retention is also solid. Fantastic smell that doesn't weaken. This one really brings the fresh pine on top of the citrus. Mostly pineapple and tangerine. Taste echoes the smell. A bitter pine leads an intense lime and pineapple. Some fruit rind and spot of earthy dank as well. Much dryer than their typical beer. A touch thinner and has a resiny stick. I really like this one. In line with their juice bombs, but it brings the bitter. 532 charactersHootie159, Jan 22, 2016

Aroma is very heavy on the tropical fruits; mostly mango, some pineapple, and citrus and soft malts in the background. Taste is very, very juicy. Like the aroma its mostly tropical fruits and very heavy on the mango and leans towards sweet rather then bitter. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall a good beer, it's not without its flaws (dare I say too juicy?) but well done and an improvement on the original. 524 charactersmnj21655, Jan 21, 2016

The aroma is very tropical and citrusy. I get plenty of mango, pineapple, honeydew melon, and orange rind. There are also some subtle grassy notes and a faint hint of sweet, doughy malt. 
The taste is a lot more bitter and piney than the nose, with notes of lime, grass, and grapefruit. I also get some orange and a touch of grain from the malt. 
The mouth is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy, yet extremely dry on the finish. 
Overall, another great IPA from Trillium. The flavors are a bit disappointing given how blown away I was by the aroma, but it's still very well done, and extremely well balanced. 796 charactersScaryEd, Jan 20, 2016
