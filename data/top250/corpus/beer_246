Look - Hazy bright gold with a creamy white head and nice lacing...hazy IPA for sure
Smell - Tropical nose with hints of pine, pineapple, orange, tangerines, and some sweet malts....dank too
Taste- Tropical juice, a little sweet, follows the nose 
Feel - Soft, creamy, a little heavy but drinkable and a hint of booze
Overall - much more of the style I expected on this one over my first Grimm offering and it lives up to the hype.  Would love this ultra fresh.  May be comparable to "Haze" that way. 531 charactersrabbott2, Mar 14, 2017

Smell is amazing guava, papaya, passion fruit, tangerine, mango, and some piney grapefruit rind. 
Taste follows juicy as hell guava, papaya, passion fruit, mango, tangerine, and a little grapefruit. 
Mouthfeel is a big medium, mild carbonation but a little stick from all the wonderful fresh hops, not dry, and excellent drinkability.

4.61/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (JK stemware, just the ideal glass if you ask me). This has a canning date of February 7, 2017 printed in black ink on the underside of the can (“CANNED ON 02/07/17 12:15:16”), making this can two weeks old to the day at the time of consumption.  It’s been refrigerated for over 24 hours, and rolled around gently (as per instructions on the can) prior to pouring and drinking. 
Appearance (4.5): This pours out about two and a half full fingers of fluffy, custard-colored foam capping a dense, foggy body that’s a deep orange-tan. The head dies down at a fairly average pace, leaving a think, unbroken, clumpy collar of lacing all around the glass and a rocky surface on top of the body. 
Smell (4.75): A big, juicy bouquet of fruit aromas leap out of the can, leading with a nice mixture of passionfruit, sweet pineapple, overripe watermelon flesh, slightly musky papaya, bright limeade, and gooseberry. I really dig this, a whole goddamn lot. It’s got strongly grassy undertones and a nice, pale malt body that leaves the impression of warm, rustic bread with honey drizzled on top. The intersection of passionfruit funk, tart gooseberry, and grassy tones really comes out more as it warms. 
Taste (4.5): Ohh, fuck yes. It leads with juicy passionfruit and bitter grassiness, underscored by mellow papaya and melon tones that blend with the smooth, bready malt body. Meanwhile, a lime zest bitterness takes hold and unravels into an expanding pithy-to-resinous bitterness that carries into the finish. At the back end of the palate, that bitterness lightens up to a bright limeade-like citrusy note that gently eases up and resolves into a nice, light, but lingering grassy flavor. The aforementioned resinous flavor masks (or quietly betrays) any alcohol heat here, but overall it’s pretty smooth in that regard. The mixture of brassy lime zest and underlying melon/papaya smoothness can come off similar to a sweet, sectioned citrus fruit like caracara oranges. Man, is this good. The malt shows a little more toward the back end of the palate, giving the impression of rustic white bread like a good boule or pain de campagne, but it melds so readily with the sweeter side of the hop profile. This shit is seriously my jam. 
Mouthfeel (5.0): Grimm absolutely nailed it, here. The carbonation sweeps in with a rich, but not too thick volume of very fine-grained, just slightly tingly foam reaching all corners. It comes over the somewhat thicker than medium-weight body (but not “full” or “heavy,” at all), which feels creamy and smooth, in spite of the resinous, slightly boozy, drying hop oils. They lend a somewhat acidic, citrusy feel that manages to dry up that smooth, rich body to just the perfect degree, begging for the next sip without parching. It really encourages you to drink it way faster than you should, and it’s easy to forget that it’s 8% ABV. 
Overall (4.5): This outstanding. Flavor-wise, it trends more toward Magnetic Compass and away from Lumen, in my opinion, and I personally prefer the character of NZ/Oz hop varieties in heavy late- or post-boil additions and dry-hopping. But the fruitiness of the American hops really rounds it out a bit, making it more of a crown pleaser in my mind, and the hazy, juicy approach really knocks it out of the park. The body, too, is so smooth and creamy and still so freaking drinkable that this beer has no business being 8% ABV. This beer is very, very highly recommended. 3,527 charactersfmccormi, Feb 22, 2017

Pours like a murky glass of orange juice with a half-inch khaki head that remains as a thin film on top and leaves thick strands of lace.

3.34/5  rDev -24.6%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.25Can purchased at a beer store in Brooklyn. Impressions below are regrettably brief:
Aroma has a tropical fruit bend with Simcoe-derived onion and some citrusy pulp. Aromatic intensity is average.
Tastewise, tropical fruit dominates the second half, with sweet tangerine dominating. Pulpy orange. Balanced albeit somewhat simple - especially for a beer billed as an IIPA (though its scant 8% ABV may indicate the IIPA designation is merely marketing). 
Texture is medium to full-bodied, smooth, wet, and a bit overcarbonated. Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
Overall, it's drinkable but not dazzling fare and I'm glad I tried it once, but I can't say it's really anything special. I'd sooner reach for Lagunitas Sucks.

Looks and smells like what you would expect from a good NE Style IPA. Taste is excellent with a bunch of different, subtle fruit flavors that blend well. Definitely taste peach, some passion fruit, maybe even a little mango. Hard to believe these flavors aren't adjuncts. Impressed that it only came from the four basic ingredients. The star of this beer however has to be the mouthfeel. It is pillowy soft which makes for such a great drinking experience. Goes down easy.  Looking forward to more beers from Grimm. 607 charactersELS, Oct 08, 2016

2-3 weeks from canning date
Appearance- Pours a glowing, deep golden orange color, very hazy. Finger thick, frothy white colored head. Lots of head lacing on glass.
Aroma- Sweet peach juice, tons of juicy ripe mango, pineapple. Touches of citrus zest and orange juice, orange creamsicle. 
Taste- Tropical fruits, pineapple, juicy mango, passion fruit, sweet peach juice. Citrus zest, sweet and juicy tangerine. Touches of melon and lemon, grassy on the finish.
Feel- Medium bodied, so so creamy and velvety smooth. Perfect mouthfeel for the style. Nice smooth carbonation, spot on.
Overall- An avalanche of juicy fruitiness. So soft and creamy, smooth juiciness with a simple touch of bitterness on the finish. An incredible beer. 748 charactersOrangeMen, Oct 02, 2016

Appearance- pours a deep orange, minimal head with fantastic lacing. Slight haze to it
Aroma- I get nice mix of malt breadiness and fruity citrus.    
Taste-  damn this is good.  A little booze comes forward at initial taste but juice plows through and leaves your mouth wanting more right away.  Light malt at the end too.  
Mouthfeel-  I would not call this creamy,  but for a dipa  this is very smooth.  Hops nicely coat the tongue.  
Overall-  this is my 2nd offering from Grimm with afterimage the first.  Well done guys.  This rivals any of the New England dipas.   Well done guys 634 charactersjcflorian, Oct 01, 2016

Cracked a can today, canned on 9/12, poured it into a tulip glass and let my taste buds go into orbit. 99% of the reviews on here are spot on, so we won't dwell on that. What we will concentrate on is that this is probably the smoothest Dipa's I have imbibed in to date. I tend to steer clear of Dipa's for responsibility reasons only, but after a long Thursday I gave into temptation, and now I want 5 more!!!! 448 charactersmattyd1974, Sep 29, 2016

Pours a hazy orangish-yellow color with two inches of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Tropical fruits, pineapples, mangos, citrus hips, fruity malts, like resin and pine, lemon zest. Tons of tropical fruits. Medium body and moderate to high carbonation.
Overall a really good DIPA; tons of tropical fruits which I love. A little over-carbonated but otherwise great. 407 charactersmdfb79, Sep 26, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Canned 9/12/16. Consumed 9/23/16.
A: Pours a pretty hazy burnt orange with about a finger of pillowy white head. Just the slightest hint of transparency, but almost entirely opaque. Alcohol legs for sure with some wasps of lacing on the glass.
S: Tons of sweet, sticky tropical fruit. Huge passionfruit notes, along with some sweet orange, apricot, and peach. Lots of bubblegum sweetness underlying the fruit-forwardness. Not really much dankness or earthiness to speak of... This is a candied fruit bomb on the nose.
T: Follows the nose pretty closely. Passionfruit, peach, and orange in spades; pineapple and a Juicy Fruit bubblegum flavor to a lesser degree. It's super sweet--almost sticky--but manages to avoid that "cloying" sweetness I get on some bigger DIPAs. It truly tastes like fruit-flavored candy.
M: Extremely soft and smooth on the palette, but not so thick as to feel syrupy. It's extremely sweet with just a bit of bitterness on the backend, but the lightness of the mouthfeel, as well as the pungency of the hop flavors, prevents it from feeling cloying. At 8%, there isn't a hint of alcohol. It packs a ton of flavor and weight with minimal abrasion on the feel.
O: Another fantastic offering from Grimm. Lambo is sweeter than Afterimage, but also packs a softer and fuller mouthfeel. It might be too sweet for some, but the flavor/aroma profile is so damn delicious. For an IPA, it almost tastes decadent, dessert-like. It kinda feels like the archetypal Grimm beer, one that takes their signature candied fruit and soft mouthfeel characteristics to an extreme. Overall, I'd say it's definitely worth trying, especially if you've previously enjoyed some of their other offerings! 1,705 charactersavas, Sep 24, 2016

Look- Pours a hazy but brilliant gold with some orange hue. It looks like orange juice with a creamy two finger head!
Smell- I smelled some awesomeness the second I opened the can! Notes of pineapple, orange, passionfruit, and mango. There is a hint of bready/cheesy yeast that emerges last. 
Taste- Juicy pineapple, orange, passionfruit and mango. A hint of spiciness in the finish along with some floral notes. Huge tropical flavor!
Feel- Very light and slick on the palate. 
Overall- This ranks among the finest DIPA's in my opinion. Just a bouquet of tropical fruit goodness with a light and easy drinking feel. So tasty and dangerously drinkable at 8 percent abv. I could live on this beer! 802 charactersPrager62, Apr 10, 2016

Smell: Spicy, Floral, not too sweet. Opens up to a nice tropical barley smell. (9/10)
Taste: Very strong pine and salty taste, mellows to a fruity tropical blend. (9/10)
Feel: Harsh bite at first that mellows. Lots of grain in this one. Alcohol is faint, but noticeable. (8/10)
Overall: This is like a brighter Focal Banger. A very nice and drinkable beer that creeps up on you. One of the better Grimm offerings. (8/10) 595 characterscurtis6290, Mar 31, 2016

I must say the aroma smells very similiar to some other brew I can't quite put my mind on. It has a good mouthful and fruit juicyness, but leaves a strange lingering after taste that turns my face a bit sour. Overall a very good brew. Would buy again with no hesitation. 378 charactersBeeHoppy860, Mar 16, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy yellow orange color with no vision of anything.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Lemony, citrus, resiny pine, stone fruit, grassy, herbal, tropical, wheaty, bready, and caramel malts. 
Taste:  Delicious hop juice bomb.  Nice malt bill, tingly bitterness, and light chewy notes. 
Mouthfeel:  Super smooth, nice bitterness, medium bodied, medium carbonation, and slightly chewy.
Overall:  I dig it.  I dig it a lot.  Might grab a second glass before it's gone. 634 charactersFlounder57, Mar 12, 2016

A - Murky bright orange with visible flex, white head retains nicely as a mostly full cap and thick ring. Bits of lace left.
S - Surprisingly kind of faint on the scent, but decent mango and melon tones with a good dose of veggie-ish dank hop.
T - Definitely an improvement, but still kind of underwhelming to be honest. More mango, blood orange and grapefruit coming through here, still very much smothered in earthy pine weed. A sweet sugar cookie malt is quite present but doesn't overpower at all.
M - Very smooth with nice carbonation and no booze, quite drinkable for the ABV/style. Kinda on the sweet side of things but decently bitter as well.
O - Good but was certainly expecting more. Seemed a bit muted on the whole and a bit too sweet, the earthy-tropical hop kick was kinda bland. 866 charactersChico1985, Feb 29, 2016

Looks is a hazy straw yellow with a half inch head.
Aroma is very tropical fruit. Light grassy note. 
Taste is a lot more full than the aroma. Light citrus with a touch of pineapple. Toasted malt backs up hop flavor, but has a thinner body. 294 charactersEamonn-Cummings3, Feb 29, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Heard a lot about these guys even though finding something from them was much more difficult to do! After downloading the BeerMenus app and following their social media feeds, I found a few cans of this at The Beer Table To Go in Grand Central for $9 a pop. After working a ton lately, I finally had one this morning, as the canned date of 2/1 ensured that I'd have a fresh beer for my first Grimm Ale!
Great pour to this, as the beer had a subtly radiant orange hue that was somewhat translucent, frothy, and just bubbly enough. The head wasn't thick but it was fitting, just like the perfect rings of lacing that were left behind as I worked my way through this. Lots of juicy citrus in the nose that reminded me of a SingleCut or Treehouse beer but this had something different to it. Maybe it was the sweet malt, the onion and garlic notes underneath, the restrained hops that gently sunk in, or the traces of wheat and sour grass that gave this body and color. All I know was that this unlike anything I ever had and one of the few things that I've consumed worthy of the "artisanal" label. There were hints of red pepper here too and this just took so long to get down only because of the depth of flavors and how natural it felt, as if nothing was extraneously added or out of proportion.
While sufficient in alcoholic content, this was not in the least bit strong and like everything else, it was well in-tune with the rest of the beer. IPA's of all types tend to be a dime a dozen but this almost felt like a meal in a can, which was not a bad thing in any sense! Lots of malt, sweetness, flavor, body, and hops combined for an unbelievable beer that was worth seeking out and paying extra for. On par with the SingleCut and Other Half beers that are making others notice New York's burgeoning beer scene and with any IPA I've ever had.

L: Bright peach and yellow orange hues; hazy body with a moderate white foamy/soapy head with generous lacing
S: Key limes, tangerines, and a distinct dankness on the nose
T: Super juicy and citrusy flavor profile with a slight onion punch that lets you know the El Dorado hops mean business
M: Medium body with moderate carbonation bordering on a soft mouthfeel
O: Another awesome IPA from Grimm. Given that Tree House and Trillium are at the top of the game in terms of IPAs these days it is easy to give into the desire to compare them to Grimm's fantastic IPA offerings. In my opinion, Lambo Door claims a distinct flavor profile within the 'juice bomb' IPA category and even allows a bit of bready malt and hops to shine as compared to some of its peer IPAs. I thoroughly welcomed the hoppy dankness and juicy combo and thought the flavors played well together. Overall this was a delicious brew and one that I hope Grimm will continue to brew in the future. 1,005 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 23, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Canned on 2/1/2016.  The body is a very cloudy, fluorescent-looking light orange color with a tightly packed white head and lots of tiny bubbles steaming upward.  Literally looks like a carbonated orange juice, pulp and all.  The nose is an impressive mix of various fruit juices, ripe mango, peach, papaya, lemon peel, nectarines, sweet melon, dried apricot, honey, and guava.  This one has a nice full body, very juicy with the perfect balance between sweet tropical fruit and dank, bitter resin to cancel each other out to leave a ridiculously pleasant, refreshing fruity aftertaste.  The flavor initially hits you with sweet orange and pine, transitioning to a very juicy blend of pineapple, mango, guava, lemon zest, honey, bubblegum, and melon.  Reminds me of Hill Farmstead beers - Susan, in particular.  If I didn't know better, I'd think this was brewed using multiple adjuncts; hard to imagine that all these aromas and flavors come solely from the hops used.  One of the best DIPAs I've ever had. 1,007 charactersCzarkazm, Feb 21, 2016

Pours a beautiful turbid gold with a quick to leave off white finger of foam that leaves stupid lacicles on the glass that last for the ride.
Sweet graperfruit, honeydew melon, sativa herb, and neutral sweet make a delicious, if light strength, aroma.
Lt./med. strength taste, pretty much just like the aroma, with the neutral sweet never getting out of hand.  End of sip is juicy with just a hint of pine.
Light bodied, lwo carb., clean flavors, so so finish that shuts off pretty quickly.
Unless Grimm lowers the price of this beer, or the others I have tried, I am one person who shall NEVER buy another one. 833 characterscavedave, Feb 21, 2016

Fresh, juicy aroma of apricot,  watermelon,  peach and stone fruit. Some dank grassiness.
Tastes very earthy and resinous. Pine and passionfruit. Grapefruit rush quickly overridden by sweet stone fruit and melon quality. Nominal tangerine.  
Nice and bright feel with medium body. Mellow with slight citric astringency. Great carbonation level that enlivens the palate.
A decidedly east coast ipa. Hazy and big juiciness. But the mouthfeel is really spot on. Needs more bitterness for me. 561 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Feb 21, 2016

Slightly hazy, cloudy light orange. Very attractive This looks really appetizing in the glass. 
Nose aroma is really unique here. Grassy, floral, fruity, malty. The combination of which is really pleasant and unique. 
Sweet malty and grassy. This almost tastes like drinking some sort of fruity candy resin. It hides the 8.0 ABV so well. I mean I literally taste no alcohol whatsoever. This is one of the best IPA's I have tasted from NY. It's that good. Certainly better than what I remember of Heady Topper, and almost a contender with Lawson's SOS. 
The mouthfeel here is so smooth. No abrasiveness at all, and no alcohol taste. Really impressed. The carbonation is spot on too. Lacing is perfect. reminds me of some Other Half or even Lawson's ales with their perfect carbonation sucrose measurements.
Very happy to find this. It's well worth the hype. I would say that this ale is slightly sweet, and could maybe use some more fermentation time to dry it out a bit, but perhaps that may give it a more boozy diacetyl profile. As it stands now this beer is almost perfect, but again, it's very sweet, like drinking a liquid candy syrup. Grimm is doing some of the best ales in the region right now. Hopefully they can expand, and keep the formulae the same like Lawson's did when they opened in Stratford. 1,376 characterspinyin, Feb 21, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled on 2/19/16 from pint glass. Poured from 16 oz can stamped "canned on 2/1/16". Aroma: initial hop aroma of light pine needles and moderate dank hop resins. Aroma developed to reveal light to moderate "bubble gum" notes, and moderate amounts of malt sweetness.  Hops and esters provide hints of pine resins, juicy fruit (the gum), star fruit and hop resins. Appearance: copper color. Very cloudy. Low head retention with white head quickly dissipating and forming film of rocky/fine bubbles on top with heavy rocky bubbles round rim. Moderate amounts of fine lacing. Flavor: hop forward balance with hop flavors of pine and juicy fruit gum. Hop bitterness is high - good for style. Malt flavors moderate - of grainy malts and bread crust. Finish is dry, with aftertaste of hop resins accompanied with a lasting bitterness. Sweet malty notes records end of palate; however does not finish sweet. Yeast characteristics of clean American ale strain. Mouthfeel: medium-heavy body. Moderate carbonation. Moderate alcohol warmth. Low astringency from hops. No creaminess. Overall: very enjoyable double IPA. Malt-hop balance is pleasant; however, malt sweetness is just a hair high which detracts and somewhat muddles hop flavors. Dry finish is great, but not expected with this sweet element. Sweetness does add to "juicyness". No off flavors. Subtle hints of juicy fruit gum, star fruit, and dried mango make this a complex multi-dimensional beer. Would like to see hop aromas increased. 42/50. As an afterthought, it's enough to to make a person wonder if the journey to actually locate and purchase (big $) Grimm beers, then review in a accurate and un-biased  manner is some twisted social experiment... I think all their beer is awesome, but the chase seems to add to the product. 1,786 charactersDavey-C, Feb 20, 2016

4.81/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On Tap:
Pours a murky, hazy yellow orange, with quite a lot of head and lacing.
On the nose, watermelon, peaches and mango -- supported by pine, grass and mint.
Palate is rich, ripe and fruit forward. Watermelon, honeydew, mango, starfruit, orange, nectarine, but again herbaceous green undertones. Creamy texture, and full but not at all flabby. Very light on its feet for an 8% DIPA. Bitterness is quite low, but so much hop flavor. Pinier thru the finish, but still so much fruit. Crazy drinkability. Refreshing! and yet such complexity, and balance. Honeydew burps! To date, my favorite example of this style, pushing it into new territory.
I've been down on DIPA's in general for years now, and this beer makes me question that mindset altogether. 754 charactersnumenor1, Feb 19, 2016

Over an inch of head which lasted for awhile then dissipated leaving nice residue on the glass.  Smells of citrus, pine, hops, slightl bitterness.  What really stood out to me was the beatufil citrus flavor to this ipa, not too overbearing.  Also the lack of bitterness which made it very refreshing and east to drink. Nice mouth feel but more on the thin side.  Overall one of the favorite beers I've had. 488 charactersTheLefty1616, Feb 19, 2016

I say six ounces as the keg kicked during my pour.  Brew is a nice apricot hue with a small foam crown upon the pour.  Tropical fruits such as pineapple, lime and mango hit the nose.  The taste starts fruity and then the malt backbone comes in leaving a nice dry finish that leaves notes of green apple and melon on the palate.  One reviewer mentioned green apple jolly ranchers.  About 5 minutes after consuming my mouth had a nice aftertaste to it akin to green apple.

Hazy orange glow under a small white head that leaves quality clumpy lacing on the glass.  Smells of Citra hops, a bit of pine, peach, mango, apricot, flowers, and red berries.  Flavor seems heavier on the citrus...lemon and tangerine, fresh, vibrant, and zesty with some piney greenness, apricot, and yes, a little pineapple gummy candy.  Crisp, easy drinking - somewhat fluffy and very dry in the finish.  Just a wee little bit of malt poking through, but it hardly interferes.  Tasty stuff (as usual), but didn't blow my socks off (as usual). 563 characterswedge, Feb 17, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is phenomenal. That's the TL;DR version. Reminds me very much of the double IPA style being employed by Tree House in Monson. But the candy sweetness imparted by El Dorado hops is truly magical and unique for this style. Massively juicy, hazy in the glass, even the mouthfeel is similar though not quite as soft as Tree House. Grimm is the real deal. 
Hop aromas are substantial. Orange juice, grapefruit juice, peach flesh and a little mango flesh as well. Nothing notable in the pine resin or onion/garlic dank side of things. Not complaining by the way. 
Alcohol notes are completely and masterfully hidden. How these north east breweries are doing this I will just never understand. It's really remarkable. 
This is a world class imperial IPA there's just no getting around that. I have to get my hands on something else from Grimm. Or just a few more cans of Lambo, that would suit me fine. 908 charactersdd43, Feb 15, 2016
4.37/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.516oz can into a NEBCO tulip.  Canned 2/1/16, drank 2/14/16.
Appearance: Opaque light orange, frothy white head with okay retention and tons of lacing.
Smell: Fruit burst.  Tropical fruit, just-cut-into orange, honeydew melon.  Very bright hop aromas--not dank or pungent, but extremely aromatic.  
Taste: Follows the nose.  Profoundly fresh and fruity; stone fruit, citrus, melon, suggesting really luscious bites of things like watermelon.  Succulent finish heightens this impression.
El Dorado are definitely the star here (and in the aroma) hops-wise.  Some orange from the Citra, and I would guess the earthiness from the Simcoe (and Citra), while not very pronounced in the beer, is probably keeping it from tasting like juice.  No marijuana, no lime, no really out there funk (love those things in IPAs though I do), but lots of really delicious tropical fruit.  Grapefruit aftertaste.
This DIPA should definitely be a crowdpleaser.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied.  Low side of moderate carbonation, puckeringly succulent throughout, pretty dry finish.  Excellent mouthfeel for a DIPA.
Overall: This is the modern DIPA, in what is a very nice time in craft beer.  Definitely a bit pricey, but in the old days you had to wait in line to get flavor close to this.  I bought this in a grocery store in Manhattan. 1,316 charactersPahn, Feb 15, 2016

Cant believe how good this is....look is a little cloudy orange, smell is slightly hoppy and very piney, taste is fruity, citrusy and very clean, virtually no bitterness....this beer may change my opinion on IPA/DIPA.Excellent stuff. 353 charactersmanfromanotherplace, Feb 14, 2016

Pours a hazy and nearly opaque dark orange. The liquid appears to glow in the glass. Beautiful. Huge tropical nose of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and peaches. The taste is really something else and takes the huge candied tropical fruits flavor to the next level. On the backend there's a little bit of dankness with a light bitterness throughout. Moderately thick and sticky mouthfeel; I can practically feel the hops in my teeth. 
Truly tastes like hop candy. I might prefer Tesseract very slightly, but Lambo Door certainly lives up to the hype. 671 charactersTomMorris, Feb 14, 2016

4.44/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Canned on 02/01/16: Pours cloudy gold orange color with a thick 2 finger foamy white head that faded very, very slowly, leaving excellent foamy lace rings as it faded. Lots of foamy lacing residue coat the sides as the brew goes down.
Smells of tropical fruit, graham cracker, pineapple, orange peel, red grapefruit, biscuit, toffee, brown sugar, fresh cut grass, piney hops, mango, apricot, herbs like tea leaf for fresh tobacco, and a mix of tropical fruit and candy like gummy bears. Nice balance allows the fresh, juicy hops to stay center stage and star of the nose.
Tastes similar to the aroma with strong citrus and tropical fruit up front, followed by pineapple, orange peel, red grapefruit, lemon, biscuit, light caramel, toffee, graham cracker, brown sugar, fresh cut grass, piney hops mango, papaya, tea leaf, faint spices including pepper and coriander, candy like gummy bears and Razzles. Almost seems like hop oils make it slick and extra juicy, with peaches, starfruit and tangerine kicking in along with fresh floral hop cones. Well balanced, this hides the 8% ABV completely and masterfully.
Mouthfeel is creamy and slick with a medium body, mild carbonation, nice texture and a slightly bitter finish that trails off with a lot of fruity notes and citrus zest that has the malt backbone supporting it as it fades tasty and sweet, but not cloyingly sweet. Nice feel, easy drinking and a really nice display of hops.
2/17/2017: Had one canned 02/07/17 and it had a great looking foamy white head and much better lacing that went down extremely slowly and left foamy and spider web foam coating the sides. Raising the "Look" score from 4.25 to 4.5. Nose was also much better than the last time I had it with stronger grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple and tropical fruit, along with gummy bears or other fruity candy - raising the "Smell" score from 4 to 4.25.
Tastes again started out with strong citrus and floral hops, then followed by fresh grapefruit, clementine, tropical fruit, pineapple, orange peel, lemon, starfruit, biscuit, light caramel, faint brown sugar, piney hops or light spruce, tea leaf, light peppery spices, and candy like gummy bears and Razzles. Nice malty sweetness as it fades gave it perfect balance covering the 8% ABV with hoppy goodness as it did a year ago. "Taste" score also got raised from 4.25 to 4.5.
Overall Rating went up from 4.27 to 4.44, I'm very glad I got to have this delicious brew again. 2,454 charactersCHickman, Feb 14, 2016

Pours hazy golden orange with fluffy white head and thick lacing, smells like mango flesh, citrus cotton candy, flower petals, orange blossom, and a hint of biscuits and marzipan,  taste is sweet orange hard candy, citrus zest that transitions into dank bitter citrus pith leaving a stickiness on the tongue, feel is medium light with light carbonation. Like eating an orange whole, flower, peel and all, covered in cotton candy. 471 charactersChipChaight, Feb 14, 2016

A - A beautiful East Coast IPA.  Four fingers of towering white foam on top of a blurry, bright honeyed-peach body.
S - Outrageous nose loaded with tropical fruit.  Papaya, honeydew melon, peaches, vanilla, and woody thyme.
T - Juicy profile loaded with peaches, orange creamsicle, passion fruit, and mango, and accented with greener notes of baby bok choy, melon rind, and a touch of bitter resin.
M - Stellar.  Creamy, sorbet-like mouthfeel on a smooth medium frame.
O - One of the best fruit-forward IPA's out there.  p.s. almost want to classify this as a White IPA. 618 charactersvfgccp, Feb 12, 2016

Aroma is strong right from the can, wonderful tropical juice right in the face.  Mango,  melon,  pineapple. Taste for the most part matches the aroma, although I think it's become more aggressive yet maintained good balance since the cans I had a week ago. It's trading great.  It's still very soft on the palate, although not their softest DIPA offering (cloud busting). It's still probably my favorite DIPA I've had from them,  but their all elite beers and none runs away from the rest of the pack. 625 charactersJordonHoltzman, Sep 10, 2015

No alcohol whatsoever. Finished with more fruit cup essence. M - nice medium semi oily like I said before..this is a public school lunch fruit cup. O - this is another example of why I drive from the bronx to Brooklyn to find great craft hoppy beer brewed in small batches. Absolutely fucking dope dipa brewed here in New York city. If you can find it. Buy it. Drink it. Repeat!!!
Cheers!!! 858 charactersosant37, Aug 10, 2015

Definitely on the sweeter side of an IPA with not too strong of a pine taste, but still really enjoyed the beer. 212 charactersSkellbop, Aug 05, 2015

This one pours a dark orange, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.
This smells like candied orange and candied pineapple, caramelized sugar, and a bit of pine.
There's definitely some sweet syrupiness to this one. It's a little bit too sweet, but that doesn't stop that that it's a delicious beer. There's definitely a candied sugary fruit character to it, orange and pineapple, definitely a bit of grapefruit, and some sweet malt.
This has a nice, juicy and rich mouthfeel. The guys at Grimm said the Gummi Bear juice was used for mouthfeel, and it definitely gave it a richer and slightly syrupy mouthfeel.
Another nice IPA from Grimm. Not as good as Tesseract or Cloudbusting though, but still a worthy entry anyway. 781 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 02, 2015

Easily one of the fruitiest DIPAs of the summer. Worth searching out! 179 charactersJtbel1988, Jul 31, 2015
