A - poured a dark brown color with a small tan head.
S - aroma is sweet caramel, toffee, oak, molasses and light bourbon. 
T - very much resembles the aroma. Lots of sweet maltiness, some plum and brown sugar as well. 
M - Full and creamy. Goes down very smooth a with hardly any trace of the 12% abv. 
O - this was definitely worth the chase for me to get a try of it. Not sure it was unique enough to justify another chase but a must try nonetheless. 484 charactersCarsonbros, Jul 05, 2017

4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a very dark brown color, bordering black in color. No head to speak of with ample alcohol legs and only some lacing. 
Aroma is a nice balance of dark fruits, bourbon, toasted oak and sweet malt. Brown sugar, raisins, and prunes are all prevalent. A booziness is also detectable.  
Taste is very nice. Some dark fruit character is noted up front with a surprisingly high carbonation level. Raisins and prunes are most notable, but a blend of generic dark character exists. This quickly transitions away from the traditional quad flavors and into the barrel. Heavily toasted oak and bourbon bombard the palate. The character is similar to that of other FW barrel-aged beers like parabola. Some toasted coconut, toffee, caramel, and brown sugar finish the sip. The mouthfeel is lighter than a stout but still viscous. A sipper for sure. As the beer warms, some booze also presents itself. 
Overall, this beer was consumed the day returning from a nice vacation to Canada. As with most barrel-aged beers from FW, the barrel-character is dominate, which I love. In this case, I would have preferred a little less to allow the quad character to shine more. The barrel dominates and overshadows the base beer. I see this pairing well with a cedar grilled salmon glazed with maple syrup. It gets a 94.5/100. 1,308 charactersDaverCS, Jun 30, 2017

Taste: upfront your hit with this pleasant booziness that lends its way into sweet apples and figs. The mid palte is full of malt sweetness big toffee and Carmel a little bit of raisin, banana, and carmalized sugar in the finish the barrel characters Come out . A bit of charred oak, vanilla sweetness and a touch of leather, with that sweetness, booziness and some cigar tobacco lingering in the aftertaste. The beer warms the chest as the beer goes down. Boozy but not overwhelming at all.
Feel: Full body great carbonation. Really smooth and velvety. A great beer to sip on. Enjoy the complexities this beer has to offer.
Overall: I love this its a great quad. Boozy and sweet with just enough of that barrel showing itself. If you like quads and haven't had this you should! 962 charactersMasonz223, Jun 20, 2017

Nose is a very clean sweet caramel, vanilla and maybe cherry, resulting in what I can best explain as that sweet pipe tobacco - Cavendish maybe?
Taste immediately sweet. Like huge sweet. Flavor profile follows the nose, but ironically after the pipe tobacco comparison, I now actually get a tobacco taste amongst the cherry and vanilla. In no way, shape or form is there an overwhelming heat on this. In fact, I'd bet I did myself a favor in not cellaring this, as it is smooth right now. Finish is only slightly bitter while sweet still rules the day. 689 charactersgopens44, Jun 18, 2017

Smell: For me, this beer smells like red licorice nibs with a candied malt element.
Taste:  Yes, red licorice nibs is my initial impression, followed by a pleasant nutty note and barrel characteristics. For the distinct style the beer is going for ("west coast quad") I think the taste hits the perfect mark.
Feel: Semi thick, but very smooth and creamy. Dangerously drinkable at 12.5%.
Overall: I had 2016 and 2017 batches and they both hit the mark on a world class barrel aged beer. For me, aging this beer is futile, as it's close to perfect at release. No need to mellow it out or imparting more flavor by aging when this thing is ready to go now. 752 charactersdream, Jun 08, 2017

Smells of candied sugar and caramel. Corn syrup laden candy corn, very faint earthy hops, vanilla and oak. Low grade bourbon and dark fruits.
Tastes sweet as phuck. Heavy, heavy candied sugar - my teeth feel gritty. Very prominent bitter bite from an earthy hop variety starkly contrasts the sweetness. There's faint vanilla and there's an oaky twinge, but quite frankly I taste no bourbon barrel presence.
Feel is thick, dry and creamy.
Overall I don't know. I like quads and I like all things barrel aged, but I'm not sure this one isn't riding high on.the renowned heels of parabola. I'll take a st Bern 12 or a Boulevard bbq over this to be quite honest. 772 charactersrypkr, May 28, 2017

Finally get the luxury of having this beauty on Tap locally with the entrance of FW in to the Iowa Market.
Pours a dark Amber that turns to almost black with a full glass. As you sip it down it gradually turns to a more reddish brown.
Smell is straight Caramel
Taste follows the nose with loads of caramel, some dark fruits, and good sweetness. The barrel character on these FW barrel aged beers are some of the best IMO. Vanilla also makes a rather strong appearance. 
Overall a very great offering. Found it kind of ironic that I got to get this on draft here at home before I cracked my 2016 that I actually had to trade for. After this experience I am for sure looking forward to that 2016 vintage. 723 charactersECOBOOSTINST, May 10, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle:
Pours a date-like brown, deep but with an auburn hue in a full glass.  Little more rusty reddish hue as the volume allows more light.  Held doesn't get too big, but sits tight for a few before sitting down against the glass edge.  There's even a feign at some lacing.
Nose is mostly fig and/or an unsweet date.  There's an alcohol component that almost brings a little spice to the impression.  Other light notes include date bread and specifically the orange zest pulled from a Manhattan.
Taste is much like the nose, but with a surprisingly lighter feel seems weaker, relatively.  Opening taste leans a little more date but doesn't stay too sweet.  An earthiness than grows slightly bitter later in the taste comes on next (as it warms this actually becomes more of a wooden note on the bitter side).  The body grows with the addition of cola notes and a lighter than the nose indicated alcohol spice.  Bitterness gains here in some sips, takes a little longer in others.  Not a huge lingering flavor, which might be nice, I think.
A restrained beer that hits the notes more subtly than many.  I sort of flipped on the "weakness" of the flavor and the fact that I never felt weighed down by a sip of the brew.  As stated, I'd like the flavor to linger a little to entice m to savor it a bit more, if I had just one request here. 1,341 characterscjgiant, May 06, 2017

Pours dark clear red-brown with almost no head, slightly viscous, looks like a cross between root beer and bourbon.
Aroma is of bourbon, vanilla, a dark fruity warmth, a little bit medicinal, a little bit of Dr. Pepper and root beer, some bits of chocolate and caramel, a little boozy. Has a lot of barrel character.
Taste is on the sweet and malty side, complex, with most of the notes from the smell and the addition of some alcohol warmth.  Some alcohol and some sweetness on the finish.
Feel is a bit sticky, lingering in all the crevices, with medium body with light carbonation.
Overall: Awesome. 655 charactersPlinyMeNow, Apr 29, 2017

Pours fairly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red/brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and toasted oak; with lighter notes of banana, pepper, clove, chocolate, tobacco, leather, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, bourbon barrel, and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, cherry, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and toasted oak; with lighter notes of banana, pepper, clove, chocolate, tobacco, leather, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light yeast and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, brown bread, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, toasted oak, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, bourbon barrel, and dark/bready malt sweetness; with a nice malt/yeast/oak spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Slightly drying from bourbon/oak spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky/grainy/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden; a mild warmth lingering after the finish, with zero barrel booziness. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged Quadrupel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, bourbon barrel, and dark/bready malt sweetness; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. Awesome barrel balance/integration with the base beer; and well rounded yeast/malt complexity. A highly enjoyable offering. 2,043 characterssuperspak, Feb 05, 2017

There's so much vanilla, you would think they aged it on vanilla bean. Toasted coconut is almost as strong. Those flavors coming from the barrel are so strong they almost overpower the base beer and make the beer to sweet. Fortunately, this is really well crafted and the dark fruits and cherry notes from the quad hold their own in this decadent liquid desert. If there were a touch of coffee or bitter dark chocolate, or something earthy to complement the sweetness, this would be a 4.75. Excellent beer. 608 charactersdanh53, Jan 25, 2017

4.36/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Deep cola hue with a little fizz & head. Aroma has lots of sticky toffee malt with undertones of leather, raw cocunut and tobacco leaf; however, there was a rogue buttered popcorn smell as well. It dissipates somewhat but was still noticeable and just jive with those other notes.
Taste rebounded for me. Incredible dark molasses flavor all over the tongue that meshes wonderfully with those classic bourbon flavors (caramel, oak, vanilla). For a Quad it is low on that traditional phenol flavor but you won't notice with everything else dancing around your palate. It ends sweet (the candied sugar really sneaks out from behind those more powerful flavors) with a little bourbon booze kiss. 692 charactersajm5108, Jan 16, 2017

The most unremarkable aspect is the look but it's all world class from there. Pours a garnet/brown with almost no head - looks like cola without the fizz. Aroma is oak, roasted malt and that complex fruit and spice assortment that comes with Belgian yeast. Taste...my god the taste. Unreal. Toasted coconut, vanilla, oak, molasses, roasted malt, fruity esters, spice, brown sugar, butterscotch, kiln-dried tobacco all in one slow cascade that you don't want to end. Finishes incredibly smooth without any discernible alcohol heat or stickiness. It's an experience that redefines your expectations of what a barrel can do to a beer. 680 charactersManapuaMan, Jan 01, 2017

It pours a clear mahogany color with ruby hues, and a foamy, ecru-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. It is aromatic with smells of cherry, raisin, caramel, molasses, oak, and alcohol. The taste is decadent:  sweet and cloying cherry, raisin, brown sugar, and vanilla swirling together before the bourbon appears.  There is also some subtle vanilla/toffee at the finish.  All the flavors are beautifully blended to create a unique and delicious overall taste.  This Quad is thick, viscous, and reminiscent of a cordial, and with its 11.6% ABV it is most definitely a sipper, perfect for after-dinner.  Overall, it is one of those beers the drinking of which can rightfully be called an experience. It is hard to find in my area and I save it for special occasions. 816 charactersMacMalt, Nov 26, 2016

Stickee Monkee is a deep redish brown with thin fizzy head that settles quickly. Clarity is good when held to the light.
Aroma is sweet and slightly boozy with the bourbon barrel aging making itself known. The base beer provides a raisin and toffee sweetness.
Flavor is sweet up front like a sticky toffee pudding. It has the raisins and dark fruits of a strong Belgian quad but is overlaid with vanilla and bourbon is perfect balance.
Mouthfeel is smooth and a balanced. It started off a little harsh when it was cold but, as it warms and the carbonation softens, it turns perfectly drinkable.
Overall this is an excellent example of barrel aging as Firestone Walker always does so well. The quad style works really well with the barrel aging character. Great after a year of aging and could probably go several more. 866 charactersGilGarp, Nov 25, 2016

Large perfumy, rose-like, and spicy alcohol aroma bordering on solventy. Moderate presence of fruity esters, including figs, raisins, and plums. Light vanilla as well as light oaky and woody notes.
Deep coppery-brown with deep garnet hues. Slightly hazy. No head. 
Medium high complex sweet malt flavor with deep caramel and toffee. Bitterness is medium low, and the finish is moderately sweet but not overly syrupy. Esters are medium low with raisins and figs.
Full, syrupy bodied with low carbonation and high alcohol warmth. No astringency, but there is an alcohol bite. 
A dark ale with a complex and rich, smooth malt profile, dark fruit flavors, and spicy elements. 788 charactersretry4z, Oct 22, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Milky like the bottom of a miso soup, with a deep brown and ruby body, a dense light tawny head fades to a thin ring. The nose is hit hard with rich caramel and alcohol burn, whiskey spice and raw oak, butter and warm vanilla. Between the oak, alcohol, and whiskey notes, this leans more towards a liquor than a beer- which I'm all for. Flavor backs off this intense heat and puts on the forefront warm butterscotch, vanilla sweetness, toasted wood, a bit of ethanol, a touch of brown sugar, and toasted malt verging on classic German foundations. As the name would imply, very stickee mouthfeel here, rich and hot and thick and syrupy.
What a ride. More like a barleywine than a quad, especially with the only diminutive presence of added sugars, but delicious nonetheless. The heat of the nose didn't scare me, quite the opposite, so I was disappointed that even with the rich and colorful flavors it had toned itself down from this olfactory advertisement. Still packs a wallop with variety and nuance, as oxymoronic as that sounds, and totally enjoyable. 1,058 characters1000lbgrizzly, Sep 30, 2016

A: Pours a pretty slick dark brown color, decent amount of bubbly mocha head around the edge. 
S: Really dynamic here with layers of sweet molasses and brown sugar, followed by a punch of dark fruits and grapes, with a nice wrapped finish of oak and bourbon.
T: Bigger fruit notes up front, raisins, figs, molasses. Finish is just a touch of oak and bourbon and vanilla, not huge though. 
M: Medium to full body with just enough carbonation that is more noticeable in the pour. Alcohol hidden very well.
O: Very surprised by this one. It's odd that across the Proprietor's Vintage series, I actually prefer Helldorado and Stickee Monkee to both Parabola and Sucaba. Maybe it's just the light, more drinkable balance that these two have, I'm not sure. This one is sweet and tasty, but not too heavy or bruising on the palate. 
Recommendation: Like the other boxed Firestone Walker beers, this one is a must-try. 1,047 charactersSparty1224, Sep 28, 2016

Taste is nice and sweet for this quad. Sooo smooth. So glad I stopped in. 339 charactersGregaroo, Sep 22, 2016

S - Smell is dark fruits (figs, cherries, plums), brown sugar, candi sugar, caramel malt, really sweet candy like. 
T - Taste is basically the same with big sweet candi sugar flavor, then dark fruits like red grapes, sweet cherries, plums, and figs, caramel. Definitely some vanilla, oak and bourbon in there too but less so than youd expect. 
M - Heavy beer, thinner than parabola but still a big ass beer. Aftertaste is super smooth and clean Belgian quad, I'm guessing this is not a Belgian yeast ? 
O - great beer. Had both on tap and in bottle. Would buy again in a second. 
2013 and 2016 side by side: .2013 is more malty with age, has some oxidation to it. Both are amazing. 799 charactersHopHunter19, Aug 26, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.51L howler from Sherbrooke Liquor store, and obviously the best format in which to appreciate this particular offering firsthand, eh?
This beer pours a clear, dark orange-brick brown colour, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and well-bubbly tan head, which leaves some decent melting ice floe lace around the glass as it slowly but surely sinks away.
It smells of rather sweet brown sugar syrup, bready caramel malt, slightly biscuity toffee, dark fleshy orchard fruit, vanilla-forward Bourbon notes (with some wood and rye graininess), subtle milk chocolate, a touch of besotted yeast, and very tame earthy, leafy, and floral hop bitters.  The taste is still fairly sweet, with the big caramel/toffee malt one-two punch, some now molasses-like dark sugary character, heavily creamed coffee, somewhat laid-back Bourbon (and no change on that vanilla stranglehold), muddled black Mediterranean fruit, a growing omen of alcohol ingress, and some hoppiness that left without closing the damned door.
The bubbles are adequate in their barely supportive frothiness, the body a solid medium-heavy weight, and pretty smooth, if you maintain a certain cognitive dissonance about that well north of 20-proof, behind the scenes booziness, and getting creamier as things warm.  It finishes sweet, yeah, and sticky, sure, and bereft of monkeys, but somehow moderated overall.
Holy mother of all that is holy (ok, HOLY SHIT!), is this good, no, great, no, no, no - freaking fantastic!  Not in a world-beating manner (because that would mean that it's on par with Westy 12 or Rochefort 10), but because it seems to be defining something different, maybe the 'American Quad', i.e. big and sweet, but level, with lots of (obviously) sugary fruitiness, and yet sans the old castle basement musty and phenolic stuff.  Whatever, this is so enjoyable, I'm going to have to sign off now before I really embarrass myself! 1,912 charactersbiboergosum, Aug 22, 2016

A-Poured a Dark brown, with little rays of light coming through. Mild carbonation with a slight tan head. 
S-brown sugar, molasses, slight notes of bourbon and bread. Very light and sweet. 
T-molasses and brown sugar. Slight hint of bourbon and oak. A tad sweet, maybe coconut. Very mellow and sweet. Dessert beer. 
M-light bodied, with minimal carbonation. Bourbon and brown sugar up front, slightly dry finish. Extremely drinkable beer. 
O-This was a very balanced and drinkable beer. A little light compared to others of the style, but a solid beer. Would definitely drink again, but would prefer Trappistes 10 for the price and availability. 716 charactersDrinkThemAll, Aug 15, 2016

The beer pours a very light head before it dissipates quickly and leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The head is a light tan color with a nice and creamy appearance. The beer itself is an opaque beer with a dark brown look that strongly resembles black. However, if you look at it from the top, you can tell the actual beer color.
The smell is pretty good. The smell consists of a strong dark fruit notes from the malts and surprisingly pleasant and present caramel malt note. The barrel notes definitely come out well in this beer. The whiskey note is present and its slight spiceness contrasts well with the Belgian Candi sugar. The smell also has a present molasses note but it tends to get lost rather quickly.
The taste is fantastic. While the Quad notes are second to the barrel notes, it is actually a close second and the two actually mix with each other in a good way. The taste is much more complex than the smell because of this. The whiskey taste is not as strong but there is definitely an interesting molasses note and brown sugar mingling with the Belgian sugar to create something sweet with the spiceness from the whiskey keeping it from becoming too sweet. There is also a slight hop bitterness to the beer as well in the aftertaste but not much. The aftertaste tends to be fairly sweet with some caramel in it.
The feel is pretty good. It is a heavy bodied beer but the body feels much thinner than someone would expect it to. The carbonation gives it a fizzy texture that gives it something else to do. It has a slightly sticky finish to it.
Overall, this is a very good beer and Firestone once again demonstrates why its Proprietor Vintage series is immensely popular among craft beer fans. While the taste notes and the barrel aging are different than what you would expect from the style, it still manages to stay faithful to it. This one is a definite must have to get a hold of. 1,968 charactersHattedClassic, Jul 31, 2016

This review for the 2016 version is just a carbon copy.  This beer is probably one of the best beers I've ever had.  It's smooth sweet flavors and wonderful nose just keep inviting you in for more.  If you don't pay attention, the abv will get ya!  This beer is worth the annual wait and Firestone Walker does an amazing job.  Get it while you can!!!! 461 charactersSeh4fredom, Jul 30, 2016

Bottle to snifter.
LOOK:   dark brown, opaque, frothy head...fades quickly.
AROMA:  caramel, cinnamon, French toast, tobacco.   
TASTE:  molasses, plum, fig, cinnamon, banana, root beer, 
FEEL:   so this is where the name comes from, right?   stickey and sweet, like a cinnabon.
Very complex taste.  The barrel has made this very mellow and enjoyable.  This is a great beer.  Can't wait to see what some age will do to the other 2 bottles I picked up ( but I'll have to).

Palate Contaminants: none
Appearance is an opaque brown that lets little light through. It might not let much light through, yet it's not super dark. It's pretty interesting.
The nose is not particularly volatile. A little dark wood, dark sugar (not quite molasses), and alcohol. Characteristics are slightly sweet and moderately savory.
The taste beats the smell on intensity by a mile. The savory elements are what strike me first. Butter, toffee, and caramel. It also has a bit of nuttiness, I'll go with Brazil nut and hazelnut. Tea, too. I guess those go with the woody motif. Sometimes I get a bit of burnt sugar, and then vanilla hits me every two or three sips. 
It's only about a year old, so there's still a bit of alcohol, but it doesn't feel like a twelver. The weight isn't heavy, but it has a ton of flavor. The aftertaste lingers for a while and is pretty enjoyable. Super drinkable. Be careful. 932 charactersZythophile, Jul 17, 2016

Smell is oak, vanilla, ripe fig, clove, bourbon, brown sugar, and toffee.
Taste follows loads of oaky vanilla, clove, and dark fruit upfront with cooked brown sugar and bourbon in the dry and bold finish.
Mouthfeel is a big medium, little carbonation, dry, and a sipper that goes down darn easy.

So damn drinkable!  Nice barrel aromas but not overpowering.  Soft, leathery mouth feel.  Sweet, malty flavors that are enhanced by the barrel flavors instead of dominated.

Misc.: 2014 vintage
To say I’m excited to review this one might be the understatement of the millennium. Picked this up awhile back with Rachel at Trader Joe’s. It was the last one available and I had never heard of it. I tried a taster of it on June 11, 2015 at Blind Lady Ale House and gave it a 4.5 on Untappd and just wrote: Taste. Wow. I don’t have any recollections of flavor and anything else, so this will be from scratch. 
Poured a mahogany color with two fingers of khaki-tan, fizzy head, which dissipated rather quickly. Average spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 3.75)
Smelled big whiff of boozy bourbon right away, followed by oaky wood, Belgian candied sugar, coconut flakes, vanilla, dried tobacco and toasted brown sugar. Hidden behind the booziness is some fig, dates and raisins, more leathery tobacco and sugary caramel. (Smell - 4.25)
Tasted just amazing. Instantly remember how good this thing was. Got smoother bourbon than the nose, but still boozy, warming all the way down to my legs. Also Belgian candied sugar, sugar cane, oaky wood, leathery tobacco, toasted brown sugar, maple syrup, sweet caramel, boozy chocolate syrup, vanilla, coconut flakes, plum, fig, dates, dried raisins and cocoa. (Taste - 4.75)
Full body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Long, boozy, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)
Loved this one. Haven’t put together the overall ratings, but might be the best Firestone beer I’ve ever had. Battling neck-and-neck with Sucaba. (Overall - 4.75)

Super hazy, murky, dired date/ fig color with minimal head. 
I can smell this beer and I'm several feet away from it. Smells like a dried fig, soaked in bourbon, and covered chocolate. Oak comes into play as well. Awesomeness. 
The taste follows just as the nose states, but follows with a ton of coconut and maple syrup. The oak and maple flavors linger at the end. 
Very sweet, but so, so good. Some of the banana-like esters have seemed to have faded since the initial release. 499 charactersraynmoon, Feb 27, 2016

I am convinced: FW barrel aged beers are wonderful  beers to cellar. I don't drink them fresh anymore.
Poured a dark chocolate color with a 1F head in a Stone RIS glass.
At first, the aroma seemed fainter than other barrel aged beers from FW: Sucaba and Parabola.
deep chocolate, but not pronounced.
The taste is incredible: deep layered chocolate. More chocolate than other FW barrel aged beers.
Intense milk chocolate, with other chocolate flavors. Also tobacco. This comes in gradually.
The MF is not carbonated and smooth. This changes with time. The sharp hoppy bitterness comes into play with warming.
Sipping is a must with this beer. At different temps, different qualities. The chocolate gives away
 to a deeper tobacco like flavor with warming. The oak starts to come in and eventually  is present in the aroma.The bitterness becomes more and more intense.
Great beer! The best way to drink this beer is to savor it at different temps, noting the changes in flavor and bitterness. 1,027 charactersbrureview, Feb 25, 2016

3.25 A:  Dark brown, almost black color.  Less than one finger of short lived, fizzy beige head formed.  No lacing left.
4.5 S:  To start, you have to have a creative mind to call this a quad.  This is very much a big, sticky FW amalgamation reminiscent of one of their anniversary beers.  That said, the barrel is the forefront of the nose, which isn't surprising given that Belgian beers and surely quads live in subtlety.  Toasted coconut, oak, vanilla, and leather stick out.  Moderately boozy.  Sticky grenadine, spicy peppery Belgian yeast, candi sugar, brown sugar, molasses.  Dates, black currants, raisins, tobacco.  
4.5 T:  No surprises here.  It's just as sticky and rich as it smells.  Tobacco, leather, dates, and black currants are the strongest flavors.  Toastiness, cherry juice, brown sugar, molasses.  Again moderately boozy.  Spicy peppery yeast.
4.25 M:  Heavy, heavy body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Very sticky with sugary amylase bunching in the back of the throat.  
4.5 M:  It's not a great quad, but it is a great beer.  It seems more like a huge mesh of a bunch of different beers.  Quite nice. 1,167 charactersDavoleBomb, Feb 21, 2016

The beer pours a hazelnut brown color, with brighter ember hints in it. Yields a small, fizzy head, which won't rebuild after excessive swirling. 
The nose offers a tremendous amount of Bourbon soaked oak, spicy, warm, full of coconut and earth mingled vanilla. This gets coated up by rock sugar, toffee and caramel, exhibiting a profound sweetness, gently balanced by the multi layered barrel. The nose finds an additional layer in roasted, warm nutshells, licorice and wild honey.
Drinks with just the required amount of carbonation, subtle, yet well accentuated, preventing the beer from sticking to the tongue, keeps it going with a lot of nuances becoming detectable on the palate. Provides a silk, not overly thick body, ensuring the sugar rush to maintain enjoyable.
Tastes of earth coated, melting toffee, a subtle spiciness, more earth and a nice roast quality, enriching the malts. As the Bourbon gets introduced to the palate, more spices unfold, entangled into rock sugar and a pleasant, slick coffee dryness. While this produces a rich sweetness, it does by no means overpower the beer's overall taste profile, tamed and enriched by the well pronounced Bourbon. Finishes with a noteable bite within the otherwise complete silk mouthfeel, representing a warming, still enjoyably balanced Bourbon peak. A dry spice bitterness represents the introduction to the beers finish, with rock sugar and melted toffee remaining detectable, showcasing a clean, yet appealing ending.
This may be the most complex, well nuanced sweet beer I've ever had. At first, I've been disappointed by its thinner mouthfeel, then I started to undertand its benefits. The palate reacts more sensitive to peppery Bourbon, the utmost silk mouthfeel and changes within the malt sweetness, without becoming sticky or cloying. Nontheless, this is still a sipper, a pleasant one though. 1,898 charactersaleigator, Feb 16, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Stickee Monkee pours the same burgundy as a traditional quad. The nose is dominated by vanilla extract and brown sugar. There’s a little fig and plum, but mostly the Monkee smells like a particularly smoky bourbon. I note on first sip that this isn’t far removed from the bourbon-y barleywines in Firestone Walker’s catalogue. Yes, there’s a stronger raisin presence, but overall we’re talking Russell Stover butterscotch. To my taste, Stickee Monkee is too sugary to be enjoyable. A quad is already larded with malt, heavy on candi sugar, and spiked by tangy yeast, so to then age it in bourbon and brandy barrels seems, well, excessive. The heavy feel and heavy burn match the taste and aroma. 705 charactersTheCuriograph, Feb 11, 2016

A: Pours a deep cola brown with a finger of bubbly dark tan head that quickly disappeared into a thin collar.
S: Sweet nose with tons of barrel quality. I get notes of leather, raisin, candied dates, black figs, red grape, and a touch of caramel and bitter hop resin. Booze is noticeable but not rough at all. Super sweet and sugary smelling.
T: Follows the nose with all of the flavors from the nose along with the addition of vanilla and tobacco leaf in the finish. Leather, sweet grape juice, molasses, and boozy barrel quality dominate. I get nuances of dark chocolate and cocoa as well. The finish is lightly bitter, and notes of candied sugar, caramel, vanilla and grape linger long after the swallow. I get a touch of roast throughout, and a very low alcohol presence. For being 13%, the alcohol is hidden very well. 
M: Full body, thick and chewy mouthfeel, with low carbonation. Very sweet overall, and there’s a thick alcohol quality but the booze isn’t warming. 
O: The flavor profile is more like a barreled aged barleywine mixed with a quad. Ultra sweet as per the description. Another complex sipper from FW, but this was far too sweet for me to finish a whole bottle of in one sitting. 1,256 charactersscottfrie, Jan 20, 2016

Pushes the envelope in sweetness, the alcohol is noticeable without sticking out.  An excellent beer although the style is more "FW Barrel" than quad,and the rich sweetness and oak definitely over power some of the quad characteristics. 437 charactersZonk, Jan 04, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bomber ($18.99) into a nonic:
Appearance: black. Small, dark brown head, but it has some solid retention, lingering for a few minutes. This is impressive at almost 14%.
Aroma: tons and tons and tons of barrel. Reeks of wood. That being said, its not a rough smell, like tobacco and leather....it's soft and sweet, with lots of candy and molasses in the background. Incredibly soft and welcoming. Smells like it's got some boozy punch behind it for sure.
Taste: not much heat at all, surprisingly. Flavors are, like the aroma, soft and subtle and emerge further as the beer warms. Started drinking this one at around 40 degrees, and it got better and better as it reached cellar temps. Lots of molasses, burnt sugar, and caramel to begin with. Finishes sweeter and with some dark fruits as well, like fig and date. The barrel definitely creates a unique quad-much different than the Trappist quads in flavor.
Feel: thick and syrupy, this is definitely more of a sipping beer in terms of drinkability. Heavy body, with not much carbonation. The softness, however, is a plus in my book, as it lets the subtle flavors packed into this beer come out more easily.
Overall: if you are looking for a traditional quad, this is not the beer to drink. It doesn't have yeasties, that lovely purple-auburn color, or the fluffy head that comes with Trappist quads. It does, however, have tons of flavor, and is an incredibly delicate and complex beer. Seek it out and crush it! 1,487 charactersTheElectricOne, Dec 13, 2015

3.35/5  rDev -24.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.25Currently #92 in the Top 250  and the 4th highest rated quadrupel in the top 250. As this may well be my favourite style, I'm excited to try it - but wary given the brewery, whose beers that are well regarded by most tend to disappoint.
PRESENTATION: 650ml brown glass bottle comes in a cardboard box, imitating fine whisk(e)ys. Crown cap is covered by black foil paper. 2015 vintage no. 002. 
3500 cases produced. 28.6 plato O.G. 7.7 plato F.G. 22 IBUs. 67.5 SRM. Brewed with Lucha Libre yeast. 12.5% ABV.
Reviewed live as a barrel aged quadrupel per the label. Served chilled into an Orval goblet and allowed to come to temperature over the course of consumption.
HEAD: Cap is a nice looking khaki-tan with ample creaminess. Appears soft and luscious; very inviting. Good (thick) consistency, with a nice shining complexion. Recedes evenly, leaving no lacing. Retention is superb at this high an ABV - easily ~5 minutes. It's not the delicate, fragile, rich head of the very best Trappist examples of the style, but it's definitely quality.
BODY: Uncommonly dark for the style, coming in at a solid black. The deep auburn hues of traditional Belgian offerings are definitely more sightly, but this is excusable given the barrel aging. Though the absence of visible yeast particulate does make it seem less alive.
It appears well-carbonated and I find it attractive, but it's not in the upper echelon of the style in terms of looks.
AROMA: Turbinado sugar is put to good use here, indeed mimicking the aromas of Belgian candi sugar. But mimicry is  mimicry, and this is a notch below Trappist quads to be sure. The barrel aging does add interesting notes of leather, coconut, faint oak, vanilla, and backgrounded tobacco true to Firestone Walker's claims on the box. But what gets buried by the barrel is the heart of a great quad - the dark fruits. There are appearances of sugarplum and fig, but they don't shine vividly or expressively, and any dates or raisiny notes  get drowned out by the barrel - though the barrel isn't loud and doesn't clash with the beer per se. High sweetness is showcased, lacking the dialed-in characteristics you'd find in a Trappist yeast-fermented quadrupel. More raw than refined, the sweetness needs work.
This suggests a beer intended to cater more to barrel aging fanatics (aka the American audience) than appreciators of tradition, but that's fine - and boy, is that barrel aging interesting.
Aromatic intensity is moderate. No booziness is betrayed, nor are there any off-notes.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Creamy and leathery in both feel and taste, but it's lacking in terms of the delicate fragility you'd find in the very best beers in the style. The leathery feel does play somewhat to the barrel aging's strengths, coaxing out notes of vanilla, oak, and some tobacco - plain and unsubtle though they may be. The coconut from the aroma never appears, and the barrel character isn't horribly deep or intricate, nor is each constituent note particularly vivid or expressive.
Dark fruits are displaced as the heart of the beer by overt sweetness from the turbinado sugar, which does a nice job at imitating Belgian candi sugar but never quite fits the bill wholly. There is some faint buried dark fruit character - mainly plum, but it lacks depth of flavour. This definitely pales in comparison to Trappist quadrupels, and the yeast attenuation seems off. Maybe the sweetness would be quelled with time.
It's smooth and wet but not silky or velvety, and soft on the palate but not to the degree that the best beers in the style are. Full-bodied without being boozy or overbearing, albeit a bit overcarbonated.
The mouthfeel  - like the brewery -  prioritizes the barrel notes over the gestalt whole of the beer, to its detriment.
OVERALL: A quadrupel for fans of barrel aging, Stickee Monkee is far from amongst the best beers in the style, but it does cater neatly to its niche. Traditionalists will find it lacking in many respects (and many will note that its lack of Belgian yeast characteristics and adequate dark fruit notes make it barely a quadrupel at all), and it lacks the astonishing drinkability of Trappist paragons of the style, but many will enjoy its American leanings. At this price point, I'd much sooner reach for a Westvleteren 12 or St. Amatus, but it's nice to see American breweries making the style their own - even when it comes at a cost. Still, #92 in the Top 250? Please...
Does get better as it warms. I'd pour it at cellar temps.

4.01/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours an opaque dark chocolate brown color with mahogany edges and a two finger beige head that quickly settles into a thick, lasting ring.  Surprisingly good retention given it's style and ABV with sporadic streaks of soapy lacing left behind.
Sweet, slightly boozy aroma with a nice barrel character that's decently integrated into the leathery malts, dark fruit and sweet molasses/brown sugar notes of the base.  Charred oak, toasted coconut and vanila bean along with boozy bourbon and brandy sweetness.  Underneath the barrel, there's some leathery tobacco, dark fruit, toffee and caramel.  As it warms the sugar really starts to stand out.
Lighter body than expected and not quite as complex as the nose suggests.  Again, there's a strong barrel presence but it's nicely integrated into the malt, vinous fruit and Mexican sugar flavors.  Strong oak presence with a decent amount of dry char and sweet boozy heat.  Slightly smokey with leathery malts, tobacco and vinous fruit, notably fig, date, raisin and other dark berries. Toffee, caramel and burnt sugar adding more sweetness.  Some boozy heat in the finish but this beer drinks very easy considering the high ABV. 1,177 characterscorby112, Dec 07, 2015

Huge alcohol but not hot and a mellow sweetness that unfortunately increases and becomes a little overwhelming. The alcohol balances it out somewhat but it's not quite enough. As long as you're not taking in the whole bottle yourself, you should be fine. 485 charactersBriken, Dec 02, 2015

7 months since bottling
Appearance- Pours a deep plumb color, brownish black w/ ruby red hues. Fine layer of lighter tan colored head, soapy. Lots of alcohol legs cling to glass, some head lacing too.
Aroma- Rich, sugar. Caramel, molasses, maltiness. Vanilla, toasted coconut, oaky barrel spice. Dark fruits of plum, raisins, figs. Sweet, mellow bourbon.
Taste- Dark fruit sweetness, plum, raisin, cherries. Toasted caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses. Tons of vanilla and toasted coconut. Spicy tobacco, leather, slight barrel char and sweet bourbon notes.
Feel- Full bodied, syrupy and coats the mouth, tons of sweetness. Lower carbonation.
Overall- Barrel adds such a depth of character to the beer, so many different flavors to pull out with each sip. Base beer is very sweet, tons of sugar and rich sweetness. Vanilla and coconut from the barrel marry so well with the base flavors. Charred oak, tobacco, leather, spice, just all add complexity in a great way. A+ in every way. 1,003 charactersOrangeMen, Nov 27, 2015

Taste, nice sweet, insert diabetus jokes if this was a Bruery beer.  Kinda boozy but with all that sweetness, is all good.  I don't know how much of a quad it is, but i like it.  Similar to a Bruery anniversary beer but without the age and leather to it. 388 charactersrodbeermunch, Nov 26, 2015
4.24/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Perhaps just because of this beer's placing on the top ranked list, I expected a little more. The appearance was very promising, very dark brown and mostly opaque with a hint of ruby and a very small, ivory-colored head. Granted, it was much darker than most quads. The nose is delicious with predominate bourbon characteristics: vanilla bean, toasted oak, roasted marshmallow, and slight leathery hints. Now, I've had bourbon barrel aged quads before, but was not expecting what I got in the taste of this one. I'm not even referring to the generally lacking sweet and fruity characteristics of American quads compared to actual Belgian quads. If one could take bourbon—just straight bourbon—and turn it into a beer, this would be it. Unlike many other bbq's, this was not so much a quad with bourbon notes but carbonated bourbon with a very slight quad flavor. Don't get me wrong, I love a good bourbon. But a) I'm not interested in drinking a whole bomber of it, b) if I wanted bourbon, I'd buy bourbon, not a bbq. The mouthfeel was velvety and spectacular. Overall, this was a good beer, though maybe not quite worth all its hype. If you are really in to bourbon, this might become your favorite brew. But if you are looking for something that actually more resembles a quad with slight bourbon notes, I'd suggest Boulevard's BBQ instead. That one is a much more well-rounded version in my opinion. 1,406 characterskhmel, Nov 26, 2015

4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a burnt brown color with purple hues streaming along the side upwards to fill a slim cap of a white little head. As the head died off, lacing stuck around the glass adequately.
The smell had some sweet bourbon, some banana, some nuttiness, a little bit of coffee and cocoa, and then some vanilla all blending together in a warm inviting way.
The taste was mainly sweet with a delicate roastiness from the coffee underneath. A gentle sweet cocoa and bourbon aftertaste slid into the finish.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied. Sticky bourbon clings in the feel, not syrupy but not cloying.
Overall, in my opinion, I liked this quad for me, the coffee notes may be a bit different but hey, let's just say, that's a little bit extra. 784 charactersSitkaSteve, Nov 15, 2015

Poured Dark brown and clear with a large head. Tons of Barrel character, spicy and complex sweetness in the nose. The taste is crazy sweet with a very complex Barrel character. The booze is over the top and delicious. I feel that it is way too sweet to drink right now. It needs some serious time to age out. I'll leave my remaining bottle for a few years.
2016 Vintage served chilled in a snifter
Poured a ruddy brown with a slight khaki head that sank to a rim of foam. The clarity of the beer is awesome. Nose is pure barrel. Toasted marshmallow, coconut, oaky, spicy and sweet alcohol, bourbon, raisins, prunes and complex esters. Taste follows the nose but with a noted sweetness from the Mexican sugars used. There is a very nice and complex spicy character probably coming from the bourbon barrels or the bourbon itself. This is a world class brew. I have another bottle of the 2016 and one remaining 2015 to cellar. I'm blown away. 983 charactersClavisAurea, Nov 04, 2015

Smells like a mix of sweet candy with notes of caramel/toffee, vanilla, figs, raisins paired with malt and bourbon.
Taste is very sweet with  caramel/toffee  fruit notes up front followed by the malt and bourbon with a lingering sweet boozy / warming finish.
Mouthful is medium to heavy and very smooth and rich.  Carbonation is somewhat higher than one would expect from a quad.
An excellent beer that has truly great notes with loads of flavor.  Would love to have this one aged. 556 charactersSlack, Nov 03, 2015

First, we have here a Belgian quad blended with several top-notch bourbons: Woodford reserve, Elijah Craig and Four Roses. It is a deep dark quaff with a subtly sweet nose of bourbon (Natch); the palate receives an intense bombardment of caramel, coffee, malt, pepper and a few spices thrown in. The tongue is simply absorbed in a slathery malt blanket - yet, the body itself is surprisingly light!

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was decadent to drink. Incredibly rich.
Looks like thick maple syrup in the glass with a light khaki foam that doesn't linger much. With each whiff of it I took, I kept thinking of oatmeal cookies. But there was more depth, with some oak and light bourbon spice, as well as figs and dates in abundance.
Impressively, the taste maintains the aromas and even expands on them. Certainly more fig, raisin and date and the bourbon by no means overruns this beer.
Just as its flavor isn't dominated by bourbon, this isn't a boozy monstrosity. The body is thick and sticky and full and creamy and sets up nicely for the light carbonation end palate that showcases the floral, Belgian aspect of the beer. 
This was outstanding in every way. I'm only mad I won't easily find more because I already need more. 813 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 18, 2015

Smells of maple syrup, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, sweet malt, tobacco, Razzles candy, red wine, dark fruit like raisin, plum, dates and rotting pear. Sweet but not over the top with a lot of sweet malt, fruit, citrus hops and light fermented booze like dark rum. So complex I feel like a tornado of aroma is swirling up my nose - really damn impressive.
Tastes of malty sweetness and booze up front, with a wonderful mix of dark fruit like raisin, currants, plum, rotting pear, old red grapes, tobacco, maple syrup, brown sugar, light cinnamon, bread pudding, toffee, light citrus hops and an incredible amount of dense sugary sweetness that works almost perfectly. The barrel aging adds so much flavor that it makes every sip dynamic and delicious.
Mouthfeel is creamy and silky smooth, with a lightly chewy body and feel, mild carbonation and an incredible drinkability considering the high ABV.

Pours a dark reddish brown with just a bit of head. Nose is burnt sugar with some caramel and bourbon. Taste is outstanding. Burnt sugar, bourbon, dried fruit, caramelized sugar, oak, and a bit of alcohol. Full bodied, but smooth. This was excellent overall and one of the most complex beers I've had. Highly recommended. 353 charactersSoCal_Matt, Sep 17, 2015

Look-black in color, best head of any beer over 12% I have ever seen.
Smell-WTF? How did they do this? Sweet Brock's butterscotch candy, bourbon,vanilla and a touch of dried fruit. Absolutely amazing.
Taste is similar to the smell. Bourbon becomes more prominent as the beer warms. Hides the abv well and is super drinkable. A fantastic sipper. This is a wow beer.
Mouthfeel is really nice. I thought this would be cloying due to the intense sweet aromas but it actually moves along nicely. Very impressed for such a big beer.
What can I say. This reminds me more of a stout but who cares. Classify as you want. This is absolutely fantastic. A truly memorable experience. Highly recommended and will seek out again. 789 charactersChrisMon02, Sep 16, 2015

Nose is sweet, dark fruit and bourbon.  Slight burnt caramel comes through.
Flavor is big on bourbon and brown sugar, decent amount of warmth.  Good amount of oak, raisin/prune comes through as well.
Rich, velvety texture.  High viscosity coats the tongue for a long warm sweet finish. 350 charactersoldn00b, Sep 16, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had the delight of both the 2014 and 2015 version of this beer.  The 2014 was draft only at the brewery.  The 2015 I've had both draft at the brewery and bottle.  This is one of my favorite beers which isn't much of a surprise since it is a significant ingredient of Anniversary.  I've heard some people say they don't care for it, but it always seems to be that they don't like sweeter beers.  I personally really like brown sugar, using it as the sweetness of choice for all my asian cooking.
Poured into a 6 oz snifter.
 A: Pours with a very thin head and is very dark, with a delightful ruby-brown color where light is present.
S: Bourbon and brown sugar
T: A complex flavor with layers of sweetness and layers of toasted caramel, some coconut, and a bourbon flavor that is wonderfully rich and mellow.  
F: A silky smooth mixture of little micro-bubbles that seem to want to linger on your tongue to give a longer exposure to the taste.
I think this beer really illustrates the art of taking the base recipe of some style into a completely different space.  It's absolutely amazing!! 1,096 characterstprinzing, Sep 07, 2015

Beer poured dark brown with a smallish head.
Nose was awesome, heavy on the bourbon, sweet and sticky.
Taste had a nice bourbon slant on the initial sips that was extremely drinkable for a beer this size.  Brown sugar took over and started dominating about half way thru the glass.  Finishing at the end of the glass became almost cloying.
Feel was full and smooth.
Overall 8 ounces of a older version is enough.  Next year I hope to find a fresh beer. 538 charactersarizcards, Aug 26, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours basically black as night as it hits the glass, this beer is thick as molasses. A small head forms and is gone quickly, leaving only alcohol legs as you drink it down the glass. In the glass, the body of the beer is just slightly off-black with some brown and just a touch of red in there.The wisp of tan foam on the top edges of the beer make this beer look like a stout in my snifter.
S- Sweet brown sugar and booze greet the nose right up front with a strong punch to the nostrils. In the middle of the smell there is a bang of dark malts and barrel flavors that darken up the initial sweetness. Light char, sweet brown sugar, and sweet vanilla all intermingle to make a very enticing overall scent for the beer.
T- The sweetness that kicks off the smell of this beer also kicks off the taste as it hits the tongue with a very molasses-like flavor. The brown sugary sweetness darkens up quickly with the addition of semi-burnt malts and barrel char. The char mellows out in the middle of the drink and bleeds into subtle vanilla sweetness and a drying oak flavor. The lingering flavor of this beer on the tongue is a balance of sweetness, dark barrel flavors, and slightly bitter malts and booze.
M- Thick as molasses is the best way to describe this beer when it hits your tongue. There is a very low level of carbonation, which enhances the smoothness and thickness of the beer. The alcohol level of this beer is barely noticeable on the palate due to the sweetness and weight of the beer, but it definitely warms as it goes down.
Overall, this is a freaking delicious beer and I can see why it has been a part of the Firestone Walker blending program. The sweetness is a little strong, but with the recent spell of cooler weather, that is just fine with me. The beer really displays a good complexity that I have only seen in a few other beers. If you like sweeter, darker beers that display a good amount of barrel without being in-your-face, this beer is right up your alley. 1,995 charactersboilermakerbrew, Aug 21, 2015

Great after dinner sipper.   F:  Perfect, nice and thick.  One of the best beers I've ever had.  Only one of the proprietor's vintage I've had and hope I can get my hands on more. 281 charactersJ_Mueller, Aug 14, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Batch #2 - 2015 vintage.  22oz. bottle served in a burgundy stem.  Pours a dull mahogany hue with a creamy, khaki-colored head embedded with tiny pinpricks.  Nose expresses toffee and spirits as well as a trace of banana.  Taste consistent with nose; however, much bolder, with the addition of burnt sugar, a hint of coconut and a distinct ethanol presence at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and some ethanol heat.  Overall, a wonderful beer with some definite cellaring potential.  I have to see what 3-5 years does to this gem.  That said, closer to an American Strong than a Quad in my opinion. 638 charactersJwale73, Aug 05, 2015

Nose is loaded with dried fruit and toffee, burnt caramel and sweet bourbon. Barrel aging comes through nicely alongside loads of raisins and toffee. Candied sugar, boozy bourbon and oak notes.  Insanely drinkable, incredibly smooth and the ABV is dangerously hidden.  Superb. 355 charactersandrenaline, Aug 04, 2015

Chocolate and cherries to the nose first off.  Plum, spent grain, and burnt sugar are noticed later on.  Tastes of sweet chocolates and plenty of dark fruits such as plum, black grape and raisin. Brown sugar coats the palate toward the end.  Complex and big but not heavy and never too hot either.  
Many times FW's bigger brews come off as too rich for me, but this one is just right. 475 charactersstephens101, Aug 01, 2015

Dense and fluffy ivory colored head rests nicely on top. Rich aromas raisin and brown sugar fill the nose. As the aroma would suggest, this one is quite sweet. Flavors showing fruity and vanilla characters seem to pop, but the slight woodiness and heat from the barrels balance things out a tad. Viscous and full bodied but quite smooth as it goes down. Overall, a nice long sipper for a quiet evening and a great dessert beer. 492 charactersKinsman, Jul 22, 2015

4.86/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.757/16/16 2016 vintage. From bottle at home. Serving temp was far from ideal as it was too cold so I had to let it sit. Perhaps it was still too cold, but there was little nuance. It was merely a really good barley wine. Not the usual distinct layers I've come to know & love from FW. Luckily, through perseverance, I was able to surmount the 1 bottle ration & have another to compare. But if it doesn't really wow me, I'm going to have to re-evaluate my blind trust in The Stickee.
7/16/15 On tap at Coopers, Chelsea, NYC. This is it. If I had access to this whenever I wanted I would be a very a happy man. 
The look is hard to judge because it is a deep mahogany to ruby port in color. Head is limited to a slight ring around the edge.
Now to the essence. The aroma is so complex it becomes a distraction..almost. since one cannot separate the aroma from the taste (the mouth is under the nose for a reason...don't go crazy, so is a dogs & they'll eat anything...without chewing) you'll have a better time by just savoring this & worry about everything...& I mean EVERYTHING else later.
Just let the flavors enrobe you. They will. That's by design.
This is simply one of the best beers I've ever had. 1,206 charactersseedyone, Jul 16, 2015

A: Black body with brown highlights and a solid cap of tan foam. Good retention, spotty lace. Quite nice.
S: Rich, decadent bourbon sweetness. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Not terribly complex, just sweet and enjoyable.
T: Follows the nose - sweet caramel, toffee, vanilla, dark fruit, and bourbon. Candied raisin, brown sugar. Long, sweet finish. Borderline cloying, but enjoyable nevertheless.
M: Thick and stick, but with just enough carbonation to keep the overall impression more  luxurious than self-loathing.
O: Thoroughly tasty, but more like liquid caramel fudge than a beer of any recognizable style. I enjoyed it, and can't imagine that anyone wouldn't enjoy it as well, but it didn't impress me as much as some other BA FW's.
Cheers! 781 characterswoosterbill, Jun 30, 2015

A- pours dark brown, nearly black color with a small creamy khaki-colored head that reduces to just a ring around the edge, no lacing 
S- big boozy notes of caramel, caramalized brown sugar, fig, raisin, leather & tobacco.  Barrel notes gives aromas of oak, toasted coconut, walnut, bourbon & a hint of vanilla
T- huge hit of malty sweetness up front gives loads of dark fruit flavors, including raisin, fig & black cherry.  Belgian candied sugar/caramalized brown sugar follows the fruit, along with notes of tobacco, leather & toasted walnut.  Molasses like sweetness brings in the barrel notes, with flavors of toasted wood, coconut, vanilla & a hint of bourbon.  Sweet malty finish with some earthy notes & a hint of alcohol on the linger 
M- medium-heavy body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a hint of foam on the mouthfeel and an oily chewy finish 
O- drinks like a English barleywine/quad hybrid.  Tons of dark fruit and malt, the barrel aging plays a supporting role, rather than dominating, very good 1,061 charactersTreyliff, Jun 28, 2015
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Quick review:
Poured deep brown with very little head.  Smell was sugary (candi and brown) and the barrel time was very present on the nose.  Taste was sweet, but the barrel was subdued a bit.  The sugars refined themselves and there were notes of dark fruits coming through.  The carbonation was very minimal on this and the feel was as smooth as one could find I would venture.
All in all, a fantastic sipper. Took me over an hour to clear my glass (my portion of a 22 oz bottle), and I enjoyed it the entire time. 518 characterspolloenfuego, Jun 28, 2015

A: Dark brown with ruby edges, tan colored head, some slight carbonation, no head retention, no lacing, looks like a coke.
A: Bourbon, sweet toffee, vanilla aromas,alcohol is barely noticeable, lots of bourbon.
T: Lots of bourbon with heat, toffee, vanilla, sweet fruits, not getting much quad characteristics, very sweet, brown sugar really comes through, finishes dry.
M: Kind of on the thin side, dry finish.
O: My first thought in the aroma and taste was Double DBA, this beer lacks a lot of quad characteristics, not that it is a bad tasting beer, it's really good, but I was expecting something more like Trappist Rochefort 10, bourbon really dominates with slight quad aromas and flavors, will cellar a few bottles to see if the bourbon recedes and allows other flavors to come up front.
After 6 months in my cellar, the bourbon has not receded but the sweetness has subsided allow for more dark fruit notes to come forward, it's very smooth and drinkable, has an amazing mouthfeel, more of the yeast characteristic also comes forward. 1,090 charactersBrolo75, Jun 27, 2015

Taste is also very similar... Bourbon and residual sweetness is prevalent. The subtle Belgian ale flavors hide beneath. Alcohol is well hidden as usual. Overall I very much enjoyed it. However, it's in the lower half of FW's barrel aged offerings IMO. Parabola, DDBA, Sucaba, and PNC being on top. 396 charactersLADaveBN, Jun 22, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a clear, shiny brown with rust/red highlights.  Strong ruby/garnet highlights when held to the light.  Very little head which vanishes immediately.  Head was cream colored for the 2 seconds it lasted.  Moderate amount of fine lacing when the glass is swirled.  Lacing is like the head as it vanishes quickly.
Aroma is sweet, rich, and a bit boozy.  Brown sugar, toffee, charred oak, whiskey, and dark molasses.  Very strong but well balanced.  No one thing dominates. 
Taste follows the aroma but with even more complexities and subtleties.  Big notes of  brown sugar, toffee, and molasses to start.  Sweet but not syrupy.  Barrel character comes next.  Light charred oak and whiskey.  Some leather and vanilla.  Back end subtleties abound.  Anise, dark plum, overripe cherry, honey, fig, dates.  A bit of alcohol booziness spread throughout.
Thick and oily mouth feel.  Low carbonation.  I could see how some would find it syrupy but for me it doesn't go that far.  A bit boozy.  Flavors linger on the tongue, a changing array of both the more prominent notes mixed with the subtleties.
This is an outstanding barrel aged beer.  FW never lets me down.  Big, complex flavors.  Some booziness but easier to drink than the abv might lead you to believe.  Some reviews make this out to be more of a barleywine, and while I do understand why, this is definitely a quad to me. 1,381 charactersleroybrown10, Jun 20, 2015

The cola element is quite complex.  And you do feel the alcohol.  I was pleasantly surprised to find this bottled and available at my close by liquor store.  I had only had it on draft on two other occasions.  This beer is not for everyone.  If you want any bitterness, look someplace else.  My posts will tend to talk about food pairing and I planned to have this beer some dinner when I was having breakfast for dinner.  I served this with habanero scrambled eggs, homemade buttermilk biscuits and smoked sausage.  Good food pairing.  I would also serve this with fried chicken and waffles.  I want some sweeter food to go with this beer and I need some food for the alcohol to land on!  I am going to track down some more for aging.  A few years on this might just be magical. 874 charactersfishyakLA, Jun 19, 2015

It smells like a great barleywine (not a quad), with plenty of dark fruit, brown sugar, and vanilla. The taste is similar - think Sucaba with more dark fruit. Actually, a LOT more dark fruit. Stickee is right: this is a sweet, slick feeling brew, though the oak tannins give the palate some breathing room. A rock solid barleywine, but it doesn't live up to the hype. Personally, I think it's just too sweet - 4 oz is perfect for me.

A clear dark brown with a thin, light brown head that falls off to a ring, this looks decent. The nose is quite excellent. Bug brown sugar, dark fruit,  some Belgian yeast spiciness,  Honey, dark toffee, s little bit of burnt sugar, a moderate bready, grainy malt backbone, this is deep. Vanilla, bourbon, a little coconut are present. 
The palate opens sweet with brown sugar, booze, vanilla, coconut, a real bready note - dark wheat and pumpernickel like. Caramel, toffee, honey. Boozy, warming alcohol heat is present. Mildly spicy on the finish with bourbon, Belgian yeast and caramel, this beer it's full bodied, creamy and delicious. The spice and the booze keep this not super drinkable, but this is a pretty well crafted barrel aged ale. 763 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 07, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Very good but as a Quad drinker (a true Quad drinker) this is far to sweet. I am a huge Firestone Walker fan i own and have drank every single one of the vintage series from FW. But this one is more of a hype beer for me.  But as many of you know everyones taste buds os different and this is just my opinion. Still a great beer but the sweetness kills it for me. 363 charactersMattygross44, Jun 02, 2015

The smell was amazing, with lots of raisin, sweet caramel, bourbon, oak, and toffee. The taste was equally great, with the raisins, vanilla, caramel and bourbon melding into a super tasting brew. Surprisingly, I didn't get a lot of heat from the bourbon, just the great flavor. The mouthfeel was super smooth, with a nice medium body. Overall, I have to say this is one of the best beers I've ever had, so glad to have been able to find one. 540 characterstimontheroad, May 31, 2015

Great smelling beer, Great color. the taste is sweet but not overly so with tons of bourbon and so much more, a very rich creamy mouthful. I can not recommend this beer  highly enough. I just wish I had lifetime supply. All lovers of good beer need to give this beer a chance please your tastebuds. 420 charactersmaxifunk777, May 29, 2015

Review #1025
The medium bodied, mahogany colored liquid was topped by a small, bubbly, khaki colored crown that quickly dropped to a thin ring of bubbles.
Maple and brown sugar notes dominated in the aroma. Quite sweet. Loads of bourbon. Perhaps a bit fusel-like. Toffee and caramel were noticeable as well. Good amount of oak/barrel character. There was also a slight fruitiness. As the beer warmed, the nose became much punchier and more interesting.
Like the aroma, the flavor profile was rich and robust. Loads of sweet brown sugar, caramel and toffee. Some maple syrup as well. Pleasantly boozy and surprisingly not at all hot.  Fairly drinkable for a beer that clocks in at 13.4% ABV. Bourbon notes were quite apparent. Noticeable fruity esters. The beer finished moderately oaky and slightly dry with notes of wood and tannins. With time, some of this beer's alcohol prowess came forth.
The beer was medium bodied for the style and contained a very fine and mellow effervescence. Super soft, smooth and supple on the palate. Fluffy. After each sip, the liquid left a sticky film on my lips.
Although not super complex, Stickee Monkey is a really smooth drinking, tasty, bourbon-forward beer. However, classifying this as a Belgian Quad seems a bit silly, as there was no Belgian character whatsoever. I would probably describe this simply as an American strong ale. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable offering that reminds me of a more intense yet less interesting version of the Firestone Walker anniversary releases. 1,652 charactersDamian, May 20, 2015

Has a nice firestone walker aroma of toasted oak, coconut, some vanilla cream, dark caramel, burnt sugar, some graham cracker.  Overall a very barrel heavy aroma.  
On the palate it is a bit thin and fizzy, flavors are not carried out to their richest potential.  A lot of burnt sugars and toasted barrel.
To my memory, this fresh was incredible, not sure if this is an off bottle. 419 characterstimc100, May 16, 2015

The olfactory is greeted with a huge sweetness and that classic coconuty Firestone barrel character with some graham cracker and vanilla. Cherry
and caramel.
Flavor has some alcohol warmth to kind of balance the massive sweetness I guess. Super rich malty character with caramel and toffee and molasses from the turbinado. Bourbon, vanilla, oak. Super smooth with a creamy medium body. 
I need to brush my teeth. 501 charactersMattSweatshirt, Apr 13, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2014
OG: 30.17 p 
IBU: 22
Aged 9-14 months in barrels
APPEARANCE: Sienna brown pour yields a 1 ½ finger, looser, fizzy, crackly light tan head with lousy retention. Clear maroon brown with lower levels of carbonation evident. A ring remains until the end but leaves no real lacing down the glass. Nice body but a lousy head. Kind of evens out. 
SMELL: Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark caramel, raisins and various dark fruits, brown sugar and leather on the nose. Mighty complex and interesting. 
TASTE: Oak and bourbon up front with toffee sweetness and raisins as well. Some heat and wood at the swallow with a big and lingering finish of bourbon, oak, more vanilla and cream, toffee sweetness, dark fruits and raisins. Quite sweet and malty for sure, but a good dose of the barrel components as well. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, a little lighter than hoped perhaps, goes down okay with a scratch at the back of the throat and finishes rather sticky. They weren’t kidding there. Some heat lingers. 
OVERALL: Really nice. This is certainly a very sweet beer with a massive OG and only 22 IBU, so it might not be for everyone. The people I shared it with all found it to be too much. I love me some malt bombs though, especially if it’s got a good barrel component to go along with it, and this one certainly delivered in both departments. Lots of good flavor and a big feel to go with it. The head could use a little work, but whatever. Thanks again ScottO. Enjoyed this one. 1,630 charactersJeffo, Mar 18, 2015

Pours a darker colored big bubbled small fizzy like head that fades at a med pace but only hits a really small head covering, little lacing but long sliding legs down the sides, thick layering of beer on the sides of the glass, super dark molasses brown with very very little light getting through at all.
Nose is awesome, lots of dark malts, toasted brown malts and caramel, molasses, a little cocoa, lots of caramelized dark malts, caramel fudge, little nougat, molasses candies, etc, with some soft aging malt with hints of dark fruits, candied raisin fig like, and just a touch of booze with some esters. Also in there is nice barrel notes, a little bourbon, nice vanilla smooth rounding, etc. Candied raisin really explodes as it warms.
Taste brings quite a bit of sweetness out front, with tons of layered dark malts, etc. Dark malts with lots of varying levels of caramel, faint cocoa and fluffy nougat, little fudgey too, more like caramel fudge. WIth that is the big candy aspects, molasses all over, candi sugar and caramelized brown sugars and malts, everything caramelized, etc. Booze is there for sure, maybe not 13% but strong, with a little phenolic character. Malts also bring a layering effect of different dark malts, with the soft aged malt, layered with the sweetness. Then fruits, lots of dark fruits, tons of candied raisin and fig juice, candied dark fruits, etc. with a little molasses condensed fruit thing. Mild barrel notes, plenty of vanilla with a mild bourbon juice, not a ton though as it's drowned by the sweet malts and candied fruit. Finish is surprisingly dry and mild booze warmth, lingering fudgey caramel and molasses, with candied fruits.
Mouth is full thick bod, little fudgey and syrupy, decent carb, some booze.
Overall very nice, so much great characters, but hard to drink much of it since it's so sweet and boozy. def a winter sipper so glad I didn't wait until it was warmer out. Also wish the barrel came through a bit more, but I def like the vanilla and aging effect it has. 2,102 charactersjlindros, Mar 12, 2015

Velvety and slightly hot from the high ABV with flavors of vanilla up front and the burbon-toffee finish.  Sugar is present but less pronounced than fresh bottles/pours.  Aging well. 281 charactersYby1acb, Feb 18, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52014 version. Pour is a thick brownish-black. It will be a little surprising for a Quad fan. Head forms only around the sides, but securely. Aroma is a deep bourbon-y vanilla--I inhaled several times before consuming. Feel is purely robust, with barrel sweetness dominating the taste. It's so rich, a slow drink is required, if you happen to consuming all 22 oz. alone. While both being different styles, I find the overall feel and taste to be a mix of BCBS and Backwoods Bastard. Overall, a unique pleasure to drink. 518 charactersBuccoFan, Feb 07, 2015

Dark, but not as dark as a stout, with the sweet smell of caramel and bourbon. The taste is amazing, sweet, bourbon-y, with that Firestone Walker-like barrel feel that I cannot describe. The alcohol is undetectable (at least it was for me, but I was well in my cups by the time I had this).
Awesome stuff. 456 charactersMarius, Jan 25, 2015

Aroma is really complex with lots of caramel, fudge, bourbon, brown sugar and oak. Taste starts with caramel and brown sugar, a slight molasses note, bourbon and finishes slightly bitter. Medium body, quite sticky and syrupy, low carbonation. A really complex beer with nice dried fruits, bourbon and barrel character. 353 charactersCiocanelu, Jan 25, 2015

a: Clear dark ruby with an inch tall tan head which receded fairly quickly to thin surface foam and sparse lacing.
s; Bourbon.
t; Bourbon over lush dark fruit.  Boozy finish.
m: Full and very smooth.  Significant carbonation tingle.  
o; A wonderful sipper, a rival for BCBS.  Different of course because it's a Quad with some dark fruit undertones instead of roasty malt, but in both cases the bourbon flavor dominates beautifully. 513 charactersscotorum, Jan 16, 2015

4.48/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer was black with bubbles crowning the sides of the glass. 
Smell - The aroma smelled of barrel aged bananas.
Taste - My first impression is bananas and booze. There is some oakiness in the taste. The alcohol has some bite, which fades by the aftertaste. This is where is the malts come to the front. 
Mouthfeel - The quad is smooth enough to mask the high alcohol content.
Overall - I do not like this one as much as Sucaba, but FW still did a darn good job here. 487 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 02, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let's cut to the chase: for a bourbon barrel-aged quad, it doesn't get better. This may be my favorite beer of 2014, and by far the best barrel-aged beer of the year. 
Appearance is like a stout. Thin, creamy ring of head around the edge of the glass. Black. In the right light there are hues of garnet. 
Aroma is fantastic. At first I think chocolate cake. Chocolate, vanilla, malt. The bourbon barrel-aging comes right through, as well -- more vanilla, bourbon, oak. There's caramel and toffee. Slight banana, in the banana cream pie sense. 
Taste is equally fantastic. Remnants of something akin to a quad (the dark fruit) are mixed in with milk chocolate, vanilla, oak, cake batter. Sweet, but not cloying. 
Mouthfeel is on point: thick, full, and chewy, but like I said, not cloying. This is the perfect beer for the cold La Jolla winter I'm enduring (the eye-rolling from those in practically anywhere else in the United States are drowned out by another slow sip). 
Overall: This is the best bourbon barrel-aged quad I've ever had. If you're a big fan of quads, don't look to this as being similar. I don't get any Belgian yeast (I don't think FW even used a Belgian yeast for this -- one article said it was an English ale yeast, making this a...barleywine?). However, if you enjoy barrel-aged beers, this is an absolute must. 
Five out of five. 1,359 characterscxr1037, Dec 30, 2014

Aroma with notes of chocolate, mild smoke, intense wood, lots of molasses, bourbon and nuts. I was expecting heavy booze which didn't come out.
Flavor with notes of molasses (tons of it), plums, caramels, cherries, oak, coconut, red grapes, candied sugar, vanilla, elegant tobacco and fig jam. Dry aftertaste with a lingering sweet note.
Full body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 13.4% abv is incredibly well hidden.

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%We had this beer at Sublime Ale House on tap during San Diego Beer Week.  Love the name!  Stickee Monkee...  
A - Clear dark dark amber, small light beige head that settled down to a nice skim.
S - Belgian nose with light caramel and dark sugars, wonderful  barrel aromas of toasted oak, woody vanilla, marshmallow, light whiskey notes, and char.
T -  Oh my!  Wonderful sweetness with light sticky sugar and molasses supported by caramel and sugar dates.  The barrel flavors temper the sweetness enough that it never becomes cloying.  Mellow whiskey flavor brings some balance. Toasted oak. Marshmallow. No bitterness and a nice oak, vanilla and whiskey finish.
M - Full body that's thick & rich.  Light carbonation and a coating mouth feel that's pleasant. 
O - Stickee Monkee indeed!  Well done - a very drinkable quad that would make a wonderful sipper on a cold night or as a desert beer.  I really like this one. 922 charactersFlyingBull, Nov 15, 2014

O-A really good quad.  One of the few that deviates from the "primarily dark fruits" profile. Rather yummy. 337 charactersrlee1390, Nov 13, 2014

Very little carbonation and the beer is completely opaque save for the edges. The nose is quite amazing. I got brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, vanilla, a hint of roastiness, and dark fruits. The taste is vanilla bourbon with a prominent sweetness and subtle hints of fruitiness. The finish is full and smooth as could be. Next to no carbonation leaves a heavy mouthfeel and a thickness to the body. It's a definite sipper but more than worth the experience. 543 charactersPSU_Mike, Nov 03, 2014

L: super-dark brown, clear, with the deepest orange, almost ruby red highlights... khaki-colored, messy foam that begins a rising high, but soon recedes like white caps, leaving behind a tentative sticky scab, at first... later wallflowerin' it
S: explosive intensity of aromas... German chocolate cake, vanilla coffee, subtle spices... the booze factors in - opens the nasal passages - but it's fairly easy to tell a murky cauldron of sweet nothings lurks below... note: by the middle of the second glass, you can't smell a thing, let alone feel your nose
T: remarkable lusciousness and rich layers of dark sugars, unfolding and expanding    vinous burst of sand-blasted booze on the tail end that combines with the residual sugars to leave a strong raisin flavor lingering up front in the palate while the tonic esters hold court toward the back... barrel character takes over by the second glass
F: somewhere in between a dense Scotch ale and the most viscous of Imperial stout... the use of dark adjunct sugars is apparent with the sleazy-sexy quality of its semi-slick, syrupy texture... the alcohol provides superfine balance, making the finish seem eerily comforter-soft and dry... fair, but bitty bit of tiny bubbles to keep things poppin'
O: more like a beer-aged barrel... this brewery hits the mark too much... they seem to have a distinct flavor to their barrel-aged beers, and it's intoxicating (not to mention, the beer)... if you like expertly-crafted, strong, malty beers, you may commit crimes-against-humanity for this one... most certainly an engaging sensory tussle... happy birthday to me! 1,664 charactersBouleboubier, Oct 30, 2014

Appearance:  A hard pour into the sniffer produces a short-lived inch of foam that leaves some dots on the side of the glass; the liquid is root beer-colored and translucent
Smell:  Bourbon barrel tones intermingle with brown sugar cookie dough, nuts and caramel
Taste:  The brown sugar cookie dough flavor brings sugary sweetness to the taste receptors at the front of the tongue, with the Bourbon tones building, along with the caramel and the nut aspects, in the middle; hot and sticky, after the swallow
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation; considerable warmth in the gullet (not surprising given the high ABV)
Overall:  I am not going to touch the quad/English barleywine debate on this beer but will just look at it on its merits; for all the malt and barrel treatment here, the beer lacks the complexity, in my view, to merit the high scores that it has achieved; some of the scoring has to do with the brewer's reputation and, while this is a good sipper, it is not among Firestone Walker's best; it might be interesting to see how this ages once the heat diminishes 1,113 charactersbrentk56, Oct 26, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +2%The beer comes in a light murky copper.
The aroma has the signature complex Firestone barrel aroma of vanilla, oak, caramel sweetness, but generally surrounded by dripping dark dried fruit.
The flavor follows with that burst of plums, dates, and raisins up front along with caramelized brown sugar. The beer is quite sweet, but that Firestone oak character dries out the beer. The beer tastes nothing towards 13+% and is dangerously drinkable. 445 charactersdar482, Oct 24, 2014

A: The color lies at the point where the darkest shades of brown become black. No head and no sign of meaningful carbonation on the pour. Rings of lacing as thin as a pencil line trace the glass momentarily before they break up and slide back down into the beer.
S: Molasses fudge, chocolate truffles, molasses, caramel chews, brown sugar and burnt sugars, quick whiff of chocolate covered cherries. Mouth-watering barrel aromas of toasted oak, woody vanilla, marshmallow, coconut shavings, and some tame whiskey notes.
T: Sweetness is deep and rich. Sticky molasses predominates. Chocolate-caramel chews and hints of chocolate truffles. Burnt sugars. Sugar dates. Barrel flavors temper the sweetness enough that it never becomes cloying. Mellow whiskey brings some tingling heat. Toasted oak. Marshmallow. Sweet and lingering finish of molasses and some oaky vanilla and whiskey.
M: Thick and rich in body. Very syrupy and sticky in texture. Little to no carbonation means that the weight of it presses down on the tongue, and it is allowed to really coat the mouth. 
O: It's amazing that a beer this rife with residual sweetness is even drinkable. True to its name, this is one big and sticky sipping beer. The well-rounded barrel character distracts the palate away from all the sweetness enough to keep it from going over the edge. They bill this as a 'Central Coast Quad', but if you are expecting anything resembling the Trappist classics such as Rochefort 10 or Chimay Grande Reserve, you will be completely confounded. It comes across more as a huge, sticky barleywine. In the past this beer was used only for blending purposes, and with its ridiculous sweetness it's not hard to see why. However, this is one of the rare instances in which a blending beer can stand on its own two feet, even if it is teetering on the edge of drinkability. Brinksmanship at its finest. 1,916 charactersryan1788a5, Oct 19, 2014

A slight kiss of bourbon is present across the back. The taste is reminescent of raison and plum. Caramel and toffee round things out with a yeasty spiciness. This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. A fine sipper and good representation of a barrel aged quad. Id drink it again if the opportunity presented itself. 523 charactersstakem, Oct 15, 2014

4.37/5  rDev -2%From 10/09/14 notes. 10 oz pour in a flute-ish glass at The Jeffrey in NYC as part of their 1 year anniversary party. Been wanting to try this one for awhile, missing it at EBF 2 years ago.
Pours a deep mahogany brown color with a reddish tint, less than an inch of medium tan head and low to moderate carbonation evident. Caramel malts, toasted malts, coconut, toffee, light sweet dark fruits, oak, bourbon, and light smoke. Medium body and low carbonation, no heat at all.
Overall great; tastes like a BA barleywine, like a less hot Sucaba, and nothing like a Quad in my opinion. Does not taste 13.4% ABV at all, super smooth. Bourbon is sweet and delicious, as is all the caramel and toffee. Would love to get a bottle of it. 730 charactersmdfb79, Oct 10, 2014

Second bottle, first full review, 7/10/2015.  Pours a dark copper, small head, not much lacing.  Smells awesome, lots of malt, raisins , molasses, some bourbon, some oak.  Taste continues the malt and raisins.  Also toffee, figs, plums, dates, caramel, bourbon, oak, vanilla.  Whew.  A little sweet.  Great stuff.  Smooth, great body, lingers on the tongue.
This is even better than the first bottle, which I had about nine months ago.  Just a sensational beer, satisfying in every category.  I feel lucky to have been able to buy this. 575 charactersstortore, Sep 27, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +8.7%This is a quad to measure all quads by. Very American in nature, not like the belgians, so its kind of its own category. 
Pours a dark brown with little head. Residue sticks the the glass when swirled. 
Smell is of old barrels and ripe dark fruit. Very intriguing really. I get some strawberry and dates, with some smoke and oak.
Taste is superb. Rich beyond words, with a sticky sweetness right up front. Heavy on the dark fruits, and low on hops. Vanilla and caramel / toffee. Bourbon is there as well. Nicely blended.
Feel is low carbed with a viscous mouthfeel.
Overall I like this quad just as much as FW's  sucaba and parabola. Cheers! 646 charactersBastardKing24, Sep 23, 2014

A:  Pours a reddish deep brown with one finger beige head that settled fairly quickly to a thin ring. Very minimal lacing.
S:  Brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, caramel, bourbon, and dark fruits.
T:  Lots of bourbon heat up front combined with caramel, toffee, and mix of stone fruits.
M:  Medium body and fairly lightly carbonated.  Perhaps a bit thinner than I was expecting but not in a bad way.
O:  Although this one blurs the lines a bit between a barrel aged Barleywine and a Quad, it is clearly a fantastic beer.  Look forward to finding another bottle. 625 charactersrichj1970, Sep 22, 2014

Bottle
Appearance: Very dark-brown with a reddish hue with a small light beige head that slowly faded to a ring.
Smell: Browns sugar/toffee, mild Bourbon,  mild vanilla, and faint dark fruit notes. 
Taste: Brown sugar notes feature prominently followed by mild bourbon, toffee, vanilla, mild oak, , and some faint dark fruit notes. The beer is fairly sweet up front but the finish is reasonably dry with tannic oak notes present in the end. Very restrained alcohol presence
Mouth-feel: Medium bodied with a modest level of carbonation. Very nice.
Overall: When I first had this beer at the 2010 Pizza Port  Strong Ale Festival it was classified as an English barleywine.  Call it Central Coast Quad or whatever else, to me it is a very good Bourbon bal-aged malt-centered beer.  Sweet but with enough complexity to not be cloying in the least. 861 charactersIKR, Sep 21, 2014

4.35/5  rDev -2.5%On tap at the FW Tasting Room – Paso Robles
Served in a FW Tasting snifter glass – 08/16/2014
A:  Pours much darker than I had expected nearing a walnut color with some plumy tones that gives an almost maroon like appearance.  Dense in the glass with a thinning at the edge allowing for more light to pass through.  Has an almost a flat appearance with virtually no head or any stick minus a few alcohol legs.
S:  Smells of sweet toffee, baked bread, and candy nougat with some caramelized fig.  Lots of plumy dark fruits and scorched sugars actually.  I get wafts of toasty oak by way of vanilla and light coconut. Followed up with some restrained banana esters and a few select kitchen spices.  Alcohol is present yet surprisingly mellow.  Very nice and inviting.  
T:  Flavors exceed the nose quite a bit with a mélange of kettled malt sugars and spent oak barrels.  I get sweet toffee nougat, dark crusty bread, dried fig, and cherries smothered in golden treacle.  Light tannins integrate a vanilla crème and toasted coconut element that works impeccably well here.  There is just a slight suggestion of earthy minerals and banana with allspice but the Belgian character barely manages to surface amidst all the sugars.  Really well balanced with some reigned in bitterness and alcohol heat.  Very good and not like any Quad ever experienced.
M:  Thick and chewy while countered by a nice drying at the finish and some mild alcohol warmth.  Seems a lower amount of carbonation gives it more of that sticky syrup like thickness.  Finishes out a touch on the wetter side however.
D:  Another fine fireside sipper from the Proprietor’s Vintage series with its full malt body, high ABV, and layers of barrel aged complexity. Signature FW barreling at work here with those lovely vanilla and toasted coconut components.  With such a mild Belgian yeast presence however this drinks more like an English Barleywine.  In fact I would prefer this over the Sucaba.  Damn just another wallet thumper to add in my lineup. 2,027 charactersNugganooch, Sep 18, 2014

Thanks to KevSal for sending this one my way!
A: Pours a very dark mahogany, nearly opaque, with less than 1/2 a fingers width of light tan had that dissipates quickly.  Leaves essentially no lacing, but does leave some alcohol legs. 4
S: Tons of sweetness with a lot of old ale/English barleywine notes.  Heavy characters of caramel and toffee, nutty, candied sugar.  Some boozy ethanol as well.  I then get some bourbon notes with charred oak and a subtle peat character.  Barrel notes are fainter than I anticipate for a Firestone Walker beer, but there is a great balance of sweetness, barrel notes, and balancing booze.  Wonderful, although honestly not a lot of Belgium quad characters.  4.75
T: Deliciously and wonderfully sweet.  Like the nose its loaded with the old ale characters of toffee, caramel and candied sugar.  Some burnt sugar bitterness.  Barrel characters are more prevalent in the taste than the aroma with lots of charred oak, and bourbony-booze. There are some bready Belgium yeast notes on the finish, which is pretty much the other indication that this is a quad.  Does become a touch boozy at time, but still geat.  4.5
M/D: Full bodied, ABV is noticeable, bordering on but not quite hot going down. A bit syrupy at times, but all things considered drinkability is very good. 4
O:  Excellent beer.  Not sure I'd classify it as a Quad, but thats ok, I loved it. Definitely recommend you seek this one out, particularly if you have an affinity for sweet boozy beers. 4.75

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%Enjoyed out of a 22 oz brown bomber with a paper-enclosed crown and the vintage marked clearly on the front of the label: 2014. Poured into an 33 oz snifter.
Appearance (3.75) - Pours a rich walnut brown that approaches black. Only in the right light can you see lighter brown characteristics, but it's dark enough that you can't really see any translucence in the liquid. Atop the body is a brown sugar colored head of just under a finger that dissipates quickly to leave a small ring around the edges of the glass and some larger soapy-looking bubbles clustered on one portion of the surface. Lacing is all but nonexistent, with just a couple of spots placed randomly around the glass.
Smell (4.5) - There are few beer smells more recognizable than that distinctive Firestone Walker house aroma. I'm sure a lot of it comes from the barrels they use, but perhaps there is more to it--like the yeast strain. At any rate, notes of coconut, bourbon, caramel and molasses are all present, as with many FW barrel-aged beers. But beyond that there are hints of dark fruit, like fig and dates, as well as some spiciness--maybe clove. But those hints are not as forward as you would expect in a Belgian quad.
Taste (4.25) - Here many of the same elements are present as in the smell, with caramel and molasses being the strongest alongside some nice vanilla undertones and faint bourbon--less than in the aroma. The dark fruit and spice are more detectable here, however, with strong notes of fig and clove with subtle hints of banana-like esters.
Mouthfeel (4.0) - Medium-bodied and slightly viscous, with moderate-to-low carbonation and a slightly silky feel on the tongue and a lingering sweetness.
Overall (4.25), another fantastic barrel-aged beer from Firestone Walker. It's not my favorite of the portfolio, but I like the fact that it brings a slightly different perspective, with quintessential characteristics of traditional Belgian quads. 1,947 charactersLambicPentameter, Sep 08, 2014

Dark fruit up front, then a surprising transition to cocoa, toffee, mild oak and vanilla.  Begins like a quad, ends like an English barleywine.

A - Stellar looking beer. Dark khaki head towers over a thick black-mahogany body.
S - Smooth and sweet with bananas, caramel, vanilla, and molasses.
T - Outrageous.  It's one of those beers that makes you raise your eyebrows before you finish the first sip.    Thick, creamy caramelized bananas foster is loaded throughout the profile.  Cocoa, molasses, vanilla, and chocolate milk shake ebb and weave throughout each sip.
M - Chewy, smooth, full body.  
O - Net sweet, but extraordinarily well put together.  Firestone Walker's Proprietor's Vintage Series is simply outstanding, and Stickee Monkee pulls it's weight in what I would argue is the best signature series in brewing. 854 charactersvfgccp, Sep 05, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%Thanks to JimN8916 for pointing me towards possibly the last bottle of Monkee sitting on the shelves of great San Diego: since I had a bit at a tasting, have been lusting after a full pour. 22 oz. bottle reluctantly shared with my wife. She’s lucky she’s hot. 
The pour is a dark red tripping towards light black. Nose is a rich brown sugar sautéed with caramel, vanilla, & a touch of bourbon. Other than the sweetness, doesn’t smell like a Belgian at all. 
Stickee Monkee is a beautiful barleywine…wait, what? Typical Firestone barrel-beauty is slobbering all over this beer. Wonderful bourbon notes, big vanilla rip, great woody branches spreading in the background. Underneath the barrel is rich caramel, brown sugga sweetness  I could motorboat happily, &, if I use a bit of imagination, I can almost sense the Belgian yeast. I think. Smooth as fresh ice, though there is an alcoholic tingle in the back of the throat & forebrain. I could power through a whole bomber of this myself, easy. I might try if I find another one. 
Firestone rarely disappoints & doesn’t here, either. An excellent barleywine. Quad. Sorry. 1,136 charactersmaximum12, Aug 27, 2014

4.36/5  rDev -2.2%Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Firestone Walker barrel room snifter. Purchased in Cumberland, RI. Allowed to warm over an hour. 
Pours a muddy brown body with a 2 finger light mocha colored head that reduces fairly quickly, leaving no retention. Aromas of caramel, toffee, molasses, dark fruit, candi sugar, raisins, some booze on the nose. The taste gets more and more pronounced as it warms up, mirroring the nose  with strong sweet notes of candi sugar, molasses, caramel, bourbon, raisins, dates, dark fruits, and a very nice roasty, toasty finish. Medium body with some booziness and low carbonation.
Overall, very complex and a great American representation of a Belgian Quad. On the sweet side, a little more than the usual quad. Very nice nonetheless. 767 charactersgcamparone, Aug 25, 2014

A- Dark brown body, pours like molasses with a one finger white head that retains well. No lacing. [4]
S- Sweet sugary caramel, brown sugar, honey, molasses. A little bit of dark fruit and coconut. Very sweet in a pleasant way, not in a cloying manner. [4.25]
F- As with the nose, this is a very sweet beer. Honey, maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla and coconut. Sweet in a complex way but not such that it's too cloying. Reminds me a lot of Curmudgeon's Better Half. [4.5]
N- On the lower side of "thick" body, a bit syrupy and slick. Not too boozy, which is very nice from a 13.4% quad. Enjoyable and not a chore to drink at all. [4.25]
O- This is very good. I have not had very many bourbon barrel quadrupel beers and this one is probably the best one I've had so far. As I stated above, this reminds me a lot of Curmudgeon's Better Half. [4.25]

Sweet caramel, oak, dark fruits and macaroon. Mouthfeel is really full and rich. Delicious. 372 characterswinningwes91, Aug 22, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%Appearance: Pours a deep garnet red/brown. Very light tan head that falls quickly. A thin tan ring hangs around. 
Aroma: Dark fruit (plums, raisins) hits the nose quickly. Followed by lots of toffee and sugar. Barrel character is prominent with caramel and vanilla blending well. Lots of juicy fruit character
Flavor: On the sweet side but never cloying. Again lots of dark fruit showing weizenbock qualities at time with the yeast/malt action. Banana is present. Oak is present along with vanilla and hints of dark chocolate. Verges on the edge of being overly boozy and sweet but never crosses the line.
Thick, rich mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. 662 charactersjacewg, Aug 20, 2014

Toasted coconut, butterscotch, molasses aromas. Slight leathery scent. 
Great layering of flavors. Butterscotch, vanilla, molasses. Slight spicy earth and wood notes. 
Very smooth and heavy. It's big, but not boozy. 
Yet another great, great beer from FW's top notch barrel aging program. 416 charactersVonerichs, Aug 08, 2014

One finger light tan head, and fairly bubbly. Dissolves to a thin collar with some larger bubbles in places along the edges. Body color is a nice dark garnet red and brown, very dark, but has some clarity through the bottom towards the head. Quite nice.
Nice classic Firestone aging. Hints of molasses and then some fruity dark plums. Juicy and spicy with sprinkled cane like sugar. Toffee with a candy taffy like smell, some winter warmer fruit warmth and controlled booze. Definitely comes off like a quad but very with some unique character.
Palate comes nicely, a real silky palate, with lots of pleasure in the mouth. Big coating malts, and lots of the fruit action. Big thick plum and dark bitter chocolate fill the crevices. Lots of toffee and candy action coat even with a prickly almost pepper spice on the aftertaste. Controlled boozy warmth as well, coming off as a real good sipper.
Overall a real nice take on a quad, with classic Firestone touch. 1,057 characterssmakawhat, Aug 06, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Bottle purchased from Nathaniel Square Corner Store in Rochester, NY.
Pours a dark copper brown, with a small half inch head that recedes basically immediately. There's no lacing, but what can you expect with a 13% quad barleywine monster beer?
Smells like burnt caramel, rich sweet bourbon, dark fruits, caramel, and oak. Classic Firestone Walker barrel-aged profile here.
The taste is similar. This has a wonderful dark caramel, almost burnt, as said above. This one is pretty bourbon-forward, but it is wonderful, rich, sweet bourbon flavor. This one also has notes of nuts, leather, tobacco, plum, red wine, vanilla, oak, and coconut. The coconut doesn't show up in every sip, but it's really welcome when it does!
This one is medium bodied- it's not quite as thick as I expected, but it tastes so good, that it doesn't really matter. There's a sticky, but smooth mouthfeel, along with a very low level of carbonation.
Yet another big winner from Firestone Walker's barrel program, this one was truly unique and unlike anything I've tasted. 1,049 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 05, 2014

The color is a shiny mahogany with no head or bubbles. The nose is soft, with some toasted nuts, brulee honey, sugar, smoked coconut and chocolate.
The taste follows the nose, with oak, ashtray, brown butter, diacetyl, vanilla and condensed milk. Sweet, but not as much as I remember it to be. Barrel, Scotch.
Mouthfeel is adequate but not superb, finishes a tad thin. Syrupy around the edges. Low carbonation. 
Overall: drinkable in the six-oz pour I got but no more. Better than I remember, but I'd still take Sucaba any day. 686 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jul 28, 2014

Flavor profile: I instantly get liquid mounds bar out of this. Melted chocolate and coconut. Leather, tobacco, molasses, caramel, and raisins all show. It has a belgian yeast like flavor with some bananas. A lot of vanilla and bourbon shows. The barrel flavors are spot on and not overpowering.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and warming. Medium bodied. Ends with a touch of dryness.
Overall, a very enjoyable quad. Maybe I just enjoy Americanized beers more, but this was one of my favorite quads I have had. The coconut flavors were awesome. 629 charactersmothman, Jul 24, 2014

The combination of lots of time to kill and a recent paycheck means I can afford to pick up a bottle of Stickee Monkee at the bar. Let's do this shit. It pours a clear sunset topaz-sienna topped by a finger or so of sandstone foam. The nose comprises caramelized Belgian candi sugar, mild molasses, toasted oak, toasted coconut, light Connecticut tobacco, graham cracker, clove, light allspice, and a hint of candied orange peel. The taste brings in more of the same, the oak, spices, and sweet elements taking full command in a lovely display of cooperation. A small faction of booze enters into the equation, but it is mostly drowned out by the delicious din around it. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly-syrupy feel. Overall, a damn fine beer, well worth my investment (and anyone else's, for that matter). Get some! 902 charactersTMoney2591, Jul 08, 2014

Bourbon notes up front in the aroma, with nuts, vanilla, toffee, a hint of coffee, and dark fruit.
Flavor reminds me of Sucaba, with decadent notes of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and toasted coconut. There's also a boozy dark fruit presence. Toasted malts fill out the rest of the profile with caramel and toffee.
Noticeable alcohol heat and evaporation. Thick and sticky. Lively with a pleasant sting; easy to hold and chew despite the heat.
It's tough to draw the line in this brew behind more traditional quads and FW's delicious barrel aging effects. The latter certainly dominate, but impressively smoothly so, while thick quad fruits and grains fill out the rest of the profile,

Appearance: doesn't look like a quad. Dark brown, almost black like a stout. Perfect amount of head. 
Smell: monkey bread, brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, pastries. The nose is delicious, like the best dessert ever. 
Taste: dark fruits, figs, dates, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, oakiness, wood. No alcohol burn or presence. Most well masked 13% I've had. Full of flavor, extremely rich. 
Mouthfeel: perfect level of carbonation. Effervescent and airy like a Belgian quad. 
Overall: this is truly unique and can't be categorized. A perfect dessert sipper. Best way I can relate to it is a cross between a quad and a stout. If you made monkey bread into a beer from heaven, this would be it. 717 charactersMonkeyBread, Jul 03, 2014

S: Sweet roasted caramel with vanilla extract, dank oak, and faint fruity figs. 
T: Orgasmic and deep vanilla, seeded jam preserves, some alcohol bite. The follow has buttery notes of the richest creme brulee you can imagine. 
M: Buttery and full with just the faintest alcohol singe; some nice astringency from the ABV is present, too. 
O: For two years, I thought nothing could ever surpass Parabola as the quintessential BBA beer, but this may have just changed my mind. FSW has once again created art, something so magnificent that you should have it sparingly lest you grow inured to its greatness. 821 charactersRanz, Jul 02, 2014

Tap to 8oz goblet
On tap @Congregation Ale house, Long beach, CA
App- A lighter brown color with garnet highlights. The head was 1/2 inch quick receding with very little retention or lacing. Quite what I expected.
Smell- Big quad scents. The oaky vanilla is upfront with some medicinal cherry/dark fruit scents. A little burnt sugar as you inhale deeply with a little bit of alcohol and tobacco.
Taste- This was a very large beer. I had to sip very slowly. Nice flavors in the beginning of some licorice and some fruits. A bit sweet on the back as it served. As it warmed more of the barrel came out and came with some roast and a bit of the molasses flavors I associate from a quad..
Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbed. A bit thin for a quad but the barrel accents with vanilla and alcohol dominate.
Drink- This was a good beer. Took me a while to find this one in So.Cal. Missed out on bottles so tap was a great solution for me. Was lucky to have during a tap takeover I found on accident. 1,022 charactersFosterJM, Jul 01, 2014

Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet nice and dark. Very faint bubbly tan head that is gone as soon as you reach for the glass. 
Insanely large body, Intense mouthfeel. The Alcohol is prominent but not overpowering. It arrives more on the finish. 
Strong flavor of molasses and brown sugar. It felt savory almost to me.

S: rich malt sugars suggesting sugar cane and rum; higher notes of oak and deeper notes of sweet dark booze-soaked fruit
T: sweet and boozy up front, brown sugar, cane sugar, and toffee; the alcohol and barrel-aging creates a rumminess, probably owing to the sugars used; the fruits set in gradually, reminiscent of fig and date - all thoroughly soaked in clear brown booze
M: tingly as if from spices and spirits up front, but generally smoothing out as it warms; slick, slight stick, faint drying on the end, but generally a lush feeling ale
O: elegant drinking experience, on the sweet side - don't know what kind of barrels were used, but the alcoholic airs are rum-like (as mentioned). I think it was a $17 bottle for me, and its worth it. 858 charactersGreywulfken, Jun 29, 2014

S - Immediately reminded me of Fremont's B-Bomb, what with its lovely, boozy, vanilla-infused bourbon character. This is a little more subdued in all of the above respects however, and has a fruitier aroma; primarily raisin and plum.
T - The bourbon barrel provides a mellow undercurrent and is surprisingly measured given the penchant brewers have for bourbon character predominating in their beer. Plum brandy, and a warm booziness. Rum and raisin ice cream, with a dark caramel swirl. Calvados makes an appearance towards the finish. Sweet, boozy and fruity. Not particularly spicy.
M - Sticky, fairly full-bodied, mild carbonation. Good, but could be a little more viscous.
O - Unusually I actually preferred this beer at the start, and found it a bit one-dimensional by the bottom of the bottle. In terms of style, it's not an orthodox quad, but it's certainly closer to quad than english barleywine territory. I haven't had a beer quite like it, and from my perspective it's a bit of an enigma. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this beer is its drinkability; at 13.4% I was expecting a lot more heat. 1,321 charactersabeeronthebeach, Jun 29, 2014

Pours a very dark ruby brown, black when not held to the light. A finger of beige foam has died away pretty quick to a frothy ring. Moderate carbonation stemming from the sides, okay lacings, great alcohol legs 
Smells of strong oak and bourbon, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, plums & figs with other dark fruits, chocolate, and alcohol. Everything melds pretty well, albeit pretty strong. Still smells great
Taste follows the nose pretty well. Strong oak and brown sugar upfront, bourbon, figs, molasses, toffee, tobacco, and notes of chocolate, finishing with a heavy bit of alcohol. Everything melts together on the palate, incredible beer
Feel is thick and heavy, creamy almost. Not very bitter, alcohol very noticeable. Incredibly easy to sip 
Overall another incredible ba beer from Firestone Walker 860 characterslordofstarside, Jun 25, 2014

4.81/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I tried this beer on tap at Babes in Rancho Mirage. With an ABV over 13, I was hoping this quad wouldn't overpower with alcohol taste. It was a perfect blend of taste and alcohol warmth. 
A previous reviewer used the term rum taste which fits perfectly. Low carbonation, high malt/sweet and a rum boozy aftertaste with warm lingering flavours is a simple summary. This is a great sipper as the taste is so rich and full. Another wonderful complex beer by Firestone! 466 charactersJSuperman, Jun 24, 2014

4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - deep, dark, almost black in color. Decent head that subsides fairly quickly.
Nose - huge malts, baked bread, vanilla, dates.
Taste - big sweet malt on the front, vanilla and toasted coconut from the barrel aging, vanilla and brown sugar on the back end, with some lingering vanilla. 
Mouthfeel - somewhat abrasive on the tongue, but mostly rolls over smooth. Low carbonation. And I'm definitely getting some heat from the high ABV, some belly warming affects, but I always welcome those things with an aged ale.
Overall - a top notch American quad, with tons of depth and character. I'll definitely be grabbing a bottle next year. 4.5/5 653 characterstheholygose, Jun 23, 2014

A deep brown with a hint of red and great clarity. Aroma includes toffee, prunes, raisins and more. Flavor follows with lots of dark fruit complexity and a mild sweetness. It's firm and powerful but balanced and smooth. The alcohol is clearly there but not dominant. Creamy with a nice low carbonation.
This is a powerful beer but with none of the rough edges you get with many American brewed big Belgians. Great stuff! 484 charactersGJ40, Jun 21, 2014

S- dates, dark caramel, toffee with a ripe plum like sweetness, alcohol. something savory, possibly tobacco or leatherish, from the barrel I imagine, is also very present
T- smoother than expected for sure. Definite leather and obvious bourbon barrel imparted woodiness. The ripe fruit is in and out depending on where the beer is at in my mouth at a given instant and as the beer warms it becomes more pronounced. Alcohol warmth is present especially as swallowing and during the aftertaste. Aftertaste is where the most barrel character is noted
M- thick and viscous with a very slight carbonation as expected.
O- generally I'm not a bourbon barrel whore, but this is damn fine. Drinks like a fine wine. Wish I had someone to share the bottle with because the 13% is going to pack a punch after 650ml. 895 charactersslackattack, Jun 20, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance - Pours dark brown with a slight red tinge and a razor thin khaki head at it's peak. Quick dissipation results in a near flat surface, with exception to the fair ring of suds encircling the edge of the glass. No lacing, but none expected for a brew like this.
Smell - Simply beautiful. A vinous fragrance intertwined with deep caramel and lesser chocolate notes. Oak and leather earthiness rounds out the aroma nicely.
Taste - Follows the nose. A vinous/raisin fruitiness playing nicely off a deep caramel undertone. Touches of cola that come through more as the brew warms. Strong oak and earthy qualities begin to come through mid-taste, leaving a finish that's sweet, but better balance than what's found at the start. Tobacco leaf spice really starts to come through once the beer hits room temp.
Mouthfeel - Full in body with low carbonation. Thins out in the finish, giving it a lighter feel overall. Stupid smooth for 13%, with just a touch of heat and belly warmth in the finish.
Overall - Man, this is a hell of a brew. I'm not a big Quad fan because I find them cloyingly sweet and with too syrupy a body. Conversely I find many BA brews suffer from beer that may not be big and complex enough to withstand the Barrel Aging process, leaving an end product that's overwrought with too much booziness. To me this is one is a perfect marriage. Big flavors that aren't overwhelmed by the bourbon influence, while the normally thick and syrupy Quad body is thinned out nicely, delivering a smooth and approachable quality of drink. The end result is something like a BA blended barleywine, and it's wonderful. Glad I picked up a 2nd bottle for aging... should be fun to re-visit! 1,699 charactersTheSixthRing, Jun 17, 2014

A: Just a little slightly tan head. Fades to nothing. Black, but shows a deep red glow when put towards the light. Honey-brown in the dimple. No lacing. Fairly long lasting sheeting, showcases high ABV. Slight honey-brown meniscus.
S: Big Bourbon-y, sweet caramels on the nose. Molasses. Oak. Raisin, a bit hidden behind bigger smells. Toffee.
T/MF: Lots of sweeter notes from the dark malts. Sweet char, bittersweet chocolate, toffee, sweet black coffee. Fairly soft texture on the palate, with a light bubbly tingle. Again, raisin is buried behind other stronger flavors, but still there. Some Bourbon caramels on the back end. Not what I think of when I see "Quad", but a solid BBA-beer.

Pours cloudy dark cola brown. The very thin head quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. 
The smell is of bourbon, oak, tobacco, caramel, prunes, raisins, banana and a hint of vanilla. 
The taste is of brown sugar, plums, cinnamon, molasses and raisins. There is just a slight warming sensation from the 13.4% ABV.
The texture is full bodied and velvet smooth with low carbonation. 
Call it a quad or call it a barleywine. Whatever you name it, it is rich, smooth, dark stone fruit, brown sugar, malty goodness. It goes down way too easily for a beer of this weight. 595 charactersFurlinator, Jun 13, 2014

A- Pours a brown/ mahogany color with red hues visible upon putting the beer up toward light. A small amount of off-white head fades to the sides quickly. 
S- Notes of sweet oakiness and bourbon are noted in the aroma. The alcohol sting is also apparent with each sniff. 
T- Initially are heavy notes of bourbon and oak. Then comes some sugary sweetness with seems to stick around through the rest of each sip. 
M- Medium bodied, low carbonation, drinks hot, great sipper. 
This is another great BA offering from FW. It does not disappoint. 604 charactersvic21234, Jun 07, 2014

A - Very rich brown in color, a little darker than what I was expecting. I haven't had that many quads though. Surprisingly large head. Most firestone barrel aged beers have small heads. Loads of legs when tilting the glass around. 
S - Hits the nose exactly like a FW barrel aged beer always does. Lots of coconut, chocolate, leather, oak, tobacco. Yummy! There are loads of barrel aged brews out there but FW seems to come with it's own aromas. No alcohol is present on the nose.
T - Follows right in line with the smell. Lots of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, chocolate, and oak. Soooo smooth. Really reminds me of the 15th anniversary. Really drinkable. I really enjoy FWs barrel aged flavors, but they are a little redundant throughout the vintage family.
M - Very rich. Full body coats your mouth and lingers on in flavor forever. Not a lot of carbonation after the pour bur very fresh.
O - Again, FW hits a home run! A little cheaper than some of the other releases but still sold out everywhere in like a day. Can't wait to see how this ages. 1,108 charactersThePaleRider, Jun 06, 2014

The beer pours a fairly dark amber color with pretty good head retention and lacing. The nose attarctive as well, though you can tell right off this is going to be a pretty rich/sweet beer. Anyway, there is considerable vanilla, dark fruits and toffee aroma in this beer. On the palate, this is really yummy stuff. Yes, the beer is a bit sweet, but there's lovely flavors of caramel, toffee, nougat, coconut, vanilla and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is full and soft, and the finish seems to go on forever in this rich beer. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and while you can tell it's up there, there is no heat from the high abv. Also, while this beer is pretty sweet, it's not at all cloying, and so drinkabilty is pretty good.
Definitely a sipper. Hard to imagine drinking a lot of this, but a small glass after dinner for dessert would be perfect. 931 charactersJohn_M, Jun 06, 2014
4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Firestone Walker really has their barrel program cranking on all cylinders. Poured a dark brown, no light getting through with an off while head. Classic Firestone Walker barrel aged beer. Huge vanilla and toasted coconut notes, underlined with toffee, caramel and burnt sugar. Taste mirrors the smell, smooth as hell and decently viscous. A nice little bourbon heat that sticks with you at the end. If there is one complaint, it's that this doesn't really do much to differentiate from other Firestone Barrel Aged beers. If I was blind folded and told to guess between this and Sucaba, I'd have a hard time telling them apart. Like I said, not much of a complaint because they are both great. 693 charactersDavepoolesque, Jun 06, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5What to try for the 2,000th review on BA? A bit of a dilemma because most of my favorite world class beers are already reviewed. Had a Backyard Rye Bourbon County Stout in the cellar, but the pain and suffering to get that bottle was so depressing I have been putting off trying it. Then Stickee Monkee showed up for a brief (like the life span of those new man-made elements) showing at a local store and the decision was obvious. A new Firestone Walker and an ingredient in the beloved Anniversary beers. Life is good. 
Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque in the glass with a fine half finger light brown head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma dominated by oak and bourbon, with light supporting dark fresh and dried fruit and caramel, really a barrel aged barleywine profile. Flavor is sweet syrup, vanilla, caramel, dark dried fruit, light stone fruit, oak and bourbon. Full, almost syrupy bodied with little carbonation presence on the tongue. A very interesting flavor in the finish, almost like a fine fruit reduction, flavorful but indescribable. This has quad sweetness, but the heavier fruit of a barleywine, but without the heavy malt flavors. A unique and tasty definition breaking strong ale. Quite sweet and little hop presence. A perfect desert ale. World class. Lucky enough to have an extra for the basement and look forward to this with a few years on it. 1,435 charactersLiquidAmber, Jun 06, 2014

Pours dark amber brownish purple with a small yellowish head that recedes pretty quickly. Aroma of big time bourbon and vanilla, caramel, toffee, figs, other dark fruits. Smells like a BA Old Ale. Flavor is massive bourbon notes with a smooth vanilla finish. Dark fruits behind the booze, some big oaky notes, and lots of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, and toffee. Not much Belgian Quad going on here but I suspect they weren't going for that anyway. Big rich mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Lots of booze but still very smooth with a lingering vanilla and dark fruits on the palate. Mmmm. 623 charactersBMMillsy, Jun 05, 2014

4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle from j47paco (thanks again!). 2014 vintage (released in May). Served in a Three Floyds teku. 
Pours a deep, dark garnet, letting only a tiny bit of light through with a finger and a half of sand-hued head. A thin haze of froth lingers but leaves only a couple solitary bubbles of "lace", if you can really still call it that. 
Rich, enticing aromas of dark stone fruits, vanilla, toffee, caramel, bourbon, coconuts and brown sugar. I keep coming back to take it in. 
Right from the first sip, a sweet, decadent succession of flavors wash over the palate. Natural Turbinado sugar cane, whiskey, an eathen oaky vanilla, booze soaked plums/dates, toffee, caramel, raisin bread, toasted coconut, faint chocolate, brown sugar, cola, banannas Foster and a sharp kick of booze. There is so much delicious sweetness going on here that it drinks as if well under 10% abv. Complex and outstanding. 
Syrupy, medium full and yes, sticky feel with light carbonation. Carmelized dark fruit, bourbon Coke and brown sugar lounge upon the tongue in the lingering, sugar coated aftertaste. 
Super glad this long-time draft only rarity finally found it's way into a bottle. Stickee Monkee does a great job almost bridging the gap between two of my favorite styles. I believe that it's less a full-on quad and more an English barleywine with quad elements but no matter what you call it, this is a sweet, multifaceted, delicious treat! I would love to accumulate multiples for enjoyment both now and it the coming months/ years. Another fantastic beast of a beer and real winner from Firestone Walker. Get it while/if you can! 1,623 charactersThickNStout, Jun 04, 2014

Aroma is big and chewy; lots of strong booze, toffee, caramel, molasses, vanilla.
Taste follows nose. Brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, and rum-drenched oak. Seems like more of an English barleywine than a quad, but it's tasty nonetheless. Definitely stickee.
Mouthfeel is thicky and gooey, like maple syrup. Tons of sugars here lingering on the palate.
Overall another rock-solid barrel-aged beer from Firestone Walker. 583 charactersdraheim, Jun 04, 2014

A-Appearance is a beautiful deep amber with a crimson tint and no foam whatsoever, no lacing at all.
S-Aroma of sugared cotton candy, sticky molasses, bourbon, hinted roasted malts, toffee, malted barley, and faint cocoa nibs. 
T-Taste is sticky melted candy, melted caramel, melted molasses and bourbon upfront. Immediately followed by slick toffee, oak, root beer, sugary caramel, and oak notes. Finish is relatively boozey with honey and more sticky malts resigning on the palate.
M-Mouthfeel has a medium body with soft carbonation.
O-Overall another great BA beer from Firestone. A very balance beer that is never in full force with bourbon. Was lucky enough to stubble on at TW since I missed out on draft the day before at Frisco. 784 charactersreebtaerG, Jun 03, 2014
3.39/5  rDev -24%look: 2.75 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Consumed June 2nd, 2014 from a bottle purchased at FW Barrelworks in Buellton. Poured into a small snifter.
Dark brown liquid with obscure deep garnet highlights. Beer has virtually no carbonation and as a result no head to speak of. Only the tiniest little ring of foam around the crown. Disappointing.
Aroma is strong and redolent with cane sugar and booze. Faint dates and chocolate. Not bad, but also not delicious.
Flavor is moderately sweet with a cinnamon note. Some bitter wood and hot spirit notes. Toasted coconut. Mild milk chocolate. Lacking in the expected bready character.
Mouthfeel is still and thick, leaning towards cloying. The low carbonation has really done this beer in.
A rare miss from Firestone Walker; the elements are there, just not in a pleasing balance. An incidental note: I have had this one several times on its own over the years, but never reviewed it. However, it doesn't seem to be very different from how I remember it. 962 characterscharlzm, Jun 03, 2014

A- Snifter pour from the tapped keg. Dark brown almost opaque body with a one finger foamy head. The crown has good retention for a 13% BA brew. Thick creamy ring deposits drizzle and sheets to the glass.
S- Heavy caramelized candi sugar, tobacco, huge dark fruit raisin, oak, sweet syrup, deep sugary malts, brown sugar and maple somehow. Alludes to heavy sweetness but plenty of Trappist yeast backing it.
T- Raisins, deep fruits and candi sugar form a beastly base that is complimentary to the vanilla oak sweetness, whiskey spirits and malts. Toasted coconut, banana esters, slight cocoa, apple and a heavy Trappist Belgian yeast spice.
MF- Massively thick body that is a cross between oily syrup and cream, stellar for the beer's flavors. Carbonation on the lower end that suits the sweet and spicy flavor. Finishes quite warm but not uncomfortably so.
FW knows barrels and how to brew a good beer to go in them. I said that after Parabola and Sucaba but this is just icing on the cake with a Belgian style. Sweet but not overly so with big fruits and smooth vanilla oak. 1,254 characterscbutova, Jun 02, 2014

S-Decadent, rich and sweet. Concentrated bourbon, booze-soaked raisins, dried wood. Very sugary with lots of caramel. 
T-The flavor is resoundingly sweet but the barrel's influence balances to the sugars. It's not overly Belgiany, which I truly don't mind. Specifically, I get flavors of molasses, caramel, roasted nuts, boozy dark fruits. Lingering oakiness that also dictates much of the flavor.
M-It's so well made, it somehow tiptoes around the 'cloying' description. Rich and sugary and hot. Has a warm, dry finish. Soft carbonation. Could use a bit more body.
O-Not as complex as some of Firestone Walker's other specialty beers. It's still, a really neat take on a style that I am far from enamored with. Even if it isn't my favorite from this brewery, it's one of the best Quads I have had. 978 charactersVelvetExtract, Jun 01, 2014

Smell- At first I got a strong raspberry scent, as it warmed the bourbon really showcased itself. I also get some caramel and prunes mixed in there, very sweet smell.
Taste- Very balanced, not overly sweet or bitter. I get some cola, dark fruit, burnt caramel and bourbon. Alcohol is present but not overbearing. Very little heat.
Mouthfeel- Medium body and good carbonation. Not overly drying and little heat from the alcohol.
Overall- Good beer, hides alcohol well. Has a very nice and clean flavor and scent. Definitely worth trying. 676 charactersIPAdams, Jun 01, 2014

S: 4.5 Lots of toffee, caramel, vanilla, and dark fruits up front. Some yeast that might resemble a Belgian variety, but calling this a quad is a bit of a stretch. There’s also some roasted malt that adds a hint of earthiness.
T: 4.5 Kind of sweet at first, but it brings along a lot of the same features as on the nose. Dark fruits are a bit more up front, then lots of vanilla, toffee, and salted caramel. There’s a bit of molasses and spice at the end. Definitely does not taste like a quad, much more like an english barleywine. This reminds me a lot of sucaba with added dark, spice notes from the turbinado sugar.
M: 4.25 A little thin and undercarbonated for my taste. However, there’s a bit of dryness at the the end that’s very pleasant. 
O: 4.5 This beer is great. Almost on par with sucaba. It seems strange to be categorized as a quad, but a good beer is a good beer regardless of what the label says. 1,038 charactersTele, May 31, 2014

One of my favorite breweries in the planet. I've had the parabola, sucaba, lil opal, on tap and some on bottles but their BA series brings so many layers of aroma and the taste is to die for. Let's get down to it.

But that being said, this is better than most quads that I've had.

A: Pours an extremely dark brown with a little red. Tall, frothy medium brown head. Head fades at a moderate pace with decent retention. Zero lacing however. Not even the lightest little speck.
S: Heavy caramel from the bourbon. Sugary sweet aroma. Sweet generic berries and dark fruits (raisin and fig primarily I'd say). Lightest hint of chocolate? I would say loads of belgian candi sugar but I don't even think they used it in this recipe. Sweet and heavy, regardless. 
T: Bourbon character up front but not as pronounced as in the nose. Seriously sweet. Loads of caramel, sugar and candied dark fruits up front. Light cocoa in the middle and a heavy, dark bread malt mixing with more caramel. Nice toasted sugar in the aftertaste with light oak. Lingering oaky, earthy aftertaste.
M: Thick, heavy, viscous and sweet. Lower carbonation. 
O: Seriously big and sweet quad. Barrel-aging is quite nice, adding even more complexity and....sweetness with caramel and toasted sugars. Loads of bourbon, fruit, chocolate and sugary sweetness. What's not to love? 1,099 charactersDope, May 26, 2014

4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 2014 Vintage bottle. 13.4% ABV, "the only true constant is change," is very true with this brew. Though it isn't that different from the sample I had on tap a few years back. Pours a very nice, deep brown, 1/4 inch head, no lace.
The nose is filled with barrel, booze and sugar. Plum and Port in the background.
Dark fruit is quickly followed by the sugar when I first sip, wood appears around the middle, along with sweet raisin and mild cigar. The finish is boozy hot with some dessert wine. The body has a moderate thickness, perfect carbonation, and a bit of heat.
I bet this would age very well! I'm a fan of the 2014! 640 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, May 24, 2014

4.14/5  rDev -7.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25650ml bottle, 2014 vintage, poured into a Firestone Walker Barrelworks Teku.
The beer pours a deep burgundy color, definite shades of cola brown, nicely opaque with a bubbly, loose, khaki head that has low retention and just a spot or two of lace is yielded. The aroma is full of brown and Candi sugar, stone fruits, sweet and rich malted grain, light bourbon with a nice presence of toffee and vanilla. The flavors are quite nice, again, the big rush of brown and Candi sugars, stone fruit character is strong, plum and cherry, with some woody oak and bourbon while a bit of an earthier showing of nougat, toffee, vanilla and grain comes across at the finish. The body is a bit thin and very lively, coats the mouth fairly well with a very smooth and easy finish that is lightly warming.
Verdict: A very tasty beer from Firestone Walker. They call it a quad on the bottle, in the past I've seen it as a barleywine and that's a bit of how I think of it, hard to find much in the way of the yeasty goodness that makes up a strong quad, but this has all the hallmarks of a great barleywine. The alcohol is hidden perfectly and is the beer's best asset. The richness and sweetness is cut nicely by the barrel aging and the complexity is right in the sweet spot where it's definitely layered but still straightforward enough to be accessible to everyone. 1,352 characterskevanb, May 24, 2014

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5My first review.. Just been lazy should have been like my 1000th but gotta start somewhere. 
2014 vintage (thinking this is the first since they released this blend as the 1st anniversary ale. Love when breweries bring back these kind of deals). Poured into an inappropriate deep glass cup not really as snifter like as I would have liked. 
A: Pours a nice mahogany toffee-like brown, small carbonated head vanishes and left with a thin layer. Not viscous appearing. What you would expect from a quad and for that matter very similar in appearance to Sucaba. 
S: A pleasant bourbon not too hot. That's exciting especially since I gave her a whiff right after I opened a bottle and for beers like BT, that can be quite overwhelming. Pleasant but not sharp. Nice molasses, vanilla, caramel, oak but not too woody. Good not phenomenal but better than what I expected.
T: Unlike many BA beers this one, this guy has the bourbon very well integrated. It's not too hot and over the top. You get that good plum quad taste but it's not too intense and definitely there isn't that belgian yeastiness that can be a little off-putting. It's unique because it's kind of a 50/50 Old ale and quad mix too it but you can definitely notice the BA presence. Clean up and down. Finish really really nice with that toffee borderline coconut. The finish alone makes me want more.
M: Kind of thin off the start. I've noticed this with Parabola too. But at the same time, smooth without the astringency of a high ABV beer which make no mistake this is. The finish is magical. True to it's name a leaves you satisfied. The initial thinnest is totally made up for by the finish and makes the beer very quaffable. For a quad that I haven't had to sit on for 2 years, I didn't expect this. That being said just like any other high ABV beer if you pour this in increments the end of the bottle changes the alcohol feel.
O: Firestone continues to do something in the BA program where I feel it's good drinking now. Gets different as the beer warms but the flavor profile doesn't change too much. I will sit on a couple bottles. Definitely up there on par with Parabola. Got a few at $15.99 which is very reasonable and would probably spend up to $20 on the bottle if I get antsy with my other bottles and have to get desperate. Well done Firestone. 2,326 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, May 24, 2014

A: Pours a deep mahogany brown, small tan head that quickly dissipates. On par for course here, murky but appetizing if you know your way around the BA barleywine/old ale game.
S: Tons of toffee, vanilla, caramelized sugar, and the like. Smooth.
T: Same as above, with some bourbon heat thrown in the mix. Incredibly well-integrated.
M: Sticky (who would have thought?) but surprisingly not cloying or over-done. Hides its sugar and 13 some-odd ABV quite well. Dangerously drinkable given the style. 
O: I would compare this favorably to such favorites as BB4D and Brandy Old Stock. Remarkably well-integrated out of the gate, and with tons of depth of flavor/aroma. Will absolutely seek out more. 771 charactersmrkdwrds, May 22, 2014

Aroma is sweet candy, sugar, vanilla, barrel, booze, my goodness it is nice. Flavor is more of the same, very delicious, boozy, sweet, great barrel characteristics. It really tastes more like a barleywine than a quad to me, it doesn't seem to have any Belgian characteristics at all. This is quite the fine beer and I stupidly passed on a bottle which means now that I'd like one I won't find one. Oh well, lucky to have had a taste at all. This compares really nicely to Parabola and Abacus, buy it if you see it. 562 charactersArrogantB, May 19, 2014
5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Pours dark brown and doesn’t really leave a head, you kind of get a couple patches of a head and the color of it is mocha/tan, looked awesome from the pour, when it sits in the glass it is pitch black, wasn’t expecting that but it honestly looks like oil, but it looks fantastic!
S: This category is much more simple than the rest, immediately from pouring the Turbinado brown sugar fills the nearby surroundings, then you are enlightened with a hint of booze, but a fantastic barrel presence, like a mix of oak and bourbon, the barrels seem like they are clashing with each other constantly, you get brashness from the bourbon and smooth vanilla mixed around constantly, superb smell to this beer, the huge amount of brown sugar mixed with the lighter presence of the alcohol and barrels is phenomenal!
T: This part blew me away! Initial taste is broken down hops mixed with a little bitterness and booze! The booze seems like it’s on the barrier of too much and just right, what helps tame it is the Turbinado brown sugar, and this is what makes this beer amazing, and so unique compared to any other beer! Immediately after the booze hits, the Turbinado brown sugar comes through with a strong but not overpowering presence, and that is pretty much the middle phase of the beer, but the finish you get the same amount of Turbinado presence and then a light blend of broken down hops, alcohol, bitterness, caramel, toffee, vanilla, a tiny bit of dark fruits(almost unnoticeable because of the Turbinado) and the outstanding barrel presences found in this FW series, I’m getting bourbon and oak, absolutely stunning! I know this beer used to be labeled as a barelywine, and they are now listing this beer as a Central Coast Quad, I get a little bit of a quad appearance from the dark fruits, but this definitely seems more like a barley wine, but label what you want FW, this beer is fantastic, wish I could have got more then 6! Can’t wait to see how these things mature with some time!
M: Based off of the name I was expecting a syrupy mouthfeel, and it delivers! Thick, viscous, sticky, syrupy, but even with all those categories it is still smooth and drinkable, never had a beer with this kind of mouthfeel, definitely has an oily feel to it as well, but in this case it really helps this beer because it makes it very drinkable, but what truly makes this section outstanding is how long this beer lingers on your pallet! Amazing mouthfeel!
O: I had high expectations for this beer, heard great things about it, but it lived up to those reputations and surpassed them IMO, each category for this beer has something that’s different and stands out from other categories, but every characteristic of this beer pieces together so well and makes it complete, it’s like a puzzle, sometimes all the pieces are there, but sometimes you can’t find some pieces, but the harder you look you end up finding those missing pieces, this beer has taken my palate on a tour around the world instead of a measly roller coaster, MUST GET! Probably my new favorite offering from FW, well done guys! 3,108 charactersbpasquini, May 19, 2014

Appearance: Dark sienna, held to the light, the edges are a warm red-orange. No head whatsoever. Flattens out quickly. Slightly cloudy, a *tiny* bit grey. But, I'm not gonna just sit here and look at it, now am I?
Smell: Bourbon barrel wood is clear but not overwhelming. Very, very pleasant. I was hoping it would be like that. Has a bit of a Belgian aroma, that is sweet but not obnoxious. A little alcohol, a little fruit sweetness. 
Taste(s): The highly anticipated first sip was all sugar. After that I get grape, plums, oak, and zero bitterness. It really reminds me of a single malt scotch, but without the punch in the neck. Then about 30 seconds later, a tanginess envelopes the sides and back of the tongue. 
Mouthfeel: Lives up to its name. Sticky palate, sticky lips. This is a good thing. Like beer candy! Silky smooth and no carbonation at all
I love FW's Double Jack, and when my local purveyor recommended this, I had to go for it. It's expensive, but if you want something special and unusual, I think this is worth the price. Really good, not for everyday use. 1,176 charactersjlazerus, May 18, 2014

(A)- Pours fairly pitch black with minimal tan froth.
(S)- A great aroma of something akin to a bananas foster with a heavier sense on the raisins. Great cocoa and bananas.
(T)- Quite similar to the smell. Some dense fudge, raisin, and a plum/banana combo with a caramel-like coconut sweetness. Still thinking of something akin to an alcoholic bananas foster.
(M)- A mellow carbonation level. Quite a nice balance without being too sweet or boozy, though its got a kick to it but nowhere drinks like 13.4%.

Pours dark brown with ruby highlights. Nice tan head builds fast and dissipates just as fast. 
Aroma is huge barrel character of bourbon, toasted coconut, vanilla, and earthy oak. Creme brûlée, cinnamon almonds, faint sweet licorice, and some agave sweetener provide that malt backbone kick. No hop character whatsoever. Subtle spices also barely present leaning towards fall spices, clove, etc. 
The taste is more barrel oakiness, light maple syrup, toasted coconut, peppery bourbon, vanilla, peloncillo... Yes it's sweet, but it's also boozy, spicy, and has just enough of an earth/wood presence to make this drink with an allusion of balance.
In FW fashion, awesome barrel to malt marriage.
Mouthfeel is lighter like a belgian. Lighter than many English and American Barleywines. But has a syrupy quality that is pleasant considering the spirit character of the beer. 
Overall a tasty treat. Much like a Barleywine and close in spirit to Sucaba. Enjoyed this just as much as I did at the Firestone Walker Invitational last year. Another great addition to the barrel aged portfolio at Firestone. 1,142 charactersMarcWP, Jun 28, 2013

A: Pours a semi clear brown color with a tan head forming on the pour. Nice retention on the head, it recedes slowly to a thick ring and leaves nice splotches of lace.
S: Dark fruits, caramel and some light baker's chocolate. The barrel is there faintly with some light bourbon and oak.
T: Light bourbon and some heat up front. Sweet honey, dark fruits and toffee all present. There is a spicy hop flavor as well that seems to creep up and recedes at different spots during each sip. 
M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation level.
O: I thought this was solid overall. There was a little too much heat from the booze for me even at 12%. The beer did get better as warmed up so I'd suggest waiting a touch before consuming given the opportunity. 810 charactersTreebs, Nov 22, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Served a cloudy brown-copper color with a little bit of white head. The head fades down pretty quickly leaving behind a touch of lace.
S - Aroma is full of sweet brown sugar and rich caramel malts. There is a touch of Bourbon, vanilla, and some nutty smells as well.
T - Starts off with some sweet rich caramel malts with some brown sugar and some nutty flavors. Through the middle, the Bourbon comes through with some oak and vanilla. The finish is a mix of rich sweet brown sugar and dark fruit with some Bourbon and some booze.
M - Medium-full bodied with very mild carbonation. Feels smooth with a sweet and warming finish.
D - Very drinkable. Very sweet and bold with a nice bourbon mix with the sweet rich caramel and nutty malts. 744 charactersngeunit1, Apr 03, 2012

4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at the Toronado. Served in a flute.
A - Thin off-white foam settles to a thin ring, and not much else. Transparent ruby-brown body.
S - Bourbon, oak barrels, cherries, milled grains, treacle, some fruity notes, wood, and a hint of alcohol.
T - Tons of candied cherries, caramel, hint of cocoa, dark fruits, vanilla, and less oak than the aroma suggests. Alcohol is very well-hidden here.
M - Chewy, full body, medium-low carbonation, some tannic oak, and lower alcohol than you'd expect for 12%.
D - This is quite good - reminds me of draft Abacus a little, and definitely one of my favorite FW blend beers. Definitely explains why I like FW14 so much, although I'm puzzled as to why I didn't love FW15 - I must hate Helldorado. 740 charactersMasterSki, Feb 22, 2012
3.8/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Toronado. Pours a dark reddish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big caramel, some brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, some plum, and a bit of brandy. A hint of of alcohol, but not much. The taste is sweet with caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, plum, and some bourbon. The finish is warming with a little alcohol apparent. Big, full bodied beer, but not syrupy. Low carbonation. 461 charactersjethrodium, Feb 15, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at City Beer Store. Clear hazel color with low carbonation. Big toffee and vanilla aroma, slight butterscotch, a lot of barrel. Heat is reigned-in. Palate exceeds the nose, showing a nice balance between barrel heat and rich toffee flavors. Full bodied, with light tannin and alcohol in the finish. Finishes very nicely, extremely smooth and palatable. Side by side with Abacus this was slightly better. 410 characterslargadeer, Jan 12, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Tony's Darts Away in Burbank, CA. 
Pours a clear copper color with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and banana. Taste is of malt, brown sugar, sticky toffee pudding, and bananas covered in caramel. Awesome flavors on this one. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine with lots of complex aromas and flavors. I am very glad I was able to try this one. 613 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 23, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Tony's Darts Away, served in a snifter.
A: The beer is caramel/amber in color and fairly translucent, with a head the quickly dissipates but leaves a white ring at the edges and leaves solid lacing.
S: With my nose not quite firing on all cylinders (damn allergies!), I whiff a nice blend of vanilla, brown/dark sugar, and butterscotch.
T: Definitely some heat here, but nothing that lingers too long in the throat. Caramel and butterscotch on the palate, with some hops providing just the right amount of balance in the overall flavor. I might be crazy, but part of the taste reminds me a bit of those bear-shaped honey grahams.
M: Medium carbonation, perfect for supporting the lightly-syrupy body and presenting it a non-cloying manner (at least in small servings). Beers leaves a minimal coating on the tongue, with an excellent finish that combines lingering vanilla with a touch of heat.
O: Excellent beer, perhaps a bit bolder in places than Abacus. I'd love to see this make an appearance in the Proprietor's Reserve Series, so others (and myself) could enjoy this heretofore draft-only delight in bottles. Yum! 1,134 charactersUltraman9000, Oct 22, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Short story. It was my wife’s birthday, and we were on our way back home in the San Fernando Valley from San Manuel casino. Neither of us still haven’t had a chance to go to Verdugo Bar, and we made a detour on the way home to check it out. Unfortunately, I didn’t know they don’t open until 6 p.m. so that was a bust. Since it was 4 p.m. we opted to go to Tony’s Darts Away, and were glad we did, as they had this on tap. 
Knowing that this is a component to the Anniversary beers, and rarely goes on tap by itself, I was excited to try it. 
A: Served in a snifter, roughly a 6 to 8 oz pour. The beer is a hazy brown, with a orange/copper hue. Lightly carbonated, just a ring of thin tan bubbles along the edges of the glass, with no discernable lacing. 
S: Great layered scents of vanilla, sweet roasted barley, toffee, light oak, and buttery bourbon. Heat is present, but this smells great. 
T: Mirrors the nose, and no surprises. Blended nuanced flavors of vanilla, lightly roasted caramel barley malts, some toast, oak, and toffee. Smooth sipping, quite nice. 
M: Sweet, lightly carbonated, full oily to buttery mouth feel. 
O: I took a good 30 minutes or so smelling and sipping on this one. I thoroughly enjoyed this, more so than Abacus personally. I hope they bottle this one too at some point, as it has more of that bourbon vanilla I like, and less of the dark fruit notes. 1,400 charactersRetsinis, Oct 20, 2011

It's hard for me to fully compare this to firestone 14 or abacus, but it definitely ranks up there with both
Very little carb, short head. 
Smells sweet. 
Tastes wonderful. Reminds me of alpine good to a degree
Heat is not noticeable in my opinion
Definitely could drink more than the 6oz pour they're offering here. 391 charactersjohndoe8, Feb 12, 2011
3.58/5  rDev -19.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5On-tap at Strong Ale
A: The pour is a dark amber color, perhaps leaning towards brown, with a tan head.
S: The usual sweet, sugar notes of a barleywine are here. I get brown sugar, caramel, and toffee, but there's a weird nuttiness to this beer that seems out of place.
T: This tastes like almost like a really creamy nut brittle with extra nuts. There's a fair amount of alcohol presence as well, a touch of oak, and some good vanilla notes.
M: The body is medium with a nice creaminess and a low to moderate level of carbonation.
D: This was a weird beer. In fact, several of the blending components for FW14 aren't all that great, but somehow they make a delicious final product. 687 characterswomencantsail, Dec 04, 2010
