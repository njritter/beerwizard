Smell: Lots of chocolate with a faint presence of the cinnamon and maybe the pepper. 
Taste: awesome chocolate flavors galore with the cinnamon and pepper subtly balancing that sweetness. Would have appreciated more of a vanilla profile. 
Feel: this is were CCB always gets me. The mouthfeel and carb are so balanced. 
Overall: a reminder that stouts can be great even if they aren't barrel aged and from the old money era. Huna was the trendsetter and the 2017 batch is delicious. Not too much cinnamon and green pepper like other years. 575 charactersmnbuffalo, Jun 03, 2017

4.64/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass (2017 release, 1 1/2 months old). Appearance is thick and jet black with 1/2 finger thick brown head and good retention. Smell is a good amount of cinnamon up front, cocoa nibs, and roasted malt with a hint of charred chilies and vanilla coming through on the back end. The aroma is excellent, but I would prefer a little less cinnamon as it somewhat hides the other flavors. 
The roasted malt and cocoa nibs come through more on the taste, but the cinnamon is there lurking in the back of the mouth. There is a nice flavor transition with more heat, bitterness, and cinnamon coming through on the finish. The chilies are more noticeable than in the aroma with a nice balance between the Ancho and Pasilla chilis. Sweetness and bitterness are moderate and well balanced. Mouthfeel is extremely thick (almost syrupy) with good body up front that transitions to a lighter finish.
Overall this is an excellent thick Mexican style stout with amazing aroma. The flavor combinations are well executed, but I would prefer less cinnamon so that the other flavors were more prominent. I generally prefer a little less thick/syrupy mouthfeel, but it works quite well. My favorite component is the layers upon layers of flavors that give this beer great complexity. Hunaphu's is definitely a slow sipper but is great after a long cold day. 1,370 charactersthatche2, May 06, 2017

Really impressed by this. Which is equally impressive because of all the impressive hype this beer has. Great beer to enjoy at a BYOB Bucktown sushi bar. Impressed?   All these words and I have not yet made a single comment about the brew, impressive.  Overall, its a bomb stout and has that delicious espresso colored head that slowly forms a consistent ring until the end. Cinnamon, vanilla, oak and fudge aroma's.  I was always skeptical of this brew because of the Chili's but they're very subtle and completely overrun by the cinnamon.  I expected more chili as it warmed but it was still subdued. Balance is fine word to insert here because all the flavors compliment each other.  There's almost a food chain battle going on in this glass.  One flavor subdues the other and so on and so on. The vanilla hides the chili's and the cinnamon hides everything!  There was also some wine element to this beer.  It had the mouthfeel of a fine red wine and the small flavor similarities.  Dark fruits, oak, etc. Overall, a very nice offering.  The popularity and following for this brew is seemingly understandable after trying.  However, would I dash out all sorts of loot to go to Florida from Chicago to get it again? Perhaps someday.  Until then, I'll continue to trade or buy from some other sucker with deeper pockets than mine. 1,346 charactersDankacheese, May 03, 2017

The nose is cocoa with the faintest hint of spice kick on the backend.  The palate is straight up Taza Stone Ground Chocolate (the smooth cocoa is identical, as is the spice-profile).  The interplay of cocoa and spice works beautifully, but is a touch sweeter than I'd like (a little more bitterness would be better I feel).  Outstanding nonetheless. 433 charactersLAp, Apr 15, 2017

The nose is cinnamon up front followed by chocolate and a small bit of heat presumably from the chiles. The taste? It is decadent and layered with complexity. So much going on here! First you get a great deal of cinnamon almost too much, I knocked big bad Baptista for a overpowering cinnamon taste but Hunahpu's overpowering cinnamon quickly gives way to the many other flavors present unlike BBBAPTISTA. Rich creamy chocolate, roasted malts, Smooth silky vanilla, light coffee and yes those chiles all make bold appearances. It finishes with light heat from the chiles, a light caramel raisiny rum kick. Very smooth, rich and creamy mouthfeel. This beer is truly a thing of beauty! To say Hunahpu has a lot going on would be a understatement but the beauty of this stout is that each flavor holds its own a fits perfectly with the flow of this beer. 930 charactersMFMB, Apr 09, 2017

This jawn pours heady and smells like Mexican chorizo, cinnamon and black olive puree plus teriyaki sauce. Looks amazing indeed,  great head and retention. 
The taste is all bitter chocolate and dessert flavors... good but not terribly enticing. I lost interest about halfway through the bottle, even though I was sharing with a friend.
Too sweet, too chocolaty, too chili-y... not my cup of (beer) tea. 570 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Mar 24, 2017

2014 was the hands down favorite... years before that were beginning to fade, while years after were hot and needed some time.
I have had different bottles at different times and Huna is a treat beer. While I could down a bottle of, say, a Barrel-Aged Abraxas in one setting, Huna tends to be overwhelming sweet to me. It's a great beer, find a recent bottle... give it about two years in a cellar... and share with friends. 503 charactersshareallthebeer, Feb 20, 2017
4.37/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Wonderfully dark brew, with a modest dark brown head, quickly fading to an oily sheen atop the brew.
The aroma is enticing: huge molasses and licorice notes, cleaving through robust char and strong earthy hops.
Flavor isn't quite as sweet as the nose implied, nor do I get half of the ingredients promised. There's a distinctly vegetal note likely from the chilies, but little-to-no heat. Vanilla and chocolate get lost in the overall mix, and the cinnamon is nowhere to be found.
Body is full, thick, and creamy.
It's quite muddled overall, but it's also very, very tasty. At the end of the day, it's a big, strong, roasty, and bitter imperial stout. If I'm in the mood for a beer that represents the base ingredients better, I'm favoring Bomb! every time, especially for the hype and rarity surrounding this beer.  But if I happen to have a glass of this on hand?  I won't be complaining. 894 charactersRoguer, Feb 19, 2017

Decent stout body without alot of nice flavors to go with it. Flavor of the stout isnt even that nice, kind of bitter for my taste.

A: A beautiful rich black body with a dark mocha creamy looking head.
S: Deep rich fudge and roasty malts and a little cinnamon.
T: Lots of the chocolate and a ton of licorice 
M: Absolutely perfect rich creamy viscous thick absolutely coats the tongue and lingers.
O: The nose on this beer and the mouthfeel are out of this world. The taste is an absolute disappointment no cinnamon, no peppers, no vanilla just tons of licorice from being aged and a lot of chocolate. Hell there isn't even any heat from the chillis. Would love to try this fresh. 587 charactersSomethingClever, Dec 25, 2016

It had a smokiness to it as well that I have yet to taste in any other beer, but it just didn't taste good to me. My favorite stouts are founders breakfast and evils biscotti Imperial stout in case that gives you a frame of reference. Still, I was grateful to get to finally try it. 462 charactersiridius, Nov 06, 2016

Smell is a tad sweet and a bit underwhelming.
The taste is phenomenal -burnt expresso, dark chocolate with a very mild sweetness, rich dark fruit notes followed by just a touch of pepper more sweet paprika than jalapeno.
Mouth is near instantly coated. With mild agitation turns to velvet.

At Zwanze Day 2016, Green Bench Brewery, St Petersburg, Fla.  epic bottle share.
Finally got a change to try this. After hours of Cantillon and Saisons my pallet exploded with this. I knew it was one of the best flavored Stouts out there but wow it was even better then i ever imagined. Again probably helped by all the Sours i've been drinking all day.

A: Pours dark and thick with a finger's width of light brown head.
S: Cinnamon and cocoa
T:  Plenty of bitter chocolate and toasty coffee.  The cinamon hovers. In the background throughout.  The chillin become more pronounced as it warms.  There are hints of tobacco that seem to come and go.  There is some vanilla but it gets displaced by the heat.  There is a taste of prune throughout.  
MF: thick and chewy.  The cinamon and peppers leaves lingering burn. Tobacco tastes lingers as if one was smoking a fine cigar.   
O:  fantastic beer.  A great toasty stout that has a plethora of flavors competing for your taste buds.  So we'll done. 679 charactersSammyJaxxxx, Sep 05, 2016

Hits my snifter with a small ring of khaki head, very little lacing. Smell is initially a very rich chocolate. As it warms, getting a burst of cinnamon and an interesting green apple aroma. Hints of raw pepper heat, raisins and other various dark fruit. Following the nose well, a creamy lacto decadent chocolate comes through with subtle hints of pepper and a touch a vanilla. Mouthfeel is super palate coating and thick. Sticks around for a good while. 527 charactersMateo2699, Sep 04, 2016

Taste: yeah upfront lots of dark chocolate and dark roast coffee middle of the mouth bitersweet chocolate vanilla cinamon green apple skin a hint of dark fruit  finishes with some chille heat that sticks in the throat roast bitterness more dark chocolate and a slight hint of green pepper.
Feel: super thick and chewy it's a huge beer a definite siper. 
Overall: this beer is a lot of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee with just enough heat from the chillies. Best part of this beer is the mouthfeel it's as perfect as it gets for an imperial stout.  This is a really complex beer. Every sip I'm tasting something new. This is a beer worth seeking out and trading for! 783 charactersMasonz223, Aug 28, 2016

Didn't get an explosion of adjunct aromas either. They're well integrated into the fudgey body. Some spice, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa. It's pretty sweet, but I didn't find it overly so (at least not in sample pours). A beautiful stout, and worth the hype, I suppose. 363 charactersPDXAmbassador, Aug 24, 2016

S- Cocoa, bit of cinnamon and vanilla. Solid aroma.
T- Similar to the nose. Not a lot of dominant flavors. Basically no pepper heat.
F- Unimpressive. Thin, almost watery. We also cracked a Darkness and a Dark Lord, and they both poured and tasted a lot thicker. Smooth though and a little sticky.
O- Disappointing. Decent flavor and a pleasant aroma, but I like my stouts a lot thicker. I'd buy it off the shelf, but it takes a lot more effort than that to get it. 493 charactersZoomslowik, Aug 14, 2016

You don't just pop a bottle like this without reviewing it. I poured the bottle into a 12oz snifter and filled it 2/3 of the way up. Black. The head develops into a half inch of football colored sponge. That head lasts about a minute before there is no remnance of it besides a dark tan ring around the glass. I will get back to the nose later, as I have sampled this at a cooler temp than intended. Zero lace on the glass after the first big sip, but that might be the only tiny fault in the appearance, if there was one at all. The taste comes off as melted fudge. Sweet. Not nearly as spicy as I figured, but that was a nice surprise. Vanilla was lacking as well. Sip-by-sip this gets spicier and more flavors come up from the depths. Maybe not "more", just more pronounced as this monster warms up. Very slick on the tongue and just simply easy to drink for the ABV that is barely even present. Awesome brew! 940 charactersLloydDobler, Jul 15, 2016

Most stouts are described as pouring like motor oil, but this thing is legit.  It's so thick and creamy with just a touch of carbonation and head lacing. The spices are strong in the smell and leads you to think it'll be a spice bomb with overt sweetness.  However, the taste is phenomenal and extremely well balanced.  There's cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee;  none are overpowering.  There's just a touch of sweetness balanced by a great bittering finish.
For once, a beer lives up to the hype.  I will be getting my hands on as many of these as I can. 627 charactersnawpnawp, Jun 02, 2016
4.42/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.252014 bottle - poured into a taster glass. Smells like cinnamon graham crackers, hints of vanilla and cocoa and paprika. Taste is up-front vanilla and chocolate, followed swiftly by a medley of cinnamon / mild pepper / bitter chocolate characters that linger for some time. Mouthfeel is pretty silky and a little thin, but still plenty of body. Overall, glad to have been able to finally try this storied beer. I'd love to taste a newer batch to compare. 453 charactersRothobinide, Jun 01, 2016

Smells like chocolate and vanilla (pepper is really hard to smell), with vanilla staying in the nose the longest. But when you get to drinking it, it's a whole different beast. RICH dark chocolate with coffee and a bit of a peppery sensation on the back of the tongue. Sweetness comes out after warming up a bit, but the front of flavors is chocolate. The feel is rich and thick. Overall, amazing beer and worth everything I gave up for one. So damn good. 499 charactersfrontrangefart, May 07, 2016

Dark crude oil color, brown head slowly dissipates to a thin but sticky lacing. Aromas of over-caramelized cinnamon buns, chocolate, mild dark fruit, and a roasty maltiness. Sweet throughout but there is so much going on here it simply is the perfect and complex Imperial Stout base. Cinnamon and chilies really pop, cocoa nibs and a fine layer of chocolate and meld well with the sweetness, vanilla adds some depth, and the alcohol really round this brew out with floral and dark fruit undertones. Clearly a sipper, a fun one at that. Its quite obvious this is one of those bucket list beers. Well worth hunting a bottle of few down. 686 charactersJason, Apr 17, 2016
3.96/5  rDev -12.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75750ml bottle, 2016 release, poured into a Cigar City "Cursive Hunahpu" snifter glass.
The beer pours out super thick and viscous, jet black with a thick caramel colored head with good legs and retention leaving spots of lace behind. The aroma is bursting of chocolate cake, rich grains, light cinnamon and vanilla bean with some stone fruits and a touch of pepper heat. The nose is super rich and decadent, very inviting. The flavors boom with chocolate cake and brownie batter, cinnamon, more pronounced pepper heat that adds some depth and complexity but really dries the beer out, mild vanilla bean with roasted grain that linger with some stone fruits. The mouthfeel is very dry but coating, very silky and smooth, chewy with a warm finish. 
Verdict: A nice spiced stout from Cigar City, great chocolate flavors and tame heat that adds some nice flavor. That being said, compared to many other stouts with chili peppers, this one is super dry and it detracts from how rich the aroma was. 993 characterskevanb, Apr 17, 2016

I'm currently sitting at the Cigar City Brewery in Tampa, FL drinking from a 2014 vintage bottle and I'm blown away. Has the recipe drastically changed or did 2 and a half years work that much wonder on this beer? I'm not sure, but I'm editing my rating to reflect the level of degree that my mind was blown into. This is an amazing stout that deserves the praise bestowed upon it. It's complexity is intense. It's sweet, hot, sour, and savory. Thank you CCB for the experience. 586 charactersMJSFS, Apr 04, 2016

 Even though I've never had this beer before the taste from what I know is a giveaway there is a nice spice taste with lots of cinnamon coming through. Nice balance with the roasted malts with some chocolate overtones for sure.
 The mouthfeel is smooth just the right amount of carbonation for this great beer.
 As I've let this beer warm in my glass it has gotten nothing but better. 538 characterssmanson56, Apr 03, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Very dark black, with an amazingly dense and dark yet vibrantly bright mocha brown two finger head that dies to a persistent collar.
Huna is so nutty and roasty up front on the nose, both of malt and roasted pepper, with a little milk chocolate and bright, fruity, dark chocolate and pepper coming forward in a big way shortly after. Only light cinnamon is detectable in the background and actually hints at a little salty soy.
Milky, nutty, roasted malt flavors smoothly transfer over with the dark chocolate and maybe a little vanilla as well. It's refreshing that stout comes first and the supplemental flavors come second. Some heat tickles the tongue that I at first thought was due to the big, freshly grated cinnamon flavor, but maybe it was the chilis kicking in--they were a little spicier than I thought they would be, probably too much for some but all right for me. The chili heat is actually not too detectable at first, and really only shows up in the back of throat, but builds over time. The actual flavor of chili seems to both be complex and roasted as well as a little fruity, like strawberry. It even seems a little oaky at times, hinting that a little barrel influence might even enhance this.
Hunahpu has a nice, soft and frothy mouthfeel, and is quite thick, with some drying cinnamon, but it's not a spice bomb like other chili beers. 1,361 charactersSabtos, Apr 02, 2016
4.3/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Rating #500 for me. Excited to try this, as I'm a big fan of spiced stouts. Hoping it lives up to its reputation.
A: Jet black, with one finger of dark brown head. Basically looks exactly like Marshal Zhukov. 4.75/5.
S: Roast, chocolate, and...honestly, not much else. Not getting much in the way of vanilla or spices. Kind of surprised, as some of my favorite spiced stouts have much more pepper on the nose. Expected the heat to be more visible. If this was a non-adjunct stout, it would be 4.5/5, but I'm not getting the adjuncts like I thought I would. 4/5.
T: Once again, the adjuncts aren't nearly as pronounced as I expected. This beer is delicious, thanks to its A+ level base beer. The peppers are there on the finish, but there isn't really heat. More of a prickly spice. THe cinnamon may be the most pronounced adjunct. All together, the adjuncts are quite balanced, but somewhat subdued as well. 4.25/5.
M: This has the same viscosity and mouthfeel as MZ, and I love it. I've never had a stout with a better mouthfeel than this and MZ. 5/5.
O: A delicious beer that I would be happy to drink anytime. I wish the adjuncts were more pronounced, but this is a minor complaint. 4.25/5. 1,198 charactersKevinL, Apr 02, 2016

4.95/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I had both the 2014 and 2016 version at Cigar City.  
Pours inky black and THICK with a thin tan head.
The smell is incredible - vanilla, cinnamon, bitter chocolate, pepper heat, atop an amazing Imperial Stout base of roasted malts.  The 2014 version smelled sweeter, with less pepper and spices, and more of a milk chocolate characteristic.
Taste is unbelievable.  The backbone is this great Imperial Stout flavor, but on top is chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Mild pepper heat on the back end.  Again, the 2014 version was for more mellow on the spices but equally good.
Mouthfeel is thick and oily.  The peppers liven it up if you let it linger.
This is my favorite beer to date, BY FAR.  I decline to give it a perfect review since I might come across something better someday. 789 characters2014LM2X1, Mar 28, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -0.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5"In Mayan mythology, Hun Hunahpu was the father of the Mayan hero twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque. Hun Hunahpu, along with his brother Vucub Hunahpu, was tricked by the Dark Lors of the underworld and slain. Hun Hunahpu's corpse morphed into a cacao tree, his head becoming a cacao pod, which in typically asesome mythology fashion, spit upon the hand of a young maiden named Xiquic who promptly became pregnant with the hero twins. The twins would uptiumately grow up to avenge their father and uncle and defeat the Dark Lords and ascend the heavens to become the moon and sun." Brewed in the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout, available in 750ml. bottles and on limited draft. Annual brewery-only release, this is the 2014 version.
Poured from a 750ml. bottle to a snifter glass.
(Appearance) Pours a crisp foamy head of a dark chocolate tone over a black body. Retention is average and there is no visible lacing. 3.75
(Smell) Moderate roasted malt, chocolate, faded vanilla, sweet cinnamon, faint pepper heat, some slight oxidation. Still a very enjoyable aroma, a bit tame with a moderate potency. 4.25
(Taste) Incredible blend of smooth and rich stout flavors. Spicy cinnamon and vanilla atop a delectable malt body of cocoa, moderate roasted barley, pale malt syrups and smooth caramel syrups. Finishes with a touch of tingle on the tongue from the chili peppers and also a phenomenal smoothness, surprisingly clean with a well-concealed alcohol presence. Highly drinkable, yet satisfactorily filling. Incredibly enjoyable and a great treat to split with a special somebody (although you'd better be sure that they are VERY special). 4.75
(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, moderately chewy, lightly sticky, mildly dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a medium frothiness and a mildly crisp finish. Body is medium+ for the style, heavy overall. Balance is slightly sweet over earthy and roasted bitter and spicy (very subtle). Alcohol presence is mild and there are no off characters. 4.5
(Overall) Although I think I'd recall bottles of Hunahpu display their flavor range somewhat better at a younger age, I saved this one in particular for a very special occasion, the big review #950 and was not at all let down. Holds up incredibly well through a reasonable window of time, incredible stout base but many of the adjuncts thrown in with it are what takes this beer to the next level. The cinnamon and vanilla come through nicely and create a nice degree of richness and complexity atop the expected and solid stout flavors. Even the delicate spiciness generated from the chili peppers create an appreciated dimension of balance that one may have never known was needed in a stout but works great in this beer regardless. A great dessert beer or all around Imperial Stout, there's never been a regret in getting a bottle of this- It lives up to the hype. A no-brainer annual event to visit if you live in Florida, let's just say I had a "wild" time in March 2014 there (who can forget that day?). 4.5

No light passing through this bad boy. Not much on the nose, some chocolate, maybe a bit of cinnamon, fair amount of booze. The taste is wonderful, like a delicious chocolate shake. Tons of cocoa, nice amount of vanilla and cinnamon, don't get much from the peppers. Incredibly smooth with a really long finish of bittersweet chocolate. Mouth feel is great. Overall just a great beer. I've had it on draft now (several years) and a bunch of the varietals. Meets the hype, or most of it a least. 610 characterstmentzer, Mar 26, 2016

The head dissipates completely and almost immediately and there isn't a single spot of lacing. Smell is the only draw back only because I thought it would be stronger, but it is still amazing and this bottle is about a year old. The rich chocolate, roasted malts really stand out with a nice mix of cinnamon and peppers as well. Taste is everything I hoped it would be and more. A great blend of sweet chocolate and roasted malt that give off a little hint of coffee up front, then mid sip the vanilla takes over with the cinnamon and a touch of heat from the peppers making for the perfect finish. Feel is perfect for a stout. Thick, full bodied and very viscous. Overall lives up to/exceeds the hype. This beer is phenomenal! 838 charactersCNoj012, Mar 10, 2016

To be honest, until recently I was never a big fan of the beer.  Maybe my palette changed or I had a really good batch but I finally had what I think is an excellent imperial stout.  What hit me this time was the cinnamon and touch of heat working so well with so many flavors of chocolate, coffee, smoke and more.  I never realized how complex this beer tastes.  I really enjoyed drinking this beer and will seek it out for now on.
Having it again on 5/8/16.  I'm raising the look to a 5.  I know this sounds ridiculous, but it has the best looking dark foam for a head. This beer is true luxury! 663 charactersELS, Feb 14, 2016

Consumed with a dark gumbo.
The nose is chilis and chocolate.
Taste is same but with some great dark cherry flavor creeping in. Well balanced. Dry finish.
Mouthfeel incredibly thick. Wow!
As a St. Louis boy, it pains me to say, but this is better than abraxas, mainly because the cinnamon is overpowering in abraxas imo. Great job, cigar city. Hope to try a ba version someday! 393 charactersbennyman12, Feb 08, 2016

4.79/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 1 pint 9.4 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's tap room snifter. Would have used my Cigar City snifter, but it's too small for this giant bottle. Bottled on 1/14/15, making this just over a year old, but still only 10 months after the last Hunahpu's Day. 
A: Pours pitch black, motor oil thick, with an amazing luscious dark brown 1-finger head. Very beautiful beer. 
S: Very complex. Lots of cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, rum-soaked white cake. Just a hint of pepper skin in the back. Faint, faint notes of dark fruits as well.
T: Hugely complex here, but that's expected when there's this many ingredients. Right up front is that cinnamon wave, followed by rich vanilla and chocolate layering. The peppers come through in the finish with that lingering heat. Certainly not hot, with just the right kick from the peppers. Everything is layered here, much like in a dessert, and it works beautifully. 
M: Rich, full mouthfeel. Exactly what I want in my Imperial Stouts. Alcohol is hidden very well. Great, great balance with all the ingredients, nothing overpowering.
O: Big thanks to pcstuck for this one. I've been chasing this guy for quite some time. Made it out to Cigar City a couple years ago and fell in love with the place. Don't know if I'll ever make a Hunahpu's Day, so I had to get one when the opportunity struck. For me, this beer lives up to all the hype and legend surrounding it. In terms of the genre, being the Mexican Hot Chocolate style, it's right up there with the best. This is how I like my Imperial Stouts, with lots of character and flavor. From beginning to end, this one is a stunner. Very rich, decadent, layered and complex. 
Recommendation: One of the legends, a must-try. 1,723 charactersSparty1224, Jan 24, 2016

I was expecting much more heat on this one, something similar to that of Mexican Cake.  I was pleasantly surprised by its smoothness.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that the bottle had been aged (2014); nevertheless, I was pleased.  Chocolate dominates the palate, though hints of cinnamon and pepper undertones fight for some recognition. Mouthfeel was silky smooth. Overall, I am pleased with this one.  Wish I had more. 455 charactersDolphinsmarlins1, Jan 08, 2016

S: Aroma is sweet but difficult to discern. Elements of cocoa powder, deep, dark fruit juice and sweet malts.
T: Taste is dominated by dark chocolate fudge or brownie. The flavor is not as complex as expected but the finish does provide a flash of heat as the liquid clears the palate.
M: Feel on this one is in line with the appearance. Nice and thick yet smooth and silky going down.

Just enough heat to make it exciting but it doesn't linger on the palate which allows you to enjoy the nibs, vanilla and cinnamon that follows.  Awesome brew!

It pours jet black and almost looks like motor oil. Very little head when poured into the snifter. The smell is somewhat sweet with aromas of vanilla, cinnamon and chilies. For a flavored stout, you get the sweet taste to start and finishes with cocoa and vanilla flavors, as well as some heat from the chilies. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth. Overall, this is a complex beer but super delicious; one to savor for sure! In my opinion, this one lives up to the hype, cheers! 583 characterstregan_20, Nov 03, 2015

Pours like motor oil from a 750 ml bottle.  Thick viscous and syrup scent of fudge brownies and cinnamon wafts from the snifter could this actually be above the hype...
Taste is decadent brownies with cinnamon and spice just the right amount on everything and mixed together the way you wish you had a Mexican grandma to make brownies for you
Feel is nice and mouth covering don't want to stop drinking this 
Overall near perfect stout and the spice just makes everything so sinfully delicious and decadent.  Like I just had my way with a brownie that fell into a can of Mexican spiced chocolates. 620 characterskerry4porters, Oct 24, 2015

Smell is right on with vanilla, chocolate, and oaky booze. I may get a bit of orange too. The taste is much the same as the smell. As it warms I get more of the chili. It feels luscious. Overall it was a tasty, fun beer. This was my first beer from Cigar City and am looking forward to the next one.

750ml bottle with my Stone IRS snifter glass
2014 release -Big thanks to Doppelbockulus for hooking me up with this!
A:  Looks quite viscous on the pour and settles in the glass just like a 5W-30 motor oil would.  A smallish layer of dark mocha brown head forms for a few moments before falling away to a small crown.  Very minimal stick or lace with exception of a few specks here and there.  My guess is there is a bit of oil from all of the adjuncts that are hampering the head retention.  Still dark and impy looking none the less.
S:  Dark and earthy with deep roasted barley aromas rolling into raisin, molasses, dark tobacco, sun dried chilies, bitter chocolates, espresso, and assorted kitchen spices.  Some subtle sweet booze emits in the finish.  Quite complex and different.  Like a Mexican Mole dish only a slightly different take.  With everything going on here all the main characters do reveal which is great.   
T:  The flavor is very earthy as well with a deep roasted malt signature invoking espresso bean, chocolate covered raisin and cherry vanilla, molasses, and a light rendering of smoky tobacco.   A mild chili heat sinks in midstream and carries through this deep chili roast earthiness on through to the finish.  Seems to only add another layer of depth to all the roastiness here.  Overall this is a sweeter stout but with those savory notes mixed in and a bit of warming spice that emerges as the beer warms up to room temp.  There is a nice constricting amount of bitter hops here to help bring all the malt sugars in check.  A lot to process but it is well crafted and comes together nicely.  
M:  Full bodied with a silky feel.  Not quite syrupy to me as this is super smooth and viscous across the tongue.  A moderately high amount of bitterness keeps it lightened with a nice peppering effect.  There is a light dryness in the finish with some warming alcohol and a sleek aftermath.
D:  A truly awesome brew and glad to have tried.  Very unique and probably the best Non-BA stout I have had.  Thing is this is not something I want to drink a whole lot of. While I can definitely appreciate the Hunah for what it is I found it somewhat difficult to kill the bottle solo.  I need some better friends. 2,263 charactersNugganooch, Oct 17, 2015

3.85/5  rDev -14.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4BOTTLE: Acquired in a trade. March 14th, 2015 vintage. 750ml (I think). Classy label design. Branded pry-off crown cap.
Expectations are sky-high given how much I loved Marshal Zhukov's. Served lightly chilled into stemware. Reviewed live as an imperial stout per the label.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: About 1-1.5 inches wide. Gorgeous tan colour. Creamy and full, with a gorgeous soft consistency and a good complexion. Retention is excellent for the high ABV - about 5 minutes. Leaves no lacing as it recedes.
BODY: Opaque solid black colour. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
It's a good looking imperial stout, but it's not unique or special looking.
AROMA: Attractive genuine vanilla beans (with no artificiality at all), faint cacao nibs, very restrained chilis (to the extent that I don't know I'd pick up on them if I had this in a blind tasting), dark malts lending the perfect amount of sweetness, subtle cinnamon, and maybe some chocolate malt.
It's not as expressive or deep an aroma as I hoped, but its subtlety is impressive and I find the chilis emerging more and more as it warms. Cocoa powder also emerges.
Aromatic intensity is below average.
No overt hops, yeast, off-notes, or booze are/is detectable.
TASTE & TEXTURE: The mouthfeel is near perfect, boasting a silky softness and an almost velvety presence on the palate that allows the subtle heat of the chilis (which is maybe a 2/10 in terms of intensity) to mount. Slightly powdery and tingly, bringing out the lightly coarse cinnamon spice. Cream.
The smoothness and wetness of the beer is ideal. Dark malts bring the perfect amount of sweetness. This is neither slick on the palate nor cloying. Carbonation is perfect. Aptly medium to full-bodied. I love that it's not a dessert beer, and that it's not too ashen or charred. Caramelization isn't too high.
The build is intricate, with intriguing notes of cacao nibs, vanilla beans, chilis, and cinnamon. Very balanced. As much as I like it, the depth of flavour isn't as impressive as it could be, and I hoped for a more expressive beer.
Blakelive784 suggests an oily mouthfeel, and I concur. He also notes that the roasted barley covers the acrid bitterness a bit, which dries out the mouthfeel, but I don't notice much roasted barley myself, and I find the hints of dryness in the mouthfeel well-tailored to the style and flavour profile. The thickness and heft on the palate is right on the money, though. The texture doesn't elevate the beer as a whole, but it complements it well.
There's not quite a marriage of texture and taste, but the mouthfeel is clearly designed well - and tailored to the flavour profile. Lighty chewy and somewhat viscous without being syrupy.
Constructively, the vanilla bean - nice as it is - is a bit too reticent.
OVERALL: A great sipper, but not a beer I'd want to drink a whole bottle of (even though it isn't too dessert-like or filling). The subtlety of the chili heat is a highlight, and it's incredibly well built for an imperial stout, but in terms of this niche I might prefer a beer like Copper Kettle's Mexican Chocolate Stout. Absolutely well worth trying, and another treat from Cigar City, but in terms of their straight imperial stout offerings, I prefer Marshal Zhukov's.

Pours jet black with a small-sized brown head.  Delicious smell of cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, and coffee.  Tastes of roasted malt, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, and ends with a mild chili pepper zing.  Less cinnamon in the taste.  The alcohol is hidden well under the complex and bold flavors.  Low carbonation and heavy body; really nails the style.  Overall, it's a fantastic adjunct IS worth getting your hands on at Hunahpu's Day. 517 charactersalarmclock314, Aug 23, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my new favorite beer. Poured the 2014, shared with a friend. Very complex, poured cold and sat outside. Sipped slowly to let let warm up. Initially you taste intense chocolate and cinnamon, but as it warms up you begin to taste the coffee and vanilla, and by the time the beverage was at room temperature all of these flavors dissipated and the chili flavor really started to hit. As of this writing, this is the best beer I have ever had. 447 charactersCharlesK, Aug 17, 2015

Again adds to the attractiveness of the beer.   Smells of rich malt, chocolate, and cocoa. Nice silky smooth mouthfeel with low carbonation to enhance the flavors.  Wonderful initial notes of cocoa powder, bitter chocolate, little bit of cinnamon spice and sweetness. Lots of rich coffee and charred malt character to it as well. Outstanding finish and representation of vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate and malt. 518 charactersAlequine, Aug 16, 2015

Warmth (from both chili and booze) comes back slightly after the swallow.   Nice silky creamy feel with a decently low carbonation.  A bit sticky too. 483 charactersBugs318, Jul 31, 2015

Look: this beer pours like motor oil, described at a tasting as "alien blood." Not terribly viscous but dark, dark, dark in color. 
Smell: chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and other spices. 
Taste: the nose throws everything off on this beer. What I get upfront is a blast of molasses, cinnamon, and raisins with little else. There are subtle hints of chocolate and coffee. No vanilla left on this one. Not a whole lot of other flavor felt after the sweet, sugary blast. Overall, it was kind of like an oatmeal cookie. 
Feel: a standard good stout, viscous and full-bodied. 
Overall: very good. Probably the sweetest of the big stout releases I have had. After two plus years, the vanilla and spices have fallen off, which might have made a fresh bottle taste better. For me, it's worth picking up a bottle of this guy if you can get a fair, dollar for dollar trade, but given what the folks in Florida demand for this non-barreled version, I will likely pass on future releases. Worth trying once, not a unique enough beer for me to have to repeat. 1,062 charactersrodmanfor3, Jul 21, 2015

A — Pours a deeply rich black color, with some dark brown hues around the edges. Dark and thick looking in the glass, there is a light layer of foam on top of it that leaves behind some sticky lacing.
S — Smells of rich charred malts, chocolates, and coffee. Major sweet and sugary vanilla character, without being cloying or off-putting. Little bit of chili heat underneath it all, but its really just a peppery brightness to balance out the sweetness.
T — Excellent depth of flavors and exceedingly complex. Wonderful initial notes of cocoa powder, bitter chocolate, little bit of cinnamon spice and sweetness. Lots of rich coffee and charred malt character to it as well. Little bit of a peppery bitter undertone. Rally great representation of vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate and malt. Just fantastic.
M — Medium-Full bodied, long and lingering finish.
O — Well, this thing lives up to the hype, it's just that simple, this is a world class beer, through and through. 1,008 charactersMoose90, Jul 15, 2015

The taste follows and has a full-blown blast of roasted malt as an end note. Coupled with the chiles, the roasted flavor along with the chocolate lets off a hint of smoke. Feel is very nice and smooth. Maybe a hint of earthy hops in the finish that go along with the general smoke and earth of the malt flavors. A bit of sweetness lingers in the finishes and rubs up and kisses the vanilla a bit. For a brief second, I get a vinous vibe. 
I had the 2011 version a few years ago and the 2014 delivers the same. This beer is a monster in the best way possible; a whale of a beer that actually carries the weight of its hype. 838 charactersZraly, Jul 03, 2015

Totally deserving of the reputation it has, Hunahpu is big, smash-your-face-in, complex, multi-faceted, and an American beer legend. Only ding is that it's way too limited and too limited to get your hands on it. Cigar City has gotten so popular that I can't even buy Marshal Zhukov like I used to, but them's the breaks. Great beer that is worth trying if you ever get the chance. 530 charactersmilkbaby9, Jul 02, 2015

I was fortunate enough to taste DB Huna and Cali Brandy Huna during tastings.    Both of those were orgasmic, the regular was a very different beer to me.   The 2015 bottle I enjoyed was less spicy than its BA brothers, but just as good.   The one criticism I had was the spice wasn't forward enough, I tasted very strong chocolate up front with a light pepper kick at the end.    Enjoyed out of a snifter at 45 degrees over the course of an hour and a half. 530 characterstmbgnicu, Jun 24, 2015

A bit on the cold side, but maybe a faint metallic whiff mixed in with cinnamon and cocoa.  Chocolate and cinnamon dominate the flavor.  Maybe a slight prickle from the pepper, but not hot by any means.  Pleasantly thick mouthfeel for a non-BA stout.  This beer seems to cry out for a barrel.  Overall a strong offering, but perhaps I expected too much after drinking the revelation that was DBH. 514 charactersThirsty_In_Chicago, Jun 05, 2015

Smell brings to mind soy sauce. As it warms up the chocolate comes through more.
Taste brings out the vanilla, chili, and chocolate. It's really awesome. Strong malt flavor, no discernible hop character. As it warms up the chocolate and pepper become more pronounced.
Full bodied and thick. Not at all cloying. Perfect mouthfeel.
Overall, definitely lives up to the hype. 441 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, May 12, 2015

The taste is very chocolatey with a decent amount of vanilla.  I am definitely not a fan of cinnamon in my beer.  Very slight heat from the chiles.  Well intergrated, just not my favorite. 351 charactersWI-Beer-Man, May 11, 2015

One of my favorite non-BA stouts.  Pours dark black with a small khaki head.  Little carbonation.  Smells of cocoa and vanilla, a bit of sweet molasses as well as a decent alcohol presence.  Tastes smooth and rich.  Lots of dark chocolate, fudge and mocha.  Vanilla beans make it even smoother.  Just a touch of cinnamon and a nice even heat on the aftertaste from the peppers.  Just an outstanding stout all around. 451 charactersEveningCordial, May 06, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Pours a pitch black with no light able to penetrate at any point. Thick dark brown one half finger head that recedes to a lacing relatively quickly. Beautiful looking beer.
Smell: Very complex, even when still cold. I smell a lot of bitter chocolate up front followed with a dose of vanilla. Good amount of sweetness from the vanilla. The smell alone is intoxicating.
Taste: Everything comes through here! This is simply amazing. Chocolate and vanilla just punch your tongue. Its amazing how much these flavors come out in this beer! At the end of the sip I taste the little twang from the chili peppers. Cinnamon flavor does not particularaly stand out to me. The beer is not overly sweet but the base seems like a great stout as well.
Mouthfeel: The best part of the beer! So thick and motor oil like. Great heavy body but still some nice carbonation on the tongue.
Overall: This beer is FULLY deserving of the hype it gets! Amazing. I am considering traveling to the release party one of these days. This is the best stout I have ever had hands down. So complex, there is so much going on but it melds together perfectly! 1,140 characterslanciloti, Apr 29, 2015

Poured thick, black, oily, very little head. Great aroma, subtle chile spice. First sips while still cold were all chocolate. As it warmed up a lot more complexity came through, no heat but some chile flavor, not much cinnamon, just good balance.

Smell had licorice, molasses, vanilla, chocolate and a hint of cinnamon.  Taste is very layered, and complex. Get waves of baker's and milk chocolate, red licorice, vanilla, brown sugar, and a dry cinnamon and chile finish.  Mouthfeel is substantial and oily. This beer really leaves it's mark.  Overall this is an outstanding beer. I think I might like chile kick of a Prairie Bomb a bit more, but this is a more complex treat. 521 charactersOneEye78, Apr 11, 2015

As soon as the bottle was open all I got was cinnamon raisin toast, seriously. This is not a bad thing, but it was was way more dark fruit than past offerings.
Everything was spot on, great nose, excellent head retention, outstanding mouthfeel.
I will open another bottle in 6-8 months and see how much this beer changes overtime and will update this review. 460 charactersyoubrewidrink, Apr 03, 2015

4.51/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A big thanks to BA rongcsc for sending this bottle to me in trade. As a lover of the "Mayan Imperial Stout" substyle, I've long wanted to sample Huna to see how it compared to the other beers of high repute in the style. This bottle is the 2015 vintage, bottled just a couple short weeks ago. Poured into a small Cigar City Belgian-style tulip glass.
Appearance (4.25) - Off to a good start, a moderate pour reveals an inky black liquid with tendencies towards dark brown and yields a slowly-developing head that tops out at about a finger thick of dark sepia colored foam. Retention is moderate, with the bubbles sticking around for a minute or so before receding to reveal a ringlet and a smattering of film across the surface of the liquid. Benath, the liquid is unforgivingly dark and impossible for light to pass through. Lacing is sparse and almost nonexistent.
Smell (4.5) - Straight out of the fridge, I'm wondering what the hell is going on. Notes of roasted malt and chocolate, and subtle hints of vanilla are present, with just the faintest suggestion of cinnamon and spice. However, by the time this reaches room temperature, the invitees have all arrived at the party, with a balanced blend of chocolate cake and baking spice, cinnamon and an underlying presence of roasted malt are all present. Nothing stands out, but in some ways, that's impressive in and of itself.
Taste (4.5) - Much like the smell, the various elements are all at play in moderate proportions. I'd say baker's chocolate is the predominant characteristic, but it certainly doesn't overpower the cinnamon and now, for the first time I get a subtle kiss of heat from the chiles. With each subsequent drink, that gentle heat builds cumulatively--I imagine consuming this quickly would end up with a pretty fiery mouth. Worth noting, I recently had the 2014 as well, and the extra year brings the vanilla much more to the forefront, increasing the sweetness of this already sweet stout by a considerable amount. We're not anywhere near Vanilla Rye levels of vanilla sweetness, but I'm a little surprised at how prevalent it is on the year-old vintage.
Mouthfeel (4.75) - Full-bodied and with moderate to low carbonation. Viscous and chewy, like a good imperial stout should be. Finish is semisweet and lingering.
Overall (4.5), a superbly done beer, although I must admit a personal preference to Abraxas because I love the cinnamon bomb element of Abraxas. But for those not as cinnamon-obsessed, this might be the best of the "Big Three" cinnamon/chocolate/pepper imperial stouts. The vanilla separates it from Mexican Cake and Abraxas, but that inclusion doesn't really rear its head as much in the fresh beer as it does once it gets some age on it. 2,738 charactersLambicPentameter, Apr 01, 2015

Appearance: deep mahogany, almost black in color. 1 finger of a tannish head with decent retention. not much of a lacing but some viscosity to it. completely opaque and dark.
Smell: strong cinnamon mixed with fruits, dark and light (definitely get notes of apple.) big notes of chocolate fudge and other varieties of cocoa. coffee, somewhere between light roast and mocha. some booze
Taste: opens with notes of apple brandy along with cinnamon. booziness comes through pretty quickly. cocoa varieties comes through strong along with some fudge. this blends into a mocha or perhaps a light roasted coffee. 
Mouthfeel: slick and viscous, heat from both booze and spice.
Overall: no doubt one of the kings of the spice stouts, but I'd take a standard, non-ba stout of similar proportions almost any day. tasting the three side by side was nice, the fresh and year old were both very good but a bit different in balance and the two year old had fallen off completely and tasted turrible. 1,033 charactersSportsandJorts, Mar 31, 2015

The usual roastiness and chocolate of a high end example of the style is all there but I am also greeted with a zany mixture of heat and cinnamon spice. The flavor brings forth more of the same flavor intricacies. Thick chocolate and roasted coffee followed by a peppy chili heat. Not overly hot but the heat tickles the back of the tongue. The cinnamon is also very easy to detect and I admittedly enjoy this more than what the chills give off. Thick bodied. Lingering aftertaste. I find some noticeable bitterness. A lot going on in this revered brew. I was not in love with all of it but there is surely plenty to find appealing. 736 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 22, 2015

Appearance: It has a beautiful viscous jet black color to it. It has a nice creamy dark tan head that dies down moderately slowl and leaves light lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of sweet dark fruit upfront, some molasses, roasted malts, cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla, cinnamon and faint chilies in the back. This things smells amazing!
Taste: Like the aromas, it has loads it has a lot of dark fruit and molasses sweetness upfront followed by tones of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee. The vanilla, cinnamon and chilies are still there but a bit more faint than the rest. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low-med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. This is definitely up there with my top Stouts. Cigar City never ceases to amaze me. Keep em coming!

4.69/5  rDev +4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This is a review of the 2014, I hope I can land a 2015 to see if there is any difference in age.
Appearance: Like pouring dark thick syrup out of the bottle. Very little head in the beginning and then fades to nothing by the end.
Aroma: Not as dramatic as I would have expected it to be. Maybe its the age, maybe its my nose, but it smells almost identical to Marshal Zhukov's. Lots of molasses and sweeter notes some dark fruits, not really noticing the adjuncts though.
Taste: Alright here is where the adjuncts come through! Still strong vanilla and molasses taste are dominant, very reminiscent of MZ, but here is the kicker, you get the burn on the back of the tongue and then it spreads to the entire tongue. Very cool! 
Overall: Very well made beer. Glad I had the chance to try it, I would love to try a fresh bottle to see if the adjuncts hold a more robust flavor. Someone noted that the heat had faded from the peppers, but that is one note that I can certainly say has not. Very nicely done Cigar City! 1,018 charactershumuloner22, Mar 14, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The aroma is cinnamon, chocolate, chilies, vanilla - exactly as advertised. Right away I can tell this is a super complex and intense beer. The taste follows the nose with huge chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon notes. Its such a big beer and sets the standard for mouth feel. The beer is coating the glass and my mouth. I can taste this beer 5 minutes after taking a sip because it coats the mouth and throat so heavily. Chilies have faded after a year, but still remain prominent in the nose and the heat builds as the beer coats the mouth and throat. It pours with almost zero head and that counts against it is the look department, but its hard to find anything wrong with this beer. Edit: 2015 version has less cinnamon. Adjusted scores on aroma and taste. 759 charactersdanh53, Feb 22, 2015

One of the blackest pours i've seen. The minimal head is a very dark brown with burnt red hues. Aroma has pepper, chocolate and vanilla.
Flavor is unique and stands out from other Imperial stouts. Chilies start off the taste, leaves than returns in the finish. Rather than give heat, it lends the actual flavor of the pepper, can almost imagine biting into one. Among that is the cocoa and the cinnamon drops a bit of flavor but lends much more to the texture and feel. Very happy to have tried this! 543 characterspapat444, Feb 20, 2015

Opaque black body with a tan head that settles but leaves good lacing for such a high ABV brew. Aroma is cocoa, coffee, pepper, cinnamon, and dark malt. Taste is off-the-charts good - sweet chocolate, vanilla, and malt; bitter spice and coffee; subtle chili pepper and booze warmth. Full body, thick, creamy texture, soft but appropriate carbonation, warming boozy finish. 547 charactersSierraFlight, Feb 12, 2015

A. Black color, silky and thick. Minimal fine-bubble head that's slightly amber, retreats to a minimal rim. Moderate viscosity.
S. Coffee beans, coco, dark roasted malts, and hazelnuts combine for a complex nose. Strange minor notes of hoisin sauce, vanilla, and spicy peppers come through as it warms. A little boozy.
T. The taste follows the nose in a nice way. Roasted flavors of the espresso and malts hit first, then the peppers create a little spice as it opens. Not much heat, nice and subtle. A hoppy bitterness results from the coffee. I pick up on the cinnamon at the end.
M. My favorite part of this beer. Thick and silky, and very smooth. Highly viscous, and full body.
O. Obviously this beer had huge expectations and it lived up to the hype. Cigar City hit a home run with this beast and it's easy to say this is a very well crafted beer. I typically prefer bourbon barrel aged stouts, but his is just fine without being aged in barrel. Now I wonder what a barrel would do to this and feel maybe this is better without. 1,147 charactersmacher0, Feb 07, 2015

Taste of cinnamon becomes more apparent as the beer warms up and it adds the perfect amount of spice. Heat from the chilis does not linger and is pleasant, not overpowering. All in all it is a world class brew and cannot wait to open my second bottle on a special occasion. You will not be disappointed if you enjoy this style of brew. Even if you are not a fan of spiced stouts you will probably enjoy this. Chocolate hints, cinnamon perfection and a mouthfeel that balances on perfect. 550 charactersTigheC, Feb 04, 2015

I was very excited to try this beer, and courtesy of a fellow beer nerd and friend who moved to Florida in the last year, I was finally able to acquire this mythical beer.  It pours jet black and has very little head, a little bit formed at the tail end of the pour but that was it.  The smell is moderately sweet and smells like a blend of cinnamon, vanilla, & a hint of chilies.  NOW... the most important part: the taste.  This beer is extremely well balanced, especially for a flavored stout.  At first you get a sweet taste that incorporates the chilies and cinnamon, which transitions into a slightly bitter cocoa taste before finishing with a smooth vanilla.  The mouthfeel can be described in one word: smooth.  For as complex as this beer is, it is incredibly smooth.  I recommend anyone without direct access to this beer to do everything you can do to arrange a trade, It's worth about 95% of the insane amount of hype it gets, which is quite an accomplishment. 1,009 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Jan 28, 2015

S- Lots of Chocolate and some vanilla and rum notes. As for the chilis, I can pick up very slight dried ancho aromas that blend with the chocolate. Cinnamon starts presenting itself as the beer warms up, and adds a nice spice note. 
T- Follows the nose. Chocolate is up front and incredible. Then in the middle of the palate the vanilla and rum notes present themselves. As the beer warms the cinnamon kind of starts presenting itself and it is really complementary to all of the other ingredients. Chili takes a while to be able to notice. But I am starting to get some chili head as the beer reaches room temp. the wonderful thing about this beer is that it keeps changing quite a bit and revealing new surprises as it warms.
M- Not as thick as a beer as I expected. Carbonation is quite low but perfect. Not as heavy a beer as I had expected. Dangerously smooth.
O- Best beer I have ever had. I expected something similar to Prairie Bomb. It is better than Bomb, yet a little lighter. This beer is like chocolate in a glass. Incredible. 1,180 charactersJustin8mypants, Jan 25, 2015

The nose seems to be mostly chili peppers, habenero or Serrano perhaps, with a bit of cinnamon powder and a phenolic duct tape. (It may just be this bottle)
The flavor is predominantly cinnamon spice at first with an accompaniment of raw chili peppers. The peppers provide heat the rest of the way but are almost indistinguishable through the end. The mid palate to finish is chocolatey and malty. Delicious.
The feel is downright chewy and thick. Just fantastic. 570 charactersKYGunner, Jan 05, 2015

All were world class but there was a noticeable fall-off in the cinnamon / chilies as it ages - as expected. Conversely, the mouth feel improved. Cannot wait to try the 2014 Batch 2 and the 2015 offerings. 279 charactersMangbus, Jan 05, 2015

This is the best bourbon, chili, and spice stout I have had in 2014.  Raisins and dark fruit rule in this one.  The taste profile expands as the stout warms.  The feel was perfect.  Nice thickness, with hardly any carb.  This stout is the perfect balance of Cacao Nibs, Madagascar Vanilla Beans, Ancho Chilis, Pasilla Chilis and Cinnamon. 444 charactersmabermud, Dec 28, 2014

Smell-molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla beans, kick of chili
Taste- Sweet, syrupy malt upfront, the richness of the malt is cut by a blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and chili, vanilla providing smoothness around the edges. abv is completely absent. the complimentary flavors provide a very complex yet balanced tasting experience.
Feel- motor oil thick, very creamy and very light carbonation
overall-very exciting and complex yet very balanced. an excellent experience. 567 charactersSteveB24, Dec 26, 2014

A friend gave me a glass (I've never had Huna before and he didn't show me the bottle or tell me what it was until I was half way through and completely enjoying myself in the mystery.)   Appearance was spot on, dark brown to almost black.  The smell was full of bourbon with hints of spices.  The taste follows the smell with even more spices up front.  This became a smooth and chocolaty flavor as it went down.  Mouth feel was on point with just enough carb to notice.  Enjoyed every drop.  One of my favorite beers to date.    UDPATE: Enjoyed a vertical from 2012-2014 and much of the nose and spice faded as it was aged longer.  I enjoyed it better around 9 months old. 704 characterspmangold, Dec 20, 2014

Pours a completely black, slightly viscous color, with a small, dark brown head.
Has rich aromas of chocolate, earthy, scorched malts, notes of molasses and a gentle coffee infusion, well balanced by unsweetened bakers chocolate.
Tastes of smooth, creamy chocolate, joined by toffeeish malts, evoking a mousse au chocolate impression, joined by a sweeter, calming, slightly wooden vanilla note. Has a hot peak, at first introduced by a decent hop bitterness, carried by a generous malt earthiness, transforming into a spicy, hot chili burn. This spiciness numbes the palate for a short glance, then revealing an interplay between a slick coffee bitterness and mellow, sweet chocolate. Finishes with a semi-dry aspect and cinnamon to it, including the taste of whole, burned coffee beans, dipped into hot chocolate. Burning, hot Jalapeno and cinnamon are sticking on the outside of my teeth, accompanied by a subtle sweetness. The balance of this brew is outstanding, regarding its complexity. There are no moments in which any off-flavors get revealed, or in which the beer turns into something odd, but its full body is defined by a great smoothness and diversified taste.
Huna '14
Re rate: spices are even more pronounced, hotter, with a burning, spicy peak to then, then I initially remembered them to be. Cinnamon and mousse au chocolate blend perfectly into the spices, with a wooden vanilla note on top, exhibiting a louscious, well suiting sweetness. Hops provide a slightly bitter, still hot, flavor, adding an appealing variety to the finish, among bready, slightly wooden malts. 1,634 charactersaleigator, Dec 01, 2014

I've been lucky enough to have again a few times since and it still holds up. Normally after I've had a stout, I don't go back, instead looking for new ones. But I always seek out additional Huna. 326 charactersNichols33, Nov 27, 2014

A: Pours an incredibly thick and viscous pitch black. It's a cliche, but motor oil is the appropriate analogy. Serious legs on this one, and a thick film coats the glass. Khaki/mocha head that dissipates quickly into the darkness. Might be the darkest beer I've ever seen.
S: Bright notes of plums, cherries, and dark fruit; pleasant hints of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee; and lots of cinnamon. There's also a thick and heavy-ish aroma of booze, almost like rum. All of the foregoing might suggest an off-kilter, out-of-whack nose, but for all the intense aromas, the nose is incredibly restrained, well-balanced, and even mild. Just masterful stuff here.
T: The initial flavor is of creamy, slightly bitter coffee and chocolate, followed by dark fruits, thick vanilla, and a blast of cinnamon. Aftertaste is bitter coffee, cinnamon powder, and dark chocolate. Light and vegetal chili presence throughout. Final kick is a bit of heat down in my stomach. So many flavors working seamlessly together here. Delicious.
M: Rich, viscous, and light, and not thick, syrupy, or overwhelming. The beer is barely carbonated and almost flat, which works well for all the flavor this beer is packing.
O: Outstanding beer on every level. The aromas are so rich and pleasing, with each flavor playing off and complementing the others. The flavors are so decadent, so bold, yet so balanced and complementary. Who says you need a barrel to rule the world? 1,494 charactersblankenhoney, Oct 26, 2014

edit: had the wonderful experience of tasting a 2012, 2013, and 2014 side by side. it was amazing to me how quickly the cinnamon fades away over time, its almost absent from the 2013, and gone totally in the 2012. as a result, i thought the freshest year was the most dynamic. maybe one of those beers not meant to be cellared... 1,866 charactersStonedTrippin, Oct 07, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.3%Aroma: Loads of cinnamon! Followed with some sweet chocolate, and then you notice the peppers coming in a little, finishes with a wonderful blend of cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla bean, coffee, and the chiles. Just from the smell I know this beer is going to be great! The cinnamon is the star of the aroma for sure! 5
Appearance: Pours pitch black like motor oil and leaves a small espresso colored head that dissipates quickly, how every imperial stout should look! 5
Taste: Yes! So complex! Up front you get this wonderful cinnamon and slight pepper blend, then you get sweet chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon combo, and finishes with all previous flavors mixed with a little more heat from the peppers, some coffee, and light hints of coconut. Finishes a little bitter, but the sweetness lingers and overcomes the bitterness quickly. I was a little unsure about the chiles, but damn they work well with this beer! The complexity of this beer so fantastic and all the flavors are so rich and indulging, this is definitely one of my new favorites and I need to get more! 5
Palate: This is the only part that I don't really like about this beer, with how sweet it is I would have love to seen a syrupy texture, but it is very thick and very dry. It makes you want to drink it rather fast instead of the beer letting you sit there and want to savor it, this beer truly needs to be savored while your drinking it and the mouthfeel contradicts that. That being said it finishes superbly for a dryer stout but, because I don't think the mouthfeel goes with this beer I give it. 4 since it still executes the dry stout feel so well.
O: This is a damn good beer, I would love to get my hands on a Double Barrel Huna to see what the barrel aging brings to this beer, overall this is an incredible stout and it is well worth the hassle getting one of these! 1,851 charactersKnowYourCraft, Sep 07, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +8.6%From notes:
A: This pours like any other imperial stout I had, pitch black with a light mocha like head that decent duration. Good lacing.
S: Well, well, well, what do we have over here. This is something else. I've had REALLY good beers in my life, but this feels like a special moment. Although the smell is light, the main ingredients are there: cocoa, cinammon, vanilla, coconut, peppers, coffee, milk chocolate. And it all seems so damn COHERENT.
T: It's just like the smell, all that is supposed to be there, is there, and strong. You get a strong cocoa/coffee attack, with a wave of sweetness that comes with milk chocolate notes and vanilla, finishes with a light smoke and nice spicyness from the cinammon and peppers. This beer SHOULDN'T WORK. But it does, and it is all very coherent. A tiny bit of alcohol that helps with the aftertaste, amazing.
M: Tight heavy and luscious feel, very creamy and never sticky it seem.
D: Superbly drinkable for the style and the ABV.
This is my favourite beer of all time. Although it isn't perfect, it is the one that gave me the strongest and fondest memory I have of a beer. Amazing stuff that NEEDS to be more available. 1,176 charactersflipper2gv, Aug 29, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +0.9%Reviewed from notes. 750ml bottle shared by Richard - thanks.  2014 Vintage.
A: Pours blacker than a moonless night with a half-inch thick mocha head which sits like a king and leaves streaks of lace.
N: Luscious dark chocolate, roasty malts, vanilla, peppery spices, cinnamon, faint coffee.
T: Follows nose with big roast, chocolate mole, vanilla, cinnamon. Very well balanced.
M: Full body and medium carbonation. Rich, full, decadent complex mix, finishes with peppery spice, vanilla, and roasted chocolate.
O: Whoa, a fresh bottle reminds me how good this is. Always a treat. 584 characterswethorseblanket, Aug 27, 2014

Dark chocolate notes are dominant with cinnamon spice playing a supporting role. Vanilla and chili have pretty much faded at this point. Would love to try this fresh! 216 charactersabeeronthebeach, Aug 25, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.3%Chilies have faded and I get no heat. I also get no heat from the alcohol. 
Had a significant dark fruit characteristic which faded as it warmed. It tastes like french toast sticks dipped in chocolate and coffee. The aftertaste is a pleasant roasty note.
Mounthfeel is incredibly huge rivaled only by room temp dark lord
This beer is incredible 347 charactersDrewskiWhit, Aug 24, 2014

Vanilla, chili-pepper skin, cinnamon, coffee and chocolate. Holy shit, the taste follows that exactly. So in your face. And the mouthfeel is out of this world. You could seriously chew in this beer. Hands down my favorite adjunct non-ba beer. Top 5 for sure. 364 characterswinningwes91, Aug 21, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +5.3%2014. Thanks Chadwick for sharing. Pours pitch black with a thick mocha head that settles quickly into a foamy cap. Good lacing. Lots going on in the aroma - chocolate, coffee, vanilla, spiciness, roasted malt, and booze. Lots of roastiness on the tongue, dark chocolate, coffee and some decent chili heat make this a most complex stout. Full bodied with little carbonation. Overall, an extremely well crafted and incredibly complex stout. 439 charactersJohnG190, Aug 21, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.8%2013 Vintage split with my neighbor on my 32nd bday. Been wanting to open this for awhile. 
Poured into snifter a motor oil black with a dark mocha colored head that had some decent legs given a year and a hslf in the bottle. 
Aroma was mostly chocolate and roasted coffee, some sweet crream
Taste was dominated by bitersweet / dark chocolate. Amazing.  Some coffee and vanilla but was a bit let down to not get any cinnamon or chilies guess I need to try more fresh
Mouthfeel was very thick and visocus , lower carb. Perfect for the style
Overall I was impressed but just slightly let down by the lack of complexity I was expecting.  Need to try this more fresh to properly evaluate 689 charactersmaxcoinage, Aug 19, 2014

Taste is amazing!  It is very complete.  The spice from the chilies is minor and gives a great little accent to the chocolate, vanilla sweet that takes center stage. 344 charactersdexterk1, Aug 17, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +3.1%Finally excited to review one of my favorite beers.  I've managed a handful of sample pours via bottle shares, looking forward to a full glass / bottle. This is a 2014, first batch, poured into a Hunahpu's glass. 
A: Pours black with half a finger of a dense dark khaki head that reduces slowly and leaves a very thin collar. 
S: Huge wafts of chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla. In the back ground I get a lot of roast and coffee. 
T: Sweet chocolate up front with a pleasant lingering cinnamon after taste. There are layers of flavor going on here, roast somewhere in the middle, but for me it's all about the chocolate cinnamon holding it all together. 
M: Thick, rich, and creamy. 
O: As stated, I already knew going in that this is one of my favorites, and nothing has changed after enjoying more than a few sips. 818 charactersroger617, Aug 17, 2014

A - Dark as night with small mocha foam head
S - Chocolate, oak, vanilla, carmel and on the back end comes those chili's, very pleasant on the nose
T - Extremely balanced between the chili, vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla. This is much more balanced than I found Abraxas to be as that was a cinnamon bomb. The finish was where the spice came from. 
M - Very thick full bodied mouthfeel with a creamy finish
O - This is my second favorite chili stout as of now. Just behind bomb! and ahead of Abraxas
Update: 2014 Bottle
Much better than the 2013 bottle that I consumed on christmas
Much more balance here between the cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla mix. The cinnamon is more forward with a small amount of heat on the finish.
Luscious chewy thick mouthfeel and it coats the mouth as well as stains the glass. 
This is definitely up there now with Mexi Cake, the mouthfeel is better than Mexi cake, this would be borderline perfect of there were more heat on the finish.

A) Extremely, extremely dark. Light does not escape this beer, and only a slight tinge of amber on the outside rim. Almost the appearance of a thick motor oil. How an imperial stout should look.
S) Front loaded with heavy scents of dark fruits, particularly plum. This is followed by less prominent smells of cocoa nibs, cinnamon, and chilis, in that order. Probably the most complex nose of any beer I've experienced.
T) The immediate thing I notice is the heavy dark fruit sweetness that I felt in the nose, almost immediately followed by thick dark malt, and the flavors of the chilis. The chili flavor only has a hint of heat, but it's a warmness that lingers long into the aftertaste. I don't immediately taste the cinnamon or vanilla, but detect both in the incredibly long aftertaste that lingers with this beer. My only real complaint is that the cocoa nibs lead to a bitterness that detracts a bit from the overall balance on this. The aftertaste is longer than almost anything I've had before, including even Islay or lowland malt scotches. Lasts for ages.
M) Thick, oily, amazing. The oiliness doesn't waterdown as it lingers on the tongue as some can. While well carbonated, you can barely detect it even when leaving on the tongue. Just an incredible feeling on this one.
O) Admittedly not quite what I expected, especially noting the strength of the fruit scents and taste. That said, I find little I can actually fault in this one. I wish the cinnamon and vanilla were a bit more prominent and the cocoa nibs were a bit less, but those are fairly minor complaints considering the overall complexity of this beer. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one, do not pass up the chance. Well worth it. 1,765 charactersTim_S, Aug 01, 2014

The flavor is excellent. Almost everything is in balance: a little too much pepper, but cinnamon, vanilla, cacao just right. Gets even better as it warms. There's mild bourbon-like flavor. Vanilla? Then, there's a strong but not overwhelming pepper burn on the end.
Overall, a great beer. I want to drink this head to head with other non-BA pepper beers like Bomb!, and whatever else I have that is comparable.
Update:
Went head to head w/ Abraxas! Very close. Thicker almost viscous compared to Abraxas, more lingering pepper heat, more carbonation, more vanilla. Geez, this is too close to choose. Both are excellent. 723 charactersGetalegup, Jul 24, 2014

Huge cocoa in the smell, lots of cinnamon and vanilla, milky and dark chocolate, fig, raisin, veggie chilli pepper, lower coffee notes, faint wood. The smell is incredible, with just a small hint of booze.
Roasty robust taste, huge with dark chocolate, riddled with dry plums and figs, spicy with a lot of woody cinnamon, rich vanilla, even faint licorice. Mellows down and gets a bit sweeter, with sticky molasses and toffee, only to be balanced perfectly in the end with some roasted coffee, dark malts and faint smoked woodiness. The chillies bring a nice warm prickle in the back of the throat, just enough so you know they're there. Taste really brings up all that's written on the label, amplified, rich and perfectly balanced.
Thick body, very smooth, with a very tiny bit of booze present, nowhere near disturbing. Full complex aftertaste, extra roasty. 
A huge imperial stout, unique, worth any effort and future budget-hole to get again. 1,075 charactersdcmchew, Jul 21, 2014

S- Tons of chocolate andspicy pepper on the nose of the this one. Chocolate is right up front, with the pepper spiciness underlying it. Coffee tones come in after the chocolate and pepper and give the scent a darkness that transforms into a dark fruity flavor.
T- Starts off with a chocolate and vanilla blend of both dark and sweet flavors. Roasted coffee notes and burnt malt flavors come in next and provide a darkness and bitterness to the flavor. Spicy peppers kick in during the latter half of the drink, giving a little bite and burn to the dark malts.
M- This beer is the definition of a thick and creamy beer. Despite the carbonation being a little higher than one would expect, this feels almost like it came off of a cask. Dark flavors are the only factors that would inhibit the drinkability of this beer, as the alcohol is undetectable.
Overall, just a solid, imperial stout with some peppers. Chocolate and peppers in stouts are good compliments, and this is a good to great beer, but nothing extremely out of the ordinary. 1,278 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jul 13, 2014
4.58/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52014 vintage. 750-mL bottle served to snifter, shared. Have had the pleasure to sample 2010 aged, 2013 fresh, 2014 fresh. Time for a review of a larger pour.
A: very dark appearance, with zero light escaping from the body. there is a red tinge at the edges. for the alcohol, more head than I expected though this dissipates quickly. lots of cling on the side of the glass.
S: wave upon wave, in order, of milk chocolate, vanilla, then an herbal chile. I don't get much cinnamon when this one's fresh - understandably the chile overpowers 
T: less intricate than the nose. the chile comes across most distinctly, but it's the taste of a well-charred green ancho instead of a tongue-scorching red. there is no "heat." dark roasted malts and vanilla as well. there's so much going on that I didn't notice much hop bite.
M: thick, viscous. the quality of the mouthfeel explains why I took plenty of time (gladly) to finish my half of the bottle.

2013 vintage.
A: Pours inky black with a finger of mocha-brown head.
S: Roasted coffee, molasses, vanilla, caramel, black licorice, and some booze.
T: Follows the nose. Roasted coffee, cinnamon, black licorice, molasses, vanilla, and a slight underlying tartness. Moderately sweet and smokey.
M: A nice thick, sticky body with almost no carbonation. Coats the mouth.
O: Nothing short of incredible. Could possibly be the best non-BA stout I've had. Great all around complexity and the sweetness is just perfect. The cinnamon is a nice addition, but I didn't notice any chile pepper. Overall very drinkable for a big stout. 669 charactersd5001986, Jul 05, 2014

thanks to hollywood_15063 for the trade. 
March 8, 2014 release written on the bottle.
some of the best head I have seen on a imperial stout. 3 fingers deep and thick oily look. dissolves into a still heavy frothy level of head prior to sipping. 
a very bright LED flashlight does not shine through this beer. it's that dark. 
carbonation seems good but cannot be seen. 
nose is vanilla, cocoa and chocolate. it is very strong and apparent. 
some booziness is noticeable as well on the sniff.
color is thick dark chocolate. 
taste is amazing and reflective of the ingredients used. there are other imperial stouts that I like better. some smoke from the chile, slight but not overpowering vanilla and some cocoa. 
I do not get chile spiciness in this merely the flavor of chile peppers, but I also am quite immune to spiciness as I eat tons of varieties of chiles almost daily in my diet. 
the mouth-feel is smooth and medium. not super thick.
cocoa nibs dry out the tongue a little more than I would like on a beer in this style.
the residual cocoa nib flavor could be more subtle IMO.
the front end is dank chocolate and vanilla stouty goodness. SO SO good. back end leaves a little (but not much) to be desired. 
highly recommended if you can get your hands on one. 1,322 characterscoriswrasse, Jun 29, 2014

3.88/5  rDev -14%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42013 bottle from the last true Hunahpu's day at the brewery, and poured into a belgian style globe glass after some warming time from fridge temp. The pour is as dark as night and offers up a brief cap of milk chocolate foam, likely the darkest cap I've ever seen on a big stout.
Aroma of light chocolate though more dry and with carob notes. Touch of alcohol when still and a good balance of roast/espresso notes, yet never towards char/smoke. Taste is sweet and spicy with some grainy texture and chile spice balancing the ABV and keeping it from being too much of a malt bomb. 
Feel is quite smooth even with a bit of a lighter carbonation level than I would prefer(and had on another bottle actually). Offers a long and delicate spicy finish and easy drinkability, particularly with a lack of overbearing sweet/viscous quality. Overall pretty solid but excessive variation from bottle to bottle seems to be an issue. Taste and feel impress while smell/appearance need more carbonation to do so predictably. 1,012 charactersHalfFull, Jun 26, 2014

A: Deep, deep black, with really nice dark brown, cocoa colored head forming and sticking around the edge of the beer's surface. A quick swirl brings it back. Nice lacing around the outside of the glass.
S: Wonderful rotating bombast of sweet spiciness. Bitter dark chocolate, lots of cinnamon, a little vanilla. When cold they're present but muted; as the beer warms and breathes they ramp up.
T: Mmmm. Follows nose, bitter chocolate flavor is first present, with a blast of milk chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla following. This is a sweet, complex beer, but a hint of bitterness keeps it from being too much. On the very back the chilis present themselves, adding an interesting kick. Alcohol kept in check the whole time, though there is a definite warming sensation. Tastes like a dark mexican chocolate bar with a little booziness. Fantastic.
M: Smooth, think, coats the mouth with all of these wonderful flavors.
O: A really fantastic stout, the hype is certainly warranted. One of the better stouts or beers of any kind that I've had in a long while. Will definitely seek this one out in the future, and stockpile reserves to trade for the DB version. 1,247 charactersThepleasantimbiber, Jun 21, 2014
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled from a 750ml that I traded locally for a Fou Foune.
A - Deep dark black with a great tan head. Clings to the glass nicely. Looks wonderful.
S - So rich with a great base of typical IS notes but then so much more. The peppers provide incredible richness and complexity without dominating. The cinnamon starts slow but really picks up over time. And the vanilla is wonderful. Wow!
T - Again, amazing with many of the elements of the aroma working together in great unison where each stands out on its own without interfering with the others. The peppers, cinnamon, vanilla and cocoa all do their part. And at the end, you have a light perception of pepper spiciness remaining on your tongue. Mmmmm.
M - Creamy and chewy with a low carbonation. Fantastic.
O - It's not often a heavily hyped beer exceeds its reputation but this one did. I loved it. 858 charactersGJ40, Jun 21, 2014

Appearance - Pours an inkjet, oily, slick black body with a generous dark brown head that reduces slowly to leave little lacing. Beautiful. 
Smell - Subtle aromas on the nose of dark fruits, soy sauce, light chocolate, vanilla bean, lightly roasted coffee. Slight metallic aroma. 
Taste - Upfront I get dark fruits, cocoa, slight cinnamon. The finish is SUPER roasty.. deep roasted coffee, dark chocolate, toasted malt. I get slight chilies on the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - Thick, viscous, rich. Low carbonation. It will be hard to finish a 750ml of this.. it's literally a meal. 
I can see why this is rated so high, this stout is packed with flavor and complexity. Definitely worth seeking out. Share this one! 794 charactersgcamparone, Jun 20, 2014

Aroma: Incredibly delicious smelling. There's quite a bit of roasty malt backbone to this beer from the get-go; full and full of chocolate and brown sugar- like a chocolate cake. The vanilla and spicy peppers really comes out as it hits room temperature, the pepper more so than the vanilla. I don't get a whole lot of cinnamon at any point here though- it might have been lost in all that chocolate and sugar sweetness. (4.5)
Colour: Pretty typical imperial stout- pours black with a nice mocha coloured 2cm head that dissipates slowly into a fairly thick film, and eventually into nothingness. Nice and viscous beer that's evident on the pour.. and when I swirl it around, it actually stains the glass brown, like Marshal Zhukov. Not a whole lot of lacing. For the most part, it's a delicious black port-like beer that makes me think, "dessert".
Flavour: Same as the nose- straight up nice, thick chocolatey, coffee roast malt. But when the beer warms up over the next few minutes, it becomes a delicious combination of sweet chocolate, bitter coffee, vanilla, chili heat and small hints of spicy cinnamon.. though there isn't a whole lot of cinnamon here either. Incredibly tasty and the flavours come together really well.
Mouthfeel: Thick bodied (but on thinner side), viscous and really smooth. The carbonation is just right- a good presence but not too much.. so its not too overwhelming. The aftertaste is mostly the spicy pepper with chocolate bitterness.. leaving a smooth, spicy finish. There is no indication of the 11% ABV.
Overall: Delicious beer, at least just as good as Abraxas if not slightly better. It's definitely got that sweet chocolate cake flavour, complemented by the chili peppers. Abraxas was more focused on the other ingredients- cinnamon and spicy peppers. Huna has got a great complexity, with lots of flavours that meld together quite well. I will definitely keep searching for this one in the future.
Edit: just opened up a bottle on 9/11/2013, and there is so much cinnamon in this one. I am honestly going to boost Hunahpu above Abraxas and Mexican Cake. It is just so rich, cinnamony and chocolatey. I love this beer!
Re-review: Opened up a 2014 vintage today 6/15/2014, served in a Cigar City snifter. Basically, it was drinking really well even more so than the 2013, which is why I feel this merited a re-review. The chocolate fudge is very strong here, but the peppers come across as a strong vegetal flavour without a ton of heat; the cinnamon is there in the nose and is more subtle, combining with the vanilla bean to add a lot of complexity to both the nose and the palate. The cinnamon isn't exactly Abraxas or Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but I personally find a bit more complexity in here than Abraxas and Mexican Cake; plus the base Zhukov's A and M kill everything else I've had. It's a true pleasure every time I drink this beer. 3,050 charactersStevedore, Jun 16, 2014

Appearance- Pitch black with a half-finger dark tan head. Great lacing straight away. Little to no carbonation. 
Smell- Peppers and cinnamon are the first two dominant scents. Following that, I detect brown sugar and vanilla. I imagine this is gonna be a sweeter stout. Just perfect in every aspect of scent. 
Taste- Same exact flavors as scents, which is remarkable. The vanilla, cinnamon, peppers and cacao nibs all play their parts perfectly. So much hoppier than I had expected. A real treat to say the least. 
Mouthfeel- Again, perfect in every way. Coats your mouth in a delicious stew of wonderful flavors and gives you the tingles in your throat. This beer has the perfect amount of peppers. 
Overall- Almost a perfect beer. I will be seeking this beer out on every possible occasion. I will be trading for this, so I am ISO. 897 charactersfrenchblood21, Jun 14, 2014

A: Outstanding. Pours a deep, rich, black sludge color with one of the most interesting heads I've seen on a stout... almost milk chocolate in color, which eventually fades leaving a nice ring around the head of the meniscus. 
S: Sweet, rich fudgy chocolate, vanilla, coffee, cofee, and a hint of spice at the heel. I've never smelled a beer quite like it.
T: Ho. Lee. Shit. This is over the top delicious. Rich cocoa and coffee first, immediately greeted by cinnamon and vanilla sweetness, with the chillies providing just a hint of heat on the back end as the cocoa notes linger. It's like drinking liquid chocolate pudding topped with cinnamon... simply outstanding!
M: Thick and smooth without being overly chewy. Coats the palette nicely, without overstaying its welcome.
O: Straight to the top of the list of stouts for me. In fact, Hunah makes me forget every other stout I've ever had... simply amazing and deserving of it's reputation. 989 charactersHalfbrother83, Jun 07, 2014

The aroma has chocolate, sweet cocoa, cinnamon spice, and pepper.
The flavor follows with a pop of spicy pepper in the front. It has medium spiciness. Nothing too much for most people. The beer then expands on a medium cinnamon flavor with the smooth flavor of vanilla and a huge huge chunky chocolate. The beer is reasonably sweet.
The mouthfeel is medium plus to full.
A world class brew and up there with the best spicy stouts. However, I am skeptical it deserves such a high rank on the Top 250. 541 charactersdar482, May 19, 2014
4.78/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured vertically from a 750ml cellared then refrigerated bottle into a Lost Abbey Teku glass. As the beer flows into the glass, it forms a foamy and creamy head that demands attention – its glorious. Bubbles are so thin and the foam so thick it almost resembles a nitro. Aromas of cinnamon and chocolate invade the air around the beer, inviting you to try it. After a minute or so, the foam settles into a thin bed the covers the glass, ultimately sinking into the thick, dark and viscous beer below forming a beautiful ring around the glass. 
Its nose is a medley of sweet and spicy aromas, very inviting. Predominant notes are cinnamon, chocolate, chile ancho and vanilla. The taste is quite similar to its nose – as the beer warms and opens up, stronger chocolate flavors take center stage. Very unique brew for sure, and you need to know what you’re getting into prior to trying it – this is not your typical Imperial Stout. The only other beer Huna reminds me of is Luchador en Fuego by Clown Shoes.
Hunahpu’s mouthfeel is probably the best I’ve had. It’s so thick and creamy that it almost feels like drinking melted dark Belgian chocolate. It’s perfect for your palate to fully appreciate the broad spectrum of flavors this beer proudly carries. Carbonation is almost inexistent.
Overall, I must say it does live up to the hype – it’s a work of art. 1,381 charactersHoppySeb, May 18, 2014

This is a nice imperial stout. Pours a dark beer with some carbonation. Smells like coffee, chocolate, vanilla. Taste is superb. It is not dry, it is like a sweet coffee drink, or liqueur. I literally could sip on this all day long. Mouthfeel is syrupy and sweet. 436 charactersJulioH, May 14, 2014

Look: pretty spot-on used motor oil. There’s that hint of a golden color, but mostly just very dark brown sludge—absolutely delicious looking sludge, in this case.
Smell: maraschino cherries, cinnamon, a little pepper spice. As it warms, the chocolate and cinnamon really amplify.
Taste: the initial taste is a perfect fusion of cinnamon, chocolate, and chili pepper. Shortly, the flavor shifts much more heavily toward the pepper aspect, which I find a bit too vegetal for my preferences. The aftertaste is pure chocolatey stouty goodness.
Feel: decently thick, and pretty dry (probably the combined effect of the cinnamon and peppers).
Overall: this is a tasty stout, but I’m honestly surprised it’s anywhere near as highly touted as it is. Of course, for a non-BA offering, it’s hard to think of anything that’s substantially better. I’m hoping that a bit of age will mellow out some of the vegetal qualities in this one that keep it from being really great for my tastes. 1,141 charactersneurobot01, May 09, 2014

Pours a deep dark opaque black, with a copper orange-ish brown head that looks like straight up cinnamon. Holy crap, coolest looking head ever. Unfortunately, it dissipates in less than a minute, which I could have expected given how big and chock full of crap this one is. Not much lacing.
Smells heavenly. Huge cinnamon aroma, with lots of fudgy chocolate, some vanilla, and a slight pepper aroma.
The taste is even more over the top delicious. Honestly tastes like a cinnamon roll studded with little pieces of pepper and drizzled with copious amounts of chocolate syrup and vanilla frosting. The flavors come together incredibly well, with cinnamon leading the way and dominating the conversation. There's a slight pepper twang at the end of each sip that builds up in the back of your throat, and leaves your lips a little tingly.
Honestly, probably the best mouthfeel on a beer I've ever had. Just the right amount of thickness in the body- viscous and chewy without being overbearing. Low carbonation, insanely creamy. No alcohol burn is present whatsoever.
This is next level. I can't believe a beer like this exists. If you haven't tried this, do everything you can to get your hands on some. 1,321 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 08, 2014

mouthfeel - nice, full-bodied imperial stout, slight dry finish, solid mouthfeel, full

Don't really do too many reviews on here, but I'd waited so long to try this one I figured I'd do a quick one.
Appearance - viscous like you wouldn't believe. Straight motor oil.
Smell - Smelled cold and didn't get much. As it warmed, got a good dose of chiles.
Taste - Very solid. Having said that, no trace at all of cinnamon and only very subtle vanilla. Chiles were very subtle and nice, and as it warmed they were brighter and nice. No hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel - Great for the style. Never know what to say in this category. Felt like a stout? 
Overall. Gotta say, a little undewhelmed. Very solid, but I think the two years aging actually did a lot of harm. Would love to try this thing fresh. Bomb!, Mexican Cake...Those are beers I personally find to be best consumed fresh.
Again, we didn't get any cinnamon and only a vague hint of vanilla between five of us. Good but not great. 917 charactersACB, Apr 29, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752012 vintage. Pours very dark with a small chocolate covered head.
Smells strong and very smooth. The aroma is, first and foremost, that of very darkly roasted stout malt--no need for aggressive nodes of bourbon or bacon or Merlot or whatever other crap is currently in fashion. After a few more sniffs, some subtle nodes of cocoa, coffee, and all spice. Not the most variegated of aromas, but the striking smoothness makes up for any lack of excessive complexity.
Tastes like it smells--very smooth, medium complex, and nicely strong throughout. Burnt barley moves into coffee and chocolate, ending on pie spice with a small hint of capsicum that gives the back end a lightly fruit, lightly sweet feel and balances things together quite nicely. Practically no alcohol burn is present. 
An excellent RIS, easily on a par with Dark Lord and Darkness, better than Parabola, but not quite as good as Bomb! or the Abyss. 919 charactersmynie, Apr 25, 2014

A: Looks like black. Head slowly formed, the way a nitro beer would after the pour. Head was dark brown and laced the glass.
S: Dark chocolate up front, with coffee hints (which are slightly acidic). Fruity aroma is mainly pomegranate.
T: Sweet, with bitter chocolate, moving cleanly into a slightly coffee flavor mixed with a slightly chile skin type stunted vegetal taste. Smoothly spicy aftertaste, mixed with chocolate and sour coffee taste to end.
M: Creamy but not too thick. Flows easily without getting too overwhelming. Slightly acrid, but has a great smooth finish.
O: Excellent in all aspects, especially mouthfeel. Was easy to drink and had enough tastes to keep each sip fresh. 758 charactersveinless, Apr 21, 2014

The smell starts with chocolate, graham cracker and cinnamon, sugar at the finish. Very intriguing smell.
Talk about a flavor explosion! Spicy cinnamon and graham cracker and bittersweet chocolate start this. There is a bit of earthy goodness and vanilla in the middle, straight spicy chili pepper finish! Goes down thick and a bit boozy.
Believe the hype! A very well crafted imperial stout! I hope I can get one to cellar! 471 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Apr 18, 2014

Black, motor oil viscous pour with tan head reducing to some light lacing. Aroma is highlighted by chiles, vanilla and sweet, roasty malt. Taste is sweet, heavy on the cinnamon, with highlights of vanilla, cocoa, marshmallow and finishes with spicy chilies. Not very spicy but builds as you drink and is a nice complement to the sweetness. The mouthfeel is chewy and viscous with light carbonation. Wow is this beer intense and challenging to drink. A great beer but it's a bit too much. A little too sweet, a little too much cinnamon and a little too thick. Great complexity, nice level of spiciness and an overall interesting experience I would like to revisit at some point.
Revisited 2014 Huna - the cinnamon and the chilies have subdued somewhat and the flavors have melded a bit more. I like this beer more with a little age on it (I didn't care for the cinnamon) but I still rate it a 4.25 overall. Outstanding, but this is a heavy beer best shared with 3-4 people. 987 charactersbrianmandell, Apr 15, 2014

A- Possibly the blackest, thickest, meanest looking beer I have ever seen. It just slides into the glass like chocolate syrup. Stains the glass.
S- Ancho chilies, chocolate, caramel, and surprisingly, teriyaki
T- Sweet and smooth. Caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar, and spice on the back end. My only complaint is that it is so sweet it's almost cloying. I can seriously feel my blood sugar levels rising.
M- Wow. Thick as can be without literally chewing to get it down. Very sweet and sticky. Alcohol there, but no burn.
O- Expectations were set pretty high, and it lived up to them for the most part. This thing was delicious, but I was glad to have a couple people to share it with as it was a little too sweet for me to handle a full bottle alone. Tasted side-by-side with Bomb, it was clear that Bomb is quite better. 904 charactersBosoxfan20, Apr 14, 2014

Poured into a snifter.
A: blackish brown. A short, foamy, half finger tan head that didn't hang around. Thick. Light lacing.
S: Chocolate, dark fruit, featuring dates and raisins, vanilla, cinnamon. Light chiles.
T: Comes in with a little heat, then dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Fruity, sweet. Syrupy; candied sugar. A tangy finish. Decadent. Delightful. Chiles pop up as it warms. Flavors go crazy!
M: Medium to heavy with low carbonation.
O: One of the finest beers I've had the pleasure of trying. Now I see what all the Hunahpu is about. Really sad about the melee at Cigar City. Maybe more folks can get access to it in the future. 726 charactersbrewskifan55, Apr 06, 2014

MIdnight black, 1/4" medium brown head. Poor retention, minimal lacing
Cinnamon. molasses, chocolate, and just a tinge of green chile. The peppers are much more pronounced as it warms.
Fresh, it's all cinnamon on the front end which meshes perfectly with the chiles mid palate and then finishes with a lingering chocolate flavor. Chicory, molasses, and maybe a touch of the vanilla. Fantastic. Just a hint of soy sauce flavor would be my only criticism. 
Thick, syrupy, very low carbonation. mild chiles so just a hint of heat, 
This is easily one of my favorite beers of all time, and although I prefer it with a bit of age, it's still top notch fresh. 707 charactersPerderick, Apr 01, 2014

A - Pitch black no head.
S - Apple cinnamon oatmeal overwhelms the nose, some chocolate and roast poke through with the slightest hint of pepper.
T - Pepper and Roast come out much more and balance the cinnamon, though it's still the forward flavor.
M - Viscous and velvety. So much sugar my lips feel like I just ate a plate of baby back ribs, I need a wet wipe. There's also some lingering heat on the inside of my mouth from the peppers.
O - An amazing use of all those adjunct harmoniously. Bomb! is a great beer in it's own right, but Huna blew it out of the water IMO. 693 charactersZach136, Mar 30, 2014

2014 vintage, poured into a snifter
A- pours a thick motor oil black color with a small dark tan head that has decent retention and short lasting lace as it settles 
S- very reminiscent of a winter warmer style beer. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg, a hint of spicy pepper on the nose, sweet vanilla, sandle wood, cherry cordial, cranberry spice 
T- sweet fig and prune mix with vanilla and cinnamon, sweet toffee with tart notes of cherry and cranberry , very subtle heat kicks in near the finish, with a linger of dark fruit and graham cracker 
M- thick and viscous body with low carbonation leads to a thick and creamy mouthfeel and a smooth finish, just a hint of alcohol warmth 
O- this should be released at Christmas, as it's loaded with traditional Christmas flavors and aromas. Mouthfeel was nearly perfect the chili complimented nicely 858 charactersTreyliff, Mar 29, 2014

Poured from 750ml into a tulip glass
A- so black, couldn't see through it with x-ray. There is a pretty good head on it that dissipates into a very thin lace. The head is a dark coffee brown.
S- I'm getting lots of sweet dark chocolate. Smells like a dove chocolate bar. There are also hints of coffee and cinnamon. The cinnamon is very very faint. Can't really smell the peppers at all. Chocolate completely dominates this beer in a very good way.
T- lots of chocolate coming through up front. Don't taste much coffee but the cinnamon is pretty well blended in there. It comes through between the chocolate and the peppers. There is a lot of pepper taste on the back end. The peppers are a little sweet and then switches to a little spicy but not overwhelming. 
M- silky. Very very smooth with a full body. A little chewy. There a little kick from the peppers but really not much. 
O- a very very nice beer. The peppers throw me off a little bit and give it a little kick. I'm not sure how i feel about the peppers but it is a very interesting additive. Got a few of these so i'll see how my taste buds change to it. 1,167 charactersmlhyatt, Mar 29, 2014

The pour is thick black oil. Leaves a quickly disappearing burgundy head that isn't very prevalent and doesn't leave much lacing.
Smell is incredible with a strong cinnamon accompanied with vanilla. Booze smell comes in as well.
Taste is great with a lot of cinnamon, vanilla and dark chocolate with a little booze warmth coming in too. No Chile's to taste or smell from this beer like it says on the label.
Mouth feel has a great carbonation for just a split second on your tongue to start. The flavor lingers around nicely on your tongue.

Rich chocolate and vanilla sweetness, cinnamon, and peppers. All the adjuncts work nicely to make an inviting aroma. Everything is big and prevalent.
Tons of chocolate everywhere. Cinnamon and pepper come mid-palate. More pepper flavor than heat. Coffee and dark fruit stout notes. Fairly big sweetness.
The thickness of the beer is what caught me off guard at first sip. It is so smooth as well with light carbonation. Perfect. 
Such a crazy beer. Almost over the top with all the additions. Makes for a good dessert sipper to relax with. 704 charactersMattSweatshirt, Mar 24, 2014

A: 2/3 - dark brown-to-black (cannot read or see through), creamy tan carbonation pours thick and then settles into a subtle glass lacing, large alcohol legs that recirculates on swirling
S: 10/12 - lots of complex notes that were initially muted with a cold pour but then started to pop - caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon; the typical imperial stout notes - chocolate, roasted coffee/espresso, roasted barley - were present but took a back seat to the other aroma; some alcohol; no hop character
T: 18/20: on the front of the tongue, the flavor follows the aroma - big vanilla bean, coconut, toffee, caramel and cinnamon; in the middle of the mouth, these flavors continue to develop and expand with lots of malt sweetness; some alcohol character with a mild-to-moderate residual sweetness on the aftertaste
M: 4/5 - big sticky mouthfeel from the rich malts and alcohol; moderate-to-high carbonation for style
O: 8/10 - I had the privilege to try this beer as part to a BBA blind beer tasting and thanks to Dave Martinez for the opportunity; obviously, there's lot of hype surrounding this beer, and, I think, it was close to living up to it; as part of the blind tasting, I thought that this beer was barrel-aged, which is a huge compliment to its complexity; the only reason that I didn't score it higher was because there was too much residual sweetness on the back of the palate and in the aftertaste; it if was a little drier, this would have easily been a 9 or 10 overall; would love to try DB Hunahpu next!

Thanks to pushkinwow for the bottle!
Pours a deep black color with a short tan head with minimal/no lace. The nose starts with dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and maybe a touch of coffee and of course, chili peppers. Another surprisingly balanced chili pepper stout (though not surprising from CC), dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, toffee, dark fruits (prunes) but finishes with warm chili peppers. A nice thick body and low carbonation, silky, smooth, round. Overall, an excellent example of a style of beer I am not usually a fan of. 606 charactersmtomlins, Mar 21, 2014

Appearance - Dark brown colour with an average size frothy head. I can't make out the amount of carbonation showing and there is some decent lacing. The head lasted for around 2-3 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, chocolate, grains, coffee, chilies, vanilla, booze
Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and coffee. There is also some vanilla, dark fruit, chicory, and chilies.
Overall - I'm not a fan of peppers/chilies in my beer normally, but they work so well with this beer. One of the better beers I have ever had for sure, and something that is well worth seeking out. A big bold flavourful beer that somehow remains quite drinkable and balanced. 769 charactersspinrsx, Mar 20, 2014

Look
The beer is pitch black motor oil with no translucent edges, great mocha head that dissipates evenly and settles into khaki swirl in the glass. It looks tasty.
Smell
Cinnamon and chocolate, very little of the pepper in the nose and some vanilla. It smells great but it isnt over the top  
Taste
Cinnamon and vanilla throughout the entire drink of the beer. No alcohol heat and some peppery at the finish. The cinnamon takes over the majority of the drink, then vanilla comes through.  Thoroughly enjoyable and really is a beer that is best consumed at or just above room temp. All of the flavor is there at the right temperature. 
Feel
Creamy thick and smooth. When swirling around on the pallet it isnt vanilla shake, and doesnt have a sticky icky feeling, which shows off the cinnamon more than the chocolate and malt.  
A great beer and one that i stock up on to enjoy a bottle frequently. 985 characterscarmike813, Jan 27, 2014

A: Super black, really nice dark brown head.
S: Chocolate up front. A little bit of coffee but mostly chocolate.
T: Very dark rich chocolate up front, coffee and vanilla in the middle and a really great chili flavor left on the tongue. The chili isn't spicy at all yet its clearly identifiable, its a great aspect of the beer.
M: Super thick, just the way I like it.
O: Awesome, one of the better non-BA stouts I've had and probably the best chili character in a stout I've had. 510 charactersanteater, Jan 14, 2014

I really want to try this super fresh now. March 2013 release, tons of fudge and dark chocolate up front. Sweet with a hint of chiles. Subtle red wine-like grapiness on the back palate. The finish is all cocoa powder. Dense and heavy in the best ways. The pour was almost the best part: thick, it nearly oozes into my glass and I fear a head is impossible. Then, slowly, the deepest mahogany foam cascades vertically to allow an impressive cap to such a big stout. Hell. Yes. 586 charactersSpider889, Jan 04, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is the 2013 vintage as I wanted it fairly fresh. It has about 3/4 of a year on it.
Pours out dark as night with a one-finger, dark brown head with great retention and some nice lacing. Smell is nice chocolate forward with some decent vanilla and definitely a little peppers but not overdone. Definitely some nice dark, burnt malts in there as well. The nose is really well balanced and melds together well. Taste is chocolate forward, dark malts next, then comes the vanilla, but like the first time I had this the peppers really aren't forward until you've drank a quarter of the glass so that's what I am expecting here. After a few more gulps you can sense the peppers. Everything REALLY comes together well. This is a great recipe. Mouthfeel is definitely on the thick side like I love my stouts given decent carbonation. Overall this is one of my favorite stouts (I have lot's favorites) an look forward to my trip to Florida so that hopefully I can do some in person trading and get a couple more bottles as I want to share with my friends,
Edit: I love this beer so much cause at first you barely notice the peppers but after half a glass they start to make you sweat a tad bit. This beer is put together so well. 1,227 charactersNeedBeerHere, Jan 03, 2014

Poured like a bottle of motor oil, producing a 1 finger chocolate brown head. Left a nice syrupy resin on the glass.
Smelled of roasted coffee, espresso, and dark chocolate with a slight bourbon scent.
Taste was extremely roasty, almost smokey, but pleasantly sweet on the finish. Didn't taste much of the peppers, perhaps the aging took that away a bit. Definite coffee and chocolate flavors, not much vanilla.
Mouth-feel was thick and tasty. Alcohol was blended quite well so it was an easy drinker.
Overall this was a solid stout but to me, not as amazing as I anticipated. I'd like to try a fresher bottle to get the heat from the peppers next time. 734 charactersTWStandley, Jan 02, 2014

Beyond thick - lumpy ebony body. There's a heck of a lot going on here - I definitely still got a lot of cacao and fudgy chocolate goo. The chilies play well in the mix and provide a nice contrast without being offensive. As they should be, cinnamon and vanilla were in the background and contributed nice compliments. 
This has a nice recipe that could have been botched by playing any of the ingredients too much - instead, this is a nice harmonious RIS that was nice to finally consume. 528 charactersdirtylou, Dec 16, 2013

A black liquid right out of the bottle, just a thumbnail of cola for an edge when held to the light, shes dark alright, even the foams dark, three fingers worth falls after a few sips leaving no lace much to my surprise, second pours no different with nothing sticking 
S bakers chocolate, coco, a little char, chilli peppers, cinnamon sticks, peppermint, molasses, faint vanilla, a little espresso, smells a little woody but I as far as I know this isn't barreled, just a hint of booze and plenty more chocolate 
T some unburnt cigarette tobacco, (yes I've actually tasted a ciggy...don't ask questions!) strange fruity notes I can't quite place, and everything I smell, rich as all hell and the booze is gone, terrific stuff!!
M faint heat builds but never really accumulates to much, thick liquid, mellow carbonation stops short of creamy, peppers and chocolate syrup just keep going on the finish, and my lips almost stick together 
O before this hit my glass I was impressed, the second I cracked the bottle I could smell the chocolate and I could see the darkness before the stream out of the bottle hit my glass, sexy at every turn 
I almost feel guilty drinking this one by myself, "almost" being the operative word, quite worthy of the 2000 milestone. The warming chilli works great with this Alberta Winter evening but I couldn't imagine drinking this in the hot humidity of Florida 1,562 characterswordemupg, Dec 15, 2013

A little fruitiness from the chilis and some dark baker's chocolate on the nose as well but mostly wet tobacco. The taste is really bitter dark chocolate with loads of richness throughout. The flavors have already really melded together on this 2013 bottle. They play well. There is no chili heat but some fruitiness. The body is nice and viscous to stand up to the big flavors. It's a bit of a sipper though. It needs to be split multiple ways with friends. 577 charactersPHBoiler, Dec 12, 2013

An aggressive pour yields a black as night pour with the darkest two finger head that I've ever seen on a beer. Unfortunately, the head quickly fades with no lacing. Dark chocolate fudge dominates the nose along with hints of mocha, chili, black cherries, tobacco, and vanilla. The taste follows suit with tons of chocolate fudge up front. As it warms, the chili's really emerge but don't overpower. Also getting hints of bitter cocoa, cinnamon, tobacco, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a bitter, off-putting finish. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this beer, but no way did it live up to the hype. 664 charactersbeerdrifter, Nov 15, 2013

T- tons of dark cocoa, beautiful chile flavors that give a subtle bite, lots of cinnamon, some vanilla, some dark fruit, slight coffee notes.
M- silky smooth, way smoother than it should be for 11%
O- its is unlike any beer I have had, the chile works so beautifully with the sweet flavors of the cocoa, cinnamon, and vanilla beans. This was extremely easy to drink for its high abv, and I am so glad I got to try it. 562 charactersbrewtus, Oct 25, 2013

A- Yep, black as night. Little head, so lots of retention. Not much head to speak of, but it vanished pretty quick. Thin lacing remains around the rim. Chocolate head. 
S- The very first thing that I notice is a floral note. Call me crazy. Then I get vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon. Very malty. 
T- Maybe the third at most? perfect 5 I have given on taste. This beer doesn't need to be barrel aged to get to a 5. Vanilla upfront, then mixed chocolate and cinnamon spice. Touch of caramel. 
M- Just about as good as it gets. My top M is Zhukov, so can't be much different. Thick, so fn smooth. Some carbonation does follow down the throat, but it is not noticeable because the beer is so dense. 
O- World class beer. I want this beer sooo bad. 773 charactersgueuzedreg, Oct 21, 2013

4.85/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752013 batch. Poured into snifter glass. 
Appearance: The beer is pitch black. No lacings around the glass but the beer left a tint of brown coating around the glass after swirling. Its thick like motor oil. 
Smell: Wow... just so much to pick from, I was getting cinnamon, a ton of vanilla, some chocolate, plenty of roasted malt and also some booze. 
Taste: A ton of chocolate and a ton of cinnamon. Maybe just a tad too much cinnamon. With each sip it starts out sweet and the heat from the chiles comes in midway through. It's a very prominent heat but not overwhelming at all. With the heat, you can still taste the beer and appreciate the chocolates and vanilla tones. It's incredible how the heat of the beer pairs so well with the flavors of an imperial stout. There is a slight burn in the mouth after you finish the sip. But its slight and stays around - not like a raging fire after eating spicing Mexican food. The heat and the flavors were artfully crafted together in my opinion. 
Mouthfeel: silky and smooth. Not so creamy like I wish it would be but it's not thin either. The subtle heat of the beer just coats every inch of your mouth. 
Overall: this is one of the best beers I've had. I want more of this, too bad I only had one bottle. What's interesting though was I had an opportunity to try this a few months ago. At that time, I did not note any heat and there was an over abundance of cinnamon. But this bottle I just drank was incredible - the heat was there, there was many flavors to pick from, it was delectable. 1,543 charactersBenish, Oct 21, 2013

This is a massively flavorful beer - incredible flavor depth and excellently balanced all around. Chocolate is the dominant flavor and aroma. Incredibly rich velvety mouth-coating milk chocolate, bittersweet dark chocolate covered oily espresso beans. The madagascar vanilla beans yield an amazing bourbon-vanilla sweetness - some toffee too. It's perfectly boozy at 11%. It's like a spirit coated decadent chocolate vanilla spice cake. The chillies and cinnamon blend incredibly well together and create a spicy and slightly vegetal pepper skin with a cinnamon kick. It has a wonderfully smooth, viscous, mouth-coating full body with very soft carbonation. 
Incredible beer that stands out as one of the best in my memory. It's hard to imagine that a barrel aged version could make it better with so much going on, but I must try one after experiencing this. 893 characterstimc100, Oct 01, 2013

I smell the chile's and not much else. Smelled a bit oxidized as it warmed, not as pleasant. Taste is decent. Standard RIS with flavors of chile and very faint chocolate. The vanilla was absent until it warmed a bit. The unfortunate oxidization masks the potential of both the cocoa nibs and vanilla. I was hoping these flavors would be the highlight of the beer. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Overall, I'm a tad disappointed. I see the great scores, yet I'm perhaps distracted by a fridge full of Black Tuesday and Chocolate Rain that I know will never let me down. I can't help but think that Goose Island and the Bruery are way ahead of the flavored stout game. 758 charactersPlinyBeMiney, Sep 20, 2013

dark black, opaque. no head at all. MASSIVE in your face spell of chocolate and alcohol. I can tell this would improve with age. taste is huge on cocoa and alcohol, cinnamon is also very apparent. not getting any chili peppers though. real good flavor overall. full bodied, no carbonation.
overall a real big imp stout that will just improve with age. give it a year to fully enjoy it. 415 charactersAxnjxn, Sep 07, 2013

A- Pitch black with little to no head. Reminds me of black shoe polish it is so dark.
S- Cinnamon, chile, chocolate, slight roasty, and vanilla. everything that is listed is apparent
T- Chocolate followed by chile and vanilla. Truly excellent and perfectly balanced. Only reason it is not a 5 in taste is b/c I have had the BA Huna and know that even this can get a little better
M- thick and coats great. what you expect and want from this type of brew. dont know of a better mouthfeel in imperial stouts
O- one of the best CCB has to offer. a beer that everyone should feel obligated to try 780 charactersTheChef18, Sep 02, 2013
4.31/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I thought it was a very good stout (obviously you don't reach the heights that this beer has reached on hype alone) but the chile spice is something I could do without. So, that is just a personal preference thing. I would certainly drink it but I would prefer something like a Zhukov that doesn't have the same spice to it.
I would recommend this beer any day. It really is something special. 394 charactersdayvinn87, Sep 01, 2013

Pours an pitch black. Looks like back ink pouring out of a broken pen. Sexy. Dark kahki head. About the same color as Founders RIS. Frothy mud sitting atop black water. Looks thick and amazing.
Right off the bat I get cinnamon and some nice vanilla. Biggest note of vanilla I have gotten from a beer that wasn't barrel aged. To be honest, I dont like a lot of beer that are brewed with vanilla (reminds me a lot of sweet chalk. Just dont like it) but this smells amazing. I get aromas of milky sweetness, chocolate and an ever so subtle roast as well. Just judging by the smell I have to say this is incredibly balanced. Nothing jumps out at me as being over powering.. Smells like heaven in a glass. ....I dont get much of the pepper though? Maybe my palate isnt used to peppers in beer but I am not getting it.
F*** me this is nice. I gravitate to beers that are on the sweeter side and this delivers a nice amount of sweetness up front. Subtle vanilla, Sugar and cocoa dusted cinnamon sticks right of the bath that mixes with more soft vanilla. The finish has a very small amount of pepper but an incredible lingering cinnamon stick with chocolate and milky sweetness. Extremely well balanced. and impressive. Perfect 
Thick mouthfeel. It feels heavy on the palate but not oil like. More like melted marshmallows. Light in all the right places but heavy in the same way. I love this beer. 
No trace of booze anywhere (to be fair, I have never been good at picking up the booziness of beers)
Overall impression:
I really love that the roast is extremely subtle on the palate and pretty much unnoticeable (at least to me) Hunaphu is the definition of a silky mouthfeel. The flavours are big and balanced but they all play together nicely. While I dont get too much of the peppers on the nose or on the palate I am ok with that because I dont think that would make the beer any better. 1,955 charactersdsal89, Aug 25, 2013

A: Thick, viscous-like, motor-oil consistency looking beer. Aggressive pour leads to a thin peanut butter colored head that remains and slides down the glass as I taste.
S: Roasted chocolate malts, some vanilla in the nose and some spicy shit as well but it's the sweetness and a touch of the alcohol (or perhaps even the pepper) that bring the big aromas.
T: As Nicki Manaj would say: It's a motherfucking monster.The monstrous chocolate, sweet roasted chocolate malts are over the top delicious. Blended nicely with the alcohol kick towards the very end and the subtle notes of the chili pepper and vanilla finish ends this roller coaster ride of a beer.
M: Perfect mouthfeel. Big huge beer, sticky sweet mouth coating.
O: An absolute joy to drink. Was glad to split this with friends because I'm not sure I could have ever killed an entire 750 by myself but man would I love to try. 1,013 characterssuspect, Aug 20, 2013

Nose is very roasty, slightly smoky with some black licorice and blackberries. Interesting and complex.
Taste is quite interesting, different than most stouts out there. Mexican pepitas, cinnamon, spices and dark chocolate. Somewhat mole-ish but without the peanut butter...soft ancho-esque chilis. Alcohol is big, but well integrated. Mouthfeel is soft and lowly carbed. Truly a unique stout to behold, I kind of wish it was a little more milk chocolaty. The dark fruit adds a nice little complex twist. Its really good, but I wouldnt put it in my personal top 10 stouts. 729 characterstwiggamortis420, Aug 16, 2013

Smell is a clusterfuck. Got the coco, some spice, some roast and a lot of coffee. 
Taste is...carrots? Chili and coco, bit of a chalky texture, very well balanced, cinnamon, graham crackers. Magnificent. Loses the red fruit of Marshal but gains so many more flavors. 
This can stand beside Abyss. It’s a near perfect blend of perfect flavors. Rich, but not overpowering. Thick but not heavy. Delicious and beautiful. 512 charactersSmurf2055, Aug 08, 2013

L – Black color with a 1-finger brown frothy, foamy head. Nice retention and lacing. VERY viscous. There are some noticeable legs on the side of the glass as well. This looks great.
S – Lots of chocolate and vanilla with a little bit of noticeable chile and cinnamon spice. Smells pretty good.
T – Wow. While it only smelled pretty good, it tastes ridiculous. It starts off with cocoa and vanilla sweetness and picks up a little bit of a kick along the way with cinnamon and pepper notes. As the taste progresses, it picks up a BIG roasted malt and dark chocolate character. Toward the finish, the dark chocolate really builds to a crescendo and finishes out the beer perfectly. This is delicious.
F – Full-bodied, decent carbonation, a velvety and creamy mouthfeel, and a sweet, mildly bitter, and mildly dry finish. Bittersweet dark chocolate lingers for a long time. There’s a bit of warmth from the alcohol, but the 11% ABV is largely hidden.
O – This is a fantastic beer and one of the best stouts that I’ve ever had the pleasure of having. When I poured it and smelled it, I was a bit concerned that the hype train may be striking again. It looks and smells very good, but I remember thinking that I’ve had stouts that were similar in both departments. However, I was proven very wrong once I tasted it. This beer is very special and has a phenomenal blend of flavors that all work perfectly together. The mouthfeel is also fantastic. The cherry on top is that I have no idea where all the alcohol in this beer is hiding. It is extremely drinkable for an 11% ABV imperial stout. I am so, so glad that I got to try this one and I’d love the opportunity to have it again. It’s definitely worth seeking out. Thanks, Joel! 1,803 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Jul 27, 2013

The aroma is amazing with a lot of little nuances making up the collective body of scents. It's the flavor that gets me; it's SO fucking sweet. I don't do malty IPAs and sweet stouts are of course hard for me to fall in love with. With all the flavor jam-packed into the bottle, I found the drinkability very low and overwhelmed by the sweet fudge-like flavors. 
Still a wonderful experience and even though I wasn't IN LOVE, I will still give it a good grade for the sheer complexity of this beer.

A- Poured into HF stemware, pours jet-black with a thin mocha head that quickly fades to a thin ring around the glass. Appears to be very thick, almost syrupy, with very low carbonation. 4.25
S- Vanilla beans up front followed by unidentifiable spices, cherries, chocolate, several fruit esters I can't pick up, with a slight alcohol undertone. Extremely complex and enjoyable. 4.75
T- Chocolate that is quickly overtaken by a strong, yet not overpowering chili flavor that gives way to marshmallow-like vanilla, cinnamon, and a complementing roast malt. There is a lingering bitterness, it seems like it is more from the malt than hops though. 4.5
M- Low carbonation that is barely present, a full body with a long bitter note mixed with the heat from the peppers. 4.5
O- This beer is definitely better around 50-55 degrees. All of the flavors seem to pop more and meld to make an incredible beer. I don't know if I could drink much more than 12 ounces of this in a sitting, but it is very enjoyable, and one of the best Russian imperial stouts I have consumed thus far. When you pick it apart individually as far as smell, mouthfeel, etc, it doesn't rate as high as it deserves. Simply incredible, I will be searching for more.. 1,388 charactersjustforrazors, Jul 13, 2013

Appearance: Pours black as death. It's so viscous, thick and creamy. There's a small brown head that quickly goes away. 
Smell: Definitely getting vanilla, chocolate and coconut. Some chili pepper character is there underneath everything along with some slight cinnamon. There's also somewhat of an oaky smell, although I don't believe this is barrel aged. 
Taste: Chocolate, vanilla and coconut perfectly layered over chili pepper spiciness. The chili pepper element gets stronger as the aformentioned blend tapers off. You're then left with a slightly bitter, chocolate/coconut ending, with the peppers lingering long after the drink; they kinda tingle the back of my throat a little bit, nice. It's just an amazingly well-blended and complex beer.
Mouthfeel: It doesn't get much better than this for an Imperial Stout; the viscosity is in BCBS territory. There's not much carbonation to speak of, but it doesn't bother me one bit.
Overall: This totally lives up to the hype and is one of the best beers I've ever had. Does that sum it up? 1,103 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jul 01, 2013

A - Fantastic. Completely opaque black with a rich dark brown, 1-finger head that is surprisingly lively.
S - Roasted grain, dark chocolate, cherry, plum
T - Dark roasted grain, plum, tart grape skins, dark chocolate, char, chalk, vanilla and some toffee/molasses sweetness. Subtle but certainly-present chili and cinnamon flavors. It finishes nicely tart and rich with a hint of coffee, bold dark chocolate and pepper-cinnamon.
M - Medium-thick body and light-medium carbonation. Smooth, creamy, lucious.
O - An explosion of flavor. 606 charactersTucquan, Jun 29, 2013

Thanks to LiquidDegenerate for this bottle
Pour: Black as ever with a half finger dark brown head. Really no lacing noted. 
Smell: Dark chocolate brownie. Some char. Vanilla and ever so faint cinnamon. A touch of coffee way in the back. As I let this warm the chile notes are just starting to peek out. 
Taste: Massive amount of dark chocolate up front. A sweetness that I assume is from the vanilla. Cinnamon is there and as it warms the spice from the chile is more prominent. 
Mouthfeel: This is a coat your mouth full bodied beer. Thick, chewy and viscous. Carbonation is low.
Overall: This is one huge beer that is best shared. A massive stout that as it warmed became more and more enjoyable. The cold hid almost all aspects of this beer but as I sipped it became a completely different beer. 846 characterssleuthdog, Jun 29, 2013
4.49/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5an unbelievable "Thank You" to Sleuthdog for opening this mega want of mine! Seriously bro you're such a badass!!
A: pour is oil black, created about 1/2 fingers worth of a very dark brown/tan colored head formation. the lacing big spotting bubbles hug the side of theglass and alcohol legs are definitely evident
S:big dark cocoa, graham cracker, faint touches of cinnamon, and vanilla. slight coffee grounds, a tinge of tobacco. as the beer warms, the chili peppers start to rise to the top creating a intrigues like none other. and i can't wait to coat the palate with this son of a bitch 
T: just a massive blast of cocoa nibs right up front assaulting the palate. the middle of body, introduces alcohol soaked dark fruits to create a bit more sweetness (figs/raisins), some smokiness, and then the chili peppers and other spices come in. the finish is a nice vanilla finish. the palate seriously goes for a ride with this one
M: the is my favorite part of the brew. strong full bodied beer, chewy, leaves a thick coating on the teeth and the palate. the palate is left with touches of chili peppers, and cocoa nibs. by far the best aspect of the brew in my opinion
O: this brew was very difficult to rate to be honest. with each sip I felt that something new was either smelt or tasted, and I loved it for that but the chili heat came in sort of waves for me brings some inconsistency. 1,395 characterstut2528, Jun 29, 2013

I've had it on draft several times at the brewery as well. I prefer to let them age in the bottle. It has more bite coming off draft, but the flavors really mingle and mellow out in a good way after it's been aged. Pours thick like motor oil and smells of dark chocolate with chiles and vanilla mmmm. I've had the lairds apple brandy huna on tap as well, but I prefer the original, although I have yet to try the California Brandy Huna (2013). Overall, great beer across the board and I use this as a standard when comparing any imperial stout! 620 charactersChrisRoemer, Jun 27, 2013

4.59/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a wine snifter glass. Vintage 2013. Much thanks to the DC bottle share and Jeff?
Out of the bottle it pours like motor oil, a fleeting super dark mocha cocoa head, with a jet black presented body, with a thick appearance.
Bouquet is a bit hot strangely, coming off like bitter hot chocolate, real piping almost. Super dark bitter chocolate notes, only a little bit of slight pepper, red heat chili. Some warmth brings out a little bit of tobacco.
Palate is incredibly easy drinking. Mellow dark bitter chocolate, with faint fruity undertones. Toasty finish and roasting malts almost charcoal. Warmth brings out a big earthy chocolate more so with leafy tobacco hinted on the nose. Mouthfeel comes with a big to moderate slick coating without a syrupy feel. Pepper angle gets lost after numerous sips, but doesn't ruin the enjoyment.
Overall a real fun brew, but some of the bouquet is buried in the mix. It does turn out a fun experience though upon taste. Hope to have this again some day. 1,022 characterssmakawhat, Jun 23, 2013

A: Pours pitch black with a half a finger of dark khaki colored head. The foam settles fairly quickly, leaving only a thin ring of bubbles along the edges of the glass. This beer has serious legs, as it clings and coats the glass. Looks wonderful.
S: The nose is excellent. Sweet vanilla, raisin, chocolate, cinnamon, spice, and mild roast.
T: The taste of this beer follows the nose. It hits the palate sweet and syrupy with malt, raisins, vanilla, and milk chocolate. As it moves to the middle, the cinnamon and peppers make themselves known. The spices dance on the palate adding to the complexity of this brew. The finish is more chocolate and vanilla as the spices fade. Delicious.
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and coating, wet and syrupy, and refuses to leave the palate once the beer is gone. Typically I'm not a huge fan of uber-lingering beers, but with a beer this good, it's hard to complain about the lasting flavors.
O: Excellent. I've had this beer a number of times and it never disappoints. The flavors are wonderful, the nose is great, and the mouthfeel is cloying and smooth. I could drink this all day everyday. 1,154 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jun 16, 2013

Wow...WOW...WOW !!!
First time trying this wonderful brew from the Cigar City guys.
Looks great, some light carbonation, some lacing, dark motor oil with classic tannish head after pour then a flat black lake, no fizz. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but creamy and complex. Smell had some sweetness of bourbon and after warming a lot of the cinnamon (love it).
Taste is soooo, sooo very complex. Like one very versed taster said "this is the most complex beer in terms of flavors I've ever had!"--he's had 100's of beers.
I am a malt bomb guy. Love stouts and bourbon. This one has all that but the little bit of edge from the chillis and the cinnamon and vanilla beans really move this to a different level. It is truely unique and should be sought out. The high (over $100) price I've seen on some of the beer selling sites (ALWAYS TRY TO TRADE, not just buy) seems justified. It is worth it however you get your hands on it. 
2 thumbs way up ! 1,036 charactersSHerninko, Jun 14, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep, deep abyss-black and leaves about a finger of brilliant dark tan head with some real nice texture which lingers around a while before fading to leave the beer surface black with a brown rim of bubbles. Beautiful stout.
Smell: Chocolate, hot pepper, some light tart cherry, vanilla. A very interesting and mouth-watering combination. Unique smell that I've never experienced until now.
Taste: Chocolate and *pow* hot pepper right up front. Vanilla, roasted malts, plums, a touch of cherry, figs. A delicious combination. The peppers add more to this then I expected, there is a flash of spice, which fades immediately but really makes this one interesting. Plenty of dark chocolate and vanilla in this one as well as some cinnamon. Finishes with a touch of bitter. ABV is masterfully hidden beneath the intricate flavors. Wonderful.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation and a medium to heavy, creamy body. The texture matches the flavor profile very well. This one goes down exceptionally smooth.
Overall: A fantastic and unique imperial stout. The chilis and cinnamon make for a very interesting and delicious flavor profile. The chocolate and vanilla also comes out very nicely. The beer's creamy texture really helps keep this one masterful. This is an expertly crafted beer. 1,383 charactersResuin, Jun 11, 2013

Bottle into GI Matilda glass
A- literally looks like motor oil on the pour.  Bubbles to modest millimeter head of light brown/dark cream, which then fades to film. Black coffee shade of brown, opaque.
S- tobasco sauce, booze prominent. Cinnamon spice and light chocolate beneath. 
T- chocolate and deep, deep malt roast. Like eating a burnt s'more on a piece of toast, to chase a shot of hard liquor with a few drops of hot sauce. 
M- reminds me of a thicker plead the fifth. Slick, velvety, warming, slightly sticky
O- Excellent, a shame it's so rare.  Happily taking note that all the complex flavors/ingredients are mostly balanced.  Not sure what to make of the peppers. I like them a lot, but i should try more brews with this additive. 787 charactersRhyminBelmont, Jun 07, 2013

Appearance: Rich dark brown and some rusty red visible on the sides of the glass. A nice initial head of about an 1/2" that quickly recedes to a thin cap.
Smell: Roasted malt coffee with a spicy nose, a combination of spice with cinnamon becoming more and more prominent as it warms.
Taste: Very rich bitter chocolate and coffee all warmed by the cinnamon spice characteristics. Another beer that continues to transform as it is allowed to warm. When colder the coffee, chocolate, and some vanilla are stronger, as it warms the cinnamon and spice flavors move to the front and really take over. The only question is whether the heat comes from the chilies or the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Nicely smooth with a little heat on the finish.
Overall: Really a unique stout, a stand alone example of a barrel aged imperial stout. Very glad I've had the chance to try it. 967 charactersBobZ, May 26, 2013

Appearance- The end-all, be-all of imperial stouts as far as appearance goes. As dark as physically possible, viscous with a very dark brown head. Head recedes to a dark ring around the edges of the glass
Smell- Heavy roast, cocoa, and mild vanilla are the most forward for me. A touch of alcohol and some coffee notes are around as well. No real cinnamon presence on the nose, which would have been nice, but overall, it smells great.
Taste- Big, dark cocoa up front that mixes with coffee and a touch of vanilla. Cinnamon is tough to pick up, but it is perceptible. A twinge of pepper heat mixes with sweet alcohol and gives it an intriguing finish. 
Mouthfeel- Wonderfully full, rich, and coating. Finishes sweet and sticky.
Overall- Much more drinkable for a huge stout than I was expecting, and it's really enjoyable. Really glad I got to try this. 910 charactersmahak213, May 26, 2013

Pours a thick solid black color with a decent sized long lasting dark cocoa head. Smells of chocolate and roast up front with lots of anise and dark sugars supporting. Light cinnamon as well as earthy hops provide a bit of balance. Thick chocolate syrup, dark chocolate, licorice, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors come out up front. Lingering chocolate covered pitted fruits, licorice and roast coats the digestive track long after every sip. Thick body with a creamy syrupy mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This is a big thick sweet chewy stout, just the way I like them, bring on the diabetes. 670 charactersjohnnnniee, May 19, 2013

Poured into my trusty travel snifter, the stout was a deep black color with a mocha head. The beer did not appear to be as thick as I would have expected. In the aroma, one gets chocolate, a slight hoppiness, and a certain spice. One also gets a malt backbone on a lesser scale. In the initial taste, there was so much going on, it was amazing. One the detectable notes are chocolate, citrus, pineapple, cinnamon, spice, and burnt malts. What is most amazing is that these notes co-exist rather than clash. In the aftertaste, the citrus is most apparent while linger on the back of the tongue. The mouthfeel is a hair too thin, as I find myself wishing this one would last a lot longer. 
Hunahpu goes to close to the front of the line in terms of the beers I have had in my life. I need to find more. 972 charactersJohnnyHopps, May 03, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A - 4.5 - Pours a thick, viscous black, like crude oil. Aggressive pour yields tons of thick mocha head that persists. Note - a gentle pour gets you nothing but an aggressive one gets you way too much. Go gentle and then finish off with some high pour. The enduring head wins it points over, say, BCBS or other big stouts that just don't give you much.
S - 4.5 - Smells a bit like Golden Grahams cereal (and/or maybe some kind of malty dark brown raisin bread loaf) crossed with a hint of chili pepper. I aslo get something like coconutty suntan lotion. I get something akin to fresh pork bbq with a sweetish sauce. Smells like good food! All in all it's a very clean and comforting smell - not really what I was expecting.
T - 4.25 - Milder than expected for an imperial. Overall I think that holds it back a bit. Nicely composed and subtle. Leans sweeter. There's almost a liquor to it, or a liqueur. It's a rich, concentrated flavor like a very dark chocolate liqueur. There's almost a fruit something but I couldn't say what it is. As with the aroma, there's something almost like that nostalgic suntan lotion you remember from childhood beach trips, but in a totally palatable way. Maybe that's the vanilla. I don't think I'm getting any of the advertised cinnamon. After a while, the aftertaste is surprisingly of char, a char that was lacking in the main body, and missed. But if you've ever had cacao nibs, it's also similar to that earthy bitter taste. I'm left with a nice mild chili burn in the throat. There's a hint of chili burn/sting on the tongue, but not much. It's just enough that you like it and no more. That afterburn really adds to the savor and, along with the ABV, makes this one ideal as a nice long slow sipper.
M - 4.5 - Silky smooth but surprisingly less viscous than it looked when pouring. I'd call it medium bodied,leaning medium-heavy. Was expecting super heavy.
O - 4.5 - Certainly a winner and pleasantly unique. It definitely has a distinct identity, and in a good way. It's very well balanced. It's more delicate than I expected. Compare to Zhukov, which really grabs you by the balls and blasts you. I'd go about 4.4 overall if we could score freeform. 2,194 charactersBrownNut, May 03, 2013

Aroma of deep velvet chocolate notes with light spicy notes and some light vanilla and cinnamon can also be detected. Taste is a mix between some deep chocolate notes with light cinnamon and vanilla a with some residual sugar notes with dry bitter notes subtle finish. Body is full with limited filtration and with a smooth texture with almost motor oil-like consistency. Extremely complex while retaining a good level of drinkability. I found it very hard to do justice to this beer as I am missing work to explain how good it is. 655 charactersPhyl21ca, May 01, 2013

A - Black, creamy dark brown head, finger length... not much lacing 
S - Milk chocolate 
T - tastes like an imperial milk stout
M - Rich and creamy
O - Very disappointed, I would have much preferred the 4 KBS I traded for this... the beer is very one dimensional to me. I served the beer at 55 degrees and over an hour drank this beer and let it warm to room temp. It smells like carbonation was rushed if that makes sense to home brewers. I did not get any of the spice or vanilla... it just tastes like a creamy chocolate milk stout... not that that is bad, I just expected a lot more from this... I think this is the first beer where I gave the highest rating due to the appearance... due to it's price/rarity and what it is trading for I would give the beer a 2 out of 5. 812 charactersjdprmd, May 01, 2013

A - Pours super thick and jet black. Like motor oil. Probably one of the darkest, most viscous beers I've poured.
S - Smells of sweet chocolate, coffee, and a little bit of peppery spice. Maybe some cinnamon.
T - I don't know why, but I was expecting this to be boozy and maybe a little bitter - but it was not at all. Very sweet, creamy, and complex. Sweet chocolate up front, followed by some chocolate, and finishes with a spicy touch.
M - Liquid fudge. Very creamy and delicious.
O - I was very happy to have gotten a chance to try this. I think I actually like Abraxas from Perennial a little bit better, but if you are a fan of big, complex, sweet stouts - seek this out. 727 characterscnbrown313, Apr 30, 2013

A - inky oily black. Super thick. Minimal tan, brown head.

O - definitely in my top rung of stouts. Probably the best non-BA stout I've had. So much flavor and all of them play very very well together. A+. 627 charactersBeerandboards, Apr 28, 2013

Pours a pitch black with a motor oil complexion. Very very slight brown head. Looks the part of a big IS. 
Smell is vanilla sweetness upfront, followed the smell of sweet malt and some cinnamon. The faintest hint of chili is also evident. A great, complex smell.
Taste is sweet upfront with immediate notes of cinnamon as well. Lots of vanilla comes forward midway through and chilis come on strong at the end of each drink. Certainly a spicy element here, but far from overwhelming. A great combination and blending of flavors.
Mouthfeel is about right for the style. Very full and smooth, but not quite to the point of being sticky like, say, Dark Lord. 
Overall this is one hell of a beer, and one that demonstrates the ability to integrate some marginally out of the box flavors without making them feel gimmicky. No one note dominates and everything comes together fantastically. There are few things better in the beer world than when you find a beer that is both unique and rewarding, and this fits the bill. 1,173 charactersmechamifune, Apr 23, 2013

A:Dark dark brown like the color of black coffee it has a small tan head with a medium sized lacing around the top of the glass. It is completely opaque and there is no light get through its about as thick as you can get.
S: There is quite a wide range of scents in here the vanilla is defiantly the strongest, but you can definitely still smell the chilies and they blend interestingly. The cacao is present too in the background it is a very unique spicy scent that I can't really compare to anything else I've seen.
T: Ok so I am really glad I had this beer fresh as the chilies are present and prominent and mix in well with the vanilla flavor. There is so much depth to the flavor the chilies stay on the tonuge and start to blend with cacao nibs for one deep unique flavor I really can't describe it better but it is really good.
M: The feel is surprisingly thin for the style and abv but it does go down fairly smoothly the vanilla matches that well. There is no carbonation and with it not being thick it is kinda weird. This is pretty much the only aspect of the beer that does not blow me away.
O: Wow this is such unique beer it has some much different flavors and scents there is really nothing I can compare it too. It is also delicious I could drink this for days and drink it fresh the chilies really come out and mix in well. This is a hard to get but totally worth it get it if you can 1,436 charactersPinknuggets, Apr 23, 2013

A: Pitch black body with a dark head of 1-2 fingers with awesome retention and lacing.
S: Complex smell, a lot going on. The chilli is strong on the nose. The cacao is also strong and quite bitter. There's a good amount of spice, cinnamon is present, and a little vanilla but not too much. No alcohol on the nose.
T: Again, very complex, but different from the nose. The cacao mellows out with the sweetness from the vanilla. Unlike other chilli beers, the chilli is present throughout and works really well. Cinnamon is not as present as it was in the nose, a little overwhelmed by the chilli. A lot of flavors going on, but a really solid malt backbone is a great foundation with roasty characters and the overall medley leaves little to no alcohol burn.
M: Just the epitome of the style. Creamy and full, rich and thick, a little dryness from the pepper but wet otherwise. 
O: I loved this beer. Definitely worth the hype. A delicate balance that plays very well. It may not be for everyone, and I may have enjoyed this a bit more than my compadre, but it is really world class, and definitely the best non-barrel aged stout out there. 1,299 charactersMCain04, Apr 17, 2013

The taste of the beer is pretty complex, the spices come through pretty strong, the vanilla is very subtle in the finish. The flavors are very rich. The mouthfeel is thick, oily and heavy. The carbonation is minimal. Overall I was hyping this up in my mind to be much better than what I felt it turned out to be. You win some, you lose some.

Pours like thick black syrup with a late forming dark brown head. Smells of chocolate, chiles, and more roasty chocolate then some hints of vanilla. Silky chocolate milk up front with a tiny hint of the chiles. Very little if any cinnamon. Thickest beer i have ever tried. Very little carbonation. Finishes bittersweet, keeping it far from cloying. Chiles help too. But in any case it is dessert on its own. (4.5)
Got a chance to try the 2014 version from a generous sharer in line at the Swamp Head Bottle Drop. Thanks! Pours as before, but this years really has more cinnamon, vanilla, and chile notes than the 2013. I noted this in the DB Huna as well. Beautiful aroma and taste of cinnamon filled chocolate, still just only a slight hint of vanilla, and chiles that give this a clean finish and balance the sweet just right. Freaking awesome. (4.73)
Aged 2014 with the allotment to Catadors released later in the year. Same look. Less spice aroma. Taste is lacking any pepper heat or cinnamon flavor. Dark fruits going on here, very different. Overall an excellent stout but the adjuncts are just gone. (4.35)
Now trying a fresh 2015 from the Catador extras allotment. Same pour color and consistency. Really beautiful. Aroma is, well, lacking. A bit of cardboard, some roast and chocolate. No cinnamon or peppers. Flavor has light heat, no cinnamon, and the vanilla seems to overwhelm here and makes things really sweet. The inconsistency of the adjuncts in this beer is silly. Abraxas has slowly creeped ahead of this for me. (4.5).
2016 and 2017 with nearly no adjuncts but some cloying vanilla. This is getting sad. No more Huna day for me. (4.1). 1,739 charactersBMMillsy, Apr 13, 2013

A - Pours a pitch black body with two finger's of dark mocha foam. Settles down quickly and sits still after a few minutes. Moderate lacing with weak retention. Swirling does coat the glass in a thin brownish yellow film.
S - Starts off with roasted char and just a phenomenal chili aroma. It doesn't smell spicy or burnt or over the top, just delicious chili peppers sans the heat. Sweet vanilla, chocolate and earthy cinnamon really work to balance things out on the end. Has a sort of "faux-cinnamon flavored coffee flavored drink" thing going on, but in a good way. Really complex with a lot of different elements working seamlessly together.
T - Very roast dominant, and reminiscent of Founders RIS in the beginning. However things start to get complicated when the vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate take over. On the very end is some subtle roasted chili flavor and even further back is a slight burn of the tongue. For some reason I was expecting something spicier, not the case as this is beyond approachable. All the flavors are present and just meld together. Medium bodied and creamy. Alcohol is very well hidden.
O - I absolutely love this beer. Completely lived up to the hype for me. The ingredient lists reads off like a most wanted lists for the perfect stout, just fucking fantastic! 1,368 charactersdavey101, Apr 11, 2013

The smell belies cocoa, vanilla & coffee this is one of the best smetting beers I have had. Yeah I know kind of weird. Taste, is there a lot going on here! Vanilla, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon but the kicker is the nice spiciness of the ancho chiles everything melds so well. To try this at the day of release would be a treat. Well done! 453 charactersjimmy82063, Apr 06, 2013

I never really cared for Huna, I always used it to trade but damn 2014 huna is amazing. Loads of chocolate, spice, chocolate, chocolate and spice on the nose. The flavor has loads of chocolate, spice, chocolate and spice with a hint of heat from the chilies. Its like drinking a chocolate gingerbread cookie that's been dipped in chocolate.

Appearance- The Darth Vader of stouts. The blackest of the black with a dark dense head that slowly dissipates. Liquid is muddy rather than shiny. Leggy enough that it leaves no lacing at all. It all gets dragged back into the tar...Very commanding presence once decanted.
Smell- Strong dark chocolate, dense, earthy cinnamon notes, dried dark fruits, and smoky pepper. The nose suits this one well.
Taste- Salty caramel followed by cinnamony chicory coffee. Big creamy chocolate notes followed by a big, blunt, pure dark chocolate hit. Bitters out a bit before finishing smooth and chocolatey. Peppercorn zest and espresso take turns hanging out on the tongue in the aftertaste. Not boozy at all for an imperial, there's just way too much else going on here that masks it. Very complex, unique, and distinct. One of the best.
Mouthfeel- Smooth, dense and creamy start to finish. Like a milkshake that melted a bit at room temperature. Par for the course considering the style.
Overall- I've waited a while to get one of these, and I am extremely fortunate to have gotten one with some age on it. Very happy with it. I love the style, and this is by far one of the best. I have another cellaring, and look forward to another in the future. A must have for all beer enthusiasts.

Pours pitch black and pretty viscous with a creamy tan head that has some large bubbles.
Amazing aroma - chocolate, spices, roast, smoke, and mild chili peppers burnt sugars.
Flavor is incredible and moves through several phases as it warms up. Starts with semi-sweet chocolate then roast and coffee, followed by some smoke, vanilla, then chili peppers, cinnamon, wood and bitter cocoa and hops on the finish. The complexity is pretty cerebral.
Medium full on the palate with a bitter cocoa chalkiness. Bitterness really sticks with you, and I feel like it's more from the cocoa than the hops.
Drinkability is semi-smooth at chilled level once it warms up its chalky , but I think this works very well as a sipper. Smell is amazing intense chilly mild vanilla. AMAZING BEER glad to try twice in one week. 887 charactersUncleserg, Mar 29, 2013

Taste is extremely complex, sweet up front with toasted malt and heat on the finish. Soooo easy drinking for 11%, this beer could be dangerous.

As dark as they come... an incredibly stubborn finger of creamy khaki awesomeness forms drapes and drapes of oily lace. Honestly, this is an absolutely perfect looking beer.
Like sticking my nose into a tub of cinnamon ice cream. Homeboy Evan says it "smells like a Cinnabon factory." I don't disagree. Milk chocolate, very faint chile contribution, a mellow suggestion of coffee on the tail end of things. Very dynamic... I'm glad I chose to drink this fresh.
Wow. Like nothing else I can think of... cinnamon and spice, vanilla bean, bitter coffee/chocolate, dry chile aspect... every ingredient plays a roll in a delicious way. Entirely unique. I wish there was some more attainable substitute. Fuckin... yum.

I was entirely underwhelmed by it the first time, so I had to give it multiples tries in order to understand why this beer is praised so much. And I still don't get it. This just simply is not a good beer.
The look is good enough: dark brown-black with a wispy tan head that dissipated almost completely; few legs on the glass. Aroma was pretty basic for a stout, dark malts, some roast, with distant spice notes. For all that's put into this beer, the flavor profile is extremely weak. Dark roasty malts typical of a basic stout, stale tobacco, some sugary sweetness with a hint of cinnamon, cocoa powder, anise, something vegetal that could possibly be construed as hot pepper, but comes off more like dill pickles, with no real burn or nice peppery taste going on. The mouthfeel is on the thin side, which seems to be what makes this beer suffer the most; body is medium, very light for a stout, much less an imperial stout, and the alcohol warmth, while present, isn't too intense.
Of all the over-hyped uber-beers, this one probably impressed me the least, and to think that there is an entire day devoted to this beer, kind of baffles me. 1,184 charactersRifugium, Mar 24, 2013

Mr. Hunahpu pours an extremely dark black with a one finger khaki head that lasts for ages, and is one for the ages. The nose brings me massive joy, I feel like a phish kid listening to Harry Hood for this first time. Glorious aromas: Huge dark chocolate, vanilla bean, roasted malts, and some spice from the chili's. There is a strong scent a cinnamon as well. The taste is extremely unique for a stout, it's very impressive and still not was I was expecting after reading so many reviews. Flavors of extremely dark chocolate take over my palate, along with notes of vanilla, spicy cinnamon, and bitter caramelized coffee. Hunahpu's is extremely flavorful and complex but not as full bodied as I was expecting. It's more of a smooth bodied and drinkable stout. The nose is the best part and the taste follows in superb fashion. The spice sets this beer apart from other stouts. It definitely lives up to the hype! 984 charactersmnphish, Mar 24, 2013

Smells of sweet pie cherries, chocolate, faint spice and vanilla
Taste is much like the smell. More delicate and layered than the 2012 bottle. Slight burn from the pepper evident, but if I were given these beers blind, I'm not sure I'd pick out cinnamon or ancho. Delicious stout nonetheless. 500 charactersMasterCraft, Mar 20, 2013

A- Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. This is one thick beer as it is poured into the glass. It is pitch black with a tan colored head with good retention and lacing.
S- The aroma is fantastic and becomes more and more complex as the beer warms in the glass. The first two things that come to mind in the aroma are chocolate and cinnamon with dark roasted malts, smoke and a faint presence from the chilis. 
T- Wow! The taste is insane! Dark roasted malts up front with bittersweet chocolate and fresh strong espresso lingering into the finish. There is a lot of lingering bitterness as well from the hops. Finally, this beer has quite a bit of warmth in the finish from the alcohol. This beer seems like it is going to age wonderfully and should get better and better with age. 
M- The mouthfeel is unlike any other beer I have had. It is a full, thick, smooth and very moderately carbonated beer. 
O- Overall, Hunahpus lives up to it's mythical, legendary hype. Great job Cigar City! 1,006 characterscjgator3, Mar 16, 2013

Pours from the bottle like motor oil. Deep chocolate, incredibly dense head. The beer looks very rich, with a nice oily, slickness to the appearance. Pitch black except at the very edges where a reddish brown ring is visible. Very nice looking. 
Smells of cocoa, roast, sweetness. Smells good but the aroma is probably the most subdued aspect of this amazing beer.
The taste comes in waves of flavors, dark chocolate, sweet vanilla, coffee roast, some heat from the chiles and warming cinnimon finish it off. Absolutely astounding how good this is. The flavors are perfectly blended, with nothing overpowering. It's a very cohesive flavor profile.
Full mouthfeel, bit seems a little lighter that its base Marshall Zhukov.
Absolutely worth the hype. One of the best I have had. 794 charactersPowderhornphil, Mar 15, 2013
4.58/5  rDev +1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5750-ml brown glass bottle poured into a snifter glass. 2013 batch, released 09 March 2013. Served at approximately 45 degrees F.
Pours as black as 15,000-mile motor oil and nearly as thick, with a heavy viscosity evidenced by the legs created when swirled in the glass. A pathetic attempt at a head arises only after a bit of vigorous pouring and shows itself a deep mocha brown, quickly dying away nearly as soon as it takes form.
The nose is layered with goodness. Chocolate runs throughout in its many forms: dark chocolate, fudge, chocolate cake, cocoa powder -- you name it, you'll find it here. Intermingling with the chocolate notes are notes of dark cherries, a whiff of anise, a touch of chile, and a slight bit of sourness. Overall the combination is exceedingly enticing.
Rich and full-bodied, though a very low carbonation feel makes it feel somewhat lighter than it is, which normally is contrary but the lack of carbonation in this beer for some reason lends itself differently.
On the palate, a lavish melange of flavors take hold. Dark chocolate, rich with cacao, shows itself toward the front of the palate, with a bit of rich chocolate fudge following shortly thereafter. Espresso weaves itself into a rounded hit of ancho chiles around the edges, providing a pleasant yet subdued smoky-spiciness. Toward the back, that spice edges its way into a tinge of acidic sourness that quickly dies back down into a chocolaty spiciness in the long, mostly dry finish.
This is a rather decadent imperial stout that would probably fall into the realm of overly sweet and chocolaty if not for the splendid balance provided by the chiles. The blend of aging adjuncts makes for a wonderful departure from the imperial stout norm. Worthy of a massive release day? Well, I suppose rarity counts for something, and considering the release event is more like an overt beer festival than a mere showcasing of the brewery's wares, it certainly is a worthy centerpiece. 1,971 characterssuperdedooperboy, Mar 15, 2013

A- Pours pitch black, is very thick looking, even in a crappy plastic cup it produces a really nice dark, creamy mocha head, which leaves some thick lacing.
S- Great aroma of rich dark chocolate, espresso, roasted grain, cocoa powder, with cinnamon and a subtle spiciness.
T- As in the aroma, there are layers and layers of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, and cocoa powder. Also a nice amount of espresso and roasted grain, with a dry roasty finish that leaves lingering flavors of chocolate. The cinnamon is more noticeable than the chilis, but both are relatively subtle and add a great complexity without overwhelming the beer. The flavors are highly complex, delicious and also well-balanced.
M- Full-bodied, super thick, creamy and rich, the booze provides a bit of warmth but is mostly invisible.
O- I'm so glad I have almost a case of this. It's a delicious, complex, thoroughly-enjoyable beer, this can easily hold its own with the best stouts around. 992 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 12, 2013

Smells of vanilla, marshmallow, cinnamon, chili, chocolate and a little roast. Spices come through first on the taste then mellows into a nice caramel vanilla with a bit of burnt cacao. Fantastic overall and it seems to get better every year.

S: not all that crazy about the aroma. Has more of a burnt rubber aroma to me than chili pepper with cinnoman, hints of cocoa, vanilla and oak and some roasted malts. 
T: opens with chili peppers, dark chocolate and roasted malts moving to bitterness which is fairly severe and carries to the finish but brown sugar cocoa and vanilla come in late to balance the finish. The bitterness is a little tough to move past and get used to but it evens out eventually.
M: full thick body, oily coating the palate with light to moderate carbonation. 
Overall: i opened this the day after the 2012 release. one of the more unique stouts I have had. A little tough to drink but improves as you go with the drinker able to appreciate the complexity further into enjoying it. I think it would be perfect if it had a little more sweetness to it. Otherwise I can't really complain or imagine it getting much better. 996 characterskylehay2004, Mar 10, 2013

4.8/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Vintage 2011, opened today at about 50 degrees. Nice hiss of carbonation escapes as the crown is popped. Pours syrupy, motor oil thick out of the bottle with a half finger of densely packed mocha foam. The nose hits you with rich milky chocolate, carribean spice, a slight vegetal (green) chili nose as well, no vanilla of note but heady, complex stuff. The taste while not as complex as the nose brings really rich, chewy chocolate mousse brownie, whispers of roasted coffee and as it warms a pleasant spice of chili that plays beautifully with the heavy upfront dose of chocolate. Huge and chewy beer that just coats your mouthand all the way down. Alcohol is not noticeable though this is a definte sipping, after dinner beer that is best shared by friends. Highly impressive and worth the hype, scared to think how in your face this beast must be when its fresh. 866 charactersTrilogy31, Mar 04, 2013

Dark, solid black with extremely dark brown thin head. Sweet caramely smell. Full of different flavors with so much going on it's near indescribable. Bitter cocoa powder, thick dark chocolate, vanilla, some dark cherry and spicy notes with lots of booziness. Oily, thick mouthfeel and bitter but pleasant finish. This is an outstanding, albeit one and done type beer. I recommend the beer and HIGHLY recommend the Cigar City Tasting Room experience. 534 charactersjgurley, Feb 20, 2013

A: Pours a thick, viscous black with a cap of red-tinted dark brown which recedes quickly to a thin ring. No lacing.
S: Red chilis, cinnamon bark, decadent cocoa, cocoa powder, cherry. Like mexican hot chocolate.
T: Big dark, mouthcoating chocolate, cocoa powder, sweetish spicy red peppers which linger on the long finish, and some subtle vanilla and cinnamon. Slight off taste on the finish, like a coffee bitterness crossed with a spicy note.
M: Silky smooth. Full body, mouthcoating, and light but sharp carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden despite the 11% ABV.
O: Solid variation on an imperial stout, but nothing exceptional. The flavors don't quite come together as they could, and kicking up the vanilla--which is quite faint--would do well. 780 characterspmarlowe, Feb 13, 2013

One of the best stouts that I’ve tried so far. Beautifully dark and thick in the glass. Head was a shade of brown as dark as any I’ve seen. Mouthfeel was thick with mild carbonation. Aroma is rich with chocolate, mild roast, big vanilla and some interesting spice. Dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla all come through big in the taste, as well. I’m not a big fan of chili in beer, but it’s very nice in this one, only hitting in the finish with a bit of spice. This sort of super rich chocolatey imperial stout is right up my alley for the style. Hops are present but more of a background player. Pretty sweet but it works well for the beer. Just a big, rich beer that drinks even bigger than 11% abv. Very impressive. 799 characterspopery, Jan 26, 2013

A. Dark body with a copper head.
S. There is plethora of smells from chocolate to malts.
T. Starts of with malt and hops and finishes with chocolate coffee taste.
M. Warm and almost overwhelming with all the taste. Surprisingly the 11% alcohol was not noticeable.

4.42/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5-2012 vintage- 
A - oily black in color with a warm, cocoa-colored head and lacing.
S - Dark chocolate upfront followed by rich, roasted malt. I also get a bit of chili pepper and cinnamon in the end. As it warms it starts to sweeten with vanilla and some coffee bean/molasses.
T - There's a nice smoky heat in the finish, but it does not resemble chipotle peppers... 
overall, it's smooth and velvety, especially for the complexity and high abv. As it warms, there is a nice ebb and flow between the flavors of chili, cocoa, and cinnamon. This beer really starts to shine is it warms. It takes on qualities of mole and espresso.
M - It's oily and a bit thinner in mouthfeel then I expected. It's still chewy, which is nice, but it's not as viscus as I would have expected.
O - I had very high expectations for this beer. I probably built it up too much, but it's a damn nice stout with a flavor profile which I wish was more prevalent in the craft beer world. I loved "cocoa mole", so I was hoping this would knock my socks off... It did for the most part. It's a shame it's so hard to get a bottle or two. I would like to try it fresh now that I've had it with the better part of a year on it. 1,200 charactersZombiesAteMyDog, Jan 06, 2013

A- pours jet black with a three finger dark, dark brown head that quickly fades. My god, if the head stuck around for more than a few seconds, it would be the most beautiful beer I've ever seen in my life.
S- chocolate, vanilla, a little bit of heat...not bad, though the aromas are a little muted after nearly three years
T- the vanilla and cacao is still there, and creates a hell of a luscious, sweet, well-balanced beer with absolutely no heat. Dear lord. And actually, I'm getting some heat in the finish. Awesome
M- you can cut this one with a knife, but it better be pretty damn sharp. Motor oil!
O- this one is worth the hype. It aged fine, though I think fresh it could be amazing 766 charactersbigfnjoe, Jan 02, 2013

A: Jet black with a little head that stuck around.
S: The smell is overwhelmed with chocolate and roasted malt.
T: CHOCOLATE. Smooth roasted malt, dark chocolate and vanilla. It is extraordinary how prominent the chocolate is in this beer. I have literally never had a stout that had so much chocolate going on. Out of a tasting of 4 American Imperial Stouts.... This was by far my favorite.
M: Right amount of carbonation, smooth and creamy.
O: Compared to BCBCS and CBS, I think this beer should be rated even higher. The amount of chocolate in this beer is astounding. 643 charactersRinkor16, Dec 29, 2012

2011 Vintage
December 21st 2012 - according to the Mayan prophecies, the end of the world is roughly 15 minutes away. I guess this would be the appropriate time to crack open a beer named in honour of the Mayan hero who defeated the lords of the underworld and ascended to become the sun. 
Appearance: Hunahpu pours as dark as any black hole that is potentially about to devour our planet - not even the dying rays of the sun can yield any light along the edges of the glass. A rough pour yields a massive chocolate mousse coloured head that lasts really well for the Abv. and leaves a few small patches of lace as it recedes. A swirl coats the glass in a sticky brown residue, that fades into heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: Ah man, this smells divine! I am not sure I could ask much more from what is potentially my last ever beer! The Peruvian cocoa nibs take center stage, with intoxicating aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, dark chocolate mousse and cocoa dusted dark chocolate truffles dominating the first few sniffs. As the beer begins to open up, the vanilla beans combine with the cocoa to yield a sweeter milk chocolate aroma, alongside notes from the base beer, including roasted malt, dark roast coffee beans, molasses, dark caramel and some dark fruits. As the beer warms further traces of the chilis become apparent. 
Taste: Well, if the world does end in 5 minutes and 28 seconds time, I will die happy - this is absolutely delicious! The flavour has more in common with the base beer than the nose, but the cocoa, vanilla and chilis are all well noted. Flavour notes include: Masses of roasted malt, almost as much dark chocolate, some char, cocoa, dark roast coffee beans, light vanilla, some sweeter milk chocolate, sweet dark caramel, molasses, a little liquorice, some deep dark fruit characters (burned raisins, dark cherries and stewed plums), dark treacle, an earthy note and a light chili flavour. The finish is quite bitter and displays a distinct chili heat that tingles the back of your throat and increases in intensity as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel: Sadly Hunahpu is a little over carbonated for my tastes, at a medium (or just over) level and not quite as smooth as I would like. The body on the other hand is superb - full, thick and chewy. 
Overall: It would seem as though I finished my review just in time - 20 seconds left. . . . . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . . . . . . God damn it - nothing happened! Ah well, I guess I will just have to settle with enjoying the rest of this world class imperial stout. 2,611 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 26, 2012

Appearance - poured motor oil black and thick as a milkcomplement each otherth a deep robust chocolate mocha head.
Smell- right of the bat I get mexican chocolate ( bitter sweet dark chocolate with notes of spicy chillies) followed by a subdued sweetness. The aroma of this beer is fantastic and complex.
Taste- wow! Strong presence of roasted malt and bitter chocolate. The spice from the chillies is mild and not over powering they complement each other nicely. Finishes slightly dry.
Mouthfeel - Thick slick and chewy!!
Overall- phenomenal stout!!! Must try for stout lovers. Once agian cigar city has brewed one of the best imperial stouts made!!! 730 characterssolo103, Dec 25, 2012

Smell on this is great. Nice dark roast, hints of the vanilla and cinnamon present. Morning blend coffee.
Taste is off the charts for me. Perfect blend of traditional RIS flavors (coffee, bakers chocolate), with great add-ons. The vanilla is a nice sweet note, with the cinnamon present but not overpowering. I really love how the chiles come in on the back end and create this pleasant warming note throughout. Probably the most balanced use of chiles in beer that I've come across.
Mouthfeel is perfect for a big beer like this. Smooth, creamy, goes down easy without being cloying.
After having this a third time on Thanksgiving night I can say this has become my favorite beers in the "one day a year" special release category. I think I'm going to have to make the effort to get down there next year for release day. 1,019 characterssmokeypeat, Dec 01, 2012

Appearance is a deep black with a small head. It has a nose with vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, nuts and some bourbon. The taste is biscuits, coffee, more vanilla, faint chili peppers and more oakiness. Mouthfeel is medium, a very smooth, clean finish. Just leaves you with some boozy aftertaste. This is by all means a fantastic imperial stout, wish it was easier to get in NY-CT. 430 charactersmltobin, Nov 11, 2012

The aroma is of vanilla, fudge, chocolate, cocoa, gingerbread, coffee, roasted malt, dark fruits, molasses and lots of nice deserty aromas. Flavors is as amazing as the aroma, it really reminds me of gingerbread, with honey and ginger and cinnamon spice notes, vanilla, dark and sweet chocolate notes, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, fudge, dark fruits and molasses, with a hint of the chili that evolves the more you sip in it. The body is full with a nice sticky and creamy mouth feel. 536 charactersSamichlaus82, Oct 24, 2012

Had it at a tasting right after a sour the mouthful was full bodied. the taste of wood and oak runs through out and was amplified by choice of cheese that it was paired with. the carmel raiseny cocoa flavor that followed was fantastic. overall one of the best stouts one can have. 443 charactersBentLegBrewer, Oct 20, 2012

Thin deep deep mocha head on a black beer. "Is this ever going to stop dripping??" Alcohol legs damn near stain the snifter. Good collar, head retention, and lacing for a stout with this magnitude of an ABV. One of the thickest beers I've ever had.
Very present chile aroma, deep chocolate aromas.
All stated secondary flavors well represented...chiles, vanilla, cacao...cinnamon really comes though at the end, unexpectedly. Tastes bounce of each other and from what I gather the order is vanilla&gt;chocolate&gt;chile&gt;cinnamon.
Thick mouthfeel. Lower end of carbonation, fits.
Complex for sure. Glad I split this between four guys because I don't think I could, or would want to, drink this to myself. Started to become muddled acter the palate got a little fatigued. Thanks Elliott. 810 charactersDuff27, Sep 28, 2012

4.83/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Barcade in NYC. Very excited to finally have this acclaimed brew from one of my favorite breweries. Thanks CCB for getting it up to us and we're dying for more of your insane genius!
A: Thick, jet black body with a generous espresso head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Lacing on this beer is nuts and really sticks to the glass. 
S: Robust dark, roasted cocoa. Woah. Some vanilla, chillies and cinnamon in the background. 
T: Heavy roasted and dark malts. Then those cacao nibs become very apparent with the bittersweet chocolate taste, followed by sweet vanilla, and ending with a little hint of cinnamon and chillies. I'm getting some alcohol heat, but really not that much at all for the 11% ABV. 
M: A medium body with not much carbonation. Thick and syrupy but not overwhelmingly so. Almost deadly smooth. Lingering flavors on the palate are the semi-sweet chocolate and a bit of a burn from the chillies. Nice as fuck.
O: What an amazing and complex stout from CCB. From the hyped up and highly regarded Imperial stouts that I have tried so far(CBS, KBS etc.) this is the winner for me. Not overwhelmingly sweet, rich or crazy. The flavors work so well together in this one. I had to have two. Hunahpu is one of my favorite of this style, I'd go out of your way to get a pour or a bottle or two of this. Looking forward to one day trying the barrel aged versions 1,386 charactersGoogs, Sep 15, 2012

Black, syrupy pour. Tons of lace, great retention. Spicy aroma isn't as strong as I'd like; peppers come through with chocolate but not much more.
Huge surge of chocolate up front followed by the signature vanilla chile finish. Booze warms my throat as I swallow, brings more heat as it warms up. Massive body, as usual. Reinforces my belief that Huna is the best yearly RIS made in America. 448 charactersbrystmar, Sep 13, 2012

Very nice lace. Aroma is grapes, smoked meats, barbecue ribs, bacon. Interesting mix. Taste is fresh grapes, raisins and moves to a chalky, powdery finish. I think the base beer here, Zhukov, is one of my least favorite Imperial stouts. The Hunahpu treatment is a shoe in for an amazing beer, but the base beer is just so bad that you can’t hide from it. Maybe do the Hunahpu treatment to the 110K. 4/12/2010 8/5/7/3/14=3.7 535 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall tan head leaving small, thin trails of lace down parts of the glass. cigar city makes perfect looking stouts in my opinion.
S - Smells of chocolate, chill spice, dark roasted malt, coffee grounds and a tiny bit of vanilla. 
T - Starts off with a ton of dark roast quickly giving way to a mix of dulled chocolaty sweetness, day old coffee grounds, light chili spice. A touch of booze comes in at the finish, combining with some of the dark roast to linger on the pallet for some time.
M - This is definitely a big beer. It has lost some of its trademark spice over the years in the bottle but it still has a nice thick body and bold flavors with a good amount of carbonation.
O - This one was definitely showing its age. I will never turn down a glass of this beer. It is truly one of the best stouts out there. 889 charactersreto21, Sep 04, 2012
2.56/5  rDev -43.2%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 22012 vintage, thanks to macrosmatic for the bottle.
A: very dark, coffee colored head that dissappears quickly.
S: dark and bitter, little boozy with a meaty bite.
T: burnt chocolate malt, sharp and harsh. Not getting any vanilla here. Can pick up a tiny bit of cinnamon and bitter chocolate, not much pepper either. Pretty strong on soy sauce flavor here.
M: thick and rich, decent carbonation comes through.
O: not what I expected at all. Very little of the extra ingredients are shining through. Really a lot of soy sauce happening with a bitter chocolate fInish. This is odd because I have had Zhukov several times and that beer does not have these same base characteristics. Would love to get more vanilla to balance out these harsh flavors. This was a miss for me, would not buy again even if it was an off the shelf beer. 833 charactersdaryk77, Sep 04, 2012

A - Dark chocolate with a reddish brown one finger head that settled down to just foam. Medium body and leaves a thick syrupy coating on the glassy as the beer swirls
S - Vanilla and dark, roasted slight bitter chocolate are the main scents in the nose. You definitely pick up the chillies and cinnamon in the back of the nose. They are not overpowering and add another layer of complexity.
T - Dark chocolate and roasted espresso with a hint of vanilla sweetness is the main profile. The finish is a slight alcoholic with warmth, a slight bit of heat from the peppers and slightly bitter dark chocolate. The dark chocolate and pepper heat are what linger on in the finish. Everything in this one is well-balanced, play off of each other and adds a nice level of complexity
MF - Medium body with light carbonation. A bit syrupy and feels nice and smooth. The finish has a slight astringency and a slight burn from the peppers. Very nice.
O - A really impressive and complex stout. It does well to meld all of its different flavors together to create a unique flavor profile that combine vanilla, dark chocolate and peppers. This is a stout that comes out great from the brewery and doesn't require any additional time to settle down. Definitely see why this is a top beer. 1,310 charactersjeonseh, Sep 03, 2012

A - Poured ink black; one of the darkest pours I've seen. Half a finger of medium to dark brown head formed and receded to a thin layer.
S - A big hit of semi-sweet chocolate up front followed by roast, chili peppers, a touch of sweet vanilla and a hint of cinnamon. 
T - Big sweet chocolate flavour up front along with the chillies, which provide great flavour without a big spiciness. The roast enters in the middle with a touch of sweet vanilla. Cinnamon doesn't show up until the aftertaste, and adds another layer to the complexity of this beer. The flavours are very well integrated. 
M - Medium body, creamy. Light carbonation. 721 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Aug 05, 2012

The nose presents a heavy metallic cocoa with a slight vanilla spiciness. The taste is thick and intense with a combined effort from the vanilla and chilies working together to make this beer something truly exceptional and worth drinking. The thick, sweet, roasty, full body feels like silk and leaves a slightly spicy finish on the palate (more bark than bite)...it's almost like drinking a liquid campfire, minus the smokiness. Completely worth the hype and worth the money, enjoyed annually, especially this years. 626 charactersThePorterSorter, Aug 04, 2012
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My buddy Jeff brought this one back for me while on a trip to Tampa -- needless to say, it's been pretty tough sitting on this for the 2 and 1/2 years that I did. I shall not wait any longer. Review is from notes taken on 8/1/2012 and poured from the bottle (2010 vintage) into a snifter.
Appearance: Impressive to say the least -- comes out with a sharp *glug* and it's thick, like motor oil thick; starts with a scant 1/4 finger head that is that is a deep, dark, lush brown with some ruby hints to it; head fades to a wisp -- looks like oil sitting in a puddle; body is of course, entirely opaque; bit of an oily residue clings to the sides of the glass. This is pretty much exactly what I like to see come out of a bottle with a label that claims "Imperial Stout." Wow.
Smell: Pretty impressive as well -- big, robust and powerful, just rolls out of the glass; plenty of syrupy sweet and bittersweet chocolate/cocoa; lots of roast and earthy espresso-like aspects; perhaps some vanilla; dark cherries, but not tart ones, the especially sweet ones. I can't wait to get this into my mouth. 
Taste: Jesus, this beer just keeps getting better and better. Really, just like the nose, big, robust and powerful; lots and lots of chocolate right up front, and it's more of the bittersweet/baker's chocolate; plenty of earthy and roast malt to it that brings a nice bittering balance about it; and I feel that there's definitely some smokiness hanging out in here too that comes across a bit spicy, those chiles are coming through. 
Mouthfeel: Pretty much like a milkshake. The only beer I've seen that may rival this one in terms of viscosity is the '08 Dark Lord, and I don't know if anything will ever touch that beast. It's thick and heavy, creamy, smooth - it accomplishes all of this without being flat at all; a thick, sticky coating is left all over the palate and the teeth are left feeling gritty.
Overall: Part of me did not want to like this beer as much as I do, as I've only recently given my first perfect score for a beer, but this one has certainly earned it. Move over all challengers, this beer has everything. Impressive pour that makes you stare at it; amazing nose and an even more amazing set of flavors and a mouthfeel that just makes you want to get a spoon and scoop it out. F'ing fantastic. 2,317 charactersbamadog, Aug 02, 2012

S: Roasted malts and boozy; some coffee, chocolate, subtle vanilla and peppers, dark fruits; but man those boozy, semi-sweet roasted malts are prevalent; let's do this!
T: Similar to the aromas: big roasted malts up front, along with a hefty amount of booziness but it begins to balance out mid-way through the beer; then you get subtle peppers and vanilla and plenty of roasted chocolate and coffee and dark fruits; it finishes quite balanced for a beer this big
F: Pretty thick obviously, but not as thick and viscous as some beers that are this big, instead it's just sticky and creamy and really well done
O: I am so glad I finally got my hands on a bottle of this (and not just a tasting-sized glass at a festival); big and boozy but not overwhelming 875 charactersdbossman, Jul 18, 2012

S: (very strong) Chocolate up front, peppers, coffee, some vanilla, coffee. Amazing. Sweetness. No booziness in the smell.
T: Holy shit. Nothing like I have ever tasted. Thick dark chocolate and bitter coffee & hops, hint of vanilla and then pepper and cinnamon (I am guessing that's what I am tasting from reading the label) kicking in at the end. It's quite spicy too. Spicy-ness and hoppy bitterness linger in your tongue. I love how each of the flavors come out in the order listed above. Very unique and tasty. Sweetness is countered by the spice. 
M: Mouthfeel wise... it really reminds of Ten Fidy, but even smoother, thicker, and syrupier. This is perhaps the thickest beer I have ever tasted. Huge+ in my books. 
O: Ok, so I am not a huge pepper/spicy person in general but in this beer, it really really works. Although not my favorite stout of all time, I can appreciate how well it's been put together. Very complex and yet balanced. Bold and yet meticulous. I love it. It gets a 5 from me. 1,085 characterssukwonee, Jul 08, 2012

This is the most attractive appearance that I've seen in a stout. What makes it so is the head. I can best describe the color of the head as burnt sienna - a reddish light brown. Immediately after pouring, the head is only half a finger which reduces to a thin film with bubbly halo. The brew is completely dark.
The nose has dark chocolate, black licorice, hints of cinnamon, leather and alcohol. All of the smells meld nicely and are not too strong.
The taste is immediately rich dark chocolate. The dark chocolate flavor is on par with an artisanal bar of 60% cocoa chocolate. The rich aspect must come from the vanilla. There are some roasted malts and hints of lightly roasted coffee. At the end there is a combination of lingering heat from the chiles and cinnamon, as well as dark chocolate. The heat from the chiles and cinnamon are very subtle on my palate.
The feel is thick, rich and heavy. This is what I expect and have no critique.
Overall, this is one of the best stouts that feature cacao nibs and chiles. The base beer is big enough to mingle with the cacao and chiles. The alcohol is well hidden. All of the flavors play nicely without overpowering each other. This is an excellent brew from one of my favorite breweries in the nation. 1,308 charactersTotallyHosed, Jun 28, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was everything I’d hoped for and more, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Thick and viscous, sludgy black pour with a rocky tanned head that has excellent retention, good lacing on the glass. Aroma is roasty and sweet, with lots of chocolate and coffee, plus a subtler hit of earthy, spicy chilies and faint cinnamon. 
Flavor packs all of that; nicely rounded sweetness compliments the bitterness of the roast malt; there are prominent chocolate fudge and espresso notes, some dark fruit, and moderate chili heat that mainly emerges in the finish. Nothing too fiery or over the top but enough to let you know it’s there. Cinnamon is fairly subtle. A perfect blend of sweet and bitter. Booze is there but it’s not overly hot or in your face. 
Big bodied, thick and chewy, just the way I like it. Medium low carbonation, creamy and sticky, perfect mouthfeel overall. Lingers after the swallow, sweet and somewhat hot and tingly from the chilis. Exceptional. I was reminded both of Marshall Zhukov’s, the base beer, and of Alesmith’s Speedway Stout with chipotle and morita peppers. So glad I got to try this one finally! 1,134 characterstobelerone, Jun 13, 2012

Pours a thick dark dark brown like good black licorice with a half finger tan/mocha head that left slight soapy lacing and the beer itself coated the glass with a light brown coating.
The smell is great. You get nice loads of chocolate, slight vanilla, nilla wafers, graham crackers, earthy hops, cinnamon toast crunch and some chilies.
Taste is interesting nice bitter coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate, slight graham cracker and loads of chilies and earthy hops on the finish. Wish the taste was as amazing as the smell.
The mouthfeel was lighter than I had hoped but that might have been the chilies that changed my palate. Slightly too much heat on the finish for me but it did make it easier to drink the bottle all by myself, it would have been tough if it was sweet and cloying.
Overall q good beer that has the most complex smell and a different taste from other stouts. Don't think I need to actively seek out though, I've had it twice now and would like to try a barrel aged treatment to compare. 1,055 charactersSchmaltzy, Jun 08, 2012
4.3/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 2011 bottle poured into a snifter at a tasting. Beer pours pitch black, with a half a finger of chocolate brown head. Light lacing and plenty of alcohol legs as you swirl the beer. 
Nose is very rich in dark chocolate, fruity medium roasted coffee, and cinnamon. Sweeter milk chocolate and vanilla as the beer reaches room temperature. A light citrus hop note and roasted astringency as well. 
The taste leads with rich dark chocolate, with all the good dark fruit and berry notes I enjoy, a bit of coffee and malt roastiness. As the beers warms on the tongue, cinnamon spice and light vanilla comes through with sweeter chocolate. There is a lingering dark chocolate and dark roasted malt on the tongue, as well as an odd vegetal note that I'm guess is what remains of the chile flavor. 
Full body with moderate carbonation, enough for a very creamy mouth feel. Unfortunately, the chile flavor has faded quite a bit after a year, but an amazing imperial stout still remains. Drink this beer fresh to get the full experience. 1,030 charactersnataku00, Jun 06, 2012

Pours out black as oil with a super dark head, similar to the Marshall Zuchov's or DORIS the Destroyer.
Smells like greatness! Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, in that order. A bit boozey too, but that may be enhanced by the chili heat.
Taste is the same as the smell. Chocolate is predominant, vanilla is strong than coffee in the taste, and as I drink it I can feel my mouth starting to warm/burn a little from the chilis. 
Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Just like Zuchov's.

This thing poured thicker than motor oil. Thickest beer ive ever seen. Half inch head that looks like malted milk.
The smell is just wow. simply wow. Loads and Loads of chocolate. Sweet base beer underneath, and a hint of those peppers.
Powdery chocolate upfront, dry oaky notes, bit of cinnamon, and those peppers again. They all come, and in that order. Chocolate feels powdered, but only bittersweet. The spices kind of come in to accent the super sweet chocolate and base beer. Theres a slight hint of heat from the peppers way late on the backend. I like it, it just adds another layer of complexity. As it warms, the cinnamon comes out to play.
This beer drinks as thick as it looks, but not because of the base beer. Its so rich, deep, and complex that you cant drink too much too fast. Itd be like overload. 863 charactersVncentLIFE, May 29, 2012

T - Complex taste, lots of chocolate all over this one and the slight burn from the chili is somewhat rather satisfying was very surprised. Taste is great. 
M - Nice smooth creamy thick feel with low carbonation. Sticky sweet coating on the tongue. Outstanding
O - The best non-barrel aged stout in the world. I could drink this all day. What a genius move to use chili peppers in a chocolaty rich stout. Wish I had another bottle. 705 charactersSkiBum22, May 18, 2012

This has got to be the darkest stout I have ever seen. Absolutely pitch black. Even the head is darker than I've ever seen before. Really, really, dark. Motor oil thick.
Vanilla and chocolate sweetness, with a tiny bit of heat from the chili and cinnamon. Maybe a hint of coffee bitterness? There's a lot going on, but it's fantastically balanced.
Vanilla and chocolate upfront, followed by some smokiness and a little bit of kick from the cinnamon and chili. Everything moves along really naturally, with the flavors being quite distinct in terms of when they hit the palate. Well balanced, really complex. Alcohol is completely hidden by the great flavors.
Mouthfeel is about what you hope for from a stout. Really thick, low carbonation. It coats your mouth.
This a great stout, unique and flavorful. If you can get a bottle, do yourself a favor and get it. 907 charactersrodkin, May 13, 2012

Pours a pitch black with dark tan chocolate head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is rich decadent chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, light coffee, and a bit of chilies. Quite nice. The taste is sweet chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, cocoa, a bit of coffee, and some smoked chilies. The finish has a light bitterness and leaves a little bit of lingering heat from the peppers and a bit of roastiness. Full, creamy body with low carbonation. Great beer. It's definitely on the sweet side, which I usually don't enjoy, but it works here. All the flavors come together quite nicely. It also might have one of the best mouthfeels out of any beer.
5/4.5/4.5/5/4.5
750 ml bottle courtesy of J2Brew2. Thanks Joe. 2011 release. Pours a pitch black with a dark tan head. Possibly the darkest beer I've ever seen. Barely any light gets through even at the edges. Also the darkest head that I have seen. Good retention and lacing. Aroma is huge vanilla and dark chocolate as well as a little bit of cinnamon. Phenomenal. The initial taste is sweet with vanilla, dark chocolate, and some cinnamon. A light smokiness and a hint of the pepper comes through in the mid palate. The finish is very smooth with little trace of the alcohol coming through. A bit of pepper heat comes through after swallowing. Quite pleasant. A big, full bodied beer. Creamy mouthfeel. Not syrupy a bit. Medium-low carbonation Pretty much everything I could ask for in a beer. This is certainly one of the best beers that I have had.

The first thing I got in the aroma was smoked green pepper, and it stayed. The thing with peppers is that they'll dominate taste and smell (at least the green ones and while cooking). No difference here. While cocoa, cinammon, and coffee exist, they are tainted. 
taste is just a mess. The cedar, smoke, & peppers don't mesh well in this one. Cinammon adds something different other than musky stuff, but not enough save the tate. And the cocoa is muddle.

4.35/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewing the infamous Hunahpu's Imperial Stout from Cigar City Brewing. Scott's eagle eye saw this beer was on tap within 10 minutes after arriving within the gates of Dark Lord Day gates. We threw down our Tocobaga Red and Blueberry Muffin Brown and dashed for the line just before everyone else did. It was totally worth it.
Score: 95
10 oz tap pour served in a plastic cup and enjoyed at Dark Lord Day (04/28/12) around 10:30 AM. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: The beer is a very deep brown, almost black color. There's some dark chocolaty brown highlights atop the glass when held up to light. Given the "glassware" this beer is served it, it was hard to determine lacing or retention. Basically, the beer looked like motor oil. I plan to crack a bottle of this in the future and will have to revise the score if the appearance is anything more impressive when served in proper glassware out of a bottle and not at a festival. At Dark Lord Day, perhaps because of early morning stout fatigue, this just looked like a pretty good stout (as opposed to something visually impressive). 4/5
Smell: Chocolate and cocoa, cherry, cinnamon, chili peppers and coffee. A little vanilla bean and tobacco. Hint of dark fruit. Nice aromatic medley of spice here. 4.25/5
Taste: Less heat on the tongue than Mexican Cake, but there is still plenty of spice and flavor. Chilli pepper, milk chocolate and a little coffee. Only light heat prickle on the midpalate and back of tongue. Muted vanilla. Plenty of cinnamon throughout. Sweet fig upfront. Layering chilli heat prickliness on the palate. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation. Slightly sweet and creamy mouthfeel. 4.5/5
Overall: Absolutely outstanding imperial stout to have the pleasure to sip and enjoy in line for the Three Floyds' Brewpub. There is a real nice spice and chocolate flavor, and I can see why this beer is so sought after. Hunahpu is much better than Mexican Cake. We also got a glass of the Apple Brandy Zhukov right after the Hunahpu kicked, and that beer absolutely blows this one out of the water.
Recommendation: Seek this beer out unless you are chilli flavor averse. There is less heat than there was with Mexican Cake, but more flavor, synergy and balance.
Pairings: Gingerbread cookies
Cost: $25 for a 750 ml bottle or $10 for a 10 oz pour at Dark Lord Day. 2,356 charactersjegross2, May 06, 2012

A - Pours black as can be with a slow rising tan head, which dissipates slowly into thin lacing. The legs on this are incredible.
S - Lots of cocoa, a little heat, the vanilla adds a little bit of smoothness, then the cinnamon adds a very light sensation to the nose. I can't tell if there is really any chili in the aroma or if it is dominated by the cinnamon.
T - The chilies are present in the in the background from start to finish. There is a slight heat the entire time, like biting into a fresh but lower-medium heat pepper. Cocoa really dominates while the heat isn't. The cinnamon is certainly evident towards the middle and then end of the flavor. It works well with the cocoa. I think the smoothing of the flavors and what keeps the heat in check is the vanilla. The vanilla itself doesn't seem dominating whatsoever. The chili didn't come out nearly as much when I had it on draft this past weekend at DLD'12. Some roast comes out in the finish with the chilies. After a few sips, the roast is more noticeable in the background and finish. As this happens, the chilies somewhat fade on the tongue and the cocoa becomes smoother. 
M - Oil-like. Coats the palate. There are so many beers in the imperial stout category that would seem like water if consumed after this one. This still is able to feel silky.
O - I'm having a tough time thinking of a better non-BA stout. I love spicy food, but I don't really want it at all in my beer. For me, the flavor would be at a peak if the chilies were gone and the vanilla was a little more noticeable. Appearance and mouthfeel are perfect. 1,682 charactersclaaark13, May 02, 2012
4.62/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Reviewed from notes. 2010 edition, poured from bomber into a snifter.
A: Pours black and opaque. Small, dark tan head. No visible carbonation.
S: Coffee, spicy aroma. Has overtones of soy sauce, although this fades as the beer warms and vanilla aroma begins to be present.
T: The complexity of this beer is amazing. Chocolate/cacao, coffee, soy sauce, molasses. More dried chili flavor than I remember on tap. Following the aroma, the soy sauce fades & vanilla comes through as the beer warms up some.
M: Smooth, thick mouthfeel, not much carbonation. Sweet finish/molasses flavor with chocolate aftertaste. Moderate alcohol presence.
O: I really like this beer and I think, love it or not, everyone owes it to themselves to try it. I've had it several times on tap (both the '11 & '12 version) but this is the first 2010 I've had, and the first bottle I've had. There was more chili flavor here than I recall from previous and the "soy sauce" aroma & flavor was new. Unfortunately, I don't have any way to know whether those were the production batch or the result of aging. Perhaps I'll open the '12 bottle in 2014 & compare.
EDIT for the 2014 edition: Huge cinnamon flavors present in this year's batch that plays well with the vanilla and cacao nib flavors. Some spicy pepper flavor just near the swallow, but minimal after burn. No "soy sauce" character present in this year's edition. 2014 truly the best base Hunahpu thus far. 1,439 charactersmacrosmatic, Apr 30, 2012

A - Pours jet black with a nice one finger tall tan head leaving small, thin trails of lace down parts of the glass.
S - Smells of chocolate, chill spice, dark roasted malt, coffee grounds, tobacco and a tiny bit of vanilla. This one has muted quite a bit from when it came out but it is still pretty good.
T - Starts off with a ton of dark roast quickly giving way to a mix of dulled chocolaty sweetness, day old coffee grounds, light chili spice and some wet tobacco. Not as muted down as the nose is, still very nice. A touch of booze comes in at the finish, combining with some of the dark roast to linger on the pallet for some time.
M - This is definitely a big beer. It has lost some of its trademark spice over the years in the bottle but it still has a nice thick body and bold flavors with a good amount of carbonation.
O - This one was definitely showing its age. When fresh, this beer is nearly impossible to beat. I will never turn down a glass of this beer. It is truly one of the best stouts out there. 1,160 charactersorangesol, Apr 30, 2012

Had this side by side with the 2011 and Bourbon barrel aged versions. Huge thanks to Eric (Holland) for hitting this long time want.
A: Pours a jet black body with dark khaki head forming on the pour. This stuff is viscous. Some splotchy lace is left down the glass.
S: Roasted malts, some sweet chocolate and a nice subtle spice are present in the nose. The nose is a tad boring considering what there is in this beer.
T: The taste is much better. Nice spiciness from the chilies and there is a touch of some cinnamon. Dark chocolate, some figgy fruit notes and some roasted malts round it out.
M: Chewy and thick. The carbonation is on the lower end there is a residual heat from the chilies.
O: A very solid beer. The 2011 vintage definitely lost some of the luster and complexity that the 2012 had. This is a stout that must be drank fresh if you want to retain any of those flavors from the spices and the chilies. 1,023 charactersTreebs, Apr 29, 2012

2012 bottle
A: Pours a vicious opaque jet black with just over 1 fingers width of a dark mocha colored head with a darkness rivaled only by Marshal Zhukov (imagine that).  The head is dense, but dissipates moderately quickly down to a bubbly thin film and outer ring, which leaves a fair amount of lacing.  
S: Big milk chocolate, spicy chilies, roasted malt,  a significant dark fruit presence with fig and raisin, vanilla, and a touch of cinnamon that I probably wouldn't have picked up without the label indicating so.  
T:  So delicious.  The initial sip brings big milk chocolate and dark fruits followed on the back end by roasted malt and a grassy characteristic.  I also get notes of chilies that give it a spicy kick, vanilla, coffee, nutty characteristics, and some bitterness on the backend.  This is very complex and really, really good. 
M/D: Smooth with a chewy mouthfeel, carbonation seems slightly higher than the base beer which acts to make it less sludge-like.  It coats the palate nicely with each sip and has a nice, full body-warming characteristic. ABV is very well masked, and drinkability is reasonably high for such a big beer sipper.  
O:Overall, a fantastic beer.  The chilies and vanilla add a nice component to what is already a really great base beer.  Obviously worth trying if you are lucky enough to get ahold of one.  Is it better than MZ?  Yes, but IMO they aren't that far apart.  Also, I do think the regular Hunahpu is significantly better than the rum barrel aged one.  The barrel aging dominates the flavor profile and masks the beers complexities IMO.   1,652 characterszac16125, Apr 28, 2012

3.47/5  rDev -23.1%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a flat looking crude black and brown, almost no head on it, nothing to provide lace or retention. Aroma, didn't pull any chile or cinnamon out of this one, just smelled like a lot of two row and roasting, which is fine.
Taste, muted chile flavors, nowhere near what a good chili beer should have. Solid roast flavor, chocolate was mild. Thickness of the beer was substantial, but for all the discussion about how complex this beer is, I found it to be extremely run of the mill and straightforward. Some chocolate malt, some minor bland chili additions, I don't know where the notion of cinnamon comes, maybe you just have to drink these uber fresh. Unfortunately, I didn't pull any of those flavors out of the fresh rum barrel one either. Didn't really see what the big difference between this and Marshall Zhukov was, other than that one is even more sludge like. 
Just flat out, one of the more disappointing top 100 beers I've ever come across. Not a bad beer, but really not a great one either. Take a standard giant stout, make it limited, blam.
No wonder so many of these are on ebay vs. drinking them yourself. 1,127 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Apr 25, 2012

A- pours a deep black with no light penetration. There is a mocha-colored, one-half finger head that rests atop this dark beast. Very little lacing is present.
S- Coffee, dark chocolate, chilis, vanilla, roasted malt, dried dark fruits come through in the background.
T- like a party! Vanilla presents itself immediately and is followed by cocoa. Dark fruit and molasses/brown sugar enter in shortly thereafter. Coffee makes a cameo somewhere in the mix. Finally, chili arrives casually late on the finish. At no point are any of the flavors unaccompanied; each just stands out at a different point.
M- Thick with enough carbonation to break it up just a bit. A coating is left with each sip.
O- I absolutely loved this beer. I would really like to try one of the barrel-aged variants. The complexity is unbelievable. I am glad that I drank this fresh so I have an experience to compare the BA version to if I ever get to try it. 1,043 charactersUngertaker, Apr 22, 2012

A. Pours thick, syrupy, black. A huge three finger dark brown head that lightens to a medium brown and settles to a half finger. Each swirl knocks it back down to dark brown, though. Excellent lacing and tremendous legs that coat the glass. Head is thick and creamy. One of the best stouts I have seen. 
S. chocolate, brownie batter, some vanilla, coffee roast, and cinnamon. 
T. Rich fudge, vanilla bean, some milk chocolate, roasted coffee beans, cinnamon, and chili spice. Spiciness is very apparent on the finish. Drinks like a chocolate shake with a kick. 
M. Extremely viscous with a near syrup like consistency. One of the thickest beers I have had. Seems a little undercarbed. 
O. An excellent stout here. The chiles really add another dimension to this and make the experience all the better. Jam packed with fudge and vanilla, this is a treat. Will definitely continue to seek it out. 912 characterssiege06nd, Apr 15, 2012

Vertical tasting of 2012 and 2011.
A: Pours an opaque jet black in color. The beer has a thin extremely dark mocha head that reduces to an extremely thin layer over the majority of the surface of the beer with a thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Light lacing is observed.
S: Lots of aromas of dark roasted malts, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and some spicy peppers (the spicy peppers are far more present in the 2012).
T: There is a very nice presence of lots of bittersweet chocolate, freshly ground coffee, and dark roasted malts upfront in this beer. The chili pepper flavors are present in the 2012 but had mellowed out of the 2011. Nice lingering bitterness.
M: Full bodied with low amounts of carbonation. Very smooth.
O: Awesome flavor and great complexity in both the smell and taste. This beer is very enjoyable but is a sipping beer, albeit one that I would enjoy sipping all evening long. 942 charactersdbrauneis, Apr 15, 2012

This pours a deep but not all that viscous black, surprising given the base beer, but with a nice pretty, frothy dark head. On the nose there is a complex interplay of chili, cinnamon, hops, etc. To me there is just too much going on, too many things seeking dominance and not achieving any sort of balance between them. In the mouth this clears up a bit as the chilis and alcohol combine for a heat presence, with cinnamon and roast providing the backbone of the flavor. The body is medium heavy with a long pleasant finish of heat once the various secondary flavors die out. 
Overall, this is a beer in which the quality is absolutely evident but for me it just doesn't sit right. I see why people enjoy it, but I wasn't all that impressed and would rather drink the base. 894 charactersEricCioe, Apr 14, 2012

4.65/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big thanks goes out to Matt Rego for sending me this bottle. 750ml from the 2012 release, into a Deschutes snifter. 
A: Absolutely pitch black, an aggressive pour yields a small brown head that foams up to about a quarter of an inch and fades away leaving a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Completely opaque, and easily one of the darkest beers I've ever seen. 
S: Incredibly complex, there is a ton of chocolate, caramel, chili peppers, cinnamon, molasses and brown sugar. A lot of coffee in here as well. Smells massively sweet and rich. Really impressive how complex the nose is here. 
T: Absolutely massive on every front. Huge chocolate and vanilla make for a ton of sweetness that leads into a strong roasted/burnt malt profile that is massive but never reaches overbearing. This roasted profile adds an acrid bitterness that pairs nicely with the hop bitterness in the beer. As it continues to warm the chocolate and vanilla really shine and become the dominant flavor profile. Just a bit of chile pepper heat and flavor finds its way in, but it is subtle and adds to the flavor without being distracting. Outstanding stuff here. 
M: Absolutely perfect here, chewy and thick, massively sticky on the lips and overall just incredibly rich. No heat at all for an 11% beer, which is impressive. Spot on. 
O: Thoroughly enjoyable and completely lives up to the hype. Great flavors that blend and balance to create an incredible drinking experience. My hat is off to Cigar City, this stuff is unreal. 1,521 characterspokesbeerdude, Apr 01, 2012

3.45/5  rDev -23.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5This is a review of the one released December 2011. My sister and brother-in-law brought it with them from Tampa.
Appearance: black and syrupy, low head formation, but dark tan/brown foam (never seen head this dark!)
Aroma: big notes of molasses, dark chocolate, soy sauce, rum, vanilla, and pipe tobacco
Flavor: full malty sweetness (almost cloying), but the burnt sugar, coffee, smokiness, rich roast, and cocoa notes do balance it out a little bit; laced with vanilla, tobacco, and cinnamon (in the background); finishes sweet with long-lingering caramel, roast, and molasses
Mouthfeel: full (almost syrupy) body, mild carbonation, some alcohol warmth, but most of the warming comes from the chili spice that slowly builds
Other comments: Woah. It is almost shocking how dark and thick this beer is when it emerges from the mouth of the bottle. I actually did a double-take. I have never seen a beer this dark. Drinks like a meal. I'm glad I tried it, but I probably wouldn't buy it again. 997 charactersGreenCard, Mar 31, 2012

A: A pitch black in color, pour looks like motor oil, a nice tan head that fades away rather quickly, and a nice coating of lacing as you drink this one.
S: Chocolate all over this bad boy, the chili was not as present as was on the taste but slight hint, and nice mixture of dark fruits.
T: Complex taste, lots of chocolate all over this one and the slight burn from the chili is somewhat rather satisfying was very surprised. Taste is great. 
M: Full bodied slight bit of carbonation, very sticky.
O: Slick, and creamy, a great tasting Imperial stout, definitely reccommend to all if you can get your hands on it, great beer for 200th review!!!! 671 charactersthedoubler55, Mar 30, 2012

Pours oil black with a quarter finger deep mocha head. Spotty lacing. Very nice. 
Sweet cinnamon chocolate aromas are predominant. Excellent!
Big hit of cinamon and vanilla flavors hit first. The bittersweet chocolate is right there with it. A little burnt coffee in there. The mild chili pepper heat is almost just in the aftertaste. Bold, complex and delicious. The 11% abv is barely perceptable through all that goodness. 
Nice smooth creamy thick feel with low carbonation. Sticky sweet coating on the tongue. Outstanding. 
One of those rare few beers that actually lives up to the hype in my opinion. Really one of the best stouts I've had and totally worth the trip from Atlanta to Tampa for my birthday! 772 charactersThickNStout, Mar 26, 2012

4.61/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of my favorite beers of all time. Most recently tried a 2012 bottle, but I've had the 2010 and 2011. The 2012, fresh, is outstanding. I felt like 2011 was a little hot, and 2010 I never had fresh. So... 2012 version here in this review.
A red ring of death looks welcome on top of this beer as it pours out chocolatey black and thick. It smells of roast, vanilla, and a bit of spice, but mostly sugar/burnt sugar. The taste leads with that, and it takes a few sips before the spice presents itself in the back of your throat. If it weren't such a clingy beer, that Mexican chocolate feel wouldn't develop, but the body is so richly thick that it does. It hangs on, it perpetuates, and it builds. Ounce after ounce of vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, alcohol, and chili pepper spice build and build in the palate. 
It's honestly kind of crazy. As a dessert beer split by 4 people, threre's really nothing better. As a brew that you sit down at the bar and drink? I'd pass. But that's not what this beer is. It's a treat, a special occasion, and a gift. Thanks, Joey! Thanks, Cigar City! 1,088 charactersafksports, Mar 23, 2012

A great bitter chocolate and ruby hue, inky darkness, low retention but great creamy collar. Low carbonation.
Smells... Cinnamon, bitter grain, super bright chiles... Light toasted grain. Just overwhelmed cinnamon and chiles.
Flavors... A light Belgian yeast sweetness, burning cinnamon, huge Chile. Fineshes with cinnamon spice, Chile heat, and smoke. Like charred paper. way too much Chile.
Huge creamy silky velvet character. Strong spicy burn that lingers. Sticky flavors. Amazing stout body but the test of this fails. 561 charactersKhazadum, Mar 21, 2012
4.2/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42011 Vintage. Thanks for sharing, Chad! Pours a very thick black with small-medium dark tan head that diminishes quickly. Scent has a TON of cocoa to it. From first whiff, I was greeted with lovely cocoa and cinnamon. Some bitter-sweet chocolate with just a bit of chile aroma...I'm assuming there was more when this was fresh. Taste is spicy cinnamon at first, which immediately turns to sweet cinnamon. Some vanilla there as well. There sure is a lot of cinnamon flavor to this beer, which makes for a unique stout. A lot of cocoa and chocolate with just the slightest chile flavor. All these flavors mesh really well together. Wouldn't call it a complex beer per se, but definitely well-balanced. ABV hidden well. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is one tasty imperial stout. I'm crossing my fingers I will get to try one of the barrel-aged versions. 893 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 20, 2012

2012 vintage.
Pours an opaque black with a dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, chili, and cinnamon. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa nibs, vanilla, cinnamon sticks, and a slight chili flavor that warms the back of the throat with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a nice thick mouthfeel. Overall, this is an amazing beer with a very nice balance of the ingredients especially in the taste. 638 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 19, 2012

A: The blackest beer I could ever imagine. Opaque even while being poured with the absolute darkest brown head I have ever seen. Lots of foam forms with great retention. I would not change one thing about how this beer looks.
S: Tons and tons of roasted malt, stronger than I remember from last year. I do get a good amount of caramel sweetness to balance. Dark chocolate is also quite strong with a hint of cinnamon and spicy chili peppers. I don't get much sweetness from the vanilla, but it's not much needed.
T: This beer seemed to do a lot better after I let it sit for a bit, so I'll review it off of that. Intense dark chocolate and roasted malts with caramel and light vanilla sweetness to balance. Cinnamon and chili peppers come in after that, but the cinnamon is certainly stronger. I don't get much in the way of hops, but the beer seems fairly well balanced between sweetness and bitterness.
M: Extremely thick with great carbonation.
O: This beer is very complex and quite tasty. Very strong dark chocolate flavors mix well with strong roast and cinnamon flavors. There are a ton of strong flavors here, but they mix together quite well. 1,210 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Mar 15, 2012

A: Pours a very deep black with a tan colored head, about one finger in height upon pouring. Not a lot of retention with moderate lacing on the glass. Some lace formed when the beer hit the sides, but didn't last very long. 
S: Dark and bitter chocolate, roasted malt, a little bit of caramel, and very faint peppers and vanilla. There is a little smoke as well, but plays a backseat to everything else. 
T: Really nice dark chocolate flavors mixed with some vanilla and a little bit of roasted malt. The chilies come through stronger than the aroma indicated, much to my liking. A little bit of caramel and smoke as well. 
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. The alcohol is well hidden and there isn't any heat from the peppers really, they just show up as a nice addition to the flavor profile. 
O: A big fan of this beer, very complex. On of the best chocolate/pepper beers I have had. Easy drinking for style/abv and very smooth. 1,011 charactersmdaschaf, Mar 14, 2012

Thick, viscous, dense black beer with reddish brown head. Smell is full of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. The taste is bittersweet with loads of chocolate and espresso, followed by a pleasant chili pepper kick. As Hunahpu warms up it tastes sweeter and the vanilla flavors come through better. The chili spice feels palate cleansing and sets up the next sip. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous with low carbonation.

Reviewed 3/4/12
Appearance: Pours like oil, with one of the darkest heads I've ever seen - the beer itself is pitch black, with a brown head, small amount of spotty lacing
Smell: So much going on, it's overwhelming in the best way possible - chocolate in pretty much every sense of the word - chocolate malts, baker's chocolate, cocoa, cacao nibs, semisweet chocolate, fudge - chilies, of multiple kinds - burnt malts, very roasted, caramelized malts - caramel, burnt sugar, vanilla
Taste: Similarly amazing - chocolate - milk chocolate, semisweet chocolate, baker's chocolate, burnt malts, coffee beans, roasted coffee - the use of chilies is fantastic - adds a mild chili heat - a touch of wood, but this aspect is pretty blown away by the roasted malts, burnt malts, chocolate and chili magic
Mouthfeel: Heavy, slick, decadent - minimal carbonation, but it works perfectly
Overall: Beer? This is more like a magic potion
There are so many good things about this beer that I don't even know where to start. The base beer is great, and the chilies and chocolate additions are fantastic. This is magnificent. 1,164 charactersangrybabboon, Mar 11, 2012

Black as night under a reddish auburn/orange head with pretty dang good retention. Insane aroma, big in the cacao department and pasilla. I cook with pasilla a lot and this delivers. The aroma is an earth monster, with coffee and roasty notes. Full flavored, coffee, roasted barley, the chiles hit with an earthy assault, and as the beer closes out I get some spice and a hint, just a hint of vanilla and a bit of sugar, a little less dry then I like. A little hot and a little bitter from the roasted malts and alcohol, but otherwise its a nice full bodied beer. 636 characterspmlondrigan, Mar 10, 2012

2011 Vintage
A: Modest rusty brown colored head with decent retention settling to a film of small bubbles atop this deep dark brown beer. Brew looks thicks, like used motor oil. No lacing to speak of.
S: Vanilla, milk chocolate, toffee, and some spice. Was surprised the vanilla and spice notes were still so strong considering the vintage. Scent is quite robust and completely masks the high ABV.
T: Semi-sweet cocoa nibs are most prominent, love a stout that isn't overly sweet, followed by hints of spice and vanilla. Flavors permeate throughout the tasting, but never become dull or overwhelming.
M: Fairly heavy and lightly carbonated, just enough to keep the beer crisp following each tasting.
O: Very, very good beer. Would love to try again, but next time fresh. 790 characterstjkinate, Mar 05, 2012

2011 vintage
Appearance: Thick, dark and heavy. Pours heavy and still. Head is a dark brown. Thin cap disappears almost immediately and leaves the beer looking like a still black pool.
Smell: Roasted malts and a huge cocoa note. Tiny hint of cinnamon on the back of the nose. Vanilla and milk chocolate coupled with hints of leather. Burnt malts with a touch of char. Coffee beans and fresh tobacco leaves. 
Taste: Rich chocolate and the taste of fresh coffee beans wrapped in dark chocolate. Mild spiciness builds after a few sips. Vanilla and cocoa in good measure. Huge roasted component runs toward burnt with a nice undercurrent of char. So much malt. Tobacco and baker's chocolate.
Mouthfeel: Nice full body with minimal carbonation. Syrupy and thick. Slick and chewy. 
Overall: Huge stout and then some. Tons of malt depth. The added flavors make the base beer something entirely new and enjoyable. Great depth and ages well. Nicely played. 1,017 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Mar 05, 2012

A - My god. This really is the perfect looking imperial stout, imo. Huge, roasted chocolate head that lingers. Pitch black with slight stickiness that clings to the side of the glass.
S - Big chocolate and cinnamon nose. Absolutely huge on both. Slight alcohol on the back end.
T - I remember linking it slightly more fresh. Big time cinnamon taste. Slight chili to go along with the chocolate (and cinnamon). The vanilla has faded and let the cinnamon take hold. When I drink this fresh again, I'll probably come back and give this bad boy a 5 on taste.
M - I remember getting a lot more viscosity and chili to compliment the cinnamon the last time. The mouthfeel is very good, don't get me wrong. Just not great this time around.
O - This is one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had. I would drink this continuously if I had access. When I checked in on Untappd, my comment was simply "bury me with this beer." 1,070 charactersraveskdr, Mar 04, 2012

A: Pours extremely thick and viscous, completely jet black. Used motor oil is no exaggeration here. Head is the darkest I've seen, dark brown with shades of a deep dark red.
S: Big...vanilla, caramel sweetness, epic amounts of milk chocolate and bittersweet chocolate, definite spices and peppery notes here as well. Alcohol is very well hidden. Smells epic.
T: Hugely flavorful and diverse, with layer upon layer of complexity. Simply epic amounts of chocolate and dark chocolate malts, vanilla sweetness underneath, cinnamon and pepper notes interwoven throughout. Very balanced, with no flavor overwhelming the others.
MF: Smoooth. Full bodied and viscous, but darn creamy and drinkable.
O: Phenomenal stuff. This thing is not overrated, it blows other syrupy offerings like Dark Lord out of the water with its complexity, malt profile and balanced adjunct flavors. Highly recommended, and I will be seeking this out again soon. 1,101 charactersScotchboy, Feb 29, 2012
4.53/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a thick, viscous, oil-like liquid that chug-a-lugs out the bottle. There is less than a fingers worth of red headed, mocha head. Beautiful color with an amazing colored head that separates itself from the others. 
The nose has a crazy density of of rich and bitter chocolate. There is certainly some earthy pepper and spic but note too noticeable or determinant. The cocoa et al has a crazy amazing flavor that is much more robust and flavorful than your average brew. A hefty sweetness surrounds the brew
The taste is full of bitter-sweet chocolate that leaves a nice dry feel. There is some matched chilies involved that create a smoked taste rather than one that is actually spicy. The smoked chilies bring an intense leveling factor to the table when integrated with the massive cocoa flavors. Chocolate covered fruits like strawberries and raspberries back up the cornucopia of fruits introduced by this brew. Boom status to the core.
The mouthfeel is outlandish, as are all of CCB’s brews. Thick as motor oil and classy as the Queen’s dinner. This brew creates a new standard for those who love stouts. CCB is not to be messed with!
Overall, this is an amazing brew that has integration of flavor, style, body, and bad-ass-awesomeness! Everything one could want from a stout, this bad boy delivers. BOOM. AMAZING. 1,333 charactersChugginOil, Feb 28, 2012

T: Starts with a dusty chocolate up front, followed by a chili heat in the back of the throat which is still balanced by a sweetness that permeates the mouth. Lastly, there is some alcohol heat that hits the back of the throat and causes a brief resurgence of the earlier flavors. 
M: Thick body, but avoids being syrupy. The balance of complex flavors keeps it from being cloying in a very different way.
O: A very unique stout, but a very good one too. Bold, complex flavors take a familiar style and make it into something exceptional. 736 charactersRedSpecial1, Feb 11, 2012

I had this beer for a long time in my posession and i was waiting for the right occasion. This tasting was at the right moment.
This is the very first CC beer i had which is really really very good.
Very creamy, full body. There is a bit too much coconut on the front of the taste. Very oily beer. Can i get some more bottles please? 488 charactersBrabander, Feb 10, 2012
4.48/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle of the 2010 vintage. Poured into The Bruery snifter (RIP). Split between 3 people.
A: This one pours literally like motor oil. It's liquid darkness, much like Marshall Zhukov. There is a faint head initially, then swirl gives deep dark tan head. Deep dark lacing sheeting when you swirl as well. Alcohol feet and trails obviously. No carbonation really on this one. It's fairly still.
S: Tons of dark chocolate. Bitter notes. I do get some of that chili as well. Dark fruits are hidden there as well, raisins, prunes, plums.
T: You get a really nice dark chocolate bitterness on your first sip. I get some burnt sugar and molasses type flavors as well. Initially I did get that chili burn, which is surprising given the two years of age on this one. But then it goes away, and I get dominated by deep dark and milk chocolate. This is a good thing. This has an extremely long finish. Very, very complex beer. Bravo.
M: Full bodied. Total mouth coat. It's almost too much after a while with as little carbonation is there. Docking a few points for that.
O: This is a world class RIS. Definitely an A for me. My only knock is the lack of carbonation and HUGE mouth feel of this. It's tough to tackle without a partner or two. Definitely split this one up! 1,270 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 10, 2012

A - A pitch black liquid and a brown lacing.
S - A beautiful scent of oak, dark chocolate,dark fruits, raisins.
T - The taste is of strong chocolate, cocos, raisins, coffee and brown candy sugar. This is so balanced and complex. Supurb stuff.
M - The body is full and the carboantion is soft. It supports the taste on an excellent way.
O - This is good stuff, no question about it. 549 charactersMar02x, Feb 08, 2012

A - Thick, dark black color. Nice 1-finger tan/caramel head. After a nice swirl you can notice a reddish tint to it. Possibly from the cinnamon or chiles.
S - Can smell all of the dark fruits associated with this stout. There is a slight hint of chiles along with the cocoa and vanilla.
T - Such a smooth, creamy stout. You can really taste the sweetness of the dark fruits and cocoa. Again the hint of chiles is there despite it being almost 2 years old. Very complex. Really is amazing.
M - Like I said before, very creamy feel. Slight stickiness. Exactly what you would expect after with the appearance, smell, and taste.
O - One of my top 3 favorite beers. This one being 2 years old, can only imagine what a fresher version would be like with the extra pop of chiles and cinnamon as I am sure this one had mellowed a bit. I cannot wait to try more in the future. Awesome. 922 charactersbeckard13, Feb 07, 2012

It poured out get black with lots of tan foam and lacing. Very thick
The smell had hints of chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla, but it was overwhelmed by chili peppers.
The taste started out with some faint bitter chocolate, but smoothed out as the beer warmed. The cinnamon and vanilla were very present, but the overwhelming flavor was pepper. It wasn't very spicy, but did have a lot of the flavor characteristics of a hot chili pepper. It was well balanced and very enjoyable.
The carbonation was very heavy- I think too heavy for what I wanted, and it took a lot of swirling to get it to calm down. It is a little lighter bodied than I had hoped for the flavors, but very good nonetheless.
It was excellent for an imperial stout, but after what my neighbor said he had to give to get it, I don't think I will be pursuing this to have again. 889 charactersrachelerin, Feb 03, 2012

Not sure of the year but this is from the first bottling of the beer. Deep black pour with that signature Cigar City imperial stout head. Just a ridiculous shade of neon brown. Boozy roasty aroma, robust chocolate, fresh coffee, light iodine. Massive dark chocolate flavor, light smokiness, cocoa, and a mild vanilla bean note. The chilies are pretty subdued at this point but they still impart a bit of flavor without any heat. Viscous heavy bitter mouthfeel, not boozy. Nice glass-staining legs. Killer beer. 589 charactersillidurit, Jan 31, 2012

Review from notes...
Poured out looking like Texas Tea, straight oil with 2 fingers of creamy mocha colored head. Excellent retention.
The aroma on this stout was simply amazing. Huge notes of chocolate followed by roasted malt, spicy chiles, vanilla and getting some cinnamon on the back end. All of the notes are in sync with one another to make a very delicious aroma.
An explosion of flavors filled my mouth with each sip. Decadent chocolate, chewy fudge, roasted malts, vanilla bean, cinnamon and very earthy chiles with some heat backing them up. Very complex and it only gets better as it warms.
Thick, chewy but extremely smooth. Low carbonation but it's the perfect amount for this stout.
This beer was insane. Extremely complex, smooth and delicious. This one definitely backs up all of the hype that goes along with it. Can't wait to get another bottle. 919 charactersdcloeren, Jan 23, 2012

A: Pours near black with a very thin light brown head. Almost no lace. Very thick looking. 
S: No super smelling but I get light notes of fudge, chocolate, and something faintly spicy (chilies). 
T: Chocolate definitely dominates followed by the cinnamon. Vanilla really comes through in the finish and aftertaste, and I get a vague hint of spicy chilies throughout. The aftertaste also has light notes of coffee and a touch of sweet caramel. Overall very chocolatey with a good dose of cinnamon. 
M: Thick body, low soft carbonation, and a smooth and heavy mouthfeel that is a little tingly from the chilies. The alcohol is hidden well.
O: A very unique and interesting stout. I’ve don’t think I’ve had one that quite tastes like this beer. Good use of cinnamon. This beer was better than some of the –bal aged ones in my opinion. 931 charactersscottfrie, Jan 18, 2012

Pours viscous and dark black with chocolate edges. Dark mocha head, fades to a collar, with some legs. Roast and chocolate nose with strong vanilla and cinnamon and light chili heat. Flavor is similar to Zhukov, not as unique as the nose. Roast malt and char are strong with potent vanilla sweetness and dry cinnamon. Chili spice is present in the finish, but not as strong as I remember from previous samples. Full, viscous body with light carbonation and an oily finish. Smooth, balanced and complex, an exceptional american stout, duh. 559 charactersyourefragile, Jan 14, 2012

A- Pours a motor oil black with a 2 finger dark mocha head that dissipates fast leaving a thin cap. Some spots of lacing are left behind.
S- Charred peppers upfront followed by sweet vanilla beans, spices, roasted malt, brown sugar, faint coffee beans, smoke and dark chocolate.
T- Plenty of earthiness with some sweetness with charred peppers, cinnamon, vanilla beans, roasted malt, coffee beans, smoked malt and slightly bitter cocoa nibs at the end.
M- Medium carbonation with a rich full body. No alcohol heat is detected. 
O- One of the better beers I've had recently. The chili peppers were incorporated very well into this brew and despite the high abv and big body, it was still was fairly drinkable. This beer deserves the hype behind it and I hope I can try the barrel aged versions in the future. 905 charactersiadler, Jan 11, 2012

Pours black as night and it produces a finger width of very dark mocha colored head and leaves a ring of lace with each drink. The nose has a lot of chocolate, then the next most powerful is vanilla, and lastly cinnamon I don't pick up any peppers which is a little sad. Now with the taste some things change that I didn't expect where I didn't smell a lot of cinnamon I pick it up more in the taste also with the vanilla. The chocolate play background to the cinnamon and vanilla, but this time I pick up just a slight hint of pepper which is very hard to notice (maybe I need to try it fresher). The mouthfeel is amazing its just what I expect out of big world class stouts. Huge massive, chewy body that coats the inside of my mouth and lingers. This was a huge want of mine mainly due to having Conquistador De Muerte from FFF and loving it due to the spicy pepper presence. I expected Huna to be just as spicy but alas it wasn't. But all in all an amazing beer that I would love to try on tap. 1,044 charactersphisigben, Jan 06, 2012

A- pours jet black, just like motor oil...small tan head with a reddish accent to it, other than that though pretty basic and typical for a stout of this caliber
S- there are a lot of things you can pick-up, especially knowing what's in the beer already. it's mostly dark chocolate, with some bourbon on the end of it, possibly some chili in there but again I was looking for it...some dark coffee notes, pretty sweet but yet bitter at the same time
T- lots and lots of dark chocolate...it has a bitterness to it but there are no hops present, it's a bitter chocolate taste and especially aftertaste, and that's where some of that chili taste comes in...definitely has some bourbon to it as well which I wasn't expecting. This has a bite to it, much more than Zhukov's but it's more complex...even though there is a consistent bite it gets better as it warms up like a good stout should
M- thick...just the right amount of carbonation
O- this was much different than I thought it would be...I'd preferably like to let one sit for a few years and see how it is. It has bitter characteristics to it but overall I think it's a little too sweet...it also has more of a bite than I was expecting. Overall a very solid offering from CC, but I've had a few stouts that I'd put a notch above this. 1,344 charactersmgp2675, Dec 27, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to someone (Chris?) for opening this at the Hunahpu's showdown. I've had this beer numerous times, but never gotten around to reviewing it. 2011 vintage reviewed, but 2010 sampled at the same time. Served in a Hill Farmstead glass.
A - Looks like all the barrel-aged Hunahpu's we had, but with more foam. Angry dark red foam that settles to a thick collar, leaving spotty lace as well as a glass-staining brownish film. Pitch black body.
S - This is the first time I've sampled the new 2011 vintage, and I'm shocked how present the cinnamon is, as it's a flavor I never really picked up from the 2010. Plenty of vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malts, as well as some vegetal chile notes - you can tell these aren't the super-spicy varieties. Alcohol is well-hidden, even as the beer warms up, and there's great complexity and richness.
T - The taste is similar, but there's less of the sweet and cacao and vanilla and more of the charry, roasted malts of Zhukov. Chocolate flavors veer towards the dark and bitter side of things, and the finish is slightly tarry. Still, these are only minor quibbles, and on the whole the flavor is delicious. Less chile pepper and spice presence here as well.
M - The massive body, chewy and viscous, has always been one of Hunahpu's main strengths, and the carbonation is low but sufficiently present to support it. Creamy, thick, mouth-coating, and with shockingly little alcohol presence.
D - An instant classic in the US craft beer scene, and a beer that holds up extremely formidably with its barrel-aged brethren. I'd actually prefer to drink this over the Virgin Oak version, and probably the bottled Bourbon edition as well (Four Roses I think?).
Unfortunately the 2010 vintage is not holding up so well - the adjuncts seem to be fading at non-linear rates resulting in unpredictable and strangely unbalanced flavor combinations. I don't recommend holding onto this beer for more than 12 months. 1,951 charactersMasterSki, Dec 20, 2011

All be below stand true except the chillies and cinnamon were slightly more predominant, balancing the sweet chocolate sludgy base beer. So for my money, I liked the fresher example more. A world class beer regardless, but I would recommend drinking sooner rather than later if you have any.
2010 Version courtesy of mgoblue5743 from an in-person trade.
Pours the most viscous black oily looking sludge I have ever seen come out of a bottle of beer to date. The head is the darker brown I have ever seen, period. As it slowly dissipates you get a stupid amount of soapy dark brown lacing.
Aromas are off the charts. It begins with a melange of dark bitter cocoa and lighter sweet milk chocolate. Second whiff I get various kings of spices that initially overwhelm my nostrils, highlighted by cinnamon and mild chilies. Wow this is crazy... as it warms a little more I get the vanilla beans and some stronger molasses.
The tastes begin with a nice milk chocolate sweetness up-front then mixed with loads of dark chocolate and lesser vanilla, followed by some growing espresso bitterness and spice (chilies and cinnamon) on the back end. Spices were much more apparent on the nose than in the flavor but are still definitely there. Roasted bitterness becomes slightly burdensome on the palate as it warms, but I am nit-picking at this point.
The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy on the tongue. The carbonation is minimal which helps to enhance the creaminess on palate. Flavors linger on the palate forever, initially you never want this to end and luckily it doesn't for long after you sample. As with the flavor, the heft and complexity of this beer weighs on you as you consume further.
Overall, this was fantastic. Leaps and bounds above Marshall Zhukov. Not a drop of alcohol. So many different flavors dancing on the tongue on palate. Not an everyday beer by any means, one to sip and savor because of it's super crazy complex flavor profile and amazing viscosity. Probably better consumed with a friend or two (although I enjoyed mine solo for my first experience, albiet over a 2 night period). 2,186 charactersclaspada, Dec 15, 2011

Appearance: Pours like motor oil, the darkest of dark liquids... even while the beer is being poured the beer does not relenquish its hold on any light that may pass through it... opaque
Taste: As complex as the nose... every sip lends a different element of the beer, all of which are exceptional and are a pleasure in themselves... one sip is more vanilla forward, the next cinnamon and the next you finally get the heat from the chillies... I even get some milk chocolate, must be the vanilla and chocolate malt/cocoa nibs shinning together, you don't know whats coming but whatever it is will be delicious
Mouthfeel: The thickest beer I have consumed, coats every inch of your mouth... definitely a sipper but each sip is bliss, the alcohol may slow you down somewhat but thats not a bad thing
Overall: The best stout I have had... ever. I love barrel aged stouts but this beer gives me the vanilla I love from barrel aging, the roasted malt and dark chocolate from imperial stouts, as well as a little kick from the chillies for a little something different and is almost like a new experience with every sip...

Holy sh*t. I've poured some thick and vicious stouts, but this was scary. Used motor oil from an 86' Suburban. Head like a chocolate milkshake. 
Cocoa aroma, chocolate, slight coffee, chili back end. Roast and evil. 
Chocolate milkshake. Slight chili taste back of the throat, huge roast. Some oak and vanilla. There's a lot of flavors fighting for attention here. 
Thick, full and coating mouthfeel. Epic.

Deep black body, opaque, no light breaking the surface. One to two finger mocha colored head rests comfortably atop. The head works its way back slowly leaving moderate lacing stuck to the sidewalls. 
The aroma is truly remarkable. The combination of rich cocoa, chiles and cinnamon is just outstanding. The nose is more balanced than assertive. Each scent is displayed at the appropriate level to appreciate the beer as a whole. At first whiff the chiles and cinnamon are centered only to quickly meld into the cocoa sitting just behind. 
Hunahpu's opens with a deep, dry cocoa flavor. The flavor develops and becomes slightly more sweet as the beer moves back on the palate. The chiles and cinnamon flavors develop just under the chocolate. The sweet and spicy warmth really stimulates the palate. Vanilla flavors in subtle through out but provides a pleasant cohesiveness. 
Full bodied stout. Carbonation is on the lower end and very appropriate. The texture is smooth and creamy, very pleasant on the tongue.
Cigar City has done a fantastic job with this beer. The flavors are layered to perfection, producing a highly enjoyable drinking experience. One of the best beers I have had this year without question. Seek this one out. 1,284 characterskzoobrew, Dec 02, 2011

Poured and looked like thick motor oil with a thin bubbly tan head that easily dissapated. Smelled multiple layers of chiles, cinamon, DARK CHOCOLATE, and a little vanilla and booze.
Average carbonation, viscous in mouth like mashed potatoes.
Taste is as it smells all wrapped in brown sugar and some raisin action. No booze, lingering pleasant roastiness in mouth. Very little heat from the chiles, just the perfect amount.
It s a beer version of a chile'd dark chocolate bar! Absolutely fantastic, though so thick get at least 3 friends to share the bottle. Cigar city never disappoints. 647 charactersJips, Nov 27, 2011

Smell is tons of cinnamon, chocolate, milky coffee and just a bare hint of spice. 
Taste is exactly as labeled. Spicy cinnamon up front with nice chocolate notes. One of the best chocolate beers I've ever had. The chiles are barely noticeable, I really wish they had been a little more up front. The chocolate lingers quite a while, probably because the beer is so dense. 
This is a fantastic spiced stout, one I'd love to have regular access to. 586 characterskirok1999, Nov 24, 2011

Poured at 55 deg. a deep black out of the bottle with a mocha colored head, about an inch thick. I also saw some red in it as well. Aroma's of cinnamon and spice pervade the aroma, although you can get bitter dark chocolate and dried prunes, and some vanilla. This beer coats the tongue, with a very creamy texture. Like in the aroma, lots of cinnamon and lots and lots of chocolate. As the beer finishes, you'll get some spice and heat from the chillies. The creaminess lingers long after you've swallowed, too.
All and all, an excellent beer that any big stout lover should try and find. 684 charactersbschinelli, Nov 23, 2011

-2011 vintage
 Thick and syrupy on the pour. Black in color, almost purple. The head of foam was one of the most amazing aspects of this beer. It displays a rich mocha brown color with a red tinge to it which when given a swirl in the glass is truly unique to look at. This rich, blood red color appears in the head of foam, I'm assuming comes from the pasilla chiles used during brewing. Just wonderful to look at. 
 Lots of peat on the nose, with a earthy cinnamon aroma behind it. Has a fresh green, fruity smell from the chiles and some spice. Dark chocolate, raisins and prunes round out the nose. As the beer warms I'm beginng to get more spice, cinnamon, vanilla and tons of chocolate. 
 Very soft carbonation. Creamy and velvety on the palate. Vanilla, cinnamon and a rich chocolate taste upfront. The peat doesn't show up as much in the taste as the nose. There's a rich underlying chocolate taste that carries throughout the beer, with a nice touch of sweetness. Like drinking a liquid chocolate bar. You pick up the heat from the chiles in the finish, with a slight lingering spice on the tongue. Somewhat chalky in the finish as well and plenty of dark fudge. 
 -thanks again Donnie, this was a great beer! The Odell Woodcut and Port Brewing Older Viscosity were fantastic also. 1,378 charactersCashMoneyVagrant, Nov 23, 2011

A- Pours thick and jet black. Looks syrupy when poured into the glass. Very dark khaki, brown head, recedes very quickly. So thick the beer leaves a film on the glass for a moment.
S- Very nice aroma. Get chocolate and vanilla mostly in the nose. Roasted malt notes throughout sprinkled with a little spice here and there.
T- Wonderful flavors throughout on this drink. Even better than I remember. Right out of the gate I get a bitter chocolate flavor mixed with cinnamon and chile spice. Chocolate flavor then blends nicely with sweet vanilla flavors. The sweetness takes over in the middle. Roasted malt flavors hold everything up nicely. Ends with sweet vanilla and still some chocolate flavors and again get some hints of the chile lingering. 
M- Full body. Low carbonation. Thick, almost syrupy feel to it. A little dry too.
O- One of my favorite beers I've had. There was a lot of hype around this, and it definitely out did the hype for me. Could drink this all night long if I could. Now I can't wait for next year's release!! 1,177 charactersHosP, Nov 21, 2011

S: Lots of chocolate, backed by a mix of green and dried chilis. Cinnamon takes a distant back seat.
T: Wow... like dark drinking chocolate with a shot of strong espresso added. Chili comes in, but just faintly. Vanilla is also present, but without much sweetness it stays in the background.
M: Low carbonation. Full-bodied, but not as thick as the appearance would suggest. Lingers very nicely, but the residual sweetness is low enough to keep it from becoming cloying.
O: I've had a couple bad experiences with aged versions of this beer (unpleasant green pepper aromas), but this one redeems it completely in my eyes. An extravagant beers, but not so overwhelming that I couldn't easily drink the whole bottle. I do think this experience puts this beer firmly in the "drink fresh" category for me, though. (This bottle has been in my refrigerator since my buddy brought it home from Hunahpu Day.) 1,104 characterskscaldef, Nov 15, 2011

 Hunaphu's is by far the darkest beer I recall drinking. Unlike any other stout I remember, Hunaphu's seems to pour BLACK rather than dark brown! The head is moderate, very dark chocolate brown, with good retention but hardly any lacing. I do notice legs on the snifter. I don't think I can quite describe how awesome this beer looks... it's the devil in liquid form!
 The aroma is very heavy on vanilla with some chocolate coming in at the back. Initially I loved it but it got a tad tiring over the course of the beer. Something something juicy and spicy... could it be the hops? Or is the chilies? Tough to say.
 Unlike many other "specialty" stouts, the stout is not lost in Hunaphu's. Bitter and roasty with a burnt, charred finish, Hunaphu's is stout first. I can taste and smell the fire! On this delicious stout base, there's plenty of chocolate, coconut, malty sweetness, and perhaps a little too much vanilla. Not that I mind, but it's too strong for an entire 750. Hard to pick the chilies but that could either be the "age", or the fact that my palate doesn't pick anything hot until it's real hot ;-) Regardless I feel the telltale heat at the back. Good.
 Mouthfeel is spot on, thick and chewy although the carbonation could be dialed down a notch or two. Overall, Hunaphu's stands out in its complexity against straight up Imperial Stouts while avoiding the booziness of barrel aged stouts. I wish the vanilla notes were dialed down a bit, that's all!

Pours out midnight black with very little head. What is there is a luscious chocolate color.
Dark chocolate and vanilla are the dominant aromas, however the chiles make their presence known the more the beer warms.
Tastes lean a bit toward the sweeter side, which I usually don't like, but it never became cloying. Good flavors of rich dark chocolate dominate the palate. A touch of vanilla and oak as well. Chiles weren't detectable until it warmed to room temp, but then asserted their presence to add some complexity without overpowering anything else. Very good balance.
Viscous and thick without becoming cloying. Carbonation level was fairly low.
A good beer that become an amazing beer once it reached room temp as the chiles really came out to add a unique complexness to this. The dark chocolate flavor that was persistant throughout was the highlight for me. 921 charactersjmarsh123, Oct 31, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: (2011 Vintage) Poured into my SN bubble glass, this stout pours as dark as deep space with a tasty looking chocolate milk colored head that appears as thick a viscous as the stout below it.
S: The aroma is lacking a bit in complexity. Dark chocolate is present and up front. The aroma is very similar to its base beer, Marshal Z, the complexity of the additions that make this brew "Hunahpu Worthy" have faded. Notes of vanilla beans are and the peppers are faint.
T: The flavor profile still is solid. This brew is rich in chocolate and roasted malt, without being too sweet or heavy. The chillies at first have disappointingly faded, but as the beer warms they spice up the back of your pallet and add a whole new dimension to this beer. The cinnamon is present in the slightest touch, an is opening up more with warmer temperature.
MF: the mouthfeel is full, rich, creamy, and the best carbonation CCB can produce! ;)
Overall, I love having this beer fresh, and I'm going to love attending Hunahpu day every year. Excellent beer, a must have fresh and aged. 1,067 charactersTKEbeerman, Oct 28, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Part of my stout tasting on October 22nd, 2011. 2-3 oz. into snifter. Stoked to try this one. 
A – Intensely thick and oily pour yields the darkest mocha-colored head I have seen yet on a stout. Similar to Marshal Zhukov’s, this brew coats the glass with a filmy, brownish-yellow residue. Lots and lots of legs clinging to the sides. Intense appearance here.
S – Definite roasted almonds and vanilla up front. A lot of depth underneath those two primary flavors - slight pepper spice, cinnamon, nutmeg, tobacco, leather, a variety of chocolate, and coffee. Beyond that, and I must be imagining this, but I get the sense of oak barrel as well. No alcohol. 
T – Dark chocolate, espresso, roasted nuts, and cinnamon transition into a blend of vanilla extract and pepper near the back of the drink. The flavors are very layered but don’t quite fully integrate. Finishes slowly with a sweet chocolate finish contrasted with a touch of pepper burn and bitterness from hops. 
M – Adequate in this category in every way. Smooth, heavy, rich. 
D – Mole in a glass? Not quite but it’s damn-near complex enough. Takes the base beer and improves on it in a variety of ways. Will pursue more. 1,200 charactersAuracom, Oct 27, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed a 10oz pour from a 1 Pint 9.4 FL.OZ. Bottle in a tasting w/ other Darkness Day friends in front of the Vintage Lot (#2) @ Surly Brewing Company in Brooklyn Center, MN. Poured from the bright yellow, sun blinding bottle w/ the Hunahphu Pharoah on the front into my Schlafly Tulip Glass. Does not have a freshness date but for this style, wasn’t a problem. 
Aroma- VERY strong chocolate and roasted aroma from the beginning! Awesome to see this in this stout. Has the best Cigar City aroma punch like all their brews do. Chili Peppers are very light in here and can’t find in the nose. All around, perfect. 
Appearance- Pours a .5 finger head thats dark brown stays for a minute. Has an extremely viscous body with a dark brown/coffee color and opaque. Leaves a bit of sudsy lacing on the glass. 
Flavor- Has a ton of chocolate (bittersweet) upfront and then bit of spiciness at the finish. Has a weird sourness also in the ending... Not sure if this should be an attribute I should have picked up or not. Very strong roastiness and light, european coffee flavors all the way through. Not much bitterness, just alot to drink!
Mouthfeel- Full Bodied but goes down thin and smooth, Low Carbonation, Creamy, but has this unfavorable note of sourness... Tons of roastiness and chocolate is left on the palate. 
Overall Impression- I’ve been very interested in enjoying this one since having other brews from Cigar City. A real nice chocolate, roasty, and bit of spiced brew but not sure about this sour note I caught... I’m going to ignore this in the overall because the Hanahphu was awesome! Enjoy this if you can (I had to split 2 Schlafly Reserve 750’s to just get a 10oz pour!). 1,700 charactersDCon, Oct 26, 2011

Look: Pitch black and totally opaque with almost a 1/2 inch very dark tan head and great retention
Smell: Bitter chocolate brownie similar to Zukhov for obvious reasons and has hints of chili and alcohol
Taste: Very big and sweet chocolate upfront like eating a chocolate brownie covered in chocolate fudge and the backend has very subtle hints of vanilla and chili
Mouthfeel: Full body with low carbonation and a bit sticky
Overall: Just a world class beer. 688 charactersDarthKostrizer, Oct 25, 2011

Split with my brother. Big thanks to Andrew for the hookup on this one...
A - Pours black with a two finger dark brown head. There is a good amount of head retention, and a little slippery lacing to be had. Lace could have stuck to the glass more, but I really enjoy the dark brown color of the head. Sexy...
S - Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, and some chilli/spice...
T - Starts out with a good dose chocolate. Cinnamon, coffee, and vanilla are also in the mix. Finishes with a good amount of chilli heat, and some lingering chocolate. This one is deliciously sweet. Not usaully a fan of spice in stouts, but the cinnamon really adds an unique complexity that i'm really enjoying...
M - Thick and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Definite full body viscous feel...
O - This one definitely lives up to the hype. Cigar City comes through big with another excellent brew. Definitely something i'm going to be trading for in the future...

A: Pours like thick oil. Deep, dark, and heavy. It looks like if you spilled it, it might stain a counter top or table. The head is small, but a glorious deep brown. 
S: Very sweet and chocolatey. There is a good bit of coffee, but not so much to overpower the cocoa smell. If I think real hard I can pick up a touch of the chili, but that might just be my imagination. 
T: The bitter chocolate mixes well with the touch of chili, the hints of dark chocolate give it a bitter sweet thing that I like. The vanilla is somewhat subdued. 
M: Thick. Very Thick. Like syrup. Carbonation is appropriate. 
O: Overall very tasty, but it doesn't blow me away like other beers of this style. Still F-ing good and a great gift from an awesome BA. 771 charactersBeejay, Oct 24, 2011

Poured in to my Portsmouth tulip
A: This beer pours a rich, thick deep opaque brown, almost black. A two finger of dense, creamy, dark brown head. I've never seen the head of a beer so dark. Nice head retention, leaving nice wisps of lacing.
S: Nose is rich roast and cocoa, licorice, vanilla, and some dark fruits. 
T: This is possibly the best stout that I've ever had. Chocolate dominates the taste. A myriad of cocoa, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate that dance back and forth. A light undercurrent of vanilla and roast notes that mix nicely with the chocolate. Just the slightest hint of cinnamon in the finish that really accentuates the chocolate notes. 
M: Medium to fuller bodied, moderate carbonation, lightly creamy body, with a nice sticky finish.
O: Goes down very easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, well hidden kick (allow the beer to warm up or it will seem boozy), and a fantastic representation of style. This is one of the best beers that I've had in a while and may possibly be the best stout that I've come across. 1,129 charactersJayli, Oct 24, 2011

Thanks for sharing, DarthKostrizer!
Black on black with a thick, heavy, and persistent espresso brown head. Spots of lacing left down the glass. Gorgeous! No carbonation issues whatsoever to report here!
Fantastic aroma consisting of rich, chocolate shoppe sweetness, mild roasted and coffee character, and then just a lingering presence of roasted peppers. This beer smelled different every time I put my nose to the glass, and I found something new every time. Delightful.
The flavor was just as lovely as the aroma: rich, gooey chocolate, huge roast character, and lingering earthy and smoked peppers. I'm glad I got to try this one fresh, as I'm worried the distinct heat from the peppers may leave this beer sooner rather than later.
Thick, heavy, substantial, and coating mouthfeel.
A fantastic, rich, divine, delicious chocolate/chile big stout. 872 charactersehammond1, Oct 18, 2011

This one pours a very dark dark brown in color on the verge of being black. It's very viscous and coats the glass. It has a nice creamy chocolate brown head that sticks to sides. The aromas consist of sweet chocolates, cinnamon, spices, with light peppers. It's almost dessert like. The flavors feature a nice array of chocolates, roasted malts, cinnamon, nutmeg, other spice with light ancho peppers. It's very, very good and coats your palate.

Thick soy saucy looking. Pitch black. Oily. Very viscous. Brown grease left while swirled. Thick Brown head. Excellent retention and spotty lacing. 
Kind of even smells like a mild soy sauce for a second then amazing Bitter chocolate brownies with a hint of earthy pepper. Faint leather and oak. Fantastic big nose. 
Wow. Flavor has So much going on. Bitter chocolate brownie, dark earthy green chili. Big changes and variation from beginning to end. Earthy robust coffee along with espresso. Just delicious.

Appearance: Pours black, with two fingers of thick brown head that slowly fades. No lacing.

Taste: Cinnamon, peppers, cocoa, vanilla, oak. A sweet/chocolaty start, cinnamon/vanilla middle. Fades to peppers and oak.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, moderate carbonation. Smooth. Somewhat astringent as it warms. 
Overall: A very complex beer. Probably the best chilli beer I've had to date. The cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon play well with the heat of the peppers and the stout base keeps everything in balance.

Pouring into a Cigar City snifter is appropriate right?
A: Poured about as black and thick as you can imagine, with about a 1/2 or so sawdust-style head that was only a shade or two lighter than the jet black ink below it.
S: A mild southwest flair that I would best describe as chocolate milk with salsa. Yep... very lactose in nature.
T: So much more in-depth and sensory engaging than the nose! A tad spicy (ala enchilada sauce), and with a divine cedar bite that was very reminiscent of a lot of their Humidor Series stuff. I got the chilies, chocolate cocoa milk, and pepper.... all wrapped up in CC's distinct taste profile. Electric!
M: Thick as snot, measly carbonated, and with a bitter lingering that cut through the sweetness, leaving cedar and spice on the palate as opposed chocolate syrup. How the hell did they do that?
O: Huhzubendah said it best, "You can taste all of the ingredients individually, or you can enjoy them as a cohesive symphony." I couldn't agree more, and I bow in the brewer's general direction .... 1,135 charactersChaney, Oct 15, 2011

4.95/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5South Sound Tasting Notes
Pours black with brown head, very apropriate for an imperial style. Smell is chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate covered cinnamon. Taste is- you guessed it- chocolate, with cinnamon and dark cherry, some cedar character and some slight barley char. Very well balanced and the depth of the flavors keeps me sipping. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick! THICK IS GOOD FOR RIS (I'm talking to you, you bird-lipped Southampton RIS). Medium carbonation is near perfect for the body to make this truely decadent; as preferred, this RIS coats the mouth in rich flavors (ahem, JKBM, take note). Overall, wow, if I weren't such a homer this would get a perfect 5, but that honor is reserved for my favorite reserve series RIS. I love how the flavors are balanced, yet seemingly take turns coming to the forefront of your palate's attention. A true joy to drink!

From tasting notes, 750ml bottle. Pours black, black, black with dark tan head; light only shows through the very edges of the glass. Looks like Abyss when poured. Smells like cold coffee and chocolate. Taste is sweet brown sugar with tart grain astringency and chocolate bitterness to balance it out. Cold coffee, malt sugar, restrained hops, and bitter dark chocolate on the mid-back tongue; very slight smoke flavor makes itself known only when you aren't looking for it, kind of tastes like burnt coffee a bit but in a pleasant way. The sweet and sour balancing act is great, there is a lot going on in this beer. I think the sour I'm picking up is the cherry and oak notes that keep playing hid and seek. There is a lot going on here in the taste department, one of the best RIS I've had to date. Extremely well balanced yet still very flavorful, and very drinkable. This is a great desert beer and I wish I could get my hands on a bottle to save for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner, something of that nature. 1,903 charactersyouradhere, Oct 09, 2011

3.35/5  rDev -25.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3.5Ah, Hunaphu's. After hating the MZ I got, I was dreading this, but I can say easily that this one is much better. 
A- Motor oil black and a thin but heavy brownie-batter head. Sticks to the side of the glass. This stuff is thick.
S- Deep, impenatrable darkness. Intense dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate. A very nice nose.
T- Very sweet- reminds me a little of Dark Lord and of course of MZ. However, the chili spice comes out on the finish and does a pretty good job cutting through the stout. I like it. A little goes a long way, but I like the mild heat that builds. The cinnamon is nice on the tongue, makes it taste a bit like graham crackers.
M- Thick, syrupy, and too sweet. The chile is delightful though and brings this one along, saving it from being too much. Carbonation is too low for my tastes.
O- 2oz is all you need. Chile is nice- saves the beer from being the trainwreck that MZ is. I'd have this one again. Not worth trading an arm and a leg for, but the uniqueness makes this worth seeking out. YMMV. 1,030 charactersShogoKawada, Oct 07, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours our thick and dark, with light brown foam. Decent lacing, though it fades quickly into a dark ring. This stuff looks viscous - thick, dark, impenetrable.
Smell is great. Subtle and smooth, and surprisingly complex. Smells like a Mayan desert - chocolate, cocoa, cinnamon, and a bit of chili spice.
Taste follows the nose - subtle and oh so complex. Tons of cocoa, some cinnamon, a touch of heat from the chili. The chili is noticible, but doesn't really build over time. It adds a layer of complexity to the sweetness that dominates the flavor. This beer is smooth and delicous.
Feel is superb. Thick and chewey, creamy, super smooth. Everything a stout should be.
Overall - a fantastic, top notch stout. Might be my favorite. 736 charactersreadbaron, Oct 07, 2011

T- This beer is awesome! So much complexity, but everything is very balanced. You get everything and it all has its place and none of it is overbaring at all. Truly awesome flavor.
M- For something so big and bold it goes down so easy its scary.

Trying this one at long last!
Aroma: You know that feeling you get when you know you're about to drink a great one? That's what I got when I smelled this one. Sweet molasses, powdered hot cocoa mix, coffee, and vanilla in the background. Nothing but good stuff!
Appearance: Thin, tan head disappears quickly to a mirror-like black surface. Body is pitch black. Legs, rather than lacing wash down the sides of the snifer as I swirl the beer around.
Flavor: Wow. This one gets progressively better from start to finish. Aroma components also come through in the flavor. Milk chocolate, vanilla, and delicious coconut. A great amount of complexity to ponder with each sip. And there's the pepper, which comes through toward the end, and provides a subtle, but definitely noticeable, prickly heat. The pepper works very well in this one, and is the highlight in my opinion.
Mouthfeel: Full body and low carbonation. Alcohol and pepper provide enjoyable heat in mouth and throat.
Overall: Definitely one of the best I've had--easily in the top 5 (maybe 3). Due to the high alcohol, and limited availability, it's recommended that this one be shared w/ one or more fellow BA's. I will definitely be seeking this one out again! You've gotta try it! 1,323 charactersmdvatab, Sep 30, 2011

Opal colored pour with a massive chocolate mousse brown head; absolutely gorgeous. Aroma is way better than the Zhukov we just tasted; the chili pepper, cocoa nib and cinnamon are all prevalent, adding to the base of roasted malt, coffee, and burnt wood. Flavor is otherworldy; has every awesome aspect of your typical imperial stout, but the pepper and cinnamon just add a whole other dimension. The spicy notes do override some of the roast and chocolate a bit, but it’s welcome, and those characteristics are still discernible, not entirely masked. The palate is viscous, thick, and full flavored throughout. Absolutely top notch. 673 characterscosmo4u, Sep 28, 2011

A- pours a deep black, with a dark brown, 1-finger head.
S- dry cocoa, a lot of cherry
T- cherry, a montage of spices throughout, dry cocoa. Chili spice on the back end, but a touch subtle. More cherry. Vanilla is there but is tough to find.
M- cherry lingers...sweet, coats the mouth. Creamy.
O- an excellent beer. Had this without any food, but I suspect this would fare well with a pairing...perhaps some form of spicy chocolate, or a rare steak.

a: black as night and no light is getting through this beer. Good one finger head that lasts for awhile.
s: Sweet on the smell with dark fruits showing up first with cherry and figs. Slight vanilla deep in the smell.
t: The cacao comes though at the beginning of the taste along with the cherry in the smell. Very interesting spiciness from the chiles that is unique to an imperial stout.
m: Nice creaminess to this one. This is definitely a beer to sip and enjoy. 
I am really glad I got to try this beer. The spiciness makes this beer very unique and adds a lot of complexity. This is blended together well where all the components come to together well and one aspect is not overpowering. 749 charactersShumania, Sep 18, 2011

Appearance: Deep opaque black with a dark brown head about a finger thick that fades to a thin ring and clings to the side of the glass. I felt I needed to scrub my glass out after drinking it. 
Aroma: Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, subtle spices, coffee, roasted grains, blended very well.
Taste: Chocolate, coffee, roasted grains, molasses, vanilla, and chili spices. I think the highlight for me is the spicy finish and mouthfeel. Incredibly complex and balanced. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy with low carbonation and a nice tingling finish from the spices that linger and slowly build up sip after sip. 
Overall: This beer is so complex it's hard to imagine improving upon it with barrel aging. I had looked forward to this one for a while and I'm glad I finally got to try it. 854 charactersjamescain, Sep 15, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served on draft at Kickbacks into a 8oz Unibroue snifter/sampler glass. 6oz pour. 
Blacker than your ex's heart is this beer. No light anywhere near this beast is getting through. Dark mocha head, similar to a chocolate mousse, only darker. Lacing is spotty. A finger of head on the pour. Even when just moving the beer in the glass, the sticky nature of this beer takes over, leaving its mark throughout. Viscous just isn't enough to describe this beer. At rest, this is a nice rim of mocha head sitting at the cusp where the beer meets the glass. Lovely. 
Nose is dominated mostly by the chocolate base that is Zhukov. Having had this fresh, it has lost most of its profound nose. Notes of sweetness from the vanilla, and a mild chili presense. Much more of a "chocolate" beer nose than anythign else. Alcohol noted, though has to be sought after. It has lost much, so I am rated it higher knowing what it once was. Fresh is better in this regard. 
The taste experience is something found in no other beer I've had. The chocolate base of Zhukov is found through out, accententuated by the cocoa nibs. Off of this base comes the flavors in order. Vanilla, then cinnamon and then a fine note of the chilis. All are well done, none dominated and still an imperial stout. So much more than a chocolate beer at this point. So, damn, amazing. It may lose a bit since it was kegged in terms of fresh flavors, but it has gained a balanced quality. 
So bloody viscous. Sticky in the mouth. It requires plenty of time to enjoy. It is impossible to merely drink this one, as it something to be savored. Requires a good hour just to drink. 
SO intense, so powerful, so unapologetic, and so brasen in the approach, yet well done. Hard to bring another "flavored" stout that has this much intensity yet it is so enjoyable to drink. Very, very, very well done. 1,852 charactersCheesemoose, Sep 06, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle brought over for a tasting by Mike. Split between three of us and paired with chile chocolate and 70% cocoa chocolate. Poured into three globe glasses.
A: Extremely deep black body with a seriously rich, frothy and bubbly dark mocha colored head. It settled rather quickly into a thin film covering with some minor lacing but nice legs from the alcohol. Not bad but I think the higher ABV contributed to lack of lacing and brought on more legs.
S: Roasted caramel malts, bittersweet chocolate, chile flesh, vanilla beans and a slight smoked flavor. I'm not sure if wood was used in any way during the brewing but apart from the roasted malts there's a distinct smokey element. The chocolate seems to dominate the aroma for me with a touch of chile skin/flesh at the end. Seriously complex and wonderful.
T: Dark chocolate (slightly bitter) comes through first, followed by the roasted malt base. Vanilla shines through big towards mid-palate and the chiles, caramel and smoke come through towards the finish. The chiles don't seem to impart any heat even in the linger; instead give the beer an additional depth of flavor. So many things are going on in this beer and they all work incredibly well together.
M: Not as full-bodied and chewy as I would have liked but there's nothing thin about this. It has a decent level of carbonation giving this a fuller medium body with nothing dry in the finish. It's smooth and flavorful without any alcohol detection - dangerously drinkable.
I have to say, this might be one of the most unique and delicious Imperial Stouts to date. The complexity of adding so many different ingredients to this beer and having them work so well together shows the outstanding craftsmanship from the brewers at Cigar City. Pushing the envelope while retaining such quality is seriously impressive. A wonderful beer that everyone should try to taste once in their life. 1,911 charactersShanePB, Aug 29, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The last three times I have had this beer, I have been blown away. If I could have but one stout in my cellar, this is the one.
The beer appears black as night. The void. Quite possibly the darkest beer I have ever seen. The head is beige and thick, coating the glass in lacing.
The aroma brings a potent dose of roasted malt, alcohol, chiles, cocoa, vanilla. Wow, this beer smells fantastic.
Unbelievably well-balanced and teeming with flavor. Simply amazing. The chiles have a big presence in the beer, but don't put out an overabundance of heat or spice. Masterfully done there. Cinnamon, vanilla, and oak meld beautifully with a full-bodied, roasty stout. 
Perfect carbonation level. Every sip leaves a thick coating of rich stout on the palate. The feel is just perfect. 
Overall, one of the best beers, and certainly among the finest imperial stouts I have ever had. My highest recommendation. 904 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 27, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Shared this with CTSparky and another buddy during a tasting get together.
A - Poured into a snifter, this guy is thick, syrupy and has the consistency of used motor oil. You'd swear it would clog an artery. Black, reflective, and settles with a hint of a foam on top.
S - Smells intense with cocoa. Rivals FBS in that regard. Has an aroma of fresh baked chocolate cookiescake. Other scents of cinnamon and vanilla are present.
T - Clearly unique. The flavors of dark, rich, chocolate give to a mellow cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla taste. And that's when the heat kicks in. This bottle was a 2011 bought in March and 5+ months later the chilies are still there and in full effect. The phenols make an acidic burn that feels like spicy tex-mex food. Wow! Not sure how much I enjoy it as I finish the glass but it is incredible.
M - Extremely heavy, thick, and the chile flavor is constant. Can't have more than a snifter's worth because of how dominant. In fact, I would have this as the last beer of the night. Your taste buds are overloaded.
O - Great experience and for those Imp Stout lovers it is a must try. But not really a beer you have often. Perfect to share, and kudos to CCB for making this. 1,206 characterssocon67, Aug 20, 2011

Thanks a million to Ljkeats for this smooth trade that landed my hands down biggest want. 
A- pours pitch black from the bottle into my snifter and sits "black as a oil spill" as Eddie Murphy once said. Nice 2 finger chocolate mocha colored head with grwat retention that turns foamy. thick heavy lacing is left around the glass as the head recedes. many bubbles are left on the glass but not jetting up. Looks like black gold. 
S- Chocolate and alcohol booze scents are prominent followed by some earthy spice and vanilla. very nice
T- Heavy cocoa and chocolate are the first thing i notice followed by some light spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. The vanilla is there but hiding behind those flavors. Roasty coffee beans and some heat from hot peppers are there but hidden behind the cocoa and spice. Spicy heat begins to become more prominent as I drink more. Unbeleivable complexity and flavor. This lives up to the hype and surpassed my expectations without a doubt. 
M- Heavier mouthfeel wth low carbonation. This is smooth and rich, almost velvety.
O- This beer is unbeleivable. The complex and odd flavors are beauitiful. Every sip is different and awesome, unlike any beer I've ever had. I need more of this. 1,231 charactersGushue3, Aug 20, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750ml into an imperial pint glass.
Hunahpu's is obsidian bee-lack. An aggressive pour will put 1-2 finger head on this beer. Head is fine and dark camel colored. Lacing is very fine when present.
Aroma is a burnt offering of sorts with casdades of black coffee, sweet dark malts, dark chocolate, and licorice.
Flavor is is a knockout - espresso, dark chocolate, burnt malt, toasted almonds, some grassy hops, finishing with some caramel and vanilla followed by some spicey chile shades at the sides of the tongue. The chile flavor does not make camp here, just a brief appearance. Can't say that the cinnamon was detectable amidst all the other flavors. A crazy whirlwind of flavors. Alcohol is very well masked.
Hunahpu's is very silky, chewy, and super dry due to the 11.5% abv.
Overall this one gets a firm attaboy along side some of the best imperial stouts. A real winner this one. 905 charactersDelMontiac, Aug 14, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750ml bottle into a CCB snifter. 2011 release.
This brew pours an absolutely oppressive black color capped with a tiny, brown head. Looks good, but having had the 2011 Zhukov over the past few nights, the appearance here doesn't quite stack up. The aroma has full espresso and malt roastiness, dark chocolate, vanilla, along with a nice chili pepper kick. Very great smelling. The taste is very nice, it starts out with an absolutely rock-solid RIS base that's as good as any you'd ever want. Tons of roastiness, along with plenty of vanilla and dark chocolate. The things that really put Hunahpu's a step above the others is the chili and cinnamon aspects. The chilis here add a whole new dimension to the RIS, providing a bit of a kick on the way down the throat. As it warms, the chilis become all the more prevalent. All around superb.
The mouthfeel is amazing. It goes down silky-smooth, and the little hint of chili pepper burn on the back of the throat just really keeps things interesting. It's a bit undercarbed though, a little more liveliness would do it well. The drinkability is superb, this drinks way easier than the ABV would dictate. Overall, this is easily one of the best beers I've ever had, and the best imperial stout, right ahead of it's little brother Zhukov. Now, I can't say I've had many "whales", but if they're all this delicious I can see why people go nuts over them! 1,414 charactersshand, Aug 14, 2011

Jet black in colour with moderate carbonation and an odd coloured (beige with a hint of red) head. Aromas are of roasted malt, spicy pepper, raw chocolate, vanilla, and Mexican coffee. Sort of like a fancy spicy peppery hot chocolate in the mouth, along with more vanilla, red bean, and medium roast coffee. Heavy bodied, with the peppery heat providing some interesting balance on the palate. Amazing stuff. 453 charactersfisherman34, Aug 12, 2011

Thanks to readbaron for the bottle 2011 version
Thanks to Nicks6217 for sharing the 2010 version in Los Angeles
A-- Poured dark, thick, oily and ominious black. Gorgeous reverse cascading dark leather head that was one finger in height. Looked like a dark mocha. No lacing but left dark residue all through the glass. Beautiful!!
S-- Mexican chocolate, bakers chocolate marshmallow, cinnamon, and vanilla. No hints of the ABV in the nose. 
T-- Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and marshmallow. Sweet but dry. 
M-- Lack of Chile's was disappointing. Got faint Chilie's in the 2010 version but none in the 2011 version. This was dry and left me thinking this was a Mexican smore. 
O-- Impressive. Easy to drink and savor. Excellent hidden ABV. Prefered the 2010 version as the Chile gave a very nice twist to it. The 2011 tasted more like Zhukov with more character. One of the best beers I have had this year. 944 charactersmulder1010, Aug 08, 2011

A: lovely pour with loads of head
S: definitely get the Mexican hot chocolate spicing coming through. Cinnamon is detectable in the nose. Chocolatey in general. Perhaps there's some organic fruity chilli smells.
T: There's more of a Mexican hot chocolate character. Quite dry and extremely smooth with very little alcohol detectable. Chillies aren't very prominent in taste or mouthfeel.
M: Thick and viscous
O: This was the pick of the night against such offerings as Black Tuesday, Black Albert and Abstrakt 04. This was supremely drinkable and delicious and imo even a non-beer geek could handle this with ease. Excellent. 746 charactersdanieelol, Aug 07, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Split a 2011 bottle with lethalchickens and my wife (she loves RISs and DIPAs - good egg).
A: All imperial stouts need to look like this! Completely opaque black with dark brown head. I don't think I've come across a beer with a better appearance. I certainly know that appearance isn't everything, but this sure looks tasty. Leaves a brown tint to the snifter when you swirl or take a sip.
S: The normal roasty smells you'd expect from an imperial stout are present. Don't really notice the chiles in the nose.
T: The taste is awesome. With the addition of chiles, cinnamon, vanilla and cacao nibs, I didn't expect this to taste like any other imperial stout. And it doesn't. We poured this beer at normal fridge temperature (~38°) and savored it as it warmed. While still fairly cool, the cinnamon dominated. As it warmed, the chiles became more noticeable. I couldn't really notice any of the vanilla. Overall, it tasted pretty much like what you'd expect from a top notch RIS, with strong cinnamon and chile flavors in addition.
M: Super thick body. Really good carbonation - not too much, not too little. Nothing to complain about here.
D: My wife ended up giving me her third of the bottle (her loss). So, I ended up drinking 2/3 of the 750mL. I easily could have drank the whole thing myself. Possibly even a second. It's definitely not a beer to drink all day in the sun, but it's not hard to down a bottle solo.
Overall, this is a beer you should definitely seek out if you are a fan of imperial stouts. If only Cigar City made this a year round offering. 1,571 charactersmaniacal82, Aug 07, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed live! Big thanks goes out to my boy Jefe73 for sending me this one in a past trade! 2011 vintage! Served from bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Pours pitch black with a one finger brown head that rises from the ashes and subsides to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, chiles, vanilla, and subtle cinnamon. The flavor is of sweet malt, roasted malt, deep dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, sweet alcohol, wood, and chile heat on the followthrough. It has a heavy feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this is an excellent brew! The flavors and aromas on this one are really complex and excellent. For the ABV this one is really smooth and quite drinkable. I am a big lover of spicy food and the followthrough on this one really appeals to me. Really glad I am getting to try this one as I never have before. A definite must try for sure... Thanks again Jeff! 983 charactersthagr81us, Aug 04, 2011

A: Poured from bottle into 2 Speiglau beer Tulips. Pours a nice dark , dark brown almost black with a really small head in a dark rust color.The head did fade but left lacing everywhere.
S: Wow, there is a lot going on here. Malt, chocolate, espresso , vanilla and cinnamon. I was in for a treat.
T: This is what I am talking about. A balanced flavor that had you disect it as you went . Hits with a nice espresso taste and then all of the other flavors came to the party, a nice vanilla note , cinnamon (It sounds odd but really captivated you and made you process it more) . A bare hint of the chili peppers but was hidden nicely in the back ground. made you smile. This is an exceptional IRS!!! Swirling this in the glass woke the head up again and brought more of the flavors out
M: Low carbonation , does not feel heavy solid medium body
O: This ranks for me in the top of what I have been exposed to. Just a blossom of flavors that form a truly exceptional Imperial Russian Stout. hats off to the brewers on this one an exceptional balance of flavors that would make even the biggest beer snob smile and be left wanting more.

4.17/5  rDev -7.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On draft at CCB during the 2011 release. 
Pitch black, literally just like motor oil. The head is a dark tan and it fades to a ring around the glass/ swirl in the middle. The nose is mainly of dark chocolate and espressso type coffee. Taste is big on roasted/burnt malts, coffee, and dark chocolate as expected. Mild chilli peppers and a vanilla flavor on the finish. Thick and full bodied. Carbonation fades toward the end. This is a huge beer to say least. Lots going on but it comes together nicely in my opinion. Worth searching. 534 characterspolisanl, Jul 31, 2011

S - Chocolate mostly, slight cinnamon.
T - Initially a lot of chocolate, as I drank more I got a ton of the chillies and a good amount of cinnamon. Couldn't really pick up on the vanilla, it was overpowered by everything else. 
M - Very thick, coats your mouth.
O - Amazing, wish I had another to age for a bit. I will definitely seek this one out again. 443 characterss1ckboy, Jul 30, 2011

Bottle to Flute
750 ML
App- A nearly black stout with a thin capped head. A little bit of cling, little bit of webbing.
Smell- This smelled absoutely amazing in the glass. A lot of aromatics, malty, spicy, sweet, oaky, vanilla. Just WOW!
Taste- Really drops off on the taste. Im sensitive to vanilla so I pick that out, but seems a bit muddled with the spice competing with the chocolate and the vanilla. Still tasty but not as good as I thought it would be.
Mouth- Very slick and medium bodied. Same goes for the carbonation on this one.
Drink- A nice beer with a lot going on for me. Too much in fact. A good stout, but probably wont trade for this one. 679 charactersFosterJM, Jul 26, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Just tasted a 2010 bottle from a trade, poured into a tulip glass. Pours deep black with a wicked reddish brown head that fades quickly, but leave lacing everywhere it touched. I didn't pick up on the chile's, but the smell was otherwise dominated by dark chocolate, hints of vanilla, cinamonn, and a touch of oak. Lots going on in the smell, but the taste was more one dimensional, not bad, mind you, but not quite as complex as the aroma. It's definately up there as one of the best RIS's I've had. The alcohol is hidden well, and drinks very easily considering how thick and heavy the beer is. 596 characterstripelhops, Jul 25, 2011
3.68/5  rDev -18.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Pour is viscous like motor oil - thick and black with oily brown head and a body that coats the glass and hangs out anywhere it goes. The nose is dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of vanilla and spice. I don't get the peppers. Good, but nothing special. Controversy in the taste. Split this with a few non-BA beer lovers - people who love a good brown ale but are rarely exposed to crazy 750mL imperial stouts. They thought it was really good, whereas I did not. Either way, the chilis hit you in the throat in a very minor fashion. They must have faded considerably looking at other reviews because I get them only as a mime for heartburn, and barely or not at all on the back of the tongue. This makes them not a particularly pleasant addition. The spices and the vanilla are mostly masked as well. The taste is dramatically like a really, really dark chocolate - but one that is not too bitter as to be overly dry. In fact, in contrast to almost everyone, I found this to be pretty one-note. It drinks kind of easy for what it is, with a big body and low carbonation. It really didn't come together for me and I kind of wish I had had it fresh. 1,155 charactersseeswo, Jul 18, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to jrallen34 for trading me this huge want.
Pours a deep, thick, very dark brown, with about two fingers of milk-chocolate-colored head. The head hangs around for a bit, and leaves a small amount of lacing. A very pretty beer.
If I didn't know better, I'd guess this is barrel-aged from the smell. A lot of vanilla, over the typical stout smell. I don't smell any of the chiles, possible I'm just missing them.
The taste isn't quite as good as the smell. Very sweet, sticky lips, but not overpowering. There's some mild, entirely pleasant heat from the chiles. I get the chocolate, but it seems subdued. If there's vanilla in the taste I can't get it, which is my main complaint.
It's very full in my mouth, but a bit stickier than I like. Not unpleasantly so, though.
Overall this is a very good beer, I'm so glad I got to try it. 847 charactersstupac2, Jul 17, 2011

The description on the bottle says it all. The aroma was spicy chilies. The taste was like nothing I have had before. A great stout with undercurrents of roasted malt, chocolate, and cocoa that are dominated by vanilla and peppers. Wowzers... 404 charactersdboon, Jul 13, 2011

A- Jet black with a decent dark tan head. Head recedes slowly but surely into a ring. Stains the fucking glass its so viscus.
S- Oh wow! Smells fucking incredible! You can smell everything in its place, the chiles, the coco, the vanilla, and of course the cinnamon gives a great complexity.
T- This beer is incredible! So much complexity, but everything is very balanced. You get everything and it all has its place and none of it is ove-rbaring at all. Truly awesome flavor.
M- For something so big and bold it goes down so easy its scary.

A: Pours pitch black straight out of the bottle like motor oil...very thick looking. The head is one of the darkest I've seen on a beer and it fades to a ring leaving small bits of lacing.
S: The nose is full of big aromas including dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, peppers, fudge, and dark fruits. The peppers are actually more pronounced than I expected.
T: The taste is a big hit of roasted/burnt malts, coffee, and dark chocolate at first and as it progesses I can pick up the chilli peppers and a vanilla flavor on the finish. It's mainly all roast but the other flavors balance that out during the finish. It starts kind of bitter but ends sweet.
M: The beer is thick and creamy...definitely full bodied. Carbonation is actually nice for such a big beer.
O: This is one of those over the top beers that tastes good but is a bit much for one sitting. I like it but I don't think I'll search this one out again. 975 charactersGregSVT, Jul 10, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Live review of a 2011 750mL bottle.
A: Opaque black with probably the darkest slow developing head I've ever seen with some lacing.
S: Boozy dark chocolate, spicy with a somewhat floral yeast character, banana and caramel, some vanilla oak character, and blackberries. Pretty good, but relatively unassuming.
T: Dark chocolate creaminess with a spicy (cinnamon) and a very mild pepper flavor (it tastes how peppers smell), while the linger is the peppers, spice, and vanilla. It almost comes off like a dark chocolate-covered chiles. The alcohol bite is noticeable and clean about halfway through. The spice builds as you sip.
M: Creamy, but thinner, with a crisp almost harsh finish (with the alcohol and heat).
O: This is probably the best use of chiles in a beer I could imagine. It's very original and almost difficult to compare to other stouts. I like it. 861 charactersne0m00re, Jul 10, 2011

A: Thick viscous mixture that is pitch black an a bright tan head that quickly is just lacing. 
S: Heavy roast malt, bitterness from cocoa nibs, a slight hint of chile and some smoke. 
T: Also a very heavy roast flavor just to Marshal Zhukov style unsurprisingly. A mixture of flavors, none of them overshadowing the roasted burnt ashy malt flavors. Some of the other flavors coming in are a sweet malt backbone, definite chile presence with a tiny bit of heat even coming through. The cocoa nibs are really hard to pick out among cinnamon and chile spices but they are there adding a little bit of bitterness. Some smokey notes are there as well, literally giving this a chipotle feel to the stout. 
M: Thick, just as seen in the pour and a light carbonation. 
O: I can definitely enjoy it, it has some sweetness mixing in with the smoke, chile peppers, cinnamon and cocoa nibs. This is literally a kitchen sink of beers with many things added. It is good and a beer worth seeking out, but not an all time favorite stout of mine. 1,074 charactersalpinebryant, Jul 10, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25VINTAGE 2011.
Poured into a cigar city snifter glass.
Appearance: Dark black bodied beer with a dark brown head less than a one fingers head. Motor Oil yet again!
Smell: Smells of roasty coffee and dark chocolate. Mild smoke noted also.
Taste: Vanilla hits the palate with a mild sweetness, but makes its present know. The malts are of roasty coffee and become integrated with the peppers which impart a taste of smoke, spiciness and an almost meaty flavor to this beer. I really don't get much cinnamon out of this beer, it seems to be a minor player and is out done by the peppers. Bakers chocolate is found mid-taste and brings everything together. It offers a dry finish to the beer and really makes the vanilla sweetness pop. It excentuates the roasty coffee notes imparted from the malts and adds the mild zip from the peppers. What a nice complexity the beer has going here! 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with low carbonation. Motor Oil consistency. 
Overall: One of the more complex Imperial Stouts that I have tried to date. Especially when you throw in the factor of this beer not being aged in a barrel. Nice balance of the many ingredients used in brewing this beer. The verdict is that I do enjoy Hunahpu more than Marshall Z after tring both of these beers tonight. 1,284 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 09, 2011

2010 Vintage.
A - Pours an oily and viscous velvet black liquid with a thin but dense dark dark brown head that is about 0.25 inches. Wow. Beautiful.
S - Cocoa powder, milk chocolate sweetness, molten chocolate lava cake. Some bitter dark chocolate as well. Wow. This nose is great. Sweet sweet molasses and caramel. Woody vanilla and cinnamon are present on the nose in the back end. Nice spice to it as well. Bready sweet malt with some oat character and some fresh grain. Wow!
T & M - Oily and velvety start. Bitter dark chocolate and some peppery spice notes. Burnt wood and grain notes mixed in with some cinnamon notes. Milk chocolate sweetness comes up in the middle along with some vanilla as well as some more woody notes. There is caramel and some nice cinnamon through the middle as well. The sweetness comes up after the spice and roasted notes to balance these. The finish has that woody and spicy notes and a slight sticky bitterness lingers after. Very pure chocolaty. Delicious. Mouthfeel is pretty full. It has a nice oily character. Good CO2 and a great spicy finish as it warms.
O - Beer is delicious. Very nice offering from CCB. Chocolaty and very spicy. Reminds me a bit of the Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti from Great Divide. 1,293 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jul 06, 2011

Hunahpu 2011 – coats the glass when you swirl it…dark as a black hole, looks great. Swirling builds a thin tan head. chocolate and spiciness…taste – spicy, but really good…coffee, roasted malts, solid flavor. Body is medium, but an easy drinker that slips down like water. overall solid RIS, easy drinker, great flavor (dark raosted malt coffees), really enjoyable.
--- EDIT --- 2011-11-24
had this again last night at a nutty tasting and i'd have to bump the taste and overall to the full monty of a 5. this is really a world class beer and the spiciness held up really well...it was drinking fantastic. gorgeous to look at, smell it all day, and the taste is just amazing. one of the more unique and outstanding beers out there in my opinion.
--- EDIT --- 2012-05-25
2012 vintage (had this not too long ago, but popped a bottle tonight to enjoy with my hunah snifter). gorgeous look of deep dark sludge with a really nice deep brown cap. smells of spicey cocoa nibs and cinnamon. taste is that wonderful medley of spicey peppers cinnamon vanilla and of course deep chocolatey cocoa nibs. there is no mistaking that this is a big beer and a monster to take on alone, but i was feeling brave and needed something kick ass and special tonight and this fit the bill for rewarding myself. cheers! the taste is unique and likely a 5, the rest of my review stands. 1,434 characterscosmicevan, Jul 05, 2011

a: motor oil black and as thick as it when you pour it out. Beautiful creamy head with tons of dark brown bubble springing up. Nice thick brown lacing and it looks very very thick.
s: sweet and cocoa. No heat from the alcohol in the nose, but there is a rich buttery chocolate aroma pouring off the glass. Something spicy as well.
t: chocolate, rich chocolate. I am getting tons of it, more sweetness in the middle and a little spice from what I'd assume to be the chili. Not strong, but compliments the cocoa very very well. finishes bitter with a hint of vanilla and cinnamon and leaves you dry waiting for the next sip.
m: creamy and buttery. extraordinarily thick. too thick for the warm summer night that I drank it on, but in the winter what a wonderful brew this will be to try again. spreads through the mouth and stays long. very sticky sweet.
o: just wow. this beer has tons of flavor. it is truly unreal to me how they packed in this much flavor without even a touch of booze. I didn't get heat one time. the chili spice is great with the cocoa. they did a better job using it than DFH did with Theobroma. Just a wonderful beer and I cant wait til the next time. 1,301 charactersPreismj, Jul 05, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52011 vintage. I took the bottle out of the fridge, and allowed it to warm for about 30 minutes before I poured my first sample into my tulip glass.
A: I cannot recall another beer pouring any darker than this beast. It looked exactly like used motor oil coming out of the bottle, absolutely no chance of any light making it's way through whatsoever. A normal pour yielded about a 1/2 inch very dark brown head, again one of the darkest I have ever seen. Looks very appetizing.
S: Wow, where do I even begin? Chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa, cinnamon, and a hint of chiles, somewhat subdued.
T: The first sip absolutely blew me away. I honestly didn't move for about a minute, savoring and trying to comprehend all of the flavors I was experiencing. By this time, it had warmed up to the perfect temperature, and all of the flavors seemed to complement one another perfectly. Strong cocoa/chocolate flavor, with cinnamon also pronounced. The vanilla and chiles were also noticeable, but not overpowering, playing a perfect supporting role. It is so completely rich, that drinking a couple ounces took quite a while, but I enjoyed every second of it.
M: The mouthfeel on this sucker was amazing, one of the best I've ever had. Very thick, but at the same time silky smooth, almost velvety. 
O: This beer is probably the best non-barrel aged imperial stout I've ever had. It's so complex that it seems no amount of description will do it justice. It's balanced perfectly, all of the different flavors seem to blend together better than I ever could have imagined. 
This was my first Cigar City brew. I huge bravo to everyone involved in the creation of this beauty! 1,668 charactersDucksFan16, Jul 01, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to jwjon1 for this bottle. This is one I've been wanting to try for a while.
A: Poured jet black and looked like motor oil coming out of the bottle (my girlfriend was terrified), and yet it somehow still had great carbonation and a thick dark brown head.
S: Wow, this beer smells really incredible! Dark chocolate and roasted malt and some other spices that I can't quite put my finger on. I just want to smell this forever. 
T: Damn, it tastes good, but I wanted it to be so much better. It's chocolatey and sweet, but I had hoped that the chilies and cinnamon would come through more in the taste. It didn't taste THAT much different than its baby brother base beer, Marshall Zhukov's. Once it warmed up a little, the chilies came through more, but I thought it could've used more of that flavor.
M: Very smooth, but the stickiness of it got to me after a while.
O: Hunahpu's is a damn good beer, but I wanted it to be amazing, and it wasn't quite what I had hoped for. Maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of spicy food, but I wanted more of that flavor in the beer than just the hints it offered, because what was there was great. Still, this is a very nice, unique beer.
Edit: Opened a second bottle and it was much more what I had hoped Hunahpu's to be. The cinnamon and chilis really shined this time around and made it a fantastic beer. I'm not sure what was wrong with the first bottle I had, but the second one was considerably better - I'm upping taste and overall ratings from 4 to 4.5. 1,516 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 01, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: This poured 100% pitch black with thick dark brown head. Maybe the darkest beer I've seen.
S: It smelled like rich dry cocoa and cinnamon and chipotle, with fresh roasted coffee and vanilla and chili powder, and a bit of toffee.
T: It tasted like rich chocolate and chili powder and chipotle, with fresh roasted coffee and cinnamon and vanilla, with a bit of molasses. It had a spicy and very dry aftertaste that was bittersweet.
M: It was crazy thick with a little carbonation. Maybe the fullest body I've had.
D: This was perhaps my favorite stout on record. I could imagine bourbon aging to make it even better, so it's maybe not perfect, but man it's close. The scent and taste are so delicious and unbelievably complex. The body is basically perfect. The bit of alcohol heat is masked by the chilies, so it's surprisingly easy to drink. This would be better fresh, I suppose, but I'm sure it would still be great after some years in the cellar. I love this beer and need more ASAP. 989 charactersPencible, Jun 30, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to BastionShaw for this beast of a bottle!
Pours a coffee brown, with the darkest head that anyone in the tasting circle had ever seen. About 1/2 a finger worth of head on my pour. Smell! I wish I could smell this beer forever. Each whiff brings a different smell be it Ovaltine, Blackened peppers, tobacco, dark dark chocolate. The smell alone is phenomenal. Onto the taste, with the first sip you get a burst of deep roasted chocolate and as you let that that linger you get a grilled pepper flavor that dances in your mouth. Every sip is different from the next. The mouthfeel is nice but not in your face. The chilies play a good role in letting the tingling sensation coat your mouth without burning your tongue. Also this beer leaves your mouth feeling dry like a tannic wine, but it works! Overall I am ecstatic I got to try this beer and would love to snag another bottle! 888 charactersdeathcharms, Jun 30, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Dan for hooking this up. Poured into a tulip. This has a nice creamy looking tan head atop a pitch black body. There is a bit of sticky lacing.
The aroma is full of delicious chocolate (really nice bittersweet dark chocolate). There is a bit of sweetness from the malt. I get a bit of a vegetal aroma that could be the chilies or the hops; it isn't very powerful.
The taste is, like the aroma, mostly chocolatey. There is some nice support with the vanilla flavor. There is just enough sweetness to bring out the best flavors. The finish has just the slightest bit of heat from the chillies.
The mouthfeel here is really enjoyable. The body is relatively heavy, even for a stout (probably because of the adjuncts) and the carbonation leaves a nice fluffy sensation. This is a great mouthfeel.
This beer is not only unique, it's very enjoyable. I had it last year, was confused at the first sip, but at the end of my glass I loved it. I will look to have it again for sure. 986 charactersandrewinski1, Jun 30, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Espresso brown color with a minor to moderate amount of coffee colored head. Completely opaque. Looks very thick and viscous. 
S: Cinnamon, chocolate, chili powder, and magic. I once had a "perfect" cup of hot chocolate from a gourmet eatery that tasted nearly identical to this scent. 
T: Bittersweet chocolate, cocoa powder, cinnamon, chili powder, chili peppers (flavor, but not too much heat). Very good overall flavor - pretty close to the ideal non-BA stout. Black coffee seems to come out the more it warms. 
M: Excellently thick. Viscous and dense, but without being oily or silky. Very good, but not perfection. Moderate overall level of carbonation with fine bubbles. 
O: One of the single best imperial stouts ever made. Complexity, depth, and balance of flavors that are superb. 797 charactersjnn4v, Jun 26, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from TKEbeerman to celebrate my first fathers day pours one of the best pours I have ever seen. Seems to almost come out of the bottle lumpy. Thick, pitch black. A solid 1/2 inch of chocolate covered head develops and fights to stick around, fades to some beautiful wispy bubbles on the surface and eventually to a permanent ring. Slightly oily on the glass, not much lacing if at all.
Let this one warm up. Initially there was this boozy thing going on that dominated the nose, but once it warmed up just a bit there are all sorts of developments. A mixture of cocoa and vanilla that best remind me of rich chocolate cake. Very sweet and then something catches me in the back of my nose, the chilis or cinnamon, maybe, but it isn't defined enough for me to grab onto.
Taste was not as amazing over the top as I'd hoped for. Might have sat on it too long? as things seemed a little muddled or faded. But there is still alot there, so not really sure. Begins with a swirling mixture of sweetness. Vanilla, Carmel and Cocoa. Then it gets a pretty dominating roasted malt flavor, but is followed by a dryness and some spice from the chilies I think, but more of a dry chili powder than juicy pepper.
Feels great drinking, super smooth, perfect low medium carbonation that coats the mouth and has very little heat from the 11.5%. Keep going back for more.
Overall I think I was expecting more but I was far from disappointed. Great looking and great feeling, but just good on the important points to me. I am very happy I got to try it as it is unlike anything I have had before, but might be a one and done type of thing for me 1,635 charactersbenpopper, Jun 22, 2011

750mL bottled poured into large snifter - big thanks to BastionShaw for this one
Pours a thick, dark blackness with some graham cracker brown head which bubbles up around the glass. Decent retention with clusters of film and patchy lacing on the glass. 
Explosive, complex nose with rich dark chocolate and slight bitterness. Notes of vanilla with syrupy caramel and cinnamon spice. Hints of alcohol and chile heat, but not overbearing. Wow, I can't wait to drink this. 
Thick, syrupy chocolate with truffle oil and faint bitterness. Roasted malts with caramel and chocolate cake, layered with vanilla and cinnamon tones. Complex throughout, with each sip I can taste the cocoa and vanilla, while the chiles stay under control. Slight heat after swallowing, which keeps you thinking about the beer, and well masked alcohol in the finish. 
Full bodied, decent carbonation, silky smooth and creamy on the tongue. Once again, wow - this might be the best non-barrel aged stout I've ever had. Truly remarkable and worth the effort it takes to track one down. 1,072 charactersxnicknj, Jun 19, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received today in a trade with mikesgroove. Thanks Mike you are a very generous man!
Poured into my DFH Signature glass.
Appearance: Pours a pitch black with no light able to penetrate at any point. Thick dark brown one half finger head that recedes to a lacing relatively quickly. Beautiful looking beer.
Smell: Very complex, even when still cold. I smell a lot of bitter chocolate up front followed with a dose of vanilla. Good amount of sweetness from the vanilla. The smell alone is intoxicating.
Taste: Everything comes through here! This is simply amazing. Chocolate and vanilla just punch your tongue. Its amazing how much these flavors come out in this beer! At the end of the sip I taste the little twang from the chili peppers. Cinnamon flavor does not particularaly stand out to me. The beer is not overly sweet but the base seems like a great stout as well.
Mouthfeel: The best part of the beer! So thick and motor oil like. Great heavy body but still some nice carbonation on the tongue.
Overall: This beer is FULLY deserving of the hype it gets! Amazing. I am considering traveling to the release party one of these days. This is the best stout I have ever had hands down. So complex, there is so much going on but it melds together perfectly! 1,263 charactersOddNotion, Jun 16, 2011
4/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.522 oz bottle of the 2010 vintage shared with steepH20 while watching the Mavs smack down the Heat. Oh, sweet, sweet justice.
Evil black sludge with a rich cinnamon head that rises and fades likes the summer sun. A nice looking beer. A slick coating lays waste to the snifter sip after sip.
For a year old bottle, this shines brightly with the adjuncts on display: cinammon, chiles, and dark chocolate. Unlike any stout I've had. 
Rich baker's chocolate and bitters segues into cinammon and spice from the chiles. Full, thick, and hot. Alcohol peppery heat from the chiles and high abv make for a big drinking stout. As individual flavors, this shows its uniqueness. As a some of its parts, it doesn't really shine in its cohesiveness.
Low carbonation and heavy, thick mouthfeel makes this a long, slow sipper. 
I appreciate the uniqueness of this beer and am thankful for the opportunity. While a nice experience, I'm not sure that this should demand the pull this beer seems to require. 992 charactersBarrytheBear, Jun 13, 2011

Poured from 750ml botlle into pint goblet -

A: Poured as dark as Alister Crowleys soul,One finger head that decended into a thick thin coffee colored lacing,good carbonation.
S: Slight chocholate,vanilla,coffee,deep roasted malt.
T: The flavors tommohawked my tounge with strong bitter coffee,deep rich chocolates,slight vanilla hints,slight spice from the chile's,cinnamon hints as well.
O: Overall I'm blown away by this stout, the flavors are complex yet they meld together perfectly, the chile's leave a slight burn on the back of the throat, however they don't dominate any aspect of the stout,very well made ,great balance. 696 charactersInebriatedJoker, Jun 12, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle from 2011
A: This beer has one of the better heads you will get out of an imperial stout; I was worried after hearing so much about the base beer being flatter than hand soap. Poured ever so black into a goblet style glass with an impressive 1/2" mocha head.
S: The smell is where you first know this isn't some run-of-the-mill double stout. There is the typical bitter coffee and dark chocolates but right away you know this is spiced up. I'm sure the chilies stood out more when fresh but they were present in the background, standing behind the vanilla sweetness and brown sugar/cinnamon spice.
T: This really stands alone. I sort of feel that cigar city teamed up with Hershey;s and a seasoning company to make this guy. There is a dominating coffee character which I didn't expect in this beer. Ok, maybe not dominant, just the first big flavor in the party. Next you get the richness and creaminess that the vanilla and cacao nibs bring to the beer. The finish is where you notice Hunahpu's spiciness, which is apparent on the back of your tongue after each taste; Its nothing distracting but enough to give the beer character and set it apart. Alcohol is hidden very well in this big stout.
M: Thick, creamy, and coating. The carbonation was huge for the style. 
O: I'm very pleased that I decided to seek out a few bottles of this. Huna is a great way for a brewery to make something different and memorable without throwing it in a bourbon barrel. 1,474 charactersschwaeh, Jun 11, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 mL bottle poured into a Cigar City Snifter. Classy.
Appearance - As black as they come. Not even a hint of brown in the stream of the pour as it comes out of the bottle. It foams up nicely as I pour it with a dark brown head. The only thing that's missing is lacing, which is minimal.
Smell - Unbelievable aroma. Deep dark chocolate. The friend I split it with said it smells like "really expensive chocolate." Roasty aromas abound with the chocolate and a slight burning in the nose from the alcohol and peppers. Delightful.
Taste - An immediate hop bitterness that fades immediately to a strong flavor of dark chocolate. The pepper flavor burns the taste buds just slightly throughout the entire drink, never allowing the sweetness to overwhelm. In the middle are the dark roasted malt flavors, followed by a finish that wants to be sweet, but can't overcome a hop bitterness and peppery bite.
Mouthfeel - Ok, I like my stouts heavy and chewy, but this is ridiculous. I've split a bottle of Hunahpu two ways once before and it was too much. This time I split it three ways and it seems that I'll make it through the glass. It's the heaviest beer I've ever had. Pretty high in carbonation considering the ABV and weight of the beer. Gives it a good tingle that complements the peppers nicely.
Overall - Outstanding stout. The flavors are perfectly balanced, complex, and like no other stout I've had. The pepper addition is the pièce de résistance that elevates this beyond just a good stout. I will be back next year for the 2012 Hunahpu. 1,551 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 11, 2011

4.8/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thank you to CaptinRedBeard for this one. Shared with some friends and tasted along side the base brew (Marshal Zhukov.)
Poured into a snifter, this brew appears deep black in color with more than a finger of very dark brown mocha froth head. The cap holds very well at a finger's strength and as it slowly recedes leaves patches of lace on the glass. When held to the light, there is no light passing through, this is one dark beer. Small fingers of lace dangle down the side of the glass along with faint spotty lace. Once the cap finally dissolves, a quick swirl revives it.
The smell of this brew is tangy with a combination of alcohol and citrus hops. The citrus component is accented by a fruity citrus to earthy element of the chili inclusion. Deep earthy nose on this has subtle notes of tobacco leaves, leather and chocolate. The chocolate smell is very cocoa batter-like with a small vanilla inclusion providing a sweet scent that gains strength in it's presence as the brew warms.
The taste is tangy with alcohol. Bold bitterness with a flavor of roasty chocolate is right upfront with a roasted quality that merges to almost char-like quality. The tangy alcohol melds with a citrus and earthy flavor from the chili addition. The citrus/earthy flavor provides a pleasant boost of flavor and depth of complexity. The alcohol coupled with the heat of the chili creates a lasting tingle of heat in the back of the mouth and down the throat. As the brew warms, the vanilla comes out with a bit more sweetness that highlights the chocolate malt flavors. There is a very faint taste of cinnamon spice included that I didn't pick up on until after I took a few sips and started to talk. It's interesting how some flavors are hidden except in vapor form. The aftertaste is spicy with earthy flavors coupled with roasty grain. Excellent.
This is a full bodied brew with a modest to light level of carbonation. Excessively enjoyable, I would love to be able to drink this regularly. Well rounded as a stout in every aspect with lots of complexity. Perfectly incorporated abv throughout. I generally am not a huge fan of beers that have hot pepper inclusions. This one however is executed perfectly. One of my favorite beers of all time, love it. 2,254 charactersstakem, Jun 06, 2011
3.84/5  rDev -14.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Bowman2001 for this bottle. Poured into a Darkness snifter. 2011 vintage.
A- Poured straight down the middle into the glass. Looks to be very heavy liquid coming out of the bottle. Body is the color of Darth Vader's helmet, and a big beautiful brown head sits atop the beer. One of the darkest brown heads that I've seen on an imperial stout. Eventually the head fades to a nice brown ring.
S- Initial smell was identical to black olives. That's what I got for the first 30 seconds or so out of the bottle but as the beer warmed the usual suspects come out. Definite strong chocolate and roasted malt presence. Faint spiciness is noticeable within the maltiness of the nose. 
T- Outstanding heavy dose of chocolate. I can definitely taste all of the ingredients that the label lists. The chile peppers especially contribute a unique flavor throughout each sip but especially on the finish. 
M- Very smooth. Do not taste the 11.5% ABV at all. Extra points for the subtle spicy feeling on the back end. I wish I had another one of these to drink when its 10 below outside. Initial chocolate surge is balanced nicely by the rest of the beer.
O- This beer is delicious. I've tried many imperial stouts but this is the only one brewed with chile peppers I've had. Hope to have it again someday. 1,304 charactersblackhawks87, Jun 06, 2011

D - Mild Carbonation, oily in the mouth.
O - I was really looking forward to this one, but I was dissapointed. The ingredients are clearly present, but not in an appealing way. The wet tobacco flavor was just too much for me. The chile flavor was also present, but it didn't seem to fit. 528 charactersHuskyinPDX, Jun 01, 2011

A- Pours a deep black color that looks like motor oil but not quite there. One and a half finger light brown head shows good retention. Nice thick streaks of lace on the sides of the glass while drinking this one down. 
S- Coffee like front of thr aroma. It comes in strong but is blended in together with a lighter semi-sweet chocolate. By the end of the front of the nose the chocolate really dominates with hints of chile to add a little spice to it. Middle of the beer showcases the there is also a chile notes quite well with vanilla backing it up and small hints of barrel notes to it. Maybe a hint of darker fruit in the backend but the chile covers it up fast along with hitns of cinnamon. Chocolate seems to be the ending aroma with there being no alcohol at all in the ending. I mean there is no alcohol noticed at all.
T- Lots of semi-sweet chocolate dominate the front of the beer with a ever so light cinnamon flavor that adds a little more depth to the beer to start off with. The chocoalte flavor slowly turns into coffee like roast by the middle and this in turn blends together very nicely with vanilla and a hint of barrel. The chile comes through for the first time in the middle of the beer giving off a little heat. Chocoalte malts make another appearance in the backend with chile peppers making a bigger flavor. The chile flavor washes out with chocoalte in the final ending with a hint of vanilla. Very light alcohol finish in the beer makes it almost not noticable. 
M- Medium heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is a little light I thought for the overall beer. Chile, chocoalte, hints of vanilla are left on the palate. Aftertaste is a hint of alcohol, chile, vanilla, and loads of semi-sweet chocolate. The flavors of this beer glide from one to another effortlessly. A very well balanced and well flavored beer overall. No off flavors at all with maybe the chocoalte getting a little cloying if drinking a whole bottle of this I would think. No alcohol drying to speak of when drinking this beer but there is a nice chile heat added to the backend of the beer. 
O- This beer I thought was fantastic. The flavors blended so well together in the beer that I couldn't stop drinking it. A overall wonderful beer that I would love to have again. No alcohol heat or flavor makes this one a dangerous drinker which is my only negative aspect of this beer. A nice Cigar City beer like all the rest I have had from them. 2,511 charactersalleykatking, May 31, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber into tulip glass. In Mayan myth, Hunahpu gave cocoa to the Mayans. The base recipe is Marshal Zhukov Imperial Stout. It is aged on pasilla and ancho peppers as well as vanilla, cinnamon and cocoa nibs. Pours a pitch black body with a half thick, dense and creamy, very dark brown head that leaves nice lacing throughout. Aroma has lots of vanilla coffee, roast, some really pronounced cocoa and nips, hops, and spices. Some vanilla, chile peppers, and caramel. Flavor is similar and very rich. Lots of chocolate and cocoa nibs, caramel, vanilla, roasts, and coffee. Some light chiles, smoke, dark fruits, wood, and cinnamon spice. Finishes very rich, but fairly bitter from the hops, roasts, and cocoa nibs. Slowly dries with some vanilla, earth, and plenty of chocolate in a lengthy, rich aftertaste. Thick and sticky, yet smooth body with a soft, light carbonation. There was some light lingering heat in the finish. Overall, a really nice Imperial Stout that I went great lengths to acquire. Lots of rich flavors, very roasty, well hopped, and definitely has some pretty cool vanilla-chile things going on. Good one. 1,138 charactersCuriousMonk, May 28, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review taken from most recent batch. 
2011 batch - 5.0
Thanks to black13 for sharing some of this at a recent tasting. Also thanks to urwithdave and coastiesimon for hooking me up with bottles of this. 750ml bottle split into a pair of Portsmouth snifters and shared with TulipSnifter. 
A: Black sludge pouring into my glass. After the heavy pour, it's as black as they come with a big light brown (not dark tan) head. Top notch lacing. One of the sexiest looking stouts I've ever seen. 5/5
S: Like sniffing an open bottle of vanilla extract. Banana Cream pie but not in a Belgian yeast sense. A dessert in a glass is what I'm now expecting. 5/5
T: Load's of vanilla, cookie crumbs, and decadent chocolate fudge heavy on the milk fat. It should be noted that I can't discern the chiles at all. A diabetic coma waiting to happen in a death by sweets kind of way. There's a place for that kind of beer, and tonight it's in my glass! 5/5
M: Huge full body that comes off thick and chewy. Despite the massive head, the carbonation is kept to a minimum and this stays smooth and silky. 5/5
O: A beer I will trade for every year. I've never had the barrel aged version of this beer, but I am hard pressed to believe this can get any better. As far as non-barrel aged stouts go, this is as elite as it gets. I've never given a perfect five for a big stout... Until now. The 2010 batch was superb. I don't know how, but this is better. One of those beers that simply doesn't need to be aged. Get it, and drink it, NOW! 5/5
2010 Batch - 4.47
Thanks to Arbitrator for sharing a bottle of this at a tasting the first time I had it. I knew that I absolutely HAD to secure a bottle of my own after sipping on a couple ounces. That way, my wife and I could sit down with a snifter each and truly appreciate this beast. That is exactly what we are doing at the moment!
Viscous motor oil liquid on the pour, this stuff literally "glug-glugs" into our matching pair of Portsmouth snifters. Side note - I need to get my oil changed in my car. Even the head on this is as dark as I've ever seen. My wife referred to the head as "chocolate mousse" in appearance. I wish I could be original and come up with my own descriptor, but that really is a perfect mental image. I do want to comment that there appears to be a touch of red highlights to the head. Black as pitch, thick as used motor oil, and the darkest head I've ever seen spells perfect score on appearance in my book. 
Raw cocoa on the nose is accompanied by the vanilla bean. The big coffee that can usually be found on big stouts is missing here. Maybe a little chili is there as well, but that might just be power of suggestion. Also missing is any whiff of alcohol. Try as I may to find the ETOH, I simply can't do it. 
Wow! There is a TON going on taste wise. Chocolate doesn't get any more bitter than this. Strong nuances of vanilla, spicy chili pepper, and what seems to be a bit of lactose culture show up in a supporting role. It should be mentioned that the chili isn't tasted as much as its felt. The back of the tongue and soft palate feel the warmth on the finish. Unique and delicious. 
Ramnuts hosted the tasting where I tried this the first time. In his own words..."I can feel it coating my tongue!" Well said Frank. I can't say it any better myself. 
This is a big beer that needs to be savored. That said, I did not feel as if my 12+ ounce pour was over-bearing or heavy. I possibly could have had another, but the one was enough. A simply fantastic big stout that might just have no equal. It would be an absolute travesty if this never gets brewed again. One can only hope that this will be a regular release. If it is bottled next year let me be the first...ISO: Hunahpus '10. 3,753 charactershopsbreath, May 27, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750 ml brown bottle. 2011 Edition. This beer pours a super thick bad @ss used motor oil black. The ever expanding head is tan in color but is also black. I don't know if I've ever seen a head this dark in color. The aroma has some dark fruits, nice spice coming out , vanilla, and spicy pepper. It also has a big bready quality.
The taste at first is like a chocolate milkshake. A lot of roasted flavors coming in with some spice and spicy flavors. All its parts seem to work together perfectly while not being over the top. The palate is rich and creamy.
I still can't believe how much this tastes like a chocolate milkshake. It really reminds me of the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate at Serendipity 3 and if anyone has tried that then you'll now what I'm talking about. A huge world class Imperial Stout. 800 charactersHopsSchnapps, May 26, 2011

A- Pours a motor oil black with the scantiest deep mocha brown head. Wisps of the head remained for a minute or two. No lacing on the glass as to be expected.
S- It was like waking up and having some flavored coffee. Even before I brought it to my nose, whiffs of chocolate and hazelnut came through. The primary smell however was the coffee.
T- Follows up on the nose quite well. Powerful coffee at the end with hints of sweet chocolate at the beginning. The coffee has some vanilla and cinnamon/hazelnut characters that are more minimal than the coffee and chocolate.
M- Thick viscous body with good carbonation. There was some slight burn at the back end. It wasn't an alcohol burn because the alcohol wasn't noticeable.
O- An extremely tasty brew that I would gladly seek out again. I am glad I had a smaller pour (5oz) because it was so rich that I would have had a hard time finishing much more. Very tasty and well worth the hype. Possibly my favorite RIS. 1,063 charactersbetsona, May 23, 2011

Poured from a 750ml bottle into my lost abbey stemware glass. 
A - This pours out about as thick and black as I've ever seen. A thick 2 plus finger dark mocha head forms and slowly settles into a
layer of mocha foam and lots of lacing.
S - This smells interesting, a subtle smokiness, cocoa, vanilla, roasted malts, and spicy chiles. Smells of a stout.
T - Taste is similar to the nose. Starts with a bit a sweet chocolaty goodness, into a bitter roasted malt/coffee backed by some vanilla and cinnamon notes, and finishes with a touch of spicy chiles.
M - This feels medium bodied but really creamy and smooth, slightly hot from the chiles. Carbonation is perfect which compliments the beer nicely.
D - A sipper for sure. This is a heavy stout with many different layers. 790 charactersbeerpirates, May 22, 2011

Received this bottle from Chairmissing and I can't thank him enough!
A: The darkest, thickest beer I've seen to date. Decent carbonation.
S: Coffee, chocolate and vanilla.
T: Let me start by saying I came into this beer very skeptical. I never believe the hype behind beers but this left me speechless. I let the bottle sit for about 20 minutes after taking out of the fridge, poured into a snifter. The first taste was strong chocolate and alcohol with a interesting aftertaste. As it warmed the cinnamon and chili became quite apparent. The strong chocolate hits first then some malt and to finish it off the chili hits the back of the tongue simply amzing and this is now the most complex beer I've ever had.
O: Can't describe how much I love this beer. There is no way I will miss the release next year. I wouldn't trade away the cellar to try it but if you have a friend near the brewery or someone offering you a bottle for a decent trade definitely do it. 977 charactersAlpar, May 22, 2011

S: Strong notes of chocolate, with some heat and smokiness from the chilli's. Stronger hints of cinnamon emerge as the beer warms. 
T: Upfront has strong hints of roast malt and chocolate. A strong warming sensation is felt from the chilli's. Finishes with notes of vanilla and dark fruit. 
M: Thick and smooth. Leaves a burn on the your tongue and lips from the heat in the chilli's.
O: A very interesting interpretation of the style. All the ingredients use mesh well together creating a new surprise, with each sip bring something new to the table. Well done! 723 charactersBJRHOMEBREW, May 21, 2011

Appearance - This badboy looks jet black and like everyone said pours like used motor oil with a small dark chocolate head. Very nice lacing.
Smell - The smell of coffee almost feels as if it soccer kicks you in the face with subtle hints of dark chocolate and vanilla bean. I did not smell any traces of any kind of chili peppers though.
Taste - Starts with smooth dark chocolate and coffee taste, followed by a hint of the vanilla beans. Again no trace of any chili peppers.
Mouthfeel - It was very nice and smooth. A very thick stout with little carbonation. 
Overall - I enjoyed this and can't wait for my next adventure with it. I can't get this beer out of my head. I'm looking under the door mats like a crackhead for this beer. 930 charactersdvsbizzyb, May 20, 2011

A- Let me start of by saying this Bad Boy is THICK but not in a bad way. Pours like dark soy sauce/motor oil. Left a very nice coating on the glass when swirled.
S- BIG espresso dominated the smell. Hints of chocolate malt, dried fruit, as well as wet barrel. Smells fantastic.
T- Taste was exceptional and got better as it warmed up. You can really taste the Cocao and when you least expect it, BAM...the Vanilla hits you in the end. I really enjoyed this brew. Alcohol was undetectable and very well hidden.
M- Mouthfeel is THICK and coates the palate nicely. Light carbonation. 
O- Overall, this is one of the best beers that I've tasted. The taste of this beer becomes more complex and changes as it warms up but in a good way. Can't wait to get ahold of another bottle to cellar and enjoy this experience again. 1,037 charactersDevi0us, May 17, 2011

2010 vintage
Served in a snifter
Acquired in a trade with Gonzoillini
Never before have I seen a beer pour so dark and thick. It literally looked like used motor oil. The liquid was so viscous that it left a sticky yellow film on the glass. A thin, short lived wisp of mahogany colored froth capped the beer.
The aroma was fantastic. Super intense with strong raisin and port notes. Some bourbon too. Semi-sweet and moderately boozy. Brown sugar also came through strong. Lots of oak and char as well.
The flavor profile was just as extreme as the aroma. Super roasty with a huge malt profile up front. Port wine notes and a strong raisiny quality were also apparent. Moch-like flavors were quite prevalent. Some brown sugar too, and a bit of vanilla. The finish contained notes of smoke and a touch of earthy hops. The hops turned more citrusy and bitter as the beer warmed. There was also an indication of heat in the flavor profile, but I could not tell if this was from the cinnamon, the ancho chiles or the booze.
The mouthfeel was simply outstanding. Outrageously thick, creamy and viscous with a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence. I felt like I was drinking a milkshake. This was by far the most robust body I have ever encountered in a beer.
Hunaphu's is a fantastic beer that really pushes the limits of what a beer can be. My only complaint is that the cacao nibs, the chiles, the cinnamon and the vanilla were barely (or in some cases, not at all) detectible. Perhaps I need to sample a fresh bottle to discover all these nuances. 1,589 charactersDamian, May 15, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to BigBlacke for getting this one for me!
A-rich dark brown with a thick dark brown head that thins. i've personally never seen a head the dark before!
S-smells like thick dark chocolate syrup. there is definitely a little spice in there. smells very earthy. its not a strong scent, though i notice as i let the glass warm, it starts to become more aromatic. i'm even starting to smell some of the vanilla. 
T-first of all..this is a long experience with multiple levels. comes in with good thick cocoa beans (sometimes i get some cinnamon). it then transforms in to a fairly hefty bitterness followed by a taste of dark cocoa. the cocoa bean flavor lasts in to a long lasting after-taste and it is eventually paired by a chile spiciness. i really like this spiciness. it adds something to this stout that is rarely seen in big beers. this is definitely a good and complex stout.
M-very thick with a medium to low carbonation and a dry finish
O-overall, this is one of the best stouts i've had. i feel like it'd be a lot better with out the bitterness, but i do know that there are a lot of people out there that value that. i know its brewed with cinnamon and vanilla, but i'm having a hard time finding it, they're probably meddled in with all of the other intense flavors going on. truth be told, i'm going to be very sad when this bottle is empty. this is a world class stout. 1,392 charactersAdamBear, May 15, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750 mL bottle of 2011 batch shared with two others
A - Pours pitch black with half a finger of the darkest head EVER. Dark dark dark brown head with average retention and nice lacing. Never seen anything quite like it.
S - Vanilla, chocolate, considerable coffee bitterness. Even a little fig. The chile comes into play, as does the cinnamon. No booze to speak of, which is incredibly impressive.
T - I'm not worthy! This is insane. Vanilla and chocolate in droves. The chiles add this amazing je ne sais quoi that really rounds out and perfects the beer. Cinnamon is there to bring it all together and round things out. A touch of chile heat at the end to cap it off. Chocolate dominates the finish. I can hardly believe how good it is. The first time I've given a 5 in taste, and deservedly so.
M - Smooth, creamy, thick, and just right. A touch of heat at the end, from the chiles, which really enhances everything.
O - This is it. I never expected it to be this good, but this beer is just about perfect. A revelation, in many respects. Nothing is really close. Perfect use of the chile and the vanilla. Truly, this beer is unmatched. 1,143 charactersgreenmonstah, May 14, 2011

from android notes at DLD
vintage 2011
the pour was deep dark brown. not quite black but cose. very thick and viscous. deep creamy head. crazy lacing left over from the actual body as the sun hit the glass.
tons of spice and chocolate. hints of chocolate milk. bits of vanilla and roasted malt.
lots of deep chocolate and cinnamon. light vanilla and slight roast. very faint chili. i was expecting the chili factor to be stronger but it was rather subtle and really blended in well. a bit sweet.
very thick and chewy with a very moderate carbonation. really just coated the mouth with its thickness.
pretty amazing all around. my only complaint was the cinnamon aspect was very strong and dominating. but an outstanding stout. booze was hidden well. 800 charactershooliganlife, May 14, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - This beer defines black. The head alone is darker than most stouts. Absolutely amazing head retention and lacing. The best appearance I have seen on a stout yet.
S - Chocolate is the first thing that comes out to me, followed up by some dark roasted malts and coffee. Chile, and vanilla are there as well, just not as strong. Maybe even a hint of dark fruits in there as well. Very complex aroma full of a big diversity of smells.
T - Wow. You will never have a beer like this one. As complex as the aroma was, this is more. Balance of flavors completely shifts. Chile and roasted malts, coupled with chocolate and vanilla backing it up. Cinnamon, some more citrus-like fruit as well as the dark fruit (maybe dark cherry).
M - Not as thick as the pour indicates, but man this is still thick. Smooth as silk too. No alcohol noticeable, finish is sweet, slightly drying and leaves you with a sweet chocolate chile taste.
O - This is by far the best beer I have had. I am struggling to find a flaw so that this isn't straight 5's. I can't find much wrong with it. The aroma is deeply complex and perfectly balanced, the taste changes exactly as it needs to so as to keep you interested and stays just as complex and balanced. The mouthfeel is the only thing I can find a flaw in with the thin-ness of the body, but even that is still amazing.
Oh yeah, did I mention that this is a 2011 bottle? 1,399 charactersGarrettMD, May 13, 2011

The bottle that I had opened was damaged a little in shiping and some air got into the bottle so it tasted a little flat but was still hands down one of my favorite beers. Pour it in a glass and it looks like motor oil with a dark chocolate brown head. You can smell the chocolate and what ever peppers they used in brewing. Chocolate came through strongest in the taste for me along with the peppers, hints of coffee as well. Like I said one of my favorite beers I just wish more would have made it back with me from spring break. 689 charactersjsgreen16, May 13, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -4%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Vintage 2011
A: Pours obviously quite thick - crude oil. Broken, dark mocha foam coats the surface and then dissipates nearly immediately. No residual foam. No lacing. The beer coats the walls of the glass and tans the window.
S: Plenty of vanilla. Plenty of earthy and spicy chiles. The ancho chiles are more evident than the pasilla's, but nonetheless, the chile is there. Anise and licorice notes are also there, and IMO, more prominent than the cocoa. 
T: Dark chocolate truffles laced with salt, chile and vanilla. Decadent. Very sweet and sticky. The beer is not particularly complex, but the ingredients are fairly balanced in here. I've read that the chiles are the fastest dying aspect of the beer - I'll buy that. The cocoa is at the forefront of the beer, but the chiles offer the counter to the sweetness albeit subtly. The vanilla flourishes in the ol factory aspect of the palate. There's bitterness which is predominated by the malts IMO. 
M: Sticky, tacky, viscous, chewy. I really can't use enough adjectives to describe how thick and alive this beer feels. The thickness is only interrupted by the fine, sharp carbonation. There's no visual indication that this beer has carbonation, but the feel is spot on the for the style. Finish is dry and mouth watering. 
O: There's no question this is a fantastic beer. Does it live up to the hype? Almost. A little more from the chiles and I would say yes. I can't see the benefit of aging this in barrels. The bottle size is a bit too much for one, but would be great for four folks as a digestif. 1,563 charactersharrymel, May 13, 2011

*From notes
A BIG thanks to BZero007 for opening this one. Cheers, Nathan!
A: Damn. This may be the darkest brew I've encountered. With the chili infusion, it adds a bit of a muddy rosewood complexity to the 2.5 head and thick, sticky lacing.
S: Sugar, spice and everything nice. Dark roast black coffee intertwines with the peppery spice and makes for one memorable nose. Shrink me down and lock me inside the bottle - this stuff is incredible.
T: The balance here is pitch perfect. It's spicy, with the hot chili on the fore to the mid. The Zhukov really comes out on the finish, as it's charry and rich like the darkest of dark chocolate. Utterly spectacular.
M: One of the top two or three thickest beers I've encountered. It's huge, and unlike 2010's Zhukov, it's properly carbonated. Massive. Epic. This is such a big and lavish brew.
O: Loved it. I really can't find any fault with Cigar City's Hunahpu. If asked how to improve this one, I couldn't begin to tell you. It's perfect in almost every way, and one of the best beers I've ever had. Offering Joey Redner your first born isn't enough to satisfy the Gods, as this one's worth your second child too. 1,272 charactersRhettroactive, May 12, 2011

Nice deep black with just a few subtle hints of red creeping in (from the chilies mabye?). Dark khaki head that dissipates pretty quickly, but left some thick lacing that continued to stick around throughout.
Really complex aroma. Chocolate, coffee, and all the sweet goodness from the RIS, then spice and everything nice from the chilies. Super well blended. Rich, complex, and interesting nose.
Basically everything you expect from the nose. While the nose was slightly more subtle and balanced, the chilies really kick up the spice in the flavor. Really awesome flavor. Almost like mole sauce. 
Thick and creamy, just how you'd expect a RIS. Full-bodied to the max. A little viscous and filling. Couldn't pound this beer. But a nice sipper. 852 charactersCaskBeerouac, May 12, 2011

Received in trae from J2Brew2, big thanks!
Poured an extremly dark thick pour with a dark brown head forming and hanging around for a bit. The aroma was roasty but had the backbone of a chile and cinnamon combo. A extremly lovely aroma and appearance with this brew. The taste really blew me away as the body was thick it pushed the roasty chocolate notes through that were perfectly balanced with the chile/cinnamon combo. I keep placing these two aromas/tastes together as they seemed to become one in the drink. The flavor and aroma of the chile was apparant but the cinnamon burn and flavor was just behind it pushing it through. I have not seen a lot of balanced RIS with a bidy this thick in my life and I extremly satisfied with this particular one. I am marking my calender for next year when the next release will be.
If you have yet to try this brew, make sure you do. 914 charactersBZero007, May 11, 2011

2011 - 750ml bottle.
I'm not sure if I can easily review this beer. It was just so amazing.
Color is very very dark. motor-oil black and beautiful. Small 1/2 finger brown head that retains for a while.
The smell of of cocao powder and cinnamon, roasted dark malts. Didn't really notice any of the chilis, though, in the smell.
Taste is of rich dark chocolate and cocoa. Some spice from the chilis, but way in the background. Hints of vanilla. Megatons of gloriousness.
Mouthfeel was thick with little carbonation.
This is a great beer. One of the best i've ever had. Now I just need to find more of it. 710 charactersThoreauLikeAGirl, May 11, 2011

Uhhhh-MAZING! This review has been a LONG time coming. Had the privilege and honor of attending 2011 Hunahpu's Day at Cigar City Brewing, in Tampa as a part of our vacation to Florida. 
A: Dark, dark dark! A true beauty amongst stouts. Pours like motor oil, and is thick like tar. Medium/dark head with a moderate retention. 
S: Sweet, with the aroma of chocolate, subtle coffee scent, hues of vanilla and cinnamon. Such a complex whiff to a beginners nose!
T: This is definitely one of the best beers that I have ever had. Not an undrestatement. There is an intense cocoa/chocolate taste, but still hues of vanilla and coffee kick in strong throughout. There are also subtle spices that keep it from being overpoweringly sweet.
M: Full-bodied, creamy, goes down smooth. Slight after-burn, but definitely can be compared to sipping a fine, aged scotch.
O: This is by far my ULTIMATE favorite beer to date. I will saving the last 3 and opening them on special occassions. Definitely would consider getting on a plane next year with the sole intention of attending the next Hunahpu's release. 1,117 charactersLuvzsurfrz, May 10, 2011

This stout looked as good as any other stout we had that night (11 DL, EH, Depth Charge) so it's hard to give it a better score than the others. It was opaque black with a thin layer of foam. It also appeared to be thinner than the others with nicer legs in the glass. The beer smelled like cocoa powder with a little fruity chiles and warm cinnamon, but mostly it was dominated by the dark malt. The beer tasted very nicely malty with smoky pepper upfront, chocolate and spicy cinnamon. The beer has a nice warming alcohol in the finish that is accentuated by the back heat from the chiles.
This is a nice, interesting beer that I would love to try again, but with a big plate of roasted carnitas, avocado, and grilled bell peppers and onions. 818 charactersSoonami, May 10, 2011

First Release so 2010 Vintage
A- Absolutely beautiful. Pours like motor oil with a thin 1 finger brown head that is just sitting there. Decent head retention with some really nice legs behind it that coat the glass. This to me defines what an Imperial Stout should look like. 
S- Cinnamon up front with some nice spicy chilies and sweet chocolate. Plenty of roasted dark malts and wood characters coming through as well. Alcohol comes through as well but not to crazy. 
T- First taste brought out a strong roasted coffee and sweet milk chocolate character with a nice cinnamon spice in the finish. Not much heat or pepper coming through like the aroma just a slight bit of heat in the back of the throat which to me is a great thing and adds to the overall mouthfeel. I hate over spicy beers so this is the perfect amount. Digging deeper the flavors of the barrel come out and combine well with the sweet vanilla beans and give it a nice musty wood flavor. 
M- Full bodied with moderate to low carbonation and a nice wet and slightly spicy finish.
Overall i have to say that this beer is exceptional and extremely complex. All the right flavors come out and combine amazingly with the already A+ beer Zhukov.

A: Black as night with a ridiculously dark one finger head. Not much lacing to speak of.

T: The cinnamon is the first thing that you notice here as well. Then notes of vanilla, chocolate and a faint hint of the chiles.

Poured into a snifter.
A - Pours a thick jet black with the darkest head that I've ever seen. The head was about a 2-finger billowy chocolate color and had great retention. Great lacing. 
S - Large amounts of spicy chili's with a slight vanilla undertone. Also present is roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and sweet dark malts. It definitely smells different, but not so much in a good way.
T - Up front are notes of cocoa, a mild coffee, and a little vanilla. I can't get past the sickeningly sweetness that follows next. On the finish, I get a lot of cinnamon and a little bit of spicy chili's, but both are more unpleasant than anything. Very strong presence of burning alcohol.
M - The mouthfeel was good and pretty much what I'd expect. It was smooth, creamy, rich, and fairly full-bodied. My only gripe was that it seemed to be a little over carbonated. 
D - Overall, the drinkability just isn't there for me. The taste is unappealing and tough to drink, given the sweetness and alcohol burn.
I'm glad that I got a chance to try it, but that'll be it for me. 1,184 characterskevinv, May 07, 2011

A-Pours a bitch black with a reddish brown head. Thick juicy oil with perfect carbonation.
S-Smells very sweet, lots of dark chocolate and some cinnamon and a subtle coffee scent.
T-This just might be the best beer I have ever had. It tastes like a german chocolate cake with a lot of vanilla in the after taste. There are subtle hints of the spices from the chilies that are in the aftertaste more than right away and the coffee shines through perfectly. 
M-Creamy mouthfeel, very smooth going down but a little bit of a burn. Nonetheless you know the alcohol is there but you cannot tell except for the slight burning. Even though you can feel the burn it is comparable to sipping on a nice scotch.
O-One of the greatest most drinkable beers I have ever had. I would never pass this down as it is phenomenal. Super drinkable for being almost 12 percent. Best thing cigar city has ever done! 926 charactersbeerhan, May 06, 2011

It has an aroma of strong dark chocolate with coffee in the background. It tastes of chocolate up front, coffee and vanilla notes with a finishing burn from the alcohol then from the peppers. This beer is so complex I am tasting something different each time I try it. Hunahpus is the greatest beer I've ever had, so complex and so delicious! 472 charactersjcartamdg, May 05, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is enough of a reason for me to pick up and move to Florida (you know, asides the beaches, beautiful weather, cheaper housing, and Disney).
Appearance - I could look at this beer all day. Actually thats a lie, because I would drink the shit out of it. Maybe if I had a photograph...Anyway, fantastic. Black as any good stout should be with a beautiful brown, yes brown, not mocha or off white, just full on brown head. Awesome. Unfortunately for someone like me who is totally digging this head it doesn't really want to hang out to long, oh well, nothing lasts forever. This liquid resembles oil closer than a stout.
Smell - A myriad of unusual aromas attack your nose with this one. Most people always review stouts the same way: raisins, coffee, caramel, choco...blah, blah, blah. We've read them a hundred times. This bad boy hits you with spice, vanilla, and earthiness, okay, yes, there are some elements of chocolate, and some hardcore roasted malts, but this beer will definitely hit your nose with something fantastic that is uncommon in most stouts, and you will love it.
Taste - The real winner in this whole review. In the front you have some heavy dark bakers chocolate combined with roasted malts, then some vanilla smoothness in the middle, and in the finish you get some faint hotness from the chilies and the cinnamon. It is out of this world. Let it warm up before drinking it, I feel like you would lose out on a lot of wonderful flavors.
Mouthfeel - Very thick, amongst the thickest I've had. For me I really enjoy a dark, hearty, rich, thick stout. I totally get that not everyone is in to that, but if your looking for a stout that you could drink with a spoon this is your beer.
Overall - Well, I clearly really enjoyed this beer. I have had many stouts from Cigar City and everyone of them have been incredible. This one however is the reigning champ of their stout line. Wonderful and delicious. 1,935 charactersRandomBattle, May 04, 2011
3.96/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4FRE$H 2011 Batch
Appearance -- Pours like motor oil, jet black with faint ruby about the edges and a slim dark chocolate-hued head. It's hard to knock this view. Wish the head had more staying power, but still quite photogenic.
Smell -- Aside from the semisweet roast malt aromas, chile and cocoa are most apparent, with spicy chile heat being most dominant. Vanilla, and finally cinnamon, make themselves known after multiple whiffs. The chile heat nearly singes the hair on your nose - very sharp. Certainly interesting, but not the inviting aroma I was hoping for.
Taste -- Charred malt, molasses sweetness, smoked chiles in chocolate, and in the distance, vanilla and cinnamon. The chili is well-done, lending some rich smokey flavor mid-palate and a nice spicy finish. Lasting flavors of cocoa, red pepper flake, and roast malt that mimics coffee.
Mouthfeel -- Full-bodied and viscous with mild/moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel flirts with under-carbonation, but is still successful.
Overall -- This was a very nice treat. I appreciate the cocoa and chile additions, but The whole time I drank this I couldn't help but wish that the mouthfeel of the Zhukov's I had recently was this good. Some of the additions, like vanilla and cinnamon, seem to cover up some of the malt complexity of Zhukov's.
Glad I finally got to try this one in its prime, but I'd take a properly carbonated Marshall Zhukov's all the same. 1,426 charactersyeahnatenelson, May 03, 2011

Alright, so I've been dying to try this and figured Easter was an appropriate occasion. Poured it out into some HotD snifters with a fellow BA. The first thing I noticed was the generous head and insane, sexy time, legs. 
Smelled like grade school. I couldn't put my finger on it at first, but what this really smells like is science class, circa 6th grade. I remember it like it was yesterday (dissolve to a long time ago...)
Ms. Janonis drove a Fiero and had a boy's haircut. We didn't know better and just thought she was damn cool. She was teaching us about physical change due to applied heat. We were cooking down sugar to make candy, basically. I'll never forget the incredible smell that cooked sugar made as it melted down into a clear brown glass. That is exactly what Hunahpu smells like and it is awesome. 
Taste is a home run, too. Cinnamon and burnt sugar and vanilla and then, as the last taste is leaving your tongue, the chile heat. Just a little tingle on the buds. It's like a Chinatown happy ending. 
This beast is also creamy like horchata. Creamy like you could eat it with a fork. Creamy like I am not sure I will ever be able to completely wash it out of the glasswear, now stained permanently brown. 
Anyway, this is a special brew and worth every effort to obtain. I wish I had more. 1,363 charactersjohnbjaeger, Apr 25, 2011

Vintage 2010
Appearance- Black with a chocolate head that sticks around for a min then dissipated to a ring. This is the darkest head I have ever seen.
Smell- Chocolate and some chilies are prominent. 
Taste- Very smooth. Lots of chocolate and the smallest hint of chilies. Very good. Some vanilla in the background. 
Mouthfeel- Very thick. I am surprised that the head sticks around as much as it does. Coats the glass quite a lot. 
Overall- Damn this is a good beer. I usually do not like chilies, in beer or anywhere else. This would be an exception. Small chili presence and it works well. 
Micheal also brought a 2011 version which I liked a lot better. All of the flavors were much sharper. Much more complex and interesting. The actual numbers reflect the 2011 version. 901 charactersMADhombrewer, Apr 24, 2011

I will start off by saying this has been a top 5 want for quite some time. My expectations are very high. I decided to open it fresh rather than cellar it. I was happy to share this with my tasting posse. SundaySuperFriends.
My Darkness snifter was shaking with anticipation. Pours a violent deep dark jet black. Not one shred of light is escaping this beast. Black hole with a reddish tan two finger head sums it up. My glass is stained with a blackish tan hue after i swirl.
Good thing I was blessed with a large nose so I could take in all the intoxication from my glass. Wow this smells freakin epic. Cinnamon, cocoa nib, and vanilla rounds it out. Cinnamon and cocoa are the front runners in my mouth. In the end of the swallow they've brought their friend chili pepper with them. What an incredible sip. Carbonation is dialed in to perfection. The beer is thick but not chewy. Fuck this is unbelievable. 
Best beer I've had to date hands down. Number two isn't even in eye shot. If you took an x-ray of my stomach after drinking this you would see a flippin party taking place. If you don't like this beer you need a lobotomy. 1,215 charactersTheDudeRules, Apr 20, 2011

2011 vintage.
A - This is one of the darkest and thickest beers I've seen in a long time. It slowly glugs out of the bottle, and at first it doesn't look that it'll get much head, but it gradually builds a dark brown head, rivaling the darkest I've seen. Retention is fairly low, but it leaves a nice cap behind. Lacing is thick and generous, coating most of the glass.
S - The smell on this is phenomenally complex. Everything that is mentioned on the bottle is here in spades. The chocolate comes through almost to the point of being fudge, and the chilies are definitely noticeable. It vaguely reminds me of Great Divide's Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, in that it has a slightly piney and woody aroma, but not so strong, thankfully.
T - Wow. Talk about a deep and flavorful beer. At first, the malts are sweet and the chocolate retains a ton of fudge, and then comes wave after wave of taste, from the chilies to the cinnamon to the oak and vanilla. The chilies are spicy but not exactly burning hot, but enough to leave a nice tingling on the tongue. The cinnamon comes through from the beginning to the end, and brings a unique twist that's absolutely phenomenal. The cinnamon is the thing that really keeps drawing me back. 
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy-bodied with good carbonation. The chilies do give off some residual heat here, leaving a prickly tingling feeling on the tongue and lips. Doesn't coat the mouth as much as I thought it would.
D/O - Drinkability is high. While the alcohol is not incredibly noticeable, its definitely a sipper merely for the fact that just one sip is loaded with flavor. If you don't like cinnamon, you may want to steer clear, but if you do, this will be right up your alley. 1,824 charactersnhindian, Apr 20, 2011

A: This has the darkest head of any beer I've ever seen. Sort of like chocolate milk when you've put too much chocolate sauce in it. The lacing an retention is great.
S: Definitely getting the chili and cinnamon dominating some chocolate and roastiness. Some vanilla and alcohol mix in as well.
T: Recently I was at a food pairing for Oskar Blues, and with Ten Fidy they paired a Chocolate Chili Cake. This tastes exactly like that. Wonderful dark chocolate leads it off and gives way to a wonderful array of spices. The chili and cinnamon dominate the back end of the taste, in that order, and fade slowly back to what seems like a coffee roastiness. The chilis leave a tingle and perhaps a hint of spiciness on the tongue. The taste is so complex. Perhaps some oakiness resting in the background. Every taste brings a new experience.
MF: Dark and heavily bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Only a hint of alcohol. It goes down creamy, with a silkiness that makes you want to keep taking sips.
O: Truly a wonderful concoction. I completely understand the hype. If only I could get more to throw in the cellar. Blown away. 1,179 charactersrusswbeck, Apr 20, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Obliterative onyx with a rapidly expanding crown of coffee milkshake-like cream that overflowed onto the desktop before it could be contained. No carbonation issues here. The lid looks lovely, lasts, and should lay down some pretty impressive lace when it melts. Note: it doesn't, but this is still great looking ale.
Cigar City used an outstanding base beer as the starting point for this inventive offering. Even though my bottle is an estimated one year of age, most of the added ingredients are noted in the nose. Peruvian cacao nibs and the earthy spiciness of the Ancho and Pasilla chiles for sure. Cinnamon and vanilla bean slightly less so.
It looks like Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout plays the same role as Old Rasputin for North Coast and Yeti for Great Divide. In other words, it's a granite-solid Double/Imperial stout that tastes great, almost no matter what's added to it. This stuff is de-freakin-licous right out of the gate and should only improve with warming.
Hunahpu's Imperial is impressive quasi-aged beer that is probably even more impressive when fresh. The always generous ktrillionaire offered me a bottle of the latest vintage just yesterday. Hmmm... may have to take him up on that. Where would we be without the occasional trade for outstanding regional-only beer?
Flavors include an intense dark chocolate fudginess, sticky molasses, coconut oil, vanilla beans, a soft blip of earthy-spicy chiles, and sprinklings of warm cinnamon. The inspired additions have turned an already deep and complex beer into an even deeper and more complex beer. This is a palate pleaser par excellence.
My 750 ml of Marshal Zhukov's (thanks again Casey) had some carbonation issues. This bottle is an indication of what that bottle should've been like. The mouthfeel is the very definition of smoothly creamy lusciousness. Laid-back bubbles add just the right amount of volume, then cut out and allow beer to ooze over tongue. 
Hunahpu is the Mayan god of creation. Cigar City Brewing has every reason to be proud that they have created the masterpiece that is Hunahpu's Imperial Stout. A fresh bottle might have challenged for the best of 2011. 2,164 charactersBuckeyeNation, Apr 19, 2011

Poured up absolutely black and thick with a dark brown head. Looked simply *stunning* in my chalice leaving a brown, oily film on the sides of the glass as I gently swirled it around.
Smell was whiskey, vanilla, chocolate, chile peppers, and loads of other things I couldn't readily identify; quite a lot going on!
Taste was immensely chocolate with spent coffee grounds, spicy chile peppers, chocolate covered cherries (wasn't expecting this), finishing with a lovely warming sensation attributable to both the easily detectable cinnamon and chile peppers. Very complex and absolutely incredible!
Mouthfeel was very heavy, but silky smooth leaving a nearly oily coating in the mouth. 
I found this to be exceptionally well crafted, a real privilege to enjoy, and the first 'elusive' beer to actually live up to all the hype! Very, very well done! 908 charactersSilentSabre, Apr 19, 2011

2011 Edition 750mL bottle poured into Cigar City snifter on April 14, 2011.
A- Poured vigorously into the bottom of the snifter. Thick and oily, like draining the oil in your car. Absolutely no head, no matter how hard I tried. Acceptable lacing, given the ABV.
S- Immediate chocolate presence, followed by a nice vanilla and and coffee smell. Let it warm up significantly, the cinnamon and chile pulls through at the end. Impressed.
T- Sweet vanilla chocolate up front, followed almost immediately by a nice cinnamon and spice from the chiles. The chiles mask the alcohol beautifully, and create a heat I wish more stouts had.
M- Thick and creamy, with medium-low carbonation. Coats the mouth and throat without overwhelming, leaving a nice lingering flavor.
O- Considering this beer's exceptional status going in, I was more that pleasantly surprised that all the ingredients in the bottle are displayed in both taste and smell. I didn't think I would love the chiles, but I was proven wrong. Give this beer time to warm to a little below room temperature, and it becomes a frontrunner for my favorite non-bal stout. A very well balanced beer that is worth seeking out. 1,288 charactersJoshVandy, Apr 18, 2011

Taste: Very sweet roast hits the tongue first. This is followed by dark chocolate, some chili pepper spice, cinnamon, and some dark fruit notes. The finish is roasty and sweet, the flavors blend together well.
Mouthfeel: This one just coats your mouth. Very thick and viscous with just the right amount of carbonation (mild). The finish is mildly dry.

A – Black body with the one of the darkest heads I’ve ever seen. The head has super-fine bubbles and holds up well with nice retention and lace. The beer is incredibly viscous with better legs than most red wines. 
S – Dark brown sugar, cinnamon, espresso, ancho chilies, light booze.
T – This beer is what a billionaire's milk chocolate should taste like. Chocolate covered espresso beans, delicious raisiny ancho chilies, cinnamon, soft pepper heat, toffee, and vanilla. The flavors are soft, complex, well balanced and prominent. An absolutely beautiful flavor profile.
M – Stunningly smooth, medium/full body. Great sweet vanilla / spicy chili / bitter cocoa finish with a touch of warm booze.
O – Fantastic balance and flavor. It’s rare that a brewer posts an ingredient bill as complex as this on the bottle and everything comes through. It's even rarer that those flavors come through so clean and incredibly well integrated. Tip of the hat to CCB, job well done. 1,018 charactersvfgccp, Apr 13, 2011

A: Pours a motor oil thick jet black with very dark brown voluminous head that reaches upward to fill the glass. One of the darkest heads that I have ever seen. Next to no light gets through this when held up to the light. This looks absolutely amazing, head hangs around for a while and leaves plenty of dark lacing around the glass. 
S: Doesn't smell incredibly strong at first. Sweet with lots of dark malt and roasted barley, a touch of cinnamon and alcohol. Bourbony vanilla and lots more cinnamon come out as it warms up.
T: Very unique stout, roasted barley with lots of thick chocolate coats my tongue as the chilies make my mouth tingle. The cinnamon and vanilla are in there as well, just not as powerful as the flavor from the chocolate and chilies. The additions of the cacao nibs, chilies, vanilla, and cinnamon combine incredibly well with each other to create a truly unique and delicious taste.
M: Extremely full bodied, very thick and smooth like a true RIS should be. Some carbonation is able to penetrate through the thickness and create a slight tingle on my tongue. The chilies add a pleasantly mild, lingering sting on my lips as the alcohol warms my gut.
O: Overall, this is a great RIS. Delicious, smooth and packed with diverse flavors. You can really taste and smell all the additions of cacao nibs, chilies, vanilla and cinnamon. I will be seeking more bottles of this when it comes out again next year. 1,546 charactersAzurescens, Apr 11, 2011

2010 vintage.
Pours black with a beautiful, thick and frothy dark brown head.
The aroma is quite complex, but rich cocoa, chocolate and vanilla stand out the most. I'm picking up only hints of the chili and cinnamon, though I probably wouldn't be able to identify it is such had I not known what it was. There are also some faint dark fruit notes.
The taste is of chocolate and light vanilla, followed up by some cinnamon heat and faint, almost smoky, chili notes. Very enjoyable. I really enjoy the chili and cinnamon notes, as it adds enough burn to let you know it's there, but doesn't become over-whelming.
The mouthfeel is just wonderful. An incredibly thick body, with just enough carb to keep it from becoming too heavy.
I really enjoyed this stout very much and I definitely now understand the love for it, though I probably won't actively seek any more of it. 906 charactersvkv822, Apr 11, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I got this in a trade from kmurray8621. Thanks for the trade and the opportunity to try this beer! I've been saving it for a special occasion and decided to crack it for National Beer Day. 
750ml bottle poured into the Chimay signature chalice I had on hand.
Look: black body with a dark red, very thin head that ends up being a few bubbles hugging the sides of the glass after a short while. The head color is very interesting. Its kind of a cinnamon colored and is something I haven't seen before. There's no lacing except for brief spots clinging to the side for dear life. Very nice looking Imperial stout.
Smell: roasted malt, chocolate, and vanilla stand out with some tobacco and hints of chilies once it reaches room temperature. 
Taste: alcohol soaked dark fruit, some chocolate from the cacao nibs blended well with the vanilla, roasted and chocolate malt, a bit of smokiness, and a bit of spice from the chilies. The spiciness is luckily fairly subdued, since I don't do heat very well. The cinnamon I am really struggling to find and really can't. Perhaps the age has taken that out? 
Feel: full bodied, which is apparent even when I begin the pour. The alcohol is apparent but not overwhelming. It is sweet without being cloying, thankfully. There's no heat from the chilies. 
Drinkability: certainly a sipper, since this full flavored beer is clearly meant to be savored.
Overall: I really enjoyed this one. While some of the ingredients don't seem to mesh well in theory, in practice they are all quite nicely and really present something new and unique for the style. I thoroughly enjoyed this one and will seek it out again and am going to be looking for General Zhukov in the future, too! Well done, Cigar City! Cheers! 1,744 charactersSkunkWorks, Apr 08, 2011

From Notes:
A: Absolutely amazing pour. Ominous pitch black oil, huge deep brown head (almost purple), retention is surprisingly good given the ABV
S: Complex to say the least. Chocolate, fudge, vanilla, coffee, lactose, cinnamon, and dark fruit to name the main notes. Overall sweet smelling, but definitely has lots of depth
T: As I suspected, a sweet beer, and alcohol is pretty well hidden. Vanilla, fudge, chocolate, coffee, and cinnamon come the the front. I never really picked up on the peppers, but then again, there is so much going on.
MF/O: Thick and oily feel to it. Smooth and creamy despite the moderate carbonation. 
Overall, a stout that should be grouped in with the best, but I never really got that "wow" factor that I was expecting. I still prefer the Abyss and KBS over Hunahpu's, but let's see what some cellaring does to this 958 charactersscottyshades, Apr 05, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750mL bottle from this year's release. The beer and the Cigar City snifter it was poured in are both courtesy of Whartonallboy. This one was allowed to warm from the fridge for about half an hour before being opened.
Hunahpu's pours the typical solid stout black, with at most a finger and a half of *dark* caramel foam topping it. Retention is decent, but lacing is barely there. The nose is a bit muted, but what is there is intoxicating. Rich chocolate is the centerpiece, and it's buoyed by notes of cinnamon and peppery spice. The aroma may have been a bit dull, but that wasn't the case once the beer hit my lips. What would have been a deep dark chocolate base is brought much closer to milk chocolate from the sweetness from the vanilla beans. Cinnamon acts as the transition to a spicy, almost smoky finish from the chiles. Everything is in perfect proportion as well, with the chocolaty notes forming the basis of the flavor profile, and then filtering down to cinnamon and then chiles. The body is perfectly rich and creamy, but the carbonation isn't quite up to the task of cutting through all that. Hunahpu's isn't quite elite in every facet, but it brings it where it counts (the flavor). I'll be doing my best to acquire some more in the future. 1,261 charactersaxeman9182, Apr 03, 2011

A- Pitch black motor oil falls into a pint glass. A massive dark mocha head forms and retains very well. Looking damn good so far. Huge coat of dark lace.
S- Huge roast malt and milk chocolate off the top. A nice vanilla presence as well. Good caramel malt presence making me think it will be sweet.
T- Massively filled with cocoa and chocolate notes on top of the sweet roast malt caramel Zhukov's I remember. The vanilla helps round this out. A tiny bit of chili and spice as well, cinnamon is pretty much minimal to me. Fairly smoky from the chili peppers?
MF- Pretty thick body with low end carbonation. Oily feel overall coating the tongue. Somewhat spicy.
DB- I like this beer overall, I think the blend of ingredients worked out well. Tastes like dessert. I am glad I split the bottle but this one drinks very well considering what it is. 966 characterscbutova, Apr 03, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a thick black as midnight color with a small chocolate brown head. This sucker has got some weight to it.
The vanilla bean aroma stands out and along with the cacao nibs, it brings a tootsie roll scent. There is some zesty-ness from the spices but nothing very strong. A very rich dessert aroma.
The taste is of a roasted malt base with some strong ground coffee notes. This is followed by caramel, cacao, and the vanilla. There is a lemony acid twang to keep the sweet in balance. Very light spice from the chiles, they seem to add a different layer of sweetness and a slight metallic note. I don't pick up much from the cinnamon but that might get blended in with the chile spice. A lot going on.
The feel is very thick with soft carbonation that give the beer a silky feel. Very sweet to start but finishes with a roasty bitterness. Quite sticky on the finish. There is some burn from the chiles, perhaps the alcohol as well.
A very tasty beer with lots of complex flavors. Its a big beer and better enjoyed in smaller samples. Great dessert beer. 1,060 charactersGmann, Apr 02, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 2011 bottle thanks to BA muskabeatz.
A: Pours a dark, black, motor oil color that we've all seen so many times before. Where this beer really stands out to me is its head, this thing foamed up to maybe an inch and a half of, way over what I've come to expect from the latest and greatest big Russian Imperial, a bit too much for my preference. The head was so creamy it seemed to keep swirl lines.
S: Here's a sticking point with me, my drinking buddies described the aroma as "subtle", which to me says that it's not very strong. Initially I just barely smelled a sort of biscuity scent with a hint of pepper, but as it warmed it I caught much more sweet chocolate and vanilla. The way this aroma changes makes me wish I could give it two ratings, initially, I found it lacking, but as it warmed it came around.
T: This thing is marvelous! The very first thing I taste is chocolate, but just like packages from good traders, it's laden with extras! Just like that special release you get as an extra, this beer comes with a little peppery spiciness tinged with real cinnamon. Somehow all of these flavors work well together, AND THEN finishes out with a bit of sweet vanilla. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering.
M: So creamy! Thick and evenly carbonated, somehow this stout still feels almost like it's been whipped. Really a unique mouthfeel experience.
O: This is a good one, lives up the hype in my opinion, the peppery spiciness and cinnamon make this beer one-of-a-kind. Seek this one out if at all possible! 1,539 charactersInfernal75, Apr 01, 2011

Pours dead black with the most amazing cocoa head ever. 
Smell is a bit off-putting. Nothing inviting here, bitter, dark hops and/or cacao. 
Taste is COMPLEX. Getting cacao beans, and a healthy cinnamon burn which is amazing. Coffee roast coming through as well. Not getting a ton of vanilla. Did I mention Cinnamon and chile burn?
Wow, this is a wonderful taste. I love cinnamon and chocolate combined and this is the best of all worlds - Cinnamon, chocolate and BEER! But it works. This reminds me of the descriptions of ancient Aztec hot chocolate drinks back when the cacao bean wasn't the invention of Milton Hershey. 
Not much else to say. Not going to be a favorite if you don't like new things. :) I love this - though I can't see drinking it all night. 805 charactersradioscooter, Mar 31, 2011

poured into a cigar city snifter.
a- looks amazing! a lot darker than I expected, pours like used motor oil (yes you hear this all the time but it seriously pours pitch-black!). pour stirs up a beautiful half inch dark brown head. doesn't last very and disappears into small bubbles hugging the edges of the glass
s- put my nose in the glass and took a big whiff... barely anything... put my nose really close to the goods and still get very little aroma. 
dissapointed I begin to drink.
fast forward to half way thru the glass and bam I get hit with a wall of aromas! every glass afterward; amazing. this guy is very picky with the tempature, a bit too cold and it's hidden away, but once it's warm enough it's outstanding. upfront is the chocolate and vanilla with some roasted malts and coffee. in the back the peppers and cinnamon appear nicely
t- like the nose my first sip was... ok. very familiar to zuhkov with some added spices in the back. this is it? it's good but not amazing. maybe tastebuds are out tonight? 
nope they are workin just fine, as it warmed in my hand it suddenly exploded with flavor! awesome chocolate and vanilla up front with some cinnamon, the pepper spices kick in half way thru to the finish. wow these peppers work well too and they start prickling on your tongue as it rolls around. it's very unique to this beer and they pull it off. 
m- cigar city has the mouthfeel down on their beers and this is no different. great mouthfeel from the start, think and chewy the entire time.
o- this expirience is defintly memorable. this one requires to be a tad warmer than most so keep that in mind when you decided to crack it open. maybe due to the peppers and cinnamon, but when it's there, it's fricken there, and than dammit you don't have enough to squench this new found taste.
I had high expectations for this guy, I've had a lot of cigar city and they have always exceeded my expectations. this one really let me down at first, and than turned me around and kicked me off my chair. trade for it and try it fresh, keep in mind to let this guy warm up a bit longer than your typical imperial stouts and be prepared for a very unique and memorable experience. 2,241 charactersKevSal, Mar 29, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle into a snifter. Thanks to Alieniloquium for the trade!
Hunahpu's pours with a pithy blackness that only the darkest midnights are known to provide. Edgar Allen Poe stuff, here. One of the most attractive billows of foam builds with each swirl of the glass--creamy and thick, brick red in color. The aroma wafts intricate notes of cinnamon, sweet dark chocolate, vanilla beans, and roasted Earth. Perhaps unfairly so, the smell is weaker in comparison to the flavor of Hunahpu's (and other upper echelon Imperial Stouts), but still quite good.
And speaking of flavor, sweet Mother-of-God this stuff is good! Absolutely bursting at the seams with rich chocolate, molasses, and vanilla sweetness up front, and the cinnamon and chili peppers take over mid-palate to dry out the finish with an earthy, organic gingerbread note that draws me in sip after glorious sip. Mouthfeel is rich and velvety with a picture perfect carbonation level. Honestly, this beer has little room for improvement. I had my doubts about Cigar City after being let down by a few of their more hyped offerings, but 2011 Hunahpu's is the real deal. A "must-try" in every sense of the word. 1,174 characterswagenvolks, Mar 27, 2011
4.04/5  rDev -10.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Brought a 2010 bottle of this to a tasting a little while back. Received from a generous trader. Served in a Cigar City snifter as it would be crazy to drink this out of any other vessel.
Pours as dark as any bowel movement after a heavy day of drinking Pepto-Bismol, but with a lot better head retention. Cigar City has a way of crafter thick stouts that look great.
Smell is of chocolate and perhaps the faintest hint of vanilla, but the chili peppers are dominating and really detracting from the aroma. Taste is similar but slightly better. The peppers are not to my liking, but to each their own. Mouthfeel is thick with smooth and creamy carbonation. 
This is a nice beer, but I'd take Marshal Zhukov over this any day, but I am glad that I got the chance to try it. 775 charactersLunch, Mar 26, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 750 mL bottle poured into my new Cigar City snifter. Big thanks to Cheesemoose for both. 2011 vintage.
Appearance: Marshall Zhukov and its variations have to be some of the deepest, pitch black beers I've seen. Count Hunahpu's among that group for sure. Completely pitch black in color with a one finger dark brown head and average retention.
Aroma: Fudge, smokey ancho chiles, espresso, and some herbal/leathery notes really stand out. A lot going on here. The chiles are definitely more noticable than I expected and contribute, not only a little heat, but a nice smokey char flavor. I do get a little caramel and vanilla in the background as well but its not as prominent as the other notes.
Taste: The dark chocolate and cacao nib notes are far more prominent here than in the aroma. The vanilla provides a nice backing and really smooths out the bitterness with some sweet notes. The leather and herbal flavors really make their way toward the palate after the initial chocolate burst. They provide a much more rustic feel to what might seem like a chocolte bomb at first. Definitely some espresso and char in the finish with a touch of heat at the end to bring it all together. The chiles are not as big as the aroma, but they work well with to give a touch of heat and a good deal of smoke.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy. No carbonation problems here.
Overall, a well done and unique stout. At times the chocolate can be a bit much, but the rest id incredibly well balanced and interesting. If I had to pick a flaw it would be drinkability. Was a struggle to finish the last couple ounces in my glass. Definitely worth a try. 1,655 charactersGosox8787, Mar 23, 2011

Pours super dark (basically black) with a chocolate colored head. Nice lacing and coating left behind in the glass. Looks thick. 
Smelled of dark fruit, chocolate, vanilla, coffee and a hint of chili. Intriguing. 
This was a very unique tasting stout. Chocolate and roasted coffee are clearly present, but the additional ingredients really make this shine. Nice cinnamon and vanilla taste with a bite of chili heat in the finish. 
Thick, full bodied stout that thoroughly coats the mouth. Nice amount of carbonation.
Really enjoyed getting to try this beer, but was glad to have friends to share it with. Definitely couldn't have put this down alone due to how full and intense it is. 753 charactersejyoung, Mar 19, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle Pour. This beer is dark as can be. Oily, thick and resinous. Hunahpu is so thick it leaves my glass looking like a resin covered bong. The nose on this beer is as complex as the palate. Chocolate, char, vanilla, earthy peppers and alcohol hit the nose full force. The palate of this beer is immensely layered. I first get dark bitter chocolate that is quickly sweetened by the vanilla treatment and chocolatey malt character. Following that comes earthy smokey peppers that compliment the deep roastiness of the malts with slight heat to kick. The heavy viscosity and moussey carbonation combine for a luxurious and velvety mouthfeel. I enjoy my beer with food, hunahpu will make good company with spicy, savory and rich ethnic dishes. 742 charactersjewbrew, Mar 18, 2011

4.73/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.58oz pour from tap at Cigar City, yesterday at Hunahpu release.
Velvety, viscous, dark brown-black liquid, with what appears to be a nicely baked brownie on top, as the thickly carbonated head crowns this brew. 
The aroma is full of fudgy chocolate from freshly mixed chocolate batter, nicely balanced vanilla and coffee, and strong esters and alcohol at the nose which come out as the glass is emptied. There is a faint pepper presence that becomes more pronounced after first taste.
To start, let me explain that this was my first taste of Hunahpu, and my anticipation was all over the place. Ratings high, hype even higher. And while I enjoy stouts, my preference lies more with DIPAs. 
The hype was right on. This complex brew did not disappoint.
Smooth, bitterness, like semi-sweet chocolate, but balanced by the vanilla and the nicely placed peppers. Full, thick, body, pleasant tingling that starts on the tip of the tongue, begins to remind me of some lingering, resinous hops, then when the tingling spreads to the lips I remember the chiles. 
Great Imperial Stout. Complex, tasty, great use of the chiles; can sip this all day--alcohol well hidden. 
This is the elixir to get me through the rest of the winter. 1,223 charactersCaptCleveland, Mar 13, 2011

Taste - Caramel, Toffee, Coffee, Milk Chocolate, Malt. 
Thin front, Heavy mouth. After a few minutes, residual heat and spice from the peppers.
Overall: I understand the hype. This beer makes Southern Tier's Choklat and Creme Brulee seem like amateur brews. Probably couldn't drink more than 6oz in a session, though it is delicious. 598 charactersMichaelLynBryant, Mar 07, 2011

A: Deep, dark black in color. Fully opaque. Forms a nice finger or so of very dark brown head that has some decent retention, but leaves no lacing. 
S: The wonderful aroma of sweet dark roasted malts and the complex raisiny spiciness that comes from the dried peppers. 
T: An interesting and complex blend of flavors. Dark malts with a light sweetness in the background. Flavors of ancho pepper, cocoa, and raisin. Coffee to a less extent. There is a very faint heat from the peppers that reminds me of a Mexican hot chocolate. 
M: Heavy with a lower carbonation level leaves this one feeling smooth and pleasantly viscous in the mouth. 
D: A very complex sipper of an Imperial stout. Took this to a tasting and only had a glass of it for myself, but that was more than enough. 794 charactersFlorida9, Mar 01, 2011

Pours a jet black again with red around the edges similar to base beer Zhukov. Slightest of head dissipates quickly with a slight lacing running down glass. Wow do the chilles really come out when smelling this bad boy. Also got hints of vanilla and oak. Tasted very similar to smell with a almost too much going on for me with muddling of vanilla, peppers and roasted malts and spiciness. Creramy and rich, but almost to rich for me.

A good amount of cocoa on the tongue. The pepper melds nicely with the cocoa and roasted malts. The spice is a bit heavy on the nose but blends well on the tongue.

4.26/5  rDev -5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A truly impressive brew. Thanks, Mikesgroove, for this one.
Inky black with a gorgeous, creamy, coffee colored head which sticks and stays. Impressions of cherry (from the cinnamon and chocolate notes) and oak (from the vanilla and pepper tannins) blossom, the warm spice of the cinnamon and vanilla coming through most in the end. The body is as lush, soft, and full as any I've ever found, the beer hampered only by a ragged, lengthy, puckering bitterness. The roasted grains, aggressive hopping, and adjuncts add up to an overly bitter brew, even for my tastes. Despite this somewhat harsh and unpleasant finish, the lush body and intriguing complexities make this a superior brew. Hopefully they tone down the roasted barley and hops a touch to bring it fully into balance. A great beer just shy of transcendent. 817 characterserrantnight, Feb 26, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4750 of the 2010 vintage into a Birra del Borgo tulip. Gigantic thanks to Dan for sharing this one.
A: Looks like motor oil coming out of the bottle, and not just any motor oil - super thick, super black, super viscous motor oil. Even small splashes from the pour stain the sides of the glass a deep crimson, and once things settle out the beer is topped with a finger of the darkest red-brown head I've ever seen in my life. Incredibly intimidating, and absolutely gorgeous. I'd give this a 6 if I could - it's hands-down the most amazing-looking beer I've ever beheld.
S: Spicy chili pepper is up front, with a veritable olfactory assault of piquancy. Dark chocolate and vanilla bean back it up, but the chili really stands out - surprising considering that this is almost a year old. Excellent.
T: Less spicy than the nose, and thankfully so. The chocolate and vanilla are joined here by coffee and toffee, creating a melange of spicy, sweet, and bitter deliciousness. Tons of cacao, coffee, and craziness. I'm in stout heaven.
M: Viscous, syrupy, and well carbonated. Intense and wonderful.
D: The sheer hugeness of flavors, coupled with the high ABV, make this a struggle - but what an amazing struggle!
Notes: I'd only had small tastes of this beer before, and each time it blew me away. I wasn't prepared, though, for how truly spectacular this one was going to be. The appearance alone was worth the price of admission, and the flavors were simply to die for. I'll definitely be trading for a bottle or two of the next release. Otherworldly.

However the aroma was VERY sweet, like sugar and coffee and dark malts dipped in sugar and than encased in a shell of sugar. Taste was very sweet. It seems like their is a good beer under the sweetness but it really is hard to tell. Mouth feel is slick and sweet. Drink-ability is altered by the sweetness.

3.99/5  rDev -11.5%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Thirstybird for breaking this one out for our tasting. I've been wanting to try this beer for some time. This is by far, the best looking big stout I've ever seen. Pours an inky black with a dense, dark mocha-colored head tinged with a reddish-brown hue. Cap is so thick and dense that it is only pierced by tiny pinpricks. Thick sheets of lacing slide down the walls of the glass following each tilt. Nose reveals chocolate, spice and booze - it's all a bit much in my opinion and any subtlety is lost here. Taste is rich and chocolatey on a bold malty backbone. Spicy and sweet intermingles nicely, but gets to be a bit cloying after continued consumption. Finish is slightly burnt and bitter, which helps to cut the sweetness, but only marginally. Mouthfeel is exceptional - medium/heavy in consistency with a light carbonation and a pleasant creamy texture. I'm never quite sure of what to expect from a "spiced" stout; however, Hunahpu's makes it work. This is perhaps the biggest Stout I've had to date in terms of body, feel and complexity. That being said, a little goes a long way. It's extremely rich and the complex flavors get to be a little tough to handle over time. Personally, I think this beer would be better served in a 12oz. bottle rather than a 750ml. 1,287 charactersJwale73, Feb 20, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured into a CC snifter, this one is as black as it gets with a surprisingly dark cocoa head.
S: Rich cocoa, roasted malt, cinnamon, and a little vanilla. After it warms up I get a little honey and anise. At times it smells like a fudge brownie.
T: Again, truckloads of rich dark chocolate. Quite a bit of sweetness, but it's nicely countered by huge roasted and slightly smoky flavors. The chocolate's complimented by vanilla and a light woodyness, I would assume from cinnamon. Pepper adds more flavor than heat, but the spice does start to build for me after the first 4 oz. There's also a distinctive earthyness to this beer. The best comparison I can make for the flavor of Hunahpu's is dense chocolate cake with xocolatl bar melted over the top. Intense.
M: Body is very thick with low to medium carbonation. Overall, it has a very full mouthfeel, but the carbonation isn't as dialed in as some of the best examples of the style, which are more velvety. This is good, but a little more syrupy.
Hunahpu's is a huge, roasted cocoa beast. Really a fantastic beer with many layers and a great option for comparing flavor profiles at various temperatures. 1,164 charactersGeezLynn, Feb 17, 2011

A super dark black creamy head fades slowly with a thick syrupy heavy beer that coats the glass and has nice legs.
Nose is loaded with dark malts, roasty, dark chocolate, strong vanilla beans with a bit of a chili pepper under, some coffee, lots of dark chocolate, caramel, oatmeal, dark bitter scortched malts, just a ton of dark chocolate, coffee, and vanilla.
Taste brings lots of vanilla at first, light spices like a cinnamon, chili pepper, lots of chocolate, baker's choc, dark choc, creamy milk choc, vanilla again, dark malts, chewy oats, a nice mouth coating that sticks everywhere, with some nice bitter tastes, a slight fluffy and earthy hop character. All the flavors are blended well despite so many peaks of various flavors.
Mouth is super thick and luscious, creamy, with decent carbonation and touch of warming booze. 
Drink is good, not much of a booze feel for being 11.5% and how heavy it is, it still drinks decent, a big mouth coating that never fades takes away slightly, but for the style of beer that's what it should be. 1,175 charactersjlindros, Feb 14, 2011

A- Pours absolutely black with a one and a half finger dark brown/reddish hued head. The head is made up of nice, tightly knit, tiny bubbles. This beer literally stains the glass when swirled it is so dark. Excellent lacing and alcohol legs. Easily the darkest beer and darkest head I have ever seen. The best looking beer I have ever seen, as a matter of fact. For those of you who did not give this a 5 for appearance, I have no idea what you're thinking.
S- Brown sugar, molasses, some vanilla, cinnamon, and spiciness from the chiles and alcohol. Dark malts take a back seat. No astonishingly apparent chocolate smell here. Smells nice.
T- Cocoa nibs dominate this beer with an excellent chocolate flavor. The chiles are also apparent, but are kept in check. The chiles also bring a little tartness to the table. Not really picking up much of the other boat-load of ingredients in this beer though. The chocolate added to this beer is done in a very classy way, and is very enjoyable, unlike some beers I've had (cough, southern tier choklat, cough, southern tier mokah, cough, cough).
M- The thickest beer I have had in a long time, maybe the thickest ever. Literally like drinking a milkshake. Very heavy. The light tartness makes this feel slightly thinner on the back-end and during the swallow. Light carbonation, but just enough. Outstanding mouthfeel - easily one of the best I have ever had.
D- This beer has so much weight to it that splitting this with a friend is the way to go. I drank about 2/3's of the bottle and that was plenty even though this was an outstanding beer.
Overall, one of the best beers I've had in a while. Would have liked to see more complexity in the taste, though. Still, great stuff that I will definitely trade for again. 1,781 charactersTK5150, Feb 05, 2011

Appearance: Pours black as night with a dark brown head. The head goes away almost immediately and leaves some lacing. The beer is super viscous and clings to the side of the glass.
Smell: Initially I smell very sweet roast with hints of dark chocolate and dark fruit. After that I pick up the peppers as well as some alcohol.
Taste: Very sweet roast hits the tongue first. This is followed by dark chocolate, some chili pepper spice, cinnamon, and some dark fruit notes. The finish is roasty and sweet, the flavors blend together well.
Mouthfeel: This one just coats your mouth. Very thick and viscous with just the right amount of carbonation (mild). The finish is mildly dry.
Drinkability: I would have this one again and again. I'm super excited that I got to try this! I thought it was very well balanced. The only negative in my mind is that I didn't pick up much vanilla. That's just nitpicking and this is a phenomenal beer. 1,024 charactersoline73, Feb 05, 2011

Dark chocolate blends with dark roasted malt and a bit of espresso to start the sip. More chocolate continuously comes through as the sip progresses, with a darker and more bitter roasted malt to accompany it. A touch of chile and heat come through right at the end. The aftertaste is somewhat bitter and chocolaty.
Mouthfeel: Absolutely velvety smooth, with great depth of flavor. The body is extremely full, with lots of creamy carbonation. Lightly sticky sweet, but not overly so. 
Drinkability: This is pretty awesome, it definitely lived up to my expectations. Since we were drinking the 2010, the flavors and aromas had really blended together nicely. This created a very smooth transition between the different aspects of the flavor, but it also made some of them difficult to isolate or taste. I only got a very mild heat from the chiles, and I could not get any hint of cinnamon. Definitely looking forward to this year's release. 1,352 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 31, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5An amazing beer. 
A: Awesome black with huge lacing and dark brown head! 
S: Amazing. Oh wow, the charred malt base mizes so well with sweet and savory notes of chile, caramel, cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla bean and dark dried fruits. So awesome holy cow. 
T: Follows the smell with big burnt malt notes, hickory BBQ, cocoa, chile spice, vanilla bean, cinnamon bun, and fudge. Again, wicked roasty. Sweet man not too sweet, savory as well. Outstanding, theres hardly the words to describe. 
M: Nice feel, smooth as all get out and completely coating, everything a big stout should be. 
D: OUSTANDING beer, man it's incredibly easy to put back being so big. Ever time I get to try this, I am consistently blown away. 715 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 26, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Super excited to pop this bottle open. Had it for the first time last year during Philly Beer Week and was blown away. Bottle acquired via trade. 
Pour is awesome: Pours a jet black with a deep tan head that sticks around for the whole ride. Excitement.
The nose is fantastic. Complex spice flavors meld with the vanilla and chocolate notes. Exactly what I remembered.
The taste follows suit. The taste is initially cinnamon, then I can actually taste the chilies used in the beer, followed by the spiciness of the chilies and then finishing out with a bittersweet chocolate tone. 
Mouthfeel is fantastic too. Silky, thick and viscous. So good.
After about 4 oz I am finished with this beer just because it is so immense. The hype is well deserved. 753 charactershippityhops85, Jan 15, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I first had this beer at the 2010 Stogie's & Stouts party at the Dunedin Brewery in February.
Pours black with big thick dark tan head. Aromas of roasted malts, cocoa, and chocolate. Flavor is robust with thick dark malts, tons of chocolate, light cinnamon, light smoke, and very faint heat from chilis. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Not abrasive in any way. Flavors come together so well. This beer comes with tons of hype and it lived up to it. Just like the rest of the CCB brews I have had. 495 charactersJefe73, Jan 14, 2011
3.93/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Enjoyed during a tasting with tlay10 right after we tried Marshall Zhukov's, the base beer. If you didn't know, Hunahpu's is Zhukov's aged on Peruvian cocoa nibs, Ancho and Pasillo chiles, cinnamon and Madagascar vanilla beans. Poured from a bottle filled to the absolute brim into a snifter. 
Above creamy, inky blackness, a creamy one-finger head, mahogany-colored and the texture of pancake batter, recedes very slowly but steadily, becoming a thin yet lingering ring and a spatter of film, leaving jagged streaks of lace. 
More hoppiness in this nose than Zhukov. Along with cedar, the spicy peppers add an interesting vegetal character. Black molasses, light vanilla, oak and cinnamon, in that order. 
All the stuff it's aged on adds a different aspect to the flavor: you get some vegetal notes and a tiny bit of heat from the peppers, sweetness from the vanilla and increased chocolate tang from the cocoa nibs. Dark chocolate flavors and a bit of espresso linger amidst the mildly bittersweet finish. Sweet vanilla emerges more as it warms. Wonderfully complex -- every time I sip, something new emerges. This last sip I got cinnamon, the time before it was vanilla. It reminds me almost of dulce le leche. 
The mouthfeel is very similar to Zhukov's, though just a shade thinner. Medium, lightly fizzy carbonation in an incredibly creamy and smooth body, and again, absolutely no noticeable alcohol. 
I like the complexity here. In small quantities, Hunahpu is great. Zhukov's is more drinkable, however. 1,516 charactersPhelps, Jan 14, 2011

A - Pours a black, tar like color. Heavy, viscous pour that forms a rich, dark brown head about 1 finger thick. Absolutely incredible color ont his head; hot chocolate like in color. The head slowly recedes to a collar ofthe same color. This might be the best pour from a big stout I've ever come across.
S - Wow. Big roasted malts and extremely high quality dark cacao up front. Some slight coffee notes as well as the spices start to come out. The chilies and cinnamon mix extremely well and are very very well integrated. 
T - The cacao takes the stage here along with the roasted malts and the chilies. The chilies and cinnamon are so wel integrated that it adds so nicely to the overall profile. Reminds me of the Oaxaca Exotic Candy Bar from Vosges melted down with alcohol added. Some sweet vanilla notes come at the end of the profile. Spices and chilies become more apparent as it warms. EXTREMELY complex and tasty flavors.
M - Thick, silky, velvet, all the adjectives I could want to describe the mouthfeel of an RIS. Very slight carbonation and just a touch of alcohol on the end. Really exceptional.
D - For such a big thick stout with a ton of very bold flavors and a high ABV, this one was incredibly easy to drink. No cloying sweetness and no overwhelming chilie presence. Very, very nicely done! 1,411 charactersKAP1356, Jan 14, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Shared at a tasting by Dreadnaught33. Thanks man!
Very Black, viscous fluid poured into a small snifter. No light permeates this. The simple head that formed was very dark tan. The color of the head is interesting to me as it can very wildly on beers that are seeming similar in fluid color. Hunahpu's has one of the darker caps I have ever seen. 
The aroma is quite impressive and complex. I get a combination of big roasty notes, vanilla, citrus peel, and some spiciness against a slightly caramel malt character. 
A sip reveals even more complexity with varying layers of malty flavor. Slight caramel, big dark chocolate, and some roast all present themselves cleanly in the flavor. Notes of vanilla creep through as well. A slight back-throat burning occurs with the swallow; kind of as a signature or brand to let you know you are drinking something special. Amazing beer. Medium dry finish makes this beer a pleasure to drink.
The mouthfeel is adequately dextrinous making for full-bodied but with an effervescent carbonation that keeps it from being heavy. I really love that chili burning sensation in the back end!
The drinkability is great as the beer displays great levels of flavor without cloying sweetness. Medium dry finish keeps you wanting more. This is a great sipping beer and would work well by the fire on a cold night as a digestif or paired with a dark chocolate torte.
This is one of THE best big stouts I've ever had and compares favorably with Darkness, Dark Lord, and KtG. It has it's own signature about it, but very interesting nonetheless. 1,575 charactersahalloin, Jan 13, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Sentz for being kind and generous enough to part with a bottle. After cellaring for 5 months discovered cap was slightly lifted and there was stickiness running down the side. But welcome hiss when popped - beer so thick it must have sealed again. Poured into a wine glass, enjoyed chilled on a winter porch and let it warm throughout the evening. 
(A) Dark, pitch black. Pours thick as rich hot chocolate - color too. Rich deep reddish-brown head. Keep thinking gourmet hot chocolate.
(S) Dark chocolate, coffee nose. Wisp of fresh, spicy chili pepper.
(T) Wow wow wow. Rich, high quality, high % cacao. Spice more prevalent as warms. Coffee again. Slight cinnamon.
(M) Thick, silky, pure indulgence. Coats mouth and tongue. Like letting piece of chocolate melt on your tongue with a spicy kick. But not cloying, and still slightly prickly carbonation on tongue.
(D) Tremendous dessert beer to be split with a friend or brother-in-law, but when he doesn't show up even better as an all night sipper. 1,019 charactersMess, Jan 09, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle shared with StayWhatYouAre2 during our annual rare beer tasting. Poured into a Bruery snifter.
A: Thick, syrupy, nearly black pour produces a medium one finger mocha head that makes the mouth water. Decent head retention with some of the most impressive lacing I've seen, and long legs. Couldn't get much better than this. 
S: Smokey with bitter dark chocolate up front, along with vanilla, bacon, and slight anise, coffee, hops and booze. I don't pick up any peppers or chili, but am not disappointed what is present in the nose. 
T: The taste matches the smell quite well. Starts with dark chocolate and toffee, greeted by a smokiness and slight hoppiness, finishing with a bits of coffee, hops, and a mild booze burn. Still no ancho or pasilla chilies, but a bit of a chili burn at the back of the throat the more you drink and the more it warms. Would have liked just a bit more of the chili bite, but the lack thereof doesn't negatively effect the quality. 
M: Coating and chewy; probably as close to chocolate syrup as a beer could come. Very mild carbonation, which adds to the viscosity, yet keeps it slightly lively on the palate. Slight booze burn on the back end.
D: Mildly drinkable, at best. This is a tough one to put down. Although this bottle was shared, it wasn't finished in one evening. Maybe we're wimps, but this is a definite sipper and great for sharing with at least two people. Overall Hunahpu's really delivers ... in appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel. I loved it! 1,508 charactersMississipping, Jan 07, 2011

The 1st time, i was down at the brewery in Tampa, bought a bottle but the bottle broke before I was able to get it home and did not have time to return to the brewery. 4 months later I was back in Florida on business and was at Tryst in Delray beach and they had it on the menu
Poured a Black, turbid body with a thin, bubbly, dark tan head, beautiful. Its nose was a roasted, dark chocolate with spices in the front. Taste was of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla and then finished with a spicy aftertaste from the chili's that hit you in the back of the throat. Great mouthfeel, carbonation was right and went down smooth. Pretty easy drinking despite the heat from the chili's. Overall a wordclass beer, that must be had. 757 charactersbonbini26, Dec 30, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Cheers, pwoods. Thanks for sharing this bottle with me. 
The beer pours exceptionally dark brown, practically black. It is fully opaque, and it's so dark that the head is even dark - a deep chocolate milk brown with a ruby tinge. It starts as a tight, 1/2 finger skim, and it fades to a light ring around the walls of the glass, leaving slippery lace sliding down back into the liquid quickly. The receding lace reveals a wash of alcohol in its wake. 
The first hit is a whiff of cherry Robitussin. It fades softly into a nice blend of dry, crunchy, roasty coffee and warm, sweet vanilla bean. 
Forward flavors of roasted coffee and cacao dominate across the palate. It takes some warming and repeat sips to start revealing the other flavors in this bold beer. I definitely get the sweetness of the vanilla, but the chiles don't come across as anything much more than an aftertaste. There's a persistent cherry-like sweet-tartness. The feel overall is really nice. The carbonation is strong enough to really distribute the flavors, and it finishes with a great, chewy creaminess, leaving a sticky palate-coating film behind. 
Moderately drinkable at best. A tasty style with a twist. 1,187 characterskels, Dec 30, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance:
As we popped the cap on this treat there was a generous amount of carbonation gasses that hissed from the neck of the bottle. On the pour this is black as midnight with a two finger thick dark chocolate colored head that floated gracefully on top of the syrupy liquid. When I hold my glass up to the light there is absolutly nothing shining through and no haze or yeast chunks. As I give a quick swirl I notice that this is very very thick and seems to "stain" the walls a deep blood red and creep very slowly.
Smell:
Loads of charred fiery ash, meaty BBQ sauce, pipe tobacco, roast and coffee. Slight undertones of vanilla and plums round of the middle. There is some hop presence but not much because its faded out by all the intense dark flavors going on here.
Taste:
Very delicious! Like a cold cup of espresso and smoking a fine cigar. (no pun intended) This is very full in body with some underlying spiciness like pepper that I am really enjoying. Chocolate, heat alcohol, and thick molasses make it all come together. 
Drinkability:
Another slow sipper RIS, but it needs to be because there is a lot of complexity going on. One of CCB finest beers in my opinion and for the 11% ABV drinks very smooth. It will be fun to see how this develops over the years. 1,284 charactersBmoyer0301, Dec 29, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours very dark brown, almost black. Completely opaque allowing no highlights. Head is a dense reddish-tan ring.
Aroma is smokey charred dark grain. There is an underlying oatmeal sweetness. Bourbon soaked dark fruit, hints of oak, and smoked meat. 
Taste is rich and bold. Sweet with hot alcohol up front. The bourbon soaked dark fruit comes on strong. Then an unusual aromatic spice takes over. Bitter dark chocolate matched with a peppery sting. Rich, chewy tobacco that just lingers forever. Finishes with a woody cedar aspect that is very dry.
Mouthfeel is full and creamy. Dense and viscous, but not oily.
A very flavorful and intense imperial stout. There are many subtle flavors in every sip. A must try. 716 charactersBlakaeris, Dec 28, 2010

Wow the flavor is huge and complex. Big dark chocolaty malts along with tons of spices and burnt blackness. there is a pretty nice mixture between the dark chocolate, a nice bitterness and the spices, just a hint of the chili's are evident in the finish.

Pours black with a small but long-lasting dark tan/reddish head. Super pretty head. Aroma of bitter chocolate, lots of cocoa, tons of graham cracker (including some cinnamon), roasted malt, toffee, vanilla, oak. Flavor is quite chocolatey up front with a definite peppery spice note and a chalky, chocolatey finish. Graham cracker still present but less so. As I continue to drink, the pepper/chile spiciness really starts to heat up my mouth. This is one of the most chocolatey beers I've ever had. One of the most unique and well crafted imperial stouts out there. I'm proud to award this beer my first ever 5.0. 685 charactersLilBeerDoctor, Dec 23, 2010

 A deep fudge brown color with creamy tan cap, no light passes through. The retention is good and lace sticks well, very small bead. This is an attractive beer to say the least. The smell is multidimensional, lots of creamy malt, caramel, cocoa and spice which adds a mild vanilla bean note with hints of alcohol in the aroma. The feel is light spice, full body with moderately carbonated presence, the spice notes come forward in the middle and the finish is semi-sweet. 
 The taste of this is broad, lots of complex spice and malt qualities at play here. The taste of the dark malt is slightly cococa enhanced and seems nutty,but that my just be the earthy vanilla presence. The slight spice distracts from the alcohol in the flavor and gives a nice complimentary accent to the caramel malt flavor and roasted notes round out the big stout. The spicing really adds to this beer, it feels like one I would want to enjoy in the winter or the holidays, lots of festive flavors in the mix which work so well with the base stout. The pepper is mild but this adds to the drinkability for me with the nutty earthy and cinnamon quality making for a unique brew and highly drinkable stout. 1,331 charactersSlatetank, Dec 14, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750ml bottle into my Dogfish snifter. It poured pitch black in color with a very thick looking body to it. The head foamed up and nearly filled the top inch and half of the glass. The head was a very nice looking deep brown, almost chocolaty in color. It stuck around too and left some very nice lacing. The head definitely gives this some bonus points on appearance, I loved the color if it. 
The chili peppers are the first thing that stand out to me in the aroma. They give it a very flavorful roasted pepper like quality to it without becoming hot or spicy. The sweeter chocolate and mild vanilla seem to smooth it out pretty nicely. It has a good amount of bitter, roasted malt, coffee flavors to it as well. 
The taste really shows the roasted pepper like flavor to it, which give it just a bit of spice. It has lots of chocolate coming through as well. The vanilla is there but isn't a strong presence. Towards the finish more of the roasted malt, coffee, bitter flavors come through. Very nice range of flavors overall. 
The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with carbonation being on the lower side. Drinkability is pretty good, I liked the flavors a lot actually. It felt pretty well balanced between sweet and roasty flavors and the peppers and vanilla definitely added some nice depth. Very flavorful and good beer overall. 1,351 charactersbillab914, Dec 11, 2010

My first and only encounter with Hunahpu's came at the Captain Lawrence Rosso e Marrone release. That day I almost died from the cold. But the beer warmed me and saved our lives.
As I shivered around the tasting table I poured some Hunahpu's into my tasting glass.
A: Pours a thick, viscous dark black. Black as tar. Black as Dark Lord. Nice brown mocha head. This is the thickest RIS I have seen in a while. Second only to Dark Lord.
S: Nice bitter molasses, bitter bakers chocolate, burnt roast, and burnt chocolate covered raisins. More heavy on the roast and chocolate qualities than the fruit, however. Very roasty with tons of burnt elements. Some burnt firewood as well.
T: Thick, creamy, and delicious. Tons of burnt ash, burnt bakers chocolate, chocolate covered raisins and cherry, burnt toffee. If you like very roasty stouts, this is for you.
M: Incredibly thick and syrupy. Second thickest beer I have had second only to Dark Lord. The low carbonation augments the thickness.
Overall, a solid RIS. Not as well balanced as Abyss or BA Blackout, but still a very solid offering. 1,152 characterstreyrab, Dec 10, 2010

A - One finger dark head overlying a black as night brew. Great head retention and lacing. There are multiple shades of brown that layer on top of each other within the head itself. Very nice. 
S - Pickled jalapeno peppers, stale vinegar, and cinnamon. This is literally the worst smelling beer I have ever smelled. Gross. 
T - Better than the smell, but still really bizarre and poorly melded together. Bitter roasts and dark chocolate up front, with harsh chiles and sourness in the finish. 
M - Very nice. Rich and thick - just as a heavy, high ABV stout should be. Not much carbonation, nearly perfect to my liking. 
D - Not a whole lot here. The overpowering aroma and taste of the jalepenos/chiles leaves a lot to be desired in this beer. And it's a shame too - without the addition of such random, poorly chosen ingredients, such as the chiles, this would make a truly excellent stout. If this were available on tap at the Map Room or any other Chicago beer bar, I would certainly not order it, nor would I ever seek out another bottle. 1,072 charactersairohead2001, Dec 09, 2010

My wife and I have been saving this one for a special occasion so we opened it with 6 friends after a Thai dinner outing for her birthday. This was an excellent night cap, and it was enjoyed by all, even a few skeptics.
Appearance is dark expresso brown/black with a full bodied pour and dark frothy chocolate milk colored cap.
Smells of dark malts, bold expresso, chili spice and a nice solid waft of booze.
Taste is complex and impressive, all the ingredients are evident and respectably balanced. Roasty malts, expresso notes, chili spice reminds me of red hots and fine dark chocolate. The abv is evident but works to keep your pace sipping to slowly appreciatte this complex brew.
Mouthfeel is full body as it should be. 791 charactersunclejimbay, Dec 07, 2010

Huge thanks to Gtreid for this whale carcass!
'Twas indeed a tragic prelude to the brewing, when this bottle flung itself from the table, shattering its world, leaving an expanding sea of dark, roasty blood. We salvaged what we could from the wreckage, and the impression gotten therefrom is below. Full disclosure, home slices.
It pours a straight deathly dark brown topped by what seems to be a finger of brown foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, blackened pretzels, molasses, maple syrup, oak, vanilla, cocoa, and whiskey. The taste holds notes of heavy roasted malts, molasses, chocolate, sweet peppers, soy sauce, vanilla, and brown sugar. The body is a hefty medium, with a light carbonation and a kinda syrupy feel. Overall, this seemed a bit of a disappointment. A lot of dark, sweet, and spicy tones, but they don't really seem to truly mesh together properly. Honestly, though, because of the circumstances, this guy held up fairly well. I plan on trying to acquire a new bottle, though, so that we can determine how this ought to be. Until then, though, these were my impressions: take them as you wish.
Update (2/26/11):
Thanks to the generosity of florida9, I've been able to give this giant another chance. The taste comes up much cleaner, tastier, with the soy sauce now thankfully gone and the peppers coming in nice and subtly near the end. Everything comes through nicely this time, much more well-blended and neat. I'm glad I was able to try this as it was intended to be consumed, as it is definitely better than the literal wreck that the above bottle was. The scores have thus been appropriately adjusted. 1,658 charactersTMoney2591, Nov 14, 2010

This beer pours a a very viscous dark matter with a brown foam on the surface. The smell is very much a bourbon, coffee and soy sauce smell. Some serious chocolate smell as well. The taste is rather nice and complex. The flavors are smoke, oak, bourbon, bit of salt and rum. This is odd on the tongue, hard to explain. Not bad. The drinkability is very nice. Overall pleasant and a shame most of it hit the floor.
I was able to re-review this beer with the assistance of Florida9
2/26/11
Many of the same flavors came though, but when there was actually carbonation there was actually a greater depth to all of the flavors. There was ancho chiles in the background of the flavor and it was a damn fine beer. The sweet peppery flavor was really nice. So I'm bumping up the rating accordingly to compensate for what I now believe is a fair shake of this beer. 997 charactersVdubb86, Nov 13, 2010

The middle and end remind me of vanilla and I got the spiciness at the end. I'm going to guess that was the cinnamon. It wasn't as spicy as I was thinking it would be from the chiles. 
M: Like I had said, more carbonation than I was used to but it was really good full bodied beer.
D: A sipper and glad it was shared. On top of being 11.5%, the robustness of the flavor could get overwhelming but an excellent beer regardless, I just would try drinking a ton of it. 876 charactersBTPete, Nov 01, 2010
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Been savin this bad boy since the first week it came out. Opened today 10/26/10. Poured this into my favorite Westmalle chalice. The bottle poured out a thick creamy consistent black brew with a light choclate head that lingered for a few minutes. I could smell the beer as it sat in my glass, awaking itself from its hibernation. The smell was of the best chocolate you have smelled in your enitre life, but! it was balanced with some bright bitterness and spice like none other. The flavor was tantilizing. My mouth salavated after the first sip. I went right back in for a second. Beer porn at its finest. The flavor was of chocolate molten lava cake with spices and heat from the ancho chilis. I was in heaven. ITs too bad they didn't brew more of this. This is easily the best beer on the market, and it would be the #1 rated beer on BA too. My suggestions, drop black tuesday and come down to Florida for the release of this champion. 940 charactersbernardus1212, Oct 28, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I recieved this beer from a couple BA's. Mike and Kevin are both top notch guys in my book. Thanks so much for this epic brew.
Poured from a bottle into a duvel tulip.
A: Straight out of the bottle I knew this one was special. Thick black used motor oil would be the best description I can give. God damn it's thick! Two fingers of dark chocolate head cascade for a brief moment then set up. Slowly fading away to leave tiny fleck of lace around the glass.
S: Spicy chocolate mixed with coffee, cinnamon, molasses, smoked malt and a slightly bitter hop profile. No booze to be found. Smells like a winner.
T: Wow there is a lot going on in my first sip. The heat of the peppers is felt right away but not to hot. Then the cinnamon comes in with vanilla, coffee, dark chocolate and camp fire to follow. I've had a taste of this from another bottle and it had nowhere near the complexity of this one. Thankfully my bottle was balanced. I detect almost zero alcohol burn at all. 
M: Duh! Full thick chewy body. Clings to the glass like heavy cutting oil. You could drink this beer with a spoon.
D: Overall a wonderful Double stout. Super complex yet approachable. The viscosity would be the only thing that might hinder it's drinkability in my opinion. 1,255 charactersbeerwolf77, Oct 28, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4750mL bottle poured into a snifter. Huge thanks to Beerwolf77 for cracking open this one!
(A)- Pours like motor oil thick. Pitch black color that produced a great brown head with good retention. Some minimal lacing. Not bad for a 11.5% ABV; was expecting no foam at all. 
(S)- Some heat to it. Bits of chili pepper, but very subtle. Supplemented well with dark cocoa and a hint of cinnamon-like spice. Good roasted qualities with a light creamy vanilla at the end. 
(T)- Very similar to the smell. Very rich with a good roastedness. Chocolate and creamy vanilla with an interesting cinnamon spice. Turns more caramel-like as it warms.
(M)- A good carbonation level. Very rich, but smoother than expected. Really rather decadent. There is some boozy warmth on this, but it works. Minimal bitterness. Has a rather nice mouthfeel despite its strength, ABV, and ridiculous thickness.
(D)- Despite its already mentioned richness/strength/ABV, this is really quite nice. Its a sipper no doubt, but one that I can see myself enjoying over the course of a few hours if I had a bottle to myself. Enjoyed every sip. This could age indefinitely probably. 1,148 characterssweemzander, Oct 25, 2010

Thanks to Beerwolf77 for cracking open another top 100!
A - This is probably the darkest beer I've ever poured. It's got absolutely no highlights in it at all. A tall chocolate-brown head is dense and firm after a little beautiful cascading. No lace but a swirl coats the glass in this motor-oil brew.
S - Dry cocoa powder and a mild but present chili powder in the nose right off the bat. It reminds me of some chili chocolate I had not too long ago actually. Tons of bittersweet chocolate with a rich chocolate roasted malt. Vanilla is very, very mild. Interesting, different, good.
T - Rich chocolate roasted malts and notes of cold coffee with cinnamon and chili mixing together. Lots of dry cocoa in there, it's a full-flavored beer that's a little all over the place but good regardless.
M - This is as full-bodied as they come, Hunahpu's is thick and smooth with a heavily roasted finish but a well-balanced sweet and acrid bitter feel. A teeny hint of warm alcohol creeps up on the finish.
D - Despite this beer's viscosity, it's actually quite drinkable. It's a bottle to be split without question, but still a great double stout! 1,224 charactersBeerFMAndy, Oct 22, 2010

Pours a ridiculously nice, super dark brown and topped with a red tinted mocha head. Smells of subltey sweet chocolate and malt. Flavor is dynamic. Starts with a sweet subtle cinnamon and then moves toward milk chocolate. Finish is dark chocolate and bitter in a good way. Mouthfeel is lusciously smooth and creamy. An altogether phenomenal beer that embodies everything I want in a stout. WOW!
EDIT: Had again last night (since this review have had most highly regarded stouts out there) and it is so f'ing phenomenal I had to give it a better review. 589 charactersGoGriz, Oct 17, 2010

A - Black, large brown head & great lacing
S - Cinnamon, dried chili peppers, dark chocolate, and raisins
T - A spicy blend of dried cayenne, cinnamon, and dark fruits up front. Loads of coffee come next, with vanilla and dark chocolate joining the party as well. The end is bitter roasted espresso and piny hops. Amazingly complex, incredibly delicious stout. In my top 5 for the style for sure.
M - Ultra-smooth/creamy and pretty thick. Very good.

Nice dark brown head that lasted a few seconds and disappeared, but left some nice lacing behind. Aroma of loads of roasted malts, chocolate, sweet vanilla, light cinnamon, more spiciness. Flavor is sweet, vanilla upfront, hard roasted malts, lots of bitter chocolate and milk chocolate, a hint of cinnamon, slight peppery burn on the tongue, roasted bitter finish. Full bodied, prickly but smooth and fat mouthfeel. One of the most unique Imperial stouts I've ever tried. 511 charactershophead247, Oct 12, 2010

A - This pours out about as thick and black as I've ever seen. A thick 2 plus finger dark mocha head forms and slowly settles into a layer of mocha foam and lots of lacing.
S - This smells interesting, a subtle smokiness, cocoa, vanilla, roasted malts, and spicy chiles. Smells of a stout.
T - Taste is similar to the nose. Starts with a bit a sweet chocolaty goodness, into a bitter roasted malt/coffee backed by some vanilla and cinnamon notes, and finishes with a touch of spicy chiles.
M - This feels medium bodied but really creamy and smooth, slightly hot from the chiles. Carbonation is low which compliments the beer nicely.
D - A sipper for sure. This is a heavy stout with many different layers. But very good, and worth seeking out multiple bottles for cellaring. 853 characterskk73, Oct 10, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml capped bottle into a tulip glass. Thanks go to Jw347 for this in a recent trade.
Pours as black as an oil slick out of the bottle, topped with a rigid finger of rich chocolate colored head that also has some burnt reddish hues going on with it as well. This retains with a creamy ¼ finger, with each sip of this leaving back rich lacing and brown gooey oils that slowly ooze back down the sides of the glass. The aroma is just LUSH in the nose, with notes of chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, burnt roast, dark fruit, and a spicy mix of cinnamon and chilies, which add an extra zesty layer of complexity in the nose. Underlying alcohol warmth gives this a nice full thickness in the nostrils. Not much more I can say about this guy. This is complex as hell. Lots going on...
The taste equally full and complex, with chocolate roast, toffee, and vanilla flavors all spreading out and drenching the mouth with a tangy and dark sweetness. The spiciness of the cinnamon hangs on the edges and pulls together in the back, where it lingers with just the slightest sense of those spicy chilies. The finish is just drenched with a mix of sweetness, earthy dark fruit, roast, bitterness, and those aforementioned leftover spices. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with a creamy thickness and rich viscosity to the carbonation, which keeps this silky across the palate. Beyond the beefiness of the body, the only sense of the ABV that I'm getting is some light warmth in the finish. The alcohol is just beautifully hidden here. 
Wow. To say that there is a lot going on here would be an understatement but none of the flavors ran over each and other and all seemed to wait their turn to shine as you work your way through the profile. That's mostly probably a compliment to the well balanced base of the Marshall Zhukov being able to broadcast itself while still supporting all of the extra flavors that were added here. Just impeccable drinkibility for a Stout this size as well, as despite the onslaught of different characters being at work and the high ABV, I never felt palate fatigue in the slightest as I worked through the bottle. This one lived up the hype. Just a tremendously complex, interesting, and drinkable Imperial Stout. 2,234 charactersKegatron, Oct 07, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The mighty Hunahpu has brewed up an Imperial Stout. Despite chronology and historical sense, Hunahpu has drawn from Marshal Zhukov's battle plans. A big thanks goes out to belgbeerdrinker and Masterski for letting me research how the Hun has modified the great Soviet general's strategy. 
From a 750ml bottle into a snifter. 
Vintage: 2010 
APPEARANCE: A thick, dense, black pour produces a two finger, tight, dark mocha colored head after a wonderful cascading effect that looks stunning. Head retains really well and slowly fades to a good full cap. Jet black body and minimal carbonation evident. A fuller wisp and ring remain, showing some beautiful swirl patters after each sip, and leaves some falling dots of lace down the glass. Looks wonderful. 
SMELL: Roasted malts, molasses, dark pure chocolate and burnt espresso. Hints of vanilla make its way through, as do the chilies, with a good dose of cinnamon as well. A wonderful nose, but needs to be slightly bolder for a perfect score. 
TASTE: Roasted malts, molasses again, and dark, pure chocolate up front. Some toffee sweetness through the middle into a bitter coffee, espresso and chocolate finish with a slight touch of vanilla for good measure. A nice underscore of spicy chilies ride the whole way from start to finish, as does a dose of cinnamon flavor as well. Very well put together. A big, bold aftertaste full of bitter coffee and chocolate, as well as sweet toffee and molasses, cinnamon and some spicy chilies. Bold flavors and very well balanced all around. Just great. 
PALATE: Medium-full body, oily, with medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a slightly oily and mouth-coating finish. Nice here as well, though I think I'd prefer somewhere between the Hun and the Marshal in terms of carbonation levels for an Imperial Stout. 
OVERALL: Just awesome and well worth the hype. It is obvious that the Marshal is the driving force behind the offensive, but the Hun has definitely added his twist to the battle plans. The addition of vanilla and chilies works great on top of the Marshal's foundation, blending unbelievably well with the base flavors. I'm very glad I was able to try this highly acclaimed brew, and it was even more special to be able to try it with the Marshal so fresh in my mind. This is one I hope to have again sometime in the future. Thanks for the trade gents. Highly recommended. 2,405 charactersJeffo, Oct 05, 2010

Pours with a dark deep brown head.. the brew is the expected black with good retention and lace... thick on later pours.
Aromas are all over the place with dark chocolate and lite vanilla.. bits of char and some background chili aroma.
Flavor begins with chili spiked melted dark Hersheys.. espresso and black malts.. something that I can only derive as cinnamon (minor).. dark dried fruits and leather.. some tobacco shows with the sweet warmth... The chilis are about right for me.. I could even stand and enjoy some more.. Digging this one for sure... Pretty thick body and a lighter than expected carbonation... Very nice.

Smells a lot like cacao. Also roasted grains and bittersweet chocolate. I don't get much of the chillies in the nose.
Tastes a LOT like it smells. Rich bitter dark chocolate and dark roasted grains. There is a little spiciness mid-palate. On the back end there is a little bitter pine flavor. 
Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Some carbonation manages to cut through the thick liquid which is nice.
Overall, great stuff here. I didn't think this would live up to the hype for me but it is really really good and I am a fan of well-done imperial stouts. I just wish it wasn't in such a big expensive bottle.

A: Poured the consistency of motor oil, jet black body with dark brownish-red head, nicely carbonated 
S: Tons of coca nibs on the nose, followed by vanilla and ending with hints of cherry
T: Like drinking a melted 98% cacao choclate bar. Lots of chocolate through out, with spikes of cinnamon and ending with coffee. I was hoping for more heat from the ancho and pasilla peppers, but possibly do to aging, most of the heat had faded.
MF: The chocolate bar analogy continues, super thick and chewy, had the feel of melted chocolate.
D: Hides the ABV very well, a truly solid stout

4.68/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Beautiful black heat with a dark brown head. This is how we celebrate a 70+ hour work week with breakfast. 
The bottle was filled all the way to the top and was leaking a bit, but no issues with carbonation. Heavy chocolate and alcohol on the nose, slight spiciness, very light vanilla fingertips waving in the background. Thick, creamy chocolate, and the cinnamon comes out here, the vanilla still in the background, alcohol creeping. 
The spiciness is there, lingers in the top of my mouth, near the back, like a spider biding its time. Very rich, very intriguing. I'm glad it was leaking a little, I wouldn't've opened this bottle for a while otherwise. 
If you like spicy scrambles for breakfast, this is the perfect companion. 731 charactersdragonWhale, Sep 22, 2010

4.46/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Opened in honor of opening day of the Packer football season. This beer pours like a black hole...the deepest darkest, richest black you can imagine with a dark brown molasses head. You'd swear it's sucking in the light around it as absolute zero light shows through..even on the edges. Gorgeous. Hints of chocolate, cinnamon...and the vaguest hints of vanilla in the aroma. Tastes like more of the same. Bitter chocolate, smoke, cinnamon, leather, tobacco, molasses, fig, burnt sugar and vanilla give it a super complex taste. Mouthfeel is superb...a good carbonated coating that feels good in the mouth and great going down the throat. Haven't picked up on the chili's a whole lot, but there is a vague heat in my throat. Haven't decided if it's the warming effect of the alcohol or the chili's making their presence felt in a subtle way. Drinkability would perfect if not for the ABV. I could drink this all day...get trashed....sleep....get up and drink it some more.
Glad I was able to trade for this one...well worth it. Excellent job Cigar City. 1,052 charactersEliteDigger, Sep 12, 2010

Aroma is of coffee, roasted malts, chocolate malt, maybe some spiciness and some alcohol aroma. Taste is dominated by coffee, roasted malts and chocolate. Not picking up too much vanilla or chili, I assume those flavors are in the background, balancing everything out. Mouth is coated with flavor, maybe a touch chalky. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink for 11.5%, silly. Pretty amazing in the Florida summer, can't wait to have one in the winter. 573 charactersKickbacksSteve, Sep 12, 2010

A: This beer has the darkest head I have seen. I would describe the head as dirt brown. Nice retention and nice lacing. The beer itself is black.
S: I thought this smelled like a candy cane dipped in salsa, plus a little bit of ethanol. Not exactly what I consider pleasant.
T: Some sourness up front and then a lot of the chile at the finish. Some cinnamon and chocolate in there as well, but not as noticeable. I recently had the bourbon county stout with ancho chiles and thought that it had a similar profile to this beer, but found the bourbon county to be much more rounded, and interesting.
M: Nice viscosity, but a bit overcarbonated for my liking.
D. Fine. I enjoyed trying this beer, but would not search it out again. 781 charactersglazeman, Sep 09, 2010

Pours a dark and opaque black, no light gets through, medium sized dark brown head forms, one of the darkest heads I've ever seen, settles down to a medium size ring, lots of lace chunks stick, with some spots.
Smell is neat, big chocolate and vanilla notes, brown sugar, peppery spice, caramel, toast, coffee, oaky, some alcohol, cinnamon comes through, really nice.
Taste is similar, super super roasty up front, fresh coffee beans, cocoa nib chocolate character, toffee, cinnamon and sugar, lightly peppery, vanillla, pretty intense flavours going on in this one, caramelized sugar in the finish, almost burnt, neat, with some alcohol.
Mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, a bit of warmth and some spice going down, but very drinkable. A nice beer and kickass idea! I've been inspired. Thanks Greg!! 903 charactersViggo, Sep 09, 2010

4.3/5  rDev -4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle from PALMEJ1 (extra) - you, sir, are good people.
It was my intent to celler this once it showed up unannounced but that was not in the cards.
This beer pours very well. the CCB folks filled this one to the brim and there was a nice amount of carbonation in the pour with a dark tan head that stays.
Smell is beautiful, but largly dominated by the chocolate/malts. However, the aroma was so nice (and strong) that my wife noted how good it smelled. She then got a glass poured for her and 'enjoyed it'. She tried another stout at the same time and said it 'tasted like water' in comparison to this.
The taste is just good. It is so strongly dominated by the chocolate, and specifically that slightly acrid bite of dark chocolate, that even the malt was hidden underneath to a degree. 
The mouthfeel is excellent. Though the pour suggests that it will by syrupy(sp?), this has a nicely full feel that is benifitted by good carbonation.
Despite this being, in my opinion, underaged (the chocolate really dominated the other flavors,) it was a rare brew that my wife and I both enjoyed and which I am hopefull to reacquire to age for a bit.

4.33/5  rDev -4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5700th review! Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass. No dating info but this is from the release earlier this year so a bit of age on it. Was jet black in color even against the light. I gave it a good pour to stir up the aroma so it had a large dark brown head that slowly whittled down to a good collar and thin film fed by the etching. Thick sheeting the quickly at first then slowly slides back into the glass leaving some spots. 
The aroma is of many different aromas and excellent. Alongside the typical stout aromas are a big dose of chiles and cinnamon along with cacao and chocolate. Also get a good dose of vanilla and alcohol. Only complaint was that the alcohol and vanilla was a bit too prevalent and distracted from the other great aromas. The taste was also excellent and had plenty of dark fruit sweet balanced with the cacao, chiles and vanilla. Again, the only flaw was the amount alcohol and vanilla in the taste. Still very good and one of the best stouts I've had. Mouthfeel was rich and chewy with good carbonation and aftertaste.
Overall, an excellent stout that is worthy of the praise. Highly recommend if you can find this rare gem. Great for sharing. My first, and won't be last, Cigar City beer. Can't wait to visit it next spring during my FL trip. Not avail here so acquired thru a trade. Rotation - considering how hard it was to get this one, I doubt I've ever really have another but I'd grab one in a heartbeat if I could. [O;Y] 1,472 charactersTexIndy, Aug 19, 2010

750ml bottle. sampled aug 10/2010.
pours black and opaque with the darkest brown head i've ever seen. the small very fine head drops fairly fast and leaves spotty lace as it falls.
aroma is great. dark and milk chocolate. light cinnamon spice. a nice deep smell gives you just a hint of prickly heat on the back end. hint of alcohol. whole wheat bread and biscuit. bit of citrusy west coast hops.
taste is good. dark and bittersweet chocolate. bit of milk chocolate. cinnamon. rich cacao. lightly warming chili character. hint of coffee. light alcohol. whole wheat bread and biscuit. the vanilla character stays mostly hidden until the end.
mouthfeel is great. medium-large body. just under medium carbonation level. very smooth.
drinkability is great. excellent balance. great extra depth. all the elements - cacao, chili, cinnamon - come through and compliment well. great stuff. i think the chili heat came through more in the small sample that i had back in april, but that may have been the intense case of heartburn talking... 1,130 charactersgrub, Aug 13, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml bottle cracked by the generous viggo - thanks man!
Pours a thick black with a finger of the darkest head I think I have ever seen, a black mocha darker than your average porter.
Nose reveals chocolate, coffee, earth, a hint of roast - solid but nothing beyond what I would expect from a top-notch RIS.
Quite an earthy quality to this one, dusty cocoa powder, espresso, wood, a herbal component, nice full roastiness, the chili is lightly noticeable in the beginning but builds as you drink until it provides a light warming which is quite pleasant - well integrated in to the beer. A hint of cinnamon especially as it warms, light alcohol heat in the finish. Slick, thick mouthfeel, very smooth, light hop drying in the finish.
This works well, especially considering all the wacky stuff that's in it. It's perhaps a bit brash yet but has all the hallmarks of a world-class beer. Thanks Eric, this was high on my wants! 929 charactersritzkiss, Aug 13, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a thick black with reddish brown head. Smell of chocolate malts, some alcohol. Sweet malty chocolate flavor up front with a strong chile taste following. Not spicy, not too smokey, the anchos are front and center for this one. Finish has a slight bitterness that doesnt quite balance out the sweet/smokey flavors... somehow this beer still works. Mouthfeel is syrupy and coating, for me it is spot on for an imperial stout. Although I think this is a great twist on the imperial stout, by the end of my glass I was done with the chile flavors. I would be happy to drink this one again but there is no way I could do more then 8oz. That being said, I definitley recommend trying this. 689 charactersnkersten, Aug 11, 2010

The loss of one so dear, and so young, and so beautiful... the sorrow beats in your soul along with the rhythmic chirping of insects... why me? Why must this happen to me? But you are not the first, and probably far from the last, in this God-loved and seemingly God-forsaken habitat. 
The night is oil-black, viscous and earthy as it pours over you with all of it's whiles and inhumanities... there is a head, as it were, of thick tan, the only semblance of normalcy, of the idea that the earth is still spinning, despite your wishes, despite your feeling that it should have long since given up it's megalomaniacal drift through nothing.
There existed sweeter times once, next to her, times of laughter and cordial cherries, chili peppers with coffee and cream, but all gone now, and only the beating of your desolate heart as it sings the melody of long forgotten times when happiness was a part of you.
And you sit and sip your beer in desolate remembrance, its qualities seeming a mockery of the reality into which you are plunged... the insolent complexity, defying you to pick apart beyond its coffee (as you so often enjoyed with her), dense roasted grain (as she watched in rapt admiration) and pepper spice that you so used to deeply enjoy, as now it all deems you desire to purge...
The chewy, viscous dream of this only serves to remind your tearful eyes of her skin at your lips, supple and soft, the physical consisting so much of your brand of love....
And you realize that for the rest of your timid, miserable existence you will wall off your heart and present it to no one for the rending, screaming abscess that now exists there where her love should rightly be, where she should be against you as you slumber. 
You will instead derive what enjoyment still remains in life by destroying pint after pint of this nectar, though it does little to fill the deep chasm in your soul. 2,060 characterskhiasmus, Aug 10, 2010
4.48/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle, thanks to mikesgroove!(!!) Very,very black pour, so thick and syrupy it looks like it pours slowly. A thick dark brown head sits on top. I really pick up the cocoa on the aroma with the chilis mostly. I was actually expecting something more volatile as an aroma but this is good. Taste is quite complex, lots of vanilla, cocoa and cinnamon. Palate has a good carbonation, which makes the mouthfeel a bit short but not syrupy, quite drinkable. Creamy but not sticky. A very well done imperial stout considering it doesn't benefit from barrel aging. 555 charactersLuk13, Aug 09, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Taken from notes written on 06-20-2010.
Appearance - Pours into a Bruery Tulip with just an amazing dark viscosity. No light dare try to make it through this beer. Less than a finger of mocha colored head that dissipates relatively fast leaving slight lacing.
Smell - Heavy sweet vanilla, chocolate, and spices. I could smell this all night. On the tail end, molasses and just a hint of tobacco.
Taste - Wow, a very unique taste. One can taste the cacao nibs right up front with the vanilla melding into it nicely, but it is the pasilla chiles that give this thing its unique flavor kick. A very interesting take and one that works. 
Mouthfeel - Heavy bodied, low carbonation, chewy mouthfeel.
Drinkability - As with other big stouts, this is best shared. However, a very good beer indeed. The flavors meld together in an utterly unique yet totally balanced manner. I am glad I was able to try this, thanks to alexd3891. 925 charactersSpdKilz, Aug 09, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -10.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours pitch black with a strikingly dark, lush head that, for the style at least, hangs around for a long time. Can't really ask for more in this department.
A few whiffs gives you a complex blend of cherries, peanut butter, salted carmel and vanilla bean. Just a bit of alcohol in the background. Overall, a very nice mix.
Mouthfeel is very full, approaching the syrupy quality of some vintages of Dark Lord. Not necessarily a turn-off for me, but you are forewarned: this is a tremendously thick beer.
The beer starts with a sugar rush that is as strong as any beer I've tried, but just when I'm worried that this will be a one-note diabetes inducing mess, the complexity promised by the nose develops... Earthy vanilla bean gives way to tobacco and leather flavors. The finish is where this beer shines: the earthy flavors build into a pleasant coffee char and a bit of chilli spice makes an appearance that strengthens with repeated sips. In a sea of impys, this beer has its own unique flavor signature that is well worth a try. Although I haven't tried the barrel aged version, I wonder if the process risks overshadowing some of the subtleties of the finish. 1,168 characterschicagobeerriot, Aug 02, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to florida9 for grabbing this elusive beer for me. 
Opaque and black, with a short but tightly packed dark tan head that's the color of wet sand. It dissipates w/in 2 minutes and leaves a ring of foam around the edge for the remainder of the drink.
Nose is cocoa, cinnamon, and a touch of vanilla. Heavy on the roast. 
The complexities pick up much more in the taste than in the smell. Cocoa is the base of all the flavor, but it's intermingled with an earthy spice that's presumably from the chiles. They are very subtle and without already knowing they were in there I would have never picked them out. The vanilla dances around for brief showing and it finishes right where it started, with the cocoa. 
Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. There's little carbonation, as it should be. 
Good drinkability for a stout. ABV and heavy body makes it somewhat restricting to have more than a couple, but it's damn good. 
This is a beer that lives up to the hype and I wish I had easier access to it. 1,003 charactersVonerichs, Aug 01, 2010

One finger dark tan head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Dark brown body, opaque, no visible carbonation. One of the most difficult to deconstruct noses in a beer I've ever had, the chiles were so nuanced compared to most chile beers that you really need to concentrate to appreciate in the nose, with the cocoa nibs providing some spicy, not sweet, nuances, and a big noble pine hop hit on the back end. One great smelling beer. Taste mirror the nose's complexity and character, the interaction between the chiles and the cocoa nibs is superlative, and this is a surprisingly smooth beer, not sticky at all, and you'd never guess this is an 11% ABV beer. I haven't been a fan of the Cigar City hype, but this beer is certainly worth the hype. One of the best Imperial Stouts I've had, would certainly seek this out again. Thanks to the awesome hannont for providing this gem. Highly recommended. 963 charactersjdense, Jul 31, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.54oz pour into a Perfect Pint glass...very happy to share this with everyone at a recent tasting, but after I had some, damn...wish I had more!
The body is dark black to the point of almost mirror like. A thick single finger of (what looked like) melted chocolate formed on top of the body. The head lasted and clung all over the glass.
The nose is amazing...lots of rich chocolate, deep coffee notes, roasted malts and a hint of spice. Some lighter aromas in the background include vanilla and malted cream.
Wow...the flavor sticks right with the nose...a hefty blast of creamy cocoa hits the palate first. This slides away for the roasted malts and freshly ground coffee flavors. The finish finds the spicy/pepper notes detected in the nose. Very complex and well balanced.
The mouth feel is rich and full, creamy as all hell with mild carbonation.
From the small serving, I could not detect any of the ABV, making this extremely drinkable. The highlight of the night (against some monster competition). A wonderful beer that is worth any effort to acquire! 1,063 charactersmgbickel, Jul 26, 2010

Has an aroma of vanilla and pepper. Sweet start. Then notes of pepper and vanilla, that mix with the cinnamon, to give it a wood flavor. An awesome cocoa finish with notes of cimmamon. What makes this beer so special is the perfect medium mouthfeel and the quality flavor of the cocoa. Cannot wait to get my hands on another one. Many thanks to Damico for tasting of this top IS. 494 characterschalsk, Jul 14, 2010

3.11/5  rDev -31%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5Thanks to Abel for sharing at his tasting:
A - Pours jet black with about 2 fingers of mocha head. Dissipates moderately leaves some nice lacing. Great job.
S - Melanoidins, chiles, milk chocolate and some light roasted coffee. The melanoidins have almost reached a soy sauce phase and the chiles came as a bit of a surprise. Some alcohol flavors, which are to be expected with a heavyweight. 
T - Starts with some malt roastiness and heavy melanoidins, which are a bit cloyingly sweet. Followed by chocolate, vanilla, and a moderate dose of alcohol warmth. Light bittering hops finish the taste.
M - Malt dominated, with a medium to full body. Lots of carbonation and a cloying creaminess. There is quite a kick of alcohol warmth. 
D - My expectations were let down by this beer. The alcohol warmth is a bit much and the beer is too cloying. It is almost as if the yeast were unhealthy. This beer could use some heavy aging as well. 
In general, I think most BAs are quick to hype imperial stouts and poo-poo the lagers. There are some well crafted imp stouts like Abyss, Old Rasputin, Kate the Great, and Dark lord, but this isn't one of them. 1,151 charactersMisterClean, Jul 07, 2010

A- Pitch black, viscous, and heavy as hell. No light penetrates this one. 2 finger chocolatey head. Very Immense looking
S- Just incredible, loads of sweet chocolate followed by dark sweet fruit and hints of pepper spice.Detect some vanilla and caramel, dark licorice, and malted milkballs.
T- Very complex, initial bitter and sweet chocolate flavors, roasted malt and toast, followed by more sweetness and pepper-heat as the beer warms
M- Thick, Thick, Thick, and coats all the way down. A bit syrupy for my taste, but delicious.
D- Split this with a few friends, I woke up on the couch where I drank this one. After this and a few homebrews I was fucked up! It became a bit difficult to finish as we delved deeper into the bottle and the beer warmed up. Glad I got to try this one. 846 charactersRbald42, Jul 01, 2010

Poured this into a tulip. Pours thick and black and leaves about of inch of dark mocha colored head. This head is beautiful, this really looks fantastic. I'm very attracted to this beer. I love the sticky lacing. The smell is complex, possibly a little to much. A lot of different scents going on and a little tough to focus on just one. Cocoa and roasted malts are very apparent. Hints of dark fruits, tobacco, and molasses linger in the background. Mild spiciness in the nostrils also, probably due to the chiles and cinnamon. I can smell the alcohol in this. The more I smell this, the more I'm put off by the smell. As I hoped, the taste is outstanding. Delicious and roasty. I can taste cocoa and rich malts. The cocoa is slightly perfect for me, just there enough in the finish to be perfect. A little spiciness, but not quite what I was hoping for from the presence of the chiles and the cinnamon, but none the less, this is mostly on point. The richness of the cocoa and the vanilla make for a nostalgic feeling of comforting hot chocolate. The mouth feel is great. The subtle carbonation is great for all the complex flavors in this. Thick and delicious, just what I expected from this Imperial Stout. Good drinkability for everything going on in this beer. A bit heavy and slightly boozy, but I want this to be a sipper anyhow. 1,366 charactersBendurgin, Jun 28, 2010
2.5/5  rDev -44.6%look: 5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Shared a 750 ml bottle 5 ways.
A - pours thick, a Beautiful inch thick head covers the motor oil stout. Looking into the glass you notice the head has colored of tan and red, and they swirll together to marbalize a great looking beer.
S - ok, this beer starts to go downhill here. The aroma is of soy sauce and chilies. Really offputting for my stout preferences. The aroma jumps around to slight coffee roast, but the bad smell of the chilies overpowers and ruins it for me.
T - this beer is different. The first sip hits with a slight coffee and chocolate blend, some slight vanilla, then hits you with a cloying sweetness, then some offputting chilies, finished by a slight hot alcoholic finish with cocoa, and it could not have finished much worse. The beer was all over the place and the flavors did not blend well at all. It felt like they just through in a million good ingredients and figured they would all be great together, and simply, it doesn't work well together.
M - very carbonated, creamy, and smooth. This is how I enjoy my stouts. The carbonation could be toned down a bit, but the mouthfeel is still amazing.
D - this beer was a tough one to drink. All 5 of us said it was a rough beer, and hard to enjoy. The messy flavors ruin the beer I was expecting to enjoy. The heat from the alcohol is noticable, and offputting. I didn't want anymore of this beer, so the drinkability suffers.
O - this was one of the biggest beer dissapointments IMO. The flavor was all over the place, cloying sweetness, chilies, and alcohol ruin what could have been a good beer. It was close to unanimous that this beer was far from good. I really went into this unique beer with an open mind, but was still just dissapointed in the end. Not worth the hassle to get and try this messy beer. 1,794 charactersabecall98, Jun 27, 2010

The pour was the most beautiful pouring experience I have seen. The crown appeared to be powdered hot chocolate, whipped cream which glistened in the light. This beer was blinging! The smell hit me as soon as the cap was popped. There is the aroma of roasted chocolate and vanilla malt. Definitely some spice in the nose with a hint of toffee Heath Bar. This beer's taste is bold-very demanding, and warming. This beer is thick, yet as smooth as satin. For such a big beer it is drinking wonderfully. This is one of my favorite beers-ever. 647 charactersJosephLondon, Jun 25, 2010
4.48/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle like used motor oil, black as night. a very thick 2 finger head of coffee colored head hung around like crazy.
Smell is roasted malt, dark fruits, dark chocolate, slightly boozy.
Taste is smokey was the first impression, reminds me of salami. The chillies definitely make a presence, huge dark chocolate. There's just a ton of flavors going on with this one and is not like anything I've ever tried.
Mouthfeel is like a thin milkshake, chewy is definitely in line with this, it was actually surprising how full bodied this was.
This is a wonderfully complex brew works well as a dessert type deal, but anything more than like 6-8 ozs would be overkill. 
Glad I have another to age for a while to see how this changes. 740 characterssliverX, Jun 24, 2010

Thick, dark mahogany in color, with a tiny bubbled tan head. Aroma includes milk chocolate, vanilla bean and slightly pungent pepper. Flavor bursts forth with chocolate, roasty chicory and cinnamony goodness. Finish hits with the spicy heat of the peppers included in the recipe. Deeply satifying and the best sweet/hot combination-style brews I've yet to try. Awesome. 434 charactersbranimal9, Jun 15, 2010

A: Absolute black body topped by billowing dark tan head--almost 2 inches worth.
S: Chocolate, coffee and molasses with some tobacco and leather.
T: Taste follows aroma very well. There's also dark fruit and a slight hoppy bitterness in the finish.
M: Nice and thick, almost syrupy.
D: The lingering bitterness after a couple of glasses is a little much but that's not going to stop me from drinking this whole bottle by myself.
My first CC brew and we're off to a great start. A very solid stout! 678 charactersAdamdc, Jun 15, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to paulv for sending out this awesome brew!
Poured into a Portsmouth tulip glass. Big, black and opaque in the body with a thin, dark tan, mocha colored head that mostly fades into a thin film that collects around the edges of the glass. This has got to be on of the darkest colored heads I have ever seen. Very impressive. Small patches of lacing left behind.
Chocolate malts, roasted dark malts with a faint coffee aspect make up most of the nose. Some crushed vanilla bean and a bit of hot pepper linger. Touch of alcohol. Aroma seems seems a bit muted, but still well rounded.
Tipping back the glass reveals raw chocolate cocoa with a bit of warming pepper heat. The chillies are at the perfect level for this beer. Noticeable, but not overdone. Vanilla is light, but evens out the darker malt bitterness. Slight touch of woodiness and some alcohol. Decently complex. Sweetness and bitterness play off each other well.
The mouthfeel is very smooth, silky, with warming peppers and alcohol. Nice body, almost perfect.
For an 11.5% ABV stout, this beer goes down pretty easy. All this ingredients are very well balanced. It seems that 22oz is about the perfect size for two people, even though tackling an entire bottle by yourself would probably not be too difficult. You can feel the ABV, but it is decently masked from the taste, making this a pleasure to drink.
Overall, this is a pretty awesome beer. Lots of flavor and a great body. I the love the chillies and cocoa nibs. Definitely wish I had another in the cellar. It will be interesting to see how this beer ages. Hopefully I can pick up some other Cigar City brews in the future. 1,655 characterssisuspeed, Jun 13, 2010

A viscous, ink black body with a one finger mocha head. The head was firm and creamy and fell to a small layer and left some lines of lace here and there.
Heavy roast, coffee grounds, cocoa nibs, spicy peppers and a touch of molasses and licorice. This is a broad and rich aroma, heavy roast. Full and robust.
Deep roasted coffee and dark chocolate up front, with coffee grounds adding a bitter middle. Vanilla and spicy peppers with another heavy flood of roast in the finish. This is a mean, full and robust beer. The finish of heavy roast and a speck of vanilla sweetness lingers on forever.
Smooth, creamy and luscious. The mouthfeel here is perfect. Smooth up front and lush and creamy through the middle. 
For the style, this is about as drinkable as it gets. The roast is really heavy and lingers long, which might be the only detriment, but even then, it's not a bad thing. Full, rich and robust with loads of flavor. 956 charactersColForbinBC, Jun 13, 2010

Smell: loads of alcohol, pepper, vanilla, and roasted malt tones are easily detectable.
Taste: big flavor as roasted malt is accentuated by some pepper spice, cinammon, vanilla, coffee, and a hint licorice. Alcohol is a bit overwhelming in the beer's flavor profile. 
Mouthfeel: a bit thinner than expected for the style. Smooth at the start, smooth and a bit syrupy late. Long lasting alcohol, spice, and roasted tones linger around in the mouth a while.
Drinkability: this is a one glass per session beer. I found this to be a bit hot from the alcohol and spice for me. 665 charactersGavage, Jun 09, 2010

Appears a pitch black with a small tan he'd that quickly fades out into a mild cap. Scattered bits of lacing are left around the glass. 
Smell is of molasses, herbal tea, chalk, black grapes, spicy balck and dried red pepper. 
Taste is of the aromas with vanilla yogurt, cinnamon, pasilla peppers, and red grapes.

A: The stout is pitch black, dark as the darkest mole, darker even. A reddish-brown head stands out against the black ale.
S: The nose is dark and rich, plenty of chocolate, both powdery and semi-sweet, abounds, along with cinnamon spice. I was hoping for a hint of smoky ancho heat but didn't come across anything. The dark malts create a a richly sweet body that has me anticipating the first sip.
T: The 11% strength of the ale hits you square on in the first sip. Mixing with the booze is plenty of chocolate, cocoa powdery and sweet, along with more spices, cinnamon and vanilla, although neither is dominant. The richness, and this ale is rich, is remarkable, sweet and filling. I was disappointed that the ancho chiles never made their way into the ale; I think that a touch of heat would be welcome amongst the decadent chocolate malts. A good, scratch that, very good stout.
M: I'm pleased to have a Cigar City stout that lives up to the hype (thanks for nothin' 110K + OT). The semi-sweet, powdery chocolate is reminicent of a sweet mole sauce.
D: I was not expecting to see this on tap, what a surprise. I was pleasantly surprised from the first sip, a crazy rich, warming, strong stout. 1,307 charactersakorsak, Jun 09, 2010

Sample was 5.5 oz. into a snifter. Poured a thick, black with a one-finger rich, thick, creamy head. Both the head and great lacing had great retention. Nose was chocolate, malts, toffee and vanilla. Taste was very heavy on the chocolate, but notes of the vanilla, some spice and a bit of the roasted malts. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy with a good level of carbonation. All-in-all, for me this was VERY sweet and I could only drink this at specific times. Great imperial stout but I much preferred the brandy barrel. 622 charactersregspeir, Jun 07, 2010

Poured into a snifter. Pours an opague black with an extremely thick chocolate colored heading. Lacing is all over the plce. Left ring's down to the last drop. So alive looking for a RIS.
The nose is simply amazing. The main aroma is of the cocoa nibs the used. Quickly followed up cinnamon and a just an all out assault in the nose of coffee.
Taste again heavy in chocolate and coffee. A bite of warm booziness. There is another subtle bite to this beer which I originally thought was the the alcohol content but it was actually the peppers I was tasting all along . Simply amazing.
Mouth is full bodied and the most alive feeling on the palate I have ever felt for an RIS. Some diacytl is slippery on the palate as well.
Uhmm what can I say ? The best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had. 849 charactersTheFightfan1, Jun 06, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Capone's for Beer Week 2010, I love this city and da burbs.
Regular hunna off the tap looks black like most other stouts. A big black liquid with thickness syrup like consistancy and a kinda thick film left on the glass going down. The head is deep dark mocha coffee brown. Nice looking beer.
Well there it is, hunna smells like a treat with black rich coffee, that chocolate thang but oh so much more. The chillies were put to good use because they actually show up in the scent unlike some other attempts. Cocco mixed with some vanilla sweetness and some sprinkled cinnamon barely. Some slight booze, nothing major.
What is major though is the taste on hunna, this shit is redic. I did not like this much first time around, but I've come to understand, it's a stout with character and offers more than your general big stout tastes. Besides your normal chocolate, coffee, vanilla, which is all present mind you, the cinnamon and chilli addition just work. With some underlining cocco, it just comes off as big and good. Semi sweet, roasty and different.
A big body on this one, a thick and coating beer with just a touch of heat on the mouth but not fresh barleywine out the vat hot, it's quite tame for it's strength. Full bodied with a nice amount of carbon sense. Not syrupy but this is awful close. A big bodied stout, but not the biggest, I've had way thicker, this goes down pretty easy all things considered.
Well, it's the summertime, it's a bit past 2:00pm and Im ordering another one of these, it's just that good. Im totally out on stouts presently, but not this one, this one is kinda a keeper. Great job Cigar City. 1,645 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 06, 2010

4.51/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've had this in growler and bottle form and now twice on draft. This review is for the draft version served at Capone's.
Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a two finger frothy mocha colored head that has excllent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Th glass is left coated with chunks of mocha lacing. Looks amazing!
Silky chocolate malt aroma with subtle roastiness. This is balanced by the sweet chocolate notes and subtle spicy cinnamon and peppers. The peppers aren't as prominent in the nose. 
Chewy full body with lots of luscious chocolate malt sweetness which is balanced out by faint roasty byes and a strog spicy/peppery finish. Hints of chocolate, oatmeal, toffee, cffee bean and lactic creaminess balanced by a delicious peppermint, cinnamon spiciness in the finish as well as some slight spicy heat from the ancho chili peppers. Amazingly complex, full bodied and dangerously drinkable at such a high ABV. Highly recommended! 966 characterscorby112, Jun 05, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours deep dark brown with a creamy brown head. A promising appearance that suggests this is a seriously thick, creamy stout. Smells of cocoa, vanilla, and crazy roasted malt. Flavor is amazing - chocolate, vanilla, coconut, very light spice from the chiles, and dried dark fruits. In spite of the ABV, there's no heat to this. Body is extremely thick, one of the thickest beers I've had. But not syrupy in the least. Carbonation is medium. Highly drinkable for such a thick high ABV beverage. I'm still working and having trouble resisting just chugging this. 560 characterswaltonc, Jun 05, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this a couple times now. Finally reviewing my own bottle.
Pours a motor oil black. No head or lacing.
Aroma has all sorts of of stuff goin on. I smell the chillis, coffee, chocolate, a little soy sauce. Smells great.
Tastes almost like it smells. Chillis are less in the taste which is good. More chocolate and roast grains. A little touch of salt. Tons of coffee. What a good beer.
Mouthfeel is a little heavy but good. Good carb.
Overall there are other stouts I think deserve to be higher on the top 100 but this one deserves somewhere in there. 557 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Jun 04, 2010
3.96/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Shared a 750 ml bottle 3 ways as a night cap to a evening of pretty moderate drinking. 
Viscous, pitch black, dark brown head. Smells pretty standard stouty (roasty, coffee-y, chocolatey etc) with a little bit of smoked chiles. The core of the taste is also pretty standard big stout flavors more coffee, chocolate, roastiness, brown sugar, a little bit of dark fruit. What sets this one apart though is the subtle underlying flavors. First, the peppers are a really unique addition. My buddies said they tasted a lot of chiles but I only got them very subtly with just a tiny bit of heat that slowly builds with each sip to the point of being noticeable. Vanilla is there for a subtle smoothness, and there is a bit of spiciness (cinnamon) that you have to go searching for. Maybe I only went looking for these subtleties because they were promised on the label and would have missed them otherwise, but this wasn't a blind tasting so everything (including the label) is part of the drinking experience. Mouthfeel is creamy, and thick with a comforting warmth. With everything going on here a small 8-10 oz pour was plenty, I took my time with it and was not particularly sad to see the bottom of the glass feeling like I had thoroughly experienced the beer. Unfortunately while I can't put my finger on why while it was an interesting, unique beer it just didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would. 1,405 charactersShumista, Jun 03, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into a Duvel tulip. Thanks to cmorton for sharing.
Pours black. Redish brown one finger head from a slow and steady pour. Quickly resides to a ring of foam with wisps of head on top. Little specs of lacing are left on the glass. The red hue on the head is really attractive.
Smells heavily of dark fruits, dark chocolate, some vanilla and caramel with hints of spicy chillies. I also get a whiff of graham crackers, delicious!
Tastes like dark chocolate covered dates/raisins, brownies, some vanilla, and a hint of chillies on the end. Chillies are subtle and add to the flavor nicely. All the extra ingredients in this beer are not overpowering and simply add to the overall complexity. The chocolatey dark fruit flavor is particularly noticeable however.
Very thick/viscous and syrupy mouthfeel. Rich and full bodied. A little spicy from the chillies and hot from the alcohol, but not too much so.
Really complex and tasty. An inviting and drinkable imperial stout that has some interesting twist on the basic style. Basically, it lived up to my expectations. 1,073 charactersbillshmeinke, Jun 02, 2010
3.58/5  rDev -20.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured thick and ominous. Smells smokey. I get roasted malts and coffee beans of an imperial, but smokey chilies are pretty detectable. 
The chilies are just as present in the taste as it was in the smell if not more. It tastes roasted with malts, bitter chocolate and coffee. The chilies add an interesting complexity and heat to the finish. I like the oily and creamy texture, but its a little weird with the spicy flavor of the chilies. I'm glad I'm splitting this, I don't think I'd want a whole bottle to myself. It's a different beer for sure, but I've had several beers I'd prefer to it. 595 charactersliquidcraft, Jun 02, 2010

750ml Bottle
Poured into a chalice a thick black color, some carbonation, very nice almost fizzy/creamy one-finger dark tan head, with some nice big oil slick in the middle of the glass. The nose is very nice malty, with lots of chocolate/toffee notes, some vanilla, some roast notes. The taste is exceptional, malty, chocolate/toffee up the ying/yang, very nice sweetness from the vanilla, with some very nice roast notes, slight cinnamon note comes up. Full Body, this is one very smooth/creamy brew, the ABV is hidden very well. Very Drinkable, Very Well Done CC. 614 charactersWasatch, Jun 02, 2010
3.96/5  rDev -12.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5750ml bottle received in a trade with a generous BA thanks!
Appearance: Pours dark as night with a 2 finger brown crown that displays good retention and lace. 
Smell: Roast malt, loads of chocolate, smoked chilies, and vanilla.
Taste: Same as nose but with lots of chili presences and roast malt / espresso bitterness taking center stage. 
Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy at times, creamy at other times, with decent carbonation.
Drinkability: The thick mouthfeel, the high abv, and the bitterness from the roast malt hold this one back from scoring higher in the drinkability department.
Not sold on the hype just yet. 618 characterskoopa, May 31, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to HawkeyeDaz for cracking this open yesterday.
Pours a soul-crushing black with a dark, tan head. There is nobody that makes a more appetizing looking beer than Cigar City and this is no exception.
In the nose, I get ample amounts of cocoa, coffee bean, a tinge of cedar to go along with the chili peppers.
Mmmm, this tastes so deliciously complex! I get the spiciness of the peppers upfront, blended in very well with chocolate, coffee and the slightest, slightest hints of cinnamon. Vanilla soothes out this savage beast making it a smooth finish.
Heavy body, thick coat going down. Beautifully carbonated for the style. Just a terrific, unique treat from Cigar City. Loved it! 691 charactersrudylaw, May 31, 2010
2.92/5  rDev -35.3%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Alrighty, finally acquired some bottles of this one and decided to crack it.
The appearance is f*cking gorgeous. This is what a stout should look like. Pitch black and pours like motor oil. A nice three finger chocolate marshmallow head upon a somewhat forceful pour.
Smell is, meh. Some vanilla and cacao, not much going on in the sinuses for this one.
Taste is, again, meh. I get a *hint* of vanilla, a good amount of the cacao nibs, but little to none of the chiles. You can kind of tell it's there, but not really. Maybe it was more present super fresh?
Mouthfeel is like the appearance, a wondrous experience. So creamy and smooth. It sets the standard for mouthfeel on a stout.
Drinkability isn't bad, but it wasn't smart for me to try and drink this one by myself. I'd probably recommend nothing beyond a 10ox pour of this one and even that may be a bit much.
It's a decent brew, in everything except taste. Which sadly is why we all drink these, isn't it? 969 charactersCedromar, May 30, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bottle courtesy of Freethyhops. Thanks Riley!
Served near room temperature, it pours a pitch black with a 1 finger head of dark chocolate foam. The rather good head of foam surprised me. I wonder if there's any lacing? Yes sir eee.
The smell has notes of vanilla and roasted malt, cocoa, and some spice. Could be the cinnamon mentioned on the label. Not an overly big bold nose. And just when I say that, the smell *does* intensify and is big and bold. Resmells are always a must as giving time for the beer to "breathe", perceptions can easily change.
The taste has a BIG blast of a cocoa bitterness and roasted malt, vanilla, cinnamon spice, some sweet malts, and a spicy kick about mid palate that has *got* to be from the chiles. Wow. What a kick to the flavours they are. I can taste a little bit of tartness floating around in there but not much and it isn't needed at all. Some warming starts to creep in but I can't say the alcohol is a big factor tastewise. Delicious brew.
Full bodied with lightish carbonation. Super good mouthfeel.
Drinkability? For the abv and the really thick body that this brings to the table, very good. This will easily be close to a one hour session but I ain't complaining... 1,217 charactersBitterbill, May 30, 2010

Appearence is amazing. Jet black with two fingers of brown sedimented head.
Smell is a mix of vanilla, cocoa, and a hint of spice. 
taste is a blend of cocoa, excellent dark malt, a hint of vanilla, with chilli spiciness lingering at the end. exceptionally complex and all the flavors are tasty.
Mouthfeel is smooth and thick. Not syrupy at all as some stouts can get. 
Smooth and drinkable, but the super complex flavor profile makes me very content with only 1-2 servings.
thanks again to my sister for picking this up on her trip to florida. 610 characterspdoran10, May 29, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter. Thanks to jyounger30 for a chance to try this one. Can't wait to see if the beer lives up to the hype.
4.0 A: Pours a syruppy black color. Two fingers of creamy dark brown head with about average retention and some spotty lacing.
5.0 S: Wonderful nose. Right up there with the best of them. Complex with all the aromas collaborating. Sweet milk chocolate is by far the most prominent aroma. Blackstrap molasses, lots of toffee, some coffee, dark crystal malts. Plenty of roasted barley and toastiness to balance, but the sweetness still dominates. Vanilla is subtle and in the background. I may be detecting the cinnamon, but I'm not sure. Can't tell there's a chile in there though.
4.5 T: Sweet chocolate is most prominent again. Black coffee and roasted barley team up to give this an equally forceful roastiness and bitterness. Vanilla bean is subtle again, but definitely there. I definitely picking up the chiles now and they add a vegetal character, but I'm glad there aren't stronger. The only problem I have with this beer is that the alcohol isn't well hidden. 
5.0 M: Heavy body with a silky creaminess to it. Good moderate carbonation. Thick, smooth, and silky is the way I like my Imperial Stouts and this meets all my requirements.
4.5 D: Very tasty beer with a wonderful nose and great mouthfeel. This is definitely the real deal. Time for another ISO. 1,395 charactersDavoleBomb, May 28, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750ml bottle into a small snifter glass. Acquired in a recent trade and there was some minor seepage in transit, but it didn't seem to affect the flavor.
A: Color is a deep black with a tinge of red along the edge of the glass where the liquid met the dark tan, almost brown head. The head was thin and disippated quickly. Vicious.
S: Wow, this is complex and only got more so as it warmed. Rich cocoa, coffee, a little smoke wood (from the peppers, possibly?), some faint cinnamon. Didn't get the vanilla.
T: Very nice and rich. Like the smell, the taste has a lot going on and changes as it warms. Lots of chocolate, some smokey tang that I associate with a fire roasted sweet pepper, some faint cinnamon, a little coffee on the finish. Finish is long with a little heat on the back off the throat. Very pleasant finish.
M: Thick, very heavy, coating the mouth. Just a little carbonation, but perfect. Enough to give the beer a little life in the mouth.
D: This was excellent. Not your everyday beer, but very, very enjoyable. It's important to let it warm a little, as the flavors really came out as it warmed. I would have liked to see a little more vanilla. But this was very enjoyable and something I'll seek out again. 1,244 charactersoregonskibum, May 27, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a viscous black ink that a dark chocolate head rises from, sheet stays, some webs.
S - Roasted malts, coffee, tobacco, chocolate, smokey ancho, slight vanilla and alcohol warmth.
T - This is a pretty complex beer that definitely needs to reach the correct drinking temp. Starts with chocolate sweetness, mid palate slight cinnamon, which fades into the eventual super roasted finish that reminds me of a good cup of black coffee.
M/D - The mouthfeel is perfect, think and oily with the right amount of carbonation to help it over your tongue. Drinkability only suffers for me due to the amount of roasted malts. This beer would be great with a chocolate ancho cake, but might be overkill. 701 charactersxpimptastikx, May 26, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Received this in a trade recently and decided to pull it out at a tasting on May 23, 2010. 
This is another very thick and vicious black tar Imperial Stout. With a hard pour, maybe a half finger dark brown head appears. Really thick grainy legs on the sides of my glass. 
The smell is of straight Swedish milk chocolate. Pepper, coffee, and a spice that has to be the cinnamon. Great chocolate smell, maybe this isn't a beer but just a melted down chocolate bar. 
The taste is great, thick body just sits the flavors on the palate. Chocolate, sweet cafe con leche, roasty grain, cocoa, and a peppery taste towards the end. Delicious cinnamon flavor once the brew warms up a bit. 
The mouthfeel is thick, mean, heavy, whatever way you want to put it this beer has body. Like a thick black leather boot it kicks you in the mouth. This beer was good, what it could improve on is the head retention, the chile flavor was not as good as a beer like Chocolate Yeti, and it was a grainy. Overall the beer is spectacular and worthy of the hype.

A- Body is thick and solid motor oil black. Pours with a 1 finger foamy dark brown head that has good retention and some lacing is left behind in the glass.
S- The highlight is spiciness-hot pepper and a hint of cinnamon. This is really in balance with rich bittersweet dark chocolate, anise and licorice.
T- Upfront is an accent of spiciness over prominent roasted malt and rich dark chocolate. Some anise is in the background. The finish is quite smooth and adds a hint of vanilla sweetness. A slight alcohol heat lingers.
M- Medium carbonation with a smooth, syrupy, and exceptionally smooth and creamy body.
D- I am very impressed with this brew. Has to be one of my top stouts. I love the addition of cinnamon and hot pepper and think it compliments the stout qualities very well. Would love to have this one again! 856 charactersPittBeerGirl, May 24, 2010

A: Pours "pitch black like an oil slick blah blah". Actually Hunahpu scores high marks in appearance because of its massive milk chocolate colored head. I cant chalk it up to my Duvel tulip because Ive been seeing plenty of impys pour into this glass with no head lately. This black liquid actually appears to be staining my glass brown as I swish it around.
S: Chocolate, coffee, some spice. Is that heat from the chili peppers or sharpness from booze? Hunahpu smells pretty good, but not terribly complex. 
T: Opens with sweetness/dark fruit bordering on cloying, which mellows to reveal chocolate, vanilla, and a bitterness akin to fresh roasted coffee beans. 
Theres definitely spice on the back end but I wish it developed just a little bit more. I found some cinnamon toward the end of the palate, but then again I was looking for it. The chili's become most apparent during Hunahpu's aftertaste, when you notice a bit of heat left to mingle on the palate. Overall the flavors are just huge, palatable, and pretty complex. High marks for taste, but I was hoping for a bit more defining character and less subtleness in regards to the spice.
M: Thoroughly thick and coating.... might stain your teeth. Low carb.
D: Another huge stout suitable for a 6-8oz serving in my opinion. Drinkability suffers due to sweetness, ABV, and general palate assault. For what it is, a great beer that I am glad to have tried. 1,442 characterszoolzoo, May 24, 2010

A: Quite an ominous pour from the bottle. Viscous and black, creating a sturdy mocha head in the glass.
S: I was worried that the chili peppers would overwhelm the beer, but they provide only a subtle spice to the beer which works nicely with the sweet components. Chocolate and vanilla, along with caramel and roasted malts complete the nose.
T: A much more balanced flavor than the BA version offers. An inviting sweetness up-front of chocolate and vanilla, followed by a touch of bitterness and spice (chili and cinnamon) on the back end.
M: A very thick and chewy feel on the tongue. The carbonation is minimal, as it should be and just helps to enhance the creaminess.
D: The alcohol is nowhere to be found, but this one does pack quite the punch. A fantastic stout and one of the first CCB beers I've been really impressed by. 920 characterswomencantsail, May 24, 2010

S-the nose brings something different every time I swirl it. the chilies and pepper notes will show through on one. the cocoa nibs on another, a good bit of roasted malts throughout with a touch of vanilla. anise and molasses in the back with a touch of dark fruits. hints of fusel alcohol in the back but still solid.
T-the pepper spice is right up front, roasted malts, dark chocolate and vanilla behind. the cinnamon comes in towards the back with a fair bit of dark fruity sweetness to close the deal. lots going on here and it works fairly well together.
M-this is very smooth on the palate, full bodied and slightly dry in the back. so soft in my mouth. just enough carb to allow this to fall softly down the throat.
D-this has some interesting stuff going on, the sweetness is very nice in the back to balance the peppery spice up front. it is a well done contrast with a nice balance to it. not something I can drink a ton of but still a tasty brew! 1,060 characterscpetrone84, May 22, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: The bottle is saturated with adjectives, so it must be good, right? Hunahpu's is extremely thick and equally dark. A single drop is enough to completely hide a white surface. Carbonation is nearly non-existant, and a head is hard to coax out of this thick liquid. Swirling the glass results in a viscous black film that never really settles, but simply clings there, like paint on a wall.
S: Bouquet is well presented. Chocolate and molasses dominate, with little else perceptable through their strength.
T: Flavor begins with a mountain of chocolate supported by smooth vanilla and finished with a delightful touch of chile heat. It is quite sweet, but not cloying. The chile adds a great counter to the aggressively sweet nature of this brew.
M: Thick, creamy, sticky. This reminds me of a milk shake.
D: I had to try this after seeing it rise so quickly to the #9 spot. I can definitely say that it deserves the attention, as it is both innovative and delightful. Many thanks to Jconhead1 for splitting this one with me. 1,030 charactersAvagadro, May 21, 2010

I am weary of beers that zoom up the top 100, but that ingredient list made me want this stout right away. I wanted to drink it fresh in case aging made the flavors die down.
Pours black with easily the DARKEST head I have seen on a beer. Wow! Almost as dark as the beer itself. Dark brown, like a hershey bar, with almost a red tint to it. A little lackluster on retention and lacing - turns to a cap, leaves a bit of foam. But, this head is so gnarly and dark. 
Lots of cocoa and vanilla present in the nose. Coffee and roastiness. Chiles noticeable if you try hard enough.
Rich, thick chocolate (fudge brownie-esque), roasted malt and sweetness seem to be up-front mostly. Very good vanilla bean and spiciness from the chiles seem to blast you randomly and are especially present in the aftertaste and towards the end. The spice even makes me sweat a little at times, nice! Alcohol is 11.5%? What? Really?
Mouthfeel is a decent thickness and carbonation is low, alcohol is extremely well-hidden. The sweetness and spice may be a bit much for some. For me it was the best part.
Well, for a 11.5% 750ml stout I drank this pretty damn fast (under an hour). It's very complex and I love the flavors, but it didn't quite blow me away like I thought it would. I'm not sure why. This is still an excellent beer, a must-try for lovers of the dessert stout and spicy foods. 1,419 charactersChico1985, May 14, 2010

Chili peppers, yea that too. Just make sure it's 12% or so. Sounds easy doesn't it. By the way, make it a top 10 beer to boot.
Hunahpu pours with a thick and viscous colapse into the chalice. As dark brown as possible and without emitting any light. The dark brown froath looks stained by roasted malts, cocoa, and espresso and is as creamy and rich looking as any beer imaginable- with the visual texture of a rocky milkshake. The head lasts 'til the beer's all gone. Extremely handsome and masculine to the eye.
Very strong roast early on with emphasis on espresso, charred cocoa, and nail-polish remover alcohols. No sign of esters or hops to the nose. Malty/milky with bold brownie and unadulturated freshly ground espresso beans. As the beer warms, the chili peppers release their capsaisen aromas giving yet another layer of joy.
Even stronger flavors deeply favor espresso and bitter cocoa. The cocoa and vanilla weave seamlessly with the deep and dark roasted malt flavors, making the burnt grains mellow and creamy flavored. Alcohols and grains form a strong licorice, cherry, and currant flavor that wasn't present in the nose. All the while, the chili pepper flavor sits in the wing, giving a slight sharp and spicy layer to the already amazing beer. Bitter from both the hops and from the strong roasted grounds; again espresso-like.
Crazy thick and creamy, yet quite easy to drink; lightening up just as the beer passes the tongue and making the beer very easy to drink for its strength. Thinned only by the alcoholic strength and peppery warmth, the beer never gets hot or fusal.
With every sip, I keep thinking that this beer's flavor profile (in a nutshell) can be summed up as a deeply rich cocoa brownie with freshly ground espresso added to the mix. But there's a part of me that thinks this beer is trying just a bit too hard. But I'm sure the Myan god will appreciate Cigar City's efforts.
Much thanks to RomaniIteDomum and BlueOkie! 2,061 charactersBEERchitect, May 13, 2010

Another review from notes:
Hunahpu!!
Dark black, viscous, and decent sized dark pumpkin orange colored head. Most interesting looking stout I've ever seen! I've never seen a head on beer that looked this orange in the light. 
First thing in the nose is chocolate, followed by a solid roastiness, and a touch of green chili. Hard to pick up on cinnamon or vanilla in the aroma. 
Wow!! Great taste. Huge, thick, creamy, chocolate and roast, lightly roasted coffee -&gt; cinnamon and vanilla come in towards the middle, with a very light pepper finish. Just a touch of heat, but the chilis really don't stand out too much, wish there was more -&gt; more integrated than anything. Sweet, sticky lips.
Huge body! On the level of BT and Ten FIDY. Almost chalky, dry finish though. No alcohol detected. YUM! Light carb is perfect. Fuck YEAH.
Gotta love transcribing notes word for word! 930 charactersKeefD, May 13, 2010

A: Pitch black with very dark tan colored head. Reduces to a thick film. This beer is exactly how a RIS should look. Absolutely perfect.
S: Smells like sweet chocolate with a little spiciness and coffee coming through. Hint of cinnamon.
T: WOW. This is great. Lots of coffee in the taste. Especially at the end. Burnt roasty malts in the finish complemented well with dark chocolate. Pick up a little chile and cinnamon in the middle. Vanilla comes through in the finish. Very complex flavors going on with this beer. 
M: Super viscous. Very thick. I love this mouthfeel in RIS. Not overcarbonated.
D: 11.5%....never would have known. Went down easy. Very little alcohol burn at all. Really enjoyed this beer 789 charactersboothbeer, May 11, 2010
4.66/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I got 2 of these bottles, so I'm not sure which one I brought to the tasting, but thanks to DosBeerigos and HeyOhhh for each hooking up some Hunahpu! And thanks to DVelcich for hosting a killer tasting with fellow BA stoutfest.
I poured this into my Duvel tulip--
This is black and inky, dark and viscous, motor oil looking beer. Even on the pour you can't see through it at all. This is the only substance Superman can't see through! This is dark dark dark. On a good swirl you see the tannish legs with slightly redish hues just coat the sides of the glass so thick that when it cascades gently back into the body of the beer, it looks like sand running down an hour glass. Great streaks of reddish brown lace from a nice 1 finger head of the same color. The bubbles are small and fine, very tight. Amazing retention, and though the head isn't huge, it remains for most of the drink.
Nose is pretty well balanced with some roasted chocolate and some sweeter vanilla notes. I do pick up some of the spiciness-- cinamon is there along with dried and seeded peppers-- not really spicy smelling, but the flavor seems to be there. The flavor of the chiles translates to the taste too, not so much the spicy heat of peppers, but the actual earthy flavor. This reminds me a little of a homemade chili recipe-- just toss everything in and see how it comes out. I can imagine this took quite a few batches before they found the right recipe on this, but they nailed it here. Such a great balance.
The first sip was big cinamon, which mellowed out to some sweet vanilla for just a second before the hefty cocoa and a little alcohol sting come into play. That boozy sting is where the chile peppers really ride in too. The finish is sweet and spicy, but in nice harmony. I still can't get over how well balanced this beer is! Huge roasted malt bill is great!
The body is one of the thickest stouts I've had. Huge. The carbonation level is perfect. Nice and creamy feel that is very easy to drink.
This beer deserves to be hunted down and traded for. If you get a chance to try it, by all means, pick it up. 2,103 charactersAleWatcher, May 10, 2010

SCARY. Did I screw up and buy used motor oil instead? No---it pours smooth, has tiny bubbles, and leaves a questionable sheen on the side of the glass :-) The head is late to appear, but it does appear, and it's creamy.
Smell
Nice. Hard to pin down what's there, but your nose says, "whatever it is, you MUST DRINK IT". There are so many attributes here, that I cannot discern a single one. 
Mouthfeel
Smoooth. One senses a gritty feel, but I believe this to be a mental illusion. The look of the beer makes you believe it is gritty, but closing the eyes resolves this. It is a very smooth stout in your mouth.
Drinkability
100% body immersion and ridiculously complex. It is as advertised, yet that common grimy aftertaste is non-existent here. After swallowing you get similar effects to having a small taste of diluted moonshine, that is it warms the paths as it travels into your stomach. Then---your stomach remains warm for a time. How do they do that?
Obviously NOT a session beer, but after a 1/3 pint, you start toying with the idea that you could probably drink more than two. This is probably the smoothest stout ever tasted by this reviewer. The closest relative I can think of is Yeti --- HOWEVER as much as I like Yeti, it is quite apparently the red-headed stepchild of Hunahpu.
After 2/3 of a pint, the alcohol, which was previously hidden by the various flavors, makes its appearance with a big "HELLO!, remember me?"
After a full pint, my first thought was, "Now THAT was a beer!" Having been sufficiently filled, I had no more for a few minutes.
Cigar City---you guys are rockin'!! How can you possibly beat this? 1,650 charactersWynnO, May 08, 2010

A: The deepest darkest stout I have ever seen! Awesome thick 2 inch deep chocolate colored head that slowly fades. Darkest head I've ever seen. Perfect!
S: Oaky raisin upfront blended perfectly booze. I get chilis, cocao, vanilla, and chocolate blended in the middle with deep earthy roastiness on the backend. So good!
T: Roasty, raisiny, booze blended upfront. Bitter chocolate chili in the middle with bitter hoppy vanilla on the backend. Sheesh, this is comparable to KTG with a unique twist, from the chilis, that I've never had in a beer before. It can definitely hold it's own to the greats of the stout world, WOW!
M: Super thick. Leaves sticky flavors bouncing around your entire palate. Very good.
D: It's definitely unique at first and the hoppy booze makes this one a little harder to get down at first. Good.
All in all, I am so glad I hunted this one down. This is essentially Kate The Great with a unique twist. The chilis bring some new flavors to the table for beer. This is definitely the darkest stout I have ever had and one of the best for sure, hands down! If you cannot get your hands on a Kate, then this is the second one I recommend you hunt down.

4.58/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled March 2010
A vigorous pour produces a very, very dark brown colored head that is four-fingers in height and just crests the rim of my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is inky, perfectly black and remains opaque and black in hue even when held up directly to the light. The aroma smells of a restrained mix of cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and roasted fruit, all the while being quite huge; meaning the aroma on this is quite over the top big, but there is a lot of competing complexity without the individual components not being in balance with each other. There is a touch of a salty, maybe peat smoke like character that seems to be a combination of rich, umami laden dark malt, perhaps some chipotle like notes (which is strange that this beer smells faintly of these smoked chiles when none are included in the recipe) and some general spiciness that is more wood-like than anything from the chiles. Roast malt character plays a big role here, but this is not nearly as big and unbalanced in its roast character as one might expect for a beer of this color. The roast character seems a touch chalk-like at times, but is incredibly smooth, with ample toasted whole grain character in addition to the mellow, deep roasted grain component. Ah, there is actually a hint of peppery chile, seems almost like green chiles at times; this last might be induced somewhat by the roasted malt. The vanilla is almost the most subtle ingredient in the nose, but the chiles seem to be quit subdued too; though I think some of the fruit character comes from the chiles. As the beer warms up more the alcohol becomes more noticeable and actually increases the burnt vegetal note just a bit too much unfortunately, but also compliments a peppery note that does work. And on closer inspection, the green note is not so much the green, burnt broccoli like note that some stouts have, but rather it is a bright, green bell-pepper like note that is really not objectionable; my wife thinks it smells like fresh cut green vegetables.
Thick, viscous and creamy as it first hits my palate, but some carbonation lightens things up just a hint. Huge roast malt flavors dry the finish out just a touch with some chalky notes, charcoal bitterness and a dry, rich dark malt character. Surprisingly this is not as sweet as something this sweet seems like it should be; the roast character helps with this, as does a really rich, darkly complex malt character, some smoky grain notes, evoked flavors of peat and the sea (with an almost salty quality), dark cocoa notes, and an Ethiopian full-city roast coffee quality that is quite nice. Rich fruit notes lurk just below the dominant roast character, suggesting flavors of black-berries, a big blueberry note that almost seems shocking, roasted dried fig flavors as well as some roasted prune like notes. The chocolate character is big (well actually it is huge) here as well, one definitely finds a rich dark chocolate character, though it makes me wonder how much is from the base beer versus the added cocoa nibs. Some spicy, peppery flavors start to emerge as this really warms up.
I like that this is thick and lush without being so cloyingly sweet. Rich, berry-like, dried chile, ancho flavors start to become more noticeable as this warms up as well. I like that the chile flavor serves a sort of "hop-bitterness" like role to this beer, it is fairly subtle to this particular chile-head, but I like the hint of subtle heat it adds as well as the touch of fresh chile character that is found in the finish.
I was fully prepared to not like this (though truthfully I was fully prepared to like it too), but I definitely do. It is quite well balanced, much more than I was expecting and truthfully I would have liked a touch more ancho and pasilla character (speaking of which, does this mean that both dried pasillas (aka ancho chiles) and fresh pasillas where used here, or are this two distinct chiles in the Florida / Cuban culture?), but in the end this would have brought the so carefully crafted balance of this beer a bit too far off. 4,090 charactersGueuzedude, May 05, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours thick, like used motor oil, with a temporary dark brown head.
The aroma is layered and complex without any one component overriding another. Rich roasty chocolate, ash, soft vanilla, charcoal, and spice all blend together nicely. It's actually a little hard to describe.
The taste is smoky with dark cherry, plum, chocolate and coffee, with a little sweetness mid-palate and the spice from the chiles comes in late and hits the sides of the mouth.
Slight viscosity and low carbonation work well in this stouts case. I think it would be weird if it were creamier or heavily carbonated.
Very nice, possibly a tad overrated, but worth a try for any beer nerd. 666 charactersbrownbeer, May 04, 2010

Beautiful beer, pours as thick as I beer I have seen, dark, black and dense. A super thick and sticky dark brown head slowly emerges and stays for a while, leaving some lacing behind...
Wow, really strong, complex nose. Slightly salty and spicy for the chiles, sweet chocolate and vanilla, roasted dark malts, some cinnamon and coffee...
Hmmm, tasty. Salty and spicy, bitter and dry at first. As it warms, it really mellows out and a very smooth creamy chocolate and spice flavor comes forward. Incredibly thick, vanilla and a bit of a dry, oaky, somewhat hoppy finish...
One of the thickest beers I have ever tried...after drinking it looked like I had teeth from the 18th century. Smooth and creamy, thick and coating, well carbonated...
Great beer, way too complex for my palette to pick everything out...one of the most unique beers I have tried, will definitely enjoy my other bottle... 946 charactershawks10, May 01, 2010

Pours like motor oil. Freaking jet black with a very nice, tight dark cocoa colored head. Beer almost seems to have the same hue around the edges from the carbonation. Just stunning-like a beer float with no ice cream. Deep aroma of cocoa, dried fruit. 
A great flavor-mild cocoa with a shot or 2 of espresso for good measure. Mildly roasted/grain like, with just a trace of booze to it. Almost an india ink flavor to it. Faint vanilla-it's there but underlying. Powdery, cocoa flavor. 
Great body-you could stand a spoon up in this.
Just a great big hunk of RIS goodness to me. Knew nothing about this beer until I saw the hype here. Was lucky enough to score some on a recent FL trip. The complexity of the different flavors might become too much in the long run. Far different from the Abyss or DL. Well worth trying, enjoying, hording. 875 characterslackenhauser, May 01, 2010

Mouthfeel: Thin and a bit over-carbonated

A - poured pitch black with a short lived brown sugar head that left spotty lacing. Deep garnet brown hues in the light. 4.0
S - Wow this is an intensely roasty and complex nose. I get hints of cinnamon, coffee, carob, and vanilla all over the place. Words do not do this justice. Intense and I cannot wait for the taste! 4.5
T - Very much like the nose but much more chocolatey. The roast is a bit subsided but is replaced by toffee and vanilla. A deep fruity sweetness rounds out the finish and the aftertaste brings a touch of spicy chili. A bit like Lindt's Chili Chocolate. 4.5
M - The mouthfeel was a touch thin IMO. It barely gave a coating on the palate, however the carbonation was nicely done. 4.0
D - Can't taste any of the 11.5%. Very flavorful and satisfying. 4.5 882 charactersDmanGTR, Apr 27, 2010

Poured into a snifter. This one is pitch black with a cinnamon looking head. Retention is lacking and so is lacing, but the pitch black beer with a reddish brown cap makes my day.
The nose is intense. I wasn't expecting the peppers to come out this much! I love spicey things and the slight chile pepper spice note in this takes this to a whole new level. Dark cocoa nibs, cinnamon and roasted malts, vanilla and cream and of course peppers. Super intense and I almost can't get past the nose.
Thank god I got past the nose, though, because this tastes amazing. The peppers don't come out as much in the taste, however, which is kind of a bummer (to me at least) but it's still great. Dark cocoa nibs, dark roasted malts, a slight heat from the peppers and a nice earthyness. Great tasting.
Mouthfeel is heavy in body, thick and sticky. Nice carbonation. Smooth feel. Drinkability is great.
Overall, not exactly a stout I will get to drink often, but probably one of my favorites of all time. The uniqueness is just unmatched by anything I've had in a long time. Thanks Kevin! 1,131 charactersMistofminn, Apr 27, 2010

T- A solid dose of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. Just a hints of bitter hops in the finish. Also a touch of spice in here too. Alcohol is hidden really well.

Poured into KBS glass.
Pours 1/2 finger of a red hued tan brown colored head. Fades down a bit, but then has great retention. Color is an oil black. Very thick.
Aroma: Tons of pepper, rich chocolate/cocoa, caramel, and vanilla. Too many peppers.
EDIT: the aroma in the duck rabbit snifter was way better. More cinnamon, less peppers, more vanilla. Very complex. Much better.
Taste: Very complex beer. Vanilla, rich cocoa, caramel, more vanilla, not as much peppers but still present. A light amount of cinnamon. This beer just has so much going on for it. The flavors blend together so well.
Mouthfeel: Spicy and smooth. Interesting. Full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Ends dry with some cocoa flavors.
Overall, a very solid beer that is well done. Lots of unique flavors. The chilies were an interesting touch to this type of beer. Decent drinkability as well. 937 charactersmothman, Apr 26, 2010

4.87/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A= Got this in a trade with Mikeyv35. Thanks Mike!!! Poured this straight into the glass because I've read it's a little low on carbonation and I wanted to produce a little head on it. The pour is possibly the thickest darkest pour I've ever seen. Usually when you have a pour you can see a little light through the pour at least. This beer... nothing. The head is a nice deep dark brown color just shades away from a black head. It rises to just a half finger on it and holds some average retention with some spotty lacing on the side of the glass. Impresive to say the least.
S= It's a treat to smell for sure. There's a lot going on here. One of the most unique things I smell is the chilis. They present a little smokeyness and a little "heat" in the nose. They sort of meld with the other notes in it so while you do notice them they are not really their own entity. There is a lot of nice chocolate in it and coffee notes. To be honest everything melds together so much that it sort of has it's own unique smell to it. There is nothing really like this beer in smell and picking out individual odors in it is very very difficult to do simply do to the complexity of this beer and the way the smells fit together like a puzzle.
T= The taste is just like the smell. Sooo unique. The chilies aren't as dominant in the taste as the nose however it's a different mix. The mix has a lot of nice chocolate in it. The chocolate is easily the most dominate flavor. Things are a little more easy to pick out in the taste that's for sure. You get a nice coffee flavor to it but not much. The vanilla and cinnamon that the bottle says is added sort of falls in the mix. The finish is nice and had a little bit of a smokey flavor and a little bit of chili to it.
M= Amazing! This beer drinks like a milk shake. Thick and creamy. Literally like a milk shake. Soooo chewy.
D= Really an amazing beer. This beer is a truely unique drink. There is absoloutly nothing that I have ever had that will match this beer. This beer is the real deal for Impy Stouts. If your looking for a unique elegant experience seek this beer out. 2,118 charactersjjanega08, Apr 23, 2010
4.41/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A privilege to try thanks to drink1121.
Maybe the blackest brew out of the bottle I've ever seen, with a denseness to back it up. Large well formed dark dark chocolate head sits on top for quite a while, finally settles to a nice collar and dense patch in the middle.
Given the description on the bottle and the wildfire reputation it's gotten, I wasn't altogether sure what to expect. On the nose it's roasty, dark, and almost sharp. Blackened grains give off a bitter aroma that's deepened by some very interesting smells - dark chocolate, leather, tree bark, and kind of an old smell of dark wood paneled rooms long hung with tobacco smoke and years of winter fires burned in the fireplace. Complex and interesting. Hard to nail down. 
Taste is similar, but a little more distinct. Definite strong smoky tobacco overrides chocolate (but it's still in there), with a sensation like a partially smoked pipe or cigar, some smoke already infused in the tobacco flavor, but without being too smoky at all at the same time. Coarse toasted bread holds the foundation, but it's enhanced with a lot of damp bitterness and and a dry raspy warmth, likely from the peppers. Becomes more bitter at the end, where the rawness of the cocoa also shows through with some more hints of leather, earthy soil and tree bark. Some hops are definitely present at the finish, but don't stand out as much on their own. Vanilla seems really mild and only shows some in airy flavors left after the sip. So much flavor piled on top of itself that it doesn't quite all show through, but it doesn't necessarily need to.
Feel is really quite ideal as a compliment to the flavors and style. Strong and full, but not too thick or too dense. Seems to be as strong as it needs to be without being too much. Not quite chewy, but with a rather enormous presence. Carbonation tingles and cuts the body slightly, with the bitterness drying it out some at the end.
Drinks nicely. A bit sharp up front, with very little alcohol showing through but plenty of bitterness and dry dark notes to keep an edge on it. Very little sweetness is evidenced, but there must be some in there somewhere to keep it balanced. Each sip improves the complexity and overall experience. Strong, and definitely not for drinking a lot of with any sense of regularity, but a fantastic one to have and to try. Excellent overall. 2,371 characterslightindarkness, Apr 22, 2010
4.71/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5multiple BAs have provided bottles of this beer, so I will just say "thank you Florida BAs" every trade has been awesome. 75cl bottle split between a close friend and I.
a- seriously, it pours so thick it almost doesn't look like liquid coming out of the bottle. a ridiculously dark brown head eventually reduced to a spotty film and collar. the lacing was light from the little head that was produce but the beer coats the glass like few other stouts. just a menacingly dark beer.
s- huge roasted character dominates the nose. its difficult to define what else is in there because it smells so strong of Starbucks like coffee. not you standard cup of foldgers but more like the newest vanilla whatchamachino. it could be a bit more complex and clean though, to be nit picky 
t- really a massive beer. the huge roast hasn't gone anywhere, but the cocoa nibs and other forms of chocolate are nearly just as big and doesn't let the coffee dominate. the vanilla isn't extremely noticeable until it gets to room temperature. at first it tastes more like it's been in an oak barrel. the big ABV is incredibly well masked. as the flavors stay in you mouth the chiles create a bit of heat on your tongue and back of the throat, but I couldn't detect them anywhere while sipping the beer. 
m- super sticky, thick and coating stuff. very subtle carbo adds to the desert-like feel of the beer. 
d- one of those especially delicious beers that keeps you reaching for the glass. nothing manages to overwhelm and my glass was gone all to quick. good to know I have more :) 1,564 charactersFreethyhops, Apr 22, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Decided to share this with a couple of buddies, as the cap was leaking slightly and I didn't want the beer to suffer. Poured into my New Belgium globe at around 50 degrees.
A - Black. Tar. Pours like old engine sludge, with zero light getting through. No real head to speak of, got a bit from swirling my glass. This beer literally coats the inside of your glass, not unlike the syrup in the glass bottles at a Dennys. Evil.
S - Very roasty. Tons of chocolate. Slight smokiness (perhaps from the chilies) and slight vanilla. Complex, but it's difficult to make out the individual aromas.
T - Dark Chocolate. Sweet, but not overly so. Very roasty, nice amount of depth was added by the vanilla and the cinnamon. Not as much chili flavor as I expected, more of a tingling in the back of my throat. 
M - Thick and sticky. Completely coats the inside of your mouth. Decent carbonation and no where near as "boozy" as I would have expected. Masks its 11.5% well.
D - Glad I shared it with 2 buddies, would not have made it through by myself. Flavors are really well balanced and towards the end it went down easier and easier, but I was happy with my single glass. Definitely a sipper.
Overall a very interesting and memorable beer. Would be happy to find a few more of these. Great to share with non-beer drinkers to showcase just what beer/brewers are capable of. 1,366 charactersjsanford, Apr 21, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours like old, dirty, chunky and sludgy oil that's been run a couple thousand miles too long through a diesel engine, with about a finger and a half of the darkest head I think I've ever seen on a beer. It is the color of extremely dark cocoa powder, and is nice and fluffy. As I write this, it's disappeared--all but a fine ring around the edge of the glass and a nice filmy fluffy foam across the top. Placid and still. Nothing as I hold it to the light--not even a hint, though as I swirl it in the glass the head seems to have a slight cherry or mahogany tone. Very slight amounts of patchy lacing.
Smell: Smelling something that looks like the oil I just changed a week ago can be a little disturbing. Smells of chocolate, mint, coffee and raspberry syrup--reminds me of the chocolates behind the counter when I worked at a Godiva, which is a memory that is just about as diametrically opposed to changing the oil in your car as you can get, I think. There's some bitter hop and burnt malt notes, flavored by sour cherries, raspberries, and limes. Smells slightly like breakfast as well--toast, pancakes, bacon, and slight smoke. Slight blueberries are present in the nose, as well as faint coffee. Vanilla ice cream is heavily in the background, and smells very much like a milkshake made with thick whole milk and just a bit of vanilla bean. A lot lighter and more sour/abrasive than the taste.
Taste: Whew, this one is heavy. I feel drunk having taken the first sip. That's not to say it's hot--there's only slight hotness--and there's really only slight alcohol apparent in the taste, but it's so rich. In a way, the taste is very similar to the smell. I'm getting creamy chocolate truffles still (which carry through to the aftertaste), as well as plenty of smoky, burnt toast and meat notes, and that creamy milkshake is still definitely there (though with far less vanilla than in the nose). And the cream is extremely heavy in this, which is interesting since the first notes you get in a sip are the bitter hops, burnt toast, and a bit of lime and raspberry sourness, as well as a syrupy note, sort of a cross between pancake syrup and coffee syrup. The aftertaste is creamy as well as providing bitter hop notes and very very dark chocolate truffles. The rest of the brew is dominated by cream, even when this is flavored by the heavy chocolate truffle notes--particularly coffee, raspberry, and dark chocolate truffles. It's now pointed out to me by a friend that the heat is more chili-like than alcohol like. I guess that makes sense, and now I'm tasting that a bit more in this brew.
Mouthfeel: I'm not initially impressed by the mouthfeel here, though I'm certainly going to be playing around with this number a bit as it warms. At times I think it could use more carbonation, but I think this would be a difficult brew to play around with. The carbonation that is there is voluminous, but composed of extremely small bubbles that disappear as you hold the sip in your mouth. After that, this brew is extremely odd. There's a very long lasting chocolate truffle aftertaste, and the thickness of the brew sticks around. A lot of times I would describe the mouthfeel on a thicker beer as "chewy." This one is creamy throughout, which is very odd with the heavy carbonation out front. And I mean creamy--once you finish the sip the cream lingers, coating your mouth, as if you had just drank heavy whipping cream, texture and all. It makes this one really hard to rate. That all said, I suppose the carbonation level is about right, though wow, what an interesting brew to try to work with on this.
Drinkability: Easily drinkable, and I never would have guessed what the ABV was on this. An interesting and truly great brew, and by far the best I've had from Cigar City. The flavors and scents at times blend in rather strange ways, but it's a delicious brew and overall works well. Major kudos for creativity. 3,944 charactersafausser, Apr 20, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Received this brew from ihaveyourkids and thought I better open sooner than later since there was a bit leaking around the cap. I've been pumped to try this one since I heard that it contained chilies and vanilla. Boner. Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip.
Appearance- Literally glugs an intensely dark black, perhaps the blackest and thickest looking beer I've ever had the pleasure of looking at. A beautiful one finger dark brownish red head forms atop the beer maintaining a ridiculously awesome cap and collar along with a bit of random spotty lacing.
Smell- The smell is a lot like Marshal Zhukov's as the beer is insanely roasted with tons of big malty char. Loads of chocolate and caramel spew out of the beer and are accentuated by a big bouquet of earthy vanilla bean. Not quite as hoppy as the regular version (maybe the chocolate and/or vanilla tone it down a bit) but I still get a nice herbally/pine sort of hoppiness. Maybe a touch of smoky pepper in the nose but nothing extreme.
Taste- Starts with an intensely charred roasted bitterness that is somewhere between harsh and earthy but still really good. The chocolate is very raw and earthy and mixes well with the vanilla bean. Speaking of, the vanilla is fairly light and sort of just does its own thing. I definitely don't get any cinnamon and the chilies are very light on the tongue in the aftertaste. The beer is plenty sweet though as it MAYBE gets a touch cloying at times. The finish is full of caramel with a fleeting glimpse of some sort of mocha coffee thing.
Mouthfeel- Big and thick and rich with an extremely creamy feel that is velvety and lush. The carbonation is light and spot on... Thankfully the slight cap slip didn't harm the beer's feel one bit.
Drinkability- Really tasty beer that is right in my wheelhouse of flavors. The only thing I wish about this beer is that the chilies were kicked up quite a bit. I want more of that heat on the back of my throat. Other than that, not much else to complain about. Really enjoyed this beer and thanks to Joe for sending it my way! 2,067 charactersyounger35, Apr 20, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Received this bottle in a trade -- thanks. Poured into a snifter. Beer is noticably thick as I pour, leaves legs on the sides of the glass. Beer is pitch black, black black. You can't see through it at the corners to through the thinnest part of the beer. Its just not happening. Forms a brown head, overall thin of smallish to medium sized bubbles and it leaves some lacing on the glass - although I think the alcohol is hindering the lacing overall.
The aroma is surprisingly spicy. I can get some alcohol, very slight, but I can definitely smell some chilis. This makes me nervous slightly but not too. The more I smell the more subtle characters of sweetness and a slight chocolatey bitterness come through. Smells good.
Beer is full bodied in the mouth. There is not a spicy / chile flavor as I was expecting in the beer after the initial aroma. There is a lot of roast in the back of the palate and nice carbonation / connectivity on the palate. There is some sweetness up front and nice chocolate based / roast based bitterness on the trailing end. No aftertaste to note and drinkability is high. I enjoyed it. It was complicated and some of the complexity is lost by the size but overall a very good stout. 1,216 charactersdrabmuh, Apr 19, 2010

The beer pours a inky black color with a brown, small head. The beer is oily and coats the sides of the glass. The aroma is roasted and burnt malt with dark fruit. The flavor is cinnamon, dark fruit, roasted/burnt malt, semi-sweet chocolate and pepper. The mouthfeel and thick and chewy and the carbonation is pretty low. 377 charactersMora2000, Apr 19, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours absolutely pitch black, ridiculously dense and thick, with a gorgeous mocha head. The head slowly settles down into a thin but dense cap, with excellent stickage and fantastic walls of lacing. Nose is roasty, light notes of smooth espresso and dark cocoa, bit of tobacco, and a mix of dark fruits and licorice. The taste, however, lives up to the expectations. Huge, deep chocolate and beautiful roastiness up front segue into big dark fruit, blackstrap molasses, more chocolate, and a nice smokiness. Alcohol emerges with a bit of booziness right before the finish, smoky pepper heat, and a firm, sharp, roasty bitterness that carries hints of burnt sugar. Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied, decadent, with a firm underlying carbonation. 745 charactersAnthony1, Apr 18, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I drank this from a 22oz bottle into my Orval glass.
The beer pours super dark black, hardly any brown highlights in the light. The head is also a very dark brown, however, sadly it only rises about half a inch and is gone right away. Light lacing. 
The aroma is on the lighter side but its vey complex, wish it was a little more robust. There is so much going on here, on the front roasted malts, almost smokey, then small notes of vanilla, and cocoa. The smoke might also be presenting as light ancho chiles. 
The taste is pretty good, lots going on as well. Lots of roasted malts on the front, cocoa nibs that are incredibly sweet with a hint of the chiles, very nice and unique. The finish is super sweet. Great to have a stout that isn't dominated by coffee, there's no coffee at all and its refreshing. 
The feel is nice and coating.
Oveall, this is really good, a taste that keeps you guessing. Its really hard to get an exact point of something, keeps you guessing. 978 charactersjrallen34, Apr 18, 2010

A - Jet black, very big stout looking. Very small brown head that dissipated quicly, not leaving much lacing, but a nice ring of brown bubbles on the edges.
S - Very subtle scents. Was expecting a stronger aroma from this, but it's pretty subdued. Nice roasted malts, hints of vanilla, and nice sweet cocoa. As it warms up, it becomes much more brownie like, very pleasant.
T - Little bit of burn on something, must be the chilis, although i'm not actually picking up that actual taste. Nice chocolaty malts, impressive vanilla notes, this is all nicely subtle and complex. Exceptionally smooth, with all flavors blending together well.
M - Very smooth, full bodied. Nicely thick.
D - I'll give it a very drinkable for a 11.5%. Don't get any alcohol, and none of the flavors are overpowering. 857 charactersAgentZero, Apr 18, 2010
3.8/5  rDev -15.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 1.5Lightly chilled bottle into a small glass... Many, many refills off this one. Thanks to HonusWagner for the trade. 
My bottle was filled right to the brim and it leaked in transit, but it was still carbed and tasted great. 
A: Pours one of the deepest, richest blacks I've ever seen in an imperial stout. It's capped by a thick inch of dark mocha head, with very solid retention, especially for its ABV. The final product is a nice collar on the brew. It's mildly leggy in swirls, leaving some residue on the sides of the glass. 
S: Cocoa, vanilla, coffee, anise. A mild aroma of roasted, even charred, peppers comes through. 
T: Very rich and vibrant. Initially I was disappointed by restrained spiciness, but it grows on me after a few sips. It's very cocoa-y on the initial taste, with a nice assortment of molasses, coffee, and very light vanilla (and that's only because I'm looking for it) complementing the flavor. I get mild anise near the finish. There's a mild peppery bite that carries well into the aftertaste (where I pick up some char, but not enough to complain about). Absolutely a top-notch flavor. Lots of things going on here, but the balance between the peppers, cocoa, and anise is very inviting. 
M: Full-bodied in flavor, though not super-viscous. A mild alcohol warmth in the finish is all that hints at the ABV. The flavors are oddly integrated; at times, they're very smooth and play off each other well, but some sips are dominated by cocoa and others by char. It's not a deal-breaker, but it's a flaw. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of thick, syrupy stouts -- i.e. they won't automatically get a 5.0 on mouthfeel just for having a lot of residual sugar -- but when the flavor has this much going on, I'm impressed. 
D: This is HEAVY. I tackled the bottle alone, and it took me over 6 hours to finish. It made me so full that it was uncomfortable. Maybe I should have split it, but since it leaked in transit (a major ding for this), I had no choice. Anyway, it's tough to finish and rather expensive, not a thrilling combination. 
EDIT: I've tried additional bottles since the first. This beer varies a lot from bottle to bottle. I downgraded the appearance and taste scores slightly to accommodate the other ones I tried. I recommend it, but with reservations. 2,296 charactersArbitrator, Apr 16, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750mL bottle.
Pours a spectacular suck-the-light-out-of-the-room black underneath one of the darkest brown heads I've ever seen in a beer. There are some boozy legs on the side as well.
The aroma is big and roasty with lots of dark chocolate malts and espresso. There is also a noticeable sweetness from the vanilla as well as some tobacco/leather notes and a hint of the peppers, though not much.
The taste is just as roasty with maybe a tad less sweetness to balance things out. Chocolate malts, maybe a hint of vanilla, but what stands out more is the pepper in the finish. Spicy, boozy and chocolaty all in one.
The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with low, but sufficient, carbonation and a very roasty character at all. Very, very dessert-like.
Having had the bourbon version last week, I think this is probably a step below, but it's still a great beer with tons and tons of things going on. Certainly a sipper so not incredibly drinkable but I wasn't expecting it to be. Great stuff. 994 charactersgford217, Apr 16, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Cigar City hasn't been too kind to me. While I really appreciate the chance to try them, neither of the Zhukov blends were all that impressive (unless you like 750 ml of tasty, liquid volcanic ash) and the rest of the lineup has ranged from "meh" to "bleh."
But, considering how this brew has shot up the charts, I had to have me some honey-puss! Thanks beeruser for this and the awesome shirts!
I sat down and prepared for this tasting by heating and jostling the beer by tossing it into my dryer in order replicate the tasting conditions that the brewer prefers. I then poured myself 2.3 oz (it almost touched my lips before I realized it was a mere 2.15 oz or so. I quickly corrected the amount).
Gorgeous beer. Stand-up-and-applaud worthy. Lustrous and black, it absorbs light and defecates darkness. Dark, dark, dark brown head ... one of the darkest I can recall, and it settles down to a pleasant dark foam crust. 
The aroma lets me know this isn't going to be the volcanic char ash bomb that Zhukov was. Cocoa AND dark chocolate on the nose, along with some dark fruits ... some interesting roasted malt/licorice ... maybe a touch of vanilla and molasses. Thankfully, no pepper/spiceiness to the aroma! I was not looking forward to that component of the beer.
Taste is also very, very good. Strong chocolate mixed with sweet malt mixed with a roasted background mixed with a lingering acrid aftertaste sprinkled with a hint of dark fruit/anise/licorice/molasses. And vanilla. I wish the vanilla was a bit more prominent, as it might liven things up even more.
Nice silky, deeply thick mouthfeel. Not as drinkable of a beer (of its kind) as Darkness, Black Tuesday, or a few others, but an excellent brew. Great job Cigar City. 1,740 charactersOverlord, Apr 15, 2010

I noticed a light tan fizz on top that disappeared fast, like Grease Lightning. Smelled different not like the uncle you rarely see, but more like a Mexican pinata before it is filled, not really but it sounds fun. I guess the smells are from the chiles? The taste is blended nicely with hints of nutmeg or cinnamon, chocolate (unsweet), the blend of chiles and finishes quite dry.

The beer pours as dark as night, as some have said, like motor oil. Very little head, what remained was a small carmel colored lacing at the top. Smells are overwhelming served at room temperature. Everything from coffee, cinnamon, and chille. At first taste, almost all I got was the coffee, with a hint of chille. The warmer it got, the more complex the flavors. It has a smooth mouthfeel, and I didn't think the alcohol really stood out. As this ages, it's going to be outstanding. 699 characterssmellody, Apr 14, 2010

A: Pours very thick and oily - very dark in color. A thin tan head sits atop the brew and a moderate amount of lacing coats the sides of the glass. 
S: Nice notes of coffee, mocha, chocolate, and a little vanilla in the nose. I did not really pick up the peppers in the aroma. 
T: A solid dose of coffee malt, chocolate, and coco nibs. Hints of bitter hops in the finish and I finally feel the peppers kick in with a little heat and spiciness at the end of each sip. This is a dark chocolate dessert in a glass with a kick!
M: A nice full body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty smooth going down - hides the alcohol quite well. 
D: This is a dangerously drinkable RIS; the 11.5% abv is going to sneak up on you and you won't know it until it's too late. I'll admit that I think this brew's rating is being inflated a bit by hype, but it's still a solid A for sure. 922 charactersMrDanno96, Apr 14, 2010

A - Wow...talk about motor oil. This is the thickest pour I've ever seen. Pours a pitch black...no head at all - just a collar of deep brown and some sparse bubbles on the surface of the glass. No lacing on the glass.
S - Tons of coffee on the first sniff. Alcohol is noticeable, a bit of chile pepper and cinnamon. Coffee definitley dominates, but the other aromas blend in nicely. Some dark chocolate blends in almost as an afterthought. Peppers must be more prominant than I detect by smelling because I can feel them lingering in my nose long after pulling my nose away from the glass. As it warms a bit, I pick up a bit of maple too. Really nice.
T - Wow...cinnamon up front and lingering throughout....combines really well together. Reminds me of some kind of liquored up dessert coffee drink. A bit of caramel...just a hint of pepper, more in the aftertaste and feel than taste, although gets stronger in the flavor when the beer warms up. Chocolate is also more pronounced in the flavor than the aroma for me. Really, this is like the greatest dessert coffee I've ever had. Flavors combine together really well.
M - Definitely full bodied but not as syrupy as the pour would indicate. Carbonation is low, but with enough to give a bit of tingle. A light peppery feel (but no heat), some alcohol warmth too, but hidden pretty well.
D - Really, really nice impy stout. Hype on this one is pretty justified. Wow - great beer. Really need to let this one warm up a bit to really bring out the flavors and aromas. Was excellent when a bit too cold out of the fridge, but absolutely amazing after warming up a bit. 1,662 charactersportia99, Apr 11, 2010

Ah, the fabled Hunahpu...Will it live up to the hype or is it a product of hype and limited supply?
A-Holy s**t! This beer really does pour like motor oil! Imagine pulling the plug on your oil pan after 5,000 miles and you've got the idea. Pours pitch black with a nice size head that is sort of a mocha color with a tinge of red thrown in. The only knock is the lack of lacing. Not too much at all, otherwise this would be a 5 on appearance.
S-Delicious roasted chocolaty malt with a bit of molasses, bourbon, vanilla, coffee and tobacco. Smells great.
T-Malty chocolate quickly followed up with sweet vanilla notes and molasses, a slight tobacco taste, and hints of dark roast coffee and cinnamon. The peppers come into play in the middle and become more pronounced in the finish, yet they remain a bit understated just politely teasing the taste buds. Wow, this is simply amazing. And this is 11.5%??? I can't tell it at all. The alcohol is extremely well concealed. This is not a hot beer at all.
M-Viscous and full bodied. Chewy, yet velvety smooth. Coats the palate thoroughly. Carbonation is perfect for the style. I don't know what else to say other than this is one of the most exceptional mouthfeels I've ever gotten from any beer.
D-Despite being a huge beast of a beer and its a sipper, it goes down almost dangerously easy. Highly drinkable for such a big beer.
One of the best beers I've ever had period. It ranks right up there with Abyss.

4.69/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Chris @ Freshbeer for opening this one during a recent outing.
We poured a small but decent measure into a snifter. It looked thick as all get-out, with some lazy foam. 
Not as sweet and alcoholic-smelling as I remembered when I had it from a fresh growler. It's taken on more of that signature Cigar City cigar-box aroma, along with the requisite big chocolate and coffee aromas. 
Again, I get big bitter chocolate and coffee. Chilies are still there, but somewhat less strong than I noted when I first had this. It seems less hoppy too, but I think I prefer it this way, with that deep dark chocolate taste and cured tobacco, with just hints of chile and hops. 
Once again, we're dealing with a thick, oily mouthfeel. 
Oddly enough, it seems somehow more potent than it did before, even though I smell and taste less alcohol. My modest portion (though I admit, I had a second modest portion) hit me like a jackhammer. Drinkable within this context, but I could in no way drain the entire bottle. Excellent for sharing. 1,040 charactersPatrick999, Apr 09, 2010

We (urwithdave and gtreid) started off the night by drinking a Kate The Great, followed by the Hunahpu, then a Darkness, a KBS and a Darklord, holy stout. But I am reveiwing the Hunahpu. What an amazing beer, the pour was jet black with the head a red in color, almost evil looking. Smell was malty, with coffee, cocoa and a faint smell of the peppers. You taste chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon followed by a subtle bite of the peppers. Very thick almost like you could eat it. I could easily drink this beer every day, if my pocketbook would allow it. 660 charactersmrstevens, Apr 08, 2010

a: pours a menacing thick black with a orangeish/reddish/brown head. I have never seen this color on a head- I assume it has to do with the peppers. A thin layer of the head retains itself throughout the glass and leaves dark bubbles on the glass as it goes down. As I observe the head, I notice cool designs of swirls from the contrasting shades of color
S:the front is a huge malty profile with molasses, cocoa, and coffee notes which is followed by a noticeable hint of peppers, the aroma is complex and takes on more character as it heats up
T: vanilla and molasses on the fronts followed by a huge chocolate profile as the peppers make an appearance towards the back of the palate. The finish is long and sweet and leaves a heat from the peppers. There isn't one flavor that dominates the palate, but so many flavors that harmonize quite well with each other.
MF: wickedly thick and viscous, a meal in a glass, very creamy on the palate
D: this is a luxuriously rich beverage with a high level of complexity. It is certainly worthy of hype as this beer is ssublime 1,166 charactershomebrew311, Apr 07, 2010

3.94/5  rDev -12.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Large capped bottle brought straight from the brewery by stoutsnipas, thanks!
Tried two different bottles, and unfortunately, some quality control problems seem somewhat obvious. 
The dark brown, but not quite black color shows a very faint head, quite different than the gusher a friend had described. Little to no head is formed. 
Aroma is quite pleasant, bittersweet chocolate abound, with some coffee, molasses, spices, a hint of bourbon. 
The mouthfeel suffers from the underwhelming carbonation, but still feels velvety. 
Flavors of bittersweet chocolate, dark fruits, coffee, some spices. Good, but the limited carbonation, unfortunately suggestive of some quality control issues does limit the overall enjoyment. 721 charactersbrdc, Apr 06, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is my first of 2 bottles from a trade with Dstructo. 750mL bottle filled to the cap line, literally &lt; 5mm of space between liquid and cap.
The beer pours out dark brown and opaque with a foam that is at first reddish-tan color, fading to mocha color. Thick thick head, leaving a layer of foam that never dissipates to the liquid line. The beer smells outstanding, an obvious perfect score. Dark roasted malts and chocolate, some vanilla and other unknown spice, probably cinnamon based on the label. Really loved the nose.
The taste is nearly as good as the aroma. It starts with chocolate and sweet malts roasted to the edge of burning. Behind that you get the vanilla/cinnamon flavors, and finally some pepper burn in the aftertaste. Ancho and pasilla chiles to be exact. 
Thick bodied, just as it should be, matching the huge flavors with a huge mouthfeel. Overall an excellent stout, I loved the addition of the chiles and cacao nibs. 949 charactersTurdFurgison, Apr 06, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured this beer into a stemmed tulip glass from a bottle.
Beer is dark brown to black with carbonation the creates tan swirls on the surface of the beer. The beer has strong legs that grab to the side of the glass. The glass had a coating of residue on the sides when finished.
The aroma was amazing for a beer. I also got the olive aroma, but I thought it smelled more like green olives. 
The taste was quite interesting. Strong bitter dark chocolate flavor.
Had a smooth finish without lingering bitterness. I got some sweet malt/ coffee flavor that balanced it out. Was not overly sweet like Ive had with other stouts. Very well balanced, made you want more. I liked the the mouthfeel very much. I thought that it could coat the tongue a little more.
This beer was great as small servings with a break in between. I didnt have enough. Possibly the best beer i have had to date. Definitely is my favorite stout. 914 charactersanycrew, Apr 05, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bottle split with friends for review #250. This was traded to me by a very generous BA who knows who he is - thanks!! If I've learned one thing from reviewing the last half a year, it's that beer is meant to be shared and enjoyed. In that spirit, we opened this one at room temp and poured into some open mouth glasses, each enjoying about 8oz.
But, I ponder as the beer sits infront of me...although I want to believe, the cynic in me wonders if this can deliver. A month of strong reviews from some very reputable tickers pushed this into the top 10. But can it really hang with such legendary beers as KBS and the Abyss?
From the pour, it looks promising. This looks less like beer and more like motor oil from Motorhead's motorcycle. Even the head on this beer is dark. Wow. If I wasn't so psyched to try this special treat I would have it framed, it's a work of art.
But wait. There's quickly a potential weakness in the defenses, a chink in the Hunahpu's armor. The smell doesn't groove with me. Something just isn't right here - yes, there's an amazingly deep dark chocolate and nice roast, but there's also some tin. Not just some yeasty impressions, my beer smells like it was luged over a rusty sheet of metal. Is it just in my head (nose) or with it also taste this way? There are intricate notes of vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon, but the tin is killing me.
Well, as it should be, the taste will be the deciding factor. And it delivers. The tin is gone. Thank the lawrd! In it's place is some of the most devine liquid I've ever had. A huge amount of chocolate and vanilla provide the base for such a deep, complex, and well crafted beer. The peppers are there, but they fade as the beer opens up. The cinnamon emerges and totally works. This is NOT a dessert beer, it's just a myriad of flavors all grooving together. The roast is devine, the way this one evolves between sips is splendid, and the taste is just perfect. A wonderful example of American brewing.
Mouthfeel is also perfect. Like drinking chocolate velvet. Wow, can't even think of a flaw here, this is the easiest 5 I've ever given.
Drinkability suffered since this is one to savor not burn through. But I must say on my 250th review, this is one of the best beers yet. Totally deserving of the hype, which kind-of makes it not hype, right? For anyone wondering, this beer has more in common with Chuck D than Flavor Flav...soul on a roll. I hoist my glass to the next 250 and look forward to sharing more great beer with great friends. That is, of course, what life as a Beer Advocate is all about. 2,585 charactersjampics2, Apr 05, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Well, this beer lives up to the hype. It's unique, it's different, but most of all it's great. 
Bottle was obtained from the brewery a week after the release. Poured into a tulip glass--the pour is motor-oil esque. Thick, viscous, a light brown surface--can't really call it a head. Brownish swirls. 
This beer has a nose like no other. The first smell is black olives. Never what you would expect from a stout. As I kept smelling and as it warms, it smells more of coffee and chocolate and the olives fades. 
Initial taste is very light and pleasant, with stout overtones but not as heavy as you would typically expect from a stout. As it warms, it provides a nice dark chocolate tang, with the finish very similar to--yes, a cigar. 
Mouthfeel is very light and pleasant. This is a VERY drinkable beer and although you will most likely take your time drinking it, you will enjoy every minute of it. 
This beer is well worth the cost and the hype. Top notch!! 964 charactersmoz9, Apr 05, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Purchased this one with the help of StoutsnIPAs, much thanks. 
Poured from a bottle into a snifter. It pours like a black motor oil and is completely opaque. A 1/2 inch dark brown head forms and reduces modestly quickly leaving minimal lacing.
The aroma is great with a blend of bitter dark chocolate, roasted coffee, a little less molasses sweetness and perhaps is touch of tobacco and vanilla.
The taste is as expected with a strong up from roasted coffee and dark chocolate combination. Some oaky vanilla notes pop up a little later. There is an interesting pepper component, not spicy but like a bell pepper.
The mouthfeel was full bodied. The carbonation was just right, now detracting from the flavor and in fact highlighting it. It is very smooth and creamy and leaves a pleasantly dry aftertaste. This beer changes rapidly and loses the carbonation making it an interesting drink that changes during the session.
Overall, this is extraordinarily easy to drink. I was concerned as two of my friends had concerns about it being flat, which it definitely was not. I can say this is a solid beer and well worth the effort to get. Let's see how it ages. 1,161 charactersSykDoc, Apr 05, 2010

Anxiously awaited this beer and was thinking of Black Tuesday the whole time I was drinking it. Hard to imagine a beer getting more hype this year than Black Tuesday so I was really interested to see how this brewery release would hold up against BT and some of the other high profile releases of the past year.
A - The best appearance of a beer that I have ever seen. Poured from a chilled bottle into a snifter. Pours black and oily with a billowing head rising up. Absoulte perfection all the way around.
S - Chocolate certainly rules but there is enough going on there to make this very enticing. Some small scent of molasses, vanilla, are also there but the chocolate and chili let you know that it is there.
T - Was on the borderline of a 4.5 and 5 for this one. Would have thrown a 4.75 down if I could have. Exceptional taste as all of the previously noted goodies come through. A layering effect as each one presents itself.
M - Great. Oily and smooth feel.
D - Hard to imagine that this one is what it is. You simply want more and more of it as you drink it, it is that good. 
This beer in my opinion slaughters Black Tuesday. The best beer that I have had this year. Can't wait to crack open another one. A great, great beer. Bravo to CCB. 1,408 charactersBeerisheaven, Apr 04, 2010

Reviewed cold from a bottle to a glass, thanks to Shango42 for sharing, let sit a bit for closer to room temp
A - Poured black with a dark brown head, little signs of carbonation but couldn't really tell
S - Coffee, vanilla, dark chocolates, no real hop presence in this brew
T - WOW, dry roasted coffee taste followed up with dark chocolate, vanilla and a smoke after taste
M/D - A big thanks to Shango42 for cracking this open, a great brew to have had, my first Cigar City brew and man I would love to have another. Sorry I couldn't pick out the chili like everyone else but the balanced flavors in this brew can speak for itself. A must for anyone to try, if you're a fan of this style then you gotta get your hands on this. A full bodied brew with that can be enjoyed over and over. 809 charactersFreshmanPour77, Apr 04, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Had to part with some KBS and Nemesis for this one. This little trade was set up on another forum. 
A- Now THIS is the darkest beer Ive ever seen. Pours inky black, absolutely no sign of lightness or clarity. The head is hard to coax out but even it is the darkest thing Ive seen. This is really unlike any foam Ive encountered. Its a really deep, burnt, rustic brown/red. It fades into a thick collar. I cant see through this beer at all. This is EPICLY dark.
S- Wild stuff, I can already tell. Intensely complex and intricate here. Raw cocoa, vanilla, coffee, roasted peppers and more. Some alcohol and faint cinnamon and licorice. 
T- Pretty insane stuff. This is a lot smoother with a bit of creaminess than I was expecting. Chilies and chocolate will always be a good combination, as long as it is done right. Hunahpu does it right. Starts sweet, chocolatey with a touch of roasted coffee and french vanilla creme. That breaks into a chili pepper, roasted red bell peppers, chili powder only not as spicy character. The finish has a touch of cinnamon and more peppers. There is even a very faint capsaicin heat, this is bolstered by a little bit of alcohol warmth. 
M- This beer seems to lose carbonation very quickly. The beginning of this glass was pretty bubbly and sharp. Now it is noticeably flatter and creamier. This isnt the thickest stout in the world despite what the look would have you think. It is, however, one of the stickiest stouts in the world. My lips and the glass are so sticky to the point of it being unpleasant. Needless to say this beer doesnt finish clean, but who would expect that from a big stout?
D- Way too drinkable for a big stout of 11.5% ABV. It goes down with out a fuss. It doesnt really even make you feel like you are drinking a heavy beer. 1,789 charactersMbpBugeye, Apr 03, 2010
4.71/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big, just-hit-a-grand-slam high five to moose3285 for sending this much-anticipated beer far from it's home town. We had a hint of this on a February visit to Cigar City - the brewer brought out a bit & we each had about a two-ounce swig - & I was eager to have an entire bottle to ponder. And here it is. Arrived this morning by FedEx, into the fridge, popped thirteen hours later. 
Split the big 750ML bottle with my wife, who was all about getting on this right away. Pours that absence of light color with a beautiful, shimmering brown head (I'm a head poo-paher, but this one was nice) perched like a bubbly afro atop the beer. Smell is wild. Charred malts, sweet malts, sprinkling of chocolate, & I'll swear, a hint of chiles. 
Hunahpu's delivers the goods. As the nose suggests, this is a stout that doesn't play well with one's expectations. A swig of slightly warmed up brew leaves one with the first impression that there's plenty of tastes mingling & having a good time, but nothing is dominant. The chiles are very evident, warming the lips, giving the beer a strange, non-alcoholic warmth. The chocolate is evident underneath the chile - and it's an odd, beautiful juxtaposition. Buried beneath these two are jets of moist chocolate, a dollop of very mild coffee/roasted malts, a line of vanilla, & the sweetness of the nibs blended into the cool malts. Wow. Just wow. 
Smooth, dark, decadent. Drinkabilly? Uh, yeah. I'd take a case of this if I could get it. I'm trying hard to pace myself & enjoy this while it's happening. 
Holy beer, batman. This is a masterpiece; insert superlative of your choice. I'm already a big fan of Cigar City, & with this gorgeous beast they've obviously taken their game to a whole new level. Amazing. Seek this out immediately if you are able. And thanks Mike, I owe you, good sir! 1,831 charactersmaximum12, Apr 03, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750 bottle paired with mole rubbed duck over grilled polenta and a spicy chimi churi sauce. 
A- poured about as dark as it gets, black as a moon less night with a bit of espresso colored creamy head. Super thick and oily so viscous it coats the glass. 
S- amazingly complex. First I'm hit with dark roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Then smooth deep fire roasted chilies and chared wood. The chilies show up as a spicy but earthy burn. Layers of sweet dark berries and mexican cinnamon. Bourbon vanilla mixes its way in the sweetness with some brown sugar and molasses. 
T- dios mio. This it the truth. Roasted everything! The coffee and chilies bust it up first and roll into the chocolate with such beauty. 86 percent dark chocolate with big tropical fruit and over ripe dark berries. The vanilla sweetens things up and brings a balance to things. Smokey wood and a slight nutty char deepen the flavor and bring it all back around. 
M- chewy and thick. Light carbonation that lends its way to a nice linger and long finish, and that's super fine with me. 
D- great I'd say. This is a huge brew in flavor depth and alcohol but this never get boozy at all. It just keeps me coming back for another sip. 1,215 charactersoglmcdgl, Apr 02, 2010

Glassware: Portsmouth Tulip
Acquired with the help of Zach(beeruser), thanks cuz! This brew poured like 10W-30 motor oil w/ a big two to three finger dark brown head. However, no pop when opening the bottle, I assume thats due to the bottle being almost filled to the top. Heavy lacing hangs on the glass and remains. Pretty awesome spectacle! The nose was of chocolate malts, molasses, peat, and oak. Tasted as you would expect from the nose, but with a finish of light vanilla bean, spices from the peppers, and a good hop backbone to balance. Extremely complex and became even more so as it warmed. The mouthfeel was perfectly viscous and chewy which is what I was looking for. This brew will tease you. Initially, you think you can drink alot of it, and really want to, but then soon realize that with the well masked ABV and thickness you cannot. This brew is really a meal in a bottle.
Overall, this is hands down, the best and most complete Imperial Stouts I have had to date. In my search for the Holy Grail of Imperial Stouts, this is as close as I have been. Fine job once again by Cigar City, this brew is worthy of the hype. If you have not sampled it you must seek it out! Thanks again Zach! 1,270 charactersmikeyv35, Apr 01, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got a bottle of Huna. Its been a long time coming and a beer I have searched for over and over again. Well the time came. I have been drinking less and less lately, but decided to go for a big one tonight. Ate dinner, enjoyed a fine sour, cleansed the palate and opened the bottle. Letting it breathe for a good while I proceeded to repeatedly pour it into a six ounce snifter over the course of the evening. Consumed on 03/30/2010.
The pour was gold, Jerry, Gold. Dark as night, with nothing, not a drop of anything coming through the other side of this beast. The delicate and evil reverse cascade of the deep chocolate colored head just sealed the deal as it rose up to nearly an inch it stays, never settling more then a couple of inches and leaving you just wondering how dark and rich can this possibly be? How downright dark and evil can it look? Just rediculous. 
The aroma was heavenly. Rich cocoa layered upon warm roasted coffee with just a hint of spice are what comes across at first. Warming though brings out all the subtleties and richness that I would have come to expect. Cinnamon and vanilla and fighting it out to provide a hint of sweetness and character. Each sip seemingly more complex then the one before. It is literally just a bath in warm, malty flavors. Chocolate and vanilla, a light punch of cinnamon all combine to form a complex richness that is at the same time as subtle as could be. Truly a remarkable thing they have created. One of the fullest stouts I have run across as each sip is like chocolate mousse and even at 11.5% everything stays very well hidden.
Overall sublime, everything I wanted it to be and more. I would have no problem drinking one every night and could be a happy man. One of the best stouts I have had. 1,766 charactersmikesgroove, Mar 31, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle into Bruery tulip, courtesy the ever-generous Greg (tpd975). Huge thanks, Greg!
Pours absolutely pitch black, ridiculously dense and thick, with a gorgeous, dense 1.5 finger mocha head. The head slowly settles down into a thin but dense cap, with excellent stickage and fantastic walls of lacing. 
Nose is roasty, light notes of smooth espresso and dark cocoa, bit of tobacco, and a mix of dark fruits and licorice. Nice nose, but far from exceptional. 
The taste, however, lives up to the expectations. Huge, deep chocolate and beautiful roastiness up front segue into big dark fruit, blackstrap molasses, more chocolate, and a nice smokiness. Alcohol emerges with a bit of booziness right before the finish, smoky pepper heat, and a firm, sharp, roasty bitterness that carries hints of burnt sugar. 
Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied, decadent, with a firm underlying carbonation and a subtle heat from the peppers in the back of the throat. Long, full finish. 
Drinkability is, surprisingly, pretty nice. Aside from a bit of alcohol heat, the flavor is massive, but I was wishing for more after my half of the bottle. A really beautifully done beer. 1,165 charactersJohnQVegas, Mar 30, 2010

a - Pours a deep, dark black color with one finger of brown head and a little bit of carbonation evident. Great rentention on the head. 
s - Smell is a mixture of cocoa, chile, chocolate, and vanilla. The chili was very interesting and gave it an almost fig/dark fruit taste. Very interesting mix, but enjoyable.
t - Tastes of chile, cocoa, and vanilla. Also some roasted malts. As the beer warmed up a bit, I got some cinnamon and some more of the chile. A very interesting mix.
m - Full body and low carbonation. Very thick.
d - I thought this was very interesting. It was probably the best beer using chile that I've ever had, and had a load of interesting smells and tastes that worked well together. Quite complex. All that being said, it's not my favorite stout. Don't get me wrong, this was a very good beer and I would love to try it again, but I felt, as did some of the others who tried this with me, that it did not live up to the hype surrounding it. 1,116 charactersmdfb79, Mar 30, 2010

Not too impressive of a head... tiny khaki cap, with modest retention. Dissolves to a tight ring around the edges. An occasional wisp of lacing left on the glass.
S: Roasted malt, bitter chocolate and a bit of vanilla. Nothing unusual and certainly not a fair indication of the flavor just around the bend.
T: Bam... one of the most unexpected flavor profiles based on the nose... large blasts of bitter dark chocolate, cacao, roasted malts, and vanilla... supplemented with an earthy smoked-woodyness... a little bit of cola... and of course the spicy chilies! Reminded me of Black Tuesday in the sheer monstrosity and complexity of the flavor layering ... not quite as enjoyable though.
M: Heavy... dense... with some carbonation to balance out... nice prolonged finish

4.76/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours lightless black with cocoa colored head that a slowly expands, resulting in cap that spans multiple fingers. The foam shrinks slowly, ever thickening and leaving copious patterns of lacing along the sides of the glass. Taking a sip coats the entire side of the glass. One-of-a-kind fantastic appearance. At first I said the aroma was the weakest part of this beer, but it has grown on me as I sip upon this fine concoction. Near every aspect of this brew is unique, and the aroma has mild peppers, cocoa, buttery caramel, and some meatiness/umami to it. 
The flavor is equally interesting with rich chocolate, complex yet mild peppery notes, and a salty, roasty, fudgey finish. There is an overall fruitiness that sticks around behind all of the other nice flavors here. Delivers a unique flavor experience. The body is chewy and slippery but also well carbonation, which fades yet stays active as I slowly savor this. 
I have had at least a dozen different CCB brews and this one blows the others completely away. Many of their beers are purely hype driven but this one is legitimately sublime. Cheers, Cigar City! 1,123 charactersvacax, Mar 29, 2010

Aroma was incredible coffee and cedar aroma, hints of chocolate. 
Flavor had an incredibly complex array of currants, plum, tobacco, pepper, and wine flavors. Overall, relatively sweet but this was balanced well.
Very thick imperial stout that drinks very well for the ABV. A fantastic beer that I'd love to get my hands on again. 511 charactersChrisPro, Mar 28, 2010

Aroma is dark roast, cinnamon, spicy pepper, some chocolate, and coffee. Dense mouthfeel. This beer coats the glass its so thick. Flavors follow the nose and meld together perfectly. There is a touch of heat that I sense in the back of the throat, but its not overpowering.

4.88/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pours so syrupy-sticky that it created a bubble between the bottle opening and the edge of my glass. The beer continues to coat the inside of the glass like wallpaper as I drink it. Pours black-brown with little noticeable velvety dark brown head.
S - Sharp chocolaty goodness, but doesn't quite match the intensity and variety of the flavor profile. 
T - The flavor starts out as bitter dark chocolate, then softens a bit with a lot of cocoa flavor. The vanilla bean is sharp and complementary, and blends well with a little heat from the chili that seems to reemerge with the lingering alcohol finish marked with a tinge of charcoal. I've enjoyed numerous imperial stouts, but none I've ever enjoyed had such a startlingly flavorful profile while maintaining a balance.
M - Velvety, viscous, and perfect. 851 charactersHeyItsChili, Mar 27, 2010

G - Chimay goblet 33cl
A - This is the most sinister and impressive looking beer I have ever seen in my life. Coupled with the darkest head of all time, a sort of black-crimson froth. The viscosity is devasatingly apparent.
S - The aroma is initially mostly dark and roasty, but as it warms and airs out the aromatic intensity picks up. Notes of cocoa, pepper, cinnamon and vanilla fuse at times and are completely separately discernible at other times.
T - The taste is nothing short of mind-blowingly phenomenal. Phenomenal! 6 out of 5. It is all its cracked up to be. The bitter cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, smoke, pepper, Mexican coffee, rich chocolate, cordial alcohol kick; everything about this beer is amazing, and presented in immense proportions. My jaw dropped when they poured it up, and I am now at a loss for words.
M - Many things claim to pour like crude, but this one really does. Like 25w50 after 500k miles.
D - This beer is good beyond description. Hence my woefully inadequate review. This beer is just ridiculous. 1,050 charactersktrillionaire, Mar 27, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I got to share a bottle of this among some friends the other night, as usual a thousand thank you's to hayes for hooking me up with yet another great beer.
We were concerned a little by the bottling, it had leaked just a bit (this was lucky for me however, hayes probably wouldn't have wanted to drink it so soon otherwise!). Once it was opened we were all impressed by the level of beer in the bottle, filled to the absolute brim - this probably explains the leakage.
I have to admit when we poured it I was initially worried we lost carbonation because no head was forming. After it was pured, however, the head accumulated quickly - this may be the darkest head of any beer I've had. It's dark. Really really dark. The head dissipates fairly quickly leaving a ring around the edges of the glass. And the beer itself is completely opaque, I'm getting excited.
Smells very strongly of super rich chocolate (must be the nibs) but also some very malty and roasty smells. The chocolate theme continues with the taste along with more sweet goodness - some vanilla and others flavors I can't place create a wonderful and balanced beer. The mouthfeel is tremendous as well - awesomely thick. Even after I swallow I can taste this beer for a good while as the coating remains. This is everything I look for in a stout and one of my favorite beers now - here's to hoping they make it again! 1,386 charactersAWolf, Mar 26, 2010

A- Probably the most impressive beer I have ever seen in my beer drinking life. Produced a finger and halfs width of vibrant, espresso colored head. With every swirl the beer seemed to produce more and more head. Poured out like motor oil. So thick that it stained the glass brown. Flat out beautiful. 
S- Restrained vanilla sweetness upfront. Sweet, chocolate malts with an undertone of cocoa and faint notes of chile...ever so slight, peppery attribute. Not as intense and bold as I was expecting, but still quite nice.
T- The initial flavor is quite lackluster. A little bit a raw cocoa and slight chile flavor is detectable upfront. Vanilla comes in midway through and starts to change the beer for an extraordinary finish. Transitions into a cornucopia of vanilla, chocolate malts, coffee beans, and the perfect amount of roastedness. The finish more than makes up for the beginning.
M- This is what I'm talking about. Thick, viscous...truly like motor oil. Coats the palate very well and leaves a wonderful sticky residue on the lips. Little carbonation.
D- For a beer of this size, this drinks incredibly well. I had no problem finish my sample and could have easily gone for more. 
Overall, haven't been impressed with CCB to say the least. However, this beer has given me some hope. If they can stay on par with this type of quality, then I might start trading for their beer again. Recommended. 1,505 charactersrhinos00, Mar 24, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into a DFH Signature Glass. Bottle shared with a friend.
A: Pouring this beer, I felt like I was peering into Satan's soul. It really is that dark. Rising from the fiery pit, I saw a dark brown head. The darkest I have ever seen. It sank quickly, leaving a rim around my glass. Holding the beer up to the light, there are no highlights. No garnet, not reflections, nothing. There is no escaping this darkness.
S: I got my first whiff while pouring. I am intrigued. Submerging my nose into the rim of my glass, I breathe deeply. This beer smells fantastic. The roasted stout flavor lies in perfect balance with sweet and spicy flavors. A wonderful aroma.
T: Much as the nose suggests, this beer is wonderfully balanced. It has the backbone of a traditional Imperial Stout, but with the essence of the cacao, chilies, and vanilla all working together. The sweet chocolate dances on my tongue while the spicy chilies light the back of my throat. The vanilla helps smooth the whole experience out. This is one of the most well balanced stouts I have ever tasted.
M: Thick. As heavy as can be. The beer needs the body, though, as the flavors are so pronounced. It feels great rolling around my tongue. 
D: I could drink as much as I can afford. This is my first Cigar City beer, and I can tell someone put alot of effort into the quality of this brew. I hope they can get their distribution and production to a level that finding Cigar City beer isn't such a tough (and expensive) endeavor. Until then, I hope to try a few more of their top notch brews. 1,560 charactersmondegreen, Mar 24, 2010
4.07/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Many thanks to the ever generous Dyan for the opportunity to try this tonight.
The beer pours an impressive looking, motor oil black color with pretty good head retetion, but with considerable sticky lacing all around. The head on this beer is a very rich, cocoa/coffee color that dies down fairly quickly. The nose on this beer is huge and impressive, with consdirable coffee, cherry, dark chocolate and a hint of licorise. On the palate, the coffee and dark chocolate really dominate this beer, and push aside pretty much everything else. While the mouthfeel is impressive, this beer is very monolithic, with the flavor profile completely dominated by the chocolate and coffee flavors. There is a hint of leather in the finish, which helps to counter the sweetness in this beer, but the sweetness, noticeable alcohol and slight licorise really detract from this beer's drinkability .
This is clearly a fine beer, but it just struck me as a bit disjointed and just too one dimensionable. The beer has a hugely impressive mouthfeel, with a mouthfilling, pillowy, very soft and long drawn out finish. Still, one glass was all I could do, and I can't imagine drinking an entire bottle of this at a sitting. Nevertheless, this is still a very fine, well crafted beer from Cigar City. 1,282 charactersJohn_M, Mar 24, 2010
3.7/5  rDev -18%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Thanks are due to Karl (kfsv034) for this bottle. 
The pour is seriously impressive, black with an espresso foam-colored head that recedes leaving no lace. The color of this beer made me smile, the last beer earning such an honor being Black Tuesday. 
The nose is just excellent. Heavenly with a heavily roasted malt character along with dark chocolate, coffee and a light spice character, there's almost a molasses-like character to this. Some fruitiness is present as well. Alcohol is noticeable. The chili character is quite low, much to my liking, the combination of dark cocoa character and the chili and roast is quite excellent.
I've noticed that there's a certain offset between what my nose experiences and what my palate does, and this beer is just another data point confirming that. What seems balanced and complex to my nose often fails the palate test, and this is no different. Opening thick and heavy with a lot of heavily roasted malt character, there's a touch of char as well. A little anise is noticeable early, but there's a grainy, husky tannic character. Prominent cocoa character is present. Vanilla appears mid palate, with the cinnamon and chili character being low (both of which could be a cultural bias, since I use quite a fair bit of both spices in my cooking and the moderate level isn't really noticeable to me). Finishing with a boozy sweetness, the mouthfeel is definitely flabby, not well integrated at all, quite disjointed, in fact. Full in body with medium-low level of carbonation, this isn't my cup of tea. It's not drinkable in large quantities, and doesn't strike me as a particularly well-crafted beer. I drank about 6-8oz, and was quite content. 1,692 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 24, 2010
4.09/5  rDev -9.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Although I enjoyed them, I haven't been particularly blown away by either of the other Cigar City stouts that I have tried (110k+OT and Marshall Zhukov). Nonetheless, I have been impatiently waiting for months to get a chance to try this one, and that day is finally here.
This one pours a thick, black nightmare with a towering cascading head that is as dark and menacing as any you will ever see. Awesome. Be sure to be careful with your pouring here, or you will end up with a countertop soaked in Hunahpu overflow like I did.
The aroma starts out light up front, mostly a dusting of cocoa and some bright fruity/metallic notes. As the head dies down, the metallic element thankful disappears as well. Whew...had me worried there for a second. What appears is a nice mix of milk chocolate, faint peppery spiciness, and floral hops.
The taste big, bold, and roasty. A hefty dose of bitter dark chocolate on the front palate with a coffee bean finish. I'm not picking up very much of the peppers initially, but they leave their mark as a lingering aftertaste. Most of the flavor here is the enormous roasted malt profile.
The body here is full and there is sufficient carbonation yet not so much that it destroys the creaminess. Drinkability is OK, but this is such a huge bitter beer that splitting the bottle would be in your best interests.
Overall, I definitely really enjoyed this one. It was not as complex as I would have expected based on the treatments that the based beer received, but in the end that is OK because it is still extremely flavorful. The closest comparison I can make would be a fresh Bell's Expedition. If the Hunahpu's ages as gracefully as that beer, then it could be something quite special down the road.
UPDATE 4/27: I had a chance to try another sample of this beer and it was NOTHING like the bottle I opened. It was far more deep and complex, with big notes of cinnamon and chile pepper that were just phenomenal. There must be a lot of bottle variation in this batch, perhaps the bottles were pulled from different barrels and not blended???? Anyways...I would have rated it probably a 4.7 or higher, but until I get a bottle of my own that tastes like that I'm leaving it how it is. 2,225 charactersalcstradamus, Mar 23, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ever since I read what Cigar City was doing with this beer, I've been excited to give this one a shot - I mean, a lot of stuff is going into this beer. The label says "Malt beverage aged on Peruvian cacao nibs, ancho and pasilla chiles, cinnamon and Madagascar vanilla beans." Seriously, that sounds amazing! Thanks to kbutler1 for trading me a bottle - my expectations are high! The bottle arrived with just a bit of leakage at the top (even though it was packaged perfectly and taped around the cap) - a very sticky, syrupy substance. Figured I'd better crack this one open soon - wouldn't want to waste it!
Split with a few friends and spread between three different glasses. As I cracked it open, it was immediately obvious as to why the beer was leaking. The bottle was literally filled up almost to the very top. One millimeter below the opening was standing liquid...beer! Cigar City did not skimp on this guy! I carefully poured into my Dogfish Head snifter. Whoa - that is an amazingly thick brew. As it stacks up in my glass, it appears that there is no carbonation...guh, disappointment...but wait! After I get the glass about halfway filled, I set it on the table and watch the upward cascade fill another third of my glass. From a vat of recycled motor oil to one of the thickest, darkest, brown heads I've ever seen, the bubbles keep multiplying as this thing nears the top of my glass - impressive. Fairly quickly it wanes, and by the time I've had three or four sips the head is merely a shadow of its former self capping the surface with a soft dark brown lid. The beer itself is a black hole allowing zero light to escape, even at the extreme edges.
Hunahpu's is chalk full of chocolate goodness. The chocolate malty smell dominates the nose at the beginning. A sweet chocolate rises through the head as well, making me think I'm about to enjoy dessert as opposed to a nightcap. No cinnamon for me but a bit of peppery spice when I try hard. As it warms up a bit, the alcohol becomes prevalent for the first time separating itself from a sweet vanilla and a bit of dark sweet fruit. A complex brew for sure that is only compromised just slightly by the alcoholic prevalence. Ok, I can't wait any longer to give this a shot.
Fudge. Sweet, chocolate fudge. It's pounded in there and is not shy. I do get a bit of the chili / peppery taste when I get the beer to settle on the back of my tongue. Again, as hard as I work to taste the cinnamon, I can't find it. The vanilla is definitely in there as well, adding yet another sweet component to Willy Wonka's wet dream. I'm very impressed by how well this is balanced. With a bunch of different flavors competing, things can easily get messy; but cigar city has done it right here. This is a thick and creamy brew that feels absolutely divine in my mouth. I rank the mouthfeel as a perfect 5, right there with Kate the Great's creaminess and the oily, thick, syrupy masterpiece of Dark Lords past. 
This is a damn fine beer. As I finish my last few sips, my glass is laced with a thin grainy film left behind from this viscous beer. My upper lip sticks to the rim of my glass when I get a bit too close. Although the alcohol was prevalent on the nose, it is nearly completely masked in the drink. I'm wishing I hadn't invited so many friends over for this.

4.48/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Finally popped open my first bottle of this bad boy, and pulled out a snifter for the occasion.
Total, utter oily black. Almost looks like sludge. The head follows suit with possibly the darkest brown head I've ever seen. Decent size to the head considering the ABV, and it retains fairly well. It settles into a ring with some filmy islands floating around after a few minutes, and then a while later finally disappears entirely. Once the head vanishes, you can begin to notice the garnett hi-lites around the edge of the glass. Make no mistake, though - this thing is completely opaque. Swishing it around coats the glass with a brown film. When it came time to clean my glass after finishing this brew, I had to fill the glass and rinse it out 3-4 times with water to get rid of the film.
The appearance perfectly sets the table for the intensity of this brew. The nose is strong with smokey notes, roasted malt, and bitter/dark chocolate. The taste brings even more to the table. Again, there's a fairly strong smokiness to this brew, but there's also other dominant notes vying for attention - roasted malts, dark chocolate, cocoa and then subtle chili powder. I must confess, I question whether I would have picked up on the chili powder notes had I not known to look for it. It's not a burn or sting, but there is an almost powdery sense of the chili there. Overall, this brew strikes a great balance in the taste and manages to show off all its different facets. The alcohol is completely and totally hidden.
The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Almost felt like it was coating my teeth. Carbonation is perfect. Great mouthfeel.
Drinkable? I suppose - but this is a heavy, intense brew. If you've got the room in your gut for it, you could drink this all night. It manages to be intense without wearing out your palate, and because the alcohol is expertly concealed, there's nothing there to set off any warning signs to slow you down. Definitely an experience.
Thanks to TheBrodie for bringing me back a few bottles from the release. You da' man. 2,057 charactersMavajo, Mar 22, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cracked my first bomber of Hunahpu's last night, consumed from my DFH snifter glass. I thought this beer might be contaminated at first, as there was some light seepage during shipping. Turns out it was just filled to the top, but was still good.
A- Black as night, and very oil looking. Coats the inside of the glass with a chocolate brown film. Pours a nice healthy head, probably a finger or two. The head is dark brown, with almost a ruby red tinge to it.
S- Smells of toasted malts primarily to me. Has some noticeable scents of chilli's and chocolate as well. I also get some slightly caramel aromas as well.
T- Tastes amazing. Starts with the taste of a very smooth and robust stout, transitions to a delicious chocolatey flavor, and the perfect balance of hops on the back end. Some of these chocolate beers tend to over-do it a bit, but this one is a great blend. 
M- I expected this to be a lot more overpowering on the mouthfeel due to appearance. However, it is very nice and tolerable. Not too thick, and certainly not as oily as it looks in the glass.
D- Due to the very tolerable mouthfeel, the drinkability is high. The 10.5% is barely noticeable, and I housed my first glass very quickly. After I finished the bottle, I probably could have had more...
Overall, an very excellent beer and lived up to the hype IMO. A very drinkable, and well balanced RIS.
** Update** After having this beer a few more times, I really feel like it is probably one of my favoriote beers. Amazingly good, and so drinkable. If you can find some, GET IT! 1,556 charactersGfunk720, Mar 21, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 mL bottle courtesy of ahatcher78 - many thanks to a great trader for a huge want. Poured in to a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a wretchedly, hideously thick black, just an absolute oily morass, seething and churning through the bottle's aperture in to the tulip with a huge, viscous, violent anger. My inadvertently vigorous pour causes a finger and a half of one of the darkest-hued heads I've ever seen to rise out of this beast, a chocolatey, frothy foam, dense and milky, with fairly good retention for a beer with this many additives and of this abv%. This beer looks fierce, no doubt about it. There's no hint of surface lace, and only a thin ring of lace and a few erratic, random spots of lace avoid getting swallowed up in the body.
Aroma: Chili powder notes are evident immediately, and they add quite a lot: the smokiness of the chilis compliments the smoky, toasted malt notes, themselves suggesting dark toast, black malt, a faint kiss of char, and a good deal of smoke; the spice compliments the cocoa nibs in particular, adding a robust, earthy note to the already deep, black, fudgy, bittersweet chocolate notes; and - amazingly, beautifully - the sweetness of the chiles compliment the aforementioned, too, as it does the dark toffee, the bright, ethereal vanilla, and caramel notes. Indeed, the chilies are the star player among this for me, though it may also be that my nose is "skewed" - I've always been inordinately sensitive to spicy smells and food, though I love what's happening here. Lest I forget the cinnamon - which compliments the earth of the chilies, the sweetness of the chilies and the cocoa, and interplays in ways with the vanilla that makes me long for a sundae of some sorts.
Taste: I'll get it out of the way that I liked - but did not love - Marshal Zhukov's Stout (MZS), the base beer for Hunahpu. I thought it was incredibly dark, astringent, and indeed, too heavily toasted for me. Hunahpu's goes a long way towards assuaging most of my dislikes about that beer. First, there's way more residual sweetness in Hunahpu's, though it isn't by any means syrupy or cloying - indeed, I'd still say it's on the dry side for an imperial stout, which is a good thing, both because it keeps things from getting tired and overly-decadent, and also because it lets the supporting cast of flavors shine through. What malts do I speak of? Black chocolate truffle, huge and fudgy, bittersweet is prominent, obviously the result of the cocoa addition - yes, there were cocoa notes in MZS, but the notes here are very brownie-like. Second is a handful of nicely burned and nearly blackened toast, slightly astringent and glassy in places, but on the whole fairly nice. A few other very dark coffee notes and malt-esque fruit sugars (thick, rummy raisins perhaps, as well as a few heavy berry notes) compliment.
But as I mentioned above, sure this beer is malt heavy, but it's not sweet for the sake of sweet, which allows the remainder of the notes to shine through. Sweet chliles add a kiss of actual spice - mostly in the middle of the register, which is a nice change to the heat that you usually accompany in the finish of a beer - that actually lingers far beyond when that chemical-ish alcohol burn lingers. The vanilla is still bright, registering fairly high up, but also augments the sweet earthiness of the chili and the sweet earthiness of the cocoa/malts. And cinnamon earthiness compliments the malts while similarly contributing a spicy note that compliments the kiss of the chiles. Throughout all this, this beer maintains no hint of alcohol burn (at least, that's identifiable separate from the chili heat), no surplusage of residual sugars, and no shortage of intriguing flavors.
Mouthfeel: As thick as you'd imagine from the appearance, with tons of residual sugars - despite the heavily toasted body - and a fair amount of carbonation making for a big, smooth, creamy mess, like a melted chocolate milkshake with, well, with chiles. As the carbonation dies down a little, it gets really decadent, with everything melding very well, though I do dock the half point for it being a little too frothy and foamy for a little too long.
Drinkability: What an intriguing beer. Complexity abounds, alcohol's nowhere to be found, and this one's incredibly complex and mature for its youth. I can only imagine that barrel aging could have done further wonders for it. An impressive "limited release" debut from the new best brewery in Florida, and one I was thrilled to have the chance to try. 4,533 charactersCrellMoset, Mar 20, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Poured during a BA tasting event. Great thick mouthfeel, maybe the thickest I've ever had. Nose is vanilla, sweetness, chocolate, and some spice. Taste is more of the same with dark chocolate, cocoa, and vanilla flavors being balanced by some spicy pepper notes. Kind of like drinking a piece of dark chocolate combined with biting hot peppers. Drinkability suffers a bit just from the enormity of this beer. Very memorable.
EDIT: Had this again, review remains the same. I noticed more cocoa and pepper this time around, and there was an oil slick left around the glass on finish. 582 characterssquaremile, Mar 19, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I want to give a shout out to Masterski for giving me the heads up that Cigar City still had some bottles of Hunahpu's left. Very glad to have the opportunity to try this beer.
This is one thick looking beer is my first reaction. The head rises from within and is about as dark & gold as I've ever seen. Almost a metallic gold colored head. Nice retention which finally settles to a ring around the glass. There isn't classic lacing, but the beer has metallic golden legs. Swirl it around and it literally coats the inside of your glass. Shiny deep brown in color and totally opaque. 
The aroma lets you know there is a great deal of complexity here. Sweet, chocolate dark roasted malt.... A touch of cinnamon and just a sense of the peppers. If I didn't know the peppers were there, I could not have pulled it out. But once you know, you can detect the aroma a touch. At certain points while drinking it I sensed vanilla, but that was definitely later as it warmed further.
A lot happening here and this is almost as sweet as Dark Lord. Dark chocolate at first, roasted malt second. Then an explosion of different tastes. Each sip is a little different. After you swallow you get a slight warming from the peppers, but no spice at all. Prunes, molasses, vanilla at certain moments. The dark chocolate is probably the most consistent flavor. There is a brief moment of ABV, but not hit at all. Very complex.
The body is about as thick as I've seen. Just shy of syrup. Again, I mention the coating ability of this beer. Smooth until the peppers hit and provide a little tickle in your throat.
Grab at least two friends to try and kill this bottle. A slow sipper and one that you should enjoy in conservative quantities. I really enjoyed this, but if it had just a touch more vanilla I think it would be off the charts. The body on this is amazing. 1,851 charactersReagan1984, Mar 19, 2010

Was poured into a nice CC snifter glass.
Dark as can be with a slight very dark tan head. Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and some sort of spice. The first taste is very different than any other Imperial Stout I have ever had. The taste is the usual IS bittersweet chocolate and coffee but then proceed with a spice taste. Also has a nice hop profile to it.
Medium heavy mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation.
Overall, this is an excellent beer that I could drink anytime!

A- Pours used motor oil. Blacker than black. A good inch of head that has nice retention. Leaves nice lacing.
S- Just heavenly! Big chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and molasses. 
T- If I wouldn't have had the apple brandy aged hunahpu I would tell you that Hunahpu is the BEST beer I have ever had. However, I have had the apple brandy hunahpu. Therefore, Hunahpu is the second best beer I have ever drank in my life. The nose isn't far off here. Chocolate, vanilla, and molasses. The flavors blend PERFECTLY! Just when you think it can't get any better, the chilies kick in and you get a hint of them on the way down!
M- SUPERB!! CREAMY as they get. Perfect amount of carbonation. Leaves me looking forward to the next drink.
D- I will drink this whenever I can. If you haven't had it find it and try it. The only thing I could knock on this one is the fact that I wouldn't be able to drink it all night/day/morning due to the higher abv. However, it is a BIG Stout...can I even really knock it for the ABV??? 1,181 charactersurwithdave, Mar 17, 2010

An inky blackness to the brew with a nice tannish head. Great lacing down the side of the glass. Reminded me of used motor oil.
Smells of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a bit of spiciness from the peppers.
This was an amazing brew and a good way to start my ratings here on BA. Nice chocolate flavor up front. Coffee and vanilla follow suit and a bit of spice right at the end. Just enough to not overpower the beer or taint the aftertaste. This is my favorite beer of 2010 so far.
A nice carbonation to the brew and smooth as velvet, just lovely.
This is an amazing beer that I easily could have had more of, but price and rarity make it a bit hard to just drink every bottle i have down. Plus I want to see how it ages. 777 charactersFringeBeers, Mar 17, 2010

Comments taken from my blog 
Alright this is why we came to Tampa. While I have had this beer before at craft festivals I have never actually reviewed it. Love the nose of this beer, it has such strong scent of coffee and cinnamon. It is hard to compare that odor, but it makes me happy. After first sip you can taste the cinnamon, coffee, and a hint of brown sugar and vanilla. Pretty complex and matures well while reaching room temperature. I would say slightly chilled is a great temperature for this aggressive beer. It is very smooth and easy to drink. Not an extremely thick Imperial stout. Wow...I'm really happy that I came to Tampa and am able to pick up some bottles of this beer. I personally think it is going to become AMAZING over time. 863 charactersDosBeerigos, Mar 15, 2010

A: Pours motor oil black with a nice tan head. Good retention.
S: Slightly sweet and lots of chocolate. The cinnamon, vanilla and chiles are subtle but you can pick them up. Wonderful.
T: Serious chocolate up front followed by the cinnamon and vanilla. I realized that the warmth I was getting was from the chiles and not necessarily the alcohol. Wow, I'm not sure if I have experienced so much going on in a beer. Given all the flavors in this beer it is extremely well balanced. One of the better i've had for this style.
M: Thick, very smooth and chewy. Low carbonation.
D: Very drinkable given the ABV. Could have a couple but i'm sure it sneaks up on you. Glad I picked up a few 750's to age and enjoy later.

A: Pours a very viscous dark, dark brown with a very nice tan head with plenty of lacing.
S: Whoa, lots going on here. Everything is almost overpowering, yet fits so well together. Lots of chocolate up front, followed by more subtle hints of roasted malt, vanilla, roasted chilis, and cinnamon. 
T: Even better than the nose. Right up there with the absolute best imperial stouts I'd had; definitely top three. All that's there in the nose is there with the first sip, and the complexity of this beer only improves with each sip as it gets a bit warmer. The chocolate is definitely the base, and the light touches of cinnamon, vanilla, and chili peppers are fantastic and make this such a well-rounded beer. 
M: Very thick and huge. Nice and chewy, yet incredibly smooth. Fairly low carbonation, but entirely appropriate. No alcohol heat.
D: Insane. Each sip brings forth new nuances. I spent less than 16 hours in Tampa, waking up a 3:00am on consecutive days for early flights (one of which didn't pan out), and if I hadn't gotten bottles, I'd still be supremely happy and thought the whole trip worth it. 1,213 charactersThorpe429, Mar 13, 2010

4.75/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5CCB knocked it out of the park. Phenomenal beer. Thick, dark, aromatic, and extremely complex. Chocolate and chili peppers are a classic combo, and though I've had this combo many times in a variety of beer styles, never have I had it in a IS. And it really works and adds a new level of complexity to the already fabulous Zhukov. 
Tried the Brandy and Bourbon BA versions as well, but the stock brew was by far my favorite... added alcohol and boozy notes from the barrels simply overwhelm the subtleties of this amazing brew. 528 charactersjwjon1, Mar 13, 2010

A - Pours black, tan head (a fingers-worth), good retention, and some lacing along the sides of the glass. A slim cap of head on top.
S - Very pronounced chocolate, some chili spices (not overpowering though), vanilla, dark fruits.
T - Lots of chocolate on the palate. Very very chocolatey rich mixed in with some chili notes. Somehow, for me, the combo works. I've never had a stout with such a real pronounced chocolate notes. Sweet and spicy finish.
M - Full bodied, rich, smooth, light carbonation. 
D - I drank several pours and it was just as good (if not better) after every pour. I'm looking forward to trying this in the bottle to see if it differs at all. The hype on this one is well-deserving. Possibly my favorite Imperial Stout I've ever had (beats Bell's Black Note, IMO). 977 charactersSean9689, Mar 08, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had it on tap at Cigar City yesterday...btw, love the new digs!!!
A: Used motor oil is light compared to this beer. When I saw it coming out of the tap, I could only think of Hershey chocolate syrup! The head was dark; about a finger thick and faded quickly, however, it left a nice sticky residue on my glass.
S: Coffee, chocolate, molasses and some licorice. At first pour the aroma was not as strong as I thought it would be, but as it sat on my glass it grew stronger.
T: The first sip knocked my shoes off...the chocolate hit me like an Amtrak train, then coffee, peppers and faint vanilla rounded things up. As far as after taste, I love the sweetness it leaves behind, and the vanilla feels almost like mild licorice. YUM!
M: It is creamy and full body, chewy almost...someone should make a candy bar out of this wonderful elixir of the Gods!
D: This beer is scary good...after all, the 11% ABV is so well hidden that if the first sip knocks your shoes off, after a few glasses you will be walking home barefoot and wondering where you left your shoes.
This beer is special, not for sessions though. I think Hunahpu would make a great dessert beer, I could have this with a slice of Black Forest cake!!! AWESOME BREW GUYS!!!

3.56/5  rDev -21.1%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Tasted on 2/18/10 at Big Z Beverage in Huntington NY during an in-store event.
This is the Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout with the addition of Pasillo and Ancho peppers along with vanilla, cinnamon and cocoa.
Draught beer poured by the brewer into a plastic cup. 
Pours an ink black but unlike the straight Zhukov, there is a small tan head. Huge nose consisting of Bourbon aromas with licorice, chilies and chinese herbs. Smells exotic, like walking into some strange shop in Chinatown.
Big Bourbon-like alcohol heat. Rich and oily with tons of spice and bitterness. Flavors of charred wood and tobacco mix well with cocoa and spices. These flavors will stay on your palate for a long time. In fact, if you wish to taste anything else after Hunahpu's you will have to make a conscious effort to cleanse the palate. This beer has a ton of character. It is definitely an artisan product. 891 charactersMikeGill, Mar 05, 2010

On tap at Brewvival, huge thanks to COAST and the Charleston Beer Exchange for doing an incredible job. Charleston is becoming a serious beer town thanks to Scott and Rich at CBX in particular.
A: Almost black, with a beautiful dark mahogany at the edges. Dark crimson legs. Wondeful and unique.
S: The usual with bits of chocolate and a touch of cayenne pepper/chilis.
T: Amazing. Creamy, roasty, incredibly well integrated, with little spice and lots of chocolate. Shockingly good.
D: I managed about 4 or 5 five oz pours throughout the day. It was wonderful every time.
I love this beer. At first I was excited because I wouldn't have to trade to try it. Now I know I will have to trade for some because it is a top 5 beer for me. 749 charactersmd655321, Mar 01, 2010

A: Black body, somewhat brownish in the light, with a dark dark brown head
S: Big chocolate, coffee, vanilla, salami smoke, and caramel.
T: Huge chocolate: dark, but not too dark. Coffee and sweeet caramel complement well, along with some nice touch of smoke. Rounding it out perfectly is a good dose of cardamom. Brilliant. Unlike some other big stouts with big flavors, everything here comes together perfectly. Right proportions, right balance. Wow.
M: Full, with layers upon layers of flavor, a slight alcohol burn, and a long-lasting finish.
D: This is the perfect stout. Huge flavors, subtle flavors, big body. The only knock is that it's so understated in its strength that it can really get ahead of you, if that's a knock. 782 charactersdudecandle, Feb 18, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this one at Rattle n Hum during their CCB brings everything event 2/17. Served out of a wine glass because they ran out of glassware. 
A: Served with no head. Beer is opaque black, like a purified motor oil, premium grade! Leaves stringy lacing that eminates from the surface of the brew.
S: Smoky dark chocolate and cocoa are very apparent in the nose. Coffee aroma is strinkingly missing replaced by a very unique and pleasant chili spiciness that tempts the nose and beckons it closer. Flavors are not overwhelming though and in fact, quite subtle, which is why I dock this a bit for the style. 
T: Opens with a milk/dark roasted chocolate. Cocoa is apparent as is a subtle roasted malt bill. These flavors feel like they've been meshed together and smoothed out with a sandblaster, they blend so well. End is a unique sweet spiciness akin to a sugared red chili pepper... sounds weird, but oh so very good. Finish is very clean for an imperial stout. No stickiness, no real apparent lingering flavors. 
M: Medium to full bodied, very low carbonation and as silky smooth as silky smooth can get. Completely clean in the mouth and leaves no oily residue or sticky aftertaste. Finish is a bit dry and does not linger at all. It's as if this beer is made of liquified satin. 
D: Some beers are rated highly due to hype. Some beers create hype by being good. CCB Hunahpu is in a class of its own. I just had this about 2 hours ago and I can't wait to have more. The smoothest, most drinkable, and most unique IS that I've ever had by a mile. I'd give this a 6 if I could. Deserving of everything that's been said about it. 1,630 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 18, 2010

Smell is roasted malt, fruitcake (wheat and alcohol soaked dark fruit), vanilla and a hint of nuts.
Taste is all that the nose delivers and ginger, hops and smoke. Alcohol present but not obvious or overbearing. Great balance.
Full bodied and extraordinarily creamy. Smooth like velvet or a baby's butt (bad image?). Alcohol warming with a slightly dry finish. You must drink this if the opportunity presents itself. No arguing. 545 charactersPorterLambic, Feb 02, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Growler shared by HOPSHUNTER - thanks!
Pours black with a one-finger dark brown head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving solid lacing.
Smells amazing. Vanilla and smooth chocolate notes meet up with deep and dark malt flavors with just a hint of underlying heat. Tying everything together are hints of cinnamon. What really seals the deal for me in the aroma department is not what is included but in what levels it's included. Everything present plays off of each other perfectly.
Tastes great. Roasted malt flavors and robust dark chocolate kick things off and are joined shortly by mild hints of vanilla. The vanilla serves to sweeten things up a bit until near the end of the sip when an earthy heat that builds on itself enters into things and carries through to a mildly bitter ending. The cinnamon doesn't make nearly as much impact as it does on the nose.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a very smooth thickness with soft carbonation.
Drinkability is great. I finished my glass absurdly quickly and could easily have five more trying to dissect everything going on in this beer.
Overall this is one of the most well done and interesting beers I can remember having. I look forward to trying this again someday and hoping that it's as good as I remember it being. Do yourself a favor and make it a point to try this beer. 1,351 charactersglid02, Feb 01, 2010

A - Appearance was black with a thin brown head that dissipated quickly
S - Vanilla, coffee, chocolate and a cinnamon like smell probably from the chillies 
T - Amazing, Goes trough 4 different distinct flavors vanilla, coffee, chocolate and the chillies on the backend. Honestly I didn't think this would be as wonderful as it was. I thought the chillies would be to much but they made it just perfect. 
M - Creamy
D - At the high ABV of 11.5% the alcohol is masked extremely well.

A- Pour a thick black with a light dark brown head.
S-Vanilla and light chocolate hit the nose first then some roasted malts.
T-Again big vanilla. Then roasted malts come in with some chocalate (not dark, but not milk either). No bitterness present. Great flavor. You cant really taste the chili peppers at all. No heat either.
M-Very creamy, and kinda hot. I didnt taste the peppers, but about 1/3 done witht he beer and you start to feel a slight burn, a good burn down your throat. Not an alcohol burn tho, a hot pepeper burn.
D-For and 11.5% beer, you cant taste the alcohol at all. If I were to guess, I would have said 7%. This is one great beer, I could have a ton of these, until I started to stagger across the room. Best beer I have had to date. PERIOD. 819 charactersdrink1121, Jan 20, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I was really looking forward to trying this beer at the Cock & Bull Pub's Cigar City night.
It's black, of course, with a foamy dark brown head.
It smells of chocolate and coffee.
The taste is very chocolaty. With the creamy body it's very much like a beer-chocolate milkshake. But that's not all. There is also a nice chili spice. It's not hot; instead the beer has just a twang of heat. Very good. There is no hint of the high alcohol level, so beware.
The body is super-creamy. It's the creamiest beer I can remember.
An excellent beer. It's one of Cigar City's best, and that's saying a lot. 600 charactersShaw, Dec 17, 2009

The nose is very interesting. It was a bit muddled at first when too cold, but when allowed to adequately warm it became very complex. I noticed cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, and a distinct spiciness borrowed from the ancho and pasillo peppers. The amalgamation of these various oddities is surprisingly alluring.
The flavor is as delicious as the aroma, if not better. Notes of vanilla, chocolate, aromatic cinnamon, and chile peppers combine beautifully. Andrew commented on coconut, and I must say that I get a dash of that. The spiciness is subtle at first but becomes more apparent with warming. The accretion makes for a pleasantly spicy finish to add to the vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon. A whisper of alcohol is apparent at the end. Carbonation is at a low moderate level, and the mouthfeel is full, smooth, and slightly sticky. 
This is excellent stuff, and definitely the best I've had from Cigar City. I've upped mouthfeel to a 5 to reflect what I believe to be a more accurate overall score. 1,132 charactersHopHead84, Dec 16, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4From notes
The look is a light weight of motor oil. A light brown head diminishes to a persistent skim atop this opaque beauty. Just the look for a big stout, nice.
The smell is a medium aroma of all the different burnt and bitter flavors one expects in a stout, but more of them, joined here with spicy notes, maybe clove or cinnamon, and behind it all, not at all overpoweringly, is the chile. It is a marvelous bouquet, complex, somehow balanced, full of the darker side of wonderful flavor.
The sip is an immediate jolt of taste, sharp, creamy, rich, bitter, smoky, all at once. It starts full of these blackest roast flavors, burnt sugar, bitter chocolate, darkest roast coffee, pure herbal bitter into a finish that finally crescendoes on notes of spice and hot pepper. Crazy complexity here. Each sip gets better, the coffee and bitter chocolate grow, the spice blends, the peaks in the sip ascend. I feel like I am drinking flavors I've never tasted. The chile doesn't overpower, making this flavor, this finish, bold, clean, dark, lasting, and mind blowing. Incredibly good.
Mouthfeel is not the thickest of this style, but holds its own. Carbonation is tastefully low, but lasts through the glass, and compliments well. Very pleasant feel here, not artificial at all, supporting the flavor profile quite well. Nice.
Drinkability rating for a stout strikes me as somewhat moot, always has, but this stout is a sipper of cautionary proportion in every way possible.
Impression: Complex and dark and delicious. This is a must try. 1,543 characterscavedave, Dec 10, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Mini-growler shared by nickd717 at a recent Cigar City tasting. Thanks for sharing this rarity, Nick.
The pour was black, tar-like and completely opaque, topped by a head that was a shade or two lighter than black. The color made me dread that this was going to be another burnt, acrid Cigar City imperial stout.
The aroma alleviated my fears somewhat as a huge bouquet of chocolate and cinnamon wafted up from the glass. Hot pepper and alcohol stung my nostrils, while vanilla brought a balancing sweetness. Beneath it all was the signature of Cigar City - burnt things, tar pit and fresh asphalt.
The taste, sweet and chocolatey up-front, spicy both from cinnamon and hot peppers - truly like drinking a blend of stout and xocolatl. Despite the almost excessive use of adjuncts, the base beer shines through with its heavily roasted, nearly burnt malt character. Sweetness from the chocolate and vanilla balance the bitterness with surprising finesse, never quite becoming cloying despite its richness. The finish reveals flavors of French roast coffee and burnt toast, and just when you think it's done the heat from the peppers coat the palate, leading into an aftertaste of cinnamon and chiles.
Well, they finally did it. That's right; Cigar City made a good beer. I know, I'm surprised too. This is good stuff, I might even track down a bottle when they come out next year.
Edit: Had this from a bottle, not as good, though still solid. 1,447 characterslargadeer, Nov 30, 2009

Slow, cascading head with a head of espresso dark brown. A solid finger of head with some little fizzy bubbles up top. Good retention with some occasional lacing left on the sides.
Aromatic woody whiffs of cedar & oak with sweet tobacco and cold pressed french roast. Noticeable vanilla
I get the wood and caramel on the nose, but I am also getting a puzzling fruit flavor. The only way I can describe it is the taste of a whiskey soaked cherry- not sweet-sweet but a very complex sweet with something on top. However, I don't detect any other whiskey in the glass. Big coffee flavor up front also, bitter cocoa nibs. Complex chocolate going on, somewhat spicy. Rich and oily mouthfeel. Finishes bitter, woody with big roasted graininess. Cinnamon & ancho (really?) also detected on the palate. Wow...this is something else unlike I have yet to taste in a big stout. With all of this going on, this one is very drinkable. 990 charactersRustyDiamond, Nov 22, 2009

Pours pitch black and pretty viscous with a creamy tan head that has some large bubbles.
Amazing aroma - chocolate, spices, roast, smoke, and mild chili peppers. Really awesome.
Flavor is incredible and moves through several phases. Starts with semi-sweet chocolate then roast and coffee, followed by some smoke, vanilla, then chili peppers, cinnamon, wood and bitter cocoa and hops on the finish. The complexity is pretty crazy.
Medium full on the palate with a bitter cocoa chalkiness. Bitterness really sticks with you, and I feel like it's more from the cocoa than the hops.
Drinkability is not great, but I think this works very well as a sipper. This is pretty much the best cigar beer ever. 788 charactersnickd717, Nov 21, 2009

Smell: Dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, tobacco, black cherry, and cinnamon red hots
Taste: Dark fruit and chocolate, up front, with a growing red hot cinnamon flavor that brings in a smoked chili aspect by mid-palate; after the swallow, the tobacco enters the profile and the heat builds; the chocolate and dark fruit flavors underneath refuse to fold and stand up into the finish with an underlying cherry sweetness; the hops also make an appearance, late, and add a bitter element 
Mouthfeel: Full body with low to moderate carbonation

Pours an opaque dark brown clear and bright at the edges. No head to speak of, just a thin tan skein of bubbles that retreats to the circumference of the glass. The smell is something sweet like cherry juice, flowers, sulfured molasses, cayenne, and alcohol burn. The taste is complex: roasted malts, coffee, molasses, cocoa, graham cracker, a burn from the chilies at the end, especially with a big mouthful. It's full in the mouth, quite viscous, mildly carbonated. Rich and heavy, it's a sipper for sure. 650 charactersgory4d, Nov 16, 2009

The beer is awesomely black. No head. Mysterious.
In the nose you get chocolate, chili, some cinnamon, and a few other smells I can't identify. The smell adds to the mystery.
Only in your mouth can you truly appreciate the complexity of this beer. The layers of flavor are nothing short of astonishing. So much going on that every sip is a new experience. Wow.
In the mouth it is a smooth, creamy, well-balanced treat. Almost velvety.
This is one of the most drinkable beers I've had, much less one with such a high ABV. I just wish they made this one more often. 629 charactersRomaniIteDomum, Nov 06, 2009
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My second re-rate: After having this again, I had to make it a perfect 5. This beer is outrageous.
Thanks to Joey for the taste. I would rate this higher than a 10 on flavor, if I could. The chocolate flavor in this beer is over the top delicious. It is strong, creamy and decadent with vanilla and cinnamon spices added in. The peppers are sitting in the back, providing just a slight burn to let you know they are there. The mouthfeel is thick and oily. Swirling the beer around the glass leaves a light brown oil slick on the sides. I simply cannot wait until this hits the market. The chocolate flavor is a desert of its own. Fabulous flavor. Great job!
RE-RATE: After the Cigar City Kickoff party, I had to bump my rate even higher. This beer is amazing. Was told the ABV was kicked up higher, to the 13%-14% range, but it doesn't show. The flavors seem even more intense and the alcohol is hidden very well. The chocolate in this beer tastes like the best gourmet chocolate I've ever had in a beer. No corners have been cut. If I could drink on thing for the rest of my life, it would be this. 1,100 characterschemmie, Jul 16, 2009

A: Pitch black, opaque in color. A small wet sand color head appears and leaves no lace. As a side note, as I consume the beer, a light brown coating appears on the glass and sticks around. At the end the rements of the beer leave legs, like a fine wine.
A: Huge chocolate. It smells like brownie batter. I get some spice from the ancho chilis, coffee, molasses, and a little roastiness.
T: Out of this world. Chocolate and spice, but not over the top. Just a hint of heat shows up at the back o the throat. Molasses is thick, but the chocoate is where this one shines.
M: Heavy body, creamy. Just the right amount of carbonation makes for an excellent mouthfeel.
D and overall impression: Just a huge American Double Stout, the ABV will limit the drinkability, but this one goes down smooth. Overall this beer is just amazing! One of the best I've had to date.. I know this is sounding redundant coming from me lately, but Wayne and Joey at CCB are brewing some of the best beer in the world right now. A must have! Skal. 1,102 charactersGtreid, Jun 27, 2009

Inky black and totally opaque, this one coats the glass like used motor oil. Mocha colored head quickly dissipates to leave scattered lace. As I turn the glass, it clings to the side like a full-bodied red wine . Rich chocolate malt up front followed by vanilla and cinnamon on the nose. The chiles come in a bit at the end with some spice. Sweet chocolate up front followed by vanilla, before the cinnamon kicks in and brings it all together. After a few sips the pepper spice hits the back of my throat. Everything opens up as it warms. This is truly a joy. Coats my palate and finishes dry with a bit of alcohol warmth and an aftertaste that I hope doesn't go away. My favorite stout by far. 863 charactersMcDiddyPop, Jun 26, 2009

Poured jet black into a tulip, with a dark brown head that looks very dense. This beer certainly does not look like it is messing around. Amazingly complex aroma, the coffee hits you up front, but a parade of roasted malt, chocolate, and that firey chili follows closely behind. This complexity comes through in the taste, as well, as the dominant chocolate malt backbone is supported by many other flavors. There are some hints of tobacco in the background, and that chili adds some spicey fireworks in your mouth towards the end. Not surprisingly, a rather dense beers that weighs heavy in the mouth. As I have stated all along, a ton things going on in this beer, a very enjoyable stout, but not one you can have too much of. 782 charactersbhalter8, May 30, 2009

Flavor does not disappoint, either: cocoa, coffee, cinnamon, cocoa, tobacco, peppery chilies, vanilla, spice, and complexity. Lots of yellow lace swirls around this teeming dervish of flavor.

4.25/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Black, turbid body with a thin, bubbly, dark tan head.
Smell: Highly roasty nose with full notes of dark chocolate, black coffee, spices, a big pinch of Captain Black tobacco (white blend, natch), and a sharp, vegetal note from the chilies contained within.
Taste: A heady mixture of roasted maltiness, chocolate, and vanilla give you a sip of Kahlua garnished with a sprinkling of cinnamon. Before long the heat and spice from the peppers kick in, but it's very well-integrated and complimentary to the overall flavor. A few careful drops of prune juice. More tobacco, which really is all too appropriate coming from a joint called Cigar city. Earthy hops with a modest amount of bitterness. Packed with flavor to the very end, there's even a bit of persistent heat beyond the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.
Drinkability: Very nice. Beers with peppers have come a long, long way since the infamous Cave Creek Chili Beer, haven't they? Without a doubt, I'm sure Crazy Ed is smiling down from heaven at Hunahpu's Imperial Stout. 1,095 charactersChainGangGuy, Feb 02, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle courtesy of JRedner in November, 2008. Pours a murky dark black color with a thick tan head that settles slowly. Aroma is strongly of dark chocolate, cocoa, peppers, dark ripe fruit, some hints of coffee, roasted malt and toffee. Flavor is amazingly complex with notes of dark ripe fruit, dark chocolate, roasted malts, chilis, coffee, toffee, pepper, caramel. There is a lot going on in this beer. Full body with a lingering sweet malty toffee finish. The acclaim is well deserved as this is an amazing beer. 516 charactersKiefdog, Jan 23, 2009

This beer is the standard Marshal Zhukov's Imperial Stout kicked up a bit. Some chili were added along with a bit of vanilla and cocoa nibs.
A: Like all Cigar City stout's this one is evil looking in the glass. As dark as night with a huge creamy brownish black head. The beer clings to the glass as if it is laced with oil. The head hangs around nice, and leaves big chunks of that dark brown goodness.
S: To say the aromas are bold would be an understatement. Huge charred malt aromas with strong notes of bitter chocolate. Light hints of roasted chili's can be detected as well. The vanilla hides beneath all these bold aromas along with a bit of dark fruit and tobacco.
T: The roasted malt is the first thing you detect here. Coffee come next along wtih a blast of bitter chocolate and tobacco. A touch of vanilla can be picked up and then the chilis create a touch of warmth on the back of the tongue. Very complex and very unique.
M: Very full bodied, smooth, creamy with the chili's creating a real depth.
D: Not as drinkable as some of the other Cigar City stouts, but it sure is tasty. A one of a kind treat. 1,144 characterstpd975, Jan 03, 2009
