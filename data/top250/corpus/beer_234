Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, maple, oak and chocolate as well.
Taste starts with bourbon goes into more maple sweetness and vanilla, lots of fudge/chocolate notes and an oaky dry finish. 
Medium bodied, decently dry finish and a bit of alcohol in the aroma and on the finish. Not super boozy though.
Great beer, but not as maple forward as expected and a bit too light in the body and mouthfeel as well. I know it's an Imperial Porter, not an Imperial Stout, but still. 494 charactersJohnnyMc, Mar 20, 2017

A- Pours a mostly opaque black color with a 1/4 inch tan head that doesn't retain long before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and some sheer wisps of surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind.
S- Very bourbon-forward aroma launches forth notes of molasses, dark chocolate and whiskey-soaked wood.
T- Holy mother.  This is one of the most well-integrated flavor profiles I've come across in a BBA beer.  Such lovely interplay between the maple and bourbon.  Notes of vanilla and chocolate meld seamlessly with the bourbon and maple creating an incredibly smooth bourbon-laced porter.
M- Not very thick or creamy which is expected since it's a porter after all.  Medium-low carbonation and a fullish body.
O- Extremely impressed by this.  One of the best Jackie O's beers I've had thus far and I think it's safe to say this is now my favorite BBA porter ever. 945 charactersImmortale25, Feb 25, 2017

Overall this has the look and feel of the great J O's barrel aged stouts.  This one certainly has faded some, and I would love to try this fresh.  The chocolate and barrel came through nicely, however, there was only a little bit of the sweetness from the maple.  Certainly a great beer, but probably one that shouldn't age for 2 years.  I did read that this vintage had some infection reviews, so I was excited to had a good bottle. 479 charactersrabbott2, Feb 13, 2017

2016 vintage
A- pours a deep black color with a small foamy khaki head that disappears completely, leaving nothing behind 
S- aroma opens with nutty mocha fudge brownies & dark chocolate, followed by undertones of bourbon, woody oak, vanilla, maple, brown sugar & coconut, light alcohol
T- flavor is bourbon forward up front, with notes of spicy wood & vanilla.  Mid-palate gives notes of toasted nuts, dark chocolate, brown sugar and a maple sweetness.  The finish is slightly boozy with a linger of chocolate and nuts
M- medium-light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy carbonation and a warming finish 
O- pretty tasty overall with some nice nutty notes throughout 731 charactersTreyliff, Feb 13, 2017

Smell: as it poured the room filled with an aroma of maple syrup, as you smell you get notes of chocolate and vanilla with a very well balanced bourbon 
Taste: big maple syrup front fallowed quickly by malt, vanilla and a slight chocolate middle with a big bold bourbon finish.
Fell: medium body, no carbination, easily drank with a smooth velvet like mouth feel fallowed by a nice bourbon burn as it goes down, stupidly easy to drink for its abv.
Overall: an amazing drinking experience, drank fresh (less than a month old) from a tulip at ~55 degrees from bottle. 646 charactersFutbolmanby, Feb 09, 2017

4.14/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25L- Dark brown to black, not much head. 
S- Sweet aroma, combination of maple, milk chocolate and vanilla. Bourbon is the other main smell.  
T- Bourbon is the most prominent flavor and it's pretty forward. After that dies down a bit, there's a sweet maple and chocolate flavor. 
F- It had a good, rich thickness when it was still cold. It's not quite as rich when it warms up, but still smooth with a good mouth coating. Tastes thicker than it pours. 
O- It's pretty good, but could be better. The bourbon overpowers the maple just a bit too much. A little more of the base would bump it up a fair amount. 609 charactersZoomslowik, Feb 06, 2017
4.05/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4L - looks thin coming out of the bottle. Not seeing much head so I poured it a little harder and got fizzy cola bubbles. Actually erupted like a freshly poured glass of coke with hundreds of tiny bubbles screaming their way to the top. No, it didn't overflow, all this action was taking place over the width of maybe 5mm. Definite legs when swirling, but it just looks so thin. Too thin for this ABV!
S - woof. Bourbon city! Vanilla and whiskey. Hints of dark chocolate and maybe a tiny bit of pepper heat. Could just be the alcohol though! 
T - not gonna lie, this is mostly whiskey. Not a whole lot of beer going on, nevermind maple! Dry rye sucks the moisture out of this beast as the barrel tangles with flavors of oak and burnt wheat. Very woodsy and I'm getting the faintest burnt molasses or brown sugar note. Is this the maple? Could it possibly be? 
F - it's thin, but in the same way whiskey is thin. This is whiskey. Silky and smooth, but not a lot of body. I mean, it is a porter, not necessarily a stout so maybe I should be looking at it differently. But it's still 11% for chrissakes. 
O - I like the flavor of whiskey so I like this beer. Not sure it's all its cracked up to be and it comes off as rather one dimensional. 1,241 charactersagreenman19, Jan 31, 2017

A: The beer is a deep black color, with a very thin beige head that fades quickly and leaves a very thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains strong bourbon and maple along with roasted malts, some coffee and chocolate.
T: The taste likewise starts out very sweet with strong flavors of bourbon and maple. Then a hearty roasted malt character breadiness comes in. There are some mild background flavors of chocolate, coffee and licorice. The hops presence is extremely mild as you would expect with this type of beer and there’s a very good balance despite the sweetness and strength of the maple and bourbon. The after-taste is sweet.
M: Crisp, very smooth and a bit viscous, medium-to heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to sip on for a long time. 1,037 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 27, 2017

4.34/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a mostly opaque dark cola brown. Two fingers of dense tan head recedes to an oily collar that leaves minimal lacing. Smell is [surprise] dominated by bourbon and maple. Some molasses and dark chocolate come through as well.
Taste highlighted by sweet maple, vanilla, and smooth roasted chocolate malt. Just enough black coffee and bittersweet chocolate to give it some balance and prevent it from being too sweet. Bourbon is certainly present, but not boozy. It adds a pleasant spicy warmth. Faint oak and molasses notes also present. Body is a bit thinner than I anticipated, but it doesn't detract much from the impressive medley of flavors.
I thought it could have been better with a fuller body, but it is fantastic nonetheless. Maybe closer to the bottom of my pecking order in Jackie O's BA offerings, but that's still better than most. Would not hesitate to buy another. 885 charactersglass_house, Jan 09, 2017

Visual lack of carbonation is problematic. Huge bourbon, molasses nose with hints of vanilla. Taste follows nose, but the fact that this bottle is flat really kills what would be an incredible experience. No need to go on and on - I obviously got a bad bottle.  Flavor is so tasty that I am going to finish, so that should say something. Was a huge Jackie-Os stout fan after sampling Champion Ground and Oro Negro last week, but got rate 'em as I drink 'em. Happy that I have a second and hope that it doesn't have the same problem -may adjust my rating when I try it.
Bottom line - absolutely inexcusable to have quality control issues when you are charging 12 bucks for 12.7 ounces. 879 characters11-52_4hops, Dec 16, 2016

Nose is sweet, bourbon, vanilla, and a bit of molasses.
Taste is bourbon, oak, vanilla, molasses, minor booze, and sweetness.
Mouthful is medium but surprisingly a touch thin.  Carbonation is average.  Finish is sweet.
Wow.  A super bourbon forward stout that retains its balance.  Exceptionally drinkable at 11%.  Drawbacks are maple that is not really present until warm and even then it's low and the mouthful being thin but that is par for Jackie O's.  All in all a very enjoyable stout. 590 charactersSlack, Nov 19, 2016

S - bourbon first, molasses, more bourbon, vanilla, smells extremely sweet. Very much reminds me of bcbs - I hope it's as thick and rich as it as well.
T - damn. That's one of the best beers I've ever had. HUGE bourbon presence, followed quickly by the maple that I didn't get on the nose. Tons of brown sugar. Roasty but zero bitterness from it. It indeed does resemble bcbs with a satisfying presence of maple from start to finish. 
M - it's in no way thin, it's just not as gigantic as I had hoped. Overall it's still above average for an 11% stout.
Overall - phenominal. Arguably the best bb stout I've ever had and certainly in the top 3. 742 charactersrypkr, Jul 30, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Dusty old brownish black like old used motor oil, it pours murky and viscous. Small discreet discrete brown head components come together with a vigorous pour, but give up the ghost pretty quick. Murky.
Nose... Oh man. Even just off the pour it's boozy in a good way with maple and dark sugars. Maybe some rich molasses on the edges. Woody and a hint of tobacco/leather. Muffled chocolate. 
Starts off with almost more dark fruits than I expected, the sweetness meanders past hints of oak and confronts a molasses bite gilded with maple syrup inlay and ultimately plated with a booziness that's not quite harsh, but will certainly not go quietly. As it warms, it mellows into more of the maple and de-emphasizes the molasses and other sharper notes. Just gets better and better.
Medium body and higher carbonation than I prefer this one is still a big winner for me. The maple shares space with almost more of a molasses crudity but, though I would prefer a stronger maple lead, it still works really well for me. The biggest gripe I have with this beer is that it's only available on the other side of the country, so I'll be reliant on the kindness of strangers to get ahold of it again.
So much gratitude to @WesMantooth for sending this along in his NBS BIF #3 box. Killin' it Corey! 1,290 characterskemoarps, Apr 10, 2016

Offers a plethora of flavors, mainly coconut, caramel coated vanilla and sweet maple syrup, balanced by earthy malts and bakers chocolate. 
Low on its carbonation, with a thinner mouthfeel to it, gently balancing the Bourbon with a silk layer of cream.
Tastes of milk chocolate, cloying molasses, cocoa nibs and earth. Bourbon, soothed by cream, becomes apparent by a dry coconut alcohol bite, revealing bitter chocolate and rock sugar. Finishes with caramel and a slightly bittercoffee earthiness, featuring a pleasant, sugar coated dryness.
Relying heavily on the barrel, this reveals a lot of awesome Bourbon characteristics among sweeter malts, balanced by a bitter dryness. A little thin as for its mouthfeel, while providing a great creaminess. 831 charactersaleigator, Feb 28, 2016

2.16/5  rDev -51.1%look: 3.25 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2 | feel: 2.25 |  overall: 2Pours black with a large, tan head that rapidly fades away into nothing. No lacing.
Oaky, milky, with extremely strong, harsh bourbon notes on the nose. Unlike other maple brews I've had, the maple is actually more apparent and nutty when fresh, as opposed to after aging at length where it fades here--in other dark brews featuring maple, it seems to take over with time.
The flavor of this beer is like a full glass of whiskey with a shot of light porter in it. Unfortunately, that's it. I detect no maple whatsoever. After having recently had Project PAM, I find that astounding, since Black Maple is described as actually having syrup added to the brew, but Project PAM is only aged in maple barrels without added syrup, and has far more maple to it. I think a lot of people either read maple on the label and feel obligated to say it's there after going through all the trouble it takes to get this, or they're subliminally duped into thinking it's there. It's not. Either way, once it fully warms after sitting for far too long, there are faint nutty notes in the background, but it's still aggressively dominated by bourbon. Again, when freshest, it is better, and a little more balanced, with a woodier flavor.
Not unlike drinking a strong cocktail or straight bourbon, boozy heat flows up through the nose, with a mild burn that rubs the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is a fizzy, tangy sting on the tongue, and the beer itself is actually quite thin for me. As it warms, at its freshest, it becomes slick and sticky.
I'm very disappointed in this beer considering the enormous reputation it has earned. When I have a beer, I don't want a cocktail, I want the beer to shine through first and foremost. There are far better barrel aged brews out there offering a more balanced take on the style. 1,810 charactersSabtos, Feb 19, 2016

This one hits with a slight hint of maple upfront, then mellow into a sweet malt stout. As it warms, the spices come alive on the finish.

Pours a .5 finger foamy mocha colored head with moderate to low retention. Beer is pitch black and much thicker than your average porter. Lacing is spotty and sparse with little stick but big, oily legs. Average.
Nose is molasses, light coffee bean tartness, chocolate, fudge, mocha and a robust bourbon sweetness. Not too aromatic but the aroma is very nice. 
Opens chocolate, maple syrup and mocha. Bourbon barrel aging is very apparent. Boozy in the middle with more hints of sweet soy sauce, chocolate, prunes, raisin and other dark dried fruit. Tobacco and oak in the middle to end. Finishes sweet with loads of syrup, fudge and booze. Same aftertaste. Excellent.  
Medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, soft and a touch thin on the palate and goes down rich, foamy and silky. Finishes messy with a lingering, sticky aftertaste. The perfect balance of soft, smooth and robust. 
Jackie O's dark offerings have been a bit hit or miss in my opinion. That being said, Bourbon Black Maple is awesome. The feel is spot on and the flavor is complex and well integrated. Definitely worth trying. 1,171 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 11, 2015
4.51/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Imperial porter brewed with maple syrup and aged in bourbon barrels. Poured from a bottle into a Wicked Weed snifter. Very dark, nearly black pour with about a finger of tan head that quickly dissolves to a lacy ring around the glass. Rich notes of bourbon, dark fruit, chocolate, and vanilla.
Full body with a smooth feel and a rich, bourbon-forward flavor. Some roastiness and a substantial amount of dark fruit up front provide a combination of bitter and tart flavors, but there is enough malt sweetness to balance it out and provide notes of brown bread and crackers. At mid-palate, the barrel character swoops in and adds even more sweetness in the form of toasted oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, and alcohol. The dark fruit persists across the palate, the sweet and toasty malt dies out, and the finish is all dark fruit and bourbon barrel, with a lingering alcohol warmth and a faint puckery tartness. I'm not sure the maple syrup contributes much. Perhaps it's integrated with the malty sweetness up front.
It's hard not to like this beer. There's lots of bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, and bourbon. Porters all seem to have a characteristic roasty note to them and this one doesn't have it because the barrel character dominates everything. It's more like a stout with a thinner mouthfeel. Whatever it is, one thing is certain. Jackie O's has one heck of a serious barrel-aging program going one. 1,410 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 10, 2015

Dark, boozy, with aromas of maple, caramel, dark chocolate and flavors that follow suit. Though it is boozy, the alcohol hides behind the shadow of glorious flavors. 423 charactersBrewstradamus, Dec 09, 2015

4.31/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25My 2015 Halloween beer! 12.7 oz. bottle into a Duvel glass. Pours a very dark, oily brown and settles absoloutely pitch black in the glass. About a finger of dense, mocha-colored foam resulted from an aggressive pour; dwindled down to a thick lacing after about a minute. Definite bourbon notes on the aroma along with hints of maple syrup, baker's chocolate, roasted malts, and expresso. An intense, slightly abrasive aroma, but also quite sweet. The taste follows the smell note for note, initially presenting a huge bourbony profile followed by modest notes of chocolate, maple syrup, and sweet malt. While heavy on the bourbon, this beer is actually fairly complex once you get into it. Initially a little watery in composition, this beer thickens as it warms on the palate if you give it a chance. The result by the finish is a very smooth, drinkable bourbon-aged treat that, while delicious, begs to be cellared. I held on to this for a month, and couldn't resist it any longer. I'll be making the drive up to Akron the next time this is released to stock up. 1,065 charactersdo_ob, Nov 01, 2015

Look - Definitely black, not brown. Nice off white head even for a bar pour. Stayed around with a ring. Not a lot of lacing.
Smell - Maple. Coffee. Chocolate. No vanilla/pancakes as CBS had.
Taste - Maple but not terribly over done. Chocolate. Coffee. Vanilla comes through in taste. Bourbon.
Feel - Very smooth for 11%. Doesn't really burn tongue or throat at all. Creamy.
Overall - Better than CBS. More maple as opposed to pancakes. Smooth. 502 charactersmadelfonatree, Oct 30, 2015

Big, dark, boozy, bourbon, hot. There's a rating that could be given for this as a BA beer or as a maple beer. As a BA beer, I'd definitely give a higher rating and probably recommend putting it in a cellar for a bit. But so much of the hype around this was the maple. I lean on grading this as a maple beer. This is largely wanted for the maple. It's there but very hidden, popping up only briefly along with other wonderful, great notes for a fantastic overall profile, but the finish especially was hot. Still a fantastic beer. Would love to try again in a year. 597 charactersSki3PO, Oct 27, 2015

I am sometimes disappointed when the maple in maple beers takes a backseat, but maple is front and center with BBBM.  Wonderful maple, bourbon, oak, and chocolate/vanilla.  Definitely on the sweet side, which is a plus for me.  An all time favorite!
(Re-reviewed 11/5/16): Much better mouth on the 2016, but not as flavorful.  Barrel/alcohol a little overbearing, masking much of the maple.  This was fresher than my previous review. 495 charactersGaddabble, Oct 21, 2015

Big bourbon smell, with an nice helping of sweet maple, oak, vanilla and some chocolate. The smell is fantastic. The taste is big malts and bourbon, but with a subtle maple flavor. I get oak and some bitter chocolate with roasted malt with the vanilla and caramels. Booze is somewhat present but not overwhelming. 
Mouthfeel is medium for a porter, but delicate and smooth. Carbonation is light and soft. A delicious and tasty oatmeal Porter with good amount of bourbon, maple,  and vanilla. Surprised this is not more sought after. 683 charactersRi0, Oct 18, 2015

Look:  The beer appears, very dark brown.  Semi-viscous.  The beige head quickly disappeared, within seconds.  What's left is a thin halo around my brandy snifter with one small filmy island near the middle of the glass.  Thin legs with disappearing lacing.
Smell:  Bonkers.  Similar to a BCBS.  Rich, dark malts, vanilla, molasses, and strong bourbon aromas.       
Taste:  Nice.  The taste has all of the elements described above, but the molasses makes a strong stance.  It is the 800-pound gorilla in the room.  Not quite, but yes, he is definitely there.  Alcohol is apparent.  Did I mention this tastes like BCBS, just add molasses.   If I had to quickly describe this beer, I would say it is BCBS with molasses, plus a dab of coconut.  Excellent and balanced star, middle, and finish.  
Feel:  This reminds me of BCBS.  Nice sold feel.  Substantial.  Very low carbonation.  
Overall -  What a world-class offering from Jackie O's.  I would take this over BCBS. 1,032 charactersmabermud, Oct 12, 2015

Tastes like what I imagine Maple Black Tuesday Lite would be like. Boozy, thin, light roast, and Maple. Great beer, but a bigger backbone and more roast would push this to near perfection. 394 charactersmctizzz, Oct 11, 2015

4.46/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Description: Pours a dark black with just a small amount of tan/coffee colored head.  Bourbon is very present and also hints of wood and dark chocolate; as it warms you pick up more sweetness from the syrup.  Taste is similar to the smell: bourbon,wood, chocolate and getting progressively sweeter as it warms.  The maple is there, but it's certainly in the background.  Smooth mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and, as you can probably guess, the alcohol/bourbon is present.
Suggested food pairing: Prime rib, cooked medium rare
If you like this beer then you should also try: KBS
Ideal time to drink this beer: A sipping beer for sure, this would be great to enjoy next to a warm fire on a cold, wet autumn day, while you peruse your collection of leather bound books that smell of rich mahogany.
Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) The only real knock I have on this beer is that I would have liked the maple flavor to come through  more prominently.  I was expecting something akin to CBS but found it more similar to KBS (although not quite as good).  Having said that, this a very good beer and one worth seeking out.  With a price tag of $12/bottle it's a bit expensive, but I bought a six-pack and don't regret it at all.  With the explosion of craft brewers over the last few years it can sometimes be difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.  By brewing beers like this (and some of their other recent stouts) I think Jackie O's is firmly establishing itself in the 'wheat' camp.  With each solid new beer it produces, this brewer's following continues to grow and deservedly so. 1,641 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 04, 2015
4.71/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the 375 ml bottle into a tulip. Appearance is completely black, with a thin brown head. The head dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a layer of film on top, as well as a ring around the edge of the glass. 
The nose is loads of bourbon, some chocolate, and maple. As it warms, the bourbon becomes more intertwined with everything else, and it really begins to come together. The taste follows the nose in many ways, but it is a touch harsh at cooler temperatures. As it warms, the complexities come through and the chocolate, maple and bourbon play together wonderfully. A touch of roast comes through here as well. The bourbon and maple is the focal point at the end of each taste. I had the 2015 release side by side with a 2014 and the differences were quite interesting. As expected, the bourbon had taken a back-seat in the 2014 and the maple and chocolate were the main players. The older was by far the more enjoyable beer at cooler temperatures, but as it warms, I missed the complexities the bourbon presence offered. Either way, they were both great brews.
The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, with just the right touch of carbonation. It goes down smoothly, and each sip leaves you going back for more. Overall, this is an absolutely wonderful beer, and is everything you're looking for in this style. The flavor profile as a whole is exceptional, and the complexities continually draw you in looking for more. Jackie O's continues to amaze. 1,467 characterszimm421, Oct 04, 2015

A - Very dark going into the glass.  Pitch black after the pour, with little to no head.  Just a ring of bubbles around the top.  This is really, really dark.
N - I caught one whiff on my way over to the computer, and I got lots of malt and a crapton of maple syrup.  With my nose in the glass I get only subtle malt.  Bourbon and syrup are dominant.  This smells incredible.
T - Hmm... this reminds me a lot of Good Morning.  Lots of syrup here, less on the bourbon, and almost no malt.  It's mostly syrup.  Not overly complex or robust, though.  No alcohol whatsoever.
M - This is a lot thinner than I expected.  It's almost watery.  Slightly disappointed by this.
O - I very nice beer.  Nothing really special, but I enjoyed it. 877 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 21, 2015

Not a ton of bourbon taste altough it certainly feels boozy. It's also as chewy as any beer I've had if that makes sense. Overall, a great maple enhanced stout, worth the twelve bucks at least once. 528 charactersBeef_Curtains, Sep 19, 2015

An 11.0% abv Imperial Porter aged in Bourbon barrels with a generous addition of maples syrup. Nearly a breakfast beer. Warming with light overtones of maple and dark sugar, slight roasted grain throughout with hints of ripe dark fruit. Toasted wood, bourbon, and more maples blanket the palate far into the finish. Delicious and well rounded but so mellow as the 11% doesn’t show its true strength.

This smells of toasted coconut, vanilla, caramel and an all around fudgy feel. The booze is present with soft oxidative notes and plenty of chocolate.
This tastes of full on barrel character: toasted coconut, caramel, vanilla and chocolate fudge with mild oxidation and bourbon warmth to the finish.
This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. A very enjoyable sipper with full on barrel flavors with decent warming alcohol inclusion. Its been awhile since ive had any of Brad's barrel aged creations and damn he hasnt missed a beat, still amazing stuff. Well done. 720 charactersstakem, Aug 18, 2015

Flavors followed the nose both there was a nice long finish with tons of balanced sweetness. Low carbonation with a slightly thin mouthfeel for the type of beer it is (although it is classified as an imperial porter and not a stout). 
 Still quite rich/sweet that I would share a bottle next time. 412 charactersrockernino, Jul 26, 2015

S: Sweet chocolate, prominent Bourbon/oak/vanilla, hints of maple syrup, tobacco, dark fruit.
T: Everything in the aroma and then some. Chocolate covered cherries hits up front with a heavy Bourbon/spirit note, lots of sweetness, molasses/maple syrup, caramel and raisin, some roast and char. The complexity seems to have ramped up since it was initially bottled.
M: Just a tad thin, but still very nice. Carbonation is slightly low, but  I prefer it this way, it works perfectly to showcase the depth of sweetness and intricacy of flavors.
O: Simply fantastic, it's held up incredibly these months given the delicate nature of maple syrup. 760 charactersDan_Inreallife, Jul 05, 2015

S: Rich maple and sweet bourbon are right up front, with some caramel malt, dark chocolate, and vanillas as well. Excellent.
T: Everything from the nose, and then some. Sweet, spicy, oaky, and generally delectable. Maple is prominent but never cloying, with the malt and barrel balancing it beautifully. Long, bittersweet finish. Really delightful.
M: Thick and sticky.
O: Probably my favorite Jackie O's of all time. The maple provides some splendid depth and intensity of flavor, but never overpowers the substantial base beer's goodness. Well done indeed.

3.95/5  rDev -10.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This isn't a bad beer by any means, but I was expecting more based on the ratings. I can see why they call it an imperial porter rather than  stout because the mouth feel is thinner than you'd expect for a barrel aged beer at 11%. They almost pull it off too because the chocolate flavor is amazing and the bourbon comes through strong on the nose and in the flavor. Unfortunately, some sips seemed out of balance as the alcohol and bourbon overpower the thin base beer. There was no head to be found on this whatsoever and it could have used a bit more carbonation to help the mouth feel. Overall, I'd say this has some very nice qualities and I'm glad I was able to try it, but I wouldn't seek it out again. 709 charactersdanh53, Jun 01, 2015

Nose is rich, a good bit of bourbon up front, sweet, tons of maple, malts don't shine through as much as you would hope but nose is powerful and didn't smell overly sugary.  A good bit of toffee and some melted caramel.  Taste is solid, lots of rich bourbon and maple, malts are more present, definitely sweet but seems fairly well attenuated.  The style is going to breed a sweeter beer.  Malts are rich, caramel and chocolate, body thins a bit in the finish, carb is very gentle.  Soft feel and very creamy. 585 characterscpetrone84, May 22, 2015

S: A touch boozy with a good amount of sweetness, though I'm not really getting maple. Bourbon, toasted coconut, fudge, caramel, vanilla and some toffee. 
T: A buttery smooth blend of burnt brown sugar, fudge, a touch of raisin, chocolate cake and some tootsie roll. Maybe a touch of cola and wet barrel on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is a touch lighter than I was expecting, but still hearty enough to stand up to the heavier flavors in here. I don't know if I'd put this in the elite class, but it's very good. 605 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 28, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. No freshness date printed on label. 2014 bottling.
Appearance: Pours a cola brown, almost black, with a 1/2 finger mocha brown head which fades slowly leaving a ring around the edge of the glass which eventually fades into a headless pool of flat cola. No lacing. Swirling the glass brings out some alcohol legs.
Smell: Cocoa, vanilla and bourbon dominate with roasted malt, a nice nuttiness, dried fruit, molasses and a hint of alcohol.
Taste: Medium roasted malt, sweet chocolate and a touch of maple syrup up front followed by molasses, vanilla and bourbon in the middle before ending with just a touch of toasted malt, a bit more maple sweetness and a bit of alcohol at the finish. Aftertaste is sweet with just a little bitterness. The alcohol comes through stronger as it warms up.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. There is a mild alcohol burn as it goes down due to the ABV. 
Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. Goes down exceptionally smooth for a beer with an ABV of 11%.
Overall: Excellent beer overall. While it's labeled as an American Porter here on BA and as an Imperial Porter by Jackie O's, it's really an American Double / Imperial Stout. Whatever you call it, it's damn near perfect. I would very highly recommend this one if you get the chance to try it. 1,362 charactersadam42381, Feb 18, 2015

A: Dark brown and cola-like, with a thin, mocha head that recedes to a ring around the glass. Not thick or turbid looking.
S: Just a lovely nose, but not what I was expecting from a maple beer. The major players are bourbon-soaked fudge, vanilla, and a cinnamon-like spice. Also some molasses and a cola or root-beer sweetness. Not much maple aroma on the nose. The maple's definitely there, but to my mind it's working as an emulsifier or binding agent that ties the bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla together and makes the nose far greater than the sum of its parts. The nose really made me think about french toast with maple syrup.
T: Sweet vanilla, creamy cocoa, and bourbon-soaked coconut shavings. Fudge, molasses, and more vanilla. Delicious stuff, but a tiny tiny bit disappointing only because the nose promised (me) bourbon-drenched french toast.
M: Spot-on for a porter: smooth, on the lighter side, and just a tad viscous. Really love the lighter mouthfeel and how it contrasts so sharply with the intense flavors. Smooth and creamy as all get out.
O: Great stuff. I think I prefer BA Dark App to this, but this beer is the superior product. Incredible nose, great flavors, and a lighter mouthfeel that really draws your attention to the intense flavors this beer offers. 1,346 charactersblankenhoney, Jan 30, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up in a great trade with Alexis!  An aggressive pour yields a one finger caramel-colored head that fades quickly with a pitch black body and decent lacing.  The nose is bold and complex with lots of maple and bourbon up front along with hints of vanilla, caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and subtle cocoa.  The taste follows suit with big bourbon, maple, and caramel notes complemented with hints of tobacco, molasses, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, chocolate fudge, and some subtle booze.  The mouthfeel is thick and rich, smooth and velvety, and incredibly drinkable.  The alcohol is incredibly well hidden.  Overall, this is the best maple variant beer I've had to date.  The maple is front and center, but never overwhelming.  Incredibly balanced and drinkable.  Highly recommended! 809 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 24, 2015

A: Black pour with a small, fizzy dark brown head. Head fizzes out like soda and disappears almost immediately. No lacing or head retention at all.
S: Huge, huge, huge bourbon aroma. Loads of caramel with a little toffee. Oaky. Maple syrup behind it all but man, that bourbon. I get almost no roasted malt, just a little chocolate. The bourbon and maple syrup dominates here. Stinging booze assails the nostrils. Swirling produces even stronger maple syrup notes.
T: Oh yeah. Bourbon is still strong here but not as dominant. Huge caramel and oak notes up front, then enormous maple syrup to back it up. Very sweet as you can probably guess. Maple syrup backs a heavy chocolate character with some smooth roastiness (fairly minimal, I guess this IS a porter and not a huge RIS or something). More maple syrup in the finish with a caramel backing this time. Big, sweet and boozy. Belly-warming for sure. I'm actually surprised this one is only 11%.
M: Very heavy and very sweet but the strong bourbon does cut it a bit. Smoothness of a good porter is still there, however.
O: Whew. A decadent and sweet sipper for sure. Huge caramel and maple syrup everywhere. Surprisingly smooth but the alcohol burn roughs it up a bit on the back end. No huge roastiness to back up the sweetness like a huge stout would have. Very interesting brew. 1,351 charactersDope, Jan 23, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - The beer was an inky black color with few bubbles noted near the top of the glass. 
Smell - The bourbon was noted in the aroma, but it angled toward sweetness. This was a direct affect of the maple interacting with the bourbon.
Taste - In the initial taste, it is noted that the maple smooths out the bourbon. I would never describe this one as being "hot".  The malts in this porter possess a sweetness that is downright sticky. In the aftertaste, the bourbon and maple continue to linger.
Mouthfeel - As far as porters go, this one is smooth and possesses a quality of stickiness. The carbonation was very modest.
Overall - This is a really good beer. As far as maple beers go, CBS is the only other one that belongs in the conversation. 756 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 01, 2015

A-  Pours an opaque dark black,  very thin head that dissipates to just a few bubbles, carbonation a bit on the low side but definitely not flat.
S-  Dark chocolate, light maple, hints of roast, integrated bourbon, oak.  Overall very well integrated with an exceptional balance. 
T-  Smooth dark chocolate, oak, light sweet maple syrup balanced with a nice subtle bourbon presence, finishes with a light roast and slight char with the bourbon coming out a bit more.  Like the aroma the taste is exceptionally balanced, complex, and overall well done.
M-  Slick, oily, very smooth for the abv, low carbonation, could use slightly more body but would probably take away from the slickness.
O-  This is easily a top tier maple stout that I' put just below Hill Farmstead's Beyond Good and Evil but still pretty far from KBBS.  All said and done though this is the much easier to obtain alternative that you will definitely not be disappointed with.  The balance is exceptional however it could have a little bit more carbonation and I wouldn't complain with a bit more maple presence. 1,181 charactersjaasen64, Dec 08, 2014

A - Tan foam settles to a collar, a few wisps, and minimal lace. Near-black body that seems appropriate for the name and style.
S - Smells like barrel-aged maple syrup. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, maple. There's a bit of dark bread and nutty malt in the background. Perhaps a hint of booze as it warms, but reasonably well-hidden.
T - The taste is a bit more heavier on base beer's malt character, with dark bread, nuts, and chocolate fudge. Less bourbon and maple, which is actually the detriment of the beer. Still pretty good; just not as great as the aroma.
M - Big and chewy body, with lingering stickiness. Minimal alcohol heat and a surprisingly soft texture. Minimal tannins present.
D - Quite good, although it's a tad too sweet and heavy to drink it large quantities. Still, really good brew that is reminiscent of the barrel-aged maple syrup Brad let us try at Jackie O's. Still, nice to see this brewery back on track after a stretch of middling brews. 1,016 charactersMasterSki, Nov 27, 2014

4/5  rDev -9.5%Thanks to fiver29, a giant among traders, for sending me this weird little 375ML bottle. I’ve been thinking about it longingly all day; now I get to touch it. Happy. 
The pour is dead-dirt black with slightly more carbonation, just a 75 year old man fringe around the edges. The nose is sweet & sweeter: big malts, rich chocolate, & those lovely maple notes, perhaps stronger than in any ‘maple’ beer I’ve had. I’m always stopping at far-flung roadside stands to buy local maple syrup. This is making me hungry for Belgian waffles… 
Anyways, Black Maple – Bourbon Barrel Aged is a chameleon of a beer. First impression is all about the vanilla & bourbon mixing it up with the maple, with little hint of beer in this beer – not that I’m complaining, because %these are a few of my favorite things%. Then I read the label, & my brain starts reporting in about nuts & chocolate, & it’s all almond Hershey’s inside my skull. As it warms, the bourbon barrel straight-up takes over, & the other tastes recede into the background. As it warms some more, the maple returns in a lovely manner. Smooth as a red silk nightie, there’s no alcohol sizzle here, & it drinks like a much lighter beer. 
A lovely, belly-warming jaunt, & I’m very glad I had almost seventeen ounces of this, because it’s gone faster than most brews. Very good beer. 1,360 charactersmaximum12, Nov 14, 2014

The smell much like a lot of Jackie-O beers has an enormous amount of barrel to it. Hard to get much else on the nose. The taste is the beer is pretty solid, some roasted flavors in there with a good amount of maple. The mouthfeel is pretty good. Overall I enjoyed the beer, probably not one I wanna have all the time but it's worth having on occasion. 425 charactersKnapp85, Nov 11, 2014

A  - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark black hue with a mocha head that faded quickly to leave a thin halo.
S - Aromas of nutty dark apparition, sweet maple candies, smooth bourbon. Need more vanilla.
T - Taste is lots of maple, nice vanilla bourbon, good roast nut notes with faint coffee and nice chocolate. Really pleasant and tasty with very nice bourbon and vanilla notes with the maple complimenting.
M - Mouthfeel Is nicely carbonated,  smooth, alcohol nicely hidden.
O - Overall this beer was delicious, wish the maple was more pronounced though, still just delicious.

A- pours motor oil black with a very thin mocha head. The head turns into an outside lace that lasts all tge way through. Absolutely opaque, just the way I like it.
S- very bourbon forward. Sweet with lots of vanilla and chocolate. The  maple syrup is very subtle. It follows the nourbon so it is masked slightly by it. 
T- taste follows the nose. Very bourbon forward. Roasted barley, brown sugar, vanilla, but still not getting very much maple syrup. There is a little hint of it on the back end but I expected more from this. 
M- surprisingly thinner than I expected. Not watery or anything but not as thick as it looks. It's very smooth with not very much heat. 
O- this beer is good. But not excellent. The maple syrup which is lead to be the main component of this beer is masked heavily by the bourbon. I think that if it wasn't bourbon barrel aged then it would have been better. 933 charactersmlhyatt, Nov 09, 2014

No real head, just bubbles, nice legs, pitch black.
Nose big candy, maple candies and maple cream, big nutty aromas and little fudgey cocoa, little maple caramel like aroma, little big roasty cocoa and dark darkness. Light bourbon and little vanilla oaky barrel. 
Taste  brings sweet malt and candy, big maple candies and maple creams, some vanilla, little chocolate note, faint fudgey. Mild bourbon and nice vanilla barrel, little cocoa and fudgey, hint of roast and char, smooth dark malt. Mild sweetness that continues on the finish, little sticky, mild booze warmth, more cocoa and maple. 
Mouth is fuller bod, decent carb, faint booze.

Pours a pitch black body with thin head which is fine. Aroma is not as sweet as expected but maple and bourbon intertwine. Flavor is mostly bourbon and though it is not harsh, it manages to mask the porter base which is disappointing. Finishes with just the right touch of maple flavor. I expected the porter characteristics to play off the bourbon notes more but unfortunately they were no where to be found. 448 characterspapat444, Oct 14, 2014

Pours a fairly deep dark black, with a small quarter inch head, and not a whole lot of lacing. Looks quite enticing.
Smells incredible- huge notes of not-to-sweet maple, some chocolate, and a bit of bourbon. Smells decadent.
Tastes just about as good. The maple is strong, and very up-front, but it's nicely not too sweet. It's earthy, as well as sweet, keeping it balanced. There's some dark chocolate, and mild roasted malt notes, along with a slight bourbon kick at the end of each sip. The bourbon stays in the background, and merely complements everything else. I sense a little bit of vanilla, but not really any oak.
This is creamy and syrupy at the same time- the feeling in my mouth after each sip is not all that dissimilar to how I feel when eating pancakes with maple syrup. There's a lower but still substantial amount of carbonation.
This is some next level sh*t. Amazing. 924 charactersGreesyFizeek, Oct 13, 2014

Taste - Maple is very nice up front.  Turns into a brown sugar and then a bright sweetness.  Some dark chocolate and a strong nuttiness.  Maybe that's oak.
Mouthfeel - Medium heavy body.  Medium carbonation.
Overall - A very tasty beer.  Surprisingly nutty, which makes up for it not being a big stout. 507 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 07, 2014

Coal Black on the pour not much of a head.

The Maple is very present when warmed and should age well the 14's did.

4.54/5  rDev +2.7%Bottle from Joe.  Big time thanks!  Pours dark brown as it comes out of the bottle, but settles pretty pitch black in the glass with a very small, quickly receding dark brown head.  Awesome and super sweet aroma of chocolate and bourbon, vanilla, roasted marshmallow, sweet maple, caramel, toffee.  Flavor is a beautiful meld of sweet vanilla and bourbon, oak, more bourbon, some caramel, marshmallow, extra sweetness that I assume is maple, though that flavor is not particularly present.  The bourbon flavors are very mellow here, despite it having a body very much on the thinner side for being barrel aged.  It's so well integrated, though, that it doesn't really take away much from the beer.  Medium prickle on the carbonation, long finish of vanilla, caramel, oak, and bourbon.  Really, really nice.  Still do wish it had a bit more body.  But the flavors meld so nicely. 878 charactersBMMillsy, Sep 28, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +6.3%The beer comes in a dark black color.
This beer is very finicky with temperature as this beer really needs to be warmed up for flavors to come through.
The beer has sweet maple, caramel, vanilla from the barrels, a big chocolate note on the aroma.
The flavor offers a thin theme of smokiness. There's huge chocolate and coffee as the beer is very smooth of vanilla. A punch of the barrel's alcohol comes at the middle. The beer drinks like a lighter ABV beer with its medium body. Not too much of a maple bomb, but touches of that sweetness comes through in the end. 569 charactersdar482, Sep 22, 2014

Appeared a jet black, oil color.
Smelled of sweet dark fruits, a bit of char, and slight maple.
Taste is delicious.  Rich, dark fruits covered in dark chocolate.  Maple isn't too prevalent in the taste but might add to the richness.
Mouthfeel is thick with little carbonation.
Overall a delicious brew. 355 charactersTWStandley, Sep 14, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%375ml bottle, thanks to awesome BA trader WesMantooth.
Nearly opaque, black elixir poured into Hoppin' Frog snifter.  Mocha, thin rim, scant lacing.
Fantastic aroma of maple, bourbon, dark fruits, pine, caramel and spice.  Subtle char and chocolate round out the nose.
This is a wonderful, complex brew, with a backbone of maple and bourbon enveloping the dark fruits, pine, chocolate and caramel.
Medium-full body, well carbonated, smooth.  Alcohol well hidden.
One of Jackie O's best brews: complex, with that rare combination that brings the multitude of ingredients together creating one of the few complete brews I have had the pleasure to enjoy. 657 charactersCaptCleveland, Sep 08, 2014

A- Dark brown body, looks a bit watery coming out of the bottle but certainly quite dark. Minimal half finger brown head that disappears in a flash. A bit disappointing in appearance. [3.75]
S- Bourbon, milk chocolate with maple syrup sweetness similar to Better Half. Not a ton of complexity and it needs to be opened up closer to room temperature to bring out the right amount of whiskey aroma. [4]
F- Lots of bourbon at first, not a whole lot else. As it warms, more milk chocolate, espresso and a distinct maple syrup sweetness comes out more. However, the base beer seems to be lost in the bourbon; and the maple syrup is there but as more of a supporting component. So, essentially this is bourbon and maple syrup. I would have expected more contribution from the base beer. [3.75]
M- Disappointingly thin bodied, slightly watery with very little thickness to the feel. Finish is dry bourbon for the most part. [2.75]
O- I was surprised to see that this beer is rated a 4.71 as of this writing. There is not much in way of subtlety or complexity here. The mouthfeel is disappointingly thin. I'm not sure what I am missing here; perhaps I got a bad bottle. I would recommend Hill Farmstead Beyond Good & Evil instead if you have not had that yet. [3.75]

Aroma is amazing, the brew smells like maple, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malt.  The taste is mostly sweet and mapley.  It tastes like maple, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt, and a bit of dark fruit.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and creamy with low/moderate carbonation.  The 11% ABV is well hidden in this brew, it doesn't seem like I'm drinking something that strong at all!  This is definitely one of the best beers I've drank in a while.  Hopefully they're aging more of this down in Athens right now, because it would be a shame if this was just a one time brew.  Definitely recommended if you can get some!  $11.99 a bottle. 843 charactersbluejacket74, Aug 23, 2014

Smells like roasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, maple syrup. 
The bourbon is noticeable, and very smooth in the taste, but takes a back seat to the maple. Real maple. No imitation here. Incredibly smooth overall. Rich, but easy to drink. No heat from the bourbon and the 10.5% ABV. 
It should be pointed out that people are comparing to a lot of stouts. It is a porter though, so a little on the lighter bodied side other than the syrupy feel. 
They set the bar pretty high with Dark Apparition. This one cleared it by a foot. Not cheap at $12 for a 375 ml bottle, but worth every penny. World Class. 655 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 17, 2014

The smell is divine. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate..just glorious. 
The taste is every bit as perfect. No burn or bite from bourbon, but all the lovely nuanced flavors are there. Sweet but never cloying. Very long finish.

T- Can not verbally do this justice. Truly a top tier beer. And not just for porters. Dark, slight smoke, chocolate, bourbon that presents itself perfectly. Then a great maple finish. Just the right amount of sweetness.
M- After a taste like this, who cares what the mouthfeel is like
O- Certainly not someone who tends to over rate beers. If its possible to get your hands on this brew, accomplish that. Well done Jackie O's, youve knocked it out of the park 650 characterscmrncrzy10, Aug 13, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours out pretty dark. Almost completely opaque. Head lasts for maybe a second then fizzles out. No lacing. Smell is terrific. Bit of bourbon, bit of dark chocolate and a slight hint of maple. Taste is about as good as any bourbon aged brew I've had. Extremely smooth. Bourbon hides very well within the roasty malts and REAL maple. The maple is fantastic. Great mouthfeel too for an imperial porter. Thought the carb would be more intense after watching the pour but it was unobtrusive. Smooth as can be. Overall, the hype is real on this one. One of the best bourbon barrel beers I've had. Get one! 600 characterstoppoop, Aug 12, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A- Straight, thick black. Held in front of a bright light and there is still no transparency. Not too much head on this one, but what is there is light tan.
S- Lots of bourbon, some dark fruit, and a hint of dark chocolate.
T- Does not follow the nose to me. The bourbon really takes a back seat to the more prominent flavors of nuts, chocolate, and maple. For contrast, I get much more maple out of this beer than I did with Beyond Good & Evil from Hill Farmstead. The bourbon has what I would define as a perfect subtleness... it complements the other aspects without emerging into the foreground. Extremely drinkable for an 11%+ brew. Delicious.
M- Heavy and warm, exactly what I would hope for out of an Imperial Porter such as this.
O- Jackie O's has knocked it out of the park yet again. I love this beer and am left just hoping I can get some more. Cheers! 867 charactersAlienSwineFlu, Aug 06, 2014
