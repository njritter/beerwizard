4.94/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle dated 3/5/17 poured into a DFH Signature Glass.  Black body with a super creamy mocha head that disappated to a slight ring around the edge of the glass and small islands on the surface of the beer.  Aroma is milk chocolate, cinnamon, peppers, and a slight soy sauce.  Up front on the tongue is big chocolate and cinnamon flavors followed by spicy habanero peppers that linger, and a slight soy sauce taste that is to be expected with these double digit ABV stouts. The mouthfeel is heavy, creamy, and decadent.  Finally completed the trilogy of Hunahpu's, Abraxas, and Mexican Cake. Didn't think anything would top Hunahpu's, but I think the habanero peppers push this one over the top. I can see why this scores lower though, as some people may find the peppers overpowering.  It's just the right amount of heat for me though. 835 charactersMJSFS, Jun 20, 2017

When I am confronting a big stout, the first thing I look at is the head - is it dense enough and brawny enough to warrant sitting atop a majestic stout?
A resounding "Yes!!!" in this case.  Dark tan head, perched atop an inky black body.  All the specified (on the bottle label) aromas are present - cocoa nibs, vanilla beans, cinnamon, habanero peppers, and they blend together perfectly. 
The taste ..... the taste follows the aromas, but the habanero takes a front seat - or actually, a back seat, because the habanero shows up at the back of the taste, and does not relinquish control.
I would compare this very favorably with Abraxas.  I don't say that lightly. 828 charactersovaltine, Jun 19, 2017

Oily look coming from the bottle, but not as thick as some stouts I've poured.  The head comes already creamed into a smooth, very small bubbled brown cap to this beer.  The head doesn't fall too quickly, but gets to a point of half centimeter atop the black body and waits for me to start sipping.
But first, the nose.  My initial quick sniff shows a bit of char with a little dark chocolate.  A second sniff confirms the dark chocolate and maybe just the lightest hint of marshmallow - but the char is now a mix of roasted malt, earthiness, and maybe even a hint of coffee sizzling on the burner after a not too careful pour from the carafe.
Taste is more dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, brownie on the chocolate side.  There's a little earthy spice dryness in the middle - maybe cinnamon or nutmeg like.  A roasty, regular stout malt note comes next, followed by a very light and brief malty sweetness.  The ending is a bit slick and the beer slides off my palate surprisingly quickly.  A light ashen chocolate remains to watch my palate's reaction to the light acutely tingling burn that sneaks in at the end.  This heat slowly pervades further into the beginning taste not as heat - but as a mere accent of red peppery sweetness.
I like how the heat comes out, and find the level quite enjoyable.  I wish peppery bite came on a little earlier in the taste, but not too far forward.  The bulk of the beer is nicely put together with a chocolatey note that is sweetish but still can lay claim to being an imperial stout first. 1,542 characterscjgiant, May 30, 2017

S: Immediate chocolate and coffee (definite roasty note) , with some subtle pepper notes and touches of cinnamon
T: a pleasant and smoky sweetness comes out right away, with a clean bitterness on the back end, the vanilla begins to come through as the beer warms up a bit, there is a subtle touch of heat here, but nothing pronounced, as the beer sits out even more, the cinnamon comes into view, being the last thing here to overtly reveal itself (could do with a hair less cinnamon, as it begins to dominate the longer the beer sits)
M: silky and thick, nice
O: This is a very delicious and very well executed beer, all that is promised on the label is delivered with a good balance, there are better spiced stouts out there in my opinion, but not many, Westbrook deserves all the praise they receive on this one.
PS: I would have liked to see a touch more heat (from the peppers, not the alcohol) 1,111 charactersJackRWatkins, May 27, 2017
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75L - Pitch black and completely opaque, almost matte.  DARK brown head fades quickly with small-medium bubbles
S - Brownies and coffee with dark chocolate, some cinnamon
T - milk chocolate, cinnamon (like cinnamon toast).  A hint of spice at the front, that is swallowed by almost cloying sweetness.  Finish is dark chocolate with a little more spice, like red hots.
F - Pure velvet: smooth and creamy.  
O - A top ten beer in the style.  I has class, uniqueness, allure and staying power.  Wow. 494 charactersdspadaro, May 24, 2017

Otherwise, cake hits a home run. Body is just right. Carbonation is perfect for the style. The combination of a bit of sweetness, a touch of bitterness, dryness at the end, cocoa, vanilla, and all in the right proportions. Wow! I cannot recommend this beer enough. 376 charactersClemsonMike, May 22, 2017

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Pours slightly less than motor oil thick and leaves an inch of dark khaki head that quickly dissipated and leaves a thin ring around the edge of the glass.  The smell is pretty divine with strong vanilla notes. A bit of roast as well and a slight bit of booze. The combination of the chocolate and vanilla actually gives it a slightly woody smell. The taste does not live up to the smell unfortunately.  All the flavors are kind of muted. You definitely get chocolate and not much cinnamon.  The cinnamon adds more sweetness than actual cinnamon flavor. There is only the slightest touch of heat; you get more pepper flavor than heat. My biggest gripe with this beer is in the mouthfeel. Even though it poured thick, it feels thin, almost watery.  Overall this beer is really good but with more body it would be approaching great. 830 charactersAmguerra305, Feb 09, 2017

Pours opaque black with a thin beige head that quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. The smell is of cinnamon, oak and chilli peppers. The taste follows with cocoa, cinnamon, habañero and vanilla. Medium texture with medium carbonation. 263 charactersFurlinator, Dec 25, 2016

3.76/5  rDev -14.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pours out dark brown and black, equal parts, 1/2" tan head on the top, maybe as low as 2/5".  Aroma of chocolate, roast.  I didn't really pull cinnamon out of this one.  Very mild pepper aspect.  
Taste, now some of the adjuncts are coming out.  Vanilla, peppers and cinnamon, none of which dominate, even though chocolate is the first among equals I guess.  A slight bitterness from the roasting, and moderate hop usage.   The mouth feel is where this beer is strongest, it hides the alcohol well, it has a substantial bragging right about 'balance' between everything. 
Its a good beer.  Is it worth the price of admission?   Depends on how much you value your time.  I'd buy at retail, wouldn't wait in line.  Anything secondary, trading or value, GFY. 757 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 13, 2016

Perfectly balanced flavors, love a stout with cinnamon and chilis in it if done right. I can't decide if this is better than Abraxas but you cannot go wrong with either. The stout had tons of flavor, nice smell of cinnamon, peppers, and chocolate, and great feel. Try it if you can. 395 charactersMeyers1023, Dec 13, 2016

4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4650ml bottle into a Spiegleau Stout glass. Paid £16.75 for a single.
Pours a completely opaque, dark black body, that when held to the light allows some ruby glimmers to be observed near the edges of the glass. A thin, bubbly, one-finger in height, dark tan coloured head reduces to a thin cap and collar, leaving behind minuscule specs of soapy lace. 
The subtle nose predominantly comprises of lightly roasted dark malts and bittersweet chocolate. Underneath impressions of smoke and char become apparent after warming, and once revealed remain in the background throughout. Cinnamon and vanilla additions are particularly evident, however habanero peppers are faintly perceptible at best and only really found when specifically searched for. On the end, hints of rum-like alcohol compliment the sweet and spicy aroma. Taste follows suit, adding increased complexity throughout. Dark roasted malts, semi-sweet baking chocolate, earthy cocoa, and hints of smoke capture an incredibly rich and robust roast profile upfront, whilst avoiding burnt and ashy characters, but retaining impressive intensity. Mid palate, cinnamon and vanilla join light brown sugar to provide a subtle sweetness, lingering long enough to soften the introduction of habanero peppers towards the finish. In the mouth, a medium to full body paired with minimal carbonation starts slick, smooth, and just a little sticky. Towards the back end, returning dark roasted malts, bitter cocoa, espresso, char and smoke blend seamlessly with lingering chili, vanilla and cinnamon to build a smooth, lengthy, bittersweet-spicy finish alongside a pleasant trace of warming heat. After the swallow, sharp dark roast, cinnamon, habanero spice and subtle rum-like alcohol linger for an age to somehow finish slightly crisp, astringent and chalky but also with satiating oily richness.
Overall this is a fantastic beer. Rich, robust and complex, it harmoniously integrates delicate chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili additions with a base stout easily good enough to stand on its own. Perhaps the habanero profiles could be a little more pronounced, but ultimately subtlety and balance are key here to success. Recommended. 2,191 characters911CROFT, Dec 04, 2016

I had an Evil Twin collaboration Biscotti Cake Break on tap a few days ago & thought that was what I had at home. I was wrong, but in a good way.
The Biscotti Cake Break was tasty but muddled. I was left with a feeling like I had seen the beginning & end of a movie, but missed the middle.
Not so with this. All the characters showed up. The chocolate is big. Starts big, stays big & ends big. The fascinating thing is during each mouthful, different character shows up at different times. Chocolate with Vanilla, then cinnamon arrives, then it's more chocolate but a bigger, darker chocolate & the finish has just a hint of the heat. Really complex & really interesting & very, very good.
As with all works of this nature, if at first your not impressed, let it warm a bit. You'll be glad you did. 873 charactersseedyone, Nov 27, 2016

Strong chili pepper aroma.  Roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and a touch of espresso.  Nice complementary vanilla.  Cinnamon comes through as it warms.  
Heat from the peppers right away.  Roasted malt, a bit bitter and with a bit of char.  Cinnamon is stronger than what the nose would lead you to expect.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, and caramel.  Getting a bit of licorice and smoke at the end.
Medium body with medium carbonation.  Lots of heat from the peppers.  Mild bitterness.  
Great beer with lots of heat.  Spicier than both Huna or Abraxas.  Flavors really blend nicely. 784 charactersleroybrown10, Nov 19, 2016

Look- Pours a thick black used motor oil color with a trace amount of light brown foam. It forms a thin ring around the glass leaving no lacing behind. 
Smell- Chocolate cake batter, cinnamon, a hint of vanilla and earthy peppers. 
Taste- The cinnamon hits first followed by dark chocolate and a little vanilla. The habanero peppers are quite sneaky and appear in the finish. 
Feel- Semi thick and oily with mouth tingling heat that starts slowly and builds as you take more sips. 
Overall- I'm a big fan of the style and this was a huge want that did not disappoint. Thick body, huge chocolate and spice flavor with a solid but not overwhelming shot of heat from the habanero peppers. It's literally a liquid Mexican cake dessert! I want more and can only imagine what the barrel aged version tastes like? 906 charactersPrager62, Nov 06, 2016

3.43/5  rDev -21.9%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5650ml brown glass bottle. $21 per 22 fl oz bottle.
10.50% ABV. "Imperial Stout." "Malt beverage with cocoa nibs, vanilla beans, cinnamon, and habanero peppers added." The bottled on field reads only "516." 
HEAD: None. Only a dark floater ring. No lacing.
BODY: Opaque solid black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Looks like any pretty good but not unique imperial stout.
AROMA: Cinnamon spice, subtle vinegary habanero chili pepper, chocolate specialty malt, dark malts, cacao nibs, a vague vanilla note (not genuine vanilla bean, but something flirting with that), nougat, fudge, Hershey's syrup.
Aromatic intensity is mild to moderate. I detect no overt hop notes, yeast notes, off-notes, or alcohol.
TASTE: Hits on chocolate and vinegary chili pepper, providing mild chili heat without overdoing it. Hints of rich Hershey's chocolate syrup. Richly sweet chocolate malts, a heavy presence of sweet dark malts, spicy cinnamon. Yes, the subtle Chile heat balances out the malt sweetness nicely, but it's not ideally dialed in.
Sweetness is well checked by the habanero, but the cacao flavour is nice. I don't find any roasted barley or coffee.
Duration and intensity of flavour are nice.
TEXTURE: Flirts with a syrupy texture to perfect extent, coming off sticky to just the right degree whilst maintaining an apt thickness and medium to full body. Well-carbonated. Unrefreshing (obviously). Smooth and wet. A more powdery, creamy, soft mouthfeel might serve it well.
OVERALL: I hoped for a world class beer given the reputation this has, and in that respect I was perhaps a bit disappointed. But damn if it doesn't have some really lovely elements that force me to question my initial underwhelmed impression.
I don't find it dazzling or incredible, but there's a great deal here to enjoy and I wouldn't shy away from trying it again.
Competent fare from a talented brewery.

A- Bomber into the mini glass with a motor oil black body and a deep nutty tan head. The cap is frothy rising up to half a finger before falling down to a small ring at the edges. Decent head retention and rare spotty lace.
S- The dusty cocoa nibs lead the aroma with a large dose of the roasty vegetable skin from the peppers. Coffee comes in next with plenty of woody, earthy cinnamon. Vanilla sweets and a large base of deeply roasted but smooth dark barley.
T- Takes on much more of a chocolate milk feel here with that classic Hershey chocolate flavor forming the backbone of the beer. Next coming out mostly equally is the woody spicy cinnamon, a touch of habanero heat, medium roast coffee, vanilla bean dessert sweets and some caramel. The grains are very much present with charred barley and a coffeehouse roast feeling.
MF- Silky and creamy body with moderately high fluffy carbonation. A tad slick and certainly somewhat chewy. Ends with a slow rising pepper heat and some alcohol warming.
A Mexican cake or more like a hot chocolate in a bomber. The elements are all well balanced with spicy cinnamon and cocoa taking a slight edge. 1,173 characterscbutova, Aug 22, 2016

F:  Just like a world class stout should feel:   Solid, almost chewable, very little carbonation but enough to keep this beer just light enough to be extremely drinkable.
O: Instantly an all time favorite.   This is probably the best executed stout that I have ever had. 656 charactersPontzie, Aug 21, 2016

Aromas of cinnamon sugar, cold brew coffee, vanilla, leather, burnt malts coming through. Very roasty and sweet. 
On the palate is super smooth coffee, cocoa, and  gooey chocolatey cinnamon brownies up front, followed by dark malts, roasted nuttiness, vanilla, oak, really pleasant touch of spicy heat on the finish. 
Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side but honestly it coats quite well and there is an impressive length on the finish, roasty and sweet flavors lingering followed by some heat from cinnamon and peppers. Very chewy and complex. Overall this one is basically perfect in terms of balance between decadent sweetness, dark roasty notes, and pleasant touch of spice…. Cinnamon is a game changer on this in my opinion. Really well done! 785 charactersHyptochrons, Aug 12, 2016

S: chilies, cinnamon and dark chocolate. I love that I can smell all three
T: chilies and cinnamon upfront, then the chocolate comes in for balance. It then finishes with huge chile heat. A bit too much heat in end for me. 
F: thick, so smooth. Velvet feel. I just wish the flavors lingered longer to balance the chilies
O: this is a clear third to huna and abraxas. But a even bigger  step back from ba bourbon Mexican cake. The bourbon balances the chilies out and it almost perfect. Skip this one and just get the bourbon version. 647 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Jul 30, 2016

S- chocolate syrup with light cinnamon and vanilla
T- very much along the lines of the aroma but with added booze, it really is an alcoholic chocolate cake. exotic chocolate,light cinnamon, i don't really pick up any of the habaneros, that's not a complaint though as it tastes fantastic.
F- not overly thick and has some carbonation but the mouthfeel fits the taste perfectly.

The aroma positively stinks of cinnamon, milk chocolate, brownies and fudge, marshmallows, vanilla beans, coffee, caramel, and burnt toast.
The palate is an onslaught of rich, desserty flavors.  Upfront, you get the milk chocolate, fudge, and caramel candy, with a savory, umami note.  Then you get a harsh dark roast coffee, and then a milky smooth vanilla, cream, and coconut sweetness.  Finally it finishes with a zap of fresh ground cinnamon, dried chili pepper, and boozy warmth.  The warmth is not harsh, but smoothly bracing and welcome.  The aftertaste lingers, but of a smooth mixture of dark chocolate and cinnamon, chili pepper, and bourbon warmth.
The mouthfeel is lighter than I thought it would be, closer to medium than full, but slick and greasy, and lightly carbonated.
Is this beer worth its reputation?  In this BA's opinion, hell yes! 937 charactersHorseheadsHopHead, Jul 15, 2016

Flavor is sweet and chocolatey up front, tons of cinnamon, hints of vanilla and a slight roasty heat from the pepper. Flavors are big and bold, but it doesn't seem overly sweet and still has the roasty stout qualities. Feel is full bodied with a lingering stickiness and medium carbonation. A huge, bold stout that makes great use of the adjuncts. 534 charactersstephenjmoore, Jul 05, 2016

~1 month from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a black color, oily and viscous, opaque. Half finger thick, dark khaki colored head, creamy thick, dissipates quickly. Coats glass like a film, lots of alcohol legs and spotty head lacing.
Aroma- Rich dark chocolates and roasted malt, bittersweet and decadent. Creamy milk chocolates, vanilla, sweet sugar, caramel, earthy spice and cinnamon.
Taste- Dark chocolates, dry bittersweet cocoa, coffee, lots of roasted malt. Milk chocolates, vanilla, sweet milky sugars combined with cinnamon. Earthy spicy peppers on the finish, mild heat.
Feel- Medium to full feel, dry bittersweetness, lots of richness and creaminess. Moderate to lower carbonation.
Overall- Rich and decadent beer. Roastiness and dark chocolatey flavors take center stage, as the rest of the adjuncts are more mild and work towards adding some complexity. Cinnamon and peppers flash towards the finish and are well integrated into the beer. 970 charactersOrangeMen, Jul 01, 2016

I ordered Mexican cake, knowing nothing about it other than the description on the blackboard. Needless to say, its one of the best stouts I've ever had and the best beer I've had in at least 2 years. It had immense flavor like chocolate cake. It was creamy, great mouthfeel. The flavors exploded in my mouth. I would have drank the beer all night, but the keg kicked and I got the last of it. This is a truly exceptional beer.

4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass (2017 release, 1 month old). Appearance is thick and almost black with brown around the edges, 1/2 finger thick brown head and good retention. Smell is a good balance of cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of pepper heat. 
Taste has more heat throughout that is perfectly done. After a while, the Habanero flavor comes through. There is more Cocoa nibs than vanilla but both are there, definitely a hint of chocolate cake. Bitterness is fairly high balancing out the moderate sweetness. Mouthfeel is viscous and creamy but not too heavy with a refreshing finish.
Overall, this may be my favorite Mexican stout due to the balance of flavors. Cocoa nibs, Cinnamon, Vanilla, and peppers all come through very well. I like that it is not overly sweet. There is a good amount of heat in the 2017 version, which was lacking in last year's edition. This beer lives up to the hype. 920 charactersthatche2, Jun 25, 2016

Smell-  Cocoa, Cinnamon, Vanilla .  Loved the smell
Taste- Up front chocolate with vanilla second in line but the peppers are def there leaving a hot aftertaste I have not experienced before.
Mouthfeel was medium 
Overall-  While I have def had better imperial stouts, this was enjoyable.  I can see how the pepper would def turn some people off, as I did not expect the aftertaste from it.  That being said, I am stoked I was able to try it and would down the road  def drink this again if I had opportunity. 553 charactersjcflorian, Jun 25, 2016

It smells of roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, and the habanero peppers. It's an extremely fragrant stout. The first taste sensation is dark chocolate and burnt coffee, followed by vanilla, cinnamon, and the peppers. It finishes with a nice peppery heat. Despite its 10.5% ABV, it is not overly boozy; it lets the peppers provide both heat and flavor.  It has a medium-chewy mouthfeel and is overall very pleasant to drink. Overall, Mexican Cake is delicious and fun to drink.  It richly deserves its world-class rating.  I'm really happy to have finally tried it. 755 charactersMacMalt, Jun 19, 2016

Look is just black with no head and no lacing, nothing special
Smell - Chocolate, vanilla, and spicy peppers. awesome smell.
Taste - 2016 is much milder on the spice than years previous, but I prefer that.  (Also side note: can't believe I haven't reviewed the most sought after beer in my state until now).  But the chocolate and vanilla is awesome and the mild habaneros with cinnamon compliment it perfectly.  Sweet, bitter, spicy all in perfect unison.
Feel - Light body for an 11% stout.  Mild carbonation
Overall - Well done this year.  I rate this higher than in years past but if you love spice you won't like 2016 as much as I do 656 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Jun 12, 2016

Aroma of black chocolate notes with roasted malt is pretty nice. Taste is a nice mix of roasted malt and black chocolate with some residual sugar notes, some cinnamon notes and some spicy peppers notes which really only become noticeable in the aftertaste. Body is quite full with nice creamy notes and good carbonation. Solid imperial stout thought spicy notes becomes a bit too much for my liking. 512 charactersPhyl21ca, May 24, 2016

4.83/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Finally got my hands on one. 2015 version, poured into a snifter.
Pour is jet black, viscous and slightly oily. Hits the glass with absolutely no head initially, and bubbles up to a half finger khaki color. Settles to a small ring. Minimal retention because of this.
Smell is deep chocolate, roasted malts and hints of vanilla. Not much of a cinnamon or pepper profile until it warmed up, then it came out a little bit. Still very subtle.
Taste totally makes up for the nose. Chocolate and roasted malts initially, then subtle cinnomon comes through than you get that pop of habanero pepper in the back end. I found the spicy linger very enjoyable. Similar to the nose, the heat is more noticable as it warms.
Mouthfeel is low carbonation, velvety and very smooth. 
Very impressive pepper stout. Comparing this to Bomb, the only other pepper stout I've had, this one definitely had more of heat going on especially as it warms. More viscous and flavorful as well. 968 charactersMateo2699, May 15, 2016

4.01/5  rDev -8.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Motor oil black, with a dark mocha head that is very thin and fizzy and does not retain at all aside from a thin ring. Shimmering curtains of miniature, caviar-like bubbles coat the glass after each sip and quickly glide down.
It does in fact smell like chocolate cake batter, with no foreshadowing of the upcoming spice or heat whatsoever. Actually, more appropriately, its aroma is reminiscent of chocolate cherry cake. Cinnamon blooms with some smokey roastiness only as it has warmed.
Habanero heat tentacles climb around the edges of the cheeks and hit you in the back of the throat right off of the first sip. Black cherry and cinnamon follow shortly after. Chocolate takes a back seat, but as is typical of the habanero calling card, heat builds and builds. Fortunately it stops after a certain level, never becoming overwhelming, at least for me. Although, the first few sips had a little heat venting out through the nose.
If you had Xocoveza, Bomb, and Huna, and wondered where the heat was, this is the beer that will do it for you. All others should probably stay away. This has some scovilles that you can actually feel heating up the belly.
Mexican Cake has a medium body and is slightly frothy, but is also a bit thinner than I'd like. 1,254 charactersSabtos, May 07, 2016

Aroma: Deep rich chocolate and vanilla sweetness with the peppers and cinnamon gently coming through.
Taste: The chocolate and the vanilla appear immediately with the cinnamon showing up through the entire taste. The habanero peppers are perfectly done adding only a hint of spiciness on the finish that offers a relief from the sweetness and furthers the complexity. There's absolutely no alcohol coming through.
Mouthfeel: Rich velvety and full mouthfeel with medium-low carbonation. The richness of the beer coats the mouth like a decadent dessert

Dark and opaque with minor brown accented head of about an inch.  Significant lacing present.
I am clearly picking up the chocolate, cinnamon, and pepper.  The vanilla are alcohol are there too but not dominate and only presented themselves as the beer warmed .
Taste is minor sweet chocolate upfront mixed with vanilla and a very mild peppery finish.
Mouthful is medium but creamy and velvetly.  Carbonation is low.  Finish is lingering.
Wow.  This was a great beer that maintained balance between sweetness and spice throughout.  Very enjoyable and shareable.  I will seek this out again. 644 charactersSlack, Feb 14, 2016

Review #1125
Super oily and viscous, near pitch black appearance. Shimmery and ominous looking in the glass.  The liquid was topped by a wisp of saddle brown froth that quickly dissolved to a thin collar.
The aroma was amazingly enticing and intense. Chocolate fudge notes dominated. Rich, dark and robust. Chocolate syrup also came to mind. Subtle spice notes. Cinnamon was detectible. Loads of brown sugar as well. Bit of molasses. As the beer sat, the nose opened up even more. The spice notes intensified. Both the cinnamon and nutmeg became much stronger. I also picked up some vanilla.
The flavor profile was solid but a bit less nuanced. Bakers chocolate appeared on the front end, but it was quickly overshadowed by the intense roasted malt notes. Hint of vanilla sweetness in the center. Bitter espresso appeared on the back end along with a touch of smoke. Chili pepper notes rounded out the beer in the finish. The spiciness really hit hard in the back of my throat and crescendoed after the swallow. I definitely felt some warmth in my stomach as well. Roasty notes lingered. As the beer warmed, a bit more sweetness came forth. Brown sugar was detectible. Touch of nutmeg as well.
The mouthfeel was solid. Medium-full bodied for the style. Oily. Creamy, plush and smooth on the palate.
Mexican Cake was an enjoyable beer, but there are definitely a number of other Mexican chocolate-type stouts that I would take over this. Perhaps a fresher bottle would display stronger baking spice notes and more sweetness to help balance out the heat of the habanero peppers. 1,693 charactersDamian, Jan 19, 2016

Big cocoa aroma with hints of vanilla and winter spice
Flavour goes from there with a little Irishing and some lovely warming chilli heat that isn't overbearing 
Nicely and lowly carbonated and solid without being heavy going

Poured into a snifter.
A - Pours a black brown color with a small tan head that settles to a thin cap with no lacing.
S - The aroma is complex and wonderful.  Lots of chocolate, molasses, cinnamon and booze. 
T - Flavor is all of the above plus vanilla and the heat of the peppers on finish.
M - Medium thick mouth feel with low carbonation.
O - Wow, there is so much flavor coming at you with this beer. Great taste and the heat is just right. 470 charactersspacecake9, Nov 28, 2015

The first sips release lots of cocoa first, very smooth like milk chocolate, with notes of vanilla and cinnamon coming through shortly after in a fantastic harmony. The habanero heat comes in right on the finish, and I must say is the best use of peppers I've had in any beer to date. Nice habanero flavor and just the right kick of heat on your mouth and throat. Such a fantastic beer, really glad I got to try this whale on draft. 508 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Nov 28, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This review is for the 2015 that was a few months old. Deep black color with not a whole lot of carbonation. On the nose, the chocolate is the only thing keeping the habanero and even cinnamon on a leash. Tasting hits in spice, chocolate, spice and finally chocolate again... yes, with lingering heat and some dryness from what seems to be the cinnamon. It has a thick, viscous mouthfeel. I will say that I've also had a tapped version of 2014 almost one year later, and indeed, a number of dimensions faded, but I thought the chocolate emerged fully dominant; it thickened and was like chocolate milk that was really heavy on the chocolate syrup. 
Overall, out of the bottle, it's very bold on the chocolate, habanero and cinnamon. Vanilla helps the chocolate hold it together. Leans heavier on the habanero and cinnamon, though. 830 charactersSki3PO, Oct 27, 2015

Very subtle notes of cinnamon and pepper. Decent mouthfeel/thickness. Good. Will have to try fresher version for comparison.
Update: Had 2015 version with 6 months if aging. Definitely better fresh. Had more pepper spiciness and cinnamon flavor to it. Seemed a bit thinner and had less chocolate notes. Preferred this fresher bottle however. 455 charactersKevinpitts, Oct 24, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Just had this last night.  It was brewed in May of 2015.  Poured into a Teku glass and shared with my Dad.  Took the bottle out of the fridge about 25 minutes before I opened it.  Poured dark, but not a ton of head.  Also, the viscosity was thinner than I had expected.
Took a taste and immediately hit with chocolate.  Subtle hints of vanilla and cinnamon, but definitely takes a back seat to chocolate which starts out at the beginning,and then the habanero peppers finish it with some serious heat and bitterness.
Overall, a great beer.  Just wish it was easier to obtain as I would drink this more often. 610 charactersThomasJ25, Oct 13, 2015

3.67/5  rDev -16.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to vicjr85 for sharing this with me. Coincidentally this was my 100th review. I am a big fan of the "mexican style" stout, and this was a beer I have been wanting to try for a long time. Unfortunately, it didn't compare to other stouts in the same category (Huna, Abraxas, etc.).  This beer pours a thick black stout with nice head. Smells of chocolate, pepper, roasted malts.  I get no cinnamon and no vanilla.  
The biggest problem with this beer is the taste. I can tell that it has good base stout, but the habanero is unbelievable. It totally overtakes every other flavor. I can't taste anything other than chocolate and pepper. It actually started to make my stomach hurt. The pepper is too much. A little pepper goes a looooong way, espcially with habaneros. I wanted to love this beer, but I was greatly disappointed. 832 charactersboothbeer, Oct 12, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Been wanting to review this one for a while after getting a taste at a bottle share. The beer is a beautiful pour into my snifter, with a thick and viscous appearance and a creamy, dark head forming as the beer swirls. The head is about 1.5 fingers in thickness and a really dark, chocolate color. It hangs around a while before it reduces to just a ring of dense foam on the edges, which end up leaving a pretty good amount of lacing. Time to take a sniff of this dark nectar. Huge chocolate that is well balanced between sweet and lightly bitter hits the nose first and is quickly chased by the habaneros. The peppers give the scent a good dose of the anticipated heat and spice, and are followed up by the cinnamon. The combination of the peppers and cinnamon give the beer a big, spicy presence that mixes all together with the sweeter notes of chocolate and vanilla and give the overall smell a delicious impression.
Taking a drink of this enticing smelling liquid, the first flavor that hits you is once again the chocolate. This time, the chocolate is a little bit sweeter than it was in the scent, and is accompanied by a touch of light vanilla sweetness as well before the habaneros make their presence known. The peppers hit in a spicy bang and then fade away for a bit, giving way to the cinnamon and rounding out the spiciness. The peppers make a strong and triumphant return at the very end of the drink with a big, spicy, and hot burn on the back of the tongue and down the throat. The lingering flavor is definitely the peppery heat, but also a touch of the cinnamon and chocolate. All during the drink, this beer is thick and smooth on the tongue, with a creaminess and little to no alcohol burn. Aside from the moderate pepper heat, this beer is insanely drinkable for the alcohol content.
Overall, this beer is probably my favorite among the Mexican chocolate stouts I have had. I really enjoy that peppers are strong, yet not distracting to the other flavors in the beer. The burn that the peppers add really add a unique and delicious quality that is unique to the beer. Basically, this beer confirms that I like my beer as spicy as I like my food. 2,170 charactersboilermakerbrew, Oct 02, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52015 bottle. Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Westbrook oversize snifter. Acquired in a trade. 
Pours a jet black, opaque inky body with a deep brown 2 finger head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of brown retention, very little lacing but the color of the head and body are magnificent and deep in color. 
Allowed it to warm up for ~30 minutes, as this is when the aromas started coming through. Big milk chocolate and vanilla, some cinnamon and a hint of peppers in the background, nice roastyness on the nose as well. 
On the tongue is rich milk chocolate (chocolate cake almost!), coffee-like roasty notes, vanilla and caramel, followed by a toasted malt, charred character that lingers on the tongue for a while. The aftertaste has a little peppery bite to it, but it's subtle and adds a nice dimension. The mouthfeel is awesome, heavy, rich body with low carbonation, just how an imperial stout should feel. 
Overall I'm very impressed, and I almost feel as this is underrated. I know it's hyped, but the hype is worth it and in my opinion it tops the other popular mexican style stouts (huna, abraxas) 1,116 charactersgcamparone, Sep 27, 2015

Very good.   Not bitter.  Complex but not as thick as I would like.   For my money,  Heir Apparent is nearly as good. 417 charactersuvachief, Aug 31, 2015

Smell - Robust, with cinnamon and cocoa beans, but pepper is probably most present..  
Taste - Cinnamon and vanilla dominate.  Not your usual IS.
Feel - Initially smooth, but chillies start kicking in toward back end... especially as the beer warms.
Overall - a different kind of stout.  Great change of pace and very complex with it's many ingredients.  Would love to have this from time to time. 477 characterseifster82, Aug 22, 2015

Poured from a growler into a Sam Adams perfect pint. This beer is as black as night with no light getting through at all, perfectly fitting for the style. Head is brown, but quite small. Smell is amazing. Chocolate, roasted malt and habanero peppers. Taste is much the same, actually very spicy on the back end, but in a good way. The feel is slick and medium bodied with good carbonation. Not boozy at all and overall this beer lives up to/exceeds the hype. Absolutely will seek this out again although it seems I got very lucky to score it in the first place. 637 charactersCNoj012, Aug 07, 2015

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light brown head that retains well before dissipating. Some lacing leaves behind a ring. 
S- Aroma is full of cinnamon and chocolate. Also some very light vanilla and a hint of the habanero. 
T- Big chocolate and a little cinnamon at first which makes each sip so decadent. Then, the heat kicks in on the back of the tongue. This one burns a bit. I wish there was more of a cinnamon presence but this tastes quite good as it is. 
M- Semi viscous, which I expected due to how thick it poured. Definitely coats the mouth and throat a bit. 
O- Fantastic beer. I only wish I got a touch more cinnamon in the flavor and a bit less heat. 744 charactersRAlmeida77, Aug 03, 2015

The nose does a poor job of letting the tongue know about the kind of spicy kick it is in store for.  Super creamy, spicy as hell (much more than other spiced stouts I have tried), a huge dose of chocolate, and some timely cinnamon.  For an undoubtedly poor comparison, I feel it is similar to Abraxas if Cory were to get extra frisky on the peppers for a batch. 466 charactersBosoxfan20, Aug 01, 2015

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light brown head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and minimal surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind.
S- Aroma is bursting with cinnamon and chocolate.  Also some vanilla and a hint of the habanero pepper.   Vibrantly sweet-smelling with some booze fume coming out more as it warms.
T- Sweet at first with the chocolate and cinnamon dominating, then the pepper burn comes in on the finish.  The flavors meld remarkably well together.  A bit of char in the aftertaste.  The ABV is hidden very well as I'm enticed to take more and more sips.  Honestly, the pepper burn starts to catch up to me quicker than the booze forcing me to wait until it subsides before I continue drinking.
M- Soft and creamy.  Caipsacin burn starts to build in the back of the throat and stays.  Medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- Excellent but the pepper burn is just a teency bit too much for me to enjoy more than 8-10 oz at a time. 1,119 charactersImmortale25, Jul 27, 2015

Smells like a chocolate cake just from the oven - remarkable. Initial flavors of chocolate and chili peppers; chocolate middle with warming peppery bite; alcohol flavor is well hidden. Hot, slick mouthfeel; my tongue tingles with chili pepper and alcohol - finish is pure chile rellenos stuffed with bittersweet chocolate. Overall, if you like hot and spicy, this peppery/chocolate stout is for you; tops in its class. 506 charactersDoctorZombies, Jul 24, 2015

A — Pours a nearly opaque, very dark dark brown color into the glass, comes out of the bottle quite quickly and immediately seems a bit thin. When held up to the light you can see some dark brown hues and waves of light around the edges. There is a coffee colored head atop the beer that fades somewhat quickly and leaves some spotty and sticky lacing around the edges.
S — This beer has a nice aroma before you even put your nose up into it, can smell lots of chocolates, cinnamon, brown sugar, caramel, coffee, cocoa. There is a bit of a sharpness to it though, not super rich or chewy, but there is a fair depth of aromas going on here.
T — Tastes initially much like the nose, with some really nice coffee and chocolate character, like chocolate frosting, quite sweet. Little bit of vanilla and caramel as well. As you get towards the finish you are hit with a large sharp nearly burning heat, hello chili peppers! What once was a nice if not overly sweet stout, is now a steaming hot spice war.
M — Medium-Full bodied, expected this to be full bodied and much thicker though.
O — A good beer overall, I just wish there would have been a bit more balance to this one, maybe over time there will be a mellowing out of the chili heat, only one way to find out! 1,332 charactersMoose90, Jul 21, 2015

S- I get bitter chocolate, big roasty flavors. Some booze. 
T- chocolate, roast, you definitely get the cinnamon flavors and the spiciness from the peppers really finish off the sip nicely. 
M- heavy-medium feel. Like drinking boozy chocolate cake batter. Moderately carb'ed. Booze hidden well in sip. Actually get more heat from the peppers.

Smell: faint notes of coffee 
Taste: dominant coffee notes, cinnamon flavor comes through in the middle and finishes with a lingering warmth from the chiles. The chocolate is somewhat muted by the coffee and I don't notice the vanilla it seems to just add an overall warmth. With all the complexity of the beer the alcohol is barely noticeable.
Feel: medium carbonation thick syrupy mouthfeel, drinks like liquid cake.
Overall a great beer and lives up to the name. 526 charactersAngryPenguinBrewCo, Jul 09, 2015

S: Moderate aromas of cocoa nibs and vanilla beans are present in the nose very small amounts of chili on the nose.
T: Cinnamon, and chili very present on the front end. On the backend mass amounts of cocoa and vanilla really shine through. Not a lot of spiciness but a good chili backbone.
M: It feels medium bodied.
O: Great chili stout, everything shines though out the beer. There isn't much heat but the chili really helps bring another dimension to all the other flavors of the beer. 565 characterstaix, Jun 29, 2015

Cocoa and cinnamon flowing through the creamy, thick stout body and finishes with crackling habanero.  Minimal carbonation but the tingling from the chile makes it seem a little more carbonated than it is.  Beautiful all around.  One of the best beers that I have had.  Will continue to seek it out whenever I can! 357 charactersReds76, Jun 29, 2015

4.43/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottled 5/6/2015->bottle says best consumed fresh, don’t age it: Pours pitch black opaque color with a thick 2 finger brown head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded about average time for a stout leaving decent spotty lacing and rings as it went down. A layer sticks around on top. 
Smells of cocoa powder, dark chocolate, light vanilla, coffee grinds, charred wood, roasted malts, oaky notes, smoke, toffee and brown sugar; the spice is evident, but it does not smell like a pepper, especially a habanero. Earthy notes mix well with the chocolate and smoked malts, adding a lot of complexities for basically a one dimensional aroma. 
Taste is where all the ingredients on the label show up: the cocoa nibs, vanilla beans and cinnamon are all quite pronounced and the habanero brings immediate head that does not hurt but adds a whole new aspect and feel to the beer. The heat is like wasabi, it strikes adding some instant heat and flavor, and trails off nicely and allows the malty side show off with appearances by the cocoa powder, dark chocolate, coffee grinds, charred wood, roasted malts, oaky notes, smoke, molasses, toffee, brown sugar and some spices. Seems like piney hops are in the mix along with white pepper and fresh ground black peppercorns, along with a shot of bourbon or whiskey. The alcohol gets covered up by the habanero burn, which warms up the back of your throat and belly in the best way possible for those who like hot peppers or spicy food. The cinnamon and vanilla come on strong at the end with a mild bitterness blending with char and chocolate notes. Considering the level of heat from the habanero this drinks much smoother than it should and remains very interesting and complex with every sip. 
Mouthfeel is very creamy and milkshake smooth, with very mild and almost thin carbonation, a medium chewy body that leans towards thick yet slides across the tongue, and then fades slightly bitter like a coffee with a lot of grinds in it and a full slap in the face of heat that stings and then fades slowly as it gets swapped out for dark chocolate, vanilla and spicy cinnamon. The blending and mixture of the main components really keep this dynamic and extremely interesting at the same time. This is an excellent display of brewing craftsmanship to bring such heat and booze so aggressively that results in a complex, tasty beer that flows down so smooth with such a velvety feel even though it seems like you just drank a shot or ate a jalapeño popper. 
I got this hoping for a great beer but expecting a novelty beer since it’s billed as a stout with habanero in the blend; it turned out to be a great brew that was changing and evolving with every sip, allowing the pepper heat to add accents which tweaked the beer each and every sip. Shock and awe, this was a great unique beer experience which exceeded my expectations. I thought this was great and hope to have it again some day. A lot of fun and a great combo if you love stouts and love spicy food. 3,005 charactersCHickman, Jun 22, 2015

S - chocolate notes take over, slight roasted coffee note hidden underneath. Slight hint of fusile barely detectable.
T - Immediate roasted, almost burnt malty coffee note. Giving Way to booziness and then moving into some coffee and chocolate. Pepper and a tiny bit of acetone/nail polish come in on the back tongue at the end and then a lingering pepper heat that is perfectly balanced all down the very back tongue and throat lingers for minutes.
M - Creamy, almost nitro creaminess. Excellently massive and almost chewable per mouthful.
O - excellent chili stout. One of the best. Picks up where prairie bombs leaves off, introduces more balance, and takes it up a notch. 823 charactersDarthXavius, Jun 21, 2015

A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a short tan head that died down, leaving wispy lacing on the surface and a thin layer of bubbles around the collar. 
S: Moderate aromas of cocoa nibs and vanilla beans are present in the nose along with notes of spicy chili peppers. 
T: The taste starts out with flavors of chocolate, cocoa nibs, and vanilla. It quickly transitions to spicy cinnamon followed by habanero peppers, the latter of which linger through the finish. 
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: This beer has an interesting contrast between the cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, and habanero peppers. The spiciness increases a bit as it warms up, but it isn't overly hot and does a good job masking most of its alcohol. Once fully warmed up, the chocolate and vanilla become stronger.

So smooth and well balanced. The peppers were not too hot, and the medium mouth feel held everything together quite well. I got some cinnamon and graham cracker sweetness, but I think the cinnamon had faded a little since this bottle was a year old. I look forward to trying this again when it is fresh. 411 charactersdanh53, Jun 13, 2015

What makes this imperial stout stand out from the rest is its complexity yet it is able to be so balanced. Front of the tongue you get so much chocolate. Then, the habaneros kick in. It is not too hot, though. Back of the mouth is vanilla and cinnamon to cool it down. You also get some coffee notes as well. In my opinion, this beer lives up to the hype. 412 charactersaleckpa, May 27, 2015

I didn't get a lot off the nose. A little vanilla but nothing that would hint at the flavors underneath the hood.
Tastes just as the name suggests, like a habanero infused chocolate cake. Wave after wave of chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malts, finishing with slight habanero burn on the back of the tongue.
Very impressed with how well they've been able to balance all these flavors. No one single aspect takes the stage but rather a cohesive marriage. 533 charactersKillJoy, May 24, 2015

Loved the habanero spice being so present if only to balance out the density of the other favors. As with many other "Mayan stouts", better as it warms though fell off at a certain point a few degrees above room temp. 
Overall, one of my new favorite beers.  Can't wait to find and enjoy some more very soon. 351 charactersSparkk, May 22, 2015

Smell - Great smell of chocolate and peppers.
Taste - Chocolate, roasted malt, mild cinnamon, and peppers up front with an amazing spicy aftertaste and slight burn down the throat.  It only gets better as it warms.
Feel - Smooth up front, full body, low carbonation, and great afterburn! 
Overall - I love this beer.  It's probably my favorite imperial stout.  The complex flavors only get better as it warms.  No boozy flavor at all. 504 charactersmmcurran, May 22, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look:  Luscious dark chocolate body.  Fine, dense, deep-colored mocha head.  With a twirl of the glass, the head curtains and easily cascades down the side of the glass.
Smell:  The smell is of Mexican hot chocolate, except this drink isn't warm in temperature.  Rich, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and sweetness.  Faint hints of mole spice.
Taste:  See above.  Mmmmmmm...The habanero pepper adds a nice little kick.  No alcohol detected, maybe I drink too much...Nah.
Feel:  Substantial.  Silk-smooth.  Creamy.  Dense.
Overall - I am impressed.  I thought the habanero kick would have significantly dissipated, but I was wrong.  Better than Hunahpu, no.  Better than Xocoveza, yes.  Better than Cafe Con Lech, different.  Better than Belching Beaver Horchata Milk Stout, different.  Nonetheless, these are all different beers with different adjuncts.  It does show how much ethnic tastes and flavors can influence beer.  This is a high end stout that shows off the Mexican influence.  This is definitely something I will seek out in the near future. 1,077 charactersmabermud, Apr 19, 2015

This is a difficult beer to acquire via trade and not worth trading for given its market value, though I would never turn it down at a tasting. 
There are other spiced stouts that could rival its flavor for a lower price of admission. 328 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 17, 2015

Pours thick and black with a short mocha head. Big chocolate character in the nose, sweet and milky backed by plenty of other spices (cinnimon, alspice, and maybe some chili).  The taste is very well balanced!  Up-front is the grain bill, big sweet and roasty, lots of chocoloate and coffee, then comes the spice at just the right balance and is followed/finished with the chilis on the finish with just enough heat to let you they are there. I admit I am not usually a big chili stout lover, but this one is realy well done. 566 charactersmtomlins, Mar 30, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I was very pleased to recently acquire two bottles of Mexican Cake from two great trading BAs, cvm4 (2013 vintage) and fordknox (2014 vintage). As a lover of "Mayan" imperial stouts, I've been eager to compare to one of my favorites for a long time. This review (and scores) will cover the 2014 vintage, but I may speak a bit to some of the most obvious differences between it and the 2013. Poured into an oversized brandy snifter.
Appearance (4.0) - I begin my pour moderately, but then begin to pour a bit more aggressively when I see that there isn't much head being coaxed out, ending up with about a finger of brown sugar colored head that lingers for a short period of time before dissipating to a ringlet around the edge of the glass and a smattering of foam pinpricks across the surface of the liquid. Lacing is essentially nonexistent. The body is a dark almost-black brown color that allows zero light to penetrate, and the liquid isn't terribly viscous, but has a slightly oily look to it.
Smell (4.25) - Here is where I first notice a difference between the 2013 and 2014 batches. While the 2013 was all bittersweet chocolate and barely a touch of the spice aroma that I love so much about this sub-style, the 2014 was a better balance of baker's chocolate and cinnamon, with a tiny bit of that dried pepper heat coming through as well. Maybe a touch of vanilla peeks through, but it's fleeting, almost not there at all.
Taste (4.25) - As with the aroma, the taste bears a pretty stark contrast between the 2013 and 2014, with the cinnamon and chocolate playing quite well together in the fresher version, with notes of semi-dark chocolate, fresh cinnamon stick, cocoa powder, roasted malt bitterness and a faint kiss of vanilla on the aftertaste. The year-old version is really lacking in the spice department, although both seem to bring the spice and heat out a bit more as the liquid begins to warm up to room temperature. The second glass I pour from my bomber is worlds different than the first.
Mouthfeel (4.0) - Medium-bodied and slightly chewy, but could use a bit more body. Reminds me more of Xocoveza than it does Abraxas in terms of body. Carbonation is moderate-to-low and the finish is bittersweet, with a bit of pepper warmth on the tastebuds.
Overall (4.25), a very good take on the sub-style, but not one that I'm likely to expend a great deal of effort to have again because it just doesn't quite get that spice overload that I personally enjoy. Chocolate and cinnamon are a great flavor marriage, because the chocolate sweetness tends to transform the cinnamon from being a dry, mildly interesting flavor to a rich, spice melange, sort of the way salt can amp up the flavors in so many foods. 2,729 charactersLambicPentameter, Feb 03, 2015

4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to Kevin and Matt for providing the bottle. '13 vintage.
Pours a completely black color, with a decent beige, stable head.
The aromas are all about cinnamon, earthy bakers chocolate and hints of slightly wooden vanilla, with roasted malts. Not particular sweet on the nose, but very intriguing, due to its wonderful complexity. 
Has a distinct, coffee infused malt foundation, joined by a load of slightly earthen cinnamon. Bakers chocolate adds to the humble wooden malts, getting topped of by toffee and syrup. The brew then turns into a sweeter, slightly sticky direction, due to molasses and a metallic, hot alcohol peak, intruduced by the lively carbonation. The brew is, despite its entwined, sublime cinnamon-chocolate sweetness, heavily hopped, creating a decent antithesis, forming its full body. It is pleasantly balanced, providing a smooth drinking, outstanding complexity. 
It finishes with burning hot, peppery chilies, acting as the perfect addition to the rich chocolate taste, challenging the tastebuds, as this beer is evolving in taste from the beginning till its very end. 1,103 charactersaleigator, Jan 25, 2015

I love how the pepper just hits the back of your palate as the smooth chocolate taste covers the top of your tongue.  I think this is the perfect beer, its just a shame that it is so difficult to get if you are not in distribution range. 288 charactersrubetube56, Jan 12, 2015

A - Pours pitch black with a nice, thick, toffee colored ring and no carbonation.
S - Chocolate, hot peppers, vanilla, cinnamon, and a touch of cream.
T - Follows the nose right to the last little nuance!  Cocoa, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and hot peppers from start to finish with a lingering cinnamon/chocolat sweetness with pepper burn underneath.
M - Full bodied, thick, slippery velvet, lingering burn, lip smacking sticky.
O - This beer is a must try. 506 charactersjzeilinger, Jan 11, 2015

I think it was the combo of cinnamon and habaneros, or maybe i had it at this weird in-between stage (bottled 5/14, drank basically 1/15) but i didnt love it like I thought I would.  The beer is gorgeous looking, even the smell was great, picked up a good bit of cocoa, but the taste....was sort of a mess. Ive been drinking a bunch of FBS, Backwoods, and BCBS lately, and this just didnt live up. 466 charactersMbo108, Dec 30, 2014

S: Cocoa, peanut butter, molasses and sweet malt.
T: Roasty malt up front - cocoa, coffee and roasted barley malt - with some vanilla. Finishes with a hint of cinnamon and the faintest touch of heat - presumably from the habanero peppers - fighting the vanilla and cocoa sweetness for dominance. Nicely balanced dessert beer.
M: Full-bodied, thick beer. Carbonation is modest, creating a slightly slick feel.

4.49/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5When I first tasted the DB version of Mexican Cake two months ago, it immediately took the crown as My Favorite Beer, a title it still holds. Now, months later, finally getting hold of a bottle of the regular version, sure, I was expecting there to be some separation between the two, but not THAT much. I've found a wider split than I had imagined.
Obviously I love this beer, as my score would indicate. But it wasn't even close to the Double Barrel. Two things may have hurt it:
1) it was bottled in May, and this is a beer (as the label states) to be consumed fresh. The spice notes just didn't pop like they had in the DB.
2) I had some fresh Abraxas and Vanilla Abraxas on tap just 24 hours beforehand. Abraxas and Mexican Cake are, essentially, the same beer, and the cinnamon and chocolate were clear and vibrant in the Abraxas, with real heat from the peppers, all of which outshone the Mexican Cake a day later.
This is an amazing beer, no doubt, but, for me, at least as of this round of bottles, Abraxas blew past it. Maybe the next round will make me flip my scores, we'll see. 1,094 charactersronricorossi, Dec 21, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -3.2%Pours rather thin, but dark black with a sliver of caramel foam.
Spice, spice, peppers, and more spice, some chocolate, and more pepper.
Sweet chocolate and cinnamon upfront with an immediate greeting from the habanero. The habanero sticks the length of the swallow and hangs around a bit after. Not to keen on the spicy aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is sweet and sticky on the front end and finishes spicy and dry.
Overall, I can see why people enjoy this; however, pepper in beer is just not for me. 497 characterslarryarms847, Dec 14, 2014

On the other hand, I appreciate its lighter body in some ways, and I also appreciate a somewhat stronger, or at least more lingering, spicy finish, but I'm also one who prefers their spicy stouts good and spicy. Not surprised it's behind the other two aforemtioned brews in the ratings, as I think most would prefer their richer bodies, but don't sleep on this one -- it's a good'un. 456 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 08, 2014

You get the initial rush of cinnamon on the nose followed by sweet cocoa.  The pour is thin with very little head.  The habanero finish is fantastic improves as the beer warms. This is one of the best blended beers.   The heat is pleasant but not overpowering.  It is one of the few beers that I have traded for even having a few bottles in the cellar. 371 characterstiamat8086, Nov 16, 2014

I've got to admire a beer that looks like this. Frothy, thick and creamy head a couple fingers thick that sits majestically like a ring of clouds over a mountain. The dark khaki color provides a perfect contrast to the pitch black liquid that when poured into the glass flowed thick as oil. Magnificent. 5
Cocoa dominates the nose initially, but a faint medley of cinnamon, vanilla and chile provide an intriguing backdrop. Dark roast malts round out the aroma and provide a deeper flavor. It's pleasant but also seems to either faded or restrained. 4
A few sips tell me the palate on this is much less restrained. First off, the chile flavor figures much more prominently here, offering a piquant bite. Chocolate and vanilla interplay around the chile suggesting a spicy Mexican hot chocolate. Baker's chocolate lingers on the finish and gives me a good reason to space out my sips and enjoy this. As I do, the beer warms up and becomes even more great. Caramel pushes to the forefront and adds to the mix of flavors that make this live up to its name. 4.5
The beer is still a tad hot, but otherwise it's as creamy and rich as any beer you can find. The taste and feel are very similar to so many of the big stouts from Evil Twin and it's clear the influence/collaboration works it's way into beers that they brew individually. There's a obvious bite to this, obviously from the chile but also from the hops. The hops also give a bit of bitterness at the finish. 4.25
2 summers back I visited Torst and this beer blew my mind on tap. I've been dreaming of it ever since. It doesn't disappoint. Delicious. 1,624 charactersONovoMexicano, Nov 11, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -3.2%Pours a mud brown color, with a finger of brown, creamy foam that retains well, stream of bubbles visible in the beer. Aroma is rich, consisting of coffee, mild chocolate and the peppers are there. The flavor consists of coffee, hints of dark chocolate, cinnamon and vanilla smooth the bitterness from the chocolate and coffee and then the chili hits you like a ton of bricks. The 10.5 ABV is completely undetectable.
While the chili was a bit much for my taste the beer is complex and very, very tasty. a very unique and very positive beer experience. 552 charactersSteveB24, Oct 20, 2014

A:  The blackest of blacks.  Not much head.  Limited lacing.  Like oil in a glass.  Viscous.
S:  Cocoa and vanilla come on strong.  Very slight habanero.
T:  A beast of a beer.  Dark chocolate, cocoa nibs and vanilla start out, with a habenero heat on  the finish that doesn't overwhelm.  This one's a sipper.  Gets better and better as it warms.
M:  Light to medium with medium carbonation.
O:  A great one to share with friends.  Sip slowly and be overwhelmed.  One of the top 5 beers I've had this year.  Magnificent. 580 charactersbrewskifan55, Oct 13, 2014

Appeared a dark brown color with minimal head.
Smelled amazing - cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate and slight alcohol on the nose.
Taste was awesome as well.  Love the cinnamon presence - tastes a bit like Huna.
Mouthfeel was a bit light but the peppers elevated it with some heat on the back of the throat.
Overall a delicious treat and one I hope to have again. 385 charactersTWStandley, Sep 20, 2014

Good, drinkable mouthfeel with a nice blend of cocoa, vanilla and peppers.  The peppers started present and then flexed their muscles as it warmed.  I recommend sharing the bottle (as I did) or having some Pepto available. 326 charactersBeer4B, Sep 04, 2014

A: Pitch-black pour with a tall and dense dark brown head. Great legs and top-notch head retention. Substantial and thick lacing. Great appearance. 
S: Immediate heavy roasted malt. Sort of a chalky, roasty, earthy aroma with lots of chocolate. I think the cinnamon and/or habaneros contribute as well. Sort of a sweet pepper aroma too. Hard to describe properly. It smells heavy though.
T: Now we're talking. Immediate chili peppers and heat mixed with lots of bittersweet chocolate up front. A little vanilla, primarily right at the beginning. Again, quite chalky and grainy. I think it's from the cinnamon sticks. Lots of cinnamon and chili pepper throughout. A brief hit of pepper heat in the finish to go with some chocolate fudge and vanilla that lingers forever. That chalky, spicy and almost waxy at times, mouthfeel never really seems to fade. Like a dash of cinnamon left over in your mouth. 
M: Heavy, thick, lower carbonation. Just the right amount of sweetness. Fairly chalky and practically grainy at points (an illusion, I realize).
O: One hell of a beer. It's pretty much as it's described. A proper stoneground mexican chocolate tends to be grainy, bittersweet and oftentimes has some sort of cinnamon and/or chili pepper spice. This is liquid mexican chocolate. Great flavors and balance, great complexity, great strength. Just works nicely. Barrel aging this would probably put it over the top but this is great as-is. 1,505 charactersDope, Sep 01, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +5.9%Had on tap at the Liberty Taphouse in Columbia, SC on Friday. Small snifter arrived at the table, black body, light tan head. For some reason, this beer was not on my wish list for the weekend, but Oh my am I glad I found it. 
From the first mouthful I was hooked, a delicious sweet chocolately wash comes over the tongue, and by the time I let it get to the back of the mouth, there was the slight burn from the pepper and roasted malts. Some vanilla and dried fruit tones on the tongue. Over the 30-40 minutes I took getting through this one, the heat gradually grew in the back of the mouth, while the to tongue kept the sweet tones of milk & chocolate. Damn fine beer indeed. 680 charactersMikeWard, Aug 25, 2014

Purchased: Single from Liquor Express, Huntsville AL
A: Black and opaque beer showing a tall dark tan head.  The lacing and retention are both good.
S: Fantastic smells of chocolate, sweet malts, coffee and a hint of spicy peppers.
T: Wow, the taste is an incredible mix of chocolate and habanero peppers, plus roasted malts typical to a stout.  The pepper is just right and does not overpower.  I also get warmth from both the alcohol and the peppers.
M: Low in carbonation, with a full body.  The finish is bittersweet with a good dose of hot peppers.
O: An excellent mixture of the sweet and hot elements; highly recommended! 748 characterssommersb, Aug 21, 2014

Black with a thick brown head that sticks around nicely and leaves some lace. 
Nose is a little lacking compared to the flavor. Could be glasses. A little sweet cinnamon and chocolatey. Pepper skin.
Robust flavor full of chile/heat, roasty coffee, cinnamon, chocolate and a touch of sweetness buried behind the omnipresent chile.
Smooth and creamy. 
So many of these beers now it seems. The local Dallas take on this, Mole Temptress, is just as good to me. 488 charactersMattSweatshirt, Aug 10, 2014

A- Dark black with thin tan head. No light passing through this stout!
S- Coco and vanilla with roasted malt
T- I get the coco nibs followed by the sweet vanilla. No cinnaman or peppers. The peppers come in on heat on the back end. A pleasent heat. I was worried I wouldn't dig the use of peppers, but they did awesome with it.
M- Smooth and creamy... great!
O- Very enjoyable "mayan stout". The coco nibs give it a bit of grittiness. The vanilla works really well. The pepper played the perfect role. Boom! Delicious. 580 charactersPBRmeasap1980, Aug 03, 2014

Bottle to Westbrook Snulip
22oz
Bottled 5/28/14
Thanks to Ryan for this one
App- This was a very black and dark and thick stout from the word pour. A bit like chocolate coming out of a double boiler. Just darker. A nice one finger head that was dark tan and bordered on brown hug out for a while and left some scattered cling. 
Smell- On a big whiff, I mostly get the cocoa and the cinnamon. Very heavy on the spice aroma. Either being from cinnamon and additives to the peppers. The heat doesnt sting but does let you know its there. A bit of creamy chocolate comes to the party once it warms up a bit.
Taste- This is all over the place for me, I get sweet, savory, spice, heat. On a first sip its a bit of that fresh double boiler chocolate and moves to the spice of the habaneros. The warming brings the cinnamon and a bit of the vanilla. I would love a bit more vanilla on this one to balance. I am sure the BA version would amp this one for sure. I enjoy the heat. Its still a stout, but comes with a kick to say the least.
Mouth- A big medium body with a almost creamy feel to it. As I sip on this one, the carbonation smooths out and is a little less prickly and moves to a creaminess to it. The residual flavors are cinnamon and heat. A little chocolate comes through.
Drink- I am really digging this one. I was surprised to even land a bottle. Never thought I would tick it! I would love to try the BA versions I am sure they are devine. 1,472 charactersFosterJM, Jul 29, 2014

A- pours a thick & oily pitch black color with a small creamy dark tan head that reduces to a ring around the glass, short lasting lace left behind
S- the base stout consists of some smoky/charred malt with sweet dark chocolate. As it warms, some of the spices come out; cinnamon & nutmeg, cocoa powder, burnt brown sugar, coffee, a hint of vanilla and a slight singe of habanero
T- sweet and chocolaty cocoa up front that actually tastes very similar to chocolate icing, perhaps enhanced by the addition of the vanilla. Mid-palate, the cinnamon kicks in, which seems to also enhance the chocolate flavor, giving it a very fudge-like flavor. The heat of the habanero can be felt throughout, but it doesn't overpower the other spices.
M- heavy and thick body with moderate carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel with a creamy smooth finish, lingering habanero burn lasts on the throat long after drinking 
O- this had much more heat than expected, especially on the linger. It worked well with the other flavors though. Really liked the chocolaty fudge icing flavor as well. Compared to Hunaphu, this one is hotter and more chocolaty, Hunaphu has more emphasis on the other spices. Slight edge in flavor to Hunaphu, but overall this was a unique beer that I really enjoyed 1,318 charactersTreyliff, Jul 28, 2014

Appearance- One of the best looking beers I have ever seen. A vigorous pour results in a 3/4 inch SUPER creamy cardboard brown head. Lacing seems to be spectacular right out of the fridge. 
Smell- I get roasted malt right away. I would argue cinnamon is the next scent followed by vanilla, hot peppers and chocolate. This is quite a unique smelling beer. 
Taste- Wow, chocolate and coconut almost knock me out in a fantastic kind of way. I also get smooth creamy vanilla and the heat from the peppers. Cinnamon is taking a backseat in the flavor for sure. 
Mouthfeel- Just about as close to perfect as a beer can get. Super creamy vanilla makes you think this is a milk stout, then BAM, hot peppers. Makes your throat tingle long after you swallow and I LOVE it. 
Overall- Such a great beer! I am usually a barrel-aged snob, but this beer is perfect how it is. I cannot even imagine trying the apple brandy version, I just might die. 1,011 charactersfrenchblood21, Jul 23, 2014

A: pitch reddish black body, dark chocolate foam head that fades out quickly
S: heavy chocolate aroma, wiffs of sweet vanilla and cinnamon, some booziness add it warms. 
M: medium heavy body with a thin syrup feel on the tongue
T: coca nibs, espresso, vanilla bean, cinnamon, slight sweetness leads you to think cake batter along with the vanilla, very silky smooth, heat and flavor from the habaneros come through closer to the finish with lots of pepper flavor and some heat, not over powering, some booziness as it warms up but hey it's 10.5% abv.

Aroma is chocolate malts, a little bit of roasty coffee, some caramel and brown sugar, and just a hint of capsaicin spiciness that I probably wouldn't notice if I didn't know it was there. Not a big or strong aroma, but what's there does smell nice.
Tastes starts out with semi-dark chocolate and a hint of smokiness, along with some nice roasty character that's not too charred. Then the pepper comes in mid-palate, and kind of sneaks up on you - it doesn't taste super spicy at first, but gets spicier as you let it rest in your mouth, and becomes the dominant note, mixing really well with the chocolate and smoke. The aftertaste is weirdly thick, and tastes like chocolate cake with peppers enjoyed next to a campfire. The peppers leave a little bit of a lingering heat in your mouth. The heat and the little bit of roasty bitterness work perfectly against the chocolate to keep this from being too sweet or cloying on the finish.
Mouthfeel is nice and thick, almost syrupy, with a just a little bit of actual carbonation, but the heat makes it seem like more carbonation than it actually is.
Overall, this is definitely my favorite of the handful of chili-pepper stouts I've had - it has the exactly perfect amount of roast, smoke, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness, and they all compliment each other really well. Really, really great. 1,592 charactersMasterfulIdiot, Jul 20, 2014

Black with a short tan head that drops to a super creamy ring and wispy surface covering. Attractive webby lacing coats the glass. Aromas of cinnamon, dark fruits, light chili pepper, vanilla bean, a black malt edge, and some dark, crumbly chocolate that lends a certain “cakiness” to the whole thing. I’m fairly sensitive to cinnamon in beer and Westbrook pulls off the spice addition admirably, keeping it just prominent enough to blend with the pepper and chocolate. Big, malty flavor with a spicy twist: cocoa, subtle vanilla, cinnamon, increasing milk chocolate as it warms, and a mild, late peppery heat that lingers just a bit. Body is medium-full, super creamy, and slick without any alcohol whatsoever.
I was much more impressed with this second Mexican Cake experience. Last year I didn’t quite get the hype for whatever reason, but this is an excellent stout that takes all of the adjunct elements and melds them together beautifully to create a big and malty – yet surprisingly easy drinking – imperial stout. 1,057 characterswedge, Jul 18, 2014

Pours a very dark black, with a small half inch head that descends down into an oily film, with a little bit of lacing.
Smells like dark roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon, and vegetal pepper.
Luckily the pepper flavor is less vegetal than the pepper aroma. This is beer gets a lot better as it warms up, but unfortunately, doesn't seem to compare to the other big 3 "Mexican-style" stouts- Bomb, Huna, and Abraxas. The roasted malt is much more up-front than I expected, with some decent bitterness. A lot less sweet than I figured- fairly bitter, especially with the bitter dark chocolate flavors as well. There's a bit of cinnamon, but not overwhelming, with basically no vanilla flavor. The habanero flavor builds up slowly, but isn't overpowering. Your lips do tingle once you're done with your glass. I like how Mexican Cake differs itself from other beers of the style- it's much less sweet and more bitter than its counterparts, and it tastes great, but it seems to lack the magic that the others have.
Medium bodied, could be a little thicker, I suppose. Creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, even with the hot pepper flavors.
This one was pretty good, but not up to the level of the other big stouts in this category. 1,262 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jul 17, 2014

A: Pitch black with a thin cap of tan foam that settles into a ring and leaves spotty lace. Pretty solid.
S: Intense chilis, dark chocolate, and that's about it. Very straightforward and enjoyable, but not particularly complex.
T: Follows the nose. Rich, decadent dark chocolate fudginess ahead of pure pepper heat. The spiciness is dialed in nicely, as it's prominent without being overbearing. The chocolate and chili go great together.
M: Moderately thick and creamy. Quite nice.
O: Excellent beer, but I'm not sure it's worth the hype. I liked it about as much as Bomb, but significantly less than Abraxas and Hunahpu's. Great brews all, but I won't be trading for this one. I can definitely see how it could do well in a barrel, though…

A: Pours pitch black with a finger of thick head that begins the color of burnt sienna but eventually turns tan as it recedes into a light blanket at the meniscus.
S: Vanilla, cinnamon, bakers chocolate, some nutmeg, charred malts. Pepper notes are present towards the tail end, and only after a hefty whiff. 
T: Wow, fantastic! Smooth cinnamon hits first, followed by creamy vanilla, then the bite of the dark chocolate, and some nutmeggy flavors to round everything out. I can't really taste the pepper, but I can feel it upon swallowing, and it lingers in the throat. This one is super complex and very, very delicious.
M: Medium carbonation, and on the lighter-side-of-medium in terms of body, which suits the flavor profile of this beer perfectly, allowing the sweeter notes to dominate up front and the spiciness of the peppers to establish themselves in the finish. The mouthfeel is where I feel this one really shines, and while many would disagree with me, the lighter, but still-full-bodied mouthfeel is what makes Mexican Cake, for me, stand a pedestal higher than Huna.
O: This one is worth the hype and worth seeking out. This is my first Westbrook beer, and has established them as a brewery I will seek more offerings from... this is a total knockout! 1,318 charactersHalfbrother83, Jul 12, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look: Poured pitch black with a 1 cm head, light tan, almost greyish in appearance. Appropriately, its coloration reminded of the Mexican drink horchata, which, like this brew, is made with cinnamon. It quickly receded to thin, tan lacing around the edges. The lacing got a little darker as the beer sat. This is not the typical light-brown head on an imperial stout. However, the greyish-color goes well with the cinnamon and vanilla flavors in the beer.
Smell: Dominated by cinnamon, with some hops, a little chocolate, some vanilla, and then the habanero peppers in the background. The chocolate aroma became much stronger towards the end, when the beer had warmed up a good bit.
Taste: The first thing that hits the palate is a heavy dose of cinnamon, followed by some vanilla and chocolate, a little coffee, and then ending with a strong aftertaste of peppers. As the beer warmed up, the vanilla taste grew somewhat stronger, with the chocolate and coffee receding. Towards the end, the chocolate became much stronger. The cinnamon taste is predominant for most of the beer, but towards the very end, the peppers assert themselves and are of similar potency, blending brilliantly into the vanilla and chocolate. The spiciness wonderfully complements the hoppiness of the imperial stout, blending together into an explosive, delicious flavor.
Mouthfeel: Decent carbonation, and a huge, explosive surge of spiciness that makes it very thick and intense, but easy enough to drink anyway. It has a sort of heat to it that goes very well with a high ABV, heavily-hopped beer like an imperial stout.
Overall: This is an absolutely spectacular beer, perhaps the best imperial stout I've ever drank, up there with Oskar Blues's Ten FIDY or Great Divide's Yeti. It really does taste like you're drinking some sort of spicy cake. Also, I am not a fan of spicy food, but I loved this beer, so anyone who likewise prefers mild food should not be turned away simply by the habanero peppers. Great Divide's Chocolate Oak-Aged Yeti is somewhat similar, but this is far spicier and more explosive. I would highly, highly recommend this to anyone. 2,139 charactersDanielMB, Jul 08, 2014

S: Lots of cinnamon which carries the habanero peppers well. Smells like a boozy chocolate cake. More sweet vanilla bean as it warms. Some dark fruits as well, probably because of the peppers. On they're on each is great, but they blend very nicely too.
M: Velvety smooth, thick, full body. A little 'thin' if you don't let it sit for just a sec at which point it fills out. 
T: I think they named this one perfectly. Sweet chocolately and roasty malt layers with some vanilla frosting dusted with cinnamon. Some rising heat, but nothing overdone-almost perfect in how much habanero flavor you get. Some nice bitterness at the end contributed to by the cocoa nibs along with their mouth-cooling properties. Sweet and savory finish, very rich and decadent. 
O: This makes me feel like the fat kid in Matilda who had to eat the whole chocolate cake. I drank this whole btl with pleasure. 1,020 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Jul 08, 2014

Amazing color; nose and most of all taste and finish.  Getting right to it, the flavors and amazingly apparent individually and yet the integration and balance is among the best I've ever tasted.

A - Dark as night with actually a solid two to three finger mocha foam head. Some decent lacing on this one. Looks decently thick and viscous
S - Smell is of mostly cinnamon and pepper heat which dominate the front of the nose but as you let this one air out and warm up, the chocolate and vanilla subtities start coming through. Smells really nice, on par with Abraxas & Hunahpu etc
T - This is where this steps a bit ahead of reg Abraxas. First of all, I am a pepper and spice nut, and this delivers on all aspects. The front of the tongue is all cinnamon chocolate with very subtle hints of Vanilla, while the back end is dominated by the nice fruity profile that Habanero's have. If you have ever eaten one, they are sweet but very very hot. This is 10x the heat of Abraxas and I love it.
M - Mouthfeel is almost full bodied with a chewy smooth velvety mouthfeel. It's not as thick as some other beers, but it's nice in it's own regard. 
O - I drank the whole bottle in one sitting. Something about that combo paired with the heat of the finish makes it an addicting beer to drink. Will seek out more to compare side by side with my JD Cake :)
Oh, and I liked this better than bomb! hunahpu, and Abraxas for sure. 1,322 charactersdrmcleod10, Jul 02, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a black color with a large rich coffee brown head.
The aroma has big robust imperial stout with thick roasted malt, rich roasted coffee and dark chocolate, even some cacao nib. Then there's an underlying aroma of cinnamon, vanilla, and general spicy pepper. Nothing too intense like capsaicin or fresh jalapeno.
The flavor is just uncalled for excitement, integration of flavor, and restraint. In the front, there's a roasted malt and coffee, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. There's immediately a rush and explosion of bright pepper flavor. A medium plus spiciness and not too intense, but surely surprising.
The beer follows with a dance of cinnamon and the spice. Then onto vanilla on the back with a drying of roasted malt and coffee, lingering spice, and smooth chocolate.
This is easily one of my favorite beers ever and beats the other spicy stouts like Huna, Bomb!, and Abraxas. 916 charactersdar482, Jul 02, 2014

4.31/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Huge doses of raw pungent vanilla beans like with Hypnopompa. Anise-like herbal/medicinal notes closely follow, intermingled with hints of fudge, powdery cinnamon, and something that reminds me of spearmint. The habanero pepper is unfortunately not too dominant on the nose; when you cook with habanero peppers, there's a distinct smell that the skin/peel lets out when you separate it from the seeds in the middle -- that's pretty much the only pepper-like sensation registering in the aroma department. Sweet brandy / rum like booze-y notes surface once the brew is given time to warm up.
The vanilla and the fudge dominate early on with the initial sensation on the tongue being a mix between sweet and somewhat pungent; spicy medicinal notes resembling anise, and probably the habanero quickly follow, relegating the pleasant sweetness to a short-lived memory. A cake-batter like mellow spongy sensation briefly surfaces before being ousted by an almost harsh bitterness that tastes like the dregs at the bottom of a cup of horchata from your favorite tacqueria. (translation: lots and lots of cinnamon)
Thick chewy initial mouthfeel. Full-bodied with minimal carbonation; there's a noticeable burn that starts and remains just beyond the threshold of the throat, a sensation that I last experienced when I tried to stomach the Four Horsemen Burger at Chunky's Burgers in San Antonio. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
I'm still not completely convinced that habanero peppers are an ingredient that should be considered for brewing beer, but they definitely play nicer with stouts than they do with IPAs. The vanilla and the cinnamon perhaps clashed too much and distracted the palate away from the other rich flavors at play. 1,742 charactersamano_h, Jun 29, 2014

A - pours nice, dark, seemed a bit thin
S - a bit of roastiness, very little pepper, hint of chocolate 
T - Meh, not much chocolate or pepper. No way they use habanero peppers
M - much thinner than you would expect. Nothing compared to Huna, Abraxas or Bomb!
O - just ok, definitely way better Chili Stouts out there. Not worth the price of admission. What a let down 512 charactersHoppyBastard1, Jun 29, 2014

4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25As good as advertised. Had this on-tap at Barley's in Greenville. Pours black as pitch with a coffee and cream head. Lovely aromas of chiles, vanilla and cinnamon with some roasty notes in the background. Really excellent taste- enough spice to heat things up and give you a constant tingle, but not enough to hit you over the head and make things unpleasant (like Stone's Crime and Punishment). Also, since the heat comes from habaneros , you get a nice fruitiness from the peppers that blends well with the cinammon, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate notes. Really nice. Not as deeply flavored as Huanapu, nor as much body, but there is a silkiness in the finish that's nice. Very well done. 690 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jun 28, 2014

M-Heavier, tad creamy, the heat from the peppers are there.

A: Pours black with a creamy, soft, and short lived mocha colored head that faded into a soft film. Some spotty lace was left down the glass.
S: Mild chipotle and habanero peppers, rich chocolate fudge and slight cinnamon, with some slight molasses sweetness. Sticky and thick smelling, but not as rich as expected.
T: Chocolate is there all the way through with notes of spicy Mexican chocolate and also rich fudge. I get some light molasses or candied brown sugar sweetness, with a creamy chocolate ice cream finish. Finish is also slightly roasted, with touch of caramel. The heat is mild, and it tingles in the finish and aftertaste. Definitively a clean habanero burn, not as roasted as the nose. Aftertaste lingers long after the swallow.
M: Medium-full body, but I was expecting slightly thicker. Soft low carbonation, slick and smooth mouthfeel.
O: Good, but not as good as I was expecting. I wish it was fuller. Thanks again Rusel_G. 1,011 charactersscottfrie, Jun 22, 2014

4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bomber into my favorite Jester King tulip. 
A: Pours a deep black with a hint of caramel colored lacing. 
S: The initial smell reminds me of a gourmet doughnut shop. The vanilla and cinnamon really make a strong impression. The chocolate also comes through, though not as strongly to me as the first two. There is a hint of pepper also, but not nearly as strong as the glorious doughnut shop smell (Yes, I love doughnuts)
T: At first the taste follows the bakery smell, with a wonderful mix of chocolate, cinnamon and hints of vanilla. Just as you wrap your arms (and mouth) around the sweet start, the peppers kick in. Of the few beers I've had made with peppers, Mexican Cake definitely brings the strongest heat punch, but its not overpowering. 
M: The mouthfeel is relatively smooth but dominated by the peppers when you let it linger in the mouth. As the beer warms the peppers really start to bring the heat. Don't let it linger on your throat too long, you'll feel it. 
O: A fantastic beer. I recently enjoyed my first Prairie Artisan/Evil Twin "Bible Belt" and was interested to compare the two. Mexican Cake both brings more pepper heat, and also has a sweeter side. Both beers are great, but I'm really loving this one. 1,248 charactersTargaFlorio, Jun 10, 2014

Appearance: Midnight black body with a lighter brown/mocha head. Very creamy looking and kind of frothy. Nice lacing as I drink it. 
Smell: I'm mainly picking up cinnamon and vanilla, and damn this smells good. Very aromatic beer. Some boozy, malty cocoa notes on the back end. I'm not sure if I'm confusing the strong booze notes with habaneros. 
Taste: Slight cinnamon and more semi sweet chocolate notes. Slightest vanilla and sweet malts. Heat starts mid taste and gradually builds, but rescinds in a nice way after a few seconds. Almost like a palate cleanser (like eating a fresh, raw hot pepper). Wow. Heat kind of gets more intense as this beer has opened up after an hour. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied. The booziness and heat is kind of a chore to drink in Jawja summer heat, but someone has to drink this bomber. 
Overall: I think this beer is fantastic on its own, and with the prominence of habaneros, I don't see the point of barrel aging it in bourbon or whatever barrels (though I'd be interested to see what red wine would do). Regardless, I think this is a fantastic beer and I'm happy I got to try it. 1,163 charactersMagicJeff, Jun 09, 2014

T- Awesome chocolate, vanilla and spice mix. Perfectly balanced. 
M- Pretty smooth, nice spice bite around the mouth and back of throat. Creamy, smooth.

A: Pours midnight black with a slight reddish brown tint. No light passing through this one. Generous 2-3 finger mocha chocolate colored head that seemed to hang around quite a while. Some spotty lacing.
S: Chili peppers, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and a bit of vanilla.
T: Like the name suggests, this reminds me quite a bit of a spicy chocolate cake. Big bittersweet chocolate flavors with a lingering chili heat. 
M: Very full body coating the tongue nicely. Refreshing creamy texture. 
O: Fantastic stout. I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this one since the spices can easily take away from the rest of the experience, but this is a world class spicy stout. 735 charactersrichj1970, Jun 04, 2014

Very thick, almost syrup like consistency. Decent head retention. Smell is very roasted, with dark chocolate and vanilla notes. Slight coffee and cherry notes as well. Taste is very rich, chocolate, sweet that fades to a biter finish with a lasting tingle from the habaneros. Mouthfeel is very thick and smooth, low carbonation. 
Would definitely drink this beer again given the chance, however I think that's unlikely considering how lucky I was to get a single bottle. 587 charactersscvance, Jun 03, 2014

A: Pours incredible dark, almost black, with a highly viscous appearance.
S: Lots of chocolate on the nose, some roast, and overall rich maltiness. Chili pepper is very faint and you could easily miss it.
T: Incredibly rich in chocolate malt with a bit of roastiness and a strong chili heat in the finish. Peppers are not dominant in the flavor itself, but really stand out in the finish.
M: This is where the chili peppers really pop. The beer is rich, slightly creamy, and smooth, and then you get the tingly heat all over your mouth and down your throat from the peppers.
O: Fantastic! Probably the best chili beer I have ever had; perfect balance between malt and heat and is not dominated by either. 750 charactersDan_Inreallife, Jun 02, 2014

4.41/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bomber poured selfishly into a Duvel tulip style glass. Liquid comes out the color of dark french roast coffee, but fudgier looking because it looks thick coming out of the bottle. As it rises in the glass it's completely opaque covering the glass, no highlights. Tan head, small bubbles, frothy looking with better than average lacing. 
Smells good. Has aromas of sweet after dinner chocolate fudgeiness that's prominent. Some slight hints of a vanilla flavored dark roasted coffee as well, more coffee than vanilla though, almost like an espresso. Dark sweet bread aromas come out with almost like a sweet chili undertone that tickles your nose, like a chili based jam. 
 Wow does this beer taste great. Everything above is expanded upon. In addition to the sweet chocolate fudge there are also bitter-sweet chocolate tones, like a bittersweet coco powder. Burned almost charred caramel and a nice bready sweetness again. Vanilla is much stronger in the flavor than aroma and it's very pleasant. Slight hop flavor detected, but masked from the habaneros which aren't really very flavorful, but provide that sweet heat. Really unique great tasting beer with a lot going on.
Mouthfeel has a lot going on too. In fact my wife actually tried it and said the same thing "boy that has a lot going on." Full bodied with a nice lingering flavor. Moderate carbonation level that is smooth with a nice dry, earthy, bitter and slightly hot finish. The heat from the habenaros almost provide a bourbon barrel like heat, but not quite. Crazy drinkablility, I expected to be sipping on this all night, but I'm about 2/3's of the way through and haven't even started dinner yet. I know I should have shared this, but it really can be consumed by one's self if they are a beer/stout lover. Love to try this one again, great beer. Thanks Paschal for an awesome trade, you're the man!! 1,878 charactersAndyAvalanche, May 22, 2014

Smell: Vanilla, dark fruit, roasted malt, dark chocolate. There is definitely an underlying aroma of the habanero...I wonder if I would have been able to sniff it out blind? 
Taste: Begins with dark chocolate, followed by a splash of vanilla and then as the aforementioned subside, you're left with some roast. Soon after the roast creeps in, the habaneros rear their heads, making themselves present with a bit of a burn in the back of the throat, under everything that had established itself beforehand. If you don't like hot wings, peppers and the like, I could see the burn at the end being off-putting, but it's right up my alley...I actually offered a sip to my gf just to see her cringe, but unfortunately, she declined.
Mouthfeel: Pretty velvety and smooth. The viscosity is nowhere near BCBS/Hunahpu. I feel like any less body and people would complain that it's thin, but it's just thick enough to enjoy and be able to down a whole bomber without it becoming fatiguing. 
Overall: A solid beer that I'm glad I got to try...I definitely need to get a fresh one the next time around. I've heard people say that the peppers drop out with age, and this bottle is almost a year old, but there is definite heat at the end that doesn't go unnoticed. 1,419 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Apr 20, 2014

4.16/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from Stystembolaget, Sweden. Bottled july 3 - 2013. 
Pitch black beer with a brownbeige head that´s almoust two finger high. 
The head dissolves without leaving any lacing on the glass and no sign of the head after about ten minutes. 
Nose: Milk chocolate, coffee beans, cacao, dark bread, spices, black pepper, oak and roasted malt.
Taste: Espresso, dark chocolate, dark fruit, roasted malt, soy sause and at the end the habanero pepper kicks in! 
Mouth: Full body with a creamy, soft taste. A great full complex taste with a dry, sour ending that suddenly changes into a warming, no, almoust burning sense in the back of your mouth of the habanero pepper. 
The 10.5 % ABV is well hidden. You can´t really tell when you have the habanero tickling in your mouth... 
This is so good! 
I´m glad I bought more bottles that goes directly to my beercellar :) 867 characterscraftbeersweden, Mar 13, 2014

First sips are great, but the spice takes over and masks flavor for me after a while, for me a huge minus. 273 characterssimont1, Mar 09, 2014

Aged in the beer fridge for a year.
Oily, thick pour with 1 finger of dark cream head. Decent lace on a tulip and a thin sheen of retention.
Nose is just wonderful. Chocolate, a bit of dark fruit, coffee/toffee touch, and then light pepper. Even after a year.
The pepper mutes out after a year, but that is not a bad thing. Becomes more complimentary. Lots of chocolate/toffee up front with a dose of dark coffee. Then the pepper kicks in, ever so respectful of the remaining tastes. This is really well done.
Feel is just about right. Not nearly as thick as expected.
Overall, a homerun. 638 charactersbeer2day, Feb 13, 2014
3.63/5  rDev -17.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pour is motor oil with tight mocha head. Nose is light chocolate fudge and vanilla, roasted malt, and faint soy sauce and spice. Taste has a ton of spice to it, a bit richer in a good way. Some fudge notes, light vanilla. Some roasted malts mid palate with the spice taking over in the back and lingering on a long finish. Full body, thins in back, smooth and creamy feel. The beer is decent but it's super spicy so it's hard to really drink, not sure how much I can handle. 474 characterscpetrone84, Feb 12, 2014

Served chilled in a snifter. 
Bottled: 07/03/2013
Appearance: The beer appears pitch black in the glass, with a back light showing fairly thick strips of deep red along the edge of the glass. A rough pour results in a large dark tan coloured head that lasts pretty well, but doesn’t leave anything in the way of lacing. Swirling the beer leaves light yellow tinted alcohol legs clinging to the glass. 
Smell: While this still smells fantastic, there is certainly a big chunk missing when compared to the barrel aged (JD) version. The nose is a lot less sweet than I was expecting with a large roasted malt character as well as a fair amount of bitter cocoa dominating the first few sniffs. After a few minutes a solid habanero character emerges alongside brown sugar, toasty notes, a touch of cinnamon, chocolate and more roast. 
Taste: The flavor is quite bitter with a lot of roasted malt, dark chocolate and cocoa present alongside a fantastic habanero flavor and a nice warming in the finish. Other notes include: An underlying sweetness, a little dark fruitiness, an odd yeasty note and the faintest hint of cinnamon. 
Mouthfeel: The body doesn’t seem to have the heft that the BA version did (medium bodied with a touch of stickiness) and is a little over carbonated (medium-high level). 
Overall: Mexican Cake is a solid spiced stout, but just a million miles away from the perfection that is the JD BA version. I think Westbrook shouldn’t bottle the regular version and simply stick it all in JD barrels! 1,548 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 28, 2014

On it are two revolvers, two skulls, a piece of cake, and chilies. They really want you know what they put in this beer because they mentioned it twice. Once on the front under the brewery's name and on the side. Also on the side is a bottled on date. My bottle was bottled on 5/15/13 and drank on 10/4/2013. A little late for my notes. The label is something you need to see for yourself to appreciate. 
When poured into a 7venth Sun Snifter, this cake was a super rich Death by Chocolate black with a nice mocha colored icing on top. My chocolate loving eyes couldn't stop staring at the thick viscous black liquid in my glass. This mocha colored foam was about 1/4 of inch in height. This decent sized head of foam had solid retention that left behind a large string of foamy rings and more than a few sticky spots and tiny streaks of lace. 
The aroma on this beer was certainly unique. I'll certainly give Westbrook that. The initial whiff of this beer was that of cooked vegetables. Why and how that got in there, I have no idea. Once that receded, the aroma kicked into full gear. The first portion of the 2nd part of the aroma was all about the roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, and chocolate covered dark chocolate brownies. The final portion of the aroma was the spices. There I found the vanilla, cinnamon stick, and habanero pepper. There was plenty of pepper in the beginning, but once the beer warmed up, it was the vanilla that reigned supreme over the spices portion of the aroma. My nose had no complaints except for the cooked vegetables, but that was minor and beer made up for that. 
Fortunately the beer didn't have a cooked vegetable taste in the beer. That was isolated only to the aroma. This beer drank like a roasted slice of Death by Chocolate cake with a pepper on top instead of a cherry. The taste kicked off with the roasted malt, roasted coffee beans, a speck of black cherry, and dark chocolate. Not bitter dark chocolate like almost every other Imperial Stout. This was thick and creamy dark chocolate. It was almost fudge like dark chocolate. Once the chocolate passes, it's the spices time to shine. I found cinnamon, vanilla, and pepper. It tasted like the cinnamon and pepper combined forces. I only got a pinch of vanilla before the combined team of cinnamon and pepper washed in. The pepper finish was a nice touch to all the dark chocolate in the beginning. 
This Imperial Stout was dry, thick, chewy, roasted, and spicy. The aftertaste was chocolatey with more roasted malt, a dash of roasted coffee, a tiny speck of vanilla, and plenty of spicy peppers. Like a good chocolate cake, the chocolate flavor stuck to the roof of my mouth. The pepper decided to stick around as well. That hung around in the back of my throat where it doesn't belong. It wasn't until half way through when the 10%+ ABV started to kick in. 
This beer backs up the cool name and the kick ass label. This beer stayed true to the cake part of the name. It was just as thick and chocolatey as a well made slice of chocolate cake. The pepper at the finish line was a very nice touch. Would I drink it again? I sure would! I would also very much like to try a barrel aged version of this. Thanks to mnbuffalo for hooking me up with this treat. 3,316 charactersAltBock, Dec 29, 2013

A bit thin not creamy. Smell is nice. Color is dark like any stout. No real lacing or head. Slight chocolate taste but not a dark, dry chocolate. More like a slight cake frosting which hence the name makes sense. Just about no carbonation. A slight smokey flavor early on the front of the tongue. All mix well and though not much vanilla to balance but to me the back of the tongue hot & spicy chilli is too much. It overpowered the other flavors. 
Overall you should try it, but I won't seek it out again. 569 charactersSHerninko, Nov 27, 2013

It poured black with a head that was a lighter tint than what I expected. The smell gave away the roast, vanilla, cocoa nibs and even a hint of spice. The taste was fantastic though. All previous smells that I stated were prevolent in the taste, plus a huge amount of habanero peppers. Overall it's one of the best beers I've ever had and would trade for it again in a heart beat! 434 charactersScaryHairy44, Nov 03, 2013

Third time this year cracking open a bomber of the best milk stout on the market! The spice at the end is almost superfluous, but it's the thought that counts. Right? It can actually generate some heat after a few pints. Definitely more heat than the Great Divide's excellent Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti. Overall, excellent appearance, taste, mouth feel, nose, if it were a year-round release it would definitely usurp my favorite offerings by Founders and Great Divide. 577 characterscommon_dissent, Oct 11, 2013

On the nose is big chocolate. Some coffee and bitter notes. I pick up a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon. There's also a slight hint of pepper in the background. 
Taste is milk chocolate. Sweet malts and some vanilla. A bit of cinnamon settles on the tongue towards the middle. The heat from the peppers rests on your tongue after you swallow. Very smooth. It's not as big and in your face as I'd expected. Definitely doesn't live up to the nose. It just seems a bit faint to me. As the beer warms the peppers really take over and it becomes less enjoyable. 
Mouthfeel is a bit chewy but nowhere near as big as I expected. Not necessarily let down, but I did expect more. Just a bit thin. A little bit of heat from the peppers but not too much. Very sticky though. Coats your lips. Heat takes over more and more as the beer warms. 
This is a great beer. Doesn't necessarily love up to the hype but it is very good. If you have a chance then pick it up. There are definitely things I can pick out that I'm not extremely fond of but it disappeared from my glass pretty quickly. Very easy to drink. 1,216 charactersdowen17, Sep 11, 2013

Acquired via trade
Thanks, brooklynbrews!
Black throughout and full in body. Thick brown head. Dots and irregular webs of stick left down the glass.
Aroma of chocolate and roast, a bit of an earthy and sweet vanilla character, and just a bit of a chile character.
The flavor is similar to the aroma--chocolate, roast, with definite habanero lingering, especially after the swallow. I don't pick up as much vanilla in the flavor as I do in the aroma.
Full-medium bodied with lower moderate carbonation. Very appropriate.
Quite tasty, and even though I enjoy spice and chiles, I wish the habanero was dialed down just a slight bit. Regardless, I'm very much enjoying my glass of this, but the pepper should be complementary instead of dominant. 762 charactersehammond1, Sep 07, 2013

The scent isn't overly complex but very sound in a dry chocolate and Graham cracker aroma.
Not necessarily a blend you expect it's creamy chocolate with a spicy kick. The spice is not overwhelming or deterring but acts as a compliment to strong creamy chocolate tones. I don't taste the actual peppers but I can find hints of cinnamon spiciness. The feel is not hot or burning but is present. This is amongst the best versions of a habenero brewed beer. 552 charactersKYGunner, Sep 04, 2013

Pours as a dark, viscous blackness. The head's probably a 2cm mocha coloured with decent retention and becomes a fairly thin film on the surface of the beer. Lacing is minimal but thick wherever it is. Swirling this beer in the glass stains it rather brown. Very reminiscent of chocolate.
Smells like sweet dark chocolate fudge. No hint of spiciness. This is mostly dominated by chocolates and cocoa here, like a chocolate coffee cake. Doesn't give much hints to what we are going to taste.
Flavour is very nice. It's full of chocolate, lactose sweetness and cocoa bitterness... hint of vanilla. But the real big kicker is the spice kick that seems puny on the first few sips, but quickly builds into a massive kick in the palate after a few minutes. It's broilingly hot awesomeness that really complements the earlier sweetness. Very interesting spicy chocolate cake flavour profile!
Full body, but a little bit on the thinner side compared to Hunahpu and Abraxas. Somehow this makes it more smooth and drinkable. Very rich and spicy aftertaste that lingers a while. This is probably the best-executed pepper spiciness I've had in a beer.
Its a bit thinner but does the pepper spiciness very well. I didn't get much cinnamon or vanilla here, unfortunately. I would have to put it like this: Abraxas is heavy on the cinnamon, Hunahpu is a very thick chocolate fudge beer, and Mexican Cake is spicy chocolate cake. They're all awesome and Mexican Cake holds up well to the other Mexican-style stouts. 1,680 charactersStevedore, Sep 01, 2013

Pours a thick, 2 finger chocolate colored head with excellent retention. Beer is opaque black. Lacing is thick but minimal with moderately thin legs and decent cling. Pretty.
Nose is chocolate, vanilla, fudge, cocoa, molasses and just the slightest touch of spice in the back. Real deep and aromatic. Delicious!
Opens sweet. Chocolate, vanilla and fudge. Cocoa powder and a big dose of spice kick towards the middle. End is more cocoa powder, lactose, chocolate, and fudge. This one actually reminds me of chocolate cake at the finish. Aftertaste is sweet and spicy. Pretty awesome!
Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and rich in the mouth and goes down spicy and silky with an accented finish and a lingering, hot, sticky aftertaste. This is spot on.
This is easily the best spicy stout I've ever come across. The body is astounding and really just makes the rest of the experience. Flavors exhibit nice complexity and the nose and look are deep and inviting but the body is what holds everything together here. An excellent beer! 1,112 charactersSpeedwayJim, Aug 27, 2013

A - Ink black with a thin layer of cocoa colored head.
S - Rich chocolate, spicy chilli pepper, sweet vanilla, roast and molasses. 
T - Dark cocoa and a nice spiciness with a touch of cinnamon coming though. The heat is present in the perfect proportion so as not to overpower the other aspects of the beer . The vanilla is subtle and adds a nice sweetness. A big roast profile is present throughout. A tough of heat lingers in the finish.
M - Medium body with a good chew. Light to moderate carbonation. Would have liked a touch more body, but still a nice mouth feel. 615 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Aug 24, 2013

Pours a pitch black with a foamy beige head. Exactly what you're looking for in this kind of beer. The smell is BIG on chocolate, very reminiscent of Big John. The taste is also insanely chocolaty and malty and the body is smooth and creamy. As the beer warms up you get a tad bit of heat on the back end as well, as the slight bit of habanero peppers start to make their presence known. Real tasty. 
Overall an exceptional stout that you should seek out. 492 charactersAxnjxn, Aug 22, 2013

A: Dark, dark, and dark. Small, dark brown head. This beer is brooding from the appearance onward...
S: The smell of this brew really stands out to me. The peppers smell on the front end, but taste on the back. A chocolatey richness comes through as well. 
T: Not as alcohol forward as I expected, but good and strong. Love the burn of the peppers at the finish. Dense and bold flavoring. 
Can't go wrong with this brew, and if discussing Westbrook with a newbie, this is the one I'd point to in order to display their ingenuity, creativity and the complexity they can achieve in a beer. 751 charactersjshusc, Aug 16, 2013

S: Loads of fresh roasted coffee beans, chocolate nesquick, cardboard, leather, nuts, oaky vanilla aroma, cinnamon and roasted peppers. Roast is putting off a subtle smokiness and astringent alcohol lurked in the background. 
T/M: The habanero is prominent, setting fire to the palate while submerged in decadent roasted malts. Cinnamon red hots, habaneros, cocoa, bitter luke warm coffee, dry grains, mocha latte, and finishes with bitter baking chocolate. Mouthfeel is a dueling devil, it starts sticky and thick then it begins to build on the spicy sting encompassing the mouth. 
O: Peppers and chocolate! What else do you need. This is a fantastic combination that I have enjoyed. At first the mouthfeel caught me off guard with the assertive spice and heat. I knew what was in it but didn't expect the heat to show up so much. I gotta say this is a spectacular offering from Westbrook. Cheers! 1,074 charactersHopswagger, Aug 15, 2013

Appearance: Dark midnight black, with more than enough sufficient lighting this brew is still opaque with small bubbles towards the head of the body. The head itself is a quite darker tan rising to maybe 1/4".
Smell: What a deep aroma, sweet coffee with a hit of mocha. You don't smell this beer you inhale it. 
Taste: This beer adds something new that you don't see too often, it gives you a hit of pepper with it's strong coffee bean feel. Jesus the molasses and the coffee, some sweet bitterness that is crazy addicting. 
Mouth: Paired properly with the right food, the stickiness alone is almost perfect. Medium, and so smooth. 
Overall: Borderline perfect, an easy top ten all around beer considering there so many out there and definitely a top five Imperial Stout. Ridiculously complex with a little bit of everything going on. Salud! 874 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Aug 09, 2013

pretty dark with 1/4-1/8 inch head
smell is heavy chocolate and you can slightly smell the peppers
taste is nice smooth really like the chocolate 
you get peppers on the back end but not overpowering light tingle on the back of the throat from the spice
think they used a real high-end chocolate or i just like the flavor lol

A- Pours black as night with a thick, light brown head that recedes slowly. Minimal lacing is left on the glass.
S- Dark chocolate and chili dominate the nose. Light cinnamon and vanilla are also noticeable, along with some vinous notes.
T- The first thing that strikes me about the flavor is the balance of all the components. Big doses of chili are counteracted by sweet chocolate, with the cinnamon tying everything together. I would like there to be some roastiness and maybe a bit more sweetness (which is weird for me to want) would improve this.
M- The mouthfeel is medium, mildly carbonated, with some heat from the peppers. The 10.5% abv is not noticeable at all!
O- Overall this is a very good beer that could just use some refinement on the slightly rough edges. 810 charactersSadMachine, Aug 05, 2013

Retains well, leaving rich and robust ringing along the sides of the glass. The aroma smells like chocolate cake, coffee, cinnamon sticks and chilies, with a smidge of green citrus and vanilla sweetness thrown in. I’m liking this. The taste is pretty similar. Baker’s chocolate, dense roasted coffee, a firm citric bitterness, slight alcohol sweetness, a touch of vanilla which bonds to the chocolate and finally, spices throughout, which really heat up the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a lively and sharp feel to the carbonation. The alcohol here does a little stinging in spots and it working with the peppers comes on a bit strong at times on the palate. While I found the first release of this to be an overall smoother beer, this latest go-around still has a lot to offer with plenty of rich flavors and a spicy kick! This is well worth seeking out. 988 charactersKegatron, Aug 01, 2013

A: Pours a pitch black color with a fingers worth of tan/brown head that lasts for a few minutes before settling down to a thin cap
S: Nicely complex. Get some bakers chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts, vanilla, and a hint of spice to round things off
T: Starts off with the roasted malts, and quickly hits on the bakers chocolate, cocoa, and vanilla. After a few seconds, the habanero and cinnamon kick up quite the spiciness that lingers far into the finish. The habanero really hits you in the back of the throat and lingers until the next sip. Get barely a hint of alcohol
M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth
O: Really an exceptional imperial stout. I've never had a beer with as much habanero kick as this one, but that's a good thing especially with how well it melds with all the other flavors. Very easy to drink for a 10.5% imperial stout. The only reservation is the price at $13.49 for a 22 oz. bomber. Well worth it at least once, though 991 charactersBEERMILER12, Jul 31, 2013

Black with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is loads of cocoa with a hint of hot pepper. Flavor follows with lots of cocoa, some roasted malts and a nice lingering spice. The habanero is well blended and not over the top. Great balance! A creamy texture with a nice low carbonation.
Fantastic! Interesting but balanced and well behaved. Well done! 409 charactersGJ40, Jul 28, 2013

A - Jet black, with a tan finger head. Monolithic like a good imperial stout.
S - Massive dark roast coffee with notes of cinnamon, vanilla, and pepper. Overtones of smoke and ethanol.
T - Wow. Burst of Dark chocolate and coffee tempered with vanilla and caramel, but all of this gives way to a sharp, smoky spice from the habaneros. Resolves the taste and clears the palate, leaving a smoke and chocolate memory before the next sip. Alcohol is expertly masked.
M - Heavy thick and creamy. Sticks to your mouth like it knows you want it to stay.
Wonderfully singular brew. Happy that I have another fifty-two ounces. I'll be sad to see the end of it.

The heat from the habanero peppers was perfect on this creating a complex tasting stout that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. You don't feel the heat from the peppers until a few seconds after it washes down and your mouth has already been coated with those classic imperial stout characteristics. I highly recommend trying this beer and I hope to pick up some of the barrel aged versions of this as well. Cheers! 523 charactersApom, Jul 21, 2013

Appearance - dark, dark, dark. Nice! Mild lacing on this one, and it is tannish. 
Smell - You can smell the hint of spice, the vanilla and the cacao. 
Taste - is a great stout with vanilla, chocolate, and the spice gets you on the back palate, after a few sips. Very subtle spice to me, but it was just right.
Mouthfeel - nice on the carbonation and the over all feeling was full and sleek. Really well put together.
Overall - Solid from top to bottom, great mix of flavors, not one is overbearing. Yesiree! 543 charactersZbeetleman, Jul 16, 2013

4.09/5  rDev -6.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Many thanks to AtlCarl, who send me this bottle for the equivalent of a 47th round draft pick. 22 oz. big boy split with my wife, bottled 5/15/13.
Pour is dead black with quick-disappear ring of minimal carbonation. Nose is remarkable, like the thickest, most chocolatey chocolate milk you've ever had (I recently witnessed this!) & a touch of vanilla. But the liquid fudge is uniquely pudge-inducing. 
Mexican Cake is probably an apt metaphor for Mexican cake, I'm guessing. The peppers bound out of the gate & sting the palate with heat & light, just the right amount to keep the taste bud choir in good pitch. Playing hide and seek under the moderate inferno is that lovely chocolate flavoring. Faint vanilla, maybe roast, probably cinnamon, but I wouldn't have IDed that if it hadn't been on the label. Pepper heat slaughters all comers on the downslide: it's all peppers, all the time in the aftertaste. Still, I could drink some more of this. 
Overall this is a very good beer that, despite the label, I think could use some time. Right now the peppers are so dominant that I can barely peek under the heat shield to discern a few of the other flavors. I'm going to sit on my other bottle for six months & I'll wager it's going to be in the excellent range once the chiles calm a bit. 1,293 charactersmaximum12, Jul 14, 2013

4.49/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is quite legendary in our parts. I missed it on Westbrook's first anniversery but made a point to take a mission across enemy lines into South Carolina to capture some of the Second Anniversery booty. (Yeay!! 4 bottles!!)
Poured from a bomber into an Ass Clown Snifter.
A: Solid inky very dark brown, opaque. First pour was a little cool and only produced a thin head, 2nd pour once it had warmed delivered a lovely 2 finger dark mocha head of tiny tight bubbles.
N: Vanilla and cinammon over roasty malts dominate. The slightest hint of cocoa, and I don't get any of the chile. Does not smell boozy.
T: Wow, what a delicious Imperial Stout!! The chocolate is much more prominent on the tongue than in the nose, a combo of baker's chocolate and milk chocolate. Yummy, but not really milk stout creamy. Pretty strong cinammon mole flavor, and the habaneros are a soft sucker punch on the finish. I found the chile to be subdued and only on the back of the palate at finish, others have complained it was too aggressive. Flavors here are well integrated, it's not the level of complexity of a KBS or Event Horizon where layer after layer is peeled back, you get it all together, but it works.
MF: Relatively substantial mouthfeel, but not really heavy and chewy. Good coating of the mouth despite ample carbonation.
O: This is an epic imperial stout that I would put right up in the upper echelon. I would love to age a few bottles, but the label says to drink it fresh, so I guess I better get to it!!. 1,517 charactersJeffreyJDavis, Jul 13, 2013

A: Pours black as night. Dark tan head. Tight bubbled. Alcohol feet. Sheeting of alcohol.

T: Soft chocolate bitterness on the front of the palate. Some sweetness. Bakers chocolate. The pepper really hits you in the back end. Grows with a slight burn.

The aroma is of a moderate roast with some dark chocolate undertones. Light vanilla and a subtle cinnamon sweetness. Very subtle hint of hot pepper. 
Moderate roast with a nice blend of milk and dark chocolate. Some lactose presence that help smooths the brew. A dark berry sweet and tart note. Good building heat from the chilies. Not much from the cinnamon. Vanilla and dark caramel sweetness. Toasted pumpernickel malt. 
The feel is well bodied with tingly carbonation. Sweet and bitter on the palate and sticky in the finish. Good pepper burn.

S - Strong scents of fresh ground Columbian coffee and peppers. The more subtle scents of vanilla and cinnamon don't hit the nose until this beer warmed up. Has some roasted malt and cocoa notes.
T - Oddly the chocolate is much more pronounced to the palate than in the smell. Milk chocolate is dominant, as is some cinnamon spice. The heat of those habaneros hit the roof of the mouth and remind you that this has some heat. Its not gentle but clearly delivers on its promise. 
M - This is a thick syrupy beer that feels a bit lighter in body but is still a sipping beer. Not sessionable; the heat will be a palate wrecker. I had with dessert and really that's the best spot to enjoy this.
O - Not quite Hunahpu but this is a standout beer. If I couldn't score the whale from CCB I would certainly settle on this. First offering from Westbrook and this would make me curious of their other beers. 1,048 characterssocon67, Jul 05, 2013

4.09/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to BA Shilt for hooking me up with a bomber of this. Poured into a snifter, the brew appears black in color with 2 fingers worth of dark brown froth that slowly fades leaving patches of lace on the glass. A swirl revives a dark brown finger of silk back to the surface that holds with solid retaining powers.
The aroma is quite cake-like. Sweet milk chocolate mixed with a deeper more earthen baker's cocoa. Hints of vanilla really accent the chocolate appeal. There is a hint of citrus present I assume to be from the chili inclusion because it also includes that peppery spice blending at the same time the citrus notes are evident. A little bit of roasted coffee comes out as it warms up as well as some notes of cinnamon bark.
The taste is quite roasted and earthen. Right upfront is an immediate indication of the spicy pepper inclusion. The peppers bring a spicy tingle of heat as well as citrus element. The spice blends well with notes of chocolate and vanilla. The chocolate taste is more earthen and bitter like baker's cocoa but as more sips are taken, more vanilla comes out and it starts to get a bit sweet like milk chocolate. The aftertaste has roasty coffee and a hint of cinnamon.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is smooth in the feel yet spicy and complex. This was an enjoyable sipper but admittedly, I think the spice got to me before the alcohol did. That would be my only gripe about this beer, while chiliheads im sure scream for more, I would prefer it tamed back a bit to increase its overall drinkability. Regardless, this is an enjoyable brew that is worth seeking out. I wouldnt mind having it again sometime. 1,684 charactersstakem, Jul 01, 2013

S: sweet chocolately malts, fudge, the suggestion of spice in the air

This beer is exactly what is says on the label - sweet, but with a drying spicy/peppery-ness that balances it out perfectly - and they have a Mexican Coffee Cake version? OMG.
M: the beer itself is dense and viscous, but doesn't leave a tacky coating (probably the pepper and spice's doing); hot pepper will tingle your tongue and throat right off the bat and throughout the drink
O: you have to try this, assuming you enjoy that chili pepper heat in a stout - super dense, rich, and delightful - its one of those beers that, if you can get your hands on to try, you do. 856 charactersGreywulfken, Jun 29, 2013
4.08/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Westbrook goblet. Thick and viscous, opaque black, with a well-retaining half-inch cap of mocha head that left a few streaks of lacing on the glass when swirled. That's what I like to see. Aroma was a bit muted at first, but came out more as the beer warmed a bit, as expected. Dark roasty malts, cocoa, coffee, not much of the other elements of the beer, though again, the peppery spice was more apparent as the beer warmed. In the taste, earthy cocoa, dark chocolate and roasty dark malts up front, with the habaneros making themselves quite obvious mid-palate, a strong, spicy sensation prickling the taste buds, roasty aftertaste with a bit of coffee, and just a hint of vegetal vanilla bean; didn't get any cinnamon whatsoever. About halfway through the beer, the palate adjusted and the pepper heat mellowed quite a bit, turning this into quite a nice sipper. I'd say the body was nearly full, mouthfeel was pretty smooth for a habanero beer. Overall quite good. Cheers! 990 charactersRifugium, Jun 29, 2013

Had originally at The FESTIVAL in Portland, ME on 6/22/13 as my first taster and it was phenomenal. I describe it as a jet black pour with a little brown head. Super creamy, silky with a great medium/heavy body. Can definitely get perfect malt notes with cocoa, vanilla and a strong heat backbone that originally could be mistaken for alcohol but I think its the habanero peppers.. 
Overall a gem and despite the bottle saying don't age I picked up 4 so I might keep one to see how it tastes with a year or two on it in the cellar. I would seek this beer out and buy it any time I see it. 699 charactersalaimoa, Jun 27, 2013

4.34/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Got a few bottles of this from various people - thank you to all. The pour is very dark; dark enough to be called black, allowing almost no light to pass through when staring directly at it. The head is a thing of beauty; fine-bubbled, foamy, and mocha in color, it's slow to settle down and leaves pretty decent lacing for a 10%+ ABV imperial stout.
At first, the aroma took me back and seemed just a tad cluttered. Luckily, as things progressed and the beer warmed up a bit, the different aromatic elements started to mesh and intertwine quite nicely, which is a good thing since there's so much going on. I highly suggest letting this one warm a bit before enjoying it.
The nose is heavy with milky chocolates, sweet, sweet vanilla beans, substantial roasted malt, and a light dash of cinnamon. Peppers go somewhat unnoticed in the aroma, and any kind of spiciness noted can probably be attributed to the cinnamon. Very robust smelling, a complex and nice execution of many different parts. Mild leathery notes on the very back end.
The first sip starts off with a beautiful dose of roasted malts before quickly becoming compounded with mounds of cocoa nibs and lively, sweet vanilla. It tastes like a molten fudge cake with warm vanilla drizzle on top. Very sweet, pushing the edge of almost being too sweet, but luckily falling just short and remaining manageable the whole time.
Cinnamon is a bit understated at first, but becomes quite nice with even more warmth; nice, toasty cinnamon flavor without being too spicy on the tongue. Peppers don't add much flavor-wise, but they are appreciated in the form of a lasting tingle on the very back of the throat and tongue. A solid, layered addition without adding any real "heat" to the brew, rendering it undrinkable.
Mexican Cake finishes with a sweet, resounding aftertaste full of nuttiness, vanilla, heavy fudge, a touch of cinnamon, and some tingling pepper presence. The viscous and thick body is just shy of chewy, but feels good for a stout; medium carbonation. I was hesitant to try this because with this list of ingredients, things could easily have gone awry. Luckily the execution was great, and the beer was really quite tasty. 2,199 characterstectactoe, Jun 27, 2013

Appearance- Pitch black with 2 fingered fluffy mocha head that lasted about 3 minutes. Gorgeous lacing.
Smell- Choclate, cinnamon, coffee, vanilla. Dark stone fruit. No booze.
Taste- Similar to the smell, but with heavier cinnamon and very light chili. The Habanero leaves a nice mild burn at the end though.
Mouthfeel- Surprisingly light. No hint of booze. Very drinkable. Nice thickness.
Overall- I'd say that this is a new permawant. Sooo good. 530 charactersSeanniek91, Jun 25, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled on 5/15/13.
Appearance: Very dark brown, near black body with a near lofty, medium tan-hued head.
Smell: Fairly roasty nose with an agreeable aroma of bittersweet chocolate flecked with a bit of vanilla and given a pinch of cinnamon atop the underlying vein of earthy, spice-evoking chile peppers.
Taste: Dark chocolate atop a firmly roasted, faintly ashen maltiness yielding a light astringency. Subtle vanilla. A little singe of cinnamon mingled amongst the sweetness. Showing some chile heat lumped in with the mild hop, sustained charred grain element, and the warming alcohol. The chile quality lasts into the warm, chocolaty finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Fairly smooth, creamy on the tongue.
Overall: While it is another in what is a fairly long line of loud, big, brash imperial stouts, your heart has fucking died if you didn't enjoy it. 885 charactersChainGangGuy, Jun 23, 2013

Smells of cocoa, slight earthy peppers. Layered beneath that, there is a vanilla bean sweetness and cinnamon.
Follows the nose with chocolates, vanilla sweetness and a pleasant smoldering heat that rests on your palate long after the swallow. Fairly sweet on the finish, but it does have the word cake in its name.
Appropriate mouth feel but perhaps a tiny amount thinner than I might want. Moderate to low carbonation. 
Excellent mexican style stout.
Edit: I enjoyed the the 2014 version of this beer a fair amount more than the 2013. 664 charactersPowderhornphil, Jun 22, 2013

 Had the first batch of this and loved it but i guess those notes haven't been added yet so reviewing the newest batch that i found locally. Enjoyed from a westbrook snifter. brew poured a rather stunning rich thick black. generous phone meet and head that was gone relatively quick leaving patches of mocha bubbles and its wake. smells like a Mexican cake chocolate vanilla Peppers great sweetness on the nose is perfectly complemented with cinnamon. taste is complex. this beer can easily hang with hunah. everything is in its right place. body is fairly full but you would expect that from a stout this size. the peppers make it feel lighter and the cinnamon tames down the peppers. make no mistake though there is some spicey heat on the finish. definitely worth a shot for any fans of hunah. 813 characterscosmicevan, Jun 17, 2013

4.06/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4The beer pours a nice viscous black color with really not a whole lot of head to speak of, just a tan ring, slight lacing with a swirl that goes down quickly. 
The smell honestly just smells like a normal imperial stout with some dark malty roast notes and no hops to speak of, some cocoa powder and maybe just a slight hint of the earthy oily peppers, I don't get any cinnamon at all but there is some vanilla bean too but I oldnt have called it if I didn't read it on the bottle. Mostly just a better than average stout aroma the additions unfortunately don't do a lot for the aroma for me. 
The taste does come through ith some rich notes of flavor: creamy vanilla chocolate ice cream like notes, a slight cinnamon overtone, just a bit of heat from the peppers in the lingering semi biter sweet aftertaste. Defiantly a big roasty mid palate on this beer no doubt this is a stout with the malt bill as well. 
The feel is good, it has a bit of heat but a smooth silky feel that is nice. The aftertaste is surprisingly dry on my palate which isn't a plus for the style IMHO. Decent body.
Overall a good but not great beer, not in the ballpark of some other beers in this vein. 1,180 charactersDreadnaught33, Jun 15, 2013
4.63/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a growler into a snifter. Freshness date read 5/15/13.
A-Pours a viscous, motor oil color black with a thick, rich and smooth toffee colored head. Brilliant. The head retains fairly well and the foam cascades down the glass when I sip it leaving behind a fair amount of lacing. 
S-The booze and habanero peppers hit you at first but it fades smoothly into a symphony of chocolate cake, dry wheat, cocoa nibs, and flour. Some vanilla works its way in there as well. A lot of depth and nuance to this brew.
T-The booze isn't as present here as it was in the nose, thankfully. This tastes exceptional. The spice is aggressive at the front but is countered by a lovely sweetness. The middle and the back of the palate combine to introduce a lovely taste of bitter dark chocolate, subtle notes of coffee, sweet chocolate cake, vanilla, and then a lingering spicy bite. The nuances in this beer are incredible. 
MF-Not as thick as I typically like my stouts, and I assume thats because of the spice. It finishes a bit dry. My least favorite aspect of this brew.
O-World-class. It's an annual summer release so if you see it, buy it. It's up there with the other imperials. Plus, it's very unique. 1,207 charactersJacurdy60, Jun 15, 2013

A - Pours jet black with a thick dense two finger coffee color head. No faults in the appearance, perfect for an Imperial Stout - not much more can be said about that. 
S - This is where the beer scores the lowest for me. The underlying flavors are there but muted, get a little chocolate, some heat, and some roasted dark malts. Opens up as it warms, spicy notes appear as the cinnamon and habanero welcome themselves to the party. 
T - Complexity abounds. As the beer pulls you in, you literally can see your self with a luscious slice of dense chocolate cake with vanilla frosting and cinnamon and habanero in the fold. This is flavor layered upon flavor, with the spicy notes coming at the end of the taste. Remarkable and memorable. 
M - Not to thick and not too sweet, the flavors meld in a glorious interplay of contrasting tones. Coating but not cloying, this is a very drinkable big beer. 
O - One of my favorite non-BA Imperial Stouts. The label says to drink fresh and I don't think I can disagree with that. Aging this beer runs you the risk of severely muting one of the flavors that brings the contrasting re-freshness of this beer. Would love to have again, but happy that I had the chance to get this now. 1,314 charactersnesarebad, Jun 13, 2013
4.11/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz bottle.
Pours a pitch black color. Like an abyss of darkness were no light can escape. A somewhat aggressive pour yields a nice 1.25 inch head that is pretty dense like an espresso and of a nice light tan almost cream color. The head is dense and retention is pretty impressive with some slight sticky notes.
Aroma starts off with some midl vanilla notes with nice deep rich coca notes that are almost hard to detect 'cuz they are so intense (figure that one). There is some mild grainy notes and slight sweetness to the brew with some peppery notes as well. As it warms the coca nib notes seem more appreciable and there is some slight coffee roast as well.
Flavor starts off nice coca notes; rich, slightly sweet and bitter dark coca notes. This is then followed by some nice cinnamon notes mixed in with midl vanilla notes that smooth the cocoa notes out. Some slight espresso is present. Then the real fun starts prickly and spicy pepper notes beging to coat the tongue and the whole mouth. Once all these flavors are perceived a nice combination of coca and cinnamon and the spicy peppers interplay with each other and linger on the palette for a long while. There is some nice espresso and dark bitter chocolate that is noted on the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit light for the style and a thicker body would compliment the flavor profile better.
Overall this brew was interesting and is pretty delicious. Quite intense pepper notes compared to other "spicy" stouts I've had. Body is not as thick as I would like. Other than that solid brew. 1,589 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jun 13, 2013

A: Pours a dark, deep black color with a dark tan head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thin cap with a slightly thicker collar.
S: Deep chocolate with a lot of roast. There is mild dark fruit character with a gingerbread cookie type sweetness to it. A light touch of mild pepper on the nose. Very inviting as it's not as intense as I would have imagined. It makes me want to dig in more.
T: There's the pepper! Not entirely fleshy, but a nice balance of pepper flesh and spicy. It lingers in the back of the throat for a little while after each sip. The dark fruit character is there from the nose and there is a slight hint of the fruity house yeast that I've come to expect from Westbrook stouts. Heavy roasted malts with with some unsweetened chocolate.
M: Medium bodied with a medium low carbonation. Carbonation is spot on, but I'd like a little bit more chew to the body. Finish has some nice spicy heat.
O: A touch more body would have been great, but overall this is a really nice beer. The ABV is well hidden and it's pretty balanced. It's still not in the realm of Abraxas or Hunahpu, but it's still a great beer that I'd gladly have again. 1,214 charactersTreebs, Jun 13, 2013

a - poured a one finger thick creamy, coffee-colored head into a snifter that left good lacing and sheeting throughout. the body was jet black.

t - cinnamon and cocoa with a big spicy finish. lots of pepper but it smooths out as it warms.
m - creamy coating.

A: Super dark and black. Nice medium sized head with a brown/orange tint.
S: Wonderful cocoa.
T: Straight up Habaneros at first, which I loved. If you like spicy food this beer is for you. Once it settled and warmed up, the heat subdued and the cocoa came out. Possibly detected some vanilla and coffee notes.

Smell - chocolate is definitely present. There's a lot if this vegetable sense too though. Like a green pepper. Slight slight cinnamon. Didn't get any vanilla like I was expecting. 
Taste - bittersweet chocolate, light roasted coffee. Small amounts of vanilla. Finishes with a lasting mild pepper. The pepper really only comes through in the end and isn't huge at all. Pepper is fresh instead of ground. 
Mouthfeel - this is where I experience the pepper the most. It really lingers in the back if the throat. Slightly less thick thank I thought it would be, but is definitely not thin. Low carbonation level with sticky residue. Covers the alcohol very well. The flavora inhibit the drinkability not the booze. 
Overall - super awesome beer. A fresher take on the pepper than say end of days or hunaphu's. really great mouthfeel. Not insanely complex, but well above average. Simply a joy to experience. 
I'm a little suspicious that the growler has had a slight effect on the beer. Maybe. 1,127 characterscsparace, Jun 08, 2013

Bottled on 5/15/13. Poured into a snifter on 6/1/13.
A: Pitch-black, syrupy, similar to a motor oil. Great head (two fingers) and slowly dissipates with a super-thin layer of foam. Nice retention and laces very beautifully.
S: Picked up on chocolate notes right away, some vanilla, cinnamon, toffee, and coffee. Very nice.
T: Incredible! I thought I was tasting actual dessert, which was chocolate, roasted espresso, and toffee all in one. The best part was the lingering aftertaste of habanero peppers around my tongue and in my throat. Not a painful response but a quite nice stimulating experience.
M: Full-bodied with strong carbonation, creamy, and tons of spicy aftertaste.
O: Amazing beer. This is probably the first imperial stout with true spicy aftertaste I've had. This one left a wonderful impression on me and will be going into my ISO list. Marvelous job by Westbrook! 928 characterscw577enfield, Jun 02, 2013

T: Chocolate up front with the vanilla and cinnamon in the middle, followed by the peppers and the alcohol burn. The peppers are more pronounced than hunahpu. 
M: thick and viscous. Good levels of carbonation. Heavy body.
O: Great beer by the guys at Westbrook. Is it as good as hunahpu? I would say its just a tick below, but still fantastic. I could drink a ton of these, good thing I have a few. 645 charactersGtreid, May 31, 2013

this mexican cake is pretty great. its an imperial stout and pour opaque, just like i like my stouts. the head is a nice chocolate brown. the smell is sweet and spicy. the taste is chocolate which a slight burn at the back end due to the habenero peppers and the 10.5% abv. this is a great beer and i will look forward to picking up every year when the release a batch. i also look forward to other beer from westbrook- they seem to get better and better. 821 charactersmattkoon, May 27, 2013

Appearance - Black almost inky. Nice khaki head and nice lace.
Smell - Chocolate. That's kinda all I smell. Some caramel and a faint hint of cinnamon. Actually, the more I sniff it I realize there's lots of vanilla.
Taste - Oh man that's good. Lots of chocolate. Lots of vanilla. The pepper comes through sudden and strong, but doesn't seem spicy. Just a good pepper flavor. Finishes with more chocolate and pepper.
Mouthfeel - The spice builds. Medium heavy body. Not quite the thickness that could withstand the spice, but good.
Overall - So every beer like this begs the Hunahpu comparison. This one is a different focus. More of the habanero pepper and cinnamon. Less blended, but really nice. 745 charactersAlieniloquium, May 25, 2013

4.43/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours nearly black into my Charleston Beer Exchange tulip glass with 1.5 fingers of rich chocolate colored head. Retnetion is solid - a think layer remains across the top and a thick outer ring leads the lacing up the glass (~8 minutes after pour)
S - Lots of sweet and roasty chocolate, oak and vanilla and with a sweet pepper burn in the nose (maybe that's the cinnamon?). 
T - Super smooth and delicious. Roasty slightly smokey, bitter cocoa and vanilla transitions to a slightl alcohol burn and cinnamon. The delay aftertaste is heavy on spicey (but slightly sweet) peppers. Pretty sure this is going have more of a burning effect as it goes!
M - Full bodied and minimally carbonated - incredibly smooth, fantastic to drink.
O - Didn't disappoint. Perfect mouthfeel, really nice taste, perfect amount of habenero (which is so key). Otherwise tastes like a delicious chocolate/vanilla/oak stout (my favorite). I'd love to try this without the habeneros as well - I'm sure this is better, but that would be pretty damn good too! 1,038 charactersMacQ32, May 22, 2013

A: Pitch black with a thin, dirty brown head.
S: Rich milk chocolate aroma.
T: Rich chocolate, biscuit-y, finishes with a subtle dark chocolate bitterness. The heat from the pepper lingers nicely. 
M: Sumptuous, rich, thick and heavy. A nice medium pepper heat that coats the mouth.
O: Heat from the peppers more distinct than I recall from the anniversary release, resulting in an even more complex version than the original. Rich chocolate nearly on par with ST Chocolat, but with a perfect pepper heat. This beer changes so much depending on the temperature it is served at. Peppers come out once it warms to mid/high 50's. All around wonderfully complex beer that is surprisingly drinkable; I used this as a test ground for observing how temperature can transform a beer. 849 charactersicehawk, May 20, 2013

Pours a big fizzy fluffy dark head, decent lacing and nice legs.
Nose has cocoa nibs, dusty oak barrel and wooden shelf, light cinnamon, woody esters, hint of dark chocolate and vanilla.
Taste brings sweet chocolate, caramel, dusty oak and wooden shelf, nice light chili pepper heat, little cinnamon again, little soy though too, light bready malts, thick and lush, hot pepper and booze there, syrupy.
Mouth is thick and syrupy, decent carb, some booze and pepper heat.

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark brownish black hue with a one finger khaki head that fades to leave light lacing. Pretty solid.
S - Nice vanilla, chocolate, super light heat. Very, very faint cinnamon and sweeter malts.
T - Taste is more of the light faint head, tons of chocolate. Very nice vanilla, slight chipotle smoke. Fairly malty and sweet. Not getting much cinnamon.
M - Super carbonated, almost distractingly so. Yet some how it is thick and chewy...makes no sense, but it is what it is. 
O - Overall glad I got to try this one, finally. Its a damn solid mexican style stout. Would like a bit more spice and cinnamon though. 825 charactersrudzud, Apr 12, 2013

Pours a very dark, oily near black liquid with a dark brown mocha head. Obviously a serious and thick stout.
Smells like sweet rich chewy malt, chocolate cake batter, moderate chili and cinnamon. Mmm.
Yeah this is super malty and rich, pretty sweet with loads of chocolate. Fades into chili and cinnamon and finishes with a fair amount of spice but not as much as Abraxas or Hunahpu's. 
Mouthfeel is pretty well carbonated, thick and almost chewy.
This is great! A very different base beer than Abraxas or Hunah's. I imagine the base stout would be pretty great even without the added ingredients.

With a bold chocolaty appearance, the dark brown (almost black) ale settles with a viscous and creamy pour that causes for a slow separation of beer from foam. The moussey froth takes on a medium brown hue, shows sturdy retention, and laces well. A gentle swirl of the glass leaves inky legging on the glass that's reminiscent of brandy.
Strong chocolate notes sooth the sense of smell with a very dessert-like reaction. Met with background note of dark fruit, espresso, fudge, and rum, the malty rich beer pulls complexities from yeast, hops, and rich toffee-ish malt.
Strong chocolate and roast flavors begin with a heavy coat across the palate. Fudge-like sweetness is propelled by bittersweet chocolate, burnt toffee, espresso, and walnut oils. Secondary notes of vinous sherry wines offer a more succulent and fruity note that opens up a bready, savory taste. Rum-like alcohols offer a spicy sweetness that cuts through the malts and balances the sweetness in finish.
Certainly full bodied, the larger-than-life ale continues the fudge-like character with it thick and marshmallowy textures. Alcohol burn acts as a thinning agent and lessens the rich body just enough to savor the silky complexities to finish the beer. Shy of cloying, the roast of bitterness and heat signal closure, but allow the dessert-like nuances to linger indefinately.
Although it's Westbrook's birthday, I feel like I had gotten a gift in being able to try this luscious ale. The only thing that's missing is the candle. 1,724 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 23, 2012

From a bomber into a snifter
Brewed for their 1st Anniversary 
Bottled on 25 January 2012
APPEARANCE: This one slowly foamed out a bit, which is never a good sign. A dark, black pour yields a huge, massive, booming looser light mocha colored head that just doesn't quit. The glass is 4/5 head, and it actually looks infected as it continues to grow over the next 15 minutes. Thick black body with higher levels of carbonation evident. Very carbonated for the style. Head eventually fades to a full cap and leaves some chunky lacing down the glass. Too carbonated and the head is out of control. Looks infected as well. 
SMELL: Initially there's quite a bit of sour brett and cherries on the nose, with light vinegar as well. This might be infected. As it sits, however, these off aromas fade and the original beer comes through more. Some roasted malts, cocoa powder and peppers appear, with chillies and cocoa nibs. Some light vanilla as well. In retrospect, perhaps the sour notes at the beginning came from the bold cinnemon and chili peppers. After they were allowed to air out, the other qualities showed up and this actually came together pretty well. 
TASTE: Not infected at all. It's really nice actually. Roasted notes with chili peppers up front. Some nice cocoa powder and vanilla flavors at the swallow. A bolder finish of roasted maltes, bitter espresso, cocoa nibs and a good dose of cinemon and sharp habanero peppers. Quite spicy on the finish, but everything works well together. Fun stuff. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Slightly prickly on the palate, could definitely be creamier, goes down okay and finishes slightly sticky. Lots of spicy peppers linger providing a decent tickel at the back of the throat after the swallow. 
OVERALL: What a ride. This beer is all over the map. The look sucks and the nose doesn't know what the score is, but the flavor is excellent and very complex. I would love to see this bottled again with the cinnemon a little more restrained and the look cleaned up. As it is now, a this is a fun beer well worth checking out. Cheers again claaark13! 2,324 charactersJeffo, Oct 14, 2012

Pitch opaque black with a really thick, seriously dark brown head. It looks delicious.
Rich, dark malty aroma. Strong chocolate and some coffee also.
Really complex flavors going on here. Lots of chocolate, some spice. A tingling on the tongue (from the habaneros, I assume.).
Thick, thick mouthfeel. One of the heaviest bodied beers I've had in a while.
I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this beer. I really like the peppers. 455 charactersUnderPressure, Sep 23, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.532oz growler. Thanks to DonFrap for bringing this one. Poured into Hunahpu snifter. Growler split 5 ways. Drank right after Zhukov and Hunahpu during our stout tasting.
Despite being cellared for just over a month the cap came off this with a very nice hiss. Filled my snifter about 2/3 of the way (just under 7 ounces).
A- Pours a dark opaque black with a thin layer of creamy mocha brown head that recedes to leave a still top. Nice retention for a thin layer of head, leaves nice layered lacing. Fairly viscous and oily, but slightly less then the Hunahpu and Zhukov we had right before. Nice carbonation, especially after sitting in a growler for almost a month.
S- Chocolate, cinnamon, some peppers in the background. About average aroma strength, the aroma was pleasant but nothing that special about it.
T- The taste really out-does the aroma in this one. Thick creamy chocolate almost like chocolate frosting without being too rich. Some light vanilla + roasted coffee with a nice presence of cinnamon that adds flavor to the beer, but doesn't dominate it too much. Some fairly subtle habanero peppers on the finish that add a slight bit of spiciness and gives it that lightly spiced Mexican cake presence. Everything is very flavorful and well balanced.
M- Fairly thick although a little bit less so then the Zhukov and Hunahpu. Creamy and definitely on the thicker side for a beer, but definitely not too thick. In my opinion a very nice body. A nice level of carbonation for being kept in a growler. The chili peppers tingle the tongue a little bit without providing too much heat. Abv extremely well hidden. Very drinkable.
O- My first offering I've tried from Westbrook, but it definitely left a great impression. Literally what you would expect from a chocolate Mexican Cake. Not as good as Hunahpu, but definitely up there and did not disappoint even though the two were drank back to back. I would definitely like to revisit this one and would even consider trying to trade for it. If you like chocolate, I would definitely recommend this beer. 2,066 charactersjaasen64, Sep 15, 2012

L – Jet black color with a 2-finger brown frothy head. Nice retention as the head fades down slowly into a thin layer of froth that lingers on the beer’s surface throughout. Really nice lacing.
S – The first thing that is apparent is the kick from the added cinnamon and peppers. A strong stout backbone is also there with aromas of roasted coffee and chocolate malts, plum esters, and vanilla. 
T – Starts off sweet with chocolate, vanilla, and dark fruit flavors. As the taste progresses, the cinnamon and peppers come into play and turn up the heat. This added spice sticks around while the roasted coffee bitterness creeps in and lasts throughout the finish. A little bit of alcohol becomes apparent at the finish, as well. Very tasty.
F – Full-bodied with pretty good carbonation, a rich and creamy mouthfeel, and a spicy, slightly bitter, and slightly dry finish. All of the flavors in this thing linger, but cinnamon spice lingers the longest. The heat from the spices melds with the throat-warming sensation that appears at the finish from the alcohol.
O – This beer is awesome. If you took away the “Mexican” kick, it would still be a good stout. The cinnamon and peppers only make it that much better and more unique. This has all the usual notes of a well-done stout plus more. Another job very well done by Westbrook. I’m so pumped that I got to try this one, and I hope they decide to brew it again. 1,501 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Sep 07, 2012

Many thanks to PDXHops
Wow, I haven't seen such a thick, inky incredibly dark brown imperial stout in quite a while. It's no surprise the beer blocks all light once in the glass. The pour yields a massive, dense array of mocha colored foam; there are easily several inches worth of foam here. The top of said foam smooths as the head collapses slowly. Heavy drapes of lace cling for a few moments before drying up or sliding down the glass.
Depth and darkness have a fastened hold on the aroma like few others. While the habanero peppers had the first say while the beer was still in the bottle, once in the glass, burnt tones are in full force. Molasses, prune, rum-soaked raisins. Hints of scorched dark chocolate. The head's demise finds a more open aroma and it's only then that the added ingredients make known their contributions. Habanero singes the edges of dusty cocoa and cinnamon atmosphere. The vanilla bean is fairly soft, offering a creaminess to the overall aromatic effect.
Huh. The taste is far, far different than the dense, dark sugar-heavy flavor I was expecting. My first reaction is that the beer has a lot of tangy roast going on; however, there is a more complex assessment to be made. Indeed, the flavor is "brighter" than expected, but I find that to be largely the work of the peppers, which bring right away a moderate spiciness to the tongue. Further digging finds many of the dark sugars that seemed absent initially. Molasses and burnt chocolate with hints of prunes and a very subtle dark fruitiness. Cinnamon is largely concealed, though notions of the spice occasional sneak in for a quick peck on the lips. Intermittent tobacco notes. The finish finds a surprisingly dry, burnt, ashy flavor (much to my liking) and the habanero tapers off at a slow, enjoyable pace.
The feel starts off vivacious with a flurry of carbonation and hepped-up spices. However, over time the viscous, heavy body of the beer emerges - slick, sticky and sugary. That said, Mexican Cake is neither particularly cloying or hot with alcohol (though it's possible the habanero could be masking the moderately high alcohol content). In a showing off good faith, the carbonation dies down considerably which lets every nuance of flavor to wallow in gluttonous excellence.
Much like a real cake, Mexican cake should probably be enjoyed by a few other appreciators of fine baked (brewed) goods. Also much like a real cake, the fat, fat, fatty feeling of consuming a whole Mexican Cake can feel pretty damn good. 2,582 charactersRyan011235, Sep 06, 2012

22oz bottle. Big thanks to Andrew for the hookup on this one.
A - Pours black with a two finger dark brown head. Head retention is decent, and there is a good amount of lacing to be had here...
S - Chocolate, vanilla, roast, chilies, and spice. Chili is not dominate on the nose, but blends in very nicely. Smells sweet and spicy. Very inviting...
T - Chocolate is present throughout with vanilla, some light roast, and cinnamon in the mix. Also pick up a hint of dark fruit. Finishes on a chili note with the abv being very well hidden. Like the nose the chili doesn't dominate, but is very balanced with the other flavors...
M - Rich and creamy. Sits somewhere on the higher end of the medium bodied scale with a moderate amount of carbonation...
O - Really enjoyed this one. I've heard there is alot of hype on the east coast about this beer, and I can see why. Not world class, but damb good. Will be looking to try some of Westbrooks other offerings...

Beautiful black pour, tan head, sticky lace. Fantasticly complex aroma showcases the various ingredients, particularly vanilla & chiles. Reminds me of Hunahpu, and that's a serious compliment.
Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, chiles, roasty malt, and boozy warmth melt together to present a remarkably balanced flavor profile. Peppers and chocolate linger after swallowing. Super complex, yet it works. Again, comparisons to Huna dance in my head.
A fantastic example of creativity in the American craft brewing scene. More please! 559 charactersbrystmar, Aug 17, 2012

Growler poured into a snifter
A: Pours a moderately viscous appearing opaque jet black, with only the faintest dark mocha colored head that comes and comes almost instantaneously.  Leaves no appreciable lacing, but some alcohol legs can be seen running down the glass.  
S: Initial aroma of chocolate, roasted malt and a BIG peppery spice, no hiding the habanero in this one.  I also get vanilla,  a hint of cinnamon, and some booze.  Great interplay of sweet and spicy.  Awesome aroma.  
T: Initially very sweet, with chocolate syrup and rich chocolate fudge notes.  Significant vanilla characters, dark fruits reminiscent of chocolate covered cherries, and roasted malt flavors which come out as I progress through the drink.  Spice starts to come out about halfway through the glass, but the habanero notes are certainly not as strong on the tongue as they were on the nose, and the spice is more of a generic lingering bite, although it continues to build with each sip and reaches a rather noticeable (but quite pleasant) level by the end of the drink.  A touch of booze comes out on the finish. Really quite complex and delicious.  Initially borders on cloyingly sweet, reminiscent of Dark Lord, but fortunately the spice and alcohol presence work well to balance this out.  Very well done. 
M/D: Incredibly smooth and succulent. On the fuller side of medium bodied, but could be a touch thicker and chewier on the palate.  Low carbonation, but certainly not flat, and personally I prefer a very low degree of carbonation in my imperial stouts, so this works well for me.  Leaves the lips feeling sticky.  The drinkability on this one is scary, I literally can't wait to take the next sip, and this large glass disappeared in no time. 
O: Worth the hype for me.  I loved this offering.  I'm so glad a keg popped up at a growler station, completely out of the blue.  I'll definitely be seeking this out if it is brewed again.  Very unique, and just plain delicious.  I love Westbrook more and more with each beer of theres that I try.  Cheers to you guys for a job well done.   2,132 characterszac16125, Jul 25, 2012

Pours black with only hints of dark brown at the edges. A light brown head has limited duration. 
The aroma features coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, a modicum of spicy hops and some dark malt. Some alcohol comes out with warming. The taste features these flavors, but has a very dynamic nature: A vanilla-tinged sweet spike up front fades into a sweet/bitter/sour finish, with the bitter component, although mild, winning out. A peppery/spicy/cinnamon aspect appears mid-taste and becomes far more noticeable with repeated sipping. Although made with fresh habanero peppers, this beer only produces a very mild burn. Dark fruit in the aroma re-emerge towards the finish. 
M: full body; light carbonation; alcohol warming. 
O: A rich, complex and unusual stout worth seeking out, although not so great as to make me lust for more.

M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.
D - Very nicely done, though the draft version that I had a few months ago was more enjoyable and complex. This works well but seems to have soured just a touch and lost the best of what it was when first brewed. 765 charactersnickfl, Jul 13, 2012

A: Pours black with a massive, four-finger foamy head - the bottle opened with a huge PFFFFTTTT... ruh roh; the dark brown head leaves some dots of lace.
S: Sweet malts; a little thin on the nose; maybe some dark chocolate and leafy hops.
T: Roasty coffee malts; chocolate; dessert-like sweetness and toasty / roast; cocoa.
M: Full; high carbonation; smooth, yet so big; heat from the habañeros builds over time.
O: Thought this one was much better on draft at Westbrook when they released it several months ago; also, much better at Brewvival (although that might have been the Coffee Cake version); something funny about the bottled version that didn’t go as well as the other times I’d had it.

Looks the part, black and thick. Hints of spice and chocolate... the spice is obscure to my palate though and I wouldn't know about the pepper part if I didn't know. I don't feel any heat :-/
Slight stout tartness that puts me off in almost every stout I drink, but there's a good presence of roast. Medium body, full carbonation. It's certainly a well made, above average imperial stout. However, I don't get the hype behind this one. Or I just had my hate on this particular evening. 576 characterstewaris, Jun 21, 2012

Score: 92
2012 vintage bottle served in a Surly Darkness snifter and enjoyed on 04/25/12.
Appearance: This beer is a jet black vacuum of light. Pours four fingers of foamy mocha head. Amazing lacing, very good retention. This is an absolutely gorgeous looking imperial stout. 5/5
Smell: Doughy vanilla and lots of fudge. Cocoa and cinnamon. Light cherry and a mild spicy pepper aroma too. Smells like a fluffy vanilla-chocolate cake. Very inviting. 4.5/5
Taste: Sadly, the taste is not quite as good as the aroma led on. Lots of cinnamon throughout. Fudge, raw chocolate, a touch of brown sugar and a little bit of roast. There is some pepper heat on the midpalate that grows on the tongue as the beer layers and warms. Modest chocolate covered cherry flavor (done right, unlike the Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Cherry Stout) on the back half with residual chili/pepper spice flavor in the finish. I am enjoying the flavors of this beer more with every sip -- perhaps because of the growing pepper effect giving the cinnamon and cocoa flavors more liveliness. No booziness whatsoever. 4/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, mild carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with growing pepper heat on the tongue. It's not overly spicy, however. Moderately dry finish. 4/5
Overall: This beer is certainly overhyped, and I would absolutely not trade the King Henry-level asking price this beer is commonly commanding on the trading forum in order to get a hold of another. That said, I really did enjoy this beer a lot, and if it was relatively available around here I would certainly buy another bottle at the price. Hopefully this one will be brewed again in the future.
Recommendation: Spicy averse people (those who can't even consume the pickled jalapenos at Subway) should avoid this one. Others should seek this one out -- but not at the price of a King Henry quality beer.
Pairings: Gingerbread cake or horchata.
Cost: $10.99 for a 22 oz botle. 2,150 charactersjegross2, May 05, 2012

A: A small 1/2 finger head rises and falls within 30 seconds on a gentle pour. The head is medium-dark brown in color. The body is pitch black. Islands of bubbles appear across the surface. Long legs line the glass after each sip while dots of lace stick here and there.
S: The nose is surprisingly unassuming. While nothing really stands out as spectacular, there isn't one thing to complain about either. Basic stout nose - light roast, chocolate, fudge and faintest hint of cinnamon.
T: Long, rich, layered notes of chocolate syrup and fudge. A hint of vanilla appears on the mid-palate. About 10 minutes in, the heat begins to make an appearance on the back end of the throat. Very gentle and more of a warming sensation than anything else. Cinnamon doesn't really come through on the palate but the overall flavor is fantastic, and it doesn't even matter.
M: The mouthfeel is unbelievable. So rich. So full. So supple. The carbonation is on the lower side of things - maybe because of the growler serving, or maybe it's just how the beer was designed - but it works really well with the flavor profile.
O: I flat out love this beer. In fact, I'm going to try to recreate it with my next attempt at a stout. 1,374 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Apr 23, 2012

Pours espresso black along with a beautiful and huge head. Very nice lacing that lasts throughout. Aromas of sweet cocoa nibs, vanilla, cinnamon, and pepper. Picked up chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, and definitely can taste the habanero peppers! Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of chile/peppers in my beers so that took a hit in my ratings. Thick and creamy mouthfeel! If not for the peppers, this would have been an amazing beer for me. But I have to take account for the name, "Mexican Cake". Nicely done for that specific style. 646 charactersCuriousMonk, Apr 19, 2012

Pours dark brown, near black with a large tan head. Well carbonated with a retentive head and light lace. Nose isn't very well balanced, alternate whiffs bring forward chocolate, peppers, cinnamon, vanilla, and roast; generally sweet and a little spice. Light bodied, slightly thin, with same flavor profile as nose, but predominantly spicy and chocolately. This and the Farmhouse IPA are my favorite Westbrook beers I've tried. If this was on the shelf in 4 packs locally I'd pick this up, but wouldn't actively seek it out. 554 charactersyourefragile, Apr 19, 2012

This pours a viscous black with a small dark head. On the nose there are chocolate and chili intermixing in a similar way to the other two chili stouts, though here perhaps there is heavier chili. To me that flavor just doesn't tend to sit well with chocolate, though at least with Huna the quality is more evident. In the mouth the roast intermixed with chocolate and chili, with the chili making for a long finish. The body is medium full.
Overall, like the others, I just didn't care for this beer that much. It's closer to Huna in quality than Chocolate Sombrero. If you like chocolate chili stouts, check this out. I won't be again. 754 charactersEricCioe, Apr 14, 2012

Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa, and some subtle chile aromas. Taste is the same but the chile presence is very subtle flavor-wise. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good stout but nothing all that special in my opinion. 497 charactersUCLABrewN84, Apr 09, 2012

4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle thanks to Mike (Thorpe429). Served in a tulip.
A - Medium brown foam settles to a wispy partial cap, thick collar, and spotty lace. Very dark brown body that displays some transparency at the fringes.
S - A mixture of chocolate cake, chiles, cinnamon, and a bit of tar and smoke. Alcohol is quite well-hidden - didn't realize this was in the doube digits.
T - Taste as more cocoa nib and vanilla bean presence, with some light roastiness as well. Less overt cinnamon, and surprisingly little chile heat for a beer made with habanero. Again, minimal booze presence.
M - Smooth medium-full body, pleasant moderate carbonation, lightly sticky finish, and a hint of warmth that could either be from the peppers or the alcohol.
D - Solid brew - reminds me a little bit of Abraxas but isn't quite as intense, although they have similarly well-disguised booze. Worth checking out if you like chile pepper stouts. 917 charactersMasterSki, Apr 07, 2012

Beer is black with a tan head of small and medium bubbles, some lacing, nice retention, high carbonation, a little too carbonated perhaps.
Aroma is nice with cinnamon and allspice.
Beer is light in body and sweet with this nice brown sugar and spice flavor that carries through to the end, the body is nice but perhaps a little thin, overall an interesting beer and I enjoy it. 433 charactersdrabmuh, Apr 06, 2012

a - Pours a very dark brown, almost black color, with one inch of dark tan head and low to moderate carbonation. Looks good.
s - Smells of peppers, sweet chocolate, roasted notes, dark chocolate, spice, and toasted malts. Very nice, some nice hot pepper up front though it doesn't dominate.
t - Tastes of sweet chocolate, vanilla, cocoa, roasted malts, light bitter dark chocolate, cream, toasted malts, peppers, spices. Less spice and pepper then the nose and more sweet chocolate, which I like a lot. A step up from the nose for me.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Smooth and creamy, and easy to drink. No alcohol heat at all; was surprised this one was 10.5% ABV.
o - Overall I thought this was a really good stout. Some nice pepper in the nose, and sweet chocolate in the taste which I loved. Great body and easy to drink as well. Would definitely pick this one up if I saw it on the shelf, and by far the best of the four Westbrook beers we tasted. A good non-BA stout. 1,133 charactersmdfb79, Apr 04, 2012

Pours near black with a tan head. Pretty good retention and some spotty lacing on the way down.
The nose carries a nice mix of chocolate, light spice, roasted malt, sweetness, and a touch of vanilla. Nice blend, for sure. The nose doesn't quite carry all the way over to the flavor and everything isn't quite as integrated as I'd like, though the components are still quite nice. 
Body is medium-full with low-medium carbonation and a good chewiness. No real noticeable alcohol.
This was a really nice beer I was glad to finally try. Thanks, Dan. 607 charactersThorpe429, Apr 03, 2012

A: Pours out a deep, dark, pitch black with about a half finger of dark khaki colored head. The foam settles quickly leaving almost no bubbles anywhere along the beer. The beer is light legs, leaving a thin residue on the glass as it drinks, but there is zero lacing.
S: The nose is roast, toast, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, spicy red pepper, and mild alcohol burn.
T: It starts out sweet and coating with roast, chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. As it moves to the middle the hot pepper really begin to take shape. The heat and spice hits softly but builds much stronger in the finish. The finish is sweet and spicy.
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet, syrupy, and coating as it hits the palate. It's sticky and spicy in the middle, and finishes smooth and coating. The peppers in this beer linger on the palate for quite a bit after the beer is gone.
O: Really nice beer. It's hotter in the back end than I remember. The spice really likes to stick around. It's a solid beer with tons of flavor, but I don't know if I'd want to drink a ton of this beer in the future. It's good, but once is enough for me. 1,159 characterstrxxpaxxs, Apr 02, 2012

Mexican Cake pours a very dark chocolate fudge color. It’s onyx. No light cuts through at all. Very impressive. A dark mocha head tops it off. It only rises to about a finger in height before falling quickly. Lacing was a little sticky, but definitely lighter. The color is impressive nonetheless.
The nose is very impressive. It’s chock full of roasted and chocolate malts. It doesn’t smell all that sweet. Definitely leans more toward bittersweet dark chocolate. Roasted coffee or espresso is relatively strong. It definitely has a bit of a burnt scent, perhaps charred barley. Works nicely with the malt base. Secondary scents include molasses, cocoa, and light anise. I’m not getting much in terms of spiciness. Alcohol is there, but doesn’t seem too strong. 
The flavor simply rocks! It’s full of bittersweet dark chocolate malt flavor. Roasted malts are also noted, but aren’t quite as strong the chocolate variety. It does have a sweeter flavor than I anticipated. It has a bit of a brown sugar flavor. Roasted coffee is strong in flavor and tastes delicious. I’m a big coffee fan, so that works for me. It does taste a little burnt. Maybe it’s the coffee. Maybe charred barley. Molasses, anise, and a little vanilla are all secondary. There’s a light spicy quality to it, but it’s very subtle. It’s quite deep and complex. Very flavorful. Alcohol is there, but really doesn’t come through that strong. It’s not warm or hot. Finishes chocolaty, sweet, and roasty.
Mexican Cake has a body that leans toward full. It’s very svelte and smooth. Carbonation is light and very soft. This stuff goes down super easy in spite of its double digit abv. I’m sharing this small growler, but probably could’ve tackled it alone. It’d be tempting. It’s that good.
Westbrook Brewing Co. has a really nice beer in Mexican Cake. It’s very flavorful and impressive. The only qualm I really have is that there isn’t much of a spicy presence. I’m not getting anything that strongly suggests cinnamon or habanero pepper. Perhaps that’s a good thing. It sure is a fine tasting beer. Find some if you can. Thanks a ton, Dan! 2,198 charactersprototypic, Apr 01, 2012

The beer is dark brown, nearing black, with a quarter inch of oily, beige head. The aroma offers roast, cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla. The flavor brings notes of Kahlua, booze, chocolate, burned roasted malt. Nice flavor, but I like the aroma even better. Even without the title, I definitely get notes of flan. Sweet, but not too. Overall, very enjoyable. I would definitely have this again. 422 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 31, 2012

A: Black with a thick, tan head
S: Sweet, thick aroma with chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, with a note of tart fruit. The tartness is just a bit overdone in my opinion and keeps it from a perfect score
T: Rich, chocolate start leveling to vanilla and cinnamon, finishing with a lingering spice
M: Full-bodied feel. It's the spice at the end that sets this beer apart for me. A perfect heat that holds until the next sip, but doesn't overwhelm
O: One of the top 2-3 beers I've tasted. Feels like an imperial stout should - rich and full-bodied, but very complex in it's taste. The spice finish is perfectly executed. It's dessert all by itself. Made me want to start writing about beer. I hope all of you get to try this beer 809 charactersScruggers, Mar 13, 2012

A: Pours pitch black with a one finger tan/brown head on top. Good retention, reducing slowly to a nice cap that stayed around for a while. Thin lacing forms all around the glass. 
S: Chocolate, a little bit of roast malt, some vanilla, a little but if cinnamon, and a slight hint of peppers. There is a little bit of cream too. 
T: Nice and chocolaty upfront with some nice vanilla in the middle. There is some roasty malt, a hint of dark fruit, and a little bit of molasses. The chilis come out after swallowing, I feel a little heat (not burn) on the roof of my mouth and in my cheeks. 
M: Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Drinks very smooth, no sign of 10.5%. 
O: A very solid imperial stout, great mouthful and flavors for a non-barrel aged beer. 822 charactersmdaschaf, Mar 13, 2012

A - Nice opaque black with a slightly darker than tan head. Head lingers and lingers.
S - It's...fine. I was really hoping of a blast of vanilla cinnamon chili goodness. Mostly chocolate with some spice. I was expecting more.
T - Very, very nice. The majority of the flavor comes from the chocolate and chili. Great chili flavor, in fact. A bit of vanilla to compliment those flavors. They all mix very well. Would have been better if the vanilla could have stood out more.
M - This drinks great. It has the perfect amount of heat, and is right in the ballpark of how an imperial stout should feel on the tongue. The flavors linger.
O - A really solid beer. Really glad I got to have this once. It may not have been fair to put it up against rHunahpu, which I absolutely love. But it did stand out in a few areas. 949 charactersraveskdr, Mar 04, 2012

Pours midnight black with about 1 finger cappucino head that recedes quickly. Small spots of lacing left intermittently. A nice looking stout. 
Smells awesome. Chocolate, roasty malts, woodsy vanilla and peppers. They all come to the front. I kept going back to enjoy the ever changing array of aromas. 
Outstanding complex flavor. Dark bittersweet chocolate leads and remains throughout. Burnt malts, dark fruits, vanilla and wood follow- all playing major roles with that ever present chocolate. Very slight chilli burn towards the finish. Like most imperial stouts, things get so much better as it warms. All those intense flavors completely cover the 10.5% abv. 
Nice creamy thick feel. The light carbonation works very well for the style. The tiny bubbles really help the tastes tingle on the tongue. 
Wow! I should have bought alot more of this. A very well crafted and complex stout that goes down easily. This is my first experience with Westbrook Brewing- I'll have to keep an eye on them to see what their future brings. If you like big stouts, this one is worth a try. I'm really looking forward to seeing how this developes over the next 12-18 months.  1,295 charactersThickNStout, Feb 18, 2012

4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Very happy to see this on tap at "Closed for Business" in Charleston.
This is a thick black beer. Very opaque. Small deep tan head. Looks malevolent.
Nose is cinnamon and roasty malts and chocolate. Very slight booze.
Taste is complex and fantastic. Strong cocoa nibs and vanilla beans. Deep toasted malts. The jalepeno comes in slightly on the end - not too much, just a nice subtle hint of lingering spice. Masterfully done and a welcome change from some chili beers that whap you in the face with astringent spice.
Very good mouthfeel, this is a stout and shows it.
Overall a great beer. Strong but well-woven flavors. I had not previously heard of this brewery, but would love to try more stuff from them. 714 charactersshivtim, Feb 14, 2012

4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Having had a few Mexican Cakes on draft (At World of Beer in Columbia) I figured I'd check in and update my score a bit.
Fresh draft put into a smallish goblet.
The draft version of Mexican Cake seems to differ in the following ways from my previous review:
A. Longer head retention, and more of it. Some active carbonation. A fine deep red / tan head atop a nearly jet black beer.
S / T. The carbonation level in the beer is vastly improved over the bottle I had, which makes the aroma a little more lively and the taste a great deal less cloyingly sweet. The beer does seem less sweet on draft, and several people at my table who have tried both bottle and draft agreed. The heat and spice balance seems exactly the same.
M. Improved, and is fuller, more lively and less deadening with the benefits that the C02 brings. 
Score adjusted accordingly. Quite enjoyable this go around. Go find you some. 906 characterskkipple, Feb 08, 2012
4.36/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a black color and a thick, impenetrable consistency. There was a big, tan-colored, long-lasting head. Excellent lacing. A great-looking stout.
S: A sharp aroma, with spices, chocolate and peppers coming through.
T: Tasted of malt, chocolate, some cinnamon, a little coffee, a burnt quality, and chili peppers in the finish. This final ingredient will probably polarize a lot of people who drink this beer, but I think it somehow works. A complex and interesting flavor.
M: A well-carbonated beer with a slick finish. Full-bodied.
O: Not your typical stout, that's for sure, but bold, unusual and certainly worth a try. 667 charactersavalon07, Feb 08, 2012
4.05/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From a 32oz growler filled at Charlston Beer Exchange.
Thick black pour with brown around the edges. Just a small ring and a few bubbles of Darker tan.
Aroma, I get a lot of camelly malt, vanilla and molasses. There is some spice like cinnamon, light pepper. A small amount of alcohol presence as well. In all I thought this was a tad subdued.
Taste, It's pretty sweet up front, vanilla and molasses. Chocolate, dark choc, cocoa, gets dryer as you go. The pepper just barely peeks through in the roast at the end. There are a lot of nice flavors that peek through and work well together.
This is probably a 4.25, but the potential is there so I'll give it the nudge.
Body is to the right of medium, pretty think and coating. Enough carbonation, maybe could use a tinge more, a nice fine carbonation could add some creaminess, but the dry leaning finish helps with the sweetness as well. Drinks very very easy to the point where you might question that abv.
Was ready to give 4.5s and the such, but just not quite there yet. It is very good however, as most of the Westbrook brews I've had are. At the creative end of the spectrum and I'm just not quite sure what to think of these Hunaphu type brews. Have 2 bottles as well, we'll see what happens...
This definetely isn't going to be a beer everyone thinks is world class, yet. 1,332 charactersBung, Feb 08, 2012

4.63/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 32oz growler courtesy of Growlers in Hilton Head, SC.
Appearance is as you would expect from an imperial stout, very dark and thick with about an inch of tan head, a beautiful thing.
Smell is very nice as you get a little bit of the pepper, cocoa and vanilla. I am not really picking up any of the cinnamon but I am getting a good bit of alcohol.
Taste is out of this world, fantastic! I was worried when I smelled the alcohol but it really is undetectable in this upon drinking. You get tons of cocoa and vanilla with just the smallest hit of the cinnamon and pepper. Everything balances out so well, that it is very easy to drink.
The mouthfeel is velvety smooth and has the perfect amount of carbonation. It goes down too easy.
After drinking this beer I am sad that I didn't pick up any of the 22oz bottles that were for sale. What a great beer, I really hope this makes in to the regular rotation for Westbrook or at least comes out every year for their anniversary. 990 charactersrjknyy, Feb 05, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got to try this from one of my neighbors that brings over beer! We poured it into some port wine snifters, at a little above white wine temperature.
It pours jet black with lots of loose tan head and leaves streaks all over the glass. It is pretty thick.
The smell is overwhelmed by fresh cinnamon rolls, chocolate, and hot peppers. It smells like it is going to be a bit spicy.
The flavor is incredible. It is sweet, but not cloying- more like rich velvety chocolate, accompanied by cinnamon rolls and smooth vanilla. There is the slightest hint of pepper at the end, but it is very welcomed to balance the other flavors. This reminds me of a marble chocolate cake that my grandmother used to bake with peanut butter stuffed carmelized peppers, exceptional balance.
The slight carbonation was consistent throughout and it sits pretty heavy. 
I wouldn't drink more than 1 throughout an evening, but I cannot think of a better way to end a nice time with friends. It was much better than the Cigar City Hunahpu's we compared it to. 1,035 charactersrachelerin, Feb 03, 2012

3.84/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bomber poured into an oversized snifter. In spite of the widemouthed glassware, a thick cap of dark tan foam stubbornly sticks atop the dark body. Sticky and splotchy lacing all over the place. 
The habaneros somewhat overwhelm the spices and chocolate in the nose (although a healthy roastiness is quite pleasant). Tasty stuff, though. The habaneros kick into high gear in the finish; before that, the cinnamon, vanilla and cocoa nibs are quite potent. Velvety, chocolatey and plenty roasty. Espresso shows up in the aftertaste after the peppers finally calm down. I'm digging this stuff. I'm curious about how it would age, but it's pretty damned good now, and I suspect drinking it fresh may be the best way to enjoy the the pepper presence. Kinda reminds me of a Mexican twist on a pecan pie I made a while back. 817 charactersPDXHops, Feb 02, 2012
4.76/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to GBX! Poured at around 55* into a chalice. Much better once it warms, let it get to or above 60* before tasting, it really opens up in a great way! 
Pours black with dark mocha head. Very viscous and great lacing.
Nose is subdued, but some chipotle pepper spice, imported chocolate, sugar cane, cinnamon coated dipped peppers, vanilla and cocoa. 
Taste is sweet chocolate, slight pepper spice, graham crackers, light roast and deep french vanilla. Amazing.
Medium body with great, light carbonation. Fantastic balance.
- One of the highlights of the year and one of the best I've had. Ever.- It's that good 624 charactersNetdigger2, Feb 01, 2012
