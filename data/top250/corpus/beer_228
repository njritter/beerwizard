3.84/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75I was expecting a darker beer. Seems I've been absent from good German beer for far too long. Saw this beer in the lineup at my favourite watering hole in Hamilton (The Brain on James St. N) and grabbed a pint tastefully served in a branded weizen glass.
Look: Cloudy pale orange with a creamy foam head from the draft pour.
Smell: Citrus smells like orange zest and bready malt nose.
Taste: More of the orange zest with biscuit malt coming through.
Overall: A very solid wheat beer that will be oh so enjoyable in the hot summer months to come. 545 characters-steve-, Jun 10, 2017

Typical cloudy body is seen. The smell is the banana up front with some yeastiness and graininess. The taste is sweet with previously mentioned flavors combined decently. The palate is light to medium with a decent creaminess all around. Overall, this is a great hefeweizen and good for me. 467 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 04, 2017

Smooth with low carbonation and its yeast being somewhat on the milder sweet side. Funny though that the taste of its head reminded me of sweet canned corn...
Altogether a very pleasant, easy to drink hefeweizen. Had two in a row on tap at a steak parlor in Vienna, AT. 375 charactersmonkist, May 30, 2017

Very hazy bright golden color with a thick head, high carbonation. Smells incredibly citrusy, with the smell of orange, banana, and pineapple masking my nose. Has a very lovely yeasty taste but also very sweet light taste as well; there's also a lot of different other fruity flavors and spices too. 
Outstanding. 346 charactersDr_Gonzo, May 23, 2017

S -- Fruity yeast esters (mostly banana), clove, pepper, nutmeg, pilsner malts, wheat, and a little lemon
T -- Taste largely follows the nose. Quite similar to Allagash White, but with a much more pleasant spiciness and overall better flavor balance
F -- Refreshing, quaffable, and flavorful. Well carbonated, but not overly fizzy
O -- My favorite wheat beer to date, much more flavorful and well-balanced than most. Pretty good value at $12/6-pack

S: Spicy and has that distinctive German yeast strain smell (at least I think it's the yeast).
T: Of course has the banana and clove notes, but not as much as I expected. Some lemon as well. Some grain qualities, but not really sweet like malt can sometimes be. Very clean, somewhat dry finish.
F: Fairly light body and carbonation. Very smooth and almost too easy to drink.
O: I think the best word to describe this beer is balance. All the flavors work well together and nothing dominates. So easy to drink I wish I had bought a six pack of this instead of a single. I may have to go back to get more. 659 charactersABabbidge, May 12, 2017

I'm doing this short review largely for my own records so if you're looking for Hefe advice, you'll need to look elsewhere.  That said, as a lover of IPAs & stouts, I would gladly enjoy one of these on a hot day if it were offered, but I won't likely go out of my way to get one. 437 charactersJesterr44, Apr 27, 2017
3.5/5  rDev -20.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Being completely honest, I'm being generous with my numbers above owing to the beer's reputation and my own style preferences and biases.  I used to love wheat beers before my IPA and imperial stout days; now, everything else seems to fall short.  Additionally, I drank this particular beer immediately after Stone Enjoy By DIPA, which provided a more immediate contrast.
It was beautiful to look at - cloudy and golden with a huge head with good retention and lots of bubbles rising.  Aroma is of funky overripe banana, wheat, yeast, lemon, spice.  Taste is similar and very wheaty.  A tiny bit of sweetness, sourness, and bitterness all balanced together all the way through the finish.  There was also a note of artificial lemon juice that I did not enjoy.  
I appreciate that it is well crafted but it is not my cup of tea these days so maybe I shouldn't be reviewing it in the first place.  I do recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys wheaty beers. 955 charactersPlinyMeNow, Apr 26, 2017

There are many sticky spots of lacing left on the glass. Absolutely gorgeous.
The smell is excellent. Banana and clove are most apparent with peppery spice, bubblegum and wheat.
Taste is the same. The banana flavor comes on strong at the beginning, but is swept aside by clove and pepper on the finish.
Feel is medium bodied and very smooth. I wish there was a bit more carbonation.
Overall a great hefeweizen. Very flavorful, smooth and easy drinking. Definitely worth the price of admission and a must try for any fan of the style. 698 charactersCNoj012, Mar 26, 2017

I love Helles Lager, but tried the veal sausage with Hefeweiss.  It was a marriage made in heaven. I discovered Weihenstephaner back in the States and also found their Helles Lager. What a pour! Yellow and cloudy with an absolute thick creamy head. The taste is a mixture of banana and cloves and hangs in there for every swallow. It is actually GREAT! Added to their Helles Lager these beers are my staples. I don't get out often anymore, but these are staples at home. No doubt that this brewery really knows its stuff! 595 characterstigeroutlaw, Mar 25, 2017

Went superbly with my pasta; a beer that is as good as beer gets. 282 charactersLamar, Mar 15, 2017

3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours with a large but very quickly dissipating head.  Not much lacing.  Straw-colored and cloudy.
Aromas of esters very forward and prominent--banana and citrus as expected, and very pleasing.  Bubblegum sweetness in the background.  Very little if any phenolic spice.  Very little yeast.  Rather subdued overall, but still a fine aroma.
Tastes much like the aroma in the same order of prominence, with the esters perhaps overpowering the other aspects.  Banana and gingerbread flavors immediately come to mind, with a touch of pepper in the aftertaste.  Not sickly sweet, but perhaps a bit sweeter than expected.
The mouthfeel is remarkably full-bodied, and even slick, but with a nice crisp finish, doubtless from strong carbonation.
Overall a fine brew that I will likely try again for a re-rate, just in case I got an "old" bottle.  I like wheat beers, including others by this brewer, but was somewhat disappointed in what others have found to be the "paragon" of the style.  This one checks all of the boxes for a Hefe, but seemed out of balance, with too much emphasis on the sweetness, and not enough yeast and spice. 1,130 charactersMindcrime1000, Jan 21, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25I got this beer at my local super market the label caught my eye. "Weihenstephaner Worlds Oldest Brewery" had a nice ring to it. I poured the beer into a 24oz glass. Pours with a big head that takes some time to dissipate. In my glass, the beer has a dark yellow top. The bottom of the glass seems to be a lighter yellow. It is a nice, "eye catchy" flow. The beer smells very fruity. I can smell very sweet fruit like Bananas and apples, as well as floral hops. It's an overall very pleasant smell. The taste is very different. I have never tasted a beer that tastes quite like this. It tastes very fruity and a little dry. I can defiantly taste the dryness of bread and corn. The beer is also very sweet with a slight barley noticeably banana taste. It also has a nice slight hint of lemon. The taste really blends together as you swallow it. Reminds me of a beer that would be marketed as a  "sumer Ale." It kind of reminded me of a better version of AtWaters, "Dirty Blonde." Overall, it is something that is very different. I would buy it again, I liked it. 1,061 charactersNorthernMichiganLogan, Dec 19, 2016

S- Lots of fermentation to me. Haven't had much of this style, but I get strong strong notes of yeast, banana, and clove. Powerful smelling beer that is almost overwhelmed by the scent of yeast.
T-Much sweeter than expected at first, then once I continued to sip it became less and less sweet and more mellow and yeasty. I get notes of banana in this beer, also clove. Very pleasant and wonderfully put together.
MF- mellow and slight carbonation that makes for a very well balanced and drinkable beer.
O- Well crafted and neatly balanced beer. A pure joy to drink for a very likable price range. Will seek out again. 654 charactersJacobusFavier23, Dec 12, 2016

Too much yeast and not enough clove/bubblegum for my tastes. I'd choose my local Hef champ (Live Oak) over this any day. Maybe its just that it isn't as good in a 6-pack? 278 charactersmpk_tx, Nov 23, 2016

Nose of wheat, banana, and mild clove
Taste follows, with a fantastic balance of the standard wheat beer flavors. Wheaty, but also containing smooth fruit presences.
Mouth is very refreshing.
A brewery does not operate a millennium without doing something right, and Weihenstephaner has produced platonic ideal of a wheat beer in this one. 427 charactersDinglehacker, Nov 03, 2016

Appearance: Hazy straw yellow with a 1-finger creamy head that lingers for a few minutes.
Smell: Strong smell of biscuit, banana and clove spiciness.
Taste: Wheat bread (obviously), some banana and spiciness, with a persistent biscuit-like taste. No bitterness present at all.
Feel: Lighter carbonation than many other wheat beers I've had, which is nice. Smooth in the mouth, with just the right amount of fizz.
Overall: A treat to drink. It's easy to see why this is one of the best wheat beers in the world. Refreshing and tasty, and it goes down easy. 609 charactersbonns42, Oct 08, 2016

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 1 pint 0.9 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, there is no "best by" date that I can find.
APPEARANCE:  pours a hazy, straw color with one-finger white head that dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is heavy lacing on the glass, lighter carbonation.
SMELL:  bread, banana and cloves.
TASTE:  the taste follows the nose precisely, bread, banana and clove, the taste intensified/improved as the beer warmed, this style relies more on the yeast and less on the hops for it's flavor.
PALATE:  medium body and somewhat creamy.
OVERALL:  I enjoy this style and this is probably going to be hard to beat, these guys have been making this beer a long time and frankly have perfected it, I will buy this again and would recommend to everyone who enjoys the style. 810 charactersHoppyBastard, Oct 08, 2016

Looks hazy golden. A nice head that quickly dissipated however.
Smells like what you would expect.. yeasty, subtle banana, spice, a bit tangy.
Tastes fantastic. Sharp initially then smooths out letting the yeast, and banana/clove flavors come into play leaving a lingering taste I describe as wheat beer for lack of a better term. 
Feel is very good, a bit sharp and drying on the finish, Smooth and very drinkable.
Great beer! 495 charactersLagerlivesmatter, Sep 29, 2016

3.75/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Really dug the appearance on this one, benchmark for style kind of stuff.  Bright yellow, chunky cloudiness, pristine 3/4" white head.   Aroma gives you those health food store wheatgrass citrusy lemon precursors on top of grain.
All of that comes out in the taste.  Pretty full bodied mouthfeel kind of stuff.  The format 500ml is a little expensive compared to 12oz offerings, but this is some pretty good benchmark for the hefeweizen style.  The yeast isnt overly banana or spice rack laden either. 502 charactersrodbeermunch, Sep 16, 2016

On the palate the flavor of banana and clove and a back note of bubble gum came through especially as the beer warmed while I was drinking it. It had a wonderful mouthfeel and was crisp without being overly dry. For the full experience I suggest taking out of your fridge and letting it stand 10-15 minutes before drinking it.

Smell: Pineapple, banana, wheat. Some notes of pepper and spice, but the fruity esters dominate in a lovely way. 
Taste: Banana and bubble gum. What you'd expect of a hefe.
Feel: Very clean and smooth on the palate.
Overall: Easily one of the best of the style I've ever had. I would offer this up to anyone looking for a proper representation of the style. 595 charactersHunter, Aug 26, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look: Pours a hazy muted orange-yellow color with a dense two finger head that's made up of lots of effervescent tiny pinhole sized bubbles.
Smell: I'm getting heady aromas of banana, rosemary, bitter orange and lemon rind, marjoram and mild gingerbread on the nose.
Taste: Phenomenal. Initially it starts off with a spicy yeasty flavor on the tongue that's reminiscent of banana, graham cracker and clove. I taste notes of vanilla wafer cookies and savory apple strudel mid palate. It finishes off on a slightly bitter dry floral note with hints of honey. Perfectly balanced.
Feel: Light-medium body. Bubbly, crisp, refreshing and flavorsome. Starts off spicy and sweet but finishes dry and slightly bitter so as not to become cloying. The yeast adds a little roughness and weight to the feel and it works really well.
Overall: I'm not the biggest fan of Hefeweizens but this beer has shown me the light. My only negative criticism is that it  doesn't lace the glass very well, but seriously who cares when you have a beer that tastes this good? 1,050 charactersBloodSoakedAleMug, Aug 06, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25This is one of the prettiest beers to look at. Big foamy head and beautiful yellow-orange gold color, lots of carbonation. Smells very spicy and fruity, slightly fermented fruit, very sweet. Tastes crisp and also very spicy, cloves, and with some subtle fruitiness that isn't as strong as I think some people make it sound. This is a good thing, as I prefer the wheaty, honey drizzled bready flavors over sweet fruit. Feels super crisp and light, very refreshing and drinkable. Perfect for a warm, sunny day. Overall this is a veritable classic, and certainly deserves its acclaim. 581 charactersKubishark, Jul 30, 2016

I'm not gonna go into detail but the taste is phenomenal, it's got all those qualities that I enjoy in pilsners but also the smoothness of a wheatbeer, I also love that sour aftertaste. It might just be my new goto brand. 426 charactersjanic, Jul 27, 2016

Pours a cloudy glowing burnt yellow with a fluffy creamy eggshell white head that sticks around leaving great thick retention and very sticky lacing. The aromas have lots of banana and cloves. Hints of bubblegum. The yeast does its thing. The flavors follow the nose perfectly. The flavors are extremely clean. More banana and cloves with some other subtle spice notes in the mix. More bubblegum. Subtle hints of citrus. The yeast blends well with everything. Solid malt backbone. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed. Mouthfeel is great. It's light with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and fluffy. Too smooth and easy to drink. 
This beer is a classic. It's extremely refreshing and perfect for the warm weather, or anytime for that matter. The craftsmanship is very impressive. Highly recommended. 834 charactersBB1313, Jul 22, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Been wanting to try this one for a while.  The regular version of James Rolfe (the angry video game nerd)'s favorite beer.  I heard many good things about it, had to give this one a try.  Got a case from Market District for $12, which was a more than reasonable price.  Doing this review on the spot.
Poured into a tall glass, its very pure looking.  Faint yellow, massive head, very carbonated.  The head lingers a long while.  The first sip burns.  This is a very carbonated beer.   The flavor is great upon first impressions, no bitter beer taste, virtually no hops presence.  You know its a wheat beer from drinking it.  I have heard others say they got hints of bubblegum and banana from this?  Not me.  Its citrusy, its wheaty, its good.  But I would definitely not say its sweet.  Its an excellent sipping beer on a warm summer night.
Look:  Quite beautiful.  Looks like the perfect beer should look.  Massive head, bubbly, beautiful yellow color.
Smell:  citrusy, pure, literally can smell the history behind the beer.  Its no surprise this stuff has been around for so long.
Taste:  Delish.  An outstanding beer taste.  Not bitter one bit.  Some citrus hints underneath the carbonation (which assaults the tongue) and a great finish which leaves you begging for more.
Feel:  Ouch.  Burning sensation from the carbonation which I find to be stimulating.  I am used to belgian ales.  Anyone that drinks bottle conditioned trappist ales are used to this feeling.  I expect it and look forward to it.
Overall:  Outstanding beer.  Its the best of all worlds, though I am a belgian ale/trappist ale kind of guy, and also love pumpkin ales, this is probably my go-to beer now if I am not forking over all my money for expensive trappist ales or when pumpkin ale is out of season.  This is for the serious beer drinker who drinks for the appreciation of a fine brew.  Put down the Budweiser and give this a try, you won't regret it. 1,939 characterstheamericanpsycho79, Jul 12, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Served in a Paulaner hefeweizen glass, it pours a hazy, solid yet brilliant orange of a yellow hue. It forms a three-finger foamy and creamy head with seemingly everlasting retention. 
A bevy of bubbles can be seen going to the surface from the very bottom of the glass, nurturing the head of the beer. 
This beer gives a nice lacing. 
Lots of banana, mild bubblegum, wheat malts, very strong biscuit, honey, citrus and clove. Assertive and enticing bouquet.
Excellently rounded and subtle. 
Upfront the expressive carbonation is felt, and it accompanies the flavor all throughout. 
Perfect balance, the sweet notes and the hoppy bitterness are equally present in that uniform yet complex flavor that the carbonation unveils. 
Notes of overripe apple, pineapple, banana, biscuit, wheat malts, hay, honey and clove.
The aftertaste is long and slightly sweeter, that crispness dissipates. 
Medium to full body, slightly silky and very refreshing. 
The subtleties and sophistication of this beer's flavor speak for themselves. 
World class beer for sure. 1,054 charactersdavidperez, Jul 09, 2016

Look - Nice amber looking beer, reminds me of that girl in highschool's hair that refused to date me
Smell - a wheaty, bready smell, remind me of that girl in college who wouldn't go out with me either
Taste - Citrus, clove, bannana kinda tastes like the mouth of that girl i made out with on New Years, whose calls i won't return
Feel- Honestly kind of average, not my cup of tea. I didn't find any of the elements of this beer to be particularly special or fetching. I now know how those girls felt about me. 551 characters0_0, Jul 08, 2016

T: Taste follows the nose. Citrus flavors come first, clove follows, with light bubblegum flavor and banana subtly coming through in a sophisticated way. All perfectly balanced.
M: Feels light-to-medium bodied. Very smooth and crisp, with perfect amount of carbonation in the mouth.
O: Very refreshing and drinkable, with gentle velvety structure. I would call it a very sophisticated Hefeweizen. Variety of notes are delivered without allowing any of them to be too prevalent, but rather come together in a very nice balance. 838 charactersHefeweizenLover, Jun 20, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Look: Pours a frosty straw color. The head is thick and white, and retains moderate to strong. A nice thin ring of foam sits on top of my beer after a few sips, with any lacing kicked up during the sip sinking back into the ring. 
Aroma: Very delightful and playful with the quintessential notes of banana and clove playing a major role. A little Belgian yeast and pollen notes round it out nicely. It reminds me of summer nights spent in the farm fields here in the Midwest. 
Taste: A good variety of notes are delivered, and all in balance. Those notes include banana, clove, Belgian spices, yeast, and a hint of pollen/flower. There are complexities that can be sniffed and sipped out, and yet it is just a plain ol' good beer to drink on a hot/warm day. An aftertaste leaves some Belgian yeast and spice on the palate between sips. 
Mouth feel: It's well done, with a smooth, velvety texture, and a medium thickness consistency. It certainly keeps it fun and lively to drink. 
Overall: This is a beer for any day drinking. The complexities in the aroma and flavor mean it can be sipped and savored or put down in under 60 at a barbecue. Very tasty and fun to drink.

Taste is superb with immediate presence of banana and clove, but with a slight wheat/bread taste as well. Decent carbonation, refreshing, and perfectly balanced flavors for this style. Hands down my favorite Hefeweizen I have ever had. 415 charactersThe_Atom, Jun 14, 2016

The smell is mainly of wheat, but there is also a slight hint of banana as well. The body is light, but there is a nice full wheat and bready malt flavor and a little yeastiness as well. There is actually less fruit and spice flavor than I would have guessed with this one. There is a faint banana flavor in the aftertaste and a little bit of spiciness that lingers on the tongue, but that is about it. The finish is very crisp and a little bit dry. This is much more subdued than the dunkel. This is really an awesomely refreshing beer for a summer day. Everything here is really solidly done, but unpretentious like most German beers. I personally like the dunkel better because it’s slightly heavier and has a little more bold and complex flavors, but I could see how others might like this one better as well. 909 charactersBierliebhaber3, Jun 12, 2016

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I live in England, UK. I will never forget the first time I drank this beer.
It was a guest draught at 'The Firefly' on Lowesmoor in Worcester.
The barman recommended it.
Came in a tall Weihenstephaner glass taken from the freezer.
Word's cannot really describe and sum up what I want to say about this world class beer.
It wasn't on tap very long and I tried to source the bottled (if any) variety. Some Sainsbury's in the UK stock it (Redditch one of them) and Ocado will deliver but it's quite a rarity on sale here.
I have tried many wheat beers over the years but this is heaven in a bottle.
A masterclass from Weihenstephaner. 639 charactersAnthony_Humphreys, Jun 06, 2016

The look for starters is amazing a golden-honeyish hue is beautiful and the head that forms in the glass, whether it be from a bottle or on draught is perfect everytime. The smell is delicious, you get lemon, banana, wheat and i'd even go as far as to mention a hint of hazelnut. Just to die for. The taste is EPIC!!!!! Smooth, mellow, just the perfect combination of wheat, barley, hops, water and yeast. Yes, the perfect beer in my opinion. 
If you see this on draught, in a bottle. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY ONE!!! You won't regret it. I guarantee it. 606 charactersFrankMeister, May 11, 2016

A - Pours a golden, honey color with a full, 3 finger head. Incredible head retention that never fully goes away. 
S -  Powerful and to the point. Banana and cloves. Not much else to say aside from an incredible aroma; no hidden subtleties. 
T - The taste follows perfectly in line with the aroma. Optimal blend of bitterness and sweetness, leaving a lingering, banana aftertaste. Perfect match for my personal tastes.
M - Crisp, incredibly smooth and drinkable with the perfect amount of carbonation. Medium - full bodied beer.
O - As close to perfect a beer you'll find. As a big fan of hefeweizen's, I was estatic to finally get a hold of this beer. My expectations were well surpassed. From the moment you start pouring and as the aromas dissipate in the air around you; to the last sip, this beer will not let you down. Only downside - it's now going to be hard to find something that'll compare. Will be stocking the fridge. 1,068 charactersZaktcc, May 11, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance:  Pours a light  honey  color with the haze one would expect from a Hefe Weissbier.  Shimmering gold in the glass.  Brilliant fine textured cap with good lacing.
Aroma:  Clove accented spices with ripe yellow fruit undertones.  No noticeable hop presence.
Taste:  Very gentle in a sophisticated way.  This beer displays good manners.  Not as full flavored as I've experienced in the past which could be due to it's age.  Bottling date is 20 OCT 15 and it certainly wasn't kept under refrigeration since then.  Perhaps not since it left the Brewery.  Some other subdued flavors of banana and/or something similar but not enough to identify let alone quantify.
Overall:  I cannot rate this based on what it may have been, only what it is.  I bought it for the tasting and figured it would still be ok and it's just that, ok.  In the past I've had other Bavarian Hefes that were much fresher and were quite frankly much better.  This one seemed like a slightly deflated balloon. 989 charactersSquire123, May 07, 2016

It pours a cloudy, golden color with an enormous, fluffy, egg-white head and thick lacing. It's a beautiful pour. It smells of cloves, banana, lemon, and yeast. What a delicious beer! It is  just the right blend of sweet and tart. The clove taste is huge but there is also some sweet banana and citrus. I think it improves as it warms in the glass.  It has a nice, creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, and it's ABV of 5.4% is barely noticeable. Overall, this is clearly one of the finest examples of Hefeweizen brewed in the world.  It is equally appropriate accompanying a good meal (preferably German) or for casual drinking. Sehr gut! 692 charactersMacMalt, May 07, 2016

Good lacing lingers. Also the distinctiveness of the scent and flavor. There's a reason this is such a time-tested beer.
L - cloudy gold with streaming small bubbles, rich white head
S - sniff hard and this tingles the nostrils with spice; the quintessential clove and I'd say not too overwhelming on the banana. Some citrus/lemon detected.
T - sweetness and spice. Zesty and enjoyable. 
F - tongue-tingling bubbles
O - excellent. I had this side-by-side with Paulaner Hefe-Weizen and both are great. Go to Paulaner, I think, for even more unbelievable head, though this one might have the slightly zippier taste. Again, both great. 774 charactersbraker649er, May 06, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4My 7th beer rated from this monastic brewery's 21 offerings on BA, so I think I've got a good sense of them.
It Looks like a hefe, but probably a little clearer and I got a big rocky head that dissipated. 
Smells somehow lacked that classic banana I most like from the style. 
Taste is balanced, the fruits and sweet wheat are kept in check with a healthy dose of hops.
Feel tells me the hops dosage is too healthy. Dry is OK, but this verges on bitter.
Overall, that bitter makes it difficult to go with food. Refreshing, yes. Food needs some sweeter malt in there for me.
Listed on the "1001", it probably very much deserves this... although I'm not a fan of spicy hefes.

The 500 ml glass bottle have a ABV of 5.4%.  The foam stick to the glass and when the beer become to the room temperature, the taste change and is a bit better, drink by drink.  The color is SRM 3.
Really nice beer overall. 362 charactersLewnanny, May 01, 2016

Truly an excellent beer - if you haven't tried this then you are missing out. I took a chance on this one based on reviews and bought a 6-pack since I could not find a single. I suppose my favorite bottle shop might have cut one from the herd for me, but now I'm glad I bought the 6er. I recommend this highly, a must try. Wow! 434 charactersbbtkd, May 01, 2016
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a beautiful golden amber with a nice plump and frothy three finger head of straight white foam.
Definite notes of banana, wheat, fresh grain, slightly spicy yeasty twang, and clove.
Clove, banana, yeasty spice, cereal grains, fresh baked bread.
Light-bodied, high carbonation, soft, creamy smooth, refreshing, incredible.
Overall, this truly stands out in the style as well as in general as a truly amazing beer. With this style it's difficult to stand out in aroma and flavor due to the subtle nuances, but this beer really provides for an awesome and silky smooth experience. 587 characterslarryarms847, Apr 30, 2016

Serious aggressive, stiff head, white and lacy on the glass as I drank. Nose, yeast and bananas, some minimal grain scents. Pleasant and balanced. Taste: smooth and full, fruity with mild spices and of course the yeast, yet not too sweet. A bit of tingle to offset the creaminess. Too easy to drink too fast. Mouthfeel clean, but almost as though you'd just eaten something, not had a drink. Solid from start to finish.
Bottle poured into glass; label stamp read "6046"  and "18 (I think) : 56 : 52." 565 charactersOldSwampy, Apr 23, 2016

Look: Poured a hazy yellow with visible sediment, and a huge two-finger head that blossomed up out of the mug
Smell: Yeasty, skunky, heavy clove, and hints of mold.
Taste: Bright and sweet bubblegum flavor, undertones of banana, medium wheat body, vaguely musty
Feel: Very carbonated, rich, thick and heavy, sits in your stomach like a meal. Mildly refreshing but quite filling.
Overall: A solid traditional hefeweissen, but I noticed nothing as outstanding as other Weihenstephaner brews,  like the Vitus. I'll have to pick this one up when Fall rolls around again. 611 charactersKazahkstan, Apr 22, 2016

Aroma: Sweet smell of fresh wet grass, wheat and yeast.
Flavor: I do not have the palate that others do so I am afraid I missed a lot of the different flavors that we're in this ale. What I did get was a delicious mix of sweetness that was crisp and clean.
Feel: Very smooth medium body with a semi-dry finish that leaves you wanting more.
Overall:Exceptionally great beer. First world class ale I have ever had. 
It is a delicious and smoothe drink. I wish I had found this years ago as I now have a favorite go to beer with this. 674 charactersBierwolf, Apr 21, 2016

Appearance- Pours a glowing honey yellow with high white head that hangs around the glass before receding.
Smell- Yeast, banana, clove
Taste- Fresh wheat base grain taste with hints of lemon. Picks up a bit midway into a more floral sweetness with a banana bread flavor. The banana notes hang around and rounds off the flavor profile with a clove/black pepper spice note.
Mouthfeel- Medium in body with active carbonation.
Overall- One outstanding hefeweizen to be had here. So smooth with a refreshing feel. The banana bread flavor really shines through in this one which is a showing of a fine hefeweizen. This one is as best as any for the style. 705 charactersPA-hunter, Apr 17, 2016

Had this years ago before the IPA craze and went back to it and it is out of this world delicious. So glad I revisited. Smooth, tart nose and nice banana apple taste with a dry finish. Will have this beer much more in the future. Ice cold makes it even better. 336 characterstjwarren, Mar 14, 2016

Smell is fruity and a little spicy, with definite clove and banana notes. Taste is classic wheat beer, with some tartness that offsets the fruitiness. Nice bready, yeasty finish. Not my favorite style, but I appreciate the quality. 296 charactersBeers-es, Mar 13, 2016

I really got a strong  pepper-y clove smell in it, but it was nice. Flavor is outstanding for a Hefeweizen - just so smooth and drinkable and the wheat flavor is really crisp. 
What I found really cool is that this is a beer thats been brewed at a brewery operating since the 11th century and its amazing. 378 charactersFBarber, Mar 13, 2016

Pours a hazy golden orange, looks beautiful held up to the light. Big, fluffy, off white head. Smells like the usual banana and cloves, with a hint of citrus. Taste is more or less the same, rich and full flavored but not overwhelmingly sweet or spicy like some hefes I've had. Just very well balanced. Feel is exceptional. I was amazed at how smooth and creamy this beer is while still maintaining great carbonation. Lingering, pleasant aftertaste on the finish. This beer is legendary for a reason! 579 charactersBrokenEdge, Mar 07, 2016

A - Cloudy golden orange/yellow with three fingers of fluffy white head that retains for a while. 
S - Banana bread, yeast, clove/spices.
T - Right in line with nose, with some back end biscuit/cereal grains and lemon notes. As it warms, the yeast and spice move more to the forefront. 
M.- Carbonation is a touch above medium. Feel seems both creamy and crisp.
O - Pretty tasty, if a little aged. Extremely well made, and holds up as the model for the style. 538 charactersApellonious, Mar 05, 2016

4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a  Weihenstephaner Hefe glass. 
Appearance: A beautiful golden amber, cloudy. Absolute belter of a head; rocky, fluffy and dense. Retains it all the way down the glass. Lacing is  sticky and ubiquitous.   
Smell: Fresh bread is there, as is banana and a mild clove. Hints of citrus fruit in there too.    
Taste: Wow! So good, almost like drinking banana bread, not overpowering or too rich though, and there is plenty of chalky, dry yeast flavour to calm it.     
Mouth-feel: Medium body, excellent carbonation and very easy to drink.   
Overall: It's been said many times before and with good reason. This is one of the very best Hefes and an easily drinkable beer for the style. I could easily polish off 4 or 5 of these in one sitting. Simply a stunning beer and thoroughly recommended, even if you aren't a fan of the style. 846 charactersWobjack, Feb 10, 2016

AROMA: Fresh cut grass, loads of banana bread, & cloves. That is what you expect, that is what you get.
TASTE: Just like aroma, great bready quality.
FEEL: Ultra smooth. Absolutely nothing harsh about this beer. Soft on the palate. Perfect level of carbonation, not overkill. Dries up nicely on finish, a little slick up front.
OVERALL: I just haven't had a smoother, more flavorful Hefe than this. It tastes very natural, like nothing is being forced to bring this beer together. 668 charactersmatcris, Feb 07, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Look: Poured into a hefeweizen glass, this beer has a beautiful fluffy white head that remains until your last sip. It has a wonderful straw gold color near the head that fades into a more vibrant yellow near the bottom of the glass.
Smell: I got a lemon-y smell mixed with a fruit that I couldn't immediately identify. Some notes of bread. (I'll be honest, my sense of smell isn't very developed yet)
Taste: Excellent. I was finally able to identify where the smell of the beer was coming from: bananas. It had the taste of bananas mixed with sort of an upfront lemon flavor. The aftertaste leaves that banana flavor on your tongue with just a touch of bitterness, enough to let you know that your just drank a beer. I gave this to a friend of mine who isn't really into beer to try and this is the only thing he's had so far that he likes. Extra props for that.
Feel: It feels really smooth to drink, with I'd say a medium amount of carbonation. You're going to be burping a bit from drinking this beer. You get a medium-light mouth-feel from it and there's just this great refreshing coolness to it.
Overall: Just a great beer, first I've had of the style. Really makes me want to go out and try more hefeweizens! Very deserving of a world-class ranking. 1,261 charactersmjpoole, Feb 03, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Let me just start this review by saying that I have had Weihenstephaner many times before, and that it is one of my all time favourite beers, and my all time favourite Hefeweizen. Weihenstephaner is the beer that introduced me to a world beyond macros. 
Appearance: One of the most appetizing beers I've ever seen. A pale, orange/gold like colour with about two and a half fingers of extremely creamy head. The beer is extremely cloudy, as sediment blocks almost all light from getting through. Gorgeous lacing on the glass. 
Smell: I can't get over how clean and refreshing this beer smells. Absolutely incredible, and easily in the top five beers I've had in regards to the aroma. A floral like aroma filled with banana bread and spices. Pepper is also present. You have to smell this beer for yourself to get a full appreciation of how good it is. 
Taste: Absolutely world class. I anxiously await the time that I find a hefe better than this one. Bananas on the forefront with cloves, pepper and bubble gum. A sweet, bready taste is also prominent on the back end. 
feel: Again, world class. Medium mouth feel with an almost tangy medium carbonation. Despite the medium body, extremely refreshing.
I can't stop raving about this beer. Whenever I have a friend that wants to try something a little better than Miller or Coors, I pick up a couple of these. One of the tastiest, easiest drinking beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. I can not recommend this beer enough if you haven't had it. 1,509 charactersChris_r2112, Jan 25, 2016

Only thing I will add to last few reviews is that the feel of this beer reminds me of a nice soft pillow of creamy wheat.  By no means a dessert beer, just the best mouth feel I have ever experienced.  Can see why this is held in such regard.  I am glad I woke up and have started to give these Bavarian Weißbiers the attention they deserve. 448 charactersThe_Dude_31, Jan 23, 2016

It was actually the replacement for another wheaty beer I wanted to try (leffe blonde ale), so I wasnt expecting much. The bar tender seemed disapointed to tell me this all they had when I asked for lighter wheat beer. 
"Bananas, cloves" he warned. I dove right in with a pint after only a taste. Wow. So impressed. It was exactly that. Had that signature Belgium sweet with surprising banana/fruit aftertaste. The look is average. Golden yellow could with some fizz. Stays fizzed for a while though. Feels smooth and mellow going down (what I love). The smell is not powerful. Its really quite unassuming until you get your nose up in there. I would reccomend this beer to anyone who is really involved in the taste. It cant be beat as far as im concerned. Sweet, smooth, fruity, drinkable. Love it. 858 charactersJerkheart, Jan 09, 2016

Look -- A gentle pour gives three fingers of creamy white head sitting atop a hazy pale gold body. Minimal lacing as the head just slides right back down the glass as you sip.
Smell -- Clove, banana, and bubblegum atop bready wheat notes. Yeast and apricot notes are also present in the background.
Taste -- Taste like it smells.
Feel -- Lively carbonation combine with a thick body to create a creamy mouthfeel.
Overall -- You'll be hard pressed to find a better hefeweizen. 612 charactersDravin, Jan 08, 2016

Looks beautiful. Pours a hazy, late summer afternoon golden yellow with three fingers of whipped eggwhite head that leaves a solid foothill landscape of lace as it recedes.
Smells of clove, banana chips, faint bubblegum and lemon zest.
Tastes of white bread, more clove and dry banana, lemonade, light crisp apple and faint white pepper.
Feels lovely. Body is medium-light with fuzzy, relaxing carbonation. Finishes clean, dry and refreshing.

Decent head retention with minimal lacing.  This is a great looking beer and filled out my weizen glass perfectly!
S-Smell is very yeasty with hints of citrus and orange peel.
T-Perfect example of what hefeweizen beer should be.  Balanced with a solid citrus note and mild sweetness.  Great spice flavor on the back end with a barely noticeable bitterness.  The finish is refreshing and clean.  I love the lingering spices on the palate.
M-Lots of carbonation in a good way with a medium body.  Easy to drink beer.
O-I am a big fan of hefeweizen beers.  For my money it doesn't get much better than this one. Definitely my go-to on a hot summer day or when I just want a beer without thinking too much about it. 828 charactersSMZBrew, Dec 11, 2015

Smell: Banana and clove, spice and yeast. Everything you'd expect; and I mean that in the best way. If you're drinking this, you most likely have a good idea of what you're in for and it doesn't disappoint.
Taste: Imagine liquefied banana bread with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Unmistakable Hefe flavors. Pleasant aftertaste that satisfies between tastes.
Feel: Fairly carbonated, medium to light mouthfeel. Deceiving amount of creaminess capable of coating the mouth that lingers well beyond the initial impression.
Overall: Very drinkable, and at 5.40% it can go the distance. A worthy standard by which other beers of its nature should be compared. 792 charactersPCole, Dec 07, 2015

Cloudy, golden, yellow colour with huge, dense head that recedes slowly to a 1mm white cap. Some lacing.
The nose is quite subtle for a wheat beer. Plenty of spice and citrus but not overwhelming.
Tons of wheat, yeast, clove & citrus but perfectly balanced and eminently drinkable. So smooth. So refreshing.
Awesome mouthfeel. Coats the tongue. Slight prickle.
A fabulous beer. Excellent in the summer served straight from the fridge and, served a tad warmer, it also makes for a big, spicy hit on a wet, dark day in January. 568 charactersSpike, Dec 03, 2015

F: High carbonation, creamy and very gentle. Full of flavours, this beer is absolutely fantastic.
O: Really refreshing, gentle, creamy, and full of aromas and flavours. Definitely, the best wheat beer I have tried. Each of the tasting notes are well defined, and makes this beer really pleasant to drink. I will buy it again. 903 characterssejorules, Nov 22, 2015

L: Hazy slightly dark straw color with a big billowy head and excellent head retention.
S: Delicious sweet-smelling aroma that’s chock full of banana and clove.  Distinctively weiss-bier and well done.
T: Semi-sweet taste upfront that’s heavy on the bananas and a semi-sweet finish that leaves a very pleasant taste in the mouth.  Classic hefe; it doesn't get much better than this.
F: Medium body, creamy mouthfeel, and abundant carbonation that simply add to this beer’s drinkability.
O: I can't speak highly enough about this beer. If I had to choose 10 beers to drink till the end of my days this would be among them and I'm hard-pressed to think of a better summer beer. It's completely emblematic of the style and captures all of a hefe's best qualities. 788 charactersthepenguin, Nov 10, 2015

Appearance: It poured a cloudy golden straw yellow colour with a fluffy and puffy three finger white head that dissipated slowly leaving some nice lacing.
Aroma: Lightly bready and wheaty with lots of sweet banana, banana bread and clove.
Taste: Sweet ripe banana with hints of bubblegum, clove and citrus lemon.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with mid to high carbonation.

F - medium body. Kind of a soft, fluffy feel but easy to swish around. 
O - One of the best hefeweizens out there. Top-notch on all accounts. A little pricey on the shelf so it is definitely a treat. Paulaner is a cheaper substitute, but the legacy of Weihenstephaner makes it worth it. Prøst 746 charactersctylinebeer, Oct 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I found a single from March but wanted to try it anyway. This beer did not taste old. The smell is yeasty and slightly spicy with a hint of lemon and banana. The taste is really nice. Crisp, smooth, and refreshing. Might be the smoothest, most easy drinking beer I've tasted. 
UPDATE - after drinking several 6 packs of this beer I can say is is world class and surely one of the best beers out there. It's perfect. yb 419 charactersSmashAdams, Oct 12, 2015

Beautiful hazy straw with a cloud like head. It's just telling you "drink me! Drink me!". Well okay, just one moment to enjoy the aroma. Esters, esters, esters and a bit of phenols. Apple, clove, banana. The taste is of banana, pepper, clove, coriander and orange zest. The mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated. 
This beer keeps focus all along. Never become overly sweet and always remains balance. As a beer connoisseur is funny to see how I can enjoy more and more at each try those classics beyond classics beer. No geeky thing, this is the real stuff. 666 charactersBruno74200, Oct 11, 2015

Look: Nice white fluffy head and murky orange. Wish all my IPAs look like this.
Smell: A lot of lemon.
Taste: Very light and I do get lemons. Finishes very watery and with a slight tart. 
Feel: Heavy carbonation on first poor but dies down fast. I prefer to drink this fast since it's better with more carbonation.
Overall: Not bad but not my style. 453 charactersKMachHops, Sep 20, 2015

Aromas of realistic ripe bananas, mild clove. Taste has plenty of banana, a bit of wheat and yeast, clove which can hit a spicy peak, touch of bubblegum. Mostly dry. The burps produced taste just like banana bread. Body is rich and full, which is rare to pull off well in this category.
This is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the style. The flavor is realistic, full, precise, well balanced, and, most importantly, delicious. The body has a creamy quality that in no way diminishes how refreshing this beer is. Love it through and through. 685 characters1000lbgrizzly, Sep 08, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is a beautiful hefeweizen: a giant lingering creamy white head adorns the glass with thick rafts of lacing from its perch atop a pale gold, extra-sparkling body that straddles the line between hazy and cloudy. On the nose, it is a perfect blend of banana/clove spice and yeast, layered in excellent proportion to the big wheaty malt notes that underpin the aroma, with a bit of help from some slight alcohol undertones. The palate follows the nose, with the addition of a slight citrus tang and just a bit of malty sweetness around the edges. The finish is quick: equal parts malt and yeast, followed by a subtle hint of spice that lingers to the next sip. The mouthfeel matches the light body, and the texture is smooth, moderately creamy and very prickly from the extra-fizzy carbonation. This is an exemplary representation of the style, and is both delicious and eminently drinkable. (11.2 oz bottle, 162 days after pkg.) 930 charactersOldManMetal, Sep 05, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Extremely impressive, dense and thick three finger head which lasts quite some time.
Fruity taste and very clear hefeweizen which is quite unusual.
Although fruity it comes as strong and imo a true man's beer!
Anyway, one of the best beers i ever tried. Period.
Highly recommended! 281 charactersaltecgs, Sep 02, 2015

I have been trying a lot of American hefes recently and started thinking I have just grown out of the style. I picked this up the other day and was blown away again. This is an amazing brew. 288 charactersJack_Frost79, Sep 02, 2015
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours orange in color with a slight haze to it.  Very nice white soapy-looking head.
Aroma is bready with notes of bananas and lemon zest.
A mild, sweet fruitiness begins the taste.  I notice lemon or possibly other citrus notes, a touch of cloves.  Finishes somewhat dry, with faint bready flavors scattered here and there.  
Mouthfeel and carbonation are both extremely refreshing.  High quality stuff. 407 charactersjp32, Sep 02, 2015

Aroma- A fantastic aroma of cloves and bananas.

Taste- Outstanding flavor of cloves, fruit and  wheat.  Great balance
Overall- A world class beer, even if you aren't a hefeweizen fan you should give it a try to see what a masterpiece of this variety tastes like. 389 charactersordybill, Aug 30, 2015

Felt like trying something different, so I bought a couple of bottles of this. Look is an awesome hazy, golden-orangish color. Body is more hearty than you might expect for a <6% beer. Head and lacing are near perfect. Taste was great--I drank this quickly. As I said, I'm not too big a hefe fan, but I am indeed now a fan of this. 384 charactersBuccoFan, Aug 28, 2015

Taste wonderful straight from the 6pack bottles or poured into your massive haufbrauhaus glass that has been sitting in your deep freezer at -10 defrees.  One of the best things about this beer is how good it taste even when not freezing cold.  Unlike alot of cheap skunky american beers, this beer remains delicious even after it loses its just from the fridge temp.  I usually grab 2 cold 6packs from whole foods.  Or if i don't feel like driving 30 minutes i'll stop into greens beverage to grab a couple room temp 6packs.  Lovely beer for all occasions from grilling out to relaxing and watching a baseball game on tv!   get some and enjoy! 707 charactersramstienerhaufbrau, Aug 26, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured a cloudy light orange with copious off white head and ample lacing. Smells of esters, bubblegum, citrus, light notes of malt. Sweet malts forward with a pleasant citrus zing, banana, cloves around mid-note with a pleasant clean finish – minimal hops or astringency. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with fair amount of carbonation – not syrupy and has a rather clean finish.
Overall , the ideal beer on a hot summer’s day – or between runs on a ski slope in Germany. A classic hefe that I go to again and again. Solid. I have yet to find an equivalent American version. . .  If you enjoy this beer – check out their Vitus weizenbock – its even better (I like to think of it as an Imperial Hefe) 707 charactersThaneMcC, Aug 18, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A- This pours an opaque golden/yellow color that is beautiful to look at.  The head starts out 3 fingers thick and eventually settles into a meringue like puffy cloud that is still around 1 finger over the Ale....color is super white.  The carbonation is much too hard to tell in looks and I can say that the lacing is very modest at best.  Still....a very nice looking brew overall!
S-  Bananas and yeasty bread is first and foremost on the nostrils, with backing spices of cloves and a peppery note blended in there as well.  There are also notes of Lemon and orange citrus zest and sweet caramel malts.  The finish has just a hint of hop bitterness and is rather clean and refreshing smelling!
T- Refreshing citrus flavors take over the palate, as opposed to the aromas.  Background flavors of baking spice is noted as well.....cloves, nutmeg and a muted peppery warmth balance out the sweet caramel/toffee malts.  The finish is of unmalted grains and is very clean and refreshing.  The peppery flavors noted linger on the palate with just a hint of heat.
M/O- Solid medium bodied beer with an immaculate carbonation that just blends so well for this style....it's assertive and the way it explodes on the palate really allows the flavors to burst with great intensity!  The drinkability factor is perfect and this deserves to be in the top tier of German Hefeweizens.....I could enjoy this all night long without getting tired of it!  I will most definitely get this one again! 1,484 charactersChrisCage, Aug 16, 2015

Likewise, the notes of banana and clove are very subtle comparatively.  Great head, in line with it's style, and an exceptional body make this an EXTREMELY DRINKABLE hefe for even those of the fainter heart which usually yield to the banana/clove characteristics.  You really can depend on anything from 'the world's oldest operating brewery, to produce the most drinkable and enjoyable of alcoholic beverages true to their style! 587 charactersHopsForBrains, Aug 05, 2015

L) Medium orangish-yellow colour.  Cloudy, although not opaque.  Looks quite fizzy.  1cm dense white head.
S) Light sweetish caramel with a bit of light cloves.
T) Taste follows the nose, flavour is light with a good side of caramel sweetness.  Banana-clove flavour is there, but is light.  Chewy marshmallow tones.  Ends up with a more open citrus-edged finish.
F) Fizzy, light with the clovey taste giving some weight.  No bitterness.
O) Well well well.  Had this one straight after a Franziskaner, and this in my opinion is the more subtle but frankly less tasty pretender.  Having said that it is a tasty refreshing drink and it would be dumb to say otherwise.   Good, but in my opinion not in the top tier of weizens. 907 charactersMalt_Man, Jul 31, 2015

Banana, clove, you know the deal with a Hefeweizen. What sets this apart is the execution. Beautiful mouthfeel, great fruity chew to it. Carbonation is perfect, looks like a dream in the glass. Head is abundant and lasts a good long while. Improves as it warms up, which is true of almost no American versions of this style. People who swear off the hef because they've never had a proper Bavarian need to better educate their palates before calling it a day. 655 charactersdd43, Jul 26, 2015

A: Pours a picture perfect cloudy golden color with a dense, creamy, 2 finger head of white foam. After a minute or 2 the foam settles to a crown that caps the beer perfectly. A decent amount of lacing is left clinging to the sides of the glass. 
S: Aromas of clove and baked banana bread, with a good amount of spice. Some fruity yeast esters and biscuity malts also coming out. A hint of white pepper as the beer warms. 
T: There is a refreshing flavor of clove and banana bread with a light spiciness. Biscuity malts and a faint amount of fruity yeast esters. This beer has a somewhat strong phenolic character. 
M: Light bodied with high carbonation and a crisp, refreshing mouthfeel. Semi dry on the finish.
O: Overall I thought this was a good beer with interesting flavors of clove and banana. It was crisp and refreshing, and would be a nice thirst quencher on a hot summer day. This could be a pretty versatile beer to pair with a variety of different foods. I would surely drink this again. 1,093 charactersTheItalianStallion, Jul 26, 2015

A:  Only drawback concerning the beer.  Hazy orange-yellow.  Head and lacing, like the appearance, aren't very adequate either.  Good effervescence, though.
S:  Very complex.  Lots of wheat and yeast impart scents of banana, clove, coriander, and white pepper.  Almost like a Belgian tripel.
T:  Follows the nose.  The beer is suffused with banana and coriander.  Very sweet and spicy.  Love the yeast profile.
F:  Alright.  Can't complain.
O:  A very well-made beer. 519 charactersleantom, Jul 25, 2015

A- Pours a Hazy, Pale yellow that is topped by a lumpy, white head. The head has incredible retention and leaves behind lots of lacing. 
S- Banana, crisp apple, light orange, clove/coriander, and a light, grassy hop to finish.
T- The taste is more or less the same. Classic Hefe characteristics but done so incredibly well that it seems like a new experience. 
M- Thick and wicked smooth. Moderate-Low Carbonaton. 
O- I believe that Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier is easily the best Traditional Hefe I've ever had. There are no experimental flavours and no additional BS. Just a solid, classic Hefe look, aroma, taste, and body that is an extreme pleasure to experience. 703 charactersPorterPro125, Jul 21, 2015

Smelled a little like banana, maybe some orange and other spices.
Tastes about the same with some flavors I couldn't identify.

fruits, yeast, and bananas on the nose. baking spices too, and come orange peel. Nose has got it all, good stuff!
flavour is overripe peaches and orange with banana all over. Lots of spices like coriander in the mix. The taste of the yeast is strong and bready, really nice and thick. At the end there is a punch of fruit, like applejuice almost. finish is whole grains.
mouthfeel is velvety and thick, like a good hefe should be. 
Overall, great hefe with all the notes hit in a great balance. Its particularly heavy on the fruit flavours but still stays balanced and full. I prefer the strong yeast flavours and big banana - Ayinger is still my #1 hefe - but this is a beauty piece of work all the way around! 798 charactersEricVonStein, Jul 12, 2015

Smells of ripe banana, red apple skin, together with grassy hops and white pepper. Banana shines through beautifully, while balanced by the hops and a coppery whiff, remaining the beers enjoyable balance.
Drinks incredibly smooth, carried by soft yeast, feels utmost silk on the palate, while providing enough carbonation to create an refreshing impression. 
Begins with cakey malts, clove, honey and a fantastic yeast smoothness, establishing the beers world-class mouthfeel. While the spices are prominent, they do get tamed by earth, a glimpse of oak and the grassy, slightly herbal hops. Finishes with young banana, more clove and honey, while the hops provide a pleasant, refreshing herb presence.
The interplay between noteable carbonation and euro hops turns out great, as the beer don't need no bitter hop punch to balance the sweeter spices, but uses the metallic qualities from the carbonation to create a short, refreshing burn, taming the sweeter ingredients of the brew. As easy as this drinks, as convincing is the beers receipt, showcasing a truly well made Weissbier, which leaves a refreshing, perfectly balanced impression on the palate. 1,236 charactersaleigator, Jul 04, 2015

Pours a nice golden color with abut a 3 figure white, rocky head. Leaves a nice lacing for the remainder of the drink.
Full smell, colve, wheat, and some bannana.
Wonderfully balanced taste, with the above mentioned smells coming out. Great levels of carbonation.

Slick full body with perfect carbonation. Well intensified and short clean finish, ending with pleasant floral spices and fruity sugary banana and honey feel lingering on the tongue.

3.72/5  rDev -15.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4500 mL bottle poured into a hefeweizen glass. The aroma is a mellow, creamy banana and vanilla with a complimentary clove and some subtle undertones of peaches. The beer is a cloudy pale with a hint of gold to it, and is topped by a creamy and frothy white head that retains well and leaves a light lace. The taste is a mellow and mild medium sweet with medium low bitterness. A creamy texture and carbonation go down smooth and easy with a medium body containing notes of fresh baked bread, banana, orange, vanilla, and a light woody clove spice that finishes clean with a lightly bitter clove and citrus zip and crispness that mellows quickly and turns over to a light oranges and nila wafers combination which stick in the aftertaste with a touch of lemon, and a lactose hint. Quite delightful. 797 charactersARoman, May 26, 2015

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a murky, golden-yellow color with a white foamy head. Glows a beautiful, radiant golden color when light shines through.  Great retention. Little to no lacing. 
Aroma contains a strong scent of lemon rind, grassiness, and yeast. Reminiscent of fresh grass clippings on a hot summer day. 
Taste is refreshing. Subtle lemon notes and orange zest. A perfect amount of yeast--doesn't dominate but it very present. Hint of bubblegum. Some nice sweet, tartness on the finish.
Mouthfeel is light bodied. Extremely crisp and refreshing. Quite possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had. I could've chugged this pint in no time. 
Overall, Hefes are typically towards the bottom of my favorites list, but this one did quite a bit to change that. Definitely the best Hefe I've ever had, and one of the better beers I've ever had, period. Great beer, one that even a newbie to craft beer could appreciate, or even a craft veteran. Great for anyone, on any occasion. 967 charactersmajorbase2, May 23, 2015

I think I'm still a little more partial to the "American Wheat" style that most people seem to consider Schlafly's Hefeweizen to be, but this is still probably one of the best of the style. 288 charactersDevAJ, May 21, 2015

I actually said to my wife, "This is the best beer that I have ever put in my mouth!"  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to taste a truly great Beer. 381 charactersJohnor3, May 17, 2015

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Truly one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted. This beer is a cloudy yellow-orange that looks awesome in the right light. An inviting blend of banana, clove, and bread on the nose. The taste is where this beer really shines. There's a lot going on with Weihenstephaner, and in my opinion, it actually tastes better if you drink it just barely cool or closer to room temperature  than really cold. I pick up on banana, clove, vanilla, bread, and slight bubblegum emphasized by the carbonation. The mouthfeel is great as well. Pretty creamy and smooth.
Franziskaner and Ayinger are almost as good. Maybe not quite as special. Either way, those would be my top 3. Had to escalate this one from a 4.7 to a 5 even though I'm reluctant to give 5s because it might be the tastiest thing I've ever drank (not just the tastiest beer). Get this. 846 charactersmkh012, May 07, 2015

I bought this for a reasonable price in Forestside Sainsburys N. Ireland and pleaded please live up to your high reputation.
What a lovely body then a nice fresh floral smell that actually smells good, not how Outcast would say roses smell like. The smell for me is not heavily pronounced, light actually for a hefe.
I had my first, enjoyed it like any hefe lover only could but didn't find anything special. I had a very nice dunkel, then another of these then an Erdinger Urwiesse which was nice then another of these and at that moment realised how good this this is. It could literally follow ANY beer any still be great. The last few sips of this beer is where it really comes into its own. Chewy, tasty, clove like and very little banana. I prefer a little more of a wheat feel and taste and probably a little more carbonation. 939 charactersbigdowg, May 02, 2015

S - notes of banana and a little clove. Scent has some vapour edge which seemed to go up the nose but not unpleasant. T - the clove flavour of the yeast really dominates for me but surprisingly I didn't mind it. I prefer it to the overly banana flavours of some Hefeweizen. M. - nice carbonation with the light body making it very refreshing. O - I'm not the biggest fan of Hefeweizen beers but quite liked this. The clove flavour might be a bit much after a couple but it was very refreshing on a hot day. If I was having a Hefeweizen I would be happy to have this. 645 charactersDecko, Apr 12, 2015

A lovely straw yellow hue, with a crazy thick head that sticks around for an extended period of time. Lots of little bubbles rising throughout. Smells yeasty and of biscuit. Tastes refreshing, with tons of banana and biscuity flavor, little notes of spice as well. A tremendous, refreshing hefe; one of the pillars of the style, clearly. 408 charactersTheElectricOne, Apr 04, 2015

3.85/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4It's a great beer. It poured beautifully, had notes of ripen bananas and fruity esters. Very easy to drink and light-bodied. It seems to be missing that subtle peppery bite that I look for in a hefeweizen. It doesn't compare to New Glarus Dancing Man - which has set the bar really high. It might be that this beer is not fresh. Could not find the bottle date and bought this off a shelf at room temp. I have no doubt that drinking this straight from the source or from a fresh bottle would leave this beer tasting much better than now. I will take the next opportunity to try this beer again when I find it refrigerated. 621 charactersBenish, Mar 31, 2015

-very sweet,creamy finish
Really great one,though most itt know that already.
though i have to say that i slightly prefer banana-heavy weizens above this like Franziskaner,Maisels Weisse or Schneider weisse 441 charactersdrmeto, Mar 29, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Purchased 500 ml bottle from the health food store for about $3 and poured into a tall beer glass.  A very hazy rich golden-yellow color with a fluffy pure white head that slowly fades leaving slight lacing.  Aroma is of bread, yeast and slight citrus.  Taste is really nice with some citrus and bread followed by a muted cinnamon/nutmeg-like spiciness that really makes the beer.  Towards the bottom of the pint, the beer started to have a slight metallic after-taste, maybe due to the trip across the Atlantic.  Goes down really easy, but is not super thin - enough body to keep you from pounding it, but enough carbonation to keep it refreshing.  Overall, a fantastic wheat beer and a great deal for the price. 713 charactersFFreak, Mar 23, 2015

Poured from a bomber into a weizen glass, this brew's got a four finger thick, frothy on the outside but finely foamed on the inside head. I've never seen one quite like this. Along with the golden hazed body.
          I smell earthy grains and a touch of fruit zest. This oughtta be good...   
      This brew's taste is a very lively and crisp malt characteristic combined with a slightly dry fruit in there, kind of mid-swig. A very great balance of those tastes and a high drinkability.
   Mouthfeel here is very clean and crisp. I can't wait to enjoy one of these on a hot day after a few hours of working outside.
  Overall, a 4.75 for Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier - Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan. Not quite perfect for a 5, but this is up there fellow BA's and also those new to this who'd like something lighter on the palate yet still bursting with great flavor. 961 charactersCaveworm, Mar 23, 2015

Smell: Very strong yeast smell. Some wheat aroma, but mostly yeast - spicy, citric, nutty.
Taste: Yeast are up front, providing that hard to pin down flavor - banana, citrus, spice, clove, soybean, peanut. Dry wheat malt flavor follows it up. The flavors are strong, but smooth and balanced.
Mouthfeel: The thickness and fine carbonation give this one a very creamy feel. No residual feel.
Overall: I can see why this brewery has been around for so long. All the components of this beer are bold, but well blended. I usually get bored of Hefe’s before finishing 12 onces; this one left me wanting another 16. 702 charactersSensorySupernova, Mar 15, 2015

Classic wheat nose of light clove and banana, a touch of lemon, yeast and biscuit.  As it warms, a subtle spicy character emerges.
Medium bodied with a very smooth texture that approaches creamy.  Well carbonated with a rich effervescence from the middle on.
This beer is the standard for Hefe Weissbiers and is world class.  The flavor profile is intense, complex and well balanced.  It begins with a mild tartness that separates into lemon and banana.   As these fade in the middle, clove comes forward over a biscuit background with a hint of spice and dryness.  The finish is crisp, with a mild biscuit fading and leaving clove. 711 characterstillmac62, Mar 10, 2015

4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4500 ml bottle, with no apparent bottled on date present. My first encounter with a bottle of Weihenstephaner.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - Pours a bit of a darker golden body than expected. Three big fluffy fingers of white head. Some spotty fluffy lacing. Standard appearance, but looks good for what it is.
S - The aroma is simple, yet befitting of the style. Lots of yeasty / clove spiciness.
T - The taste is classic of the style - creamy, yeasty, crisp, bready, floral, and spicy.
 M - The feel is very crisp, clean, and easy-drinking. Light bodied with good carbonation.
Overall, hefeweizens have never been my favorite, but this is clearly a well-executed and refined example of the style. Looking forward to trying more from Weihenstephaner.

So good.   Taste is just as good.  Full-flavored hefe with better mouthfeel than most.  Nice finish as well.  Pretty much a must-dring hefe, and the decision is even easier considering how reasonably priced this usually is. 508 characterscaptaincoffee, Jan 18, 2015

Aroma : yeast, fresh baked bread, spicy citrus and clean hop leaf. Very crisp and pleasant smell.
Flavor : wheat, banana, orange, fruit salad, with lots of zip and warmth, just so perfect it's hard to describe really. It's so blissful. 
Mouthfeel : creamy, dense, crisp, zippy.
Overall : One of my top 5 beers now. Seriously amazing. 522 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Jan 15, 2015

Beautiful hazy shade of straw with hints of orange in a classic Weihenstephaner pint glass with a nice layer of creamy head on top. Taste is as good as it gets in my opinion. Creamy, sweet, but not too much, fortunately, and overall just amazing. Drank a few at Prater biergarten while on my trip to Berlin and just the great memories of Weihenstephaner together with some nice Bratwurst make me want to go back. 442 characterswoutervaneijk, Dec 30, 2014

Massive finger length head retains throughout, the lace creamy and sticky! Aroma has a pleasant fruity ester, with a prominent orange rind feel as well as yeasty tones. Wonderful taste, simple but flavorful in all of its elements, citric with hints of lemon and orange, wheat, and yeast and a slightly dry finish. Great feel; creamy, smooth, light body. A lively carbonation is ever present. 
This is so drinkable, I feel I could have like three of these in a row! Crisp and refreshing! Will have again and again and again! 627 charactersGajo74, Dec 24, 2014

Appearance: A cloudy yellowish, yeasty luminescent color topped by a three finger-width white head that leaves decent lacing on the glass.
Aroma: A light fruity fragrance with slight clove accents.  
Taste: More carbonation than a Franziskaner, with a tangy, fruity aftertaste that does not disappoint.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, some carbonation on the tongue and creaminess.
Overall: This is a very good Hefeweizen, not quite as good as a Franziskaner, in my opinion, but definitely up there. 571 charactersDoctor_Bogenbroom, Dec 23, 2014

Taste follows the nose with a twang of wheat & a slight spiciness of clove, but PERFECTLY balanced. Simply THE BEST hefeweizen on the planet. 259 charactersDarthVorador, Dec 07, 2014

Produced a nice 3-finger fluffy white head, very persistent, the head lasted a good five minutes and left some very nice lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass.  The beer is a golden yellow color, thick and hazy, just as a good hefeweizen should look. The aroma of this beer is huge, with wheat, cloves, malt, some light citrus and just a hint of banana. The clove flavors really shine in the taste, along with some nice citrusy notes and banana, with a very nice sweet malty backbone.  The mouthfeel is very nice, medium bodied, creamy smooth on the front of the tongue, with the high carbonation adding just  the perfect finish on the back of the palate. This hefe is the standard against which all other hefe's should be measured. A world-class beer at such an outstanding price - I paid about a dollar each - outstanding beer at a super-low price- sign me up! 912 characterstimontheroad, Dec 04, 2014

S - Lots of wheat, some malt, hints of citrus.
T - An almost sweet front, followed by a wheaty middle.  The finish is very malty.
M - Medium body with a pretty good burn for a 5.4% beer.
O - I really like the malty finish.  Like most wheats, taste seems slightly on the light side for me, but it still a very pleasant taste. 451 characterssilverblaze540, Nov 23, 2014

500 ml bottle, weizen glass
A – Huge, frothy, slightly off-white head, about four inches and counting with very high retention.  Medium gold color with chill haze and mild sediment haze.  Beautiful.
S – Lemon spritzer, bubble gum, and banana liqueur.  Very sweet.  If any hop aroma, it is fruity and slightly earthy.
T – Banana is very first, highly prominent.  A slight bubble gum flavor.  Clove comes through slightly on the finish.  Citrus is mostly on the nose but flavor is there if you look for it.  No hop flavor.
M – Very juicy, all the way through. A medium body despite fairly low carbonation.  Mild sweetness persists all the way through.  Some effervescent bubbles in the finish.
O – Obviously one of the gold standards of the weissbier style, and I would love to drink a lot of this on a warm, sunny spring or summer day.  An easy go-to beer. 888 charactersinfinitebruner, Nov 20, 2014

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle: standard 500mL brown bottle, traditional German label.
Appearance: poured into a weizen glass - a cloudy pale straw with fine carbonation. A decent, creamy white head fires to an inch before settling to a solid finger.
Aroma: a combination of sweet wheat, citrus and bread. Smells of a properly traditional wheat beer.
Taste: the flavours come through more heavily in the mouth, with those citrus, banana and wehat being accompanied by apricot. A delight.
Aftertaste: the flavours linger nicely for some time. Some dryness comes through here too.
Mouth feel: moderate in feel due to the sediment cloud, with a higher carbonation. Despite the high carbonation, the feel is also quite smooth and a bit creamy, which is a rarity in a wheat beer. Lovely.
Overall: one of the better wheat beers I have had to date. A good mixture of flavours from the hefe spectrum. A well-rounded beer, and decent for an equivalent of AU$65 for a case of 24 x 330mL. What can I say - the Germans do it best. 1,000 charactersSmashPants, Nov 18, 2014

Appearance: Translucent, hazy orange
Smell: Banana, orange, and green apple
Taste: Orange notes
Mouthfeel: Light and carbonated
Drinkability: A smooth, thirst quenching beer that brings back great memories of the drinking Hefeweizen in Germany or during the Wurstfest in New Braunfels, Texas.

5/5  rDev +13.6%The Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan has been brewing beer since 725 A.D. and after 1289 years probably has perfected one of the finest wheat beers in the world. 
A golden-yellow wheat beer that pours of a fine white foamy head and emitting a light aroma of clove. When you slather this brew over your caliculus gustatorius (taste buds) this full bodied beer empresses a light banana flavor with a smooth yeast taste. One of my favorite wheat beers and the price is right. Cheaper than most American brewed main-stream beers.

The appearance was a nice yellow to off white cloudy orange color with a thick two to three finger foamy white head. Lacing slides down the sides nicely. 
The smell had a really nice yeasty to breadiness inside of a light orange - ish citrus atmosphere, reminiscent of refreshing qualities running all over. 
The taste was mainly sweet and bready citrusy notes. 
Crisp refreshing but not watery citrus aftertaste and sweet bready finish.
The mouthfeel was sticky sweet breadiness running over my mouth. 
Overall, this is more than just a standard for a hefeweizen. In my opinion, this is the end all and be all of hefeweizens. 664 charactersSitkaSteve, Oct 13, 2014
2.25/5  rDev -48.9%Ever since I heard of Weihenstephaner, I've been eager to try it. It's only my second hefeweizen after Sierra Nevada's Kellerweiss, which I did not enjoy very much. Still eager to develop a taste for the style, I thought I would try a hefeweizen that is generally considered the best in the world. If I don't like this, I may as well give up on the style.
Serving: Undated pint bottle. The label suggests to serve this beer cold, so I got it nice and cool in the coldest part of my fridge before trying it, but made sure not to make it 'ice' cold.
Look: Fantastic. However, I poured a bit too agressively and it produced a giant, frothy, meringue-like head, that settled down eventually but still retained a wonderful shape as it settled down to a reasonable size. Color is a dense golden yellow, without any transparency.
Smell: Up front and center was that same band-aid flavor found in Kellerweiss, and it seemed to dominate-YUCK. On the positive side, there was that sweet malt distinctive to hefeweizens, and possibly the faintest bit of banana. 
Taste: Pretty much band-aids and bubble gum. It was difficult to finish.
Feel: Well carbonated, as you could imagine, but almost felt creamy.
Overall: After being disappointed by Kellerweiss, I was willing to give Hefeweizens one more shot with what is arguably the benchmark of the style, but sadly ended up getting disappointed once more. I understand that it is intended for the yeasts to give off a flavor similar to this, and that many other people enjoy it, but it is just not for me, and I think it's only fair for my score to reflect my own experience with the beer. I guess I'm one of those people who are too sensitive to the yeasts/phenols for this kind of beer to be enjoyable. For now I will give up on this style, or maybe try a kristalweizen next. 1,820 charactersenjambed, Oct 13, 2014

Nixed wheat in 1516
I say f*ck those guys
A: Golden and clear, INCREDIBLY highly carbonated, drizzled yeasty bottom on top of head, and it stayed there for like...ever (3/3)
S: Wheaty spice dominates: a little clove and banana, but mostly sweet fruitiness (9/12)
T: Light flavor (not too sweet, not too bitter), but with a good deal of spice, and a fruit basket that comes in waves: red apple and banana mostly (17/20)
M: VERY bubbly and wet, but a dry finish(5/5)
O: This is a wheat beer.  Arguably the best wheat beer ever.  It’s amazing to see a wheat beer not trying to be something else (apricot wheat, raspberry wheat, cherry wheat) and really pulling it off.  The powerful flavors in this beer (and their Vitus, too) convinced me that wheat beers are not weak girly drinks.  They can be full-bodied and spicy, too. (8/10)

A - Cloudy light golden color. Fluffy white head. Superior lacing.
S - Plenty phenolic-clove character with grainy, bready, with some banana. 
T - Nice phenolic profile but doesn't overpower with accompanying grainy and soft banana tones. No distinct bitterness or hops and seems soft on the tongue but not too sweet. Even with the complex flavors still tasty and drinkable 
M - Light to medium which is perfect for the style. High carbonation that is stylistic and lends to the crispness and drinkability. 
Overall, the quintessential hefeweizen not too much anything but a great blend of all of the attributes of a hefeweizen. If you are just starting to get into better beers and have never tried a hefe or maybe you tried one and didn't like it this is a good one to get back up on the horse with.

4.75/5  rDev +8%Bottled, poured into a wheat beer glass.
Appearance - outstanding. Very lightly cloudy, orange-ish color with a massive, white foamy head that dies down quickly but remains fed by a steady stream of bubbles.
Smell - immediate hit of banana, mild clove spiciness, some light citrus notes more towards the orange/lemon. Hints of bread - wheat bread, specifically. Pleasant, sets the expectation.
Taste - right in line with the smell. A very slight acidity to balance out  the ample sweetness of the beer. Found the banana dominant at times, but overall nice balance between the sweetness, fruit flavors, very slight spiciness, and light pepper notes on the finish. Almost no bitterness.
Mouthfeel - very lively but smooth at the same time. Slightly coats the tongue, a little tingle from the carbonation, but nice body. Minimal aftertaste - very clean, light, refreshing.
Overall - an outstanding beer that delivers on all fronts and does not disappoint. Easy drinking, complex enough to warrant attention but not so complex as to be confusing.  Except for the banana coming to the front once in a while, I didn't think any flavor was particularly dominant. All of the flavors were balanced and smooth, contributing to the overall flavor without being "over the top". Great brew! 1,282 charactersLeRose, Sep 08, 2014

A - Orangish gold in color.  Cloudy from the beer being unfiltered.  Very thin head.  4.25/5
S - Dried bananas, cloves, and an undertone of earthiness.  Slight note of sourness.  4.25/5
T - Dried bananas pervades throughout the flavor profile.  Cloves.  No real lingering bitterness.  4/5
M - Coats the tongue nicely and is somewhat chewy.  Moderate carbonation.  4.25/5
O - Very refreshing beer.  Reflects the style very nicely.  Would gladly order this beer again, although I think I will try ordering a bottle next time in order to have a better head on the beer.  4/5 599 charactersbwood06, Sep 06, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%Aroma is largely clove-like with some banana and a touch of bread dough. Off-white head is large and frothy; body is a cloudy amber. Flavor is more spicy than sweet with clove and some peppercorn; there is some banana sweetness, a touch of bitterness, and a trace of alcohol. Body is medium-light with spritzy carbonation and a good carbonic bite. 
Surprisingly complex for a German wheat—others I've had tend to rely more on sweetness and smoothness, while this one punctuates the flavor with peppery and bitter qualities that give it a more mature character. I appreciate that the balance is towards the spicy qualities with fruity sweetness in support, and that the otherwise sour yeastiness is effectively masked. 721 charactersThe_Mad_Capper, Sep 05, 2014

4.4/5  rDev 0%Poured from a 330 mL bottle into a standard pint glass, because that's all that was available.  Moderate hand.  Label is stamped 0214.  Enjoyed this on multiple occasions, but never reviewed.  
A:  4.5  Cloudy, deep golden-orange body with a small amount of visible sediment that quickly dissolved/settled.  2+ fingers of thick, just off-white head.  Good retention.  Light lacing.
S:  4.5  Big wheat scents here - major banana and clove.  The latter is especially pronounced with this one.  Yeasty spice.  A touch of strawberry, vanilla, orange.  Hay.  Coriander. 
T:  4.25  Earthy spice initially followed by the development of wheat-fueled sweetness, bready notes and fruit.  Enough hops arrive to perfectly balance things out and it finishes semi-dry.  Minimal alcohol presence.  
M:  4.25  Moderate to high carbonation with a slightly above average body for the style.  A tad prickly, but nicely palate coating. 
O:  4.25  Great hefe, for sure.  Not my all-time favorite, but not many others I've had truly compete.

4.75/5  rDev +8%Had this out of a bottle:
Lovely thick head. Golden/amber liquid deliciousness. As others have said, the carbonation is perfect because you neither notice it or not notice it, if you know what I mean? Lots of weissbiers can be totally flat and so you notice the lack of carbonation but this one is perfect.
When I started with this one, I was comparing it to the Hoegaarden Wit-Blanche, since that is obviously a very good standard of beer in itself. Imo, I thought the head was better, the carbonation better, the taste better and all round drinkability better. And I really like the Hoegaarden, too!
This beer is just so smooth, tasty and drinkable that I found myself polishing it off in no time. I kept sniffing at it and holding it up to the light in between sips and then lingering over the sips, so as to prolong the enjoyment of the sip. I could sit and drink 10 of these and probably still want more. For a hot summer's day, you'll find it difficult to find a better beer (alternating in rounds between this and the Rothaus Pils would probably be close to nirvana)! 1,079 charactersMarkiboy, Aug 20, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +8%Last beer of the night - Sunday session at World of Beer UCF. There is not much more I can add to the body of knowledge about this beer except:
If you like hefeweizn and have not drunk it then you must place it at the top of your drinking list.
If you like American Wheats and want to expand your horizons then this is the beer for you.

4.05/5  rDev -8%Had on-tap at Bier Garden Asheville. Served in a pint glass.
A- Pours a hazy dark amber color with a 1/4 inch off-white head that retains decently before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of sheer surface foam.
S- Bright, effervescent and somewhat sweet.  High yeast presence with notes of banana and bubble gum.
T- Straightforward yeasty flavor brings notes of banana and coriander.  Extremely drinkable and quite tasty.  Lots of wheat with minimal bitterness.
M- Milky texture with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Good stuff and I haven't revisited this one in years but I also had the Vitus recently and I prefer that Inez's intensity of flavor. 720 charactersImmortale25, Aug 18, 2014

There is a bready, wheaty backbone that ties the flavors together. Very smooth and low in bitterness, this beer is definitely on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy.

Appearance - stunning; hazy yellow with a storm of carbonation bubbles that build a towering pillow white head! Decent lacing on the glass. 
Smell - banana bread, cloves and a subtle honey sweetness that is really pleasing!
Taste - mirrors the nose and delivers very refreshing flavor!
Feel - light, but very balanced; silky smooth finish!

L: murky/cloudy yellow-orange yellow; huge fluffy head of white to off-white foam, a full 2 inches tall and so thick it looks like it's never going to fully dissipate; clears up enough (and quickly) to show hundreds of bubbles flying up the column ... holy cow is it awesome! you'd think the bottom of this glass was scored with a CO2 nucleation point, but it's not -- this brew is that carbonated; the head doesn't stick or lace much, but man is it a pretty beer
S: sweet citrus banana-clove mixed with more sugar ... very sweet, at times like bubble gum ... banana-flavored bubble gum; some grain shows through at times but just barely; wheat bread
T: follows the nose with just a pinch of tartness added; banana, clove, orange/lemon citrusy, sweetness throughout, some grain
F: light by still full ... so bubbly but still soft enough to remain super drinkable ... yeah, it's perfect
O: boy is it good ... loads and loads of wheat sweetness with just enough of a tart note to keep it from becoming too sweet; a brew I will revisit over and over and a definite standard I will use to measure other hefeweizens 1,160 charactersPremo88, Aug 13, 2014

aroma- sweet notes of wheat, orange/banana
Taste- Very similar to nose and par for the course with the expected hefe flavors. Where this is unique is that there is a slight vanilla flavor that melds perfectly with the creamy texture of the beer.
Feel- As stated before this has a great creamy texture, while being clean and incredibly drinkable.
Overall- Great beer and certainly one of, if not, the best Hefe's I've tried so far. The vanilla creaminess aspect definitely separates this from the pack. (95/100) 623 charactersCTbrew32, Jul 30, 2014

Look: Cloudy rusted wheat body. Pure white head with great retention and spots of lacing.
Aroma: A lot of wheat, malts, banana, and even faint strawberry or other tart fruits.
Taste: Very grainy and malty up front. The banana is subdued and there is a pleasant spiciness I find in the taste. 
Mouthfeel: A bit bright, carbonated.
Overall: Just absolutely solid. 392 charactersJuicesFlowing, Jul 25, 2014

Very nice mixture of wheat and citrus, lemon stands out.
Well balanced flavours of wheat and lemon. Incredibly easy drinking and flavourful.
Smooth bordering on creamy, medium carbonation with a very smooth finish.
Very nice for a lighter beer, complex while very enjoyable and refreshing. 419 charactersbyronic, Jul 22, 2014

Cloudy dark yellow, shading into orange, amazing head on this beer. 
Malt, lemon, and a hint of clove on the nose. I really like aroma of this beer. 
Lemon, clove, spices in the mouth. It tastes as good as it smells. 
I'm a little spoiled, since I live in Austin, and we can get Live Oak Hefeweizen on tap in a lot of places here. So, I was a little hesitant to buy this one, but I wanted a hefe, and the guy at Specs said this is the best they have. I still like Live Oak better, but just by a hair. I have seen a number of reviews that rated this beer down a bit, and I would say that something you might do is let it warm up a bit. I started this one at fridge temp, and wasn't really that impressed at first. However, I was called away for a bit, and when I came back the beer had warmed up to probably upper forties, or even higher in temp, and it was AMAZING. It really opened up and a lot of flavor came out. 982 charactersKDHicks1958, Jul 20, 2014

Poured a light yellowish copper with two big fingers of head that pretty quickly dissipated down to a thin film. This offering was quite effervescent. The nose has notes of wheat and funky yeast. The flavor follows the nose. 
I tried to like this beer but there is just nothing special here. It may be the best hefe made but that makes it the king of a pretty tiny hill. 577 characters57md, Jul 15, 2014

Smell is excellent. I get that classic hefeweizen smell of clove, and other spices as well as the wheat malts. 
Taste is right on target, just as you would suspect from the great smell. I get the spices and wheat malts. Best beer I have ever tasted!
Mouthfeel is great. Good carbonation that really cleanses the pallet. 
Overall, really excellent beer. I have only been rating beers a few months but this one is my favorite so far. If you want a good wheat beer you should give this one a try. 637 charactersArchimedesSox, Jul 13, 2014

Pours pale orange, with moderate head and quickly receding lace patterns. Aroma is truly outstanding! Orange, banana, and great wheat aromas, very well balanced. Taste follows with cloves, grass and slightly sour yeast flavors. Very smooth finish and great after taste. 312 charactersPhigg1102, Jun 24, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5The beer poured a hazy straw yellow with a significant fluffy white head that just kept going and going which hinted at bottle conditioning. The aroma was classic hefe with the clove spice and banana yeast. The taste followed with the full bodied banana yeast and spices floating on top of a grainy wheat base. There was practically no perceptible bitterness to be found just Hefe heaven. The mouthfeel had a perfect amount of body and thickness to be a substantial and satisfying drink. Despite the fullness I found the beer to be refreshing while not sacrificing the full flavor of the hefeweizen. The Weihenstephaner really nails the style. A perfect Hefe. 659 charactersbrurevu, Jun 22, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Around cellar temperature in a weizen glass.
An extremely fluffy two-finger white head sits aloft over a slightly hazy rich golden-straw ale. Lots of carbonation to see. Gorgeous.
The aroma abounds with banana, bread, and yeast. There might even be some peaches, green apples, and mango in there as well. Oh, and cloves.
Its flavor is more straight-forward to me. First I get sweet banana with a touch of the tart fruitiness, then a clean finish of not-too-sweet breadiness. Think soft pretzel or a simple French bread as opposed to the richer white breads associated with holidays.
The carbonation is up there, but not out of control.
Just a really tasty, bready beer with some added complexities that most beers this light don't possess. 744 charactersKuaff, Jun 09, 2014

Pours a nice yellow/orange beer. Has a nice foamy head. Almost no smell, except for yeast and maybe a bit of sweetness. Taste is straightforward, classic, very well executed. It does not need to do anything crazy, it is very well balanced. A classic hefeweizen. 298 charactersJulioH, Jun 08, 2014

The taste was great, clearly a wheat beer with earthy tones (like cloves), but a prominent banana flavor throughout creating a sense of creaminess and faux full body despite being light and quite drinkable. I enjoy heavier, full beers so the feel was a bit too light and watery to me. Overall, excellent hefeweizen, not too much banana, but a light wheat beer with the enjoyable banana-earthiness from the unique yeast. 512 charactersjuanny, Jun 06, 2014

a: ultra cloudy pale yellow with one and a half fingers of head. lots of tiny bubbles. this is a pretty beer
s: big bubblegum note up front, then it gets wheaty, malty, and bready. light spices, banana and citrus at the end
t: quick bubblegum up front, then citrus, bread, banana, and slight yeast and spices. all of these flavours linger in the mouth for a while. hints of herbal/earthy flavours too? extremely flavourful
m: the carbonation is a bit harsh once it hits your tongue but it does go down smoothly. medium mouthfeel and pretty creamy
o: a classic beer, and rightfully so. loaded with flavour yet very drinkable. i used to not think too much of hefeweizens, but every time i have this one, i love the style more and more. try this if you haven't already 799 characterskevinlater, Jun 05, 2014

Appearance – Beautiful head. Pours great. Cloudy near the top. Hazy. Fine head, begins to collapse.

Bottle marked 6383, no other markings, at 45 degrees into a weizen glass
Aroma of yeast and spice
Head large (5 cm), off white, creamy, slowly diminishing to 3 mm layer
Lacing spotty; a few tiny islands of small bubbles
Body medium yellow, cloudy
Flavor begins sweet with coriander and banana predominating with some phenolic yeastiness present. No alcohol, no hops, no diacetyl. Ends lightly sweet with yeast flavor.
Palate medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
A VERY easy drinking beer, sweet enough to make you want more but not cloying. The flavor is subdued enough to make you keep coming back. An excellent hefeweissbier! 653 charactersOzzylizard, May 26, 2014

The smell is heavy with wheat that brings to mind bananas and really fresh bread. The taste was exceptional, with sweetness in the beginning that turns to the almost minty spice of the wheat. The feel was amazingly refreshing for being thick and just full of flavor. Probably my favorite import and can not recommend it highly enough. 438 charactersWhiteHillsStore, May 17, 2014

The smell is amazing, it doesn't smell like bananas or bread to me. The smell is just beer, the most amazing beer ever.
The look of this beer is phenomenal. I recommend pouring slowly 2/3's or more of the bottle and then spin the rest of the liquid in the bottle before pouring in the remainder. This will complete the look and taste by adding what some refer to as the crud. 533 charactersWiely, May 10, 2014

Bet you didn't find even ONE bad one.
If you ever tried wheat-beer and didn't like it, and it wasn't Weihenstephaner, please try it again (the right way).
If you are a wheat-beer lover, and have never had this beer, GET IT.
If you like beer in general, but haven't tried wheat-beer, or this beer, definitely give it a try.
If you EVER see this on tap, GET IT!! And take pics for the masses :) 564 charactersMikefromNYC, May 01, 2014

Appearance: Cloudy golden orange hue; Swirled and poured the last bit which resulted in a two finger white head 
Smell: Banana is dominant with wheat, yeast, and cloves playing in the background. Perhaps some citrus as well
Taste: Starts off with a blast of banana with hints of lemon and fades into a wheaty/yeasty and clove combination that lingers on the palate. 
Mouthfeel: Very light as expected yet extremely smooth and refreshing
Overall: When reviewing wheat beers, many of us on here (including myself) mention that it's not our style, but this is one of my very few exceptions. There's only so much you can do with a hefeweizen, but this one is truly special! And you don't even have to seek it out. Therefore, this is really the only hefe worth buying in my opinion. Stands out among others in the style at a competitive price point. This is one of those beers that make you look forward to summer. It tastes like clove spiced banana bread. The ratings say it all.

Tall frothy head floats over a burnished gold body, small bubbles rise to the top, keeping it lively and very appealing.
 Aroma is robust with malted wheat, lemon rind, banana and a touch of clove, very clean smelling to be sure.
 Taste is just out of this world good, clean wheat flavor with a touch of estery yeast, a slight tartness creeps in, or is that just the very satisfying carbonation? Who cares? this beer is a classic world class beer for very good reasons. It's damn near perfect.
 I thought I'd let this one warm a bit, but that aint going to happen. Just too damn easy and satisfying to take long deep draughts.
 Wow what a great beer, I could drink this every day! 806 charactersmudbug, Apr 26, 2014

It keeps building and growing and spilling out of your glass. Once the head finally falls you can start to see the cascading lace. The lace doesn't cling nor does it fall fast, it streams down in a relaxing fashion. So cloudy is the body and yet it shines like sun-bright egg yolks when held to light. Magic.
S-Banana. Clove. Cinnamon. Bubblegum. Candy sweet. Wheat. Dark bread. Take a hunk of banana bread and sniff it. Now sniff this beer. No difference. The beer will probably smell even better with a smorgasbord of scents on display.
T-Banana. Banana bread. Walnuts, almonds, buttery sweet nuts. Sweet wheat. Honey. Flashes of lemon & orange, very minimal. World class taste.
M-A watery yet still medium body is soft and refreshing. Medium carbonation is aided by beautiful spicy dry clove notes to where you become unsure which is tingling your tongue more: carbonation or spiced yeast? The sip starts, continues and ends in a harmonious fashion: Sweet, bready, lemony tart, mildly-to-heavily spiced and drying. The after-feel is super yeasty and peppery. Your taste-buds stand on end. Like all good things, it just "feels right".
O-The best Hefeweizen. A beer in which I can think of no area to improve in. In fact, stop reading as I'll stop reviewing and lets drink us some Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. 1,431 charactersshacawgo24, Apr 18, 2014

Pours a Nice hazy yellow/orange color. with a two and a half finger bright white head that lingers for a while. gives way to nice soap bubble like lacing all over the bulb of my glass.

Taste follows the nose. A spicy banana, cloves, subtle malts, a perfect wheat yeast taste. 
mouth feel is great. A creamy spicy banana lingers for a long time. Great carbonation. This is a great Hefe, and all others strive to be like this.
Overall, buy it or try it. You will love it. Best Hefe to date. I have had this brew many times and will buy it till I cant buy it no more. The more you try the hefe style it will grow on you. I did not like it at first. But it has a way of calling your name. 1,007 charactersOhiolager, Apr 18, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +10%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75The Weihenstephan Brewery in Freising, Germany, was formerly a monastery brewery of the Benedictine monks, and can trace its roots to the year 768 based on a document that refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. A brewery was actually licensed here by the City of Freising in 1040, and this is the founding date claimed by the modern brewery. The brewery, therefore, has a supportable claim to being the oldest working brewery in the world (in competition with Weltenburg Abbey, also in Bavaria, which has had a brewery in operation since 1050 and claims to be the oldest). When the monastery and brewery were secularised under Napoleon's occupation in 1803, they became possessions of the State of Bavaria. Since 1923, the brewery has been known as the Bavarian State Brewery Weihenstephan (Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan), and is operated in conjunction with the Technical University of Munich as both a state-of-the-art production facility and a centre for learning. Having had 1,000 years to work on their craft, I was looking for something special from Weihenstephan! 
We sampled the brewery's Hefe Weissbier ("HW") in a 500 ml bottle purchased from the LCBO, with a best before date of September 9, 2012. HW was 5.4% alcohol by volume. It poured a naturally cloudy, light orange colour with about 2" of fluffy, white, long lasting head that left plenty of lacing and spotting down the glass. The aroma was fabulous...bananas, cloves and yeast...and remember that this is a beer that complies with the Bavarian purity law and therefore contains no bananas or cloves. Darn clever, the things those Germans can do with the right strain of yeast! The taste very much followed the aroma, with bananas, cloves, wheat and yeast evident. The amount of carbonation was just right with lots of small bubbles on the tongue, and the mouthfeel was creamy. HW also had the clean finish I look for in my favourite beers. Ladies and gentlemen, if this isn't the epitome of the brewer's art, it has to be close! At $3.05 per 500 ml bottle this beer is a decent value for money as well, and HW now joins my short list of regular purchases. 2,165 charactersBuckyBeerBeaver, Apr 13, 2014

Appearance: Hay yellow with a big thick, tightly packed fluffy head.
Smell: Banana esters, spice, and yeast are at the forefront. I get some sweet malt on the backend. On to the taste!
Taste: Banana, cloves, bready yeast and sweet pink bubble gum. All perfectly balanced; no one flavor is overpowering or fighting the other. They are all holding hands and singing together. Fantastic.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, creamy. Perfect carbonation.
Overall: I've heard nothing but great things about this beer and finally gave it a try. This is truly a perfect beer. Definitely a benchmark for it's style and pretty accessible. A must try. 660 charactersdarthvohn, Apr 10, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into an Erdinger weissbier glass. The pour is slightly cloudy and golden in color and a big white frothy long-lasting head simply explodes from the top of this thing and fills up the entire globe at the top of the glass. Bubbles continue to stream up from the bottom of the glass long after pouring. The nose betrays all those delicious fruity esters and spicy phenols lying within. Lots of crisp wheat, bananas and clove on the nose.
Medium body, but full of flavor and deeply refreshing. There are some sweet, grainy, bready cereal-like notes up front and then a barrage of fruit, bananas and lemons mostly, and just a kiss of noble hops. The fruit runs the whole gamut from sweet (bananas) to tart (lemons). I also get just a hint of vanilla in there. Very few beers are as easy to drink as this one, especially on a nice sunny spring day.
I can't count how many times I've had this beer and finally am getting around to reviewing it. The perfect hefeweiss? Possibly. My favorite? Almost certainly. 1,024 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Apr 05, 2014

S - Balance. Gotta be perfect for the style. Banana, yes but not too much. Sweetness, yes but not too much. Bread-y yeastiness, yes but not too much. With some integrated cloves to boost. Perfectly melded together. Best of the style I've had but not my favorite style.
T - Tastes exactly as it smells. See above.
M - Sugary smooth. Not thin or thick. Nice "medium" everything.
O - By far the best hefeweizen I've had. It is a perfectly balanced beer with the smell and flavor just melding together.. Only Hefe I'd choose to drink again (as I said, not my favorite style). Giving the overall a boost for being the "best of" in a style. 757 charactersWolberjs, Mar 31, 2014

WH is by far my go to for the beginning of fall. Whenever I decide to have my own personal October Fests, which is really just me drinking beer and eating Brats and Knackwurst, this is the beer I do it with.
There are many hefeweizens out there, along with their derivatives and sub-categories. Many are similar. However, this one stands out. It looks clean and pure like a good wheat beer should. Really though, the taste is perfect. It is the epitome of what a wheat beer should taste like. Goes down smooth, easy to drink and just tastes right.
The best part of this beer is that it is in ample supply. 677 charactersSeanem44, Mar 27, 2014

Smell: Perhaps the best smelling beer that I have had in a long time. Strong citrus scents come off the pour and as you drink. Honestly smells like a field of wild flowers
Taste: light and citrusy, this is perhaps the best part of this here weissbier, you could drink it for days. 
Mouthfeel: Bubbly, but not over powering, crisp beginning and a slight aftertaste. I would recommend this beer for an afternoon BBQ or similar event. 561 charactersRhettbuck, Mar 26, 2014

Good lacing with a finger or so white fluffy head. Smells fantastic, hints of bubblegum and banana. Taste is a very nice banana bubblegum with a bit of clove. Apple, wheat flour, cinnamon, zesty lemon(?), small bit of hops on the end.  Mouthfeel is a bit creamy at first which bubbles down to wattery with light carbonation along the way.

Poured out with an straw yellow hazy color... and you immediately smell the bananas.
The taste starts off wheaty and bready, and finishes off with banana, very pronounced each of these. Very mild hop flavor in here.
Overall this is my favorite hefe… no adding a lemon to this one boys and girls. 351 characterspaul_db, Mar 24, 2014

A billowing meringue-white head condenses to a puffy pillow after an eternity, leaving dense patches of lace on the Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Lazy carbonation rises from within.
The aroma is against a white bread background with the anticipated banana and clove being fairly subtle. Bubble gum and honeydew were also discernible.
The banana comes forward in the first sip, while cloves remain subdued. A background of vanilla gives way to sharp banana flavors just before a subtle, slowly-fading finish. This Hefeweissen is sweeter than anticipated with a hint of tartness.
Medium to full body with a soft cotton texture. Ample, prickly carbonation. No alcohol. Residual sugar deposits on lips.
This beer serves well as a transition from work into a late afternoon of relaxation. It is especially well-suited to a cool, cloudless blue Friday with light rustling wind. 948 charactersSLeffler27, Mar 16, 2014

Pours cloudy golden with a big white head that dissipates quickly, lots of carbonation. Smell is banana, clove, fruity, yeast, bread, lemon. Smells good.
Taste is all of those things but muted and mild, maybe a little too watery (which may be right for the style, and just out of my preference), but really an excellent combination of flavors.
Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and satisfying, while somehow still light and airy. Overall, excellent beer. 603 characterssnaotheus, Mar 10, 2014

A: Cloudy yellow golden rod with very active carbonation, two inch head with lacing all around.
S: Bananas on front, slight yeast scent on back-end, turns a little bready or nutty as it matures.
T: Slightest of orange on the very front end that quickly vanishes, mellow banana and wet walnuts throughout as the prominent characteristics. I wanted a stronger taste here, but still enjoyable.
M: Light, smooth, and refreshing with a medium carbonation that turns high and bitey on the back-end.
O: Beautiful appearance, great carbonation, and bananas throughout. Love it. Looking forward to enjoying weizens this coming spring and summer. 684 charactersBoulderBarrovecchio, Mar 06, 2014

Pours a quite hazy straw coloerd glass. There is about two fingers of weak white head that quickly settles to only a lacing.
The aroma is grainy (wheat), but quite mild. Also slighty yeast and alcohol aroma.
The taste starts with sweet grains, the body is bitter and it has a slightly stale feel. There is a bitter finish.
It's a nice beer, but... not really what I expected. 414 charactersMarkoNm, Mar 01, 2014

Pour: Pours out a light unfiltered orange with a large creamy head that dissipates slowly. This gobs of lace that almost look like whipped cream. Served in a hefeweissen glass. 
 Taste: Very slightly banana sweetness when it touches the tongue, but quickly changes to a heavy wheat bread and yeast taste that over powers before any of the subtle notes can be enjoyed. I think I may have tasted a little citrus on the end but hard to decipher. 
 Opinion: I feel kind of let down with this. I'd think for the worlds oldest brewery that the recipe would be extraordinary, but this was middle of the road for a hefe. Not a bad beer but I prefer Ayinger to this. 761 charactersyouknowmyname, Feb 11, 2014

Pours a slightly cloudy, light straw-colored gold with two fingers of pillowy bright white foam which reduces to a thin ring with moderate lacing. Smell is a sweet blend of lemon grass, clove, banana and white pepper. Not a "strong" aroma but pleasant and intriguing.
The texture is exactly what I want in a wheat beer. Crisp carbonation on the tongue followed by a smooth light-medium body with a nice dry finish. The taste is more or less what you'd expect from the smell. Clove followed by faint citrus, banana, and a slight bitterness provided by an earthy grassy hop note. The finish is pretty clean with just a little yeasty spice lingering.
I've not had many European hefeweizens but this one is easily the best so far. Very well balanced and one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had. I can't believe how many times I looked at this on the shelf before finally trying it. I have a whole new appreciation for the style and this will be a regular in my fridge. 1,023 charactersglass_house, Feb 06, 2014

Pours a hazy yellow/gold in color with a good 3-finger white head that does settle down to about 1/2 a finger. Lots of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is sweet right up front with wheat and cloves. The taste is real close to that with the slight tangy clove finish. Clean and crisp and goes down very easy. No bitter or harsh after taste at all. Very slightly dry at the end. Overall, really a great brew! 616 charactersBeerWithMike, Feb 05, 2014

Pours perfect in a weizen glass topped off with a high quality foam and colour to match. Claiming to be the worlds oldest brewery; one sip and you will easily know why they still exist.
I have always been a fan of wheat type beers, my first experience with Weihenstephaner had me instantly hooked. One sip and I knew "this is is!" Bottom line: If you like wheat beer this should be your next purchase, you can't go wrong. 541 charactershaharight, Feb 02, 2014

Wet patches of bubbles cling to the walls of the tulip. The aroma is of strong clove, banana, wheat, straw, freshly cut grass, and hay. Very floral and refreshing. The taste follow suits, with a strong clove and banana presence amongst a wheat and hay background. Some faint lemon citrus, white pepper, and crisp grape juice sensation round it out. Mouthfeel is delectable; light, crisp, and lively with an effervescent and dry finish. Overall, this is a phenomenal hefeweissbier that I’m always happy to have. The clove in this is very predominant, but masterfully integrated such that it doesn’t seem overpowering. 758 characterseclipse54, Jan 24, 2014

Poured from bottle into a standard glass. VERY cloudy. The most opaque wheat beer I have tried.
Smell was a little on the sweet side. Not offensive at all.
Taste was almost neutral. Well balanced with little to no aftertaste.
Mouthfeel was almost acidic due to the amount of carbonation. But I do enjoy lots of that.
Overall I was very happy with this beer. Although I still do prefer Erdinger Weissbier. Erdinger is has more of a full flavour. A little stronger then the one reviewed.
If your looking for an amazing Wheat Beer, you won't be disappointed with this one. 
Erdinger Weissbier is still a better beer IMO

After finishing the bottle rather quickly I thought this must be a well rated beer. This site confirmed that my peers love this beer. It is a very easy drinking, smooth wheat beer with robust taste. There is not one flavor that dominates, it's just smooth and wonderful. This was a great surprise and helps make me a fan of wheat beers again.
If this beer was a friend, it would be the one you choose to spend the majority of your free time with! 541 charactersJSuperman, Jan 11, 2014

Smell: Clove. Wheat, bread sweetness. Spicy. Earthy yeast. Light banana and a hint of lemon. Basically what defines this style, did expect a bit more banana, but doesn't matter really. 
Taste: Smell pretty much translates into taste + light hop bitterness. Clove start is the most obvious, also some spice light banana, apple. Then goes in to crackers medium sweet wheat middle. Ends with earthy yeast with light bitterness and some banana esters. Can't really think of a more perfect blend of tastes, no wonder this one defines the style.
Mouthfeel: Light-medium body, crisp dry - you need and want to take another sip soon. Constantly. Till all gone. 
Overall: German perfection. 883 characterstmzl, Jan 05, 2014

The appearance on this beer is truly a thing of art. A massive, foamy head forms into a peak above the brew. Sticky lacing is all over the sides of the glass. A cloudy, light copper liquid shines within, emanating golden hues. Abundant carbonation sears its way upwards. 
As I expected, lots of banana and cloves hit my nose, alongside some sweet bread and yeastiness. It's simple but smells delicious.
The taste is almost identical to the nose, aside from a slight tartiness at the beginning.
The beer has a pleasant mouthfeel, alternately creamy and carbonated, with sweetness, tartness throughout and a semi-dry finish.
An excellent beer, easy-drinking and refreshing and very approachable. 741 charactersONovoMexicano, Jan 02, 2014

Classic hazy golden body and a finger of puffy white cap that falls to a ring. 
Yeasty scents of clove and light banana. Slightly sweet vanilla and honey. Great spicing from the wheaty base. Not overly sweet and slightly chalky.
Flavors are similar to the nose with more spice: clovey and peppery. Awesome punch of banana and wheat to go along with the spicing. Only a little of the vanilla in the finish.
Finishes more crisp than dry. Medium body with a decent creaminess.
Wonderful beer that I could drink over and over again. The sweet is cut by that wonderful spicing on the nose and palate. And that wheat base is amazing. World class, no doubt. 681 charactersPintofbrown, Dec 29, 2013

Unfiltered bursting with carbonation leaving rings on the glass as you drink it is one of the best wheats ever made. Not only is it the best but it 'a the first claiming that it was first brewed in 1040 AD. Fragrant citrus bouquet. Carbonated not bitter citrusy wheat taste on the palate that lingers as a slightly sweet beer. Possibly floral at the finish. The best lingering flavor for a wheat I've ever tasted. True Bavarian (Munich region) beer. Not hard to find but don't underestimate it's greatness. 615 charactersRyanm1, Dec 25, 2013

T - 4.25 - More wheat, banana, clove, lemon. Little less complex than the smell, but I can tell why people like this one. 
M - 4.25 - Light mouthfeel. Easy drinking for sure. Aftertaste is yeasty bready malts. This beer makes you burp fresh lemons. Nice.

I would not worry too much about the freshness factor, as this beer ages remarkably well for the style.

Pours a gorgeous hazy golden shade capped with a massive, pillowy three-finger head. Solid retention on the head, which gradually subsides to a quarter-finger film atop the beer. Spotty but clingy lacing.
In the nose, a potent banana note reigns supreme, with subtler (but still not particularly subtle) notes of clove, bready yeast, and wheat supporting the dominant banana note. A light, sweetish lemon note as well, more lemon meringue than lemon itself.
In the mouth, lemony notes mingle with banana and fleeting clove on the front of the palate, while light bready and yeasty notes dominate mid-palate. Becomes increasingly dry as the beer reaches the back of the palate, finishing quite dry and rather spicy. Feels more like a wit than a hefe in that regard...or perhaps I simply haven't been drinking the right hefes.
On the tongue, crisp, light, dry, and effervescent. ABV is all but unnoticeable, though it does lend a certain warmth towards the back of the palate and lingers in the aftertaste.
On the whole, this is truly deserving of its place among the top 250. While wits and hefes may never be my favorite style, I can absolutely understand the praise for this particular one. 1,277 charactersLjudsignal, Dec 13, 2013

It will definitely be a summertime favorite for me, as it is unmatched by any other hefeweizen. The taste and feel of this beer is superb. You do not get too much wheat from this beer, the flavors are surprisingly complex and balanced at the same time.
Highly recommend, if you like wheat/hefeweizen beer this is exactly what you need. 552 charactersBrandonN24, Dec 11, 2013

Fairly new to the craft beer scene/geekery but have experienced quite a few microbrews over the past 10 years. I've been cruising beeradvocate for the last month or so and I love this site. Today I picked up a bomber of Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier on recommendation from the forums, so let's see what happens...
A - Poured slightly chilled out of a bomber into pint glass, swirled to incorporate sediment goodness. Two fingers of head recedes into a persistent, thin sheet after a minute. Looks very enticing.
S - Smells of banana, cloves and other spices, and a wheaty maltiness. Smells nice and sweet, I like it! Almost picking up a faint bubblegum note?
T/M - Taste general follows the nose it seems - starts with a nice wheaty crispness follow by the spicy banana notes, then ends with more crisp wheat. Finish seems to go on and on with all the flavors noted above, and makes me want to keep drinking and stop typing this review. Medium/light mouthfeel, nice and dry to my pleasant surprise, due to the sweet smell.
O - It's no wonder this beer is rated so highly, It's one of the best beers I have ever had, and definitely the best hefe I've had. It's a stark difference from the last hefe I had, which I think was a Widmer almost a year ago - it's just no comparison, they are two totally different beasts. The Weihenstephaner was a flavor bomb and now I wish I had another to drink! 1,413 charactersRedneckwine, Dec 05, 2013

A: It looks glorious. It's a hazy, pale orange/yellow. It even looks like wheat.
S: Wheat and banana, a clear preview of the taste.
T: Banana is the overwhelming flavor. You can taste the wheat and citrus but the banana outshines anything else by a mile. One of the smoothest and most refreshing beers I have tasted.
F: Crisp and smooth. Not too heavy but not to light.
Overall: An excellent medium-bodied, almost sweet, beer. Highly recommended. 657 characterswalkinginplace, Nov 29, 2013

The smell is yeasty with hints of banana and spices.
The beers tastes very pleasant and refreshing. There are some citric notes and some bready sweetness with another hint of banana. Not much hoppiness in this beer.
The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and adds to the overall refreshing nature of this beer.
Overall this is a very well balanced and easy drinking beer with some interesting but fairly subtle and delicate flavours. It would be particularly nice on a hot summers day and makes a nice alternative to a pilsener. I didn't think it was quite as amazing and wonderful as the ratings suggest. But it was good.
My mark out of one hundred would be 81. 812 charactersLagerCognoscenti, Nov 21, 2013

A - Pours a cloudy honey color with an inch and a half off white foam head with minimal lacing
S - Smells of flowery spice with hints of coriander 
T - Tastes like floral and fruity with bananas and some citrus. The after taste is the best part of the beer. Fruity taste left on the palate
M - Not too overpowering carbonation, nice creamy mouthfeel. Great
O - Definitely the best readily available wheat beer or hefe.

In the mouth, coriander and other spices come out, along with a big Belgian yeast characteristic, banana flavor, and bubblegum. The body is light with a sweet finish. 439 charactersitsscience, Oct 29, 2013

Smell: Puréed banana bread, apricot and tangerine esters. Clove-like scent is more prominent upon warming, as is a smattering of peppery and floral spices. 
Taste: Bready malt, with the slightest tang from citrus esters. Banana and bubblegum flavors are more present in the aftertaste. Less focused on esters and spices than other Hefeweizens. The flavor is more malty and subdued, which I enjoy because it actually adds a layer of complexity by pairing yeasty flavors with malty ones. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body, with fair carbonation. The wheat makes the body feel slightly heavier, but there is also a silky quality to the mouthfeel that makes things more smooth and sessionable. 
Overall: A more balanced, malt-forward Hefeweizen, which creates, for me, somehow both a rounder and more complex flavor profile. An enjoyable example of a traditional German wheat beer that encompasses both creativity and tradition. 1,064 charactersBethanyB, Oct 11, 2013

Appearance: pours a murky yellow gold with hints of orange. Bubbling from the bottom is beautiful. Strong, white head, with minimal lacing.
Smell: Wheat, yeast, sourdough bread, caramel, champagne. Hits powerfully, though not hard, but very deep. Considering the "weakness" of the flavors, that's quite good.
Taste: Wheat, malt, maybe a touch of banana. Well done, but there's not too much here, and it's not too interesting.
Mouthfeel: Really smooth, with just a tough of bite from the carbonation.
Overall: A disappointment. A very pretty beer. Smells great. Feels great. Tastes good, but less than I expected. Still, if I wanted good hefeweizen, I'll acknowledge that I've had none better. I think hefeweizen is just not my thing. 766 characters007rtw, Oct 05, 2013

Fresh aroma of cloves and banana bread with some clean zest in the background. Very strong clove presence on the tongue, finish brings out that medium body. Just perfect creamy mouthfeel, and goes down so smooth.
Overall: Not much needs to be said, this is a great beer. My favorite hefe to date, and I've had a few. 472 charactersoffthelevel_bytheplumb, Oct 03, 2013

I would rank this my second favorite Hefe beer next to the Ayinger Bräu Weisse. I reviewed that beer already and I think I gave this Weihenstephaner beer a better review, haha, oh well. I just LOVE the really forward banana flavor of the Ayinger and the champagne mouthfeel. Its just a matter of preference. If you handed me either one of these beers I'd give you my first born child. The Weihenstephaner is a better deal though. I can get it for less than $2 a bottle (11.2oz) while the Ayinger is about $3.50 (16oz) a bottle (it has about 5oz more of yummy juice though). 679 charactersFear4Beer, Oct 02, 2013

4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a weizen glass
Beer pours a cloudy golden wheat with plenty of swirling yeast, producing a near perfect 3 finger head. From the bottom of the glass an eternal stream of effervescence sustains the head and keeps it perky. Wonderful web-like lacing on the sides of the glass... this beer is beautiful to behold and is almost to pretty to drink
The smell is banana bread, cloves, wheat yeast and spice, exactly what I was hoping for. Aroma is a bit more subtle than I would have liked, however.
Taste is BIG phenolic banana and cloves, wonderfully wheaty and bready. This is a truly delicious beer, and one that I could drink everyday.
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy without being too thick. Very quaffable, not that you'd want this beer to disappear too quickly.
Overall, a top-shelf hefeweizen that everyone should try. Sessionable, affordable, and delicious, it is an excellent representation of the style. 942 charactersDas_Reh, Oct 01, 2013

Aroma is strongly fruity, with strong yeast and sweet malt. Tastes like a classic, iconic take on the style, cloves and allspice, banana and perhaps another tropical flavor like subtle mango, more hops than other examples of the style which cut the intense sweetness but not enough to wreck the sweetness or push it too far away, a near perfect balance really. Where Ayinger is weighted towards the fruit, this one leans towards the spice, with a strong clove flavor building as you progress through a bottle. Finish lingers and leaves some yeasty sweetness and a little bitterness. Overall, complex and layered flavors that are light years away from an American wheat made with standard yeast. 759 charactersCalgaryFMC, Sep 10, 2013

Pours a golden hazy color with a thick off white head. Smell is banana, cloves and spice and yeast. Taste is what you would expect bananas, cloves, spices and citrus.

T-Bold flavor leaving you wanting another sip before you pull it from your lips. Balanced by a nice spiced citrus, banana, cloves, cinnamon and wheat. You get some hops vary faint but its there. Medium body with perfect carbonation.

Smell is amazing belgian yeasy, banana, grassy, clove, some slight citrus. Taste starts with a smooth grassy hay, sweetness kicks in with banana, spice, some lemon. Mouthfeel is perfect; enough body to give you wheat flavor while still being thin enough to be refreshing. Overall this beer is a gold standard, I love grabbing this one. so accessible that its easy to forget how amazing it is. No beer lover should miss this. 490 charactersbrewtus, Aug 20, 2013

Poured from a brown 330ml bottle with the date code of 5 June 2013 on the back into a pint glass and got two fingers of head that poured over the rim.
A: Pours a golden color that is hazy with a bubbly two inch head covers the top to the end with 1/8 in. foam. There is not much lacing. 
S: Smell of banana and clove big time and spice and sweetness.
T: Taste of wheat and some smooth lemon zing that s balanced with a caramel favor and some mild hops and some fruitiness, too.
M: Very light and the champagne effervescence dances on my tongue. This is very drinkable.
O: Just an absolute pleasure to drink. This must be one of the best beers in the world. It certainly is the beer that I completely enjoy. I must recommend it again and again. 980 charactersJohnnyJam, Aug 12, 2013

S - Wowzers. A dropkick in the face of of Wheat, Clove, and Banana. Not a bad dropkick to the face, one that I would pleasantly take each and every day. 
T - Perfect balance of banana, clove, bready, and bubblegum with ever so slight tingle of hops. A lot of yeasty tones. 
M - Medium-Light body with average carbonation. One of the easiest drinking beers I think I've ever had. You could put these down effortlessly.
O - I might be a bit biased since I am a big fan of wheats, especially a sucker for German Hefe's, but this is literally my favorite beer. It is absolutely perfect beer for it's style; where every wheat in the world should be compared to and strives to be. Weihenstephaner has been open since 1040, and it shows from the quality and perfection of this beer. 989 characterszgren, Aug 09, 2013

T- Banana, wheat/yeast. A bit of pepper. Citrus. Yup...tastes like heaven also.
M- Medium body with high carbonation. I could drink this all day.

A: Pours an extremely hazy golden color. Poured aggressively, it yielded over three fingers of fluffy, white-colored head. Retention isn't the best - I can visibly note it fading away as I type this. It leaves more lacing than others in the style, though.
S: Aromatically, it's just a hefeweizen - banana and clove esters dominate, with only a touch of noble hops to balance. What makes it great is that it seems like the distilled essence of everything a 'weizen should be. Some are heavy in banana, others are heavy in clove; this one is heavy in both, not to mention perfectly balanced between the two.
T: Just like in the aroma, it takes a bit of time for this to 'click' on the senses; before that, this drinks like just another quality hefeweizen...until one realizes that this is so perfectly balanced and delicate, it's freakin' effortless. The best part is that there aren't really any stand out notes, just banana/clove esters to open it up, a faint kiss of finishing noble hops. Oh wait, I lied about that one - there's a distant orange note on the palate somewhere that really make this one special, even compared to other great examples of the style. Not to mention the wheat is incredibly soft yet vibrant. Could go on all day waxing about this one...
M: Light in body, with a dry-ish finish and plenty of carbonation. Only detractor is a touch of finishing astringency. But just like I said, effortless to drink.
O: I have no doubts this is the benchmark of the style for good reason. This one is on my list of "would purchase by the case" beers. 1,619 charactersThisWangsChung, Aug 08, 2013

S: Yeasty, bananas almost goes unnoticed. 
T: Hoppy with floral sweet flavors and lots of bread.
M: Smooth, light, creamy with no hint of alcohol. I've drank the Hefeweizen from Erdinger with and besides having lower ABV (4.9%) it was more noticeable.

Smells-Bananas and cloves. 
Tastes- This is the first beer I had that I actually understood why the word "banana" is used when describing beer flavors. It is sweet in a great way but also balanced out with some clove. A very delicious and drinkable beer. One of the best tasting beers I have ever had.
MF_Very refreshing. Little bit of carbonation.
After much consideration I have concluded that this is my favorite beer. I love hefes and this is the king. This may have officially unseated Delirium Tremens as my favorite beer, or not, I can't choose.

A: Beer pours with a massive head if you pour it anything above slow. The beer looks like a Bavarian Hefe beer should looks, hazy, creamy, and golden colored.
S: The smell is absolutely delicious. The smell of banana and cloves are so intense you can smell it without nosing it. It's that good. There is also a breadiness to the smell.
T: Exactly what you should expect from a wheat beer. Bananas, cloves, sweet flavors all around. I got a taste of cloves as I first took a sip and it ended with the taste of bananas that comes with the type of yeast that is used to brew this beer.
M: A very light and smooth mouthfeel. There is no hint of alcohol and you can easily down several of these without even realizing it. 
O: If you are looking for the best wheat beer in the world, I would strongly recommend picking a six pack of these up. It is the best example of a Bavarian Hefe Weissbier out there and you owe yourself the experience that this beer will provide. I am rating this beer as a wheat beer and therefore I'll give it a perfect 5/5 in all categories because this is what other wheat beers want to be. After almost 1,000 years of brewing it makes sense that the flavor and quality of this beer is where it is. 1,316 charactersWeston19, Jul 30, 2013

Pours huge standard hefe head.
Smells or banana and clove.
Taste is pour banana and clove with a little breadiness. Absolutely delicious.
Mouthfeel is nice and light.
In all this is the perfect grilling beer or setting out on the patio. The best representation of a Hefeweizen from one of the worlds oldest breweries. 343 charactersAverwo, Jul 20, 2013

4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A: Opaque light gold, taking care with the pour into a tall Stella Artois glass as head could easily plume over. With control got a dense finger thick head that lingered and remained thick and clingy at the edges.
S: Smooth pleasant sweet banana bread. Lots of fragrance especially after pouring when head was still present. Others present but I cant pick them out yet. Remained pleasantly fragrant to the very end.
T: A swirl of banana and I presume clove, takes noticably longer for all the flavors to rise and fall than most beers. No one thing is overly dominant, everything cooperates. Low but complementary bitterness that is only really noticable when modest carbonation bring it out during the flavor swell.
M: Slightly syrupy and clingy, wants to hang around a bit. Modest carbonation tingles the tounge while the whole mouth gets coated with the wheaty malt.
O: This is very close to perfection. Easily the best hefeweizen I've ever had and what's more the best beer or any type I've ever had to date even over my own homebrew. Simply astounding and what the beer experience should be. 1,099 charactersfizzgig, Jul 18, 2013

The aroma is just spot on. Big banana, clove, some lemon, orange.
The flavor follows with a refreshing banana, clove, and a hint of orange/lemon.
The beer has a good smooth mouthfeel that cleans off the palate nicely.
This beer has a really good amount of flavor and really sets the standard for the style. Still, not mindblowing, but just really well done. A bit lighter on the mouthfeel than I possibly prefer. 466 charactersdar482, Jul 14, 2013

Appearance - Hazy golden beer with decadent pillows as a cream head. Head recedes to substantial cap reminiscent of cumulus clouds. Wispy top remains through serving.. Brilliant.
Smell - Clove bubblegum, banana and coriander going on. Also maybe a hint of orange and maybe even just the faintest notion of smoke for added complexity. Bubblegum sweetness more prevalent on second and third sniffs.
Taste - The clove really comes through here with fermented banana. The bubblegum sweetness is a supporting figure here as is the orange peel. Sweetness is modest but just right. Tiny amount of hops noticeable adding to the great complexity. Slight aftertaste laves you only wanting more.
Mouthfeel - Perfect. Medium / high carbonation gives a rich, creamy feel but the beer remains astonishingly light given the array of flavors and decent level of booze. Extremely refreshing left with clean plate. Also wet, while retaining the flavors extremely quaffable in mere moments.
Overall - Spectacular beer, one of the top three I've ever had. Also has sentimental value as this was the beer that turned me on to trying all sorts beers instead of the standard non-beer advocate's drink list. Not much else to be said that hasn't already been said about this beer, other than this brew represents beer royalty at its finest. 1,385 charactersDenisKolkin, Jul 12, 2013

A- clean and clear until you do the good ol' swirl and dump. Doesn't cloud up as much as some, but still nice. Big poofy white head abouds.
S - big notes of spicy banana with some bubble gum notes. Nice, and not over the top.
T- Nice, approachable, but slightly muted notes that follow the nose.
M- light-medium with a wheat oriented smoothness. Carbonation is a bit prickly. 
O- A great introduction to those who haven't really had the style. Pretty much a baseline for Hefe's. I do however prefer Franzy. 550 charactersJWU, Jul 08, 2013

Bottle pours a slightly hazy, golden straw colour - more filtered than I expected. Spot-on aroma of German yeast and malted grains, barley and wheat well proportioned. Flavour starts sweet and wheat-forward, with a yeast-forward body and a nicely clean, crisp finish.
Not a beer that I would personally choose on a regular basis, as I'm not a fan of the yeast or grain bill, but it is definitely well brewed. The oldest brewery in the world fully deserves its iconic status! 531 charactershopsolutely, Jul 04, 2013

A: Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a quite explosive soapy white head, about a half inch in length, that dissipated fairly fast and dissipated to a thin white ring. 
S: Good aroma, smells of wheat, malts, spices, coriander, very fresh
T: Absolutely delicious, very smooth, fairly sweet, tastes of yeast, wheat, malts, has a good spiciness to it
M: Extremely well balanced, mild carbonation, packed with flavor, medium body, great for a day like today. 
O: Overall, I've had a couple from Weihenstephaner and I've been relatively impressed every time and today is no different. Reasonable cost, about $10 a six pack, I've had pretty bad beers for the same cost, though it varies by store. Hands down recommended by me.

Appearance - The color of corn. Murky. Big head but it disappeared pretty quickly.
Smell - Malt. Salt water taffy (sweet). Sour.
Taste - Not to be repetitive but I taste malt and taffy. I also detect a very Belgian sour flavor (Is this because of the yeast?). Very tasty!
Mouth - Smooth and buttery. Fine yet prominent carbonation. A very substantial brew. 
Overall - Delicious! I'm new to the whole hefeweissbier thing (the Shock Top/Blue Moon phenomenon has been a bit of a turn-off). Shame on me for waiting so long. I'm still not going to put a lemon wedge in my beer, though. 659 charactersT100Mark, Jun 27, 2013

A - Pours a dark cloudy yellow with three fingers of puffy white head.
S - Clove, banana, some spice hit the nose. Light wheat aroma in there as well.
T - The taste is spice and clove up front. Some more wheat and light banana mid palate. Truly a classic Hefe here, yummy stuff!
M - Mouthfeel is light to medium, medium to high carbonation. Smooth beer as well.
O - I thought I might rate this a bit higher, the flavor is great but the Hefe is a bit heavy on the finish. Still a very good beer if not the best Hefe out there. Great beer to have in the summer. Recommended! Cheers! 645 charactersfitrock2112, Jun 25, 2013

rich yeast flavors, sofy spicy, with fruity banana tones,
reminiscent of clove, very balanced wheat beer. 
Washes down easy and lasting tasting notes.
Nice carbonation and good colour and a medium bodied beer.
Tasted from a bottle and tap, both are just as good. personally prefer the bottle cos you can control the pour / head and more importantly the goodness that's left at the bottom. 419 charactersxtonemonkey, Jun 20, 2013

Pours a beautiful hazy straw with hints of orange.
 
Smells of powdery yeast, sweet ripe bananas, and a touch of clove.
Taste great.  Just superb.  The crisp powdery hefe is refreshing, with the sweetness and spiciness playing well against each other and some subtle hops rounding out the flavor.
 
Mouthfeel was spot on.  Full but not thick.  The yeast in suspension helps create that illusion of fullness without thickness in my opinion. 
Overall, certainly deserving of its world class status for the Hefes, and I consider this a go to in the summer months when I want to mix it up from the hoppy IPAs.  663 characterstaylor714914, Jun 19, 2013

A: Cloudy, pale orange-yellow color. Dense, creamy, and glorious head starts out thick and lustrous, but eventually fades to about an inch, leaving marvelous white lacing down the glass.
S: Sweet yeast and malt upfront. Lemony citrus hits the back of the nostrils. A very light, airy scent overall.
T: Man, oh man... This one is lovely. Clove is very apparent as the beer touches your tongue. Leaves as quick as it arrived. Very yeasty with hints of lemon dancing around, almost as if the yeast and lemon are ballroom dancing in your mouth. Not a whole lot of bitterness from the hops is noticeable. Finishes clean and smooth. Slight twangs of alcohol remain after the beer has gone down.
F: Medium to full bodied. The carbonation is mild and well-controlled. Drinkability on this one is very high. I could knock a few back without effort.
O: I have to admit, I was as skeptical as you could be on this one... There's a local bar that serves German ales and this one is always the one being praised to no end. My skepticism has been put aside. This brew is every bit phenomenal as you hear. A must try, I must say! 1,165 charactersThePaintedGrey, Jun 17, 2013

Some hints of citrus, very low hops flavor, was better ice cold as opposed to the 46 - 52 the bottle advised. 11.2 oz bottle, the six-pack cost almost ten dollars. I would classify it as a good beer, but certainly not the 98 it is getting here. It tastes like a seasonal, flavored offering to me. Maybe around the holidays with all of the other clove type spices and flavors.?? 452 charactersparkerti, Jun 14, 2013

Purchased: Single from Craft Brewed, Nashville
A: Massive head of white sits on the cloudy, honey-colored beer, with lots of streaming bubbles seen in the glass. Excellent lacing and superb head retention.
S: Aromas are of sweet malts, banana, cloves and a bit of bubblegum.
T: Light wheat malts make for a somewhat sweet beer, but not overly so. Very light bitterness, with also some lemon citrus fruit notes.
M: Moderate amount of carbonation, with a creamy mouthfeel and medium body. It finishes sweet, crisp and refreshing, with some aftertastes of citrus and banana.
O: Nothing fancy but hits all the high notes for a wonderful overall experience! 767 characterssommersb, Jun 14, 2013

S-Yeasty (smells like Belgian yeast), bready, coriander, hints of banana and clove, and lemon zest.
T-Similar to the nose as coriander, banana, clove, and lemon zest stand out along side the yeast.
It tasted somewhat watery, but tasty and refreshing.
M-Kind of thin and nicely carbonated.
D-I could drink this all day. It tastes delicious and its so light and refreshing. 454 charactersthegodfather2701, Jun 14, 2013

In the glass it’s got style and beauty. The nose is bracing and not run away with fruity sweetness. Banana, wheat , earthy yeast, fruits, clove and as it warms a little - some pepper. The palate is immaculate with tall wheat, sweet biscuit and citric hops. It’s clean and civilized. Leaves with a small taste of alcohol and drier and drier as it drinks. A resounding hefe that dares to growl a little in the glass. 496 charactersutopiajane, Jun 11, 2013

It pours a hazy, cloudy gold color with a puffy, fluffy white head.
Smells of dry hay, earth, citrus zest, malt and mild gin blend and mingle.
The flavor is at first sweet citrus. A taste of buttery biscuits and mixed citrus follows close behind. The tastes expand into many minor yet noticeable directions. Sweet crisp apples, spices, cut grass, minerals and a mild boozy vodka taste all add to the complexity.
This is one very gulpable hefe! The spritzy effervescence dissipates rather quickly, and for my personal tastes, it improves as it rests. It's one fluid and smooth brew.
My favorite Hefeweizen! 659 charactersBeerResearcher, Jun 11, 2013

Sweet honey wheaty smell. 
Great Weizen taste. 
So insanely drinkable, perfect carbonation. World’s Oldest Brewery obviously knows what they are doing. 
Edit: Revisited as part of a blind test against Ayinger. Pour was murky yellow, hazy. Very sweet gum and banana smell. The head was taller and fluffier than Ayinger. Sweet, good carbonation, smooth, clean, and crisp. Overall, still a delicious and prime example of a German Hefe. 474 charactersSmurf2055, Jun 10, 2013
4.74/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A - The beer arrived in a pilsner glass with two inches of creamy foam atop a gorgeous hazy blonde pillar of goodness. Retention lasted all the way to the bottom and the lacing was excellent.
S - What the? I'm a newbie here, so I did not expect the Belgian smell from a German Hefe. Smells fantastic!
T - I'm floored. The full flavor is there, but it doesn't hit like a truck, it's more subtle and long-lasting. I don't yet have the vocabulary for a proper review.
M - Bubbly pillows. This beer is medium-bodied, but with the strong carbonation it still feels lively in my mouth.
O - This is way more than I expected when I ordered it. The only reason I didn't put up 5's is my lack of experience. This beer is going to be like Heady Topper was for IPA's - it's going to set me out on the hunt for beers like this one. I wonder if I'll find one. 849 charactersAndrew041180, Jun 10, 2013

I like banana and this is prevalent in this beer. Although banana is typically in heff beers. I bought my bottle for a little under $3 and it's the best $3 I've ever spent.

S - Strong banana notes waft out, mixed with milder lemon scents. A beautifully mellow and sweet aroma. Slight floral notes.
T - A fantastic blend for a Weissbier. First, those banana notes are strongly present on the tongue. Just enough hops and citrus balance it out to keep it from being overly malted. Some yeast and wheat flavor provide a backbone. Fruity and slightly bitter without sourness.
M - Extremely smooth, very easy going.
O - This could easily be a daily Weissbier, if it were more accessible. I really don't have any complaints or suggested improvements; it's just a well-rounded, balanced, sweet beer. 723 charactersRoguer, Jun 08, 2013
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Hazy, straw-colored, with a large, fluffy head. Foam clings nicely to the sides of the glass. Characteristic chalky, yeasty aroma. Clove is present as you'd expect, while a citric hop note adds some nice complexity.
Flavor is dry with a cracker-like malt profile. Clove and a bit of banana, plus a mild bitterness throughout. Clean, dry finish. Carbonation is vigorous while remaining quite soft and smooth. A bit of overall citric character. Exceedingly refreshing and "drinkable."
While Weihenstephan's hefe is very highly regarded, I wasn't really blown away by it, but then I admit to the style not being one of favorites. Still, it's as good as or better than any other hefe I've yet had, and it's something I'll be revisiting during the warm weather months. 765 charactersgr0g, Jun 07, 2013

Served: April 2013
Appearance: Magnificent, opaque golden yellow that just looks smooth and inviting. Poured slowly into the glass to avoid the monster heads from the wheat and yeast in Hefeweizen. Head settled to a healthy two and a half fingers and very slowly dissipated over the course of drinking the beer.
Smell: Fresh, banana-y, clean, welcoming. A lot of people smell/taste clove in Hefeweizen and I'm definitely not getting any of that. The banana smell, though present, is subtle and not overpowering.
Taste: Like the smell, it tastes just slightly banana-y, from the yeast used. The yeast adds a nice, somewhat bready backbone to the beer. This beer is made to let the yeast shine- there is very little, if any, hop presence, and the malt backbone is light, allowing the yeast's flavoring effects (banana, 'clove') to come through the beer. I could drink this one all day, it is simply so refreshing- simple, but still noteworthy in its ability to so perfectly balance its flavors.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and fuzzy from the yeast and carbonation. Makes it all the more refreshing.
Overall: This is probably one of the best beers I've had, and the gold-standard for the Hefeweizen style.
Other: This style is pronounced "HAY-fuh-vai-tsehn" in German, not 'HEH-fuh' as many Americans say. 1,357 charactersBeric, Jun 01, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This just might be my favorite beer of all time.
Poured from a 1L bottle I purchased at RSVP for $2.50.
The beer pours with a HUGE head that just wont quit. It is creamy, off-white and sits on top of a bright, straw-colored body.
Nose is slightly banana-clove like, but not in an offensive way. Even stronger than the banana-clove smell is an incredibly strong yeasty/bready note, it almost smells like loaf of bread dough.
The taste is strongly yeasty and bready, must like the nose. This is a definitely a hefeweizen and a very, very good one at that. The mouthfeel is perhaps the best characteristic of this beer, it is thick and chewy with lots of suspended yeast. 
A MUST buy for any hefeweizen lover and something I will be purchasing a lot of, especially at the price! 780 charactersBowdoinbeerboy, May 29, 2013

A: This beer looks great. Cloudy, pale gold color with huge fizzy white head. Retention is excellent.
S: Yeast, wheat, cloves, citrus, banana. 
T: And incredibly balanced hefeweizen. Front of the tongue is lots of banana, spices and sugar. On the back there is a great malt backbone that reminds me of freshly baked bread that you rip apart and devour.
M: Excellent. This beer was made for hot summer days. Nicely carbonated, and drinkability is through the roof.
O: For how good it tastes imported, I can't imagine having a fresh pour from the brewery. An excellent example, and perhaps THE example of a German hefeweizen. 641 charactershoppytobehere, May 29, 2013

One whif and there was no question about this being a European beer and isolating to a German style. The aroma is always there, not hoppy, not malty, not full of yeast, but a pleasant combination of them all.
Knowing this was a wheat beer, I anticipated besides the cloudiness, all the spices that you normally find in wheat beer, the orange, coriander, etc. 
Not with this one, oh, I knew it was a wheat beer, so refreshing, but the spices were down played. Instead the concentration was on the beer itself. 
Not one piece, but a sum of its parts. 607 charactersrdilauro, May 24, 2013

S: smells spot on for a great hefe. Really nice lemon zest and lots of yeasty banana clove. 
T: the wheat dominate the front half of the beer and the lemony banana clove follows suit. I'm also getting hints of spice but its difficult to distinguish exactly what.
M: very refreshing. light and some good carbonation. What you would expect from a hefe.
O: light feel and a delicious crisp refreshing taste. Perfect beer for summer and at this price point, I think I found my fall back for the summer. 615 charactersFcolle2, May 23, 2013

Aroma smells cleanly of banana and clove, with perhaps a hint of what smells like coriander. Flavor matches the nose, with banana and clove complementing a refined wheat flavor. The wheat becomes most pronounced in the finish, while the front end remains more juicy. Yeast character lends some nice complexity and texture as well. The mouthfeel is spectacular, with lively, velvety carbonation that caresses the palate and enhances the quintessential flavors of the beer. This is the hefeweizen to which all other hefeweizens are compared. It's supremely balanced, perfectly executed, and possessed of perhaps the most enjoyable mouthfeel of any beer, regardless of style--undoubtedly world class. 762 charactersMaximalC, May 16, 2013

The aroma is loaded with clove, banana, bubble gum, orange peel and wheat bread. 
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft on the palate, somewhat watery with mild carbonation. The flavor begins sweet with lots of banana and bubblegum. Some orange citrus followed by clove and a little pepper balance out the sweetness. It finishes dry with lingering sweetness and clove.
This is a very tasty beer that's great on a hot summer day. Pour it into a hefeweizen glass if you have one. It's the only way to appreciate this brew. 699 charactersWanderingFool, May 04, 2013

** It should be noted that I poured a small amount and sampled, decided it was excellent enough to harvest the yeast for my upcoming Hefeweizen homebrew, and decided to not swirl the last inch and pour all the yeast into my glass, as appropriate for the style.**
A - Glowing, but hazy gold yellow. giant head. frothy. chuncky.
S - Fresh banana, sweet banana taffy
T - earthy, yet still fresh yeast. A squeeze of lemon and orange juice. Low Fat banana nut bread. Delicious! Clove. White pepper. A touch of Lysol Lemon, which sounds bad, but is actually pleasant here! It does dry out a little near the end in a way that reminds my of a saison.
(None of that processed fake bubblegum sweetness that I hate)

Taste - Wow. Orange right away. The banana and spice comes in closer to the finish. Not certain what the spices are, maybe some pepper. It's mostly oranges that I'm tasting tho. Delicious.

overall: Best Hefeweizen out there, period. For the style, it is absolutely perfect. In order I would say it goes Weihenstephaner, Franziskaner, then Paulaner as the best authentic german hefe's.

Mouthfeel: Spritzy and decent carbonation.
This is it. King of the Hefeweizens. It's a beautiful, creamy, cloudy, light orange colored delight. The head quickly goes away, but the thin lace that is left is bigger than most and a chunkiness sticks to the sides of the glass. The taste follows the smell almost exactly the same. It is so balanced. Banana and bubblegum don't overwhelm. The spicy and pepper notes lace the predominant lemon and wheat goodness. I will get this again. 727 charactersTeamMathis, May 01, 2013

A: Golden yellow and hazy topped with a tower of microbubbles which settles to an ample pillow of white foam.
S: Light, buttered bread and crackers topped with banana and hint of mango. There is a good amount of pepper and clove spiciness to keep things balanced.
T: The banana esters come through initially with a faint tropical fruit note which is more subdued compared to the nose. The bready, buttery, and biscuity malt adds a nice smoothness to the entire palate. Black pepper kernels and clove build to the finish hand-in-hand with a moderate earthy bitterness.
M: The carbonation adds a wonderful smoothness to the feel which is overall light and and lively. 
O: The touchstone of Bavarian Hefeweizens and a thoroughly enjoyable and wonderfully flavorful beer. A perfect beverage for the warm seasons that are here. 848 charactersElSid, Apr 29, 2013

A - Cloudy golden brown body topped with a meringue-like head. Carbonation is strong and lasting, lacing down the glass is excellent.
S- Benchmark hefe smell; dried wheat, banana, clove and muddled citrus.
T - Slightly sweet and sour with the banana and clove present throughout. Topped off with a citrus tang.
M- Expertly done throughout.
O - The benchmark Hefe. Can find a lot of more expensive ones, but not many better ones! 541 charactersbambam2517, Apr 22, 2013

a: Golden yellow with a fair bit of cloudiness too it. 
s: Smell for this one is more subtle than I was expecting, but it is a pleasant one.
t: This is where the beer excels. Perfect balance of all the flavors, no one flavor is left out to dry. From the initial flavors to the back pallet the various flavors come to the foreground at one point or another. Love it.
m: Full. The carbonation lasted throughout the experience.
o: I honestly don't see anywhere this beer could improve and for that, I need to give it a 5. overall. 710 charactersEither_Aether, Apr 21, 2013

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Aroma - Complex and well balanced yeast character. Moderate banana esters with light bubblegum notes combined with medium light clove phenols. Light grainy malt aroma. No hop aroma, ok for style. No dms. No diacetyl.
Appearance - Dark straw hue. Hazy (ok for style). Thick moussy white head that firmly persists.
Flavor - Moderate grainy malt sweetness; low hop bitterness balances the malt well. No noble (earthy) hop flavor detected, ok for style. Wonderfully balanced yeast character with moderately high banana esters, moderate bubblegum esters and moderately low clove phenols. Finishes dry. No DMS or diacetyl detected.
Mouthfeel - Medium light body with moderately high carbonation giving a mild prickly sensation on the tongue. No alcohol warmth, ok for style. Sharp, not creamy. Not astringent.
Overall Impression: A wonderful bouquet of yeast character coupled with a well balanced backdrop of malt and hops. Refreshing. Perhaps a little too much carbonation creating that overly sharp/prickly feeling. Could reduce priming sugar or co2 slightly. 1,060 charactersEthenWithAnE, Apr 19, 2013

Smells is not too big. Subtle, simple, and clean. I can pick up on some citrus, wheat, yeast, and banana. There may be some touches of hay and vanilla.
Taste is phenomenal. Wow is this a refreshing beer. Bright notes of orange zest, clove, wheat, banana, and cream--although the mouth feel may just be tricking my senses.
Highly carbonated, light-medium body, crisp, refreshing, and creamy... I don't know what else you could want from this style.
Overall, this is superb and super affordable. My favorite hefeweizen, for sure. 713 characterslunarbrew, Apr 11, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: An outstanding head on the pour. Thick creamy head that was about a half a finger throughout after the beer settled. A merky cloudy look to the beer. Some of the most furiously active carbonation I've seen in a brew. Just simply looks outstanding.
Smell: Perfectly clean yeast explodes out of the glass. Bananas, clove, prairie grass, buttery yeast, and fruity undertones. Such an outstandingly profound aroma that really makes you remember this brew. 
Taste: The balanced yeast comes in right away at the front. The yeast tingles throughout the body of the brew. The complexity of the brew is fantastic but at the same time comes together so well. A banana and overall fruity taste lingers for so long on the palette. There is a slight dryness during the aftertaste with a completely exotic fruit taste. Wonderful.
Mouthfeel: Yeast dryness. Medium bodied overall which makes this a very easy going drinking experience. 
Overall: The fact that everyone calls this such a classic brew is a testament to how wonderful this brew is. A classic that is great for those with a wonderfully developed palette or those who are just breaking into the craft scene. Extremely inexpensive for where this beer comes from. 1,223 charactersKFBR392, Apr 10, 2013

S- Esters, yeasty, lemon, banana, bubble gum. Pretty big aroma. Spice at the end.
T- yeasty as the nose indicates. Huge clove. Malty wheat, bubble gum. Smooth and delicious. Slight citrus notes detected. We have a near perfect amount of goodness going on here. Not tart like some of this style can be, but a nice peppery finish. Beautiful balance.
M- Mid body. Smooth start that seems to get drier as this goes down. Wonderful carbonation.

 Orange, lemon, and coriander form the initial aroma, supported well on a backbone of wheat. Tangerine and apple and banana yeast esters add complexity. Clove becomes evident as it warms.
Flavor is fairly yeasty, with a bready, slightly dry toasted malt finish that cuts things a little short. Underlying esters of bananas and bubblegum accent the citrus notes of tangerine and orange pith. Coriander and clove are somewhat subtle. 
Body is moderate, with fairly high carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.
Good yeast esters and a surprisingly bready backbone. Fairly complex, but wish the flavor lingered more. 759 charactersbarczar, Apr 02, 2013

4.11/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25330 mL bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Bottled on July 17, 2013.
Appearance: Pours a very hazy straw color. Carbonation streams aggressively up the glass. Pour results in a four finger, creamy white head which becomes rocky as it settles. Excellent head retention and lacing. Very good looking hefeweizen.
Smell: Big ripe banana aroma immediately hits the nose. This is followed by a sweet, bubblegum note and finishes with an earthy, spicy character (very clove like).
Taste: A lot of the wheat character hits at first, gradually taking on the fruity, banana notes. Similar to the nose, this picks up a slight bubblegum sweetness before finishing strongly with earthy, clove taste.
Mouthfeel: Medium body to this as it travels through the mouth. The carbonation is evident as it scrubs over the tongue, cleansing the palate very nicely. Finishes with an inviting, warmth from the spice. Sticky, but smooth, and very easy to drink and refreshing.
Overall: This is an excellent example of a wheat beer. Readily available at reasonably priced ($10.99 in my area for a 6 pack), but at times can be difficult to find fresh. A classic and absolutely worth a try. 1,181 charactershermit990, Mar 23, 2013

The appearance is beautiful, great head retention, good carbonation, and a beautiful, pale orange color to the body. 
The smell is like sweet bread, overall not overpowering: just like a Weissbier ought to be. 
The taste is very similar to the smell, but with light banana and vanilla flavors as well.
The mouthfeel is extremely smooth leaving you wanting more.
There are many Weissbiers in the World today and it still very clear to me why the State of Bavaria chose this Brewery to be their official representation of the style. Absolutely wonderful.

I was very excited to try this given it's sparkling reputation.
A: Pours a hazy deep golden color, almost orange with a 3 finger thick white head that is well retained, slight to moderate lacing. Certainly a beautiful beer to look at.
S: Strong on the banana, clove and bubblegum with a little peppery spice and citrus fruit as well. The aroma is very appealing.
T: Yeasty- wheat, with banana and clove (although not a strong as in the smell), some citrus fruit with biscuit-malt at the end. The taste is very well balanced, nothing dominates...a special experience in my mouth.
M: Light to moderate with good carbination. A lot going on in there...beer is popping around on my tongue.
O: Truly an outstanding hefeweizen - it did not disappoint. While this isn't my favorite style, the goodness cannot be denied and the drinkability factor is very high. I may have just found my go-to beer for the upcoming summer months.

One of the best looking beers on the planet, really. Intensely cloudy, pale, gold-colored elixir. Carbonation moves up the glass beautifully.
Smells great. Wheat, esters, banana.
Tastes amazing. The benchmark for hefes. Banana, bubblegum esters, slight wheat bitterness, floral hops, slight malt flavor.
The carbonation is basically perfect. Very smooth, goes down so easy.
The perfect wheat beer. I'll be damned if I find a better one. 554 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 06, 2013

3.28/5  rDev -25.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Food Pairing - (1) Fried eggs with steamed spinach on an asiago cheese bagel played well with the beer. (2) Medium-cheddar cheese was ok, wish I had some sharp cheese though. (3) Fresh banana was a surprisingly poor pairing, and gave the beer a powerful kale taste/sensation in the nose which was, not surprisingly, unpleasant.
A - Cloudy gold/yellow-orange. Glorious fluffy head left its mark after each swallow & never completely disappeared.
S - Nothing remarkable for the style, but certainly nothing off-putting
T - Similar to the taste, I was impressed by how seemingly unremarkable this beer is for the style- clove, wheat, yeast, all expected- with the exception of the fact that no one flavor dominates. There's a good balance here. 
M - Sense of balance is especially present here. Nothing is out of place. Finishes a bit dry, but not parching, encouraging further tasting. Easy to drink.
O - I was excited to try this beer. Heck, it's the #1 rated Hefeweizen on the site after withstanding thousands of reviews. I can understand why, for this style, many consider this to be the best of the best: clearly there's an artistry to the elegance of this beer's execution. It's just very unfortunate that I don't find that terribly exciting. 1,246 charactersChugMan, Mar 04, 2013

The taste represents the genre well. It's almost a little sour, but this beer has a more malty sweet and citrusy undertone of flavor that enriches this beer into something special. I find a little alcohol presence and medicine like flavors reminiscent of this genre. A little too fizzy for me. 
This beer pairs will with sounds of Gunter Sommer on his with the group Poire_z on either cds entitled + or Q. 511 charactersfrankiepop, Mar 04, 2013

S: The nose is sweet with notes of banana, clove, lemon, and mild melon. This beer smells great.
T: It's sweet to start with a light malt base, and big banana and clove notes. Those flavors last through to the finish, where I get bit of yeast, but nothing too crazy.

A: Hazy gold, low amount of visible carbonation, with a one-finger white head.
S: Fruity yeast esters, cracker and wheat malt, and notes of apricot in the background.
T: Follows the nose very nicely. Yeast fruity esters (apricot, pear, apple, banana), nice sweet biscuit malt, all leading to a somewhat dry finish.
M: Light body, good carbonation sensation, low alcohol presence.
O: Not my favorite style but this is example is quite tasty. One of the best hefeweizens I've had. 552 charactersmacrosmatic, Feb 11, 2013

The Weihenstephaner is my favorite wheat beer, with notes of banana and bubblegum, and a smooth, clean finish. No need to add a slice of citrus to this beer, as its full of flavor, and requires nothing more. 295 charactersTypicalAshley, Feb 09, 2013

2.81/5  rDev -36.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5Disappointment truly is a hard thing to swallow and in this case somewhat literally. As a lover of beer and all that it has to offer, I sometimes find myself at odds with my worldly and often better educated beer peers. While some revel in the rebel spirit, I find more often than not that rebels are simply ignorant of the point and rebel for the simple sake of rebellion. I like to think that with the years I've grown in both taste and the ability to see the positions of others. However in this case, I must simply disagree.
Weihenstephaner's Hefeweizen(for my peers outside of old Europe) is highly regarded and it appears to be seen as a genre defining creation. However I wonder, who defines this genre? Does it change with time? And finally isn't enjoyment ultimately the thing that matters most? Coming from the northwest region of the United States, I find Hefeweizens to be mostly defined as a cloudy citrusy affair with a bright white head. However recently I've found newer breweries bringing back more of those delicious banana and clove tones that I so adore. Which is why I am so disappointed in this genre "original".
Appearance is exceptional for the genre and quite appealing visually with its mysterious orange yellow body and glass clinging white head. The smell is quite good as well if not a bit subdued. When we reach the taste though, this beer goes south immediately with a strangely aggressive carbonation. From there one is reminded somewhat of a pilsner with a lemon wedge on the side and to top it off, it leaves with a hint of iron and bitterness drying your tongue. Where is the banana? Where are the cloves? I want my smooth mouthfeel and delightful characters damn it! Instead I'm left with a mediocre beer that languishes and slowly warms much to my disinterest. 
To be fair though, where I'm at is nearly half way around the world from this beers origin and perhaps I may have gotten a bad bottle or two. I've always said, "fresh beer is best beer". Though to play devils advocate, I have had an exceptional hefeweizen from the same area, in the same bottle and stored in the same manner with nary a complaint. I don't know, all I do know is I don't get this beer, I don't want this beer and will not be having it again anytime soon when so many more exciting and satisfying options surround me.

I include this with each bottle/can review because I feel that for the average consumer to even approach an unknown beer, it's the packaging that entices rather than the actual end product. Points and half points are given for Style, Readability, Tasting Note, Brewers Notes and Ease of Bottle Reuse. 2,647 charactersDrinkingWithCruthers, Feb 05, 2013

I was also an idiot and drank it straight from the bottle but that didn't stop it from being delicious. Bought a single from Wegmans for about $3. My first impressions likened this beer to fresh banana bread with some clove, and it was very smooth and easy to drink. Had a good combination of bitterness and sweetness that was both subtle and pleasant in character. A definite treat and the best wheat beer I’ve tried to this date. 628 charactersFusion7777, Feb 02, 2013

Body is cloudy, but light does shine through, and you can see carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head lingers for awhile, but doesn't leave much lacing.
S- Bananas, bubble gum, citrus, wheat, doughy bread.
T- Very nice wheat flavor gives way to flavors of citrus, banana, bubble gum and lemon bread. Subtle, but very nice flavors.
M- Excellent mouthfeel. While light-medium bodied with medium carbonation, the mouthfeel is almost full to the point of seeming chewy. Very nice balance and drinkability.
O- Great beer. I overlooked this one for a while, but it really is exceptional. 685 charactersstephenjmoore, Feb 01, 2013

A – Big foamy head, bright chalky white. Very nice lacing is left. Beer itself is a cloudy yellow with some honey-amber darkness to it.
S – Bright lemon zest, some banana as well. Crisp cracker yeastiness to it as well. A little spice, coriander, clove. 
T – Yeast, banana, cracker. Lemon zest and citrus. Light malt characteristic, but dominated by the lemon/banana notes.
M – Well balanced, somewhat sweet and sticky; very refreshing. Nice, crisp and smooth.
O – Very drinkable, great representation of the style. Quite impressive that this beer is always top notch. Better on tap, but the availability of the bottles is great. 684 charactersMoose90, Jan 22, 2013
4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 50 cl bottle into a Golden Monkey Goblet.
Appearance: Pours an amber/gold color and leaves behind a big, fluffy head of several fingers. Looks like a terribly satisfying beer.
Smell: Banana hits the nose first, along with other fruity notes - maybe some pear, apricot. Cloves and maybe some light corn. Smells good.
Taste: The taste matches the smell surprisingly well which is very nice. Banana and clove notes mixed with some honey and wheat. The finish is what separates this from other hefes - supremely smooth and crisp finish. Delicious.
Mouth-feel: Perfect amount of carbonation, superbly well-balanced body, not too light and not too thick or sticky. 
Overall: After trying a wide variety of hefeweizens, I find this one to be the top dog. This is one of the most refreshing brews I have had the privilege of tasting, and I consider it to be at the top of its class. 893 charactersResuin, Jan 22, 2013

Glass: Pilsner glass 
From: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, Calif., on Jan. 5, 2013
Price: $3.49 
Misc.: Part of the bottle reads “Brewed under the purity law, of 1516.”
Poured a golden orange, slightly hazy color with at least four fingers of soft rocky white head. Lots of head. Minimal lacing with great retention.
Smelled cloves, banana and honey up front, followed by some slightly corn and skunky malts with a whiff of vomit. Could smell the carbonation.
Tasted much better than the smell. Got cloves, spices and banana with a sweet aftertaste. Light lemon grass as well. Just fantastic.
Light body. Oily texture. Lively (above average) carbonation. Long finish.
Just a fantastic hefeweizen and another damn good beer by Weihenstephaner. I’m not too into hefe’s, but I’d be willing to reconsider after having this. 856 charactersBucannonXC5, Jan 18, 2013

Medium to thin body with a spirited level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. This is a really nice beer! I guess if you've been doing this that long you are bound to get it right. 606 charactersjohnnnniee, Jan 13, 2013
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drinking one of these after a long rewarding day at work. Mmmm!
Glass: Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.
Appearance: A beautiful hazy yellow amber color. I stirred up the yeast at the bottom before my final pour. Watching the yeast drop down through the beer and slowly mix is one of the best parts of a hefeweizen! If poured aggressively, a huge head appears and sticks around for quite a while. I prefer to give it a gentle pour to keep the head in check (it's still substantial, even with a gentle pour) and keep a bit more of that refreshing carbonation around.
Smell: Bubblegum, RIPE bananas are the major smells here. A bit of breadiness and honey, perhaps. Delicious.
Taste: Just like a good hefeweizen should. This is my favorite hefeweizen that I have tried so far. The initial taste is like that of bubblegum. A bit of banana, but not as much as the smell would suggest. There is a tiny bit of breadiness in there. None of the "Wit" type flavors that found in some hefeweizens, particularly American ones. Very little alcohol noticed, which is to be expected.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with high carbonation. Really refreshing.
Overall: My first perfect 5 beer, and one that will always remain a favorite of mine. Nothing quite beats it as an easy drinking all around tasty beer. 1,285 charactersChrisKayler, Jan 12, 2013

Appearance (5.0): Unfiltered and to me, exactly like what a hefeweizen should look like.
Smell (4.5): Fresh and clean, with the banana like hint. Perhaps maybe it could be a little more pronounced.
Taste (4.75): Again, fresh clean. To me, this is what a hefeweizen should be.
Mouthfeel (4.75): Nice and smooth.
Overall (5.00): Though I've had many hefeweizen, this is actually my first and highly anticipated time having the celebrated Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. It did not fail. There were no defects in the beer, it tasted great.
If you even remotely enjoy hefeweizens, you should try this out. If you're not a fan, but haven't tried Weihenstephaner, then give it a try! 720 charactersjibjib513, Jan 08, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ah yes, the standard Hefeweizen to which all other hefe's are compared. The question becomes, should I review this to style? Or should I review this to my opinion? How do I question the paradigm hefe when it is so established? Well, I'll rate this to style, and of course it will be a perfect score. However, my review will reflect the fact that wheat beers do not appeal to me. Let us begin.
Poured from the bottle into a Weihenstephan hefe glass, complete with the twirl and twist at the end of the pour. Hazy golden hay colored, or perhaps even banana colored when held to the light. Beautiful foamy white head that piles up over the top of the glass. The aromas are of that characteristic wheaty twang, bananas (but much less than what some of my friends describe as "holy cow this smells like banana!"), bit of clove and spice, and a yeasty goodness that wraps up the aromas nicely. The flavors are very much like that of the aromas. A very slight hint of earth in the finish. Well carbonated and light bodied. Makes for a good summer beer.
Now, I must admit that I do not like wheat beers. The wheat twang kills it for me. If I were to rate this to my opinion, it would be 5/3/3/3/3, where my 5 would be given to the presentation of the beer. Take that as you will, I suppose. 1,284 charactersDmanGTR, Jan 06, 2013

A - significant foam head that is a chalky white in color; nice lacing; straw-yellow in color; some cloudiness present
S - smells like a dried biscuit; has some banana and clove notes; a little bit of Belgian yeast and just a hint of orange peel and fruit syrup
T - bananas; a touch of bubble gum; biscuit; wheat; lightly malty
M - really solid balance of flavor, sweetness, and carbonation; very light-bodied; crispy; perfect to enjoy in the summer
O - this is really one of the best 'globally' available hefes you're ever going to find; the balance, crispiness, smooth flavor profile, and general drinkability are all admirable. 692 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Jan 03, 2013

Smell consistent with good wheat beers, with a fresh subtle scent of hops, and fruit cocktail.
Taste was well balanced and refreshing. It is smooth like the golden color it exhibits.
This will pair well with the barbequed pizza I made from scratch (Sundried Tomato, Carmelized peppers and pepper chicken)
For me, a top 10 beer. 466 charactersMorpheus, Jan 01, 2013

The showcase is somewhat nearly immaculate with a hazy yellow amber color and a thick fluffy white head. When the head retention and lacing left are exceptional, the aroma and flavor drive forth so mellow, inviting, fresh yet balance with a big touch of fruity ester, citric/lemony zest and bubblegum that nicely parade with a sweet biscuity malt and clove with a spice while wheat with a twang. The feel is smooth with a velvety body and refreshingly crispness/dryness. No doubt this beer is cult, my veneration to the old Weihenstephan again. 625 charactersEverydayoff, Dec 19, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours much like the kristallweissbier, but with more pulpy appearance that slightly hints at pink as it pours into the glass. In the glass, the beer looks a lot like cloudy dehydrated piss, with a huge big, creamy, white head. The body is quite hazy, sitting somewhere in between the clarity of apple juice and the murkiness of apple cider. Lacing is fat and sticky on the sides of the glass, leaving puffs like the clouds in the sky. On the nose, the beer smells wonderfully of spicy banana breads, with nice clove notes, and some definite hints of mint in the afterlingerings of the scent. There is even a slight spicy pepper in the scent, sitting below the other rich scents. The smell is thicker and richer than the kristallweiss’s (obviously) with a much grittier and natural flavor.
The beer tastes richly of bubblegum banana with clove spice notes. The beer begins with bubblegum and spice; just as it is building in flavor a slight yeasty funk can be felt in the taste, but is quickly washed away by the big banana bread flavors that have been building in the mouth. This eventually wanes down into a banana aftertaste with light clove and bubblegum hints at the sides of the tongue. The mouthfeel of this beer is superbly creamy, with light carbonation and a medium to slightly heavy and leaves the mouth with a thick sticky feeling on the tongue while the mouth as a whole feels clean, but slightly coated in candied banana. Overall, this is a superb hefeweizen, as would be expected from the oldest brewery in the world. I hold this up there with Zero Gravities Weizenheimer as the best in the style. A superb beer that epitomizes and optimizes the style beautifully. This beer is a must try. 1,715 charactersMaxwell, Dec 09, 2012

Appearance- Cloudy golden color with two fingers worth of lingering, foamy head. Fair amount of lacing.
Smell- Big aroma of wheat and yeast with some banana and bubblegum notes.
Taste- Wheat malt, orange, banana, and clove. Very well blended together.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied and very smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation with a slightly creamy feel.
Overall- Great beer. This is the best hefeweizen that I have had. I can't wait to pick up some more of this. 505 charactersscratch69, Nov 17, 2012

Slight spice and yeast in aroma. Crisp and funky.
Awesome flavor. Yeasty, slightly spicy. A little bit of that banana flavor people get from Hefes.
Great, smooth mouthfeel. Creamy. Carbonation feels just right. So lingering bitterness.
Really great beer. Not as great after it starts to go flat, though. 383 charactersUnderPressure, Nov 13, 2012

A: Pours a hazy straw color with some amber hues in the body. I heavy white head forms on the pour and recedes very slowly leaving behind sheets of lace.
S: Big orange peel with some cracked wheat and spicy yeast. Coriander and banana with a slight sweetness.
T: Much more wheat flavors in the taste. Coriander, orange flesh, and sweet yeast. 
M: Medium bodied with a little bit of chew to it. Medium-low carbonation. Sweet finish.
O: Very solid hefe. The taste was spot on, but it didn't quite live up to the complexity of the nose. Would enjoy again. 605 charactersTreebs, Nov 12, 2012

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is one of the first beer in a 5 pack that i bought today. The ultimate Bavarian gift pack, with 1 traditional weizen glass. 
Poured the hefeweissbier into the glass. Just wow. This glass and the beer in the glass in so enticing. A huge fluffy white head about 4 fingers thick forms and stays for a while, dissipating very slowly. Head retention is good. Pale straw in color. Totally cloudy and unclear as expected. Good amount of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Very small sized bubbles here. Decent lacing as well. Appearance is near perfect.
Smell is more phenolic clove like, with a good amount of banana fruity esters. Fairly good balance here, just a tad more prominent on the phenol side. Good characteristic smell of wheat beer. You know you are going to encounter some sweetness. 
Taste is very much the smell. Mix of clove and banana flavors. Sweet in taste. A good wheat presence. Some tartness due to high carbonation. Not exactly very dry finish. 
Mouth feel: light to medium bodied. Refreshing effervescence due to carbonation, which is too much, exactly as per the style. Good chewy feel. 
Style wise. It is the epitome of style, no doubt about it. A well deserved 4.75. Personally a good 3.75 for a wheat beer. 1,260 charactersAmitC, Nov 03, 2012

Pale golden-yellow pour, hazy, with a tall fluffy white head; decent retention and a bit of lacing. Yeasty aroma, bready, banana esters, clovey spice, pretty much exemplary of the style. The taste reflects the nose, pale bready malts, doughy, toasted wheat, classic hefe yeast, banana and clove. Medium body, fairly smooth mouthfeel, soft carbonation. This is where you go for a no-nonsense hefeweizen. 510 charactersRifugium, Nov 01, 2012
4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz bottle that was purchased in Las Vegas with the code 1282 stamped into the back. Poured into my perfect pint glass.
Appearance: Easily the most massive head I have seen, white, solid and 1/2 the glass. The beer is a hazy straw color. Leaves some lacing as it goes.
Smell: Yeast, wheat, lemony phenols, clove, bubble gum and a little band-aid. Exactly how a good hefe should smell.
Taste: Delicious wheat with citrus overtones, most from the yeast and maybe a touch from hops, I suspect. Clove comes out a little more strongly in the taste. Actually pretty thirst quenching. This one does not bowl you over with intensity (big stout of IPA) but the flavor has a tone of great quality.
Mouthfeel: Smooth texture and a lower amount of carbonation (due to the massive head) make for a great feeling beer.
Overall: These guys have been brewing this one for a while, so I imagine that they have perfected this style. I would tend to agree. For some strange reason, this one is not available in Utah, and that is a shame. 1,025 characterskagent777, Nov 01, 2012

4.64/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Pours a golden-orange color with a huge, fluffy white head that looks like a cloud atop the brew. Super volatile, even a somewhat conservative pour gives this thick-ass head. The nose is full of yeast, wheat, malts, light spices including clove and maybe coriander, and a faint hint of fruity sweetness. The taste follows the style of hefeweissbiers very closely (after all, this is the original as they say), full of sweet fruity esters; banana, faint lemon and orange zest, hints of clove and kitchen spices, and a rush of sweet malt, and a cyclone of pure yeast, extremely reminiscent of bubblegum. Alcohol makes an appearance, although very faint at 5.4% ABV, it provides a nice structure to control everything else. Wheat on the tongue and breads and yeast in the aftertaste - this beer is delicious. Lots of carbonation provides a nice, crisp snap on the tongue; thin-medium body.
The claims they make about this beer aren't false or even exaggerated - this is some truly great stuff, here. One of (if not, THE) best hefe I've had - this is quickly becoming one of my favorite session beers; great flavor, low ABV, goes down smooth. What's not to love? 1,159 characterstectactoe, Oct 29, 2012

Overall a great buy, especially for someone looking for a more authentic German experience thanks in large to the 500ml service size. Of all of the wonderful beers I had in Germany, this one seems closest to the real deal as any I've had. 505 charactersDeutscheJeff, Oct 21, 2012

A- Pours a very hazy, golden orange with a thick, heavy 4" head. Little retention with no lacing.
S- Dark fruit upfront, wheaty, bready, sweet notes in the background. Subtle but inviting. 
T- Wow. Upfront, cloves, heavy wheat, nice spiciness. Ends with fruity, grapefruit, and slight citrus notes. This is what I want to taste in a hefe. I can't decide between a 4.5 and a 5. 
M- medium high carbonation. Not heavy, just crisp and refreshing. Highly drinkable.
Overall, this is an excellent hefeweizen. Tasty and complex, while maintaining a crisp, smooth character. I could drink this all day, every day. I didn't expect anything different. I will not compare this to the standard, because this is the standard. 829 charactersgcamparone, Oct 17, 2012

A- pours a slightly hazy pale golden color with an orange hue. Huge rocky and pillowy white head, sustains long after the pour and reduces to a solid layer leaving sticky lace on the glass. 
S- Classic banana and cloves, earthy, cellar like yeast. Sweet wheat with a hint of lemon-grass, just a trace of hop bitterness. Very nice.
T- Sweet malted wheat, highlighted by somewhat tart lemon notes and a bit of clove. Hops are minimal, finishes dry with a cracker like maltiness. The yeast is a bit nutty and I pick up some refreshing fruity notes as well. The alcohol is noticable but is balanced nicely. The linger on the palate is fruity and refreshing, long after tasting.
M- medium body with a healthy bit of carbonation, mouthfeel is super creamy and goes down like velvet.
O- this one lived up to the hype for me. By far the best Hefeweizen that I've had and will enjoy this one many times to come. I can only imagine having one of these fresh overseas. 987 charactersTreyliff, Oct 16, 2012

I was in Dallas on business, and have just been really busy lately. But we have some new motivation… before I leave for a week on another business trip! Anyway, tonight we are grabbing a bottle of Weihenstephan Hefe Weissbier. I wonder if anyone out there can pronounce the name of the brewery… not you German readers. Other readers!
Anyway, looking forward to reviewing this beer. I don’t have an orange. I hope I can still enjoy the beer!
In the Glass: It’s light yellow in the glass, and pours a two-finger head. The lace is weak, but the head stays strong when swirling the beer in the glass back and forth.
Nose: That is what a beer is supposed to smell like. It is filled with yeast and has a subtle dryness to it. I just want to take a big chug of this. Like I said, I know I have had this beer before… just not sure what it tastes like. Based on the style, I need an orange. But I hear it’s not cool to fruit your beer.
Flavor: This isn’t ice cold, as we just bought the bottle tonight. But I threw it in the freezer when we got home. It is at cellar temps right now. Perfect for most, if not all beers. The flavor is incredible. Never mind the bubbles, the flavors are that of a typical hefeweizen. I haven’t had one of these overseas yet, but the next time I go over there, I will be sampling one of these. By the way, did you know that Bayerische Staatsbrauerei Weihenstephan is the oldest brewery in the world?
Mouthfeel: There is a ton of carbonation. The beer sits nicely on the tongue, but as you swallow the bubbles really try to force all that flavor to the back half of your palate. The flavor is nice, but the mouthfeel, and I hate bubbles… is acceptable. I wouldn’t want to swish this one around in my mouth… as that wouldn’t give me any more flavor, only create more bubbles… but man, what an enjoyable beer.
Aftertaste: The aftertaste is decent. Nothing to write home about. The ABV is also pretty low, and what aftertaste I get is subtle, dry, and reminds me of why an orange would match well with this beer. I am not a huge fan of this style, but the hot Arizona summers might change me in a few years. The crisp flavor a beer like this produces will help cool down those hot summer nights nicely.
I am not a huge fan of this style, but I really enjoyed this beer. As my palate changes, I have to keep an open mind on beers that I might not always dig. For example, I HATE Brettanomyces beers… there is just something about that yeast strain that I can’t handle. Not sure of the yeast strain they use here, but man… I could get used to drinking beers like this. Beers like this might even taste better from DAS BOOT!!!

This is one of my favorite beers on the planet. I’ve been told it is the perfect Hefeweissbier. Now I haven’t had enough of the style yet to truly appreciate the differences, but that being said, I can vouch for how good this is. It is amazing.
A – A hazy gold with a perfectly white head of carbonation that rises up to the top of the glass when I pour it but then recedes afterwards. Very little/no lacing.
S – Makes you wanna cry. The smell is just so goddamn wonderful. Clove and banana, bread and a very welcoming yeast with hints of spice as well. AAAHHH, smells so good...also, bit of lemon.
T – A lot more of the nose, just such wonderful flavor, a perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness, great banana and yeast, with other fruity (lemon) and spicy components in the background (maybe a little caramel in here as well, just a dash).
M – The carbonation on this beer is really nice, it provides a luxurious effervescence that tingles across the tongue and down the throat. The body is medium.
O – I love this beer. It will be a beer that I drink for years to come. Great, wonderful, tasty, delicious, banana-y, sweet, bitter, mild, drinkable, spicy, yummy. 1,274 charactersKKB, Oct 09, 2012

A- Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a giant head of thick white cream that stays for quite a few minutes. Limited lacing.
S- Extensive amounts of bananas, a bit of lemon and some grassiness along with some spice. This is a real winner here.
T- More lemon and yeast character than the nose lets on, but otherwise follows it. Lots going on with banana and citrus, finishing up with a subtle warming on the way down.
M- Light on the tongue, but that's the way it should be. Very bubbly and refreshing. A certain lasting spiciness brings me to take another sip.
O- I really enjoy SN Kellerweis, but this might surpass it. This is surely one i'll go back to again, especially at 3 bucks a piece. 739 characterstviz33, Oct 09, 2012

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Golden colored, cloudy, and with lots of carbonation. I got a two finger creamy and rich looking pure white head. The retention was superb as it lasted till the end. This beer is absolutely stunning in my Weizen glass.
Mostly what I smell in the beginning are those fruity ester aromas from the yeast, mainly it's banana. I also detect cereal grain/biscuit that adds a balance to the sweet fruit. I'm also picking up a hint of lemon.
Initially I taste some earthy/herbal hop flavors followed by biscuits and and those yeast esters which again remind me of banana. Like the aroma it finishes with a lemon zest.
It's medium bodied and is noticeably smooth especially when you consider the level of carbonation. Hops give way to the malts and yeast and finally there is a citrus finish, making this one interesting beer.
What a fantastic beer to enjoy while I sit here and watch football. I could see having this in about any scenario or season. The price was great too for the quality of this well known world. Lass beer. I paid 2.99 for a pint. I'll do that again for sure. 1,072 charactersJCaweinstein, Sep 29, 2012

Perfection in a glass. One of my favorite beers of all time. Ayinger's hefeweissbier comes close but Weihenstephaner have mastered the hefeweissbier. 
Pours a hazy, golden-hued liquid into a weissbier glass. Head is perfect as not too much and not too little. Lacing is light. Smell is light citrus, bright cloves and subtle malt. Mouthfeel is light on carbonation and alcohol. Taste is a brilliant explosion of malt, bready yeast, clove/banana and delicate sweetness. Finish is smoother than water off a duck's back. No bitterness at all. While most weissbiers lean one way or the other on the sweetness scale, Weihenstepher nails the balance perfectly. One of the best beers in the world. 837 charactersBayern1971, Sep 24, 2012

500 mL bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass at fridge temperature.
L – Very hazy deep gold color with an enormous 7-finger white frothy, creamy head. Excellent retention and a little bit of lacing. A little half-finger white frothy cap sits on the surface of the beer all the way down the glass.
S – Bready and grainy wheat, banana, cloves, and a little bit of bubblegum. Smells absolutely fantastic.
T – Follows the nose with a taste that is just as robust as the aroma – something that is difficult to accomplish judging by the small number of beers that have equal tastes and aromas. The beer is sweet all the way through with bready and grainy wheat malt, lots of banana esters, and a little bit of bubblegum. As the taste progresses, yeasty clove spice really picks up. Delicious.
F – Light-to-medium-bodied with great carbonation, a crisp but creamy mouthfeel, and a spicy and pleasantly dry finish. Spicy yeast lingers for a really nice amount of time.
O – This is an absolutely fantastic hefeweizen. It’s easy to see why it’s rated the best. Everything is so nearly perfect for the style that it’s tough to not give this one 5s across the board. The fact that it’s so readily available in the US makes it even better. Without a doubt, this is a must try for all beer-lovers. 1,498 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Sep 15, 2012

A-Pours a light golden color. Hints of orange. Not clear, but not as foggy as I would have expected for a wheat. The head is incredible...really tall, just off-white in color, thick, and long lasting. There is pretty significant visible carbonation.
S-The smell is my favorite aspect of this beer. It smells like banana with a touch of lemon and clove for a kicker. A touch of hay and grass keep things from being too sweet. Really nice.
T-Sweet yeast with banana and a touch of lemon/citrus and clove. No real hop character and just a hint of alcohol. Well balanced acidity...no need to muck this one up with a lemon wedge.
M-Lots of carbonation, but very drinkable. Dry on the finish, but never tart.
O-This is a fine example of how to brew a wheat beer that is drinkable on a hot summer day without tasting like a watered-down mess. It has more backbone than most wheats without tasting gimmicky. 950 charactersspoony, Sep 09, 2012

A hazy August gold with a super tall dense yet fluffy white foam crown sitting atop.
Down below lots of carbonation buoy the foaminess.
Smells great. Lots of pleasent malts, yeast with there clove and bananana aromatics.
Good drinking and easy at that. Bold wheat malts and yeast play a nice match, with banana esters coming through. Even a hint of clove.
On the palette all goes well, smooth and refreshing.
It holds it flavor well as it warms, since I think wheats tend to go flat or water out as they warm.
It's a lazy rainy day. Watching birds at my feeders even saw a bold eagle at peace valley park today, simple man is on the computer....
So simple man I think works well this this wheat. 787 charactersmicromaniac129, Sep 08, 2012

Poured into a straight pint glass; I swirled the bottle before the final pour. A deeply hazy, translucent golden-amber hue with effervescent carbonation. Produces a large head of creamy off-white foam that lasts for a few moments before collapsing. Aroma of sweet malt and yeast esters, with notes of banana, clove, bread, faint nutmeg and a mild whiff of alcohol. An initial metallic hint fades away after a little while. An earthy, vinous quality lurks in the background. Complex and superb.
Tastes of sweet malt with a dry, yeasty character. Notes of banana, clove, bread, faint honey and subtle stewed hops. Possesses a mildly tart dryness, as if infused with a hint of lemon. A bone-dry finish; no bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is smooth, dry and tingly, with pleasing carbonation and great body. Thick and chewy. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of yeast esters and banana.
Simply put, one of the world's greatest beers. All the characteristics of weissbier are superbly blended together - the yeast esters produce a fantastically balanced flavour and aroma. An easy-drinking classic; very refreshing and I could happily imagine sinking a few. Add this to your list of must-try beers. 1,376 charactersjazzyjeff13, Sep 05, 2012

Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Hefe glass. Always save that last little bit at the bottom of the bottle to swirl around and get that yummy yeast at the bottom. Pours a hazy yellow with a full head. Minimal lacing. 
Smell is banana nut bread goodness. Bananas, clove, biscuits, nuts.
Taste like it smells. Very well balanced. Delicious from start to finish. Yeasty. 
Mouthfeel is very thick and perfect carbonation.

Probably the strongest smell of any wheat beer I have ever tried. A bit bread like at first from the malt and yeast, but there is also a fruit smell, a lot of banana, and a nice amount of clove.
A lot of banana and clove, a bit of fruit. Bit of a bread like taste in there as well. Very flavorful beer, a lot going on here.
Excellent mouthfeel, no complaints here.

Served from a bottle to pint glass.
A- Hazy amber, great carb bubbles dancing their way up to a tight creamy head. There was barely any retention on the head, as it disappeared quickly into a thin cap that skimmed the top of the beer.
S- Bananas, Yeasty Bread, Some Wheat and a Pinch of Clove. Very inviting.
T- Palate follows the nose big time. Cloves, bananas, a little yeasty, sweet malted wheat, light citrus. Very complex flavor that paints a mosaic of great taste. It all comes together too perfectly and finishes well.
MF- Light-Medium body with a medium carbonation to it. Very tasty beer that goes down plain and simply smoooth! The flavor really hangs around on your tongue and the roof of your mouth. 
O- Worth it for me. I got tired of wheat beers and heffs quickly, but this proved to be a worthy contender in a vast sea of complex beers out there. For a moderate price, jump on it! Delicious. 976 charactersBlackwolf, Sep 01, 2012

Taste: Malted wheat. Almost toasted. Lemon, grass, perfectly ripe banana. Underlying spiciness drops hints of clove and pepper. Yeast is earthy. Mild roasted character. Bright and clean. Big fruity esters push some apple and pear. Almost no hops to speak of.
Mouthfeel: Lively carbonation. Body runs just on the thin side of moderate. Lingering dryness builds with each sip. 
Overall: Summer the beer.

Average hefeweiss beers are a dime a dozen. It's an easy style of make average / okay, a hard style to screw up. But on the flip, it's a hard style to distinguish yourself in it seems.
This is one hell of a beer to stand out. Pours with a towering thunderhead of dense foam into a weiss glass. A hazy golden, with swirling bits of yellow orange yesty goodness.
Smell is nutmeg, clove, vanilla and banana with a nice yeast aroma. 
A subtle sweetness in the mouth. Very smooth. Exceptionally smooth with a nice spiciness and teensy bit of bite. There's some alcohol taste when it warms a bit, which kind of surprises me given the 5.4 abv. 
Fantastic beer. Glad to have tried it. It's so smooth and so true to style that this ought to be the benchark for hefe weissbiers the world over. 
Loved it. This isn't a session beer. It's a drain the bottle and have three more before you even realize what happened beer.
The simplicity of it blows me away. This is one of those beers that should illustrate that yeast doesn't just add fizz and alcohol to a beer, but actually makes the style. 1,218 charactersLiving816, Aug 19, 2012

A - Lightly hazed golden amber body. Massive fluffy bone white head. Amazing retention and lacing.
S - Huge bannana presence. A touch of clove, spicy yeast, wheat, and some biscuity crackers.
T - Underipened bananas, clove, yeast, spices, and bready malts. Very tasty and refreshing. Well balanced and light, but full of flavor. Mouth feel is lightly syrupy yet crisp and well carbonated.
O - Certainly the best hefe I have tried. This is a style that is hit or miss for me as I lean more towards the banana flavors than the clove flavors. This one is very banana heavy with just a touch of that spicy clove. This is an excellent beer. 836 charactersdavey101, Aug 17, 2012

S: It has a strong banana aroma with some spiciness coming though.
T: There are some banana and spices coming though with slight amount of bitterness in the finish. Overall it has a mild but pleasant taste that is typical of a wheat beer.
M: I would say it has an average level of carbonation with a medium body that is slightly sticky.
O: Overall a very good wheat beer that is perfect on a hot summer day. While it is not my favorite style of beer it definitely does this category justice. Would buy again. 618 charactersFroggerMan, Aug 16, 2012

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into my Spaten weizen glass.
Appearance: Hazy golden yellow. The bright white head exploded up the weizen glass with a pleasing burst of effervescence. Very long head retention but almost no lacing.
Smell: Very nice. Spicy and a lot of wheat. Cloves and banana are also quite prevalent...no surprise there, of course. Smells spot on for the style.
Taste: Wow. Great tasting. Yeasty and spicy. Loads of cloves, bananas, and a touch of bubblegum. Hint of warmth at the finish. Pretty much the definition of a hefeweizen.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a spritzy touch of carbonation. Wonderfully drinkable.
Overall: I'm kicking myself for waiting so to try this beer. I enjoy hefeweizens immensely in the summer and this is the hallmark of the style for certain. 793 characterspburland23, Aug 15, 2012

Pours a dark golden yellow with two fingers of white foam and lacing. Wonderful aroma of clove, banana and wheat. Dry wheat start and middle with banana and a pleasant, spicy aftertaste of cloves. A nice well integrated, tasty wheat beer, very nice. This beer blew my mind the first time I had tried it, really the first time I had a light colored, relatively low ABV beer that tasted fantastic. One of the world's great beers. 485 charactersLiquidAmber, Aug 07, 2012

The color is a beautiful amber. The taste is light with definite citrus. The only place where this beer lost any points in my book was in carbonation. On-tap it didn't seem overly carbonated but when I had a bottle of it my first pour had a lot of head and seemed about right. The second pour I may have been to gentle and the carbonation definitely got in the way of what I would consider the perfect mouthfeel. 546 charactersGuitarRob22, Aug 05, 2012

Dark yellow-orange with lots of head, 2-3 inches!
Lots of visible carbonation.
Smell was earthy, yeast heavy with very little of the fruit/citrus I expected.
Taste was great! The smell made me think the taste would tend toward the bitter but here the fruit came more to the front. It wasn't as sweet as some american versions but very palatable with more hops. I picked this up with no expectations or foreknowledge of the brand. I just knew it was a Hefeweizen I hadn't tried yet. My new benchmark! 527 charactersCyrano41, Aug 02, 2012

Smells strongly of bananas and bread. Also has some notes of cloves and slight orange peel smell. Very pleasant.
Lots of bananas and some spiciness on the tongue. Paves way for some bread notes and very low hop bitterness. Slight orange peel taste and some spiciness in the aftertaste.
Good carbonation in the mouthfeel. Nice medium body and had some chewiness into it. Goes down real easy and smooth.
Very nice hefeweizen. Never tasted such strong banana notes before in a beer. Great drinkability and magnificent in the summer. This bottle held up very well despite being two and a half months away from the best before date. I am curious to see how much better it is fresh. 809 charactersScrylol, Jul 31, 2012

A - A rich hazy yellow with a big frothy white head that gives a nice retention.
S - Banana, orange and a lot of sweet bubblegum-like scents coming though. A lovely aroma for sure. 
T - Follows the nose with some additional flavors: yeast and clove. Makes for a superb drink.
M - Dirnkability is at its finest with this one. A wonderful light-medium body bursting with flavor while remaining tightly tamed. It feels soft and refreshing on the palette. Fantastic.
O - In my opinon the best of the style. Others try to do what this does but are simply caught short. A truly wonderful brew that any enthusiast should seek. 659 charactersmscudder, Jul 30, 2012

Pours a hazy dark yellow with a billowy white head. Decent head retention but somewhat lacking in lacing.
Wonderful aroma of bubblegum, clove, banana, and oranges. This is really what a Hefe should smell like. 
The flavor has Lots of banana/bubblegum yeasty esters along with some clove. Everything is fairly well restrained with no single characteristic becoming overpowering. The soft wheat mouthfeel along with fairly high carbonation makes this one refreshing beer.
Overall, one of my favorite Hefe's. Really a benchmark for the style and a beer everyone should try. 606 charactersrangerred, Jul 29, 2012

An excellent appearance, very true to style. Near flawless. Scents of clove, banana, slight citrus, some wheat malt and a low level of vanilla. A very good aroma profile that hits the style dead-on. Nothing is off, everything is present and it's all fantastic. Very nice. Flavor begins with spicy cloves phenols and a bit of banana esters, moving into more clove phenols but now balanced equally with banana esters and a slight citrus-like sourness. An undertone of cracker-like malt is present throughout the entire sip. Finishes with an equal balance of banana esters and clove phenols, with a slight lemony sourness. Aftertaste is spicy clove phenols and faint banana esters. An excellent flavor profile. The main flavors of the style reveal themselves in full form and several of the optional flavors also come into play. Very well done, balanced and refreshing, perfect. Mouthfeel is light bodied, effervescent with high carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. A very nice, refreshing mouthfeel that is perfectly true to style. Overall this is an amazing hefeweizen. Everything about it is a perfect representation of the style, and this is my number one recommendation to anyone who wants to try a good Bavarian hefeweizen. 1,377 charactersAuraan, Jul 28, 2012

This one pours great, gave me a huge white head, 4 fingers in height with great retention. When it finally came down, a thin strip of foam remained on the beer's surface. Pale golden colour, slighty hazy.
Sweet aroma of bananas and clove, less strong once the foam goes down of course, but still there during the whole drinking time, and quite pleasant.
Taste is also just a bit sweet and fruity, with some spices and yeast traces.
Rich body and as mach carbonation as needed. Leaves your palate dry.
A great beer, maybe I will seek it again after I finish my three other bottles. 654 charactersDouberd, Jul 27, 2012

Appearance: golden yellow bodied beer with a light haze noted to the body, not quite opaque though. The beer has 2 fingers of white head that drops down to a thin cap, but has some decent staying power. Spotty lace. 
Smell: Big bananas, wheat malts and clove.
Taste: Follows the nose really close. The bananas are not as big in taste as they are in the nose. A nice malty wheat base is found mid palate. Yeasty and fruity notes are all over this beer. Finishes with cloves and more bananas imparting some sweetness.
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. This beer is really drinkable and also delicate. World class carbonation and mouthfeel! 
Overall: This is a tried and proven beer right here. German beer lovers get your hands on this beer. $3 for a 500ml format bottle what a fantastic price for an amazing beer! It wont dissapoint you... i dont even like this beer style, but I think that they make this beer PROPER! The oldest brewery in the world is getting things done the right way!!!

Hazy golden orange with a dense and rocky head.

Creamy mouthfeel right off the bad with some more bread and a snappy crisp bite. Carbonation is higher than I anticipated but this adds to the overall refreshing character. More lemon zest and a perfect amount of clove.

A: Pours a cloudy golden yellow color. Huge head takes up about 4 inches of glass. Some lacing is left on the glass after. The head quickly subsides.
S: Smells of banana, clove and a faint hint of bubble gum. Some citrus and wheaty yeast are also picked up upon further sniffing.
T: What a beauty this is. I get some spicy clove and wheat initially. The citrus and banana work together afterwards and there is a slight taste of bubble gum that comes through at the end/aftertaste. This sets the standards for how hefes should taste.
M: Refreshing. I could easily put down a whole sixer of this on a nice summer day. The drinkability is wonderful and it is a medium-bodied brew. 
Overall: Hands down the best hefeweizen in the world. There is no question about it. One of my favorite all time beers and my go-to for the summer months. The balance and drinkability (aside from the taste) is what sets this beer apart from the other hefeweizens.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is an instant favorite. Coming from the "oldest brewery in the world" it should be no surprise that this beer is crafted to perfection.
I bought this in a "Beers of the World" 10-pack from World Market hoping to expand my taste profile. WH was a fantastic surprise find in the box, and I have since bought more individual bottles from my local warehouse.
Immediately upon opening the authentic Bavarian bottle, I smelled the light, sweet wheats and banana complex without having to search for it too hard.
The taste, again, was banana ,the icon of bavarian hefeweissen beer. Their use of it is perfect. It is a highlight of the beer, not the entire taste. There was additional spice notes that provided a strong finish. The entire bottle was great.
Highly recommend and worth keeping a few on hand at all times so you can introduce friends to it. 904 charactersroadies, Jul 14, 2012

Drank this many times before, just now getting to reviewing it. Side poured with low vigor into a weizen glass. 
Appearance - I love the labeling and the history behind this brewery. Simple, old school, tells you right up front what you are getting. Pours a cloudy straw yellow color with a huge, dominating four finger pillowy head, looks like a cloud on top of the beer. Good lacing. Tons of sediments and carbonation inside the beer make this a top notch presentation.
Smell - Wheats, Breads, a little earthiness, but the primary smell was banana esters for sure. Powerful banana, fruit smell to the beer. Maybe even a little honey sweetness in there as well.
Taste - The heavy banana esters are still the primary favors, with a good secondary pop of cloves and a little spice towards the end as well. The breads and malts round out this beer. Very well put together, a very complete taste experience.
Mouthfeel - It's like eating a loaf of banana bread, drinking this. Big bodied, Thick creamy mouthfeel, big carbonation, excellent smooth finish. Hard to beat.
Overall - if you haven't had it, go get it and drink it. Excellent beer, almost unmatched in its category. Highly recommended, I will buy it and drink it again. There is a reason it is the top ranked hefe on all of BA. 1,400 charactersTheCondor, Jul 11, 2012

Pours a burnt straw gold, very lively body to it. A swelling white head leaves good lacing.
Sweet malted wheat, honey, semi-stale hops, faint yeast, something floral.
Cereal malts, banana, sweet wheat, clove... an immortal beer.
Exceedingly drinkable. Dangerously so.
This beer is beyond tried and certainly true. 360 charactersyamar68, Jul 08, 2012
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into tulip, lacking a good hefe glass. Beautiful deep yellow with a slight twinge of orange. 2 inch head with good lacing which dissipates quickly and a fair amount of sediment. Great looking beer.
Smell is bananna, a little pepper and some definite funky wet earth quality.
Taste is very creamy to start with a nice sweetness and peppery finish with slight alcohol finish and leaves a sweet, creamy aftertaste. Very solid, more substance than white or Saison which have similar tastes for me. 502 charactersDAllspaw, Jul 07, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a hefeweizen.
Appearance. Luminous translucent orange hued straw in color. Pours with 3 fingers of head frothy head, which leave ample lacing as it dissipates to a half a finger. Tons of carbonation rises form the bottom of the glass.
Smell. Prominent banana character up front. Bready maltiness behind that along with some clove and other spiciness. 
Taste. Starts with a moderate banana flavor and some slight earthyness. A slightly tart and citric flavor cuts this leading to a more clove and spice heavy second half. A low, almost imperceptible level of bitterness is there as well. Some more mild tartness leads into a dry and slightly spicy finish. 
Mouthfeel. A huge amount of carbonation breaks up a relatively full bodied brew. 
My go to hefeweizen. Highly recommended. 795 charactersjtingue, Jul 07, 2012

Wheat bread and light fruits on the nose. A hint of some citrus zest. The taste is astounding. The first thing I notice is the thick feel in the mouth. A very full-bodied hefeweizen. I taste the traditional cloves and banana, and a slight bit of citrus (very slight.) Some bread like wheat flavor comes out too. The hop flavor is very mild.

4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a hefe glass. Pours the color of a fresh orange at first, and then when the yeast is added it turns a dark, hazy coppery orange color. I had to pour this beer, walk away, and then come back to finish the pour; the head was huge, fluffy, like a giant cloud with no lacing left as I drink it. The nose is very bright citrus, orange, coriander, and white bread. The taste is again full of bright citrus notes, with banana and yeasty sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy with the a nice touch of carbonation. Very delightful. Overall, this beer is a fantastic hefe that I've been looking forward to trying. It's a great representative of the style and hits all the right points perfectly. I will definitely stock this for the summer. 760 charactersestlinska, Jun 29, 2012
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Consumed 6/29/12
Appearance: Hazy gold - pours with a giant, fluffy white head, leaves blobs of lacing, retains a cap forever
Smell: Soft, bready wheat and yeast - bananas and cloves, in nice balance, in nice moderation - a touch of something lemony - nice malt base
Taste: Nicely balanced and stupidly, remarkably clean-tasting, refreshing - "refreshing" is a flavor, right? - mild banana, clove, and a touch of lemon, bubblegum - some straight-up yeast, with some yeasty spiciness - very mild bitterness - lightly bready malts, with some light graininess
Mouthfeel: Medium, but so smooth that it feels a bit fuller - nicely carbonated, refreshing
Overall: Beyond classic
This is a relatively simple beer, but it has great strength in its simplicity. The wheaty malt profile and the yeast come together in a remarkable way. The balance works better than any Hefeweizen I've ever tasted. Seriously. I should have had this years ago. 938 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 29, 2012

A: Pours hazy light amber and looks like a sunset. Bubbly head carries a little bit of the color and it stays around forever. 
S: Wheat, citrus, orange (which I think is a citrus but don't call me out on being redundant ;) ) 
T: ooh taste is not as good as on tap for sure. Wheat comes through big time but this bottle seems to have a little bit of bitter stale taste to it. 
M: Perfect. Sits with a good body and crazy smooth. The bubbles are smooth as well rather than off putting. 
This is for sure the best wheat beer I've ever had. Smooth and wheaty and it hits perfect. Certainly better on tap but a bottle is worth checking out. Light enough to be loved by the average drinker, flavorful enough to be loved by the avid beer drinker. 801 charactersJamesthebrit, Jun 25, 2012

This is a beer that seems to satisfy every guest whom I've served it. It wont raise eyebrows but it tastes delicious.

A thin film of white remains after the head dissipates. Smells of bananas and other sweet things. Not the slightest bit of alcohol in the smell or taste. Taste largely mirrors the smell. The mouthfeel is a little off-putting. I feel it is too carbonated for the style and makes an otherwise smooth brew a little spiky. Overall, the beer is a classic.

3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I'm impressed with the overall quality of this beer. The smell is not overpowering, giving off mild hints of Banana but primarily hops, malt, and spices. The appearance was average, but I must say after pouring this beer into a glass it does leave behind a nice head. What I was most impressed with was the mouthfeel and the unique taste. The mouthfeel was very creamy and smooth, with essentially no bitter points whatsoever. The hoppy smell threw me off a little bit, because there are so many other flavors that strike you prior to the slight hop aftertaste. Above else, cloves were the first thing I could taste. Banana was probably the second most pungent flavor, followed by wheat, yeast, malt, a bit of caramel, and hops. Overall a pretty solid beer. Not one of my favorite, but definitely something different and for its class a very good brew. I'd give it a 8/10. 872 charactersNfl1991, Jun 07, 2012

4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5500 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before February 22nd 2013. Didn't see this in stores around here until fairly recently, but having heard nothing but praise (and being a fan of hefes in general), I am pretty eager to try this one. 
Pours a muddy yellow-brown colour, quite cloudy, topped with nearly three fingers of silky, creamy, sparkling white head. Great retention - the head hangs around for a significant portion of the pint, and leaves behind nice smears of lacing on the glass as it slowly seeps away. Fresh, yeasty aroma with prominent spicy clove notes; leans on the sweet side with lots of pale wheat malt, banana and light citrus zest. Very impressed so far. 
I'm in love with this stuff after my first sip - it really is that delicious. Tons of bready wheat malt flavour supported by more of the banana and lemony citrus notes detected in the aroma, with a gentle clove spiciness in the background. Malty, yeasty aftertaste with a faint hint of clove that lingers. Medium-bodied, and a silky, prickly mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation for a hefe. A bit chewy, with a slick coating left behind on the palate after swallowing. As drinkable as mana from heaven, but I'd rather savour it than slug it back.
Final Grade: 4.57, a nearly-perfect A+ grade. I am completely blown away by this - I've heard it was good, but that is an understatement because it's utterly incredible. Usually I can find at least one thing to criticize no matter how much I like a beer, but this is virtually perfect from my point of view: the golden standard of hefes.
[Updated Feb. 18 2014]
I picked up another bottle, primarily to compare this one side-by-side with some other German hefes (Schneider-Weisse, Erdinger, and Paulaner). Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier remains one of my favourite wheat beers of all time, and it is easily my favourite hefeweizen - unbelievably drinkable, absurdly smooth and delicious as hell. The only problem with this beer is that it's not as widely-distributed/reliably available as the other three in these parts... but I can't say I'm surprised, as this is a world-class beer that people should be buying by the armful. A must-try. 2,175 charactersthehyperduck, May 31, 2012

nose offers clove, banana, and a touch of another fruit i'm having trouble placing. apple, maybe, or peach. melon? regardless, a real nice aroma. the flavor doesn't disappoint, full of clove and banana mostly, with a few mutes citric notes. very tasty. would be the perfect summer beer - relatively light and refreshing yet no less delicious.
crisp, medium-bodied mouthfeel with medium-plus carbonation. extremely drinkable. a classic, easily my favorite hefeweizen to date.

Looks like apple juice if apple juice had a nice creamy head. Smell is spicy wheat, hay, apples, pears, oranges, grass, with a flat bitterness. Taste is earthy: hay, grass, yeast, barley, clove, with lemon and a touch of banana in the back. Finishes mildly dry with the taste of a saltine cracker. Mouthfeel could be creamier, and the esters are a bit cloying.
Great hefe. 399 charactersjimmah120, May 25, 2012
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a Weizen glass.
Appearance: Light, but semit cloudy gold. Not too many bubbles but an overwhelming head on the pour which rose to just under two fingers length. 
Smell: Light orange with a mix of banana, light malts. 
Taste: Really complex and built for perfection. I mean this beer is packing punch when it comes to flavor, light banana, slight sweet citrus and after taste of malts. 
Mouth: As good as it gets when it comes to a any hefeweizen, this beer is so smooth. 
Overall: The truth is this beer is my favorite (and should be yours as well) Hefeweizen, With rich flavors and full-filling taste it would be harder to please any more. Have one and ask yourself for more, Salud! 698 charactersBlurryVisi0n, May 25, 2012

Pours a gorgeous cloudy pale golden wheaty yellow. Massive 3-finger white head, super fluffy and dense, with amazing sticky lacing. Unsurpassed in this department.
Smell is buoyantly yeasty, full of banana, with some spice and nice crisp noble hops. Smells delicious. Starts out full and fruity, then relaxes into a crisp, dry, wheaty-yeasty yumminess.
Taste initially strikes me as bland. Quite wheaty, but the yeast doesn't show up as much here. A decent amount of banana on the back end. But overall, it's dominated by those herbal noble hops. I want more spice!
Feels light-bodied, but full in the mouth. Good carbonation, finishes pretty dry with just a bit of water lingering in the mouth.
Smells and looks better than it tastes. Which is unfortunate, because it smells fantastic. 972 characterszeledonia, May 24, 2012

When this brewery was founded in 1040 AD, I wonder if the very first brewmaster expected it would still be around nearly 1,000 years later. But with the cloudy, heady pale yellow pour leading up to a tremendous aroma of pale malts, banana, clove, and yeast, I can imagine how an 11th Century beer drinker must have been refreshed on a warm medieval day. The light body is satisfying for the style. There is a slight zing of citrus goodness in the taste with the same flavor sensations that were introduced by way of the nose. It finishes clean and easy. The original is still one of the best in the world. 661 characterspuboflyons, May 20, 2012

Beer pours a gorgeous hazy yellow-orange with a fluffy white head. Maybe it's seeing it in the Weihenstephan glass, but this beer looks fantastic. Smell is awesome as well, perfect hefeweizen aroma of banana and clove. Flavor follows the nose, this pretty much epitomizes what a hefeweizen should be. Mouthfeel is light-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best year-round, easy-to-get hefe in existence. It's a great beer for a hot day, and very refreshing. The only things that hold this back from a higher score are that 1) hefeweizens aren't my favorite style and 2) it's not quite on the level of my two favorite hefes, the Andechs and the Live Oak. 754 charactersstarrdogg, May 17, 2012

Hazy yellow-orange with a dollop of cream-white head. Excellent retention. Good look. 4.0
Wet banana, smoky clove, herbal German hop zing, and light lemon peel. There's a light caramel note to the malt that's delightful. 4.0
Very pleasing firm banana, clove, lemon, tart orange, wheaty grain, light caramel syrup, hint of pear flesh, and Noble hops. There's a lot of clove in the back of the throat in the finish. Nice citrusy notes. No one element steals the show. 4.5
Pretty much a perfect mouthfeel. Creamy, but juicy. A little tart, working as an aperitif. Mild-to-medium carb that does its job for the style. Rich, yet quenching. 5.0
An epic hefe. Not sure if I prefer this one over the Schneider Edel-Weisse, but it's ALWAYS been damn tasty. Even better on-tap. Hope I can find a bartender to pour me one this summer. 4.5 1,006 charactersthecheapies, May 15, 2012

This beer smells great and has a strong aroma; can smell it almost a foot away from the glass. Strong aromas of lemon zest, bananas, and orange.
Taste is similar to the smell with a banana flavor up front and a lemony aftertaste. Is a very carbonated beer that has great mouthfeel; a light feeling beer that is full of flavor.
Overall this is a great beer, would really be good outside on a summer day. I don't drink this style much but will be picking up more as the weather gets nicer. Looking forward to trying more wheat beers to see how they compare. 711 charactersCircusBoy, May 07, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: A very cloudy light orange pour. Ridiculously huge and fluffy white head. Retention is top notch, it just won't fade, period. Takes several minutes before I can even take a sip. Leaves a thick layer of lacing all over the glass once it finally recedes.
S: Very fruity. Smells like bubblegum initially. I get some pear, lemons and maybe banana. Some wheat and a little bread in there too. Touch of spice, black pepper I'd say. Maybe a hint of grass somewhere in there. Very light, crisp and refreshing aroma. 
T: Lots of nice lemon, pear and banana. Nice bready yeast and some wheat to smooth it all out. Simple but tasty.
M: Light and crisp.
O: Perhaps the best Hefe I've had. Not overly complex or strong, just a great combination of balanced flavors. Drinkability is off the scale. Goes down so easily it's scary. 822 charactersDope, Apr 09, 2012

First had this beer while stationed in Stuttgart and it convinced me forever not to drink BMC ever again.
Beautiful dirty orange with a sticky bright white lace. 
Smells of malts and wheat with a hint of lemon, which many Germans add during the summer.
The taste is what beer is all about with wheat, barley and lemon. Crisp.

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5To start the review, I will admit to being a bit biased by this beer. When I went through a German phase about 16-17 years ago, this stood out in my memory, and I was not disappointed when I picked this up again for the first time in years.
Pours almost clear straw and golden yellow, with a huge fluffy pure white head that leaves chunky lacing and caps the beer until I swallow the last of it.
Smell is lemony, yeasty, light bready malts.
Taste is clean dry malts, pure, a hint of the yeast, and some lemon in the aftertaste.
Feel is smooth, flowing, light bodied, and probably the easiest drinking beer ever!
While it doesn't have the punch of the bigger beers, this is just special. Balanced and drinkable. A classic beer from a brewery that has been doing it right for almost a millennium.

It pours a cloudy straw yellow with a dense white head that sticks around. Great lacing too.
Absolutely gorgeous in it's own glass.
It smells like wheat with malt, lemon and yeast notes and some hints of banana rounding it out.
The taste is similar to the smell, wheat, yeast, banana, some spiciness, not bitter at all, super easy to drinkand a slightly dry finish. The super smooth, crisp and just perfect mouthfeel gives it an added dimension and it makes this beer just incredibly refreshing and drinkable.
This is beer that makes you happy. It's the perfect German beer, not super complex but never boring either. Easy to drink and perfect for drinking a lot of. 716 charactersAethien, Apr 06, 2012

A: Hazy orange body with a vigorous head (from a very gentle pour) that slowly fades to, surprisingly, minimal lacing
S: The perfect hefe smell in my opinion, spices, yeast, hints of banana
T: Doesn't live up to the expectations surrounding my first experience with it, not that shocking no idea there was a beer out there like this experience, but still amazing nonetheless. Wonderful taste, reminiscent of the smell. 
M: exceptionally smooth, mild carbonation
O: Brings back great memories of my time in Germany. An excellent hefe from an historic brewery. My only prior experience with Weihenstephan was their collaboration with Sam Adams to create Infinium, a less than promising first impression to be sure. I will definitely be coming back to this beer whenever I get the craving for a hefe. 841 charactersSpartanHistory2013, Apr 05, 2012

S: Yeast, banana, sweet malt. The only part this beer lacks.
T: Starts of with a smooth belgian yeast that blends into some nice wheat notes. Little hop in there at the end but quite faint and covered by the sweet malt.
M: Real good. Light, crisp carbonation is pleasant and drinkable. I dont think drinking beer gets any easier. 
Overall a great go to beer especially on a warm day. One of the most refreshing and one I'd love to try fresher. 688 charactersCloudStrife, Mar 27, 2012

T - Nice balance of notes from the yeast. Banana, clove, mixed with wheat. Very light hopping in balance with the malt. 
M - Nice mouthfeel with high carbonation that sizzles on the tongue.

So there it was at the bar out of nowhere and I pounced on it. Hmm. Well, it was fine, but... I don't get all the crazy praise for it. It was good but didn't do much more for me than other hefes, which I'm starting to have my doubts about. I'm wondering if the style is a narrow one, in which the differences between different offerings are small. If you served this to me I'd be happy enough, but rather than buy it again I'd rather explore other untried options. I will say it had a very pretty snowy white head. Seems like a good example of the style but I was let down that it wasn't crazy turbo good like the hype suggested. Or maybe I'm just not a hefe guy. 767 charactersBrownNut, Mar 23, 2012
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The appearance of this beer is a light, golden color with a little bit of cloudiness. The head poured thick (1 inch) and slowly turned thinner with moderate lacing.
The smell is really nice! Aromatic and powerful, it has a real nutty, wheaty smell followed by cloves.
The taste is like nothing else, literally! Lots of wheat and nut flavor, very natural! No bitterness and a hint of the sweet malt right before the carbonation takes over and bubbles on the tongue. The clove flavor is very present but balanced with the other flavors. Totally took me by surprise, great tasting beer!
The mouthfeel is crisp in the front and carbonated at the end, but a great carbonated. Not like the negative soda-like carbonation, but it is strong. 
I am not a beer master, but I have had my fair share (much more than I have had a chance to review for this site) and the flavor of this beer is phenomenal. I bought it from Atlantic Liquors in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware (funny website, ridiculous store) not knowing what a reputation it had! Very surprised when I first tasted it then I came here to review and saw the scores it had received...what a great beer! A must try, no matter what your likes or experiences in the world of beer. 1,225 charactersPhantasIPA, Mar 22, 2012

Smells delicious and rich- lots of wheat, a little bit of orange, good dose of lager yeast. Well balanced and enticing.
Taste is consistent with the smell- lots of bright rounded wheat, a bit of orange, maybe a bit of hop bitterness towards the end mixed with the yeast.
Mouthfeel is crisp= light body but very full flavored and nice medium carbonation (pour carefully). Great great beer- I'll be drinking this a lot this summer. 634 charactersHopdaemon39, Mar 17, 2012

Smells of banana, wheat, olive, nuts, and fresh fruit. A delightful bouquet with much complexity and subtlety. 
A crisp sour sting of carbonation with some light lemony notes hits up front backed by banana notes giving way to an olive smoothness followed by a nutty round mouth feel with wheat notes. Slight fruit notes are detected in some of the bitterness, like the bite of raspberry without any of the sweetness. This is a delightfully complex beer perfect for a warm evening. 552 charactersChickenhawk9932, Mar 13, 2012

A - Pours a cloudy straw golden color with a fizzy and rocky white head that's five fingers tall. Retention is very good. Appealing but largely unremarkable. 
S - Citrus esters and a bready yeast note dominate. Light spice, coriander and orange all come to mind. Mild to moderate strength and inviting. 
T - The spice notes created by the yeast are awesome, and they blend wonderfully with the spicy wheat body. Light floral hops notes are present as well. It's a little mellow for my tastes, though I think it's probably ideal for the style. I get orange, clove, and coriander. It could benefit from a bit more depth, though whats there is very good. 
M - Thick. It's carbonated well and light bodied. 
D - You'd be hard pressed to find a better hefe. Incredibly easy drinking with good flavors. Not groundbreaking or entirely remarkable, but a very good beer. 941 charactersblakelive784, Mar 12, 2012

Smell - Beautiful rip banana, augmented by fair amount of clove notes. The aroma is intoxicating.
Taste - Begins with a prominent clove spice which lasts to the finish. Notes of banana, wheat and a bit of bubblegum-like yeast. Flavors do well to separate, each hitting their stride at different times. Finishes with the aforementioned clove, fading well into the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - This has a light body, bit just a touch watery on the back end. Decently carbonated, leading to a crisp, sharp bite.
Overall - Oh goodness. This is one hell of a hefeweizen. I feel sorry for the people who get Widmer Hef and think that's the end all, be all of wheat beers. This is a world-class hef, and a benchmark for the style. 878 charactersTheSixthRing, Mar 08, 2012

Bottle kept in fridge. 
A- Pours a hazy golden yellow color, with lots of foamy white head that has some staying power. Lots of thick lacing staying on the glass while drinking. Lots of carbonation action going on. Tons of small bubbles rising to the top. 
S- Yeast, some banana in the back. Very "spicy" aroma. Not Hot spicy, but like kitchen spices. Wheat is also present. 
T- Strong German Flavor. Strong yeast, with the banana/clove taste. You can really taste the kitchen spices after swallowing. Complex but enjoyable. 
M- Some what thick. It is thicker than I expected. I can describe it maybe as "creamy". Carbonation is not overwhelming. Feels full bodied, but on the low end of full. 
O- Nice offering. I was drawn to this by their advertising as "The Worlds Oldest Brewery". Glad I picked some up, it was nice to try something out of my comfort zone. I was pleasantly surprised. 929 charactersrfbenavi80, Mar 07, 2012

The beer produces a cloudy golden body with a brilliant white head of 2-2.5 fingers. Lots of visible carb going on.
The first whiff brought forth huge banana notes with the spicy clove and wheat right behind.
The spice flavor mixed with the tingling carbonation is so goood. Banana, bread, and a light citrus flavor round out the flavor profile along with a touch of sweetness.

Poured into a pint glass, the beer gave a lemon aroma. I was expecting a sweeter aroma for a hefeweiss, so a tart aroma was somewhat of a surprise. For a hefeweiss, it radiated the expected golden staw color while producing the expected white head. The initial taste makes very apparent an appealing banana yeast flavor. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly sweet. The carbonation could be described as sharp, perhaps even aggressive. It brought to mind the bubbles of champagne. The bubbles nicely sweet away the initial taste to reveal the next level. The aftertaste brought a mild honey flavor with a hint of the spiciness of pepper. 
This is one highly regarded beer that is easily available to most people. The price of a bottle makes it look even better compared to a lot of beers. 866 charactersJohnnyHopps, Mar 03, 2012

The smell wasnt what I remembered. Nice clove presence, with hints of banana in the background. Then there was a pervasive wheat twang that I didnt like all too much.
The taste is dominated by clove all the way. Full body feel from the yeast, but its really all a facade. The mainly clove followed by hints of banana subside, and leave all the clean finish to come through. 
Theres a reason Weihenstephan is the king of Hefeweizens. 549 charactersVncentLIFE, Mar 02, 2012

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Taste - Franziskaner is my favorite Hefeweizen. This? Is almost identical, but two things make it different. One, is that its much more flavorful. Franziskaner is a little lighter in body comparably. Second, is that, to me, if I let it sit on my palate, it brought forth the banana note. That was really kind of cool how the flavor became more pronounced.
Overall - Its all about preference. This has all the characteristics of a great hefeweizen, its still relatively easy-drinking; but its a bit more fuller and bolder in taste, and that makes this great in its own way. You won't be disappointed here. 605 charactersDM1293, Feb 26, 2012

Smell = bananas, oranges, cloves, a hint of lemon. A little bit of biscuity yeast. In one word, refreshing
Taste = alot like the nose , but it hits you in waves as it spreads on the tongue. First I get the spicy cloves, then the tangy orange and lemon and am left with the ripe sweet banana flavor. 
Probably the best, purest, most balanced Hefeweizen I have ever had. 501 charactersBubbalito, Feb 25, 2012

Smell: Banana-y bread. Also some clove as I would expect, and even the possibility of a rose smell among others (my nose isn't the best however). Awesome.
Taste: Crisp wheat flavors. Very bready and malty with banana and clove flavors that do not overwhelm as they do in so many others in the style. There are also citrus notes and just the slightest tinge of tanginess. The great balance in this makes it superior to any Hefeweizen I have ever had and probably will ever have. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth and kind of thin. Mouth coating with a thick layer of amazing crispness. Again, a great part of a great beer. 
Overall: This is a stellar beer that surpasses anything I have had in the style and maybe from the country itself. Not my favorite beer ever, but within its style, I see no way that they could improve it. 1,017 charactersdafizzif, Feb 25, 2012

Tastes of banana and there's something else in the mix, maybe sweetcorn. Soft malty aftertaste. Took a big manly gulp and got a momentary wash of cloves. Slightly champagney, even reminiscent of Duvel. Fantastic head retention. Very lively on the tongue, lovely. 
Overall: This got me onto Weissbiers but I've tried loads since then and this is pretty unremarkable compared to a lot of others. In my opinion it's one of the most overrated beers on BA. 554 charactersHoppsbabo, Feb 21, 2012

Poured it into a new Paulaner hefe glass (also purchased at Tanakaya), and enjoyed enjoyed enjoyed! The head on this is ridiculously amazing, delicious and long-lasting, lacing the glass like a frappe. Loved watching all the particles float around in the glass, heightening the smell of orange and wheat and the taste of the same. The only thing I could ask for is a bit thicker of a brew just to give my tongue something else to play with. Other than that, this is the best hefe I have ever had, and especially for the price (relatively cheap), I will be a fan of this for life! GET IT! 748 charactersshigg85, Feb 21, 2012

It pours into my Weissbeir Glass with a thud. A small Bavarian farmer fell into it, and threw loaves of bread at my tongue. The beer is hearty, clove like, and packed with yeasty banana effervescence. Next time, I'm pouring this over my ice cream. It's the real deal.

Poured into a belgian hefeweissbier glass, the beer stands tall with a pure white, soft bubbly foam head that tantalizes you to take a sip. Upon first sip, one instantly recognizes that hearty wheat flavor, combined with a comfortable, relaxed, light body mouth feel that is extremely satisfying. After a few sips one begins to appreciate the subtle complexity of the beer, with orange and light citrus hints as well as the classic German yeasty-malty flavor. Perfect beer with a light meal or on it's own, one never tires of a cold Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. 673 charactersBenHesk12, Feb 17, 2012

A: Pours a slightly hazy yellowish golden color that is nice and bright and has a ton of carbonation bubbles, pours with three fingers of pure white head that lingers for a very very long time (im actually sitting here waiting for the head to drop back down to the level of the top of the glass so that i can take a sip) and is very fine bubbled, leaves a ton of thin lacing

it is said that this brewery has the earliest established date for brewing a wheat beer. however, this does not mean that all others should be judged by this breweries product. that said, this beer displays all of the characteristics of a bavarian wheat beer. 
 the appearance after pouring the beer and its sediment is a hazy light yellow with a full white h ead. the head or lacing, permeates through out the drinking of the beer. 
smell is of musty bubble gum (banana and clove) 
taste is both banana and clove and earthy. 
it has a slight lean towards the bitterness of earthy hops and yeast than most, but in my opinion is the epitomy of german weisse bier. 876 charactersBrewhead, Feb 16, 2012

Appearance: A semi-aggressive pour yielded a fluffy off-white 2” head, reducing to a thin ring. Lacing was clearly present, sticking to the side of my glass indicating the original head height. This beer poured golden yellow in color with definitive murkiness to it. 
Smell: The classic Hefeweizen banana and yeasty aroma shines through, with a zesty citrus wheat finish. Clove is also present with a honey-like sweetness.
Taste: I can see why this beer rates so high among the Hefeweizens on the market. Banana dominates, with spicy wheat malts, honey, coriander, cloves and hint of lemon zing too. What a wonderful combination of flavors on the palate. 
Mouthfeel: Light to moderate body with lively carbonation makes this an easy drinking beer. Very smooth, creamy and balanced on the tongue. 
Overall: Outstanding Hefeweizen in every single category. This beer, by far, ranks up there at the top of its class. At only 5.4% ABV, this makes for the perfect flavorful all-year-round session beer. I can imagine this being quite the quencher during the summer months but if I’m being totally honest, I’m enjoying the heck out of this in the middle of February. I'm glad I committed to buying a few bottles of this. Well done Weihenstephaner, well done… 1,329 characterscmq103, Feb 16, 2012

S: German phenols. Banana and clove but without the Belgian additions of strength. I love how subtle the German strain is in comparison. Also, this beer has a great bready quality to it.
T: Rich creamy head to a bread malt backbone that is sweet as well as clovey. I enjoy the banana esters as well as the beer finishes. I am such a fan of the tastes as they are balances and well thought out.
M: Perfect to style. Medium bodied. But light in complexity. Crisp enough to fend of stylish fish dishes but delicate enough to be overpowered with spices.
O: This is another fantastic German Wit. I am biased because this is one of my favorite styles but this is a great drinking beer. The German subtitles and balance really make me excited in comparison to the Belgian strength and extremes. I align more so with balances and crisp flavor than over the top yeast attributes. 1,022 charactersJerseyKirk, Feb 12, 2012

Pours with a huge fluffy white head, allow some head space, swirl the final bit and dump in the yeast. Slightly clear straw yellow gets hit with the yeast and clouds up nicely, final color is a hazy yellow/orange. Head goes down to a skim a bit too quickly to be perfect. Smell is pure weizen yeast: banana, cloves and some dry wheat. Man is this beer aromatic. Taste has tons of yeast complexity and some clove spiciness, hint of sweet from the malt. Mouthfeel has some dryness due to the wheat, light bodied and very high carb, carb even teases the mouth.
Hands down the best hefeweizen, the Germans invented the style and they sure do know how to make em. The only American hefe that comes close is SN's Kellerweiss. Light bodied and full of flavor with none of the off tastes that inferior beers of the style so often have. I feel pity for the person who lets blue moon be the beginning and end of their foray into wheat beers. If the head had held up better and the smells had hit harder this would be a perfect beer. I long for the day I can try this one fresh at the brewery. 1,133 charactersVaterRoss, Feb 02, 2012

S: Perfect for a Hefeweizen! Wheat, citrus, pepper, and a little banana. I could keep sniffing this all day, but for the urge to drink.
T: Wheat is there, but no malty sweetness. A little citrus tartness, but less than the smell would indicate. The bitterness in the finish was potent, but not in a bad way.
M: A bit dry, with average carbonation for the style.
O: Very good. I can see why the brewery has been around for nearly a thousand years. I was a little disappointed that the taste didn't live up to the aroma. I'd drink another anytime, but given the choice, I'd go with Paulaner for a Hefewiezen.
On a side note, it's interesting that this brewer of a wheat beer makes the claim, "brewed under the purity law of 1516" when wheat was specifically forbidden by that law (but I guess it sounds better for marketing than saying, "brewed under the provisional German beer law of 1993") 1,009 charactersTappaKeggaBrew, Feb 02, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A beer that I've claimed over the past few years as one of my top ten favorites, tonight's beer is the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier. Brewed in Bavaria, Germany, Weihenstephan's label states that it's the oldest brewery in the world. Records date back to the year 768 with documents mentioning a hop garden, but the brewery was officially licensed in 1040.
The 17oz bottle pours at a clear burnt-amber color, with a nice thick ivory white foam on top. The foam lingers for several minutes, and leaves behind a mild lacing as it recedes. The aromas are bright and distinct, with plenty of lemon, orange peel, banana, and spices. I absolutely love the aromas on this little Hefeweiss!
On the palate, the Weihenstephaner is flavorful and complex, yet so incredible easy to drink! The citrus and banana is right up front in my mouth, but not far behind is the spice and just a touch of alcohol. This is an absolutely delicious brew that I highly recommend for anyone who ever considered those mediocre mass-produced imitations. 1,026 charactersTheCorkStopsHere, Jan 29, 2012

3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4500 ml bottle poured into pilsener glass. Did not see date on bottle. It's possible this is old, since it's from a shop without a particularly high rate of turnover.
Pours a slightly hazy straw color, with an enormous amount of white head. Seriously, I poured down the side of the glass slowly, and it's still about 90% head to start off. It takes some time to come down enough to add more beer, and remain highly effervescent. Leaves some slight lacing on the side of the glass, and a few mm of head is left on the surface.
Smells like a classic hefe. Not as much banana as others. Mostly yeast, with some citrus and wheat with only a hint of cloves.
The taste mirrors the smell very closely - very yeasty. The wheat is only in the aftertaste, it seems. While it's very good, and has good balance overall, I'd like a little more banana and a little less yeast.
Medium body and quite creamy from the carbonation. Light enough to be very refreshing, but not special.
Overall it's a very good hefe. I'm not sure I would consider it the 44th best beer in the world, and in the style I like Dry Dock Hefe more. I would like to try it again with a bottle I know is fresh. 1,171 charactersBlargimus, Jan 26, 2012

A: This Hefe pours a wonderful golden with an enormous frothy white head. There is a wonderful amount of retention in this head and the lacing is remarkable. 
S: I adore the Banana smell, hint of cloves, and a hint of spice of some sort. This is what I think of when I think Hefeweizens.
T: This is an interesting and complex taste, unlike the nose, on my first sip the cloves invite me in then tempt me with a small amount of banana flavor and then more cloves, and finishes with a bready malt flavor that makes you wanting more. 
M: This is a lighter beer with a nice dry finish that leaves you wanting more , incredibly smooth, a lovely beer. 
O: The fact that I can get this beer locally for less than $2.50 will lead me to have it more and more often. While this is rated as the best Hefe, I would rank it Number 2 behind Dancing Man by New Glarus, which has a more prominent Banana flavor and more subtle clove flavor. i would recommend this Beer to everyone, Well Done as One would expect from the Worlds oldest brewery. 1,064 charactersMicrobrewtaster, Jan 25, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A--Truly fantastic...the head is this massive, angelic, pillowy, off-white mound of fluff that would not be out of place in one of those touch and feel books for babies. The color is a bright golden orange, as expected for a hefeweizen. Swirling and pouring the sediment in the bottom of the glass should be canonized as a rite of passage for every serious beer drinker.
S--Let's be blunt: Hefes are characterized by two things: wheat and yeast. This beer is going to smell like bread. I'm sure there is more going on beyond that, but I'll let the other reviewers focus on the idiosyncrasies. For the time being, my brain refuses to acknowledge any scents beyond that of fresh bread.
T--I don't mean this to sound like a cop-out, but here goes...
This tastes like a hefeweizen should. If you have had other hefeweizens, they should be compared to the Weihenstephaner standard. If you have not had a hefeweizen, either you are in the wrong place and should get back to your vortex bottles and coldness indicators, or you should buy this beer and make it your first.
M--Be ready for an onslaught of bubbles. Also, one thing I love about this style that is perfectly captured by this beer is that the same yeast that gives the cloudy appearance and delicious flavor also makes a huge contribution to the mouthfeel. It's smooth and rich, but in an entirely different way than how one would describe a porter or stout.
Overall--I'll admit (like many of you), I'm a sucker for high ABV beers, eye-catching labels, and any local craft beer. The Weihenstephaner is none of these. It is one of those landmark beers that defines this delicious beverage as we know it. 1,661 charactersjedtheavenger, Jan 24, 2012

Pours a light gold color with a perfect two finger white head. Great lacing, and great carbonation. Hazy in appearance. The nose is amazing, wheat, yeast, lemon, and malt. Taste follows the nose profile. Feel is just about perfect... Sweet, with a perfect malt backbone and refreshing finish. There's a reason this is #1 beer in style.. It doesn't get any better than this for a hefeweizen. Cheers. 441 charactersjayhawk73, Jan 22, 2012

A: This beer poured a cloudy golden typical of a good well-made hefe-weizen with little to no head but with a good amount of carbonation flowing through after the pour.
S: Very citrusy, definite lemon/orange scents strike right away with a nice malty sweetness and some slightly yeasty smells lingering in the background.
T: Right away the citrus that was apparent in the aroma strikes and gives a nice refreshing flavor, followed by some malty sweetness to balance the zest. Again following the aroma, with a nice yeasty finish and a hint of hoppy bitterness.
M: Very refreshing flavor just as hefe's should have. Coats the mouth well without being too thick and has a nice bubbly carbonation that gives a nice finish.
Overall I really enjoyed this beer and have drank many since my original tasting. Definitely a must drink as a great cornerstone of the world's oldest brewery! 975 charactersS7R4nG3, Jan 16, 2012

O: Very enjoyable and well-made; a world-class beer. 464 charactersONUMello, Dec 28, 2011

4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5500 ml bottle. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a huge 3 finger dense white head with incredible retention that reduces to a cap that stays for the remainder of the glass. Thick lacing clings around the glass as well, incredible. Aromas of big banana, clove, bubblegum, pepper, lemon, and spicy yeast. Fantastic aromas here with great balance and strength. Taste of big clove, pepper, banana, bubblegum, lemon, bread, and spicy yeast. Light bitterness on the finish that lingers with citrus, pepper, banana, and spices for a bit. Extremely smooth and slightly creamy medium sized body. Fairly lively carbonation that dies down as I make my way through the glass. Extremely well balanced with the flavor profile as well. Overall this is an absolutely incredible wheat beer; and the definition of a hefeweizen in my opinion. I will keep coming back to this one at only $3 for a half liter at the store. 911 characterssuperspak, Dec 28, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was the first top 100 beer I ever sampled. Half-liter bottle.
Light cloudiness, but transparent gold to golden-orange. Towering 7 finger thick white head off the first pour. It settled slowly, allowing the beer to warm. Some of the thickest lacing I've ever seen. Carbonation bubbles rise non-stop throughout the beer.
Aroma of sweet banana, citrus and spice (heavy on the clove). Toasted wheat.
Taste of banana and cloves with tart citrus and light toasted malt. Light earthiness.
Rather thick, but silky smooth and creamy. Peppery with warmth in the throat. lightly cloying.
Wonderful, quite a treat. 612 charactersobywan59, Dec 28, 2011

The aroma is faint, but one can just detect water and a little bread. Taste is of banana, white wheat bread, coriander or cloves (hard to say which), and water, plus, maybe cinnamon. The body is on the watery side, and Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier finishes easy-drinking and wet. Overall, this is a good beer, but, with it’s spicy aspects, I would not want to have it with a meal.

"the world's oldest" but several seem to claim that title. So I decided to see how an ancient beer has stood up to the test of time.
Appearance - A beautiful amber/brown color. Very carbonated and a great mix of browns.
Smell - A tart almost crisp smell. Some may find it too tart, but excellent along with the taste
Taste - Wheaty with a mix of fruit. The main one I pick up is fresh peaches and a slice of pear. Now this isn't a fruity beer, but has a great fruit finish.
Mouthfeel - Carbonation Perfection!
Overall - a great evening beer that should be enjoyed often. 637 charactersTownDunkel, Dec 14, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type - Bottle
Appearance - Light golden wheat tan, monster foamy 3+ inch head with tons of lacing
Smell - Wheat, yeast, lemon, grassy, floral hops, orange, spices, banana and pear.
Taste - Very smooth wheat up front. Banana is a main flavor, along with some orange and lemon. Spices along with the hops are light, crisp and very well balanced with each wheaty, yeasty drink. No alcohol in the taste. 
Mouthfeel - Light, refreshing and easy on whole mouth. Wheat and sweet lemon and banana coats tounge and palette leaving it refreshed and unscarred. Aftertaste is and floral.
Overall - Perfect example of the style, very easy to drink, smooth, tasty and light. Perfect for a summer drink, or with some meat feature dishes, this is bout as good as it gets for hefeweizen. 783 characterswvsabbath, Dec 13, 2011

Aroma: Notes of clove, banana, spicy floral hop. A little bit of butteryness in the nose. In the way back the is a wisp of butterscotch in the nose.
Taste: Up front is a light crisp mouthfeel. At the begining are notes of banana, clove. In the middle are wisps of citrus. Towards the end is twinge of lemon zest and a nice dry crisp finish.
Notes: Dam this is an amazing Hefeweizen quite possibly the best Hefe I have ever had. Cheers. 610 charactershorshack7, Dec 11, 2011

Poured into the appropriate 0.3l glass with a couple of fingers head
A real treat of a hefeweiss ! You can tell they've been dabbling in the field for 971 years, I think they've cracked it !!!
Cloudy dark yellow in colour (there wasn't much lighting in the cellar room we were in, so difficult to be precise on this one!)
Full of flavour namely a hint of banana with cloves and other spices, truly well balanced beer of this style
The smells largely matched the taste to save repetition
The mouthfeel did it for me, silky smooth and my palate begged for more, lacing remained throughout my drinking experience

3.6/5  rDev -18.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a Pilsener glass.
Look - light amber color, clear, with good carbonation and about three fingers' worth of off-tan colored foam that dissipates fairly slowly.
Smell - very sweet and malty, with not much of a hop presence, but very much of a wheat-like presence. 
Taste - right away the wheat makes itself known. It very much does indeed remind me of Bavarian beers in general. The banana flavor is pretty prominent. Quite well on the sweet side, with no bitterness.
Mouthfeel - pretty well balanced, but leans a little more on the watery side.
Overall - Not a bad tasting brew at all, and it's a good representative of the style. 660 charactersNerudamann, Dec 01, 2011

Poured a beautiful dark honey/golden straw with plenty of haze and a 3 finger pillow white head that faded to 1 finger thorughout the beer. Lacing was spectacular and when poured into a weizen glass it stands out. Smell was very complex with notes of banana, cloves, lemon and bread. Not too strong, but adequate. Taste was fantastic. Follows the nose pretty close, but adds a hint of spices to balance the citrus/fruit on the front end. Classic for the style and spot on. Feel was a good bit of carbonation with a dry ending. Not too watery, but not overpowering. Overall- Not sure I can come up with anything new to say about this that hasn't already been said. This is the gold standard of a Hefeweizen IMO and easily in my top 5 all time brews. While I think nothing is perfect, this comes damn close. Complex/Full taste, great aromas, beautiful balance and a great top off to Thanksgiving Dinner. Will be gettting more of this for next summer- Outstanding! 1,034 charactersTheDinger, Nov 25, 2011

4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from an undated 330ml bottle into a pint glass
A: Pours a hazy, golden honey color with a big, pillow head. Settles in the glass looking like cloudy, unfiltered goodness topped by a crown of foamy head. Very attractive.
S: Spicy, medicinal notes grace the nose with heaps of clove and banana. The aroma is rather pronounced and carries pretty far from the glass.
T: This beer nails the art of the hefeweizen with perfect form. Starts with assertive, yeasty spiciness dashed with generous amounts of well balanced clove notes and touches of banana bread. Finishes very clean, much like eating a sliver of ginger root. Intensely refreshing - I couldn't ask for more.
M: Prickly carbonation, lighter bodied, with a well-executed semi-dry finish. Rather slick on the palate going down, leaves a pleasant mark as the flavors flee the tongue.
O: What hasn't already been said about this beer? It is simply the standard by I believe all other hefeweizens should be judged. 977 charactersRossCain, Nov 22, 2011

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Just got back from Iraq and wanted to start myself off with a good Hefe so knowing Weihenstephaner to be pretty damn good, i selected this bad boy as my first beer, straight out of the sandbox. That being said:
A: I always love the crisp look of this beer, its golden aura just stands light years away from other "Yellow Water" beers (i.e.: Budweiser, Miller, etc). The head...well, it just doesnt want to go away. It is creamy, thick and most of all likes hanging around. Threw this one into a weizen glass and the head combined with the pale, crisp color and the crazy storm of carbonation (at the onset anyway) just pales in comparison to most other Hefe's. The only downside is that you can just see the bubbles start dying or slowing down and its just...sad.
S: citrusy, fruity, like it should pretty much lol. Good smell
T: great taste, its refreshing, cleanses the palate and just prepares you for another sip. Its as if this just gets better after every sip. Or it could be that i'm biased since its my first one for the past year and its just delicious :)
M: Invigorating and cleansing. You can just imagine eating some sort of flavorful dish and this would be the type of beer that just washes the taste away and leaves your tastebuds awaiting more. 
O: Solid, Solid beer. I cant go as far as saying that i love it, as I am a Dubbel kinda guy, but this is just a great, overall beer. Anytime i have company over, i get this, or if its a BYOB thing (so i dont show up others by coming in with a corked bottle of some Trappist and looking like a snobby, a-hole) but i'll bring this. Its a great beer and trying to pronounce the name is always a good conversation starter :) 1,686 charactersJBrew13, Nov 18, 2011

It has a very hazy golden color with thick, creamy, lacy head.
Aroma is fruity, spicy, and nutty.
Flavor is mild but full of depth and character. Banana, bubblegum, and clove all come forward.
Mouthfeel is wonderful on tap. Smooth, light, and creamy.
Overall a great beer that is possibly even better served on tap. 358 charactersGilGarp, Nov 17, 2011

A: Clear gold/orange with lots of carbonation bubbles and a 1 finger foamy rocky head.
S: Banana bread and cloves make up the nose.
T: Liquid gold! Clean wheat taste with Belgian yeasts apparent. Banana flavor with spices throughout. 
M: Creamy into a foamy mouth thanks to the medium carbonation.
O: This is hands down the most balanced and flavorful hefeweizen I've ever had. I'll be picking this up alternating with Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout for a low alcohol go to when I have to drive. 540 characterskeanex, Nov 17, 2011

Smells of banana, cloves, yeast. Tastes divine. This is a perfect example of a Hefe in all ways. It just doesn't get much better than this. Franziskaner has been my favorite Hefe for years, but this one just might have surpassed that as of late. It's at least tied for first. 
Crisp, refreshing, almost creamy mouthfeel. Exceptional. Made by the world's oldest brewery. There's a reason why they are still around after nearly 1000 years, because this beer is incredible! 649 charactersRnRManifesto, Nov 13, 2011

Awesome carbonation streams floating up from the edges of the glass (weizen). Smells a little citrus, banana. Tastes fresh, fizzy and smooth. Leaves a light, bubbly aftertaste that hangs around. Fills my mouth well and seems to hit on every taste bud - sweet, tart, bitter and then salty - in that order. Only a hair thin for feel but otherwise a hefty, proven brew. Overall, a great Hefe! 442 charactersbrewyou2, Nov 09, 2011

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Ok I have reviewed this beer on tap and now I’m returning to the bottled version, which is a beer I have drank for years and always loved. It’s not all that different in either iteration; I may actually enjoy this one a bit more from the bottle. Hazy light orange color. Huge fluffy white head that falls slowly with excellent lacing. Aroma is full of wheat and yeast, lots of the expected banana and clove notes, perhaps a bit lemony with some traces of coriander. 
The flavor is incomparable for the style: very pronounced bananas and cloves, lightly toasted malt, very low bitterness without much of a noticeable hop presence. A touch of sweetness. Lemony and yeasty. Crisply carbonated, light in body, extremely refreshing. I’ll take this one over a bland “summer” ale any day of the week. A true classic. 820 characterstobelerone, Nov 03, 2011

smell - banana, wheat, cloves, cinnamon
taste - so well balanced and stronger from the smell. cant wait to get back to austria to drink this all the time. follows the nose but more intense and more of the yeast comes through.
mouthfeel - thick bodied for the style, great carbonation, wettens your mouth for a bit and then dries, very nicely made. 459 charactersclaytong, Oct 31, 2011

Pours a hazy golden color with a generous whitish head. Looks characteristic of the style. The nose is big wheat with suggestions of clove and banana. A touch of lemon. The taste is big wheat and present, but subdued clove and banana and lemon zing. Not the crazy amount of clove that sometimes comes out of these beers, nor a banana bomb. A bit sweeter and not as lemon/peppery than a lot of saisons and not as soda-like in the body, but not as sweet as a lot of Hefes. Really nice, easy drinking, balanced brew. Overall, this is a world class Hefe. 599 charactersseeswo, Oct 27, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -10.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a Shock Top Hefe glass. Cloudy and light yellow in color. Tons of carbonation bubbles lead to a large three finger head. Head is quite soapy looking from the side and rocky looking from the top and bright white in color. Lace seems to be quite sticky.
Smell is mostly biscuity or yeast. Some spice and banana.
Taste is sweet and bready. I have a hard time describing the flavors I get from this style. Musty, dank comes to mind first. Hay and earth come next. ???
Mouth is crisp with light carbonation, a light body and an average to long finish.
Overall I didn't enjoy this, but that doesn't mean it's not good beer. I really hate this style so it makes it really hard to review them. I hope I never acquire a taste for these either because I believe I would be heading backwards. That being said, I think this is exactly what the style is looking for and if I weren't such a DIPA guy I might have given this a high 4. Thanks to Skip for the sample. 966 charactersazdback, Oct 27, 2011

A - Pours a hazy deep golden blonde color with a thick white bubbly head. Excellent retention.
S - Fresh wheat smell with notes of banana, cloves, and citrus.
T - Wheat with the complexity of fruit and spice flavors from the yeast (similar, but not exactly the same as the nose). A tasty brew.
M - Medium-bodied, thicker on the tongue. Nice carbonation levels, very refreshing.
An excellent hefeweizen, I heartily recommend Weihenstephaner's Hefeweissbier. To me, it's the definitive version of this style readily available. 555 charactersWMEugene, Oct 24, 2011

A beautiful beer, hazy golden/orange with a rocky, very German, head. I love German foam! The head slowely sinks into itself leaving a rocky landscape in the glass. Lots of carbonation.
Woah! This smells fruity!
Banana, mango, pine and indeed clove (I smelled real clove a little earlier). Grainy and some hops.
(Just had spicey food.)
Taste is grainy (wheat) and sweet. Very mild bitterness. A creamy banana desert like flavour with some clove in there. Very summery indeed. Unfortunatly it is cold outside now...
Thin/medium mouthfeel with lots of carbonation. 701 charactersIPA35, Oct 21, 2011

Poured into a snifter
Appearance: Hazy golden pour with a three finger white head that settles pretty slowly and leaves a spotty lace behind. Impressive replenishing head retention, especially for a hefeweizen. 
Smell: Great wheat smell with aromatic yeast as well, and just a hint of some fresh pine-like aroma. 
Taste: Wheat, lots of yeasty taste that imparts a bit of spiciness. Interesting aftertaste--almost nutty or woody?
Mouthfeel: Medium-light body, medium-high carbonation, crisp finish. Very nice. 
Overall: A very good beer, true to style, top notch in all respects. 610 characterspBRale, Oct 21, 2011

A - Poured into a 1L Hofbrau mug. Hazy orange medium orange in color with a large white fluffy head. OK retention but really good lacing. 
S - Spice, clove, banana, wheat, the aroma was more pronounced than the Franziskaner I compared it with.
T - Wow, just fantastic. Wheaty and really complex. More complex than the nose lets on but with all the same sort of flavor profiles.
M - Exactly what youd expect. Palate coating and almost heavy on the tongue which was unexpected but enjoyable. The carbonation really cleanses your palate. 
O - I must say I enjoyed this one just slightly better than the Franziskaner I had side by side with them. But it was such a small margin that it was almost non-existent. World class stuff here. From the claimed oldest brewery in the world you wouldnt expect anything less. 930 charactersOutFox, Oct 19, 2011

A: Cloudy golden color with a fantastic and dense head. Lots of lacing. This was a beautiful beer.
S: A great malty/wheat sweetness and a light lemon.
T: Malty sweetness with cloves and bananas interplay. The tiniest of hop finish. 
M: Light to medium mouthfeel.
O: This hefeweizen knocked my socks off. I was under the impression I didn't care for hefeweizens... Weihenstephaner taught me a much needed lesson! 465 characterstony223366, Oct 17, 2011

I was really excited to drink this beer from the "oldest brewery" in the world.
A: Poured a thick, creamy head, three finger width. Cloudy amber color.
S: Fruity and nutty, wasn't overpowering while remaining a fairly pleasant aroma.
T: Definite nutty sort of taste with some kind of banana tone, to be honest it tasted sort of like banana bread. I really enjoyed it though.
M: For the flavor of the beer it was perfect.
Overall: Was excited to have it, and was not disappointed. The Light smell and flavor really accented the general tone of the beer as one that is well made. 633 charactersMurrhey, Oct 16, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Can't add a lot to all the previous reviews, but in a nutshell :-
Pours a dense white two finger head (did not pour bottle in one go) straw coloured body.
Aromas of bananas, cloves, tinned pears. Compex and delightful.
Taste is light restrained as aromas plus yeast flavours, mouthfeel light, crisp, sharp in a good way.
Great brew as on a one-off drink or an all nighter. 376 charactersheygeebee, Oct 16, 2011

A: Light murky orange brew with an Enormous 4-finger white head after a violent pour. Head last forever (just like I like it – pun intended) and eventually ends in a very persistent lace.
S: Spicy malt wheat aroma that has a heavy yeast backbone. 
T: Malted wheat and barley flavor hits you up front. Every sips reveals this beer’s complexity as it has a great yeast, banana clove, and bitterness makeup. Finished very clean and crisp with mild hints of alcohol.
M: Medium body and medium carbonation
O: I am not a big fan of this style, but I have heard so many good things about this beer I had to try it. It didn’t disappoint, but also didn’t blow me away. It was very well balanced and easily drinkable, but nothing I would grab again. 807 charactersckollias, Oct 15, 2011

Super Junior Market
San Diego, CA
Just barely hazy golden yellow, orange, and amber with a huge, thick, persistent white head. This beer wasn't nearly as cloudy and hazy as others I've had within style. Spots of lace down the glass.
A powerful aroma of banana, perhaps some apple and pear, clove, and wheat. The best smelling hefeweizen I've ever come across.
Flavor is incredibly similar to the aroma: lots of banana and clove, low bitterness, a bit of white fruit, wheat, and bread. Fantastic!
Light to medium bodied--incredibly drinkable. This beer wants you to drink more and more of it.
I couldn't even imagine a better hefeweizen. 656 charactersehammond1, Oct 14, 2011

Big earthy and fresh nose with lots of sweet banana, smooth wheatiness and a little bready yeast. 
Great flavor burst right off the bat. Same notes as the nose with nice notes of banana, wheat and a little bready. Great balance and a nice and pleasant clean aftertaste. 
Light bodied with zesty high carbonation that is just perfect for this beer. 
Overall just an outstanding all around hef. Definitely my favorite of the style. 582 charactersMrVonzipper, Oct 14, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.51pt .9oz bottle properly poured into a weizen glass.
A: Cloudy, deep golden in color. Almost orange at its core. Frothy, creamy white head has great retention, as expected. Clumps of sticky lacing are prevalent.
S: Heavy phenols: lots of clove. Over-ripe bananas, bready wheat, powdery yeast.
T: Tastes of banana bread and over-ripe bananas are interrupted by clove and spices. Big dose of wheat. Bready with a touch of that acidity and citrus-like tastes that tend to come with wheat beers. Yeast plays a major role, contributing a mildly chalky and slightly funky taste. Dries a bit toward the finish and the malt tastes turn cracker-like. 
M: Very light in body, very fluffy and creamy in the mouth. Lots of aggressive, small-bubbled carbonation, as expected.
O: An excellent beer, maybe the best of the style. 
Notes: I am fortunate enough to have this beer frequently available fresh on tap at several bars in the area. It is always excellent, an easy A+ and one of my personal favorite beers. This is my second time having it out of the bottle, and the edge seems to be taken off of it just a bit. I suspect this is due to the rigors of trans-Atlantic shipping, or maybe it isn't quite as fresh as it could be (no bottled-on dates). 1,244 charactersryan1788a5, Oct 13, 2011

A - I vaguely cloudy yellow liquid with a white head. Carbonated bubbles are not visible. 
S - Barley malt, some lemon, not so special and / or fresh. 
T - For a wheat beer it is nice and mild flavor, slightly acid with light lemon tones. Not really bitter and quite dry. 
M - The carbonation is medium with a slight bitterness in the finish. Not sticky, a very drinkable beer. 
O - Good white beer and good enough to try again. 570 charactersMar02x, Oct 10, 2011

S- Sweetie and wheaty.

Honey golden, very hazy color, 3 fingers of fluff, which takes a couple minutes to dissipate. Smells classically Hefe. Banana, cloves, some floral notes. A bit of citrus. Definitely smells sweet. Tastes more spicy than it smells, with a more subdued banana flavor. A nice hop bitterness on the finish. Very lightly sweet. Lots of little bubbles making me want to burp.

N: Aromas jump out of the glass and consist of grains and yeast. 
T: The flavors are more subtle than I expected from the nose. Yeast is the dominant flavor but it does not completely overpower the banana in the background. Lemongrass lingers on the tongue to create a crisp finish.
M: The mouthfeel is creamy and full with fairly pronounced carbonation.
O: This is an enjoyable brew and I can see how it has become an icon of the style. I'm not a huge hefeweizen fan, but this is a great representative of the style and I'm sure I will find myself returning to this beer when the situation calls for it. 674 charactersschultzi22, Oct 04, 2011
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From the bottle to a weizen glass. 
The pour is a hazy yellow wheat that is topped by a rocky head that wants to stick around and leave some lace. Getting into the nose I pick up the requisite banana, clove and yeast. Maybe a piece of bubble gum. Taste is on par with the nose and all anyone can really ask for. Banana and clove balance nicely and the yeast lends a nice background for those flavors to work on. Creamy in the mouth with ample carbonation make for a refreshing brew. 
My favorite hefeweissen and one I continue to come back to. 545 charactersharrymattcody, Sep 25, 2011

S- Lots of wheaty banana aroma along with a touch of spice.
T- The malty wheaty character gives it a sweetness along with the fruitiness of the banana, then comes the clovey spiciness. A bit watery though I have had this brew many times and never noticed that.
M- Full, lots of carbonation.
O- Top notch Hefe, really sets the standard. 414 charactersfoogerd, Sep 22, 2011
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Presentation: 12oz brown pop top, classy, classic label; Some date code that I'm not exactly sure what it means, but I THINK it's at least brewed in 2011, which I'll take, considering I've seen examples that are over 2 years old on the shelf.
Appearance: Hazy dark straw gold beer, with a nice cream-colored cap which, surprisingly, fades a bit fast for my liking. 
Smell: Requisite sweet/tart banana aromas, with plenty of spice in the background. A couple of swirls really brings out the spice aromas. Very slight hint of citrus in the background, as well as something nicely floral as this warms a bit.
Taste: Banana and sweet spice (no particular baking spice is coming out here, though I think perhaps I get a slight hint of clove). Slightly tangy wheat backbone, with light, if firm bitterness. All in all, it's a bit like banana bread, though w/out the typical caramelly/burnt sugar notes that confection often (though not always) has. 
Mouthfeel: Spritzy and refreshing
Overall: A really tasty Hefeweizen. Is it the world's best, like I once thought? I don't know, though it's certainly top-tier. I do have to say, however, that it's no longer quite my favorite. Overall, however, certainly a tasty offering. 1,221 charactersBedetheVenerable, Sep 22, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Hazy orange/yellow, more yellow color with 3 fingers of creamy foamy white head. Lacing is slight, but the head takes a lot to fade.
S - Bready yeasts, lemon, pepper, bubblegum, banana, in order of strength. The bready yeasts, lemon and pepper are the most dominant by far while the others are in the background.
T - Pretty much reverse the dominant flavors from the smells. Bubblegum, banana, lemon, pepper, then the yeasts. Sweet malts show as well with a nice tart overall taste.
M - Thin to medium bodied, good level of carbonation. Finish is slightly drying with that tart taste staying around for a while. When that fades, you're left with the sweet malts sticking to the inside of your mouth.
O - I'm not generally a fan of hefes but I can easily see why this one is considered one of the best. 809 charactersGarrettMD, Sep 20, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I decided to open my bottle of Hefewissbier after having a hefeweizen by Ranger Creek Brewery. (based out of San Antonio) I'd have to say my suspicions were accurate. This hefeweizen by Weihenstephaner definitely blows out a lot of other examples by a wide margin. 
The beer has a wonderful unfiltered appearance without being too dark like the Ranger Creek one. The foam rose nicely and it subsided fairly slowly. The taste is the most critical component. The last thing I want is to have a hefeweizen taste musty, stagnant, or just plain old. This beer doesn't do that. It had plenty of citrus notes, but it wasn't overly powering nor syrupy to a point where it does taste old. 
The beer was easy on my plalate,a nd it actually felt refreshing in my mouth. It was not too syrupy, thick, nor too thin. 
Overall, it's a truly great example of hefeweizen, and it's definitely easy to drink. I have to admit, I actually preferred the Kristall Weissbier, but this one is just too dang good. 990 characters2xHops, Sep 19, 2011

Pours with a large whitish head that quickly reduces to a paper thin coat but leaves some lacing. Cloudy golden tone. 
Has a very sweet and fruity aroma with suggestions of banana, pineapple, melon and baked bread. Beyond these it is also yeasty. These aromas appear in the taste, along with clove, allspice, apple juice and wheat. 
Light body; crisp with slightly aggressive carbonation. 
Clearly not an average beer and clearly exceptional for style. However, I often find this style mostly unappealing. Nonetheless, I did find this one to be appealing and refreshing. Hope to sample at the source in Bavaria in 2012. 728 characterschinchill, Sep 18, 2011

Very elegant bottle and presentation with the Weihenstephaner logo on the front and some gold motifs. This is true with all the products from said brewery (with different colors in the different styles) but I thought I'd mention it because I love their bottles. Now, onto the review:
A: golden cloudy body with a three finger foamy and puffy white head. Looks delicious. Some bubbles rise up to the head in the body. Decent retention and some lacing is present.
S: this beer welcomes you with a very nice banana aroma along with wheat and yeast with some sweet notes. Some citrus present as well. Complex but excellent.
T: follows the nose for the most part with a nice introductory banana taste and then turns into a solid wheat flavor. Ends with a touch of citrus and spicyness. In a way, this taste is typical of a lot of the German Hefes but this beer does its job incredibly well...yum!
M: medium body, medium carbonation, very smooth while drinking it.
O: one of the best Hefes out there, I highly recommend this beer. In fact, it's one of my favorite beers and it's a regular on my fridge because it's THAT good. Excellent presentation, the appearance and the smell alone make your mouth water and invite you palate to drink it and once you do it you're left with a complex, yet pleasant, combination of flavors and aromas that leave wanting for more. 1,410 charactersolimpia84, Sep 06, 2011

A - Voluminous creamy white foam that event settles to a thick cap and a few fingers of lace. Hazy golden peach body.
S - Wheat, weizen yeast, bananas, cloves, faint bubblegum, stone fruits. More understated in the clove department than I remembered. Pretty much reference quality for the style.
T - Taste has a bit more clove, unmalted wheat, some pale malt sweetness, yeast and bread, and a bit of banana in the periphery.
M - Grainy medium body, pleasant carbonation, lightly sticky finish, clean aftertaste. Pretty refreshing stuff.
D - It's a classic, reference-quality hefeweizen. I think I'd score it a bit higher if we got fresher stock, but unfortunately that's not the easiest thing to do around here. Still, a great beer for extended session, beer gardens, etc. 952 charactersMasterSki, Sep 05, 2011

Best before 29/06/2012
Pours a hazy light golden yellow, shades of orange body with a large fizzy white head that slowly bubbles down, careful pouring this one. Nose is banana esters, bubble gum, citrus, distinct yeast notes, grassy. Taste is similiar with the main body being smooth yeast and peppery cloves, good banana presence still. Mouthfeel is dry in the finish, light to medium body, prickly carbonation.
Overall, a refreshing summer Hefe and remarkable for its style, good format and clean design make for a smart import. 546 charactersheebes, Sep 05, 2011

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I hadn't had this beer in awhile, tried it on tap at Prost! and was floored, so bought several bottles at Whole Foods. This is even BETTER from bottle. No joke!
Tasted in lineup next to Franziskaner. This proved the superior beer in every way (though only slightly better in each category). So I apologize about including some comparisons, but I find that is a really good way to truly appreciate the quality and differences of two of the best German hefeweizens.
Poured with that supremely impressive huge head fading to a pretty good lace. Medium straw hue with lighter highlights, lighter than Franziskaner, more head, less sticky lace.
Intensely aromatic, stunning really. Lots of banana and clove, a myriad of baking spice, fresh hay, a grainy wheat note, oodles of citrus, mostly meyer lemon and orange peel, some hints of white flowers.
Palate explodes with flavor, this is where this beer really shines compared to tasting from tap a couple of weeks ago. The bottled version seems to have a purity of flavor and crisp, fresh notes. Really nice banana, clove, nutmeg with a grassy note, some really enjoyable cereal/grain notes, and a really delicate backing of lemon zest/ lemon grass. Superb. Lots going on.
Very good body and texture, decent grip, finish is medium long and alcohol is in check. Fine carbonation. Nearly perfect balance.
Overall this is a stunning beer which comes as close to perfection as one could hope for in a hefeweizen. So note my superbly high marks and realize that I am comparing this to every other hefeweizen that I have ever tried and that this beats up on. Others come close, but I haven't tasted one that is superior to this. 1,672 characterscbarrett4, Sep 03, 2011

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516.9oz split between two weiss glasses.
Hazy pale straw yellow with plenty of carbonation. Big pillowy head that remains for the entire session. 
On the nose, we have big banana and bubble gum, with clove and yeasty bread aromatics to complement. It's a much cleaner and less sweet hefe than most commercial versions. Pretty nice.
Very similar to the nose with the semi-sweet banana fruity flavors up front and some sugarless bubble gum sweetness in the back there. Subtle hints of spices like coriander and cloves, as well as that nice yeasty bread like quality. Very clean and well put together.
Smooth with light carbonation on the tongue. Medium bodied, and just a little sticky.
Nice semi-sweet banana and bubble gum flavors with a nice coriander and clove spice. Done in a much less sweet and subtle way than other hefes, which is a nice change from what I'm used to. Recommended, and highly available. 913 charactersauroracrisis, Sep 01, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 5This is the best beer I can ever remember having!!! It was probably bought it from Total Wine about 4 months ago and stored in a cool basement for most of that time.
It has a strong hefeweizen flavor (but I like that), I find most German-brewed hefeweizens to be skanky, but this was very fresh. 296 characterspeterg321, Aug 30, 2011

Smells of spice, cloves and just hints of citrus.
A little bready but mostly sweet like an orange and distinctly banana. Not cough medicine sweet but honey with a coriander and citrus. Again cloves stand out but I didn't find it as spicy as others have put down, maybe a tinge of pepper. Comes off as very well balanced summer brew.
I wouldn't call it sharp, almost creamy as a full-bodied beer. 460 characterspants678, Aug 30, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5500ml bottle poured into a 22.3oz weizen glass.
A - Massive head of thick, off-white foam. Hazy golden-honey hue with effervescent carbonation flowing up the glass. Unrelenting head retention. Spotty lacing for a while, but doesn't stick for the whole time.
S - Best smelling hefe I've had for sure. Tons of wheat, bread, and yeast. Lots of citrus notes as well here. Obvious orange, coriander, lemon zest, banana, peach, and a touch of apricot. A hint of honey and vanilla sweetness. A bit of barley malt and light grains as well. Complex and inviting. 
T - Tons of yeasty and grainy bread flavors. Wheat and banana are strong as well, but the citric quality I had anticipated is much more muted than the smell had hinted at. Notes of coriander and orange linger around the palate, the don't come through like I had hoped they would. Distinct vanilla sweetness is also present, although subtle. My sample at the Calgary Beer Festival seemed to feel a little more dark, with more emphasis apricot and peaches. I also taste an unmistakable metallic flavor. As it warms, cloves and spices become more evident, especially in the finish. 
M - The carbonation sparkles lightly throughout the experience, and is delivered in a medium bodied hefe with a slightly dry, yeasty finish.
D - I've tried a few hefeweizens now, and this one is by far the most enjoyable. Complex aromatic and flavor qualities, with a nice presentation and appearance. The problem I run into with most hefes is a lager-like graininess that just kills the flavor profile for me, but this one keeps those grainy malts in check and delivers and well-rounded and balanced flavor that is thoroughly enjoyable. Well crafted and a must-try for any beer lover. 1,725 charactersConverge, Aug 30, 2011
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Aroma: Very sweet and pleasant smelling. A little fruity with banana's the predominant smell (in terms of its fruitiness). Even more apparent is the yeasty/bready aroma which is strong but sweet more than sour.
Head: Magnificent, some of the best head i have ever received from a beer. Sticks to the side of the glass for some time.
Taste: Like most Weiss-beers, the hops do not provide the most in terms of taste. Fairly yeasty and mild. Like the aroma, bread and yeast are the predominant factors, but not in a overly-fermented and sour way. 545 characterskcinlober, Aug 26, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This brew was served from the tap at The Old Toad in Rochester, NY. It arrived in a 17 oz. Hefeweizen glass and boasted a golden-tawny color. It held three fingers worth of soft white head over a hazy brew. No other sediment was noted, and carbonation appeared minimal. The aroma popped bright vanillas, coriander and pumpkin spice, faint orange peel, thick wheaty grain and a huge phenolic clove character. The latter became enhanced with warmth, where booze also began to seep out. Additionally, there was a more pronounced sweetness, with strawberry inclusions. As we sipped, the flavors opened up with a strong wheat character. This was given with equally strong phenols and cloves, with a soft and sugary balance from banana esters. The middle moved on with slightly more bittered grain and a lactic sourness. To finish we were given more of those big clovey phenols, spice of coriander, bitter citrus rind, and a wash of grain. The end also showed a slight bitterness of soft alcohol, which was unexpected due to the lower abv. The aftertaste breathed with bubblegum esters, banana sweetness, cooling wheat, and lighter cloves. The body was heavenly light and the carbonation was medium. The creaminess to each sip was absurd, with a huge slurp and smack. The feel remained soft and eternally coating throughout. The abv was appropriate and the beer had great drinkability.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the mouthfeel. This was near on perfect, and a great complement to a hot day. Another huge bonus was in the spicy flavors included in both the nose and taste. This brew is exemplary for the style, and extraordinarily refreshing. 1,659 charactersTheBrewo, Aug 25, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Rare is it that I find carbonation like this. Even a careful pour produced a three finger head, which lingered at two and dissipated to what was still a very solid one/one and a half finger. Big thicks of clumpy foam - the stereotypical, easily cartooned German beer. Color is a darker shade of gold, very much like wheat itself. Low translucence makes body carbonation hard to perceive.
S - Banana, clove, a touch of citrus, and light, wheaty malts. The quintessential hefeweizen.
T - Very much the same as the nose. Light bready notes and very neutral hopping carry the flavors of ripe banana and warm clove with other spices.
M - Full-bodied, nearly creamy (especially for the style), but extremely refreshing.
O - It feels almost silly to review this beer. For the lovers of hefes, it's the peak of the style. For those that normally don't enjoy a hefe, this is the beer that could change their mind. I'm not even that much of a fanboy, only picking one up in a mixer sixer every now and again to visit it like an old friend. It's just a recognizably outstanding beer, a grandfather of so many to follow. 1,116 characterspaperbackfoster, Aug 25, 2011

T- Luscious sweetness retains well over the palate. Perfectly balanced and utterly delicious. There is definitely that clove/coriander taste upfront with a lovely array of subtle flavours following. Some faint sweet grain carries this fantastic beer out.
S- Exciting smell! It smells like a normal Hefeweisen except stronger. Banana is particularly prominant.,Some peppery notes. Smells quite sweet.
M- Perfectly light and smooth with some refreshing carbonation to boot. Truly amazing.
O- This is very close to beer perfection! It's an incredibly refreshing beer with a very tasty palate. An instant favourite of mine. 762 charactersaeolianshredhead, Aug 23, 2011

4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a weizen glass from a 500ml bottle.
Appearance: About as perfect as a weizen beer should look. Pours a strong cloudy straw amber color with an enormous, foamy head. The head never disappeared. There are tons of carbonation in this beer, and is so delicious looking that I want to refrain from drinking it just so I can stare at it.
Smell: A sweetened wheat smell with enormous cascades of fruity, malty aromas of bananas, coriander, pears, canned peaches, sugar cane and clove. This must be the ultimate prototype of what an ideal wheat/spiced ale must smell like.
Taste: I don't think I've ever had a beer this creamy, thick and juicy before. The yeast gives the beer its bitter edge, but other than that, there are loads of flavors in this beer. Fruity, spiced flavors are all over the place, yet it contains a bready taste that reminds me of baked goods fresh out of the oven. In the realm of wheat ales, this is a sublime tasting experience.
Mouthfeel: Its feel, while quite balanced, is still not up to par with the other aspects of the beer, but this does not mean that it's mediocre by any means. While the beer is creamy and thick, there is an undeniable watery feel to it, and virtually no bitterness - not much sweetness remaining on the palate as well.
Overall: Wheat beers are not my favorite by any means, but this completely transcends hefeweizens as a whole. This beer is a MEAL. If Weihenstephan is indeed the world's "oldest brewery," it shows. If your brewery was hundreds of years old, you'd inevitably perfect a recipe this good! This is a world class ale that is extremely well balanced, flavorful, and very easy to drink. For its low price, you'd have to be nuts not to have one! 1,718 charactersmagictacosinus, Aug 20, 2011

4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a bottle of this to formally review. I’ve had it many times though so it’s nice to really think it over. Drank from my Widmer mine Hefe glass.
Appearance- Pours a straw colored yellow with a hugely beautiful white head that literally has stiff meringue like peaks. An amazing cap and collar stays the ENTIRE beer along with TONS of thick rich lacing. One of the best looking beers I’ve ever seen.
Smell- As you’d expect and just as I remember the light plantain sweetness is softer than most Hefs and the spiciness isn’t as bold. There is a light lemony cleanness to the beer with a touch of orange peel and maybe even coriander. It’s all there, just in more moderation. Maybe I’m just too used to the American versions.
Taste- Much like the nose it’s just ridiculously balanced and nothing is overdone. The spicy bite of the yeast is very neutral as the banana is sort of an afterthought - not the main flavor like most. Other than just a teeny tiny kiss of clove and maybe some white pepper, there isn’t any other spice. The wheat is more of a player than one might expect as it’s doughy and full. The finish is malty and damn near floury (not a bad thing, just the flavor I get) as the wheat is really prevalent.
Mouthfeel- Thick and rich with a crazy creamy feel. The carbonation isn’t all that zippy even with the large head but the feel is great.
Drinkability- Definitely a super good beer that I enjoy every time. The look and mouthfeel are absolutely spot on perfect and the taste is about as balanced as you’ll find in a Hef. There are a few other Hefs I prefer (see Paulaner) but even those are usually more carbonated than I like. Tasty beer that we’re lucky to have everyday access to here in Minnesota. 1,752 charactersyounger35, Aug 14, 2011

4.76/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the best, if not the best Hefe beer, although there are many other beautiful german wheat beers with similar qualities. Germans really know how to make great Hefe and today, I don't buy anything but german Hefe beers.
Colour is hazy golden yellow, similar to the other light wheat beers. Smell is the most unexceptional quality of this beer. It's nicely fruity and honey-ish, but pretty light. Medium to trong foam after pouring. Opening the bottle rises foam on the bottle nozzle.
Look and smell is nothing compared to the taste of this drink of gods. It is simply stunning. Taste is very fruity, with honey and herb flavor. Images of Bavarian spring meadow flashes in your mind after filling your mouth with this terrific beer.
Highly recommended, if you like sweet wheat beers. Hefes are not for everybody and I think many lager and ale fans don't like the sweet taste, but if you are into these, then I welcome you to real beer heaven! 949 charactersTheGrunt, Aug 05, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sweet, mellow, smooth, spicy, buttery goodness! Every time I drink this on tap, it is billowy and beautiful. Hazy Goldenrod right up to the 0.5 mark on W's beautiful swirly glass with the billowy, creamy foam that flows over the top. What a magnificent wonder!
All the sexy, gooey spicey aromas (cloves, orange, popcorn, etc...) flow right up through my nostrils and grind up against against my olfactory business and makes me nose-cum. Okay, it's really not THAT amazing, but it is still pretty awesome.
This is probably one of the best beers you can get for the price. No American wheat beers even come close to The W. It is so smooth. It goes down the hatch easier than the finest cut of fatty salmon. It melts across your tongue like a fine, seared foix gras. It tickles your mouth-senses as much as the most aromatic spicy curry. It also gives you the ability to urinate in public in the presence of police without getting caught...err...wait, no, I got caught. Anyhow, I showed up to court and the cop didn't. Case dismissed.
If you know of a better hefe, please let me know, because you're wrong. I will gladly knock down your door and beat some sense into you.
Cheers! 1,180 charactersmusicman575, Aug 05, 2011

4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured aggressively into a 16 oz glass from a 12 oz bottle. 
The appearance of the beer is a light orange to burnt orange towards the middle of the glass. The head is absolutely fantastic with about 3 fingers worth of fluffy white head that dissipates over a long period of time. 
The nose has bananna, spices, and light malts. There may be some strawberry and/or raspberry notes in there.
The taste is an explosion of the banana and spice flavors but not anywhere near anything that is overwhelming. 
The mouthfeel on this beer is incredibly silky and smooth. The carbonation is perfect and it coats your mouth in a very refreshing way.
This is the definition of the Hefe style. 684 charactershippityhops85, Jul 31, 2011

A - Great pour on this one. A nice creamy 2 finger head sits atop a slightly cloudy yellowish orange pour that is slightly hazy.
S - Wow, amazing aromas. This is what a hefe is all about. Big bananas and cloves along with other belgian spice notes. All around spectacular aromas here.
T - Wow, again, exceptional flavours. More banana and close notes and gentle wheat notes. as the beer warms the flavors really open up but still maintains a nice refreshing finish.
M - Really nice carbonation here. Somewhat low, resulting in a smooth, creamy feel. Still, nice and refreshing.
O - Overall, I love this beer. One of my favorite beers ever I love finding it on tap, especially for cheap with the appropriate glass. Excellent beer. 910 charactersrudzud, Jul 30, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoying now, as I have many times in the past, poured from a bottle into a weizen glass on 7/27/11.
This is the gold standard hefeweizen; the one to which I measure all other hefes (which is, most likely, why I have yet to find another hefe I'm willing to give an A grade to). 
A- Wonderful cloudy golden/orange color with rich, white head. The head is aggressive, and unless you pour into your glass in the most delicate possible way, it is going to require settling before you're able to complete the pour (which is totally fine by me--this isn't a beer for slamming/chugging). 
S- Wheat, clove/spice, and light banana. 
T- Wheat, clove, banana, a bit of butter toffee and bubblegum (but not too much, unlike many other hefes). The flavor is complex with many notes that aren't immediately apparent. I enjoy drinking this slowly because the flavor profile shifts as the beer warms a bit, revealing many of those buried flavors. Yum!
M- Mellow carbonation and a smooth texture. The beer is a pleasure to drink.
O- As the review indicates, this is a beer I have an incredibly high opinion of. I'd go as far as saying that it is my favorite beer of all time. Anyone who is a flavor of the style should give it a shot (especially if you're lucky enough to beer somewhere that has it on tap). 1,296 charactersthehenbarris, Jul 27, 2011

 After a bad experience with this beer on draft, I decided to give this rather old bottle (distribution fail I suppose) a shot because the draft version (that I sampled) doesn't do it justice. 16.9 oz., batch # 3081 (bottled Feb. 2011) poured into a weizen glass. ~ $4/bottle.
 Hazy light golden with a nice, moussy white head; excellent head retention, and great lacing. Perfect looks. No contest here. Aroma is perfume and spice, but not so much banana and bread; and the spice is random rather than dead on clove.
 Tastes rather bland with mild fruitiness, ample kick of clove, and a finish that is a tad bitter for the style. Not saying that this one needs to be in line with the style because isn't this the beer that defines it?! Some lemony tartness, but bitterness is slightly heavy.
 Mouthfeel is real nice. Crisp yet not overcarbonated, but the bitterness lingers and causes me to doubt the interity of this bottle.
Overall average --- This sample, not questioning what flows at the biergarten

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: Pours a hazy golden yellow with loads of visible carbonation and a typically massive, dense, pillowy white head that gradually diminishes to a thick cap of foam. Lacing is spotty.
S: Sweet, wheaty malts mix with the expected aromas of banana and especially cloves, rounded out by undertones of nutmeg and citrus (mainly orange). No discernible hops or, more surprisingly, yeast.
T: Rich Munich and wheat malts and an omnipresent yeast flavour (quite unlike the nose) are quickly joined by a pleasantly sharp note of cloves and milder tastes of banana and nutmeg. Towards the finish, the malt takes on a sort of biscuity character and lemon zest and ethanol flavours come through.
M: Medium-bodied with the usual high, crisp, champagne-like carbonation that gives a refreshing bite. The rather lemony finish is tart and clean, balancing the malt-and-spice flavour profile perfectly.
D: It's easy to see why this Weizen is so prestigious: it's traditional yet distinct in taste, refreshing yet satisfying, and flawlessly balanced overall. Archetypal. 1,055 charactersKartoffeln, Jul 17, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a weizenglass
LOOK (5/5) pours a light straw color - a slight orange tint to it, but still on the lighter side. Very opaque, this shows the color well. Nice carbonation on the inside of the glass. The head is great: it rises huge, bone-white, and falls to a large cap with great lacing.
SMELL (4.5/5) The usual aromas for this style, and these are very well balanced. Cloves and bananas are there. I find the cloves a bit stronger than the banana (which I like very much). Some tartness (a bit of citrus) in there with some light wheat graininess; these fall behind the clove-banana flavors. No real hop aroma. Dry finish.
TASTE (4.5/5) Bananas and cloves right off. This is a bit more balanced than on the nose. The tartness (again, light lemon citrus) and wheat graininess bring out the clove really nicely. A hint of vanilla. Hop flavors and bitterness are both very low. Finish is very tart and dry.
FEEL (5/5) Really good. The body is lighter-medium and the carbonation is pretty high. Some body is added by wheat & yeast - this gives a delicious fluffiness. The carbonation also plays well with the finish.
DRINK (5/5) Hugely drinkable and tasty. The light banana, tart citrus and spice clove and meld into a perfectly refreshing brew. Near-perfect example of the style. 1,291 charactersRijtjeshuis, Jul 17, 2011

Tasty and refreshing, slightly sweet with mild malt, ending with a gentle grain taste. Hints of banana, honeycomb, and and straw, this ends so pleasant and easy it is hard to simply savor this excellent brew.
Mild an light bodied, this brew has a creamy middle that makes it quite pleasant.
Wow, another excellent beer from Weihenstephaner. This is easily becoming my favorite German brewery, as I've yet to have a bad beer from them. And, as one who is not particularly a fan of heffeweizens. Definitely give this one a try! 754 charactersTheHoppiest, Jul 16, 2011

S: All banana and clove with the obvious coriander notes in there as well. More banana than clove, but definitely quite a spicy aroma. There's also faint hints of orange in there.
T: Again, more banana flavor than anything else, but still quite balanced. It really is exceptionally smooth. I just find the banana to dominate a little too much in the taste for it to be perfect.
M: Could it get any better? Smooth, crisp and frothy at the same time, refreshes at every sip.
O: An absolutely superb weiss beer, but not my favorite; HackerPschorr is retaining that title for now. 763 charactersReelBigwigFish, Jul 13, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5poured into my Bruery tulip
Pours a golden color with plenty of cloudy white head. Very cloudy. 
Smells of banana bread spiced with clove. The clovey smell fades to reveal more banana. Like a yeasty banana bread that has just come out of the oven. 
Tastes of banana up front with some spice and bready yeastiness to follow. I get some orange peel in the back in the finish.
Overall, I an not usually a fan of the Hefe style but this beer most certainly my favorite of the style that I've ever had. This beer would be perfect for a session poolside on a sunny day. 567 charactersMarkVegas, Jul 12, 2011

appears a hazy golden straw color with big foamy bone-white head. strong aroma of herbal spiciness. clove and banana like usual for the style, but not personally that appealing to me.
luckily the banana-like flavors that i find off-putting are not as strong in the taste. body is fairly thin, fizzy carbonation. 
I know this beer is the standard for the style, but it's just not for me. I'll stick to the Dunkel version and the Korbinian. 514 charactersjmdrpi, Jul 12, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Typically when a brewery has been making the same beer for a while; a competitor has come along with something much better. The style can become stale, and somebody else improves the flavors (see Sam Smith, Oatmeal Stout). 
This is the third oldest beer recipe I have ever had (see DFH series). The brewery started in 1070.
I had this beer outside on a warm afternoon, which is ideal to enjoy a Hefe. The pour was into a wheat beer glass. 
I poured properly, but there was a lot of light head. I measured four fingers in my glass. It dissipated to two fingers, which held for quite a while. 
Off the foam I picked up banana esthers and wheat characteristics. It was a really nice set of clean smells.
The taste was similar to the bouquet. It was very refreshing. 
I really liked the beer. I look forward to the next time I drink it. 
Side note: my beer arrived with a lemon balanced on the top of the bottle. No quality hefeweizen should have fruit added to it. It masks the smells, and a beer with quality characteristics should not be hampered with the intrusion of fruit. I get why the bar did it... Widmer trained us to do this. But, for the love of Beer, don't add fruit to a good beer. 1,198 charactersummswimmin, Jul 11, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at The Farmhouse in Burlington. Was framed in a stange glass.
A: Sort of a sepia yellow. Or like the hair of that blonde girl on the beach when you were thirteen that one summer. It was a little cloudy She had to be six or seven years older, but you'd swear she winked when you saw her gawking. In any case, you were on vacation and would never see her again. Though you think of her from time to time, by the time you were old enough she'd probably be married and settled down. Best to leave that cloudy banana-yellow hair as a distant memory of your youth.
Beautiful day. The heady seafoam left lines where the waves hit the sand, lacing the beach like a white dress. Yeah, she'd be married by now.
S: The cottage you stayed in had a faint spicy scent like bananas and cloves. It was an alluring and strange scent; a bit foreign, and it made you wonder what the mysterious people who'd stayed here before were like.
T: "Probably just banana cream pie," someone commented at the time. You don't remember who. May have been your older brother, who moved to New Jersey for work and has two kids and is on his second wife.
The exotic illusion left your head, but a new one entered. The place was homey now. Sweet. Nothing so unusual as sweet banana cream and clove. There's also a bready taste to the kitchen air, though this isn't strong enough to carry through the rest of the cabin.
M: When you head back out to the beach, the girl is gone. The sand feels unusually fine between your toes, smooth and a little muddy. The foam collects on your feet and ankles and the little bubbles pop there, faint but enough that you can feel each minute explosion.
O: You don't have her in front of you right now, but you can look back at the framed picture of the beach and reminisce in a bittersweet way.

4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Can I just add in a 3rd review to this much-loved brew of mine? It's 12:33 on a Saturday afternoon in Columbia, which is currently about as hot as the Sammath Naur. I'm sitting here halfway through a growler of my beloved Weihenstephaner Hefe, which I am enjoying out of it's own glorious glass. Everything seems right with the world.
Since I've reviewed this beer twice over, let me take a different tack now and simply praise it some more. This may be the beer that has had the greatest shift in appeal for me, ever. At first review, way back in 2006, I was pleasantly surprised as up till then I "don't usually spring for Hefes". My how things have changed...
This beer currently sits under Westvleteren 8, Bourbon Sexual Chocolate, and 5 other beers on my top ten list. To be able to buy a growler (From Green's on Piney Grove, bless 'em) of my #8 rated beer of all time for a measly $10 is just such a wonderful thing... here is a brewery that has been around since the Dark Ages, still cranking out beer today. I don't know if the beer was better in the past or will be better in 2208, it is fantastic now.
The extreme drinkability of Weihenstephaner Hefe is maybe only matched by its balance. We have a puffy, creamy, mellow yet flavorful wheat beer boasting a superb finish, which is a stumbling block for most American brewers of this style (and many Germans as well). It fades out gently, with neither clove-spice nor lemon-sour nor fruity banana dominating, but all turning out the lights, tucking you into bed, and tiptoeing out the door quietly, making sure to shut the doors behind them. What's left in your mouth and mine is a delightful light sweetness, mineral water, wheat-dough, and spice flavor that is entirely inoffensive - and is actually great.
I suppose I could gush about this beer all day, but I have Things to Do. So let me just say, again, that an unfiltered Weihenstephaner Hefe out of the proper glass on a hot day is one of my favorite things in life. One day I will drink this close to the source and it will be good then, too. 
I do not exaggerate when I say that I think that enjoying Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is one of the infinite, small mercies of God. Prost indeed. 2,214 characterskkipple, Jul 09, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a golden yellow color with a touch of haze, a huge freaking white head, fades at a wicked slow rate, maybe a bit too slow since I want to start enjoy it sooner, oddly enough it doesn't leave much lacing on the glass.
Smell has a large presence of clove and coriander, light aroma of yeast and a bit of banana.
Taste is surprisingly straightforward at first with a sweet malt touch, hints of spice start to seep in, like coriander and clove and some citrus, mouthfeel seems thin and watery at times though, carbonation is soft but quite present and lends a subtle creaminess. 582 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Jul 07, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle code 4071, which if I'm interpreting correctly means it was bottled February 4th, 2011. Tasted July 6, 2011 in a 32oz crystal wine chalice (my only glass big enough to fit the entire bottle + the head). 
A: Cloudy faded orange color, bordering on a light tan. Lots and lots of very foamy white head (the head alone filled 2/3 of the glass on the initial pour). No visible sediment, but this beer is so cloudy it's barely translucent. 
S: Clove and a hint of spice on the initial pour which quickly faded to wheat and banana bread as it warmed and the head died down. No noticeable fruity scents other than banana. 
T: Bready wheat, yeast, hints of banana, with lots of clove in the mid-to-after taste. 
M: Tons of carbonation from very small bubbles. Good medium to full body texture. Yet the viscosity itself seems a bit low if you try to factor out the carbonation. 
O: What else can I say? This beer is the definition of a proper Hefeweizen. It's the benchmark by which all others are measured. There are some I enjoy more personally (eg. Live Oak Hefeweizen), but this is the classic. 1,100 charactersjnn4v, Jul 06, 2011

A: Golden with an abundance of carbonation, pour slowly into a tilted glass to avoid an overflow from the head.
S: Lots of spices to include coriander and cloves combined with the traditional smell of bananas.
T: Light, crisp, and the carbonation dances on the tongue. The spices are balanced exceptionally with the sweet from the banana leaving you with one of the best tasting and most well balanced Hefe's I've ever tasted.
M: Crisp, tingly, and light.
O: Great beer on those warm summer days/nights. Can't think of a better example of the variety. 741 characterstjkinate, Jul 05, 2011

This pours a hazy light orange color with a large white head which has good retention and leaves a film which never goes away. The smell is complex, its semi sweet with clove, spices, a yeast aroma and wheat. The feel is medium with high carbonation. The taste is very good lots going on, sweet malts, wheat, cloves, spices with a dry finish. This is a mighty fine beer. 452 charactersDavidST, Jul 04, 2011

S: Lots of wheat, honey, banana, clove, coriander and some citrus hints. The scents are quite potent, inviting you to taste this beer.
T: Starts off with a nice clean wheat and honey taste on the front end. The clove, banana, coriander and citrus are quite prevalent. On the back end the yeast and wheat comes back to the palate. The flavors blend extremely well, nothing is too overpowering. 
M: Leaves a slighty grainy taste on the palate. A nice amount of carbonation for this light bodied beer.
O: One of the best Hefeweizens you can try. Ranks right up there with the Penn Brewery Hefe, Troegs Dreamweaver and Fat Heads Summer Haze, in my opinion. Very clean and refreshing, perfect for those summer days. Certainly a must try for any Hefe fan. 899 charactersIronCitySteve, Jul 02, 2011

A: Poured from the 375ml bottle into Bruery Tulip glass. The beer pours a hazy honey color with a good two inches of frothy white head that very slowly receded, leaving nice lace behind, before finally settling at about three quarters of an inch. 
S: Soft scents of sweet clove, mild spice, banana, wheat toast, and a very mild esters of yeast. 
T: Well intergraded flavors. Layers of banana, lemon, some cloves, and toasted wheat bread. Mild mineral quality, but smooth and well rounded. 
M: Low to medium carbonation with a mild creamy medium body.
O: Hits the mark. Refreshing, balanced, and though not overly complex, it's brilliant in its execution, and quite enjoyable. Steal at $2.25 for a 375ml bottle too. 894 charactersRetsinis, Jul 02, 2011

I am not the biggest hefeweissen fan in the world, but this was the best example that I have had so far. It was smooth and full of flavor. The thing that stuck with me were the floral aromas.

Drank quite a few of these. Big cloudy bright body with a huge head that gives off a ton of yeast funk, deep rich almost deliciously stale fruit and a mountain of wheat sharpness. Taste is crisp, funky and with an excellent malt depth. Darn, this is a yummy beer. Mouthfeel is flawless, absolutely perfect. 
If you haven't ever had this, you need to. I'll post a bottle review sometime soon too, I sure do love to crack one of these after some gardening in the yard or just on the deck on a hot Sunday. 717 characterschicagoabbot, Jul 01, 2011

Pours a cloudy yellow/orange color with a huge head. Nice lacing down the glass.
Smells like bread, banana and cloves- just what you'd expect. I hate bananas.
Once again, opens with a huge banana flavor with some cloves mixed in, then the bread takes over to the finish. Aftertaste is gently spiced. Once again, I will say that I hate bananas but I'm really loving this beer.
Mouthfeel seems a bit thick for a beer like this, and the carbonation seems low also.
Overall, its really good. I would definitely get this again. 561 charactersbs870621345, Jul 01, 2011

The bubbles race with champagne tenacity from the bottom up to the head. Remarkable head retention to the last drop.
The smell of malted wheat and wild honey is immediate in the nose. Banana and spicy clove along with sharp citric notes of lemon and orange as well...very enticing. 
All the classic Hefeweizen notes are present. Ripe banana and clove, faint bubble gum and a hint of green apple tartness. Spicy and malty in the finish with an undercurrent of warming alcohol. Much more robust than most in the style. 
Mouthfeel is light, smooth and frothy. Slightly chewy, yet crisp and lively as the carbonation dances on the palette. 
The benchmark Hefeweizen. I could drink this every day. 810 charactersHumanParaquat, Jun 27, 2011

A - Pours a hazy mix of copper and deep honey-gold with 2 fingers of jolly white head. Effervescent bubbles stream up all sides of the glass.
S - Smells of tangy, fruity esters (typical of a good hefeweizen). Bready wheat comes through along with notes of coriander and citrus.
T - Dry and wheaty up front with a healthy dose of citrus quickly following it. Has a pleasing, balanced bitterness that becomes noticeable in the middle and lasts through the finish. This could simply be a by-product of not having the freshest bottle, but there is also a somewhat prominent (but not entirely off-putting) metallic flavor muddled in with everything else. This could also be related to the water that Weihenstephaner brewery uses.
M - Thinner body with very potent and refreshing carbonation. Crisp and clean like a true wheat beer should be! 968 charactersrundocrun, Jun 27, 2011

A) Arrived in a nice pilsner style glass. A bronze toned brew with a hazy/cloudy appearance that one would expect. There was a nice inch of white head. 
S) MMM... Wheat and some lemon, Malty sweetness.
T) Quite nice... The wheat and citrus blend well with some spice. It creates a beer with some sweetness to it, and a little bit of bitterness to make the finish quite refreshing.
M) A very crisp and clean feel. It's pretty light bodied. You can savor it a sip at a time, or in big gulps.
O) Hmm.... Oldest brewery in the world. I'd say they know what they're doing. 634 charactersRoamingGnome, Jun 25, 2011

Smell of wheat and citrus peel mostly, sweet malts in the background.
Taste is different than what I was expecting. There is way more tart & spice than I thought there would be. Sweet malts and citrus tart upfront smooth on the tongue with a really nice feel to it, followed up by the back end of this being a tad spicy. Nice little bite on the end & good aftertaste with notes of coriander if I am not mistaken. 
Picked this up for $2.79, which is a steal for a world class beer! Will be getting this one time and time again.
Overall, solid hefe! Personally Im not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this one definitely is one to remember. 827 charactershoptualBrew, Jun 22, 2011

Cloudy, but with no appreciable sediment floaters. Head dissipates at a moderately slow rate, but leaves almost no lacing which is surprising considering how dense the head initially looked.
S: Aromas of clove, banana, and an orangey citrus. Very pleasant and inviting. 
T: First sip dominated by strong clove flavors. Clove and banana flavors throughout. Hints of pear, coriander, occasional lemon zest, and a touch of black pepper. Some bread/dough flavors in the after taste. An impressive ability to maintain such a high sweetness but keeping it in a positive way without overtaking or ruining the drink. 
M/D: Great carbonation, smooth and easy to drink. Light on the tongue and leaves the mouth feeling wet and eager to take another sip. Slightly too light of a drink for my liking. But certainly goes down easy and leaves you ready for another. 
O: Overall, a very good drink that to me comes off like a lighter version of a good tripel. It’s a little too light for my liking, and I would prefer if it had some stronger, more lasting flavors. The style as a whole isn’t my favorite, but this is still a damn good beer and its one I will drink again when I am in the rare mood for a hefeweizen. 1,306 characterszac16125, Jun 17, 2011

Right now I'm drinking it at 61 degrees F (the beer, not the air), and it's just as good as always. In fact, it's a bit creamier right now, making it a-ok. There is nothing bad to say about this beer, ever...but if you do have something bad to say about it, well, then you're probably a Miami Heat fan.

on a hard pour, the glass fills with a huge pure white head that dominates the glass and raises up above the rim. it takes a while to settle yet doesn't lace overly well. not as cloudy as I predicted until I pour the yeast sludge into the glass.
aroma is lots of lemon pepper, wheat, banana, acidic (not bitter) citrus, and white bread dough. 
a candy-like sweetness hits the palate first before the spicy yeast and fruity esters take hold. it finishes a bit dry yet sweet.
medium and quite oily bodied with a soft, velvety carbonation that is at a generous level.
better than most american versions of wheat beers, though a bit too sugary sweet, still, for my palate. 786 characterssilentjay, Jun 14, 2011

Taste comes simple at first, but there are some complex flavors going on here. Light creaminess, slightly sweet, some lemons, cloves, and very faint banana. Finish is crisp and dry, mineral like, and there it is just like in the nose, a bit of smoke.

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I paid $1.79 for a single 12 oz bottle at Total Wine. The bottom of the back label had "1081" printed - not sure if that is a freshness date or lot number. There was some noticeable yeast in the bottle settled where the bottle lay.
When poured it produced a massive 3 inch lumpy almond white head that stuck all over the pint glass as it slowly receded. It was translucent orange blossom honey colored - beautiful for a hefe. 
It smelled of wheat, coriander, and sweet malts.
The flavors were complex and varied. sweet maltiness comes through the wheat and spices such as coriander, nutmeg, and I think some celery seed. I served it at about 38 degrees - colder than recommended. As it warmed, I got more of the banana bread qualities. Are there any hops in this? I got hints of the hops at the very end of the finish.
Great mouthfeel. It had just the right carbonation that helped cleanse the palate in preparation for the next sip. It was clean, refreshing, and fuller bodied than typical hefe's.
This is world class, but I guess if you've been doing it for 1000 years you ought to have figured it out by now. Next time instead of buying a couple bottles, I'll be opting for the six-pack. Great summer beer.
If you have never had hefeweissen then you should try this, if you don't like it, dont bother trying any others. If you have had others and haven't been impressed, try this one and it will help you make up your mind on the style. 1,445 charactersBelgiumBill, Jun 12, 2011

Taste: It tastes more like a Belgium tripel. It tastes weak and one dimensional; there is no body or depth to this beer. It tastes like a vitamin enriched Coor’s Light 
Mouthfeel: Little oily coating, but overall not much of an impact one way or another.
Overall: I can see on a hot, muggy, summer day it could be refreshing but it’s the same as putting a lemon slice in a glass water, very little impact overall. Don’t see what all the hype is, personally we could not even finish the bottle, admittedly it was my first example of the style and if this representative of the style, I’m not a fan. Maybe it would be good on a hot summer day, but it’s not summer, not hot and not even day, it’s Saturday night and I wanted something with punch, so I drain poured it. 1,026 charactersheysuz, Jun 12, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4A bottle stamped with “The World’s Oldest Brewery:” as a lover of craft beer, how could I pass that up? Here we have Weihenstephaner’s Hefeweissbier, which is a classic not just because it’s ancient. As far as Hefes go, this is one of the heavy hitters. Mention Hefes and someone will probably bring up Weihenstephaner. And they’ve definitely earned that street cred – the brewery’s been operational for nearly 1000 years. Impressive, yes, but how does this beer stack up when under the scrutiny of modern tastes? Let’s find out…
A: A cloudy, unfiltered, glorious golden body. My pour, though quite unhurried, yields the biggest head I’ve seen in a long time. This beer is even foamier than Duvel, and that’s saying something! But it’s a healthy, organic foam, with a wonderful continuous showing of carbonation. Hell of a lot of lacing, too. Thick, bubbly, rich – a great start.
S: An incredibly phenolic nose. Clove and medical notes comprise the acidic showing, filling the senses until there’s no room for anything else…at first. Somehow, a hint of malt squeezes in, alongside some slight biscuity tones and the obligatory cherry-pear-banana-peach Hefe fruitiness. Still, the biggest scent is the lemony acid of the fermented yeast.
T: There’s one word that comes to mind when I take my first sip: “mature.” It’s monstrously easy to tell, through the mellow and balanced feel this beer has, that a lot of maturity went into the brewing process. Nearly a millennia of practice tends to produce some good results. Anyway, the first flavor specifically to hit is a lemony freshness – that acidic zest that I was expecting. The fruits that follow range from sweet and juicy to tart and puckering – apple, berry, pineapple, banana, grape. These are complex wheats like I’ve never had before. The back end isn’t dry or hoppy in any way; just bready. A calm aftertaste that really seals the deal on a Hefe palate that needs nothing more.
M: This is where my biggest concern is. It’s watery, plain and simple. Not watery like a Bud Light; watery like too thin for a palate this advanced. Colder, this beer would make so much more sense: the carb would be more noticeable and this wouldn’t be so much of a turn-off. As it stands now, though, with the beer warming to room temperature, the first discomfort becomes known. Not terrible, but it could have been so much more.
O: All mouthfeel problems aside, this is an impressively addictive Hefeweizen. Normally, I’m not a fan of said style, and tend to shy away from a second glass. Not here, though: Weihenstephaner really has its stuff figured out. I’ve heard it said before, and I’ll say it again myself: this is the world’s premiere Hefeweizen. No doubt about it. In fact, I’m adding this to my list of “On-tap Must-Haves,” so, from now on, I will check for this at every establishment I patronize. Can’t wait! 2,931 charactersBarryMFBurton, Jun 12, 2011

T: The clove and banana really come through not just in the smell, but the taste as well and in the same ratio of more clove than banana.

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a flared flute glass at Bauer's Brauhaus.
My final glass at the Brauhaus. It's been fun, but I've gotta get outta here sometime, right? Figured I'd go out on a note that's been advertised as a high one. It pours a hazy pale straw topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises wheat, banana, very light, clove, black pepper, and lemon zest. The taste brings in more of the same, but with more black pepper and the addition of some light nutmeg. A nice current of orange zest comes in as well, tying everything together quite nicely. The body is a sorta hefty-leaning light, with a very light moderate carbonation, a lightly creamy feel, and a crisp finish. Overall, though this is not the best hefe I've ever had, it is damn close, and a damn fine beer all around. Good times. 799 charactersTMoney2591, Jun 06, 2011

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz. bottle served into a weissbier glass
Pours a very hazy combination of yellow and orange. It's light yellow around the edges of the glass, but there is a solid column of orange in the center. The strangest part is that these colors are distinct from each other, not blended in. Three fingers of dense, meringue-like head billow up, a mountain of small, fine bubbles. It laces like a dream. I can't imagine that the Hefeweizen style can look any better than this. 
Everyone knows how a Hefeweizen is supposed to smell. It's supposed to have zippy wheat aroams. It's supposed to have estery yeast aromas of banana, bubblegum, and clove. It's supposed to have a little bit of lemon. Weihenstephaner has all of these things. Where it excels at is balancing the aromas. I've never had a Hefe that is as balanced as Weihenstephaner's offering. The lemony wheat provides a sturdy backbone for the yeast scents. Clove and banana compliment each other perfectly, with small undertones of bubblegum and a nearly medicinal phenolic (that is vaguely reminiscent of seaweed) smell working to round off the edges. 
The taste is just as phenomenally balanced. All of the flavors are so well-balanced and so well-integrated that it tastes like one flavor (as opposed to numerous flavors overlapping). It's remarkable how well the clove and zippy malted wheat draw out the best in each other. Weihenstephaner delivers no unexpected flavor. What sets it apart, again, is the balance between everything. This is a remarkable, inspiring example of brewing. My one qualm with this beer is that the finish is too bready. The zippyness gives way to a wheat bread flavor that I wish weren't there. Flat finish aside, this is astonishing. 
The mouthfeel is pretty lovely too. It's very thick, very creamy. When looking to nit-pick, I'd say it is too creamy. Some of the refreshing carbonation is lost. Still, it's a very satisfying mouthfeel. Overall, this is probably the best Hefeweizen I've ever had. It's nearly perfect. A must-try for every single beer drinker. 2,050 charactersReaper16, Jun 05, 2011

I was actually able to get all the yeast off the bottom of this one. Lots of carbonation. Huge fluffy white 3 finger head. Like a cloud from heaven. Great lacing. Could've had more haziness.
S: Big wheaty, banana aroma. Nice lemony scent right behind it. Very fresh. Little fresh dough scent lingers.
T: Very upfront citrusy banana flavor. Mild wheaty, earthy tones bringing up the rear. 
M: Full-bodied. Faint fizziness. Creamy.
O: An exceptional Hefe. I'm sure this is, or should be, the standard by which all Hefe's are judged. I mean, they've been brewing since 1040! Almost 1000 years! I'm still partial to the Sierra Nevada Kellerweis (maybe because they tweaked it to american tastes?) But this is almost a perfect beer. 836 charactersdoughanson78, Jun 03, 2011

A slow pour yields a massive 3-finger creamy of white head that recedes slowly but never disappears. The body is a hazy pale golden straw color with literal jets of rising carbonation bubbles. Slight lacing clings to the sides of the glass throughout consumption. All in all, this is one gorgeous looking beer.
A strong wheat aroma is complimented by a spicy clove scent. Notes of banana, green apple, and bubblegum can all be found within the complex nose.
This beer tastes exactly as its nose implies. The flavors of wheat and clove have a nearly creamy quality while a strong banana note adds to the character of the beer.
Light to medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer has fantastic drinkability. The carbonation permits the flavors to stick around for just the right amount of time.
Definitely one of my favorite beers, Weihenstephan's Hefeweissbier is a summer staple for me. The complex yet mellow flavors allow this beer to be both examined and chugged. It is the perfect example of the style. 1,076 charactersoutput01x, May 30, 2011

typical hefeweizen brew. A cloudy peach colored beer which a huge amount of thick, dense and pillowy off-white head.

Huge amounts of banana, orange, clove and spice. Maybe just a touch of bubblegum in there as well. Great aroma on this one.

Similar to nose but not as dominant. Lots of wheat along with the typical banana, citrus and spice. Subtle sweetness and bitterness. Very drinkable as it's not too "in your face" with flavor.

A little on the light side....great carbonation however. I could use a little more body but still a good feel. A little dry finish which I like.

Best before date: December.22.2011
Appearance- Pours a nice semi-cloudy golden straw colour with a massive four fingers of fluffy white head that very slowly dissipates to a fluffy bubbly top of head that does subside but never really goes away, a very sexy looking beer to be honest.
Smell- Can definitely smell the yeast right away and it has a clove spice to it on the nose, the usual bready malt aromas are also very present and a nice fruity aroma of bananas and citrus fruit come through in the backbone. 
Taste- Very similar to the smells although the spices from the cloves play a much more major role on the palate hitting you right away, the citrusy fruits come in next with the unripe banana taste coming through more than the citrusy notes. Again the usual bready malt flavours are there in the taste as well although not as predominant as in the smell and a hint of yeast comes through in the taste as well, overall a very complex tasting Hefe.
Mouthfeel- A medium bodied Hefe that has great carbonation, definitely very smooth, crisp, and easy drinking as well. Although sampled at cellar temps I’m sure a nice cold one would be very thirst quenching on those warm spring days
Overall- There is a reason why this one is rated so high and it does deserve all its praise, the smells are great and the taste is even more complex, overall just a great hefe and worthy of a world class beer. Honestly I feel almost privileged that this is a regular offering at the crappy old government dominated LCBO, a definite go to when is search of this style of brew and pretty much the benchmark from what I compare others in this category to as well, very quality and well worth it. 1,771 charactersRoke87, May 22, 2011

When brought to the nose the flavors intensify with bread subsiding and clove taking the lead, followed shortly by banana. Taste follows the nose with clove and banana leading, with the finish almost tasting like a slice of citrusy banana bread. Lemon is also in the finish but very mild. Drinkablilty is very very high.

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours cloudy yellow in color with a massive 3 finger foamy white head that looks like a cloud of bubbles; the head lasted a long time, dropping slowly as the cloudy head turned into a snowy sculpture and left great foamy lacing as it went down. 
Smells of yeast, sweet malt, lemon, clove, grass, spices like pepper, banana and soft fruity notes; really nice and for a lack of better words, it smells happy and inviting.
Tastes of sweet malt, yeast, lemon, banana, clove and the classic metallic funky-ness from the yeast, which tingles and prickles the tongue and then gives way to coriander, pepper and other spices, some orange peel, tart apple or pear, citrus hops, wheat and some very light bready grains. Wow, talk about a great summer session beer, this brew has been going for hundreds of years for a reason – it is damn tasty. 
Mouthfeel is light, crisp and refreshing, and yet smooth, creamy and slick at the same time; this has very light to almost zero carbonation, a dry finish on the tart side that almost feels like the beer evaporates after each swallow. 
A great beer that has just the right balance of everything that a hefeweizen should have; the clove, spices and banana are mild and perfect and won’t turn off a “regular” beer drinker. This is the standard for this style and I’m glad I had it again with the ability to savor and review it. A very high recommendation on any day, and the fact that I got it at a super market for $2.99 per 25 oz bottle makes this the bargain of the year so far. 1,528 charactersCHickman, May 17, 2011

An exceptionally good combination of banana & oranges blended with a mix of lemon, clove and wheat. A truly excellent smelling beer that gets better each time.
A great tasting banana flavour upfront that is combined with cloves and oranges and a hint of citrus in the background. Fantastic and a beer I could drink all night long.
Smooth and incredibly refreshing, the beer goes down so well and feels great. It is light to medium bodied with perfect carbonation.
Absolutely fantastic all round & definitely one the best beers I have ever tried. Exactly what a hefeweizen should taste like & one that everyone should try.

M- Semi-crisp, medium body.
O-Still the perfect wheat beer, just in time for the warm weather. 445 charactersWillCarrera, May 12, 2011

S: Strong smell of banana bread with a hint of orange and lemon.
T: Banana and other citrus flavors right off the bat. Perfect combination of wheat, clove, and banana flavors to make this taste so refreshing.
M: Smooth and creamy. Light and refreshing.
O: This beer is the epitome of its style for a reason. Incredibly drinkable. I try to always keep some on hand whether I want to enjoy a refreshing beer or cleanse my palate between contrasting styles. 605 characterssbennett22, May 10, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a golden-tan-orange body with a lofty 3 finger head. Plenty of rising bubbles maintain this nice head. Smells of metallic banana with a hint of wheat bread. The best tasting hefeweizen I have ever had. Very pure in flavor, begins with an alcohol feel and then sets in the banana bread flavor. A wonderful dry finish tops off the flavor and leaves you wanting the next sip. Truly the best hefeweizen I have ever had. 421 charactersBeerbluesbiology, May 08, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a beautiful cascading cloudy orange, quite light and almost marmalade-hued at the bottom of the glass, and a more opaque orange prior to the head. Nice frothy white head sits atop and dissipates slowly. 
Nose is filled with orange, banana and peach. A slight bit of clove. A very strong and pleasant smell. 
Taste is great. Very similar to the nose, with banana, orange and peach coming though, but a taste of bubblegum is present as well. Cloves come through strongly in the finish.
Body is very refreshing, but not too light. Perfect for the summer. Carbonation is a little strong for my liking, though I suppose it is fairly in line with the style. 
Overall, a fantastic hefeweien. Since we in Ontario are pretty restricted in our beer choices by the whims of the LCBO, I am very happy that this one is a regular part of its offerings. Now that it is getting warm out, I will be drinking a lot of this one. 919 charactersjrenihan, May 08, 2011

The aromas coming from this beer are classic Hefewizen. Bannana, clove, fresh baked bread. The taste is spot on as well. Bannana and clove is what I get first, then some nice bready flavors on the finish. Creamy body and nice carbonation. I love this beer. 333 charactershabanosdarklord, May 07, 2011

S- This is what a Hefe should smell like. Banana bread right out of the oven.
T-The banana is there with a salty clove finish. this is a fantastic summer beer and pretty damn good the rest of the year also.
MO- I could drink this beer everyday and I think I might start keeping it around more often. The only bad thing is that every other Hefe wont measure up. This is the beer that the hefe characteristics were written about. 563 charactersconfer, May 04, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into the curved weisse glass from the gift pack. Attempted to do it traditional style, pretty much failed on that. (Will not be holding my poor pour against the score!)
Appearance- After it settled down, excellent amount of head with lacing throughout. Hazy golden color, like a hefeweizen should have.
Smell- Exactly what you should expect from the style. Lots of cloves and bananas. Pleasant, but not overpowering in any way.
Taste- Again, bananas and cloves, a very full taste, but still very easy drinking.
Mouthfeel- Exceptional! Despite the full taste, this in no way taxed my palate. As light on the tongue as a BMC lager, but with a taste that rivals any beer.
Overall- Had to go the full monte on this one. In addition to the combination of drinkability and full flavor, you can taste history while drinking this beer. This is the hefeweizens all others are measured against, and for a good reason. 940 charactersphillybeer7779, May 03, 2011

Weihenstephan is the world's oldest operating brewery with a history dating back to 1050 a.d. They even have a university dedicated to the art of brewing. The brew pours a cloudy golden amber color and maintains a sudsy, persistent head. Aromas of bananas, cloves, yeast, and wheat are prevalent. The taste is full and abound with no particular flavor overpowering any other flavor, yet they all stand out individually. This is one to be tried by all who seek good brew! Even those who don't like hefeweizens find that they like this a lot. 560 charactersRashyGrillCook, May 02, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of life's simple pleasures, maybe not to simple. This beer has head for days, I got a little carried away in the pour and had to suck the overflowing head. Needless to say the head is better than three fingers of dense foam. The color is slightly hazy, matching a 10 on the SRM beer color chart. Very sticky lace that clung to the glass to the end. Smell is fascinating, with aromas of banana, cloves, tangelo, peach, and sun dried sweet wheat. Taste is almost beyond words and this is from someone who is not much of a fan of wheat beer. There are a myriad of flavors weaving in and out of each mouthful. There is banana, cloves, orange, lemon, vanilla, cinnamon, did I mention banana, well it was just great. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, with lots of tingle. Just a pleasure to drink. Hard to come by or I would have much more of this. 847 charactersbeerprovedwright, Apr 29, 2011

pours out of the half litre brown bottle a hazy sunset gold colour with a large meringue like head. ample lace. wonderful yeast, spicy wheat and lemon aromas; plenty of banana esters, orange and some hints of clove. smells really bright and fresh. spicy malted wheat flavour careens to the lemon and spice side...some grassy notes with a good dose of apple, banana, vanilla, and clove to round things out. lighter body than i was expecting with a mouthfeel that runs more crisp than creamy albeit refreshing and replenishing...it lets all the flavours bounce around splendidly. this is outstandingly drinkable with a overall "wow" factor that will make me revisit this all summer now that it's available to me.
hit the spot after a day of yardwork on a sunny and warm spring day! 808 charactersbudgood1, Apr 28, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A few and, sadly, far between bottle of the famed Hefeweissbier. The last time I had this it was exactly what I needed. This time was no different.
It pours the standard for hefeweizens, a glorious gold that makes you believe it is clear, even as the truth is before your eyes. Enormous cloud of white foam and staining on the glass that I wish I could copy next Halloween into my pumpkin. Sweet wheat, sweet, ripe banana, and a punch of some clove. Barely bittered, the sweet notes ripple over each other in an earnest attempt on my affection. So smooth and worthy of princes to bathe in. On the sweet side, certainly, but the banana finish is delightful. 
I need to be drinking this beer more often. Here comes summer. 720 charactersdragonWhale, Apr 28, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz bottle, batch/date coded
A - Cloudy, and almost glowing pale gold body with a voluminous white head that retains excellently well and leaves good lacing down the glass. Constant streams of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. Very inviting.
S/T - Both similar with banana and clove up front and a yeasty, wheat like finish.
M - Light body, high carbonation, crisp and refreshing on the finish with a very slight tartness/bitterness as well.
O - Wow, not bad for being about 6 months old according to the batch coding! I can't imagine how much more tasty this would be fresh from the source. This beer just screams refreshing, and was perfect for this warm spring day. My favorite weissbeer to date. I'll definitely buy this again. 740 charactersgaruda, Apr 27, 2011

Appearance-Couldy Orange color with a big 3 finger silky white head which leaves little lacing.
Smell-Banana and spice aroma with hints of orange and lemon. Some yeast coming through as well.
Taste-Upfront you get the yeast, malt and wheat. The lemon and orange peel comes through along with some cloves and some black pepper. The finish leaves me with a banana/clove combo lingering on my tongue.
Mouthfeel-Light to Medium carbonation with a nice amount of carbonation. Very refreshing.
Overall-Very good beer, very smooth and refreshing, and could go real well with food. Very Reasonable as well. 625 charactersSWMeyer4141, Apr 26, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I must say, I had expectations for what this would taste like, but it really took me by surprise.
The head on this beer is beautiful. I poured moderately gently and got a huge head. Hazy yellow hay color is just what I would expect.
The smell was less intense than I thout it would be. I expected banana and slight clove. I would say I got more of a slight clove and slight banana smell. There is some kind of coriander or lemon zest smell, but I know they did not use spices.
The taste, while wonderful really threw me off. I expected an intense banana ester. I would say it is more balanced between cloves and banana than it leans towards one or the other. What I really noticed on the first sip was a high level of carbonation. I knew it would be high, but I didn't realize how high it would be. It really helps to keep it easily drinkable and light feeling.
Overall, this is a great beer. I expected differently, but what I got, I liked. I wish this had a date on the bottle just so I could know if it would have been different fresh. 1,039 charactershonkey, Apr 26, 2011
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale cloudy egg-yolk color with a monster 3 finger white head that persists forever leaving great lacing.
Aroma is very phenolic with bananas, cloves and very subtle citrus lemon zest. Malts come in the background with a bready character.
Taste follows nose with lots of yeast aromatics again with banana and cloves but also bubblegum/fruity. The malts come thru with bread and sweet grains. 
Mouthfeel is extremely refreshing with sparkling carbonation and a light body. But despite the high low body there is lots of flavor and it is hard to stop drinking.
This beer sets the standard for the Hefeweissen style and it totally lives up to the hype. It is the best one by far. 688 characterspaulozanello, Apr 26, 2011

A: Cloudy pale orange color. Cloudy but no sediment. (Overly) aggressive pour led to a humongous fluffy white head that led to steady but spotty lacing.
S: Wheat, banana, tangy citrus and yeast. Very nice, fresh and delicious smelling.
T: Really smooth, yet sweet and spicy flavor. Tastes exactly the same as the smell. Wheat and banana and some clove or other ground spice I can't quite identify. Yeast flavor is present as well but it's not "yeasty." Some very mild hop.
M: Medium body, lightly but amply carbonated. Coats the mouth really nicely and leaves it dry and aching for more - for which I am more than happy to oblige.
O: This is a wonderful wheat beer - one that should be (and is) held up as *the* standard of hefeweizens. This is one of my favorite beers and will get plenty of glass time as the weather warms. 897 characterssuspect, Apr 21, 2011

A: copper orange with a 3 finger white fluffy head that has pretty good retention and leaves nice lacing.
S: The smell is of oranges, lemon zest, and cloves. This is a very pleasant and welcoming smell on a spring day.
T: The taste pretty much follows the smell except there’s a little bit more tartness than I had anticipated. The cloves come through a little more than the lemons/oranges, but those are there as well.
M: Crisp and clean up front with lingering peppercorn stickiness at the finish. Perfect carbonation and appropriate viscosity, although I would have liked a little bit thinner at the finish.
O: If I had not been privy enough to have had live oak hefe on several occasions, most recently a few weeks ago, this probably would have gotten a higher score from me. It is my favorite for the style that I am easy to find in the Midwest. However, it does not touch live oak it terms of my absolute favorite for the style (I did a side by side recently as well). 1,016 charactersglazeman, Apr 21, 2011

S: Bananas, spices, definitey cloves and earthy yeast with some malted wheat and no real hop aroma.
T: Malted wheat, some yeast, fruity banana esters with spices. Don't taste the bananas and spices as much as I smelled them, delicious none the less.
M: Crisp, clean and refreshing. Slightly sweet up front but finishes nice and dry.
O: This is great, I'm not usually a big hefe drinker but this one is really good, blows all the other ones I've tried out of the water. Will be drinking plenty of these on hot summer days. 743 charactersAzurescens, Apr 20, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5APPEARANCE: This beer, poured from a bottle into a weizen glass, produced a beautiful 1-1/4" frothy white head with excellent lacing that dissipated slowly. The body was a hazy pale gold with yellow highlights and lively carbonation.
AROMA: Hard to believe it could be better. Ripe banana, moderate wheat, a hint of doughy yeast, a very, very light, almost nonexistent citrus hops note, and a moderate fragrance of bubblegum, clove, and a light hint of spices and vanilla.
TASTE: Moderate wheat, light citrus and dough with moderate banana, bubblegum, clove and spices. Very nice indeed.
MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a medium-light body, a creamy texture, a moderately sweet initial flavor that didn't change except to add a slight hint of bitterness at the end of the medium length finish. Carbonation was lively and there was excellent body lacing that dissipated slowly.
DRINKABILITY: The best hefeweizen I've tasted to date. Seemed to combine a rich body and strong taste with great drinkability. I could easily drink these all night long and would serve it to anyone any time. 1,081 characterspaulginva, Apr 19, 2011

S - Smells delicious. Honey and banana with subtle floral notes. 
T - One of, if not the best hefes I've ever had. Full of crispness and flavor. Slightly sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. The best way I can describe the flavor is "delicate." No off flavors whatsoever.
M - One of the best aspects of this beer is it's mouthfeel. This beer seriously has a glorious mouthfeel. The head is immaculate. The beer itself is completely balanced. Creamy yet spritey. 
O - You need to drink this beer, damnit. 591 charactersloobear, Apr 17, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap to have again in a mug at Biergarten Haus DC.
Biggest difference in appearance is the great foamy head with the great looking to go buttery yellow body.
The nose is just bigger and more varied. With the sweet lemon is now butter, even cinammon it seems and banana. Crispness sense is gone. It smells fantastic.
Taste is still super solid but less tangy and much more bold bringing out everything in the nose in balance, lemon, banana, clove, cinammon, with a great malt density.
This is truly a beer to have on tap it really shines. 547 characterssmakawhat, Apr 16, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Doherty's East Ave.
A: Perhaps the definition of "straw yellow." Cloudy, opaque, excellent looking. Whip cream white head on top, good lacing.
S: Fresh. Banana, faint citrus hops, coriander, yeast, bread.
T: Exactly like the nose leads on. Incredibly crisp flavors of mellow citrus hops (contradictory?), banana, bubble gum. Lastly is the touch of mint that just makes this ridiculously refreshing.
M: Light body, super crisp, lower carbonation. 
O/D: I've never had a "hefe" I thoroughly enjoyed. I don't know if it's the style in general, or just the ones I have had up to this point. I looked this beer up, and luckily it was on tap. I just had to have it after looking at reviews. I must say, easily the best Hefeweizen I've ever had. This beer singlehandedly is making me go out and look for others in the style (even though I doubt anything will be able to compare). If you find it, try it. 911 charactersmostpoetsdo, Apr 16, 2011

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Although not my go-to style, I can certainly appreciate a good hefeweizen from time to time, and this is a very good hefeweizen. Poured from the bottle, the color is a warm, creamy-looking yellow-orange, with a big, fluffy, foamy white head. The fragrant aroma spills out with the prototypical German yeast characteristics of banana and clove to go along with a wheaty earthiness. The flavor is primarily an airy, lightly-sweet, and mildly fruity combination of unripe banana, milled wheat, and yeast. Despite the lightness of the flavors, the body is actually quite substantial, but the the fine carbonation makes it seem fluffy and smooth. Overall, I could identify a few little things that could be a bit better, but in the end this beer is just wonderful. 759 charactersdevilben02, Apr 13, 2011

Aroma is a nice mix of clove and banana--smells a lot like summer to me.
Taste is a tart but well-balanced mix of clove, banana, and hints of spice and bubble gum. Finishes nice and crisp with a touch of citrus.
Light to medium-bodied with lively carbonation that dances across the tongue.
I'm glad I picked this up to compare to a well-regarded (somewhat) local hefe. It rekindled my affection toward this style that is suited so well to these warmer months. 531 charactersMattyV, Apr 11, 2011

Light pour and it was foaming like crazy, after everything finally settled and I finally emptied the bottle I had a 1.5 finger head with excellent retention. Hazy orange in color
Strong banana peel and clove aroma, orange is there as well.
The banana peel comes through strong in the flavor as well, clove and another kind of spiciness is apparent and a pleasant orange taste is lying under everything else. A muskiness is imparted by something. That's about it though.
Smooth as can be, good balance of flavors carbonation feels very light and I like it like that.
Overall great example of the style and one I'd be happy to have in my fridge any day 751 charactersFenris244, Apr 11, 2011

4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a proper hefeweizen glass, swirled and poured the sediment. Everything as it should be and, wow, the appearance alone is reaping rewards. Quintessential hefeweizen look here, the peachy color being entirely clouded over, sporting a two-finger thick cap of pillow-fluff foam. I kinda just want to sit here staring, as if at a beautiful woman, but there is other work to be done...
Plenty of yeast-driven banana aroma, lighter spices and a considerable tug of wheat/grain. Gentle, mellow, pleasant, solid.
Be careful...drinking this too cold does not do the beer justice. I know that from past experience with it. Seems something that could be left unsaid, but serious, subtleties will be lost. And this beer is largely about subtleties. A generous layer of banana forms the foundation, laying large on the surface, but underneath there are a myriad of spices that you might find in a variety of desserts, sweeter ones -- just saying "clove" would be too simplistic. There are notes of various fruit juices, especially pear and peach; faint but really nice bubblegum; wheat is soft and gentle, earthy and hearty, another subtlety but one that makes all the difference. 
Texturally this is soft, slick, silky but no lack of presence. Carbonation is forward but hardly annoying. Even causes a light fruity pucker, especially the in the finish.
Hugely refreshing. Stupidly refreshing. What a way to ring in some beautiful spring weather... 1,450 charactersMetalmonk, Apr 07, 2011

T: It tastes mostly of spices and wheat. It leaves a very crisp and refreshing feeling. The aftertaste is great, consisting of a profound wheatiness.

S - A strong point for wheat beers, the aroma is a strong bouquet of banana and clove spice. It has a hint of bubble gum sweet smell as well. 
T - Starts with a banana taste, then dry type malt is the main character. Plenty of "yeastiness" in here, baked bread. Sweetness combines well with the savory clove in there too, very nice.

Very solid for the style. One of the best for sure. 369 charactersStaveHooks, Apr 06, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a weizen glass.
A- Hazy golden yellow with some orange hues, high carbonation, and nice 3 finger rocky head that leaves spotty dropped lacing around the glass. Never seen lacing like that before.
S- Banana, yeast, spice, and bubblegum notes
T- Banana, spice, yeast, bubblegum, and a little bit of a hop presence
M- Good carbonation, very smooth, thicker mouthfeel than I was expecting, but slightly watery towards the back.
O- This is a great beer. I can't believe I put off hefeweizens for so long but I am glad I have been on a hefe kick lately because it is quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. This is such a great refreshing, flavorful, and smooth drinking beer that I will definitely be getting more of. 749 charactersHoptometrist, Apr 06, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle, poured into a Weizen glass.
A: Hazy, straw yellow color. The pour dropped a huge three finger head that faded to a thin rim, and left little lace. Just about perfect for the style.
A: Big notes of banana, clove, and spice. A small grassy aroma is present. Notes of wheat, herbs, and small lemon.
T: Again, pretty much spot on for the style. Bannana, clove, grass, lemon, and spice. Spicey in the middle and finishes slightly dry with no hint of alcohol.
M: Tingely from the aggressive carbonation. Smooth, light body.
O: For the style, I really can't see a beer being any better. This is everything a hefe should be and more. Excellent. Skal. 655 charactersGtreid, Apr 05, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - This beer pours a beautiful hazy golden yellow color. It has a huge fluffy 4-finger white head on it. The head has good retention and leaves some nice lacing on the glass. There are some rising carbonation bubbles visible as well.
S - It smells of bready wheat and some spicy yeast. There are some big fruit here, mostly banana. Also, there is some clove and citrus. This beer smells great.
T - The taste starts off with a bready malt flavor. There is a big banana taste, as well as some clove and citrus. The finish is dry and a tad bitter. The aftertaste is of spicy yeast.
M - It has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down really easy, and has a smooth feel to it. The finish is dry and there is some subtle spiciness from the yeast.
O - This has great drinkability. It goes down easy, and it is very refreshing. This is a perfect anytime beer. Great flavor, and a solid example of the style. I would definitely recommend trying this one. 959 charactersJizackFH, Apr 01, 2011

S - Very wheaty nose with some slight pepper but mostly fresh fruit and lemon.
T & M - Awesomely smooth and awesomely fresh. Lots of malt sweetness and fruits in the mouth. bananas and lemons then a mellowing with some spices of clove and a little pepper. The end of the taste is a great exhale of banana. The beer is medium bodied and creamy with a good amount of carbination and a great clean finish.
O - Wow what a fantastic beer. I am glad I had it now because i could see having a lot of these this summer. Great look and a exceptional taste. The beer is just plain fresh and smooth. Get one.

A. Poured 3+ finger head. Thick lacing. Great retention. Color is a rich golden yellow. 
S. Yeast, banana, clove, lemon, citrus, pale malt. Smells very refreshing. Smells like summer.
T. Banana, clove, yeast, lemon. Spices overtop a real nice sweet pale malt base. Kind of beer you could drink all day on a hot summer day. 
M. Great mouthfeel. Medium/full bodied. Medium/high carbonation. Finishes pretty clean and dry. This to me is the essence of good warm weather.

4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first review here. 
Up until today, I had only ever had Pyramid as far as "hefeweizens" go. Blasphemy, I know. But considering that I hate that beer, I was skeptical to give others a try.
A: Pours a beautiful golden, hazy color with about 3 fingers worth of frothy white head.
S: Unbelievable amounts of banana and spices. Some citrus characteristics and a nice pungent scent that really has me aching to try this one.
T: Doesn't disappoint in the slightest. Tons of banana and clove pour out of this one. Front of the mouth it's all banana, middle of the tongue I get a nice kind of sour/pungent flavor, finishes with a nice yeast characteristic. Very, very refreshing. I wish I had another because I'd take it down in an instant. World class in my opinion. I didn't know hefeweisbier had potential like this. I'll be getting more of this soon.
M: Velvety. That's the best I can describe it. Nice carbonation, and a light body helps this one go down with ease. Very soft and smooth going down.
D: Tons of drinkability with this one. This beer is filling, which is the ONLY thing holding it back from being a nice sessioner in the summer. Amazingly refreshing, crisp, and enjoyable. I can't wait to have another. 1,221 charactersSeaOfShells, Mar 28, 2011

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice translucent honey that borders more on orange than gold. The bright-white head is immense and deliciously foamy. Great yeasty/wheat-driven aroma, with strong notes of clove and banana. The taste is medium-bodied and slightly sweet, with a minimal hop presence. A bit of tart fruitiness from the yeast complements the wheat very well. Carbonation is absolutely perfect and is helped by the excellent head retention.
I picked this up the other day after checking the top German beers list (and to encourage the warm weather to come a little faster!) I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all, though my wheat beer palate probably isn't as refined as it could be. Overall very refreshing and extremely drinkable. Gimme a liter of this on a hot summer day and I'll be a happy man! 791 charactersBMoldy, Mar 25, 2011

S: some banana, cloves, but not overpowering
T: the taste is great, so smooth, tingles the tongue, all the flavors of clove, banana and pepper just blend so well, not one of them dominates the other.
M: medium body, lots of bubbles.
O: this is a great beer, cheap, easy to find, probably the top beer of its style, I will be buying this one quite often. 481 charactersBeerBodisafa, Mar 25, 2011

Intense spicy wheat aroma. Pepper and cloves with a citrus edge.
Very creamy with a crisp taste. Light and sweet. Not as spicy as the aroma indicates but still a nice pepper kick to offset the wheat sweetness. Lemon/orange tang. Needs saying again, this is very creamy with a light carbonation tang. Evaporates in the mouth, as if the beer converts to head as you drink. 481 charactersbirderbeerer, Mar 25, 2011
3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Always a tricky pour. Virtually pours itself such is the heady intensity. Deep hazy yellow in colour this is quite fizzy and rather spicy on the tongue. Reminiscent of Duvel on the nose. Leaves small dollops all ovef the glass as it goes down.
Taste dilutes as it hits the middle palate and though a fine drink this lacks some omph to me and could do with some more depth.Nice enough but I'm with Michael Jackson on this one. 425 charactersZimbo, Mar 24, 2011

S: fruit salad. banana, orange slices, melon, apple. a hint of clove. peppery, almost cinnamon-like.
T: lemon, banana. more on the clove side than the banana in my opinion. baked bread. very smooth and rounds itself over the palate. very desirable peppery component. 
M: slightly sticky on the gums and tongue. feels a little more fluffy than effervescent. significantly dry finish. light to medium body. 
D: i can definitely see why this is THE example for this style of beer. it's nice to see a top example that is so easy to find. 727 charactersJimmys, Mar 24, 2011

Appearance-Medium yellow in color, with a slight cast of haze. Tall, creamy white head with fine bead, good retention, and nice lacing. 
Aroma-Bready wheat, strong clove phenolics, and moderate ripe banana esters, for an overall spiced banana bread aroma.
Flavor-Follows aroma, with spicy cloves first, followed by bananas and wheaty bread. Slight toasty/smoky note in the finish.
Mouthfeel-Medium light body, spritzy high carbonation, light carbonic prickle. Effervescent. Awesome.
Superbly drinkable, superbly delicious, all around a phenomenal beer. This is the quintessential hefeweizen. Can't say enough good things about it. 678 charactersplfahey, Mar 23, 2011

Scent is spicy with great clove and banana aromas. Amazing scents of wheat and pepper. Taste is just as great as it smells. All the flavors of wheat, pepper, clove, banana, and just a hint of citrus are all mixed together for an awesome, complex taste. Mouthfeel is creamy and refreshing. Drinkability is very high. Hefs are not even close to being my favorite beer style, but this is a very tasty beer, and the best example of the style by far. 534 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 16, 2011

S: Smells very spicy with a hint of hops and wheat. Smell might be a bit too spicy however for my nose.
T: Taste is great. Perfect balance with right amount of crisp wheat and hops and a little spice and yeast. Very refreshing.
M: Mild carbonation, feels almost as good as it tastes.
D: Perfect drinkability. One of the crispest and smoothest beers I have ever had, and one of the reasons this is a must have. 564 charactersgodfathermg57, Mar 15, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally I get to one of my favourite styles: the classic wheat beer oder weissbier im Deutsch. What better a wheat beer to review than from Weihenstephaner, the worlds oldest brewery still running.
Poured from a 500ml bottle into a 500ml Stein glass.
A: The brew fizzes a little as I pour it into the glass, the solid white head settles to 1cm. The body is a classic cloudy orange and without the head you would almost mistake it for a glass of mango juice.
S: This is where wheat beers really excel for me; the aroma is a fantastic bouquet of banana and clove spice. It has a hint of bubble gum and if I must be honest this aroma would make a fantastic cologne (take note Calvin Klein).
T: Creamy, slightly banana taste. Distinctive malt is the main character in this brew and if you like your hops too bad - they've left the building. There is a mustiness mixed in that could only in my mind be the yeast, it's slightly distracting but not a deal breaker. The cloves also add a tip of the tongue tingle and give the sweetness some added complexity.
M: Again 'creamy' is the word of the day with this fine beer. It's not stoutland creamy but it is nonetheless quite substantial. The carbonation is fantastically well suited to the style.
D: In a word 'extremely'... that is if you like your wheat beers. Some people can't abide by them and all I can say is "Your loss". To me this is probably my 3rd favourite style of beer and this particular brew is quite exceptional, although I think Schneider Aventinus is a better beer and will do up a review on that soon... hopefully.
Food match: German fare; big sausages while wearing even bigger leather pants. Fried potato with shredded ham (schinken), and sauerkraut... mmm. 1,728 charactersdoktorhops, Mar 15, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy pale-yellow color. Grows a huge, white colored head, a thick, rocky flat of cream that hangs on through the entire glass, layering the glass with rows of bubbles with each sip.
The aroma is, clean and grainy. A nice amount of yeasty esters, giving up some nice banana character, with a hint of underlying clove. The malt character is very nice and bread-like which when combined with the esters is really quite mouth-watering.
This beer tastes exactly like it smells, and feels rich and creamy. The yeast profile shows up first, giving a nice, light fruity character to the beer, with banana predominating. There is a mild clove flavor, mostly towards the finish. The beer has a nice grainy, bread-like flavor throughout complimenting the other flavors admirably.
Absolutely delicious. So creamy and smooth, with amazing flavors that drop off the palate quickly, though ultimately leaving a light banana bread flavor. Top in it's a class, and a worthy hefeweizen in which to judge all others hefes. 1,016 charactersSoneast, Mar 13, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Dark golden color; the head retention is very big and very white. Good head retention and lacing and very good carbonation.
S- This is the standard that all hefeweizens should be judged against. Notes of banana, wheat malt along with clove and citrus spring up from the glass. Banana is the overall smell but it's very pleasant.
T- Very outstanding taste profile. The beer is rich, refreshing, and very balanced. Just a great all around hefeweizen with great flavor notes of banana with an undertone of clove with a nice dry finish. Definitely deserving of the top 100.
M- Medium bodied beer. Had a nice balance between crisp and slightly creamy. Carbonation is perfect for this style.
D- Very high. I could easily drink six bottles of this especially on a nice warm day.
Overall- I love this beer overall. It's fairly solid in every aspect and THE classic example of a hefeweizen style. 895 charactersclarkm04, Mar 12, 2011

Wow. Popped the cap on this (with no agitation mind you) and a mushroom of foam forms around the mouth of the bottle (with no spillage). Pours effin BEAUTIFUL with a massive creamy head. Wheat and honey colored highlights and the head.. man the head.. whipped topping
Smells incredible, I spent a lot of time with my nose in this one. Mostly spice, crackers and minimal banana. Amazingly complex on the nose
Taste was everything I expected it to be judging from the reviews. Big wheaty, spicy brew. Mouthfeel is the star here. It feels absolutely smooth with no ethanol pinch at all

3.63/5  rDev -17.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hazy orange body with billowy white head. Very appropriate to style.
Smell is a spicy peppery clove smell up front with a hint of lemon zest hiding behind there. It smells thin like an old European beer always does to me. It's probably the US import weight though. It's almost perfumey.
The taste is very bready at first and then it follows behind the scent very similarly. It is mostly the spice that comes through on the taste with very little citrus to me. It definitely doesn't have the banana flavor I was expecting. 
Mouthfeel is good. Very lifting and spritzy.
Completely drinkable. Would be great at a barbecue or on the back porch. 644 characterstchenery, Mar 10, 2011
3.38/5  rDev -23.2%look: 3 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served on draught into a .3L beer-specific glass in Berlin. Reviewed from notes. 
A: Hazy blonde colour; lovely cream in a 1.5 finger head of very nice retention. 
Sm: Wheat, barley, but an absence of hops. Very fresh and fizzy. 
T: Wheat-ish open to wheat body with crystal hops with an off-cream finish. Well built for the style, but a but unbalanced in that it's biased towards mainly the body, to the detriment of the other two acts. Not an Aristotelian beer, if you will. (You won't). 
Mf: Lovely. It's ideally coarse for a Hefeweizen, and balances wetness and dryness quite well, though it's a bit too wet. 
Dr: For the price, it's certainly worth a purchase by Berlin standards. For fans of the style, it's a must-try. 730 characterskojevergas, Mar 10, 2011

Poured a murky yellow with a large rocky white head that was fully lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was loaded with a doughy yeast , bread malts, light citrus hops with notes of banana and cloves. It tasted mildly bitter-sweet to start and developed into a light, sweet yeasty flavor with notes of citrus, banana and some spices with the flavor lasting for quite a while, thus enhancing the experience. Mouthfeel was light in body and watery in texture with a soft carbonation.. Overall an outstanding Hefeweizen. 557 charactersKajII, Mar 09, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Dark golden color; the head is white (more than one would expect for a beer with such dark color), big and dense; it's been described as 'rocky' and that's quite accurate: a crater is left in its middle as I pour in my glass; good but not impressive retention and lacing; rich carbonation.
Smell: The epitome of hefeweizen; ripe banana, wheat malt, little hints of clove and citrus; do I smell peanuts?
Taste: I dare describe it as manly and sexy; it's uncomplicated (in a good way) and not delicate (in a good way), and almost robust; grilled bread, banana; hints of peanut butter; minimal hops. 
Mouthfeel: This is medium to full-bodied (for a hefeweizen); midway between 'crisp' and 'creamy'; just a bit dry; carbonation feels perfect;it's not a light bier, it truly fills one's mouth.
Drinkability: Finished it in less than I expected, and couldn't realize I'd drunk 500 mL of bier; this is seriously drinkable!
Best hefeweizen I've had so far. Combines two things I love in a beer: strength and drinkability. 1,030 charactersdesiderius, Mar 08, 2011

A: The beer is cloudy yellow in color and poured into a weizen glass with a two finger high bright white head. The head has good retention properties and consistently left a thin layer of bubbles covering the surface.
S: There are aromas of bananas and bubble gum in the nose along with some hints of clove.
T: The taste has flavors of citrus and wheat; some hints of clove are present in the finish.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied on the palate and has a high amount of carbonation.

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5After rating the Dunkel awhile back, I had been looking forward to this.
Appearance: Beautiful golden hue with a touch of tan, quite cloudy with plenty of bubbles. Easily produces more than three inches of thick creamy off-white head. Leaves little bits of lacing all down the glass.
Smell: Banana esters are very strong here. A lot of wheat and yeast aromas as well. I seem to detect citrus, like orange or grapefruit.
Taste: Welcome home after a hot day. This is pure pleasure. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. Plenty of wheat, with a tiny amount of sourness. A fair share of the banana and citrus, with some cloves. What hops flavors there are, are well-blended.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, this beer has a lingering pleasant sweetness. Not too much carbonation.
Drinkability: Oh, I could have these all day. I envision the first really warm sticky May day, sitting on a bar stool, having these on tap. That would be a fine day. 938 charactersdbaker61, Mar 05, 2011

A - Pours hazy, bright, orange with a nice creamy half finger tall head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.

T - Lots of chewy wheat up front, lingering thru the finish, mix well with the spicy clove and bright citrus fruits. Finish is pretty bready with most of it lingering long after consumption. Perfect beer for a warm day like today. Very nice stuff.
M - Medium-light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Chewy feel from all that wheat. Finish is a bit spicy with plenty of lingering chewiness.
D - Very good. I am not the biggest fan of hefe's but this one really does set the bar for all others. One of, if not the, best I have had. Glad I finally got to try it. 914 charactersorangesol, Mar 03, 2011

A - Slightly hazy pale golden color. Good amount of frothy white head. 
S - Light wheat aroma. Bread, nuts and banana odor also present.
T - Refreshing banana, wheat malt flavors. Tiny amount of sourness on the finish. Overall taste was pretty mild though.
M - Average carbonation. Medium bodied. Creamy and smooth, what I would want from the style.
D - Nothing offensive about this beer, but flavors were a little lacking for me. 456 charactersbbb099, Mar 03, 2011

Banana, lemongrass, nut, and spice waft into the nose. Banana, lemon, bread, and spice hit the palate with a fair bit of nut . Balanced. Light to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Way too drinkable. Excellent. Balanced, complex, and drinkable. I think I just found a new favorite hef! 416 charactersMrHurmateeowish, Mar 03, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12 fl oz bottle into a pint glass. Premium Bavaricum!
Appearance: Take a picture and this could be an advertisement for the global brewing industry! Fluffy white head and beautiful light golden body. Thick and cloudy.
Smell: Dry and tart. Smells great.
Taste: Fantastic banana flavor. Not too terribly sour in comparison with other wheat beers. The flavor is light and complex at the same time.
Mouthfeel: A beer for any occasion. This is very refreshing. A bit of a dry aftertaste.
Drinkability: Morning, noon or night - again, a beer for any occasion. Smooth and not a lot of alcohol.
Overall: Is this the benchmark for Hefeweizens? Not necessarily a beer for diehard hopheads nor the extreme brewing crowd, but I can see this pleasing just about everyone else! 783 charactersJednoPivoProsim, Mar 02, 2011
3.68/5  rDev -16.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance--Golden, deep wheat, partially cloudy, substantial cream-yeasty head. 
Smell--Light yeast. Overall absence of spice notes or interest.
Taste--Characteristic Weissbier style in the background, but you really have to concentrate. This beer is so subtle, it is verging on transparent.
Mouthfeel-- Light and unremarkable, excepting that it is smooth, refreshing and clean
Drinkability--I love Weissbier and maybe I am unsophisticated, but this is way too subtle for a top ranked beer. The best Weissbiers revel in their yeasty, clovey, spiciness. This beer is surely a quality brew. It is smooth and beautifully clean, but it has no real character. It is technically a good beer, but it is not one that will win your heart, or a place in my basement biercave. I had to really concentrate to get the full Weissbier experience and I don't like to work that hard to enjoy my beer ;o) 891 charactersSirAndyR, Mar 02, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This 500mL bottle was purchased at Pere Marquette Expeditions in Ludington, MI. According to the code on the label, this was bottled on 8/23/2010. The label has a lot of other good information as well: "World's Oldest Brewery", "Store and keep cool 46°-52° F," "Brewed under the purity law of 1516." The last one is news to me as I was not aware that the Reinheitsgebot allowed for the use of wheat in the brewing process.
I poured this into a weizen glass. A moderate pour gives off a massive five-finger head, making a roughly 1:1 ratio of head to beer. The head is fluffy and retention is excellent. It does eventually settle, but never recedes completely. A narrow trail of foamy lacing spans of the glass. Carbonation is visible. The beer is golden and cloudy. It looks like the perfect glass of beer that they pour in every beer commercial on television (with some added cloudiness per style).
The aroma is giving off scents of lemon and wheat. Mild tropical fruit and heavy yeastiness next reach the nose. Light phenols waft into the nose with just the slightest noticeable hint of alcohol. Aromatics are strong and this beer's fragrance is easily detected from the other side of the table.
As this is the prototypical hefeweizen, all of the standard traits of the style are present in the flavor. There's the banana ester. There's a nice crisp wheat bite. There's a dry finish, and a yeasty aftertaste. It is a well balanced and very deliciously full flavored beer.
The beer is medium bodied and much heavier than commercial American takes on the style. Carbonation is on the lighter end for a hefeweizen but I find it to be perfect. The carbonation agitates the flavors nicely making the beer satisfyingly lively in the mouth.
Beer doesn't get much more drinkable than this. It's full flavored and well balanced with no off-putting bitterness. It has a wonderful weight in the mouth. The alcohol content is a moderately low 5.4% ABV; and for an import with such high esteem, this is very reasonably priced. I would gladly tip back another if only there was another to be had. I just wish that I could get them fresher.

The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation)
Schlitz may have been the beer that made Milwaukee famous, but Weihenstephaner is older than Milwaukee itself. I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for this excellent hefeweizen. 2,379 charactersweizenbob, Mar 01, 2011

A - Really cloudy pale cantaloupe flesh-colored liquid with a creamy white dollop of foam on top that dispersed into a swirly patch, leaving behind some spots and strings of lace. 
S - Classic Hefe aroma with equal parts clove spice and bready malt with a hint of banana and spicy yeast. There is also a pleasant citrus character suggesting lemon zest and orange peel.
T - Opens with a bready malt character paired with clove notes and a more subtle banana presence. There is also a lemony citrus character in the middle, accompanied by toasted wheat grains, which is quite pleasant. Finishes with a hint of peppery spice in the backend, more clove and yeasty notes and a hint of citrus.
M - Medium bodied with pretty lively effervescence and a slightly chewy texture. Finish is subtly spicy with a bit of residual sweetness on the palate.
D - This is a Top 100 beer for a reason and perhaps the benchmark for the style. You don't stay in business for hundreds of years making sub-par beers. I don't usually find myself in the mood for Hefeweizens too often, but this one always delivers the goods. 1,141 charactersffejherb, Mar 01, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Superb looking brew. Opaque yellow color with creme white head with a lot of volume, great retention and good lacing. Creamy carbonation.
S: Sharp acidic notes of lemon juice. Really easy to find wheat malt in this. Some light vanilla. Spicy notes of: Pepper, cinnamon, cardamom and maybe saffron. Mango and pineapple are also very present in the smell. Inviting.
T: Again, wheat malt is very present in this. There is some lemon in this. There are the usual wheat beers tastes of banana. Some vanilla like in the smell. Again there are spices: cinnamon, cardamom, pepper and saffron (yeah it's there for sure). Mango and pineapple are still there but not as much as in the smell. Very light herbal and earthy hops, but really not much. Perfectly balanced brew but sadly, no WOW factor I'd need for a perfect 5.
M: Silky smooth and very creamy. Good medium carbonation with sharp bubbles, keeping it alive. One of the most unique and amazing mouthfeel I ever had. 
D: Amazingly high. Every thing is so well balanced, it tastes so good, so refreshing, I can drink this all night. About the most drinkable beer I had. 1,122 charactersflipper2gv, Feb 28, 2011

Plenty of smooth wheat aromas as well as lemon peel hit the nose. Fresh and semi-sweet with a honey note.
Flavor follows the nose with a sturdy yet smooth wheat backbone. Mild citrus hop with a lemon and tangerine tone. Mid-drink reveals a gentle honey sweetness that balances the experience. 
Medium bodied and perfect amount of carbonation. Very smooth in texture thanks to the wheat. Finishes crisp with a lemon bite.
Very easy drinking and highly refreshing. Would make a great summer session beer. A well crafted hefeweissen. 663 charactersbnes09, Feb 26, 2011
3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Although German beers aren't always my favorite I still like to have one every once and awhile. They're almost always light and refreshing thanks to the Reinheitsgebot! It was another dinner with pizza and another time to have something light to go along with it that would balance away the spice in the pizza but not be too heavy. 
The hefeweissbier poured a thick and very bubbly white head that gave promise to having a good beer session. It's color was a cloudy yellow that was a little more of an amber color in the middle but around the edges was more yellow in color. 
The smell was very yeasty with a hint of citrus. 
The taste was less full-bodied than I thought it would be but it was very refreshing and light. The yeast could be tasted throughout with lemon-citrus being less prominent. Banana and clove flavors also made themselves known but were slight in strength. 
This is a very good hefeweissen auf Deutschland! 933 charactersBeardedRiker, Feb 25, 2011

Mouthfeel: Somewhat thick and velvety smooth, crisp carbonation.
Drinkability: Easy session beer. Really wish they had it in six packs instead of 500ml bottles when I bought it, because I could really go for another one.
Overall: It is clear why this is a top 100 beer, and the top of its category. Wish it was easier to find, but at least I know I can get it. 591 charactersMadCat, Feb 25, 2011

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: Hazy medium golden color with an extraordinarily large white cloudtop head, moderate and natural appearing carbonation, lots of stickly lace. The head exhibits extraordinary retention. 
Aroma: Consists of the prototypical cloves and ripe bananas that define this style. 
Taste: Begins with lots of soft carbonation and a quite full bread malt flavor and lots of yeast, towards the middle of the taste the clove and ripe banana flavors assert themselves. At the end of the taste some mild hops appear along with some residual malt flavor. The finish is clean and a bit dry.
Mouth feel: The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.
Drinkability/notes: While I do not particularly care for the Hefeweizen style, it must be conceded that this is a superb beer and a must try for anyone who is a serious student of world=class beer. 834 charactersshanetemple, Feb 24, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got around to picking up a bottle of this for review. I've had it several times, but never had the opportunity to sit and review. The good news is that I already know this is a beer I enjoy.
After the pour a hearty head that looks like whipped egg whites sits atop the brew. Excellent retention. Slightly hazy pale gold color. Not light enough to be called straw, but a very pale gold. Some active carbonation rises to the surface. Not much in the way of lacing. 
Aroma is classic and fantastic Banana pudding, slight spice and light grain. Clean, fresh and wonderful.
What I enjoy about this particular WeissBier is that the banana/spice flavor is so creamy. All the flavors are soft and rounded and really compliment each other. Each of the components work together very well. The yeast flavors are great and the spice hides just behind the banana to provide complexity. The creaminess makes me think of vanilla as well. I always think of a great banana pudding with the Nilla wafers. And believe me, that's a compliment in my book.
Creamy, refreshing and alive.. The mouth feel is spot on.
The drinkability is directly linked the great mouth feel and flavor. You can work through this very quickly and you need to remind yourself to enjoy. 1,255 charactersReagan1984, Feb 23, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 516oz bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass. This beer pours a burnt orange with golden hues. The head begins to grow as soon as the beer enters the glass and continues the entire pour - a magnificent, bone white, soapy head that lasts an impressive amount of time before finally dissipating. Left behind is a thin snowy cap and soapy lacing strewn about the sides of the glass. 
The nose is perfection. Orange and lemon zest, lemon grass, banana, clove and honey dominate. Sweetness meets a delicate spice to make pure magic happen. 
The taste is right on par with the nose with the addition of a wonderful breadiness. Very lightly hoppy flavors intermingle with the sweet wheat and zesty citrus, banana and clove. It is absolutely wonderful. 
Mouthfeel is light to medium and nicely carbonated. Crisp, clean and slightly dry, this would be an amazing addition to a hot summer day. 896 charactersmjn5036, Feb 23, 2011

S - Sweet malty wheat, a bit of lemon and a little spice
T - A bit of clove and spice, touch of lemon and a nice balance of hops. I love the balance in fact. Less sweet than a lot of hefe's I have tried. 
M - Pleasantly carbonated but not overbearing, excellent on the palate. Nice dry crisp finish.

It was a challenge to pour the whole bottle without the head overflowing the glass. Wonderful scent of wheat and lemon, perhaps some clove. The taste isn't very complex - just a very good blend of clove, banana, and lemon all the way through. Almost a bubble gum-type sweetness. Mouthfeel is exceptional - full bodied and perfect carbonation. Very refreshing and drinkable. One of my favorites, and the gold standard of its style. 587 charactersDeltaGolfSierra, Feb 22, 2011

S - Ahh, a wonderful and sweet wheat and yeast aroma with some lemon.
T - Toasted wheat bread, fruity yeast, clove, lemon and a trace of hop bitterness. 
M - Medium body and effervescent carbonation. Hits the right balance between smooth and crisp, making it oh-so refreshing on a hot summer day.
D - Very high drinkability. This is almost my favorite wheat beer. I like the Weihenstephaner Dunkle better than any other wheat beer but not surprisingly, this is near the top. 629 charactersTucquan, Feb 21, 2011

D- 4.5 This brew was very easy to drink. Great balance of flavors and I could enjoy several of these bottles at a time. Love the creaminess-but-not-heavy aspect of this brew. My favorite hefeweizen to date! 631 charactersKYBrewgrass, Feb 21, 2011

Appearance - Dull yellow murky from the wheat. Head is extrordinary! 3+ finger head into my pint glass and couldn't even finish pouring the full 12 oz bottle even tipped on side of glass the whole time. 
Smell - like others mentioned, very bannana like
Taste - Now this is a great tasting Hefeweizen and I'm not big fan of murky wheat beers! Excellent mild flavorings and very authentic German.
Mouthfeel - Creamy head on the lip. Nice smooth finish.
Drinkability - Seems very drinkable. The bannana smell and slight taste possibly could get old to the pallet with repeat samplings in 1 sitting. 742 charactersbubseymour, Feb 19, 2011
4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Weihenstephaner Hefe has a beautiful hazy golden color that is topped off by a bone white head. It readily climbs out over the rim of the glass, much like a souffle, and retains much of its volume throughout the experience. It also has delightful lacing, with torrents of pin-head bubbles racing to the head.
S: A touch softer than what I was hoping for, but piquant nonetheless, the nose is marked by a gentle balance between clove and banana.
T: Deliciously dry, slightly acidic, and thoroughly enjoyable. The clove/banana marked in the nose make a strong appearance alongside mango and pineapple.
M: Full body, but lightened by the extremely effervescent nature of the brew. Spot on for the style.
D: One of the best examples of one of my favorite styles. This is the epitome of what a hefe should be. The greatest part: you can find this beer just about anywhere. If you've never had a hefe before, this should definitely be your first. 947 charactersAvagadro, Feb 19, 2011

Taste - Delicious. Clean....crisp...perfect. Mild sweetness along with bananas notes. With some huskiness from the grain...perfect balance.
Mouthfeel - This is fantastic. Smooth...creamy...almost chewy. Liquid bread.

This beer pours with a huge bone white head. He body itself is a nice straw yellow. The head stick around for a whole and e beer has some brilliance, but there's just something holding this back from greatness in the look. Maybe the head isn't tight enough?
The nose is mostly ripe banana. There's some spice here, too. I'm also picking up some grassy noble hops. This could do without that grassiness.
The taste is a smooth, somewhat subtle banana. There's a tinge of spice behind it, too. The's a lingering wheat / straw flavor in the background, too. Decent, but not overwhelming. The carbonation is nice and it's really easy to quaff.
This is a good hefe, but give me a Live Oak any day over this. Top 20 beer in the world? Not in my book. 805 charactersUTCengOwl, Feb 17, 2011

The smell is extraordinary with all the wheat flavours going on. Its taste is hard to put in words, since it is so, so great. But the fruity flavours are well balanced.

Great taste of spicy bananna bread as i like to describe it, with citrus notes. paired with the bananna bread it resembles will make for a great snack.
Medium bodied, and nicely carbonated, the flavors blend/mesh delightfully into a creamy sip that seducingly convices you to take another.

A: It pours a cloudy golden straw color with a slow-receding head. It has a great color for a Weiss beer.
S: The aroma is amazing. It has traces of banana, clove honey, and has a nice sweetness to the aroma.
T: Now my favorite part, the taste. I first tasted clove, then slowly different flavors roll over your palate; honey, banana, and a slight lemon zest. It has a great flavor and is not too sweet or too bitter, a nice balance. I like this a little more than Ayinger's Brau Weisse, even though that is a superb Unfiltered-Wheat Beer.
Ml: The texture is outstanding, it is exceptionally smooth with no bitter aftertaste. It just rolls over your tongue with no harsh bite.
D: I could drink this every day and never get bored. Definitely a five. It is just such a great beer you don't get tired of drinking it. I highly recommend it. 961 charactersSacredBeverage, Feb 15, 2011

There was a distinct spiciness to the aroma ... black pepper, clove, yeast and grain, along with a lingering sweetness.
The taste was out of sight. Chewey wheat, clove, and banana goodness with a slight grassiness and lemon-zest flavor to it. It was very light bodied, very well carbonated and very refreshing. 549 characterssurlytheduff, Feb 12, 2011

S- Much like Erdinger, plain, however with a bit more of a kick this time, maybe some spice.
T- A great taste for a Weissbier, the plain wheaty taste is made more interesting with a tangy/sourness as well. Also some spice I cant put my finger on.

D: World class! It is as easy to drink as water, but the flavours are so intense and varied that it never becomes tiresome. 
Overall: I have to be honest, I'm not crazy about heffes, but this one is forcing me to reconsider. It has that great balance and complexity that is hard to find in medium strength beers.

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ah, this one is a permanent resident of my home with the occasional rotation of Live Oak hefe from the local Draught House--an equally excellent, but very different drink.
Poured moderately from a bottle, two-fingers of snow will be produced. It would last forever, but the head itself tastes better than most hefes. The color depends on the surrounding lighting and varies from straw to a reddish-brown but is always cloudy-translucent--a picture-perfect hefe in any light.
The smell is perfectly consistent with the taste and the epitome of the style: cloves first, banana malt finish, some mild earthy tones and almost no detection of alcohol (most hefes are only 5-6ABV, so this is commonly concealed). Ginger is in the house.
Head is with you 'til after the beer is gone and IMO easily makes up for the lack of linger/aftertaste, which you shouldn't really expect from a hefe anyway.
Obviously, I am smitten with this one and would recommend it to anyone amateur to connoisseur. First tried this on tap in Regensburg 10 years ago (vie-hen stofner, they say) and have been hooked ever since. 1,099 charactersMichialTanner1, Feb 12, 2011

S - Black pepper spicy yeasty aroma, lemon zest, pale malts.

4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had this beer last night upon anticipation of going to the Weihenstephaner brewery in Munich next month. 
The beer poured a golden color and was a bit hazy with about an inch of white foamy head.
The aroma was sweet of fruit, cloves, and possibly honey. Medium-bodied full of sweet flavor. A bit of a spicy taste to it as well. More interesting than I expected from this beer rom what I remembered of Bavarian beers of this style.
Looking forward to trying more from Weihenstephaner. 488 charactersChincino, Feb 03, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cloudy/hazy golden orange in color. Has a thick foamy, fluffy white head. Minimal lacing. Lots of wheat, clove, banana coming through, trademarks for this style. There is a sweet honey smell in the middle with some floral notes, (mainly honeysuckle.. goes without saying I guess) that seem to stick around towards the finish, also ending with a spicy clove bite. Very complex smell. Lots of things moving around mixing together creating interesting aromas. Taste is spicy and herbal. Cloves and lemon are upfront with some chamomile undertones. The finish is mainly honey sweet but still has a bitterness to balance it out. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy and has a bubbly finish. No complaints. Doesn't get any more drinkable. 9.99 a six pack? A great value considering the other crap beers that are priced far higher. 816 charactersdepechemode1983, Feb 03, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a tulip. Drinking from the world's oldest brewery tonight.
Appearance: This is an aggressively carbonated beer. A massive white, tightly carbonated and creamy head floats on top of an inviting hazy golden tangerine beer. Great retention, and a sheet of lace slides down the glass.
Smell: This is quite the balanced aroma for a Hefeweizen. Banana, clove, wheat, some white grape and green apple skin. It is very aromatic, with a flowerlike quality to it, although I get no specific floral aroma.
Taste: The start of the sip is bananas drizzled with honey. A dash of cloves, and some white grapes and tart green apple skin add some tartness and start it out. A touch of spicy hops is the finishing touch. The finish is dry and a touch bitter but otherwise cleans up well. 
Mouthfeel: Extremely bubbly, this is very intensely carbonated. The beer doesn't wander around my tongue, it dances. This gives it quite a light mouthfeel. It is light bodied and although the front has some quite dry as well.
Drinkability: This is the epitome of a Hefe, light and drinkable. Crisp and elegant, this is a great beer to relax with. 1,156 charactersKickInTheChalice, Feb 02, 2011

Smells of lemons, wheat, cloves and malt. 
Taste is incredible. Wheat, lemon peal's and cloves are what I taste at first. Leaves a nice malty and earthy taste with a touch of spice. Very well balanced.
Mouthfeel is very light and well carbonated. Goes down easy and is an exceptional beer. 
Overall, probably the most well balanced hefeweissbier i've yet to have. 551 charactersStockfan42, Feb 01, 2011

S: Citrus, hay, yeasty spice, and heavy breadiness.
T: Lemon, biscuit, peppery yeast, some caramel, and some grassy funk.
M: It has a medium-light body with continuously heavy carbonation and some creaminess in the finish.

Poured into the Weihenstephan weizen glass which is shaped like Das Boot!. Slightly hazy yellow golden color with an extremely fizzy and fluffy white cap. Bubbles slowly drifting upward toward the surface.
Smell is mostly of sweet wheat malts. A touch of spice and yeast. Simple.
Taste just overwhelms the tastebuds. Starts out with the crisp wheat malts, Then the quick touching down of lemon zest which is there only breifly to make way for the earthy - medicinal middle.Finishes with a slight bitter hoppy bite that blends perfectley with clove to skreetch this ride to a hault.
Mouth is smooth and somewhat watery but not week.Light bodied,perfect carbonation ,leaves slight slickess butteriness on the tongue.
I am not a huge fan of Hefeweizen's but this I'll make an exception. Fantastic beer. 906 charactersTheFightfan1, Jan 30, 2011

S - Gorgeous fresh smell - definite banana and orange.
T - Not as sweet as the smell indicates. Spicey, taste almost like a Merlot. The alcohol is somewhat more present than in say, a Blue Moon. Aftertaste is also like that of a Merlot.
M - Less creamy than I expected. That actually works very well. Noticeably acidic.
D - Drinkability is where this beer really shines. This is perhaps the most drinkable beer I've had. It has enough complexity to keep me from getting bored, but not too much to where I feel overpowered. I could drink this all night. 635 charactersZenAgnostic, Jan 29, 2011

-starts a bit like a saison with that barnyard like flavor. there is some slight sweetness in there that mellows to a mellow bitterness at the end which i enjoy. most of the smell characteristics are in there as well

A- A beautiful golden yellow with a multiple finger head that lasted the entire beer. Was easily one of the more beautiful beers I have enjoyed.
S- As mentioned it does have a very nice hint of banana and wheats.
T- A very nice critus taste of some orange, but mostly banana. As well as a nice spice that hits the tongue as it goes down. Very delicious. 
M- Smooth, crisp, and refreshing. 
D- Drinkability is off the scale. And is my favorite hefe, and could make a great session beer.

S - Smells of banana, bread, and cloves. Very nice!
T - Very strong taste of banana initially. Gives way to a wheat flavor similar to fresh semolina bread. Finishes up with cloves and spice. This is one of the most complex, yet distcit hefes I can recall.
M - Mild and a little raspy finish.
D - Awesome drinker. I would never drink another hefeweizen if this was available all the time.
Not sure how much better than other hefeweizens this really is, but it is clearly as good as any. Very impressive. 589 characterssocon67, Jan 23, 2011

The beer pours a vibrant yellow-gold coloring, with a tremendous amount of foamy, cloudy white head. The head disperses fairly quick while the beer settles. Wonderful blend of smells, including citrus, malt, and wheat. Other sweet and earthy fruit notes deep in the aroma, as well. The beer has a well balanced malt and citrus-sweet flavor, too. Buttery notes of taste help round out the beer. It is very smooth, and almost creamy feeling in mouth. The beer transitions seemlessly to a creamy finish, with a slight roasted aftertaste. Very easy to drink, and I think will go great with the spicy fare we are planning to eat. 805 charactersGarthDanielson, Jan 23, 2011

Beautiful orange -yellow, cloudy,small 3/8 inch head, very bubbly, nice lacing, stays on glass about an inch and a half.
Smell is distinct. Banana, bready/ yeasty aromas, cloves all come thru.
Taste is exceptional with all the above smells transformed into flavors as well, complex.
Very nice mouthfeel, no alcohol comes thru at all, nice fizz on tongue, leaves a lingering taste on the palate.
Drink this year round, this is not just a "summer" beer. Have not found any beer in this style that comes close to completeness in every catagory. 589 charactersweisbierjeff, Jan 22, 2011

A -4.5 - Beer is a deep, deep golden or orange color, rather than a true brown. It is cloudy but not opaque. The head is not very thick, but is made up of tiny, creamy, off-white bubbles and it persists until the end. The lacing is thick on the glass. 
S - 4.0 - Classic banana and clove aromas mixed with warm, toasted malt and alcohol. 
T - 4.0 - Lots of banana in the initial taste, followed by bubblegum and wheat grain. There are some dark fruits in the background, but no roasted notes. Very clean and tasty but with complex flavor development. 
M - 4.0 - Medium body, creamy and slightly fizzy carbonation. No alcohol burn. Finishes sweet but not cloying. 
D - Very drinkable, despite its big, complex flavors. From the taste, I expected the alcohol to be higher because it has the complexity of a much bigger beer. 884 charactersRadome, Jan 22, 2011

4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5This brewery's product is so excellently priced that it's hard not to love them. I've had a few of their beers and they are always good and super well-priced. This is a 500ml bottle of 5.4% Hefe Weissbier for $2.99, how can you top that!!??
This is supposed to be the flagship, so let's see what's up...
Pours a slightly hazy straw colored amber. It's certainly not the lemonade color of American versions. A beautiful, creamy two to three finger head flares up and persists at about a half finger. Awesome...Medium carbonation. Slight lacing. Aromas are not what one might expect - way more yeasty than the American versions. A touch of sweetness amidst the yeast components. I get some other items in the aroma profile too: A tiny hint of cinnamon, Some caramel notes, and maybe even something like sarsparilla..Very cool. Flavor is super crisp, super vibrant. Carbonation kinda billows up in your mouth, and as you saw last night, that's not my favorite thing. A lot of yeast aspect to the flavor profile. A nice, clean wheat malt flashes in front of your tongue, tantalizing it with expectation. This dashes away and is quickly replaced by the complex and wonderful yeats aspects. I get a lot of biscuit with butter and bready notes in here. Like the stuff that comes with a bowl of soup - thick and hearty, not white bread. The late middle flashes apart into what I consider a slightly too thin finish. Too clean and watery for my tastes. No real hop component in here at all. Just a burst in the late middle of the drink, then gone. The bready, yeasty notes persist in the finish and that's about it. This is a completely different monster fromn the standard, bastardized American Hefeweizen, which is like drinking lemonade. This is actual beer that has complexity and nuance, and is super highly drinkable. Perfect even in winter with a nice white bean soup and some thick bread. Delicious and classic for the style. My only harp on this is the thin finish, otherwise find and drink folks. I would say you need to stock your fridge full of this brewery's products if you can - at least one of them will please any beer drinker.
What I like most: The wonderful, bready yeasty flavor profile.
What I like least: The thin, albeit nuanced, finish.
Verdict: So good and well priced it's almost criminal. Must have in your fridge at pretty much all times. 2,362 charactersSolomonGrundy, Jan 21, 2011

Wonderful yeastiness, bubblegum fragrance out shines the banana, a whisper of clove. 
Glowingly balanced taste with well-placed flavor... more banana is found on the palate, slight bubblegum, almost no clove but solid wheaty-maltiness. Faint mustiness. 
Pleasing mouthfeel, this is a very enjoyable quaff. Slightly sweet yet mildly tart finish. 
Probably the best Hefe-Weizen on the planet. World Class... very much recommended... why just drink this in the summer? 570 characterstobin, Jan 17, 2011

bottle to weizen
App- A tri-colored yellow burst of color in the glass. Had a very nice pillowy 2 finger head sitting there.
Smell- Light yeast with a wheat earthy smell. A little bit of spice wofts up as well.
Taste- A classic. It has a laid back dominance of the flavors in the glass. Its flavorful and well balanced on the palate.
Mouth- A very nice, crisp, clean and refreshing beer to start off a night.
Drink- If you haven't had one, I suggest you do to find the best rep of a style. 513 charactersFosterJM, Jan 17, 2011

Left the Vitus for all the fanboys. I don't like it. :P
Hef glass. Waited a sec because it was mighty cold. A hazy pale orange/gold beer. Stiff Cool-Whip head. It's as thick as shaving lather in some instances. Swiss cheese lace.
Smell is unexplainably savory, but still bright like a Hefeweizen should be. Like warm pasta tossed with a little fresh butter & a little herbage. Terrible anology(& maybe I'm just hungry), but that's what I'm imagining. Light on the banana(though it's creamier then usual) & barely showing any anise/clove.
Taste is pungent banana esters with a twinge of orange. Sweet biscuity middle with a bitterness that is more green then clove. Finish turns to face dry, but doesn't quite get all the way there.
Good carbonation, if a little ethereal. Body feels heavier then I'd like.
I can't say that this is my favorite hef ever, but I've always come back to it. While imports aren't usually at their freshest, I've still had some really nice ones from Plank, Ayinger, Franz, & Schneider, which I feel are all superior to this one. At least on this side of the Atlantic. :P 1,284 charactersPEBKAC, Jan 16, 2011

Pours a cloudy golden color, maybe yellowish orange, with a huge foamy white head, 2-3 fingers, with nice retention. Thick, foamy lacing stick to the glass and slowly slips down the glass to meet the head.
Smells fruity with banana and lemon qualities. Also getting some yeast and cloves.
Taste in fruity, again with more pronounced banana and some lemon and wheat flavors. Cloves and some spiciness are present as well. 
Highly carbonated, almost fizzy, with a light body. Smooth at the back of the throat while going down and prickly on the tongue at the same time. 
Drinkability is very, very high here. Light body and lively carbonation lead to a pleasant mouthfeel and a lower abv with complex flavors. Definitely possible to have more than a few pints in a sitting. 818 charactersms11781, Jan 16, 2011

Flavors are of banana, clove, faint citrus and some other spice. Banana taste is very tasty and the clove is not overdone. 
Palate is rushed with awesome texture of smooth flow along with perfect carbonation, resulting in a beautifully balanced and bodied beer. 363 charactersveinless, Jan 15, 2011

A pretty lighter orange hue that is quite hazy and a nice small head with great retention and lacing. Looks right to me.
Smells great with a fruity tinged german weiss character, cloves, lemon zest, some raisin/prune buried in there, and more. Pretty nice fragrant aroma.
Taste follows the smell, bread and wheat qualities abound but are back up and surrounded by lemon, raisin, clove, maybe even some licorice notes. Interesting and tasty.
Mouth is of good full carbonation and a creamy feel overall. A very drinkable beer, the style and ABV make it that way. Not my favorite style by any means but man this a great beer and I try to rate within style as much as i can. 772 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 15, 2011

Numerous 1L glasses poured on tap at my local German beer garden as well as from the 12oz bottles poured in a tall glass, steins, or das boot. This is my all time favorite hefe beer. Pours a mildly hazy golden yellow with 3 finger white head. Smells mellow sweet fruits, banana, and cloves. Taste of mellow citrus and orchard fruits, wheat, yeast, banana, cloves, and a bit of bitter hops. Medium body and carbonation with some alcohol warmth and nice dry finish. yeasts and fruit hang around a bit. Excellent brew, beautifully balanced. Alcohol well hidden but lends a nice warmth. 592 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 14, 2011

The aroma has a hint of banana and fruity yeast.
The flavor is typical of wheat beers, somewhat thin for my palate, with a light, grassy presence up front and a bit of hops at the back end. Much carbonation in between, with a decent grain bill.
For those who enjoy wheat beers, this is a good one, but it is not my favorite style. 473 characterstubacharlie, Jan 12, 2011

Smell- Yeast, banana, clove
Taste- Very sweet. Banana, clove, and wheat dominate the palate along with stong spicy yeast characteristics. Some bubblegum and lemon as well, a very slight breadyness.
Mouthfeel- Medium body, fairly high carbonation. 
Overall- I actually find this to be almost cloyingly sweet. I understand the respect for the brewery and this beer, but for whatever reason I don't find this to be one of the best beers in the world.

Big, billowing creamy head is very nice, as is the hazy straw-orange color and lively carbonation of this beer.
Aroma is fantastic, with lots of banana, warm spices and lively yeast phenols. 
Flavor was not as bright as the aroma, but nevertheless good. Very bready and yeasty, with notes of spicy clove and sweet banana. On the sweeter side for a Hefe, but still delicious. Mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth, but also somewhat watery. Lively, effervescent carbonation. Eminently drinkable. 
This US-imported, bottled version lacks character. Fresh and on-tap in Germany, the Weihenstephaner has much better flavor, and would achieve a near perfect, "world-class" score. But over here...just "excellent".
*EDIT, January 2011, Germany:
From a fresh bottle and into a proper wheat beer glass here in Germany, the Weihenstephaner Hefe tastes superior to the bottle I had in the states. Mouthfeel is amazingly creamy with perfect carbonation, so I'm upping it to a five. Drinkability is fantastic as well: five. I'm getting a case of this stuff! Prost! 1,149 charactersdasenebler, Jan 11, 2011

Appearance: Pours a hazy pale golden yellow with a lot bubble action going on up to the 3 finger fluffy white head.
Smell: Banana, clove, spices, wheat and yeast. 
Taste: The traditional hefeweizen taste, which I'm sure these guys invented and perfected! Banana, wheat, yeast, clove and spices. Wow!
Mouthfeel: Light bodied and carbonated very nicely.
Drinkability: This beer deserves any and all praise it receives. Very enjoyable and flavorful beer at a lower abv that the rest of the top 20 beers. Definitely will be drinking again! 668 charactersAxic10, Jan 09, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier on tap at Perdition in Hell's Kitchen, New York.
Appearance: Served in a Weihenstephaner tall glass (easily 1/2 liter). Comes with a very white frothy head, a big one! Two fingers, recedes into one. Supeb lacing. Very hazy golden color. 
Smell: Very rich aromas, of grass and hay, wheat all over, like the fields Vincent painted in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence while rapidly and unstoppably descending into sheer madness. Also some orange and various citrus aromas, including pineapple. Biscuit, bread and banana. Spices. 
Taste: Very yeasty, like being at a bakery. Sweet notes. Touches of lemon and orange. Stinging hops. Pleasant, but not as exciting as the incredible nose. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is low, body is medium, flavor is full. Refreshing and a tad watery (thin) but also delightfully bitter, with a nice hoppy touch at the end and a dry finish.
Drinkability: Not as high as I would expect in a beer with low ABV. It got me buzzed when I was only halfway through the pour (admittedly, it is a huge serving). A bit too much beer overall, I would not session or have several in one sitting, but super delicious nonetheless. 
I mean, I usually favor big beers, but this one is stunning. 1,228 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jan 09, 2011
4.31/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4#50. The big 5-0, and not much else worthy of fitting that number than an award winning recipe older than the hills. I've never had the beer before but I'm willing to see what a masterpiece in Hefeweizen territory tastes like.
Poured from a 1 pt, .9oz bottle to my special mug at room temp.
(Appearance) Goodness, a volatile brew! A modest pour yields an enormous level of fizzy foamy head that retains incredibly well, leaving behind gobs of foamy head. That in addition to thick sticky lacing makes an impressive appearance. I still have a lot of this bottle to pour in and not enough room to do it with! Color of the beer is a smoggy murky gold tinged yellow. Carbonation is medium and bunched together in groups. The overwhelming amount of head is quite impressive. The appearance is simply great. 5
(Smell) First thing's first: I could smell this beer from several feet away which means it's quite pungent in terms of smell. An arrangement of some lightly roasted malty aroma and a bitter waft of grassy smell overlaps it all. Some big light grain, wheat and overwhelmingly grassy whiffs might be the biggest upset about the smell, but are far more subtle than in most macro brews, where a grassy odor is common. Fruits are also easy to draw out of here, amongst them, orange and definitely banana. Little in the smell keeps me from wanting to drink this beer. It smells good, but this is where any improvements can best be made. 4
(Taste) Some good tastes of light grainy malt and some complementary light fruit tastes; banana mostly, but also some orange bite, pear, and grape. Sweet honey rounds out the entire taste and a very fair level of non-intrusive herbal spices balance the finish. Yeasty bread-like smells are faint and complement the whole taste. Amongst I can pull out coriander and clove the most, comes through mostly on the finish, not so much as in what this reminds me of (Hoegaarden White), but enough so that it stands out. In the end, this is an exceptional brew. Sweet, light and subtle, yet defining taste. 4.5
(Mouthfeel) Beyond the foamy cap, a good balance of crisp and smooth in this drink. The herbal spice alludes to the crispness but the malty flavors round out the drink's smooth edge. The relatively average ABV is well hidden in this brew. A sweet finish with a herbal spice that brushes the tongue; it's like Hoegaarden, but with a more subtle finish and balance. It tastes fresh and at least as enjoyable. Great mouthfeel. 4.5
(Drinkability) One bomber to myself is what I need of this beer. The flavor is right on; this is a filling and enjoyable Hefeweizen and really worth any trip to the package store. If you're really in the mood, a shared bomber could easily make for one, but this beer is certainly worth every penny; at a $4 bottle, I felt it was a great buy. I might even get another on my next trip. 4
Verdict: If time is all it takes to perfect a beer style, then I'm going to have to dedicate an eternity to this hobby. Amongst my favorite beers and highly recommended to anybody willing to fork over $4 for something amazing. A (4.45) 3,096 charactersJadjunk, Jan 09, 2011

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5500ml Bottle
Appearance - The beer pours a murky amber/yellow colour with a massive frothy white coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the murkiness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for a very long time before it began to dissipate.
Smell - banana/bubblegum, wheat, cloves
Taste & Mouth - The beer has quite a bit of carbonation and feels very light and creamy on the tongue. Most of the taste is made up of wheat, bananas, and cloves. There are also notes of a pear juice sweetness. It finishes with an all spice and banana aftertaste.
Drink - Thanks to brews like this, I am quickly becoming a big fan of wheat beers. This is a fantastic beer that I will be sure to buy again. 751 charactersspinrsx, Jan 06, 2011

A - golden orange/yellow with an absolute tornado of bubbles, they are everywhere and keep the huge 3 1/2 finger head going. Excellent lacing, excellent look.
S - fresh baked banana bread, very sweet notes of caramel, peaches, and malts.
T - cloves, banana, Belgian yeast, barley, wheatlike bread, surprisingly noticeable hop twang on the backend that I wasn't expecting from a hefe. As it warms, cloves and banana more pronounced. Alcohol presence is slightly noticeable.
M - I was expecting a huge fizzle of carbonation on my first sip but I was greeted with a lesser, more creamy level. Pretty light but very crisp mouthfeel, very nice!
D - this beer borders on almost perfect, it is extremely drinkable no matter what the year, sessionable, and most of all reliable. Must buy - they've been around almost 1,000 years! You know they are doing something right! 895 charactersdfclav, Jan 03, 2011

Poured into my Duvel tulip, has a cloudy, golden straw colored body. Huge head on all of my pours, even though I was being very careful given the style. All kinds of stuff going on in the nose - clove, pepper, banana, and citrus notes are the most distinctive. Some spice and banana flavors upfront in the taste, with a sweetness coming through in the middle, rounded out by some citrus notes. Lighter body with a moderate amount of carbonation, very smooth and refreshing.
Pretty complex, yet balanced all around. Nice to grab a growler of this world class beer. 601 charactersprdstmnky, Jan 03, 2011

S: Intoxicating. A sharp smell of bananas with mild complementary spices
T: First, the crisp nature is noticed. Next, there is a prevalence of differing mild spices and flavors take over. A bit of sweetness, a bit of bitterness. Finishes with a slight dryness that leaves you wanting a fresh sip.
M: Smooth feel on the whole, with notable carbonation.
D: Very drinkable beer. A lighter beer with plenty of flavor that you can enjoy all night long. Heavy enough to keep your taste buds very happy, light enough not to overwhelm you. 644 charactersmdunman, Jan 03, 2011
4.06/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into an extra-tall pilsner glass. 
This beer looks amazing. It poured with about a hand's worth of white, fluffy, pillowy head. The head laces very well, leaving little clouds down the side of the glass. The beer itself is a hazy straw color, bordering on witbier territory. The smell is about average for a hefe, it's bananas and clove. The taste is also archetypal hefe, just done better than everyone else does. It's not too sweet like I often find wits to be, it's nicely grounded by some earthy notes. Just a great tasting hefeweizen.
The mouthfeel is good too, it's light and nicely carbonated. It's also decently dirnkable, it's still just a tad too sweet to be extremely drinkable. Overall, this has to be the best hefeweizen I've ever had. As someone who usually doesn't love the style, this is the only one I've ever had worth re-buying. 877 charactersshand, Jan 01, 2011

A - Pours a completely hazy straw golden color, with orange hues. My pour yielded a super foamy two finger head which is super appetizing.
S - Bananas, cloves and even some Belgian like esters are the prominent aromas in this prime example of the Hefe style. Some earthy grain notes are mixed in well. Nice mellow bready wheat notes to round out the smell.
T - Great banana and bread notes. Banana bread comes to mind instantly, duh! Even without the stupid lemon, im getting citrus hints. Very clean, crisp and delicious. 
M - Crisp, slightly dry and light bodied this beer is wonderful. Nice, small spiky carbonation.
D - Very highly drinkable. This is a low ABV beer that is like drinking a sparkling juice. So tasty.
This style has never been my favorite, simply because no one really knows how to do it like this. There are too many company's like Pyramid and Widmer who's sole existence is based on the popularity of their Hefeweissen and if people only knew how crappy those in comparison were we'd have so many more BA's in the the world. 1,084 charactersdubinsky, Dec 31, 2010

Poured two-thirds of a chilled bottle into a duvel tulip. After waiting for a gigantic white fluffy head to settle back into the glass, I swirl the other one-third still in the bottle and add it to my glass. I didnt always appreciate this style but my taste buds have evolved in the last 2-3 years and now i find the clove and banana smells to be utter bliss. A world-class beer.

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was the first beer I ever drank that really made me fall in love with the taste of beer.
 I had been drinking the usual domestic brands and a few imports for many years simply for the buzz factor and not really giving much thought to the actual taste and enjoyment of drinking.
 The thing that first got my attention was when my buddy poured the beer and how thick it looked as it went into the tall Wheat beer glass. 
 Then he rolled the bottle to get the yeast off the bottom and poured out that massive creamy head. The glass was a wonderful golden cloudy color that you couldn't see through.
 I took the time to actually smell the beer before taking a big glup of the head and yummy almost sweet banana tasting goodness.
 That was it, I've been hooked on this Wheat beer ever since that drink many years ago.
Appearance: Golden and Cloudy.
Smell: Fruity with a nice wheat note.
Taste: Fruity with a wonderful Fruity Bananna finish.
Mouthfeel: Thick and very refreshing.
Drinkability: One right after the other for me. I can drink these Hefe's all day long and never bore my tastebuds.
 I really dig this beer.
 While it's nothing special in the new world of Craft Beers, I still always buy a couple pints everytime I hit the Beverage Center because it still holds a special place in my heart as my first really good beer. 1,342 charactersDarthRadb, Dec 26, 2010

The appearance is a golden, cloudy, murky, dulled orange. It smells spicy and has the yeast you'd expect. This hits on all points. It tastes like a hefe should. It has the sweetness and yeast to represent the style like it should. For other beers I would describe all around aspects but for this, I remarkably, have nothing to say. It is the perfect Hefe. I almost can't believe it. It's very drinkable and you must try this. This is THE Hefe. 567 charactersaasher, Dec 24, 2010

A- A very nice hazy straw color with a nice goldish hue and a bunch of active yeast swirling about inside. Has a very nice white, creamy head that is alive with carb. Simply a great looking beer.
S- A very crisp and clean clove smell with a touch of pepper. As it warms some I am getting more of the clove smell with some bananas entwined with a nice subtle citrus aroma. An enticing and wonderful smelling beer. 
T- Well they have been brewing this beer for close to a 1000 years probably and god damn they got it right. Definitely not one of my favorite styles, but this is simply astonishing. A great balance of light citrus bite with a great clove sweetness. It's followed by a nice refreshing finish with a touch of pepper in it. Crisp and refreshing!
M- Lively, with a great tingle of carb. Clean, crisp and refreshing. Similar to champagne, it's alive and bubbly all over. Really, really enjoyable. 
D- Hahaha, your damn right. It's incredible I could drink this anytime of the year, but by the keg in the spring and summer. It's light, balanced and extremely refreshing. If you haven't tried it what the hell are you waiting for? 
I guess that's why they have been brewing for a century. Fantastic beer from a world class brewery. 1,426 charactersStormKing47, Dec 21, 2010

Enjoyed with a new friend at happy hour, the beer pours out of the tap smooth and golden straw color with a rich head. The aroma is citrusy and clean, the taste is crisp, wheaty, sweet and citrusy with only the slightest hint of hops to bitter it. 
As smooth as it is, and as clean as it is, it's surprising that it still manages to be more powerful by volume than your typical Budweiser. 
Listen up, this is your go-to drink at any bar that has it. 655 charactersafksports, Dec 19, 2010

Glowing hazy gold body with a constant lazy upstream of bubbles from down below. A frothy mountain of bright white foam stands well proud of the glass, sticking around til the last sip and leaving many sheets of lacing.
Fresh and fruity aromas: lemon zest, cloves, tart peach, wheat, baking bread. A surprisingly thick and smooth mouthfeel; this beer practically slides around the palate. Just enough gentle carbonation to keep things moving along. Loads of banana bread and tart wheat up front, but it's lemon and cloves that linger in the end. One of those "why don't I have this more often?" beers. Great stuff. 682 charactersPDXHops, Dec 17, 2010

Pours a hazed pale golden color with a billowy three-finger, eggshell-colored head that leaves sticky lacing all over the glass. I don't think I've ever seen a head this impressive. Truly a thing of beauty. Aromas of malted wheat, yeast, spiced coriander, banana and citrus. 
Opens with malted wheat, cloves, bananas and raw, earthy yeast. Tangs of lemon citrus surface in the background. Moderately crisp with a light effervescence. Minimal hop bitterness. Flavors of biscuit and banana bread emerge. Finishes clean with a peppering of spice.

A--Poured a vibrant orange with a rich, rich foamy stark-white head that took up much of the glass. It stayed around for a long, long time as well. Very lovely.
S--Banana, clove, orange, and other assorted fresh fruits hit the nose. Honestly, this has to be spot on for the style. This smells exactly like a hefeweizen should. 
T--Wonderful. The banana and orange hit the tongue and leave a lasting sweetness for a long time afterwards. This drink is very light, and the carbonation from the beer really helps cleanse the palate. No taste of the alcohol up front, but I get a little bit of it on the back of the throat after I swallow.
M--Very light bodied with a heavy amount of carbonation. This beer leaves you feeling refreshed. That's the best way I can describe it.
D--Perfect drinkability. You don't really feel the alcohol, and the beer is so light and refreshing that I am craving another before I even make it all the way through this one. 1,001 charactersMosley1212, Dec 12, 2010

A yeasty bread flavor joins the clove and each flavor stays there long after each taste is long gone. A light medium feel with the cleansing sensation of carbonation leaves the palate dry and clean. The original Hefeweissen and it does not disappoint. It has everything you would expect, the classic look and feel, then the taste is what every beer in this style strives to be. This beer lives up to expectations. 675 characterscameraman, Dec 10, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a hefeweizen glass.
Pours a beautiful unfiltered gold color with moderate carbonation and a nice white head. The aroma is very refreshing with a strong sense of clove, fruit and a bit of floral notes. The initial mouthfeel is actually quite sour, but finishes sweet with a strong taste of banana and citrus. Definitely tops my list as a great hefeweizen, I could drink this all day. 395 charactersProspero, Dec 08, 2010

Great sweet aroma of yeast, lemon, and hint of banana and spices.
This flavor is the definition of a superior wheat beer: mildly sweet with the perfect balance of clove, banana, and yeast. Just enough lemon/citrus sour taste to balance the sweetness. Very drinkable.
As a fan of this style, I think this is one of the best. Highly recommend. 487 charactersFanofHefe, Dec 08, 2010

A - Pours a hazy straw golden color beer with a nice fluffy white head that is about 1.5 inch tall.
S - Aroma is of clean banana notes and some nice clove. Phenols are so great. Some slight earthy grain notes are mixed in with nice mellow bready wheat notes.
T & M - Flavor starts off sweet and with nice banana hints. Great bread notes are in there as well with nice mellow wheat hints. Banana bread comes to mind right away. Probably one of the best hefes out there. Clean and delicious. Crisp and light bodied this beer can be paired with anything and goes well in every season.
D - Extremely high since its lower in ABV and great in flavors. 675 charactersJoEBoBpr, Dec 07, 2010

The color is very similar, an orange/yellow/wheat look. Very dense, but light enough to enjoy a few of. Very floral aroma, along with a lot of citrus. The head was good, a nice foam, not just laced bubbles on top.
If I ever have the chance, I'll definitely have more of this. 375 characterskneeland, Dec 05, 2010

Nice smell, citrus, yeast. Not strong enough to warrant a perfect rating, but pleasant.
Smooth and easy to drink but with a zestiness underneath that keeps things interesting. It's like there's a touch of lemon in the beer without putting one in there, which is nice.
Very, very drinkable. Could drink 6-7 without getting full or bored of the flavor. Extremely good beer. 558 charactersjar2574, Dec 04, 2010

Smells include fruity esters and apricot and hints of yeast. Clean overall.
Tastes like apricot and banana with a little yeasty overtone. It is a hefe and this is perfectly acceptable. Other fruits come up and some grains. Very tasty.
Mouthfeel is tingly and warming. Carbonation is appropriate and it is a wet beer. Correct to style.
Drinkability is superb. This is one tasty brew and I will have some more please.
Job well done. This is a hefeweiss poster child of which all others will be judged by. Outstanding, a true classic. 752 charactersbigrzman, Dec 03, 2010

Pours a pale yellow with a nice, bright white head. Good lacing and retention. Nice aroma. Clove, banana and some wheat and lemon. Perfect taste. Starts with a nice balance of clove, light peppery spice and lemon zest. Sweet banana and wheat are next in a perfect mix of flavor. No one aspect of the flavor is overpowering or artificial like some hefe's. The banana flavor is awesome. Crisp, light and refreshing. 427 charactersuustal, Nov 29, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a 16oz Weizen glass.
Appearance: Cloudy yellow, sometimes picking up a hint of green, and slight carbonation bubbles rising. Exactly what I would expect liquid wheat to look like. Frothy head, some of which lasted on the glass until the end.
Smell: Somewhat bright, flowery smell.
Taste: Initially bitter, then sweet and fruity. The perfect consistency-- not too heavy, not too light. This is one beer that I can taste in my mind before I ever even open the bottle.
Mouthfeel: Such an enjoyable lasting taste. Not bitter at all. The sweet/fruity taste just hangs there.
Drinkability: I am disappointed when it's gone! Very easy to drink with a price that is somewhat easy to stock. The perfect beer for a night when I just want a good beer without any frills. 776 characterstburus, Nov 28, 2010

A: Poured the bottle into my Weihenstephan weiss glass.It's a hazy straw color with a medium puffy off-white head that dissipates into nothing. Wish a bit of head stayed on the beer. 
S: Straw, banana, lemon, and earthy yeast.
T/M: Let it wash over you. Noticeable banana, though not extreme. Spicy, earthy wheat. Some clove and pepper-like spice from the yeast. Not a hop in sight. A tiny bit of alcohol as it warms. Body's light and crisp, with medium but prickly carbination which works great with the earthy wheat.
D: It doesn't get any better than this as far as wheat beers go. Has earned well its status as legendary. 678 charactersCharlatanSin, Nov 25, 2010

Two fluffy white fingers of white froth top a slightly hazy yellow body; exceptional lacing and head duration. Good nose, veering toward excellent, with lots of spice (clove and a dash of pepper) and fruit (banana and a hint of lemon).
The taste is superb! Lots of banana mixed with clove, with some lemon in the finish. Definitely full of fruit, Hefeweissbier is light on the tongue, rife with flavor, and easy to quaff. Very delicious. I only wish I had the chance to beat the heat with this a few months ago, sitting outside sipping this splendid Hefe, instead of "suffering" inside with it, extolling its virtues. Maybe the texture could be a little more effervescent, but that might be a product of a long (cooler) shelf life. Really, I don't think that mattered much.
This is an excellent Hefeweizen, smooth, a bit bubbly, and chock full of flavor. Terrific, almost enough to get me out of my "heavy" kick on which I've focused on bocks, barleywines, and Belgian beers. I guess I'll have to wait until spring, but this was a great tide-over beer until then. 1,194 charactersGehrig, Nov 24, 2010

A- Lots of soapy white head. Takes a long time to settle. Cloudy, pale gold is this unfiltered beer. A very nice amount carbonation. Putting your ear up to the glass sounds like walking in tightly packed snow, or rice crispy cereal. Ok amount of spotted lacing. Before pouring the last bit in I swirl the bottle and pour in the last bit. Some murky looking liquid settles down through the brew.
S- The usual suspects of a hefeweizen. Great aroma of yeast, cloves and banana. 
T- Very much like the aroma with a few additions. Upfront is a smooth banana taste, followed up nicely with the cloves. Tiny bit of the gum flavor, but not as potent as others. Ends with a somewhat bready flavor from the yeast. 
M- Nice and crisp, yet smooeth and very refreshing. Light bodied, but on the heavier side of light. Not like your macro light beers.
D- Very refreshing. Perfect session beer. Best Hefeweizen? Havent had enough in the style to make that call but its gotta be in the top ten, or even five regardless. 1,041 charactershaazer, Nov 21, 2010

This was actually one of my gateway brews into the craft beer world. Served from bottle into a Franziskaner Weissbier Weizen glass. Poured a massively hazy golden yellow-orange with a three finger massively fluffy pure white head that remained for quite awhile and subsided to one finger toward the end of the glass. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of bready malt, banana, cloves, and wheat. The flavor was of sweet malt, bread, banana, cloves, and subtle wheat. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall, this is my definition of a Hefe. This is truly a great brew in just about all aspects. Has an excellent light and well balanced flavor and aroma. If you haven't tried this one, get off your ass and do it! Pretty good gateway brew for beginners as well. 919 charactersthagr81us, Nov 19, 2010
3.04/5  rDev -30.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3The aroma is a wonderful concoction of wheat and banana, it smells a lot like banana bread, minus the nutty aspect. Some yeast and clove are detectable, with some earthy hops barely detectable. 
The taste is actually a little lighter than I anticipated, really much lighter than the nose suggests. There's some decent wheat flavor in the beer and maybe a hint of banana and clove. I'm not in love with the flavor to be completely honest, it's nice and simple, but doesn't leave me wanting more or wanting to give a raving review. A good sessionable summer brew yes, one of the best in the world; I think not. 609 charactersclaspada, Nov 17, 2010

A - Massive 3 finger head, white and bubbly. Classic cloudy yellow wheat color, slightly more orange than usual. Bubbles cascade from the bottom in an endless steam. Lacing is epic.
S - Clove, banana and yeast. Sweet malted wheat. Hints of lemon.
T - Malty sweetness and then a bit of spicy clove. A bit yeasty. Phenomenal. Not as much citrus as I prefer in my hefes, though lemon is certainly present. 
M - Light to medium body (closer to medium) with a great feel from the carbonation. Leaves the mouth perfectly content, no stickiness or dryness to complain about.
D - Goes down exceptionally well. Just a joy to drink. Easy to quaff and fun to experience. One of the true classics. 721 charactersgreenmonstah, Nov 16, 2010

A - Pours a large thick, fluffy head that dissipated at a medium pace. Gorgeous hazy golden color that is only amplified by the long slender glass. Looks rather carbonated. Minimal lacing. 
S - Cloves, coriander, banana, bubble gum sweetness. Incredible scents. You'd have to have practically no sense of smell in order not to smell whats going on in this beer. 
T - Cloves, coriander; the banana and bubble gum are more pronounced in the taste. Tastes so damn good, its so difficult to put the glass down. 
M - Light to medium body and I saw medium because there is just so much flavor in this beer. Very smooth. I remember this beer being more carbonated but its possible I got a slightly older bottle. 
D - Hefes might be my most favorite style and I've had a vast array both imported and domestic and I therefore can honestly say that this is my number 1. Ayinger and Hofbrau come in a close second. World class hefe, you'll have it once and always go back for more, all others pale in comparison! 1,070 charactersmicmillon18, Nov 16, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The best and the worst beers often call for (arguably) ridiculous narrative. This is just one thing that excites me, though, about beer - it's ability to at times be more than just a refreshing, intoxicating, (in various ways) delicious beverage. I'll say what I can about this one - truly the king of the hefes.
I know I'm in for a treat when I pour this into a tall weizen glass and the foamaroma cannot be contained. Angels are singing, trumpets are trumpeting. Tough to empty the whole bottle in one pour as the froth froths forth untamed - head a good 2-3 inches high on average, with the texture and look of soft summer cumulus. Properly poured, the light golden amber color glows like a sunbeam until the yeasty dregs cannonball down through, creating a sunflare swirl before obscuring into a wonderfully murky cloudiness. Yes, we have banana in the aroma, but it's at what I feel is the perfect potency - just in cool essence, not too peely or too fruity. An excellent, fresh baked, yeasty breadiness as well. Hops don't factor here to any degree of note. The taste is bright, lightly lemon meringue, a steady smooth supple maltiness, silky yeast in the finish, with an extremely well integrated, delicate and delightful tartness, thin yet rounded banana notes and only a hint of clove. The flavor of the grain really carries everything here nicely. I would drink this whenever, honestly, but my only knock against it is the degree of dryness in the finish, which I find just the tiniest bit too apparent. Overall, though, it leaves an invigoratingly fresh feeling in the mouth (palate). Just about without equal is this hefe. 1,635 charactersBouleboubier, Nov 14, 2010

Smells like banana, tin can and a slight smokyness - very much like you'd expect a hefeweissen to smell.
Colour as you would expect in a Weissen, medium cloudy, beautiful head though it dissipated a bit too fast.
Tin can taste a little too dominate, but a nice furtiness. The wheat malt character is evident.
Slighty less body than I like, but i might be due to high carbonation. Nice dryness, very refreshing. 436 charactersjesperm, Nov 13, 2010

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5When I poured this beer into a Weizen glass, I first noticed the impressive head. It was foamy, creamy, frothy, and so on and so on. There are so many adjectives to describe it, but simply put... it is the most impressive head I've ever seen on a Hef. When I took a sniff, I noticed a nice fruity aroma. As far as the taste, I got the banana flavor and a few other flavors that I still can't put my finger on. The flavor is definitely not as pronounced as a Paulaner, but maybe that makes it a less polarizing Hef. This beer is also extremely refreshing and surprising crisp and light. Overall, I'd say this beer is a great beer that is best drunk on it's own. That way, I can savor every last drop. 699 charactersPDX2LA, Nov 10, 2010

A: Beautiful dark golden color, hazy from all the yeast. Forms a MASSIVE 3-finger foamy white head that is about as inviting as it gets. The head seems to last forever and has good lacing. 
S: Dark ripe fruit (very sweet), lots of bright floral yeast, banana, and spices. alcohol esters are present in a very nice way. 
T: The banana shines in this one, without overpowering the rest of the flavors. It's a fairly complex mix of sweet dark fruits, floral yeast, and nice esters. It's really well balanced, not too sweet nor to strong, just mellow enough to be really refreshing. 
M: Very full body for a wheat beer, crisp mainly due to the light, champagne like carbonation. Has a clean wet finish with a pleasant mellow aftertaste. 
D: This is a great wheat beer and would be a 5 for drinkability if it wasn't quite as full body. On a hot summer day it might be hard to drink more than one of these. Other than that, I can drink this all day long on a nice cool summer day. 1,077 charactersSatchboogie, Nov 09, 2010

The smell of this reminds me of sweet bread, bananas and yeast. The malt is prominent and just by the smell you will know this is a full bodied beast of a beer. 
It tastes thick and heavenly, big malty mouthfeel with hints of earth, spice and bananas. It is essentially a perfect example of the Weißbier style. It is essentially a delicious bottled meal, flüssiges Brot! 
I am still partial to a few other beers; however, this is one of the best that you can find abroad. 623 charactersEwaldEichstaett, Nov 08, 2010

The beer is very well balanced that is great all-around. I tried the beer two ways, I poured most of it in my glass without the yeast, drank half and then roused up the yeast on the bottle and poured some of that into my glass to compare. I think I like the clear beer better.
The beer is a bright, lemon rind yellow without the hefe--with it turns a cloudy straw. The smell is lemony and bananay, and the yeast adds a very distinct spicy clove aroma. The beer tastes lighter and more delicately fruity without the yeast, but spicier with a little bubblegum with. The mouthfeel is smooth, but I think it could use a bit more body. Very drinkable with just a bit of sweetness and hop bitterness to give it some beer character. 794 charactersSoonami, Nov 04, 2010

S - In my 500ml Weizen glass, I don't get much of an aroma from this beer. Odd.
T - This is unexpected. I'm getting smokiness and a bit of a Band-Aid flavor. No sign of bananas or pineapples or other fruits as mentioned in others' reviews. Bad bottle? Points off for Band-Aids.
M - Good level of carbonation. A bit thin.
D - Despite the Band-Aid flavor, which is pretty subtle, I think I could drink this again, if only to see if I got a bad bottle, but maybe just because the smokiness is not intolerable (I am normally not a smoke fan). 654 charactersdvb, Nov 03, 2010

Tastes of bananas and cloves again, but not as sweet as the smell promised. There's also a lemony tartness there that would be more welcome if there were more sweetness to cut through.
The feel is fantastic - creamy and smooth yet light on the tongue.
Not too potent and a wonderful feel. If it were just a little sweeter it would be my favorite hefeweizen but it's just edged out by New Glarus' Dancing Man. It has the major advantage, though, of being available year round so I know I'm going to be reaching for this when I want a taste of summer come March in Wisconsin. 730 charactersmariposafan, Oct 29, 2010

It's a hazy, lazy gold. Cloudy enough to keep the light out, but just light enough that you can see the ever present bubbles rising to the top to form a monster of a white, cloudy head. 
Smells like a Belgian. Full of cloves and coriander, and maybe even some orange peel as well.
It tastes like a Belgian too, though the flavors are a bit weaker due to the wheat keeping everything in check.
This is a smooth beer, even with the spicy flavors. For the type, it's about as smooth as I've had. It's medium bodied and while not sweet, it's just sweet enough to round out all the flavors.
I don't know how you go wrong with this beer. It's got everything you want. The only thing I'd change is to give it a little more alcohol, but that's such a minor complaint. 873 charactersRickS95, Oct 24, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5500ml bottle into a perfect pint. 
A - Pours a clear pale yellow, with an enormous four fingers of head. Decent retention and lacing, but it doesn't last too long. 
S - Huge banana notes, along with cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, and plenty of yeasty bread. The aroma fills the room once poured. One of my favorite styles in this category, and this is absolutely one of the best-smelling beers in its style, if not THE best. 
T - Almost, but not quite, as great as the aroma. Less of the banana and more of the spice, with the nutmeg and cinnamon flavors out in front. Malty biscuit flavors lurk around the edges. Zero detectable alcohol, as expected for this style. 
M - Reasonably full but still light and effervescent. Great carbonation. A bit of a dry finish.
D - It doesn't weigh me down, and it's on the edge of being very sessionable. One of those beers that I could sit and drink all day.
O - For me this is the standard-bearer for the style. It's not quite perfect in every category, but overall this towers above most other hefes. I usually get somewhat older bottles, so I can only imagine how much I'd like this fresh. Factor in the price and you really just can't beat this one. 1,192 charactersdjmichaelk, Oct 23, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 0.5L bottle into an imperial pint glass. Bottle has a freshness date of 05.05.11. Pours with a voluminous, thick white head. Golden with some orange hues to the color. Very cloudy. Some lacing as the beer settles and is consumed. Some of the yeast emptied into the glass and floats near the top.
Smells include bananas, pepper, spices, esters--apples/pinapple, cloves...all kinds of wheat beer goodness.
Taste is magnificent...mirrors the smells and then some. Hefeweizen is not normally my first choice in beer styles, but this one is an exception. Delicious malt beginning with a hint of nutmeg and sweetness transitions to tropical fruit (see smells) followed by an intriguing array of spices in the finish--pepper and cloves. I swear I taste banana bread in there as well.
Mouthfeel is smooth and effortless. Perfect level of carbonation. Rolls over the mouth with a wide spectrum of flavors.
Drinkability...this is the most drinkable hefeweizen I have had. A pure pleasure to drink and savor. Let it warm slightly after removing from the fridge to enhance the experience if you have been storing it quite cold. 1,133 charactersJohnnyP3, Oct 23, 2010

A: Served in a Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Cloudy yellow gold with a huge two finger meringue like head. I actually joked with Mike about how rediculous it looked. He gave it a little curl at the end making seriously look like heavy whipped cream. Solid retention and tons of lace rings. About as inviting as a beer can look.
S: Fresh boquet of banana, clove, bubblegum and wheat. A touch of citrus is in there as well. Smells like a heffe for sure.
T: Mildy spiced wheat and banana are the main focus. The usual bubblegum is there as well. Light zesty citrus and a hint of yeast round out the finish. 
M: Medium creamy body with just a hint of graniness. Low carbonation keeps things smooth on the tongue.
D: Overall well deserving in it's place at the top of all heffes. Super drinkable. 829 charactersbeerwolf77, Oct 14, 2010

4.06/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4appearance; as perfect as what a Weißbier can be and true to the style in all ways. Cloudy yellow with a white head. Spectacular thick and creamy head. Lots of lacing and retention. One of the best heads I've ever seen in a beer.
smell; spicy yeast sweetness. Not an overly stong banana odor, just pure and well blended.
taste; the flavor is just a typical Weißbier but better blended and purer than most others. Yeasty flavors are more complex but still pretty typical. Not too impressed, this one is good but I can think of a few others that have a better more complex taste. Really a nice raw barley flavor in the aftertaste, that is what I like best of it.
mouthfeel; moderate thickness from the cream feel. Carbonation is very fine and gentle.
drinkability; a very delicious beer that is smooth without sacrificing flavor, drinkable to say the least....well done!
This is a very good beer but to be honest, I don't know what all the hype is about. Without a doubt this is a step above Franziskaner and Paulaner, but only a baby step. It taste from the bottle like lower quality Weißbier taste on tap in Bavaria. Well done there, but this beer never stood out from the rest to me. Many smaller, lesser known breweries in the Bavarian country side make equal if not better examples of this style not to mention Schneider. Reminds me of Stiegl that I've had on tap in Austria. 1,386 charactersSachsenfreude, Oct 10, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 500ml bottle into a globe glass. Pours a golden to slightly amber color with a solid head of about 2 fingers. The head will stick around for most of the beer, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. Beer is somewhat cloudy as one might expect.
Smell is as one might expect from a hefe as well. Banana and clove esters dominate the nose, with just the slightest hint of hop bitterness. Yeast also lend a bit of breadyness to the nose.
Taste is more forward on the clove, and a little less on the banana, although it still plays a huge part. 
Mouthfeel is pretty heavy for the beer, mostly because of the wheat. These styles of beer tend to be heavy anyway.
Drinkability is a bit lower for me. By the end, the wheat just makes it a chore to drink by the end. Taste is still great though. Also, I had a few sips that had a bit of a metallic feel, but I'm not quite sure if I was just going crazy a bit. All in all, I did enjoy my beer, and for the price, it ends up a good deal. 999 charactersmkorpal, Oct 09, 2010

Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge, frothy 4-5 finger white head. Excellent head retention. Nice lacing.
Smell: Banana, clove and yeast with a hint of lemon. What a hefeweizen should smell like.
Taste: Typical wheat up front followed by banana and clove in the middle and ending with a mix of spices, phenols and a hint of lemon. Aftertaste is dry and earthy with a very slight hoppy bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a high amount of carbonation. A little prickly, in a good way.
Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This is the perfect summer beer.
Overall: Excellent beer overall. I don't think wheat beers get any better than this. I guess that's what you can expect from the world's oldest brewery. 786 charactersadam42381, Oct 08, 2010

Smells of banana, apple, clove and a little bit of yeasty sweetness.
The taste is very nice, and quite spicy with lots of clove and pepper and fruitiness. In particular you get some banana, apple, pear, and a definite yeasty breadiness. 
Mouthfeel is excellent. Medium bodied and quite creamy, carbonated well, but not overly carbonated. Thicker than most hefeweizens I have had.
Drinkability is great, could definitely throw back quite a few of these. 539 charactersQuestionableScum, Oct 08, 2010

On-tap for Oktoberfest at Schnitzel Platz in Glendale Height, IL
I was able to steal some of this from my lovely and wonderful girlfriend during our most recent dining experience. This was a beautiful cloudy golden color with a stiff frothy white foam head. the aroma was of citrus and banana with the bready hint of wheat without being to overbearing. The hop aroma was nicely balanced with the malt and wheat. The taste was rather similar to the aroma, but the breadiness was much more pronounced in the flavor and the citrus really came through very strongly. The mouthfeel wasn't too sticky for a Hefe and I felt that it was rather pleasant. There wasn't too much sweet or savory flavor for this brew. It was right on point. One of the best Hefes on Earth to relax and drink down as much as possible. 845 charactersVdubb86, Oct 06, 2010
3.91/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Explosive amounts of carbonation creates as much head as you can handle. Huge thick fluffy white head. Golden straw colored body with carbonation exploding up the glass. Not sure what else you can do with this style...it's still a thin bodied opaque wheat beer so this isn't say THAT much.
The nose is of bananas, pears, bubble gum...what would you expect form a hefe? The what aroma finishes things off quickly. Nothing special. 
Well, damn. This is amazing. A sweet banana pear bubble gum malt profile that's then turns to a slight hop profile which then dies leaving a what/vanilla finishes that's amazingly dry yet not that off putting wheat flavor that many wheat based beers do. 
The carbonation helps make this beer feel thicker and creamier, but you can still tell it's a hair thinner than I'd ideally love.
Oddly enough it's a touch thicker feeling than a summer beer wants to be. That said you could put 3-4 of these away on a nice summer day without a second thought. Extremely worthy! 1,000 charactersbobhits, Oct 06, 2010

A-Pours a hazy golden yellow with a massive three finger creamy white head that looks like whipped egg whites. Fabulous retention and lacing.
S-Aroma is amazing and I'm not sure why I don't give this a 5. It may be spot on for the style, which is not a favorite of mine. If I find something better I will be flummoxed. Wheat malts, banana and clove from the yeast, and hop fruitiness.
T-Banana and cloves from the yeast. Slight caramel and some citric hoppiness. This is very nice.
M-Smooth and nicely carbonated. Refreshingly crisp and clean on a summer like day in early autumn.
D-This is the very best Hefeweizen I have ever enjoyed and may be the truest presentation of any style I have experienced. This must be extraordinary as it is the only beer with less than a 7% ABV in the top 20 beers on planet earth on this website. My only wish is that it was more readily available and affordable.

Pretty powerful smell here. Lemon, banana, hops...it's all here in a nice lil bouquet. 
Ohh banana with a bite at the end. Shit, it bit me! Time to bite it back! *burrrrp* Feels like it runs the gamut of taste with some sweetness, sour and a bit spicy at the tip. 
Medium body feel that boasts a welcoming after-taste. I love beers that produce a healthy belch, and this one produces an alright one with a foamy aftermath that could spoil that hot date of yours. I feel it in my jaw muscles.
Chug! Well, you could, but this is a better beer to relax with, as it scores highly in every area. As long as you can pronounce the name with confidence, this could become a highly lovable beer by all.

Some traces of foam leave themselves on the glass as the beer is drunk down. Nice hazy dark straw to light gold color.
Aroma of clean lemon banana, light hint of cloves. Taste bit of sweet lemon citrus, yeast, banana, and grape soda note. Midway the carbonation and wheat give a twangy feel on the tongue. Nice yeasty wheat bread, banana custard, and cloves on the finish with just the barest touch of bitterness in there.
Medium-high carbonation tickles the tongue nicely. Also the yeasty sediment gives it extra body and mouthfeel.
So tasty and delish! So very drinkable, a classic and an all-time favorite! Makes me wonder what this must taste like in person at the brewery fresh!?! Probably like heaven-sent ambrosia... 1,007 charactersmilkbaby9, Sep 29, 2010

Very fruity flavors, with lots of banana, orange, clove, a touch of spice and bitterness on the finish.
Nicely carbonated, leaves you wanting another sip almost immediately. This beer is very drinkable, great for for a hot day.

4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From bottle to weizen glass
A: Pour a dark straw-yellow with vibrant carbonation. A thick 2-1/2 inch head forms with large and tight bubbles - very effervescent. Lacing seems heavy and cascades down the glass.
S: Sweet banana bread hits your nose, combined with some clove and holiday spice. Aroma is propelled by the bubbling carbonation and alcohol volatiles.
T: The taste follows the nose with with lightly spiced banana bread up front. The banana esters are quite distinct and combine nicely with the bready, pastry-like malt-backbone. Although this isn't a modern 'big' beer, the flavors are loud and pronounced, making their balance all that more discernible. There's really no alcohol in the flavor, but there is just enough hop zest to counter the sweet profile, leaving the finish surprisingly dry and clean.
M: Full bodied for the ABV, and the carbonation is perfect. It feels like you're cleansing your mouth with each swallow. Really, the carbonation is perfect. I can't remember where the carbonation complexion stood out in a beer more than this.
Drinkability and notes. Easily one of the best Hefeweizens I've tried. I couldn't stop drinking this. Even if you're typically not someone that goes for that Bavarian banana-clove thing, or wheaty ales in general, the balance of this beer makes it impossible to dislike. With the 5.7% ABV, this is going to be my new daytime/session brew. 1,404 charactersrand, Sep 29, 2010

Very citric to the nose, with an abundance of yeastiness. Some clove, bubblegum and underripe banana as well. All the proper hefe aroma ingredients.
Somewhat sweet citrus right up front that becomes balanced in the middle and just slightly bitter at the end. Round it out with some banana through the back half of the mouth and a bit of clove right at the finish. Very smooth flavoured.
Medium bodied with carbonation just a little less coarse than the average for this style. This is possibly king of the easy drinking/refreshing brews. Hope it sticks around Alberta for a long time. 691 characterselricorico, Sep 25, 2010

A: Pours a hazy gold/straw color with active effervescence. Head is a fluffy 3 inches that recedes over a few minutes into a thick film on the glass, with clumps of generous lacing down the sides.
S: The bananas are very strong on this one. Wheat, cloves, lemon, and a touch of bubblegum. 
T: Following the nose, has a delicious wheat and bready base. Bananas provide a sweet flavor profile, with a touch of yeasty funk. Lemon and cloves prickle the tongue at the end of the flavor, working well with the carbonation to produce a refreshing effect. 
M: Light-bodied, high carbonation -- good for the style, providing a clean and crisp finish. Slightly watery. 
D: The gold standard for the style. I like New Glarus's hefs for an American interpretation, but let's be honest: if you could only give one A+ to a hefeweizen, this would be the one. 878 charactersArbitrator, Sep 22, 2010

I poured this into a FFF pint glass:
A: Very cloudy, downright murky golden/yellow color that is lighter in color on the bottom and darker as it reaches the top. The dark golden section abruptly transitions into a huge white foamy head.
S: Banana and cloves upfront with a hint of fresh coriander.
T: It almost tastes like some sort of off-banana flavored bubble gum. It has a "fresh" fruit aftertaste as opposed to a "rotten" fruit one that I sometimes associate with this style.
M: Mild tanginess, but absolutely no pucker factor! Smooth and refreshing.
D: To date, the most drinkable Hefeweizen I've ever tasted. The funnest part was devouring the last bit. The head, which stuck around throughout the session like a co-dependent dog in heat, stayed at least an inch thick at all times. Sucking down the last bit of that tasty whipped cream-like froth was a moment worthy of Kodak. 972 charactersChaney, Sep 20, 2010

T - The flavours aren't as strong as the scent implies, but they are delicious. The cloves come off the top, but are not overwhelming. Sweet orange citrus zest, faint banana and a bubble gum finish. Very nicely balanced and flavourful offering.
M - No complaints in this department either, light, bubbly, wet and smooth. A tad more carbonation feel on the tongue might help bump it into the top range.

Bubbles of carbonation float up from the bottom. It's cloudy with a very light orange color. Almost seems lighter at the bottom of the glass than it does up top, but I'm sure it's just the glass. This is one of the best looking beers I've seen and is very enticing. Smells of banana and spice. Very sweet aroma. Taste is also very sweet, with the taste of the spices up front and a powerful banana and bubblegum aftertaste. Awesome. It's a little bit on the lighter side in terms of mouthfeel. Probably the most drinkable beer, the ultimate session beer. It's light, refreshing and has a moderate ABV. My favorite Hefeweizen. 731 charactersBlanco, Sep 18, 2010

A- This poured into my Erdinger Weissbrau glass a slightly hazed yellow with a tinge of orange at the top. A massive 4 fingers worth of bright foamy white head. Some mountain looking lace left behind after this gets settled down. Lots of carbonation visible.
S- Strong aromas of banana, clove, and peppery spice. Bready, yeasty and a little citrusy as well.
T- This is probably the strongest flavor of banana that I've had in a Hefe and it's present throughout. All the other aromas mentioned in the nose are present in the taste, but they're toned down. There's a hint of bubblegum that comes in at the middle and rounds this out.
M- A light-medium body. Carbonation isn't over the top, but just enough to tingle the tongue.
D- Long before I really got into craft beer I remember trying a Hefeweizen and damn near spit it out. I think if it was Weihenstephaner's Hefe I would of been converted much quicker, this was gone in no time flat. 1,001 charactersDawkfan, Sep 18, 2010

S: Smells of bananas with a hint of bubblegum and apples right away. Not as super banana rich as some of the hefewiezens I have tried though. There is also a sweet smell that is akin to creamed corn, and a touch of bread.
T: The taste is straight forward bananas and corn bread. Then hints of green apples, bubblegum, and een less pronounced cloves. Just the slightest touch of leafy hops if you pay close attention.
M: Mouthfeel has a medium body with plenty of carbonation making it a bit dry. It is fairly sweet with a touch of both tartness and spice.
D: Easy as water to knock back. A perfect accompaniment to spicy sausage or a hot day. All around this is the flagship of the style for good reason. The flavors are perfectly balanced and it is quite a satisfying brew at 5.4% alcohol. 1,079 charactersbillshmeinke, Sep 15, 2010

S- Cloves, banana, peach, light notes of sour apple with a very nice aroma of bready yeast.
T- Yeasty bread notes, banana, wheat, light spicy cloves, fantastic balance in flavors.
M- Refreshingly high carbonation, crisp, with a dry note on the finish with a nice spice note on the end, good medium body.
D- Very drinkable, nicely balanced, perfect for the style. 450 charactersmwagner1018, Sep 14, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.
A- Very cloudy dark straw color with a finger and a half of creamy white head. Eventually reduces to a thin fluffy head with film-like lacing.
S- Crisp wheat smell with some spicy clove and coriander notes and some banana.
T- The banana and spice notes take over in the beginning, with a crisp, cracker-like wheat finish. 
M- Nice creaminess with good carbonation. Surprisingly rich.
D- Pretty good, though some rather big flavors might cut me off after a few.
This is definitely a good beer, but maybe one I don't sufficiently appreciate due to a style bias. Hefeweizens and witbiers with big banana and spice characters aren't really my thing. That being said, this is a rather enjoyable incarnation of the style, just maybe not the A+ beer some suggest it is, for me at least. 825 charactersgeryeb624, Sep 14, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked this up on a recent trip to Ontario. Best before date of May 2011.
Pours a cloudy yellow color with a very impressive amount of thick white head. Head takes a while to evaporate and leaves copious amount of lacing on the glass.
You can pick out the banana and spice when opening the bottle. Very nice. Taking further whiffs gives some wheat and a small bit of yeast.
Some clove and spice up front, along with a light wheat taste. Banana comes through in the end. Clove and banana linger in the aftertaste. Smooth finish. Nice and refreshing. 
I think this has supplanted my favorite Hefeweizen. Sadly, this isn't available locally. Very easy to just keep drinking and drinking, with the flavor making you want to keep drinking and drinking. 751 charactersSeanstoppable, Sep 14, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into my Weihenstephaner Weizen glass this brew pours an opaque golden yellow with almost a 4 inch thick pillow of a head. The brew looks bold and in charge. The king of Hefeweizens with its white pillow crown.
S: The pleasant banana like aroma welcomes the drinker to this brew. Very natural wheat and clove. Very earthy.
T: The flavor is refreshing. A lot going on here for a style which many brewers don't put enough time into. Thankfully Weihenstephaner had almost 1000 years of time to get this one right. Banana like flavors, clove and spice, slight bitterness on the finish.
MF: Mouth feel is great for the style, but a little light and watery at times. Carbonation saves this brew and gives it a fuller feel.
D: Drinkability is definitely a 5. No where can you find a brew that you can drink multiple ones, is refreshing, and at the same time is complex and big enough to satisfy the pallet. 
Overall, Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier is excellent, but please don't stop here. I'd suggest picking up their holiday pack that comes with a glass, and a few of their other offerings which will blow you away. 1,121 charactersTKEbeerman, Sep 12, 2010

Appearence was overwhelming head of 1 and a half inches with a cloudy beer coloured body.
Smell was banana and cloves.
Taste was similar, to be honest I was kinda disappointed, to much like witbier for me. Grew on me as I drank though.
Mouthfeel was good.
Drinkability, well expensive and has to be drunk slowly + i'm not a fan of the style, won't buy again, that said, not bad for this style. 455 charactersphilphilphil, Sep 11, 2010

A - Huge mountainous 3 finger, cloud-like, thick white head. Lot's of carbonation. Cloudy and golden. Looks yellowish at the bottom and orange at the top. Really nice.
S - Huge banana aroma. A little yeasty too. Subdued but delicious.
T - Fruity. I can tell there's lot's of spice notes as well and the wheat is noticable. Less banana than the aroma but maybe some orange or citrus in there. Lot's of clove too.
M - Smoother and crisper b/c of the wheat. Really carbonated in the mouth so as to make it dance along your tongue. Really smooth with a light body.
D - Huge drinkability on this. Enough flavour and complexity to keep me interested and goes down smooth with a light body that won't fill you up too much. Really refreshing. 794 charactersbylerteck, Sep 11, 2010

Color is a hazy yellow with a little orange. Aroma is sweet wheat, banana, a little citrus, light smokey phenolics, apricot and honey. Flavor is a bit weak and neutral, but not unpleasant. Standard hefe stuff. Sweet, vanilla, clove banana. Lively carbonation. A pretty tasty hefeweizen, but I would imagine it would be better closer to the source. 468 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 10, 2010

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a two finger head that sinks slowly into a thick layer. lacing from the head is already left from a bright white head. Each pour to fill the glass from the retreating head is an explosion from within. The body is a deep haze of golden. True to the style.
S: The standard of Hefe, a clove on the front with a layered spice inter mingling with banana and slight citrus notes. This again is true to style. 
T/M:: As the nose suggests clove and banana, with a nice subtle spice finish, this brew has a powerful off taste, that I think makes it what an all star it really is. The mouthfeel is smooth and lingering tastes stand up to how the perfect style should represent. Mellow, cool and calm this is a winner. I am getting a strong ABV sensation, but for the 5.4%, I feel that from the taste I would expect more.
D: I cannot put the glass down, this is a goto hefe. I would want it to have a bit more ABV for the intensity of the taste, as some others of the Wisconsin offering have the same varied taste intensities have more, but that it what makes it a drinkable beer. I would seek this out again, but if it was holdin' a bigger ABV punch I would get a case. 1,168 charactersGDBEERMAN, Sep 07, 2010

A: Haze golden color with a white frothy head that last a bit leaving some of the foam attach to the glass, some visible carbonation.
S: Bread, banana, very fruity, sweet and a little bit bitter at the same time.
T: banana, lasting bitter flavor, gassy feel in mouth, anisette, for a 5.4 ABV you can taste a little bit of the alcohol, watery.
Overall it's a very refreshing and inviting beer that you can knock a couple in no time, it's one of the best weissbier that I have tried. 510 charactersarturorg, Sep 05, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First off, I will admit I am a total newbie to the world of wheat beers, so forgive any hyperbole I might bestow upon this particular brew. The reviews piqued my interest, and I was lucky enough to find this at my local "beer and wine" shop.
I'm pretty much always been a Pilsner guy, and never really gave much thought to trying any wheat beers.
Simply put, this is the most delicious beer I have ever experienced in my life. I've found all of the A and A+ reviews spot on, regarding the aroma, flavor, and complexities. Every sip was a "close your eyes and savor" experience. 
After the first bottle I was so thrilled I went out and bought a proper weizen glass. And it did, indeed, make the beer even that much more enjoyable. (Especially with a nice platter of mild veal sausage!)
If there is any hefe out there that someone thinks is more delicious than this, please let me know and I'll give it a try.
This would be very, very hard to beat. 951 charactersGeoJ, Sep 05, 2010

The color is a crisp clear gold and a frothy white head bubbles up nicely and results in decent lacing.
The aroma is a bouquet of clove and banana, staples of the hefeweizen, but taken to a more intense level. A punch of grains and yeast.
Tastes like a caramel covered toasted banana. Minus the sugary stuff. Just so powerfully balanced, the bitterness barely slides in with the finish, but the flavor really relies on its fruitiness and toasted grain.
A slightly watery mouthfeel, balanced but a little lacking in the crispness from some other beers in this style.
I have to say, I think this is one of my desert island beers. Easily the most drinkable hefe ever, if not the most drinkable and delicious beer I have ever had, ever. 846 characterscnally, Sep 05, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle into pint glass, no noticeable freshness date.
Appearance is a golden yellow body capped by a foamy white head. Hefe's are always described as being cloudy since they are not filtered, but I've found this to be a bit clearer than most Hefe's. 
Aroma is oh so sweet and spicy. Initially there is a bit of a banana-yeasty presence quickly overcome by a stronger clove aroma. A soldid wheat malt body gives a bit of bready note.
The taste pretty much matches the aroma. Sweet banana followed by some spice, with bready malt notes on the finish. Really a quite enjoyable flavor profile, making obvious as to why this beer is such a classic.
Mouthfeel is light, smooth, and a little bit bubbly, but not overly so. Overall, an amazing hefe that pretty much defines the style. This beer has been around forever, and it deserves all of its praise. 862 charactersKinsman, Sep 03, 2010

 Cloudy, hazy gold in color with a touch of oranginess, beautiful dense solid milk colored head.
 Sweet smelling malt with banana and clovetouch of yeasty lemon.
 Taste is pure hefe-weizen gold,minimal hops detected with a slightly fruity dryness.

T: Slightly dry, with a tangy orange in the mix that almost comes off like lemon, buttery mild nuts (pecans), bready backbone with a borderline coppery finish. Excellent.

4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into a pub glass. Pours a hazy orange with an initial finger of snowy white head. The head dissipates quickly, and leaves little lacing on the glass. Active carbonation visible at the surface of the glass. 
Right out of my fridge (likely ~40°F), hint of banana and citrus, with a little clove and light malt, but overall feint. Aroma does improve when the beer warms up later though.
Taking a sip, lemon peel type bitterness initially, with a little spice and malt later. Finishes very clean and crisp, refreshing. Really cleans your palate and would be excellent paired with spicey food. The carbonation is just perfect in helping to deliver the scent of your beer to your nose while drinking. 
An easy drinking hefeweisse, perfect for a session beer, and I can see why this is the highest rated one. No excessive lingering spice or bitterness that's common in other hefe's or Belgian style witbiers, that would affect the food. 954 charactersnataku00, Aug 29, 2010

A - Very nice cloudy, golden yellow, honey-like color. A nice pillowy white head (about 1 finger) sits nicely at the top.
S - Great notes of banana and some nice spiciness to it; cloves and some slight coriander aroma. Very nice yeasty, bready aroma as well. Lemon peel is also apparent.
T - Follows the nose nicely but with a bit more clove spice to it. Great combo of the banana, clove and breadiness to this one. Some nice lemon peel flavors make it very refreshing.
M - Nice mouthfeel on this. Could use a little less carbonation in my opinion and perhaps it would be that much better. Overall a "good" mouthfeel.
D - Extremely drinkable beer. The low ABV and the combination of flavors makes this one easily a great choice for a hot day. Extremely refreshing and satisfying. 881 charactersKAP1356, Aug 29, 2010

A: Gorgeous translucent orange-yellow-goldenrod colour; looks like frosted glass. Nice frothy head, but lacing is minimal and dissipates faster than I would like.
S: Sweet nectar scent brimming with fruitiness (banana, kiwi, peach strawberry, and other tropical fruits) a fresh wheaty maltiness, and a deliciously unmistakable Belgian yeastiness. Deliciously tantalizing; brings the drinker in and excites the senses. Just under perfect.
T: Sweet fruity, yet balanced flabour. Powerful/distinct clove and banana with a wide yet still subtle palette of other fruits. Quite wheaty in a pleasant way. Missing the depth of taste that a higher abv would bring, but still DAMN good.
M: I would have loved more booziness, cause I feel the higher abv would bring out more flavours. However, a hefe doesnt usually have that booziness or high abv so I can't really knock it too hard. A little fizzy in the mouth when I might have appreciated a little less. Very very refreshing and satisfying.
D: Good lord, I could and would drink these all night if I could, and I would feel spolied doing it. A rare perfect session beer. 5.4% abv and 100 times its weight in flavour. I'm giving it the rare 5 for drinkability. So effing good. 1,270 charactersWhiteweasel, Aug 28, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I picked up a 500mL bottle of this classic brew for a reasonable $3.49 at Hoosick Beverage in Troy NY. Code 3339 on the label. Poured cold into a chilled weizen glass at 9am, I thought it'd make a good breakfast to start the weekend with.
This cloudy golden yellow brew gives a great frothy white meringue head that forms large peaks and sinkholes as it settles, great 3D stucture. On the nose is a strong dose of dry banana peel, earthy yeast, spicy wheat. The feel is light-moderate bodied with carbonation a bit rigorous and fizzy for the style, not as smooth as I had hoped. Taste is dry banana peel, stale cinnamon, yeast, finishes dry with lingering banana peel astringency. The brew has left some healthy wisps of lace throughout the session. A good hefe, and a tasty choice for breakfast on a lazy Saturday morning. 824 charactersBeerNinja007, Aug 28, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 500ml bottle into my 500ml Schneider Edel-Weisse glass. I think my cellar may be a bit above the recommended 46-52 degree F temperature, as I was only able to get a portion of the bottle into my glass; a very large white foam head took up most of the glass. The liquid is a darker straw color and has a good amount of tiny bubbles rising within. Once I was able to swirl around the bottle and pour in some of the yeast, the beer took on the appropriate opaque appearance. Lacing is even and beautiful.
The nose has plenty of banana, pepper and wheat. There is a hint of sweetness to the aroma, but it doesn't lead me to believe that this will be too sweet of a beer. 
After four pours, the bottle is now empty and the liquid comes up to the .5L line on my glass. I'm ready to take a sip. I can taste plenty of ripe banana, as well as some cloves. There is a flavor that makes think of how raw bread dough would taste. There is some pepper as I swallow, and a brief citrus aftertaste. The fruit disappears quickly and the pepper remains, as does the wheat. This is how a Hefeweisse should taste.
The beer has a light body, but as I swirl it around my mouth, it feels a bit thick. Perhaps it is all the carbonation foaming up? There is some coating, but it isn't sticky. It seems to vanish quickly.
I find this beer to be very drinkable. The alcohol levels shouldn't be a problem for a few rounds, and the flavors are quite inviting. Also, the beer is very refreshing. This is my first time enjoying this beer, it won't be the last. 1,548 charactersToasterChef, Aug 28, 2010

S - Light fluffy sweet fruity smells and only the most mild of citrus. Orange peel. A bit of lavender. Some banana peel. Subtle but complex. A freshly baked cake with vanilla icing.
T - Mild wheat and barley flavors set the background for the citrus and estery flavors. Aftertaste has a very tiny alcohol bite too in that it just tickles the tongue gently.
M - Neither loose and watery nor thick and chewy. Pretty much in between but a bit of carbonation gives it a bit of a cotton candy feel in your mouth. In such a way that it just disappears into nothing when it hits your tongue
D - Quite pleasant. A desert beer. Maybe not the most refreshing on this hot day, but this beer hides a good amount of character into a small package. I have to be honest this is at least a star or two better than I imagined it'd be. 939 charactersjeranbrews, Aug 22, 2010

A cloudy golden orange with more bubbles then I thought you could fit into a beer, a very gentle pour gives me a giant three finger head that forms a dome over the top of the glass and just sat there ever so slowly falling leaving patches of lace along the way
S some citrus, clove and banana that you would expect from a great example of the style and a little dry cereal that I wasn't looking for but pretty darn good nonetheless 
T not far from the smell and there's nothing wrong with that, I pick up on a little spice I couldn't smell. A good beer without doubt but I will admit the darker version did more for me 
M the carbonation works well for it giving it a fluffy feel that gives it some body at the same time 
D drinking this on a chilly summer evening is a pretty easy thing to do, a great example of the style and one everyone should try
I will drink this again with no problems, and at less then 4 bucks a bottle it's oh so very worth it. This may become my go to beer for the few days remaining of summer here in Calgary. This is another great addition to the growing beer list in Alberta 1,162 characterswordemupg, Aug 22, 2010

Poured out of a bottle into my hefeweizen glass...fitting, right?
A1 - Been a while since I poured a hefe. I poured way too vigourously and I'll I got was about a hand with of beer, and a hand and a half width of foam. Onto the smell, I'll be back here after 2nd pour.
S - Lots of cloves and bananas! This is some potent stuff. I think Live Oak Hefeweizen had a touch more sweetness...this is all cloves and spices. The belgian yeast/malts definitely shine through.
A2 - The head is pillowy, and soft, and just sits there like a thunderhead...a bulbous thunderhead, on top of the beer. The beer itself is a cloudy golden, but when holding it up to my TV, and wiping the sweat of the glass, I can see the sports commentators. There are some bubbles rising. It's a light golden on the bottom, and a light orange on top. Just a beautiful beer. Beautiful lacing and legs are left after every sip
T - Pretty much follows the nose, but just a tad bit softer than the potency that you get from the smell. Cloves, and bananas, and spices. It's really nice.
M - Slightly creamy at first that leads to light, crisp, refreshing...nice carbonation. Spot on. I have no idea how you can make this any better.
D - What a summer beer. This is fantastic. Though I think I've become a bit of a hophead and would prefer an IPA over a hef, this is definitely worthy of the praise from "the world's oldest brewery." 1,505 charactersKaiser81, Aug 22, 2010

A- Bright in color, hazy, and an overload of big bubbly snow-white foam. Doesn't want to go down, this takes a while to pour.
S- Clove, banana, vanilla, other spices. 
T- Wheat bread, peppery spices, and ripe fruit. There's a great burst of flavors in this one. A kiss of hops in the finish. Mostly banana, a bit of apple and orange as well. 
M- High carbonation, a bit lively, keeps the beer moving and keeps me coming back.
D- High. I've had this beer a LOT and will continue to buy it. There's a reason it's so well-regarded... 
Note- I've had this overseas and am happy to say that it tastes more or less the same- we're getting pretty fresh stock on the East Coast. 711 charactersShogoKawada, Aug 21, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured a cloudy golden oak color. Seriously. That may not have been used before to describe a beer, but its the exact color of my kitchen cabinets that are stained a golden oak.
Nice whipped cream head... about 1.5 inches by the end of the pour.... my wife said it looked like meringue, and it was delicate like it too. The head was at least a 1/2 inch when I finished the 1/2 litre too.
Smells like a hint of banana, wheat, clove and more wheat. Phenolic. Just like a good hefe should be.
Taste was outstanding. Not over the top. Just right. Banana, clove and wheat are evident in the taste as well as the smell.
Feels soft in the mouth... sensuous almost. Nicely carbonated. 
Very drinkable. Nice in the heat of these dog days of summer! An outstanding example of a stellar hefe! 786 charactersIcehouse57, Aug 21, 2010
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Easily the lightest (in style/color) beer that i've reviewed yet... Fairly new to this style as i normally yield to bigger American beers. 
Pours a bright copper color with a strong head that took a while to settle down so i could properly fill my pilsner glass.
I smell a bright floral scent with a bit of fresh cut grass once it warmed up a hair.
Flavors are great... a bit of unripe banana and lot of wheat initially comes out then a nice roasted wheat flavor in the back. Seriously amazing here...
Definitely not what i was expecting in terms of how round the flavor is, it's full yet crisp.
Rolling around in my mouth are tiny bubbles, not unlike a sparkling wine, but the flavor is able to work through the carbonation and in the end you have the strong upfront flavor mixed with an extremely effervescent beer.
I'm blown away, this is seriously good. And not just "good for a hefeweizen", but good. 907 characterskiya, Aug 21, 2010

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Have enjoyed this many times, finally getting around to reviewing.
Poured from bottle to weiss glass.
Appearance - Pours a hazy golden yellow with some beautiful orange highlights with a huge bubbly 4 finger white head. Laces all the way down the glass leaving it's remnants. Tons of bubbles rushing through this one.
Smell - Very bready, yeasty and wheaty. These smells dominate but they are there to perfection. The banana and clove are right up there too, the banana less than the cloves. This smells very nice. Maybe even a little orange rind?
Taste - The taste is just simply awesome, tons of very clean wheat and yeastyness with some great underlying clove flavors. As it warms a bit more fruit comes out but I'm just amazed at the "clean" taste of this beer. It isn't super complex, but why does it have to be? Superb.
Mouthfeel - This is smooth and wonderful, the carbonation and weight are almost perfect. There isn't much else to say, just a great mouthfeel here.
Drinkability - Way more than Bud Light, I can tell you that. I could drink several 500ml bottles of this, and I would. This is one to drink all day on a hot summer day.
Amazing. 1,158 characterscvaypai, Aug 18, 2010

Hints of banana and maybe orange come through. The mouthfeel is low carbonation and creamy. Overall it is very drinkable, smooth, and well balanced.

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a 500 ml tall brown Euro bottle, best before on back label says 01/06/2011. Pours out a cloudy marmalade hue, tall chunky frothy white head with great retention.
Clean fruity esters and sweet bready malt, light phenols, light vanilla, light candied banana.
Flavour starts pretty clean for a Hefe, soft light bready malt, light vanilla in the middle, mild warming phenols on the finish, while the banana esters rise up on the finish as well, but lingers on into the aftertaste.
Medium-light mouthfeel, soft carbonation, very quenching.
A pretty damn good Hefe from what claims to be the world's oldest brewery (of course I'm assuming oldest operating brewery). Still, it's one of those moments when the hype greatly over-shadows the actual experience. It's a well put together wheat beer, but I don't quite think it's the holy grail of the style. it's up there though... 878 charactersIronDjinn, Aug 16, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4500mL bottle into an oversized pilsener glass; poured cold and allowed to warm as tasted. Not my style usually, but had to revisit it when I saw how high it was ranked in BA 100.
A - Pours cloudy orange with an incredibly rocky head that is incredibly insistent...
S - Everything you've heard; vanilla, banana, clove, lemon....impressive as I usually don't get much in this department.
T - As I said, this is usually not my style, but this is pretty impressive. The most prominent flavor, of course, is the banana/clove hit from the yeast, but it's not overwhelming and it's quite well-balanced with the touch of hoppiness that is present. The aftertaste is a mix of faint hoppiness along with a lemon/banana tang that stays around for quite a while.
M - The carbonation is pretty incredible; the bubbles are large, but there's so many of them that the impression is one of filling the mouth, which adds to the taste of course.
D - On a warm summer day, really could drink a zillion of these; I find myself taking big gulps even during this review.
Have pretty much ignored Weissbiers for a few years, but after this reminder may need to come back to them. Am more of a Pale Ale/IPA guy, but this is going down pretty good and am glad I picked it up; the "banana" flavor is pretty toned down in this example, which is fine for me. 1,331 charactersbosox941827, Aug 16, 2010

A: Cloudy, hazy yellow with a huge, white head. The head has very long-lasting retention and leaves a copious amount of lace all over the glass. Very nice.
S: Banana, clove, spices, apples, wheat malt.
T: Refreshing, delicious, amazing...I could go on. Certainly one of the best hefeweizens in the world. It is anything and everything a great German wheat beer can be.

A-Pours a hazy saffron with an incredible head of bright white foam thats three fingers high. As the head melts its amazing retention fades slowly leaving large chasms in its top and laying down amazing sheets of lace leaving the glass look just like spent bubble wrap. stellar simply stellar.
S-Smells of delicious banana nut bread almost.... with hints of bubblegum and wheat. No alcohol apparent at all.
T-The taste is stellar. All banana and wheat sweetness that tastes delicious. There is an extremely clean finish with no bitterness at all.
M-The mouthfeel is silky smooth with just enough carbonation to keep things exciting. 
D-This beer is amazingly drinkable. I have yet in my life to find a better hefe than Weihenstephaner. I have compared all others to this so far. If I was rating on a scale of 5 to the style this would easily be across the board. The smells erupt from the glass the taste is not only dead on for the style but also downright explosive for a wheat beer. The drinkability is both flawless and dangerous as you will require to buy more of this before you are ready if your not careful. A sixteen oz bottle can last no more than 5 minutes if you're not paying attention. 1,242 charactersFieldzy27, Aug 15, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This used to be one of my standard beers back in graduate school - what a great beer for hot summers. Absolutely one of the most drinkable beers in the world as there is an amazingly quick and clean finish. Very little alcohol and no bitterness. Had one last night at the Rathskellar in downtown Indianapolis during a friend's "surprise" 30th birthday...took a few drinks and looked down to find it empty. Yup, dangerous!
Received in a 22 ounce weizen glass, this hazy orange brew came stock with a thick, sticky, three finger head that was doing its best to look like wallpaper on the side of my glassware. It looks like a heavy murky beer, but turns out to be more in the medium-bodied range.
A strong smelling beer when compared to others of the same style. Has the telltale hefeweizen malty-wheatiness, in addition to a spicy banana, and a bit of clove. That yeasty hefeweizen smell gets the saliva flowing!
Yup, still an outstanding interpretation. Weihenstephan claims to be the world's oldest brewery - well, I suppose you don't stay around this long unless you brew good beer. A nice crisp beer, this one is built to be put away quickly. Definitely the hefeweizen yeast, banana, and wheat flavors that the nose suggests. The thing that separates Weihenstephaner from the others is the boldness of the flavor. I certainly appreciate a good wheat beer, but this one is definitely one of the best. The beer bursts with flavor in each drink, but disappears rather quickly at the end, making it extremely drinkable. Still one of my favorites.

Pours with a half-glass full of sea foam-like white head over a semi-opaque, dirty golden body. Plenty of effervescence. Decent lacing. 
Aromas are rich in ripe banana, clove-like phenols, wheaty yeast, and some coconut sweetness in the back.
Pretty smooth across the palate. Banana flavor comes through the strongest, with a nice balance of spices, light lemony tartness, and whole grain bread. 
Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with just a touch of carbonation - was hoping for a little more. 
Very easy drinking beer. Nice balance of flavors, and smooth Mouthfeel. Although this particular one seemed to lack some of the top-notch characteristics that I've come to enjoy in the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier. 766 charactersBeerImmediately, Aug 15, 2010

Pours the typical cloudy golden yellow and with a hell of a lot of head which recedes fairly quickly. A thin but formidable layer of bubbles lingers on the top for the duration of my drinking. Banana and clove as you would expect in the nose, but with a mild peppery spiciness. The taste is subdued. By that I mean it is much milder than other hefes. Not sweet, but rather light and finishes pretty clean. This makes this brew so very drinkable. Reminiscent of Live Oak. 504 charactersHoppyMcStout, Aug 14, 2010

Smell - 5.0 - hints of citrus with some nice spices and even a little bananna mixed in
Taste - 5.0 - Wonderful! It was sunny and in the mid-high 80's the day I tasted this beer and wow, was it refreshing. the perfect beer to sit and enjoy on a nice day
Mouthfeel - 5.0 - Very smooth with no bitter aftertaste. Every sip actually leaves you wanting to take another. 
Drinkability - 5.0 - Had I not had to leave shortly after trying this beer I probably would still be sipping on one right now. This is hands down the best Hefeweizen I have ever tried and is now my favorite beer.

A - It looks like Hefeweizen, what can I say? It has a hazy golden body, not quite turbid, with a large cap of foam that persists for quite some time.
S - Banana, clove, small melon, and pale malt (not sweet wheat?) are the staples of the aroma. It is not hugely complex or pungent, but it is well-balanced and easily accessible.
T - Pale malt first, banana nut bread, sweet in flavor profile, but not actually tremendously sweet. This beer is actually pretty simplistic. Though I love Weihenstephaner and it pains me to say it, there are much nicer Hefeweizens out there, such as Schneider Wiesen Edel-Weisse or my beloved New Glarus Dancing Man.
M - This beer is not as lively or as light-bodied as I would like.
D - Not on the level of some of the other offerings by said brewery. Still good. 880 charactersktrillionaire, Aug 10, 2010

4.11/5  rDev -6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a standard 22 oz Hefeweizen glass
A: Very carbonated. Foam starts coming out of the bottle after I open it. This beer pours a lovely orangish-yellow color. Perfect cloudiness. After I swirl the yeast in the bottle and pour it in, a healthy head sits on top. The carbonation feeds the head for some time. What I like the most about this beer is the beautiful, cloudy orange color. Text-book hefeweizen.
S: Cloves, banana, and some lemon rind characteristic in the nose. I do get hints of sulfur as well. Some breadiness from the yeast as well. Not terribly aromatic, but pretty good.
T: Banana and clove are definitely there. I get a touch more banana in this than in others in the style. The clove is present, but a little lighter. Lots of bready wheat character. A very slight hint of vanilla. I do get some bitter, lemon rind character in the end, along with a hint of sulfur. It doesn't make the beer bad, but knocks a few points off for me.
M: Light bodied. Crisp and highly carbonated on the tongue. The creamy head makes the beer seem thick and creamy at first, but in the end it finishes dry and crisp.
D: A really solid Hefeweizen. It really looks phenomenal. I will admit that I was expecting more out of the flavor and nose for this iconic beer. It may be that I didn't get a fresh one. I'll try it again, but will have to make sure I'm getting a fresher beer. 1,387 charactersbrewdoc75, Aug 08, 2010

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Not my first bottle of this, but figured I should get around to reviewing it. Have also had on tap in Munich FWIW.
I always get a huge head when I pour this beer. My beer fridge is set to the cold side, so perhaps that is the culprit. None the less once it subsides I get a nice little layer of snow white foam throughout the session. Color is hazy that is bright gold on the sides, and gets darker towards the center (since more light has to travel through it, it gets darker).
Anyways, I've never gotten much smell out of wheat beers. So not much was to be expected. I think I smell wheat, and a hint of cloves.
Now taste: It's gentle and refreshing. Nice Hint of bananas, cloves, a bit of wheat. This is what a hefeweissen should be. I've had countless bad American interpretations of wheat beers. Brewers tend to get banana happy, or clove happy, or citrus happy (in a wheat beer, really?).
Mouthfeel is great. Smooth and reasonably carbonated. The warmer the beer gets, the more the carbonation subsides.
I have not found any American brewers who can do a true to the style Hefeweissbier HALF as good as this. You morons hear me? Stop trying to reinvent the wheel. 1,174 charactersAWolfAtTheDoor, Aug 07, 2010

First review on my shiny new mac! 
Ahem...
I was excited when I poured this beer, when a beer is poured in a movie it looks like this. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier (wow, I'm not typing that again) pours a clear beautiful amber color, with two and a half fingers worth of head. There's some decent lacing as well. 
The smell of this beer is a wonderful concoction of wheat and banana, it smells a lot like banana nut bread. I like banana nut bread. 
The taste is actually a little lighter than I anticipated, sort of watery. There's some decent banana flavor in the beer and maybe a hint of clove. I like the flavor, it's nice and simple, but how is this the best in the world? It's an amazing session beer, but I don't see it beating Boulevard Wheat or Goose Island 312. It drinks easily and is very affordable, but so are those two I listed above. 896 charactersFernMaster, Aug 07, 2010

Pours a perfect cloudy yellow color with a huge creamy white head that throws off great lacing. Aroma is perfect with fantastic banana subtlties and lemon peel and melon rind. Has a touch of bubblegum on the aroma and it's so fresh smelling. The taste is perfect. Really has that wheat balance with the intense lemon and banana combo that leaves this the perfect hefeweizen. Also has a great mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation and really has a great aftertaste. Also I think this has a perfect drinkability as it's super refreshing and just perfect for hot weather. 610 charactersAugustiner719, Aug 07, 2010
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Beautiful aroma....sweet citrus and clove....strong and inviting. Appearance is, as one would guess, blonde and cloudy.
Very spritzy on the tongue...carbonation seems high. Indeed there is citrus apparent straight off, but it's more subdued than one may expect. However, there is a fair amount of spicy clove here which takes over almost immediately. A bit of smacking sweetness lingers around during and after the swallow. Quite clean in the aftertaste...not a lot remains.
Where some hefe's attempt to go overboard in their flavors, this one is a tad more restrained. It is a very drinkable beer and one I would definitely recommend. 637 charactersNODAK, Aug 05, 2010

t 3.5-4 bright, slightly sour. not a great deal of flavor. a little lemon, less banana, a tiny touch of baking soda (as i've noticed with past specimens as well) and metal. subtle and delicate are fine qualities, and i'd happily drink a bathtub of this while outside on a hot day, but i'm again having trouble finding the world-beating impressiveness. in fact, though i occassionally prefer quite a light style of beer, i'm finding myself wishing for significantly more taste from this vaunted wheat brew. (as a side note, wow the yeast really drops out of suspension quickly--five minutes and it's in a dense disc at the bottom of the glass!)
m 4 body is about medium with ample carbonation. not as silky smooth and finely bubbled as i was expecting (7 bridges brewpub managed more of that sort of texture), but certainly acceptable. a bit of swishing between the jowels brings out some creamyness. mouthfeel is probably the one department where weihen truly edges out the discoing dude. 
d 4-4.5 not my first time trying the king of the hefeweizens, and i am yet to be wowed. refreshing, good, and probably one of the 3 best hefes i've had (NG, Hacker, this--and i'm aware i may have overrated the Hacker and will have to retaste), but i can now go back to the wonderful 6.99/6-pack dancing man with no lingering thoughts that i'm settling.
[2015/2016 update.  go back to dancing man?  what was I thinking?  perceptions have changed on that one for me, due to its syrupy sourness.] 2,044 charactersbrewmudgeon, Aug 04, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Cloudy yellow fizzy beer. Huge head that quickly goes away
S - Spicy yeasty esters. Subtle fruity notes too
T - The first taste is just fizz. Nice mellow malt flavor with subtle fruity esters along with it. Not very hoppy at all. Personally I don't think that has much flavor. The malt taste is very pleasant. The barely flavor somewhat reminds of oatmeal. The yeast flavor is phenomenal. Its kind of sweet. Tastes almost like I'm drinking a sweet bread with slight banana added too it as well as cloves and other spices. Overall a very mellow taste. I would love to drink this with a meal. Does not leave a bad taste in you mouth at all. 
M - great mouthfeel
D - I could drink this forever 694 charactersVTaler, Aug 04, 2010

Poured into a 23oz. Weizen glass from a 500 ml bottle. 
A - Has a orange, blondish color to it that looks gorgeous in a Weizen glass. Pours a huge 3 finger head that retains well. Lacing sticks all over in the glass. 
S - Smells of cloves and bananas with, citrus and spice notes also present. 
T - Very refreshing citrus taste with banana and cloves following it. Hints of bubblegum on the back palate. 
M - Very smooth on the palate. No hop bitterness. Goes down really well on a hot summer day.
D - This is the most drinkable Hefe I have ever had. I have had quite a few and, none come close to the King of Hefeweizens . This is one of my all-time favorite beers. Outstanding. 745 charactersbluesfan1181, Aug 03, 2010

Nice smell of wheat, oats, honey, bit of banana, flowers, earthy hops. Flavor follows closely and is lovely. Texture is a bit firmer than I'd expect, with a crisp, biting carbonation. A good finish with clove and spices tantalizing the palate. Very refreshing and well done, though I like the dunkel more as I think it has a bit more personality. 406 charactersJEdmund, Aug 03, 2010

I have a soft-spot in my heart for Weissbier, as it is what introduced me to the world of beer. Weihenstephaner is a great one, but it isn't my favorite. It is a tad too banana-forward for me, but that's just my opinion. 
Still, few things in this world are as satisfying as cracking a 40-degree Weihenstephaner on a 95-degree day. 394 charactersDeutschesBier, Aug 03, 2010

Extremely drinkable.
This is THE Hefe-Weizen to be had. Highly recommended.

4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 500ml bottle into a standard weizen glass
A: Light golden color. Towering, frothy, white, 4-finger head. Very sparse, light carbonation rises throughout. Head 'collapses' slowly, leaving some sticky spider web lacing as it does. The result looks akin to a melting ice cream float. Head eventually settles to a half finger blanket of foam which never completely dissipates. Substantial beer ring lacing remains as you drink.
S: Light wheaty nose, strong yeasty tone, and some lemon citrus.
T: Very yeasty flavor. Really hearty wheat, much more so than a standard weizen. Lemon. Tastes like it smells.
M: Really light body. Kind of a steely feel. Yeast from start to finish. Coats the palette, and lingers.
D: Light and easy.
Atmosphere is very strong. Pure and regal appearance, and a very full, pervasive, floral nose. Much more intense flavor than the standard weizen. Similar in tone, just more of it. A bit of an offputting steely aftertaste. Overall though, this is a great quaff. 1,004 charactersbmwats, Jul 31, 2010

A - Hazy orange-gold with a HUGE fluffy head. Lovely. 
S - Clove and banana. This is a perfect example of what a Hefe should smell like, absolutely iconic and amazing.
T - Again, this beer sets the Hefeweizen bar. More banana, clove, lemon and a light cracker malt. Perfectly balanced with just the right amount of tangyness and bitterness.
M - Light, creamy, crisp and refreshing.
D - The perfect summer beer, I could drink this everyday from May to September. Bow down, all other Hefeweizens, this is your king! 583 charactersjsanford, Jul 29, 2010

S...similar to the taste, but more yeasty presence in the smell.

Looks amazing. 4 fingers of fluffly head lasts for minutes, receding to a beautiful lace. Color is orange, hazy, and has some brilliant gold highlights.
Smell is brilliant clove and banana. Just a classic yeast strain, and there's no doubt why. This is the beer that the word classic was created for. Nice wheat malt gives some wheat husk and mild sweetness to the nose as well.
Taste is out of this world. Since this is THE Hefe that all others strive to be, it's impossible to rate this anything but a 5. Tangy wheat crackers, ripe banana, clove, and lemon dance on the tongue. Bitterness is light then fades quickly. Slight tartness and lemon hints at the end.
Mouthfeel is light but luxurious. Creamy carbonation and clean finish.
Magnificant drinkability. The Babe Ruth of beer, this is an utter legend. I could enjoy this beer anytime, anywhere. Just a brilliant example of classic, time-tested techniques culminating in one of the few almost-perfect beers in the world. 1,065 charactersjampics2, Jul 23, 2010

Cloudy orange in color, with a creamy 4-finger head that lasts and lasts. Promising.
There's a bit of a spicy nose, thanks to the yeast, likely coriander. There's also a nice lemony aroma to it. Intriguing.
The taste - bready up front, with spice. I'm also getting banana flavoring, some lemon (not much), with a sweet finish. Fascinating.
From a standpoint of mouthfeel, I have to say that I'm enjoying this brew. It's downright tasty. 
Nicely drinkable German offering - I could have this one all night. I'm imagining schnitzel - yum. 574 charactersbogus564, Jul 22, 2010

Smells of banana yeast esters. Also has malted wheat aroma.
Tastes of wheat in flavor. Smells very similar to how it tastes, no surprises here. Soft dose of bitterness at the end. Smooth sip, very tasty beer.
ON A SIDE NOTE: I could use some more hops in my beer both in bitterness and aroma. Although I would agree this beer is ideal for mass appeal. This is the only reason this beer did not get a perfect score from me. I feel awful being so critical. But I like what I like.
Amazingly drinkable. Not watery, but feels as smooth as water on the tongue.
Thank You Germany. I feel blessed for having tasted your beer. 750 charactersmlazzaro, Jul 22, 2010

Pours hazy gold, big fluffy white head that stuck around...and around...and around. 
Amazing aroma of banana, but not overpowering. Definitely some hints of clove, vanilla and rose (or some other flower that I can't name).
Taste had a little vanilla and spice, and a really well rounded sweet finish.
Pretty light mouthfeel and lively fizz on the tongue, but this really accentuated the flavor.
Overall, this brew went down far too easily. Hands down the best hefeweizen I've had and glad I finally got around to trying it. 549 charactersChrisPro, Jul 21, 2010

A: Pours a huge, creamy white head above a very hazy marigold color. leaves arching in big fluffy lacing. a thick cap of foam remains above the beer all the way to the bottom.
S: delicate spiciness with aromas of orange peel, and banana pudding. also a hint of tannins
T: peppery, with flavors of orange peel and buttery toast, with a bitter saaz hop and woody flavor. finishes with banana, lemon meringue, and bitter and spicy lemon peel and grassy and haylike flavors
M: medium body with a very crisp and drying feel and a dry and dusty finish
Overall, this hefe makes a great thirst quencher after a long day at work. Very easy drinking and up there with the best examples of the style. 918 charactersOlRasputin989, Jul 21, 2010

Aroma: Big, bold aroma of wheat malt, some banana, a little bit of citrus/lemon, and a small spice note. A small yeasty note rounds it out. 
Taste: The front end starts off with a big mouthful of sweet wheaty goodness which gives way into a banana and a little bit of bubblegum sweetness, and then finishes up with hints of citrus and spice and no aftertaste. Not quite as bold as the smell would lead you to think, however. 
Mouthfeel: Light to medium, crisp, smooth, and with a fair bit of carbonation. 
Drinkability: One of the most drinkable beers I've had. Leaves you wanting another sip, and drinks very smoothly. 
Final Notes: I was hoping for a touch more flavor given the aroma, but it's very good and I'll be adding it to my regular rotation. Would make an excellent after-dinner beer or for refreshment after a hot day and you still want a lot of flavor. Highly recommended. 1,023 charactersbagpiper2005, Jul 20, 2010

Pours a cloudy bubbly body with an absolutely enormous head that dissipates very slowly. This beer must be unfilitered as there appears to be quite a bit of sediments.
Smell is very zesty with citrus and spices. Very nice.
Taste is very smooth and tasty, this beer is delicious. Lots of zesty spices balanced out with a smooth creaminess from the malts. This beer truly is world class.
Mouthfeel is creamy, full, and well carbonated. Such an amazing hefeweizen.

There is nice lacing as well for this one. It smells very light, with notes of yeast most prevalent, but banana character shines through as well. The taste is of banana with some spices (cloves maybe) coming through. The carbonation seems a bit too aggressive at times but overall done very well. This is by far the best example of a Hefeweizen i have ever had. 469 charactersAgold, Jul 15, 2010

T- Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall.

Just an enormous and fluffy head, well worth noting. The fact that it stays intact in spite of its seemingly fragile constitution is truly miraculous. The liquid is a cloudy deep straw color. I get mineral on the nose, mild dessert, and clove and herbal qualities. Very smooth texture. Taste is where the banana and golden plum characteristics come into the forefront. Smooth finish, with a nice touch of spiciness. Easily drinkable, and just an all-around excellent beer. 660 characterssixerofelixir, Jul 14, 2010

Appearance- A light straw color. Pours a very thick head. Lots and lots of carbonation with this one. You have to be careful pouring it or you're likely to get ridiculous amounts of head.
Smell- You get a light malt smell with a lot of banana and clove flavors coming through.
Taste- Just like the smell. Light malt flavor. Almost bready. But the real standout is the yeast esters. Beautiful banana and clove flavors coming through. The thing I really like about Weihenstepan is you get a lot of that banana like flavor where as most hefes it seems like the clove dominates. Perfect balance with the malt however. It's not like Well's banana bread beer. It's very subtle, delicate flavor. 
Mouthfeel- Very smooth. Feels very light in your mouth. It's nice.
Drinability- Absolutely no hang ups on this one. Goes down perfectly. I could drink these all day.
Weihenstephan is in my opinion is not only the best hefe you can find, but the best wheat beer as well. Just a beautiful beer. Definitely in my top 3 overall beers I've ever had. 1,115 charactersbriggssteel, Jul 09, 2010

S- banana and cloves...but the thing is, the scent isn't overwhelming like it can be in some hefes, and its not too muted like it can also be. Good blend of a lovely smell.
T- ohhh yes. Mild banana and clove flavor, with an extra bit of sweetness from the banana in there too...tastes awesome. I feel like theres some malt in there too...very interesting flavors. 
M- the feel is really good. Theres a real nice character to it...as I mentioned earlier, almost seems a little malty. Adds a lot to the body

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I had this beer on tap at Haus Murphy's in Glendale. I was intrigued because the server highly recommended it and told me it was the "original" German Hefeweizen. I found out the brewery's been around for almost a thousand years so they must be doing something right.
It had a thick, lacy head and a golden cloudy appearance. Smelled of pine, citrus, and cloves. The taste had the typical wheat, banana, clove, and lemon notes you would expect from a German Hefe, but they were remarkably balanced with an extremely clean finish. I think I detected a little bit of apple too (went great with the apple strudel). Mouthfeel was smooth and medium, nothing out of the ordinary. Drinkability was exceptional; I could sip this beer all day long. In fact, it's probably the most drinkable authentic Hefeweizen I've tried.
Verdict: A very good Hefe. For now, Paulaner is still my favorite, but Weihenstephan is a close second and I will certainly have it again soon. Plus, it's the perfect liquid companion for the brutal Arizona heat. 1,029 charactersShuffledaddy, Jul 06, 2010

Appearance: Very cloudy golden-orange color with a large white head that dissipates extremely slowly and leaves behind heavy lace.
Smell: Strong wheat and yeast smells, backed up by strong banana and clove. Some very slight citrus and grass aromas come through as well.
Taste: Wheaty beginning, with a sweet banana flavor, finishing bready and with hints of apple.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium body with light carbonation and a clean, refreshing finish that sticks a bit in the back of the throat.
Drinkability: This is the best hefeweizen I have tasted and it's rightfully the highest rated of its style on this site. Definitely worth a try and, if given the choice, I would drink this beer again without giving it a second thought. 804 charactersMosstrooper, Jul 06, 2010

Pours a darker pale orange color. Cloudy, with a white head. Not too big a head, but it might have been the pour. Great aroma of cloves, bananas, and bread. Similar flavors in the taste, and nicely balanced. Light- to medium-bodied and quite smooth, with some nice carbonation. Glad I finally got to try some of this!

Aroma: Bubblegum sweetness and banana with spiciness and cloves in the background
Taste/Mouthfeel: Sour and tart with a very large banana presence. The aftertaste is a little spicey and a lot sweet - kind of like some sort of spiced candy. No real malt or hops to mention. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and crisp. Super light also. 
Notes: I don't typically enjoy this style, but this isn't overly cloying or heavy, so I'm liking it a lot. It's certainly drinkable, I think you could easily put down a couple glasses of this. Nice and light, great for a summer afternoon. 721 charactersseh410, Jul 03, 2010

Good starting head that leaves no lace. But it does settle in a rocky fashion. There's a touch of cloudiness; the liquid is pale orange-gold.
Strong wheat aroma, but I also detect some buttery smells. The rest of the nose is tart citrus.
Lemony wheat flavor with no bitterness from hop or burnt grains. It has a good mouthfeel with very fine bubbles. There's a sweet finish with a short aftertaste. 556 characterssmcolw, Jul 03, 2010

M: light body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet, grainy, and crisp finish.
D: overall it drank very well and was good across the board and is a perfect example of the style. I'm glad I have access to it on a daily basis. 663 charactersGobzilla, Jul 02, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Saw this one on tap at a German food joint in Camdenton, Mo-- Der Essen Platz. I couldn't pass it up. It was served in a big old German stein instead of a Hefe glass...
This poured a very hazy, barely translucent, golden color. The color was a mix between burnt orange around the edges and the color of pyrite towards the center-- fill in the necessary gradient in between. The head, retention, and lace are all excellent per style. I wish they would have used a hefe glass to get a better look at this one, but it still looked great!
Smell is malty- sweet and spicy-- with notes of wheat and yeasty esters. Banana, clove, and a little bubblegum all take turns rocking out. All the flavors are there. Very tasty and surprisingly complex beer. The body is a bit over medium for the style-- but lots of carbonation make this really easy going down. I was amazed how truly enjoyable this beer was.
I normally avoid German beers, especially Hefes... This is one I am glad I ran into on tap!! If your on the fence about trying this beer, stop wasting time and try it! 1,065 charactersAleWatcher, Jul 02, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance -- Pours a hazy orange with two fingers of rocky, lily-white head that just won't leave.
Smell -- Yeasty, with notes of banana, bubblegum, lemon, and faint clove oil.
Taste -- Wheat graininess and an abundance of yeasty character and all that it brings: banana, clove, bubblegum. Malt is biscuity and dry, hop character is minimal, and when detectable add a spicy element. Finish is dry and crisp with lemon, bubblegum, earthy yeast, and a bit of clove.
Mouthfeel -- Medium in body, with moderate creamy carbonation. Feels velvety without being heavy. Finish is crisp.
Drinkability -- In the past I have typically shied away from wheat beers, especially hefes, but this beer makes me glad I took the effort to get over my wheat prejudice. World class for certain. Did I mention how incredibly refreshing it is??? 827 charactersyeahnatenelson, Jul 01, 2010

Pours hazy orange with a large white head. Leaves a ring and some spots of lacing and holds a light foamy head. 
Aroma is strong on fruit, banana particularly, some light citrus, clove, yeast. 
Flavor is fruity, starts somewhat sweet, a lot of banana, orange, some clove, finishes dry and a little chalky. 
Medium carbonation. 
Never been a fan of wheat beers and this does nothing to sway that opinion. I can see the attraction though, and how this would be a good example of the style. 541 characterselgiacomo, Jun 30, 2010

Wheat sweetness with a fair share of banana, a bit of clove and maybe a little pear. Earthy yeast character and loads of banana on the tastebuds. The mouthfeel of this beer is absolutely perfect. Super smooth and creamy with a clean finish. This is one that I'll be sure to come back to again and again. 385 charactersSurly87, Jun 27, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It greets with a cloudy, wheat coloured nectar topped with a creamy, luscious banana pulp head...absolutely one of the most inviting beers one could lay eyes on, none the less on a hot summers eve. Picture perfect.
Immediately you are overcome by immense banana fragrance, moments later cloves make their presence known and whatever other spice I might discern evaporates under the power of these two allies. First sip is just like first sent--- marvelous banana giving way to cloves in the middle. Finally a subtle hop nibbles on the ankles on the way down.
Creamy, yet dry and dispersant. It takes a bit to build layers of texture, then lingers. In the end, coated with the unmistakable wheat grain and banana creaminess, you can't help but pour another glass. Good thing it comes in + pints. 
This is as drinkable as beer gets, and one needs none other on a warm spring or hot summers day. Legendary beer. 911 charactersElDavicho, Jun 27, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I poured this 12 oz. bottle into a wheat beer glass.
A: Pours a lovely pale wheat color, and the head is thick, billowing, and long-lasting.
S: Lots of clove, banana, and bubble gum - exactly what I expect from a good Hefe, and also dry wheat, yeasty notes, and honey.
T: Bubble gum first, quickly followed by clove and banana, yeast, esters, just a whisper of hops, there is a harvest of wheat and yeast flavor in the middle along with a touch of honey and candied apricots, and the finish is gentle but long-lasting.
M: Exceptionally creamy, mouth-coating, and smooth going down.
D: There are no flaws with this beer. If there is a better Hefe out there, let me know about it! 683 charactersErish, Jun 26, 2010
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I was really looking forward to try the Weihenstephaner Hefe since a long time. Finally was able to land one at Pattaya. I pulled it out of the fridge at just about the right temperature, and as I began to pour the liquid gold my heart began to pump expectingly. It poured a beautiful hazy, but resplendent golden into the glass with a stiffly beaten meringuish, rocky head. The head was so stiff looking that if you just noticed that, it would pass of for a vacherin topping. Beneath the stiff and still head, the body was active with bubble jets rising everywhere. The combination and contrast of the body and head was breath taking !
I took a whiff, and it was all you would expect from a hefe - clovey spicy and fruity banana with notes of yeasty bread, raw wheat and citrus. You could smell each characteristic in isolation - such was the great balance in this brew.
As the head receded a little (just a little), I took a sip - and was hit by a wave of energy. The beer was bursting with the fruitiness of a banana, the heat of cloves and the sweet and citrus flavours of the wheat. The smell percolated itself beautifully in the taste. This was really what an ideal wheat beer should be like, near perfect. I had never tasted anything quite like it (in the world of wheat ales). It was amazingly refreshing and tasty. Moderate carbonation, medium bodied - was a pleasure to drink.
This probably would be my favourite session beer till now, very nice and easy going. Definitely the perfect summer beer.
Well, there are wheat beers and there is the Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. What a revelation !! 1,604 charactersBeerSingh, Jun 23, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5500 ml bottle poured into Weihenstephan world cup glass
A: Super frothy white head, like whipped cream topping, the taper and curve of the glass shows off the color spectrum nicely, goes from golden wheat through butterscotch all the way to orange, bubbles rise steadily and continue to increase density in the head, leaves chunks of lace all down the glass
S: As expected, very traditional, big big wheat notes, nicer than most, it lets the main ingredient shine, smells strongly of bananas especially at first pour, a yeastiness is mixed in with the wheat
T: Very smooth flavors, build from a mild wheat notes to full blown yeasty spiciness, the spiciness is definitely more present than in the smell, but its a yeastiness not a spice note, again a slight banana note is there in all that yeastiness 
M: Super smooth, but then a decent amount of carbonation is also present, when the carbonation hits it brings all the bright yeasty notes with it, keeps it light too, unlike others the carbonation doesn't hide flavors, it brings them out
D: Very high, there aren't any crazy flavors to deal with here, just deliciousness
Notes: I've been waiting to try this beer or a while. Even though I see it most times I'm at the store I just haven't gotten around to it. I was really in the mood for a Hefeweizen and I was not disappointed. It lived up to everything I expected of it. I don't think it is possible to be let down by this beer. It is the true German Hefeweizen. 1,474 charactersdpodratsky3, Jun 22, 2010

From Notes: Yes
A- Pours a hazy golden color with hints of orange. Has a nice sized off-white head that lasts for a good while. With good lacing.
S- Pretty much the epitome of hefeweizen. Has a nice light banana smell, with a good spiciness and clove. Along with a pleasant wheat aroma. 
T- Similar to smell. Has a nice front of wheat with hints of clove and spices. And a light banana flavor with a pleasant sweetness. Not as strong of flavor as the smell, but it is practically perfect, not to weak to be thin but enough flavor to be great. 
M- This beer is super smooth with a light fluffy and creaminess. Light - Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation.
D- Drinkability is amazing. I was almost done with my pint before I even realized it. I think this is probably the best hefeweizen I have ever had. This beer is so complex yet so simple and true to the style at the same time. I don't think you can find better. 1,039 charactersKrevee, Jun 22, 2010

12 oz. bottle, poured into a cervoise goblet.
Appearance: Lovely orange tinged straw colored beer with a nice looking initial head of fluffy white foam, great retention and great lacing.
Odor: Seamlessly integrated banana, apricot and clove phenols from the yeast, confectioners sugar from the malt.
Consistency: Light body, with a divine fluffy feel, bestowed by the gods of perfect carbonation. 
Flavor: Banana, doughy pils sweetness and semi-tangy wheat right from the rip, clove pokes in here and there, providing flavor and a bit of astringency/bitterness. Non-descript citric bitterness rides very low, into the crisp, clean finish, slight lemony hop linger.
This is the Abbey Road of beer, even if you do not like it, you must recognize the craftsmanship, science and artistry that went into perfecting every aspect of this it. 896 charactersWalken, Jun 21, 2010

Extremely hazy peach color, towering white head sticks around forever. Looks like perfection in the soccer weizen glass. Leaves lots of lacing everywhere.
Very fragrant scents of spice, fruit and yeast.
Fresh, excellent tastes of banana, vanilla, clove and wheat. Wheat and fruity yeast are especially good in the aftertaste. Very simple yet very complex. 
Mouthfeel is good but the carbonation is a bit spiky. Pretty usual for the style but if I have to knock this beer somewhere it's definitely the mouthfeel.
$3 a 500ml for near perfection, easily one of the best beers on this planet. Perfect for summer. Easily holds it's own in today's world of big beers. 779 charactersChico1985, Jun 20, 2010

Taste Malt, wheat, more of a lager than what american brewers make out as a hef, fruity with those very strong banana notes, grean bread, a bit of nuttyness. This is what a hef should really taste like.

A: Pours a slightly hazy straw color with an expected huge, dense, bright white head that took a while to reduce into a thick film that some sticky streaks of lace. 
S: Not overly sweet smelling. Light notes of bananas, earthy yeast and wheat. 
T: Rich spices and cloves hit the palate first, then melt into a light sweet fruity taste with notes of banana, lemon, and honeydew. Yeast and a dry grainy wheat flavor round out the finish along with a touch of bitter hops. 
M: Body was lighter and more dry than I was expecting. Mouthfeel is fuzzy with tingly soft carbonation, but not creamy. A dry bitterness lingers after you swallow.
D: Light, spicy, and easy to drink. Could have had a bit more flavor though, it's very light. This may not be my favorite style, but I've had my fair share of wheat beers and I wasn't that impressed by this one. Seemed pretty average. I guess it's not really a bad thing though that there isn't really anything wrong with this beer, it's just not that spectacular. 1,032 charactersscottfrie, Jun 18, 2010

Pours an extremely cloudy golden color, with some nice orange hues in the middle, very bright and inviting. Forms a two finger head of medium sized white bubbles. Head retention is ok and it eventually fades. Lively carbonation with moderate lacing. Just a few ticks away from perfect.
The smell is typical weizen, but with a potent spice. Some phenolic characteristics and a nice banana finish. Cloves are a little overbearing.
The taste is exceptional, period. This is benchmark weissbier that all bavarian beer fans must try. The flavors are so potent and delicious. I prefer a little sweeter on the tongue but I can't argue with quality. These guys know how to make beer, I guess that's why they have almost been around for a thousand years. A powerful clove with a nice mix of wheat and some sweetness at the end.
Mouthfeel is good, there is a nice light feel with a little carbonation to make it lively and refreshing. Fairly wet and a little clingy at the end.
Drinkability is certainly there, .5 L went down fast. As said in the taste review, the spices are a bit potent and I prefer sweeter, so it got a few points off because it wasn't as easy to drink as Paulaner.
Final thoughts: Drink this. I can't wait for the proper glassware to arrive! 1,356 charactersBranfordBound, Jun 13, 2010

A: Poured a hazy light orange color with a strong 2 fingers or more of foamy white head. Settles to a nice layer of foam. Wonderful amounts of lacing from start to finish. Beautiful Hef.
S: Wheaty, yeasty with slightly over ripe bananas, clove and a little spice.
T: Pretty solid hef here.... I'm not getting very much lemon or citrus notes... I'm getting bananas and clove with a wheat & yeasty aftertaste. Aftertaste is very clean.
M: Very Crisp & clean. 
D: Great Hef here, good ABV so it is very drinkable. It does lean on the banana side a little more than most Hefs I've had but this is not a bad thing at all.

Aroma is a little more tart than I remember it, plenty of spice (chiefly clove) and a vague fruitiness - nothing I'd call banana. There behind is a firm wheat aroma. Excellent.
Fantastic beer. The body is medium light but the flavor is full. the beer never seems stretched across the palate. Lively carbonation as expected. More clove, more wheat, no real fruitiness. towards the end of the glass I get an impression of cinnamon. Near perfect amounts of sweet, bitter, tart. No alcohol noted, no diacetyl or anything else that could be considered a flaw. Absurdly refreshing. I get that the style isn't for everyone, but I haven't found a better example.

Overall- for pretty much hating the clove taste or anything that reminds me of it this brew is what i would compare any other hefe's to. as a homebrewer i've used their (weihenstephaner) yeast and it's truely one of a kind. if it's hot outside or your a hophead like me who just wants a bit of change you have to surely give this one a try! 664 charactersclaminat420, Jun 01, 2010

A: Poured an amber/yellow color with a very large head that last a few minutes before it dissipated. A small head remained for the duration of the beer. There was some lacing, but it did not stay on the side of the glass. 
S: The aroma is yeasty and has a wheat component. I get some sort of fruit, but can't really place it. There is also some spice mixed in. Unfortunately, there was also a slight metallic smell as well. 
T: I found the taste to be relatively mild, with tastes of malt and barley and some lemon. The spice from the nose also comes through a little bit. 
D/M: This is where this beer shined for me, it was so easy to drink! I had no problem putting down this 16.9 oz beer. Its a great beer for spring/summer days and was a perfect beer for grilling. 818 charactersmdaschaf, May 31, 2010

It appears in my glass as the sun does when I gaze upon it, light orange and blurry, I believe I see spots. Carbonation, like solar storms, everpresent, never vulgar.
There are bananas. Oh, are there bananas. Are there bananas? Bananas and bread, definitely a yeast driven beverage, slight clove and wheaty bread presence. Playful and astute.
A smooth and easy delivery. It's like watching Jamie Moyer pitch. You have no idea how he gets it done, but he does and you are astounded. Wheat, then clove, followed by a long and delicate banana aftertaste, which lingers in the memory banks like a hilltop sunset, when the sky breaks for the last half hour, and magic is witnessed. 895 charactersolympuszymurgus, May 29, 2010

T- Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall.

Nose is sweet banana with a hint of the numbing cloves to come. May be the best nose ever, I wish I could do this in my homebrewed versions.
Flavor is hefe-heaven. Serious complexity that hits all the high points of the hefeweizen experience. Esters of banana, clove with cotton candy sweetness. Perfection by the world's oldest brewery.
Mouthfeel is light and quenching, serious sweetness that avoids any hint of cloying-ness.
Drinkability is tops. I love this beer! 595 charactersghostwalker, May 27, 2010

S - clove, banana, very slight spice...thats it. short and exactly how it should be. 
T - sweetly malted wheat, clove first, then the banana, belgian yeast, just a small kick of black pepper. finishes clean with a tad bit of lingering sweetness.
M - creamy, thick body but oily and goes down easy. carbonation is nicely subtle.

Pours a nice straw yellow with some orange hints to it. Large white head-at least 2 fingers-and then settles down a bit. Lacing stays throughout glass as it goes down. 
Smells really nice, textbook for what you would expect of this style. Wheat, yeast, and the banana and light spiciness (cardamom almost?) all combine together very well in a balanced mix. 
Tastes similar to how it smells, but definitely not as bold in flavor as I would have expected. Very nice balance again overall. 
Goes down easy with a light body, yet with plenty of flavor. Little carbonation and bubbles which is nice too. 
Overall, I would definitely drink another of these if I had it, but I only had one. I was expecting something a bit bolder for some reason, but this came across quite nice and I'm glad that I gave this classic a try. 881 charactersjspruit, May 26, 2010

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This pours a beautiful lemony yellow with a chill haze. The head rises to two fingers and falls back into splotches of off-white. Lace clings to the sides of the glass, but slides down quickly. The carbonation gives off a sizzle as it pours.
I smell the wheat and the yeast. There's the typical banana esters tempered by the grassiness of the wheat and a little touch of spice...maybe clove without the astringency.
Very mild in flavor...the smell is stronger than the taste...and slightly sweet, like a good honey-wheat bread. What you smelled is here to a lesser degree. No hops presence on the tongue.
Bright and crisp with a light body and good carbonation. 
A great example of the style with all the classic elements. A great beer to drink with lighter-flavored food on a summer's day. 794 charactersNaugros, May 26, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into Weiss glass. An accidentally over-aggressive pour gave this beer a very tall, fluffy, white head that had great retention and minimal lacing.
The aroma was the proto-typical banana, clove and yeast that defines the style. On the tongue, the above scents translated into flavors that were layered upon the solid, dry and crisp wheat taste.
The body was pleasantly full and tongue-coating, yet wasn't heavy or sticky. Drinkability was as good as it gets. Having multiples of these would be easy and a joy. This would also make a great beer to go with those summertime outside meals. Overall, this beer is a must try, and should be in your regular rotation. 668 charactersbeertunes, May 25, 2010

Brewer: Brauerei Weihenstephan. Freising, Germany 
Style: Hefeweizen
Glass: Weihenstephaner weizen glass 
Appearance:
Sparkling golden color with a frothy white head of 1". Lacing is moderate. It looks great, just not arrestingly spectacular. 
Aroma:
Godly malted wheat sweetness, flecked with mild spices, and streaked with aromatic ribbons of natural lemon.
Taste:
As soon as it hit my lips, I knew I would love it. Raw malted wheat and barley, gravely yeast, and hints of lemon pull together beautifully. Hints of clove and nutty flavors (almost like banana bread) coalesce just as the carbonation hits. Despite drinking other brews throughout the night, the taste stuck with me until the next morning (and that was a good thing). 
Mouthfeel:
Smooth, creamy, and a bit pepper. Drinking this is like quaffing ambrosia. Carbonation is peppy. Light-medium bodied.
Harmony:
Perfect harmony. The nutty, spicy flavors are perfectly complemented by the bite of lemon citrus and hearty wheat backbone. 
Served: On-tap at David Copperfield's 
Price: $7.00 1,123 charactersBeerNemesis, May 24, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured with a relatively moderate, white head that never really went away, with maybe a 1/2 finger remaining throughout the pint. The beer has a pale straw color with only a small hint of cloudiness. Carbonation attached to the side of the glass gave a very nice appearance.
I got a lot of typical wheatbeer aromas, with some bitterness. However, as the beer warmed, it developed a floral bent that eventually was realized in the taste. Top notch. 
All of the aromas are amazingly magnified on the palate. It's a very light beer that has layers that just keep evolving. Perhaps the best part is the hoppiness on the finish, which is mild enough to not overwhelm but is the perfect offset to the citrus and wheat up front. This has a different type of bitterness, almost like angostura bitters, and not like a lot of IPAs.
A real sipper for some reason. Pounding this one back just wasn't possible, not that I'd want to do that with a beer this good. Medium body. Would love to drink another. 994 charactersChizoad, May 23, 2010

11.2 oz. Served in a Pilsner flute. Ok, I've had this beer over a hundred times, way over due for a revue.
Appearance: Beautiful murky yellow/orange color, very good head with excellent lacing. 
Smell: First sweet and second spice third a mild hint of citrus. 
Taste: Yeasty, malted wheat and clove. So delicious, may not be the original Hefe Weissbier but may damn well be the best. Mild citrus notes come through in the finish.

Smells bready at first with hints of banana and clove but that turns in to a lot of banana and some clove as it warms. 
The banana comes through a little in the taste with some wheat tang and a little light malty sweetness. A lot of the flavors seem a little muted. Not sure if this is because of the trip to me or if this is just the beer.
The mouth feel is a bit thin at first but kind of filmy coating your mouth in the finish.
this was a very refreshing beer and was perfect for the nice warm midday. 591 charactersJoePat, May 22, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A pour into my Duvel tulip yields a beer with an attractive murky orange tint and an absolutely massive white cap with some staying power. The only thing keeping it from a perfect score is that it's a little light on lacing for the style. The nose has a wheat malt base and the clove really outshines the banana hear in terms of yeast byproducts. The taste reveals a little more balance between the two, banana up front melding with the creamy vanilla flavor I find wheat imparts on a beer, and then clove kicks in at the end. There's a good amount of carbonation present, as I would expect, and a certain richness to the beer that I credit at least in part to the wheat. As with any good hefe, this beer is very smooth and eminently drinkable, I plan on making it a regular staple for the next few months. 806 charactersaxeman9182, May 22, 2010

A High carbonation that will spew if you're not careful. I wanted a nice thick head so I poured a little more aggressively than most beers. That is not necessary. As predicted, the head was quite thick and lasted for the whole glass, covering the beer at all times. A nice golden straw color, appropriately cloudy for a Hefe. A really greatlooking beer! To me, it couldn't look much better, I graded it a 5.
S Malt, banana and a little estery aroma. It just smells great, so typical of a German Hefe.
T Malty, balanced by hops without being bitter. Most bitterness is from the CO2. Very clean with no lingering off-flavors.
M Has a thickness and fullness from the wheat. Full body and rich. Like comfort food, this beer is comfort beer.
D One of the best Hefeweizens anywhere. Quite good, and definitely recommend. 860 charactersboss302, May 20, 2010

Appearance: Pours a hazy light orange color with a ton of carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. The head is massive and foamy and dissipates slowly leaving considerable lacing on the glass. Beautiful.
Smell: Wheaty and yeasty with hints of fruitiness and spice.
Taste: Now this is a hefeweizen! Yeasty up front with strong lemon notes. Develops into a sweet, malty flavor with strong fruity flavors in the background. Spicy notes (cloves?) come out in the end as well. Leaves a pleasant lemony aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Crisp, clean, and refreshing.
Drinkability: Perhaps a little over-hyped, but not by much. This has been called the standard for hefeweizens and now I know why. An absolute dream to drink on a warm day. The only thing that would make it better would be having it in Bavaria itself. One of these days... 889 characterswahhmaster, May 15, 2010

This beer wanted to get out of the bottle, evidence from foam creeping out of the top of the bottle once opened. The pour is golden yellow with one and a half finger fluffy white head.
There is a substantial spice to the smell...coriander and clove. I'm also getting a lot of wheat, yeast, orange, and some banana.
I saw the good ratings on this beer and am pleasantly surprised with the taste. I am getting a lot of wheat, banana, and yeast up front finishing with orange zest and a bit of spice. Very refreshing.
The mouthfeel is thin and effervescent with a mild creaminess and a clean finish.
This is a very drinkable beer simply put. 662 charactersTCgoalie, May 15, 2010

TEMP: Cellared @ approx 55 degrees, then fridge cooled for approx 15 minutes
This pours a clear, golden orange color.It easily produces four-fingers of thick, craggy, foam which is eggshell colored. The retention is fantastic and the lacing is in slightly sticky strands.
Tons of big, beautiful, yeast notes emenate from this glass. A huge presence of corriandor brings along a touch of orange zest with it. Big presence of bananas and wheat. 
This smells delicious!
Massive amount of wheat flavor, but it's blended so nicely with all of the fruity and spicey notes that it's just delicious. Lots of bananas and a good amount of oranges and even some lemons. Corriandor notes mix with some mild spices and a good level of yeastiness. Almost bready.
This is what a hefeweizen should taste like.
Almost full-bodied and it has a mild-to-medium level of carbonation. It is extremely smooth, but is lacking in the area of creaminess.
At only 5.40%abv, and that's nowhere to be found, this is a super drinkable beer. Great flavor and very refreshing. This will be a great summer drink and a fantastic drink for fall and/or spring. 1,163 characterscoldmeat23, May 13, 2010

Very strong aroma of bananas, yeasty spice, clove, wheat, a bit of pepper and some ripe fruits...complex and nice...
Very clean tasting, subtle banana flavor, less spice on the tongue as there was in the nose. Strong wheat character (duh) with an earthy/herbal finish. Not normally a fan of Hefes as I usually find them to have a bit too much spice, this one was great!
Medium bodied, looks like it would carry more substance than it actually does. Light and very easy to drink, good carbonation and just an overall pleasant drinking experience...

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My first review!
The Pour: Poured smoothly from the bottle. Left a 1.5" head that was firm and creamy. Left a small amount of lace as it went away.
Appearance: Beautiful Golden color. Like a wheat field at harvest. Fairly clear, just a slight haze.
Smell: Very Aromatic with a bouquet of banana. Smelled a lot like Banana's Foster! Hints of spice as well. 
Taste: This does not have the lemony citrus that many wheat beers have. It is a crisp well structured taste. The malts come thru nicely. Minimal hop bitterness. This beer begs to be drank on a hot summer day lounging on the deck!
Mouthfeel: Crisp and refreshing. A very fine carbonation.
Drinkability: Yes, I am gonna go get another!
I am not a huge fan of wheat beers. Bought this one on the recomendation from my local beer store. I do not care for the lemon and big citrus. This one is very well balanced, though. It will retain a spot in the "beer fridge", especially in the summer. 950 charactersTripleTap, May 11, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A foamy white head erupts from the hazy golden body upon the initial pour and hangs tight for quite some time while leaving a sticky lacing in its wake.
Massive aromas of banana and clove waft from the glass as well as wheat and spice. The traditional phenols and esters are very apparent and well balanced. As the beer warms, the wheat and yeast becomes more pronounced.
The palate is very similar to the nose. The clove and banana are well balanced with the wheat. These characteristics are not quite as intense as in the aroma, but still provide all of the flavor one can handle.
Medium to light in body with high carbonation with a refreshing zest for the palate.
This is a benchmark for the style with amazing flavor and aroma characteristics, great balance, and just altogether enjoyable. A real winner! 813 charactersCHADMC3, May 10, 2010

A: It has a nice color, somewhere between orange/gold/yellow on the color wheel, with a certain cloudiness to it, not sure that shows up on the color wheel, however. The head was tremendous. I poured it into a new Duvel snifter, amazing white, with great retention.
S: I smell really good spices, plus some exotic fruits.
T: Wow, you have a good wheat taste, with some citrus notes playing along, I also pick up a slight taste of the exotic fruits in the nose. This is a real hefe.
M/D: It has good carbonation, and is very drinkable. Guess that's what you get for perfecting a beer, and being around for the last 970 years. 698 characterskylehayworth, May 01, 2010

Glug glug glug
The flavor is full bodied and just complex enough. The familiar banana flavor with some clove present as well. The body is full and smooth. An excellent wheat beer, nothing stands out while at the same time I can taste everything I expect and the flavor and body are surprisingly non watery, very full and authentic tasting beer. 615 charactersThur123, May 01, 2010

The nose is quite big and packed with strong yeasty notes and wheat malt. The banana and cloves are quite dominant as well. Very clean 
The taste is bananas and wheat. The cloves and yeast notes are definately there, but are more subdued. This is really a beautiful hefe, a perfect example of the style. Medium bodied and average carbination, creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable. 527 charactersCBlack85, Apr 30, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Good looking wheat beer. Not much head retention, which is the downside. It's a nice orange color, and very foggy as well.
Smell: I smell lemon, pepper, and maybe even a bit of of cinnamon or cloves similar beers. Very crisp, refreshing smell. Definite thumbs up.
Taste/Mouthfeel: I was initially kind of disappointed with this. Kind of a spicy lemony taste, with some bitter hops. The hops leave a somewhat pleasant tart aftertaste. Again, I did not necessarily like this at first, but the beer changes complexity as it warms, making the hops very nice. Starchy, banana-nut-like taste comes out towards the end.
Drinkability: The complexity of this makes Weihenstephaner pleasant to drink. One of the best!
Overall: Similar to Hacker-Pschorr in appearance and taste, but shares some similarities to witbiers in the latter category. Not as nice in appearance, nor as strong in smell, even though I kind of like this smell better. Taste and feel are about the same. The added hops and lack of any potential overwhelming characteristics makes this great! 1,068 characterstjsdomer2, Apr 27, 2010

Appearance: Pours a huge white head that takes awhile to settle down to pour out the rest of the bottle into the glass. Persistent lacing as I drink it down. Beer is a hazy/cloudy yellow-orange light amber color. The classic Hefe look.
Smell: Earthy yeast with hints of banana and clove. 
Taste: Very refreshing. Raw grain flavors followed by yeast, some banana again, just a hint of metallic, and a crisp finish. 
Mouthfeel: Just a hint of carbonation on the tongue, otherwise goes down nice and easy and coats the whole throat. No lingering aftertaste or feeling on the teeth and palate. Cleansing in a good way. 
Drinkability: I think I've been corrupted by so many Russian Imperial Stouts over the past month (moving from my winter stash into spring) and this great beer I loved so much is, well, still very drinkable, but not the wow experience it once was. Still, I know if it was warmer today I'd be loving this beer more. Goes fantastic with a meal or by itself at the end of a long day. Despite me being a tad underwhelmed in some cases, I know I could easily have another of these. 1,189 charactersdamndirtyape, Apr 25, 2010

Lovely clouded orange-gold with a massive meringue head, great retention, massive lacing. Bright lively natural carbonation.

The fluffy and foamy topper takes quite awhile to dissipate. At first the lacing is frothy and sticky, but as the beer goes down, it becomes fine and dotty. 
S: There is a lot of clove and banana in the bouquet, supported by smaller hints of apple, pepper, pear, white grape, and maybe just a hint of creamy vanilla. Yeah, there is a lot going on here. A small sniff of yeast is also present. 
T: A very sweet, full wheat flavor is the first impression on my palate. There is a nice yeast balance to the sweet fruity and spiciness, followed by a light sour taste on my tongue. The fruity esters and the peppery spice are definitely the dominant flavors, though. 
M: There is a very creamy feel while the head is still on top of the body, which quickly transitions to a puckering, spicy feel which is just a bit watery. 
D: This is a very pleasant drinker; it would be quite easy to session this beer. It has a light, crisp, tasty character that I will certainly be revisiting in the future. And the price tag is quite kind, to boot. 1,118 charactersTCHopCraver, Apr 19, 2010

Smells like classic hefe, but like getting a banana bunch shoved up your nasal passages. Clove too. (They all should smell this good)
Taste is a beautiful malty blend with an ever so slight peppery taste, Powerful carbonation that flows through every aspect of the beer. Long finish. My words are not doing this beer justice.

Mouthfeel is probably one of the best things about this beer. Nearly perfect balance--a small amount of carbonation but it is perfect for the taste and experience. I would have rated this as all "5s" but I prefer a little more fruit in my hefeweizens. The clove taste is a little strong for me. That's just a personal preference though. Would try again. Due to major clove taste, it's not as drinkable as some other hefeweizens. 675 charactersZekezilla, Apr 18, 2010

This is my favorite hefe to date. It seems lighter bodied than most of the other German hefes and is more like the American style hefe's I have had (ie Sierra Nevada's Killerweiss). It tastes great!

Poured into a tulip pint: Cloudy, translucent straw with a finger of frothy white head. Attractive.
Smell of lemon, overripe banana, bubblegum sweetness.
The notes in the smell carry through into the taste with a dry middle & a tart finish. There's a quality here that I've picked up in a lot of wheats that's reminiscent of root beer, a very "round" kind of sweetness. Wish I could articulate this better.
Very tingly & active, light & very refreshing.
This is a good beer, even though I'm drinking it in the wrong context -- I feel like I should be in a vernal beer garden, or at the very least outside, instead of in a dark-ish bar watching golf. Still, this is a winner, for sure. Seems like the shortest review I've written, but this one hits all the right spots for a high-quality hefeweizen. 878 charactersOneDropSoup, Apr 11, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Picked up a six pack in Korea courtesy of the Army Post Exchange. Poured it into a pilsner glass since my Weizen Glass is 1/2 liter and it just doesn't look good 1/4 empty... Poured a magnificent head, probably did need the Weizen glass just for that...and it had a nice golden cloudy appearance one would expect from a fine Hefe. The smell is floral and fruity and the taste is wheaty and fruity (but not sick fruity, if you know what I mean). Anyway, this beer has a great mouthfeel and is extremely drinkable. Perhaps I should buy an extra six pack for the spring. Nice. 573 charactersjhtipton, Apr 10, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been looking for this one for a while. Glad to find it at the LCBO. Weihenstephaner pours with a beautiful initial head, receding to a solid finger of bright-white, meringue-looking foam. The body is perfectly hazy and a glowing golden-straw colour. Retention and lacing could be better...but I guess my glass could have been a little cleaner as well...
The nose shows all the hallmarks of a great hefe. Astringent yeast, citrus-like acidity, coriander, light clove, wheat, delicate sweet malt and balanced noble hops. Maybe even a slight smokiness. I only wish the nose was even stronger. 
This is easily the best hefeweizen I've ever had, and I've sampled quite a few. No competition here, this one wins (sorry, Dennison's). Explosive flavour; this is everything I've always wanted a hefeweizen to be all in one bottle. I've tasted all the individual elements in other hefes, but never all together in one beer like this. All the others are missing one thing or another in comparison. Wheat, astringent yeast, light citrus, sweet banana, soft spices (including a touch of white pepper). Perfectly balanced. No alcohol. Lingering fruity finish, balanced with wheat and a light hop bitterness. 
The feel is wicked, the best hefe feel I've found. For a relatively light beer, the body is thick and full. A lively carbonation plays well in the mouth with the fruit and spice flavours. 
Amazing. One of the most drinkable liquids I've ever tasted. I can't believe I didn't check this out earlier. All hefes will now pale in comparison to this ridiculously high standard. This will definitely be my summer beer as long as the LCBO keeps it in stock. I could drink this all day long and not get tired of it. I can see how this stuff has been kicking around for a thousand-or-so years... 1,790 characterseat, Apr 10, 2010
3.59/5  rDev -18.4%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a glass.
A: A cloudy yellow with a thick, white moussy head. 
S: A much more subdued version of the taste. 
T: Bubble gum notes coming from the blending of the phenolic and fruity esters. Phenols are not spicy or overtly clovey. The banana notes are present but subdued. 
M: A soft mouthfeel with good carbonation tingle. Not as effervescent as I would hope from a hefeweizen. 
Notes: According to Charlie from Five Points, this is the best hefeweizen in the world. It is good, to be sure, but there should have been more effevescent. Refreshing none the less. 584 characterskevinjosephlee, Apr 09, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy orangish yellow, nice bubbly head with amazing retention. Smells of floral grassiness, clove, some banana . Tastes of sweet banana like malt with just a touch of clove on the backburner. Nice banana bread richness without being too overwhelming. Very moderate bitterness leads to soft clove notes along with some residual vanilla and brown sugar. Nice creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation to bring it to life. 
A really great beer, nice bold flavors and a nice subtle sweetness that works wonderfully with everything. One of the greats. 574 charactersbum732, Apr 07, 2010
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Soft cloudy orange with gold edges and a robust (2 finger) pure white head, very dense and full. Lovely.
The smell has cold squeezed orange juice, apple skin, a hint of ginger and bananas aplenty. It's a bit muted but nice, especially as the beer sits for a bit and you get hints of honey and the aroma of Arrow Root biscuits (!). 
The taste is excellent, very balanced and able to show off all kinds of nuances. It's got the necessary wheaty/bready backbone with a light clove and yeast spiciness. There's a twang of lemon (none of that sticking a wedge into your pint like they sometimes do at the bar!) and a long banana-focused finish. It is right on the button for a wheat style.
Mouthfeel is equally balanced and beautifully textured, somewhat creamy and soft to start and then intensely crisp, dry and tart in the middle and the finish. Fantastic.
This is very refreshing stuff, but the alcohol presence is still notable. 932 charactersstrangemusic, Apr 07, 2010

Cloudy gold with a typical two finger fluffy white hefe head. Nice
retention, but no stick.
Aroma of fresh ripe bananas, banana bread, cracker like wheat/malt,
clove, tangy lemon. This is the standard for all other hefeweizens.
Spot-on perfect.
Lots of bananarama going on. Citrus, lemon, clove, spicey wheat, whole
wheat crackers, a bit of malt sweetness.
Body is light to medium with a big brisk cola-like carbonation.
Yes indeed. This is 'the' hefeweizen that all others tremble before.
So immensely quaffable and flavorful, this beer has the perfect
balance. 625 charactersFlashsp2, Apr 06, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Textbook hefeweizen.
Smell - Sweet and fruity. Decent strength to the aroma.
Taste - Starts fruity, ends wheaty as it should. Tastes very similar to the other sweeter authentic hefes. Perhaps a touch less sweetness and cleaner finish than the others. Alcohol slightly detectable.
Mouthfeel - Very crisp and clean. I'd personally prefer a touch less carbonation though.
Drinkability - This is very good. I am finishing up my rotation of authentic german hefe's with this beer and looking back, they are all quite similar with slightly different personalities. There were both sweeter and more bitter ones. This one doesn't have a hop presence and has only the slightest hint of bitterness, and its not as sweet as some of the other ones. Overall its agreeable but not my favorite of the bunch. 809 charactersNA1NSXR, Apr 04, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is far and above the best Hefe-Weizen beer I have drank in the United States, and probably the best one ever. I will admit I have a particular favortism towards the Hef brew, and this one is the king of them all. It pours a beautiful dark yellow, and has a rich smell of banana and cloves with some spices. The taste is perfect, it has a rich Hefe-Weizen taste without being too light. It is extremely smooth and goes down pleasantly while leaving a satisfying after taste that allows the drinker to remember exactly how the beer tasted. My opinion says best beer i have ever had! 585 charactersSuperdaunte, Apr 02, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served from a 12 oz brown bottle. "Oldest Brewery in The World." Freshness date on back of label.
Appearance: Hazy yellowish orange colour, like the flesh of an apricot. Dense, bubbly head that retains for a while.
Smell: Sweet and fruity, banana being the most easily recognized fruity aroma. A kind of mild, savory smell like bread dough is present, I'm guessing from yeast. Maybe a bit of faint spice.
Taste: Malty upfront with some fruity character. Alcohol is noticeable. It seems like there are some faint citrusy qualities. Ends fairly dry with a combination of mild citrus hops and semi-bitter yeast. That yeast on the finish, although not very sharp, is definitely strongly flavored.
Mouthfeel: Crisp, pretty high level of carbonation. Fairly light body, but strongly flavored enough to be substantial. 
Notes: A pretty damn good brew. I'm not a huge fan of wheat beers, but this one is impressive. I get the feeling this would be a great thirst quenching beer for the hottest days of summer. 
Additionally, I hesitate to mention this, but I have tried this beer several times on different occasions just to make sure. I've noticed that after drinking this beer I will soon have a sore throat and raspy voice. It lasts for several hours and then subsides. This has never occurred with any other beers, so I'm not sure what could be causing it. I'm just throwing it out there. To be fair, this brew is good enough that these mysterious symptoms don't usually dissuade me from having one. 1,501 charactersirisier, Mar 31, 2010

A mix of banana, bread, and cloves. Taste mimicked the aroma. It tasted like banana bread with a little bit of malty-ness to it as it went down. Good amount of body and carbonation. Definitely my favorite Hefeweizen yet. 327 charactersEvocatus, Mar 29, 2010

Tastes of sweet fruit and orange zest. Very much like great Hefeweizen I have had.
Mouth. A good bit of carbonation and kinda thin. Very easy to drink.

A- Pours a hazy orange/tan, with a huge white head. Like a lemon merange pie. 
S- Mostly ripe banana, but also some clove, pepper and biscuit. The initial aroma of ripe banana is terrific.
T- Sweet banana, but not cloyingly so. The citrus notes come through the sweetness and offset it nicely. Notes of clove and pepper. Overall this really comes together in a well balanced manner, each flavor component complements the others. This is not a "hop forward" or a "malt forward" beer, but rather a very well balanced beer.
M- Crisp, well carbonated, smooth, light mouthfeel, easy drinking.
D- I am really enjoying this beer. There are other styles I prefer to hefeweizen, but if I want to drink a wheat beer, this is the one I would choose. Well balanced, refreshing, easy drinking; this is the perfect summertime beer. 872 charactersblackdog1101, Mar 29, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512 oz bottle, poured into a weizen glass.
Slow, careful pour with a swirl at the end produces a beautiful looking hazed and slightly cloudy golden orange color. A steady stream of bubbles support a massive, frothy white head that hangs around for the duration of the beer and occasionally leaves a streak of dry lacing. Aroma is spot on for this style, nothing unexpected. Strong notes of wheat, malt, yeast, banana, clove, vanilla and mild citrus. Medium thick body with light carbonation produces a smooth full mouthfeel. Flavor is initially banana sweet and fruity. Mid palate some light hops cut the sweetness and add a lemony citrus balance to the flavor. Finish has nice duration, fairly slick and mildly sweet. Really, not much else you can say about this beer other than it's a near perfect example of the style. 821 charactersyourefragile, Mar 28, 2010

Smell had mostly malt and some spice, hard to identify but a little sharp maybe. This tasted great, really good balance of malt, carbonation, didn't really get the wheat specifically but there is some complexity to the grain bill here, some roastyness. Very flavorfull mid alcohol beer. 336 characterskpoole25, Mar 28, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 512oz bottle poured into a Pils glass.
Golden glowing body with yeasty turbidity and a beautiful, mousse-like white head that lifts an inch out of the glass.
Perfect balance of banana and clove on the nose with a backing vanilla note. Bready wheat peaks out from behind the great yeast profile.
Malt becomes more prominent on the palate with tangy wheat and lightly sweet Pils malt providing a canvas for the classic banana and clove character of the Weihenstephan yeast. Again, hints of vanilla and nutmeg add depth.
A world class beer to be sure and the standard of the style. I could drink it all day. I just wish it was more reliably fresh in the States. 661 charactersbump8628, Mar 27, 2010

A: Honestly, it doesn't look like much. A dull golden colour with a few bubbles drifting to the top. Almost two fingers of head which dissipated quickly.
S: Wheat and something else...maybe clove? A very delicate nose.
T: This tastes very good. The tastes differs from the smell, at least to my mind. Fruity, with cloves, wheat, and malt not far behind.
M: Very nice. Enough carbonation for refreshment, not too much to detract from the beer itself.
D: I would drink this beer as long as it was continuing to be served to me. I find myself wanting to take another sip even before I've completely finished the current one. Recommended.
I think this beer is overrated, but that's not to say it's not good. It *is*. But it is somehow too solid to stick out in my mind. It does everything well, but nothing especially memorable. Still, if you have the chance, try one! 922 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 25, 2010

A: Pours with a huge 3 fingers of white fluffy nearly rocky head. Body is full of medium bubbles and is a light orange golden/bronze color. Very nice looking!
S: Light citrus and sweet whole wheat bread, strong yeast notes and some dry spiciness as well.
T: Full, clean, balanced and clear- this is a flavor by which others can be judged. Bready malts permeate the entire flavor, and form the foundation on which orange, yeasty coriander, floral spices, wheat malt, a slight hint of lime, honey, and (did I mention malt?) dance and shimmer. So full I could nearly mistake this for a biere de garde. 
M: Sweet and light but not "empty" as some hefe's can be. This pours into the mouth like crystal water and refreshes like happy nectar. Carbonation is lifts the tastes where it should, but is not over-done. That isn't an easy balance to achieve.
D: One of the most drinkable beers you may ever find.
Overall: The top rated session beer in the world according to popular consent by BA's. If you love this style, you no doubt will love this beer. It is excellent. 1,093 charactersallforbetterbeer, Mar 23, 2010

It's become my go to beer after a tough evening of sports as it's incredibly quaffable. So I was quite happy to see the regular Hefeweiss on the shelves and give it a go.
It poured *beautifully*. A golden cloudy golden hue with a big poofy wipped egg white head that stuck around for a while. Excellent stuff. The smell is big on this one. Banana, cloves and fruit are prominent and the taste has even more volume. Loads of fruit, bananas, melons and god knows what else. It's enjoyable and like their dunkel it swims down your throat. Drinkability is high thanks to a near perfect mouthfeel.
My only slight complaint is that this beer is fairly sweet. There are moments when I think it's too sweet for my tastes. 787 charactersRalphus, Mar 18, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Pretty unrelated to the actual appearance to the beer, but I really like how the bottle looks and I like the cap also. It'll make a nice addition to my collection. Hazy golden orange color. Huge creamy 3 finger head. Bubbles are cascading up heavily so this beer should have some high carbonation. Head dissipated rather quickly and left no lacing at all.
S - The smell is powerful with citrus. Orange to be a bit more specific. Coriander is also present in the smell. I also smell hints of banana and spice. Kind of a bready smell. A really nice smell, minus the spice which I'm not huge on.
T - Mmmm, Banana and citrus dominate the taste. Hardly any of that spice I smelled actually made it's way to the tastebuds which I'm happy about. The sweet banana/citrus taste goes away very quickly and leaves a bitter taste in the back although that goes away as quickly as the sweet taste. Little to no aftertaste is left behind which is no problem to much, just makes me want more.
M - I felt it would be a little bit more carbonated than it was due to all the bubbles. Don't get me wrong this is a highly carbonated beer, but I thought it would be to the point where it was almost like a Pepsi or something. Medium-bodied which I wasn't expecting due to the minimal lacing/head. I figured this beer would be almost watery.
D - Very drinkable beer. More of a summer beer than anything. Still great at any time of year though. Definitely would recommend this to friends. 1,473 charactersepicness, Mar 18, 2010

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.520oz pint, on-tap at BeerBistro - an awesome find on the last leg of a multi-year business trip to T-dot.
This beer appears a cloudy, pale golden yellow hue, with two fingers of tightly foamy and somewhat creamy dirty white head, which leaves a slightly pocked, but otherwise sheer veil of painted lace around the glass in its lazy-ass wake. 
It smells quite pleasantly of the usual suspects - banana chips, semi-sweet clove, subtle yeast, and breakfast cereal wheat grain. The taste is rather sweet wheaty and grainy malt, bruised banana, middling clove, and a bit of yeast. So simple, and yet so perfect. 
The carbonation is equitably moderate in its subtle frothiness, the body duly smooth, fruity, and a stoic medium weight, all in approachable measures. It finishes off-dry, clean, and redolent of all things just mentioned, in equitable doses.
Quite a refreshing, agreeable quaff - all the typical points are hit here, sturdily, yet not over the top, I might add, resulting in a very enjoyable and drinkable progenitor of the style.  This shows the rest of the world how it can be done, even if no one else has a thousand or so years of experience under their belt (yet).  Oh, and please don’t add that ubiquitous slice of citrus fruit – it just overpowers the gentle aromas and flavours that have worked so hard to get to you. 1,341 charactersbiboergosum, Mar 13, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice cloudy, dark orange-yellow. Nice 3-finger head with good retention, but not a lot of lacing. Can see a bit of carbonation coming up, but not much. Looks pretty damn good.
Smells very nice - typical hefe flavors, but done right. Estery banana, a bit of citrus and quite a bit of wheat. Taste pretty much follows from the smell - quite wheaty, but the banana is definitely there. Tastes pretty much like you'd expect a hefeweizen to taste, but it's just so well balanced - banana is the most recognizable fruit here, but the wheat also really adds a whole lot. A bit of orangey flavors come out near the end - very mild hops to balance it out. Excellent taste.
The mouthfeel is a tad too carbonated for my tastes, but still great. Leaves a wheat flavor in your mouth - delish. Extremely drinkable, could easily have a few of these on a sunny day, but it really could be adapted to pretty much any situation. In the UK, widely available and at a very reasonable price, possibly one of the easiest to obtain world-class beers. Do not miss out on this one. 1,066 charactersmike130, Mar 13, 2010

Purchased at Parti-Pak liquors in Indianapolis, IN. 
A: Very hazy straw-gold. Almost honey-like in color and haze. Tons of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. White creamy head, about 2 and a half fingers high. Good retention and easily stirred back up with a swirl.
A: Sweet bread-like smell. Reminds me of cake or cookies. A nice hint of flowers, citrus, coriander as well. 
T: Sweet, lemony/citrusy, coriander, sweet wheat flavor. Lots of goodness here. Mild bitterness in back but very little aftertaste.
M: Mid-bodied (much heavier than I expected, but surprisingly good). Smooth and effervescent. The carbonation is great. 
D: Extremely drinkable. I could see myself drinking this all summer long.
I am just venturing out of my favorite territories (stouts and IPA's) so I don't have a great deal to compare this with but a trusted friend told me it was the best specimen of the breed, and I'm inclined to believe him. 1,002 charactersRayenK, Mar 12, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a great looking hazy golden straw color with about a finger and a half worth of head. The head recedes slowly leaving minimal lacing on the side of the glass but leaves a nice cap on the beer the whole time.
S- A nice array of yeast with some wheat and some coriander in there also. There also a little bit of orange and some lemon in there as well. A very good smelling beer.
T- The wheat is pretty prevalent to go along with a little spice and some coriander. A little yeast on the tail end adds a nice smooth touch of sweetness to it. This is one refreshing beer that is very well balanced .
M- Smooth. The carbonation adds a nice spriteness to it that would make this perfect for a warm summer day. It almost has a creamy texture to it that makes it a solid medium body.
D- The flavors are pronounced but not overpowering. The smooth texture makes this beer go down very easy. Try this if you get a chance and you won't be disappointed. Great for summer or on any occasion for easy sipping. 1,007 charactersWisconsinality, Mar 12, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a Harpoon weizen glass. Nice, thick, foamy white head on top of a cloudy orange-wheat body. Some lacing left behind.
Orange citrus, mixed with wheat and sweet malts on the nose. Coriander and some spicier hops come through as well. Very refreshing. Orange peels.
The flavor starts off with a nice wave of juicy oranges, followed by somewhat peppery hops and spice. Sweet malts linger in the background. Reminds me a bit of a lighter orange sherbet. Some nuttiness as well and at times slightly bitter like an orange peel. 
Mouthfeel is pretty good. This beer has a decent body, but is a bit overcarbonated in my opinion. Spices and hops add some peppery qualities to the body.
Drinkability is also good. Low ABV and lots of flavor make this a very enjoyable beer to drink. The orangy sweetness and carbonation cut down on the drinkability a little bit for me. But overall, it is easy to finish a bottle of this.
In short, this is a pretty awesome Hefe, probably the best I have ever had. Lots of flavor and a strong aroma. Looks great too. Nothing is really mind blowing, but the beer is well crafted and a great example of the style. I'll definitely have to pick up a few more of these for the Summer. 1,219 characterssisuspeed, Mar 08, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a weizen glass, revealing hazy golden body with lively bubbling into a tall white head. Some lacing. Very pretty. Smells sweet like hayfields and wild honey with a little breadiness, almost like a saison.
Tastes light and well-carbonated with a delicate sweetness. Nice smooth wheat flavor comes through, with a hint of citrus and a gentle cleansing bitterness right at the end. Carbonation is a little more tingly than creamy, otherwise it's quite refreshing. Light-bodied with a smooth, watery mouthfeel. Totally drinkable.
If I could pick a session beer to enjoy exclusively in the summer for the rest of my life, this might be the one. The saison-like fragrant character really melts my heart. This is the best hefeweizen I've had yet. 753 charactersabuliarose, Mar 08, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a weissen glass. 
Appearance: Pours a very pale yellow that is very hazy for how light the color is. It's crowned by a massive four-finger head that takes an eternity to dissipate. 
Smell: The nose is not as powerful as one might expect, but it has all the standard hefeweizen characteristics to it. There is the traditional strain of yeast along with clove, some spices and a very pleasant scent of banana. 
Taste: What a fantastic beer. This is, for me, the epitome of the style. It's got everything you'd want in a hefe, the perfect strain of yeast, the clove, the dry spiciness and of course the signature banana character. It's not hugely bold, but at 5.4% ABV, you can't expect too much more out of a brew. 
Mouthfeel: Adequate mouthfeel to this one. It's a little bit on the thinner side of things since it's so highly carbonated, but I have no complaints. 
Drinkability: This is very drinkable beer, especially in the summer months. It's light-bodied, low in ABV and very tasty, all of which make for a great session brew. 
Overall, this is an excellent beer and a terrific example of the style. The flavors are so wonderfully wrapped together this one. This would make a great session beer during the summer and a pleasure to drink anytime. 1,288 characterszoso493, Mar 07, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: A thoroughly hazy golden-amber body that 's full of chunky particles. Up top, over three fingers of creamy whitish head that fade slowly and leave patchy lacing.
Aroma: Bananas, golden fruit, wheaty malt, mild spice, and just a hint of something a little sour.
Flavor: Up front, a traditional mix of cloves and banana-like yeast with some mild bitterness. Underneath, a toasty and wheat-like malt backbone keeps the traditional flavors coming. Everything is balanced well, with no aspect dominating. Cereal-grain malt and golden fruit in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy with smooth medium carbonation. Crisp and somewhat drying in the finish.
Drinkability: Highly drinkable, this would be a welcome summer refresher.
Verdict: Here we have a solid Hefeweizen--it's simple and highly drinkable yet never boring. I personally prefer Paulaner's version of the style, but this is still a very solid start for someone ready to dive into German Hefeweizens. 983 charactersBeanBone, Mar 04, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516.9 oz brown bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner Weizen glass
Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier poured a cloudy red-gold color and produced a firm, big pure white head. Aroma is mostly of banana, and yeast with a hint of lemon. Taste is more of the same with a touch of cloves and mild spice finishing refreshing and flavorful. Mouth feel is slick, smooth and especially creamy with just the right amount of carbonation.
Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier is one well built Hefeweizen from the World's Oldest Brewery. It sure lives up to its reputation - What a session beer! 572 charactersbushbeer75, Mar 01, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured out a rich copper-gold-orange into my Schneider Weisse glass. Huge, fluffy white head on top that faded out to foam and film. Holding it up to the light, I can still barely see the silhouette of my hand behind it. Hard to knock this beer's appearance, it's almost picture-perfect. If the head had stuck around a bit longer, I would have given it a 5.
The nose is a big, musty-floral brush stroke. Orange zest and lemons hang out after the main flower scents fade. It's rich and complex. The taste follows form -- complex citrus and floral flavors in front of the musty malt-hop background. Rich and deeply flavorful.
The mouthfeel is hefeweiss-perfect: thick without being chewy, carbonated just enough to avoid a harshness on the tongue. One of the best mouthfeels of any non-stout I've ever had. And the drinkability goes up because of it -- it's such a pleasure to drink such a tasty, almost-creamy brew. One of the best beers I've ever had. 953 charactersocmpoma, Mar 01, 2010

Cloudy, smells like bananas, tastes like bananas, zippo aftertase. Big head. It costs $33/case here in Eastern PA, $31 for Corona, need I say more? You can get a four pack with one of those hugh, proper hef glasses for $16. Probably the best value in beerdom for the money by far.... 381 charactersgloriousglo2, Feb 28, 2010

Smell: Nutty scent with sweet aromas like vanilla and citrus like orange.
Taste: So smooth and refreshing. The nutty flavors are interacting with the yeast and I can taste spices like cumin. Unlike others I've tried, the taste isn't overpowering and is more refreshing with a nice blend.
Mouthfeel: Light body and dissipates quickly. Taste lingers in the mouth but not in a bad way.
Drinkability: Hefeweizens are always a tricky style of beer and this one just nails it. Where as others can become too much, this one is light, refreshing and a great blend of flavors. Can drink a few in a night and is really top notch. 732 charactersNezzy, Feb 26, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A-cloudy golden yellow color with a thin pure white head. It is bubbly but lingers for quite some time. It has some stickiness as it dissipates clinging to the glass
S-the nose is quite robust and brings a lot of spicy clove up front, banana and bubblegum come in next with a nice compliment of bitter lemon.
T-the taste is pretty solid, there is less clove but still some spiciness from it that sticks throughout the beer. The banana becomes quite present and lingers a little. Some sweet esters and sour lemon rind round off the finish.
M-very smooth and creamy on the palate. Lighter body but very firm and highly carbonated but not burning. Crisp finish with a lingering sour lemon that doesn't want to quit but keeps the sweetness as it does.
D-easy drinking and great feel. Big flavors but a little lingering sour funk towards the finish. 848 characterscpetrone84, Feb 26, 2010
4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Being admittedly a bit biased towards hefe, this is my all-time favorite brew. The lightness and crispness of it are second to none and the delicate balance of flavors are solidly pleasant time and again. I find myself coming back to this one, and still enjoying it like it was my first glass...
But onto why it's so good:
When pouring, the head bubbles out its golden body like a dream - it puffs and sticks to the side of the glass just full of creamy goodness. As it expands it sends out aromas of citrus, spice, and wheat; a slightly yeasty ether suspending it above the glass with an inviting, nearly nostalgic sensibility.
Upon drinking, one is greeted with a number of interesting tastes, mixed together as if by time itself to a delicate equilibrium - classic yet somehow striking in their balance. It's as if the flavors themselves have met in this place to remind you of the very roots of beer itself... Yet, throughout their visit they maintain a unique and distinctive character, wrapped as they are in gentle, fruity overtones, delicate spices, and their very own signature style and flavorings of wheat. 
What follows after that first distinctive sip is a crisp sweetness, both refreshing and enjoyable themselves. A twinge bitterness bites casually through, hearkening back to its noble hefe roots - a reminder of just how far beer has come though both its glorious and inglorious past. The beer itself is almost honeyed, I might say, and, despite its crispness, the aftertaste also bears something of that honey stickiness just the same.
Let it settle a moment longer and another prominent aftertaste will come to light - a remarkable wheatiness which, like fresh-baked bread, will hover on your tongue before beckoning soon after for yet another delicious sip. 
And so, refreshed as you are and with fond memories of your previous acquaintance in-mind, you're all but helpless to accept its generous offer... to once again enjoy the delicious musings of the many flavors in this wisened, olden brew as they amble agreeably, yet ever-so-slightly down the rings you draw upon the glass...
This is truly a Hefe for the ages... 2,146 charactersUSSRNUKE9, Feb 25, 2010

No freshness date
A: High carbonation elicited a 4-finger pearl white head on a slow pour. Retention was phenomenal with spotty white lace down the glass with the head eventually reducing to 1.5 fingers. Color was a hazy orange straw.
S: Wheat, coriander and citrus on the nose with nice fresh grassy hop.
T: Orange and lemon citrus with tons of wheat malt and grain. A sweet and floral hop finish but very light with very little residual bitterness. Characteristic wheat sweetness and some banana taste. Overall the flavor was crisp and clean.
M: Well carbonated which completed a well rounded mouth feel with the thickness of the wheat coating the palate.
D: Light and flavorful of low to medium body. A great beer for any time of the year.
This beer is true to style and a great example of it. It's my go to recommendation for Hefe's. 866 charactersBehindtheFinBrew, Feb 24, 2010
4.01/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer is really good for its style, but I'm learning that hefeweizen is not really my favorite. So, I've rated this as high as I can for any hefeweizen. It pours a nice opaque blonde with a really nice substantial white head, it sticks to the glass. The smell was a little subdued imo. I did pick up some floral notes with a bit of banana as others have mentioned. The taste is a bit of clover spice, that turns into a bubblegum banana like flavor. The final after taste is a bit of yeast and sweet bread. Not really much in the way of hoppy bitterness. It seemed to me that there was quite a bit of carbonation in my mouth, a bit more than I prefer. But again, this is definitely the best hefeweizen that I've had. If you like wheat beers then this is an absolute must. 774 charactersIloverasputin, Feb 22, 2010

The aroma is banana, clove, yeast, bublegum, and lemon. The taste is much the same with banana, clove, and spices. This is a nice, flavorful hefeweizen as comparred to some of the flavorless ones I've had recently. It's a nice beer but not my favorite style.

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very hazy almost opaque hue of burnt orange with two fingers of creamy white head that displays good retention and leaves some decent lace. Cloudy lines of fine sediment slowly float just below the head.
Bubblegum, honey, ripe banana, clove, and bready yeast in the nose.
The sweet notes of banana and bubblegum are perfectly balanced with a good dose of bready yeast which is cut into by a more subtle lemony twang, all coming to an end with bread and a faint honey sweetness at the back of the palate.
Mouthfeel is light but creamy and highly, highly refreshing; perfect for the season of summer.
This hefe embodies what a hefe should be: tasty, creamy, light, and refreshing. You can't ask for much more from this style. A must for hefe and beer lovers alike. 774 charactersludachris, Feb 21, 2010

This is a wonderful hefeweizen with great balance. Flavor is a nice mix of sweet wheaty malt, honey sweetness, apple, some citrus, banana and some pepper. There is also plenty of clove, but it's not overwhelming. Next to no bitterness or hop flavor, but not much should be expected with a beer of this style. Mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy with a great finish that leaves a banana like sweetness in my mouth. I could drink quite a few of these on a hot summer day on the deck. A very well brewed beer. 609 characterszoso1967, Feb 17, 2010

S - Malted wheat giving a bread/cracker smell. A little apple and citrus smell, with loads of banana smell. Some spiced, mostly clove and a little pepper, scent too.
T - Really nice flavors in this beer. The base is a creamy malted wheat that gives it a cracker/bread type of flavor. Loads of banana and bubblegum mixed in with that, also some spice (clove, pepper). A little hint of citrus lemon flavor at the end.
M - Incredibly smooth and creamy. Medium body and somewhat crisp. Medium carbonation.
D - Incredibly drinkable. Creamy smooth body allows it to go down easy and the flavors a very tasty but don't overload your palate.

There's a malty, bready sweet aroma as well. Taste is earthy banana, bubblegum, and spice as well as a slight touch of lemon. Very smooth with a nice dry finish. Maybe I was hoping for too much from this considering the hype I've heard, but this one let me down a touch. I know I'm in the minority, but I personally prefer Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse to this.

A: Pours a transparent and VERY pale straw color. Slightly clouded. The head is small and pure white, retaining for only a little.
S: Fruity and delicious nose; cantaloupe, banana, and mild clove. Wheaty and spicy in general.
T: So simple, yet so delicious. Very light and mellow, but powerful flavor. Melons, banana, cloves, coriander and other spices. Very slight hop flavors at the end, but definitely not bitter or even very noticeable 
MF/D: Very light in body, lingering banana finish.

Mouthfeel- A simple sized mouth. Great for drinking.
Drinkability- It's an incredible beer. I've had the worst beers, but this is one of the best I've ever had. I drank it faster than a coors light, which is literally water. I can't believe this taste.

Appearance - Hazy golden orange. Extremely opaque for a beer of this color. Big two finger head slowly dissipates into a nice white lacing. Nice stained glass effect on the glass after each sip. 
Aroma - Big bananna notes from the yeast upfront. A slight note of biscuit from the malt is also present. Not much hop presence at all. 
Taste - Big, sweet ripe bananna upfront. Clove also there in full force. Some citrus cuts the sweetness nicely. Clean, slighty bready finish.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with a ton of carbonation provides a nice crisp bite throughout. 
Drinkability - Relatively low ABV and huge, clean flavor make this exceptionally drinkable. Absolutely sessionable.
Overall, the best hefeweizen I have ever tasted. Big bananna and clove notes, along with a nice finish, highlight this great brew. A must, plain and simple. 939 charactersGosox8787, Feb 11, 2010

4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A- Pours a beautiful deep golden color, with massive carbonation erupting from below. Big three finger head, thick, white and rocky and with lovely lacing. Beautiful hefe, absolute perfection.
S- Slight and subtle scents; earthy grains, bittered cloves, sweet farm grass, a very faint fishy aroma from the yeast I'm assuming, overripe bananas, fresh cut spring flowers. I wish the smell was a bit more assertive, it's hard to pull out the multiple complexities with such a faint aroma.
T- Such a balanced beer, between the wheat malts and the subdued hops, this beer rides the perfect line down the middle, not leaning too far either way. Delicate tastes of sweetness and minor bitternes.
M- Perfectly smooth with slight ending carbonation. Excellent coating.
D- For a hefe, it's true German construction makes it less ideal for drinking at a beer festival, and more for contemplative sipping on a porch. Tasty and smooth, this is a great hefe. 948 charactersSamN, Feb 06, 2010

S: Malty wheat with lots of yeast. Hints of banana and clove, with a smaller citrus hint. 
T: Crisp wheat front goes to a banana and clove center as the carbonation blossoms leading to a dry, mildly bitter finish. Exactly the way a Hefeweizen should taste.

A: The pour is murky pale orange with a large white creamy head that slowly dissipates to rich lacings.
S: Wheat in great balance with the malt. Very obvious bananas (sweet and ripe) and a hint of coriander. A bit yeast is also present.
T: Ripe bananas, a bit less sweet compared to the smell - but this is not a bad thing. Some coriander and a bit of fruityness as well. Well-balanced wheat. 
M: The body is light with rich carbonation. The aftertaste is rather short, but very dry. 
D: This is a great exampel of a Hefeweissbier (Hefeweizen) from Bavaria. You'll probably will have to spend half a lifetime to get your hands on a better Hefeweizen than this one. 822 charactersEvil_Pidde, Jan 29, 2010

Pours cloudy orange with yellow highlights and a thick, foamy white head. Lots of carbonation and lots of wispy yeast haze.
Smells of a nice mix of banana and coriander spice. Some orange zest as well. There is also a good bit of earthy yeast aroma and some wheaty malt present.
A lot of banana at the forefront with some coriander there. A very earthy or musty flavor from the yeast, which complements the fruitiness well. A bit sweet and wheat-like flavors throughout. Finishes a little drier with a good yeasty aftertaste.
Medium body with a crisp effervescence, which lightens the feel a little but not too much. This is a classic hefeweizen with a great balance of flavors and body. I like that it wasn't all fruity banana, but that the yeast added a lot of earthy flavors to it. 831 charactersgoldbot, Jan 29, 2010

F: Pretty dry to finish but not too dry, a light lingering wheat flavor and some lingering hints of juicy banana flavors. No spices here either, and hints of bitterness. This is about as good as a Bavarian Hefe can get! 751 charactersjlindros, Jan 27, 2010

Drinkability: This is the bench mark for the style for me. The spicing and carbonation are perfect. Although not my favorite style, this is an excellent beer. I could easily finish three-and for the price around here, will pick it up again. 457 characterstigg924, Jan 27, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a murky, light honey-wheat color with pale yellow highlights. A little sediment and some very lively carbonation running around in the glass, but all of these features pale in comparison to the head. Even on a soft pour, I got over three fingers of white, creamy, frothy head that has ridiculously long retention and leaves very nice rings of lacing around the glass. Maybe too much head?
The aroma is pretty strong (likely helped by the large head), but it's good. I can pick out banana, clove, citrus, and grainy, bready malts. 
The flavor is good, but not absolutely stellar. Nice solid banana and clove flavor, as in the nose, followed by a sweet, bready maltiness and a drying, citrusy finish. Very tasty, but not the best damn thing I've ever tasted. 
The mouthfeel is a little thin, but otherwise good. The light carbonation works well with the dry finish to provide a zesty feel on your tongue. 
In all, this is a very good beer with high drinkability for most, but I don't personally want to drink more than one bottle of this at a time, but that's mainly because I'd rather be drinking IPAs than wheat beers; it's personal preference. For some, the drinkability is through the roof, for me it's so so. Either way, this is a stellar wheat beer, probably my favorite of the style, even if the style isn't my favorite. 1,335 charactersfeelmefoam, Jan 27, 2010

This beer has a white two to three finger head that lasts forever and a yellow cloudy color. The beer smells of clove, banana, wheat and yeast. The beer tastes of clove, wheat, and mild citrus, and has a light hop aftertaste. This beer has a nice amount of lacing. This beer is super refreshing, crisp, and a perfect session beer. I have had this beer on-tap and in the bottle either way it is awesome. Drinking this beer makes me want to go on another vacation to germany. This is one of my favorite beers of all time.

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5An easy to obtain world class hefeweizen, sure why not.
A: This beer is certainly unfiltered and has a golden dilute grapefruit juice color to it. The head on this beer is massive and consequently upon opening the beer was met with a gusher. The head is very cheese cloth like and the lacing is deserving of a compliment. 
S: The smell if the defining of a hefeweizen. Bananas, clove, and hints of citrus.
T: The taste is a creamy banana an clove. It's a youthful taste that is fresh and has a fair amount of zest and dryness in the finish that would indicate the hops are doing their job. The finish incorporates a kind of perfectly balanced chalky sweetness that leaves you wanting more. It's strange to think that my first "real" beer experiences were with German beers as I was an exchange student in high school and naturally rose as a natural opportunist to be able to legally drink beer at the age of 17. 
M: This beer is extremely creamy and is quintessential of the style. Slides down the tongue nicely.
D: This beer is rather affordable, definitely real affordable in it's motherland (Deutschland). A great summer beer and a prime example of German brewing excellence. 1,183 charactersMPLS, Jan 20, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Poured from the bottle into a weizen glass. It pours a beautiful golden straw color with a good four inches of thinly bubbled white head. This remained for a while before it started dying down.
Aroma: Everything you expect from a good hefeweizen: cloves, citrus, banana, wheat. They are are all very well balanced with each other.
Taste: Exactly the same as it smells, a great example of a hefe. The cloves come up front followed by the banana and bubblegum, following again with more clove.
Mouthfeel: Very light and crisp with almost no aftertaste. It hits every part of the tongue with something different.
Drinkable: This is very drinkable and would make a great intro to the world of craft beer. 716 charactersProbie, Jan 20, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5500 ml bottle, bought it for 2 bucks. Pretty happy my local store has plenty of these. 
Beautiful golden could, so gorgeous. The lights in my apartment make it glisten in my weiss glass. 
The smell - everything you expect a hefe to be and more. Bananas, cloves, orange, even wheat - all wafting into your nostrils.
It was the smoothest, most beautiful hefe imaginable. This brewery sure knows how to bring out all the flavors without being overpowering in any way. This beer plain out made me feel peaceful just with that first sip, not to mention after 3 bottles. 567 charactersGroenebeor, Jan 19, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a beautiful frosty yellow-orange with a tall, tightly bubbled head billowing from the top of the weizen glass. This particular weizen smells, as per the style, of clovey notes as well as those of orange peels, coriander, and other citruses. The taste is right on the nose for a hefeweizen. Almost no hop presence in the taste, and a perfect balance between the fruity and citrusy flavors and the slightly sweet alcohol tastes. The Weihenstephaner is wonderfully smooth to the palate and incredibly drinkable, with it's perfectly grainy medium body and mild abv. 567 charactersMrHassellYaHurd, Jan 17, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a weizen glass. Very cloudy orange amber fluid with a massive frothy foamy white head on top of it which lasted til the last drop. 
Most hefeweizens smell reasonably similar to me. Pleasant banana and clove smells are present as I expected though I found a stronger more substantial sweet yeasty malt smell than I am used to for the style. Very appetizing on this hot day. 
Has a very earthy grain taste followed by a lingering hit of clove spiciness and citric tartness. Rounded off with a nutty yeast flavour. All these flavours balance together exceptionally well. The nuttiness doesn't linger allowing the spiciness and the citrus tones to keep the mouth dry and refreshed and wanting more.
Smooth, good carbonation, good medium to full body. As mentioned earlier this is refreshingly dry.
All I can really say is this is probably the best hefeweizen I can get my hands on here, and I love hefeweizens in the summertime. Refreshing, tasty, thirst quenching and satisfying. 992 charactersStavage, Jan 17, 2010
3.64/5  rDev -17.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: Poured with a solid two thumbs of head that retained and laced like crazy. The beer itself is a cloudy dark yellow, just as you would expect to be with great signs of carbonation. Nothing to complain about here.
Smell: A bit tame to be honest, as clear wheat and biscuit smells with only the barest hint of banana and lemon. It's nice but needs a bit more of a punch.
Taste: Tastes well made, and is pretty much a textbook hefe taste but it just seems a little lacking. Starts with a lemon tasting wheat malt that shifts to a slight banana flavor and ends with a taste of odd yeast. Good but nothing to write home about, as it needs more banana.
Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, and decent transitioning but the funky biscuit and yeast aftertaste at the end doesn't quite sit right. Thankfully it does not stay around for very long, which is good.
Drinkability: No issues getting it down, but seems to sit a bit heavy on the gut. Refreshing I suppose, and a great summer beer, but not one I'd drink all night. I honestly expected it to be a bit sweeter.
Final Thoughts: Really, I feel this beer seems to be a bit tame for a Hefe. It still is a decently made beer, but I wouldn't call it exceptional. I think the yeast needs to be changed up a little bit, because the cloves and banana you'd expect from this style don't seem to make enough of a presence to suit my tastes. Still, I'd recommend picking up a bottle. 1,427 charactersTheHammer, Jan 16, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sometimes I think when you've had one beer of a certain style, you've had them all. That can be said, to a degree, with Hefes. The best ones, though, will be just a cut above the rest for other intangibles besides taste. 
A: Liquid beauty poured out of a bottle. Cloudy orange gold with a massive, bright white head that leaves crazy lacing. 
S: Faint hint of - you guessed it - banana, phenols, and biscuits.
T: Starts off with a lemony/wheat kick then goes immediately to the banana aftertaste along with a funky yeast and biscuit aftertaste. Remarkable to say the least.
M: Highly carbonated and creamy. Somewhat oily on the palate, but nicely balanced. 
D: An excellent summer and spring thirst quencher. Though, I'm drinking it in the midst of winter, I'll have to remember this one for the spring months to come. 823 charactersirishking1977, Jan 15, 2010
3.83/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Well finally, a decent hefe, even though it ain't my style. This one looks vibrant yellow and even a little orange, uber cloudy. Aroma, citrus and lemon, wheatgrass type of vibe. 
More of the same in taste, a big full mouthfeel of said aroma, but also, resonates as a more full bodied beer than your standard hefe. Quite drinkable, although these usually don't come cheap. Worth picking up for a friend who likes hefe. 419 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jan 14, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The quintessential Hefeweiss readily available outside of Germany.
On tap at the Spinnerstown Hotel.
This is one of the few perfect examples of a beer style. Everything is in place from the hazy gold-amber color and thick head to the banana and clove aroma characteristic of the german wheat style.
Sweet but not cloying: just a slight bitterness and balanced fruity component. Sweetness that seems completely grainy and natural blends with a vague tartness at the back of the throat.
The feel is creamy and smooth, allowing the beer to be drunk with exceptional ease. 
A potential desert island beer if you want something inviting yet refreshing that seems to nearly perfectly balance every beer characteristic. 717 charactersMinotaur, Jan 14, 2010

The flavor is more of the same with banana being stronger than the clove, but both are present and work well together. Medium carbonation and a thin-medium mouthfeel. 265 charactersMora2000, Jan 14, 2010
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on NYE 2009
A: The beer is approriately cloudy with a one finger head after it poured big into a tulip (no hefe glass at mom's house). Head what bright white.
S: Super Banana smell, very strong, just a mild clove smell but really smelled like a banana smoothie.
T: The taste is pretty much the same as the smell. No hops, no alcohol, none of the "beery" taste of some more industrialized Hefe's. I would like a little more complexity though.
M: Very creamy, lots of texture, low carbonation despite the huge head.
D: Extremely, no wonder these are so popular in Bavaria. 584 charactersmdwalsh, Jan 14, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured from a fresh 12oz bottle into my Weihenstephan Weizen glass (purchased before I was a fan FYI). Pours a hazy golden amber color that gets clearer towards the bottom of the glass. A massive five finger head was produced on a slow pour which dissipates into a 1-2 finger head in a couple of minutes leaving a lot of lacing. The head remains at 1-finger for the rest of the beer. The head is not as creamy or volumetric as the Hacker-Pschorr weisse. This beer is not opaque enough for the style.
S: Aromas of malt, banana, clove, cherry, pears, and finally an acidic kick are most noticeable. A hint of yeasty bread-like aroma comes through. Quite pleasant to smell and improves over time. More aromatic than many other versions of the style.
T: Slightly tart and very malty. A sweet sensation is perfectly balanced by mildly bitter hops and eugenol (clove-like) spiciness. Taste has a little more hop character than I've seen in other weisses. The banana and fruit-like flavors are playing back up compared to other beers I've had of this style, but I am enjoying the intense malty yet spicy character of this beer. To sum up the flavor of this beer: malty with a crisp drying finish, hoppy-bitter for the style, mildly spicy, tart, and complex for the style. There is a yeasty element to the flavor profile as well. I would like to see more yeasty banana flavors.
Overall nice and hearty.
M: Perhaps a little under-carbonated (probably due to my pour). The mouthfeel is not as starchy and lacks the body that other beers I've had of this style, but this beer is definitely not watery. EDIT: Poured slower and did not experience the under-carbonation effect, but I still feel the body of this beer lacks something.
D: Scarily high. I finished my serving half way through writing this review (~3 minutes). I want another.
O: Not the best tasting hefe I've ever had but it may just be the most complex and most interesting I've ever had. I must admit I was dissappointed as I thought this beer would be much better than the hefe from both Hacker-Pschorr and Franziskaner, and I feel it is better, but these beers are all in the same league -and that means they all happen to be great beers. 
Maybe it has to due with freshness, but my favorite hefe remains the summer seasonal brewed by Grizzly Peak Brewing Company in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
EDIT: After having this beer many times, I have determined that the appearance is not as good as other weisse beers of this style (reduced from 5 to 4), yet the smell and mouthfeel are better than I originally observed in my initial review. I have also sub combed to the clove dominate and hoppy flavor, this is my favorite bottled hefe that I've had so far as well as the best "clove dominate" hefe that I've ever had. 2,771 charactersicetraxx, Jan 11, 2010

Pours 3 fingers of creamy white head. Very great retention leaving some thick lace. Color is a golden sunset orange. Lots of carbonation bubbles in the glass. It doesn't get much better than this.
Aroma: A very nice amount of banana and cloves. Very sweet smelling. Some wheat as well. There isn't too much going on here, but what is here is very great. Lots of flavor here.
Taste: Not as much flavor here as the aroma, but pretty solid. Bananas and cloves present again with some spices as well. A big wheat flavor which was no surprise. 
Mouthfeel: Crisp and smooth. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Ends a little dry with spice notes.
Overall, I was pretty impressed with this beer. I can imagine it being even better in the summer. Very solid for the style. I really enjoyed this and it was very drinkable. 867 charactersmothman, Jan 09, 2010

Aroma of phenols and clove, some doughey yeast notes.
Flavors of subtle bready malt with notes of honey, yeast and phenols. Notes of clove and banana and mild citrus, a fine spice lingers. Well balanced flavors.

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I must say, this has been my favorite beer for about two years now.
Long before joining beer advocate.
A- To me, this is how beer should look, particularly hefeweizen style. Orangish golden hues with obvious carbonation.
S- Again, what a bouquet. And, important to note it's not about a smell of alcohol and nothing that remotely makes you want to stop smelling it.
T- Perfection, to me, as far as the general term "beer" goes and more importantly as hefeweizen style should command. Citrus notes, just right on hops, carbonation actually accentuates the positive tastes as opposed to hiding them or making them disappear too quickly.
M- The only minor negative I can find, although it's very minor is it could be a tad too light in the mouth.
D- If you can find a more drinkable, true session, high end beer, please please tell me.
In the end, to each their own, but this is the end all be all to me. Add in the mystique of a brewery this old as opposed to a "new" brewery, micro variety - not that I don't love plenty of those - and you have a beer you must not only try, but buy again and again. 1,104 charactersmarketesq, Jan 04, 2010

A- Pours a pale maize color. Great clarity. Produced three fingers width of white, foamy head. Some lacing as the beer was consumed.
S- Smells mostly of yeast, biscuits and a touch of wheat. There is a slight banana fruitiness to the nose as well along with cloves.
T- Many of the ingredients detected in the nose are present here. Upfront, a large dose of wheat and yeast hit the palate. Has a unique biscuit character to it. The finish has a much fruitier presence then the nose leads to believe. Sweet, ripe bananas and cloves end this one perfectly. 
M- Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Very lively.
D- Very drinkable session beer. One of the better hefeweizens I have had. 
Overall, a solid beer for a style that I do not particularly care for. This would be perfect on a hot summer day. Recommended. 862 charactersrhinos00, Jan 02, 2010

A hazy straw color was given.
I could really pick out the clove in the nose. Other reviews point out banana and other spices, but I guess I missed them as I am really new to tasting/reviewing.

3.75/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 41 pint 0.9 fl ounce bottle poured into the SN tumbler. This is from batch 2179. Not exactly the best of days to drink a hefe with it snowing outside, but i'm sure this will be well worth it.
The bavarian hefe pours a golden straw color with a very thick and frothy that sits atop and slowly fuzzes away. Lots of lacing lines the glass. Smell is quite rich and consists of lots of floral notes balanced with a plenty of hops. Lots of floral notes in the quaff as well with an equal balance of sweet citrus bananas. Not much alcohol is noted in the taste. Mouthfeel is thin but crisp and overall I think this is a great example from this style. The aroma is excellent and the taste is pretty good as well. True german style hefe. 728 charactersabrand, Dec 22, 2009

Appeared slightly clouded with an orange golden hue. Head was white, full, soft and maintained to lace well.
Aroma was of grain bassed citric to the nose.
Taste was grain-like, earthy but soft, hints of citric lemon with a undertone of metal toward the mouthfeel.
The mouth was soft as carbonation was up.
Drinks easy as it goes well with most foods.

4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the fridge into a mug-style glass.
Initial reaction to the aroma on pouring was wow - this is how beer should smell!
Deep gold color, very cloudy and nice looking with depth.
Barely any head on pouring and no lacing. 
Aroma and taste are very spicy all the way through with hops and maybe a hint of berries.
The mouth feel is my favourite part of this beer. It is creamy and nice despite heavy carbonation, a truly great balancing act.
Reminiscent of Belgians in overall character and drinkability. Heavier carbonation and spicing means this is one to savor with appetizers, cheese, or a meal. 611 charactersvpipkt, Dec 22, 2009

Foam dissipates somewhat, leaving a moderat head with decent lacing. Classic yeasty, bubblegum/banana aroma present. Nice malty yeasty taste, with citrusy notes peeking through at the end. Very well balanced, with a good, smooth mouthfeel, and moderate carbonation that seems very fitting for the beer. Highly drinkable, and a great example of the style, and probably one against which all other hefe's should be compared. 502 charactersbristol2120, Dec 14, 2009

Smell - The smell is sweet with a big kick of banana. Smells almost like freshly baked banana bread. Clove, spices, banana, citrus. Very good.
Taste - First sip was mostly banana. Delicious. As the beer warmed, the spices and cloves came out a lot more. Very low on hops, maybe a slight touch of bitterness at the end. It's truly the perfect balance of flavors that one expects in this style. This is the best tasting hefeweizen I've had. 
Mouthfeel - Very light with a somewhat crisp carbonation. 
Drinkability - Tasty and easy to drink. A pleasure every single time. I could drink this all night, and I have. This seriously might be my favorite beer of any style. 856 charactersThesis, Dec 12, 2009

A - Poured a cloudy golden color with orange highlights. The thick 1.5" head quickly reduced to a thin white cap. Not much lacing either.
S - Bananas, yeast, bubblegum, spices and a faint fruity sourness. I just love this aroma.
T - Similar to the aroma but not as strong. Sweet malts up front followed by some citrus and spice finished with a light hop bitterness.
M - Smooth & creamy with tangy carbonation.
D - Very drinkable.
Another one of my favorite Hefeweizens. 516 charactersdecimator, Dec 10, 2009

S: Wonderful aroma with everything you would expect from a Hefeweizen. A pretty strong banana scent is mixed with apples, clove, yeast, and feint citrus. A little bubblegum as well. 
T: Follows the nose pretty well. Apples and pear seem to be the main fruit flavors. These mix nicely with some grain and spice and just a hint of bubblegum on the finish. Nice and refreshing. 
M: Light bodied, just a tad thin at times. Lots of carbonation, which is indicative of the style. Finishes on the dry side. 
D: Very high. You could definitely throw back a few of these on a hot summer day. One of the best representations of this style that I've had the pleasure of drinking. 796 charactersMrDanno96, Dec 08, 2009

pours a very hazy orange hue with a brilliant white, fluffy head that is very sticky. head dissipates after a bit but never goes below a half finger thickness. The head gets a little less sticky as the beer gets lower and lower.
smells of banana up front, with hints of citrus and bubble gum, and finishes with a nice touch of malts. Great amount of spiciness towards the back of the aromas. 
Tastes of the banana taste of weisses up front, but gets more and more complex as he flavor goes along. Hints of citrus and bubble gum, with a fabulous amount of spices. Great flavor, I wouldn't call myself a heffeweisen expert but this is the best one ive ever had. 710 charactersHURTemHIZZY, Dec 08, 2009

The smell was to be expected...a wonderful bouquet of banana, cloves, lemon, and bubble gum in copious amounts. I found the taste, which was the same as the aroma, to be a little toned down relative to the aroma...like an 8 as opposed to a 10. The mouthfeel was a nice light smooth / carbonated combo. Very sessionable. 420 charactersdonniecuffs, Dec 08, 2009
4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier poured into a weizen glass delivers a wonderfully opaque, unfiltered gamboge colour, a sparse amount of bubbles ascend to the magnificently massive cream-white crown which withstands the fall of time in all its majesty for a long period, leaving its inheritance in the shape of sporadic lacing -- hail to the king!
Smell: Obviously bananas 'n' carrots. just like you know it should when it comes to weissbrewskis, some cloves and a whiff of black pepper comes to notice along with the yeasty undertones which functions as base for this otherwise pretty sweet experience.
Taste: Corresponding to what we got in the smell compartment, however the carrots tend to -- thankfully -- dominate over the bananas which seem to be quickly replaced by a peachy/apple-like sourness. The whole ride is finished of with a luring and gentle bitterness interlaced with the aforementioned yeastiness.
Mouthfeel: Medium full and very creamy yet somewhat coarse in texture, medium-low in carbonation.
Drinkability: Concerning weissbier, do they come off as any better than this one, the archetype if you will, 'nuff said; verdrinken -- schnell!
On a sidenote: The brewery is founded in 1040, man back then we'd barely heard of hvitekrist/the son of man/the ultimate irony (get it? a carpenter being nailed to some wood) up here in the grim and frostbitten kingdoms... 1,395 charactersAsgeirr, Dec 05, 2009

T: Banana, and clove clove flavors are very apparent. Lemon and pear flavors also make an appearance giving this a nice hefe tangyness.

While I've never been a huge fan of the style, this is an excellent beer and one that I am happy to drink most any time I find it in front of me. 549 charactersGeezLynn, Dec 05, 2009

I've enjoyed this beer dozens of times over the years, but Weihenstephaner seemed to take a 3-4 year hiatus from our coolers... 
Really only feeling like a beer or two after a way too long day at the desk.... poured into my smaller weizen glass.
2 finger foamy white head ... the brew is a hazy light honey...
Nose is just so inviting and probably about perfect for the style... banana.. clove... yada yada yada.... just an epitome of what makes this such a great brew.
The flavors are again.. pretty much perfect.. everything that we want in any Hefe.. especially one made in Germany... this still tastes fresh.. 
I would write more... but I'm tired.. and want to enjoy this and then knock off some serious slumber.

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured on tap into a 20 oz. weizen glass.
A - Pour is a warm, cloudy golden-blonde with a 1.5-finger head dissipating to 1/2-finger, good effervescence.
S - Fruity and spicy with the signature strong smell of yeast and bananas, more typical of a Belgian white in my opinion. Traces of flowery hops.
T - Just as good as the smell, but tastes like a German heffeweissen whereas it smells more like a Belgian. Maybe this was me, but I really thought that was the case. Sweet malts and yeast with milder fruit (more citrusy) and spice than the smell suggests, lingering sweet, citrus and fruity finish fades to a slightly bitter aftertaste, but not at all unpleasant.
M - Light and slightly creamy, moderate carbonation keeps it feeling lively.
D - Very refreshing, makes a great summer beer or to cool your palate after a savory meal.
This was a surprisingly refreshing beer with great flavor, an all around well-rounded German wheat. I swear it's not my imagination that this beer smelled Belgian but tasted German...in this case the identity crisis works well. 1,065 charactersderuiz10, Dec 03, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5What can you say about a brew whose maker has been in business for 1000 years?
Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a 22 oz Weiss Glass.
Pours a golden unfiltered hue cloudy and solid, with a 2 inch head taking its time to dissipate eliciting strong aromas of banana, tangerine and a hint of clove.
Tastes are a strong yeasty taste rolling over the tongue to a slight bitterness and a malt presence that lasts throughout, until a tartness at the end. The taste thrill recurs throughout serving.
Drinkable and consistent is this one, it always pleases and satisfies.
What a happy experience. 592 characterschetripley, Dec 02, 2009

Served in the appropriate and proprietary glassware. A hazy deep golden color with a huge head of pure white foam. Lacing, lacing, lacing.
Yeast and bananas. Rich and dense, but still the refreshing light hefeweizen. And we're still talking smell.
Tasty yeast flavors and the typical wheat. Rich yeast, and the wheat flavors are well balanced against it.
Not velvety, but approaching that. Very fizzy, which is the impeding factor - but not an impediment in quality.
Great beer. If you're in Germany, get it and enjoy it. If not, buy it in the bottle and serve it right. 642 charactersBillyBoysPie, Nov 30, 2009

A - Pours a mirky golden-yellow with a white frothy head that disipitates into a small white cap and a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some evidence of some sticky lacing along the side of the glass.
S - Banana's, semi-sweet aroma, some spicy notes in there as well. I've had some Hefe's that are too sweet and some that are too bland, this one falls directly in the middle. Not overly sweet while not being too boring. 
T - Banana's, nutmeg, some sweetness, wheat, and spices. Very balanced and smooth. Nothing over the top, very much a straight forward Hefe that's at the top of it's game. A nice spicey/sweet finish.
M - Light bodied, frothy carbonation, refreshing and smooth.
D - A stellar Hefe that deserves to be at the top of the list. Live Oak is a better beer, but this one is much easier to come by and probably my go-to Hefe. 897 charactersSean9689, Nov 22, 2009

A - Beautiful, hazy straw gold color with a pillowy three fingers of foam with good shape retention that holds itself over the top rim of the glass. Head has good retention but finally fades to about a 1/4" and stays with the beer thru the glass.
S - Good, spicy aroma...full of cloves and banana, sweet overall aroma, a little bit of light citrus and a touch of bubble gum. All blend together well, nothing overpowers any of the other aromas.
T - Very smooth flavors. Good wheat character, some cloves up front, bananas there too. No real hop character, but a nice balancing bitterness - almost not noticeable, except for the complete balance it creates in the beer. Spicy, but not over the top...a little bit subdued and blended nicely overall. Very enjoyable wheat beer.
M - On the thin side, as most Hefe's are. Plenty of carbonation, but not as much as many examples of this style. Beer is quite lively, but not overly prickly on the tongue - smoother and quite nice feel.
D - On a hot summer day, is there anything better than a good wheat beer? Well, even on a cold fall night, this is still a great wheat beer and a nice drinking companion. This goes down really smooth and easy - great as a before dinner beer or with some light cheeses. Really nice by itself too, could drink this one all day long. 1,468 charactersportia99, Nov 21, 2009

The beer is pale yellow color, veiled as it is expected from Hefeweizen. The head is clean white color and cloudy looking. The aroma is cloves with banana. Very well balance smell. On the taste side, I get cloves with some banana bread. Extremely well balanced. Nothing is over powering, it's just perfect. Medium body and carbonation is felt in the mouth, not bad for the taste.

T: The taste follows the nose. An excellent spice and fruit characteristic which I love about Bavarian Hefeweizens. There is also a nice yeasty component.
M: The carbonation is quite pleasant and tingles a bit. The body is medium.
D: This is what I think of when I hear Hefeweizen, not the stuff American breweries market as a Hefeweizen. A delicious and easy drinking beer. 600 characterswomencantsail, Nov 15, 2009

Fruity / ester smell, sweet smelling but not the kind of malt sweetness you may get from a bock, just nice and sweet.
Beer is beautiful. Clean, smooth, good body, not too thick not too thin, I could drink this all day long. Beer is a little sweet, not from alcohol or malt, hard to pin down what is causing the sweetness. Beer is wet, not dry at all. Finishes cleanly. An excellent excellent beer.

A - Cloudy yellow-gold with very active, fine-bubbled carbonation and two fingers of creamy white head.
S - Very aromatic with lots of clove up front and some banana not far behind.
T - Banana is much more prominent on the palate, with both a creamy sweetness and a pleasant wheaty twang. After the initial banana onslaught there's a gentle spiciness, with the expected clove present, but also a hint of cardamom. Upon pouring the remainder of the yeast, there's also a slight nutty quality.
M - Very smooth and creamy, with medium body.
D - Endlessly quaffable, this beer is a little too big to be a proper session beer, but I could easily put away a few of these without much trouble. Not only is Weihenstephaner Hefe a refreshing summer beer, its gentle spiciness makes it a worthy alternative to the winter seasonals now hitting the shelves. 889 characterstrbergman, Nov 11, 2009

A. Pours a very hazy golden color. It is quite cloudy, as it should be. A very bright white head. Fades fairly quickly.
S. It smelled of cloves and other spices. A strong banana bread aroma, which I always seem to smell in hefs.
T. Possibly because of the smell, I taste banana. I also taste yeast and wheat. Very pleasant taste.
M. It leaves a light aftertaste. It has good carbonation as well. Very creamy and refreshing.
D. Very good on a Summer day. Good representation of the style. I will most definately pick up some more when in the mood for wheat beer. 603 characterscaliforniakulak, Nov 11, 2009

A - Hazy light straw yellow that's populated by bubbles escaping to a dense white head. Perfectally formed and retained eternally, it's a brilliant snow-cap on top of a delicious mountain of beer. Lots of thick, clumpy lacing on the way down.
S - This hefe has the perfect aroma. A nice crisp wheat nose surrounded by supple spicy esters from the yeast, a mellow fruity banana, and fresh bubble gum. Enticing in every way.
T - Absolutely delicious soft wheat that's as fresh as can be with a yeasty spice flavor that hints at the myriad of flavors rather than beating you over the head with them. The banana is there with a bit of fruity bubblegum and soft notes of earthy clay.
M - Mellow on the carbonation allowing it to open up flavor-wise and be soft and smooth. Lighter-bodied, it's a great feeling beer.
D - I could drink this all summer long (if it was summer). A fantastic beer packed with nuances and a great feeling to boot! Refreshing and delicious, it's a perfect example of the style! 1,132 charactersBeerFMAndy, Nov 08, 2009

Pours a beautifully cloudy, orange color with plenty of fluffy head. A solid amount of lacing remains on the glass after drinking.
Smells like wheat, yeast, and a little bit of banana.
Very smooth taste with malty sweetness, traditional wheat, a hint of banana, and mild hops, but I was really expecting more here. The aftertaste feels like it was watered down and leaves me longing for something more. This is far from being a bad hefe, but it's clearly inferior to the offerings from style-leaders Paulaner and Augustiner IMO.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Best part of this beer.
Drinkability is high due to its relatively light taste and fabulous mouthfeel. I could see myself sessioning this brew.
A good hefe all in all, but it doesn't live up to the rave reviews here. Paulaner's hefe still reigns supreme as the best universally available weissbier. 955 charactersbrystmar, Nov 05, 2009

A - Two fingers plus of fluffy show white head. As usual the wheat helps a big head form and stay atop the cloudy golden brew. In a weizen glass with a good swirled yeast pour, this beer is exactly what a hefeweizen should look like.
S - Yeasty smell with a nice nutty tone. Tiny bit of banana and spice in there as well,
T - A very easy going, refreshing flavor with just enough of a clove flavor coming over some nice slightly fruity sweetness. A bit of banana and tiny hint of bubblegum come through as well before the brew finishes with a tart subtle bite.
M - Very smooth, fairly creamy yet light feel with just the right kiss of carbontation.
D - Bring on more. A perfectly balanced hefe that has the banana and spice flavors but remains refeshing enough in flavor to make an excellent session brew. 865 charactersEStreet20, Nov 03, 2009

Appearance: Don't know if it could have been more hefeweizen than it poured. Cloudy gold color with fluffy white head that billowed nicely as she poured. Head retention was very solid at about an inch above surface level, and laced decently. Inviting, that's for sure.
Smell: Yum. The traditional wheaty, fresh banana and clove hef nose are definitely present here. Sweet, but not quite bubble gummy, and just altogether very indicative of the style. Then again, this is one of the oldest renditions, shouldn't be too surprised.
Taste: Wow. After having several decent Hefs recently, this certainly shows how tasty and refreshing a good Hef is. Sweet malts accompanied by slight hops in a wheaty balance that is just so inviting on a warm evening. Taste becomes a little more banana and clove rather than sweet as it opens up a bit, but still very, very refreshing and delicious.
Mouthfeel: Creamy and carbonated perfectly. Just awesome carbonation level, that's for sure. The homebrewed Hef my housemates and I brewed recently is slightly overcarbonated, and it takes a tad away from the end result. This, on the other hand, is just right. Tasty. 
Drinkability: High, but not immense. Man, I love a good Hef. So refreshing and delectable, I'm rarely in a mood where Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier doesn't sound awesome. Super pleasant, and worthy top 100 beer beyond a shadow of a doubt. 1,514 charactersnomomentwasted, Oct 31, 2009

Reading some comments here upfront, I'm curious too.
Looks good smells good tastes good.
Orange-yellow glow to this beer, massive carbonation, great lacing too.
Fresh smell of hops, bread, banana and citrus, orange and lemon. Also, like a good wheat beer, it's spicy, with a bit of pepper, cloves, koriander... 
Similar taste, but stronger. Complex and balanced. Very refreshing.
The carbonation is maybe a bit too much (unless it's summertime), but the mouthfeel is outstanding nevertheless. This is pretty drinkable indeed. 
It's a pitty I never discovered this beer before. It is a great treat on warm summerevenings. I'm glad I found it now.
Easily the best, not only of german hefeweizen, but of all wheat beers everywhere, in my experience.

4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a lively white head that holds up extremely well and leaves a lot of lacing.
Smell reveals a lot of wheat and cloves upfront with a noticeable fruity aroma toward the end. A very prominent aroma that is quite pleasing and really gets me psyched for tasting.
Taste hits immediately with fresh banana and cloves with wheat in the background and a hint of honey towards the finish. A little bit of citrus can also be detected.
Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A top of the line hefe. Obviously great for a hot day but this is one I can enjoy year round. 599 charactersVengeance526, Oct 23, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured slowly and slightly agitated into the appropriate .5l Weihenstephaner hefe glass. A beautiful sight if ever there was one.
An earlier reviewer mentioned a banana bread smell. I think this is appropriate, as there isn't an overwhelming hit of banana to this bouquet, just a mild hint. There are some peppery spices in the mix with clove being the most prominent.
What a gorgeous beer. The glass accentuate the four fingers of fluffy white head that sit atop a base of golden wheat. There are many trails of carbonation making the long traverse from bottom to top, making for a moving image.
American hefe's eat your heart out. This is wheat beer nirvana. The spice in this beer is incredibly balanced, the clove I smelled is there along with some trilling bitter notes from a minimal hop profile. The banana esters are really minimal and this beer stands as an excellent example of the less is more philosophy of the German purity law.
There is not a better mouthfeel in the hefe world, hence the perfect 5. There is a thickness to this brew, that the wheat provides, that makes it a much more palatable summer companion than its american counterparts. Mix this with fantastic carbonation and you have a great brew.
No issues with drinkability, it practically demands that you have another. A real cultural treasure to the nation of Germany and a welcome cultural visitor here in the states. I really need to start reviewing some bad beers. 1,451 characterscptierney, Oct 23, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5They brewery has had a thousand years to prefect their brew so it had better be good, right? Well they didn't disappoint with this one. I've had it two different ways, from the bottle and from the tap. I prefer the bottle, which is the more German way to serve a hefe-weissen, just make sure you use the proper glass.
The beer pours great, a clear orange-yellow at first, then shake the bottle and continue pouring and it becomes a cloudy orange-yellow with about an inch and a half of thick white head up to the rim of the glass. 
The smell is pretty strong, which is how most hefes are. The first smell is cloves and malts with a mild spiciness and hints of lemon. 
This beer is very earthy. There is minimal hop character and a strong malty character, which is balanced with the sweetness of the wheat. It is a great beer to drink in a biergarten in the summer because it has a nice amount of carbonation to give it a refreshing finish to it. 
One of the best hefe-weissens I've ever had, I definitely recommend one for a hot summer day.
(note: don't ever drink a hefe with a lemon or an orange slice on the glass, drink it like a real German)
Here's to a thousand years of brewing and I hope there will be many more after that. 1,237 charactersjamescain, Oct 22, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Date code of 2179.
A: Cloudy straw color with a fluffy white head and minor amounts of lacing. 
S: Smells good - I was expecting a big hit of banana but instead was greeted with clove, wheat, light banana, and some citrus. 
T: Similar to the smell - clove, lemon, grain and a nice lingering, slightly bitter charcoal-like finish. Well constructed stuff.
M: What sets this beer apart from other hefes is it smoothness and overall feel. Hard to put into words - this beer is just a pleasure to drink. 
D: High. I will have this in my fridge (along with Dancing Man) during the summer months. 594 charactersbound4er, Oct 21, 2009

Smell is banana bread and clove with faint citrussy freshness and fresh grass.
Tastes like a grainy fruit loaf with spice - sehr gut!
The mothfeel is creamy yet refreshing with decent carbonation.
This is the Masstab of the style. 328 charactersDerBayer, Oct 20, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Back to the classics here. Brilliant on tap and still exceptional in the 500ml bottle.
Appearance is that of a typical hefe: golden and opaque, with a light head encircling the glass. 
Nose is of wheat, honey, banana and fresh spices. 
Taste is exceptionally smooth and terrifically quaffable. Banana, clove and just a little bit of bitterness to the finish, but very rounded. 
Mouthfeel is slightly, thin, creamy, with tart carbonation. A great summer quaffer.
A classic hefeweisse, with a lovely crisp finish. Great as a sessional at any time of year, but truly tastes best on a summer patio. 599 charactersJohnnyBarman, Oct 19, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from 12 oz bottle into Weizen glass.
This review is a little different. I previously reviewed Franziskaner and wanted to do a head to head with Weihenstephaner. So my buddy Timster and I sampled both side by side. I'll skip the usual stuff...my previous review of Franziskaner still stands, and in fact also fits the Weihenstephaner very nicely. After much back and forth, both tasting-wise and discussion-wise, we only agreed on two differences...
1) The Franziskaner had a slightly 'crisper' finish, perhaps due to a tiny bit of difference in carbonation. The Weihenstephaner's finish was a little smoother/rounder. This was very subtle and we could not agree on which was preferable.
2) The Weihenstephaner had just a tiny bit more clove in the taste. Again, we could not agree on which was preferred.
Other differences were both too subtle and fleeting for us to agree upon in any way. That includes the ABV difference of about 0.4%, which was surprisingly not at all obvious in the smell or taste.
So which is the better hefe? I'm calling it a push. I would probably make any future purchasing decisions between these two based on price and/or freshness. 1,170 charactersVikeMan, Oct 18, 2009
3.65/5  rDev -17%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a hazy gold colour, with a large amount of carbination. The taste of very sweet fruits runs through out this beer. Hints of bananas as well. Its a little too citrusy though. Its very hard to drink two or more of these. A decent beer overall, but its definately overrated. 277 charactersWeedKing4, Oct 16, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Weizen glass that I just got at Oktoberfest. Time to finally pour a proper beer into it.
Pours an opaque gold, with orange hues in the thickest part of the glass. Rocky 2-inch head, banana creme in color. Brilliant carbonation. Almost no lacing to speak of.
This smells like freshly harvested wheat and freshly picked honey comb. Adding to the greatness is a light malt presence, cloves, and a zingy hop finish.
Easily the best Hefeweiss I've tasted, by miles. This is the first german HW i've had and it tastes magical. This came highly recommended and it is worth it.
Pure, fresh wheat, honey sweetness, light malting, wonderful hop balance to blend in, gentle finish.
Mouthfeel is light but not watery. Carbonation is invigorating without biting the tongue.
Absolutely Refreshing. I could drink this any time of the year and be perfectly content. 888 charactersAmberMan22, Oct 12, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This one pours a cloudy deep amber. A great dense, compact, sticky head sits around the entire way and leaves thick rings and patches of sticky lacing most of the way down the glass.
There's lots of wheat on the nose with some yeast character, a light sweetness, gentle spiciness, and a noticeable citrus presence, all in perfect harmony.
There's mostly wheat and citrus in the flavor along with light banana and clove notes and a balanced mix of malt, which adds a light sweetness,. A very light but noticeable hops flavor is quite subtle and just enough to even it out. A surprisingly lingering finish rounds out the wheat, yeast and citrus characters.
There's a surprising thick creaminess to this brew, very nicely complimenting a crispness and a carbonation that's not too heavy.
There's not much wrong with this at all; this is the quintessential hefeweizen. 864 charactersBrenden, Oct 12, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Looks like fizzy liquid honey in my wine glass, with a vortex of tiny bubbles swirling up to join a moderately dense head.
Smells of citrus and mild spicyness with a hint of banana. Nice.
Tastes...well...fruity. Refreshing, and very straightforward. Balanced very nicely. This tastes like a straight-up snappy dry hefe the way I would imagine them to be. It's very good, with a pleasantly lingering finish.
Mouthfeel is really quite nice, particularly for a hefe. It has strong presence, and a bit of creaminess you don't always get in these guys. Really nice. 
Good drinkability here. Seemed to get better as it went on...I could see these following each other. Definitely would drink again. 696 charactersnokes, Oct 12, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'm starting to get more into this type of beer after the Hacker-Pschorr Hefe Weisse I had the other day and this one. I thought the Hacker-Pschorr was slightly better, though.
Looks good... cloudy gold. Tall, foamy head that left no lace on the sides except where I was drinking. 
The smell is good, albeit a bit sharp.
It tastes pretty good! I get a banana, cream, & dough flavour with a bit of spice. 
It feels smooth, not too thick or thin.
Pretty drinkable! I won't be afraid to further explore this genre after the other ones I had that I didn't care for as much. 574 charactersPEIBeerGuy, Oct 12, 2009
3.15/5  rDev -28.4%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 4I drank this from the bottle into a chalice.
It pours a hazy medium gold with a decent white head. Light retention and lacing.
The aroma is light with notes of flowers, hops, and honey.
The taste is what you would expect from a weiss, not a big fan of this style, but saying that it was not the best weiss I've had. The taste was light, and it had a very unpleasant metallic finish that contriubted to a poor mouthfeel as well. You can this all because its so light despite its weird after-taste. 499 charactersjrallen34, Oct 11, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy yellow orange with a two finger white head (this beer is volatile) that leaves a good blanket on the beer and has decent retention. Medium lacing is left as I sip this one down. Smells of banana, apples, other fruits, light malts and yeasts. This beer has a strong smell that I can actually pick up, great aromas on this one. Taste is a good balance of malts, yeast, esters, bananas and a hint of apple. Beer gets better and better with every sip, which is the opposite of 85% of the beers I drink. Mouthfeel is pretty light, good smooth carbonation, a bit of alcohol warming but this is expected with the style and a nice coat of german flavors on the tongue, yeast and esters. Drinkability is great, the beer never really loses its flavor or develops off flavors in a reasonable amount of it. The price is fine or a good German beer. I will definitely buy and recommend this one as the go to German beer. 921 characterscbutova, Oct 11, 2009

T: All the spices carry through wonderfully and kind of dominate. Full, fluffy mouthfeel that drifts off your palate. Not many other flavors - spice dominates with clove, but there's noticeably lingering banana. 344 charactersweazal, Oct 07, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Mmmm. Had this on tap at a bar in Berlin, where they really know how to serve a beer: in a tall weizen glass with a beautiful fluffy head on top of the hazy orange.
Smell was fruity and clovey, not too overpowering, and the taste was the very definition of the beer: citrus, cloves, banana, wheat. Too much clove is probably my pet peeve in these beers, but this was perfectly blended, with a pop of carbonation in a very smooth body and a dry finish. Easy to drink--I had a liter last night! 493 characterslstokes, Oct 07, 2009

S: A bit watery, but very fruity and pleasant. Lemon, orange, banana and other citrus aromas ( possibly hops) are present.
T: Beautiful balance of citrus zest and fruity sweetness! The aftertaste is of light hops and lemon. Bready yeast, banana and possibly coriander, or something similar.
M: High carbonation. Relatively full-bodied and light, a really great mouthfeel.
d: This beer is as drinkable as beers get. 560 charactersBeelzeBrew, Oct 06, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I poured this into a tall pilsner glass. The head was awesome! I sat out on my patio and drank this very slow to make sure I enjoyed every single drop. While I was drinking I noticed I was pushing my tongue down into the beer in the glass.(Lapping like A dog after A 4 mile run on a 90 degree day!). My girlfriend utters the death phrase, "Why don't you put a lemon in it?".noway! I was not going to mask the flavor of this beer with a piece of fruit.
 I have seen this beer countless times and never picked it up. This beer was rocking! I wish i was drinking it at this moment. I have tried so many heffewissebiers in the past 6 years. The only 2 brews besides Weihenstephaner have really blown me away were Hacker-Pschorr and Franziskaner. Just a good all around great beer. Next week im trying the dark wessie. 813 characterssociallooter, Oct 06, 2009

The flavors are well rounded with clove, banana, caramel malt. A delicate balance that makes this stand out for the style.

T: Very well balanced and the citrus and clove flavors take the forefront of your tastebuds. It ends with a wheaty bread flavor.

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on Tap at Weihenstephan Brewery in Freising, Germany.
You have not had a hefeweizen until you have had this beer. My definition of a hefeweizen in two words is : Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier.
A - An awesome cloudy golden body with a perfect fluffy head. Some lace, but not retain too well. 
S - A very balanced smell of citrus, cloves and wheat. Nothing to write home about, but still very nice.
T - Citrus and Cloves strait to the dome, I repeat, Citrus and Cloves! this is amazingly well balanced brew that affords you a full plethora oranges,lemons, cloves, wheat, bread, and maybe a little hint of bananas. Not really a big presence of hops or malts. But it just beckons you to drink more... 
M - Medium bodied with not much carbonation. just what you would want or expect from a hefe.
D - The best hefe I have had. It was my staple beer when I lived in Germany. You cannot go wrong with it. Also very inexpensive, probably the cheapest on the Top BA list. 971 characterskylegillick, Oct 01, 2009

Had this on tap at an authentic German restaurant in Plano, Texas...
Arrived in a weizen glass looking like a perfect Hefe... Cloudy and hazy with a thick head....
Wonderful aromas of clove, some of the typical banana, a little yeast and a little wheat... This is everything one could look for in a Hefe... Smells terrific...
This is really a delight to drink... Its delicious and spot on for the style as it should be since its German...wheaty and yeasty with a great banana and clove taste...
I could sip these all night long without a doubt.. Just terrific... 616 charactersTilley4, Oct 01, 2009

This is quite simply a textbook Hefeweizen, with everything in the right place. 
Gold and faintly cloudy in appearance, with a fluffy, pillowy white head that piles high.
Smells of banana, clove, slight citrus and wheat. Beautiful and not at all overdone.
Balanced flavors of classic Hefeweizen in the mouth, with good cut from acidity and carbonation that balances it all very well.
Touch of sweetness, and glides down smooothly.
Super easy to drink. Outstanding. Easy to love this beer. 508 charactersnectar14, Sep 30, 2009

S - Fruits stand out in the aroma...mainly banana with some apple and pear...light spices linger as well
T - As the aroma suggests the fruits hit you first...bananas are very dominate in the flavor...some more apple comes through but that banana flavor is big...yet it's not overpowering...the mixture of spices is blended nicely and come in at the right time...clove, coriander, and just a touch of cinnamon make their appearance in the finish to leave a nice spicy aftertaste
M - Medium bodied...creamy and coats the palate nicely...would have liked more crispness since there was a lot of carbonation...and sometimes it tastes a little watered down
D - One of the best hefe's I've had...I can't believe how good this beer is for the price...it's definitely a big bang for your bucks...a must try for any BA 983 charactersthain709, Sep 26, 2009

A- Cloudy golden color, huge fluffy white head. Even some lacing sticking to the glass.
S- Sweet fruity banana smell. The yeast reminds me of some belgian pale ales.
T- Tastes a lot like it smells. Bananas and the distinct yeast flavor. Finishes smooth with a wheat taste. I can see where people get the bubble gum flavors from too. I think the yeast flavor from this is one of my favorite tastes in the beer world.
M- Smooth, even a little slick. Not as crisp and clean as a filtered beer. Very nice.
D- The beer is nearly halfway gone as I get to the drinkability section. How many could I drink? How many do you have? Easy drinking, very refreshing. Excellent example of the style. I can only imagine how much better it would be if I were patient enough to let it get a little colder. It was only refrigerated for a short time. I couldn't stand waiting and I had to open it. Still, an awesome beer. 954 charactersCarlP2, Sep 25, 2009

A - Poured into a mug from a pint bottle. Dirty, hazy gold with a tint of orange. Huge, very nice foamy head. Attractive beer, good lacing.
S - Nice clove smell with some at first very immersing banana smell that follows up with mild, but present citris. The yeast has a big presense, but it is not overly powerful like many beers of this style. Nicely balanced, yet strong on all fronts.
T - Banana right away, the wheat gets you too. Nice bready taste with a bit of citris and spice thrown in. Very nice.
M - Nice carbonation on a medium bodied beer. Leaves the mouth cleanly.
D - Very easy to drink, none of the flavors are overpowering or leave a bad aftertaste. A little sweet, but not so much that you can't drink it all day. A great beer for those who like this style. 853 charactersAgentZero, Sep 23, 2009

Orange in color, hazy with a thin white head. Retention was rather poor. The nose was excellent. Fresh citrus with orange, banana and clove, just thoroughly juicy and fresh. Bready and wheaty. The palate is perfectly balanced with flavors of citrus (orange), banana and clove presented on a medium, wheaty body. Crisp and well carbonated with a great dry, fruity finish, this beer is nothing short of fantastic. Exceptional stuff. 519 charactersDefenCorps, Sep 21, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 49/2009
500 mL bottle poured into a weissbier glass.
Pours a cloudy orange-tinted straw with a huge, fluffy, creamy, rocky white head with great staying power.
Aromas of ripe banana balanced by spicy clove, fresh and inviting. Light bubblegum entry, leading to an even lighter banana with accompanying clove spice before making way for a smooth, lightly tart wheat character in the finish. Lingering clove spice with a yeasty twang that invites me in for another drink.
Light in body, with a moderate carbonation level that lends itself to a seemingly fuller body.
A good, well-rounded hefe, but far from the best in my book. 626 characterswnh, Sep 19, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Wow, just wow. I've been a lover of Hefeweizen from brewpubs for a long time and always felt that something was missing from bottled format.. until now.
 Appearance: Very strong head, so be careful when you pour into glass. but mild cloudy golden appearance.
Aroma: slightly clove/banana-ish fresh-out-of-oven baguette smell.
Taste: Medium strong strength. Malty, but unlike the smell, the sweetness was more of Apple-ish sweet than banana. bitterness kicks in the middle and leaves mouth with that earthy wheaty bready note.
 I (intentionally) tried this beer at various temperatures and I felt that this performs best at around 8-12C
Mouthfeel: Medium-Low carbonation, but overally smooth.
Overally, by far the BEST bottled hefeweizen I've ever tried. 759 charactersBarleyAndApple, Sep 19, 2009

T: perfectly balanced. citrus at the forfrount again. tartness like a cider - pear. very dry and welcome finish. alchohol very low key.

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 50cl bottle into a pint glass.
Pours a hazy orangish-yellow with a dense white foam head of a couple of fingers. Excellent head retention and lacing. 
Banana, clove, lemony citrus, and sweet malt. Light and delicate, but persistent. Nothing stands out, all in balance. 
Great flavors in almost perfect balance. Some sweetness comes on at the first swig, with some wheat chafe or yeast in the main body, and some banana in there as well. It's hard to pick out the flavors as they are so well coordinated and balanced. The finish is a bit on the wheat side in the front with a drying linger. 
Texture is so smooth on this! Carbonation is damn near perfection and lets this go down incredibly easily. With the fantastic flavors and great mouthfieel, this scores perfectly for drinkability. 804 charactersSIRIUS2, Sep 16, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of the best Hefe's I've ever had. All of the big German Export Hefe's are pretty good but this one is a notch above.
A - Pours a beautiful golden brown wheaty color with a nice head that lingers throughout the life of the beer. 
S - Sweet with a little bit of banana that jumps out at the palette when you take your first swig. 
T - You can taste the banana along with the wheat. It's a little bit sweeter than your traditional Hefe.
D - At 5.4% ABV I could drink these all night long. The body is perfect, not too gassy, not too thick, just right!!
M - Smooth and enjoyable. Great body. I honestly don't have a bad thing to say about this beer.
Hefe's are one of my favorite genre's. I spend my later teenage years in Germany so I was essentially introduced to beer during this time. Unfortunately BA wasn't around during those years but I'm making up for it now;-) 876 characterstdawgydog, Sep 15, 2009
4.19/5  rDev -4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - pours a ginger ale yellow with a two finger rocky pure white head, tons of carbonation, some sediment in the final pour
S - could smell the wheat/yeast as soon as the seal was broken, its a huge wheat/yeast aroma, absolutely enticing, slight citrus and spice (clove/nutmeg) notes compliment the aroma
T - following the trend, wheat/yeast flavors dominate, the sweet, breadiness that defines the style. citrine and spine notes compliment the flavor like they do in the bouquet
M&D - the flavor is accentuated by the bready cloyingly thick mouthfeel, luxurious on the tongue, smooth and sessionable at only 5.4%, i guess almost a millenium of brewing is plenty of time to hone your skill to near perfection 711 characterssinstaineddemon, Sep 14, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: An attractive gold with a slight orange tinge, has the cloudiness of a wheat beer of course, with a nice 2 finger length head and small lacing 
Smell: Cloves are very apparent, smells sweet, maybe fruits in there
Taste: I'm getting mostly cloves, the beers a little warm I may have to re-review this one. Some sweet malt qualities; It's a bit spicy; whole--warms the stomach.
Mouthfeel: It feels light and crisp, carbonated, doesn't leave too strong of an aftertaste, rather a faint one that lingers 
Drinkability: This brewery's been around for almost a thousand years and they are sure to stay, this beer is unique, has a nice blend of spices. Sets the standard for wheat beers everywhere; nonetheless comparable to Harpoons UFOs though. 755 charactersmikel52588, Sep 13, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Poured from a 12 oz into a taster's pint. Has a cloudy golden yellow with a nice fat finger length head that doesn't leave behind any legs. 
Smell: Malted buttery wheat as expected with a hint of lemonpeel and banana. Subtle nuances of clove and vanilla with some grassy undertones to boot.
Taste: At the forefront it is a tangy buttery yeast that washes over with a malty backbone then it transforms into a second wave of almost straight-up freshly peeled banana with a pinch of clove. The finish is crisp and leaves behind a thick wheat coating.
Mouthfeel: Superbly carbonated and velvety smooth with a great deal of staying power. 
Drinkability: Nothing to set you off from drinking another aside from wheat beers not being your shtick but this could make a believer out of naysayers. Abv is average and would make a great anytime session.
Overall: There is a reason this is Germany's oldest brewery; they know what they are doing. This brew has a perfect balance of ingredients and even falls true to the traditional reinheitsgebot. Well crafted and a testimonial to a true wheat. 1,101 characterscraftaholic, Sep 13, 2009

S: Very wheaty, but I'm terrible at the smells.
T: Maybe a little bit of banana, very wheaty, and very good. I think I might have gotten a slight ginger aftertaste but I could be wrong.

A - Cloudy golden color with a nice white head. 
S - Aroma of wheat, yeast, banana, and clove. 
T - Typical light wheaty flavor, yeasty, refreshing, fruity, with clove and banana. Very well-balanced and well done, doesn't try to do too much.
M - Light with lively carbonation, a little dry.
D - Off the charts. Incredibly refreshing. 
Always a good call (unlike Miller Lite, which claims this, but is a terrible beer). 485 charactersnickd717, Sep 10, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Snagged my first bottle of this stuff today.. so here it goes...
- Huge fluffy big bubbled head.. white.. bright white head. Nice light straw yellow cloudy color.. very solid.
- Smells like a common Saison or Farmhouse ale.... but rich in wheat and/or grain... little bit of banana, clove spice, bread, and yeast...
- Smooth and creamy brew.. bread, grain.. biscuit, and some zest that is a bit tart on the back of the tongue. Certainly different... little bit of banana... some woodiness to it as well..
- Great feel.... not dry or chewy at all.... just pure.
- Bit carbonated, but smooth sailing all the way... I am enjoying it right out of the fridge nice and cold. 673 charactersDocer, Sep 09, 2009

(A)- Pours a cloudy goldenrod to pale yellow color. Massive 3+finger white head formed and is simply not dissipating! Very thick foam present. Minimal lacing down the glass. 
(S)- Lemony biscuits with delicate banannas. Ample clay and yeast presence. Good clove nuances. 
(T)- Delicious and crisp bananna/lemon fruits. Silky bread/biscuits and clove. Just ever so slightly sweet. 
(M)- Absolutely positively as silky smooth as a beer can get! This does down so easily. Perfect carbonation level. Delicate, smooth, crisp, makes you want to take another sip. Balanced to perfection. 
(D)- The perfect Hefeweizen in my opinion. Smooth, crisp, and perfectly balanced. Nothing fancy at all, but just perfectly made and with everything in the right place. Its as easy drinking as drinking water (almost). Superb fruits and mouthfeel. This is THE summer beer to consume! 917 characterssweemzander, Sep 09, 2009

Appearance: Golden, hazy hue, with straw shimmers. Hazy and cloudy with a big white head. Big bubbles in the head. very little lacing. 
Smell: Great nose on this. big banana and clove upfront, with some spiciness hidden. Obvious wheat aroma as well. Some vanilla and perhaps citrus as well. I really enjoyed the aroma of this beer. 
Taste: Delicious, but not as impressive as the nose. Tangy, with yeasty wheat flavor. Malty banana on the tongue and ground clove. It's like the aroma travels right to your taste buds. Crisp finish, leaves the taste of wheat malt in your mouth. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation, just enough to prick the tongue, in a good way. Very smooth, this beer went down fast! 
Drinkability: Very drinkable. Low alcohol and its refreshing flavor make it the perfect summertime brew. 853 charactersDarkhorse09, Sep 08, 2009

T- Mild citrus and grassy flavor... nice little yeasty backbone with a buttery bready tone.
M - Medium bodied, creamy yet ample carbonation, slight staying power in the mouth.

Big creamy wheat smell followed by some citrus, clove and a touch of banana.
Just like the nose. Really rich for this style of beer.
Mouthfeel is glorious. It is like drinking velvet. Fullest bodied hefe I've had. Thick with a tickle of carbonation. So smooth all the way down. 
Could have these all night. Finishes so clean. Feels and tastes like drinking a banana cream pie. Great beer! I would have this again. 487 charactersjera1350, Sep 04, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a big, loose head of two to three fingers crest, has bubbles of all sizes, the all pop and fizzle at the same rapid rate, bleached bone white in color, little lacing left behind. Fully opaque from the glowing murkiness, orange rust in color with a light brown tinge, yellows out around the rims. Relaxed nose of clove spice, pound cake, dried molasses, mostly apricot and pear fruit scents with a touch of banana, lightest graininess which could still register as such. Light-bodied, strong effervescence, the bubbles keep coming and coming at you. Accounting for this, the mouth feel is soft and creamy, gently hugs the contours of your mouth. Clove element fits with lighter pine and lemon peel nuances. A touch breadier here, still not much grain. The malts too are polished and do not lend a great deal of sweetness to the whole. Silky enough to last pretty long through the finish. Nothing truly stands out from the rest, crafted to be a whole rather than collection of parts. 987 charactersfarrago, Sep 02, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: Pours to a hazy gold with a decent amount of white foam.
Smell: Yeasty aroma with a hint of banana. Classic, light, Hefeweizen aroma -- excellent!
Taste: Opens smoothly and gently with a hint of bread, yeast, and banana. Aftertaste is pleasant and fades quickly. Nothing in the taste overwhelms or is out of balance.
Mouthfeel: Slighly carbonation-based bite initially, but this fades quickly. A smooth feel follows the initial opening.
Drinkability: This beer is enjoyable in numerous situations. It is smooth and refreshing as a session beer, an excellent companion to many types of food, and interesting enough as a solo project. At 5.4% ABV, one can enjoy several without impairment. 
To me, this beer is the standard to which other Hefes are held. 769 charactersPerroGrande, Sep 02, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1pt, .9oz bottle into a weizen glass. There is no freshness date but there is a bottle number of 6069 printed on the back.
Appearance: The body is cloudy and has an old gold or dark golden color with a tall white head on top. The head is thick and foamy, long lasting and makes spotty lacing on the glass.
Smell: The nose is sweet and full of fruity yeast with notes of banana, bubble gum and wheat malt.
Taste/Mouth: There are bready and yeast flavors up front with banana notes and a touch of clove coming through. The finish has pleasant tangy wheat and very mild hop bitterness which give it some dryness. The palate has a refreshing, easy drinking medium body with nice active carbonation and a lively crisp texture.
Notes: This is a world class beer from the oldest brewery in the world. 838 charactersgenerallee, Sep 01, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into 0.5 liter hefeweizen glass. The golden yellow color is something to behold as the liquid builds up a head that means business, with some easy, lazy lacing coating the inside of the glass. Smell is fruity and slightly malty.
Taste was out of this world, simple as that. For my first hefeweizen, it was amazing. A very bready flavoring, characteristic of the wheat. I also picked up the fruity hints of banana and citrus. I tasted the kick of the bitter hops towards the middle of my tongue. The finish didn't have the slightest hint of bitterness, though, which both surprised and pleased me. The carbonation danced over my tongue and palate, adding a crisp feel to drinking experience. It was so invigorating that I had to consciously pace myself. I still managed to finish it rather quicker than I would have wanted. 
I'm more of a stout person, but the great experience I had with this Weihenstephaner has put it firmly in my 'favorite beers' list. I would definitely drink it again. And again. And again. 1,021 charactersr0nyn, Aug 31, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 500mL bottle into my Ayinger weizen glass. Bottled 2/06/2009 (bottle code "6069"), so this sample is over 6 months old.
Liquid is somewhere between pale old gold and selective yellow, cloudy, and topped with an initially gargantuan head of foam which while thick recedes to less than a finger in height, leaving cresting waves of lacing behind. 
The most balanced aroma of any weissbier I've encountered, the perfect marriage of phenols and esters. Banana and strawberry present first, followed up by pepper and clove. Textbook.
Sipping leads to an intensification of the aromas on the palate, leading into the complex flavors of freshly baked, artisan whole wheat bread, with a hint of allspice and citrus (lemon, orange) in the finish. Lovely. 
Medium-light bodied, fairly creamy, but very refreshing due to the high carbonation. 
One of the very best expressions of the style. While I sometimes prefer something less balanced (weird as that may sound), this is very nearly the platonic form of hefeweizen. 1,027 charactersaugustgarage, Aug 27, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 450 cl bottle. Pours a hazy golden-orange color with a decent frothy white head, good lacing. Aroma is estery banana and cloves, wheat, caramel malts, yeast, with a citrus and peppery finish. Flavor is about the same, very sweet. Bananas, cloves, wheat, and spicy. Dry but very smooth mouthfeel, light to medium body, sweet on the tongue and fairly lively as far as carbonation is concerned. Very good beer, perfect example for the style. 437 charactersmtstatebeer, Aug 25, 2009

S- Banana and clove are the most prominent aromas on the nose, along with some breadlike malt character and restrained aromas of lemongrass. Can't wait to taste!
T- Tastes like banana bread covered in a banana buttercream icing. I'm getting some sweet cookielike maltiness, some slight restrained tartness (presumably from the wheat), and some restrained spiciness (clove?). Super long/lingering banana finish. Absolutely delicious!
M- Full, beautifully creamy body with tons of beautifully soft carbonation. Just exquisite. 
D- Um... YES! I can drink these all day and all night. The appearance, aromas, flavor and texture are all incredible...and the relatively low ABV makes this super quaffable!
Note: I was very tempted to give this straight 5's across the board, but resolved that ONE DAY, I might find something better (but I doubt it!!) 1,068 charactersjgasparine, Aug 23, 2009

2 1/2 finger head slowly dissipates into a thin lace-like head. Body is slightly cloudy, amber color.
Smell is extremely wheaty, with a hint of citrus and banana.
Hits the tip of tongue with a strong taste of citrus. Light bodied and moves to the back of mouth leaving a wheat aftertaste.

Appearance: Hazy golden yellow with very apparent carbonation and a large, frothy, bright white head. Lacing is solid for the style all the way through.
Smell: Banana and some citrus. This is one that's certainly about the taste, how it should be.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Take the smell, add some spice, the perfect amount of carbonation and you may have the perfect hefe. The mouthfeel is light, bubbly and perfect for anytime you need refreshment.
Drinkability: I could drink this beer anytime, summer, winter, after a plethora of mediocre wheat beers, anything. Certainly a benchmark for the style. 703 charactersRyWill, Aug 22, 2009

A: Cloudy orange-gold body topped with a towering, rocky head of fine white foam. Great retention, but not as much lace as could be desired. All in all, great looking for the style.
S: Banana, banana, banana. Delicious, but just a bit one-dimensional; I couldn't get anything else out of the aroma.
T: Everything you could want out of a hefe: rich banana fruitiness up front, followed by some spicy yeast notes and a round, drying maltiness on the finish. Delicious.
M: Prickly carbonation at first, mellowing into a smooth, medium body.
D: Hugely refreshing, and eminently quaffable. I'd be happy sessioning this beer all day on a hot summer afternoon.
Notes: quite possibly the best all around hefe I've ever had; lives up to its reputation in every way.
Cheers! 877 characterswoosterbill, Aug 21, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. It is a bright lemony yellow, slightly hazy, with a lot of bubbles of carbonation running throughout and feeding a well-retained 1/2 finger fluffy white head. A pretty substantial amount of slippery white lace clings to the sides of the glass. 
Smell: Really nice and appetizing aromas of dry, toasted wheat and bright citrusy lemon come through more strongly than expected. The smell is bright and clean and refreshing. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: Everything about this beer is light and refreshing. The flavors of lightly toasted malts and hearty, but not heavy wheat come together with a subtly bitter and very bright lemony presence that leaves a tart flavor in the aftertaste. There's no trace of alcohol at all. The feel is very well-carbonated and the beer finishes clean with no stickiness or oiliness to weigh it down. 
Drinkability: Extremely high - this beer is so refreshing and tasty that's it's great to drink on its own or with food. Definitely a quintessential summer beer. 1,036 characterskels, Aug 21, 2009

A- copperish dark orange with a thick white head. three fingers.
S- Wild yeast strain, and lots of spice. Cloves and some banana.
T- Lots of spices. and heavy on the wheat. Heavy yeast heavy wheat. Predominant spice is clove.

Smells of peppery clove and sweet bready yeast. Citrus friut. Its too complex for me to descibe honestly.
Nice sour complexity in the flavor. It tastes like a farmhouse brew. Sweet notes with a sour kick. Bread/yeast, orange/lemon zest, and spice.
Smooth mouth coating effect that leaves long before the NICE sour aftertaste.

S- All the usual suspects for a good hefe, banana's, cloves, bubblegum, wheat. But this beer, the bouquet is fantastic! And let me set this straight, "bouquet" is not a word I use normally but this beer has brought me to a place where "bouquet" was the word I needed to use to get my point across.
T- Yeasty Wheat bread, a slight banana and clove hit in the middle and a little bitter slightly metal taste at he end.
M&D - Well carbonated as it should be, but not so much that it foams up in my mouth. Easy drinking with a very clean and pleasant aftertaste. Great beer any time but on a nice summer day it is perfect! 845 charactersthepeter, Aug 18, 2009

Nice lemony twang. Good banana flavour. Lots of clove. No bubblegum. It's very subtle and well balanced - no one flavour overwhelms the others.
Medium body and finely carbonated. Smooth and satisfying. A very subtle hefe that doesn't go over the top with the fruit/candy-like flavours found in this style of beer. I normally like my hefes a little bit more over-the-top, but this really won me over. I enjoyed this a great deal. 586 charactersmintjellie, Aug 13, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 500 ml. bottle into a small weizen glass. Pours hazy, carbonated and a bit light, perhaps lemony-orange in color. Color deepened when yeast bottom was added to the glass. A rich soapy head is unavoidable, slowly caving in to the 
Earth's gravitational pull, and at times, very slowly.
Nose is of banana and yeast, slightly sour and with a touch of light funk after the initial pour. An added pour freshens the beer, offering expected notes of banana and clove. The nose remains quite complex however, yielding a nice sweet/sour balance.
Taste is initially a bit watery but nice and full with lots of carbonation and a light bready texture. Feel improves right away after a swirl or after pouring a fresh ounce or two into the glass. The initial pour outgassed too much I would say. Offers a moderate texture on the palate. 
This beer has a tendency to outgas too much so pour carefully. Good feel and drink couple with a good carbonation level, maintaining a consisted surface cap. Nice drinkability.
Overall I really dig the yeast nose on this beer, but it otherwise falls short of it's juxtaposed Hacker-Pschorr brethren. 1,141 charactersHalfFull, Aug 13, 2009

S- Smell is of banana bread, bubble gum, cloves, a mild citrus note and... rock candy? I don't know, something very sweet.
T - A big doughy, buttery, oaky first taste followed by the taste of fresh citrus and wheat. The taste of banana bread lingers on the palate for a little while.
M - Mouthfeel is big and creamy, almost too creamy.
D - The high carbonation level and thick mouthfeel hinder the drinkability of this one somewhat. Still, a very tasty (and authentic) hefeweissen - probably the best I've ever tried out of a bottle.
Edit - After a few days' passage, and still thinking about how good that Weihenstephaner Hefe was, I got another. It was even better the second time. I decided to come back and increase my taste score to a perfect 5... Seriously, this is one damn good Hefeweissen. 966 charactershossua34, Aug 09, 2009

A nice foamy white head, with never ending tiny bubbles surfacing (and trust me, I drank this slow - the bubbles never stopped.) Cloudy but slightly transparent.
S-Lots of carmelized sugar on the nose, along with fruit - bananas and apricots along with the typcial citrus-lemon smell of a hefe. Very pleasant and complex
T-Smooth and very well-balanced. Lemon evens out some of that carmelized sugar. This is a very nice, not wimpy hefe. Leaves a bit of a sour aftertaste, but I expect that from this style.

500ml brown bottle from 'the World's Oldest Brewery'.
Poured hazy, gold color, with a thick white head. I used a hefe glass, and got basically a perfect pour. Smell of banana, wheat and some yeast, right on for the stlye. Very nice, refreshing citrus flavor - no need for a lemon wedge here. Banana, a tiny bit of bubblegum-like sweetness, and wheat flavors fill the palate. A bit of a spice finish, clove and pepper, rather than any hop bitterness. Crisp, tart mouthfeel, with appropriate carbonation, dry finish. A very good beer to beat the heat, but would also match well with food.
Note to Self: Ranked the #2 Hefeweizen beer when I tried it. 722 charactersBigBry, Aug 06, 2009

Golden yellow, cloudy (but in a good way) with a tall order of foam. Great lacing throughout the drink.
Wheat, citrus, flowers dominate the smell.
Orange and lemon are very noticable on the first part of the drink. Carbonation remains in your mouth and bounces around in your mouth. Great consistancy. Very drinkable on a sunny, cloudy, rainy, clear, or tornadic day. Have to get more. 414 charactersbenteach, Aug 06, 2009

4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wheat beers are my favorite, and this is by far my favorite wheat beer. There is nothing wrong with this beer, it's flawless.
Absolutely brilliant golden-yellow with a great, large, fluffy white head that lingers for quite some time. Superb head retention that slowly reduces to a full silky canopy and lace.
Very vibrant bouquet with major hints of banana, citrus, and a hint of cloves and vanilla. 
Tastes of malty white, clove, majorly quenching citrus and banana.
Great level of carbonation, with a lively, but light-medium body.
I can drink this all day, it's quenching, 'just right' ABV for a perfect session beer. My plan is to eventually have this on tap in my house.... 683 characterspatmcd, Aug 05, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Teresa's Next Door.
A-Pours a nicely cloudy golden with some apricot highlights and a frothy white head.
S-Banana esters and lots of biscuit malt. This is very well balanced, and a cut above your typical hefe.
T-Huge banana flavors in the front, followed by some fresh lemon, then banana again in the finish. A very solid biscuit malt profile is present all the way through.
M-Medium bodied with fine carbonation.
D-It's easy to see how this beer got its reputation. It has great richness and depth of flavor, supported by an outstanding malt backbone.

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a weizen glass.
The appearance is a hazy, translucent and light yellow-orange with a few carbonation streams rising to the top. The initial pour creates a fat bubbly and frothy white head that lasts for about 1 to 2 minutes and then subsequently becomes a cap. Head is very large out of the initial pour, but doesn't give way to much lacing after each taste. The aroma is full of fresh wheat and active yeast, along with big scents of the banana esters and subtle clove spiciness. Very delightful though and through. The taste is great and complex with the breadiness of the yeast and some sweetness from the malt and banana. The clove becomes apparent towards the end along with a slight orange rind flavor. 
The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth - there's a sort of creaminess to this beer. It has a medium-bodied feel with not just enough alluring carbonation on the tongue. As it goes down, it leaves a beautiful crisp touch in the mouth. The drinkability is VERY high. There's a reason why this is the highest rated sessionable beer - it's the total package. Big flavor and drinkability with its relatively low 5.4% ABV and price - sixers or singles. Without a doubt, a winner. I would definitely drink a couple of these in a night's session. 1,259 charactersinfi, Aug 04, 2009

Everything comes together in this hefe. Im not the biggest fan of hefe's but this one does it right. The banana, the clove, the lemon, the malt, the hops all blend together magically. This one also comes with the perfect blast of carbonation. MMM. Deliziös.
This is about the only hefe for me that's equally quaffable and sippable. 496 characterscrossovert, Aug 03, 2009

A: Cloudy honey color capped by a pillowy head that lasts forever and leaves a bit of lacing
S: Mostly banana and yeast with a bit of coriander and a hint of lemon
T: Nice banana and spices (classic hefe flavors) with a very subtle lemon finish
M: Medium bodied and creamy with a modest carbonation
D: Very good example of the style, you can taste the time tested quality. Starting to get more and more into old-world European brews and this is near the top of the list. Been on a Hefe kick lately (it's the summer) and this is one of the best. A must try for summer fun! 764 charactersjdg204, Aug 01, 2009
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a hefe glass.
Pours a cloudy golden orange, with huge off white fluffy, chunky head. Head stays nice throughout - nice sticky lacing.
Brew smells of banana, citrus, yeasts spicy clove. Bready scent as well.
Brew tastes incredibly smooth and creamy. Has a peppery spice - not to much. A nice bready yeast flavor balanced perfectly by the banana and citrus tastes. Wow I'm in hefe heaven. 
This is the best Hefe I have had. I have had it in the past but didnt realize how damn good it is. Obviously I would love to taste test my favorites of this style and rank them accordingly - but this to me is the best example of the style I have had. It could be drank by the truck load. The balance of mouthfeel, tastes and drinkability are truly the most you could want from this style. Superb. 800 charactersmagine, Jul 31, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a tawny golden orange, cloudy of course, with a huge foamy whitish head which falls fairly quickly leaving thick curtains of oily lace.
The first whiff of this beer was incredibly fresh and crisp, with hints of orange and a something else my wife identifies oddly enough as root beer.
I taste muted banana and clove as expected, with clove perhaps being the stronger of the two, very balanced with the slightly bitter wheat and sweet from the malt. The orange in the aroma is present as well. This beer becomes even more rounded and flavorful with warming
The mouthfeel is quite nice, medium bodied and very creamy. Nicely carbonated despite the huge head but not overdone.
Very drinkable as would be expected from such a balanced beer, especially after it warmed a bit. I perhaps like the banana flavors more than the clove. I'm glad I have discovered the hefeweizens in general and that I'm trying the German varieties which must be the gold standards of the style. 977 charactersBlackBearForge, Jul 30, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass.
Appearance: pale, slightly opaque straw-orange color. Thick head settles to a thin foamy layer on top.
Smell: apple and citrus aromas with light floral notes. It smells delicious.
Taste: slightly tangy with a notable citrus flavor. Some nice tree fruit flavor on the finish. 
Mouthfeel: medium-light body with just the right carbonation.
Drinkability: highly drinkable. It's a hot evening here, but I see it being a great drink when working outdoors.
I don't have a whole lot of experience with European hefeweizens, but I find this beer quite tasty and intriguing. 619 charactersflagmantho, Jul 30, 2009
3.98/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This poured a hazy pale straw color with tons of white head. It smelled like lemon and banana with fresh wheat and sour yeast, and some grassy hops and light sugary malt. It tasted like lemon and banana and sour yeast, with fresh wheat and a subtle caramel and sugar malt. It was somewhat thick with smooth carbonation, and had a mild sour aftertaste. Overall this was just about the perfect hefeweizen. It had a nice crisp flavor and great body. It was very nice to drink on a summary day, with the light and refreshing character. This isn't a style that I really like, but this example is about as good as it gets. 616 charactersPencible, Jul 28, 2009

Smell) YUMMY: lemon, banana, cloves, bubblegum, wheat. Great balance of scents.
Tastes) Started sweet and banana-y then tart-lemon, with a bubblegum-wheat finish. Delicious. Definitely more sweet than bitter, but not in an over-the-top way. Heavier cloves than I've noticed with other hefe's.
MF) Smooth, plenty of carbonation, medium mouthfeel.
D) Fantastic. A great hot-day-after-moving beer. And just 5.4% ABV. Definitely a high drinkability.
This may not be my favorite of styles, but if you're in the mood for a wheat beer, this one is pretty fantastic. 677 characterssophisticated, Jul 28, 2009

12 oz brown bottle was at the bar so I didn't look for a freshness date, (bad bad ba). 
Appearance: This beer pours a deep golden orange color with lots of cloudiness. The head is fluffy and about an inch and a half, but quickly recedes, with patches of lacing remain on the sides when sipped.
Smell: Lots of clove in the nose, with light wheat smell as well. 
Taste: Holy ham that's a lot of clove, it very powerful and pushes anything else to the back. There is a light banana bread flavor in the background, but clove is the predominate flavor. 
Mouthfeel: Light and airy, even with all the clove flavor, this brew is still easy to drink. 
Drinkability: Maybe I got an old bottle, but this is the cloviest hefe I have ever had. It makes me not like this beer as much as some other hefes. But I will try this one again, just to make sure it was just not a bad bottle. 887 charactersearthboundagain, Jul 27, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a New Belgium goblet. 
Appearance: This beer pours a deep golden straw color with trademark hefeweizen cloudiness. The head abruptly rises to about an inch and a half, but quickly recedes. A light foam remains on top, and broad patches of lacing remain on the sides when sipped.
Smell: Light floral notes, and lots of wheat on the nose. It has an understated smell, very nice.
Taste: Great tasting hefe with characteristic banana and clove flavors. Very light bitter finish trailing off, gone within seconds. 
Mouthfeel: Light carbonation lasts throughout the glass. Nice mouthfeel. 
Drinkability: I could drink several of them. They are delicious, refreshing, and not heavy at all. 699 charactersrealmpel, Jul 25, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Kels for handing this one over :) Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.
Appearance: Pours a pale straw yellow with a very clear body that shows moderately strong carbonation; it comes with a 1 and 1/2 finger head this very white, but fades especially quickly to a very thin and uneven skim on the surface; a very loose lacing tries to hold to the glass and falls quickly back into the beer.
Smell: A very powderery tartness (yet a little sweet as well, kind of like a SweetTart candy) with a grainy/yeasty scent coming up as well.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Very much a grassy/grainy wheaty flavor; some aspects of yeast and that tartness really comes through in the aftertaste, and I would also say that it affects the mouthfeel as wel as it makes me want to pucker just a little bit (is this what "cloying" is?); mouth is also tingly from the carbonation and it feels very lively.
Drinkability: Quite high, it's a nice tasting beer with a very interesting mouthfeel - it's got a relatively light body and it quenches the thirst on a nice hot day. The ABV is also very manageable, so I would say that it would be easy to get through three of these in a night, if not more as long as I'm not driving 1,207 charactersbamadog, Jul 25, 2009
3.48/5  rDev -20.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5A: Poured into a weizenglass. Has a cloudy orange color with a white head that initially fills basically the whole glass. After A while the head dissipates a little and has an appealing rocky structure. Some lacings. 
S: Lots of malted wheat and barley with notes of spices and banana. Hints of lemon and light phenols. 
T: A rather soft but prominent malt presence of barley and wheat dominates. Lots of white bread and crackers. Well balanced flavors of banana and spices (cloves) take over in the middle. Notes of yeast with an earthy twang. The finish is gentle and a bit short with lots of mild spicy notes, some phenols and a light fruitiness. A minimal taste of alcohol in the finish as well. No real bitterness. 
M: Medium body, not very crisp due to the gentle carbonation. 
D: This is a hard beer for me to review since I generally have a problem with hefeweizens - I don't really like the style. I'm often underwhelmed by their flavors, short finish and mouthfeel. That being said, I think this one is quite good and I can see why it's conceived of as a real classic. It has a well balanced character, and both spices and fruit esters are pleasant and kept at bay (in some hezeweizens they are too prominent in my opinion). Easy to drink and refreshing, but it's not very interesting or exciting. 1,311 charactersricke, Jul 23, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I purchased this beer for the first time from Elephant and Caslte's Pub in Washington, DC. 
Slowly poured into a Weihenstephan pilsner glass, the appearance is a lightly golden cloudy hue. The aroma jumps out with hints of banana and clove. The taste is exceptionally smooth with no lingering bitterness. I have tried plenty of hefeweizen's and I must say this is by far my favorite and I highly recommend this to any beer advocate. 
On a hot summer day this beer will not disappoint. Honestly, on any day this beer will not disappoint. 538 charactersspartikvs, Jul 23, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from bottle into a hefe glass. Head was so big it took a few pours to get into the glass. Color is dead on straw color. The coolest thing about the appearance is that there is a twisting haze throughout the glass.
Gives a strong aroma of clove, banana, wheat and yeast. There is no better definition of style.
Taste is perfect hefeweizen. I could go into more detail, but it would be hard beyond saying there is anything better in german hefe.
Mouthfeel is weaker than I remembered it, but still good. Overall this is a world class beer! 547 charactersmwa423, Jul 22, 2009

4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5500ml bottle poured into a Paulaner Weiss glass.
A: Pours a gold tinted yellow color with a couple finger thick head that settles down to a thin covering relatively quickly. No real lace to speak of.
S: Quite a bit of orange aroma. It is mixed in with banana and spice and other things I can not place to make a very pleasing and inviting aroma.
T: The beer is very well formed. The main flavor is of wheat with fruit, citrus, and spice hints. There are a few Hefes that I have had and prefer so I am leaving room for them in the taste ranking.
M: The in mouth carbonation is a bit aggressive. It is on the thin side of medium as far as body.
D: This one really excels here. It goes down incredibly easy. The 500ml disappeared faster than a lot of 12 oz beers I have consumed. 781 charactersGatorBeerNerd, Jul 22, 2009

Appearance: Cloudy golden color with thick creamy and foamy head that dissipated pretty slowly and laces beautifully.
Smell: Bananas, clove, bubblegum sweetness. Classic Hefe aromas. 
Taste: Sweet, yeasty, wheaty. A perfect example of the HefeWeizen style. So sweet and delicious it does a little dance on the tongue.
Mouthfeel: Slippery, creamy and perfectly carbonated. 
Drinkability: One of the best HefeWeizens in the world. I have been drinking these for years (after living in Germany for a couple of years when I was younger), and it's always a perfect session beer when I'm in the mood for a HefeWeizen. They don't get much better than this. 712 charactersChopperSmith, Jul 20, 2009

s: some spicy yeastiness, apple, some malt, touch of grass, and maybe a hint of orange? maybe that's just my imagination. smells pretty akin to a tripel, actually. 
t: follow smell. very refreshing, pretty crisp, apple being the predominating flavor i would say, just a touch of hop on the aftertaste, touch of citrus. i would prefer a bit more hop presence, but that's probably just me.

Pours a cloudy yellow with some hints of orange and a fizzy but dense white head that quickly dissolves into a good layer atop the glass. The aroma is banana, clove, fruity esters and yeast, slightly bubble-gummy. The taste is sweet upfront and accompanied by some earthy notes and ends a touch tart with a nice semi-dry finish. Its light bodied with very nice effervescence. Very tasty stuff, I know now why people bring this beer up when talking about a "classic" German Hefe. We done, tasty and thirst quenching. 554 charactersDiabolikDUB, Jul 19, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz bottle with 9518 stamped on back label.
Beautiful pour: golden, and surprisingly clear (of course I had yet to pour out the yeast from the bottom). The head was white and fluffy, almost like marshmellow when viewing it. Now I poured the last remaining amount from the bottle and the ale becomes typically cloudy. 
The smell is refreshing bananas, bubblegum and cloves and spicy malt aromas. I don't know the age of the bottle, but odor indicates freshness.
The initial sweet taste of banana like flavor is followed by lingering bubblegum flavor and malts. This was lighter in flavor than I remember, but still flavorful. Very good bready, yeasty flavors come forth as the weizen warms. 
A decent spritzy fell on the tongue with the right amount of carbonation for this style. Again, lighter in body than I remember. 
The blend of flavors and light body make this one very quaffable for the summer. However, I always remember this one having more complexity than I am tasting now. Still a very good brew. 1,014 charactersjkrich, Jul 18, 2009

I cant believe I have not had this in all my years killing my liver. Baby steps, I suppose.
A- Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is a golden colored hefe with a liquid honey look to itself with some light. A nice inch of frothy silky white foam graces the top for a bit before dissipating into a faint skim, very minimal lacing.
S- This smells great with a nice balance of wheat, sweet malt, bananers and light spice including clove. The clove is lighter than I expected. Some light lemon spritz in here. Also getting some sweet honey from this surprisingly.
T- The cloves come out a bit more in taste which is nice. The wheat is up next followed by bananer boats. Not getting any presence of hops in this one making for a smooth ride. Some more sweet malt giving off bananer bread. Some light citrus appeal.
M- Smooth as silk, goes down without a hitch. This is light bodied with low carbonation. No aftertaste at all, this hits you quick and leaves even quicker. No alcohol getting in the way in this low ABV'er. Smooth and tasty enough to down 100oz or so.
D- Easy as pie, this low abv hefe is the golden standard and now I see why. Entirely two drinkable and I would love to drink this out of a boot at a German festival, and get it all over myself. Refreshing is an understatement, would love to find a case of this for the summer months, although I would drink this year round. 1,430 charactersBARFLYB, Jul 16, 2009

4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Live review. Purchased at Cost Plus World Market in Mentor for about $2.99, "One pint, 9 fl. Ounces" bottle poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass.
A 5 inch head after a moderately vigorous pour. The head passed the crest of the glass as one more ounce would have sent it spilling over the top. It took a good 2 minutes to settle from there, leaving some nice lacing. Dark yellow translucent body, a bit darker than the "Original Premium" that I sampled moments ago. 4.5
S At first I thought I picked up some smoky notes as in a Rauchbier but repeated sniffs revealed that this was not the case. I smell the sweet citrus and wheat that I am now familiar with from a Hefe and I love it. This is a classic Hefe if there could be one. Any fruit or citrus smell is not dramatic. The wheat dominates. 4.5
T/M/D Ahhh...this is a great Hefe. Nice "soft" wheat taste over a very light syrupy feel and light malt and very little hops. I get only a shade of banana and spice profile is not high (cloves can be common in Hefe's). This makes it ultimately very drinkable since to me the wheat taste is delicious and gentle enough to experience repeatedly. The ABV is low enough to again make it very drinkable as well. 4.5 4.0 5.0
Notes: I was prepared for a classic Hefe and this beer delivers on that suggestion. I am very impressed by how drinkable that it is. 1,355 charactersadamette, Jul 03, 2009

S: ahh this is the real good stuff, cloves hit you right away, with a wheat bread overtones, banana bread with a weak orangeness in there. No hops detected. Which is a good thing.
T: Heaven in a glass. The clove is the main taste as first, with bread, and some hops, but mostly its like a loaf of banana wheat bread with cloves and lemon orange on top. Number 1 hefeweissbier to me period.
Liquid gold here folks.
M: medium body, very refreshing, yeast is there but not overpowering. Light carbonation.
D: easy to drink this beer until you run out of it. 682 charactersazorie, Jul 03, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer poured a cloudy yellow with orange highlights and a a big fluffy head. The smell is sweet and yeasty, with some of the wheat character coming through as well as a bit of citrus and spiciness. The taste starts off with some sweet wheat malt that gives way to a hint of lemon that goes into a mix of spiciness and a tiny bit of hops to balance. This is what a hefe should taste like. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with some fine carbonation. This is a great beer for a warm night or anytime at all. Definitely a benchmark setting hefeweizen, one that all others you try end up being compared to. 605 charactersTheTrevor, Jul 01, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle - $1.79 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.
Appearance: Pours out a hazy, dark-hued, golden body with a tall, airy, whitish head.
Smell: Vibrant, aromatic scent of wheat malt, ruthlessly mashed bananas liberally seasoned with vanilla sugar and clove, and even lemon peel.
Taste: Sweet, tangy taste of wholesome wheat malt. What follows is rich, full flavors of ripe bananas, vanilla cream, and fresh cracked cloves. Small, meager spritz of lemon juice. A few added shreds of Big League Chew. One slice from a Red Delicious apple. Very light Noble hop character and bitterness. Just the perfect amount of overall spiciness to the taste. Finishes dry, crisp, with one final taste of malted wheat.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel, yet it remains nicely effervescent.
Drinkability: Terrifically drinkable, really! I cleared through my twelve ounces with record speed as this makes for delightful early-summer refreshment. 978 charactersChainGangGuy, Jun 30, 2009

s- sweet floral wheat, good amount of spice, light citrus, banana, great nose. 
t- light wheat, floral sweetness at the start of the beer that got more dry as i drank, complex but very light, goes down so easy, perfect for a hot day sitting outside on the porch (which is what i'm doing right now).
m- nice medium body, a little slick on the tongue, good. 
d- super drinkable and sessionable, probably the best hefe i've ever had, will definately buy some more and keep it in the fridge for the summer, lived up to all the great reviews. 909 charactersthecarster1, Jun 28, 2009

Appearance is murky gold with a fluffy white head.
Nose is confectionery sweet but still spicy with hints of clove and banana.
Flavor and mouthfeel are just a wonderful experience for this beer. It's got a bold feel, but goes down easy, it's sweet but has a dry finish. Creamy and delicious. One of the most refreshing beers I can imagine. Negligible bitterness, perfect for the style.
This is a style that is perfected by the brewers of Munich. Just like it's hard to find a good American brewed Weissbier, it's hard to find a flawed German brewed one. We have this on the shelf in Mass. but I've never thought bought a bottle, now I know to bring some home! 762 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Jun 28, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Since they have been making beer at this site since 1040 you might agree they have the recipe correct. The plus is at 5.4% you can enjoy it most anytime, from your favorite lawnmower beer to enhancing good food.
The lacy head should be allowed to come to full potential to allow the esters in the beer to release the aromas and taste you expect.
It has enough carbonation to provide a crisp refreshing taste with a dry finish. It has hazy golden color as expected of an unfiltered beer. The taste is subltly citus up front, creamy texture, wheat is prevalent with hints of yeastiness, very slight bananna and clove hints. The beer is slightly sweet without being cloying.
They also make a dark version which I especially enjoy. 730 charactersmjnich, Jun 26, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What a difference a fresh bottle makes. I first tried this beer a couple of days ago after reading all the great reviews and was completely underwhelmed. I realized after that the bottle I had bought was 3.5 years old! Needless to say, I was determined to try a fresh bottle. The review that follows is based on that fresh bottle. 
A: Poured from a bottle into a hefe glass. The pour went well and a beautiful thick head was formed in the glass typical of the style. The beer is a nice looking golden yellow with an orange tint. It looks very appetizing.
S: Banana and clove. It also smells a little citrusy, lemon I think. I also get a bit of yeast.
T: Citrusy up front, but not too much. I get more of the banana and clove spicyness in the middle. It finishes crisp with a not unpleasent aftertaste that reminds me vaguely of the sugary bubblegum I used to chew as a kid. The evident wheat pulls everything together the whole way through. This is one tasty beer. 
M: Lots of carbonation, which was expected. The beer is crisp and light. It is smooth and really fun to drink.
D: I could drink this all the time. This beer has made me fall in love with the style. I cracked this open on a humid, 95 degree day and it was incredibly refreshing. I wish I has another to follow up the first.
I am very happy I gave this beer a second shot with a fresh bottle. I can't tell you what a difference it made. The aromas alone in a fresh bottle make the beer. I look forward to picking some more up soon. 1,501 charactersjcpaulun, Jun 25, 2009

4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice hazy golden color with a huge, long lasting cream colored head. Lacing is looking great as well as the mesa-creating collapsing of foam.
The nose provides bountiful banana aromas as well as a restrained amount of cloves and wheat. There is some sweet tropical fruitiness in there as well, perhaps some papaya.
The yeasty esters are a bit more restrained than say, the Ayinger Brau-Weisse and Live Oak versions that I have had most recently. Has a nice creamy texture and is low on lemony citrus flavors. Very tasty beer that can be enjoyed regardless of the season here in the south. It balances all the flavors typically found in a hefe very nicely and maintains a crisp wheat refreshing feel to the beer. 721 characterstwiggamortis420, Jun 21, 2009

The beer poured a deep and cloudy yellow with a robust head. The scent was a barely noticeable yeast. Very creamy mouthfeel for a Hefe, which I enjoy. Went down smooth and finished with light citrus.
I tend to drink stouts, doublebocks and strong dark ales but I have been looking for something lighter for summer and this is definitely it. I have had a number of Hefeweizens, Pilsners, Pale ales, this is the best for relaxing on a hot summer's day. 596 charactersMikeTaz, Jun 17, 2009

Poured a deep straw yellow, big white fluffy head and excellent carbonation(almost to much). Looked a bit cloudy and damn delicous. Nose was rather muted with clove, wheat and banana. Taste is banana, clove, wheat mix and well balanced together. Mouthfeel is medium but the low ABV and smoothness of this beer makes it very drinkable and tasty. ABout as good as it gets for a traditional hef. 411 charactersbarleywinefiend, Jun 15, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I bought a quantity of this last year and completely forgot to review it. Well it's almost exactly a year later and I happened to come across it again, What a wonderful beer.
This pours a perfectly cloudy amber, with a thick creamy head that situates itself nicely on top leaving a trail down the glass as it is consumed. Smell is pretty much what is expected from a fine, well crafted German Hefeweizen, banana, cloves, and a subtle sweetness. Flavor is exceptional, banana bread, cloves, spices, delicious wheaty goodness, absolute perfection. Mouthfeel is very full and thick, every aspect of the flavor of this beer is prominent and fills out perfectly. As for drinkability I could drink this all day, it's wonderful.
Best part about this beer is that I'm drinking it right now. The only bad point is that in a few months it will be nearly a year before I can easily get more. As a Hefeweizen this is the pinnacle of the style, it doesn't get better than this. A must have. 979 charactersfunkengruven, Jun 15, 2009

A-It's got a nice golden look to it. 
S-It's got a nice banana smell to it with a little bit of apple.
T- It taste like banana too with a hint of Olive and Bubble gum w/ the hops. (As weird as that may sound it's quite good) it's a little sweet but not too sweet and you still taste beer. It smacks the mouth with flavor.
M-no aftertaste at all and it goes down smooth.
D- It's worth it! It's a treat to have. If any of you find this at a store you must buy it! It is an amazing beer.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is possibly the best Beer I have ever tasted and I will get another one from the store. It is as I said a treat. I am on a diet sadly and I rarely have a beer to help me drop pounds but, I love a good brew when I can and this is a beer I will love to treat myself to. 914 characterssteanu, Jun 13, 2009

There is a great light popping sound as the head lowers. Rice Krispies?
A fruity smell with hints of pears, bananas, grapes and others. 
Great taste again from this awesome brewery. Smooth, silky and creamy. Goes down smooth with just a touch of a spicy kick after the swallow.
The lower alcohol makes this an easy drinking beer with multiple consumption allowed.
Very well done and highly recommended. 594 characterskaseydad, Jun 13, 2009

A - Cloudy orange body with a three finger head that slowly backs down to half a finger.
S - I can smell the beer without putting my nose close to it. Lots of banana, clove, yeasty bread, bubblegum, citrus peel, and coriander. Very full and enticing nose.
T - Lots of sweet, bubblegum-like flavors here. The fruit notes that were present on the nose give way to candy and spice flavors. The candy flavors are a bit much for my taste, but they are well-integrated with the complex spice profile.
M - Very crisp and clean, with lingering sweetness from the candy flavors.
D - I can appreciate this beer for how well-constructed it is (and has been for nearly a millennium!). It's not usually what I would choose to drink, but I'm not the biggest fan of hefeweizens, in general. This brew is a great representation of the style, though, and remains essential to any and all hefeweizen fans. 963 charactersvrazionale, Jun 12, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a hazy, yellow colour with enormous white head and good, busy carbonation bead. Head sinks slowly and evenly across the top, but sticks around impressively for the most part. Clings to the glass when tilted, but doesn't leave huge amounts of lacing. Quite exemplary wheat beer.
Very spicy nose with a huge clove hit. Hints around the edge of coriander, banana and a very metallic, chemical aroma. Mostly that sweet but spicy aroma though. Again, exemplaring. Reviewing this now having drunk it so often in the past makes me realise that I've unconsciously spent years reviewing weizens against this one. This just embodies hefe smell.
Taste has far more banana character on it than the nose. Taste is sweet and light with a threshed wheat kind of character followed by a long, tangy banana flavour for most of the palate with hints of basil, coriander and oregano. The back is a nice spicey brush of the tastebuds with a strong clove character and hints of fresh cut grass.
Mouthfeel is quite tingly and almost bitey thanks to the beer's apparent acidity. Otherwise feels slightly thin, I suppose it's appropriate but I think there's enough flavour to expect a thicker body. Overall, while it's beautifully complex and rich in flavour, the sensation it gives me is ever-so-slightly offputting because it is quite tart, like unrripe fruit, and slightly bitey, rendering it not quite quaffable. But it's a prime example of the joy that wheat can produce, and a fine, fine piece of brewing art. 1,500 characterslaituegonflable, Jun 12, 2009

S: Wheat, cloves, and bananas, as well as yeast. Some lemon undertones and malts can also be sensed. 
T: Quite spicy, with notes of clove, nutmeg, and a touch of cinnamon. Loads of fruit notes (banana, citrus, and apple) and wheat. The yeastiness is moderate, which is a definite advantage. Finishes slightly dry and bready, with some fruity undertones.
M: Light-to-medium bodied, but definitely not watery for a wheat-beer. The carbonation is just perfect, very balanced. Goes down quite smooth, even though the alcohol shows a little bit.
D: A very drinkable hefe-weizen. Has everything there is to ask in a weizen, and is very refreshing, especially in the summer. A truly proper wheat beer! 859 charactersNightINgale, Jun 12, 2009

T: Sweet bananas, clove, wheat, yeast, pepper
M: After pouring, it was slightly thin, but I took a sip out of the bottle and the carbonation was great...I think it would be pretty good had I been careful with my pour. It's pretty full bodied and has a little bite from the carbonation
D: Highly drinkable, especially for a summer beer. The traditional hefe flavor can be a bit much for me if I drink a lot of it, but for what this beer is, it's great 703 charactersdukedevil0, Jun 11, 2009

Appearance has a nice head that dissipates in an interesting fashion by fizzing faster in some parts of the pilsner glass than in other areas. The color is mostly clear golden, but some haze in it. Taste is a good, clean, but still openly German. I could drink this beer all day if I had nothing to do or was afraid of the hangover I have discovered in my older age.

Rusty yellow gold with a good sized antique white head. 
Outstanding nose on this beer! Flavor profile redolent of a fruit salad consisting of bananas, pears, golden apples and more bananas! The bready malt is there as well balanced with hops that don't show up much in the aroma.
Taste is very wheaty and fruity. Combined with the light fluffy body and the appearance of spices like clove and coriander this makes for a very appealing and refreshing brewski. I had fun sifting through the different fruit profiles and the yeast contributed nicely to the finish.
Medium to light body. Creamy and fluffy. 
Almost like a wheat lambic with a heavier, wetter finish. Very tasty and findable. This makes a great lawnmower brew for the wheat heads. 781 charactersnatelocc787, Jun 09, 2009

Onwards: 
It's a beautiful beer to look at. It's sunny and hazy with a lovely thick head. Celestial looking. The smell is a wonderful prelude to the first sip; it is loaded with wheat and a definitive banana whiff (not artificial or overly sweet either). The taste is perfect. It's easy to drink, filling, not too heavy on the carbonation. The banana bite is just right, unlike other hefes that have failed to nail this crucial part. Mouthfeel is on the thin side but not a problem at all. 
This one's in my top 3, if that means anything to you haha.

D- A great drink.
Overall i'm quite impressed. I've been looking forward to trying this brew and with good reason. This is by far hands down one of the absolute benchmark Hefeweizens.

One of those benchmark beers against which others are measured, the appearance, with it's huge rocky head and cloudy, hyperactive golden body are gorgeous.
On the clove-forward end of the spectrum, just a hint of banana and no real bubblegum presence. Intoxicating.
Rich flavor that I look for in a real German hefe with lemony edges around a smooth, soft wheat body. Just a touch of sweetness to the finish with the clove suggested on the back end.
Not quite as carbonated as others but with a full, round mouthfeel that so many American imitators fall short of. This is as drinkable as the style gets and consistently hits the spot. 673 charactersmalcontent, Jun 03, 2009

The smell is exactly what you would expect, with yeast, clove and banana with some floral notes. Nice but not overdone. A powdery baseball card bubblegum starts to show up towards the end.
Starts with a wheaty lemony tartness, there's a pinch of bitterness and spice in the middle all leading to a clean, dry finish with mild elements of banana all throughout. The clove lingers nicely in the aftertaste as does a hint of orange peel zest. 
Has a crisp and clean mouthfeel and a medium amount of carbonation, perfect for a hot and hazy day.
If I had to sum this beer up in a word that word would be refined. If I had to use more words I would say it's pretty much a textbook hefeweisen and a benchmark for the style. Highly drinkable. But it's a notch below Franziskaner and Denison's in my eyes. 933 charactersMeisterBurger, Jun 03, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy, hazed yellow with a puffy, pillowy head
Smell is very strongly banana with underlying citrus notes of lemon and lime rind, slight sour apple, and a lot of corriander and yeasty aromas 
Taste: The banana flavour is not overly sweet but borders almost on a tartness or sourness, the yeast characteristics give this beer a lot of depth and complexities that some other hefes lack. Next to no hop profile, but the vanilla in the middle is great, and this is a beer that you can actually taste the wheat.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a very soft, light carbonation 579 charactersEatsTacos, Jun 02, 2009

Appearance: The beer pours out a rich hazy gold color with a 2" thick white fluffy head that recedes slowly leaving sides of glass coated and a thick pillow of foam over the liquid. Sipping leave some partial sheets of lacing with smaller patches here and there. The head seems bound and determined to remain to the end of the beer.
Smell: The aroma is fresh and refreshing and contains clove, some citrus (orange I think) with some nice banana notes. 
Taste: The flavor of the beer is soft and pleasant and is consistent with the aroma. There are notes of clove, some nice hints of banana and some taste of orange. Some very light hopping shows up once in a while to cut the sweetness.
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is soft and creamy with nice light carbonation. The finish is medium to short, begins with the full flavors of the beer and tapers off with a long, lightly sweet but citrus tart ending.
Drinkability: This is a very drinkable Hefe and I could easily have more. I don't know that I enjoy it more than some of the others I've tried (e.g., Ayinger Brau Weisse) but I'm going to enjoy finding out. I will certainly be drinking this one again and it is on my shopping list. 1,309 charactersdrtth, Jun 02, 2009

4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle Pours a hazy straw color with a generous white head. The head lasts well. Has a good aroma of wheat and sweet fruits. Has good carbonation. The flavor is not as sweet as I thought it would be, it is muted nicely by light bitterness and nice hints of spices. This is well balanced. Has a dry texture. I would give it a light body. Has a good finish with a nice aftertaste. This is a easy drinking good beer. 413 charactersBirdiebeagle, Jun 01, 2009

S: A light malty sweetness with hints of yeast.
T: Like the nose, a light sweetness with earthy yeast, finishing with a small amount of hops.

T: What you smell is what you get. I'd be more of a fan of this style if they all tasted like this.
M: Appealing light carbonated mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing.

A- Pours a golden orange with a nice 2-finger head. Cloudy but crisp. Exactly how a hefe should look.
S - Bready, yeasty and definitely cloves. A bit of fruitiness and banana, maybe a bit of citrus.
T- Just like it smells. Bread in a bottle, with lots of yeast. Wheat is forward, with lots of cloves and a mild amount of banana and sugar. Citrus to add a bit of tartness. Most refreshing at pour, gaining yeast and bread as it warms.
M- Super smooth, crisp. Light coating of the tongue allowing flavors to linger. Moderate carbonation that enhances the overall taste. About perfect.
D- Very refreshing on this warm day, and easy to down but begs to be savored. Can't taste the alcohol, and easily could consume two or three of these. Best hefe I can recall having and my new reference point. 905 charactersblackc5, May 31, 2009

Nose: A very nice wheat aroma with citrus, phenols, and floral esters. The wheat does come across as slightly bready. 
Taste. A very rich wheat flavor with some breadiness. The other flavors are a little phenol, floral esters, and citrus.
Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated, crisp, and slightly astringent. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This is a very nice all around wiezen. The head didn't last long but overall it was very good. 691 characterscolts9016, May 31, 2009

4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5God Damn I love starting the night this way.
The pour on this bad boy yields a full inch of beautiful off white cloudy head that slowly but surely dissipates and laces beautifully the whole way down. It's a straw-gold color and all kinds of hazy. This is a gorgeous hefe. What else can I say.
The nose is full of the crispest and freshest banana and clove. Another reminder why I'm always coming back to hefes. There's wheat on the nose as well in addition to a slight hint of citrus that certainly piques my interest. 
Wow. This is a near perfect beer. Drinkability is literally off the charts. Goes down so incredibly smooth and leaves you feeling more refreshed than any BMC could ever dream of. The wheat flavor stays with you well after you take that first gulp..second gulp...third gulp. Somebody stop me ! There's even a little bit of citrus that lingers on the top of my mouth. 
Honest to god, this is quite possibly the best Hefeweizen I have ever had. I've been drinking so much Franziskaner lately and this is so different yet still manages to stick out as a beautiful beautiful hefe. And to think I got this bottle for under 2 dollar....It's going to be a spectacular summer. 1,191 charactersoriginalsin, May 25, 2009

Pours a straw golden color with slight orange notes, 2 fingers of head foam out of the glass.
The hefe yeast dominates the nose, with some breadiness and spice. A hint of light fruit.
A sweet and spicy profile - malt and cloves with banana as well. 
Refreshing, complex, and enjoyable. The hot weather made this even more enjoyable. 357 charactersmhatters, May 24, 2009
4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a cloudy copper with a large off-white head that slowly dissipates into a thin layer of foam. No lacing is left on the glass.
S - Lots of spice with plenty of fruit aromas in there as well. Clove, coriander, citrus, and banana are the dominant notes, with some subtle apple aromas coming through as well.
T - Lots of clove and coriander. The fruit sweetness is far more subdued on the palate than it was in the aroma, but it's still there in the background. The yeast sediment provides a great deal of earthy breadiness.
M - Medium-bodied with a clean finish. Carbonation is just about right.
D - One of the great hefes of the world. Immensely enjoyable and a terrific example of the style. I can think of few other beers that I'd rather be drinking on a hot Texas afternoon. 789 characterspwsoldier, May 24, 2009

Appearance is orangish yellow body with a very thin white head that disappears very quickly.
Smell is full of wheat malt, banana, clove, a little bit of plum and floral hops.
Taste is fresh wehat, lightly malty, lemon and grassy hops with a faint hint of banana and little bits of vanilla.
Mouthfeel is smooth and sweet.
An easy drinker for a large audience. 403 characterschaz410, May 23, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from 500mL bottle into Weizen glass.
Initial pour is hazy orange amber with the classic large weizen white frothy head.
Aroma is rich with cornmeal, wheat bread, clove, banana and some floral notes. 
Flavor opens with cornmeal and wheat. Clove dominates in the midpalate and the flavor finishes with clove, wheat and I almost want to say some cantaloupe. 
The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, but the body is a bit watery, in my opinion. Such a fully flavored beer could be supported by a bit more strength on the palate. 531 charactersapowar, May 19, 2009

M: Rather light-bodied with good carbonation. Refreshing.
D: I'd say this is the gold standard of wheat beers. Outstanding for summer or any other season. And in the morning, this is the next best thing to orange juice. Between this and Original Premium, Weihenstephaner has an untouchable portfolio of session beers. 517 charactersBarrelO, May 19, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Got this for the lady friend. Decided I had to review while I was at it.
Appearance - Very nice. A sort of hazy straw color with a nice full white head that slowly dissipates. Pretty much how a hefe is supposed to look.
Smell - A nice tart lemon with some real clove and spice as well. Lots of the yeast goodness, with almost a hint of funk. 
Taste - The sweet/tart lemon at the front. Some nice mellow bread follows, with that spice goodness. Very light on the tongue, but some real complexity beneath it.
Mouthfeel - Nice and mellow. Very light but good carbonation and richness.
Drinkability - Absurd. Goes right down every time. Smooth as anything.
This is a really great, mellow, every day kind of beer. It's world famous for a reason. Lots of hefes really go overboard, but this one is restrained and all the better for it. 835 characterscallmescraps, May 19, 2009

Smell is of wheat, citrus, and some phenolics.
Taste is more of the nose. The wheat comes through really well with a nice citrus note on top of it. The phenols lay over top with the banana and clove taste rounding it out. This is a very well balanced brew.
Mouthfeel is creamy and leaves a nice coating on the tongue.

4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought a six pack with a strange bottling code. 9049 apparently means January 29th 2009.
Poured this thing into the necessary weizen glass, with a swirl at the end to get all the yeast in there. A 3, 4, or perhaps a 5 finger rocky head raises up at first, fizzes down to about two fingers and then eventually one. Carbonation bubbles sprint up the middle of the tall glass. Yeast is visible. At first it looks like clouds floating downward in the glass, then it all diffuses to make a completely unclear, yellow-orange beer.
Aroma of clove like spice, banana, and bubblegum makes an appetizing beer. Taste is sweet, with less going on but it's just about perfect. Banana-bubblegum beer comes through. The mouthfeel is outstanding. It coats the mouth with a creamy, smooth sensation. A tingly, cold carbonation makes this finish amazing.
This beer sets the standard for drinkability. A lot of times I don't put much thought or have much to say about drinkability, but this beer makes me realize how important it can be. This beer is very easy to drink. They say beer is an acquired taste but I swear if you gave this to my high school self who had never had beer before, I'd be able to put back as many as you put in front of me. This beer can match up with a ton of foods and be enjoyed in many different situations. Drink with Banana bread for breakfast, a long day chilling by the pool, A dinner beer or to party the night away. This would fit it all. 1,456 charactersjeffthecheff, May 14, 2009
4.29/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass.
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier pours a cloudy golden orange, with a creamy thick head. Each sip leaves creamy sticky foam on the glass that is too thick to call "lace." It looks like the foam left behind by rolling surf at the beach.
The smell is nice but too subtle to excite. On the other hand, there is nothing subtle about the taste--banana and clove explode in the mouth, along with a tart, slightly bitter aftertaste. This Hef tickles and awakens the palate. 
The only problem is that Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier begs to be both savored and guzzled. Finding a compromise between having your cake (Hef) and eating (drinking) it too, is a thoroughly enjoyable conundrum caused by this wonderful beer. 753 charactersMetalHopHead6, May 13, 2009

16.9 ounce bottle poured into $1.29 tumbler. Hey, what can I say, I'm on the road for work...
A: Pours a golden straw color, big fluffy off-white head, at least 2" thick. Head dissipates quickly leaving a half finger's worth of tightly bubbled lacing. Decent amount of carbonation in this one, as bubbles are streaming up from the bottom of the glass.
S: Fairly light aroma, yeasty breadiness with sharp wheat notes and sweet banana and melon scents.
T: Damn fine example of the style. Wheaty, yeasty, sweet and then tart in the finish. Great malt base and good wheat bite. The banana and melon flavors round this out nicely.
M: Light, but not thin, very smooth, but not creamy. Finishes beautifully.
D: Summer session extravaganza!
In my eyes, the hefe most others are measured by... 850 charactersbwd110, May 13, 2009

Huge three to four fingers of very white head. Looks great. Slightly hazy. Huge amount of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Great head retention with some lacing, but not much.
Smell is very yeasty with a lot of wheat malt. I'm getting some aromas of phenolic cloves as well. Not too much in the way of fruitiness or floral character. Pleasant, nonetheless.
Taste is great. Like the nose, the flavors are yeasty with a wheat bite. Definitely tasting the typical cloves with some ripe banana. A bit of tart apple, likely due to the wheat malt. Very yeasty on the finish. Not much of an aftertaste, maybe a little tart. Drying on the finish.
Mouthfeel is good and crisp. Light to medium bodied. A bit dry. Very refreshing. 
A very good hefeweizen. Very refreshing and excellent on a hot summer day. A great beer from the world's oldest brewery. 976 charactersjimj21, May 12, 2009

Aroma is a luscious bouquet of soft banana, tempting yeast, hints of citrus, and bread, with a sweet backbone that sets my taste buds into action.
What a flavor! Full of a marvelous yeast deliciousness that is balanced perfectly atop banana, peach, gentle spice, and soft malty goodness. I gave it a soft pour into my Kapuziner glass so as to avoid sediment, now I have added the sediment, and it tastes even better. Absolutely wonderful taste! Words do this no justice. The finish is long, just sweet enough, just fruity enough, with none of the sourness I remember in others of this style.
Mouthfeel is amazing. What can I say? It is clingy but not cloying, fizzy but not acidically so, and just rich enough. The work of masters for sure.
Drinkability? I could drink this till the cows come home. 918 characterscavedave, May 07, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 1 pint 9 oz bottle into a Weizen glass to celebrate a birthday.
Pours an incredibly hazy orange color, definitely not what I was expecting. Head is amazing, a conservative pour produced a three inch head. Retention is more than impressive, and lacing is spectacular. Lots of suspended sediment, some dark like pepper flakes.
The nose is very heavy on spices and yeast, as well as malted wheat. I also get a citrus note, maybe lemon. Ah, the nose on this one makes me anxious to take a sip!
Ah, there is no doubt why this is considered not only one of the best Hefeweizen's in the world, but one of the best brews period. Spicey yeast and cloves are very apparent. Very fruity and slightly dry. Lots of fruity esters at play here. Superb.
Mouthfeel is light to medium. Ample carbonation. Extremely drinkable.
Honestly, after having this, it's going to be hard to drink any other wheat beer. There is no doubt why this is one of the most highly regarded beers in the world. 988 charactersMistofminn, May 07, 2009

The body pours a pale golden yellow with a good amount of haze. The head formed a solid paper white pillow of foam and left huge chunks of lace.
Aroma is of lemon peel, bananas, coriander, biscuity yeast, and a dash of white pepper. Very clean aroma overall.
Doughy, undercooked buscuity yeast base with banana, clove, lemon peel and a light spice. Solid on all fronts. It doesn't wow me, but it definitely hits all aspects of a hefe and does it well.
Medium bodied with a big creamy mouthfeel. Very smooth and quaffable. I could drink this all day. Extremely clean with no off flavors or aromas. Near perfect. 654 charactersColForbinBC, May 06, 2009

Aroma is mostly wheaty bread, then some banana and spicy cloves with a final hint of citrus. Personally I was expecting more from what I had heard about this beer.
Wheat also dominates taste, but unfortunately not all that much of the banana and clove transfers through.
Great mouthfeel, perhaps a bit too watery, but spot on carbonation.
Very refreshing but it'd be good if it had a more banana/clove/bubblegum notes. 479 charactersCrazyDavros, May 02, 2009
4.66/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5550 ml is the last bottle from my first trade with Bobsy - thanks again for the great trade!
Pours a cloudy straw color with agressive carbonation - a good four finger of dense, foamy head. I can honestly say the bubbles are RUSHING to get to the top - exploding. Keeps a thick layer of head for some time. Simply spectacular.
Smell is a nice mix of fresh summer grains, fruity esters, and citrus zest. Hints of hay and strawberries.
Taste is so smooth and delightful. A rush of wheat with just enough citrus zip to add but not dominate, enough yeast to flavor but not dominate, hints of flowers - simply delightful. The carbonation is lively but not too much so (thinking Duvel) - actually quite a smooth drinking experience but with a bit of bubbles. Round and yet refreshing.
This, for me, has got to be wheat beer to beat. Nearly perfect on all counts. As the bottle wanes a slight hint of a too thin body but all in all, the perfect summer evening beer to suit the taste buds without weighing you down. Thanks Rob. 1,023 charactersritzkiss, May 02, 2009

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a beautiful white gold color with a towering white 2.5 finger head. Nice long retention and traces of spotty lacing here and there.
Smell is perfect for the style. Wheaty, malty, every so slightly tangeriney and lemony. I faintly detect clove.
Taste is similarly perfect for the style. Wheaty and yeasty with tangerine, lemon and clove. I often find it hard to review good hefeweizens because I feel as though they usually have similar elements comprising their overall flavor profile, though in different proportions from beer to beer, if that makes sense. This is the benchmark in my book. A perfect balance of hefeweissbier goodness, with no unexpected nasty surprises that you might find in a poor example of the style. 
At least in the bottle, I feel like this beer is usually overcarbonated. Strong effervescence to a degree that it is distracting. This definitely adds to the crispness, though, and I could see myself appreciating it more in the hot weather, outside. As it stands, though, it takes away from my overall appreciation of the flavor intricacies of the brew.
Very drinkable. Heavier than a super-sessionable lager, but I could probably sip on this forever. 
Definitely my favorite hefeweissbier, and at 6 bucks a liter, a staple in my fridge. A couple times a month I get a mean craving for this beer; it is definitely one of my all time favorites. 1,379 charactersphotomike, Apr 30, 2009

M- I love the mouthfeel of this, nice, silky, smooth mouthfeel. Not overly thick, but not overly thin, in a nice middle ground
D- Nice beer, especially for a summer day, i wish i could find this in 6-pack instead of single bottles. 489 charactersbrewerb223, Apr 29, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 2 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy yellowish gold with a bubbly, frothy white head spilling over the top of my weizen glass. Gorgeous. Smells of spices, bananas, citrus - smells awesome. 
Mouthfeel was a low point for me. Not crisp at all. Very watered down and slick. I was disappointed with this characteristic, though it created an easy quaffing environment. Flavor full of spicy citrus goodness, but nothing that was heavy or harsh. Just perfectly tame. Wonderful Hefe that I will come back to again and again this summer. 507 charactersOnenote81, Apr 28, 2009

4.84/5  rDev +10%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy gold with a luxurious and craggy head, white as snow.
The smell is lemon zest and banana with yeast lurking at the edges. Fruity, but oh so good, and tinged with a peppery spiciness that makes this a joy to smell.
Spiced citrus flavors dominate the palate. They give way to an equal helping of wheat and banana, that goes down ever-so-smooth. A slight banana peel-like astringency is joined by a lingering spiciness. The carbonation is perfect; it coats the mouth gently.
I hesitate to rate this so highly given I'm not familiar with the style, but I can't think of much I'd want to change. 606 charactersIMincedTheKing, Apr 26, 2009

4.78/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 520oz on tap at Rich O's Public House in New Albany.
A: Just as sexy as before, a deep, hazy golden body with a super large, creamy white head.
S: On tap, the fruity, banana aroma is intensified, so much so that you can catch a whiff of bananas from across the table. Oh man this hefe is fresh and it smells awesome! I can still pick out the spicy notes from cloves and citrus rinds underneat the banana, and there is also a yeasty, bready aroma that begins to peak through the sweetness.
T: Huge, fruity sweetness up front (again bananas, oranges, lemons). My friend who tasted this on tap swore that he was tasting a hint of orange juice. This sweetness is followed by a mellowing spiciness from the cloves. Then the malts and bready notes kick in and round out the finish.
M: The carbonation off the tap is solid, creating a crisp, effervescent mouthfeel that goes down with velvety smoothness.
D: This beer is heavenly.  A pleasing and complex balance of fruit, spice and wheat flavors married to a low ABV make this weizen an absolute treat to enjoy.  The ideal summer beer - and really, a supremely drinkable beer for any occasion.
Hands down, this is my favorite German beer.  From a bottle - as it is relatively easy to find around here - it is fantastic hefeweizen.  But when you can find it on tap - oh!  Absolutely sublime, on an entirely other level.  Weihenstephaner is often bragged about as the pinnacle of German weizens - one taste will tell you why.  Highly recommended. 1,493 charactersBuschyfor3, Apr 25, 2009
3.87/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Poured into a .5L weizen glass.
A: Big four fingers of frothy white head that seems to grow out of the weizen glass. Brew is ever so slightly hazy golden.
S: Spices of mostly clove. Heavy wheat that already makes my mouth water. Citrus zest cuts through, but the spice is really dominating the nose.
T/M: Banana, spices (again, the cloves), and wheat flavors. Mouthfeel is light, and not as crisp as I want from a hefeweizen (despite my decent pour). Bitter hops are present to balance, and the sip ends dryly. 
D: Not my favorite Hefe in the world, but not bad either. I thought it was a little undercarbonated, but refreshing and spicy nonetheless. 651 characterswashburnkid, Apr 23, 2009

A - Beautiful. I can't believe how fluffy the head is at about 4 fingers. I wanted to turn into a little dude and go sledding on it. Beer is golden-orange and perfectly hazy. 
S - Citrus and banana. Not overly fragrant, but a very nice aroma
T - Lemon, orange, cloves, spice - what I expected, in a great way. Perfectly balanced.
M - Excellent. Sticks around just long enough to enjoy the great flavor, then it's gone, and you want more.

Stellar retention... Good stickiness... The color is pale golden yellow... Faint orange hue... Hazy... 
S - Lemon zest... Clove... Coriander... Mint... Grainy... Yeast... Banana... Orange... Faint peppery notes...
T - Taste was far more subdued than I would have expected based both on the nose and reputation of this beer... Textbook Hefeweizen with well balanced hints of banana, citrus, wheat, and yeast... The spiciness is much weaker than the nose would lead you to believe though faint clove and peppery notes can be detected... 
M - Light bodied... Slightly creamy... Perfect amount of carbonation on the tongue (more than a little, but not too much)... Exceptionally crisp... Refreshing and smooth... 
D - Very easy drinking... Accessible... Sessionable... Stellar in all areas but taste... The taste is better than average, but doesn't live up to the other categories which are at an all-star caliber... 1,040 charactersphilbe311, Apr 19, 2009

A: Poured a vibrant golden yellow color with turned cloudy and yellow-orange when the bottle yeast was swirled and added. A nice, white two-finger head of sticky, pillowy foam formed and a left beautiful lace.
S: Smells faintly sweet and citrusy, with hints of lemon peel, coriander, and fruity esters. There's also a mellow, herbal yeasty twang added to the wheat bread smell. Bits of spices make themselves known in the way of clove, white pepper and mint.
T: The taste is spot on German Hefeweizen. A great, smooth semisweet and dry malty mouthful of lightly toasted malts and citrus flavors. A bit of that classic banana, mint and clove flavor make their way through the orange peel and citrus taste. Bitterness is low, yet herbal hops make themselves known. The finish is sweet and dry, with a lingering spicy malt flavor and a wheaty yeast tang.
M: Mouthfeel is smooth, crisp and refreshing. Yeast adds just a hint of chewiness to the body.
D: An all day every day weissbier. This is the benchmark for the style, as far as I'm concerned. Easily sessionable, a must have on a warm day outdoors, and it paired really nicely with my creole shrimp simmer as well.
Weihenstephaner has really caught my attention and is likely my German brewer of choice from now on. Seek this one out, and you will not be disappointed. 1,428 charactersGambrinus1184, Apr 19, 2009

Very refreshing mouthfeel that balances the palate with a slightly hoppy finish. Exceptional drinkability.
Overall, I've also heard a lot about this beer before trying it out. It definitely holds up its reputations as one of the best bavarian hefeweizens out there. 543 characterscpmau11, Apr 18, 2009

Appears a cloudy golden yellow color with over two fingers of fluffy almost pure white head. A nearly perfect pour. Smells and tastes of the usual hefe spicy, peppery yeast, clove and banana, with a touch of citrus (maybe lemon) sourness. A notch above medium in both body and carbonation. Although I prefer a hefe with more of a dominant citrus kick as opposed to the banana, clove, etc., this went down quickly and easily. 462 charactersClockworkOrange, Apr 15, 2009

Pours a cloudy golden harvest amber color with an absolutely HUGE stiff white head that fades slowly, leaving solid patterns of Belgian lacing behind it. The smell is great too. Classic yeasty, banana, clove and pears. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is medium bodied, refreshing and creamy with a bright tangy tingle that finishes pretty dry. Full flavored, the yeasty nature, harvest fruit and spicy tastes prevail and linger gently. At 5.4% ABV, this one is a solid drinker. Wheat-based beers tend to stay with me, otherwise I'd choose to enjoy another. Highly recommended. 586 charactersjjayjaye, Apr 15, 2009

this hazy golden brew looks like the top of a lazy golden wheat field just blowing in the wind, awesome foamy head that climbs out of the glass, decent head retention for a minute with some lacing
smells of citrus and flora, mainly banana, lemon, oranges, then some spices and maybe some cloves, nice yeasty smell that comes along with the style.
explodes on the pallet, lot of banana and spices, lemon and yeast, just an overall great wheat beer
the carbonation may be the one drawback to this beer, it's just a little too much from the get go, but it's not too bad and goes away somewhat with warmth.
i can see myself drinking alot of this on a hot day, or just anytime really, an original and staple in the fridge. 779 characterscarp420, Apr 14, 2009

4.0 A: Hazy golden yellow color. Two fingers of dense head with excellent retention and moderate lacing.
4.5 S: Tons of banana esters and peppery spice. Perhaps there is some clove in there, but I'm not picking much up. Something along the lines of lemon as well.
3.5 T: Really crisp and refreshing, but I find it rather bland. I don't know where everyone is getting bursts of flavor from. The flavors of the nose are back again, but really subdued. This, not a bad brew. 
5.0 M: Insanely smooth. Frothy and something like creamy, though not actually creamy. Simply wonderful feel.
4.5 D: Mouthfeel is awesome, smell is awesome, appearance is good enough. Only thing holding back this brew is the lack of stronger flavors. 755 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 11, 2009

What a great pour, Big soft white head,with a orange cloudy color. Big smells of wheat, bread, orange, and other citrus. The taste is even better. Bready with vanilla, cloves and orange accents. Such a smooth crisp feel in the mouth.

A: Pours a goldenrod color with a thick, rocky, 3 finger head into my pint glass.
S: Tons of wheat (naturally) right up front, but I get some orange, lemon and banana as well. A little bit of the alcohol comes through.
T: At the front, I'm getting a lot of the malty sweetness and a bit of bread flavor. Towards the middle and back, the lemony, citrusy flavors peek through. That's where the alcohol is most noticable.
M: Thick but crisp. Minimal alcohol hang after swallowing. Leaves a pleasant flavor on the tongue.
D: Very refreshing. You feel obligated to have another. The smoothness and crispness lends themselves to the sessionability of this beer.
Go out and get some. Perfect for the spring and summer. 861 charactersInfamous7100, Apr 10, 2009

The dirty (as in dirt, as opposed to not clean) malted wheat and barley comes up first, very powerful grain flavors here. There is a bit of a nutty flavor here as well as some nice fruit.

Smells of some type of fruit, I'm leaning toward a banana. Smells kind of like some tripels I've had. Nice flavor, kind of sweet, the way a hefeweizen should be. Definitely some banana on the tongue, a little grain flavor, very nice almost silky in the way it leaves your mouth. Goes down easy with just enough to keep you wanting to go back for more. Pretty much a picture-perfect German hefe. I couldn't ask for much more when it comes to this style.

Smell is quite phenolic, with a hint of grain. Taste is quite mild, estery, a slight twang from the wheat. Nice sweetness. The yeast flavors aren't as prevalent as in other Hefeweizen beers, though this isnt necessarily a bad thing. Mouthfeel is smooth, very high carbonation that is to style. Drinkability is great, the entire .5 liter bottle goes quickly. A very good beer, I will definately look for this again when in the mood for a German Hefeweizen in the future.

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Poured out of a 16 oz bottle into a Paulaner weizen glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle, but there is a batch code (4398). This beer pours an orangy-gold color that is exceptionally murky once the yeast sediment is added and is crowned by the typical enormous weizen head. The head is a pale white color and has a wonderful mousse-like texture that is supplemented by a torrent of small carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. As the head falls it takes on a rocky appearance, and it eventually fades to a one finger ring that stays atop the beer throughout the drinking experience. A moderate amount of Belgian lace is present on the sides of glass.
Smell: The nose of this beer is exceptionally spicy and has a strong amount of phenol aroma in the form of cloves. There is also a heavy does of banana esters along with a citrusy tartness that smells like lemon zest or bitter orange peel. 
Taste: This beer starts out with a strong banana flavor that would make it perfect for anyone with a pet monkey. This moves to a sharp clove spiciness and big notes of malted barley and wheat along with a bread-like yeast flavor. The beer eventually fades with a bit of a cracker-like malt flavor along with a very light and sweet bubblegum taste that supplements the dry finish. There is no hop flavor to speak of and no real hop bitterness in the finish. This is one excellently balanced, yet flavorful, hefeweizen.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, especially for a hefeweizen, and is one of the biggest bodies in a wheat beer I've had to date. Once the yeast is added to the glass the body seems even bigger, so make sure to swirl around the last few drops in the bottle and add them to the beer. This beer has a creamy sort of mouthfeel thanks to the wheat, and a light finish with heavy carbonation.
Drinkability: I think that hefeweizens are one of the most drinkable styles out there, and Weihenstephaner's Hefeweissbier is no exception. This is an incredibly spicy, fruity, and refreshing beer, and goes wonderfully with warm weather and good friends.
Notes: This is the best hefeweizen that I've had so far. Other breweries' renditions are good, but if you're a wheat beer lover and you haven't treated yourself to Weihenstephaner's version, you owe it to yourself to try this gem from the "oldest brewery in the world". Definitely something I'll be buying again as summer approaches, and a great beer for opening people up to the world of craft beer. 2,491 charactersjohnmichael712, Mar 29, 2009

App: a cloudy pale yellow that reminds me of banana.
Smell: Strong, sweet smell of a fruit salad.
Taste: Starts with the carbonation. Next comes the sweet taste of bananas. Otherwise the taste is light and crisp. As it warms the faint taste of malted wheat creeps through. 
Pleasant mouthfeel without any negative aspects. Very drinkable but one pint is enough.

A--Full two finger head that dissipates fairly quickly, but not fully. Very dark yellow, but when held up to the light it reveals an awesome two-tone color, darker in the middle with lighter yellow running down both sides. Tough to explain, but awesome to look at. Only spotty lacing, though.
S--The usual suspects with a wheat beer, only magnified and much "cleaner."
T--Wow, this is great. I'm picking up A LOT of bubblegum, definitely the dominant flavor. As it gets warmer some fruitiness takes center stage along with yeast and wheat. Tastes like I'm eating from a bowl of mixed fruit while chewing a piece of Bubbalicious. Quite tasty!
M--Pretty much perfect, this just glides down your throat with an ever-so-slight sting from the carbonation
D--Hey, if I can drink an entire wheat beer without complaints, it must be drinkable 946 charactersalcstradamus, Mar 25, 2009

4.61/5  rDev +4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance - Lightly cloudy golden color with a white head.
Smell - A lot of spices are apparent upfront, as well as a couple fruits, pears/apricots as well as some type of citrus.
Taste - The fruits dominate the initial flavors, again with pears and citrus coming through. You get a mild hint of wheat in there, but the spices kick in long after the fruits, and linger nicely on the tongue.
Mouthfeel - Heavy but not oily, with a solid dose of carbonation.
Drinkability - With the spices lingering on the tongue, this one asks you to drink more with every sip. This is quite possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had... and I am not really a fan of the wheat style in general. Fantastically well done, I'm glad I was able to find it here in Denver finally. 766 characterssevopie, Mar 24, 2009

4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a tulip glass.
A: Pours a quite hazy golden-orange hue with a big, white head. Retained and laced marvelously.
S: Very strong nose of wheat, spices, clove, banana, and some yeast. All of these add up to more than the sum of its parts. Very complex and a joy to smell.
T: A big, soft spiciness up front, supported by a supple wheat backing. Then comes the bready yeast, adding its own signature to the mix. I love the blend of all the classic hefeweizen flavors - banana, clove and phenols. This has it all in spades.
M: A pleasant fullness, yet still managing to be lighter in body. It was adequately carbonated and the finish was a little tart and more than a little bit dry.
D: Very quaffable, as each sip leaves you yearning for the next.
This is hands-down one of the most complex hefeweizens (let alone beers in general) on the market today. If for some strange reason you have not already tried this beer, get off your bottom and go getcha' some! Seriously though, this is a quite affordable beer and it has yet to let me down. 1,051 charactersPirateUlf73, Mar 23, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a hefe glass. Appearance is very cloudy light amber with a ridiculous 3-finger frothy head. A 1-finger head remnant stays througout. Minimal lacing. 
The smell is made up of apple, wheat, pears, cloves, and vanilla; very enticing. The taste is somewhat muted, but lemon esters, pears, cloves, vanilla, and some earthiness shine through. The earthy quality reminds me of a saison. Mouthfeel is very carbonated & acidic at first, but quickly becomes smooth & almost thick. 
This is an incredibly drinkable hefeweizen. Braurei Weihenstephan has been around almost 1000 years, so they obviously know what they are doing. 630 characterstheghost3, Mar 23, 2009
3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured an opaque yellow gold into a duvel tulip. Medium amount of head dissipated but left a ring of lace around the edge of the pour. 
Nose is a subtle mix of citrus especially lemons, and maybe a slight hint of bananas. Nothing too overpowering.
Wow, a very impressive hefeweiss! Much fruiter than I would typically expect, even more so than the nose. Strong notes of banana and wheat.
Mouthfeel seems to be on par with the style. Crisp, light, and quite drinkable, although I'm not sure I see myself drinking this all the time. 
Overall a great example of the style - even if you're not traditionally a fan, give this one a try. 635 characterszminor, Mar 22, 2009

S: sharp notes of citrus, mostly lemon and unripe oranges. Some slight metallic tones, but faint. There are also aromas of coriander and maybe a hint of clove. 
T: huge notes of honey and bananas. Some light citrus flavors, light lemon. Mild coriander notes with a huge yeasty flavor. 
M: solid mouthfeel. Very refreshing and slightly creamy. Exceptional carbonation, perhaps perfect. 503 characterspaulthebeerguru, Mar 22, 2009

A-Pours a nice hazy yellow with a monster 3 finger head that ever so slowly fades.
S-Definite yeast comes at you fast. Banana and clove come out very nicely. 
T-A lot like it smells. Nice yeast flavor followed by clove and banana.
M-Refreshing and perfectly crisp. 
D-A great beer that goes down easy and perfect to have over the course of a session.
This is one that I frequently pick up as I am leaving the BevMo beer section. It is priced around $3.00 and is a great choice when you want one of the best beers in its style but don't feel like a hoppy/high abv monster. 678 charactersmjl21, Mar 22, 2009

Pours a cloudy yellow colored body, with a huge foamy white head, creamy and lasting. Has some fruity esters, and some spice like clove. Some heaviness in the aroma. Fruity banana-like taste. Somewhat watery, but definately not weak. 263 charactersjujubeast6000, Mar 21, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Ahhh, takes me back to the days in Schweinfurt. Tall, wonderfully cloudy orange-yellow in color, with a merange-like head.
S - MMM, the wonderful smell of yeast, bread, cloves and banana tones.
T - Slight citrus zest, yeast, kick of spice, banana, wonderful hefeweizen...clearly best in class.
M - Crisp feel smacks on your tongue, but this beer is also thick and viscous in some ways. The spice hits you mid swallow and the zest spikes around the rest of your mouth.
D - Very drinkable hefe. You can't ask for more than this from this style, it goes down so nicely. Prost! 581 charactersroopy40, Mar 20, 2009
4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - poured into pint glass, has a wonderful slightly clouded orange coloring. If poured correctly this beer forms a perfect head with the best retention and lacing in all hefe's ive ever had.
Aroma - beautiful citrus aroma with hints of honey and lemon zest, no hoppiness here though, but for this beer it is perfect.
Taste - full taste of citrus, lemon zest, honey and nutmeg
Feels so beautiful to the palate. This beer excites so many tastes buds my mouth feels almost euphoric. This is by far the best hefe I have ever tasted. Highly recommend this one to any hefe lover you will absolutely be thrilled with just one taste. 638 charactershollis092, Mar 20, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a hazy, cloudy orange in color. Head seemed fuller and more robust than any hefe I have sampled so far. Head has great retention and leaves a tremendous amount of lacing.
S- Smells very yeasty with hints of citrus and banana esters. Minimal hop character if at all. Smells crisp, clean and very Earthly.
T- Crisp light malt flavors back up banana flavors. The lemon comes through slightly near the end of the sip. Light banana flavors stick around and make everything so much better. 
M- A light body and solid carbonation make this very smooth and crisp.
D- Easy and great to drink. This really is one of the easiest-drinking beers maybe ever. A very solid brew. 676 charactersnrbw23, Mar 18, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a hazy golden color with an enormous off-white head. It starts to collapse and leaves a little pillow on top of the beer leaving a nice bit of sticky lacing down the glass. Looks beautiful, with all kinds of bubbles rushing through the glass all throughout. The smell is nice. At first, with the rising CO2, it burn the nose just a bit, but there is a wonderful spiciness like cloves and black pepper, with just a note of banana. There also quite a bready sweetness in the nose underneath the yeast presence. The flavor starts out bready, very bready, with a light, powdery sweetness. There's a sticky, thick presence of sweet wheat, which is nice. It moves to the clove note, the light banana, and finishes with a big peppery, spicy finish. The mouthfeel is very full, chewy from the high amount of wheat and the yeast. The carbonation stings initially and the peppery finish is a bit too strong. The drinkability is great. Really enjoyable and easy to drink. This one is very good, but I'm not sure that it is actually my favorite among the style. Worth seeking out for the Hefe lover, but maybe not the best introduction because its not as clean and easy as some. 1,176 characterstaylorhamrick, Mar 18, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Poured a hazy pale yellow with good off white head, 2-3 fingers.
S - Cloves, slight banana, fresh baked bread.
T - Love the flavor. Little bit of banana, more cloves, wheat bread, and a little yeast. 
M - Almost a medium body, but just a little lighter. Great mouthfeel, good going down.
D - Great session beer. So easy to drink. Love this beer.
Overall - The quintessential German Hefeweizen. Great beer, love to drink this beer, but not my favorite in this style, that goes to Southern Tiers Heavy Weizen, but still a great beer. 540 charactersmaddmatt48, Mar 18, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 500ml bottle
A - Poured a hazy golden colour with a beautiful creamy white 2 finger head. Spot on and very appetising.
S - Clove, banana, light honey even. Quite nice and it makes me want to drink.
T - Great, typical hefeweizen. More banana and hefeweizen spices. Nice flavour coming through from the yeast too. A great beer and spot on what this beer should taste like, just a virtually perfect example.
M - Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Unlike some German weissbiers this one has something to it and it feels like a beer. Very nice.
D - Very drinkable. This is one easy drinking beer, I can see it being perfect on a warm summer's day. Quite sessionable too at just over 5% ABV.
Overall - A great beer. probably the best in its class and a wonderful summer beer (though I like it at other times too). Really, why would you drink a standard macro lager, when Weihenstaphener Hefeweissbier is so perfectly good for the situation. 959 charactersdgilks, Mar 18, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Golden body that shines with a little haziness to show off the yeast. Huge head, always indicative of good things in a hefe. Big bannana and spicy clove in the aroma that follow into the taste. Fruity esters everywhere. Cracker-like malt backbone. Be sure to give it a swirl before pouring the last 1/4 of the bottle. Perfect carbonation and smooth mouthfeel that has a slight chewiness to it in the finish. Great example of a hefe. 432 charactersNCBeernut, Mar 17, 2009

T= Spice and a taste up front then that is washed away with banana and finally finished with clove.
M= light and crisp great for a summer day
D= High. This is the best hefe I've had. Not too much of a fan of the style but I'll be searching this one out to let others try and to sit around and sip on during the summer months. 509 charactersjjanega08, Mar 17, 2009

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Abbreviated review for this one since it was nearly a week ago and enjoyed it out of the bottle (blasphemy!) apres snowboarding in Tahoe 
A: I have no idea what the appearance looked like since it was still in the bottle, but I bet it was a looker.
S: Classic hefe smell easily distinguishable despite not being able to pour this one into a glass. Banana. Clove. Wheaty.
T/M: I see why this rather regular beer is in the top 40. This is the best hefeweizen I've had. Exceptionally well balanced. Clean, crisp and refreshing.
D: The definition of drinkable. Went down especially smooth after a long day in the snow.
I'll be buying more of this the next time I see it for the summer. 686 charactersabfraser, Mar 13, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a soft golden color with an almost white 3/4 inch head that very slowly dissipates to a full lace cover. The carbonation is readily visible.
The smell is quite good and includes notes of banana, yeast, and bread. There is also a sweetness to the smell, which is quite pleasant and goes beyond the banana (perhaps honey/wheat), as well as cloves.
The taste includes the yeasty bread combination. I also note some apple and banana components. I also note cloves which is quite nice. A mild spiciness lingers. 
This is a fairly light bodied beer to me. It is full of flavor and the carbonation highlights it quite nicely. It is crisp on the tongue and leaves a mild residual dryness.
Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer. Something about the taste and the way it lingers, leaves a small amount to be desired for me. 869 charactersSykDoc, Mar 11, 2009

Smell: Malted wheat sweetness, spicy/peppery yeast, banana, lemon and orange citrus, clove
Taste: Wheat, barley, spicy yeast, light lemon pepper, clove
Mouthfeel: not truly crisp, very light. I wish it had a tad bit more body. Very dry and clean
Drinkability: Highly drinkable.

Nice, well balanced smell of wheat, yeast, clove and banana. It's probably the most balance between clove/banana I have ever tasted in a hefe. I was drinking out of a tall hefeweizen glass and it laced the entire length of it. great beer! 320 charactersgameface23, Mar 09, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy whitish-gold color with a thick and frothy head into my pint glass.
Aroma is full mainly of clove with a bit of banana as well in the nose. Clean and where it should be.
Taste is smooth upfront with a nice kick of clove, wheat and banana. Flavors meld together in a way that adds to the tastiness of this beer. 
All three flavors linger on the tongue with the clove and banana leaving just a trace. Goes down smoothly with no problem. 
Easy to drink and much better than some examples I've had. It's what a hefeweizen should be! 547 charactersBrad007, Mar 09, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5We did a blind tasting of hefeweizens by Schneider, Weihenstephaner, Paulaner and Hacker-Pschorr. Weihenstephaner was a clear winner, while the Hacker-Pschorr was the most disappointing of the bunch.
Murky gold body in need of a good polish, with a creamy and abundant white head. Rings of lace are left on the weizen glass as the head descends. A classic, textbook hefe appearance that can't be faulted. Strong banana notes in the aroma, backed up by a healthy dose of wheat, but lacking the complexity of Denison's weisse.
Great flavour, but again a slight step down from the Denison's, which is still the best hefe I've tried. As expected, the banana and grain of the aroma is followed through in bushels. Slight clove taste at the back of the palate, but not as much spice as I was expecting. Very slight citric bitterness. Nice, crisp refreshing mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation. High drinkability for this perfect summer beer.
A top notch hefe, and well-deserving of its reputation as one of the world's best. 1,022 charactersbobsy, Mar 08, 2009

S: Citrus, floral, somewhat grassy, and slight hints at banana.
T: Light with hints of citrus and banana. Ah, Bavarian Wheat!
M: Light, smooth across the tongue, not too carbonated, though somewhat airy.
D: I could drink one after the other. Good "end of the day" porch beer. 396 charactersCJthirty7, Mar 08, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - This one is cloudy (with the addition of the yeast from the bottom) orange with a big ass four finger head that only settles after a solid minute, and even then it only dropped to two fluffy fingers. The head is crisp white, like linen. And a few little chunkies can be seen floatin' around in there.
S - Banana orange juice with an English muffin. This is yeasty, but not over the top, and there are some very focused citrus top notes over gentler sweet banana. Nice.
T - This is everything a hefe should be. The archetype if you will. The citrus is the major player, but other flavors such as banana, yeasty doughnut, and a very gentle hint of clove are found here.
M - Just over the line between light and medium bodied, this is sweetish at first, before building up a gradual citrus tartness. Extremely refreshing and thirst quenching. 
D - This is a perfect warm weather springtime beer. Refeshing, thirst quenching, and easy to down quickly (too quickly). This is the perfect brew for a picnic session. 1,016 characterspmcadamis, Mar 07, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Cloudy pale gold with somewhat active carbonation and swirling clouds of yeast. Rocky white had starts out strong and sticks around for quite a long time. Leaves intermittent patches of lace.
S: Banana-bread is what I almost immediately smelled. After that, cloves, pepper and lemon entered the fray.
T: Definitely what a I thought a benchmark Hefe should taste like. The banana-bread theme continues in the initial sweetness. A sharp clove and pepper bitterness follows. Finishes bready and dry.
M: Medium light body is chewy and bread like. Carbonation level is right where is should be.
D: A very nice beer. I can understand why it rates so highly. A great beer to drink multiples of on a hot day. 707 charactersRayek, Mar 05, 2009

Appearance: Murky orange. clear layers of wheat and yeast. Amazing head..dense, sticky, good retention. Head kind of reminds me of steamed milk foam. 
Smell: Sweet malted wheat, some clove spiciness, hints of lemon
Taste: Crisp wheat, hints of lemon, mild hops (mildly bitter), initially some clove spiciness as carbonation fills your mouth, raw nutty flavors comes through in the end.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied, lots of carbonation, finishes nice and clean.
Drinkability: Give me another one

Poured into a pint tumbler. Almost 2 fingers of extra creamy white head. Plus plus retention. Plus lace. Hazy light amber/yellow in color. Alot of carbonation.
Sweet cloves and light bananas. yeast and phenols are subtle.
If you can get thru the massive creamy head on this one, the taste is sweet bananas and some citrus.
Mouthfeel is light and sparkling. carbonation is only slightly over the top. Finish is clean and mouthwatering.
this beer is one of my favorite "drinkable" beers. i could put these down for hours.
Im so glad this beer is around now, what an excellent brew! 676 charactersimagineiii, Mar 04, 2009
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served in a wide Tucher flute at about 40°F.
Pours a translucent murky light amber with a creamy-looking 1" tall white head that is surprisingly resilient. Any lacing that remains is short-lived. A full return of head is accomplished with gentle agitation.
The nose is yeasty with hints of citrus and banana esters. Minimal hop character. Smells crisp and clean.
This beer is fantastic. While calling Weihenstephaner 'complex' might be a stretch, there is a depth here that I've found lacking in so many other wheat beers. Spices, vanilla, banana and clove esters, the crisp malt backbone of a well-made pils... this beer combines them all into perhaps the most drinkable example of the style I've ever tasted. 
This is a medium-bodied beer with a relatively high amount of carbonation. Alcohol burn is almost nonexistent, and the finish and clean and crisp.
What an awesome beer. Count me as another vote on the 'adding fruit is blasphemous' side. This beer needs nothing. 979 charactersThirdLap, Mar 02, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The anticipation was killing me. Checked my mailbox every day for the last week waiting for notification of Bobsy's trade beers and especially this beer to come in. Will it live up to the hype? 
Certainly has the 'hefe' look down pat. Hazy/cloudy aprocot/orange in color although a bit paler than say HP's . Head seemed fuller and more robust than any hefe I have sampled so far.
Aroma is quite on par. Certainly no over-powering smells of banana or spice although they are present. If anything perhaps a bit more malt is noticeable. The word that comes to my mind immediately is balance.
Which is what immediately comes to mind in the taste. All the classic flavors and experieince are here, just in near perfect balance. The wheat crispness, smooth malt, etc. I noticed a bit more hoppiness, but in, again, a very balanced way. 
If balance is one area this beer scores higher than most then mouthfeel sets it apart. Smooth like velvet from start to finish. Carbonation is bang on. 
I drink Paulaner and Hacker Pshorr by the gallon. Maybe it's a good thing this is hard to come by in my part of the planet. The aforementioned are stellar, but this is the gold standard. Thanks Rob for sending me 3 ;) 1,206 charactersShadman, Mar 02, 2009

Look is a terribly hazed pollen yellow, heavy three finger head, stays all the way to the end. Served in the traditional .5Liter glassware.
Smell is of wet grain, banana, and black pepper. 
Taste is of the banana in the smell, pepper is somewhat subdued, plebty of the wet wheat, with a slight vinegar tasted on the outside of the tongue. 371 characterscurrysage1, Mar 01, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Just had this at a new Italian restaurant in Burbank. Service and food were below par but the beer selection for an Italian joint was top notch.
Only gripe - served in a 16oz water glass, not a proper hefeweiss glass. Also served with a slice of orange which I tossed on the table. 
Good head, fruity bouquet, good mouthfeel. Light-bodied and not over the top clove and/or banana which you get from a lot of hefe's. Nice golden color without looking like a bad urine sample. Started with one, then confirmed satisfaction with another two over dinner.
Oh yeah! 562 characterslynchmob9, Mar 01, 2009

Poured a deep cloudy yellow, with a tall creamy head that dropped down to 1/8' lasting head with some lacing. Man that's a good looking beer. Smell is a hint of citrus, with some banana too. A nice fruity smell. Taste is banana, spices, and some of that citus I smelled earlier. Bready tasting, but pretty clean and easy going down. Not heavy in the least. I'm not a huge hefeweissbier drinker but this is very solid for the style. Recommended. 534 charactersSchlaflyFan, Mar 01, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Purchased at Root Cellar in Cincinnati:
A: Pours a dark yellow to light orange with a snow white, 1/8 inch head. Small, watery, white lacing on the top of the glass on pour. 
S: Heavy fruits and spice on the nose. Bananas, oranges, cloves and lemony tones. This beer smells exactly how it looks. 
M/T: A light and silky smooth body. Fresh citrus taste on the tongue, followed by spice and a very light and clean after taste. This beer immediately reminds me of summer. A very fresh and quenching flavor, without any residue left after swallow.
D: This beer is one of the most drinkable beers I have had. Having limited experience with Hefeweizens, this has opened my eyes to a whole new genre of beer I might enjoy. This beer has low alcohol, strong flavor and very little aftermath. A nice change up from a heavy RIS. Outstanding. 835 charactersDrewOSU, Feb 28, 2009

S--Thick banana esters, almost bready smelling somehow, with an undertone in the nose of lemon zest. Just enough of a citric tang to cut that thick banana along with the butter hints of diacetyl that linger toward the end of the sniff.
T--Banana temporarily disappears up front to blast the clove medicinals. Once that wave passes this sucker reveals a powerful tangy wheat and juicy barley kick in the middle, followed closely by more banana. Finish is mellow, smooth, and surprisingly lasting for the style. Pretty complex for the style, though without much tang on the flavor profile. 
M&D--Mouthfeel's a tad too spritzy for me. I like the champagne feel, but it seeps over into bitingly. Maybe that's me. Anyway, I'd drink a hundred of these in a summer gladly.
Though I liked Ayinger's offering a bit more--for two reasons: I like saisons and it reminded me of one, and it seems more versatile for pairing with food--this may be a consummate summer beer, THE thing to drink in a biergarten! 1,294 charactersTheycallmeTim, Feb 24, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. Hazy golden wheat with a rich, white head and excellent lacing.
Smells of citrus, cloves, banana, spices and honey.
Taste. Citrus, spices, and honey all blended together in a delicious flavor.
Mouthfeel. A pedigree for the style. Medium-bodied, creamy, rich and meaty. Awesome.
A highly drinkable beer. It goes down so smooth. Truly an excellent hefeweizen. 407 charactersastrasday, Feb 24, 2009

Smelled of wheat and spiciness followed strongly by citrus and banana. Mouth is crisp and clean with ample carbonation. Very balanced. Taste of wheat and pepper hit early with mellow sweet banana/lemon bringing up the rear - this beer finishes brilliantly. Definitely an easy drinker. 406 charactersJonMich13, Feb 23, 2009

Pours cloudy light yellow with huge foamy white head. Smell - wheaty, some clove, spices and banana, nothing unusual, just great hefe smell.

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is a beautiful beer when first poured. It pours a golden copper with an orange hint. The head is thick and white with great lacing. I would have given this beer a 5 on appearance except the head deminished rather quickly and maintained at about a quarter inch thereafter.
First smell hinted strongly of wheat with lemon and banana being evenly split in the background. Second and third smells picked up some vanilla and some more banana. The scent of banana tends to intensify even more after first tasting and becomes the dominate trait as you continue to drink. 
Upon tasting, the first thing I noticed was the carbonation. It was followed by the taste of lemon and then grass which I believe is typical for this wheaty of a beer. The wheat quickly turns sweet on the tounge and the banana flavor begins to come through with a lasting sweetness that is very noticeable. The finish remains sweet with a return to some wheat remnants. I enjoyed this beer and find it to be one of the better Heffe styles out there. It was not my favorite but found it very easy to drink and thought it represented itself very well. I will have no problem enjoying the rest of my six pack! 1,178 charactersdannon71, Feb 21, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Nice big foamy whit head that holds for some time, eventually dropping to a rocky cap. The beer is lightly hazed gold color with thin streams of bubbles coming up from the bottom. 
S- Lots of citrus and spice. Oranges come to mind along with lemon peal. Also some light pepperyness and herbal spice. Lots of earthy notes, big yeast presence. Some good sweetness is also present but the nose is really dominated by herbal spice and citrus. 
T- Mild earthy flavors, some herbal spice and wheat flavors. There are some hops in there but not to much to cover up the subtle flavors in this beer. Some sweetness, like white bread and then some citrus in the end. There is a lot going on but I have a little trouble trying to describe every flavor. 
M- Light crisp and refreshing. Good balance and perfect carbonation. What I would expect from a good Hefeweizen.
Overall- This is a great summer beer, that I am very much enjoying in a Minnesota winter. Great subtle complexity and very refreshing. I really enjoy this beer. 1,023 charactersbr3wmeister, Feb 18, 2009

The beer was smooth and light making it very drinkable. 296 charactersaletales, Feb 16, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It has taken me three days to find the review on this beer. Way too many vowels...
With that being said...Had this one on tap at the Brick Store pub in ATL and enjoying another from the bottle as I type. I must say that this is one of may favorite Hefe beers. It truly reminds me of the wheat beers I was drinking of in Europe a few summers ago.
Appearance - Cloudy yellow/orange with a nice continuous flow of bubbles. Forms a nice white head on top that is semi consistent throughout.
Smell - Like Heaven. Very fruity, wheaty and what I think reminds me of banana runts. It makes me want to swim in it.
Taste - Very crisp and refreshing. I would almost prefer this beer over a glass of water after a long workout.
Mouthfeel - Very good. Doesn't overwhelm the mouth but has a very enjoying and slightly bubbly feel.
Drinkability - I don't want to stop. 858 charactersThomajt, Feb 15, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy yellowish orange with a nice head.
Georgous nose, wheaty, lemony a little orange and spice. Very nice.
Taste is more subtle than the smell. You get some of the aforementioned lemon with biscuit and finishes with some spice I am having a hard time placing.
Mouthfeel is light with a nice slug of carbonation which works well in this beer.
This goes down verrry nicely. I could see going through a number of these, especially on a hot day (which unfortunately, it is not).
In short, the best wheat beer I have ever had While I haven't had many of the German Hefes I have had a number of American wheats and they don't come close. 647 charactersroscoehnj, Feb 14, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a bottle at Table and Vine in West Springfield, MA
A- Pours a cloudy darker yellow color with a white head that lasts the entire time.
S- Smells of wheat, orange, banana, and a faint smell of big league chew bubble gum. Excellent smells to this brew.
T- Hits the spot with tastes very similar to the smell: excellent wheat taste followed by bananas, orange and then a slight taste of bubble gum.
M- fizzy, smooth, refreshing
D- This is the best hefeweizen that I have tried thus far. I have a feeling that it is going to be difficult to find one that I'll like any better then this one. I will definitely drink this beer on days when I'm not in the mood for an IPA. 680 charactersKBoudreau66, Feb 13, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512 oz bottle into my Paulaner weizen glass.
A: Murky yellow-gold with dark orange highlights. Dense head pops up to a couple of fingers depth, and then sinks down to a nice cap that lasts to the end. Minimal lacing.
S: Bright banana and spice. Possibly a bit peppery on the nose as well. Inviting.
T/M/D: This is an excellently balanced beer. It hits all around the mouth all at once, and strikes the sweet spot between creaminess and prickly carbonation. Snappy wheat malt, and a subtle lemony/hoppy tang as the beer goes down. Uber-good. 542 charactersk3n, Feb 12, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured a clear, light orange into a hefeweizen glass with two fingers of fluffy white head, which is retained for some time. Smell is light and pleasant--yeast, banana, orange, and coriander. I get all of the above flavors as I sip, along with quite a bit of apple. Finish is lightly dry and spicy with that peppery coriander lingering, and the mouthfeel in general is pleasant and as expected for the style. This might be one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, and I'll be sure to pick up a six pack next time. 519 charactersRiccymon, Feb 12, 2009

M:Perfect level of carbonation, very smooth.

Pours a super hazy and cloudy orangish gold, with a big, frothy white head that sits comfortably high above the rim of the glass. The aroma notes are not very different than Franziskaner, but lack Franz's overbearing cloves. But the cloves are still there, as are bananas, cream of wheat, and lots of yeastiness. Tons of flavors on the palate: flavors of all the aromas tied together in perfect harmony; lightly sweet from start to finish. A hefeweisen masterpiece. 564 charactersdroomyster, Feb 11, 2009

4.14/5  rDev -5.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a weiss glass.
Pours a light honey, tangerine color, with a typical towering weiss head that leaves a moderate web. Cloud is a bit light and I'm thinking the yeast may be light in this bottle.
Aroma is dusty citrus and crystal malt. Sweetness lies in the citrus aromas and clove aromas. Predominately lemon aromas upfront with sweetbread.
Taste is citrus and dusty yeast. Crystal malts meld with weiss yeasts to give a light bubblegum flavor with a citrus punch in the mouth. Hops are there, as light as they are, to give a little character. Flavor is a bit watery, like this one got mixed in a half glass of water.
Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Watery though and thin, little body.
Overall, I'm a little disappointed with this beer after hearing the hype on the forum. There is a lacking in yeast flavors and the banana and band-aids I'm accustomed to. The flavors get better as the beer warms well past cellar temp. To be fair I should mention there was crud on the threads when I de-capped this one. Could be old, but with no labeled date it's hard to tell
I'll have a Paulaner or Tuchers first thanks.
(Update 02/19/2010) This beer is a lot better than the first time I had it, the flavors and aromas are on point, I am revising my review. 1,286 characterswheatyweiss, Feb 08, 2009

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The best way to serve this beer out of the bottle is to pour 3/4 of it into a glass, swirl the remaining contents for about 10 seconds, poor the rest in, and watch the yeasty goodness penetrate the rest of the beer.
A - The pinnacle of the style: yellow/gold color, cloudy with a white two finger head that recedes to a light head that laces the glass as you drink.
S - Classic weizen: banana, clove, bready wheat malt aroma that beckons the first swallow.
T - Every complexity in the smell is rewarded in full on the palette. Banana bread with clove, esters, and yeast.
M - Light to medium. Unfiltered wheat yet surprisingly light for the appearance.
D - In a word: dangerous. This is a great brew anytime but, especially on a hot summer day as a reward to some physically demanding outdoor work!

The scent I most pick up on is the yeast which gives the beer a very bready smell. Nice. Also, there is some clove and banana and some citrus notes as well. 
Interesting as the taste differs from what the smells would indicate. Upfront there is the wheat, grainy flavor, which is followed by some bold citrus flavors before a very crisp, dry finish.
This really is a fantastic beer, one that lives up to its hype. Great smell and flavor, nice carbonation. My one knock is that I would prefer it to be a bit thicker - it is very light. Easy to throw a number of these back. This is one that should be in the fridge at all times. 711 charactersyeastsipper, Jan 31, 2009

Fairly large amount of carbonation, as one might expect. Overall, this is a beautiful and refreshing looking beer. 
The aroma of the yeast is what first gets my attention. This is closely followed by banana and spices. This smell is complex in that it is more subdued than other hefeweizens but I can detect the individual flavors much better. I can also find wheat and some additional citrus nodes in the background. Overall, the aroma is perfect. 
When I finally take a drink, I am blessed with some wonderful wheat flavors up front. This is then followed by citrus flavors of lemon and orange and toasted malt that tastes like freshly baked bread. There is a slight amount of bitterness in the end and it finished relatively dry. Overall, this is an incredible tasting and refreshing beer. 918 charactersCMW, Jan 26, 2009

Foggy yellow color, decent head retention and lacing. Smells awesome! Fills the nose with farm, orange, and a little cherry. Tastes even better... like a really really good Blue Moon: tons of orange, wonderful maltiness. Smooth overall, I could have used a touch more carbonation.
Overall: I don't give many 5's for drinkability. This is a fantastic Hefeweizen, I could drink a gallon of it and not get tired of it. I'd imagine it's an excellent crossover beer as well, so if you have any friends to persuade, look no further. 547 charactersschroederm, Jan 26, 2009

pours orange-yellow with a one finger head. slightly cloudy, not quite unfiltered.
Smell is rich in grassy hops, a light barley nose and a crisp citrus smell. Orange and lemon with some coriander and a slight nose of cloves.
tastes quite thin, very dry and citrusy. Doesn't convey the rich malt and hops that is represented in the smell. Incredibly well balanced but as far as the flavor, it's a lot thinner than the nose. 
mouth is dry, crisp and quite uncarbonated. drinks easy but just not quite up to the big talk that I've heard about this brew. 592 charactersnaterock, Jan 17, 2009

4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5.9 fl oz bottle poured into Weihenstephan weizen glass
A - the bottle pours a slightly hazy orange/gold, with a thick white head that leaves suitable lacing. there is good bubbling from the bottom as well.
S - a very fragrant beer, even when very cold. it is wheaty but at the same time sweet smelling, a sweetness that is akin to oranges, but without any of the bitterness or acidity, so more like juice. there are some malts as well to be notes, but they tie in with the sweetness.
T - the first thing I notice is that there is a great spiciness that hits the top back of the palate as one swallows, amazing! I shall align this taste with cloves, and thank Jason for pinpointing this taste. wheat and a slightly sweet zest are predominant in the finish, after the curtain of carbonation gives way; while the after taste gives way to a slight hint of alcohol and back to the clove essence. there is a slight underlying sweetness from the malts, I suspect, through out the flavour; though subdued in some parts of drinking it is almost always there to some degree.
MF&D - a hightly carbonated brew, this sometimes makes one wait to experience the flavours it has to offer, though not a great detriment to the beer it is something to consider. the consistency is great, and really allows one to freely examine the texture and flavours the beer has to offer. 
I originally had this on tap in huge weizen glasses when I was much younger at a bar in NYC, and remember it being far too sweet for my taste. I can no longer say this and now will foremost recommend this to any of my compatriots in beerdom. 1,604 characterserz316, Jan 15, 2009

Tastes, like the smell, has a slight banana flavor. Nice low carbonation makes a very smooth medium mouthfeel that has a good little chewiness to it. Very easy on the palate and not too sweet makes this a very drinkable beer. Not thin like so many wheats can be, makes it a nice flavor filled brew. 413 charactersbrewintheLou, Jan 11, 2009
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Vigorous pour into a pint glass. Epic half-glass filling white fluffy-as-a-cloud head. Who knows how long this has sat on the shelf at BOTW, as I can't seem to find a date on it. The beer itself is a fairly cloudy pale yellow with a little tinge of caramel brownness. The head reminds me of a very proper rootbeer float "head", nice and fluffy, protecting it's inner goodness. This beer has superb head retention.
The nose is slightly of banana and clove, a nice warm bready scent in the background somewhere. Perhaps a little bubblegum? The notes really come alive as the beer warms (I served a little too cold).
Spicy and well balanced to taste. Only a little real hint of banana in this, cloves and other spices are at the forefront of this one. A little bit of breadiness as well.
The mouthfeel of this is a little on the watery side, like most hefe's I've tried.
The finish is short and refreshing, a nice dry finish that leaves you wanting to search the cellar/fridge for another bottle.
Drinkability on this is excellent. Probably one of the finest hefe's I've ever had, and I'm a fan. 1,097 charactersxenolithic, Jan 11, 2009

Huge head tops off yard glass... looks delicious.
A lot of spicy banana in the nose. Tastes the same. There's some sweetness that makes this a very pleasant drinking experience. No problem downing multiple pours of this.
Hefe's aren't my favorite style... not by a long shot, but this beer is just outstanding. Can't wait for summer! 415 charactersrudylaw, Jan 11, 2009

Pours a hazy golden yellow with a big billowy head that dissipates to a fine line of foam.
Smell is citrusy sweet with hints of pepper spice
Taste is of wheat, banana, clove, and some subtle hoppy spice. Finishes with a nice zest, and it's very crisp and refreshing.
The drinkability is perfect...not a whole lot else to say. It's a beer you can savor all day long. 437 charactersGyle41386, Jan 09, 2009

Smell is herbal and light banana notes. Some spice comes through with light maltyness. Taste is very clean with good round flavor. 
Bubbles are very pleasant and seem just right Really nice finish and very drinkable.

I read a thread on this site that noted the similiarity between this beer and La Fin Du Monde. With my newly gained courage I purchased a pint bottle from World Market today...
Beer poured into tulip glass with nice head, cloudy yellow (typical for this style I believe). I found the taste/mouth feel similiar to La Fin but with a more subtle taste (good thing IMO). SMOOTH... no aftertaste.

Cloudy pale yellow with thick white head. The yeast settled in hard pieces, which leads me to believe it has been sitting like this for quite some time.
Definitely could smell the spicy clove yeast. 
Spicy clove and banana. I hate to be so cliche hefeweizen, but it was true. This beer was a bit to spicy for my taste, but it seems pretty true to form.
Bright, edgy mouthfeel. The carbonation was a bit overbearing.
The edginess of the mouthfeel and spice was the only thing that was difficult for drinkability, but overall, good. 564 charactersmeday, Dec 31, 2008

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5An exceptional hefeweizen. This beer is the gold standard for the style. It is well ahead of the competition in a very competitive German style with many great beers that probably date back for hundreds of years. The beer looks great. It's glowing, dusky, cloudy gold with a fine, soapy, craggy head. Lacing is in abundance. The smell is clean wheat spice, lots of fruity esters and sweet malt. The flavor is like drinking a bit of summer. You can taste the sunshine on the wheat fields when you take a sip of this beer. There's a ton of wheat spice and everything comes through crisply and cleanly but never bitingly. It is refreshing and cooling but also lush and full. The feel is velvety with lots of gentle suds. It is one of the best beers in the world and possibly the best beer in the world that could be considered a session beer, properly. 849 characterspopery, Dec 27, 2008

Appearance Beer is a cloudy light orange while the head off white. Head clings to the glass well. 
Smell Citrus/Lemon smell, sweet malt.
Taste Very mild with hints of citrus and clove coming out. Slight slight biterness. I would say a somewhat sweet fruity taste is a good general description of the taste. A couple of days ago I had the La Fin Du Monde Tripel and I find some similiarties between that beer and this beer. I love both of these beers. 
Mouthful This is a very light beer with miminal carbonation.
Drinkability Very drinkable beer that goes down super easy. 603 charactersmattffrost, Dec 26, 2008

S: a nice yeasty aroma and spiciness full of bananas, lemons, bubblegum, and dry wheat. 
T: The flavor was big and spicy upfront with some citrus, lemons, oranges and a spicy hop tang (Saaz?). Smooth with great spiciness that lingers from start to finish of bananas, cloves and a light citrus hopping. 
M: creamy, with a moderate carbonation and finished dry. 
D: Great drinkability per style, refreshing, and one that's hard to put down inbetween sips. Must try. 535 charactersbeerthulhu, Dec 26, 2008

Smells of sweet wheat, bananas, slight whiff of alcohol. Some raw grain scents as well.
Delicious yeastiness, with sweet grain, a little alcohol warmth, and tart lemon essence. Absolutely fabulous balance, and you know you are drinking beer and not a glass of fruit candy.
Carbonation dances on your tongue and cleans the palate. Finishes on a tart note, and with a bit of an astringent pucker.
Overall, you could knock these back all day long. Should have bought this in the summer. Great stuff. 585 charactersOtherShoe2, Dec 20, 2008

A- wow a huge head after my pour. I have to stop halfway through so it subsides. Beautiful lacing along my pint glass. a very hazy and cloudy wheat yellow color.
S- a very aromatic spicy smell. Smells like spiced apples and malts. There is banana clove spice as well. Quite yeasty as well. very nicely done.

Smell was not surprisingly fruity. Bananas and spice.
Taste reflected the aroma. Banana puree. There was a nice bitter snap up front with a lingering fruity aftertaste.

Smell: Floral bouquet very reminiscent of Westmalle Tripel. Bready yeast, fresh citrus fruit, lemons, fresh-cut grass... a veritable springtime field of flowers.
Taste: Wow, that's fresh. Bread, fruit, flowers... pretty much the smell sums up the taste. Carbonation that tingles the tongue. Slight alcohol finish. 
Overall: This is one excellent Hefeweizen. Being more a fan of Belgian tripels and saisons, this is one German beer that will give the Belgians a run for their money. 595 charactersthekanna, Dec 17, 2008

Pours a cloudy lemon-yellow color with a rocky two-finger head. The head sticks around for a while before settling into a thin pancake of bubbles on top of the beer. Nice lacing down the glass.
Smells of bananas with slight lemon zest. Not a whole lot going on here, but it's done well.
Tastes great. Crisp light malt flavors back up banana flavors. The lemon comes through slightly near the end of the sip. Light banana flavors stick around, goading me into taking another sip.
Mouthfeel is good. A light body and solid carbonation make this very smooth and crisp.
Drinkability is great. This really is one of the easiest-drinking beers I've had, even in the month of December. Put a bunch of this in front of me in summer and it'll be gone even faster.

Now is where the fun begins. Very nice aroma of banana and spices which beckons you to put your lips to the glass.
So, I put my lips to the glass and am rewarded with the pleasing taste of spices (is that cinnamon?) along with some banana. Very nicely balanced, and with no sign of alcohol present.
Mouthfeel on this beer is about as good as it gets. Medium bodied, with an excellent smoothness which is combined with the perfect amount of carbonation. 
This is a very drinkable beer, one which is fairly easy to find, is reasonably priced, tastes great and once you finish one begs you to have another. Hard to beat that combination. 781 charactersJBogan, Dec 09, 2008

A: Classic hefe golden-haziness. Really nice foamy head that sticks around a bit an laces heavily. 
S: Light citrus and a bit of a yeast-heavy musty touch at the end. Very sweet but overall surprisingly muted nose.
T: Great light yeast flavor and a citrus front, but it's all banana towards the end. I've shied away from hefe's lately but this one may just bring me back - nothing bland about it, but very straightforward in a traditional Bavarian brew way.
M: Nice and light, no bitterness or 'deadness,' something I've found with the hefe's I've had lately. A bit of a banana/citrus aftertaste but it's very pleasant.
D: Could definitely have a few of these. Reasonable alcohol content and smooth character makes it a great session beer.
Bottom line - I'm an IPA guy, but this is a fantastic brew. Easily in my top 10. 858 charactersSmixam, Dec 08, 2008

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So this is the kang o' hefes, eh? I can see why. In that case, Paulaner is the queen, because the two brews are remarkably similar.
It starts off in the looks department. Super-hazy copper with a white head that quickly settles into a ring of foam. Lacing is spotty.
Smells of lovely wild Bavarian yeast. The usual tasty aroma of cloves and nanners.
Flavor comes right back into familiar (but great) territory. Spicy, fruity and all that good stuff. So delicious.
Mouthfeel is the one are where I feel this has an advantage over Paulaner. It's just slightly creamier. If it wasn't for that, I probably couldn't tell the two beers apart.
Bow down to the king, bitches. While I can't just grab a sixer of this at work as I can with Paulaner, I fully intend to add this sucker to the rotation. World class weizen, for sure. 825 charactersBigJim5021, Dec 06, 2008

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Please don't drink this beer. I already have a hard time obtaining it in my region.
Appearance - beautiful golden haze in the weizen glass is warming to the eye. The initial head is exceptional as a fluffy, creamy cloud. The carbonation is balanced and the head retention is great as it clings from the top of the glass all the way to the finished bottom. I love the glass as it refreshes the head from mild aggitation with each mouthful.
Smell - sweet banana, clove and bubble gum. Mild yeasty bread-like aroma. 
Taste - similar to the smell with greater detection of mild spices. The specific dominance is the bubble gum banana characteristic which fits the style well. Citrus tones are also noted.
Mouthfeel - medium weight with a dry finish. I'm wondering if the hefe leaves a slightly pasty feeling behind... The texture is thin and smooth with perfect carbonation. 
Drinkability - this beer is definitely a session beer.

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Got this at Bert's Bier Huis in Utrecht
From a bottle into a Weizen glass
APPEARANCE: Deep yellow golden orange with a big fluffy white head. No carbonation evident. A thin film sticks around and lots of lacing lines the glass. 
SMELL: Wheat malt dominates the nose. A good amount of clove and a hint of banana and lemon in the background. The malt is the strongest component, and the rest balance it out quite nicely. 
TASTE: Wheat malt and slightly sweeter than average. Mostly malt qualities with a healthy dose of clove and some banana undertones as well. A slight bit of bread at the end. Definitely enjoyable. 
PALATE: Medium thin body and slightly creamy on the palate. Goes down smooth and finishes slightly sticky. Carbonation is light but very appropriate for the style. No bite and feels right. 
OVERALL: Feels and looks right, and has a nice malty taste profile as well. A very drinkable beer that could be drunk all night. This is actually on tap everywhere in Holland and it often turns into my session beer. I'm glad there's a top notch German weizen readily availible on tap here. 1,102 charactersJeffo, Nov 30, 2008

S- Sweat malted-wheat, some citrus, and only a bit of banana
T- Taste of sweet malted-wheat and some spice. Not a lot of citrus. No banana that I can pick up on. Almost no bitterness from the hops. Very clean finish.
M- Carbonation is good. Leaves almost no coat, and fades out quickly.
D- With the spot-on carbonation and clean finish, as well as slightly milder flavors (for a weissbier), one could definitely drink a few of these.
Overall, this is not my favorite wheat beer. It just doesn't meet the expectation I have for wheat beers in the flavor category. But, it's definitely a good one; worth trying. 679 charactersTommyW, Nov 28, 2008

Retention is amazing as straight lines of orderly bubbles march to the top. When all dies down, some thick lines of vertical lacing are left all the way to the top of the hefe glass. The smell is very complex with bananas, spice, clove and vanilla. Tastes is just as complex as the smell with creamy bananas, vanilla, cloves and apples all mixed in perfectly. Mouth-feel is medium-bodied, and I'm left wondering how this hefe has gone under my radar for so long. Liquid gold. 548 charactersstephens101, Nov 28, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L: Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a tall and thick white colored head that laces the glass very nicely on the way down.
S: Smells of sweet wheat malts, hefty aromas of banana and clove.
T: Tastes very much like the nose - big sweet wheat flavor underneath a nice banana and clove flavor that really completes it.
M: Smooth, a bit heavier than it looks, perfect amount of carbonation, refreshing.
D: Very drinkable beer and it should probably be the gold standard for hefeweizens. 486 characterserosier, Nov 22, 2008

I tried it once and was not impressed (although it was after having a Duvel, so I thought I owed it another chance).
Still, same thing here. Looks good, smells like a pretty standard hefeweizen, good body, but the taste just isn't there. It seems to me to be rather one-dimensional. 340 charactersdarklordlager, Nov 17, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was the perfect beer to quench my thirst. Poured into the appropriate glass at Zeno's...
A: Just as expected...extremely hazy yellow with a nice creamy snowblind white head. Tons of active carbonation, but its hard to see through the haze
S: Very, very light in smell and very fruity. Tons of banana, orange and lemon scents. Yeast scents and some yeast spice (clove, pepper) come through as well.
T: Extremely crisp and clean with fresh light fruits. Tons of banana, orange and lemon that really blend well with the spice of the yeast. The yeast spice is not overpowering, but it has a nice pepper aspect that goes well with the rest of the beer.
Overall, an incredible hefeweizen...rivals East End Monkeyboy as the best in my opinion. 745 characterstreyrab, Nov 16, 2008

This easy drinking beer has a great banana, clove, and malt taste. Wow, what a great feeling going down. Really like it. Nice lacing here on my glass also. Great sessionability. One of the best things about this beer is that it's available all across the fruited plain.... it's even here in Alabama. 389 charactersBeerMark, Nov 15, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on a weizen glass from a 16.9 oz brown bottle.
Appearance: Cloudy, orange honey-colored with a rich, creamy head that settled to a consistent ring.
Smell: Exquisite bouquet ranging from banana to a slight clove. Very rich, floral aroma with a touch of spiciness.
Taste: Such a perfect balance between the ingredients. No bitterness whatsoever. The banana aftertaste is quite fantastic.
Mouthfeel: So light and thin on the palate, this beer goes down ever so smoothly.
Drinkability: This beer is so easy to drink. Hands down the best hefeweizen I've ever had. I was just missing the weisswurst to accompany it. 621 charactersreezun, Nov 15, 2008
4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Cloudy and golden. Pours with a creamy white large head. The head is reminiscent of a bed pillow. It just invites you to dive in. No sediment on the initial pour, but its a pretty large bottle so there might still be some in there.
Smell: Bannana, yeast, and some excellent spices. Not too overpowering. A great supplement to the taste.
Taste: This is what a hefe should taste like! Delicious banana, citrus, yeast, cloves, and a slight hint of citrus. I love how the taste lingers in your mouth and invites you to drink more.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, Perfect carbonation and finishes super dry. Awesome.
Drinkability: The taste, mouthfeel and complementary smell really make this probably the best hefe I have had to date. I can't wait until next summer when I can enjoy this on a regular basis. 811 characterslynx1245, Nov 08, 2008

Appearance: Huge heaad with great retention. Head is like a cotton ball just floating on top of the brew. The body has a golden color with some honey accents.
Smell: Nice peppery citrus nose - big draw of banana
Taste: Taste is quite light, with some banana - and a spicey, metally finish.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied - leaves almost no aftertaste. Creamy.
Drinkability: Very light and refreshing. I was hoping for just a bit more flavor - but otherwise, a delicious brew. 518 charactersbigkahunas4, Nov 06, 2008

Pored into a weiss glass this beer is cloudy lemon gold with an immense cloud of off white foam. Patches of fluffy lace ring the glass.
The scent is so strong I notice it from a foot away. Lemons, wheat, yeast, fresh dough, coriander, pepper.
Taste is sweet with lemons, green banana, softly sour yeast and wheat, fresh doughy bread. The sour lemon finish tickles the sides of the tongue a minute or two after the sip. Really a vivid sucking on a lemon sensation; nice! Mildly spicy with coriander, clove and black and white pepper. There's also a very soft nutty flavor buried in there.
Mouth is creamy but a tiny bit thinner than I would prefer.
Drinkability is excellent. The beer disappeared rapidly and left me wishing I had another bottle of it.
This is certainly one of the best hefeweizens I've had and I can only dream about how fantastic it must be when fresh off the tap in Germany. 969 characterssethmeister, Nov 04, 2008
4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Lynx1245
Appearance: Pouring viciously results in huge, pillowy white head. Liquid is banana-colored and quite cloudy, with no apparent sediment. Light lacing and medium retention.
Smell: Banana, sour yeast, clove, spice, and some tangerine. Maybe some citrus as well.
Taste: Mirrors the smell, yet not as pungent. Aftertaste is exceptional - loads of banana.
Mouthfeel: Very creamy with medium-light body and lower carbonation.
Drinkability: Could drink this all day. Flavor is a little underdone, which makes it that much easier to drink. 559 charactersThreeWiseMen, Oct 19, 2008

Smells of typical hefeweizen with cloves and slight citrus and banana. Tastes of cloves and fruit with a nice creamy head. Slight hops at the end that pairs nicely with the sweet fruityness.
Mouthfeel is a very nice balance of carbonation and rich body.
Overall drink abilty is above average compared to other similar hefe weizens. Not to heavy, not too over spiced , soft on the palette but with good balance of flavors 609 charactersangelmonster, Oct 18, 2008

The appearance, by the way, of this beer is very nice, with deep yellow color and white creamy foam. 
Taste: really smooth, rich taste - bananas, wheat, pear, cream, apricot, some spices. 
This is the best weissbier Ive tried. Excellent. 408 characterssimonjohansson, Oct 17, 2008

S: Sweet wheat malts, a spicy nature reminiscent of pepper, yeast, and lemon peel. Maybe a little clove as well. 
T: Full-bodied malted wheat and barley, earthy, citric yeast notes are prevalent. A definite clove flavor hits the tongue with a bit of crispness. Hops provide just a little twang of bitterness. The finish offers a bit of peppery spice and some nuttiness. Some faint banana flavor is also present near the finish. 
M: Slightly crisp, medium to full body with very creamy carbonation from very small bubbles. Finishes very clean and on the dry side. 
D: Wow, this is really a great beer. The appearance is stunning and the flavor is complex and very expertly balanced. It's not too robust to drink several of, but it's a rewarding beer. 907 charactersClydesdale, Oct 15, 2008

4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into a Weihenstephaner Weiss glass, produced a proper two fingers worth of white head that lasts. The body of this wonderful brew was a hazy and golden orange in color
The aromas of bananas, wheat and spices filled my head. The nose on this is exactly what I expect in a Hefe. The banana smell wasn't overpowering as in some others 
The flavors mimic the nose, but it is very refreshing in the way it plays in your mouth. Good carbonation and light as well, great flavors this is a world class Hefe. This starts of sweet and fruity and had a light dry finish.
Highly drinkable, it would be my go to session brew if it weren't so expensive. 657 charactersjoepais, Oct 12, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a medium foamy head on a cloudy body, which went from light yellow at the bottom to near orange at the head line. Smells of good "wheatiness', with a touch of sweetness, citrus, clove, and a little banana. Taste was right along with aroma, with the banana coming through a bit stronger. Very smooth, easy to drink. A very, very good hefe, one of the best, but, for me, a notch below New Glarus' Dancing Man Wheat. 420 charactersibashmuck, Oct 08, 2008

Smell: Bananas and cloves - yet I get a touch of grapefruit and citus.
Taste: Wheaty with bananas and cloves.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, light, with a slight bit of bite from the bubbles.

Light colour with big head this is a most graceful Hefe with all the banana and cloves in a seamless blend. Not my favourite Hefe as I prefer big bold flavours but the quality is unmistakable. Very refined and hopefully available in BC soon . 328 characterscanucklehead, Oct 03, 2008
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours cloudy, hazy cider yellow-orange into a weizen glass with a voluptuous, off-white, puffy 2 to 3 finger head which clings in splotches to the inside of the glass. Aroma is very nice with lots of citrus, spice, orange, apple, and yeast. Mouthfeel is smooth, slick, and medium-bodied with just enough carbonation to even it out. Taste is very complex; banana, spices, and coriander up front with a yeasty, spicy, banana bready middle and a deliciously smooth, tart finish. The more it warms the more the spices and fruit taste comes to the fore. Overall this is a great beer and the best I've had in the style. ABV and great taste make this brew highly drinkable. 666 charactersljbrisson, Sep 26, 2008
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Have had this beer many times, both in bottle and on tap. Had on draft at Max's the other day, the prototypical German hefe.
The beer pours a hazy gold color with impressive head retention and lacing. The nose is hefeweizen perfection, consisting of bubble bum, banana, clove and even nutmeg. The aroma on this beer defines what a hefe should smell like. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, but the beer finishes completely dry. It starts off with a bit of spicey sweetness, but on the finish the beer is dry and wheaty. The beer is pretty full bodied for a wheat beer, but otherwise I would describe the mouthfeel as medium bodied. Drinkability is very good, though the amount of spice would keep me from drinking more then one or two of these at a sitting. 
I still prefer the schneider-weisse when it comes to wheat beers, but this is undeniably outstanding. An absolute classic. 894 charactersJohn_M, Sep 25, 2008

Cantaloupe and lemon on the nose with something beachy in the background. The yeast is apparent.

A--Hella thick, white frothy head reigns supreme over cloudy honey color ale reminiscent almost of apricot juice. Nice lacing sip after sip.
S--Banana and clove. Traditional but beautiful. Mild phenols and cinnamon. Rather spicy and sweet.
T--Prominent clove followed by sweet malty hints. Just a kiss of bitter hop at finish to balance. Grassiness, bubblegum, mild phenols pop up in between. Tasty.
M--Typical quality witbier. Medium-bodied. Creamy and nice.
D--My bottle went too fast. Sad it's gone. I think you could easily enjoy several of these easily and will few ill effects. I'll be testing that theory soon! 674 characterslarsee01, Sep 23, 2008

A: Pours an amazingly cloudy beautiful golden color with a 1-2 finger head that dissipates in about five minutes.
S: Holy effin wow. First, you get slammed in the face with maybe the best yeasty wheat smell I have ever experienced. Then, you get to really analyze what's going on in there. There's definitely some citrus, cloves, and some fruit, maybe bananas.
T: The taste is a tangy wheaty taste, complete with bubblegum and full-on banana, which give way to an aftertaste of cloves that intensifies as it lingers in your mouth.
M: this is awesome. Perfectly bodied and well carbonated, this is pretty much right what it needs to be. 
This lives up to its reputation as one of the best in the world. 876 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Sep 20, 2008

Cloudy pale yellow-orange color with a thick cap of peaks-and-valleys head resting atop it.
Smells of yeast and barley and grapefruit citrus. Smells like a piece of heaven was used during the fermentation process.
Honest to God, I never thought I'd have a wheat beer that could compare with Paulaner; and this really blows it away. Wow. Sooo good. The yeast gives it a bananna/citrus taste that is just perfect.
Well balanced brew, carbonation is present but not dominant; pleasant aftertaste.
Now I see what everyone has been talking about. Holy shit. 695 charactersdonteatpoop, Sep 17, 2008

My taste tester didn't let me down. A nice spicy aroma of corriander, clove, and some juniper. 
Flavor has a bit of chalky and powerdery yeast up front, but its oh so smooth and a really nice spicy treat. Some light banana flavors in the middle to finish. 
Mouthfeel is full and almost chewy. Good malt body with wheat an dyeast holding strong. A supurb hefe in every resepect. This would only hurt to have a lemon put into it. 586 charactersSurlyDuff, Sep 17, 2008

Aroma: Bananas and cloves, with yeast. 
Taste: Cloves and banana as well..mostly fruity. Overall pretty good in this department. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is higher, so it ends up being pretty crisp...goes down well too. Pretty refreshing, which is what many hefeweizens shoot for. 
Drinkability: Succeeds in this too...the crispness and light fruit flavors result in a pretty drinkable beer. A great example of the hefeweizen style, and an amazing beer in general. 580 characterskshankar, Sep 16, 2008

A: Cloudy! Hazy-golden, the head went away after the pour. With each sip, it left a great lacing on the glass.
S: Smells like bannanas, cloves and a little yeasty. I noticed that there were hints of fruit. 
T: Fruity, bannanas, and heavy on the clove-like flavor. Grainy but but not overpowering on any flavor, really a great taste. No heavy after-taste.
M: Carbonation is heavy, very refreshing, especially in the festival atmosphere. Dry finish.
D: VERY drinkable, like I said I enjoyed this at an Oktoberfest and had 3 and still came in second in a shooting competition! If you like the Hefe, try this brew!

Perfect orange gold hefe color. Huge frothy head atop a steady flow of replenishing bubbles. Very inviting.
Straight clove smell. Can't sniff past it to anything else.
Taste of cloves. Maybe some light fruit. I can't get the banana flavor I was expecting. Heavy, heavy clove flavor.
Medium creamy body.
I'm a little underwhelmed with this beer. It's definitely good but I wouldn't call it the best hefe I've ever had. The cloves are too prominent.

4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale, cloudy straw-color with a dense, four-finger head. The smell is faint but nice: spice and fruit and some funk. The taste is bigger than you'd expect, with the requisite banana notes but also with some nice hop spice and a pleasantly bitter finish. It's just shy of too viscous, but the ample carbonation makes it fill up the mouth deliciously. Easy to drink a few, rich but quenching. A fantastic beer. 416 charactersgory4d, Sep 09, 2008

Bananas. Lots of bananas in this smell along with a bready yeasty note. Pretty much like banana bread.
As expected, Taste is heavy on the banana also with a little bit of a citrus note and a slight wheat twang. A bready yeast flavor rounds out the beer. Creamy, well carbonated, feels great in the mouth.
Pretty drinkable beer; strong on the banana, but still impressive. 502 charactersHojaminbag, Sep 08, 2008
4.17/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - A cloudy golden color. Acceptable head with moderate lacing. This beer also contains high amounts of carbonation.
S - Two words - Banana bread. Additional citrus notes linger. It truly it a powerful smelling brew as opposed to the other competing Hefeweizens.
T - A strong wheaty/bready/grainy taste with a definite banana infusion. Extremely crisp, and very refreshing. Cloves are very apparent though somewhat overshadowed by the banana.
M - Crisp and dry. High carbonation adds a fair amount of bite (enough to keep it interesting.)
D - Good drinkability. Weihenstephaner is a delicious beer and one of my favorite wheat beers. If you like wheat beers you cannot go wrong with this one, but if you are just starting out with them you might find this one a little overwhelming.
In retrospect, if you like wheat beers this one might end up being at the top of your list. Its a shame that in my area I have a rather hard time finding it, but that doesn't keep me from searching store shelves in hopes of finding it again and again. 1,040 charactersSimplySinister, Sep 03, 2008
4.9/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance- A hazy orange-gold brew with a big, triumphant white head that recedes at a gingerly pace. Such a beautiful head and color as well as nice lacing that crawls down the glass as I drink it gives me everything I'm looking for in a beers appearance. 
Smell- Sweet, sweet, sweet banana and clove. Also joining the party is a bit of mild citrus, maybe lemon, and wheat earthiness. I have had this brew a few times, but just now noticed that the way the sweetness and clove pair up smells very much like sweet pumpkin pie. This fucker gets the mouth watering and ready for action.
Taste- Much like the smell: banana, clove, sweet wheat and citrus that is more orange in the taste than it was in the smell. Maybe a bit of tart apple in there, as well. There's a decent amount of pepper and alcohol heat through the finish that I love. It has to have that spice to balance out that awesome sweetness. Quite a bit like its winter brother, Vitus.
MF- Crisp, snappy carbonation with a silky smooth underbelly that is SLIGHTLY watery. That is the only thing I can find wrong with this beer, and it's barely noticeable. Otherwise, the feel is exactly what you want out of a hefe. 
Drinkability- Out of this world good. One of those haunting beers that has you craving it anytime the temperature is above 70. Hell, I crave it when it's cold and rainy. It's just that good.
*Note-This review goes out to one of my family pets, Toivo. It became clear while in the middle of taking notes for this beer that he'll need to be put down. Cheers to the fat French Bichon with the Finnish name. 1,587 charactersReino, Sep 03, 2008

Nose was pale wheat, corriander, clove and lemon zest. Taste followed nose; very muted and subdued. Mouthfeel was light in body and lively in effervescence with a clean citrus flavor lingering at the aftertaste. Incredibly easy-drinking brew and quite refreshing after a day on the beach. Unfortunately, I don't think the pint glass it was served in did it full justice. 485 charactersJwale73, Aug 29, 2008

4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a glowing peach color haze, a light hue for a Hefeweizen. Sediment swirls in the middle, but there isnt much of it. The massive ivory head lasts forever and leaves an intricate lacework on the glass. The aroma is full of fruit, like a banana and orange smoothie almost. Doughy pale malts and tangy wheat is also redolent in the nose. The taste is pretty much perfect for the style. Fruity yeast esters explode out of the gates with banana, citrus, bubblegum and cloves all vividly represented. Fresh wheat malt and cookie barley malt makes a perfect balance to the dense yeast flavors. Hops are modest, some sea air noble hop aroma and a mild bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is light and incredibly smooth. Carbonation bubbles are silk like consistency.
This is a fantastic wheat beer. Full of flavor and perfect for summers. You must try this beer, even if you arent a wheat beer fan. 900 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Aug 25, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: lovely golden color with a touch of orange. Super excited about this beer and the presentation does not disappoint. Head formed nicely...and loads of it at first only to slowly dissipated.
Smell: caramel malts, wheat, lemon/fruity sweetness. Great stuff!
Taste: dry earthy flavor with a bite of lemon to it. Malt sweetness and a somewhat grainy characteristic that leads one to a dry yeast/bread flavor. Halfway thru the glass I found a slight tart finish on the tongue that kept me coming back for more. This is one of the better beers I have had in a while. Forgot to mention a slight trace of spice (almost pepper-like) bite. Sure has a lot going on!
Mouthfeel: carbonation is spot on and fits the beer well. Just great! Drinkability is also excellent. Nice, nice stuff! Make sure to get this one! 815 charactersMagpie14, Aug 25, 2008

After having this beer multiple times I have to change my overall score, which was originally 4.7. I do think it is an excellent beer but I'll have to drop it down. The mouthfeel now seems a little weak, a little undercarbonated to other hefeweizens I've had lately, and the flavor gets bored to me because no one aspect really stands out tremendously. It's still a really good beer though.
___
7038 stamped on the back of the bottle
A- would be a 5 if it had better head retention. The head builds up very nicely, as large as you want it, but it doesn't stick as long as it should.
S- The smell is big on wheat, but nothing huge in any one direction as far as yeast by-products go. Clove is pretty tame but there. Banana I can't really find in the aroma. It's a pretty sweet smell. I would personally like more banana, but it's good anyway.
T- Again, the great thing is the wheat is front and center, yet it's not unbalanced in the clove or banana direction. Wheat dominates and is very tasty. Maybe it's the bubblegum like flavor that combines with the wheat to give it the sweetness.
M- This is where it beats every other Hefe I've had by a mile. There plenty of carbonation but it isn't disgustingly prickly like so many other overcarbonated hefe's.
D- I think the previous sentences explain this one.

4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A 500 ml bottle into my Sisson's weiss glass. A beautiful golden orange liquid clouded with yeast. A massive head rises up to three fingers and sits gently, receding to a bubbly blanket after a while. Active carbonation streams up and keeps it so while streaks of lacing decorate my glass.
Smell is fragrant and luxurious. Lemon and clove, bananas and yeast esters. Sweet wheat malt and apples. A touch of bubblegum and light fruits.
Taste is as good as it gets. Big lemon and wheat malt upfront. Banana and clove follows. Light grapeyness and spicy peppery notes. A dry clean finish the is gently hopped and barely bitter. A trace of alcohol. Light toast on the tongue remains. 
Mouthfeel is perfectly summery light and bubbly. Not quite creamy but very smooth on the mouth as you just want more and more. 
More and more is the way I would describe the drinkability. The abv is low enough to have quite a few and the experience will make a bad day good, a good day great! 976 charactersscootny, Aug 21, 2008

Nice aroma - more on the yeasty side than the banana side. The taste follow suit. A bit light, more focus on the yeast and wheat, less on the banana and clove. Some light spiciness associated with the yeast. Overall, slightly on the light side - or have my tastebuds been fried by too many weizenbocks? 417 characterssstackho, Aug 18, 2008

T - Nice fruity notes throughout, along with a nice malty backing. Simple and extremely delicious.

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer is always good
Appearance: Opaque, golden straw color. A beautiful fluffy invincible head. 
Aroma: Very heavy of overripe bananas, almost candy like. The overall smell was of baked banana bread with a healthy dosing of nutmeg and clove. No real perceivable hop aroma, perhaps slightly floral. Buttery yeasty notes as well
Taste: Absent of bananas but full of wheat and more of a melon flavor and some slight clove-like spice. Absolutely wonderful.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation really fills your mouth and the bubbles seemed particularly fine (perhaps due to it being on-tap) and pricked the tongue. Each sip went down real smooth and was incredibly refreshing
Drinkability: I could drink this beer any time of the year and day. This is definitely a perfect summer beer and is fabulous with pizza 808 characterssimplexiton, Aug 15, 2008
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From notes 8-10-08
Eye: Cloudy yellow in appearance, was going to use "cloudy wheat" but I think given that this is a wheat beer the word painting done by "cloudy wheat" would be obscure or redundant. Head formation is wonderful, but retention is another matter, starts out nice, but quickly fades to an average head. After that retention of the creamy looking head is good, but with a wheat, I think it needs to be much larger. Lacing looks to be poor. 
Nose: Bread, strong yeast aromas, banana, slight clove in there as well. Not much more, wouldn't expect much more either. This is classic, was able to actually smell all that without really looking for it (had to go to the kitchen and smell some ground cloves first, then look for it, but once I knew what to look for, the cloves were apparent). 
Tongue: Huge wheat flavor, nice yeast esters/phenols come though just as well in the mouth as they do in the nose. Nice, simple, classic. Hops are pretty much absent in terms of flavor...ehh maybe some slight spice.... 
Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Smooth and creamy on the palate. Much fuller than I expected for a wheat beer, still not full bodied though, but full for a wheat. Carbonation is lower, and does not seem forced as with some beers....one can just tell that it has been forced. This is much more natural feeling. This is a staple example of the style in my opinion. One that I'll much likely be picking up again and again. Nothing that wows, but just a general good example of the style. 1,506 charactersbecktone, Aug 14, 2008

Taste is uber banana with plenty of clove and fantastic wheat flavor. A great texture here. mouthfeel is just about right. Drinkability is certainly top notch.

4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy pale straw with a perfect, rich head. Tiny bubbles throughout kept coming up the entire time I drank this, and it left very fine lacing along the sides of the glass. Really attractive beer.
Smell is banana, with an unusually strong vanilla presence. Very 'fresh' and inviting.
Taste is amazing, with yeasty vanilla, banana, and canteloupe taking turns stepping forward, then melding together for a lasting finish. Every flavor is strong enough to be noticeable, but nothing overpowers.
Effervescent carbonation makes this just prickly enough to balance the creaminess in the taste, and makes this go down very easily.
The gold standard for Hefe's, as far as I'm concerned, from a brewery that deserves every bit of praise it gets. 749 charactersmgp80, Aug 10, 2008

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into a pint glass.
Pours a bright, slightly hazy yellow with a big puffy white head that lingers throughout the session leaving bits of lacing. There is also a constant stream of bubbles coming to the top. Smell is wonderful with cloves, banana and sweet wheat. Hint of citrus in the nose as well, mainly lemons. Taste is absolutely perfect for a hefe with an initial citrus burst followed by a massive sweet wheat taste full of bananas and spices. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and unbelievably creamy for a hefe with tons of carbonation. The drinkability couldn't be higher on this and it is the definitive example of a hefeweizen as far as I'm concerned. There is no better summer beer on earth. 710 charactersgford217, Aug 07, 2008

I have tried many of this style but the aroma really wowed me. I was expecting the depth of character in the smell but it really was terrific. You get a caramelized banana smell from the yeast with some spiciness.
The taste was fabulous. It was well flavored with the bananas coming through to slither on the tongue. You get the malted barley and wheat as the backbone with the follow up of the yeast. It is semi chewy and leaves a happy coating on the mouth. Overall this is probably the gold standard for Hefeweizen. 711 characterscswhitehorse, Aug 05, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a .5L bottle into my .5L Weihenstephaner weizen glass. In case you're new to the style, you should know that it is CRITICAL that hefeweizen be served quite cold and in an appropriate glass, for a number of reasons.
Appearance: This beer pours from a brown bottle with an elegant-looking label, which touts Weihenstephaner as the "oldest brewery in the world." Once it's in the glass, a good weizen pour reveals a hazy, golden liquid with a frothy, meringue-like head. A little beer was left in the bottle for "swishing" in order to unleash that delicious, yeasty sediment into the glass (in my opinion, this is essential with traditional hefeweizens). 
Smell: A fantastic bouquet of starchy, mildly citric goodness, with a hint of spice (cloves?). There's a mild banana-like element here, too. The prevailing scent, though, is a uniquely yeasty breadiness.
Taste: Follows the nose. Cold, refreshing bread in a bottle, with a hint of very mild citrus and a very light spice/clove note at the end. Hops are not evident. This is true to the style, and for my taste in hefeweizens, that's a good thing. Regarding the style -- Weihenstephaner practically INVENTED this style of beer, so it stands to reason that they would brew a great one.
Mouthfeel: Crisp, ample carbonation and a low ABV combine with the starchy yeast to produce a cooling, refreshing swallow. This is a beer that you could GULP down if thirsty without being overwhelmed. I don't recommend that, though. This is a beer to be savored.
Drinkability: Again, the low ABV, cold serving temperature, and refreshing flavor profile yield a fantastically drinkable beer. There's a reason this beer is consistently viewed as among the most sessionable beers on the planet. On a hot summer day, there's not much out there that could be more refreshing. Of course, if you're me, you'll drink it year-round, because it is your favorite beer of all time. 1,922 charactersUGADawgGuy, Aug 04, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5The first time I tried Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier I was in New York city at a german beer garden and it was recommended by the german expat there. I later had it on tap at Rolf's on 3rd Avenue.
I was very fortunate to get a chance to try this beer at the proper temperature, in the brewery glass, and with a professional's pour (that swirl to extract the yeast at the bottom is something I would not have known without being told).
This beer pours a light cloudy pale with a large, frothy head that is captured superbly in the Weihenstephaner bulbed glass. 
The smell is of fresh corriander, fennel, apricot, and orange peel.
I did regret that the bar tender/owner tried to place a lemon slice in my beer. Trendy I doubt they did that a thousand years ago when that brewery was first created!
I have continued to enjoy this beer for the past 7 years and will continue; particularly when the temperature escalates. Enjoy! 928 charactersPerzentRizen, Aug 04, 2008

Tastes of phenolic flavors of banana and cloves right along the lines of this style. More cloves than any other flavor...maybe even bubble gum? A bit bitter but not over the top.
Great blend of a mouthfeel. Smooth, a bit wet, and lots of carbonation. A hop bite lingers. 
GReat beer. Would like to session this some time.

Presents even more upon tasting, with apricot and banana esters coming into the picture. Without a doubt the most complex, best tasting hefeweizen I've had.

A: The beer poured an excellent hazy yellow-orange with a very nice light but big white head. The apperance alone made the beer appealing. It appears to have a lot of carbonations.
S: The aroma is top notch, one of the best from a Hefe that I have tried so far. Very complex with hints of wheat/yeast, fruit, spices and maybe some floral notes as well.
T: What can you say about the taste, but exceptional. It follows the nose to a T with the wheat/yeast and banana/fruit really coming through.
M/D: I could have drank this beer all night if I had more bottles of it. The carbonation was right for the style, it was smooth with a medium body. Great summer beer and really it would be good at any other time of the year as well. Has to be one of my all time favorites, especially since it is my favorite style. 934 charactersPhillyStyle, Aug 02, 2008

For my money up there with the best hefeweizens I've had. Banana, clove, and other spices blossom on the tongue without a hint of bitterness or uneasiness. It's sweet malt wheat is balanced by a light citrus bitterness, but the finish is of the spices. This is one full-bodied beer, too. Excellent brew, highly recommended. 479 charactersBBM, Aug 01, 2008

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 16.9 oz. bottle, rolled to rouse the yeast, into a weizen glass.
Appears a cloudy golden orange-yellow with a white two finger tall head. Carbonation bubbles swirling up throughout the glass. Nice sheets of lacing down the side of the glass. 
Aroma of bananas and spicy cloves. A bit of a sweet, mellow orange as well. Tangy/bready wheat malt underneath it all. 
Flavors are mostly identical to the aroma. However, the banana is not really present as much. Instead the cloves take over and the bready flavor of the wheat malt does the singing. Finishes with a touch of noble hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Just as it should be for the style.
This is probably my favorite Hefeweizen I've tried so far. Perfect mingling of the banana and clove flavors. Make sure to roll the bottle first to rouse the yeast. I believe it really lets a lot more of the flavors out. 894 charactersroadhouse, Jul 29, 2008

Tastes spicy zing with clove flavor, undertones of malt sweet, and minimal esters. Not a biting clove sting, which was a surprise to get that strong of a clove flavor without the tongue-piercing phenols. Yeast and wheat are heavy with earthiness in the mouth. Oranges and banana fight to appear, but are driven away by a sting from the strong carbonation. Aftertaste dominated by apricot esters and acrid from the carbonation. Wet can't quite win through the yeast-made zing, yt the finish isn't quite drying. Near balance to the conflict with zing winning out, but not soundly. Mouthfeel is md-light with some dextrinous character. Strong carbonation that melds with the yeasty spiciness. A decent beer, but not one I need to repeat. Wearing by the end of the bottle. 964 charactersmentor, Jul 23, 2008

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A highly touted Hefeweizen but my first time for drinking this beer. Pours a cloudy golden with a large white head that had excellant retention. Large amounts of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is filled with cloves and banana esters. The flavor is heavy with clove spiciness. A little too one dimensional to rate a higher taste rating. But this beer has a perfect mouthfeel. Creamy or a velvety texture with just enough carbonation to make the flavors pop. A great beer indeed. I would highly recommend this beer. 521 charactersmorimech, Jul 13, 2008

Leaves a nice milky lacing. golden orange in color with a hazy clarity and significant amount of bubbles.
S: intense banana esters followed by the expected aroma of clove spicing. What I'd expect from a German Hefe.
T&M: light body, very crisp. perfect level of carbonation. lots of lovely spicing, mostly clove dominant. strong fruity flavors mostly banana with a slight dryness to it, followed by some citrus tones, and a lemony aftertaste. Excellent summer hefe!
D: Excellent beer, probably one of the top in it's style (as most would agree). I think the only thing preventing this from a full on 5 is the spicing. It could be balanced a bit better with the fruit flavoring, other than that, excellent beer! 832 charactersjulian, Jul 13, 2008

A: Beautiful murky golden hue, huge pillowy head that dissipates very slowly and leaves nice lacing. Awesome looking beer.
S: Smells wonderful with hints of spiciness. The wheat is definitely on the nose as well. Superb smelling beer that really whets the appetite for what is to come.
T & M: This beer tastes like a weissbier should. Pleasant spices but not overwhelming. Incredibly refreshing mouthfeel, this is a beer that stays on the palate. Superlative taste.
D: I can definitely attest that this beer is highly drinkable and sessionable. I cannot recommend this beer any more highly. 619 characterselniko, Jul 12, 2008

This beer pours a cloudy golden orange with a massive white head that holds a nice film and laces well. The smell is bubble gum and banana. The flavor is more clove like than the smell, but the banana and bubble gum are the predominate flavors. The mouthfeel is nice. There is a strong body to stand up for itself along with a nice carbonation to follow. Overall highly drinkable. A great session/summer beer. 470 charactersMSchae1017, Jul 11, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this one on tap at HopCat in Grand Rapids,MI. (plug)
A: Nice and cloudy golden color as a Hefe should be. Good head retention with just enough lacing to let you know it's there.
S: Ripe bananas, hints of citrus, bready notes, and just a hint of lactic tartness.
T: Banana, banana, banana. Hints of warm bread, very faint clove spiciness, nice lemony tartness, bubblegum-like sweetness without being overly dominant. Oh yeah, did I mention bananas?
M: Not overly carbonated, extremely thirst quenching, creamy medium-light body, no perceivable alcohol heat, and a nice crisp finish.
D: About as close to perfection as it gets in the drinkability department. Amazingly well balanced and perfect for a warm, sunny day. 724 charactersframpin, Jul 10, 2008
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle
Pours a cloudy golden straw in color with about an inch of fluffy off-white head. Aroma is great, prominent, yet balanced, phenols and esters with a touch of wheat in the background. The banana esters are a bit more prominent than the clove-like phenols but don't completely overshadow them. The flavor is simply excellent. Moderate banana esters are dominant at first but then give way to a fleeting bubblegum flavor. Spicy clove phenols, also moderate, then come to the forefront. A slight tartness then appears in the relatively dry finish. The bubblegum flavor then briefly returns a bit more dominantly in the finish. For me the bubblegum in the finish was the only flaw in the flavor (I thought it just a bit too noticeable) otherwise this beer is easily a 5. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium body that is fairly creamy with moderate carbonation which wasn't quite enough in my opinion. Drinkability is great. This is a beer that I could drink all day long. My new benchmark for the style. 1,007 charactersmnj21655, Jul 10, 2008

A: Poured a beautiful hazy yellow/orange. There is definitely some unfiltered goodness going on in there. Constant carbonation activity going up the glass. Poured a huge, rocky,foamy, off white head. Created some decent lacing and had good retention. Beautiful beer.
S: Smell is of yeast, banana and the bubble gum sweetness that many people have pointed out. Smells very tasty.
T: Taste is of a great Hefe. Yeast flavor comes across very subtly. Banana fruitiness is there with just a touch of citrus. Malt and hops are present but take a back seat. A greatly balanced Hefe.
M: Perfect. Just enough carbonation but the brew is still creamy. The beer finishes pretty damned clean. No hint of alcohol heat. Incredibly refreshing. Very happy with this beer. 900 characterseveretends, Jul 09, 2008

S-Musty wheat malt. With the expected hefe yeast aroma of banana, clove and citrus fruit (lemon).
T-Certainly one of the best tasting hefes I have had. There must be a reason they are the oldest operatingbrewery in the world! A wonderful combination of sweet wheat malt lemony zing, bananas and clove. citrus,

S: After smelling this beer, I immediately had to have a drink - writing these sentences is broken by the smell wafting up and forcing me to drink more and more. Good stuff - bananas, weizen yeast, cloves, and a slight bubblegum-y scent. It is a rare day when the nose on a beer makes me this excited.
T: Not quite as awesome as the nose, but still fantastic. This is everything I expect from a good weizen - good yeast character, with a well-developed version of the characteristic banana taste. The clove character is also very present, and I can pick up a faint hint of that aforementioned bubblegum taste. These all blend well with the wheat flavor to make a beer that is very well-balanced. 
M: Very chill, lots of nice carbonation keeps things light. Slightly creamy, but not clinging. Refreshing.
D: If I had a case of these, it would be a very, VERY dangerous evening.
Weihenstephaner just earned itself a very special place in my heart. I am thoroughly impressed, and that's something coming from someone who has consumed a truly ludicrous amount of weizenbier over the last 4 months in Germany. 1,228 charactersjenitivecase, Jul 03, 2008

A: Nice looking dishwater reddish-blonde. 2 finger head that sticks around pretty gut. Das ist gut beir!

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Poured into a Weihenstephan glass. Pours a beautiful, murky golden-yellow. Ample carbonation rises from the bottom, and there's a creamy white head on top. I should've poured it more vigorously, I think. Great lacing.
S - Malted wheat, banana esters, clove and spicy yeast. Light floral undertones. 
T - I am admittedly not the hugest fan of Hefe's, but this one is a true exception. Light wheat notes, banana affects, yeasty goodness. Hopping is not noted, but I'm sure they're in here somewhere. Clean and fresh.
M - A little lighter than I think I'd prefer, but it'd kill the drinkability to have it any creamier.
D - Absolutely killer drinkability. I could drink this alll night on a boat or alll day at a picnic. A perfect brew for warm weather.
Notes: I always avoided this because I feared freshness issues, but when I saw some brand-new in a cooler yesterday, I figured the chance of it being old would be in the distributors hands, and not the stores. 
I would undoubtedly drink this again. 1,009 charactersSaucyA, Jul 01, 2008
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Has a cloudy, deep golden color. Nice thick/dense head, with decent retention. Very nice carbonation, making it look extremely lively and refreshing.
Smell: Very light smell actually, with hint of citrus and yeast. Very appealing.
Taste: Initial taste has a strong clove flavour with a hint of banana. The banana dissipates quickly and you're left with a spicy clove taste that lingers well after the swallow. Fairly complex flavour for a light and refreshing brew. 
Mouthfeel: It has a very nice carbonated, spicy, lively feel. You definitely know it's in your mouth.
Drinkability: Extremely easy to drink. It has good flavour that sticks with you but doesn't over power. Little to zero bitterness.
Conclusion: An excellent example of a Bavarian Hefeweissbier. 780 charactershrd, Jun 29, 2008

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Purchased a seemingly fresh six-pack of this at BevMo! in Orange.
A- Poured into a Widmer Hefeweizen glass, this beer pours a cloudy straw color accompanied by a massive white head with great retention and copious amounts of thick lacing.
S- Fruity aromas of ripe bananas and citrus rind are backed up by huge notes of wheat, yeast, clove spiciness, and honey. Slightly grassy and floral as well. 
T- Flavors of grainy wheat and ripe bananas fade to a spicy, yeasty finish.
M- Medium carbonation with a medium-bodied mouthfeel, but a bit more watery than I expected.
D- I could easily drink several of these in a sitting without getting bored or drunk, given the 5.4% ABV. 
An outstanding Hefeweizen. Highly recommended. 726 charactersTdizzle, Jun 28, 2008
3.4/5  rDev -22.7%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5On tap at Tyler's in Durham;
Wow, what a disappointment on tap!
One of my favorite beers arrives in its signature weizen glass with mostly-clear amber body and a fat finger of head. Too clear and too golden-amber. Looks wrong.
Smell has virtually none of the banana or clove I loved so much about the bottled version, but instead features more noticeable, herbal hops, and even a tinge of caramel, wrong to the point I thought I had a mispour. I didn't.
The taste lacks the fresh yeasty goodness I've come to associate with this beer. I don't know if the keg was old or needed a bit of agitation, or what, but this wasn't the beer I was anticipating when I ordered it.
Nowhere near as good as the bottle in this encounter! 727 characterscvstrickland, Jun 26, 2008

S: Damned delicious, wheaty with nice yeast aroma. My mouth is watering.
T: Smooth, really floral-wheaty. Fruity: bananas, with a nice bready yeast aftertaste.
M: Slightly watery initially, then accented by nice carbonation toward the end, tickling the tongue.
D: So help me if I can find these pint bottles for $2.50-$3 on the way to the beach, summer beer all the way. 464 characterswatkins, Jun 23, 2008
3.74/5  rDev -15%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sampled after the Live Oak hefe for a side-by-side of sorts.
Appearance - pours out a hazy orangish yellow, a very thick and cakey head on top, over two fingers in height and giving up ground very grudgingly. Lots of lace arcs and rainbows on the hefe glass.
Aroma - a doughy, yeasty smell with more spice and less banana. Good but not as livey and varied as the Live Oak.
Taste - a sweet, butterscotch flavor with the grain. I immediately grab the bottle and look for a freshnes date, but find none. Fruity follow-up, not bad. A bit of spicy balance post-swallow and hints of Cracker Jack on the finish (and occasional belch). Tasty enough but doesn't nail the style like I thought it would.
Mouthfeel - medium-bodied, crisp carbonation and a nice smoothness all do well for the beer.
Drinkability - I'd have it again, in fact I've had this a number of times and was interested to see how it stacked up against the #1 hefe. Though it really didn't match up as well as I thought it would, I still get this every year, it's one both me and the missus enjoy. 1,061 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Jun 23, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours medium gold in color with a good amount of cloudiness. Color borders on straw in the thinner parts of the glass. Head is plentiful, off-white, and rocky. A gentle pour still gave up over two inches. Retention is great. Lace is intricate and generous. This beer is picture perfect.
S - Wheat is the biggest part of the aroma. Notes of banana and pale malt back up the wheat very well. Hints of alcohol and hops lay in the background and are hard to detect. The wheat really steals the show with this beer. It stays constant throughout the aroma.
T - The wheat is not as strong as the smell would suggest. It is still the biggest part of the flavor. The secondary flavors are done very well and include: banana, pineapple, yeast, honey, peppery spice, and fresh bread. Just like the smell, some alcohol and hops are on the tail end and stay in a distant background.
M - Medium bodied with excellent carbonation. Finish is just a little bitter with a nice wheat bite.
D - Drinkability is very nice. This one has all the right qualities to make it a great beer. I would happily have more of this one. The relatively low alcohol and smooth flavors make it disappear pretty quick. Highly recommended. 1,208 characterscsmiley, Jun 23, 2008

Sweet beer with pronounced wheat character. Clove/coriander and orange citrus also present. Some hints of banana are there as well.

4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- super foam explosion. weird reverse cascade action is captivating, the foam undulates from the bottom as jet streams up bubbles continuously add to it. beautiful hazed canary yellow, golden, and brass. nearly snow white head is soapy and dense with a thin pitted membrane laid out over the top. this foam has amazing staying power and though it pops and fizzes and makes little dimples in its surface, it just doesn't seem to budge. when it finally finishes morphing, it takes on the form of a 1/2in thick foamy dish and pretty much stays that way aside from the abstract trails of lace it leaves behind.
S- fresh banana peel, clove, and lots of wheat. some bazooka bubblegum as well and a bit of floral lemony spiciness. yeast is just incredible, in-your-face, and completely controls the aroma. not a bad thing.
T- wheaty and fresh, the clove/banana/bubblegum backs off a little and other flavors come through. every kind of plain bread i can imagine, a light lemon blossom floweriness, and sharp yet mild noble hops in the form of bitter lemon peel and cut grass. underlying the yeasty sweetness is a raw pilsener flavor without all the bitterness. so very traditional tasting, using all the hefe elements to their full potential, i couldn't ask for anything more.
MF- crisp and refreshing on the front side, a little sugary on the back side which is most likely an illusion created by the yeast sweetness. if all you ever eat is sugar, what should you taste like? sweeet! but, eh, i'd like a little dryness. mid-high carb along with tons of wheat keep the body light and keep me focused and after the sweetness fades the finish is crisp and bready.
D- absolutely refreshing to say the least. aside from a gallon of water or an un-named less-than-flavorful american style lager that i only intend to chug, this would be what i dream of on a hot afternoon when my yard is clean and i'm covered with bugs and grass clippings. cheers to the oldest brewery in the world! 1,976 charactershustlesworth, Jun 18, 2008

Poured hazy golden, generous white head with active carbonation, great retention but not a lot of lacing. The smell is delightfully spicy with ginger and cloves, cinammon, banana and orange zest. The taste is similarly up front; wheat, citrus, a sharp edge and a malty bitterness in the finish. Balanced acidity, substantial body, smooth mouthfeel; I found this beer a great example of the style and a really satisfying, refreshing diversion from my evening routine. The only slight criticism might be that it was a bit gassy until it got some air, hardly a fault in a brew worth savouring like this one is. 659 charactersThatWineGuy, Jun 12, 2008

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A classic hefeweiss brewed at the world's oldest brewery. A beer I've had many times but bought anew for purposes of review.
Poured into a classic tall weissbeer glass. Displays a huge puffy head that floats atop a hazy golden liquid with lots of swirling bubbles. Aroma displays banana, vanilla, and light clove, with just a hint of citrus. The mouthfeel explodes with big carbonation and light body. Flavor is a nice blend of banana/vanilla with underlying spiciness. The key is in the balance - all the flavor elements blend nicely and nothing dominates. Many other hefe's tend to be heavy on one element or another but this one is perfect.
Overall, this is IMO the finest example of the style available outside Germany. A must try for any lover of the German hefeweiss style. 781 charactersmarksto, Jun 08, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale, murky gold. Big pillowy head and thick lacings. Right on target.
Banana/coconut on the nose, little bit of sweet lemon. 
Very clean wheat taste, somewhat powdery. Refreshingly crisp malt, dry grain. Fruitiness isn't overpowering as I find it often is in the style. The banana and lemon undertones are there, but they play second fiddle to the wheat and malt. Little bit of clove but not much spice to speak of. I get next to no alcohol at all, which is somewhat bizarre for the style. It's leaning towards a Belgian style wheat beer, hence the .5 knocked off taste. Not complaining though.
Very clean, refreshing beer, perfect for the season.
A gold-standard. Can't go wrong with this one. 707 charactersCanuckRover, Jun 07, 2008

Smells delicious. Subtle citrus and wheat. 
The flavors are blended together so it's hard to pick all of them out. A bit of clove, citrus, malt, wheat, and yeastyness. Very refreshing.
Mouthfeel fits good with this, clean and refreshing.
Incredibly refreshing. I guess they've had about 1000 years to perfect this, and it shows. 365 charactersStrix, Jun 05, 2008

I tried this beer on May 31, 2008 after purchasing from the Queen's Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a hazy orange colour with a generous bubbly head. The aroma was mild wheat, some hops, and some spiciness with a malty feel. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, slippery, with a lot of carbonation. The flavour was sweet and spicy with wheaty, malty, and soime fruit tones in the mix. 433 characterscyrenaica, Jun 04, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Newly brought into the LCBO. Grabbed this one off the shelf ASAP. Served in a Leffe goblet as I was splitting it (otherwise in a weizen glass...)
Good hefe look. Cloudy, with some suspended particles (I rolled the bottle), a bit orangey vs other hefes I've had. Great head. Less lacing than Denison's though.
Notes of banana (sweet, rummy), cloves, bubblegum. A hint of citrus. Basically, no off notes.
In relation to other hefes I'd say this one was a bit sweeter. Same combination of flavours as in the aroma, lots of bubblegum which I enjoy. Great feel, not too carbonated. Abv hidden well, this is like juice. 616 charactersAntilochus, Jun 03, 2008

The usual cloves and bananas are present, for sure, but its solid taste and well-balanced craftbeership must be given full marks for steady quality.

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is a very nice Hefe from a long standing German brew house. The beer pours a cloudy golden amber with plenty of white bubbly head and lacing. The taste is candied, sweet, banana, clove, and somewhat spicy. This is a very nice, easily drinkable hefe and worth seeking out. I had this at a gathering and did not have the opportunity to do a contemplative review, but I will review this beer in more detail at a later time. My first reactions and impressions were quite positive. I think I like the Ayinger Hefe a bit more, but this beer hits all the right notes. L'Chaim.
Re-review August 2009: The wonderful clove and candied flavors in the yeast really make this an enjoyable hefe. There is a touch of saltene dryness in the finish, and the beer is quite crisp and carbonated throughout. This is a first rate hefe, I'm adding points. 839 charactersalbern, Jun 01, 2008

Honestly, not quite as much flavor as I was hoping for. I've had this before and have found it to be tastier. I bought the bottle at a store that's not a "beer" store, so this might have been sitting on the shelf for a while. Will re-rate with another bottle. 384 charactersRomanW70, Jun 01, 2008

4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a weizen glass. Said to be maybe the best Hefe in the world. Lets see how it holds up.
Appearance - A hazy orangish gold color. Beautiful head which came to a monster three fingers. Head is a creamy, clumpy, cloudy looking white. Thick lacing all around the glass as the head subsided.
Smell - Chocked full of banana and lemon. Very deep malt smell, and whiffs of wheat are present.
Taste & Mouthfeel - Awesome creaminess up front. Banana and lemon comes through behind the creamy malts. Wheat and cloves help to balance this one out in a beautiful way. Very crisp, lite, and refreshing.
Drinkability - Picked this one up in Chicago, and have anxiously been waiting to crack it open. I love hefe-weizens in the spring, and have relied on Paulaner which is fantastic, and available here in Louisiana. This is a masterful stab at a hefe-weizen. If it were available here, I would cherish it all spring long. 944 charactersryrust5301, May 29, 2008

T/M: A wonderful mix of every enjoyable ingredient in a traditional hefeweizen. Very crisp and refreshing taste. A soft hop taste and slight fruitiness. The best I've ever tasted
D: Hands down the best hefeweizen that i've ever had. It is the perfect blend of ingredients. If I had access to this locally it would be in my fridge all year round. If you like hefeweizens it's a must try! 623 charactersShrLSU, May 29, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours an unclear pale orange colour. Large amounts of an off-white head that sinks away relatively quickly.
Sweet, complex smell. Perhaps not as much banana in this as in some other hefe-weissens I have sampled lately, like for instance the Paulaner. Other elements in the nose are cloves and, of course, wheat.
Dry taste, carboration is medium, perhaps more intense than in the Franziskaner, but less than in the Paulaner. Taste is dominated by wheat aromas accompanied by cloves and citrus fruits
Feels very good in the mouth. A smooth feeling that ends with a little sting. Very drinkable. 595 charactersCh1mpy, May 28, 2008

A: Pours a hazy pale straw yellow, very pretty. A very large pearly white head forms and holds tight. A perpetual steam of tiny carbonation bubbles keeps it up. Nice lacing throughout.
S: Very nice. Pleasantly subtle wheat, banana, clove, yeasty esters... just right. Not overpowering as most Hefeweizen seem to be, IMO. Just nice and soft.
T/M: Again, very soft on the palate but you can still taste everything. The malts add a touch of sweetness to balance out the delicate hops and yeast. Body is light, crisp, and very refreshing. The constant flow of carbonation keeps things alive light on the palate.
D: This is probably the only Hefeweizen that I'll drink on any kind of basis. Drinkability is obsurd. Perfect for summer. An outstanding beer. 845 characterspwoods, May 28, 2008

Head dissipated in about 1 minute. Color is straw, slightly cloudy, I even dumped all the yeast into the glass.
Smell: cloves , what else can I say. Kind of like standing in a field of cloves.
Taste: very clovey, some dryness in the back of the mouth. A tad of sweetness trying to get out but the carbonation keeps it back. 
Mouthfeel: Another 5. creamy very nice.
Drinkability : that's what these beers are made for. 
This is a very nice beer which showcases Weihenstephan's amazing hefe yeast. Perfectly done. 628 charactersJonathanL7890, May 27, 2008

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 516.9 oz bottle.
Pours a pale, slightly cloudy golden color with an enormous amount of creamy head which does not dissipate except to release a few large bubbles. What is left resembles soft cotton.
Smells sour, citric & spicy with the trademark banana-wheat aroma of a hefeweiss. Even more powerful than most German versions of the variety (which tend to be very fragrent).
Flavors are very pronunced but surprisingly smooth. There is a sourness to it, but not as bitingly sharp as others of the variety. Banana/clove is there, as well as yeast, wheat & citric acid. Everything is well-balanced as it is lively on the tongue, but smooth on the palate as it goes down.
Carbonation remains throughout and the mouth is left tingling with the yeast, hop & spicy elements of the brew.
All I can say is, Wow. I love a good German weissbier and this is the best I've had yet, even moreso than my previous favorite from Paulaner. This brewery is apparently one who can live up to its billing & history. I will definitely be drinking more of this in the near (and hopefully, far) future. 1,078 charactersNatural510, May 22, 2008

Pours a majestic light cloudy yellow with orange hints into my Weihenstephaner weizen glass. Has a huge four-finger head which the beer constantly replenishes thanks to the yeast and thousands of tiny bubbles in the body of the beer. Heavy clove and vine-ripened banana in the aroma, very dry, earthy and tropical with a little citrus zest thrown in. Taste is cool crisp and refreshing banana bread in the taste, very light and citrusy. Easily refreshing and smooth this brew is.
Easily one of the greatest brews in the world, blows the other hefes out of the water. It's great on tap as well. 641 characterssaintwarrick, May 22, 2008

S- This is what a hefe should smell like. Clove, banana, pepper, Tart orange and other citrus meet the nose. 
T- The bubble carbonation tingles the tongue but gives way to a nice ginger spice, clove, and light pepper. There is also a light banana component but it's just right. This is outstanding. 
M- Initially, the mouthfeel is a touch cloying, but lessens after a bit. This beer has a great finish that is nice and yeasty but tart.

M: Crisp and refreshing, very little hop bitterness, nice level of carbonation.
D: Excellent
Disclaimer: wheat beers are far from my favorite style, but I am trying to not hold that against this beer and review it accordingly. For those who do like wheat beers, this is the epitome and sets the bar. 582 charactersPhenom, May 17, 2008

A - A hazy golden yellow with a great white foamy head that retains farily well. The weizen glass really brings out the best in this beer. 
S - Banana and clove aromas are prevalent, with wheat, spice, and alcohol in the back. Great nose on this hefeweizen; it seemed to smell sweeter as it warmed, as well
T&M - A subtle banana flavor that blends real well with the wheat profile. The flavors last real well when held on the tongue. Slick and light bodied with a very clean finish. Definitely a delicious hefeweizen!
D - An excellent session beer, for sure. Low ABV, great flavor, light body, and a clean finish make this beer very drinkable. Hopefully I'll be able to find this again in Alabama 739 charactersAmishT, May 14, 2008

Hazy light golden, with a good white head and retention.
Aroma is citric, and perhaps a bit too citric, along with bubblegum and bananas. 
It is light, refreshing and easy to drink, but the taste, similar to the aroma, is slightly exaggerated on the citric fruits, limiting a little bit its drinkability. Nonetheless, a very good hefeweizen, just not the best IMHO. 428 charactersbrdc, May 07, 2008

A - Hazy orangish color with a fair bit of yeast sediment. Huge pillowy, 3-4 finger head with decent retention, settles to white cap. Moderate lacing.
S - Fragrant with bananas and citrus, faint clove and wheat malt as well. 
T - Starts off a little sweet with the bananas, but soon dives into clove and wheat. Yeasty flavor kicks in near the finish, where a wash of lemon peel and hop bitterness comes through. Alcohol tends to shine through a tad.
M - Light to medium bodied, with prickly carbonation.
D - A great session beer aside from cost; the only thing that cost it half a point was the somewhat prickly carbonation. The flavor however, never gets old and the light/medium body is perfect for drinking.
Overall I prefer Franziskaner when it comes to hefe's, but Weihenstephaner ties for second along with Maisel's Weisse. 881 charactersPatrickJR, May 07, 2008

Flavor hits with a very solid creamy wheat taste - banana and lemon again, clove, cracker, delicate hops and extremely slight bubblegum. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel with a fine pepper tinge. Please refrain from garnishing with a lemon or orange, as it will mask some of the greatness actually in this beer. 472 charactersbrandoneast, May 06, 2008

Smell was of citrus with a hint of banana in the background. I couldn't detect much else. The taste followed suit and also I noticed the wheat in there.
The mouthfeel was great. It wasn't too thin, and left me wanting another one. While it wasn't my favorite hefe, it was pretty damn good. 485 charactersdaythree16, May 05, 2008

The hazy cloudy straw yellow appearance is standard for the style. But once you get a whiff of the citrusy aroma, you know that you're in for a treat. The taste is spectacular -- the perfect mix of tartness, fruityness and wheat flavors. A very flavorful, drinkable brew and for an import, this was reasonably priced. 419 charactersWaveRebel51, May 05, 2008

S: Wheat sweetness, some slight mellowed out banana. Faint lemon smells in the background.
T&M: Wheat, slightly sweet and non-acidic citrus flavors (from the yeast?). Theres some slight clove spice midway through, along with a perpetual banana flavor, as well. This hefeweizen has an absolutely fantastic taste. Easily the best hef I've had to date. It's medium bodied with a lot of carbonation and a smooth, silky mouthfeel. The beer coats well and the flavor stays with you a long time.
D: Incredibly drinkable. This one's unique flavor profile, rich and robust aroma, and smooth, tasty finish make it one hell of a drinkable beer.

A= This wheat beer poured a dark gold to orange color, unfiltered and hazy. The head was out of control, easily 3-4 inches, white and chunky, with a moderate pour in a hefeweizen glass. Lacing was thick and impressive as well. 
S= Beautiful malty goodness. Sweetness with fruity aromas of bubblegum, bananas, and yeast. 
T= Obvious forward notes of wheat, fruity yeast, and a hint of citrus. Some cloves, but not over the top. Not much in the way of hop taste here. Very slightly sour and dry at the very end. 
MF= This one sports a medium body that is lifted significantly by the high carbonation. Feels crisp and clean for the style. 
D= Hefe's are not my favorite, but this is the best I have ever had. This beer is in balance, the wheat and yeast play nicely together and there is not toto much of the banana/clove flavor that everyone wants to pump their wheat beers full of.

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5500 ml bottle into a Hefe glass. 
Pours a hazy golden orange with a big poof of foamy brite-white head. Shrinks down into a good looking thin and creamy retention that leaves just huge lacing behind. The aroma is a little like a fruit salad off the bat, with accents of oranges and banana esters, followed by clove, corriander, yeast, wheat, and backing sweetness. Quite a lot going on! 
The taste is just as complex and well balanced as the aroma. Zesty orange and prominant banana notes up front mixed with a spicy clove presence meld into a earthy blend of caramel sweetness and yeast. There is also just a touch of grassy, light hop bitterness that runs throughout, bringing a little bit of pop to the proceedings. The mouthfeel has a pleasant light medium feel that while going down incredibly smooth still has a bit of a full feel with just the right amount of crisp carbonation. 
Wow, a solid Hefe for sure and probably one of the best I've had with a potent mix of flavors that just pop and an oh-so-easy drinkibility. This was delicous and I will definitley be seeking more of it out with the upcoming warm weather. 1,127 charactersKegatron, Apr 29, 2008

A: Peach/orange color with a thick off white head with a ton of structure. Light lacing.
S: Aromas of lots of banana and plenty of yeast. Other fruitiness as well with plenty of non overbearing spices. Really shined in this aspect, appetizing.
T: Balance of everything was perfect for this style of beer. Been having more of the style lately and the taste on this one surpasses most if not all. The sweetness, bitterness, spiciness, and yeasty flavors are all in happy harmony. Banana was dominant flavor you are left with.
M: Extremely enjoyable in that it was light on the palete and the carbonation was pinpoint. Smooth and balanced spices with out being overly sweet.
D: Not thick or tiring, could drink these all season and plan on doing so. Very light and this one is at the head of the class.

Wheaty aroma with some sweetness, honey, and apple. Some mild spice in the nose as well as yeast and bright lemon.
Refreshing and crisp flavors. Starts mildly sweet before wheat, biscuit and some fruit come in. Earthy yeast character kicks in with a hints of lemon and dash of clove. Light hop bitterness, gets drier toward the end with some cracker. Light nuttiness rounds things out. Not much banana or bubble gum, which makes it crisper. Linger toasted grain with a bone dry finish.
Medium bodied and smooth. Goes down easy with great flavor. Easier to drink than the more fruity hefeweizens. Could drink this all day - summer, spring, or fall. One of those beers you always should have on hand. 835 charactersLupe, Apr 25, 2008

Wheatish malt with a great flavor, hops minimal, not overly sweet or dry, just right.
Full bodied with just right carbonation, this is a perfect choice of this type, lovely.
Drinkable all day long, especially in the summer, a great beer to keep around. 442 charactersrobbyc1, Apr 23, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: It's very hazy and golden in color. You can see through it, but it's certainly cloudy. No evidence of any sediment. Very thick, three finger foamy white head sits on top was slow to dissipate. Speckles of lace remained.
Smell: There's an initial blast of banana, clove, and other secondary herbal spices. It blends with a strong yeasty-breadlike aroma. A nice, fresh grassy and earthy smell lies at the core and really permeates the nose. It's slow to emerge but provides a nice foundation for the beer. There are very faint malt and hop scents present. It's an exemplary smell for the style.
Taste: Banana and clove spices attack the palate and are immediately followed by a healthy dose of yeast. It's a nice blend and creates a very refreshing flavor. It is grassy and earthy. Very similar to nicely done wheat ale. There's a lemony citrus flavor present that is not noticeable in smell. When coupled with the light caramel malt, it makes for a nice sweet element. It's lightly hopped and has an ever so slight bitter bite to it. Toward the end, the yeasty flavor really sticks out and clings to the palate.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied and extremely drinkable. Carbonation is just right and its low abv heightens drinkability. It's warm here at the moment and this is perfect. I could drink this all day (and night) during the warmer seasons.
This is a very good beer and is a great representation of the style. Perhaps it's the benchmark. It's the best Hefe I've had to date. Generally, it's not one of my favorite styles. But, I learned tonight that a well done Hefe is a very fine beer. Definitely recommended. 1,646 charactersprototypic, Apr 23, 2008
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - a golden amber color, a tad cloudy, about what i expected based on other HWs that I've experienced, very very low head and no lace.
S - sweet, a good mixture of aromas
T - good mix of flavors, fruity, strong wheat flavor
M - compared to other reviews the carbonation seemed very low to what other people have experienced, made it much more enjoyable for me. Rather soft I would say.
D - could definitely continue drinking this throughout the day, not too heavy, the ABV hit me pretty hard but I'm also just getting into beer so that is probably why. Very, very excellent beer, though my experience with it out of the bottle hasn't been the greatest compared to other HWs

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from 500 ml into big Red Oak mug...
Bubble bath of cream-colored bountiful head with soapy lacing. Cream soda/banana/cloudy natural honey body with sparse carbonation. A little darker than your average HW; that's by no means a bad thing.
Big banana/yeast estery presence with a fair amount of butterscotch. Slight to moderate coriander tones with a little bitter lemon/orange zest.
Nice, viscous butterscotch/caramel hit from front to back. With mild banana it gives off a banana split tone without the strawberry and fudge! Very clean with slight zesty, wheaty bitterness.
More warming than normal for style with carbonation, wheat and yeast. Nice citrus zesty pucker.
A little heavy for a HW but this is not a detriment; it's very enjoyable. 755 charactersIBUnit63, Apr 20, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from 12oz brown bottle into a clear pint glass
A: Beautiful hazy golden with towering white head and tons of lacing.
S: Citrus and tangy wheat with sweetness as the dominating smell.
T: Bold and forward with complex, tangy wheat flavor and delicious fruitiness of apricot, pear, banana, clove, and soft cinnamon.
M: Very full-bodied and coats like no other hefe. Carbonation is high but in line for a wheat beer. Soft wheat/malt aftertaste.
D: A most excellent wheat beer that sets the standards for hefeweizens everywhere. 535 charactersargock, Apr 19, 2008
4.02/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Had this on tap and poured into a pint glass at Legends of Notre Dame on 4/18/08.
A -looks just like a Hefe should as it was orange mixed in with dark gold, bronze, and dark amber. Was cloudy and definitely had a haze to it as well that let barely any light shine through. Had a nice creamy, white head that sat on tap but left minimal lacing.
S - big whiffs of banana, orange and clove come off. The banana and clove really seem to pop and give this beer its big nose.
T - The biggest initial flavor really seemed to be bubblegum to me. There was a hint of banana that shined through as well and this seemed mixed with clove and a hint of lemon citrus. Was well balanced as no one flavor really seemed to dominate the flavor profile. 
MF - lots of carbonation in this one that helps to make the citrus flavors really pop. Also, get a mouthfull of a yeasty, bready feeling that just makes your mouth really feel full. The only downside for me was that the carbonation was so unrelenting that it became hard to notice anything else. Because of this, there was a lot of tingling left in the mouth after drinking.
D - overall, one of the great session beers as it has a lot of flavor for the style. The one downside though for this beer was that the carbonation was so unrelenting that I didn't really feel like having another one. That really hurt the drinkability for me as despite everything else going on, I would really wait to have another. 1,448 charactersjeonseh, Apr 19, 2008
4.76/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a weiss glass. Last bit in the bottle swirled around and poured in the center of the head.
Appearance - Yellow orange color, cloudy, 2 finger head which kept all the way down the glass. Some lacing.
Smell - The nose on this beer was surprisingly very neutral, and crisp. Malty dryness, a slight note of citrus.
Taste - Very balanced. Notes of sweetness evened out with a touch of tanginess and very subtle bitterness. The aftertaste was even, consistent, almost neutral. Did not have the overly strong notes of banana or fruit like some other weiss beers I've had. Which is what I absolutely loved about this beer. Very well crafted. The wonderful evenness made it seem like a fine champagne. 
Mouthfeel - A good light heartiness to it. Round and perfect.
Drinkability - The most drinkable Hefeweiss that I've encountered. Not overly filling. I would say even people who are not fans of Hefeweiss beers would admit that this is delicious. 977 charactersrkinsella, Apr 13, 2008

Smell - sharp musty damp wehat, almost skunky

Mouthfeel - OK, nice soft carbonation
Drinkability - easily drinkable, but better if you don't smell it as you drink it...
Bad bottle perhaps? Didn't meet the classic/traditional example on this sampling. Would like to try again, but, will have to call it as I taste it in the meantime. 462 charactersSaltyLime, Apr 13, 2008

Poured a cloudy golden yellow color with small white head, served with a lemon wedge. Smells strong of yeast, spices, wheat, lemons, and banana. Taste starts off with sweet wheat, then clove, yeast, and bananas come into the picture, finishes with lemon flavors. Medium light in body, nice carbonation, smooth and refreshing, easy to drink. A really fantastic hefe, very sessionable. 429 charactersHopDerek, Apr 07, 2008

4.07/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This poured a murky orange color with a dense but small white head. The lacing is superb. The aroma is dominated by lemon and yeast. The sweet maltiness is very rich. Earthy at the begining of the sip, the lemon and sweet flavor comes out through the aftertaste. The spices(especially clove) and yeast dominates the palate. The body is sharp from the carbonation but smooth and creamy in feel. Bitterness from hops is light but nice as it lingers and increases through the session.
The earthy dirt flavor gets to me though. Because of that I slightly prefer Franziskaner but this is still an excellent brew. 608 characterskbnooshay, Apr 04, 2008

Earthy wheat aroma. Fruit such as light pear, taste is wheat malt, some spice hop notes and light fruity accents. Maybe a little bitter hop finish, but nothing that lingers. I'm left with a clean fruity finish.
Nice and light in body, very drinkable any time if day or year. 401 charactersZimZamZoom, Apr 03, 2008

S - Strong banana & clove yeast aromas
T - The banana-like yeast flavors are very prevalent in this bottle, almost banana bread like. Body has notes of light malts and citrus. Finishes with lingering banana notes. An all around clean & well-balanced hefe
M - Light bodied with a clean finish. Good carbonation that doesn't overwhelm the palate

Slight nutty, nearly caramel notes through the middle, melon fruit notes as it warms, and the finish dries up nicely with notes of banana and more bitter citrus character.

It slowly recedes, leaving huge chunks of lace on the glass. Color is a bright, yet hazy golden yellow.
Smell is mildly musty from the yeast, with a mellow lemon grass. The lemon is more enhanced with the taste and has a nice clove snap. Very mellow and relaxed.
Mouthfeel is verges on creamy it is so smooth. Mild carbonation just barely lets itself be known. This is a highly, Highly drinkable beer. It is so mellow and relaxed that it just slides down. I really want to stock up on these to session for an entire night. 648 charactersbort11, Mar 29, 2008

A- Cloudy, light peach skin in color. Thick, creamy white head that dissipates into a thin skin on the top of the brew. Moderate lacing,

The look is sunny yellow and hazy with a top of heavenly clouds for a head.
The smell is of light,fruits and citrus with cloves. I think I detect so many different things when I take a sniff of this brew. All of them are grand. The taste is sweet,yeast, banana,lemon and spice. One could go on about how good it is and the point is to go out and drink it. It has malts to balance and the sweetness is just right.
The feel is smooth,medium body, high carbonation and yeasty. I could drink this all night and I feel it is one of the best beers I have ever had. Certainly the best for it's style.
+ Buy the right glass for this beer,you will not regret it.
Man, I really love this beer. When I saw the movie "Beer fest" I imagined that the secret brew recipe tasted like Weihenstephaner. 
Notes: It is true that learning to pronounce this beer's name makes you seem smarter and even impresses the bartenders.But really,one should just know how to pronounce what one is drinking.This one takes practice. 1,019 charactersLexluthor33, Mar 22, 2008

Just don't forget to get all the active east out of the bottle for the head cap. The beer had a strong wheat and citrus aroma. It also tasted the same. The feel was refreshing and rewarding because sometimes the pour can backfire on you leaving you with half of the bottle. It was very easy to drink and a treat if you have a hard time finding it. 447 charactersROMER79, Mar 21, 2008

S: Very complex, yeasty smells, spicy, banana, faint hint of wheat malts. No hops. 
T: Taste is of faint wheat malts, no hops and complex yeast flavors. Banana, banana, banana pops out and hangs in the mouth. Extremely light hop taste, fades very quickly to nothing. Absolutely delicious.
M: Thin, light, crisp. Everything that this style offers. Perfect carbonation. Slick in the mouth. Can't ask for much more in this one.
D: This is the most drinkable hefe I've ever encountered. This would be absolutely perfect for a summer's day. After finally having this it will be tough to drink American Hefe's. Absolutely perfect. 972 characterspokesbeerdude, Mar 11, 2008

Awesome aroma of wheat, yeast, mild spice and a sweet fruitiness. When I lifted my weizen glass to my nose I was reminded why I love this style so much.
Flavor is a nice blend of wheat malt, yeast, and spiced fruit with a mild clove undertone. Very little bitterness. Sweet fruitiness lingers on the tongue.
Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with just the right level of carbonation. Fairly light body.
Very drinkable and refreshing. Flavorful, but not filling. I could drink these one after the other on a nice hot summer day. A great Hefe. 714 charactersHoagie1973, Mar 09, 2008

the aroma contains a evenly balanced slightly unripe banana, clove, lemon zest, and wheat bread. faint sausage-y smoke aroma, very slight though.
the taste follows suit with a delicious banana, vanilla, clove. there is a creamy breadiness behind this all with those clean expertly placed wheat charactristics. with warmth you notice that it's a little peppery. faintly citrusy without significant tang. superb.
the mouth is nearly perfect with a medium body and chewy, but creamy textureand active delicate carbonation.

An inch of creamy, buff-beige head retains effortlessly atop a hazy, golden-orange body. Carbonation everywhere, the head just won't go away. Decent lacing left along the drinking side of the pint. The aroma a nice blend of banana, bubblegum and clove. Sweet, wheat-heavy breaded malts, vanilla cream, and orange zest round out the delectable scent.
Yeasty banana, thick wheat, and pale malt give the flavor a quaffable, sweet body. I can see how this beer has achieved its worldwide popularity, as it's easily one of the more drinkable beers I've come across. Mouthfeel is creamy and semi-thick for a Hefeweizen, with a peppery bite and a smooth, refreshing finish. I was quite impressed with this one, and I will definately be having it again at some point (hopefully on-tap next time). 869 characterswagenvolks, Mar 02, 2008

Pours a cloudy amber-gold with a two-fingerhead. Decent lacing with a lot of carbonation.
The nose is yeast, wheat, & lemon. Grainy after with a nice dose of of a peppery/clove hopiness. 
Very crisp on the palate. A sour-honeycomb flavor that blends well with the yeast & wheat breadiness. You get a little pop of spicey hop that leaves the mouth a bit dry.
This one went well with the sausage, portabellas, peppers,and asparagus I was shoveling down for lunch. I am trying to sample and appreciate more hefeweizens and German brews. A vey solid beer and will bring some down for the old man who digs his Deutsch suds. 638 charactersjdoncbus, Mar 01, 2008

Smell: Ripe bananas and cream; clove; sweetness.
Taste: Pretty much just like the smell. Bananas and clove (with clove more prominent). Slight cigar kind of after taste. A little bit of bitterness. A nice sweetness arises as the beer warms up a bit.

There was a mild sweet smell with hints of spice and some banana and other citrus notes. My lips were met with a nice frothy head and the taste was sweet and earthy. Very evident flavor of banana and a nice wheat flavor. This is a good beer and with the years of experience this brewery has I see why they have lasted so long. 516 charactersWJVII, Feb 29, 2008

Color is a very light amber color with a massive fluffy white head. Smell is very zesty. There is a huge spice presence here of clove. Aroma is also quite lemony. Taste delivers on the spiciness and fruitiness, though I detected some banana and wheat. Nice and crisp. Mouthfeel is perfect. Medium body with peppy carbonation complements the flavor perfectly. Tasty and easily sessionable. 529 charactersatrus138, Feb 27, 2008

S- Nice Belgian nose. Banana, cloves, coriander and yeast. Really nice hefe nose.
T- Wheaty, yeasty, and a bit fruity. This is a really tasty and refreshing beer. This beer is also a little spicy. Really gives it a nice contrast to the wheat and yeast flavors. Man this is great tasting.
M- This is a perfect hefeweizen. Nice and creamy with a great carbonation. 
D- I will be drinking a ton of this come the summer. I wish it was warm now I would be sitting on my balcony drinking this and watch the 'C' line pass by. 623 charactersMudpuppet, Feb 27, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this into my hefe glass and received a nice cloudy, orange body that was very dense with a one-finger head that slowly faded and left minor lacings. Note: yeast sediments in bottle so shake bottom part, I did a tad but there were tiny particles in the bottom of my glass.
A very yeasty and citrusy smell, with a pinch of earthiness and sweetness. I can't really place any of them directly, but there in the aroma when you take a nice whiff and drinking out of a hefe glass you'll smell every time you take a sip.
This is a very acidic brew, sharp and crisp. A rather heavy body that is accentuated with orange and banana fruit flavors, among others, with some clove that creates an overall impression of softness on the backbite. The softness reminded me of bubblegum or something, because it was a tad sweet. In fact, the beer was a little slick going down. 
Overall, not only is this a great hefe and a great session beer, but it is complex and not just overly fruity or overly sweet like other wheats. 1,011 charactersclayrock81, Feb 24, 2008

A great tasting wheat beer where you can really taste the wheat....has a earthy taste. Alot of carbonation and a hint of citrus possible lemon.

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5poured from a 500mL bottle into a tall tulip weiss glass (consumed: 2/14/08)
A: Pours a gorgeous hazy, tawny, gold, with a huge rocky white head, which in turn seems to last forever & a day. I think I could take a nap on this beer's head. Throughout the beer, it leaves behind huge chunks of lacing that remind me of the Archipelegos.
S: Yeast is right there in your face, lots of cloves, bubblegum and a slight tart lemony scent are all present too. Some nice fresh-baked bread brings it all together, this is an amazing smelling beer.
T/M: Sweetness hits the tip of the tongue immediately, but not cloyingly so. Followed by a very creamy, almost buttery body and some nice citric bite. Loads of bready malt & cereal grain flavors combine with the tanginess of the wheat and lead to a enjoyably astringent finish. A delicious beer that often winds up being gulped and not sipped.
D: One of the all-time greats, probably THE wheat beer that all others are measured against. One of the most drinkable beers around. 1,017 charactersmarkgugs, Feb 20, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured a 16.9oz bottle into a Chimay chalice. Pours a hazy golden straw with a big billowing head that subsided into thin layer of white bubbles. Aroma is big on the banana with vanilla and a slightly grassy aroma. Taste is much the same with banana being the spotlighted flavor. Also there is a slight salty tinge to the finish of the beer. Mouthfeel is full with because of the lack of filtering. Wheat beers are about the most drinkable beer style in my opinion. There is absolutely nothing better on a hot day then drinking a cold Hefe. Very tasty stuff. 558 charactershwwty4, Feb 19, 2008
4.73/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a typical pint glass - all my tall glasses were unfortunately dirty.
Appearance was beautiful, pale, cloudy golden yellow, with a pretty head with moderate retention and thick sheets of runny lacing. Such a refreshing looking beer.
Smell is crisp and bright, wheat notes dominate, with lemon peel and yeast notes present. Very nice, though not outstanding.
Taste, on the other hand, is outstanding. Excellently balanced, with a very noticeable flavor progression. Wheat starts it off with a very earthy, spicy kick. Beer is mildly bitter and mildly tart, and alcohol is present but works well in harmony with everything else. Lemon is present in the aftertaste. Just a really earthy, tasty, and surprisingly complex beer (for a hefeweizen) - blows me away every time.
Mouthfeel is light and crisp and refreshing, carbonation works wonders in conjunction with the flavor profile. Covers the whole mouth in a creamy, glorious blanket. Delicious.
Drinkability is as good as you can get. This beer isn't too sweet, isn't too bitter, isn't too tart, isn't too fruity, and isn't too alcoholic - it's a perfect balance of every good aspect of a good beer, the shining example of the style, and a true all-around classic. 1,252 charactersCrellMoset, Feb 15, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5poured from 1pint.9 floz bottle into the brewery's eponymous hefe glass. 
A- Beautiful. Slow pour reveals hazy golden straw with visible carbonation activity from bottom to top, voluminous 4-5 finger head, consistent and tight small foam bubbles, recedes slowly over the course of drinking to 1/2 finger head retention to the bottom of the glass. Spotty lacing at best- second bottle in a different glass resulted in better lacing. Overall, simply a beautiful beer to look at in a weizen glass. 
S- Banana, damp sweet hay, vanilla, smell of sweet cream and nutty browned butter even! Mild fruits throughout the smell, a little citric as well, wonderful aroma.
T- Banana, vanilla again, hops are not strong- perhaps just enough tannin? to be slightly astringent, contributing to a drier finish than one would expect with these kinds of aromas. Sweetness (malts?) is mild but very welcome and excellently balanced. Flavor reminded me of sweet cream butter. Slight tang from citic component, but that may just be the smell coming back in.
M- SOOO smooth and SOOOO creamy. The foam of the head is soooo soft in the mouth, almost fluffy. Like a thin, foamed creme anglaise almost in the mouth, with similar classic flavors. The carbonation is perfectly complementary, not too harsh, but present enough to provide lightness and refreshing lift.
Overall, this beer is amazing. Had mine with a steamed whole tilapia, cantonese styled. Went wonderfully- brought out more of the fruity components of the beer and balanced so well with the delicate steamed fish. A classic beer on so many levels, no wonder why every other weiss is attempting to use this as the benchmark! 1,666 charactersABCJiugui, Feb 11, 2008

smells of banana and yeasty, fresh white bread. hint of citrus or peach.
gentle, fruity sweetness is held at bay with an equally gentle hop bitterness that flows into a nicely malty, yet semi-dry finish. and pleasant, very faint acidity. notes of clove-like spice and lemon along with traces of the nutty yeast.
pretty silky smooth, with carbonation to keep things refreshed.

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Hefe's aren't my favorite style, but this is one damn good beer. Poured a cloudy yellow/orange with a massive off white head.
Smell is fruity, with bananas and lemon dominating the aromas. The taste starts with bananas, quickly giving way to a spicy clove flavor. One of my biggest complaints with wheat beers is a rosemary flavor that just doesn't seem to work well in beer. This one has none of that. Just the nice spicy flavors of a premium cigar. It ends crisp, with good carbonation, and some lemon peel to say goodbye.
As it warms, the bitter flavors come out more. This isn't always a bad thing, but can hurt drinkability as the alcohol becomes more noticable.
Solid, solid beer. From the oldest brewery in the world, no less. 736 charactersElGrecoVerde, Feb 02, 2008

4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Far and away the best Hefeweizen I have had to date. Maintains the sweetness taste of a wheat beer but has much more of a stronger beer feel. Perfect for someone who wants a strong wheat beer but doesn't want to lose the taste.
Has the same foggy appearance of a wheat beer and mouthfeel. But goes down smoother and with much more of a beer after taste rather than the wicked sweet after taste of some other wheat beers.
I am a true beliere in Hefeweuzens and other wheat beers and I can safely say this is the best bottled one I have had short of actually Bavaria. 567 charactersLetsGoQuakers, Jan 29, 2008

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Amazing.
When I first started drinking Hefe's, I never knew that there were beers like this. Poured into one of my Thinkgeek "Insert Beer" pint glasses, and was a lovely caramel. Extremely hazy, with a slight head to it. The head left a nice lace on the inside of the glass, while the beer itself was very drinkable. It left a pleasant feel on the tounge, and felt very refreshing.
As for the flavor, there are heavy hints of citrus, along with some herbal hints. The after taste comes off slightly bitter, but not in a bad way, and as mentioned in prior comments, the aftertaste tends to differ between the hoppiness and a citrus ting. The initial sip does take you by surprise, but as you enjoy the beer, it does get easier to drink, I could see myself drinking these during the summer. 790 charactersKingPuuChuu, Jan 24, 2008
4.84/5  rDev +10%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into my Witte tumbler. 
Looks much like a typical hefeweizen, but the head is incredibly retentive. It domes over the top of the glass but does not spill over the side. As it slowly falls, it leaves huge dish-bubble lacing. The beer itself is a deep honey shade with consistent, small bubbles of carbonation rising throughout. The smell is great. It smells really fresh, not that kind of cardboard, bland aroma that some hefeweizens get. Yeast smells similar to Franziskaner, very round and slightly Belgian-like, but with it's own bready funk, rather than a Belgian banana funk. 
Wow. I didn't know there were hefeweizens that tasted like this. It has an awesome bready malt that combines with the yeast to create an almost vanilla bean character. It is so full of flavor and rich. The citrus is way towards the end with just a quick lemon zest snap. It moves from a full, thick, chewy mouthfeel to a lighter and more crisp finish. Slight hop bitterness fights with the citrus to provide a slightly different finish from sip to sip. This is the most well balanced hefeweizen I've tried so far. There is enough going on that there isn't that dull, waxy overtone that makes you sick of drinking it. I am impressed by this beer. 1,234 charactersRudgers73, Jan 23, 2008

It has a pronounced spicy flavor with hints of grapes and cinnamon. Clove and ginger are also noticeable. Compared to other Hefeweizens it is a little heavier with a thick mouthfeel and a sharper hop flavor. Fantastic layered taste with a spicy kick that stands out above the fruit notes. Interesting, delicious example of a well made Hefeweizen. 482 charactersjenbys2001, Jan 20, 2008

A: Pours a hazy golden yellow orange with a two inch creamy white and loosely packed head little bits of carbonation holding up the head. Little bit of lacing but not really expecting that much.
S: Sweet clean and creamy orange and lemon peel with sweet clove and wheat. Bit of vanilla in there, just warm and clean and fantastic. Smells so fresh and clean.
T/MF: Smooth and creamy mouthfeel backed by a good deal of prickly carbonation. Again there is a beautiful interplay between orange, clove and yeasty funk, very very fruity but balanced out by a taste of wheat and cream, pretty long finish that leaves a taste of mellow cinnamon on the tongue.
D: Really a great and clean drinking beer, no matter what time of year, be it the middle of summer of 10 below (which it is now) this a a beer that should be handily enjoyed. A real world class and mellow beer. Fantastic. 951 charactersbluemoonswoon, Jan 20, 2008

A - Pours a true to color golden look with a strong haze from the unfiltered nature of the beer. Light carbonation is apparent which results in a very light film of and light hazing.
S - A bready and spicy yeast backbone is the strongest smell here. Very true to the hefe style where yeast owns.
T - Starts with a muted malt backbone with just enough bitterness to bring it into balance. Mid stream is not all that potent of a flavor, I am surprised at the smoothness of the overall flavor profile of the beer. A sweet and spicy finish to the beer. Very refreshing.
M - Strong carbonation makes this beer just explode in your mouth. Beyond that, it is very full bodied which is right in line for my desire in a hefe.
D - Very easy drinking and refreshing. Light ABV makes it sessionable. Now I may be colored by the fact that I just returned from a 25 mile bike ride, but I can think of no more refreshing summer beer. The only knock here is that perhaps the sweetness would begin to wear on me. 1,159 characterskatan, Jan 11, 2008

S: Clean, crisp, and fresh. Cloves, banana, almost a bit of a floral arrangement going on. That lightest hints of citrus, a bit more on the orange side. Beautiful.
T: The banana flavour stands out for me often with this hefe, in a way I haven't found from others yet. Sweet, but not overboard. Hints of bubblegum, a little bitterness of hops, and lemon peel citrus. 
M: I love the way this drink feels. Not overly carbonated at all, somewhat dry, very refreshing

Smell is a bit of spicy clove and banana with hints of lemon. Taste is sweetness from the wheat and banana from the yeast, with a lemon edge to it. Very nice.

A very good weissbier, perhaps one that defines the style well, but I don't find anything spectacular about this beer. I have tasted all the flavors in this beer in other weizens. Perhaps the best attribute of this beer is the liveliness of the wheat taste, but many other weizens are equally lively while also providing greater complexity. 507 charactersCadyfatcat, Dec 12, 2007

A gentle pour yielded two fingers of creamy off-white head which reduced slowly to a thin layer. The body is a highly cloudy orange/dark yellow that almost seems to be glowing.
Smell - 4.5
Extremely spicy while the head is settling, then weakens leaving a smooth, soft, semi-sweet aroma of clove, lemon, mixed spices, slight banana.
Taste - 4.5
Now this is an easy drinker! Starts with sweet wheat malt, nutmeg, clove and a hint of lemon and bubblegum. Finishes with a light, crisp bitterness, and quite dry. Aftertaste is soft, sweet (but not over-sweet), nutty and slightly alcoholic and leaves the mouth feeling refreshed. Delicious!
Mouthfeel - 4.5
Oh so silky smooth. There is a persistent fine carbonation that gives the beer an almost creamy mouthfeel. Moderate weight in the mouth.
Drinkability - 5.0
Argueably the best session beer in the world.
OVERALL
I wanted to review a great beer for my 100th review, and this is certainly a great beer. It is the best beer available in the town of Manjimup, and therefore the best beer available to me. I would love to have been able to review it on-tap (it is supposedly even better!). As it is, this is probably the best beer from one of the world's best breweries. At $6.99 it is too expensive here, but still stands as decent value thanks to the fine quality. It can be found as cheaply as $4.25 in the city, which I think is really a steal. If you are trying to turn someone onto craft beer, forget the Trappist stuff, give them this German beauty. 1,524 charactersLittleCreature, Dec 06, 2007

2.58/5  rDev -41.4%look: 5 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5Had this beer on drought at the Tap Room in NYC and the Brewery in Friesing.
Served in a tall hefe glass.
Just looks like the prototype hefeweizen. Straw, cloudy color. Nice head that dissipates after a minute or so. 
Lemon scent with a hint of canned corn smell.
The taste is not as good as I think that it was going to be. Strong canned corn taste. Everyone makes so much out of this beer but I have to say I am quite disappointed. 
With so many good reviews for this beer I have my suspicions about the place I got the beer. 
I had two of these and both tasted off. Sorry to disagree with the others. All I have to say is that if you are interested in this beer, don't try it at the Tap Room in NYC.
I had this at the brewery in Friesing and it tasted the same. 771 charactersjneiswender, Nov 25, 2007

A: Wonderful cloudy appearance. Massive amounts of head on this beer.
S: Big yeast scent up front.Bannanna which weirds me about because I hate them but love Hefs.
T: Bannana and clover are here as expected. Almost a vanilla hint at the end. Wheat fills in the middle nicely.
M: Great. Carbonation is perfect and it loves being on my tounge.
D: This one is dangerous. An awesome session beer for the summer. 469 charactersaerozeppl, Nov 24, 2007

Big melon, banana in the nose with a minor clove afterthought. Tastes all compliment eachother well. Everything in the nose dances on the palate. Medium and crisp in the mouth. So drinkable its not funny. 270 charactersfranksnbeans, Nov 20, 2007
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Light golden cloudy body. Large white head of full range of bubbles, good retention and lace.
Sweet malty scent with some spiced honey. Pumpkin, hay and wheat are present as well.
Fruity malt flavor with plenty of spice. Vanilla pudding like notes along with pumpkin. The aftertaste reveals abit of hops again with a spiced character but it does not last long.
Medium body, somewhat wheaty and dry. Residual sugars are present.
Pretty good drinkability. Mild and easy to enjoy, this would make a good session beer.

4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Straight up - this is an outstanding brew... Compared to some other bland styles out there, this is simply outstanding... A great appearance with a nice frothy head coupled with a terrific taste makes this a classic hefe weizen. Without a doubt, one of the best I've ever sampled, this blows the competition away with its strong, pronounced wheat/citrus flavor that is complex and unforgettable. The first time I've tried this, and I will definitely get another sixer... Certainly go for this one even if you're not a fan of the style - you won't be dissapointed. 563 charactersdsa7783, Nov 16, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My 500ml bottle was best before 22nd May 2008, I drank it on a wet and cold November night in 2007.
Poured into one of my Franziskaner Weissbier glasses (wetted before the pour).
Looks great, orangey coloured cloudy body, huge head, bubbles arising, just like a good hefeweiss should.
The aroma is also huge, vanilla, bananas and toffee apples, very impressive.
The taste is full of different flavours all trying to get out, with the same three as the smell winning the battle. Vanilla ice cream and Banoffi pie but without the sweetness the idea suggests.
The mouthfeel is full and lingers, this is a well crafted beer.
I think I have reviewed over 20 weissbiers on this site so far and this is by far the best ( I have also drank many, many others before joining, the statement stays the same). A truely good beer. 822 charactersBlackHaddock, Nov 13, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5a: Pours a clear yellowish gold with a large white head, no lacing. 
s: The smell is sweet banana bread and a touch of clove. 
t: Banana is noticeable, but not as strong as it was in the nose. Wheat and lemon balance out this hefe. The taste is a good balance and makes for an easy drinking, very refreshing beer that's perfect for summer.
m: Good carbonation, smooth, and light.
d: This is not my favorite beer and I am not a huge fan of Hefeweizens, but for me this is THE hefeweizen by which all others are judged. The perfect example of the style. 555 charactersBradLikesBrew, Nov 08, 2007
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A: Golden to an autumn orange color with a fluffy white head that mingles leaving luxurious thick lacing on a wheat glass.
S: Bread-like, the yeast and wheat show through and play with hints of banana and clove. I get this weird sensation of peanut butter when the lot mix, could be just me. 
T: Sweet wheat and light touches of banana, much less than in Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weiss. Very slight bitter, only apparent in the aftertaste. I love this style. Nothing extreme, very smooth and full of flavor.
M: Full bodied, with an agreeable amount of carbonation. The bottle was a little over chilled at first, but the flavors and the feel got so much better as it warmed slightly.
D: So smooth and full of flavor, very appropriate for the fall. One of the best hefeweizens I've had to date. Very drinkable anytime. 818 charactersJArami, Nov 07, 2007
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours up golden with amber highlights. Thick, creamy white head dissipates slowly. Bubbles of CO2 stream up like a reverse rainstorm. Mostly clear with a bit of haze.
S - First smell is banana smell combined with sweet malt. 
T - Starts off slightly sweet, fades to the banana like flavor, which is replaced with a tingle of CO2 on the tongue.
M - Carbonation makes this feel full bodied. 
D - While sweet, not cloying Two or three of these sound like a nice idea, thanks.
Overall, whenever I think of a hefeweiss, I think of this type of beer. 553 charactershiikeeba, Nov 03, 2007

Poured a hazy, slightly orangish yellow color with a huge, white, frothy head. Soft wheat aroma with yeast and cloves, maybe some bubble gum. Tart, almost lemony-smelling. Light-to-medium body. Taste was very much like the smell. Definitely a weizen but a little more subdued and less yeasty than many. Good mouthfeel though less creamy than expected. The drinkability, however, is among the all-time greats.
One of the better versions of the style, and the benchmark I compare others against. When I think hefeweizens, this is what comes to mind even though the style is not amongst my favorites. 644 charactersshererjt, Nov 02, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cloudy straw head with plenty of yeast floating. Excellent hefe head.
Smells of citruis fruits, banana, clove, and wheat. True to style.
Taste is a good wheat base that is enhanced by what seems to be a perfect balance of clove on the sides of the palate and banana toward the front with a nice touch of citrius.
Feels clean, good carbonation, great aftertaste. Not too light, not too heavy.
This is the benchmark hefe that all others should be compared too. Other hefes have better individual qualities, but this is the best overall that I have had. 550 charactersHomerbag, Nov 01, 2007

A cloudy orange with large sticky head that leaves nice lacing throughout. The glass and beer look great.
Aroma is somewhat spicy with fruits and yeast and some nice wheat malt
Crisp, sweet, taste with fruity (banana) and yeast flavors. Nice level of carbonation. Refreshing and highly drinkable. Might be my favorite hefe weizen 441 charactersshaebs99, Oct 25, 2007

Taste is great, banana definitely present along with malt, slight hop comes with.
Just about the right carbonation, flavor attacks the tongue.
I wouldn't mind drinking another 5 of these, es ist ein guter hefe! 299 charactersStagi, Oct 23, 2007

This is a good summer sipper. 303 charactersdrseamus, Oct 23, 2007
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5My new favorite Hefeweizen.
Pours a murky golden amber, more honey than beer. Incredible wheat/citrus flavor, hints of lemon, and even some more tropical overtones such as banana. Very drinkable, wonderful level of carbonation and mouthfeel.
Unlike most mass produced hefeweizens, this one really offers a complex, robust series of flavors. 342 charactersOverlord, Oct 21, 2007
4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Definitely the best hefeweissen I have had so far. It looks more like honey than beer, being a rich, almost opaque, slightly orange golden color. Aroma is strong and wheaty, with a strong citrus overtone - but the latter may have come from the obligatory lemon wedge. Flavor is rich, typical of a wheat beer but mouth-filling - no "thin" feeling whatsoever. I got a strong hint of citrus, but again this may have been due to the lemon wedge in the beer. Light, smooth and tingly, this beer is a winner. No wonder they have been in business for almost a millennium! 564 charactersCyberkedi, Oct 21, 2007
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier lives up to its reputation as one of the best beers in the world, not just the best hefe. Anyhow this presents itself with a picture perfect three inch bright white head, with a golden orange body, which is hazier than most other hefes.
The aromas I detect are white pepper, a slight perfume aroma, and a kind of cedar smoke fragrance.
This tastes more like blood orange and honey, with a little hint of banana. There is a little peppery taste here too.
By far this is the standard of hefe weizens. This is a true pleasure to enjoy. 565 charactersTheSarge, Oct 20, 2007

Smell is initially wheaty, and banana phenol comes out on the nose.
Taste is balanced between malt and banana. Hop bitterness is faint. Some undertones of clove come out. German malt sweetness is upfront balanced by clove and banana. 
Nicely carbonated, turns creamy on the palate. 
This beer is very refreshing. A great hefeweizen 407 charactersjasonjlewis, Oct 19, 2007
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A- Pours a hazy light copper. It is almost like a mixture of the colors of falls leaves. A very impressive head that domes up a half an inch over the edge of the glass. This head stays all the way down with really good lacing.
S-Yeasty, Bananas, and wheat.Light clove phenols and some over ripe papaya.
T-The most balance hefe I have ever had. Substantial levels of banana and clove, wtih just enough bubblegum. Wheat finishes out nicely with some nice yeast.
M- Very light and spritzy. Nice and dry and refreshing.
D- Really refreshing and delicious. Whe nI get that late night hefe craving I know where to look. I think I'll have another. 644 charactersviperpiper522, Oct 19, 2007
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a deep straw color with a good ammount of carbonation and almsot no head.
The aroma was complex and got moreso as it warmed; citrus, dough and clove. 
The taste was first dominated by citrus, then mild apple and spice as it gets warmer; reminded me of an almost cider-taste. Finally subtle vanilla and alchol finish out the taste.
The semi-sweet start fades into a slightly bitter/sour feel due to the carbonation, but was still pleasant. It unfortuantely didn't leave as long an aftertase as I had hoped.
This is truly a great Hefe, refreshing and well-balanced. 570 characterssinistrsam, Oct 18, 2007

Smells yeasty, like a hefe/weiss should. There's also some hints of citrus and estery fruitiness as well. The taste is very sweet and yeasty, also with some citrus and passionfruit flavors there in the background. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is very heavy and creamy, slight tingling from the carbonation. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, especially if you like weissbiers. 500 charactersKulrak, Oct 16, 2007

A - Cloudy golden yellow colour poured into a Weizen glass with an inch and a half or so of fluffy white head.
S - Banana, wheat and light spice touches.
T - Like the smell, the taste has banana, wheat and light spices. They are more predominant here but nothing overrides the others.
M - Fairly light bodied like most weizens with a nice, crisp carbonation.
D - Bring it on. A classic that I'll drink time and time again. 502 charactersbrendan13, Oct 16, 2007

4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Translucent bright yellow body that even a gentle pour produces a unmeasurable overzealous fluffy white head. Head slowly fades to 1 finger with perfect retention. Cloudiness is thick and barely lets light pass through it. Beautiful unfiltered Hefe Weizen. 
S- Good, Light, and typical for a hefe. Great balance of sweet bready yeast, clove, and banana. Hints of citrus also emerge.
T-Very similar to the smell. Perfect balance of sweet bready yeast, clove, and banana. Hints of floral hop and citrus emerge for the finish-but are very faint. Sweet bready yeast and some clove linger long after the sip. Taste is very light.
M- Wonderful light, smooth, and creamy body based on yeast. Light carbonation accompanies this. 
D- This is a classic example of a hefe. It has everything that should be found in one and keeps it all in balance without anything extra added. Has the high drinkability and enjoyability that one should have. It was a bit on the expensive side for the bottle. I can see myself having more affordable great German hefes like Hacker-Pschorr and Franziskaner more often but I will treat myself to this one again. 1,138 charactersPittBeerGirl, Oct 06, 2007

I smell a kind of spice reminicent of pumkin pie as well as possibly a hint of banana. I know there's no bananas or pumpkins in the ingredients but somehow these wheat beers tend to get that type of smell. Very slight earthy aroma, too. It tastes quite like how it smells but better... and with no unpleasant aftertaste. Perfect carbonation. Easy to drink. God damn... I wish I was in Munich right now crushing mugs and mugs and mugs of this type of beer. This is in the top three wheats I've ever had. Very good beer. 583 charactersberserker256, Oct 05, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512oz bottle poured into a large snifter
Appearance: Translucent and golden in color. Very tall 3" head that is slightly off white in color. Tiny bubbles fill the glass to the brim and deliver a very cakey head.
Smell: Alcohol, banana and clove. Overripe apples and lemony esters. Citrus peel is in the background. This is the standard for this style. Rock solid and a job well done.
Taste: Malty and crisp with flavor. Banana and clove are right there in the forefront. Cherry-like sweet/tartness that is underlying. The sugar content is perfect. Awesome beer.
Mouthfeel: Again, perfect sugar and enough carbonation to make this the perfect summer sipper. A tingle of carbonation hits you and then the well balanced body comes forth. Alcohol is present.
Drinkability: Perfect here. This beer begs to be consumed en masse. Easy drinking, quenching and balanced. This is everything that Budweiser promises with it's beers and cannot come close to achieving. The quintessential Hefe is Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier. 1,018 charactersRisser09, Sep 30, 2007

Taste is excellent as well, same tastes as the aroma, very crisp and very balanced....the astringency is just right. Mouthfeel is rich enough for the style and drinkability is great. This is a summer beer that could be savored for a long time. I would love to try his on tap. 585 charactersJayQue, Sep 30, 2007
1.76/5  rDev -60%look: 5 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 2 |  overall: 1.5I had heard so much about Weihenstephaner that I bought the only style available that I could find in my area and that was the Hefe Weissbier kind. It was a mistake on my part as apparently I do not like this beer.
Poured the beer had a lovely gold color and the head was huge so I was looking forward to drinking this beer. Honestly, the appearance is amazing.
Then I smelled the beer and it actually turned my stomach. I'll give it another chance someday but perhaps I may just have gotten a bad bottle. It has an aroma similar to a overhopped gin bouquet.
Taste has a wheat-orangish lemonish flavor to it. The wheat is overpowering and I definitely didn't enjoy tasting it as I wasn't able to taste very much of the subtler undertones.
The mouthfeel was pretty smooth but the taste and smell both overpowered the mouthfeel so that's why I rated it so low on the mouthfeel as well.
Overall, it was pretty hard for me to drink this beer and I ended up having to pour it down the drain. Such a waste of a beer that's probably exceptional for everybody else. 1,062 charactersxare, Sep 26, 2007

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance:
The beer pours a hazy golden straw color with an ample sticky white head. The retention is superb as is the lacing.
Smell:
There's a rich aroma of banana and cloves from the yeast and just the right touch of tartness from the wheat.
Taste and Mouthfeel:
The beer drinks smooth and full and is completely rife with an amalgamation of flavors that is best described as banana nut bread. Up front you get the sweet ripe banana notes which then meld in to more of a yeasty bread character and is then finally smoothed out in to a crisp cashew finish. Absolutely delicious.
Drinkability:
It's too tasty to be anything but highly drinkable. It's really one of the most perfect drinking beers in existence in my opinion.
Bottom Line:
I guess you learn a few tricks when you've been brewing the same beer for 500 years because this beer really is perfection when you get a nice fresh bottle of it like the one I reviewed today. 935 charactersGrundle20, Sep 23, 2007
3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5500ml bottle into a weizen glass. Huge 4" white meringue-like head slowly recedes in a rocky mound leaving thick bars of foam on the glass. Beer is a slightly hazed gold which turns to a cloudy cantaloupe gold after the yeast is added. A neverending stream of bubbles shoots from the bottom of the glass.
Aroma is fruity and phenolic with pears, banana, nutmeg, clove, and mango.
Flavor is spicy and tingly up front. More clove and nutmeg with the fruit a little more subdued. Fresh white bread. Tart lemony finish with drying carbonation.
Somewhat slick medium body with high carbonation. An excellent refresher full of lively complex flavors. 647 charactersskizziks, Sep 23, 2007
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a cloudy murky yellow brown color with a booming head. The head dies down to a manageable level but is continually fed by stream after stream of bubbles.
S: Tons of aromas in this one. Banana, Clove, Lemon, and Bubble Gum. The aroma lets you know this is a wheat beer and a good one at that.
T: Big bold flavors for a wheat brew. It has all that you would expect in there just more of it. Lemon, over ripe banana, and clove dominate. The yeastiness is there giving it an almost sour dough type quality.
M: Light and sparkling like a good wheat beer should be.
D: Uber drinkable.
Overall: I have had this one more times than I can count on my fingers and toes. It is a great example of a Hefe that most brewers emulate their offerings after. The flavor is off the scale for a wheat beer and the drinkablility is wonderful. It is a wonderful brew that is worthy of its top 100 status. 896 characterstpd975, Sep 18, 2007

Smell: Crisp pears and a sweet grassy note. 
Taste: Light fruits with a very wheaty, dry finish that lingers in the mouth for a long time. A finely balanced beer that matches tart sweetness and an incredible smoothness that satisfies every time. 454 charactersBucBasil, Sep 13, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5To me, probably the single greatest Wheat Beer on the planet. You'd expect the traditional banana, clove, yeast and spice...but you also get the most awesome vanilla undertone from the wheat malt, coupled with the right amount of tartness and acidity from the fermentation.
This beer is so refreshing and smooth, it might be the ultimate summer beer for me. Summer? Nah. It's September 12, and it might be the most divine beer I could have selected today. Bravo, Holy Stephen. 477 charactersSixpoint, Sep 12, 2007

S: Perfect hefe aroma. Bready malt with nice banana/citrusy lemon aroma. Strong clove character as well. 
T: Again, classic hefe flavor. Great mix of banana and clove flavors underscored by a very sweet malt flavor that finishes sweet. 
MF: Medium body. Fluffy and creamy. Low carbonation.

A- It poured a hazy orange/amber color with a 2 finger off-white head. It had a medium high carbonation and left good lacing.
S- The aroma was ripe bananas and spice.
T- It had the classic banana flavor and lots of citrus. There was some clove flavor in the background.
M- It was a little on the fizzy side and had some bite from the lemon flavor, otherwise it was pretty smooth.
D- It was an easy sipping warm weather beer.
Overall- This is a really good representation of the style. Personally, I prefer a little more banana and a little less citrus than this beer offers, but I'm sure I'll keep it in my rotation of "go to" hefes. 674 charactersGRPunk, Sep 09, 2007
4.06/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I've never seen a head like this! Huge, cloud-like foam that keeps billowing out of the glass and never falls. It looks like snowy hills. It's beautiful. Enough with the head, the body is a nice gradient from yellow at the bottom to a dark orange at the top. Kind of hazy, occasional carbonation bubbles rise up and add to the head.
Not much in the aroma, banana, cloves, coriander, maybe a little vanilla.
The flavor is much the same, banana, cloves, coriander, hint of vanilla, but also citrus hops.
Medium bodied, slight bite, but very tasty and refreshing. However, this is not something I'd drink frequently. 616 charactersdogger6253, Sep 08, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A warm summer's day I saw this one at Holiday Market for a mere $3, and figured I couldn't lose. Turns out it's one of the best summer brews I've ever tried. It pours a light orange color with two fingers of white, fluffy head on top. Nose is strong on citrus, wheat, corriander. Taste up front is light graininess, lots of spices, orange, tons of wheat. Great light hoppiness at the back, with the sweet wheat. Full body, creamy, nice fizzy feel on the fairly strong carbonation. I just loved this one. Perfect carbonation adds to the flavor, giving it a nice crispness. A perfect summer beer, with lots of wheaty and orangy goodness. 635 characterssoupyman10, Sep 04, 2007
4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours dark murky gold with a nice head which leaves good lacing. Aroma is all wheat- spicy cloves and banana. Taste is spicy wheat with lingering banana flavor. Just a bit sweet and bitter in the finish. Balanced. Pretty much the definition of what a hefe should taste like. Smooth and medium bodied. Extremely drinkable. Excellent stuff. 338 charactersburnstar, Sep 04, 2007
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance - A cloudy, pale brown with a rich, sizable, pure white head that persisted right to the bottom of the glass.
Aroma - A powerful aroma of fresh, clean banana and floral, grassy notes. Typical of a wheat beer, but still wonderfully refreshing.
Taste - An immediate wash of fresh spicy banana and yeast. The finish was strong but mellow and soft with a classic wheat aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - Very light. Despite the naturally high level of carbonation, the beer is not at all aggressive in the mouth.
Drinkability - Personally, Im not a person who can knock back more than 1 or 2 wheat beers in a session, but Im tempted to try with this one! Excellent, well rounded Hefe weizen. 691 charactersDaveUK, Sep 03, 2007

This one was a little overrated in my book
It is just a typical German Hefeweizen in my book
It has a subtle, light taste and tastes great with an orange or lemon

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Peachy orange in color with a massively fluffy, pillowy off white head.
S- Smells sweet and spicy with hints of banana, orange and citrusy fruits.
T- Very light on the palate but beautifully well balanced. A touch of sweet banana bread and other subdued fruit flavors. I like that the fruits are not overpowering in this beer, yet complement each other perfectly.
M- Mouth feel is very carbonated and light. I sometimes find certain hefeweizens leave a sticky undesirable coating in my mouth and are just too sweet which was not at all the case with this brew. Very refreshing.
D- One of the best wheat beers I have tried so far, intoxicatingly drinkable and very light. 677 charactersLothore, Sep 03, 2007
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on tap at the Rathskeller in Indianapolis. 
A: Poured a beautiful hazy golden hue
S: Sweet banana and yeast 
T: Perfect for outdoor drinking malty and sweet with a back finish of hops and slight banana flavoring. 
M: Again, perfect on a late summer night. Low carbonation, sweetness and smooth and not heavy. 
D: I would drink this everytime I get a chance. Wonderful showcase of a Hefe the way it should be made. 
I had two last night, one with lemon on my glass and the other without. I preferred to not have the lemon, but every bar seems to like to add one to anything with Hefe in the name. 604 charactersTheodorHerzl, Sep 02, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a weizen glass. 
A: The beer is a light amber color with a large white head that fades at a decent rate and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is full of wheat and banana, along with spice, light malts and some hops.
T: The taste is sweet and bready with strong flavors of wheat, banana & spices. Its simple and straight-forward, but done very well. The malt character is light but hearty and theres a mild hops presence. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, very clean finish.
D: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not very filling, decent kick, excellent representation of style, this beer has everything that you look for in a Hefe Weizen and it doesnt need anything above that. I could drink this beer all night long and enjoy every bit of it. 879 charactersTheManiacalOne, Sep 02, 2007

Poured a hazy golden yellow colour... White head poured typically big thick and foamy then faded slowly to nice thick layer ... lots of carbonation rises to the surface... decent amount of thick sticky lacing...
Aroma - Good clove spiciness, light vanilla notes, noticeable wheat, quite bready, very little malts, light fruitiness (banana, lemons and some light lime), quite peppery, faint ginger spiciness, some hay traces...
Taste  Light biscuity malts, faint bubblegum traces mixed with clove, definite breadiness, good fruitiness (lemon, grapefruit and some faint pear notes), salty traces, some floral honey sweetness, grassy and peppery hints, no real hops....
Feel - Fairly smooth with a little bite underneath... light body... Extremely refreshing and drinkable...
Overall - A top notch German hefe - one of the best out there in my opinion.. 891 charactersmdagnew, Aug 29, 2007

S- Sweet banana and clove with some wheat smell. Not too strong, but very appealing. 
T- Awesome. Same as the aroma. A little bit spicy and bready as well. Impressive and well done. 
M- Just about right. A bit creamy and smooth. Goes down very well. Not cloying or drying by any means. Very well balanced. 
D- A very enjoyable beer. This would make a great session beer. I was really impressed with how smooth and flavorful this was. 556 charactersgordavidson, Aug 28, 2007

The aroma is fresh and remind of malt, clove slight banana, and some citrus scents. The taste is very smooth, citrus comes to mind very quickly, lemon I suppose. Some strong banana flavors present as well as well as clove. Very refreshing flavor which goes great during the warmer weather. Overall possibly my favorite hefe that I have had to date. 504 charactersStimack, Aug 26, 2007

A - Served in pint glass. Very cloudy and straw blonde with fluffy head that fell back slowly with sticky lacing
S - Had the notable hefe hallmark bannana smell to it with just a touch of the hops and a little clove smell (not very much)
T/M - The taste was just wonderful as it cut the spice of the food with a sweetness from the beer and the mouthfeel with it's creamy presence helped to balance out the burn on the tounge from the hot chicken 
D - This was a very drinkable beer..I could see spending several pints getting to know it very well..and like I said it goes well with spicy chineese food 775 charactersmeechum, Aug 25, 2007

T - Banana, clove, spicy pepper, hint of lemon and a bready (maybe tart) wheat taste. Slight sweetness upfront with a dry finish.
M - Light and refreshing with a dry finish leaving me wanting another sip.
D - An excellent beer that is mighty tasty on a hot humid day. 475 charactersbrewcrew76, Aug 24, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The overall impression of this beer is that it is what all hefe-weizen should be compared to. That said the balance with malts and the aroma and bitterness leaves you refreshed and wanting more of it. 
The appearance is a slightly golden yellow, with a great head that stands at least 2 fingers deep and leaves a fine lace that clings to the sides of the glass.
The smell reminds me of a bannanas and spice. The aroma has a slight citris sent in the background.
The taste is what gets you. Bannana and clove, with a little mellow citrus. It keeps unfolding as you drink more. the balance of sweetness and bittnerness with the clove and citrus leave you asking what is the third and maybe fourth flavor that plays a role in the complexity. I don't know, but I'll keep drinking till I get it.
The mouthfeel is what I love about his beer. It is not the lightest that I have had, but still a refreshing coating that it leaves. It is over all a light-medium mouthfeel in my book, 
The drinkablility is what the previous has said. One of the most drinkable beers out there. It is complex, refreshing, and light enough to go with many foods and hold up on it's own as a session beer (though it would be a pricy session). Drink more of it and you will not regret it. 1,273 charactersKevPet84, Aug 23, 2007
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cloudy body was a combination of yellow and orange colors. Pillow like pure white head was three inches and took a few minutes to settle. In the light loads of carbonation can be seen. Sticky thick lace rings. 
Very sweet light banana aroma. Quickly overtaking the nose, the cloves popped strongly. There is a very faint bubble gum sugary powder aroma. Light astringent scent in the finish.
Sweet malty taste up front brings bananas, lemons, and a light grape flavor as the fruit blend. A very subdued clove note is hidden in the back of the flavor. Hops are extremely gentle at the very end of each sip.
Thick enough to fill the mouth, but consistency helps this one go down smooth. Nice carbonation push on the front of the tongue.
An excellent beer. Pair this with a nice piece of smoked salmon. As evidenced by how long they have been at it, this is a wonderful choice for anyone who likes beer. Hope they keep this up for another nine hundred and sixty-seven years. 982 charactersRedChrome, Aug 17, 2007

The head is white like a cloud that billows up to the top of the glass if you are not too careful. Smell is cloves, spices, coriander, banana, orange peel, very vast in aroma. Taste is a very light and refresing with the spices and banana. Wheat like flavors dance around too. Mouthfeel is crisp, and refreshing. Only recently have I begun to appreciate wheat beers. This is a great one. 491 charactersgenog, Aug 16, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 500 mL capped bottle.
A: The weizen exploded with carbonation, creating a three plus finger head in the glass and two overflows in the bottle. The thick bubbles slowly recede, providing a bitter buffer between my mouth and the beer. The ale itself is a slightly hazy yellow color, a goldenrod shade.
S: The nose is intoxicating, with light clove and banana notes, hints of (but not too much) bubblegum sweetness and even some caramel. 
T: The esters have receded from the forefront of the taste, allowing an unusual grain bill to emerge. The wheat provides a drier body without the tartness that it is known to bring. The longer that the ale sits in the mouth, the more the flavor takes on a sweet, Belgian-esque candi sugar sweetness (please note that I would never, EVER suggest that the beer has any cand sugars in it). It tastes as if the esters have pushed past bubblegum, clove and banana to a new caramel sweet realm. Intrguing to say the least.
M: The mouthfeel is drier with some month under its belt, creating a sweet flavor that leaves the tastebuds begging for more.
D: New or old, this is a great beer. Some aging (just a few months, mind you) have given the beer a greater depth at the sacrifice of the traditional weizen characteristics. I like this, but it is far superior fresh. 1,302 charactersakorsak, Aug 12, 2007
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Recently bought this at AJ's here in Phoenix but also had it last year at Weihenstephan on tap. One of the top 5 breweries on the planet and and simply put, a top 2 hefewiesse (along with Schneiderweisse).
The aroma is beautifully dominated with cloves with hints of other spices dancing through you nose hairs. I tend to sniff it for a good 4-5 minutes to let it warm slightly before drinking it down.
A nice white head on top of straw/light brown body that is a bit murky because they leave all the good flavorable shit in the beer.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with multiple flavors cascading around your tongue.
The taste is true hefeweisse and should be the STANDARD. If you know little about this style and are looking for the beer by which all others can be compared, this is the one. Ungespundet will be brewing their soon, so if the quality falters, you will know who to e-mail.

T: Bubblegum and banana abound, very estery, cloves back the flavor at the end of a drink, a classic weizen taste.

A - I chose to discard the lemon and get the full effect of the beer on it's own. A cloudy apricot colored ale with a fluffy white head that creates plenty of lace.
S - Wondrous scents of banana and clove w/ light pepper and gentle scent of wheat.
M - Effervescent lively mouthfeel. Light and easy drinking wheat creamy feel. Nutty and slight spice in the semi-dry finish.
T - A well made Hefe, I must say right from the start. Great flavors of wheat and yeast up-front. Citrus and pepper flavors are swirled in with the yeast taste. A nice mildly sweet and creamy wheat flavor gets all wrapped up with Bavarian yeast flavor. Nice tropical fruit and citrus accents until the light pepper floats over the tongue in the finish.
D - The drinkability is stellar and so much flavor in the session strength of the unfiltered wheat ale. This is perfect for the summer, but I would drink this year-round. I consider this a premier example of the style. Great quaffability. 1,031 charactersSlatetank, Aug 05, 2007
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my second review of this beer, vom fass at the Weihenstephan outlet in Berlin, at Hackesher Markt.
A: Cloudy amber colour, withlively beading and yeast sediment throughout the glass. Fantastic head, 3 fingers and sustained, lacing is also good.
S: Strong esters of banana and cloves, stereotypical of the style. Slight hints of vanila come through aswell.
T: Typical weizen taste. Strong flavours of banana, and maybe some peaches. finish is smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, not as watery as others. Slight hint of vanilla on the aftertaste. But it is so well balanced, better than the UK on tap offerings, which i felt had a very medicinal quality in the aftertaste.
M: Refreshing with moderate carbonation, smooth.Not watery and overcarbonated at all as i have found in other big name weizens
D: This is world class! The amazing fresh summery weizen flavours with a superbly comfortable refreshing carbonation and the long linger creamy afterflavours, make this the perfect hefe-weizen! 1,013 charactersseanyfo, Aug 04, 2007

S: Banana, clove, citrus - basically everything a wheat beer should smell like. Very nice.
T: Heavy citrus up front followed by some banana and clove with a finish that is crisp and on point with a touch of sour apple.
M: A little thin - maybe a little more carbonation? Not bad, though.

Head rises over the rim a mighty 3 inches tall in total and slowly slinks back down. A cold sweat envelopes the glass as it sits for a few minutes on the counter.
Aromas are slightly sweet with wafts of banana, citrus, and mild bublegum. Taste follows that up tenfold as it livens up my tongue. A little bit of fizz and spice and rivers of citrusy sweet wheat roll over my tongu ushering in hints of clove and spice. 
Well this one is undoubtedly the best thing to come home to, next to the kids hanging on my legs. Crisp an drefreshing and a few make a wonderful meal. Almost a perfect 5. 666 charactersgpcollen1, Jul 19, 2007
4.74/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a weitzen glass, the appearance is your typical hefe... straw colored, prototypically cloudy with a nice three to four-finger head. I do miss the chunks of yeast which float about in my usual Franziskaner however.
Smell is primo, with the phenols and esthers combining into a near perfect harmony of "citrus"y flavors. After 20+ years of drinking this style I still don't get the bananna though.
Taste is excellent, and the thing that makes this hefe-weizen exceptional is the perfect balance of flavors. No one flavor overpowers the others, and the finish is dry and bright, making you want "just one more".
Mouthfeel is typical of the style... perfectly carbonated.
Drinkability is off the charts... there's just no beer (IMO) that goes down as easy as a hefeweizen, and everything that makes a hefe so great is evident in this beer, but in spades.
Even I was hooked by the mystique of this beer being supposedly the best of it's kind, so I was expecting more. (Especially since it's twice as expensive as my usual German hefe) However, it's definately the best I've had, although not twice as good as my other favorite German hefe. The almost perfect balance of flavors is what distinguishes this beer. 1,232 characterswhiplash3825, Jul 17, 2007

$2.99 
Binny's Orland Park
Hefes aren't my favorite style but I've been in the mood for one today and what better way to go than Weihenstephaner? Pours a hazy yeast laden golden. The entire glass fills with big carbonation bubbles that speed to the creamy bright white head that forms on the pour. Leaves moderate lacing after each sip. A very nice looking hefe.
The smell is 100% hefe. The benchmark for others. Green bananas have a big spot in the aroma with clove coming in a close second, very spicy. Possibly some white pepper. Solid wheat twang backbone with a drop or two of lemon juice. Smells great. 
Flavor is spot on with the aroma. The banana is leaning more toward banana bread as opposed to green bananas. Clove with a twangy wheat backdrop and the lemon shows again.. 
Lighter bodied with a highly carbonated creamy mouthfeel. Very thirst quenching.
On a warm summer day like today this is about one of the easiest drinkers to find. Thirst quenching and enjoyable.
To me Weihenstephaner is the pinnacle all other hefes try and reach. Like I said not one of my favorite styles but when I'm in the mood none are better than this. 1,174 charactersjoe1510, Jul 16, 2007
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Quite opaque and dark for a wheat beer. An amber-brown colour. Fairly thick head which slowly faded.
Smell - Surprisingly strong, with some fruitiness detectable.
Taste - A fantastic balance of spice and fruit, particularly banana flavours. Amazing complexity for a wheat beer.
Mouthfeel - Very good texture and carbonation.
Drinkability - It's very hard to imagine a beer being more drinkable than this. Who knows how many I'd stop at, but remember the bottles are almost a pint, so a six pack would get you rather drunk.
Overall - Excellent. I've never tried anything quite like this. On a list of "Beers you must try before you die", this would have to be very close to the top. 699 charactersCs1987, Jul 15, 2007
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Cloudy orange is nicely fleshed out, obviously the head is large and impressive, very dense and sticky. The aroma is sweet, reasonably powerful, and lightly spicy. I may detect some more sprightly sweetness than just the wheat, perhaps a touch of citric zest. 
Flavor is mild, creamy, delicious. Big yeast flavors with that lemon background, clove spicing is delicately managed. Crisp carbonation and just enough balancing hops keep everything in check. Finish is biscuity and maybe a little nutty. 
Body is thin, a little bit of watery character that is par for the course with a beer this fruity, flavorful, and quenching. This is the perfect example of a hefeweizen that I would return to again and again. 714 charactersBretSikkink, Jul 04, 2007
4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer poured into my glass a translucent, straw like color, with a thick Meringue like head on the top. Looks awesome!
The smell was great on this one. There are strong banana and citrus scents. It's very sweet smelling, with a very subtle smokey like hint lingering in the background. 
This had an interesting taste, not like some of the other hefe's I've had. It started off with a citrusy burn on the front of the tongue, while the back of the tongue harvest a carbonation fizzle. It had a soft banana flavor, and it was also slightly nutty. Complex, but still one coherent taste. 
This was very light, a perfect summer sipper. I could have a bunch if I had some more! Highly recommended from this BA! 717 characterspavandal, Jul 01, 2007
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5The first beer to be poured into my brand new Franziskaner weizen glass. 3 fingers of head form instantaneously and I have to be cautious with the rest of the pour to maintain that amount of suds. The white foam lays atop a gorgeous, hazy organic unfiltered apple juice-colored body. OK lacing, good retention.
The definitive weizen aroma: bananas and cloves. Very appetizing on this hot night.
This beer is extremely mellow. Every flavor blends immaculately with the next. Soft banana and clove flavors meet honey, lemongrass, very subtle hops, a faint hint of pear skin, a bubblegummy note, cereal grains. Deeper than your average hefe.
This beer has a nice crisp finish despite the cloudiness. Great balance, ample carbonation, mellow and sweet flavors, and low alcohol make for an insanely drinkable beer. Nice and refreshing. On a hot day I could easily imagine 3-4 of these disappearing. 902 charactersillidurit, Jun 30, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Nice wheat. Made the beer menu at one of my favorite restaurants. 16.9 oz bottle. Poured a nice golden, not clear, slightly cloudy. Can smell the wheat, also citrus, lemony, some sweet corn. Very pleasant. Nicely surprised by the taste. I usually find wheats too watery, or lacking overall character. This one bucked that trend. Taste came through with lemony wheat, slightly sweet, crisp and clean. No lingering aftertaste. Very drinkable, excellent accompaniment to a meal. 475 charactersbjoyce12, Jun 29, 2007
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours a deep hazy straw color with a white head that quickly reduces to a ring around the rim of the glass. Aroma is classic German hefe but heavier with rich banana esters coming immediately to the front. Hiding behind that is a slight farmhouse sourness. The mouthfeel is not as immediately heavy as the nose would lead you to believe, but it lingers on the back of your tongue like butter, maybe diacetyls. The esters dominate the taste with a citrus and spice note. Overall one of the better hefeweissbiers I have had. 522 charactersbensiff, Jun 26, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Golden color with a slight haze. An ample white head that forms upon pour. A lively carbonation keeps feeding the head that resolves after a few minutes to a half-finger remain. Note the beer's color, carbonation, head and its retention. Is it clear or cloudy? Does it look lackluster and dull or alive and inviting?
Smell - Malty sweet aroma with a bit of a grassy presence as well. A bit of a yeasty nose as well. 
Taste - For a hefe, this is one of the more dense one's I've tasted. I would almost compare this with even a Belgian strong dark ale, it's that rich of a body. Very smooth with a dry finish. Very well balanced with just a bit of a hop bite at the end. 
Mouthfeel - The lively carbonation helps move this beer around very well, making it feel alot more dense than I've come to expect from hefe's. Maybe I need to taste more hefes!!
Drinkability - This was a very nice representation of the style. The complexity is head and shoulders above many beers that dare to put a Hefeweissen label. I'll have to get more of this bad boy. 1,068 charactersNesued, Jun 26, 2007

Nose is of fresh baked bread, citrus fruit, bananas and spice. This beer smells terrific. Palate is subtly sweet in the beginning, and quite well balanced between wheat malts and hops. Refreshing fruity and spicy flavors. Mouthfeel is velvety, light and abundantly carbonated. Finish is quite dry with a slight bitterness lingering. An excellent example of the style! 436 charactersbeerphilosopher, Jun 24, 2007

Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge white fluffy head. Massive carbonation seen rising.
Aroma of bubble gum, closve, yeast and some faint farmhouse smell.
Taste is of bubblegum, clove, wheat and light banana. Tasted slightly musty.
Mouthfeel is medium/light bodied with a spritzy feel.
Overall, very drinkable. Refreshing. I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped...I am wondering if I had an old bottle--freshness dating would have helped [was stamped 2096...no idea what that meant]. 544 charactersatigerlife, Jun 23, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The ultimate weissbier comes from the oldest brewery in the world still in operation. Simply amazing, the best hefeweissbeir I have ever had.
Serving type: on tap in a weissbier glass at a beer garden in Berlin, Germany.
Appearance: glorious deep, cloudy gold, beautiful creamy head that settles down into a creamy lace.
Smell: more substantial than the typical hefeweiss, banana and almond notes.
Taste: Outstanding. Hints of almond, clove, and citrus. A smooth, clean finish. 
Mouthfeel and drinkability: Creamy and smooth, yet somehow light mouthfeel, every sip is refreshing. Absoulutely oustanding drinkability. A truly wonderful beer and an absolute must to try from the tap when in Germany. 712 characterssbe1, Jun 22, 2007

The head sticks around for a real long time. It smells like banana, cloves, lemon and wheat/yeast, very nice. Taste is pretty much the same as the smell, but with a bit of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is light/medium with good carbonation, a very clean, crisp and smooth brew. Drinkability is very good too, it's a good sessionable beer for anytime but especially refreshing on a hot day. Definitely recommended, I think it's a great beer. 529 charactersbluejacket74, Jun 22, 2007

A - Gold and slightly opaque. What is so impressive is the foam. Over an inch of foam that just stood there, and stood there...and stood there. Fantastic. Even after having a few sips there is still foam.
S - Banana, clove.
T - More banana with hint of hops
M - Just a tad over carbonated - probably what makes such great foam.
D - Very good any time of year. 432 charactersMaerzen, Jun 19, 2007
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5appearance, probably helped by pouring it into it's own glass, is quite appealing. a glowing, hazy straw/light apricot with a big, thick white head, the ridges on the inner part of the glass surely helped in this respect. fresh baked yeasty bread dominated the nose along with some lemony notes and a faint spiciness. taste is a well-balanced interplay between the lightly sweet wheat and malts and a slightly spicy crispness. hop bitterness quite muted as expected. medium bodied with a chewy mouthfeel. these classic german hefes make me want to gnash my teeth like a 13 year old on x for some reason. not that it's a bad feeling, what would i know. a very drinkable and sessionable beer for the summer. 705 charactersMrMcGibblets, Jun 18, 2007

Extraordinary taste, crisp an clean, tastes as it smells, cloves first, then banana then citrus in the finish.
Perfect carbonation and mouthfeel for the style. A great beer, and perfect paired with pizza IMO. Had this at the brewery in 1980, I wanna go back! 428 characterssrrn, Jun 18, 2007

For this one, I'm going to review it in my backyard on this warm evening. On to the beer:
I saved the Weihenstephaner glass that came along in my gift pack for this specific beer. Awesome appearance with its huge billowy head and semi-cloudy body. Smell is soft and pleasant with apricot, a touch of gum, and wheat. The yeast doesn't overpower the flavor but is rather mixed with the wheat. There's some clove, fruit, and a subtle spice. Very smooth going down, and easily quaffable. 
Wei's hefeweizen gives a nice performance to overtake for te early lead. The "Original" will be next in line here... 745 charactersDoubleJ, Jun 16, 2007
3.85/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5One of the most drinkable hefe's I've had, but not the most flavorful. It started with a sweet, spicy aroma, but taste is too mellow, not rich enough, just sweet and bready with a bit of spice. I remembered this being better on tap, so maybe that's the way to go. But for my money, the best Hefe to get is the Ayinger followed by non-skunky Franziskaner. 354 characterstempest, Jun 15, 2007

3.63/5  rDev -17.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had this in a 750 mL bottle at the Cloverleaf Tavern. Had a dark, orange-amber body with a white head. Pretty quick retention overall but it slowed to a very nice lacing that stuck with the beer. The smell was a little malty and fruitty; banana esters were fairly present. A very nice, smooth taste with banaa esters very present. A fairly fruitty taste overall that was quite refreshing. A decent, full-bodied beer; nothing too thick and quite refreshing. As a fan of Hefe Weizen's, this is one of my favorites. I could drink this all day long. The brewery has been around since 1040 and they have been following the clean brewing rule of 1532 or something to that nature, which gives it a bit of history and, to me, enhances the beer overall. Solid beer and highly recommended. 779 charactersmaddogruss, Jun 01, 2007

A - Pours a gorgeous hazy straw color with a proper 2 inch head that gets slightly rocky as it fades into memory. Head stays at about 1/4 inch with moderate lacing. 
S - Very nice banana and clove scents with clever wheat malt (of course). Tart apple and added spice give this a very pleasant nose, and for perhaps the first time I can actually pick out the bubblegum scent in a weissbier. 
T - Starts off with a nice bubblegum and banana taste that transitions to the wheat malt body of the beer. Unfortunately, things get less interesting at this point, as the body gets a little too watery for my tastes. Finish consists of a slightly bitter and tart mouthcoating effect. 
M - Moderate carbonation for the style kicks things off, with a watery and smooth middle and drying finish. 
D - Not quite the godsend that I had anticipated, but still a top-tier german hefe weizen. Will certainly revisit in the future and if I can find it I will certainly be tempted to indulge on a summer day. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in taste or effect, making this an easy drinking beer. 1,150 charactersgmcfarre, Jun 01, 2007

Head stays throughout most of the beer. Earthy wheat smell with hint of bananas/citrus though not as strong as many other hefe's. Taste is great, light carbonation leads to a slightly creamy feel (slightly being the key word). Light to medium mouthfeel leaves you wanting another taste. Goes down easily. Although this is not my favorite hefe, this is a great beer and one of my top 3-4 hefe's. 509 charactersbunnyhustle, May 31, 2007

drink and be merry
This is some good hefe weisse beer. I don't know if I prefer it to Ayinger which has a banana smell/taste that I find superior to Weihenstephaner. Nevertheless, I think this one has a lighter body with a more wheaty taste, making it a solid deutsch beer in its own right. Deutschland Uber Alles! 362 charactersphilberinghele, May 31, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier has the colour of grapefruit skin and a beaming, summery complexion. Its golden radiance is etched over with a natural haze that results from the high protein content of wheat and leaving the beer unfiltered; curiously, it hardly obstructs visibility and its shine is unceasing. Bubbles are constantly in motion. Its head is feathery and fluffy and its lacing gooey and gunky. 
The aroma is ambrosial and appetizing, a well-spiced yeasty concoction that is jammed packed to the brim with clove-like phenols and fruity esters. It has a light airiness to it, gently titillating the senses while savory spices hover and banana esters flutter. There is a hint of citrusy tartness, herbs, freshly baked bread and plenty of luscious vanilla. It's a vanilla-banana split! 
Weihenstephaner would not have succeeded as the world's oldest brewery if it didn't make tasty beers. This weissbier is likely to be among (if not, the) most flavourful weizen you'll ever taste. It has an untypically high dosage of vanilla, a drop of lemony citrus, a teaspoon of honey, nutty pastry, fresh baked bread sprinkled in zesty spices and savory herbs. 
I really can't think of a more refreshing beer. I don't know that there is anything else I'd prefer on hot, sunny days. The beer is gratifyingly refreshing and loaded with full-bodied flavour. It has effervescence and substance. It has a spritzy carbonation but is also remarkably fluffy and creamy. The light peppery spice, the subtle herbal quality and the full-on fruitiness all blend wonderfully. 
I say the following with full disclaimer that it may just be my own opinion: Weihenstephaner Hefe-Weissbier is the best wheat beer. Ever. I'm not normally one to make claims like that and I generally don't believe that such an assessment can truly be made. However, this beer is so wonderfully formulated that I still can't help but hold it as the benchmark for every other wheat beer. 1,951 charactersbiegaman, May 30, 2007
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Part of the many discoveries I experienced at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, GA recently (a must if you're in the Atlanta area. This one was described as "widely considered the best hefe weizen in the world." Let's find out.
The appearance of this lovey Hefeweissbier which was served in proper glassware, a tall, hour glass shaped glass with the name and coat of arms design adorning it, was cloudy with a golden yellow hue. There was some lace that draped the glass, but no more than what would be expected for the style.
The aroma is light, but I could discern notes of cirtusy fruit such as oranges and nectarines and even lemon zest. Oddly, there was evidence of vanilla as well.
The taste is as fruity as the aroma, but in a subtle way, Very citrusy and crisp and so clean in the finish.
The mouthfeel is a crisp, citrusy delight as the brew hugs the tongue for a flash then finishes clean and refreshing like a good hefe should. 
This is a solid hefe weizen that marries well with the hot spring/summer of Atlanta. Worth the investment. 1,059 charactersjim102864, May 28, 2007
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a weizen glass. Color is a golden yellow with notable cloudiness and visible yeast in the bottom of the bottle (poured into the glass, of course). Head is very big, slightly sticky, and white. No lemon added.
Smells of ground wheat with whisps of banana odor and a very slight ester.
Taste starts out with a strong wheat and fades to a more malty flavor, with evident elements of citrus, banana, and cloves.
Mouthfeel is medium weight with lots of carbonation as expected in this type, and a nice smoothness at the end. The initial "hit" of the carbonation and wheat is very refreshing, and the barley notes ensure a finish that's not too harsh.
Many say that this (and other hefeweizens) is a beer for the hot summer afternoon. I could drink it all day, all year round. Absolutely delicious; light but flavorful. By far the best of its breed. 890 charactersdcteas17, May 26, 2007

So, it has been over a year since my review and I've had many tastings of this fine brew after the fact. 
This is hands down one of my favorite beers overall. I just can't get over the yeast contributed aromas and flavors. This is not just a great summertime brew, but a beer that can be appreciated all year long.
I have edited my overall score at a slightly higher rating.
---
Poured into a 25oz mug. 
This beer pours a cloudy pale orange, with a foamy white head.
You do smell some wheat and slight lemony zest.
The taste is very crisp with a nice carbonated attack. No bitterness at all, I definatley taste some cloves and a slight lemon twist. 
Mouthfeel is very refreashing and balanced. Good enough carbonation to tingle the tongue, with 0 bitterness in the back of the mouth. 
I could drink this all day. It's alcohol % isn't too high, so you can get away with drinking this beer with some authority. I highly recommend you use a big mug. 964 charactersBladeRunner, May 23, 2007

Residual clove in the aftertaste that is a big asset. Nice aroma of clove and bubblegum, encourages one to drink. Smooth carbonation and supreme sessionability, especially on tap.

S - Smell was light, very grainey with lots of yeast evident. Nice hints of cereal and malts, classic pilsner/german light lager/ hefe araoma. Very nice and was a very welcoming smell.
M & T - First impression was very light, frothy feel. Lots of subtle hints of mainly grains, and euro hops mixed in. Almost a burnt cereal type back to it and a nice caramel maltness. As it warmed some hints of fruit and spice, banana in the backround. Feel was great, with awesome carbonation.

Mouthfeel could not be better, crisp and refreshing, smooth and malty at once with a fantastic lingering finish. This is the definition of drinkability, and I don't even like Hefeweizens that much.

This pours from 0.5L bottle a cloudy light gold with a large head of foam that dissipates quickly but there's a few spotty islands that stay for the entire session and it has some lacing.
The smell is a nice mix of wheat, yeast, and fruit, mainly apricot.
The taste on first sip is very nice. I can taste good yeast and wheat flavours along with clove and some fruits...banana and apricot. There's some sourness there as well, most notable up front after a few more sips. The finish is pretty strong on the clove and I'm loving it. The body is medium as is the carbonation. Very, very drinkable. I'll have to see if I can pick some up the next time I get to Colorado. Yeah, it's so worth seeking out.
Bottom line: This stuff is *great*! Best Hefe Weizen I've ever had! 827 charactersBitterbill, May 15, 2007

Beautiful Hefe aroma of wheat, lemon, banana and clove... High marks here.
Taste is solid with flavors ranging from lemon-y zest tinged hops to creamy wheat malt. Slightly bitter tonic water-esque finish. This brew strikes a perfect balance amongst all ingredients. Active carbonation imparts a prickly bath on the palate. Creamy-slick mouthfeel renders this brew utterly drinkable. A great example of the style. Highly recommended. 558 characterssinistermadman, May 12, 2007

The taste was a little muted but still good. Again, a wheat bite and banana flavor that reminds me of Runts. Mouthfeel was good as expected, not too much carbonation and very crisp. I could let it rest on my tongue all day this summer. This is a good beer in every aspect. Nothing too exceptional to me but definitely above average. I'd say it's among the top hefes for me and at a good price. Try it, you'll probably like it. 527 charactersncvbc, May 11, 2007

A: About a finger of bubbly white head tops a hazy, dull orange brew. Looks fairly decent.
S: A nice clean, wheaty, and citrusy aroma swirls for a wonderfully aromatic combination. A bit of fruit (banana-like) and sweetness.
T: Very well-rounded in terms of flavor, a subtle wheat and pale malt intro leads into a bubblegum-esque middle. Following that is a light hoppiness that dries out for a great finish.
M: Not too carbonated, which was nice, but maybe a little more couldn't hurt. Overall, still maintains a creamy texture and nice body.
D: A really relaxed summer style beer with great drinkability. Don't know if it's all I had expected it to be, frankly, but it definitely holds its own. 753 charactersCharlieMopps, May 11, 2007

Now that I've given him his reference, this beer pours a cloudy, light gold with a dense peal-white head leaving light lace. 
The aroma is fragrant and fruity with hints of cider, banana, wheat. The flavor is smooth and grainy, with notes of banana, spice, and a honey-like sweetness. I did not detect the 'fresh-cut grass'. 
The mouthfeel is smooth and clean with a wheaty/fruity after feel (if there is such a thing). A great beer you can drink all summer long. 701 charactersletsgopens, May 10, 2007

S: yeast with some banana and more balanced toward the cloves.
T: starts with a yeasty/wheat tart flavor, middle is the signature clove flavor with only a slight hint of banana, and ends with a sharpening of the clove flavor combined with a small amount of bitterness from the hops. Aftertaste does not linger long with this beer and ready for more very quickly.
M: light and well carbonated.
D: very drinkable beer, flavor characteristics make you want to quickly consume, and could probably drink several in a sitting very easily. One of the better I have had with this style recently. If your preference for the style is more toward the clove flavors than the fruity bananas then this is a good example. A great beer for the spring and summer while sitting outside. 978 charactersjoeysmokedporter, Apr 25, 2007
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A magnificent beer. I drank this from bottle to a 500ml weizen glass and it produced a thick white head which stayed to the end. Off this head sprang lovely banana and dough aromas. The first taste was sparkly banana with clovey counterbalance. I had this too cold at first so it was a bit steely or metallic but as it warmed up it became more balanced and the mouthfeel was less crisp and a little sticky but still dry. This sounds a bit contradictory but that's the intersting thing about this ale. Everything is right with this. 531 charactersrjimlad, Apr 24, 2007

Appearance: Poured a hazy yellow with good head and retention. Did not lace.
Smell: Aroma of bread/wheat obviously with a spicy background.
Taste: Crisp tasting with wheat predominant, balanced nicely with spicy notes: clove, pepper, maybe a touch of banana.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and very crisp.
Drinkability: Very drinkable at a low ABV. Not difficult at all to quaff.
Overall: As summer gets closer, this beer will be remembered. A very good example of its class and perhaps one of the better hefes I've ever had. 564 characterscoalcracker, Apr 22, 2007

Very good bannana/clove estery aroma balanced with some light citrus orange hop aroma. The flavor is sweet at first with light bitterness at the finish. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Definately a very solid Hefe. 339 characterstigerdoc, Apr 20, 2007

Smell is typical of a hefe and well pronounced, wheat, clovey spice, yeast, and slightly sweet. Taste is similar to the nose, slightly sweet with the yeasty clove taste being the most obvious. The mouthfeel is excellent, medium-full bodied with a velvety consistency and the perfect amount of carbonation. A very drinkable hefe, very smooth, and one of the best out there. 470 charactersgmfessen, Apr 19, 2007
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a wonderful golden yellow/orange with plenty of active carbonation and an inch of creamy white head. Pour the yeast in and you'll get a super hazy orange hue. Aromas of light sun dried grains against lots of clove and banana along with some bubblegum scents as well. Spicy yeast that takes on a peppery aspect. Really vibrant, the aroma itself has a way of grabbing ahold of you. Wonderful.
First sip brings a smooth, lightly toasted sun dried grainy malt that's followed by a nice flow of clove, banana and bubblegum flavors. Light lemon zest along with a big spicy yeast. A touch of black pepper on the way down. Finishes smooth and clean. A super tasty hefe for sure. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with plentiful carbonation. Almost goes down too easily. This could make for a nice session IMHO. This brew deserves the praise...I love finding it on tap at a good German restaurant or pub. 912 charactersorbitalr0x, Apr 17, 2007

Maelstrom of carbonation ascends through light golden amber clouds.

It is topped by a very frothy white head that does not leave much lace but definitely has great retention. There is a good deal of rising bubbles from the ample carbonation.
The aroma is fruity with notes of banana, clove and green apples. The flavor comes on with a sharp tanginess even though the hop bitterness is minimal. There is a very slight bitterness in the aftertaste maybe brought on by the alcohol. It reminds me of the peeling or rind of some fruits. 
This is an fine example of the style. Very good. 570 charactersabcsofbeer, Apr 12, 2007
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured a hazy yellow with a tiny hint of orange hue. The head was a white creamy 4 finger monster with a ton of small bubbles rushing to the rim. The aroma of doughy banana bread came right off the head which also last throughout the drink. When the head settle of bit, the scent of coriander, clove and pepper came out. Also got a hint of pear and lemon somewhere in the middle. The flavor is outstanding, starting off sweet with a spicy middle that ended dry (everything that was smelled was tasted). The body was light, watery and lively carbonated which made it a crisp and smooth experience. Overall, I love this Hefe Weizen. It's a great starter brew for a long night of drink IPA and Stout. 697 charactersGimpyCane, Apr 11, 2007

Nose is quite yeasty, full of cloves, with a slight lemon tinge. Taste is an amazing smooth wheat malt overlaid with a wonferful yeastiness, a hint of banana (more subtle than I remember), lemon, a nice dose of cloves, a hint of grassy hops on the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect, medium bodied, moderate carbonation, absolutely smooth and creamy and full. This is a phenomonal hefe, one I could drink all day everyday, if it weren't for the import prices. 598 characterscubedbee, Apr 08, 2007
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5People seem to think this is the best, or at least one of the very best, Hefeweizens out there. I've had a fair variety in Germany, trying every one I've come across, and while Weihenstephaner impresses me, it's not the definitive beer of its style.
Appearance is appropriate - dull yellow-gold body with a dense, smooth head and low-moderate carbonation. Lacing is very nice. As for smell, the strongest one that comes across at any temperature is an acrid lemon aroma, probably due to the yeast. Banana is also evident - bouquet is not overly complex compared to comparable Hefeweizens.
Taste: Satisfying but again, not as complex as some others - some of my favourites are Maisel's and Schneider. Banana is present but not over the top, and a slight bitterness of hop is extremely refreshing. If only it were summer!
I'm not trying to say this is a bad beer. It is of an extremely high standard, and mouthfeel and drinkability are both very pleasing. It is never cloying, and is an appropriate drink on a cold or a warm night. I'd drink more if I could, but it's so expensive here...
Overall, I think it's overrated, but it's still a nice treat once in a while. 1,176 charactersWeizenmensch, Apr 08, 2007
3.76/5  rDev -14.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3This is a very nice Hefeweizen. The appearance was the usual hazy straw color with orange overtones. At first, it smelled of ripe pears and cloves; as the beer warmed, ripe banana notes became more prominent. The taste was a complex blend of the fruits and spices from the nose and the strong yeasty backbone I expect from this style. The carbonation was a little more prickly than I am used to, but it gave a great, rocky head that lasted quite a while. Quite a drinkable beer.
Sadly, this bottle was a bit past its prime, which is hard to avoid with Hefeweizen. Some cardboard flavors showed up once the beer warmed. But it was still very close to the stuff you get in Germany, making it one of the best Hefeweizens you can get your hands on. 747 charactersMickelswit, Apr 05, 2007

500ml bottle. 5.4%abv. best before 10/07
light golden color when held to light. thick cloudiness makes it appear darker when set on the table. medium high carbonation with lots of small bubbles slowly making their way to the top. like a mini co2 assembly line. very uniform.
head forms magnificently. about 2in thick. white thick and frothy with excellent retention. the only blemish being its just a bit more cloudy than i would expect for only pouring half the bottle. i know, anal, but its my review dammit.
mmm text book aroma. strong clove and banana. light yeast and a touch phenolic. seriously good stuff.
mmm text book taste. wait, did i already do this? j/k
honestly though, its all there. light, wheaty, fruity, yeasty, full of flavor, but soo easy to drink. each sip bring another. 
smooth on the palate, but starts to get filling towards the end.

Pours cloudy, light tan in color, with a tremendous white head that billows to the top of the glass.
Smells is very wheaty and yeasty, with bits of lemon and spice.
Taste is very good, thick wheat beer up front, with a good dose of Belgian yeast. Slight lemon also in the flavor, with a subtly bitter grassy hop finish. Quite sweet, but also well balanced. 
Mouthfeel is good, creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation.
Drinkability is good too. Very light and refreshing, a nice change.
Overall, this was my first hefe weizen, and I am impressed. This would be a great beer to have on a nice, hot, summer night. 653 charactersBMoney575, Mar 30, 2007
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Received from mymrnngjckt in the Secret Bunny '07 exchange.
Appearance: Poured into a weizen glass, hazy gold with a ridiculous head - rocky and great retention (billows of carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass maintain it). Sheets of lace. Appearance is perfect for the style.
Smell: Complex! Reminiscent of a tripel, really, in its complexity and spiciness. As far as typical hefeweizen aromas go, less bubble gum and banana, more clove. Crisp-smelling, not overdone.
Taste: A little less thrilling than the appearance and aroma. Spice, yeast, doughy malts. Banana and bubblegum are mild. Makes it more balanced, less "heavy" than many hefeweizens. Almost citrus-like acidity, but certainly not a "sour" beer. Not a trace of alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Very creamy, light-medium body, carbonation seemed high in the glass but works fine in the mouth.
Drinkability: High! Not surprising to see it rated so highly. Easily sessionable. 954 charactershunteraw, Mar 22, 2007

T: Flavor is filled with wheat, clove & a touch of banana. Very crisp herbal hoppiness and delicious malty sweetness.
M: Crisp and refreshing... body is medium to light. Mouthfeel and body are clean and fresh. Carbonation is moderate, deserving of a belch or two afterwards...

T: Very much like the smell. Raw with hints of lemon in the aftertaste. Delicious yeast character. Cracker like malt remains steady throughout and holds everything together. Clove and banana flavors are well integrated. Finishes dry.
M: Light and prickly. Medium to high level of carbonation is perfect for this style. Very well done.
D: Highly drinkable and very refreshing. I imagine this would pair very well with a variety of foods. Benchmark for the style in my opinion. This is what all hefeweizens should be. 763 charactersBassAssassin, Mar 14, 2007

The beer possessed no head when it arrived at the table, likely killed by the lemon juice. The aroma was somewhat alive with wheat and spices.

The aroma is rich, heavy with yeasty banana aromas, cloves, and esters. 
Tastes like it smells, only with piles of wheat adding to the rich spiciness and fruit. It feels substantial without being treacly; absolutely perfect. As for drinkability, I could put away ten bombers and still be craving more.
There are no tastes or smells that distinguish Weihenstephaner from any other Hefe, it's just that it takes everything that ever other Hefeweizen does and does it about a million times better. A perfect example of a tasty style. 700 characterskajerm, Mar 12, 2007
4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many years ago, I visited this "oldest brewery in the world" in Freising, Bavaria. The hefeweizen was definitely my favorite of their brews; indeed one of my favorite brews. More recently, I had this beverage on tap served in a traditional weissbier glass.
Appearance was just about perfect. Golden-cloudy with a magnificent crown. It looked like one of those mock-ups you might see in an advertisement.
Aroma was excellent, cloves and yeast with a hint of vanilla.
Flavor was also excellent. Vanilla and yeast, without the annoying sweetness of many beers of this variety.
Mouthfeel was full-bodied and smooth. No complaints here.
Drinkability was oustanding. A full-flavored beer that is also thirst-quenching. Be careful not to drink it too quickly! ;) 770 characterstravelfrog, Mar 11, 2007

S - Sweet yeast dominates the smell in the form of bananas and cloves.
T - Light spicy malt taste complimented with sweet yeast. 
M - Carbonation starts out at an uncomfortably elevated level but thankfully it fades to a more acceptable level after only 5 minutes. Consistency is medium.

Poured into a Hefeweizen glass at 45 degrees with a super head, cloudy, pale color and lots of Brussels or Belgium lace.
Hopefully a hint of things to come with clove, underlying yellow fruit, and yeast. Nectar of the gods.
Not shorted here either as the clove comes through as imagined with a slight comingling of sweet and dry.
Almost hate to swallow as the esters, phenols and other chemical reactions carom off of each other. Nice treat.
Very enjoyable to drink. Will definitely keep this one on my mind. 543 charactersSMark, Mar 01, 2007

A- Hazy straw with a touch of reddish-orange, topped by about an inch of head. Looks like a sunset in a glass! Isn't that cute.
S- Ooh, yeasty! Ripe bananas and lemon drop candy in the nose along with a hint of spice.
T- Pretty sour upfront with a lemony tartness. In fact, the tartness pretty much dominates the whole taste. Just a hint of the characteristic banana and clove phenols are evident in the middle. Wheat and a touch of hop bitterness on the finish. Pleasant aftertaste.
M- Very carbonated, but it suits the beer well. Extremely crisp.
D- Quite high. This is a good one to quaff on hot days.
Good beer for sure. Unlike the Schneider Weisse, however, this one is much better suited to the summer. Its tartness makes it very refreshing. Not my favorite Hefe, but still very enjoyable. Recommended. 923 charactersInsolublePancake, Feb 19, 2007

Smells and tastes of banana, malt, a hint of cloves and that nice tart wheat aroma. Medium-bodied and extremely well-balanced. Mouthfeel is like music in my mouth.

I poured it into it's own glass... (proper glassware!) Man, I should have taken a picture! The frothy off-white head rose a full half inch above the rim of the glass and slowly settled down. The nice cloudy weissebier appearance was perfect.
The smell was typical of a weissebier, only moreso. Bananas, citrus, bubblegum sweetness all wonderfully apparent.
Taste: NICE! Very creamy and smooth. A very nice hefeweissen. Notes of banana and a breadiness that contributed to the creamy texture. 
Mouthfeel was again nice and creamy.... no hoppy bite and a very clean finish. This beer leaves an aftertaste like a flowery, honey sweetness.
Drinkability: I could have had all five of these this afternoon, but then I wouldn't have anything to look forward to. 952 charactersTheBierBand, Feb 14, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had a number of 5 dL bottles that were very difficult to keep in their glass, but this particular bottle, even with a shake and a hard pour at the end, refused to raise more than a two finger head (which is quite long-lived, nonetheless). The head is a creamy tan-white, and leaves wide bands of lacing, particularly at the uppermost reaches of the liquid. The body is a hazy yellow-gold with amber highlights. The nose has big banana tones, but even stronger clove notes. The taste is very much like a banana bread with cloves tossed in (not as strong as in the nose) , with perhaps some Nilla wafers for good measure (the pudding association might be having an effect on me). A bit of light breadiness, too. The taste lingers, and has a bit of pepper in it. Phenomenal. It's head and shoulders above any hefe-weizen that I've crossed paths with. The mouth is fairly light, with fine but tingly carbonation. A fantastic beer. It can be overdone, perhaps, since I bought an entire case early in my beer advocacy and grew tired of it, but a year and a half later I'm thinking about another case in spite of myself. 1,118 charactersmjc410, Feb 14, 2007
4.29/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On the night of the first significant snowfall in the Northeast U.S., I take myself back 6 months to the hot summer with a thirst-quenching hefeweizen. Ok, I can dream, can't I? I just don't want to wait until June to really enjoy a great beer such as this one. Time to drink up!
APPEARANCE: Nice hazy, golden color - exactly what it should be. A modest head forms after a careful pour and dissipates into a solid white cap which lasts indefinitely. Small tight bubbles cascade up the glass, disappearing into the pillowy cap above.
SMELL: Yeasty and spiced with hints of lemon and, vaguely, banana. I'm somewhat surprised at the breadiness of this one.
TASTE: An initial blast of wheat gives way to some wonderful clove and lemon flavors. The finish is exceptional with the flavors suddenly floating away and leaving a clean and refreshing aftertaste that is bitter at first, but then becomes sweet. This beer just begs you to take another sip. The morphing and melding of flavors makes this beer into an experience for sure.
Edit: As the beer warms slightly, a distinct hop presence becomes noticeable in both the smell and taste. It doesn't change my scores at all, but adds yet another layer of complexity to this fine beer.
MOUTHFEEL: Fantastic. Smooth with perfect carbonation and finishes amazingly. Done absolutely perfect.
DRINKABILITY: Wonderfully refreshing and goes down like it was nothing. I'm almost done this one, and I really wish I had another. Don't buy just one!
On a hot day, this is the ideal beer. I can just imagine sitting back on the deck with a few a these and enjoying everything about the summer months. Instead I'm jolted back into reality, looking out the window at the falling snow and sleet of February. No matter. For 20 minutes, at least, I was kicking back in a summer paradise. 1,833 charactersjmalex, Feb 14, 2007

Poured a cloudy, pale yellow color. Very lively. Large, creamy white head.
Scents of clove and other spices, bananas and flowers. Very mild citrus.
Taste brought out bananas, clove & other spices again. More sweet than bitter, back to bananas and some other fruits. Very light touch of hops, citrus in character. Bit of pepper at finish.
Light bodied. Medium + carbonation, not quite effervescent, but close. Refreshing.
Overall, very easy to drink. Almost Belgian-Saison like in character. I could drink a lot of this, and I would love to try it fresh. Probably have to head to Germany for that. 671 characters, Feb 09, 2007

Nose of firm coriander/clove spice, well-balanced and not "in your face." A bit of banana and bread as well. Tastes of subdued, well-integrated coriander/clove spice, a bit of wheat/bready yeast. A tiny bit of alcohol at the end. A well-balanced hefe. Mouth is pleasantly smooth, semi-viscous, and light. Drinkability is high: this beer is tasty, smooth, and enjoyable. 
Overall: An outstanding hefe, no doubt, but still Im hardly a fan of the style. Certainly a great choice if youre into this type of beer. Recommended. 883 charactersjettjon, Feb 09, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured out of a 16 oz bottle that says this is the world's oldest brewery.
A - A hazy orange color with a huge white head that seems to last forever. 
S - I swear this'll make sense - It smells just like other hefe weizens, just better.
T - Wow, by far the best hefe weizen I've ever tasted. It's light-bodied, but there's so many different flavors in it. It is extremely yeasty and malty. This is exactly what a world class beer should taste like.
M - Slightly bubbly, light on body, long on taste and flavor, perfect.
D - If you've never had this before, you'll swear you could drink 15 pints of this after your first sip. It's too tasty, too drinkable and a perfect (if not the definitive) hefe weizen. 720 charactersLvilleIPA, Feb 06, 2007

Poured with a tall and durable head and was a beautiful hazy color. Can't wait to visit the brewery and Gasthaus next year so I can imbibe in larger quantitys. As an aside, I had a beer Philistine friend (drinks Icehouse) over and had him sample. He couldn't believe that this was what beer really was supposed to taste like!!! 460 charactersMarkSCCOT, Feb 04, 2007
4.11/5  rDev -6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on-tap at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, GA. in a .5 Liter hefe glass. Pours a beautiful cludy golden with a perfect fluffy white head and decent lacing. The smell is a little lighter than some other hefes, but there are notes of some light bubblegum and clove. The taste is similar, but also hints of banana and a reserved bitterness. A softer style of Hefe, and less carbonated as well then I remember it from the bottle. Very drinkable, but I found myself wanting slightly more pronounced banana and clove flavors. 522 charactersGeorgiabeer, Feb 03, 2007
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Presentation: Poured from a 500ml brown bottle into a weizen glass. Classic Weihinstephaner label with the coat of arms and the phrase "The world's oldest brewery." 
Appearance: Pours with the classic hefe head; 2-3 inches of almost pure white, creamy foam with enough surface tension to stick out of the glass over 1/2 an inch. The head settles to about a quarter inch coating. The beer itself is nice and cloudy and a deep yellow/orange.
Smell: Sweet and syrupy, with hints of bananas and oranges. 
Taste: A little bit of carbonation bite upfront, backed by a nice wheat tang and flavors of bananas and citrus. Yeasty and bready. Ever so slight bitterness in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Average level of carbonation. Good body.
Drinkability: A great exampel of the style. Perfect for when you are looking for a lighter beer that still has plenty of flavor. 868 charactersbeveritt, Jan 31, 2007

S - Huge amounts of banana, clove and spice. I am still getting familiar with the different spices used in beer so i'm not sure what the other spices are. 
T - Wonderful immediate explosion of banana, doughy bready goodness. Definitely spicy with clove and what seems like vanilla.
M - Smooth with just a little bite at the end. Good level of carbonation.
D - I could drink this anytime, a winner in my book. 552 charactersLynux, Jan 31, 2007

Smell: Big banana bread sweetness, yeastiness, a hint of clove, ctirus spiciness.
Taste: My first problem was I couldn't focus because I took a deep sip and then just kept drinking. Yeastiness, a fresh baked quality, the banana in the nose, then a lemony citrus hit, puckering, lightly hopped, finishes super dry with a little spiciness.
Mouthfeel: Smooth carbonation and makes it super easy to drink, cleansing, dry, tingling in the finish. It just disappears.
Drinkability: This beer is just delicious. As good or better than Paulaner which is a favorite, very well done. Exceptional. I need to keep this around. 772 charactersguitarmage, Jan 30, 2007
4.11/5  rDev -6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured out of the bottle with a 1 1/2 inch head. Beautiful to look at, a rusty straw color that is highly cloudy and opaque. Left beautiful lacing. Smell revealed hints of banana, which were fleeting, but also an almost metal-like aroma. Not unpleasant at all. Taste was well balanced with little hops but a fruity, almost playful character. Mouthfeel was fantastic, perfect amount of carbonation that fizzed up on your tongue after each sip, and an almost chewy texture. Overall this beer is very drinkable, and while I might have been expecting a little more as I was told this is the best example of a Hefeweizen, this is defintely a phenomenal beer. 653 charactersscythemk, Jan 28, 2007
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516.9oz bottle, poured into a pilsener glass.
Lovely white foam rises several inches and slowly recedes leaving a 1/3 inch layer of soft pillowy foam. Slightly hazy golden colored brew.
Aroma jumps out dough, banana, yeast, banana nut bread. Super fresh, clean, inviting.
Soft carbonation, refreshing in the mouth. Banana, but not overwhelmingly, more subtle. Next a touch of clovey spice dances across the tongue, carried by the bubbles popping...leaves a slightly spicy finish, very refreshing. The classic example of the style, as one would expect. Have not had better--this is the gold standard. 601 characterskenito799, Jan 27, 2007
3.75/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle into 23oz weizen glass.
Since it was a smaller bottle into a giant glass, I did a "normal pour", so half of the volume of the glass was foam (that was my intention). Therefore, the cloudy yellow amber color supported an extra thick off white head that holds well. It settles unevenly, giving it a smooth cloudy appearance. Solid layered lacing along the glass with spots of spots.
Smooth creamy aroma with banana and some sharp clove.
Crisp wheat malts with a creamy banana bread flavor. A light leafy presence hangs in the background. A little bit of citrus comes in here and there. Medium bodied and sharp on the palate from the carbonation. The finish is clean with maybe a little bit of lingering malt. 
A good crisp wheat ale from Germany. I can't say it's the best hefe weizen I have ever had, but it's a solid attempt, which makes sense since it's from one of the oldest. Recommended. 915 charactersBeerSox, Jan 21, 2007

After the initial pour there is no head to speak of with a ton of carbonation coming to the surface. A little murky and orangey in color. The flavor is nothing too special, with a tart citrus peel and yeasty character, it covers all the bases for the wheat beer faithful. A very good lunch time beer. 388 charactersMrSeth, Dec 24, 2006

The head lasted incredibly well as a 1/2cm cap. Wheaty, bready aroma, cloves right up front, zesty lemon, and fresh bananas. The taste was a smooth wheaty malt. Cloves and banana are there, and you can taste them well but they are not over powering, toned back maybe a little compared to some German hefe's. Quite a bit of zesty lemon, maybe a tad more than some other hefes. Rich medium bodied mouthfeel.
Verdict: basically as good as any other top hefe. So tasty I can't get enough. Highly recomended. 623 charactersdfried, Dec 04, 2006

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier pours into a hazy dark golden bod. Not much carbonation to talk about Not much lacing. I was surprised by the smell was expecting lots of cloves (which I hate) and was surprised by the strong scent of bananas and a very subtle spice aroma. Taste is wheat but not over powering there was the right balance of Malt and hops . I found the Mouthfeel to be a little thin, but not unpleasant. Not being a fan of this style I was impress. A very drinkable beer in a style I usually shy away from 620 characterspmatz2, Nov 23, 2006

S: One sniff and its got your attention. Extremely fresh yeasty aroma, banana peel, light lemon and fresh wheat.
T: Begins lightly spicy; cloves, yeast and bit of coriander. Traditional banana flavor are apparent but not over the top. Dryer than most wheats, bit grainer, low level hops add a touch of complexity. Little vanilla and fresh grass clippings finish it out. 
M: Medium body, full smooth mouthfell.
D: The flavors fell short of where I was hoping. This is on the easy drinking side of the spectrum with flavor taking a hit. Very nice beer but not my favorite German wheat. 773 charactersWestsidethreat, Nov 18, 2006
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I am a Hefe Weissbier fan, so this gets good marks from me anyway.
First of all, the appearance was standard orange/brown cloudy, with a white head that dissipated a bit quicker than I expected.
Smell and taste, too, were standard for a Hefe, and the taste was a bit more pronounced than, say, Hacker Pschorr, but with a tad less banana/clove. 
Mouthfeel was light, but well carbonated.
Drinkability was good, but I was not as impressed as the rating would lead me to believe. 488 charactersSchaefMan, Nov 17, 2006

Appearance: A hazy, orange gold with a huge, spectacular, rocky, thick head. An amazing looking beer, especially in the weizen glass.
Aroma: Wheaty goodness, with spicy phenols and faint banana esters. A bit of lemon as wel.
Taste and Mouthfeel: That refreshing, tangy wheat malt is the backbone of this beer. But it wouldn't be the same without the earthy yeast flavors, the hint of clove and the subdued banana esters. The mouthfeel is somewhat light, with a sort of crispness from the carbonation. 
Notes: Oh man, I could drink these all summer. A world class hefeweizen produced by the oldest operating brewery in the world. 700 charactersjdoolin, Nov 15, 2006

What a delight to drink. Pours a cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice creamy white head, tons of lacing afterwards. Scents of yeast, banana, slight hops, and clove. The taste is of slight banana, clove, slightly bitter, with a nice dry finish. Medium body, well balanced.

Appearance: Translucent, cloudy yellow-orange, murky and beautiful. Large, white, dense four-finger head. Great retention, leaving good lacing.
Smell: Wheat and yeast, almost bread-like in the nose, with vague hints of alcohol and whiffs of spice
Taste: A kind of omnipresent, prominent clove character that is not overpowering, but remains in the mouth and floats over the other flavours. Obvious bready malt character that mingles with a subtle yeast nuttiness. Gentle lemon sourness as it moves around the tongue. Very, very soft hop flavour. Aftertaste is a pleasing mix of the yeast nuttiness, wheat/barley malt, a gentler spiciness remaining with small hints of alcohol. Very soft banana-like character.
Mouthfeel: Slightly dry but smooth, with gentle, buttery carbonation.
Drinkability: Refreshing and easily drinkable
Verdict: Outstanding. My personal favourite. 940 charactersEdmund, Oct 29, 2006

M - Frothy, viscous, the tiniest bit of harshness from carbonation, the lord of refreshment.
D - I think this bottle might have gone awry. I have this before and it was unspeakably fantastic. This time it was just excellent. I have had it many times before and will have many times again. It is sessionable, food pairable, perfect for any and all situations. The gold standard of hefeweizens. After all, with nearly a millenia of brewing expertise under their belts, it is safe to assume that Weihenstephan can do their flagship beer correctly. 871 charactersmrasskicktastic, Oct 28, 2006

Appearance: beautiful gold almost pearlescent with a faint hint of red; my glass runneth over with foam, but it settled fairly quickly; little lace
Smell: clove-olicious, a little lemony, and that faint boiling wort smell I picked up in the dunkel.
Taste: stepped up clove along with a slightly peppery spiciness; quite tart but not overly fruity; lasting moderate hop bitterness.

This beer has a very citrusy aroma. I smell lemon and some banana. Also, I smell some spicy aroma. A slight grassy hop aroma is present also. 
This beer tastes much like it smells. Very citrus fruit like. Lost of lemon and some banana. It is slightly spicy, maybe just a little clove. Some grassy hop flavor is present. Saaz hops, I think.
This beer is very crisp and refreshing. It goes down very smooth. It leaves a fruity aftertaste. It is very highly carbonated.
I think this beer would make a great session beer. It is very easy to drink, and it is low in alcohol.
Overall: I think that for the style, this beer is great. I am not too fond of the style, but after this beer, I might have to try some other offerings. 909 charactersOStrungT, Oct 07, 2006

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a weizen glass.
Appearance - Pours with a beautiful white and extremely creamy/velvety head. The color is a honey/orange that is quite hazy, and extremely lively with carbonation rising from the bottom. The head retains very well, and very slowly dies down, ending up at a finger-thick cap of super creamy white head. Excellent, thick lacing all the way down.
Smell - Over-ripe cooked bananas on the nose. Some clove spice is present. Rich malt and wheat smell in the background. Some metallic alcohol smells can be picked-up on.
Taste - A smooth and balanced blend of the cooked dark bananas mixed with mellow but rich traces of wheat and malt. Again there is clove spiciness in the mix, and also some noticeable peppery character. Very little alcohol can be detected, but it's there.
Mouthfeel - A bit high on the carbonation, causing a quick bite at the first part of a taste. The body is very slick and smooth, and extremely "wet" in mouthfeel. Medium-bodied overall.
Drinkability - Very refreshing hefeweizen. It has good flavors and a nice mouthfeel. I could drink several in a night.
A very good hefeweizen we have here. Refreshing, a wonderful "wet" mouthfeel, and pronounced but balanced flavors. Recommended for sure. 1,278 charactersdblinkhorn, Oct 05, 2006

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My first ever Hefeweizen here. Poured a pale golden color with a massive 3 inch head that almost spilled over the top of my pint glass. Smells of cloves, and sweet malts. Taste is similar to the smell, cloves, a real nice smooth sweetness, that almost gets a 2nd wind at the end of the sip. Hints of banana in there as well. My initial impression is that this is very similar to belgian witbier's. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a great sweetness at the end of the taste that I am really enjoying. Drinkability, well I could see myself throwin quite a few of these back on a hot summer day, or after a bunch of work. A really great beer, seek this one out. 656 charactersIguana, Sep 28, 2006
3.54/5  rDev -19.5%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Appearance: Pours a murkey orange/apricot color with a full fluffy white head.
Smell: The aroma is full of bananas and wheat, with a bonus of melon.
Taste: Bananas again and the very heavy wheat taste complete the taste.
Mouthfeel: Thicker than other hefeweizen's I've tried, and is aided by a hint of alcohol on the swallow.
Drinkability: It's quite drinkable for the style, and on a hot day, but overall I'm not too impressed and would rather spend my money on a new beer than having this one again. 513 charactersdbalsock, Sep 20, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Pilsner glass from a 12 oz bottle. Nice looking light amber haze of beer with a beautiful white head. The smell has a lot going on. Lots of delicate lemon citrusy-ness, grains, and a pinapply edge. The taste is simply incredible. It opens with a wheaty, bready cirtusness. The wheat pulls through in the middle. The finish of this beer is what really amazed me: A smooth fruityness with a citrusy twang that hangs on the mouth for 5-10 seconds afterwards. The mouthefeel is carbanoted, light, and bready, like a wheat beer should be. The drinkability is also incredible: a session beer for sure. Definately an excellent Hefe-Wiezen and an excellent beer all around. 679 charactersrkowalick, Sep 20, 2006
4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is one of my favorites along with the Schneider Weisse. Pours to a hazy yellow orange with lots of white foamy bubbles, mmm. The mouth feel is light having lots of gentle suds that hug your taste buds hello, whisking away to a nice banana fruity feel, ahhh this is why god made beer! No bitter after taste and leaving you wanting just a bit more. Sorry I got carried away there. I am drinking one as I write. Drink ability is great, if stranded on a desert island I would want a lifetime supply with a bottle opener! Respect the Hefe! 539 charactersSudNut, Sep 18, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance- Cloudy orange- very traditional hefeweizen color. Huge white head as expected. Some lacing.
Smell- Typical hefeweizen smells- nothing shocking. Banana and clove, a bit bready, wheat is definitely prevalent.
Taste- Banana bread, has a traditional 55/45 (wheat/barley) taste to it. A bit sweet at moments. Yeast gives a bit of an unrefined taste to it at times also. Hints of citrus.
Mouthfeel- Carbonation is right on for me. I wouldn't exactly call it a dry finish, but it does leave you thirsty for more.
Drinkability and other notes- This is an excellent beer- summer or not. It's easy to see why this is the top ranked Hefe Weizen on BA currently. 674 characterslpayette, Sep 18, 2006
3.95/5  rDev -10.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap with a big slice of lemon. Poured to a nice hazy orange-red, with minimal head or lacing. Aroma was mostly wheat and bread, although some smell may have been overshadowed by the lemon. Taste was again, mostly wheat, bread and yeast, with a hint of clove spice. Finish was a little dry, though all and all, this was a good beer for a warm summer night. 362 characterskimcgolf, Sep 17, 2006
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4BB 21/02/2007. Served chilled in a proper, 500ml weizen glass.
A: pours a cloudy, bright orangey-yellow colour; the semi-lively carbonation supports a medium-thick white pillowy head that sustains throughout the drink. Very nice~~
S: sweet grainy and wheat-ish aroma with a touch of candyish sweetness upfront; a slightly ashy hop resins contradicts with very intense aroma of dried-mangos, sweet bananas, intensely sour-sweet fruity yeastiness, while the tinge of clove is pretty restrained at the back. The nose is richly fruity overall--not bad, but not complex enough.
T: smooth, light, and effervescent textured candyish, grainy and bready malts caresses the tongue... ensued by chewy, tartly-sweet (but not thin) fruitiness of green apples, mangos and green bananas--overall the malt-sweetness is balanced by just enough sour fruity hint... the yeastiness is much softer than most hefe-weizen I've tasted, rendering a balanced profile and a soothing wheat-ish grainy sweetness lingering in the finish aided with a suitable kick of of dryish-bitter spice at the fringe.
M&D: great balance, great body and creamy-fizzy texture, yet the flavour lacks some sparkles--amazingly delicious or weird edge of something... This beer is very easy to drink, enjoyable, and could hardly inflict criticisms thanks to its safe flavour profile; but the "traditional taste" (I imagine so) shown by this bottle doesn't give me the urge or passion to go for more than a bottle at any one time. A "good honest" hefe-weizen it is--not great one, alas. 1,542 characterswl0307, Sep 16, 2006
3.46/5  rDev -21.4%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Weihenstephaner Hefe Wiessbier
12oz. Longneck
The beer looks great. A nice label claiming the oldest brewery in the world. Great golden coloring with a beautiful head and awesome lacing.
It's smells like my grandma's house for some reason... anyways. A great hops punch in the nose. Lots of spices and fruits. All these flavors just jumped up when I smelled. For some reason I didn't enjoy it as much as some other brews.
After I finally took a sip I wasn't very impressed for some reason. I had good flavoring and the blends of flavors really added to the experience but I still wasn't impressed by this. The hops punch it right at the beginning and it was really sweet on the tongue but something happened when I swallowed. I couldn't taste it anymore.
It has a good weight to it with a medium to full body feel but the sweetness really takes me out of the drinking experience. It still is good on the way down until I can't taste it anymore. Still one of the better brews out there but my experience was very bland.
I'll try it on tap next time. 1,064 charactersghostmech007, Sep 13, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big head with little lacing. Head retention is very good and the color is golden brown and cloudy. The smell is bready with lemon, banana and clove that pair beautifully. The taste is like the perfect hefeweizen with more lemon and clove than banana. The mouthfeel is crisp with carbonation and very good for a hefeweizen. Overall I loved this beer and will have as many as possible. 383 charactersErdinger2003, Sep 13, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pored into weisse glass. 
A: Hazy golden-yellow with big, fluffy, pillowy white head. Dissipates completely, but takes its sweet time doing so.
S: Oh my. Huge aroma. Wheat, lemon, banana, clove. 
T: Wheat up front with some lemon, and the banana hits toward the middle and builds toward the end. Finish is clean, with an ever-so-slight bitterness with a long banana and bread tail. 
M: Wonderfully chewy. 
D: Hell yes. I could drink this all the time. It's very flavorful, not too alcoholic, and it can be either refreshing or warming: drink it at a cooler temp and it's a summer refresher, drink it a bit warmer and it's a banana bread-y comfort ale. Just a terrific beer. I prefer it warm. 706 charactersrarevos, Sep 12, 2006
4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Into a weizen glass, pours a murky yellow gold to yellow amber, with great head and stringy lacing. 7066 on the label, whatever that means. Nose has lots of banana and wheat, clove, slight breadytextbook German wiezen, in all the good ways. 
Likewise with the taste and mouth, Weihenstephan is the gold standard of German beers, clean and crisp mouth, just the right carbonation, light but full. A beautiful balance of banana, bready malt, clove, just the slightest hop profile through the middle, and a little citric lemon. 
They've been doing this for a thousand years, and it shows in this one. Fantastic. Fan-friggin-tastic. 634 charactersobjectivemonkey, Sep 11, 2006
3.94/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5120z. Bottle poured into a pint glass.
A - WOW. Gorgeous and large pure white head. Cloudy, orange/yellow appearance w/no sediment. Perfect.
S - Mild smell of hops.
T - Really unique taste. Fruity, but tart. Quite malty. Almost a sugary aftertaste. Very complex, high marks are almost due more to this factor than taste.
M - Amazing. Very chewy, like a Hefe Weizen should be.
D - Somewhat drinkable, heaviness and bitters hold it back. 450 charactersFuzzyGuy84, Sep 09, 2006
3.25/5  rDev -26.1%look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Hefeweiss style is one of my favorites, especially during the late spring and summer months. You can usually find Hacker-Pschorr or Paulaner Hefeweiss in my garage refrigerator while I'm working on the motorcycles getting them ready to ride as the weather starts to warm up here in the Chicagoland area. I was looking forward to trying this brew, but came away somewhat disappointed since it didn't impress me as I had hoped. Just came across as "average" and I expected more considering it's lofty position in the top 100 at BA. I'll surely give this one another go, but for now..
A: Typical cloudy straw yellow of a heffeweiss. More bottom sediment than I would have thought gave way to some chunky floaters. Not usual, I would think. Head was OK, but not like the wipped cream topping I usually see from my usual weiss beers.
S: I couldn't really get a solid aroma from this beer. Faint clove and banana fragrance, but not like the assertive nose banquet I'm used to from Hacker-Pschorr.
T: Pleasing, thirst quenching with a clean finish. Still the flavors were subdued compared to what I'm used to. Again I expected to be impressed.
M: Tartness lingers on the palate. Beer is smooth and has a crispness that is enjoyable. My favorite part of this beer. I really liked the finish.
D: I'm sure as with most beers of this style an afternoon session on the deck with the grill going and friends stopping by make this an easy drinking brew. 1,446 charactersBarrelBrother, Sep 06, 2006
3.82/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5This beer poured a golden cloudy color with a persistent head. It had a mild floral smell. The taste was slightly floral, mild, well - balanced and delicate. The mouthfeel was slightly thin but smooth and mellow. This would be a very drinkable beer for many occasions. 268 charactersbarefootbrewer, Sep 04, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I bought this beer at a World Bazzar type store - lots or beer and wine, but lots of baskets and rugs too. And this beer wasn't kept cold and could have been sitting there for a long time. But I couldn't believe I hadn't tried it since it has been around since a few hundred (917) years before me.
I have tried a number of other hefewiessen's (I was even in Bavaria a couple times as a young teen and drank some beer at that time). I also had tried some other stuff from very old breweries. I am usually not impressed - I'm more of an IPA/Stout/heavy duty kind of beer person. All this, plus a cheap price (5.99) led me to not expect too much. 
I had the first one absolutely warm. It was great! Actually, I think warm is better than the 50 degree I kept them at after that. Store these cool, drink them warm. Enjoy, they are the real deal. I have since found these at a local (NE Ohio) carry out for around $9. I guess I need to head back to World Bazzar. 962 charactersschoolboy, Sep 03, 2006
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful cloudy yellow with a full 3 finger white head that melts to a wonderful stickiness.
Aroma is sweet wheat with a hint of lemon and a 'softness' I cannot put a name to which makes the aroma pleasantly addictive.
Taste is cracker wheat with light spiciness....a bright clove...and very, very llight lemon. Clove is very prominant and flavors so bright there is something desert-like in this light and refreshing treat.
Aftertaste is pleasant cracker-like drying
Definately the finest Heffe Weissbier I have ever had. 527 charactersIntriqKen, Sep 02, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: A brown bottle, I think it is 16oz? Says it is the Oldest Brewery in the World, oh the things you learn from drinking. No freshness date that I could find, just a 4 digit number, I assume this to be the batch number.
Appearance: Pours slightly cloudy, I swirled but not much yeast came out so it could have been better, my bad. Orangish in color with a nice white head that doesn't quit.
Smell: This is how a wheat beer should smell. Wheat malts, clove-y spices and citrus banana. Nice.
Taste: The taste is very evident in the aroma. Nice carbonated with a wheat malty backbone with notes of clove, citrus, banana and yeast. Clean and crisp, refreshing and delicious after mowing the lawn. I wish I had another.
Overall: I wasn't THAT big of a hefe fan until I had this. I will now compare all other hefe's to this. A great summer beer! 862 charactersjarsh, Aug 30, 2006
3.62/5  rDev -17.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured a rich deep tan color, with a little head. I could smell the fruitiness, a bannana type smell. It had a strong hefe taste that lasted after you swallowed. The aftertaste had hints of fruit flavorng but not overpowering, subtle but present. The mouthfeel presented as heavy with that fruitiness present. 
This was shown to me by a clerk at the liqour store and I can see why. This is a good hefe weizen that has a strong flavor that does not over power the drinker. It's apperance, smell and taste are all solid in nature but never overpowering or overwhelming. I would definitely drink this again. 605 characterscbros, Aug 27, 2006
4.16/5  rDev -5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hazy golden color with fluffy white head which it retains for a long time. Aroma consists of cloves and a yeasty aroma. Taste is banana and cloves and a maybe bubblegum. Finish has slight hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. This is a great summer beer, a great beer to drink while watching baseball. I could drink several of these in a sitting. 
The only drawback on this one is that it is probably old, since its imported. I can only imagine how good this would be if it were fresh. 511 charactersDizzy, Aug 23, 2006
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12oz bottle with no apparent freshness date but there was a code on the back label. Was an cloudy honey color with couple fingers foam and good carb. Some lacing. Smell was fantastic - exactly what you expect in a great hefe. Tones of clove, banana, etc. The taste was incredible. This has been one of my top 5 for a long time. Actually suprised that I'm just now getting to reviewing it. Great mouthfeel as well. Great beer to try in general and a must if like Hefe's. Also has a permanent home in my fridge. (5.0,HR,T,Y,HOF) 540 charactersTexIndy, Aug 22, 2006

12 oz brown bottle
Jet ink label on the back label that reads 4505
Served in a Schneider Weisse glass
Pours a murky and cloudy light mustard yellow. Huge, fluffy head on top that leaves incredible patterns of sticky lacings on the glassware. The head sustains a good size as I drink the beer down. 
Super intense aroma of cloves, oranges and strong whiffs of yeast. 
Doughy, juicy mouthfeel with a spicy clove quality and black pepper bite. MAJOR banana highlights with a touch of lemon citrus twang. Mini hop bitterness on the finish. 
The drinkability level is purely ridiculous. So refreshing, enjoyable and thirst quenching. I could have this beer in the morning, afternoon or night. It's perfect on a hot August day like today. 
I think this is one of the best hefeweizens out there. I love everything about it - the intense and ripe nose, complex flavors and the incredibly smooth drinkability level. Recommended. 968 charactersHibernator, Aug 17, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512 oz bottle.
Pours a hazy amber-yellow, large amount of head, settles after a bit of time and leaves good amount of lacing.
This is one great smelling, aromatic beer. Bannana cloves, sweetness, citrus and spice come together and produce a very appetizing smell.
The taste is just as good. Of course the sweetness is most apparent, a bit of a citrusy zing as well. One of the best features of this hefe is the mouthfeel, full and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation, as well as an extremely refreshing taste just make this beer incredible through and through.
It's been a while since I've had one of these and it is even better than I remember. Truly one of the best, if not the best, hefe's I have ever had. Definitely worth seeking out and trying. 769 charactersBurnsTau, Aug 17, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this on tap at the Hop Devil Grill in New York over the winter, and thought this was one of the most amazing beers I ever had. When I finally found it in bottles recently, I was very excited to try this and see if it could live up to how I remembered it. It wasn't the awe-inspiring brew I remember having on tap, but nevertheless, this is still an amazing beer and the benchmark against with all hefe's should be measured! 
Very nice pour - I love the radiantly cloudy hue of this and the nearly overwhelming head. Like most hefe's, the lacing could be better, but what it lacks in that, it more than makes up in taste and mouthfeel. Banana, grass, clove, bubblegum, you name it - it's here, and it's an absolute joy to swish around. What puts it over the top is the mouthfeel. Carbonation everywhere, the taste lingers just right, but it never feels too light, forced, or tingly. Just loads of bubbles like Sierra Nevada, but no bitterness to go with it. A wonderful sense of effervescence and range of flavors are this brews hallmarks!
I felt a bit more citrus and remember the head being perfect when I had this on tap. Yes, the bottled version doesn't live up to that, but I have yet to taste a beer that was just as good in a 12 oz. serving as it was in a pint glass, right out of a freshly tapped pour. No matter - there's a great reason why this is #1 for hefe's and near the top of my list as well: The range of flavors, the enjoyingly easygoing nature of this beer, and the full mouthfeel are a deadly combination. You've been warned! 1,556 charactersJerzDevl2000, Aug 14, 2006
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a cloudy orange yellow with a creamy long lasting white head.
Smell is a good mix of Banana, Citrus, Clove, and some other spices.
Has a nice bit of yeasty flavor with banana, clove, Wheat and nice bit of lemony zip all making appearances. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and very creamy with a nice bit of citrusy zip at the end for a crisp finish.
A very good and tasty Hefe. Fantastic session beer. 409 charactersbashiba, Aug 13, 2006

Smell is bready banana nut. Mild yeasty spices.
Taste is similiar to the nose. Wonderful breadyness. Bananna and citrus fruit. Spices are sharp with clove out front and milder pepper. Finish is crisp with lingering spice.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy.
A great example of this classic style. Tasty enough that you will wonder where it went. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. You gotta give this one a try. 506 charactersBlakaeris, Aug 10, 2006
4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep, straw-yellow with copious amounts of foamy, white head. Deep oranges provided by the cloudy yeast. However, not quite as cloudy as many other hefes. 
Sweet, aromatic and floral on the nose. Loaded with banana, notes of sweet clover honey and candied yams. A very enjoyable aroma. 
Sweet and "yeasty" on the tongue. Great notes of banana, clove, bubble gum and caramelized brown sugar. Slightly nutty and earthy in the finish. The sweetness is perfectly balanced and never becomes over-bearing. As with any hefe, the yeast makes the beer and this one nails it. 
Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced for a hefe. The yeast is well distributed with no dirty teeth feeling or clumps while enjoying. 
Drinkability is huge. This beer is very refreshing, loaded with a constant flavor and very creamy. Possibly the perfect hefe. If there is one downfall, this beer is best consumed while still cold. It does tend to taste a little watered-down if allowed to warm too much. 
A world classic representation and benchmark for the style in my opinion. 1,063 charactersBudlum, Aug 05, 2006
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Man, the bubbles are never stopping here. When the bottle was opened the bubbles continued to pour out of the bottle for 2 minutes. There is plenty of carbonation here but that is not what this beer is all about. Bananas and Cloves!
You can smell both a little but upon first taste you are overwhelmed by the Clove. It is a clean slightly hoppy clove and banana flavor with a spicy aftertaste. Very good.
I don't know about drinking multiples of this beer but I can see why it is rated so high. 496 characterspeabody, Aug 04, 2006
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Lightly bemired soft gilded straw with a healthy white cloud that persists till the end of the glass. Aromas are obviously German, malty, and lightly fruity. The expected attributes of banana and clove are present but very light in comparison to many others of the style. Along with them one finds lemons, spring flowers, and oranges. All is exceptionally fresh and airy. Body is light and alive with plenty of spicy yeast character. Sweet malt and fruity yeast flavors blend perfectly with a subtle hop bitterness. Finish touches on the dry end of the spectrum with a nice crispness as well. Carbonation is moderate to lively. Drinkability is flawless. This may be the perfect hefe but I do prefer mine to be a bit dirtier. This one is just too flawless. 755 charactersDaPeculierDane, Aug 02, 2006

Smells of crisp wheat, with the standard banana and spicy clove notes. Not very outstanding, but pleasant and to style.
Light bodied, with mild banana notes and some bubblegum. Crisp finish.
Light and refreshing with nothing out of the ordinary. Just a solid wheat beer, with some good yeasty fun. 425 charactersLitterbean, Aug 02, 2006
4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into my Franziskaner Weissbier glass.
A - Beer pours a lemony yellow color, a bit cloudy with a huge amount of carbonation. I don't think this can be measured in "fingers". More like hands. Roughly 1.2 hand worth. Several little bubbles continue to race up to the surface. Very good. 
S - Ahh, now THIS is a Hefe. Sweet clove, bananas and bubble gum. Yeasty as all hell, but that is how it is supposed to be. Not much in the hop department, other than a Noble hint here and there. 
T - Bananas and clove again, but very bready. Like a sweet muffin, really. Starts candy sweet, and then the spice takes hold. Bits of clove and cinnamon and then the pepper, which I attribute to the Noble bite. 
M - Excellent. Light, but at the same time it has a chewy feel. Exceptionally smooth and very drinkable. Probably the best Hefe I have sampled to date. 
D - See above. Time to get some more. 925 charactersSethB2, Aug 01, 2006

Pours a cloudy yellow straw color. Thick head of large off white bubbles. Aroma is of clove and banana with a hint of lemon. A little bubblegum thrown in there. Clove comes out over the others in the taste along with a sweetness. Wheat character is evident. Aftertaste is yeasty and spicy with just a touch of bitterness. Easy drinking despite the medium to heavy body (for a hefe). Definitely not the watered down versions I have been plagued with all summer. 534 characterssacfly, Jul 29, 2006
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy orange-yellow with a couple fingers of bubbly white head that deplete to a clingy ring that hangs on through the whole glass. Particularly as the beer warms a bit, the nose is soft, clean and grainy with a pleasant bit of spice. That taste carries over nicely to the taste, which is a hefeweizen through and through. The mouthfeel has a crisp snap, but the flavors are able to shine thanks to the pleasant softness as well. I liked this beer well enough the first time around (when I suspect the bottle I had was past its prime). This time it was just what I was after. 582 charactersBitteBier, Jul 28, 2006
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5500ml brown bottle, 5435 on back label.
Foggy pale straw. Short, off-white head of small bubbles that settles quickly to a bit of head dust and no lacing. Ample carbonation streams race upwards. Big clove and banana peel as well as an orange-spiked with cloves aroma. Initially tingly crisp with some cloves and light bananas as well as a modest lemon pith note. The cloves gather in intensity in the early finish before giving way to a crisp hop note that lingers briefly with some lemon tartness. Light bodied with a bubbly, yet smooth mouthfeel that accentuates the clove and banana flavors. Enjoyable and a wonderful representation of the style.

Kind of loses some of it's appeal when it's not served in a weizen glass. Anyway, nice golden color with a great aroma: banana, fruity, lemony, and clove. Good carbonation. Could drink lots of these at a sitting. 325 charactersdoubleipa, Jul 27, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Dark murky gold color with a nice healthy head of thick frothy foam. Head holds remarkably well--no lace to speak of. 
Smell is perfect for the style. I believe these people invented the hefe-weisse. The nice thing is that there are all the familiar elements--banana, wheat, coriander, clove, etc. but they are so perfectly subtle. The taste is much the same with a hint of citrus--almost lemon zest. I did not put a lemon in this beer--further proof that one is not needed. What more can be said--this is the Hefeweizen against which all others should be compared. Extremely pleasant quenching mouthfeel and very smooth and drinkable. 638 charactersrousee, Jul 26, 2006
3.96/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thick, foamy head, good three fingers depth at start, which comes back to a centimetre for the duration. Not much obvious carbonation. Nice frothy lace hangs on 'til the end.
Cloudy pale amber, to a pale golden yellow at the edges.
Wheat malt nose, clove - hint of lemon. With the last pour (and extra yeast), perhaps a note of honeycomb.
Clove flavour dominant in the froth, but once you get through this (and on your nose), a nice wheaty, creamy mouthfeel, light, malty. Some banana, which lingers on a while, but not as estery as the Schofferhofer, imho. 560 charactersvancurly, Jul 24, 2006

Pours a hazy golden yellow with an excellent white foamy head. Lots of carbonation, light lacing. Fruity aroma of banana and apples, yeasty with hints of cloves, sweet malted wheat. Smooth, light texture, fizzy aggressive carbonation. Sweet fruity taste of banana, spicy clove and yeast. Hints of lemon zest. Extremely light bitter finish with a peppery aftertaste. All around a very balanced beer. A perfect Hefe, best I've ever had. Very refreshing and delicious.

Strong wheat aroma with a hint of fruit, possibly banana.
Rich yeast flavor with smooth, malty background. Hint of spice and fruit.
Slightly frothy, but pleasant mouthfeel.
The overall, a very drinkable beer. Nice, complex flavor. Probably the best hefe weizen I've tried so far.
As a side note, I got a kick out of the picture on one side of the gift box. It is a group of nuns laughing and drinking beer. You've gotta love Bavarian attitude. Prost! 647 charactersAmorousAngel, Jul 24, 2006

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I only got the little 12oz. bottle and after drinking this, I wish I had bought the big bottle. The label is just very simple and nice by having the brewery or family crest in a big white oval with a black background. The back label has the Govt. warning and a number at the bottom. I'm not sure what it means, but it's number 3076. 
Appearance: When I poured it into a Weizen glass, the beer was the usual weizen color of hazy orange with the usual massive head of white foam. When it receded it left plenty of foamy rings and barely any lace around the glass. I thought it would leave tons of white sticky lace in its tracks, but it just didn't for some reason.
Smell: It smelled like a Hefe Weizen should smell like, by having a nice aroma of cloves, citrus fruits, some bananas, hint of wheat, and all of these aromas were wrapped around the yeast.
Taste: Like the smell, this beer tastes like a Hefe Weizen is supposed to taste like and it tastes like it smells too. Up front were the cloves, citrus fruits, and a minor taste of the bananas. After that came the wheat and the yeast. What more can you ask for from a Hefe Weizen?
Mouthfeel: It was very light, smooth, creamy, and with a nice amount of carbonation. I did notice a slight aftertaste of yeast, but it left so fast that it was hard to tell it was even there.
Drinkability: Like I said before, I still wish I had bought the bigger bottle of this. It was so easy to drink, that the 12oz didn't last long. If was flavorful and light, that it was hard to put down on a hot summers day. Better yet that it's very affordable and it's almost everywhere. A must try Hefe Weizen! 1,652 charactersAltBock, Jul 16, 2006
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 500 ml. bottle. Left a two finger head that receded to long lasting surface skim, and no lacing. Body was a cloudy pale orange yellow. Looks good.
Smell - bananas and cloves, hint of creamy wheat. Mouthwatering.
Taste - same as the smell. Bananas and cloves with subtle creamy wheat, and even more subtle toasty malt. This is the classic, refreshing, and delicious taste of hefe-weizen. Nothing more complicated than that.
Mouthfeel - full, smooth, creamy, low carbonation.
Drinkability - this is very good, and goes down very easy. I'd say this is very sessionable, and very refreshing and satisfying on a hot day. 641 charactersultralarry2006, Jul 14, 2006
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Gold and hazy in colour with strong carbonation. Typical hefeweizen aromas of vanilla, clove, banana, and a bit of citrus. Nice tangy wheat flavor, with more vanilla and banana in the mouth. A bit of spicy hops on the finish too. Very nice full mouthfeel that still refreshes. Definitely more on the vanilla/clove end of the spectrum, with the fruity notes being held in check. A classy (and perhaps the "classic") interpretation of the style. 443 charactersfisherman34, Jul 14, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Drank from a ONE PINT, 0.9 FL. OZ. bottle purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits, Somerville, MA
Poured a hazy, yellow ochre with a two-finger, tight, white, foamy head that slowly faded to a clingy film. Outstanding retention. Spotty drops of lacing stuck along the glass.
The aroma was incredibly rich and smooth. Yeasty, spicy and phenolic. Sweet aromas of bubble gum and cotton candy were quite noticeable. Some wheatiness came through as well, along with a touch of smoke.
The flavor was very similar to the aroma. Lemony, citrusy and spicy (clove and allspice) up front. Semi-sweet and fruity in the center, with notes of bubblegum coming through strong. The finish was crisp, tart and ultra-clean with a lingering bubblegum aftertaste.
Mouthfeel was light, fluffy and highly effervescent initially, yet the liquid soon settled to a rich, creamy froth on the palate.
Drinkability was outstanding. I cannot think of another beer that was so crisp, clean and refreshing, and yet so full-flavored.
It is only fitting that the oldest brewery in the world produces one of the best beers in the world. Pair this one with some fresh wild salmon on a warm summer day. Life simply cannot get any better. 1,204 charactersDamian, Jul 14, 2006

S: Huge banana & wheat malt notes
t: Bananas, bandaids, wheat malt & cloves up front. Fruittyness follows as it warms. Finsihes like a piece of juicy-fruitgum (quenching & fruitty)
MF: Full bodied, semi-effervescent. A little too much going on flavor-wise to get full marks balance-wise
Drinks okay, but not a huge fan of the style, but if the weather is warm. I could throw this down no problem, but I'd be happier with a nice helles or pils. Very much representative of the style. 575 charactersrusspowell, Jul 09, 2006
4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Looking through the reviews of Weihenstephaner beers, I tend to find comments like 'wonderful', 'perfect', 'simple', or admonitions that can be paraphrased as 'if they've been brewing since 1040, they must be doing something right'. I agree with all of these statements.
The hefe pours out a hazed tangerine with a placid skim and a few scant lace lines.
The nose is clearly a clove-bomb. Lime zest. 
The taste is intensely delicious - and i'm not the world's hugest hefe fan. Cloves, lemon/lime interplay, and an uber-clean wheatiness are strong and floral. 
Much like all Weihenstephaner beers, this is amazing on the tongue. Smooth, silky, and drinkable. The huge clover-load does limit the drinkability to a certain degree.
These beers have been inundating the Fort Wayne area, and for that I am grateful. The thought of DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, et al. are rather ridiculous in this steamy weather so these brews have been tickling me in all the right spots. 976 charactersGreenWBush, Jul 08, 2006

Cloudy dull gold with a thick foamy head, easily three fingers in width. I'm nearly beaten over the head by the nose. Bananas, apricots, cloves, this has it all in full effect. Taste is pretty much the same but I can taste the alcohol a little more than I'd like. Wow, I could drink a ton of this. So smooth in the mouth and just goes down easily. 427 charactersTheBungyo, Jul 08, 2006
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Very murky and hazy yellow color. Huge fluffy white head. Good aroma-nice blend of banana and phenolic esters. Somewhat peppery and spicy. Very clovey in the flavor though finishes quite crisp and clean. Decent mouthfeel. As usual hefes are not my thing but this one is supposed to be a classic and I find it quite enjoyable. Needs to be a hot summer's day beer for this kid but overall it was quite decent. 407 characterslackenhauser, Jul 02, 2006
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer poured an opaque golden yellowish/orange body with a thick white head.
Nose is extremely present with waves of yeast, bananas, wheat and tiny snippets of lemon zest. Almost the perfect weiss beer smell.
Body is light to medium bodied and very smooth from beginning to end. Immediate grain, yeast, wheat and a nice fresh malt taste. Touches of spices, numbing cloves, some soft nuts, banana, lemon. A nice spicy bitterness that sits well and gives some good balance. Ends smooth with a nice spicy character.
I don't know how they do it, but this beer is just as good here in the US as it is back in Germany. Most others lose that edge after the long boat trip, but this, damn good. Amazing. The bar by which most all weiss beers strive for. 758 characterstaez555, Jun 29, 2006
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pour: .5L to pint glass. Pour produces a beautiful honey colored beer with a two and a half finger fluffy white head that clings fervently to the glass all the way down. A cloudy body and plenty of bubbles make this a beautiful beer to observe.
Nose: Wow, all the classic hefe-weizen characteristics at their best! Orange, cinnamon, clove, a big yeast spiciness. A tad on the light side (preventing a 5) but damn it smells good.
Mouth: Better than I could have hoped. This beer is a citric mosaic of excellence paired with yeasty spices, plenty of good carbonation, and a dry, light finish. I could drink this beer all day long! 634 charactersclickpush, Jun 28, 2006

Aroma of orange zest, cloves, even a bit of scrambled eggs and nutmeg.
Taste is big, sweet, and juicy. No sourness as some hefes seem to develop. Zesty up front, smooth, creamy wheat and yeast tones develop before some clove and mild banana in the finish. A bit more estery after the final pour. 
Really nice balance and drinkability here...not boring at any point, but not overwhelming either. 477 charactersshirfan, Jun 27, 2006
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My favorite of the 4 Hefe Weissens that we are sharing today while brewing on a perfect summer day. Tucher, Paulaner, Weihenstephaner bracketed with our homebrewed Hefeweissen "Wheatholio"
Pours a rich golden orange with a white head and lace for the duration. Aroma from the brewpot gives stiff competition to the wonderful 12.7 °P malt so I take the weissen glass around back and stand by the hops to enjoy the ligher nuessances of phenols -4VG and esters that Weihenstephan 68 ale yeast is famous for: bananna, phenol, clove, citrus and apricot.
A standout by virtue of it near perfect balance and sublime esters and phenols.
There is no dissecting this classic - all the parts fit perfectly and give you the pinnacle of the style as far as my tastes. Great beer - most drinkable!
One you will want to comeback to when serving Bavarian 'Weisswurst' - white sausage. 879 characterskarst, Jun 27, 2006

Smell: Bold and upfront estery banana-like nose. The spice is definitely in the background, but way behind the esters.
Taste: Fruity up front, then giving away to the clove-like spiciness in the aftertaste. Rather sweet.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, refreshing and possess a fuller body than anticipated.
Drinkability: Almost too estery and sweet to enjoy more than one. I would sample again, but not a session style beer. 565 charactersrdailey76, Jun 24, 2006

4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I'm torn on this beer, and perhaps I should review it again when I've had more experience with true Hefs... 
On the one hand, it has remarkable complexity, particularly as it warmed. On the other... I was overwhelmed (particularly in during the first 1/3) by the banana notes. And not in a good way.
I was not terribly impressed at first, or perhaps more accurately, I didn't particularly like it, but was impressed by its craft. The more I drank, the more I reconsidered, and towards the end I found the beer exceedingly quaffable.
I love saisons and I enjoy wheat beers in general, but the banana/clove thing turned me off a little, and then intrigued me towards the end. There's no way a beer of this depth of character, beauty, and aroma (and definitely in no way a spoiled bottle) could be rated less than "good" in any of these areas, but there's no way I can in a clear conscious pretend this approached the sublime to my palate.
But I will say, it has inspired me to approach the rest of the German Hefeweizen world with great interest, and I shall certainly be revisiting this beer this summer. 1,115 characterserrantnight, Jun 23, 2006
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours out a slightly hazy yellowish orange with a nice white head.
Smell. good amount of cloves and some bananas, but i also get some apple that is nice. good sweet and clove aromas.
Taste. Dryer than i remember, cloves and banana flavors are at a nice level and have a nice crispness to it with the carbonation to make it extremely refreshing. fruity aftertaste, followed by a spiced and alcoholic taste and feel.
Mouthfeel is good. Beer really fills my mouth, great balance, good amount of carbonation. crisp, yet full.
Overall very good. I still like franziskaner more since it was the beer that got me into craft beer and i have had so much of it, but i can see why this beer is so loved. 696 charactersacrawf6, Jun 23, 2006
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Dirty yellow colour, a few rays of light linger through. Spoongy white head diminishes to a thin covering.
Smell: Noticed the yeast arising from the beer right at the point of impact from the pour. Some clov, a touch of citrus and some spices linger through. Very pleasant.
Taste: Spices hit first, clov and corriander touch the tounge. Heavy level of carbonation. Yeast and citrus round out the beer.
Mouthfeel: As mentioned before the dominate characteristic of this beer's mouthfeel is the carbonation. Yet it quickly smoothes out.
Drinkability and notes: Doesn't seem like it would even have 4% alcohol in it. Light on the tongue and very drinkable. Great in its simplicity with some good flavours and smells. A great beer all around. No wonder this has stuck around. 795 charactersjslot38, Jun 17, 2006

Smell: Yeasty and citric, emitting a kind of tart aroma. Strongly medicinal with a distinct, toasty malt presence. Warming in the nostrils.
Taste: Rich, flavorful maltiness reflecting barley and wheat. A dull, yet refreshing hoppiness that injects a certain mintiness into the beer. Hints of citrus fruit. Finishes with a pleasant sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and strongly carbonated. Sticky and lip-smacking; it really coats the mouth. Very refreshing.
Drinkability: Rich in flavor, and easy to consume. Very impressed with the refreshing qualities of this beer. Fine for a session beer. Excellent for relaxation. 774 charactersclabaugh, Jun 09, 2006

This is by far the best Hefe Weizen I've ever had.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy pale orange yellow color with a big bubbly head. (BTW don't shake this one up (to mix the sediment) or you may explode the beer all over a friends kitchen. (sorry Wayne ;)
Smell: Boy, from the time this beer exploded all over the wall =) it had a fantastic aroma of lemon and wheat with a hint of fresh baked sweet bread. 
Taste: The front of the palate is full of wheat, yeasty lemon citrus, and a nice mildly sweet breadiness. There is a nice gentle bitter that balances this beer perfectly.
Mouthfeel: Oh so smooth, a bit of a nice dry finish.
Drinkability: The most drinkable wheat I have had yet. It is truly German and I highly recommend!
Hope this is helpful.

4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured this into a Pilsner glass, as I did not have a Hefe Weizen glass. Huge white foamy head that started out several inches tall, then slowly dissipated to a thick layer of foam with thick lacing on the glass. The beer is a cloudy, medium dark yellow cloudy color. Lots of tiny bubbles continue refreshing the head.
Aroma was yeasty, with fairly strong notes of cloves and allspice. Very similar to Belgian style ales.
Taste similar to smell, with a definite wheat flavor and some clove spiciness. 
Light bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Clean, crisp finish.
Very drinkable. I can easily imagine this with a dish of spicy curry. 646 charactersdoppelmeup, Jun 09, 2006
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 oz glass into a weizen-style glass.
Hazy pale yellow with a massive large-bubbled white head.
Smelled of cloves, banana and perhaps allspice. Slightly yeasty.
As for the taste: the cloves hit me first, followed by the allspice I sensed in the nose and finally the bananas. I also described it as "musky;" I think that was the yeast. About halfway down I added a small lemon wedge, as I had wanted to sample both with and without the lemon. The addition of the lemon made the remaining foam ring disappear immediately and cut the muskiness, adding - as you'd expect - a more citrusy taste. Despite the old Norm Peterson adage that "the only thing I want floating in my beer is my liver," I actually preferred it with a lemon. 
As for the mouthfeel, I thought it was fizzy, real fizzy, and highly carbonated. That fizziness, combined with the general taste, made the beer finish quite dry and clean.
Drinkable? Oh yeah. Throw in a lemon wedge and this would sure beat the heck out of a lemonade on a hot summer day.
Edit, 8/31/10: Had this again recently, this time without the lemon and some four years after first reviewing this. I'm bumping up the taste score to 4.5 (I'd originally given it a 4), as having had plenty of Hefes over the years, I've come to appreciate this one even more. 1,311 charactersKendo, Jun 08, 2006

Pours a clear golden/orange color with a half inch off-white head.
The smell is nice with bananas and cloves being the most dominant aromas. Also oranges and some other spices as well.
The taste is more subtle than I was expecting. The bananas and cloves are there, as well as the oranges. But there is also a taste of seltzer water in there that seems to dilute the flavors.
There is a seltzer water feel to this beer as well. Not necessarily a fizzy mouthfeel, but very light, and very carbonated.
Drinkability is good. I wouldn't mind having a few of these on a hot day. A good hefeweissen, but not a great one in my opinion. 703 charactersej285701, Jun 08, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Even with a slow, careful pour, this one has a massively uncontrollable chunky white head -- sitting atop hazy gold with slow but persistent, driving carbonation. I don't have a weizen glass yet (I know, I know), but I did the best I could by drinking this out of a 20-ounce straight-sided tumbler. Aromas of over-warm sprouted wheat berries laced with caramelized date sugar and a dash of clove oil. Some grassy and fruity notes appear as well, with dehydrated banana being the most recognizable. In all, a wonderfully complex aroma that has up till now kept me from actually taking a sip while I try to identify what I'm smelling. The first sip is incredibly grainy overall, but a surprising mineral flavor comes out up front. It then cedes to a yeasty bread dough taste that finishes with Golden Delicious apple and slight banana characteristics. In mid-sip I also pick up some plasticky phenols. The mouthfeel is quite substantial -- moreso than I expected at least -- which gives the beer enough heft to be palatable in colder months, even though it's also refreshing enough for a summer beverage. 1,102 charactersorfeu, Jun 08, 2006
3.84/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5As being said, this beer comes from the oldest brewery still producing beer, so they might know something about it... they have a really good reputation... 
And, to say more, the master brewer of Eisenbahn, the best brazilian brewery (and shall i say, probably one of the best of the entire world), was taught there... so, a lot of things can be concluded from that...
I bought 3 different Weihenstephaner's beers at the same time (and drank all the three one following the other). I began by this one, and it's very smooth, very soft, even for the style, specially if you compare with other highlights like Erdinger and so on...
Probably my expectations were too high, but, despite being a nice beer, thought i prefer the erdinger ones... 742 charactersrjlemos, Jun 07, 2006

The smell was clean and refreshing - banana/clove that was present but not overwhelming - with some fruity wheat and a touch of yeast aromas - very inviting.
The taste was banana and lemon with some clove mixed in. As the drink started it was on the sweeter side, but gradually became drier. Fruity wheat and yeast became more noticeable as the drink warmed.
A smooth, creamy, fruity feel was left that lingered for quite some time. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever had - nearly perfect - an excellent example of the style and a very enjoyable brew! 687 charactersjwc215, Jun 04, 2006
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From the standard 12 oz. bottle, slender.
A - light golden, slightly hazy. Head is bright white and sustainable the whole way. Little lacing. Your classic Bavarian wheat appearance.
S - mixture of spices, pepper, allspice, clove. Little bit of spicy hop aroma in there too. Light, toasted wheat, bready.
T - wow, my tongue is excited. All sorts of bright, light spicy and fruity flavors. Clove, spicy banana, allspice, hints of anise. Yum. Mixed in are the firm bready, yeast flavors and toasty wheat. Dry, slightly bitter finish with spicy German noble hop flavors.
M - light, but not what I would call thin bodied. Carbonation is on the high side, per the style. Dry and not sweet.
D - I'm normally not a huge wheat beer fan, but this one is off the charts yummy. Perfect summer brew, light, refreshing. Amazing balance of spicy flavors, malt backbone, and firm bitterness. Make this your first hefe. 917 charactersgbarron, Jun 04, 2006

Smells sweet, and very clean, lots of spice. Taste is perfectly balanced, quite tart, bready characteristics blended with mild spice and fruit. Goes down like butter. Creamy smooth with light carbonation that enhances the flavors and experience of the beer. I keep getting the feeling that this beer has a cleanliness to it. A real treat. 438 charactersseedee17, Jun 04, 2006
4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Slightly cloudy body with a huge creamy head that faded into a blotchy crown atop the body. A tiny bit of random carbonation making its way up from the bottom of the glass.
Spicy cloves and earthy yeast with a little citrus aroma.
Some bananas and light clove spiciness. A little citrusy as well in the finish. Not too bad for a style that I don't exactly love.
Nice amount of carbonation and the beer is really creamy and light-medium bodied. Pretty damn solid here.
A nice refreshing beer after a hard day of pizza delivery. Goes down smooth while still flavorful and it doesn't get mundane either. A solid offering from Weihenstephaner. 651 characterstrep, Jun 04, 2006
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to cmaruschak for the chance to re-visit this one.
Bottle inspection: "3076" screen printed on the back of the label...no idea.
Aroma: Classic clove phenols, a touch of overripe bananas, some peppery spiciness.
Appearance: Cloudy straw colored pour with a foamy and creamy bone white head.
Flavor: A bit of yeasty wheat bread funk, more cloves, a banana/fruity finish.
Mouthfeel: Light with lively carbonation. A crisp and clean finish.
Overall impression: Not my favorite style but a refreshing beer to be sure. A classic example of the style. Definitely recommended. 593 charactersmattcrill, Jun 03, 2006
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hefeweizens are not my favorite style but I know a good one when I drink one.
Mysterious cloudy, almost murky appearance with a thin white covering head.
Aromas of cloves, bananas and a slight citrus hop.
Tastes of wheat, banana, subtle hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel has a wheat grainyness to it. Crisp, refreshing
Very drinkable. If Hefe's are your thing, call this one el jefe. 388 charactersBillyB, Jun 03, 2006
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Poured a cloudy light golden color with a big 2 finger head which quickly fell to a slight film on top of the beer.
S- Heavy citrus aroma with a hint of banana.
T&M- Nice wheat malt taste up front with a large dose of banana and cloves as it is crossing my tongue. This beer is very yeasty and that would explain the banana flavor taking over the beer. Leaves a velvety feeling in my mouth that I haven't found in many other hefeweisen beers.
D- Ths is a very good beer to have on a hot afternoon after work or while sitting by the pool. Considering I live in balmy Florida I believe I will have to keep a 6 pack of this in the fridge on a weekly basis. 665 charactersBRoss242, Jun 03, 2006
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz bottle. Pours a cloudy pale yellowish orange with a fluffy white head. Smell is of banana, yeast, cloves and more banana. Smell is absolutely phenomenal! Taste is much like the smell with clove and bananas with a clean finish. I had some of these on a fishing trip I took over the weekend and they were the best thing I could have asked for on a hot sunny day. This is easily one of the greatest beers in the world in my opinion. Those German's sure know what they are doing! 480 characterscjgator3, Jun 02, 2006
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It was a slow pour, the beer was eager to get out of this bottle. Lotsa head, which was fluffy and white. It sat even with the top of the weizen glass over a slightly cloudy pale gold body. This is a damn sexy looking beer.
What a strong aroma! Fruity, there's bananna and sweet yeast. It's oh so pleasant.
I spent a lot of time looking at and smelling it, so finally I tasted. Theres cloves with a spicy tartness, it mellows to a nice subtle fruitiness. I wouldn't call it bitter, I'd say theres a slight but very pleasant sourness.
It's so light and refreshing, it entices you to drink more. This is the exact right way to relax on a warm evening. I could not turn down another. 689 charactersjoeskirkie, Jun 02, 2006
4.88/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer was purchased at Jungle Jims for $7.99 a six pack. The beer was served in a pub glass.
Appearance: The beer pours a hazy coppery yellow coloration into my glass. The beer has a short lived fluffy white colored head. Rings of lacing remain behind on my glass.
Smell: The beer explodes forth from my glass with a melange of cloves, yeasty bread, citrus and bannanas.
Taste: The beer delivers on the smell. The taste is as expected spicy yeastyness riding a wave of bready citrus and banannas. The hops assert themselves and provide a good earthy cloves taste.
Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This is a light and refreshing beer. The carbonation provides extra drinkability. The beer is well balanced and dam good. I would never turn down a chance to drink this brew. 779 charactersnlmartin, May 28, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This hefeweis is absolutely astonishing. Coming from a brewery that has been around for several several centuries, one would hope that sooner or later they would get it right, and apparently, that brewery has known what it has been doing for quite some time. For starters, the beer is housed in a classically labeled bottle. It pours a nice golden haziness, with the clouds, typical of the style. Sniffs small cloves, banana. This beer tastes fantastic. Again, some cloves, very subtly pronounced malts, banana, wheat (i seriously get the same after-breath from this beer that i get from drinking Bernheim's Original Wheat Whiskey, which i think is cool). This beer, as many have said time and time again, one of the most balanced and well carbonated brews of all time. It's velvety creamy dry finish is more than welcome to a thirsty palate. One could drink this beer for days. And days. And eons. Great Beer. Period. 918 charactersCNeilP09, May 27, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Cloudy yellowish-orange. Large head, which sticks around for quite a long time.
S - Wonderful banana and malt.
T - Citrusy with keen banana at first, slight hops apparent, with a small bitter aftertaste.
M - Carbonated to excellence, which leads to a great mouthfeel.
D - Goes down easy, heavy drinkability.
Very good Hefe, my favorite to be honest, give it a try. 383 charactersHoustonTX, May 27, 2006
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a large German bottle into a tumbler. The beer was light blond colored and hazy with a sticky and clingy head.
It smelled yeasty and sweet, kind of fruity (bananas and citrus). The flavors were mostly spicy and fruity, kind of cloves and bananas. There was a good bready taste also, lots of yeast flavor.
Moderate carbonation and full mouthfeel make this beer feel a little heavy. But it's relatively low alcohol content keeps the drinkability pretty high. 474 charactersTurdFurgison, May 27, 2006
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy light gold color, with a one finger head that slowly falls into a nice blanket over top of the glass. No lacing.
Aroma is positively wheaty, with overtones of clove and spice. Minimal banana aroma. Also, hints of bubblegum are present towards the end of the whiff.
Flavor is very delicate, but enjoyable. Small flavors of banana start out, rounding off to a smooth wheat/bready flavor, and finishing clean. Teasty esters seem to stick to the tongue, and draw out a long refreshing finish. 
Mouthfeel is light and refreshing, due in part to the agressive carbonation. Drinkability is extremely high, especially on a humid night such as tonight.
Although this hefe is incredibly smooth and refreshing, it is not my favorite. A local brewery by me, Legend, produces a hefe that tastes much the same, but has a much larger body. Personally I prefer the Legend beer, but it's only available for a limited time. When it is not available though, this is definitely the hefe I reach for. 
If I only had one word to describe this beer, it would be "refreshingly smooth and round". Yeah, that's 4 words, but it's still one thought. Great beer all around, from one of Germany's finest. 1,202 charactersphisig137, May 26, 2006
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a hazy straw colored hue with four fingers of foamy white head. There was excellent retention and superb sticky lacing.
The smell was full blown hefe. Banana and spicy clove dominated. About half way through a nice mustard aroma developed.
The taste was very spicy as well. There wasn't the super wheaty flavor that I look for in a hefe. This beer was cleaner than most. Very enjoyable nonetheless.
The mouthfeel was light, yet full. Again, more of a wheaty mouthfeel would have been prefered.
A very drinkable and refreshing hefe. An excellent example of the style. Another case of the far superiority of the German example. 644 charactersplaid75, May 25, 2006
4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the .5L bottle to a .5l swirl hefe glass. No other way to serve fits.
Head is a thick, creamy, towering cloud of fluffy white goodness. I would like to watch as is sub sides but the cool yellow cloudy liquid is calling. This is one fin looking brew, one on the best this style has to offer.
Smell is sweet of fruity yeast and spice, finished with the delicate sent of mild hops.
Taste is Oh So refreshing, The taste is of sweet grains mixed with bananas of the perfect hints of spice finished with a hopy bitterness that drys you out just enough to make you long for the next bi swig.
Mouthfeel is fizzy with just the right bite. Full body lacks the perfect creamy smooth touch but excellent never the less.
Drinkability is top. The brew is at home with any meal of as the solo attraction on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Zum Wohl! MK 861 charactersMuenchenerKindl, May 23, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle purchased from Hyvee in Council Bluffs, IA.
No apparent bottled on date.
Poured into a Schell's weizen glass.
Pours an enormous meringue-like head composed of small and medium-sized bubbles. Peering at the body, I notice aggressive streams of carbonation and the cloudy, nearly opaque character that's due to the unfiltered preparation of the beer. Body color is a dull golden away from light, a hazy orange-yellow when held to a point source. This is like peering into a murky sunrise. As the head descends over the course of many minutes (it always retains about one centimeter of foam) it leaves some good lacing along the sides of the glass, which is augmented each time a sip is taken.
Aromas of bananas, coriander, sweet bread, yeast, slight cloves, and a bit of carmelized butternut squash. The strongest aromas are the coriander, bananas, and sweet bread. There's quite a bit going on with the scent, the aroma never seems to dull my senses, and it's a pleasure to swirl and sip this each time.
Tasting the beer reveals excellent banana, apple and pear flavors with noteable bubblegum, clove (phenolic) and lemon attributes mingled alongside them. Aftertaste is of bananas, apples, and bubblegum, pleasurably tart. It would be amazing if they made this with a slightly higher amount of darker malt, or made an additional version with that grain bill, not a dunkel, but somewhere in-between.
Solidly medium-bodied with a slight light or watery feel, the beer has a refreshing combination of thickness from the wheat/malt mix and crispness from the carbonation level. Very smooth initially, but leads to a dry finish that complements the tart aftertaste nicely.
A highly drinkable weissbier and avatar at the style, refreshing in all seasons. 1,760 charactersfalloutsnow, May 20, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I am accustomed to drinking the products of America's Oldest Brewery, so when I saw this six-pack from the World's Oldest Brewery, I just had to do it. Another thing I like, from inspecting the label, is that they still stick to the German Purity Law of 1516.
Pours a cloudy gold, with a white head that erupts from the glass almost immediately; one must pour carefully to prevent overspill. After the pour is complete, it looks like a textbook hefeweizen, weizen glass included.
I always hear about the banana/clove character that arises from Bavarian wheat yeast, but I could never pick up anything resembling banana. I guess I'm just not sensitive to it. But I think I can smell it from this glass, there's not enough for me to be sure. I do get some cloviness, however.
After a few sips, I sense some banana, bubblegum, some tartness, and a twinge of hop bitterness. There's also a little bit of a citrus tone. It all melds together very well.
This hefeweizen is light, easy drinking, and refreshing. A perfect summer refresher. Overall, an excellent beer. These guys have been around since Medieval times, I guess they're doing something right. 1,161 charactersedskirk3, May 12, 2006
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into an Erdinger weissbier glass. Oddly clear for a hefe, gold in colour, much higher carbonation than expected. Big fluffy head, good pour.
Aroma and taste are very familiar, although perfect for the style -- bananas, spices, cloves, and some yeastiness. 
Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel -- the best part of drinking this beer. Minimal aftertaste, very easy to drink.
A great hefe, but to be honest I think my favourite is still local (Denison's is amazing!) 472 characterscrwills, May 11, 2006
4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I poured this out of the bottle into a typical weiss bier glass. It has a light golden color with an excellent foamy head that is retained very well. The aroma is dominated by banana-smelling byproducts produced by the yeast, very inviting. It has a light banana fruity flavor with a hint of malt and almost imperceptible hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy with high carbonation. As the beer warms up a bit, the banana flavor is right out front and the smell is irresistible. Unfortunately, my full glass is empty all too quickly.
This is an outstanding wheat beer and an exceptional example of the hefeweissen style. It has a light, refreshing flavor and wonderful aroma. I first tried this from the cask while on business in Austria. I am pleased this imported bottle is very similar to the experience I remember. 843 charactersscoobybrew, May 11, 2006
4.31/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Overall, this is a terrific beer and one that probably got me hooked on wheat beers in general.
Pours a murky, yellow color with a pillow-like head that is colored white with a frothy texture. Some carbonation is apparent, but hidden by the massive head. Nice rings of lacing are left behind in my oversized wiess glass. Aromas of grains, cloves, tropical fruit, and lemons seem to come out nicely. The taste is just great; well-balanced and flavorful with hints of various tropical fruits. Grain flavors dominate; bread-like texture and taste. Spritzy and refreshing with a hint of lemon/lime cutting through in the finish. Dry and smooth with great depth making this very very easy to drink again and again. 712 charactersjaluria, May 08, 2006

4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours out a cloudy gold with a huge head that seems quite fizzy, but rocky. Goes down to a 1/2" head with lacing down the side. Interestingly enough, the haze was not so much that you couldn't see the strong carbonation. Smell is tart and lemony with an adequate phenolic kick. Grainy, but just the right amount. As I let the aromas linger in my nose, I get a whiff of tart, pulpy tamarind paste. The flavors are full of lemon, banana, and clove, with an aftertaste of orange-pineapple juice. This tastes like some fruit punch. The only problem I see here is that the flavors kind of drop off in the end. Mouthfeel is light, bubbly, fluffy, and doesn't stick to my tongue too much, despite some lingering sweetness. Basically, this feels like liquid marshmallows on my tongue. A lot of people preface the drinkability of weissbier with the current weather conditions (myself included), but this would be highly drinkable in any season. Very hard to keep myself from going through this beer so quickly.
This actually lives up to the hype, unlike some of the stuff BAs go wet over. 1,082 charactersgoochpunch, May 04, 2006

A: Pours into a Weihenstephaner weizen glass with a pale yellow-orange cloudy body and a _very_ thick white foamy head that leaves significant lacing. De rigeur for a hefeweizen, almost perfect for-style.
S: Strong citrus notes, strong orange aroma and a hint of banana. 
T: Similar to aroma, but with less banana and more oranges. Slight astringent aftertaste, probably due to yeast.
M: Moderate and enjoyable, but not a palate-coater the way other hefeweizens tend to be.

4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Easily managed pour although this one requires being gentle, formed a big fluffy, fizzed up head, supported by lots of fine carbonation. Usual unfiltered body, golden with a touch of copper hue towards the core. Inviting is an understatement. Bannana and a delicate soft fruitiness comes alive in the aroma.
Everything except the carbonation in this beer is so delicate, soft and so well put together it could make a man cry. It's been a while since I enjoyed a beer that joined the "elite" class in my rankings but this fits the bill...why? there is a tender clove, bananna taste that makes up the bill but it is backed by some gentle malts that truly give this the backbone that so many miss out on. Lemon makes up the finish and it cleans up remarkably well. It was the opposite of so many american wheat beers that tend to be to grained up. 
Notes: A subtle beer that is easily the best hefe I've laid lips on but also in my book one of the finest offerings for any style. 982 charactersDogFood11, Apr 27, 2006
4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5found on tap @ the peculiar pub right by NYU (bleeker st), I was in the area for work and popped on in for a pint, this place just brings back memories of the ole college days... this is not a style I go for too often but with hot college chicks abounding and nicer weather.. what the hell...
eyes...
frothy white pillowy head, cloudy pale straw haze but completely consistent in the entire glass (the bartender asked me about adding a lemon, I declined to taste this pure, kudos for at least asking!), the lacing and cling are absolutely superb, even hiding in the haze you can see the carbonation feeding the head and keeping it constant - absolutely flawless looking, I tried to find something wrong with this beer, and kept looking at it from different angles, but no, this thing was a goddamn beer postcard sent from beer paradise.
nose...
had a strange toasty smell (not off putting), there are hints of lemon floating and enticing you in the background, there is a subtle spiciness to it with mild fruit notes like bannana... I loved sniffing this thing even if it wasn't crazy complex or fascinating, it smelled great and the smell was strong, you didn't have to work to get at the tones here, there is also some grain prescence, I was impressed.
taste etc.
somewhat full in the mouth, the carbonation rolls around carrying this lovely libation all around your mouth in a surreal fashion. you can literally roll this around on your tongue back and forth to enjoy the sensation of silk/velvet liquid... amazing and flawless in that department. the wheat coats and sticks in the mouth furnishing the strongest aftertaste I think I have come across for a hefe. there are tones of toffee and noogat (you know, that unidentified crap in candy bars), as I rolled it in my mouth I just couldn't get over the complexity of this little heffer, the carbonation even has a little prickly bite to it, very small, which just accents the experience that much more. it is almost lip smacking refreshing but yet has nutty and toasty tones that really grab the attention of your pallette, it is in a sense dry and yet refreshing.. and complex. 
verdict?
I had to run out and grab a bottle of this on the way home.. and the bottle does not do this justice. still great out of a bottle but the mouthfeel is no where near the experience I had this afternoon. This was the best $5 I spent in a long time... this one was nearly flawless, I wish half the hefes I huff where as bad ass as this monster brew, outstanding. 2,520 charactersEgo, Apr 25, 2006

On the way back stopped at the beer delis on Atlantic avenue and stocked up on some quality singles. Figuring this was a good way to reward my toil: the highest rated Hefe on the site.
 Beautiful thick white puffy cloud style head and healthy lacing coat the upper reaches and the body is spot on in color and cloudiness. Banana and clove are where they're suppossed to be smellwise along with some citrus notes and yeastiness. 
 Light in texture and carbonation but taste is full if somewhat muted. Balanced mouthfeel and texture makes this for easy drinking. The taste is clean in finish and very satisfying and refreshing. Quenching is the word that comes to mind. I am now quenched.
 Yeah, I'll be looking for this again this summer although its excellent, its more difficult for me to find than Paulaner and Erdinger, who make very good (and easier to acquire) hefes. 1,030 charactersdaliandragon, Apr 20, 2006

This pours out of the bottle and into the glass a cloudy golden color. There is plenty of foamy white head present. The smell has a nice wheaty-fruity fragerance, with a bit of yeast. The taste is faintly sweet, with nicely balanced citrus undertones. There is a crispness to the after taste. This beer and Paulaner rank as bench marks for a hefe weizen. While not the type of beer to be searched for, it it definitely worth grapping and giving a try, if you see it on the shelf. 544 charactersBadBadger, Apr 18, 2006

Smelled of yeast and citrus and tasted the same. The mouthfeel is hard to describe. The best I could come up with is that the beer felt "juicy" like biting into an orange. I could have several of these at a sitting. Excellent! 312 characterssammy44, Apr 05, 2006

It's very warm and inviting. Tasting this beer, the first thing that comes out is some sweet wheat, then bananas, and then a nice creamy clove flavor at the end. Mouthfeel is well-carbonated yet smooth and very refreshing. This beer is a bit thin on the tongue, but very tasty and easy to drink. Overall, one of the best hefeweizens I've had, but probably not THE best I've had. 472 charactersgeexploitation, Apr 05, 2006

A: Murky as a good hefe should be. Great consistency with lots of yeast shaken from the bottom of the bottle.
S: Even a lot of Bavarian hef's that have the banana and clove's taste to them, don't always have it in the bouquet. This one does, great scent, nice and fresh.
T: Big wheat flavor! The banana and cloves flavoring from the yeast is far from subtle. Everything a great Hefe should be. The consistency was great. By no means watery.
Overall, where it should be, one of the top Hefe's in the world. Mine tasted fresh, but I didn't know how to decipher the date code on back to know for sure. Never can tell with beers coming from overseas. I will definitely be picking up more of these for the warmer months to come, and at $2.50 for a 16.3 oz bottle, how can you go wrong. 850 charactersCallenak, Mar 30, 2006
3.4/5  rDev -22.7%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5 liter bottle from BevMo poured into my frozen Franziskaner weissglas. I smell cloves and bananna as I pour with the bottle inverted. Big frothy head fills the glass to overflow. Let the head settle and swish in the last bit of hefe.
This is not one of my favorite Bavarian hefs when compared to the Paulaner and HackerPschorr masterpieces, but it is very good and drinkable indeed. Bananna, clove, spice, bubblegum flavors appear as the usual characters. It's most unique characteristic was hints of grapefruit and perhaps pineapple. Nothing unlikeable about it, but I think it lacks a bit in mouthfeel compared to others. 626 charactersweizendoc, Mar 28, 2006
3.4/5  rDev -22.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3I have had this beer a few times. After sampling a variety of German Hefeweissens, I am not too partial to this one. 
Pours with a one inch white head that doesn't stay around. Not typical of German Hefies I prefer. The color is a clear golden color with traces of organics floating around. There is no lace to speak of.
The smell hints at banana. Medium mouth feel. Not heavy, but I can detect the alcohol in it. Lots of malt in the taste and a nice after taste. I couldn't drink too many of these... Gotta try the dark wheat they offer soon. 549 charactersSeverum27, Mar 24, 2006
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy, glowing apricot amber capped with a perfect, snowy white head taht leaves behind curls of lacing - A perfect way to break in my new weizen glass, it looks absolutely perfect.
Warm, fruity-spicy notes, almost a belgian-yeast aroma, are present in addition to big bursting swirls of banana and marshmallow. Little to no hops are present - it's a delicious malty, yeasty scent.
Absolute perfection to taste! Banana, apricot, slight clove - sugar, very low hop bitterings.
Crisp, soft, swirling, tasty. The mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated, light to medium body, and finishes with a lovely caramel stickiness.
Final thoughts: About as good as a hefeweizen gets. 684 charactersTupperwolf, Mar 20, 2006

4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My fellow BAs, once again you have provided flawless direction into my beer explorations. I tried this one due to the ratings it received amongst the "hefes" and "weiss beers". As you all were correct about Aventinus... you were also with this one. I am not disappointed by your knowledge and recommendations.
The appearance is good and cloudy like a hefe should be. The smell is very aromatic...hints of wheat and I think a bit citrus-like. The taste is very clean, very nice. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I rate this one high on drinkability because--well--put a hose from the tap and let me sip all day.
 I'm a big Franzikaner fan and I didn't think I'd ever find a beer to rival it. Well, this one does. My fellow BAs if you ever in your life want to try a good "hefe"... I highly recommend this one. My personal favorite of Franziskaner is also a good choice. I have to rate this one as high as my personal fav, though. This is just one great Hefe, in my humble opinion. 982 characterseb003, Mar 12, 2006
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well now, this is a freakin' Hefeweizen! It looks a cloudy straw colour with a head that won't go away. Just like a Weizen should look. In the taste department, it is a little thinner than the Ayinger offering; however, when drinking from a Mass, that's actually a good thing.
A pleasant, simple Weizen. Really top notch. 324 charactersshbobdb, Mar 04, 2006
3.18/5  rDev -27.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Pours a light translucent gold with a massive cloud-like white head. Aroma is yeasty, slightly citrus, and a slightly unfamiliar sourness. Took two pours to empty the bottle.
Taste is light and wheaty, barely sweet. Lots of toast and yeast going on in the flavors, the barest hint of lemon (although served sans), some more fruit and banana emerges as it warms. A slight lingering musty element, may be due to a bottle that's a little older than prime. Not quite as complex as I think it should be, lacks a lot of the strong clovey/peppery/banana flavors expected from a hefe.
Mouthfeel is chewy due to the wheat but not really thick. Has some texture to it. I understand the reputation but I've had some better hefes brewed in the US. (This may just be a fact of life, that this beer/style might not travel well in the slightest.) 837 charactersassurbanipaul, Mar 04, 2006

Appearance- murky yellow/ orange with a huge head. Had to stop pouring wait a bit and continue. Laced heavily and the head lasted to the bottom of the glass.
Smell- Banana bread. Cloves and wheat.
Taste- bananas and cloves. 
Mouthfeel- velvetly smooth. starts off creamy and finishes off mouth and throat warming smooth.
Overall- Wow! This is one damn fine Hefe. The best I've sampled yet. I'll definitely recommend this to friends.

The aroma is classic hefe weizen, cloves, tangy wheat, yeast, bananas, juicy fruit gum and fresh bread. 
The cloves hit with a blast right up front and persist into the aftertaste, but is soon joined by bananas, wheat, light malt, vanilla and bubblegum. 
Medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink and refreshing. One of the better "hefes". Definitely worth a try if you like that style. If you haven't tried it this would be a good start. 552 characterswhynot44, Mar 03, 2006

Smells great....bread dough, clove, yeast and big bubblegum scent.
Taste is mild..clove, bubblegum, sweet malt and a hint of citrusy hop. Really well balanced.
Mouthfeel is very good...light to medium..good carbonation, with a semi-soapy finish. Bubblegum after taste.
Pretty drinkable, although, I would probably be looking for something more intense after a few glasses.
I've tried a few Hefe's now...mostly out of curiosity...did not think I would like this lighter style of beer...but they are growing on me.. and I think this is the best one I've had so far. 678 charactersHautacam, Mar 02, 2006

Wow.
Green bananas, sweet wheat malts, lots of yeast, slight clove spice dominate the nose but not quite as potent smelling as I expected. 
Nice crisp yeasty esters smack the palate and bring a nice spice character up front to follow. Really delicious and a very refreshing beer. Incredibley tastey and smooth. A real treat anytime you crack one open. 587 charactersMatthew, Feb 21, 2006

A: Pours a hazy yellow with a fluffy, one inch head.
S: Wheat smells with a pungent odor of yeast.
T: Sweet malty sourdough bread is the first thing that hits the tongue. Lemons blended into the beer become prominent after a second or two. There is a slight bitter taste that finish well with the beer.
M: Good carbonation, goes down extremely smooth. 
D: Very drinkable for any beer, though I would expect it out of a 5.4%. This is something that I would love to have sitting around.
Notes: Very good. I would think this a good gateway beer for those of us with friends addicted to Bud. No flavor is too strong but the beer is balanced and finishes clean and smooth. 719 characterspbr85, Feb 17, 2006

Colour was orange and murky, with a very stabile head.
Smell was slightly phenolic and clear wheat smell, fresh
Taste slightly banana, cloves, lots of carbonation, fresh, with a dry aftertaste.
Being a classic amongst the Weizen beers, I found this one to be a bit bland, but nevertheless a good beer. 437 charactersAbsumaster, Feb 16, 2006

S - Wheat, bananas, maybe some orange and a little spice. There are other aromas present that I can't pin my finger down on - perhaps it's the yeast. My rookie palate and nose need more exposure to german hefe's.
T - How do I explain the taste? Complex. Sweet, spicy, yeasty, citrusy. I'm not used to all these flavors all at once but it tastes good. I'm used to american variaty but this is a welcome change of pace. I think I detect some clove but I'm not sure.
M - Refreshingly carbonated - feels like a zillion tiny bubbles in my mouth with every sip. Starts smooth, almost creamy I'd say with a crisp/tart finish.
D - This beer was recommended to me by a friend and I think he made a good suggestion! This beer is definitely different from what I am accostomed to drinking but it's very good. I would most definitely buy this again. In 1 word: Refreshing. 1,054 charactersRezzin, Feb 16, 2006

Smell; really nice yeasty smell with a slightly over ripe bananas. There's a bit of lemony citrus going on as well as some cloves.
Taste; wheat and yeast stand out along with the bananas, there's also some of that citric lemon and cloves. It has a bit of a spicy hoppiness in the finishand just a bit on the dry side.

Dirty-yellow hue which is perfect for a heffe-weisse. The appearance is moderately cloudy, about average for a weissbier. Nice profusely-rising small carbonation bubbles that just keep coming and coming.
S= The nose is very nice-- almost a rose-bouquet scent to it. The flavor matches. I have to wonder if maybe there's some rose-hips added in the formula.
T= Taste-- even the head is delightful to slurp. The beer is a nice modestly-carbonated mix of floral, fruits, mild honey, clove, all sorts of things going on here to keep one busy. I do get a strong bubblegum-aftertaste. In fact, my first impression was that it tasted like gun-poweder until my tastebuds began to focus.
M= Clean. Occasional bubblegum. Sometimes a slightly saccharine-sweet taste depending on what you've been eating.
Drinkabiliby-- til the cows come home or until you decide to switch to something darker and fuller to finish the evening. This is a noteably fine beer, with an exceptionally up-front surprising taste to it. 1,099 characterstherica, Feb 11, 2006

Prominent wheat taste, very sweet. Noticeable banana and slight taste of bubblegum present. No bitterness to be found. Minimal carbonation that decreased as beer warmed. Very creamy mouthfeel.

A- This beer has a slightly hazy straw yellow body with a dense carbonation of tiny bubbles. The head is a snow white creamy foam that last and last. As it rises about the rim it holds its shape. 
S- Very nice fruity notes with hints of banana and a nice smooth slightly sweet wheat aroma. There is a faint bread note but no bubblegum or clove aroma. 
T- This beer has a nice soft wheat flavor with some bright notes of lemon which is complemented by a subtle banana flavor. The finish has a very faint noble hop, dry finish. There is a very faint carbonic bite but it enhances the finish. 
M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a creamy texture. There is no real fizz taste in the mouthfeel but I'm sure it is in the creamy texture. 
D- This beer has good complexity but it is very soft. No bubblegum and the banana is secondary not the main player. It is a well-built beer and I'm sure lots of years went into getting it just right. 979 charactersrhoadsrage, Feb 05, 2006

Pours a hazy pale straw with a generous white head that fades and leaves plenty of fluffy lace and fades to a flat pancake of foam that never quite goes away entirely.
Smell is faint yeast and floral hop notes with a doughy cracked wheat scent.
Taste is clean and light with wheat malt evident and less fruit than any hefe's that I have tried. Just clean and light and balanced.
Mouth feel is light with abundant tingly carbonation.
All in all a very drinkable brew. 650 charactersCitadel82, Feb 04, 2006

Fruity banana scent with yeast and wheat underneath. Mouth watering.
Extremely refreshing taste. Light bodied and the epitome of well-balanced. Fruity and mild.
Light, easy mouthfeel. The head retention makes for an interesting carbonated experience.
A great-for-anytime beer. Pretty much a flagship beer for how a hefe weizen should be. I bet this is even more amazing in the summer. 602 characterschOAKbarrell, Feb 02, 2006

This time no problems at all. Anyway, now that I can appreciate it for its taste and not for it causing a rash I am delited to say that this is a very tasty beer. Poured out a burned orange/ yellow. it quickly filled half my glass with foam and I only got half the bottle in. After the pilowy foam calmed down the taste of sweet wurt, clove, wheat, and tart hops hit my tounge. The mouthfeel has just the right amount of carbonation and is smooth. A very clean crisp beer. Its very easy to drink when its very cold, the warmer it got the more bitter it became with hops coming through. It's sure nice to know I can still drink this beer with confidence. 749 charactersToggleEyes, Feb 01, 2006

I won´t really elaborate much on describing what it is like. 
It was pleasant and tasteful, however not my favourite weizen. the flavour was a bit too mild for my taste (lurking ever more into the belgian strengths). but that made it also very desirable to consume. it also allows for a bit more elaborate tasting, and the complexity that is more subtle is still abundant.
very nice beer all-in-all, although not the mother of all weizens for me. 583 charactersAndreji, Jan 16, 2006

Very thick, foamy white two finger head lasted nearly two minutes before falling to moderate lacing. Smells sweetly of bread, citrus, hints of spices, clove. Tastes very similar to the smell, although more complex. Taste has more of a finshing citrus/ lemon rind bite at the end, although is not in the least bit bitter. Moderately carbonated, this is easily one of the best examples of a hefe weizen I have had the pleasure of sampling this weekend, or ever for that matter. Mouthfeel starts carbonated that quickly changes to smooth and creamy. Very drinkable, less spiced than the other hefes I've had here recently. 676 charactersdanielocean03, Jan 16, 2006

I believe this is the first "5" I've given in the appearance category. Simply awesome. Unrelenting head, upwards of 1 inch, deep gold color, radiant.
Very earthy, musty beer. Slight lemon zest with interesting hop body. Extremely clean on the palate, very smooth.

Strong flavors ... sweet malt backbone with a heavy dose of clove and corriander, banana, touch of phenols, licorice, and lemon at the end. Makes use of every bit of the 5.4% ABV.

Wonderful aroma, a crisp refreshing flavor with great complexities, amazing that water yeast and wheat can yield so much to enjoy.

4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It's the best wheat beer in the world, IMO. Totally crisp, clean - about as perfect as I could ever hope out of a hefe. 
Pours a golden orange color with a thick head. Smells of malts, citrus, and cloves. Tastes about like it smells - carbonation is pretty intense, but in a good way. Slight lemon sensation. 
Incredibly refreshing. Even a slight bit of hops in there. A truly great beer. 394 charactersLnedrive14, Dec 31, 2005

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a pint glass.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange color with about a two finger creamy head.
Smell: Smells of yeast, banana and a slight clove.
Taste: There are many different tastes present. Yeast, Banana, Cloves and Malt. This beer is very balanced. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth Mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation. Very nice ending flavor.
Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could easily have a few of these in a sitting. 
This is a great example of the Hefe Wiezen. This beer is very tasty and I will be picking up more of this for sure!!! Great work by Weihenstephaner and I am sure that this is one great brew since this brewery has been brewing since 1040 A.D. 714 charactersbahumutx, Dec 29, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: Half-litre, tall transitioned neck brown glass bottle that holds 16.9 fluid ounces for Uncle Sam. Logod crown cap with a generic Weihenstephaner main and neck labels. Listed at alc. 5,4% vol. Reverse label has the Code 3285 if that means anything.
Appearance: Low level turbidity glosses the clear golden straw body with a murky orange tinge. Fast rising head forms from out of the milky upper head and creates a 2 thick polystyrene plug in my straight sided glass. Average conditioning seems to go to great lengths to support the expanded white colored head. Minimal lacing but this looks great in the glass.
Nose: Archetypal aromas exhibit all that is great about the classic Teutonic Hefes. Fruity bananas and a yeasty clove dominate but the odors are more complex with added yeasts and some dough.
Taste: Lots of banana and clove are to be expected but what continually surprises is the clean unfettered profile that this Hefe presents. Touches of spices, yeasts, dough and a fantastic malty presence. Its all here and balanced in one of those brews that is a perfect marriage. 
Mouthfeel: With its fine tuned soft conditioning, this is oh-so good in the mouth, on the tongue and cheeks. Long after the swallow it leaves a soft soothing feel with a spritzy remnant of the carbonation. Lemony black peppers tingle in the back end. Great feel and a concrete body.
Drinkability: One of those great brews that just exhibits a terrific palate, one that is extremely hard to critique but just way too fucking easy to pound.
Overall: As good as it gets. I really cannot believe that I never ever reviewed this definitive Hefe, maybe I did in a drunken haze and it got deleted.who knows?! I returned to a serious classic tonight though, a thoroughly enjoyable reunion, well be meeting up again on a regular basis for sure to catch up for old times sake. Superb!!

The bead is lively and dances and is easily seen in the murky orange beer.
The head is cloudy white and laces right to the end of the glass.
The smell is phenolic/yeast.
The flavour is all of cloves apples nutmeg and phenols.
The tartness and wild carbonation along with the mix of fruit and spices makes this a great experience.It isnt a drink all day beer but one to be savoured . 481 charactersjarmby1711, Dec 20, 2005

Mouthfeel: For the type, the mouthfeel was perfect. Smooth but not watery.

The smell is aromatic orange, lemon zest, grass, hay, summertime in a bottle. The taste of this beer is so smooth it goes down so easy, lemon, grassy notes, with some subtle orange sweetness lingers on the palate in the finish. This is a simple hefe that just satisfies the tounge with fresh malty sweetness. 390 charactersFranchise, Dec 18, 2005

Smell is of vanilla, crisp wheat, lemony citrus, and just a hint of banana.
Taste is of the same aromas.
Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, soft on the palate with a citrus sugar and sourness that is superb for the style.
Drinkabily-IMO, the best Weizen yeast out there. Love this beer. 394 charactersweeare138, Dec 16, 2005

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in the brewery's own Weihenstephan Hefeweissbier glass at just over fridge temperature. Freshness code reads 3285 on the rear label. 16.9 oz. 
Appearance- Perfection. The beer glows a cloudy orange with streaming action inside the glass... it takes a few minutes to pour because of the resilience of its gigantic, soapy head. The sheer beauty of this rivals the exquisite presence of Duvel in its own tulip glass, on a perfect pour. 
Smell- Even cold, the bananas and cloves leap out of the glass... and a thick, yeasty aroma blankets the nose. Bold and powerful, there is no mistaking the superb craftsmanship that awaits.
Taste- Full and round, the bready notes of the yeast intertwine with the banana-like esters and malts, as the dense wheat character rides alongside. A gentle sweetness is left behind in the finish. 
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Prickly and alive in the mouth, with just the right fortitude in the swallow. Medium weight and certainly not wimpy. This drinks so well by itself in the middle of winter, but memories of this by the barbecue in the summer sun with sausage and pepper sandwiches are too much for my brain right now. IMO, the finest Hefe out there. 1,196 charactersyelterdow, Dec 06, 2005
4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into my weihenstephan weissbier glass and it looks picture perfect, foggy yellow with pillowy white head. The head was over 3inches upon pouring, minutes later, it is down to about an inch and ready to enjoy.
Smells of heavy yeasts, bananas. Tastes of clove, bananas, yeasts and a little bit of citrus on the finish.
Not many surprises there, I know. But this is the standard for hefeweizens.
I'm actually not a big fan of the wheat beers, but every time I open one of these, I'm glad I did. 507 charactersBitterBrian, Dec 03, 2005

Smell: Holy crap. Sweetness. Cloves, bananas, breads....
Taste: Wow, this is some tasty brew. Bananas, cloves, breadiness, citrus rhinds. Very refreshing, this is a great lawnmower beer. This is a thirst quencher for sure.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and almost creamy, if thats possible for a beer this fizzy. Dry citrus finish that begs you to take another sip.
I love this beer, but its sweetness comes off a bit strong after 2 or 3 of these, so I must temper my rating a tad. 541 characterswingnutter, Dec 03, 2005
4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured a small, dense, brilliant white colored head that faded slowly to a thin film. Clear, glowing straw colored beer with a few bubbles rising gently through the middle. Hints of floral hops and yeast, lemon zest, and dash of white pepper waft from the glass. Refreshingly crisp mouthfeel goes well with the fresh flavors. Hops are mildly spicey up front and meld well with the wheat base. Yeast flavors are subdued along with a bit of lemon zest. Finish is more of a hop tea astringency then bitterness. The flavors and aromas are mild, but plentiful and enjoyable. 569 charactersHappyHourHero, Nov 30, 2005

Perfect hazy light brown with a long lasting white head. Smell is spicy, mildly fruity, with a great yeastiness. Taste is refreshing to the max. Sweet wheaty malt starts things off. It blends well with some spicy clove and lemony tartness. Very yeasty. Mouthfeel is creamy and airy. Carbonation holds up until the very end. I could drink this all day, winter or summer. In the top three hefe weizens in the world. 517 charactersPatYoda, Nov 24, 2005
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This very refreshing and bubbly beer smells very wheaty and white bready, just like a weissbeer should. The color is golden, and the cloudiness makes it look like honey. It pours with good foam and leaves a nice lacing. The silky taste is of wheat (obviously), not too sweet and with hops in the aftertaste. It's very dry and there is a sour note wrestling with the hops. It's good for us Swedes that it's included in Systembolaget's standard selection, and thus available almost anywhere in the country. 504 charactersJanM, Nov 23, 2005

Tasted much like the fine smell with a very smooth mouthfeel.
Overall this is a very well crafted beer, maybe just a touch too sweet for my taste but hard to find fault with really. 405 charactersJohnfromDublin, Nov 21, 2005

smells heavenly. spicy banana bread. those 3 words are inadequate though, this is complex, so much going on. it smells sweet but not overly malty.
breathtaking flavor. it's so smooth and creamy, delightfully flavorful with a dry finish. delicious, balanced, and at 5% i could drink this all night. it gets a rare 5 from me for drinkability.... damn i only have 1 bottle. i plan on getting more of this jesus juice. 647 charactersdavidchollar, Nov 12, 2005

4.46/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Drinking this extremely quaffable brew, I'm reminded of that SNL skit featuring Will Ferrell, as he sits in the hottub at the Welshly Arms Hotel. "Methinks it was the finest love making the world had ever known!" Why, ye may ask? Because this is the finest Hefe my palate has ever known. But as usual, I digress. 
Poured this proper-style into my Weisse glass, and it's sexy as hell. Hazy sunrise golden, with giant bubbles quickly making the long trek to the top of this glass. Initial size of the head is an enormous pillowy white, which slowly recedes yet constantly has a solid half-inch throughout. Amazing retention. Impressive looking beer. 
Sweet, candy-like estery aromas, standard notes of clove and subtle lemon. Despite the appearance of heavy carbonation, this hits the mouth rather thick, coating it completely, with just a tingle of carbonation in the finish. Sweet mother of Bavaria, that's nice. 
Very nicely balanced flavor and remains extremely complex. Tangerine and clementine citrus flavors up front, rich and malty with a bubblegum sweetness...the spicy clove is mild yet lingers throughout. Chalky hop bitterness with lush floral notes towards the end. By far, the cream of the crop for this style that I've had the pleasure of sampling. 1,270 charactersIrishRedRock, Nov 02, 2005
5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, my first 5. and mostly because this is hands down the best hefe I've ever had. Damn.
Pours yellow orange below a peerfect fluffy head.
Smell is a spicy banana clove yeastiness that literally permeates the entire room. Simply amazing.
Yeasty flavor, huge clove flavor. Esters, grass and fruit to boot. This goes above and beyond.
Chewy yeastiness adds alot of body to this brew, but it remains light and delicious overall.
Extraordinarily drinkable any time of year. Refreshing when its warm out, spicy and fulfilling in the cold. I give it a five based on the fact that it literally takes this style to another level. Sure, if given the choice of only this or Arrogant Bastard for the rest of my life, I'd choose the arrogance, but this is one fine, well crafted brew.

3.5/5  rDev -20.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Dense, espreso-esque 1" foam; bright white head that settles to a creamy sheet after a few moments. Two toned in color: deep, dark camel and hazy dark straw. Spotted patches of lace. 
Moderate malted oat sweetness; a hint of lemon zest with a toch of diacetyl. Some pepper added to the primary, lightly sweetened grain aroma.
An initial burst of clean citric flavor accompanied by a mildly sweet toasted oat and malt character. Along with a wave of carbonation is a hint of pepper giving this hefe a touch of spice to balance its sweetness. The aftertaste brings to mind sour lemons.
Light bodied; balanced in terms of sweet & mellow and peppered-spice; but, flavorwise, ais a bit out of synch.
A sweeter and more mellow take on the style. Not one I'd go searching for, but not too shabby. 801 charactersNEhophead, Oct 25, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Weihenstephaner is my favorite imported German Weissbier. 
The color is a beautiful golden orange and the foggy yeast looks bright white instead of just dirty. It also holds a decent head for a while. 
Smells like half and half, plums. bananas and wheat. Im drooling already. I noticed a lot of variation even between bottles in a six pack with this beer, which is unfortunate. This one is right on. 
Flavors creamy and smooth. Good wheat flavor, but the sweetness blended with the citrus really steals the show. Almost wholesome to the point of my mouth not recognizing it as a beer. This is making me miss my military career in Germany. 
Mouth feel is a little too carbonated for the thickness of the beer. Thats about the only miss here. 
Weihenstephaner is my go to wietzen, but I must reiterate that I found a terrible inconsistency in the freshness of this beer. If youre not impressed with the bottle in front of you, try another. This is a sad state of affairs, but the pay off of a perfect Hefe is well worth it. Good luck! 1,055 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Oct 22, 2005

4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Yea, yea, clove... and bananna, ...and bubblegum... we've heard all of the common attributes that make good Hefeweizens great. But what makes this one different?
A fantastic pour brings a color that rides the line between strong straw and golden. Light rust seems to fit the bill. Very froathy and moussey with head formation and retention. The appearance promises maltiness and creaminess.
Moderate aromas of estery banannas, apples, and peaches lead the way with several phenolic note following closely behind; mostly clove, white pepper, and orange zest.
The fruity, spicy notes in the aroma give a lot of valor to the taste. A strong bready flavor of shortbread, wheat, rye, and barley make for a complex and varying taste. Again, the banannas, clove, corriander, apples, pepper,....(the list can go on and on.) give a lot of varying complexity to the brew. I get a new description in every sip.
The body is a great blend of creamy and drinkability. Initial full, rich, and expanding textures expand wonderfully in the mouth, but subside just in time to allow the beverage to lighten and flow effortlessly into the finish. A great Summertime refresher with a cooling, minty finish.
Ultimately the beer shows a unique balance of bananna esters, clovey phenols, and with a bubblegum (confectionate) sweetness that never allows any one aspect to dominate; but rather come together in a harmonious blend. No other beer does this much flavor with such sensible proportions-- this is why the beer rates among the best! 1,521 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 17, 2005

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cloudy straw yellow with a hint of caramel colour topped by a big, fluffy, bright white head. Great retention and the head sticks to the glass quite nicely. Plenty of cloves in the aroma, backed up by banana fruitiness. Mellow breadiness is in there as well, but the phenolic character is what really shines through. Bubblegum flavour with some malty sweetness start things off, lemon and light vanilla show up part way through. Cloves and phenolic spice round out the end and carry into the finish, along with mellow sweetness. The carbonation is lighter than expected, but is still crisp at the finish. Light body too, and the texture is quite creamy. Very enjoyable with lots of classic hefe character, this is an easy drinking beer that I'll be looking for again. 767 charactersDrJay, Oct 15, 2005
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5One of the quintessential hefeweissbiers, this golden, cloudy beauty presented before me, in its appropriate glass, with a thick, pillowy white head. The aromas were straight and too the point with some light biscuity goodness, banana and clove action all throughout. The flavor smoothly followed suit with a slightly palate-cleansing yet very smooth feel on the palate. 
Perhaps the best on the market today, import or domestic. Seek and ye shall find...

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sheesh! I like Hefeweizens, and this is really very good! 
Huge rocky white head, with sticky lacing over a cloudy orange body with very fine bubbles. 
Lots of complexity in the aroma, with plenty of clove and peppery spicyness and a hint of citrus behind a malted wheat warmth. Not as much banana ester as I expected, not like a Hacker-Pschorr H-W, but very slightly there.
This has a heavier "richer" flavor than most H-W's, with a bit more malt and sweetness than I expected. Very pleasant and lots of clove. Long warm finish, with a dry even slightly bitter after-note. Quite pleasant and surprising.
Mouthfeel is also a bit thicker and rounder than most H-W's I've had. That accounts for the huge head and sticky lacing. 
Very drinkable. Goes down easy, and not overmuch carbonation. Could drink several, but it's late already.
Overall, very good, but certainly not as heavenly as the Andechs H-W available at the monastery -- but then I suppose this also is better on tap at the brewery than out of the bottle I opened 20 minutes ago. Oh, to go back to Bavaria! 1,073 charactersColoradoBobs, Oct 08, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a cloudy straw pale orange hue with a colossal fluffy white head.... absolutely what I want a hefe to look like.
Smells of barley, yeast, grain, with a touch of sweet bubble gum and a hefty dose of banana. Nice.
Light, crisp with a touch of citrus and banana. So refreshing. So good. As I said... exactly what I want out of a hefe. Exemplary.
The mouthfeel is tight and carbonated... feels very light in the mouth... very crisp... very summery.
What is there to say.... this beer is near perfect in every category. The only reason I don't give it all 5's is becauce I've had Live Oak's Hefe, which I think gives this a run for its money... a bit more complex IMO. But you simply cannot go wrong with this beer.... extremely affordable for the quality you get. 777 charactersnickss, Oct 08, 2005

Light, easy drinking, hazy cloudy beer goodness.
A top 100 beer? I dunno.

3.8/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Another great Hefe, bought from Dan Murphy's. Had this with Teaser today.
Poured a vibrant cloudy orange hue into the glass, with a thick white rocky head. Yeast was stirred up in the bottle and poured in to, where it hung in suspension just below the head. Foam lacing on the glass.
Aroma: Bananas, clove, vanilla and apricots, followed by a whiff of spicey wheat malt, and no real hop to talk of.
Taste: Clean crisp malt and fruit in the mouth. Banana and spice, very full and wheaty/bready. Good carbonation, finishes dry and wheaty. Not as good as Erdinger IMHO, but a great Hefe all the same. 606 charactersrevdrjbob, Sep 27, 2005

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Gorgeous thick and foamy head, hazy straw and golden yellow and dark. Foamy lacing billowing around the top of the glass.
Smell: Banana, clove, cream, malt sweetness. One of the best for sure. Faint alcohol and vanilla come through too.
Taste: Apple skin? It's there. Banana, cloves, cream, spices. Some citrus zest in there, also. Stellar in its attempt.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, but not to the point where it makes you feel like you shouldn't drink another. Carbonation almost seems like a bit much at first, but the head stays on, so it's a bit due to that, and it mixes with the creamy and certainly medium to full-bodied mouthfeel, giving it a pretty fantasic ride overall.
Drinkability: Make it a session if you want, but this is a great beer, for summer, for the singular glass, for the sharing glass, for the disbeliever... 849 charactersasabreed, Sep 23, 2005
4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My favorite (readily available) hefe without a doubt. 
Typical cloudy Hefe in appearance, but still opaque enough to see cleanly through. Solid head forms that's just the right size without having to only pour half the bottle and leave it to settle.
When cooler the beer has a VERY clean banana scent but as it warms the clove smell and taste takes over. Has a nice, sweet finish that gains dept as it warms
I could drink these all night. Pairs very well with a vanilla dessert actually! 490 charactersDomingo, Sep 12, 2005
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer has a very cloudy yellow appearance with a big white head. Fruity orange and lemon aroma with clove. The flavor starts out sweet and malty. Fruit comes in and flavor becomes drier. Notes of vanilla in the finish. There is not very much hop flavor. Full mouthfeel. Carbonation is high. Great flavor and a thirst quencher as well. 338 charactersbeveragecaptain, Sep 11, 2005
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5presentation: 12oz. bottle with the typical graphics on the label. weihenstephaner crosses the bottle with the shield above and "premium bavaricum" across the top. "the world's oldest brewery" is printed. "brewed undet the purity law of 1516" is also displayed. abv is 5.4%. a blue bar on the back of the bottle shows the printed number: 5464. maybe a batch code or importation code.
appearance: hazy golden orange that doesn't vary much from highlights to shadow. poured in a pint glass. head is a good 2 inches and is fairly bright white with a pancake batter-like top. drops to a cap after a few minutes. lacing is pretty good. there are some yeast floaties.
smell: spicy cloves and maybe some corriander. there is some citrus and wheat and there is a strong banana aroma.
taste: initial taste is dominant banana. there is also an apple flavor countering nicely, but mostly bananas. lightly clove spicy with very little hop bitters. finishes a touch dry with a banana bread finish and aftertaste. the bananas do calm down after a while, though. 
mouthfeel: crisp and clean with good carbonation. light body and rolls around velvetly smooth in your mouth. swallows smoothly as well. 
drinkability: extra drinkable. tasty and super smooth. alcohol doesn't show up on the radar. i could easily have another.
overall: a very tasty aromatic hefe weisen. weihenstephaner makes some of the smoothest, easiest to drink beers i've ever had. this one is much the same. highly recommended. 1,499 charactersPx2GrafX, Sep 11, 2005

Great aroma of wheat, spice, lemon and sweetness. Amazing tasting hefe. So complex, yet extremely refreshing and easy to drink. Spice, lemon, good amount of hop bitterness, sweetness from malted wheat and a dry and clean finish. Overall, probably the best hefe I've ever had. 389 charactersbaiser, Sep 09, 2005
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy bright apple juice color with a white head that dissipated with evident carb action.
Has a sweet grainy wheat malt smell with a pine and lemon/lime hops aroma.
Moderately sweet and acidic grainy malt taste with hints of straw/hay also has a lemon/orange and some resin in the hops flavor.
Light bodied, dry and even maybe slightly bland texture, soft and lively carbonation, and a smooth almost lightly metallic and astringent finish.
Very easy to drink I'm finishing the bottle as I write this, no lemon needed, and the acidic balance may be slightly off. 581 charactersTroyone, Sep 05, 2005
4.23/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A thick, creamy, white head forms at the top of the tall wheat glass on top of a beer that is yellow gold. It is much darker at the top than the bottom of the glass. It is very hazy with thick streams of carbonation rising up the glass. The aroma is mostly cloves with a fruity sweetness in the background. The taste begins with clove and fades to a sweet fruity banana flavor as it sits on your tongue. On the swallow, the cloves rush back and fill in the aftertaste. This is a fantastic beer, which is the pinnacle of the style. I found myself disliking this beer and style the first time I had it, but it has grown on me to the point where I really enjoy it. It is a very quenching and satisfying beer. 705 charactersHagbard, Sep 02, 2005

4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Hazy golden yellow with an awesome densly fluffy white head. Smell is of wheaty malts, lightly sweet - a very nice hefe weizen aroma. Taste is terriffic. Well balanced - yeasty, not too bitter. This German beer seems to highlight everything wrong about "imitations" or other hefe weizens brewed by respectable American brewers. Not to say that we can't brew a decent hefe weizen - this just seems like the ideal model. The flavors and aromas of this beer are so well balanced - mild, sweet banana and a clean, perfect maltiness. Nicely flavored and not overdone. Medium bodied yet refreshing with a light carbonated finish. Soft and dry - very easy to drink, but it never seems lacking. 
By far the best hefe weizen I have ever had. Highly recommended. 755 characterswedge, Aug 24, 2005
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The beer is hazy orange-gold with a sick head. Really thick and floaty, creamy in color, and about 1.5 inches. It looks amazing like I would expect the world's first Hefeweissbier too. Smells full of wheaty malts, yeast, and light spicey citrus. Tastes ultra refreshing. Wheat malts, with spicey citrus overtones, and a nice crisp carbonation. Dryness increases as carbonation decreases, finishing with lemon/orange peel and sweet spices. Nice complex mouthfeel, and very very drinkable. Practically inhale-able.
I really recommend this, epsecially in the Summer. 564 characterstastybeer, Aug 22, 2005
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hefeweizen is not my favorite style in the world, but for the style this is how the beer ranks.
Pours a nice gold with a big white frothy head that holds its own, as a wheat should.
Cloves seem to dominate the banana in the aroma but there is a light bready banana underneath.
Nice wheat bready twang with little to no hop flavor or bitterness to follow. Not sweet either, but quite malty. Banana and spicy clove interplays, finishes sweet on the exhale. Yeast character is the highlight of this beer, subtle and indescribable.
A delightful medium bodied beer with smooth carbonation.
I would not mind drinking this on hot days at all. 650 charactersbeersarang, Aug 15, 2005
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presented in a 500ml brown bottle with the classic German label. Poured into a pilsner glass, since there was a tragedy involved with my good weizen glass last time I bought one of these (sniff). Body is a vibrant golden hue with a sizeable stark white head. Lots of carbonation in the form of pretty big, coca-cola sized bubbles. Crisp, clean nose of light German hops, tantalizing yeast, and a touch of malt. Palate is much the same - clean yeast, light hops, and just enough maltiness to add some balance. Some tanginess from the hops emerges mid-palate and mellows into a nice, slightly hoppy dry finish. Brilliant in its simplicity, this is a well-built beer. Nice mouthfeel - medium body, highly carbonated but not foamy. I could drink this all day, every day. 766 charactersElGordo, Aug 13, 2005

Nice bubbles churn through the liquid. The nose is full on banana and clove. Not too sweet. Just a touch of wheat hiding behind it. Very nice. The flavor is a symphony for my taste-buds. Banana, cream, clove, wheat. All balanced and nothing over-riding anything else. As good a hefe as can be found. The feel is moderate to thick with a light to moderate carbonation. A fantastic hefe. Hands down this is a winner. I need to drink it more often. 538 characterskmpitz2, Aug 11, 2005
4.83/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Man, I had heard quite a lot of positive word about this beer, and this is definitely a case where a product lives up to it's hype. The Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is truly a world-class beer, one of the standard-bearers of the Hefeweizen style. 
The appearance was outstanding. The Weissbier poured with a massive, creamy head of foam that was so tightly compacted that it resembled whipped cream. The body of the beer itself was a cloudy orange, dense and bubbly.
The taste was sublime. Citrus notes and a smooth banana taste dominated the palate, with hints of clove and/or alspice keeping things interesting in the background. Incredibly tasty. Perfectly balanced.
Great mouthfeel, full-bodied. EXCEPTIONAL drinkability. I could drink these all summer long. I was longing for another as soon as I had quaffed the first one.
Makes a good pair with lighter chicken and/or seafood dishes. I wouldn't be scared to try it with white-sauced pasta dishes, either. Fantastic summertime brew, it's a classic all the way around. Don't pass it up. 1,054 charactersDubblebock, Aug 02, 2005

S- strong grainy, fruity smell. banana dominates overall.
T- lots of orange, banana and citrus flavor. 
M- medium body with a good amount of carbonation. even with the carbonation it is extremely smooth and silky.
D- very high drinkability for me. the well balanced taste and smooth mouthfeel makes it a winner in this catagory.
overall- definitely one of the best hefe's ive tried. It would be tough to top this, only disapointment i had was with the lack of head retention. im a little past the best by date on the back maybe that could account for this? eitherway its a hit in my book 781 charactersGritsak, Aug 01, 2005

Incredibly full malty wheat flavor, with the classic hefe backup of banana and hints of pear and apple. Lots of yeast creates a creamy and slightly chalky character. Incredibly drinkable too, to the point that it goes down like water or soda. Absolutely the classic hefeweizen, and fully deserving of its history and reputation. World class. 432 charactersthechaacster, Jul 30, 2005

Taste, crisp and smooth all in one. Thick and creamy fruity, clovey flavours dominate. Estery but not overly sweet, some lasting dryness on the finish, no hop bitterness

4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Undated 16.9oz poured into a weizen. Lot #4215 on the bottom of the back label.
Hazy straw yellow with a white head that is tall, sticks to the glass leaving good lace, and settles down to about 1cm or so.
The nose is a wonderful balance of strong clove and wheat aromas. Spicy with some banana and honey in the back. Also a bit chalky. WOW! 
The taste starts off malty but then quickly changes to some clove, some bite from the carbonation, then a biscuity finish with some suggestion of bitter hop. The yeast gives it an almost bready character. 
Nice malty body that works well with the active carbonation. Great session beer during these never ending dog days of summer. 686 charactersypsifly, Jul 26, 2005

Nose is tasty bananas and yeast, glorious yeast. This is the gold standard for German Hefe, yum yum, soft balanced, fruity, tons of bananas and yeast notes. Easy drinking, crowd pleaser, give me some salad, cheese, bread and a glass of this fine brew and I will be a smiling!

4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Stellar weissbier beer from "The World's Oldest Brewery"
Appearance: Muddy gold; Uneven rocky head (nice)
Smell: Good banana/apricot and clove mixed with a nice hop aroma. 
Taste: This beer seems to be all about the yeast. There is a definite malt complexity to this beer, coupled with a smooth and silky wheat texture, but the fruitiness of whatever yeast strain is being used really shines. Nice job guys. 
Mouthfeel: Nicely balanced weiss beer, through and through. The brewers really want the gardens of Bavaria to linger on the palette with this one. It rides a fine line between chewy and thin. 
Drinkability: After about 5 sips it becomes evident how special this beer is: not too banana-y, not to clove-y, not too strong, not too weak. Most of all the yeast used in this beer must be a top secret formula -- it just lends such a character to the brew. Crazy good! 878 charactersRedBaron, Jul 20, 2005

Initial taste starts out with warm yeasts, grains, malt, banana esters, citrus and a touch of cloves. Medium body and just-right carbonation. As the taste fades, one is left with a clean palate and the memory of toasted malt, bitter hops, yeast, hazelnuts, anise and ethanol. The benchmark for wheat beer from the worlds oldest brewery. 456 characterspalliko, Jul 17, 2005
3.65/5  rDev -17%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5First of all, its pretty cool to be able to boast on the label of your beer that youre The Worlds Oldest Brewery. And its pretty cool to have your own brewing university and proprietary yeast strain. And its also pretty neat to actually need to qualify your origins with an A.D. on it, as in, since 1040 A.D. And its also pretty cool that your employees still speak (in German) of that newfangled Reinheitsgebot law. But the big question on my mind is, can these guys go head-to-head with Widmer? 
Well, alright, I guess they can. The Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier delivers a superb banana nose that segues into pepper and clove. Despite the big, lumpy white head and volatile carbonation, I suspect my bottle was a little fatigued as the flavor seemed to arrive from a distance. The body was sunny chamomile, the flavor infused with the peppery bite of whole cloves and the invigorating tartness of dominant wheat malts. 954 charactersRedDiamond, Jul 13, 2005
3.78/5  rDev -14.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This beer pours out beautifully. It is a pale hazy golden color with a huge 3" cloudy white head (at least 1" above the rim of the glass). The head has great retention and left a little lacing.
The smell is of a spicy yeast, some clove, a little chalky with some powdery perfume aroma. The wheat is also prominent in the nose.
The taste is spicy, with a good chewy, bready yeast flavor. A little sourness from the wheat and I picked out some of the characteristic banana notes. This hefe has a medium finish with the spicy, yeasty notes being the longest visitors.
The mouthfeel is relatively soft with some good tongue tingling high carbonation.
Good hefe-weizen. Not my favorite but a very good example. Very refreshing and does the trick on a 100 plus degree bbq-ing day. 786 charactersMUSHROOMCLOUD, Jul 11, 2005

Nose was citrus rind over a foundation of wheaty yeast (that would be bread, eh?) Taste is pure bliss, with lemon zest, bananas, spices, and a mild carbonic bite. Fine medium body that never let the flavors fall apart. This is one fabulous hefeweizen. This must have decent availability. If you can find it, you should give it a try. 465 characterspentathlete, Jul 03, 2005

4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5After enjoying this brewery's doppelbock I was very excited to try the hefe...and it did not let me down. It pours yellow with some nice orange hues mixed in and slightly cloudy. Lively carbonation that looks great when drank out of the proper hefe glass. Great aroma. Lots of orange, lemon, citrus, and some bready malts. The taste follows the bill exactly. A great thirst quencher. Very impressive.
Hefe weizens are probably my least favorite style of beer, but I have to say I really enjoyed this one. My new favorite hefe and a must try for all you wheat beer lovers out there. I can see why this one is a classic. 621 charactersJacobob10, Jul 01, 2005

Humongous white fluffy heat atop a cloudy dark yellow hazy brew. Excellent retention, lacing, and carbonation
Phenolic as all getout, with sweet malts and yeasts vying for space in your nostrils
Medium bodied malt monster. Cotton candy, banana and clove, kept in check by a very light hop bitterness
Carbonation washes off any sticky remnants leaving a very pleasant taste. Worth having many more. 475 charactersDithyramb, Jun 26, 2005
4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured a beautiful near-opaque translucent pale orange, with the most amazing head - it's thick, bright white and incredibly creamy. Beautiful beer. I could spend all day just watching the head dissipate slowly into rolling hills of foam.
It's sweet and spicy; a very well balanced aroma. Cloves and yeast hit first, with banana and citrus coming on with a bit more subtlety. The wheat imparts a nice grassiness...a bit like fresh-mowed hay.
The taste wasn't quite was I was expecting. It's far milder than I anticipated. Soft cloves and banana, and a lot of yeast; the wheat is gentle and smooth. Interesting, but it doesn't overwhelm me.
This is a wonderfully smooth and drinkable beer. Eminently refreshing, it is a perfect complement to a hot, muggy summer evening. I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this one gets it right. 844 charactersthesilverhand, Jun 25, 2005

Nose is quite spicy and fruity at the same time. Taste is quite complex and extremely well balanced. Heavy on the banana flavor and clove, this is like the quintessential hefe, extremely well done. Lots of flavor layering going on, but not so much that it ruins what is basically a very quaffable and refreshing beer. Very well done, I could drink a lot of this and I will, especially at this price.

4.26/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5The beer poured hazy pale golden with a very slight amber hue. The head was white, large, and in charge coating the glass as it slowly retreated from the edge of the glass.
The aroma was very fruity with notable banana, a roundness in the aroma of wheat, and a slight spice of clove. Also some malty sweetness was notable.
The flavor was crisp with a nice dryness and quite a bit of banana fruit flavors. The wheat was noticeable and well done. The spice was very low clove but was present as the banana fruitiness diminshed in the flavor.
The finish was dry with a crisp wheat and slight spice lasting into the aftertaste with hints of that banana fruitiness. The body was medium but seemed lighter due to the higher carbonation levels. The beer was immensely drinkable and well done. I used to not like German Wheat beers, but they have certainly grown on me over the years. This is one of the most popular around.

The aroma is classic hefe weizen with banana and cloves, a little saaz too.
This hefe tastes sweet, with the accent being a banana flavor, the spices and hops give it a nice accent. Finish is clean and crisp.
This feels medium bodied, the carbonation and clean taste leads to a refreshing brew.
As far as drinkability this is a beer that can be enjoyed in looonnnggg session drinking due to it's ease of consumption, moderate ABV and overall refreshing taste.
Overall this is a one heck of a hefe, I'd like to try this on tap. I think this style is better tasting on tap and has more flavor. Still a very enjoyable brew on a hot summer day in June! 829 charactersHogHill, Jun 12, 2005

Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer, but I prefer some of the other brands (Franziskaner) over it.

Taste: Spicy and fruity. The malts break through the many flavors and are delicious. The beer is a little sour to the tongue and the spice remains as an after flavor. Other flavors I can taste remind me of cedar, vanilla, and apples. Really comes together well to make a nice fruity and complex taste.
Mouthfeel: medium body. Carbonation plays with the tongue along with a dry/spicy after feel.
Drinkability: This is one of my favorite drinking beers. It is well balanced, delicious, and I can drink this as well as any beer. In fact it is so good that I wish I had another bottle as the glass is empty.
Notes: This is the classic Hefe Weizen in my opinion. It is what the style attempts to emulate. I have never had a better hefeweisbier, and doubt I ever will. 1,111 characterscracgor, May 28, 2005
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a creamy caramel brown with a thick frothy off-white head. I poured the yeast in with it for the full hefe character, so it was quite cloudy. Not a bad thing at all in my book.
Fantastic rich and aromatic nose. Smells like sweet tomatoes with citrus fruit, herbs, a touch of cloves and bananas. There's a siltiness in there, even. Overall, there's layer after layer. A very nice nose.
Sweet initial flavour flettens out to a savoury taste of bread, finishing with a frefreshing bitter tang. A wonderful hefe. It's really pleasant and refreshing. It has a great deal of rich complexity for something with a relatively standard ABV. The advantage of that is that is supremely drinkable.
An excellent beer, one of the best hefes, and probably one of the best wheat beers. 783 characterslacqueredmouse, May 21, 2005
4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The gold standard of what I think of whenever I drink a hefe. This has a great pale color that is slightly orange-tinged and a big white head that goes no where fast. Smell of wheat malt with a touch of sweetness all laced with a clove and bruised bannana smell. The yeast flavor comes through in this cloudy beer and it mixes well with the other flavor. It is eminently drinkable and goes with pizza to duck and will still quench your thirst after mowing the lawn. 465 charactersHigravity, Apr 29, 2005
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Poured a dark yellow to orange color.
Smell: Bananas and malt.
Taste: The taste was of a sweet fruit begining, which mellowed into a slight bitterness which finished off with a dash of spiciness. 
Mouthfeel: There was a good amount of carbonation, not too much but not too little to make it feel flat.
Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. Easily one of the better beers I have had. Definitely reccomend it. 
Drink this beer cold. It seems to go down better cold. 488 charactersBeerNutta, Apr 19, 2005
4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Decanting this bottle, I fill my weizen glass with a cloudy straw colored brew, liberating a large white head. Nice strong estery aroma of bananas and sweet citrous, with some doughy yeasty notes, and a little spice. Taste is incredibly clean. The bready yeastiness is quick to the palate followed by sweet fruits and creamy malts. Then a blast of very crisp and clean citrous. The sweet and bitter flavors coexist in perfect harmony, without either one dominating. Generous amounts of tight carbonation work very well with the flavor. I could see drinking this beer for many different occasions. Remarkable taste and drinkability. 631 charactersBeerFink, Apr 15, 2005

Smooth and creamy in the mouth. Lightly sour wheat malt. Ripe banana and spicy clove and underlying pepper. Some lemon flavor underneath, lemon rind. Crisp, dry finish. An easy drinker for the hot Georgia summer. If it's not my new favorite hefeweisse, it's in the top three. 422 charactersViveLaChouffe, Apr 12, 2005

NO LEMON. NO ORANGE. aroma is pure buttery bananas, sweet, bready and a crisp tartness. tastes banana. smooth and rich flavor. mind-blowing in its texture and satisfaction. deep wheat notes coat the fruit and prevent an over-sweetening. slight bitterness initially in my cheeks. wayy to drinkable. goes down fast and slick. a near-perfect beer. only negative here is an excess of crispness and slight puckery finish, throwing off the smoothness in the end. 615 charactersgoodbyeohio, Apr 10, 2005
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I finally decided to buy one of these after looking at the bottle in the beer store for months. Lets see if it can stand up to my beloved Ayinger Brau-weisse.
A high pour into an Aventinus glass yields a straw yellow/gold beer with flowing bubbles of medium sized carbonation. This particular glass promotes a fabulous head in a wheat beer, and this is no exception with it's high, proud peak of pure white cloud.
The nose screams lemony citrus tang surrounded by a layer of yeasty, banana funk, chalk, and peppery, clove spice.
Taste is initially zesty lemon/orange, followed by a bit of sweet/sour banana phenols and underlying bready malt and white pepper/clove spice. There's a level of tartness that makes this beer the ultimate summer day refresher.
Mouthfeel is on the light side, as it should be with it's light-medium body. The finish is pleasantly sharp with a slight lemony/citrus bite. Aftertaste is clean and lemony.
An alltogether enjoyable weisse beer, worthy of a space right next to my Brau-Weisse. 1,030 charactersAlexJ, Apr 09, 2005
4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Wow! this one took me a bit by sauprise. just wanted to try something new. It says it's from germany, kick ass they know their beer, but it's brewed under the purity law of 1516!!! if its brewed under those guidlines, you know it will be different that 99% of domestics. taste is somewhat fruity, very defined, and good. it's a bit rougher to drink for the tastes of some but i find it drinkable and tasty. I will indeed have to try other beers form this brewery. Also the 5.4 alcohol content adds a nice touch. 511 characterstwi1609372, Apr 08, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is the quintessential hefe weiss in my opinion. The appearance is a light golden that is crystal clear for the most part and seems to have a very active carbonation without seeming to be too fizzy or harsh in the mouthfeel. The smell is very estery, producing the most beautiful banana/clove mixture I've had from a hefe. The taste is also quite estery, but the sweet malt presence cannot go unmentioned as well. I could drink quite a bit of this stuff, and I surely will in the future. Make sure to try one of these classic brews from the world's oldest brewery if you haven't already. 591 charactersneonbrown82, Apr 08, 2005
4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've been interested in Weiss beer for a while, but I could never seem to find a tasty one in any of my local stores. Then, finally, my neighborhood store started stocking Weihenstephaner. This is generally referred to as a great example of the style, so I just had to pick some up and give it a try.
Appearance: A cloudy orange-yellow with a thin, bubbly head.
Smell: Yeasty, with a distinct banana/spice-like scent.
Taste: A full-bodied, mellow tasting beer with banana-like flavors, bready yeast, and a touch of spicy flavor in the finish.
Verdict: This is a very tasty beer. It's extremely well crafted, and the various flavors are balanced very nicely. The banana flavors are never cloying, and the spiciness in the finish isn't too overpowering. 763 charactersbearrunner44, Mar 29, 2005

Lots of banana and some spices and cloves in the nose. Banana esters at first in the taste and then some cloves and wheat malt in the finish. This is a very tasty hefe, and a little mellow then some others which I find can be a little harsh. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth. This is a very nice and refreshing beer which I could have many of. Most enjoyable. 465 charactersfoamer, Mar 27, 2005
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a bottle in a genuine Weihenstephan weissbier glass. I just love this stuff. It was my intro to the world of real beer when I stumbled upon it accidentally in Freising (fresh from the brewery) where beer is cheaper than soft drink (soda). Bottled version suffers a little from the long journey to Oz. Pours hazy goldish yellow with a HUGE head that retains well. Classic aroma of yeast/bread, bananas and clove which also comes through in the taste in very large measure. Full mouthfeel with medium carbonisation and a yeasty/malty aftertaste that lasts for ages. Did I mention it was smooth and goes down without any resistance? Unable to stop at one. 657 charactershefevice, Mar 21, 2005
4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is the first heffeweizen I have had with the intent or rating/tasting/savoring the flavor and I am very impressed. The apprearance is slightly hazy as most wheats are. It is a dark straw color. There is a large, foamy head with great body. The smell is clovey and yeasty but quite subtle. As the beer warms, the yeast and clove smell and taste are more pronounced but very well balanced with the overall flavor of the beer. The mouthfeel is great. Slightly tingy and very comfortable. This is a very drinkable beer. I think it would be perfect during a hot summer day at Wrigley or Fenway with a loaded roast beef sandwich or even a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. Ahhh, how relaxing. 687 charactersSaCkErZ9, Mar 16, 2005
3.85/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Visually very good. Nice yellow color, with a hearty, foamy head. Very interesting scent, with a hearty amount of yeast backed up with an odd pungency (other reviewers say phenols, but it's something more than that. Almost like olive juice, but not quite). 
Much more subtle taste than you'd expect, with the scent it has. Had to finish half the glass before I could start to properly appreciate it. Yeasty and malty, though there's an odd metallic aftertaste that I don't quite like. Might just be mine, I don't see anyone else mentioning it. 
Not a half bad Hefe Weizen. Give it a try 592 charactersSetarconeX, Mar 16, 2005
4.07/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Hazy foggy straw hued pour with a scant layer of off white thin head cap.
Bold nose of coriander and cloves. Yeasty bouquet meets the flavor with a bone jarring assault that blends ripe bananas with a soft bread dough. Clean finish with a bit of citrous linger.
Cushy feel. Loads of sudsy carbonation. Damn near full bodied.
Last swigs: If Hefe is your Yen, this is a 5'er! Frothy wheat infused Hefe. The best Hefeweizen I've ever had. 444 charactersblitheringidiot, Mar 16, 2005
4.2/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance - Huge fluffy head. Cloudy golden color. The cloudiness intensified when the yeast from the bottom of the bottle made its way to the glass. Head retention is okay, beer lace is minimal.
Smell - Great yeasty and spicy aroma. Malty sweetness hangs out in the background.
Taste - Grainy and spicy. Hops are in there mostly as dressing. The grainy flavor is pretty sweet. This is balanced by a clove/phenolic flavor that I detect more towards the aftertaste. Complex, but unfortunately it does not seem fresh. The taste grows on you.
Mouthfeel - Decent body. At first the beer seemed watery, but it evened out over the time it took me to drink it.
Drinkability - Good drinkability. It improves as it warms.
Comments - This is a good beer. However, I think there are better hefes out there. This one just did not seem to be an ideal summer quencher. Be sure to let it warm up a little bit before you drink it. 930 charactersmgdeth, Mar 16, 2005
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This is an excellent hefe. A prime example of the style, and an ale that others of it's genre should be measured against. Pours an excellent hazy translucent amber, with a large head and deliciously nutty chunks of wheat hanging flecking the head and floating through the ale.
Smell is wheat, nutty yeast, a tinge of caramel, a soupcon of lemon. More develops as it warms, including cashews and pears. Taste is superb. The nuttyness of the yeast is chewy cashews on top of the pears and fructose-sweet caramel. There is a perfect amount of spiciness evident.
Mouthfeel is chewy and carbonated, with a peppery aftertaste. Smooth with a tinge of oiliness. Extraordinarily drinkable. Wonderful, refreshing hefe, well-suited to a warm spring afternoon. 754 characterskosmoraios, Mar 14, 2005
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy golden color, with a big head that takes forever to recede. Smell is musty, with a bit of banana and clove. Taste is very nice, definitely refreshing. There's some banana, and the mouthfeel is a bit weak. 
While this beer might be better suited for a humid summer night, as opposed to a cold winter night, it's a nice change from both the big beers, and session pale ales. Very nice, and sure to be a refreshing treat come summer. 446 charactersskybluewater, Mar 13, 2005
3.11/5  rDev -29.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5Appearence: Pours an oh so gorgeous creamy orange with a thin, sustaining nearly white head.
Smell: The smell is full of fruits. There is also a huge amount of sweet, almost woody notes.
Taste and Mouthfeel: The flavor is not quite as good as it's cracked up to be, in my opinion. There's just nothing special going on. The hops taste kind of artificial, and take away from the goodness of the fruits. The creamy mouthfeel helps render this problem a little but, but not enough.
Drinkability and Overall: What is that hop flavor? It's pretty disgusting. The more I drink of this beer, the less I want to continue drinking it. This is an overrated beer for sure. Even though you're the world's oldest brewery, that doesn't mean you're any better than the new ones. 772 characterssantoslhalper, Mar 07, 2005
4.96/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Fantastic!
Pours a pretty dark orange haze with a nice, fully retentive head.
Smells of strong wheatmalt, cloves, allspice, ginger, and banana. One of the most complex and wonderful smells I've ever come across. Truly something to behold. 
Big splash of banana upfront, followed up quickly by a bevy of spices and then the best tasting wheatmalt I've ever had. Just rounded enough, just spicy enough...it's almost perfect! Dry in the back with more fruit, making way for a nice white pepper aftertaste. Wonderful. 
Smooth as silk, too. Perfect body. Goes down easy.
Excellent, excellent beer.
I took my ladyfriend out to a chocolate and wine shop for our anniversary. I got to sit and drink this stuff and eat chocolate and I'd never felt like more a fancylad in my life and it was wonderful. 798 charactersmynie, Feb 27, 2005

A soapy golden color radiates below a pure white fluffy craggy head.
Smell of honey drenched malt with just the right amount of clove and a tad bit of sour notes. FRESH, FRESH, FRESH!!!
Taste: There's that honey-dipped wheat malt again. Earthy yeasts, banana, bubblegum, clove, slight hint of pepper and again - that quenching slight sourness. All these flavor burst at the beginning and the finish mellows but lasts forever.
Mouthfeel is spritzy and soft. The tongue continously tingles as this beer enters your mouth. A perfect balance of acidity and full-on maltiness.
Drinkability is high as this beer is practically flawless. I enjoy this beer year round, but May-August - fahgit abah dit!!!
Overall a stellar brew! My hands-down favorite bottled wheat beer, period. Unfortunately it's hard to find on tap in the Mid-Michigan area. The one time I had it in Ann Arbor (U of M country) - it blew me away!! The king of Bavarian style wheat beers!! 1,070 charactersmalty, Feb 26, 2005
4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Excellent beer that suffers from $2.50 pint night pour. Very little head in a "regular" pint glass. A little work with a straw after a few sips brings the head to life and awakens the hidden aromas developed in this beer. Still not a great presentation for this wheat monster that defines the style for me. Slightly cloudy with dark straw/ amber color. Truly a great summertime beer. But, when it's 65 degrees in February.. it just feels like summer. Malt/fruit flavor complimented by spice/citrus. One of a very few non-killer-hoppy beers that I could drink every day and that I actually keep in the beer frig. Choice is good. Starting a new UFO card does have it's advantages. 3 down, 197 to go. 697 charactersafatty, Feb 08, 2005

Presentation- 16.9oz bottle with a code of 7154 on the back label. Poured into my Ayinger Weisen glass.
Appearance- A cloudy golden pour with a 3/4 inch large bubbled head and acceptable lacing.
Smell- Typical hefe scents. A good amount a clove action with some sweet banana scents and maybe a tad of vanilla.
Taste- Nice and sweet tasting brew. A very heavy clove taste and creamy banana background. 
Mouthfeel- Left my mouth pretty dry. Although it was fairly creamy going down. Moderate carbonation level on this one.
Drinkability- Finally got around to the #1 ranked Weissbeer. I'm not sure if I like it as much or more than Paulaner, but it's pretty damn close. This beer was a tremendous thirst quencher and the sweetness worked well. Wish I had a Paulaner to sample after this. Either way, a great beer with a good price tag ($2.49) Will be a regualr of mine in the years to come. 964 charactersGClarkage, Feb 02, 2005
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5500 mL bottle with a batch number but no freshness date. Pours into the weizen glass a bright yellowish-orange with a 3-4 inch head which forces you to wait several minutes to fit the whole thing in the glass. By the time the glass is full the head is beautiful - rocky with small bubbles and poking more than an inch above the rim of the glass. Adding the yeast makes it a cloudy golden orange/brown. Reduces to a nice layer of foam that leaves slight lacing. Scents are bananas, spiciness, pepper, phenols, lemon, and maybe some vanilla. The beer is pretty thick and tastes like banana, pepper, and citrus (lemon/orange) with a low level of hops. I might have served the beer a bit too warm or released a lot of the carbonation during the poor because it is not as crisp as I remember. I could drink several of these bottles (which at about $2.50 is easy to do) but I'll remember to serve it a little cooler next time. Would be much better on a hot summer day than this snowy evening. 986 charactersmmmbeer, Jan 29, 2005
4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased as a 16oz bottle from Marty's Liquors, Allston, Mass., 28 January 2005.
This beer impressed me right from the first pour. It created a very thick head in my 20oz pint glass - I'm guessing this would probably be served better in a proper Hefe Weizen glass. The beer itself was very cloudy, almost to the point of opaqueness. The scent suggested vanilla and malt, with virtually no hop aroma.
This beer was exceptionally light in texture, and it went down very smoothly. A lemon flavor hit my tongue right about the middle, balanced by malt smoothness. There was no hop bitterness at all in this beer.
I would rate this as highly drinkable. One could certainly have several of these in a row. I recommend this as a great crossover for those who are looking to explore the world of better beer. 810 charactersbceaglejoe, Jan 29, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Cloudy golden pour with nice head of little bubbles. Aroma is predominantly malt wheat but I also catch some lemon, vanilla, and maybe a little sweet corn and grass in the nose. Very pleasant. Taste is nice and yeasty, but the lemon is there as well, with a little hint of vanilla in the finish. Mouthfeel is very light, maybe a tad too carbonated for my taste. Overall, though, I love this one. I hadn't had a hefeweizen in a few months, and I'm glad I picked this one to come back to the style. 496 characterswhartontallboy, Jan 24, 2005

The head is a big and white sticky head that sticks all over the glass. Sweet malt, lemon, and yeast dominate the aroma. Has a medium mouthfeel. Citrus, sweet malt, clove, banana bread, and a small amount a hop bitterness come out in the flavor. The yeast stays around for a while too. This is by far my favorite Hefe-Weisse beer! 396 charactersLuigi, Jan 19, 2005

Smell is malty and massively fruity. There are citric traces of oranges and pomerans that blends perfectly with the yeasty, big smell.
Taste is sweet, fruity, filling and delicious. Yeast comes first with light and fruity traces. Then comes citric tones with a musty and powerful sweetness that really is perfect. Carbonation is perfect and this beer is really good.
Just the greatest hefe weizen, perfect taste, perfect feel and i can drink these all night long. 625 charactersstjarnflikka, Jan 12, 2005

4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Paid $1.99 for a half-liter bottle...
The beer pours a hazy golden base with a very large white head, the head becomes lumpy and is visually stunning. The retention is phenominal and the lacing is very nice. The aroma was solid with tines of yeast, malt, banana, lemony goodness.
The taste wasn't strong but the smell gave away what was in my mouth, all of the above, but including cloves and honey? The mouthfeel is an good as it gets, this didn't feel like a beer in the mouth. The drinkability is also exceptional, a 5.4% is so smooth, this feels like a light hefe...
Final Thought: Very impressive beer, this and Franizkaner are the leading Hefe's in Germany. 672 charactersmobyfann, Dec 08, 2004
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516.9 oz bottle pours a cloudy, medium straw yellow body with an enormous, vanilla head that is rocky and pillowy, longlasting, with some patchy lace in its wake.
Aroma is surprisingly complex to my nose, with wheat grain, spicy clove and white pepper, and an unusual lemony banana note. 
Highly carbonated mouthfeel has a clove spiciness and medium body.
Taste: This one really surprised me with its complexity of flavors. Wheat, mild coriander, white pepper, lemon banana, vanilla, a note of clove, all meld with the carboantion. The yeastiness, when swirled in, adds some "Cream of Wheat" slickness to the mouthfeel. Finish is crisp, with a lemony citrus aftertaste.
 This Hefe will be a staple in my fridge next spring and summer. Really nails down the style with a high quality and excellent drinkability. 813 charactersmerlin48, Dec 06, 2004

4.59/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516.9 oz. bottle. Picked this up in Missouri. Not available here in Wichita.
Appearance: Started off a pale, golden yellow. However, with the addition of the sediment, this beer became an extremely cloudy, murky golden brown. The white head was huge and dissipated at a normal rate, becoming fluffy as it did so. A decent layer of bubbles remained floating on the beer for the entire pint. Lacing was surprisingly minimal.
Smell: Pure hefeweizen. Strong raw grains provided a solid foundation. On top of this was lemon zest and mandarin orange, with hints of sweet vanilla, banana, and clove. A full aroma, but it still had a nice crispness to it.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a chewy graininess. Crisp and light, without being thin and watery.
Taste: Damn, this is good stuff. A full bodied, raw wheat component kicked in immediately and didn't ever let up. Even on the aftertaste, you could feel and taste the grain along the sides of the tongue. This was the main component and was only lightly complimented by some lemon and orange in the middle and light banana and spices on the finish. Slightly astringent grain flavor in the aftertaste.
This is one of my absolute favorite hefes, and one of my favorite overall beers as well. I love the fact that it is all wheat, and that the other flavors are just there to compliment the taste, not take over and become the dominant flavors. This stuff is wonderful on-tap, too. One of the handfull of beers that I like on-tap as much as I like it from the bottle. 1,523 charactersQuaffer, Nov 30, 2004

It pours a semi-clear golden orange color with a white fizzy head that thins to almost nothing in less than 60 seconds. It has champagne like carbonation dancing to the surface of the beer.
Smell: Sweet alcohol, wheat, plae malt sweetness, citrus perhaps tangerine, and a sweet floral note.
Taste: The first thing I notice is a big sweet flavor. Notes of banana, cream, lemon, sandy leaf, and a bready maltiness. There's also a light hop bitterness in the middle that is barely noticable. A fruity aftertaste lingers.
Mouthfeel: It's a bit fizzy in the mouth making it less smooth and more combative going down.
Drinkability & Notes: A good hefe weizen but certainly not the best. The carbonation of this beer seems to be where it loses some style. It is very drinkable and if faced witha choice I may consider it again. It will not be a beer a I look for though. 936 charactersBrewMaster, Nov 21, 2004

Cloudy, yellow gold with a nice white head of foam that lasts, and leave nice lacing as well! Aromas are of wheat, yeast, lemon, banana, clove, and more! The taste is sweet and yeasty up front, bready in the middle, and clove-like and more dry toward the finish! The mouthfeel is medium bodied and yeasty and the drinkability is damn nice... 375 charactersfrancisweizen, Nov 11, 2004
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The head is a Solid Thing. I mean, the top of the head remains parallel with the rim of the glass when I tilt it. Jeez. Tiny, fluffy bubbles of eggshell white string out into webs that slide back into the liquid after a swirl. Ample carbonation, medium clarity to this ochre brew with pumpkin-yellow highlights. Yeast pour adds a nice murk. Smells like floating face-down in a vat of tapioca or banana cream pie. Malt aromas conjure buttermilk biscuits with fruit syrup and whipped cream; finishes with a hint of nutmeg (?) where I would prefer more spice. Light, smooth, appetizingly dry nosefeel. Taste it... unhhh. Banana cream with banana syrups and liqueurs. Full, dried apple body supporting impossibly rich pureed bananas, french vanilla, Bananas Foster, banana breakfasts, etc... to a finish of fresh plums and black pepper. Wonderful, but again I want spice. Exceptionally viscous and savory body starts creamy and full on the tongue, developing a wheaty wetness and light carbonation, ends dry. The brew seems geared towards filling a belly rather than quenching a thirst. Awesome hefeweizen, 964 years in the making. 1,127 charactersNearerMyBeerToMe, Nov 11, 2004

Pungent cloves and peppery smell. Sharp banana flavor compliments the spicy flavors well. Taste is a tad on the sweet side & cloves are very prominent. Pretty sharp flavor and a slightly gritty mouthfeel due to the wheat. A solid, authentic hefe that everyone needs to try. 324 charactershero27, Oct 22, 2004
4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Half-liter bottle, in a weizen glass.
Appearance: Pale amber, lots of haze. Decent head, but not as big as some.
Aroma: Huge fruity aroma, with a bready malt lingering on the edge.
Flavor/Body: Lots of yeasty spiciness, with full fruit flavors waiting in the middle. Banana esters dominate. Clove phenols are stronger than many weissbiers. Very highly carbonated, and delightfully thirst quenching.
I had my first Weihenstephan weiss about 6 or 7 years ago. Weiss beers had been one of my favorite styles for several years at that point, and discovering this, possibly the pinnacle of the style, was a revelation. I love it especially with breakfast. I just wish that one could get the Dunkel version of the beer here in Texas. 739 charactersallengarvin, Oct 21, 2004

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a truly world class beer and the most outstanding Hefeweizen I have ever had! This great elixer poured a perfect hazy golden color with a great big fluffy white head that slowly faded into a slight layer of froth on top the beer. The smell was so good I could have sniffed it all night long! It had a great spice character along with a room filling aroma of clove and bananna and a great bready character as well. The taste was heavenly and just erupted in my mouth with a nice citrus twang in the beginning, followed by a rush of bananna, clove, malt and a great prickely mouthfeel that seemed to excentuate the flavors. If you ever have the opprotunity to get this stuff, do yourself a favor and sample a beer at the top of its field! 744 charactersDmann, Oct 04, 2004

Pours a handsome cloudy orangish-gold under a 1.5 finger white head with good contour and decent staying power. Just a few spots of lace adorn the glass, though. The nose is sublime, fruit and spice in a mild blend that makes the taste buds yearn for a sip. The mouth is very well-balanced, both prickly and syrupy heavy, coating the entire mouth cavity with luscious sensation. The taste doesn't quite live up to the introduction, coming down a bit too heavy on the wheat, without enough of the accompanying spice. Still, a fine tasting beer. An airy feel characterizes the finish, as a bit of spice, and a hint of hops, come through. The aftertaste is all wheat, leaving the jowls feeling full long after the liquid is gone. Nice, yes indeed, nice. 960 charactersGlobetrotter, Sep 24, 2004

The brewer did a great job of hiding the alcohol (even tho not high at all--had a bunch with no effect). But I'm still not fond of hefewiezens. Albeit this hefe I found respect for and would not mind another one. It poured a dark gold in color and was murky/cloudy. There was a slight head that went away quickly. The wheat was not too sugary--which is why I think I am not very fond of hefe. Also, behind the obvious lime taste (there was a lime in it) there were hints of orange as well. 535 charactersMuddyFeet, Aug 13, 2004

4.27/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The mother of all hefeweizens. Seriously, from a brewing perspective; most hefeweizen yeast strains that produce all the hefes in the world can call this beer its grandparent. Pours a hazy orangy-gold color with a nice off white head, but dies a bit quicker than some other hefes. Heavy on the clove and the banana is pungent and ripe smelling. Nice and malty, and its yeastiness leaves a resiny lemon feel in the finish; no need for the addition of one. Pretty darn refreshing. Carbonation is good, because this beer is a little fuller bodied than your average hefeweizen. 573 characterscrookedhalo, Aug 06, 2004

Nice sharp malt wheat bready yeast with a burst of carbonation enhanced by a dose of clove with a slightly sweet dryish banana flavor. Good medium mouthfeel drinkability is great goes down quick smooth and refreshing great warm weather beer along with other hefe's out there.

The head is almost too much, with a light lace that stays on for a while. The aroma is citrus, almost banana. This doesnt have the heavy cloves of some Hefes. You do taste the cloves on the front end, along with the citrus. This is a great Bavarian yeast. On the back end, just a light taste of the grain. Mouth feel is very light. The drinkability? I could have 10 of these. This defines a summer beer, and the Hefeweizen style. Ive been asked for my opinion of the best, and this is it. 562 characterscarln26, Jul 24, 2004

Aroma is sweetly malty, very light spice, yeast, and lemon. Big hefe taste - malty, yeasty, very little hops, and some clove and lemon. Semi-crisp and nutty. I really enjoy this hefe, however it is on the pricier end of the spectrum, thus it loses in drinkability. I tend to think Paulaner is a better value, although this is better quality. 443 charactersAdmiraldinty, Jul 23, 2004

For flavor this beer packs a punch on the pallate. Initially this beer hits up front with a nice combination of wheat sweetness, a little bubblegum, and some slight spice. Following a nice lemon zest hits, with some nice yeast flavors. This beer finishes with a nice spice and a little sweetness, with the perfect amount of carbonation.

Typical cloudy yellow with a quarter inch of head that vanished as the bartender placed the pint before me.
Smell:
Beautiful sweet citrus-banana and clove aroma. Very reminiscent of a Willy Wonka  Runts.
Taste/Mouthfeel:
One of the spicier hefeweizens I've encountered, with an almost overpowering banana aspect that reminds me of a banana split minus the nuts. Very creamy mouthfeel for the style. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more.	
I've been hearing a lot of good things about this beer recently, and coincidently happened upon it, while out in Hoboken to catch a Joseph Arthur show at Maxwell's. 642 characterscbl2, Jul 20, 2004
4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The beer is a classic hefeweizen  the nose has hugely strong clove and banana aromatics, sweet and spicy and way more pronounced than any of the other weizens I've looked at so far.
The color also is exactly what I'd expect with a nice orange hue and a thick white head. The clove and banana flavor carry through to the taste, but it's not overwhelming. The wheat really shines in this beer, giving a clean acidity to the whole profile and making it a definite thirst quencher. The carbonation seems thicker as well, with bigger bubbles. Rather than being creamy, this beer really has a more soda pop carbonation that tickles the mouth.
This is definitely one of the best hefeweizens I've had, though they all have their unique aspects. This beer definitely seems very traditional with the strong clove and banana smell and flavor and an excellent tart wheat profile. 875 charactersstudentofbeer, Jul 17, 2004

The head last forever and remains incredibly regular and dense the whole time. The smell is greatly wheaty and yeasty. Sweet bananas are noticeabl but not overwhelming. The taste shows a good balance of the traditional flavors of a hefe weizen, nicely sweet and fruity with bananas, nicely wheaty and yeasty; the pronounced citric character is my only reason to complain. Mouthfeel is very smooth and round. There's not that much to say about this beer. It's good, it's a great and harmonious balanced. It's enjoyable to drink. 599 characterstjd25, Jul 17, 2004

This cloudy golden orange brew poured a 2 inch fluffy head that did not leave any lacing. The nose was of cloves, banana, and maybe honey. The taste is about as smooth as I have had in the beers I have sampled. It was comparable to a blend of banana bread with a fine wheat beer. The mouthfeel was extremely lively on the palate, refreshing and cleansing but a bit thin. This is about as drinkable as a beer gets. 628 charactersarizcards, Jul 10, 2004

Smells of citrus, a kind of malty sweetness & grass.
Taste is lemony, some spice (clove?), nicely effervescent with banana esters kicking in later and becoming more noticeable as the brew warmed up. Complex and fairly well balanced, although the banana got a bit much for me at the end. Aftertaste was like liquid banana bread. 
A medium body, smooth but not quite creamy feel.
Very drinkable, a great flavor, a great thirst quencher. 569 charactersPorterLambic, Jul 08, 2004

When the head subsides allowing access to the beer, I find more clove than I would like. I can admire its fresh and lively quality, amid the tartness and the tangy lemon finish. Despite the harsh, biting carbonation, it still goes down pretty easily. 352 charactersgentlebubbles, Jul 05, 2004
3.78/5  rDev -14.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Pouring this into a pint glass spins mere straw into foaming, messy gold if you're not careful. This is pretty brash, but quite complex for the style, with a lively spice/sweetness interplay that I'd normally associate with Belgian white ales. On its own, a cloying, boozed-up banana flavour, while not altogether unsatisfactory, threatens to overpower the wheat (and... cloves? coriander notes? aren't those dissonant and verboten in Germany?), but that sweetness pairs most gratifyingly with hot foods. I'll bet you can make pretty great pancakes with this beer. 
I can't think of any summertime meal that wouldn't profit from having this beer on hand. Get a few bottles for your next grill event. 702 charactersniall, Jul 05, 2004
4.97/5  rDev +13%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured in a 17-ounce Hefe glass with the Weihenstephaner label. The beer poured a perfect temperature and with the appropriately large head. The beer is a lovely hazy golden brew with tremendous lacing.
The aroma is one of blissful wheatfields. The malted wheat is the overwhelming sense of a great Hefe with just a slight hint of citrus and clove. This is the best Hefe I have tried. The taste is of almost pure malted wheat. It is rich and earthy with a closing hint of citrus. The taste is at once simple but deeply fulfilling. 
It is somewhat heavy in the mouth but cleansing and refreshing. On a hot day this proves to be the perfect beer. The experience is one that I will be repeating often. 704 charactersrdrummer, Jul 04, 2004
3.15/5  rDev -28.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5I realize it is a superficial gripe, but I don't like the labeling on this beer. The actual large label proclaiming Weihenstephaner in blue, white, and gold is nice, but I don't like the wrap around label on the neck. I don't particularly know why, though. Maybe it looks like a leg warmer on a beer, maybe it is becuase it looks contrived, or maybe I feel it is too slick or something. 
Regardless, this beer pours a hazy yellow with brown and orange tints that glow in the light. The head is big, although I've seen bigger, and lasts a respectible amount of time. The beer bubbles like hell, too. Looking into the beer it almost looks like it is boiling.
The nose starts with equal parts slightly green banana and clove, but as it warms the clove predominates. A hint of bubblegum peeks through in the back. It smells rather sweet to me. Floral and nice.
A soft and light banana hits at first then is whisked away by the biting carbonation. This biting carbonation is a real negative in my book. A slight clove and sweet and juicy bubblegum sneaks in as well, but everything is dominated by the harsh tasting carbonation. This is like seltzer water. I'm gonna hafta knock points for that.
Mouthfeel is too biting and sharp for what I think should be a smooooth beer. 
I'll drink what's in the fridge, but I'll be thinking about other beer. 1,356 characterssilenius, Jun 29, 2004

Up until now, my favorite hefe has been Paulaner... I'd be hard pressed to pick a favorite now! The Weihenstephaner has a more prominent banana flavor, while the Paulaner is more lemony. Both are great! 490 charactersjimdkc, Jun 26, 2004

Smell: The aroma of fruit comes through. I mainly detected a banana like scent. Spice as well. 
Taste: As alluded to by the smell, the taste starts off with malty sweetness. The sweetness is briefly followed by a low level crisp bite. This bite in the middle creates an enjoyable balance. Slight alcohol in the finish. There is a dryness present also. --As the beer warms, a crisp/sour taste comes out. Very nice. 
Mouthfeel: Thick on the tongue. Little or no aftertaste. 
Drinkability: I could see myself drinking a few of these. However, I think a need for hops would take over eventually.
This beer tastes better at a warmer temperature. 737 charactersthinkbreakfast, Jun 23, 2004
3.55/5  rDev -19.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Many fans of wheat beer consider Weihenstephan's Hefe Weissbier to be the #1 wheat beer in the world. Is it a good wheat beer? Why, certainly. The best in the world? Hmmm...
This brew pours a hazy yellowish-gold color with an orange hue. A decent foamy head forms and lasts for about 2 minutes. The aroma is mostly of bananas, with some wheaty notes and mild spices present. The beer feels moderately carbonated, which is a bit typical for the style. I would have to say the most dominant flavor is the fruity/banana presence, although there is a nice wheaty "twang" and some very pleasant toasted wheat flavors present in the brew. The classic "hefe clove" flavors were a bit low in my opinion and were almost absent. There is a low moderate dryness in the finish, which carries over into the aftertaste along with some more wheaty flavors. The brew concludes with no alcoholic warmth.
This is a pleasant drink and very refreshing, but I expected a bit more from a beer that is held in such a high regard. Perhaps I expected it to be a bit more complex, but in the end this was a bit more forgettable than I thought it would be. A good, above average hefeweizen. 1,169 charactersBeastdog75, Jun 23, 2004

The smell of the beer is great, the wheat comes right out, and is backed up with a malty smell, and some yeast.
The taste is exceptional. Very strong wheat and yeast flavors, with a slight hop bitterness, and spiceyness. The malt flavor is very well balanced. The beer is backed by a slight lemony and grassy tone, but the big thing here is the wheat and yeast. 
The mouthfeel is nice, crisp, clean, smooth, nothing short of great.
Overall I would rank this as one of my favorite of the style, if not my most favorite. This is one beer I could drink all day. 675 charactersusualpulp, Jun 15, 2004

Banana flavored anything is a favorite of mine, so imagine my surprise to find it in my beer. The aftertaste, and quite after, was almost grassy. It is the strangest combination in tastes that I have found in a beer. It was a bit frothy, and I seemed to do a lot of mouth smacking afterwards, but it was light enough to enjoy on a hot evening with friends. Very different from my normal stout, or porter choice. Since most of my friends drink wine or macros, I offered this one around for a taste. Everyone was pleased, now they have to figure out how to pronounce it so they can find it to buy it. 707 charactersfinepaws, Jun 13, 2004

Smell is spicy, peppery, cloves, tart apricots, lemon, cut grass, and some ash. Polished flavor flaunts its stuff - wheat gives twang, munich malts give a grainy sweetness, yeast gives smoothness but also spicy phenolics, hops are there more to balance than to provide much flavor.

Aromatic of banana bread spiced with clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger. Touches of lemon as well.
Fully malty up front. Rounded cookie dough, but not necessarily sweet. Bananas too. And loads of them, sprinkled with powdered sugar and vanilla. Spice arrives in waves. Clove is foremost, but ginger and white pepper are clearly noted. Emblematic W'stephaner yeast, like lime sorbet. Minor herbal hop notations at the close.
Medium-hewn with rippling carbonation.

There's a banana yeast smell over everything, almost like a banana nut bread without the nutmeg. I think they'd go great together.
The taste wasn't too far from the smell, banana and yeast with a bit of citrus and maybe some spices.
It has a very substantial feel to it, nice.
Personaly, I prefer wheat beer to have more of a citrus taste to it, but this isn't too bad, I could drink one once in a while for a change. 649 characterspsyco1, May 12, 2004
4.33/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Slighty cloudy golden color with a nice big 2" head. The aroma was of wheat and banana, bit not overly strong. The flavor was much bigger as the wheat, banana, grain, citrus, and light spiciness made the tastebuds very happy. Mildly tangy.
Smooth mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish that was quite clean. Nice carbonation levels. Light and refreshing. Very enjoyable hefe that can be quaffed all day long. 409 charactersGavage, May 08, 2004

The head disappeared rather quickly, and there was no lace on the glass. Smells sour, with a hint of banana. Tastes slightly sour, grainy, with a minimal amount of spice. Seems to be highly carbonated. This is a very drinkable beer. Very refreshing, and easy to drink. Sounds good for summertime. 350 charactersBierguy5, Apr 19, 2004

The scent is the classic hefe scent, yeasty, banana, citrus, all the good stuff. A fairly light-bodied beer, we have a nice yeast blend with smooth malt, some bananay/clove tastes, a perfect hefe, probably the best one ive had to this point. 327 charactersTballz420, Apr 14, 2004

A top notch German wheat beer, but it still plays second fiddle to Julius Echter in my book. 285 characterscedricwarner, Apr 07, 2004
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled on tap at Redbones.
This hefeweizen poured a cloudy, golden color with white foam that settled. The smell was a very nice: banana, cloves, wheat malt. The taste was fruity banana and wheat malt with a slight sweetness. The flavors of yeast and caramel or toffee were also evident. There was a bit of hops in the finish, and an overall tanginess. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and medium carbonation. The flavors of banana and yeast lingered pleasantly. This was a very nice hefeweizen. 508 charactersUncleJimbo, Apr 05, 2004
4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer was served in a 22 ounce pilsner with a slice of lemon on the side. I politely tossed it aside, for this beer needs no assitance from slices of fruit.
Appearance: The beer is almost orange. Very cloudy deep yellow that really is closer to orange. Nice frothy white head of about and inch that lasted for quite some time.
Smell: Wow. That's a hefeweizen for sure. Heavy yeast smell, with some malted wheat and citrus, most notably oranges and lemon.
Taste: Ahhh. Exactly what I'm looking for. Great balance of classic spice and unfiltered goodness. The wheat malt is really left to speak for itself, as the clove and light corriander play around more in the aftertaste. Very yeasty, very earthy. Taste of damp grass. Incredible.
Mouthfeel: Light and refreshing, but with the yeast it is somewhat heavier and satisfying. 
Drinkability: Not exactly one I would drink non stop, but instead a good one to sip on and quench your thirst. Very excellent indeed. A great example for others to follow. 1,006 characters99bottles, Apr 01, 2004

Smells great, lots of banana and citrus in the nose... fresh cut flowers... very fragrant.
The flavor is sweet and malty with accents of banana and has a very spicy crisp finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium to full and carbonated perfectly. Goes down nice and smooth.
This is a solid & drinkable hefe, I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good wheat brew. 503 characterskmcnair, Mar 31, 2004

It boasts of fruity wheat malt and hefe yeast scents. It has that banana aroma that is sweet and inviting. The taste is great also. It is crisp and sweet with a bold fruity malt/yeast flavor that finishes very refreshing. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a great hefe. So many hefes taste watered down and weak, but not this one. It has good flavor and great hefe aroma. 503 charactersWesWes, Mar 26, 2004

 Crisp and refreshing with tingly carbonation. The flavor is very nice. Citrus is a good addition to the cloves and bananas. Yeast flavor adds a really nice touch as well as light grains. The drinkability is excellent, and for this nice warm night, it really hits the spot. This is what a hefe should be. 484 charactersElGuapo, Mar 25, 2004
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a cloudy orange with an heroic, frothy head that dares you to even think about it going away any time soon. Yeasty, bubbly...easy on the eye. The smell is dominated by pineapple and spice, with a very very yeasty, bready undertone. The taste is crisp and slightly dry at first, with some hops letting themselves be known before being totally inundated by a menagerie of fruit and spice notes. Pineapple and cloves are notable in the flavor, and as the brew increases in sweetness toward the end, a nice little anise/fennel/licorice note adds a very special something to the brew. Mouthfeel is nice. A bit chewy but, being an American, I could have used a bit more carbonation. Drinkability is fine, though I am not sure that I cold deal with more than a few at a time. A good beer. A stupendous hefe. I'll need to try this brewery's other offerings. 855 charactersMobBarley, Mar 19, 2004
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It pours a hazy honey gold. A healthy finger of white head clambers upward and persists nicely, then dwindles to a wispy froth. 
Lightly sweet malt dances sweetly in the aroma, along with a fresh clove presence. The yeast yields a notion of sourdough at the edges. Vague berry fruit notes carry to the close and fade gently. 
On first sip, a somewhat thin sweetness of malt is well matched by a gracious clove character. Mild but brisk citrus fruit notes move in, along with a distant berry essence, both well-placed on the heels of the spice. The finish plays out with a yeast-driven mild sourness holding hands with an indistinct but veritable bitterness. Simply, eveything about the flavor says refreshing. 
A bit north of light bodied, it seems almost to glow in the mouth. It leaves its flavor and slips away cleanly, haiving established its identity.
There's nothing especially complicated here, and that goes toward making this so good. Each element does yeoman's work and ends up being fresh and refreshing. Good anytime, the idea of quenching a summer's thirst is appealing indeed. It drinks with no effort and continues doing so well past a couple bottles. During the best of times, or the worst of times, this shows that wheat is good. And in this case, damned good. 1,289 charactersFoxman, Mar 07, 2004

Poured out a hazy orange with a decent head on it that continues towards the end. Smell consisted of some orange and spices. Taste was very exceptional. Some malts kick in softly at first then some citrus notes hit mixed in with some hops. Some lemon in there too, but very little of it. Finishes off with some bananas and cloves with some alochol and spices mixed in for some balance. Truly an amazing beer. One of the best money can buy. This would be perfect on a hot summer day. I'll be stocking up with plenty of these this summer. Go buy lots of these, well worth it. 696 charactersnecoadam, Mar 04, 2004

A nose that can be detected from a foot away - cloves, bananas, freshly baked bread all compliment a wonderful smelling brew. Sweet up front, a large yeasty-based body, clean, ever so smooth, rich in taste - spices, cloves, traces of lemon, delicate touch of pepper as she warms, wheat, barley malt, hop detection, it's all there. Medium bodied, full flavored, world-class, clearly the hefe-champ-of the world. 589 charactersGeoffRizzo, Feb 22, 2004

Its amazing. Spicy aromadecidedly yeasty and estery, with the expected clove and vanilla smells. Underpinnings of citrus and wheat. Mouthfeel is extraordinarily soft and creamy, with a nice carbonation bite on the tongue. Its a little grainy, and full of wheat and yeast flavors. Theres a very slight hop presence at the finish, but it stays far in the background. 
Overall, this is a refreshing, clean, tasty beer. Its exactly what a hefe should be. Id love to try it on a hot summer day. 617 charactersSuds, Feb 15, 2004

The whiff out of the bottle was wonderfully spicy. Out of the glass the beer smelled more musty, grassy, and yeasty. Tasted wonderfully crisp and spicy with a creamy wheat malt backbone supported by extremely flavorful hints of clove, banana, citrus, and peach. Dry, very refreshing and drinkable as a hefeweizen should be. One minute I had a full bottle, next minute it was gone. 502 charactersrajendra82, Feb 14, 2004
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Looks absolutely stunning in my Hacker-Pschorr Weisse glass. Heavy visible carbonation in this hazy gold colored liquid that looks like it is producing its own light. Topped off by a full 2 inches of head, even after a conservative pour. Smells heavily of citrus and hops, and maybe even the smell of berries. Makes me think of a summer day. Taste is very mellow and smooth. Bananas, oranges, cloves and a nice hops finish make this a very delicious beer, and a steal at $2 for a pint bottle. I would assume that this is a better Summer brew than a February-in-Minnesota one, but it is still very good. 602 charactersTastyTaste, Feb 13, 2004

4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours golden straw with a nice white head that lingers nicely throughout. Aroma is of the expected cloves, yet they are mild. Definite tropical fruit/banana esters in there too. Taste starts off with a dose of cloves, then melds into a nice vanilla type flavor with some slight graininess in there. No nasty clove aftertaste, a definite plus in my book. Full taste without being overwhelming in any area. Mouthfeel is not thin, but just thick enough to keep it silky, with just enough carbonation. Very drinkable, could quaff all night, but I would long for something a bit more complex. The best Hefe i've had besides Schneider & Sohn. 636 charactersavylover, Feb 10, 2004

A delicious beer as well, consisting of a bold yet clean and crisp malt body and a satisfying finish that was moderately tart and dry with lingering orange essence. The body was full and smooth, and the carbonation was appropriate. A top-notch hefewiessbier that I could drink all night. 568 charactersHiroProtagonist, Feb 09, 2004

Aroma of wheat, clove, light malt and a hint of hop bitterness. Very mild lemon/citrus note in the background.
Sweet malt, buttery wheat bread with plenty of yeast. Clove jumps out in the middle as well as citrus fruits. Finale is a hint of spicy hop bitterness and touch of dry alcohol.

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance  Beautiful orange in color and hazy with some good carbonation and a monster hefe head.
Smell  The aromatic wheat flowed freely from the glass. This is classic German wheat, straight from the oldest brewery in the world (1040).
Taste  This is the taste that many an American brewery has tried unsuccessfully to imitate. The light yeast flavor is incredibly smooth here. Its not singular and strung out like most efforts of the style. Its tight and complex with a lightly sweetened orange finish.
Mouthfeel  Wonderfully carbonated just as the style demands. The carbonation is big and fluffy yet the bier is medium-bodied. If you swish this in your mouth the carbonation explodes. This is excellent.
Drinkability  Its not easy to find, but this is an authentic representation of the style and is terrific to drink during the day or in between meals.
Update  Its been a full year since I first reviewed this weizen, so I thought Id take another stab at it after writing reviews for a year. 
I feel the same way now as I did then. This hefe is just terrific. Its one of the few imports that take me back to Bayern where I lived for six years. Zum wohl! 1,202 charactersRoyalT, Jan 12, 2004

When this stuff hits your mouth, a sweet wheaty taste lines your tongue and the finish is very crisp. I could pick up a tiny hint of alcohol taste but the sweetness matched it well. This truly shocked me since I normally don't like this style of beer. Two thumbs up! 473 charactersALESwhatCURESya, Jan 09, 2004
4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was quite good indeed...if, of course, you enjoy Hefeweissen. It had the characteristic peachy/orange-ish/cloudiness of a Hefe. Likewise, it was also quite spicy, aswell, and remniscent of cloves and nutmeg. Medium amount of carbonation lets you know you're drinking beer, but doesn't have the "sting" of something like Sprite. Goes down pretty smooth and leaves a nice, pleasant taste in your mouth. This one seemed a bit sweeter than other Hefeweissen I have had in the past. Not sickeningly sweet, just a wee bit sweeter than say, Franziskaner. All-in-all, I really enjoied it and would certainly spend money on this again. 631 charactersSilentSabre, Jan 06, 2004

Strong, full aromas of banana, cloves, yeast, bread and spice rise out of the glass in perfect full harmony. Wonderful stuff.
Palate is thick, full, creamy, long and a touch dry. Flavours are fruity (tropical and citrus) and well as some light spice and good wheat/bread flavours. Did I mention full?
I love this beer, and considering I only just discovered a relativley close bottle shop that carries this range I look forward to consuming many over the following summer months. 589 characterskoolk, Dec 04, 2003

I love the flavor since it's chock full of yeasty banana and clove. The beer tastes wheaty, with sweet and bitter complementing one another rather than clashing. The finish favors dry, with a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Drinkability is excellent; this bottle disappeared very quickly. Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier is my first hefeweizen and I found a lot to like. 572 charactersBuckeyeNation, Dec 01, 2003
3.68/5  rDev -16.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served chilled in a pint glass at RFD's.
Appearance: Cloudy golden yellow that almost seems to exude a glowing soft light. Topped by a smallish white head. A constant ring of fine bubbles. Little fingers of proto-lace struggle to stick to the glass.
Smell: Yeasty and bready smell with faint hints of citrus. Not all that estery in comparison to the kristallweisse, faint banana and bubblegum.
Taste: Lightly sweet bready/yeasty malt flavor that gives way to a bubblegum finish. Hints of clove and slightly sour.
Mouthfeel: Very light and effervescent. Not as thin as the kristallweiss, but still very refreshing.
Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Less fragrant and bubblegummy than the kristallweiss, but certainly more yeasty overall. 748 charactersManekiNeko, Nov 18, 2003

This beer's head is gigantic and aromatic. Notes of bananas, oranges, clovers, and general fruit smells fill the air. Flavor is complex yet balanced. Notes of vanilla, in addition to bananas, oranges, clovers assault the palate and please the mouth. The mouthfeel is luxurious and thick and the carbonation is light and slow.
A real prize to find. Thankfully, its quite easy to come by in Rhineland pubs. 442 charactersallboutbierge, Nov 06, 2003

The Weizen was a nice fruity crisp beer, with a nice balance of the Banana/Clove flavor against a refreshingly wholesome yeastiness. Definitely worth searching out and procuring while I was in Germany, and best of all, I can now get it at my local bottle shop. 395 charactersGueuzedude, Nov 03, 2003

Appearance: Brilliantly clear pale yellow with active carbonation feeding a pillowy dense pure white head. Head formed up to about a finger and a half with a gentle pour. Left a few streaks of lace, but mostly the head kept to itself, lasting through the beer.
Flavor: Still sniffing, hold on a minute.
Flavor: Banana like yeast coats a solid malt base that quickly disappears with only a wisp of the pleasant yeast taste to remind you &#8220;Hey, take another drink, QUICK&#8221;. Clean clean clean, smooth smooth smooth, induces palalia induces palalia induces palalia. 
Mouthfeel: Slick, evasive, did I just drink something? Did leave a mild tingle between the lips and gums.
Overall Impression: Well, there is a reason these folks have been around since 1040 AD. They make some outstanding beer. About the only complaint I have is that it doesn&#8217;t come in 4000 oz bottles. This was my first Weihenstephan Hefeweissbeir; it will NOT be my last.

Flavors of banana, vanilla and yeast combine with a pleasant malt taste. Finish is very clean and refreshing. A great companion to breaded fish and fries on a Friday night.

More intensely flavored than most bottled Hefes, yet clean as a whistle. 400 charactersputnam, Oct 11, 2003

4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A clean, crisp beer that has a delightful flavor and decent look. The yellow body is topped by a great cloud of white foam and the residual does its share of lacing. The nose is a bit light and lacks clear definition, but there is enough to give the sense of yeasting and malt that one might expect. The flavor is very special; it's not so much what it gives, but rather what it doesn't give and that is the typical over-cloving sense. This beer impresses of balanced malt and a gentler spiciness than is typical of this style. Quite lovely stuff this. Lighter bodied and crispy without tartness, this has drinkability plus. 624 charactersAtLagerHeads, Sep 17, 2003

Smell: Very malty with some spices evident. A very crisp and wonderful aroma.
Taste: A good flavor but different, maybe I will have to review this again when I know more about the style. Very malty with a nice mixture of hop flavors. Tangy with a nice carbonation bite to it. Some spices are towards the back.
Mouthfeel: A nice crisp mouthfeel, good carbonation and good consitency.
Drinkability: Excellent! Very drinkable and considering the low alcohol content you could drink this all night.
A very good brew, definitely worth giving a try, will probably keep this as a good backup. I enjoyed this much better than the other beers from this brewery. 847 charactersEllbert, Sep 12, 2003

The taste was hefe plus.. It was easily one of the best ive had. Nice banana bread and cloves, a touch of sweetness with just enough bite to level it out before it became cloying. Nice silky mouthfeel left you wanting more.. High drinkability- could be a great session beer. As i said one of the best hefe's I have tasted and will definately get again. 528 charactersTinusTime, Sep 05, 2003
4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cloudy, hazy, beautiful wheat beer accompanied by a pocky, white, billowing head. Appropriate carbonation and a welcomed sight overall.
The smell is a full-on hefeweizen scent...bananas, citrus, and a wonderful undertone of smooth spice. These smells carry over nicely into the flavor department. In addition, there is that delightful yeasty component that just envelopes the palate. A notable apple cider note comes through as well. The flavor is so full and dead-on, the finish a rich, creamy, complex wheaty-ness...perfect reasons to savor this beer. The smoothness and fullness is really setting a huge benchmark for other wheat beers to follow. Tangy goodness. 
To go along with this, I'm gonna having a Jerk Vegetarian Chili made with lotsa lime, clove, and habanero. This might be heaven on Earth. One of the best. 827 charactersZraly, Aug 30, 2003

A fresh fruity smell of bananas, and slightly citrus. A sweet taste that is not too dry, is clear and clean, and finishes quite crisp. Great mouth feel with strong effervescence. An admirable balance of desirable characteristics in a Hefe Weizen. 344 charactersSeanChouffe, Aug 27, 2003

I poured this beer and got the aroma without trying to..its potent. The head is so thick I was tempted to put the bottle cap on it just to see...I'm sure I'd have had no problem leaving it right there for a few moments. Nice golden color..of course its cloudy, its a hefe. Its almsost like a Belgian in its complexity...also with the amount of carbonation. You get the banana & clove taste you'd expect with the yeast, but the subtle spiciness kicks in...feels light and crisp like a good hefe should. Extremely drinkable. This is a top-notch beer...can't wait to have it again. 664 charactersau1sec, Aug 26, 2003

Very refreshing, and easy drinking. 318 charactersBeerBuilder, Aug 15, 2003
4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is one of my favorite hefe's. They have been brewing beer for almost 1000 years so you can always count on getting a good quality beer. Many of the Hefe=weiss around the world get their yeast from Weihenstephen. I prefer the draft versions over bottles as it seems to have more of the phenolic (bananna) charecter that I like in a hefe. Golden color. Cloudy, rich creamy head that you can float a quarter on... 415 charactersbigbelcher, Aug 10, 2003

I was a little let-down by the beer, not because it was bad, simply because it was not as good as I would have expected from them. Hazy golden pour with copious yeast in suspension. Vigorous carbonation and head production. Muted aroma of wheat malt and yeast. Flavor was bright and sharp, but the banana and clove notes were not nearly so evident as I expected (and hoped). Overall, a fairly average representation of the style. 546 charactersBrent, Aug 07, 2003

The smell hit immediately. Strong of bananas, cloves, and a bready malt aroma.
Bananas and a yeasty, malty taste were up front. Cloves and spices asserted themselves and I was left with a lingering banana bread taste at the finish.
Feel was light, dry, crisp and very refreshing.
Huge drinkability!! Wonderful taste and aroma made it hard for me to restrain myself from downing my six-pack in one sitting. I'm delaying my self-gratifacation to more thoroughly enjoy them. This is the standard bearer for the style. Truly world-class. 702 charactersBoilermaker88, Aug 04, 2003

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This German hefeweiss pours a hazy golden color with a huge, pillowy white head sitting atop the liquid. Head retention is superior, as excellent lace appears down the glass. Smell is that of a traditional German hefe -- banana, clove, hops, yeast, and assorted spices on which I can't put my finger. Taste is very nice with notes of clove and assorted spiciness, while a bit of hop flavor kicks in on the finish. While mild carbonation permeates the mouth, this is an incredibly smooth brew. Drinks as well as any hefe I've tried, too. Perfect for the summer. This is the best bottled German hefe I've tried thus far. Tap could be another story, but that will have to wait for another day. Very well done. 706 charactersJon, Jul 18, 2003

A very smooth, very crisp brew. Finishes on the sweet side with minimal hoppiness. A masterpiece of a beer! 381 charactersgranger10, Jul 05, 2003

The taste is just a bit on the malty side with some orange flavor hiding behind the clove and banana. There is some other spices lurking in there. The mouthfeel is nice and heavy, not too carbonated.

Aroma contains citrus tones which arise at the forefront of the aroma with magnificant clove and sweet carmalazied banana notes produced by the yeast. Faint hop aroma balanced by the sharp sweetness of the malted wheat. A full flavor that comes throught sharply sweet at first then mellows int a rolling wave of banana, clove, citrus notes that coat the palate very nicely and finally topped of with some balancing delicate hopping. Mouthfeel is lacking a little on the carbonation level not as bubbly as I expected and the body is a fluffy medium to light density.

It has a nice wheat beer aroma not stoo strong though. Its flavor starts off with mild fruity banana lemon and yeast notes then mellows into a lingering soft mouthfeel. It is on the thick side which adds to the smooth mouthfeel. It is an easy brew to drink and is one that you could easily enjoy in a beer tent at the Oktoberfest!

One super large fluffy off-white head nearly three inches tall, fades and pops slowly to leave a fine thin head with some stringy sticking lace. Smell is a nice light and airy, fluffy lemon with a nice grainy wheat bread background and notes of banana and spice. Taste is one refreshing, rock solid hefe, with a perfect balance of lemon, not to tart, good breadish tone, wheaty, yeasty, but all very mellowing and smooth. Notes of banana linger and some spice of cloves. Feel is pretty full from sip to swallow, very mellow, has a textured feel in the middle, moderate tartness and a very clean finish. Which makes it incredibly drinkable, no doubt about it. 731 characterstavernjef, Jun 22, 2003

Grain and wheat bran aroma, some nutmeg and a mild estery sense. Rolling but light-bodied banana bread ester beginning but a quick turn to a more neutral approach of mild white toast breadiness. Medium to medium low carbonation. A distinct lemony finish, but overall, a dry finale for a Hefe. Very easy to drink with a nice start but a slightly disappointing finish for me. 480 charactersADR, Jun 22, 2003

Hazy yellow effervescent body, topped by the traditional enormous foamy white head. Wonderful aroma, mostly bananas, with a bit of bubblegum lurking about. Strong lemon taste, but not overly tart. Mouthfeel is nicely full, but could use a dash more carbonation to make it a tinge lighter. This is a fine summertime beer.

Lots of smell coming from this one. Reminded me of honey/wheat/banana. Poured surprisingly thick with a pretty thick head, even with a perfect pour. The head lingers in some fashion the whole way through this one. Appears very cloudy in the glass, which coupled with the thick appearance, gives the illusion that this isn't a hefe at all. Goes down very smooth, with a taste exactly like the aroma I described above. I think I had my hopes up a little higher on this one. I had the Paulaner hefe a few days earlier, and think I still prefer that one...I'd like to try them both in a taste test! Definately worth a try, but not quite all that I expected. 761 characterskevinl6, Jun 19, 2003

The cloudy amber color was misleading as it was very clean and light. The aroma was mild yet full of yeasty clove and a touch of banana. The flavor was great as it complemented the aroma well with a more malty and hoppy clove flavor. The finish was so clean that i would love to drink this beer up at lake tahoe in 100 degree weather before i jump into the cold ass lake. The head subsides a bit as you drink it but it is pretty tenacious and clings to the glass. The only letdown was that the head did not leave lines on my glass so i could count how many drinks i had taken. Overall a wonderful hefe and i would definetly drink this one again. 812 charactersRenoZymurgist, Jun 15, 2003

Nose is grainy and forceful, but managing to maintain its balance. The yeastiness, fruity esters and phenol that are the hallmarks of the style are all there, but again, nothing dominates. Instead a cohesive and complete expression of the style is made.
Refreshingly light on the palate. The grains again dominate, but the supporting characters are all there to make a well-integrated whole. First class example of the style. 509 charactersRealale, Jun 07, 2003

Seems to achieve the best overall balance. Exhibits the typical spicy, clovey notes, and pours the usual large foamy head. At times, the clove-like flavors of wheat beers don't appeal to me, but the Weihenstephan is not excessive in that regard. I have thoroughly enjoyed every one of their beers, and would strongly recommend this to fans of the style. Clean and refreshing, all the way. 517 charactersJohnnyDuvel, Jun 02, 2003

This beer poured a yellow color from the bottle that was cloudy, which I expected, but when held up I could see the carbonation bubbles, which were plenty. The head that was created was white in color, foamy, dense and long lasting. I you drank while it was freshly poured you would get the milk mustache. I really left no lace behind, just in spots but it seemed watery more then sticky. The aromas that came from the glass were of dough, citrus  lemons, floral hops, malt, wheat and barley grains, and I detected a small, small hint of metallic.

A gargantuan, white head... mini explosions, mountains of foam. Lots of sticky, clumpy lacing. The beer is slightly cloudy, gold and amber.
There's lots of spice in the nose, along with some citrus, and some detectable alcohol when cold. The front is spicy citrus, turning just a little sour instead of the sweet I was expecting. The finish is bitter fresh, with some green apples. Bread and butter. Nuts make an appearance in the aftertaste. This is a very, very good beer. Even better at temperature. Freshly buttered fresh bread. I wouldn't have minded a little more esters, but really... one of the most delicious beers I've had. 737 characterskbub6f, Apr 21, 2003

Pours a beautiful cloudy yellow with a nice head that hangs around. Some yeast to cloud the issue.
Cool it down. ~40F is a good temp. Get the right glass. Pour it. Taste it. You won't want just one. Beautiful spice taste, hops and citrus bite. Hefeweisen as we define it. I would love to try this fresh in a German pub on tap.

4.7/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a very pale yellow, quite cloudy. Holy head! Soft, pillowy, and extraordinarily abundant. When I swung my wheat beer glass around I was entertained by explosions of bubbles roaring up to underbody of the head. The carbonation stacked up into an amazing structure: the bubbles pile up like a perfectly aligned brick wall. The head eventually calmed down but can be awakened very easily. (As you can see, I'm easily amused by playful objects)
Nose was of cloves, banana (less than the cloves). Character was neither too sweet nor too lactic. Occassionally, a detected tiny bit of bubblegum ester creeps. Taste was beautifully of wheat, cloves, and a tinge of hops and lemon. Had a light and thin taste, but in the best way possible for a hefe-weisse, and was topped off by a great tasting yeast close to a light nutmeg flavor. The mouthfeel was a sharp spritzy action all over, topped off by a short finish with a a gentle but hearty yeasty-hoppy-creamyblend of an aftertaste. 
Way too drinkable, yet has tons of body and heartiness. Cannot drink one, wont appreciate it until youve had, at least, two, an easy thing to do. It would be MUCH better if you could get it much quicker and fresher in America, as I'm sure it loses some of its best qualities since hefe-weizens don't sit or travel well. 
Addendum: funny thing is, its even better on tap than in the bottle - that keg has traveled! 1,409 charactersnomad, Apr 08, 2003

A thick, creamy, full head tempts you to sample what lies beneath. Aromas of citrus, bananas, and sweet malted wheat pull you in even further.

It's a beautiful blonde/orange color and very hazy. The head is off-white and enormous. Cloves, yeast, and bananas come through in the pleasant aroma. Zingy carbonation feel on the tongue hits at first, and then an extraordinary smoothness follows. Sweet malts, yeast, cloves, and bananas are all a part of the very enjoyable taste. This is very highly drinkable, a perfect session beer and very refreshing. 489 charactersAudioGilz, Feb 22, 2003

Wonderful yeastiness, bubblegum fragrance out shines the banana, a whisper of clove. Glowingly balanced taste with well-placed flavor more banana is found on the palate, slight bubblegum, almost no clove but solid wheaty-maltiness. Faint mustiness. Pleasing mouthfeel, this is a very enjoyable quaff. Slightly sweet yet mildly tart finish. Probably the best Hefe-Weizen on the planet. World Class very much recommended why just drink this in the summer? 559 charactersbditty187, Feb 12, 2003

Many of them seem to be eating the same thing. You ask the person at a food stall , What is everone eating and drinking? The response is simple- weisswurst und hefe weizen. The
beer is poured in a tall,large glass with a thick, billowy head pouring over the side. The nectar is a deep golden,cloudy brew with a cascade of bubbles from top to bottom. It sounds like a bowl full of rice crispies as it snaps,crackles,and pops in the glass.The beer smells of bananas,cloves,buble gum and bready yeast.
The flavors that you can detect are lemon,vanilla, spicy bread and a little malt sweetness. It has a nice crisp mouthfeel that has a little oiliness to it (from oats?) This is a nice proud wheat beer- a benchmark of the style for some, for you, a great escape from the wanderings of a tourist.A rejuvination of the body.You're ready to continue onward. 1,000 charactersjeffboo, Feb 06, 2003

Nice foamy head that unfortunately settles quickly and leaves little lazing. It smells fresh and fruity. The taste is also very fresh and fruity and quite sweet, but I dont really like it fully, it's good but it doesn't really float my boat. The carbonation is lying on the border of medium to light. This is quite a good beer though even though it's not one of my favourite types of beer. 442 charactersRocko, Feb 02, 2003

The typical clove and banana esthers are heavy in this brew, as is a wonderful malty flavor. Sweet yeasts. Creamy mouthfeel and a smooth, crisp finish. There are no surprises here, just a perfectly crafted German Hefe-Weissbier.
This beer surpasses the Franziskaner hefe and ranks right up there with Paulaner's. Worldclass. 487 charactersDerKaiser, Jan 30, 2003
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Hazy medium golden color with an extraordinarily large white cloudtop head, moderate and natural appearing carbonation, lots of stickly lace. The head exhibits extraordinary retention. 
Aroma: Consists of the prototypical cloves and ripe bananas that define this style. 
Taste: Begins with lots of soft carbonation and a quite full bread malt flavor and lots of yeast, towards the middle of the taste the clove and ripe banana flavors assert themselves. At the end of the taste some mild hops appear along with some residual malt flavor. The finish is clean and a bit dry.
Mouth feel: The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.
Drinkability/notes: While I do not particularly care for the Hefeweizen style, it must be conceded that this is a superb beer and a must try for anyone who is a serious student of world=class beer. 834 charactersPegasus, Jan 25, 2003

In the classic half liter brown bottle, stating that this is the oldest brewery in the world. Fantastic looking beer, with a thick white head, with great Belgian lace, and a cloudy orange/yellow. A pronounced aroma of yeast and bananas. Fairly well carbonated, with a smooth mouthfeel. This has the classic taste of sweet malts balanced by the yeast/banana tastes . Had a fairly clean, and somewhat sweet aftertaste. Very easy to drink and very refreshing. 608 charactersjackndan, Jan 18, 2003
4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: If you're curious what a wheat beer should look like, this is possibly the best example on the planet. A hazy, peach-colored body with dull gold edges topped with a massive, fluffy off-white head that stays around forever. Hundreds of bubbles fight their way to the top of the glass from the strong carbonation.
Smell: Very strong aroma with the traditional banana, clove, and bubblegum notes. There's a bit of spiciness in there, as well as a hearty yeasty smell.
Taste: Very full flavored with a strong malted wheat backbone. Lots of banana and clove intermingle with the spiciness, which all come together in a perfect balance. There's lots of yeast in the body, and it makes itself known on the palate. The finish is dry and clean with the alcohol just barely making it's presence known. Wheat beer perfection.
Mouthfeel: Fairly thin bodied with a dry, crisp mouthfeel that begs for another sip. It actually starts off feeling a bit creamy, then moves to dry and thin (in a good way.)
Drinkability: This is the top rung of the wheat beer ladder. I could drink these all day, every day in the summer and never tire of it. The brewery has been in the same location since 1040 and have one of the top brewing schools in the world, so trust me...they know wheat beer more than anybody. 1,309 charactersMJR, Jan 17, 2003
4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a very hazy orange-amber with a giant off-white head that slowly recedes. It almost looks like shaving cream as it fades into a rocky layer atop the beer. It was so attractive I had to take a picture of it. A thick-veined lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is bready yeast and a touch of clove and/or coriander. Smells more like the latter. Also a touch of lemon zest in the nose. The taste is superb, with again a nice breadiness, topped with fruity flavors, banana being the strongest of those, with a touch of plum or grape sweetness in the background. A touch of butterscotch adds a nice contrast to the coriander spiciness and wheat crispness on the finish. The mouthfeel is buttery yet very refreshing. Carbonation levels are perfect, providing a nice liveliness on the tongue while not getting agressive and distracting. The drinakbility is exceptional. Even with a full pint, it seemed to disappear quickly. This is a very flavorful and well balanced hefe-weizen. A very nice treat. Thanks to cretemixer for this great beer. 1,042 charactersaaronh, Jan 16, 2003

Peaks like merangue finally settle until the cloudy straw colored brew's carbonation keeps it fed at about a quarter inch. Malty, yeasty, earthy. Aroma of cloves dominates. Creamy mouthfeel and on the higher end of carbonation. Slightly dry and very flavorful, peppery notes, clove and banana. Finishes strong and satisfying, nice and mellow. 447 characterscretemixer, Jan 13, 2003

If you like Hefe-Weiss beers then there is no way, you cannot love this beer. If you're not a huge wheat beer fan though I might recommend yu steer clear as the taste can be strong for the typical "Miller Lite" drinker. It's avery smooth beer, with strong tastes of wheat, nuts, and clover... and should be at the top of anyone's list who is a fan of Paulaner, Edleweiss, Tucher, Hacker-Pschorr, Franziskaner and the like! 622 charactersmikes2923, Jan 10, 2003

Cloudy golden yellow to soft orange color. Creamy, foamy, full off-white head. Inviting smells of soft citrus, bananas, sweet malted wheat. Very very inviting. Taste is perfectly balanced for a hefe. Rich banana taste, subtle citrus flavors, and very faint florals. Banana and yeasty, malted wheat sweetness linger, but a crisp refreshing finish wins out. Medium bodied, creamy and super smooth. One of the best of it's style. The ultimate thirst quencher. Please seek it out and try it yourself. 616 charactersStevieW, Dec 24, 2002

Pours a cloudy copper with a beautiful foamy head that leaves some lace down the glass. The head retained at 1/4 inch for well over 20 minutes (it took a lot of willpower to make this beer last that long...) Aroma and flavor are perfect... not really as sweet as some hefes I've had... bananas, cloves, wheat... blended together into the most smooth and creamy brew I can recall drinking. 
I nearly broke into tears after finishing this one... for 3 reasons:
1) This is true beer nirvana
2) I only had one bottle
3) I can't find this one in stores here (came across it in a special "Beers of the World" pack in a Costco) 827 characterszerk, Dec 24, 2002

Lightly sweet on the start, the top middling to thin in feel, the finish is perfectly carbonated, pertinently hopped, dry linger aftertaste.

The aroma displays a distinct "German" maltiness (obviously decoction mashed) and lots of phenols. There's some fruitiness with some banana and clove in the background, and a bit of 'plastic' as well. The body is light-medium but very creamy with a tight, crisp effervescence from natural conditioning. The flavor starts with malt backed by a light clove, displays its bolder phenols across the middle (burnt plastic), and then a quick light hop note towards the end of the palate which dissolves in softly sweet banana notes in the finish. The balance of sweetish malt, aggressive phenols, and very light hop and bitterness is sublime. The banana and clove are well restrained - subtle - but present. Extremely refreshing and enjoyable. A fine example of the style. 871 charactersNeroFiddled, Aug 18, 2002

This is one of the better hefeweizens around. 365 charactersryanocerus, Aug 07, 2002
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a decently cloudy golden/orange color with a thick white head that disipates too quickly for a hefe.  Not as many fruity tones in the aroma as others in the style but that isn't neccessarily a bad thing.  Some lighter banana and cloves with huge vanilla aromas.  Again in the flavor there isn't as much banana as in others.  Very light cloves and tons of vanilla again.  Nice heavy yeaty mouthfeel but it is almost a little too thick.  The slightly cloying qualities that the strong vanilla flavors impart make this a bit less drinkable than its brethren.  Yet another good german hefe, this isn't one that I would seek out as I liked some of the others better but it is still a great brew. 696 charactersMurph, Aug 02, 2002

This is a full, thick hefe-weizen. Not heavy, but not as light and frothy as some others you will find - this is in the realm of Schneider Weisse, a bit more serious than some Paulaners and Franziskaners you will find. Truly wonderful, bread-crust maltiness is set afloat by banana flavors coming from the yeast. A nice balance. Hops come at the finish and round the beer out in an incredibly appetizing way, coaxing you to take another sip. The fresh champagne sparkle and chewy mouthfeel sets this beer into the stratosphere. Top notch hefe. 665 charactersThrasher, Jul 03, 2002
4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5An absolutely impressively thick, white, dense and well retained head tops a light orange hazy brew w/ copious bubbling.  The assertive but clean German wheat yeast esters are comprised of the expected bubblegum, light banana, a hint of clove but when combined with the sweet malt notes is quite reminescent of a banana split.  Tart wheat notes become perceptible as the beer warms.  This beer exhibits excellent balance all around.  Yeast esters, although quite prominent, do not dominate the flavor profile and allow the rich, almost chewy malt backbone that consists of pleasant sweetness and an unexpectedly mild toasty malt to add complexity to thiis brew.  Hop bitterness is just a touch above the norm, and provides an excellent contrast to the malt flavors and sweetness.  This brew finishes w/ an enjoyable sweetness followed by a bit of mustiness from the yeast.  The overall flavor is less estery and cleaner than most German wheats, but there's a superlative balance between flavor contributions from the yeast, barley malt, wheat and hops.  Just as drinkable as Paulaner, but with more character all around.  Excellent. 1,132 charactersmarc77, Jun 18, 2002

This is one damn good Hefe! I sampled this in the past on tap, and was not overly impressed. My feeling now is that the tap version I had was not properly stored/served. 
The pour produced a cloudy, dull golden colored bier, with an endless stream of bubbles rising to the top. The head was a 2-3" billowy, white mass, leaving nice lacing in the glass.
The aroma jumps right at you with a yeasty sharpness, and plenty of clove and banana. Very nice!
The body was about a medium, and it was fairly smooth, even with the high level of carbonation present. 
Malty sweetness first hits the palate, followed by an abundance of banana and clove. A spicy bite at the finish and a pleasant long-lasting aftertaste round things out.
This bier is a keeper! Prosit!!

On-tap review from 18MAY02...
Had this on draft. The color on this baby seemed a bit odd: a yellow-golden color, rather than just golden. Was cloudy, with a tiny head and no lace. I'd expect perhaps more head produced from a bottled version. Mild nose with clove, banana and some spice evident. Good body, and nicely smooth on the palate. Enjoyable flavor, with some citrus, banana, some yeast and clove present. Nice bier. I drank this right after the Franziskaner Hefe, and I thought the Spaten product better on this day. (3.5/4.0/4.0/4.0/4.0 = 3.90) Prosit!!

4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 12 oz sleek euro brown bottle with the boasting words &#8220;Oldest Brewery in the World&#8221; on the label, freshness date is on the back label.
Appearance: Cloudy with a murky orange colour, the head is spectacular &#8230; dense and rocky with stickiness all over the glass.
Smell: Malted wheat sweetness, mild spicy nose with yeast and light lemon highlights.
Taste: Malted wheat and barley in the raw, earthy yeast character with hints of lemon in the backround. A quick spark of clove hits the same time as the carbonation. Semi crisp with a medium body and a well structured carbonation. Minimal hop bitterness, maltiness is cracker like and gets drier and drier towards the end. Nutty flavours from the yeast and very faint fennel character from the phenols come through. Finish is quite clean and alcohol is a tad noticeable though the extravagant fruity side of the esters associated with this style is held at bay and more spiciness seems to take hold.
Notes: One of the best in the world needless to say, it still lives up to its name. A wheat beer at its best. 1,099 charactersJason, Jan 22, 2001
