Taste, decadent, amazing.  Thick ass chocolate malt, bourbon heavy notes, plenty of rich coffee.  Mild oak.  Love the mouthfeel and how it covers up the massive abv relatively speaking.  Carbonation on point, some vanilla creeps in as well with the coffee.  
I might like this as much as Black Tuesday, but the increase of $10 price wise just because there is coffee is a little befuddling.  I mean, its an awesome beer, but I don't understand why the variants are $10 more. . . 678 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 14, 2017

A 2017, but i have a few bottles that i plan to open at different times in the coming years.  This was an opportunity to try it fresh as I've been told the coffee taste tends to drop off the longer a bottle ages.
You have to understand & enjoy Black Tuesday in order to appreciate this beer.  Not for the faint of heart, a beer that's best appreciated in a snifter.  People have said that it's best served not too cold, but i say pour a healthy amount into your glass right out of the fridge and sip.  Different flavors come out as it warms.  Who is to say you won't like it cold, cool, warm?  You be the judge. 655 charactersthe_Edmond, Mar 07, 2017

Mocha Wednesday 2016 bottle in a Bruery Tulip
L - Pours a dark caramel color with a fizzy khaki head that dissipates quickly
S - I get sweet caramel, molasses, and charred oak.  I don't directly smell coffee.  It smells a lot like Black Tuesday
T - The taste is sweet dark chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit, oak, with a bitter coffee finish and some heat
F - This beer is sticky, thick, and sweet.  Some good chest heat going down.
O - I see this as a slight twist on BT but find it quite a bit smoother at the same age. 537 charactersbrewaddict, Feb 16, 2017

Smells strongly of bourbon and oak. My wife can smell the alcohol on the other side of the couch
Sweet taste...brown sugar, finish with bitter coffee. Still big time booze. It's not just notes of bourbon, it's like someone dumped a shot into a stout.
Rich and thick mouthfeel. Pretty strong burn. 356 charactersTrojanRB, Jan 22, 2017

S: Sweet burnt sugars. Had some caramel. The barrels came through here. A few hint of coffee notes
T: Sweet. Sugary taste up front. Good barrel to cut through the sweetness. Bitter dark chocolate finish.
F: Syrupy mouthfeel.
O: Had this after trying DL. It honestly reminded me of the DL (maybe my palate still had some DL on it) with a good barrel characteristic to cut through the sweetness. Dangerous beer BTW. Hides the 19% very well. 461 charactersXBeerBellyT, Jan 03, 2017

When you start drinking Mocha Wednesday (in my case, the 2016 vintage), it's smooth with some sharp bourbon notes on the back end. After some time, the coffee begins to move forward, with the bourbon and chocolate notes serving as undertones. If you're like me and you split a bottle and drink it over a long stretch of time, the chocolate is front-and-center by the end.
Mouthfeel throughout drinking is warm and smooth. The aromas stay pretty consistent, with coffee being the most pronounced.
Excellent beer, but best if shared. 642 charactersJohnCassillo, Aug 03, 2016

The initial feeling was of the alcohol that immediately warmed everyone up.  The taste was a subtle coffee with more prominent chocolate, sweet flavors at first.  The finish was smoother than expected on my first sip, but really ended on a balanced note.
Overall, this was a really good Tuesday. 443 characterspezhead_79, May 19, 2016

bottled 12/14/15. appearance is black with a tan head that quickly fizzes away. 
nose is biggg... first thing I notice is the barrel, definite oak and bourbon notes. light coffee and chocolate. 
the flavors on the palate are in line with those present in the nose, but taken completely next level.... good godd this beer is ridiculously rich and delicious! sticky sweet chocolatey bourbon up front, more decadent sweetness coming through with a smooth caramel and woody vanilla. also getting some light coffee, nice dark malts, toasted wood, and more bourbon on the finish.  feel is good. overall ridiculous drinkability for the abv... I never thought a 19% beverage could taste like beer, but it does, and its absolutely fking marvelous!! 791 charactersHyptochrons, May 13, 2016

This looks and smells like a beast of a beer, which is no surprise given the ABV and what the Bruery does with their big beers. 
The big surprise for me is how much of a factor the coffee plays  here. It certainly influences the flavor and aroma, lending a burst of cold brew coffee flavor to the sweet imperial stout. But the feel, what a departure from Grey Monday and Black Tuesday. It's a lot thinner and feels like a cold brew coffee...almost. Still has enough sweetness and body to feel like a Starbucks coffee beverage. 
I did comment that I felt the beer tasted and felt like cold brew had been poured into a Black Tuesday, so long story short, that's how I'd describe this brew. 754 charactersONovoMexicano, May 10, 2016

The first phase was just loads of chocolate and coffee as one would expect.  However, unlike other beers of the same style, there was a second phase that I truly enjoyed.  Behind all the loads of flavor, I was still able to pick up the base beer.  One of my general complains about other chocolate infused stouts is that it doesn't taste like a beer.  Well, this definitely DOES taste like a beer and I am impressed in every way.  The main downside is its high ABV.  I could not pick up a hint of the booze in the taste, but I was essentially down for the count after splitting this bottle with a friend. 696 charactersnawpnawp, Apr 13, 2016

A:  Poured into a DFH snifter to a deep black beer topped by a finger of tan head that fades quickly to a small collar with minimal lacing.  Not surprising given the ABV
S:  Smells of coffee and chocolate with some underlying bourbon notes and roasted malts
T:  Taste is caramel and vanilla followed with a good bit of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts, slight oak as well.  Swallow is coffee and chocolate with some lingering oak and charred wood.
M:  Full in the mouth with surprisingly lively carbonation that's a bit prickly.  This one finishes a bit dry from the ABV
O:  Simply delicious.  I think 2014 tasted a bit better but this one isn't far behind.  Great flavors and complexity on this one so it's a joy to sip. 742 charactersSHODriver, Mar 27, 2016

A: Deep brownish color, totally opaque with a very thin tan head that quickly settles to a thin ring. 
T: Intense; mix of big robust coffee, dark chocolate and slightly sweet maltiness, mixed with a strong bourbon character, secondary vanilla flavor.  
M: Full bodied with moderately light carbonation. The beer is quite viscous and coats the tongue. While the beer hides its full strength well and is smooth, there is a bit of boozy chest warming.
O: Wow, delicious – Black Tuesday is a very full bourbon-heavy beer. This iteration adds more chocolate sweetness with a bit more robust body for the addition of coffee. A delicious beer to sip on. 721 charactersPhil-Fresh, Mar 13, 2016

Smells of fudge coated, sweeter bakers chocolate, slowly melting in the glass. Coffee adds an earthy quality together with a pleasant, flowery dryness, opening up the palate to the prominent Bourbon barrel. Oak, spices, chocolate and rock sugar blend perfectly together, not neccessarly reminding of a nearly 20 abv beer, while this certainly provides a pleasant depth on the nose.
Drinks almost flat, perfectly fitting in terms of highlighting the huge body of this, while producing a pleasant silkness, coating the tongue together with spicy oak. A vibrant barrel bite is certainly there, while it gets balanced by sweet chocolate and brownie batter, leading to an incredibly well put together beer regarding its huge body, drinking surprisingly easy, while certainly not hiding its complexity either.
Tastes of milk chocolate coated espresso beans, providing a nice sweetness, mingled into earth and toasted malts. Its barrel gets recognizable by a peppery, sharp and dry spiciness, which coates my teeth till the finish. Cinnamon adds to these flavors while Bourbon reaches an intense, palate collapsingly strong, hot peak, leading to a clean, silk and dry finish, together with toffee and earth entangled, cold brewed coffee.
Drinks way more full-bodied than the nose revealed, finding its most convincing strengh in its balance. Many other of the big Bruery stouts are too over the top for my palate to be enjoyable, this one is different though. It features a well put together mix of coffee, spicy Bourbon and melting chocolate, with every ingredient benefiting from each other. For a stout in this abv range its mouthfeel is surprisingly thin though, offering an interesting contrast to the intensity of the taste. 1,900 charactersaleigator, Mar 05, 2016

A:  Pitch black, as expected. Thin mocha-colored (obviously) head which dissipates quickly. Small amounts of carbonation are visible with no lacing.
S:  Strong espresso with blended tones of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, roasted malt, etc. 
T:  Follows suit with the smell/aromas. Any residual sweetness of Black Tuesday is muted by the espresso/coffee and chocolate notes. This reminds me of a dessert beer... brownies and coffee combined.
F:  Full bodied and somewhat heavy with low carbonation, but that is to be expected. 
O:  Overall, I a very glad to have the opportunity to try this. This is a very unique beer and definitely worth checking out. Cheers! 723 characterstregan_20, Feb 09, 2016

Consumed: 2.5.16
A: 4.5 Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a bit of reddish-amber mixed in. The small, tan head only lasts 30 seconds or so, leaving no lacing, but some legs streaking down the glass.
S: 4.75 So much freshly ground coffee hits the nose first followed closely by some of the same elements of Black Tuesday: caramel, raisins, vanilla, and bourbon. The chocolate is subtle, but as it shows up it blends seamlessly into the coffee aromas. 
T: 4.5 Taste is very similar to the nose with strong coffee. At first it’s almost too much, but as the bourbon, vanilla, and raisin flavors kick in it all starts to even out. Chocolate and raspberry linger on the finish giving a chocolate truffle flavor I’ve only experienced with BCBCS. 
M: 4.5 Nice body and carbonation with a bit of a boozy finish. Surprisingly drinkable for the strength. 
O: 4.5 This is a really nice variation on Black Tuesday. The coffee adds a bit of roast that is missing in normal Black Tuesday, but it still has the freshness that few other coffee stouts can achieve (like Cellarmaker’s bourbon barrel aged imperial coffee and cigarettes). 1,177 charactersTele, Feb 06, 2016

Given a few months to rest, this beer should be a perfect pair to a rich dessert. 360 charactersfrasergrove, Jan 24, 2016

4.36/5  rDev -1.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Barry last night.
This one pours a deep black, with really no head or lacing.
Smells like much of the big Bruery stouts- big and bold and brash. Smells like concentrated coffee creamer, vanilla, oak, super strong bourbon, caramel, and charred malt.
This is much in the style of other similar Bruery stouts, but it's one of the better ones. It's got a such a huge coffee flavor, super sweet and creamy, with lots of vanilla, charred oak and charred malt, sugary syrup, and a bit of booze- way less than I'd expect for a beer of this magnitude.
This is pretty creamy, with a syrupy mouthfeel, and a lower level of carbonation. It's surprisingly not that boozy, which is definitely nice. 705 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 17, 2016

S- aroma of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, light bourbon, wood & alcohol
T- big and boozy up front with tons of dark chocolate sweetness, followed by dark roast coffee flavor that adds some earthy/herbal notes.  The bourbon notes kick in mid-palate, adding some woodsy notes as well.  More chocolaty sweetness takes over and continues into the finish with a boozy linger
M- thick-yet slick body with low carbonation leads to a mouthfeel that coats the tongue and lingers with an alcohol burn
O- a massive beer that has in-your-face chocolate & coffee and is incredibly sweet.  Definitely split this on with at least two friends 809 charactersTreyliff, Dec 29, 2015

It's a black brew. The pour generated a small mocha head, that desolved quickly. The aroma is very coffee forward. Pleasantly sweet, with hints of vanilla, chocolate  and candied fruit. A little booze too. Very flavorful.... Love the coffee... Definitely some alcohol heat here, but not in a negative way. I mean, this bad boy is nearly 20%. The mouthfeel is a tad thin, but still smooth and enjoyable. Overall, it's a delicious beer, that is definitely worth seeking out. 585 charactersRoamingGnome, Nov 29, 2015

Enjoyed at the tail end of dinner, my wife had a small glass with me.   Nose is fantastic, lots of bourbon and chocolate with the slightest hint of coffee.    The taste follows almost exactly, though this 2014 bottle sadly lacked a lot of coffee flavor.   The chocolate however, was prominent and delicious.    The chocolate dominance put a unique spin on the Black Tuesday flavor.    I've had a lot of BA stouts, and this one is right there with them in every way.   An awesome experience, I hope to be able to try one fresh this coming year to get more coffee flavor.    Can't wait for my next bottle! 761 characterstmbgnicu, Oct 12, 2015

A  not quite black, thin noisy film leaves no lace, but thin little legs, looks like slow boiling motor oil sitting in the glass
S  smells like a bourbon soaked fudge and brownie, lots of coffee after a few whiffs, lots of chocolate syrup, more bourbon, lots of booze but all things considered its well managed
T  reminds me of the little coffee candies from Vietnamese restaurants, intense coffee compared to the nose, everything's intense really, heaps of barrel, chocolate, bourbon, shes massive all right, more of a liqueur then beer at this point  
M  syrupy with enough bubbles to give it some life, numbs your lips as they stick together, its hot but to be expected, hits my throat, chest, and brain instantly, I'm going to be tasting coffee tomorrow at this rate 
O  such a massive beer, everything about this one is big, not crazy complex but crazy intense 
I gotta thank kumatmebrew for the chance to try this one, not sure if I'd age this one or not if I had a second, the coffees working wonders for me 1,076 characterswordemupg, Sep 13, 2015

Pours a deep dark brown, pretty much black in the glass with a bit of khaki head that fades to a collar. Big sweet bourbon nose, vanilla and cocoa, a touch of toffee, raisins and coconut, maybe a bit of coffee. Big flavour, as expected. Bourbon is a little more subdued than the nose led, tons of barrel, quite sweet, some molasses and cocoa, and a little bit of char. Coffee and vanilla finish. Alcohol is there at cellar temp, but not in the way it should be with the crazy abv. 
Full body, a touch syrupy and sticky on the lips. Low carbonation.
I thought I could dome this bottle over the afternoon/evening but it looks like it will be a 2 day job because my wife is of little help. *hic* 903 charactersRutager, Aug 29, 2015

The adjuncts and barrel notes are outstanding but the underlying base beer is underwhelming to say the least. Not even in the same universe as the base stouts of a Mexican Cake, Huna, Bourbon County etc...With the ABV, his beer has gimmicky written all over it. Based on the reviews, I'm in the minority, but I can't imagine forking over hundreds of dollars for the "privilege" to buy this stuff. 417 characterswcu80, Aug 16, 2015

A: Pours dark brown, basically black with a mocha brown head that settles to a thin ring and a small island and leaves a little spotty lacing. 
S: Coffee, smooth bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, a little spice, toffee, molasses. You can tell the alcohol is there but it's smooth, not harsh or boozy.
T: Smooth bourbon, vanilla, molasses, coffee, chocolate, some spice, and toffee sweetness. 
M: Full body, moderately low carbonation, drinks surprisingly smooth for how high the % is.
O: This one is a monster. I'm sure there's more going on but after a while you don't care about picking it apart, you just want to sit back and enjoy it. Big thanks to my buddy Wayne for pulling this one out of his cellar to share. 745 charactersRyanK252, Aug 06, 2015

L - Pitch black. Minimal head.

F - Thick with minimal carbonation. Not as much heat as you'd anticipate for 19.2% abv. 
O - Much smoother than Black Tuesday and hides the alcohol much better. Unfortunately, the booze/bourbon drown out most of the coffee and chocolate. I'm wondering how this one would have been 'fresh'. 450 charactersRyancthomas7, Aug 03, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The look starts with the nicely waxed, beautifully labeled bottle.  The beer is as black as my soul. Seems to draw light into it instead of just not letting it pass through. A thin mocha colored head caps it off.
Smell is intense chocolate, alcohol and coffee.  In that order.
Taste follows the nose.  It's 50% chocolate, 35%  booze and 25% coffee.  For such a high abv, the alcohol is less present than one would think.
It really coats the tongue with it's silky smoothness.  If there were little tiny people walking around on your taste buds, they'd be ice skating everywhere they needed to go.  
Overall this beer is an amazing experience.  For all of you mathmagicians out there, the taste percentages add up to 110% on purpose. It's that frikkin good! 756 characters2ellas, Jul 26, 2015

The beer came out black as night with a light mocha head that quickly disappeared.
There was a wonderful smell coming from glass of chocolate and coffee, in fact the smell 
is what I most appreciated about this beer. 
Taste wise first thing I noticed was the booziness and the bourbon feel and flavor.  Than after 
a few sips the chocolate becomes even more noticeable with a kick of coffee at the end.  
Could I drink an entire bottle in a sitting...yes!  Would I pass out afterwords....yes!  But at the end of the day this beer is meant to be shared.
This is an incredible beer and I am glad I had the chance to drink. 698 characterswarrendietrich2001, Jul 26, 2015

4.46/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown bordering jet black. Thin medium brown head, more soap bubbly than frothy. Head quickly dissipated, but to be expected. Smell the nibs, bit of coffee, bourbon works in nicely without taking over the smell. Much less booze in the smell than I expected. Bourbon is the first flavor, smacks in the face a bit with the booze. Nibs come in on the taste with the coffee providing the backbone. Carbonation is light and feels a bit cloying. Balances better with a little time. A nice sharpness on the tongue from the booze and flavors. Almost a little spicey. Def will try to get again, but will let it age a couple more years. 631 charactersHootie159, Jul 24, 2015

Still hot since it's the 2015 but the cocoa nibs shine through magnificently. Bourbon meshes nicely with the cocoa and dark fruit flavors. Super smooth with just enough light carbonation. An excellent offering from the folks at The Bruery. 341 characterscostanzo_mike, Jul 24, 2015
4.26/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Hey, I liked this one! Pitch black pour into a Black Tuesday stemless tulip, topped off with a wispy mocha head. Good aroma, dark malts, roasted coffee, creamy chocolate, bourbon and vanilla, little bit of stone fruit. Nice taste that basically reflected the nose, dark malts, oak/bourbon/vanilla, some toasted marshmallow, almond, and of course a big dose of smooth, rich coffee. Nice full body, silky mouthfeel, and actually pretty well-tamed booziness for such a hugh ABV. This was really good, but also really comparable to BCBCS, which (at least for me) is much easier to come by. I might not even be able to discern between the two in a blind tasting. This was a tasty brew and a good sipper. I think the best Bruery beer I've had. 737 charactersRifugium, Jul 21, 2015

The bourbon adds a nice sweetness and vanilla flavor to it. The 2015 was 18.6% but this is not overly boozy it is just perfect. Every coffee stout I have I always say I wish there was one that wasn't so sweet. This is the one like a dark roast black coffee spiked with a shot of fine bourbon. This is an all time favorite of mine now. 448 charactersTheBeard89, Jul 11, 2015

Boozy, but in a good way. Chocolate, coffee, cherry skin. Booze cuts the sweetness. I don't see how people can say this is sweet. Must get swept up in nay saying. Thinner than regular BT. Wishing it was thicker. Solid for a super high gravity beer.  Feel like the booze takes a little away from the overall flavor. 328 charactersDavepoolesque, Jul 08, 2015

Pours pitch black with a dark mocha head that collapses. Lacing is sticks close to the head. Thick, oily legs. Solid.
Opens chocolate, molasses and an overwhelming sweetness. Mocha, coffee and fudge in the middle with a big boozy presence. Finish is more molasses, bourbon, tobacco and oak. Aftertaste of more booze, more chocolate, more sweet soy sauce and more molasses. Sooo sweet. Good... but soooo sweet. 
Nose is outrageously boozy. Chocolate, fudge, coffee beans, molasses and lactose. Actually works very well. Deep and really rich.   
Full bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Slick, oily and hot on the palate and goes down hot and boozy. Finish is messy and sticky with a long, lingering, filmy aftertaste. Big for sure. 
This beer suffers from a big problem... it needs time to calm down the heat and the cloying sweetness but at the same time, the coffee flavors need to be retained... how? I'm not sure... but as is... this beer is just too over-the-top. 1,110 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 30, 2015

Definitely and obviously boozy, but very well-balanced between chocolate, baking spices and boozy alcohol.  Alcohol gives it a spicy burn which I rather liked.  Bold, intense flavors or semi-sweet chocolate and hint of espresso.  No hop bitterness to speak of.

This beer I had very high hopes for because I love the entire Black Tuesday Base brews. CR being my favorite. This brew stood tall and was what I expected. The smell you get coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits(raisins), and alittle vanilla. The taste was just as the smell except you could hardly taste the heat. This Brew was very well balanced and deserves to be in everyones top brews. 430 charactersShon4star, Apr 19, 2015

A - Dark brown body with small light brown lacing.
S - Intense coffee and chocolate notes with bourbon and oak in the background.
T/M - Sweet chocolate up front with coffee taking over pretty quickly.  Smokey bourbon finish with some bite in the back of the throat.  
O - Very good and I'm glad I tried one fresh, but I think the heat/flavors need to mellow/meld a bit to really make this beer top notch.  I'll leave my other one in the cellar at least a year to see if that is true.  Prost! 544 charactersBowers-Brew, Apr 18, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. Acquired in a trade with Rishi  - thank you kind sir.
Pours a deep brown, nearly black opaque body with a 2 finger mocha brown head that reduces at a medium rate to a ring of foam. LIttle lacing. 
Aromas are strong and potent but very inviting - chocolate, bourbon,  vanilla, and booze with some coffee in the background. 
On the tongue lots of complex and super delicious flavors - milk chocolate,  vanilla, butterscotch, caramel upfront - follow through is roasted coffee and some booziness (expected at this abv), finish is toasty, roasty coffee and malt and semisweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full bodied with low carbonation,  you just have to let this one warm up a little bit.
This was the last of the black tuesday variants that i had to try, and this was my favorite one thus far. Most complex of them, and the coffee/mocha character works well. Recommended. 942 charactersgcamparone, Mar 29, 2015

Pours jet black with minimal tan/brown head that leaves very little lacing. Aroma is filled with chocolate and coffee and a hint of bourbon. Taste follows suit, quite deliciously. Full bodied, thankfully not too "hot" with the bourbon. A truly outstanding beer! 296 charactersswanfungus, Mar 23, 2015

Served in a snifter
The beer poured a thin, murky brown and was topped by a tiny, khaki colored film that dropped to a lasting ringlet.
Really interesting aroma. Cacao dominated. It reminded me of sticking your nose in a bag of raw cacao nibs. Malty rich and fairly sweet. Dark fruits were noticeable. I definitely picked up raisins. Good amount of brown sugar as well. Moderately boozy. Unfortunately, no coffee was detectible.
The favor profile was somewhat less cacao dominated than the aroma but more complex overall. Dark fruits led things off. Raisins and plums were quite apparent. Loads of brown sugar. Bourbony and somewhat port-like. Good dose of vanilla. Cacao nibs were noticeable. Like the nose, there was no discernible coffee presence. The finish was boozy but surprisingly tame for an 18.2% ABV monster. Raisin notes lingered after the swallow.
The mouthfeel initially seemed a bit thin for a beer of this magnitude, but it turned super smooth and creamy on the palate. A fine, moderate effervescence gave the liquid a rich, supple, tongue blanketing quality.
After trying samples of Black Tuesday, Chocolate Rain and Mocha Wednesday over the last week, I felt this beer was the least impressive of the three variants. Regardless, this is an amazingly complex and intense imperial stout that hides its alcohol prowess remarkably well. 1,404 charactersDamian, Mar 22, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25thanks to tenderbranson for sharing this by way of stakem, enjoyed chilled from the bomber in a stout glass and allowed to gradually reach cellar temp.
The color is black with slight cola appearance with light tan head and quick dropping head with no lace left sticking -clarity is translucent. The aroma has a strong cocoa odor with light coffee smell that is roasty with an earthy nose and moderately alcoholic smell. The feel is roasty with sweet body and gently creamy element with a low bitterness level and relatively high warming presence of alcohol as it finishes semi-sweet.
The taste is very good with toasted nut and slight roasted coffee taste with a dark chocolate taste in the middle with slight yeast flavor with a mild alcohol backing up the rich malt in the taste and actually less boozy than the nose lets on with the combo of cocoa and coffee giving a dessert-like sweet residual flavor in the finish. Overall I think I enjoyed this less when cold, but as it warms the coffee seems to express itself more and alcohol settles down a bit. I would not have had the chance to try this otherwise so thanks Tim! I would consider this preferable to chocolate rain personally I like the layers the coffee and cacao add to the stout base. 1,250 charactersSlatetank, Mar 15, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A: Was surprised to be greeted with a decent amount of foam off the pour, although this receded quickly.  A rim of mocha head sticks around the edge of the glass as I sip, but no lacing to speak of.  Alcohol legs on the swirl.  Pitch black.
S: Has the characteristic Black Tuesday nose, but the presence of the coffee and chocolate also make subtle contributions.
T: Wasn't sure what to expect from the coffee, particularly given the coffee was farily subtle on the initial nose.  Was really impressed on my first sip how front and center the coffee is, followed by a chocolate and sweet roast backdrop.  Makes for a markedly distinct drinking experience relative to the base beer.  For how hefty the ABV is, the alcohol presence is fairly subdued.  Masked more so than several other BT varieties.
M: This is a huge beer with plenty of body to back it up.  Chewy and viscous, leaving an oil slick on the tongue.
O: Another tremendous offering from The Bruery.  I'm a big fan of the entire BT series and have historically found the variants add something unique to the base beer experience.  That is the case again with this beer.  Huge fan of what the coffee does for the drinking experience.  Probably one of the better variants in my opinion. 1,248 charactersdbc5, Mar 11, 2015

A:  A dark, sludgy brown in appearance, oily and viscous.  The beer's weight doesn't allow any type of head to form.
S:  The nose is really similar to Black Tuesday, with accents of coffee and carob at the front of the bouquet.  Accompanied by usual notes of burnt sugar, oaky astringency and unsweetened chocolate.
T:  The flavors wave over the palate in three distinct phases.  At the front, cocoa, vanilla, along with subtle notes of cinnamon and ancho chilies.  Mid-sip, the booze kicks in, which you'd expect given the ABV, but it's not as overwhelming as it could be.  Oak dries and adds astringency, along with hops.  Added coffee comes though as well, but this is not a 'coffee stout', thankfully.  As it finishes, distinct notes of molasses and bitter-sweet chocolate become dominant, and that ancho chili note is accented by spicy booze.  Long finish with lingering notes of cocoa and bourbon.
M:  As with the other variants, as viscous and sticky as a brew comes.  
An incredible brew, I think I like this more than Black Tuesday.   Coffee beers aren't my favorite, and I was expecting this to be more coffee forward - it's not.  Coffee is just one of many flavor-nuances.  Delish. 1,256 charactersrand, Mar 10, 2015

Simply put, this smells like incredible coffee. Taste follows the nose, but includes a bite from the high alcohol and bourbon. The coffee is a bit bitter, but freaking amazing. This is so smooth and delicate. Dark fruit (blackberries) and chocolate come through as well. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Blown away yet again by this. 454 charactersBeersnake1, Feb 28, 2015

The brew streams brown but comes to rest in the glass dark brown to black with ruby clarity when held to the light. A very aggressive pour yields about a finger of khaki head that is quick to fade.
The aroma initially is very sweet with cocoa smelling almost like brownie batter. That sensation is short lived. As the brew is smelled more a lot of deep roast to char comes out smelling almost smokey like burnt popcorn. Some tangy alcohol and licorice are afterthoughts mingled with a slight vegetative component almost like green bell peppers.
The taste is bitter cacao, roasty earth, espresso and anise. A mild tang is somewhat medicinal across the middle. Solvent alcohol and a mild smoke almost like the previously mentioned burnt popcorn character is noticed mid-palate. Across the finish is a perplexing flavor almost like soy sauce. This is quite weird for that to be present in a beer this fresh. As it warms up, it has a mild vegetative flavor almost like bell peppers. 
This is full bodied and lightly carbonated. An interesting twist on black tuesday but something seems weird in this. I dont know if its the coffee or cacao but im not crazy about it. This just doesnt deliver the flavor profile like it seems it should. Not a terrible beer but also not what I was expecting either. 1,365 charactersstakem, Feb 19, 2015

Much better fresh - huge freshly ground coffee both earthy and fruity, heavy fresh roast, very sweet booze, chocolate, faint bourbon and sweet vanilla. Massive feeling beer, coats the mouth with sweet boozy chocolate and vanilla, coffee is very dominant.  All comes together very well for being such an extreme pour.
Another great Black Tuesday concoction.  Had a 2014 when it was about 9 months old and it wasn't anywhere near as impressive as this fresh 2015 batch.  A truly decadent beastly beer. 645 characterstimc100, Feb 16, 2015

5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Pours just like you would expect, very thick and very black. A small head forms but doesn't retain very long at all and leaves no lacing. Instead of lacing, alcohol legs are present in large numbers down the side of the glass. This beer basically looks like a still pour in the glass due to high alcohol and low carbonation.
S- Huge coffee and big, sweet chocolate greet the nostrils right up front in an assault of delicious scents. Bourbon and alcohol move in next right behind the blend of sweet chocolate and bitter coffee and add a third dimension to the smell. Summed up in one sentence, this beers smells like you just walked into a coffee house/chocolate shop/distillery combo facility.
T- Medium roasted coffee starts off the flavor of this beer with a mildly bitter and dark bang. Chocolate sweetness quickly moves in and provides the overall mocha-like flavor that the name suggests. If this beer stopped with the mixing of chocolate and coffee flavors, it would be tremendous, but it doesn't. This beer proceeds to one up itself with the addition of barrel aging. The barrel comes right after the chocolate-coffee cocktail and adds a spicy bourbon, sweet vanilla, and slightly boozy oak character to this beer. The end result is a fantastically complex and delicious, candy-like flavor explosion in your mouth. The alcohol content warms up the end of the drink and adds just a touch of bitterness to go along with the other flavors in the finish.
M- For a 19% ABV imperial stout, this is rather highly carbonated, but suspiciously easy to drink. There is definite alcohol warming as you sip, but only so much as to make you slow down and enjoy the complex flavors of the beer. Otherwise, this beer is thick and creamy and smooth as hell.
Overall, wow. Just wow. This is a phenomenal beer that has me looking into joining The Bruery's club. I need more of this in my life and cannot imagine having this fresh. One of the best beers I have ever tasted. 1,969 charactersboilermakerbrew, Feb 15, 2015

Pours dark brown with a rapidly dissipating thin mocha head which is standard for The Bruery's strong ales. There was a ton of coffee upfront along with some mild oak, dark chocolate, roasted oats, and that bourbon goodness. Oh damn! The flavor was all coffee and bourbon booze. At that point, I had wished I aged this beauty a little longer - perhaps for a year or two. I knew I was gonna be up all night with this beer and lasted me a good five hours of very nice sipping, which I paid a dear price for in a matter of hours after waking up. Thin to medium mouthfeel. There were a ton of heat especially in the back finish and incredible coffee up front which were unfortunately overshadowed by the strong fresh bourbon. Overall, this was a fine brew and glad to have tried it for once and all! 879 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 06, 2015

Appearance: Black w/ reddish reflects, no head and no lacing. 
Aroma: Cacao, massive boozy presence, paint thinner and subdued coffee notes. 
Taste: Heavy sweetness along massive alcohol are hiding cacao and coffee but you can get them a bit after the beer breathe for a long time. Light fruitiness too. 
Palate: Full body. Moderate carbonation. Liquorous mouthfeel. Burning finish. 
Overall: Like most other The Bruery stouts, it’s tasty and flavorful but also terribly unbalanced and undrinkable because how the sweetness and the alcohol takes all the place. It’s not impossible to make great super high abv stouts, Struise are able to, but this is not good. 726 characterstom10101, Feb 03, 2015

Strong coffee in the nose ( a bit to strong),  some nuttiness, a little caramel.
Flavor starts with strong coffee, giving way to dark fruit (raisin), with a caramel, chocolate finish. Some alcohol burn in the finish which fades a bit with oxidation. 265 charactersjohn0721, Feb 01, 2015

Appearance: Very dark brown with a modest beige head which dissipated fairly quickly. The head on this beer was larger and hung around longer than any of the Black Tuesday's or variants that I've had.  This fixed my biggest gripe with Black Tuesday and/or it's variants.  Considerable legs on this one.
Smell: Upfront coffee followed by Bourbon, brown sugar, chocolate/cocoa, mild vanilla, and a bit of coffee/roasted malt aroma. nice nose on this one.
Taste: As the nose suggested coffee, Bourbon, raisins, vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate, and some oak/roast malts appearing in the finish along with the coffee notes. The upfront coffee helps to subdue the sweetness of the base black Tuesday and helps the drink-ability.  Very mild alcohol presence especially in light of the 18.6% ABV . Nice barrel presence and flavor complexity.   Fairly sweet in the middle of the swallow but the finish is surprisingly dry finishing with the coffee notes which appear to be a smooth roast.
Mouth-feel: Medium bodied, fairly thin for such a big beer but the significant ethanol presence has something to do with that.  The carbonation is moderate and spot on for the beer.  It's scary the beer has such a lack of an alcohol presence for the ABV.
Overall: Great beer.  The coffee is well integrated and along with the cacao nibs tame the sweetness from the base Black Tuesday.  Nice complexity in the flavor profile.  My favorite coffee stout at the moment. 1,463 charactersIKR, Jan 31, 2015

Not just a coffee nose, but actually smells like a cup of cold brew. Really great aroma. Taste is much of the same, just a big sweetened coffee bomb. Lots of chocolate and oak in the back end. Really nice for the alcohol content. Mouthfeel is really smooth with some slight alcohol burn. Might need to rest for 3 months. Nice work, Bruery! 406 charactersThePaleRider, Jan 26, 2015

Big thanks to ChewbaccaSD for sending this one over in a trade!
A: Opaque black, some browning on the edges, less than 1/2 a fingers width of bubbly light tan colored head builds then dissipates quickly, leaves essentially zero lacing but some alcohol legs.  4.25
S: Holy coffee bomb.  Lots of bold black coffee.  Paired with the coffee are roasted malts and a boozy alcohol. Barrel notes with bourbon vanilla and charred oak.  Maybe a touch boozy even for my liking, but very nice.  4.25 
T: Wow delicious.  Big flavors here.  Tons of sweetness, which is paired with a black coffee bitterness and a big fusel alcohol character.  Chocolate characters much more noticeable in the taste than the aroma.  Big roasted malt characters as well.  Kind of tastes like a boozy BCBCS with chocolate, obviously this is a huge compliment.  Wonderful.  4.75
M/D: Full body but not quite thick, carbonation appropriately low, ABV is most certainly noticeable and its even a bit hot at times; then again it is 18.6% ABV so thats somewhat to be expected.  Drinkability is surprisingly good all things considered. 4.25 
O: Wonderful beer, no doubt about it.  I’ve now been fortunate enough to try BT, GM, CR, and MW.  Out of the 4, I think Chocolate Rain was my favorite, but this is probably number two.  The bitter coffee and fusel ethanol notes cut the sweetness quite nicely and make for a fantastic beer.  Glad I was able to try this one, thanks Chewb!  4.5 1,495 characterszac16125, Jan 26, 2015

Pours a decent fizzy smaller but darker color that fades pretty quickly, pitch black beer with great legs, long legs. 
Nose brings a huge amount of dark malts, tons of cocoa fudge and mocha, cocoa dust with fudgey mocha, a little roasty and light char, lots of dark caramel, some dark coffee with the cocoa, nice sweet mocha coffee almost expensive kahlua, fluffy nougat and fudge caramel coffee. 
Taste brings lots more sweet chocolate, caramel cocoa, with lots of thick fluffy fudge, cocoa dust, etc. Then coffee, light on the coffee but a nice roasty coffee mocha with fudge and cocoa syrup, again light kahlua like flavor, coffee cocoa fudge with dark roasty malts. Big booze, maybe not 20% or so but def boozy, warming tingly booze and some hot alcohol flavors, big candy sweetness too go with it. Finish is sweet and hot, sticky syrupy sweet, with hot alcohol lingering, and very fudgey kahlua coffee fudge, etc. 
Mouth is fuller bod, decent carb, thick syrupy and hot booze. 
Overall a big letdown, ok but decent. 1,044 charactersjlindros, Jan 10, 2015

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with hardly any head, just real wisps and nice legs.
S - Aromas of loads of chocolate, malts, chocolate good roast, nice and fudgy. Nice vanilla and barrel notes. Really aromatic.
T - Taste is sweeter than the base beer, the chocolate was a little soft, the booze is strong, the coffee is good and roasty, nice vanilla and barrel. Really boozy and hot which distract from the overall beer. Awfully sweet, almost cloyingly so.
M - Mouthfeel is sticky sweet, cloyingly so. Still hot and boozy, drinks more like black Tuesday than chocolate rain.
O - Overall this beer was a bit of a let down. Even moreso when compared to chocolate rain. Again, while good it was actually a let down. The whole is less than the sum of it's parts.

A: Pour resembles a dark brown/mocha, but sits closer to an impervious black; accompanied by a faint, off-white head, little retention, and next to no lacing.
S: A beer of this gratitude will most likely always have a boozy presence; nonetheless, a good portion remains undetected…fairly smooth, considering the ABV. Nice aroma of caramel, chocolate, cocoa, fudge, slight vanilla, malt, espresso, and nuts of sorts
T: Essence is thick of cocoa, chocolate, espresso, vanilla, sweet slight brown sugar, and bourbon. Similar to the nose, nuts and fruit can be detected in here too.
M: A hearty one: Thick, heavy, full bodied and medium amounts of carbonation
O: Yes, there is a portion of the ABV that is noticeable, but it’s expected. What’s not expected is how well the rest of it is hidden, underneath the rest of the craziness…Great brew with lots going on 881 charactersM-Fox24, Dec 23, 2014

(A)- Pours thick and pitch black as night in color. Minimal brown colored froth
(S)- Big and rich cocoa meets gobs of vanilla and booze. Slight peppery hint on the back end from a coffee ground aspect
(T)- Huge richness. Enormous rich and sweet chocolate meets caramel and oaky vanilla with a dusting of coffee. In alot of ways, this reminds me of a hot fudge and caramel sundae
(M)- Thick, viscous, and instant cavity sweet. Great stout characters turned up to 11+ with a massive 19%ABV
(O)- There is no denying this is a great stout but for my tastes, this is on another level of sweet, rich, and boozy for me to fully enjoy it. So glad this was split among 5 guys 701 characterssweemzander, Nov 19, 2014

The smell of the beer just bombards your nose with chocolate and barrel aged aromas, smell insanely rich. The taste is just as chocolaty with a hefty amount of boozy heat in there too. The feel is thick, but has some heat to it. Overall it was a fun beer to try but probably won't seek out again due to the price tag. 385 charactersKnapp85, Nov 17, 2014

From a 750 into a snifter
Vintage: 2014
Chocolate Rain with coffee added
APPEARANCE: Slow foamer upon opening. Once it calmed though, it basically looked like all the other variants. A very transparent, thin, and relatively light brown pour yields a thin, loose, bubbly, off-white head with lousy retention. Head quickly fades to a thin ring, which eventually vanishes as well. Looks flat by the end and absolutely no lacing at all. Much too thin and transparent for the style as well. Very disappointing. Same as Chocolate Rain, but clearly worse than older vintages of the Black Tuesday. 
SMELL: Lots of burnt coffee beans here, with cocoa powder and boozy Black Tuesday underneath. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, spicy alcohol and burnt coffee beans with a touch of cocoa in the distance. Rather nice in its entirety and I appreciate the balance of all these face-slapping aromas. 
TASTE: Big and boozy with lots of burnt coffee and espresso beans up front. The coffee is actually quite prevalent and cuts through the sweet base beer and barrel presence. Cocoa nibs are there as well at the swallow, moving into a big and boozy finish of bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet dark fruits, coconut, cocoa powder and  a dose of bitter mocha coffee for good measure. This is very assertive and the flavors lingers forever on the palate. Lots of sweetness and hot boozy flavors, but the mocha addition adds some nice bitterness that really cuts the sweet barrel and adds a good deal of balance to this one. Quite well conceived and executed. 
PALATE: Same as GM but perhaps a touch lighter. Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A bit prickly on the palate, not as smooth as hoped, though it is 19% I guess, goes down okay with a burn at the swallow and finishes sticky. Some decent heat lingers as well. A bit prickly and airy in the mouth and too light for the style. Could be thicker, heavier and smoother, but other brews at this level of ABV have been worse. 
OVERALL: This is quite the treat, I must admit. Black Tuesday is a sweet, boozy brew, and its variants to this point have added more sweet character that, admittedly, manage to compliment Black Tuesday in a round-about kind of way. This one, however, adds a dimension of bitterness to Black Tuesday that seems to cut the sweet, boozy profile and provide a counterpart that measures up to the beast. It’s still boozy, as are all the variants, and could use some time to mellow out perhaps, but fresh, this might be the best variant out of the gate yet. Thanks again for the bottles guys. Very much enjoyed this one. 2,718 charactersJeffo, Nov 09, 2014

Smell: nutmeg, hazelnut, mocha, chocolate, coffee and cream. some blackened malt. alcohol
Taste: opens with a light coffee, ranging from hazelnut to mocha and coffee with cream. spices come in fairly strong behind with nutmeg. some dark fruit and malty depth in the background. alcohol is always present and makes itself known from time to time.
Mouthfeel: heavy, boozy, coffee to roasted malt bitterness.
Overall: glad I got to try it in a good setting, where I got a decent sized pour. this is not something I'd go way out of my way for but as far as a 19% beer with all this spice and coffee. its not bad at all 837 charactersSportsandJorts, Oct 23, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%Shared by Lunch. Thanks Paul.
The beer has a similar appearance to the others in the Black Tuesday series. Aromas of huge roast, chocolate, cacao, vanilla, coffee, oak, booze. Huge flavor. Thick bodied with fairly low carbonation. Coffee and bourbon with chocolate. Mild bitterness. Such a gargantuan beer. Chocolate and booze. Mild sweetness and palate coating. Yum. 368 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 09, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25750 mL bottle served at 50F into a HF wine glass. Shared w/Brewinsue
A: As expected, pitch black. When held up to the light, only the faintest deep reddish-brown hues penetrate te edges of this bee. Thin Mocha colored head (1/2") dissipates quickly. Swirling won't revive it and this beer peaes no lacing in the glass. Tiny carbonatin bubbles are visible.
S: Roasted malt and strong rich espresso with blended tones of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, pecans/pralines and toffee. So different from the base beer ad the other BT treatments.
T: Mimics the nose. The nearly overpowering residual sweetness of BT is muted by the coffee and chocolate notes. Fresh baked brownies and a cup or coffee...this is truly a decadent dessert beer. The richness is fantastic, and the balance of bourbon and esperesso on the finish is lovely. Clean with just a touch of leftover sugar on the tongue.
M: Full bodied and heavy with medium-low carbonation, but that is to be expected. Slick, this beer coats your tongue and mouth. Not unpleasant though...and it grows on you.
O: Really wishing they bottled this in those 8 oz. bottles that Anchor used to use for Old Foghorn to justify a single serving. Very glad to have the opportunity to try this and I will be happy to share my remaining bottles with friends and family. Unique to be sure and though my taste falls to lambic, gueuze and saison of late, this is not to be missed. 1,424 charactersF2brewers, Aug 05, 2014

Pours dark murky brownish black with a very small khaki brown head on top that goes away quickly. Awesome chocolate and huge nutty coffee aroma, more nuttiness, caramel and molasses, brown sugar, toffee nuts, pralines, coffee, bourbon booze. Fantastic. Flavor is sweet caramel and brown sugar, nutty toffee, lots of lingering vanilla, some chocolate, light earthy coffee notes but very subdued on that front, bourbon and alcohol for sure but actually surprisingly smooth. Note nearly as sweet as Chocolate Rain for me. Comes off with some serious tiramisu flavor with extra booze, which is awesome. As with Grey Monday this really comes off like an English barleywine to me. There doesn’t seem to be a lot of stout characteristic left here. Big rich body with lowish carbonation, smooth on the palate with light burn and plenty of warmth on the way down. Really nice variant. 946 charactersBMMillsy, Jul 16, 2014

S: Roasted malt and coffee up front. Chocolate and sweetness in the middle, and finishes with the barrel. Wood, vanilla, bitter bakers chocolate lingers. Big, billowing, and what you would expect for the series.
T: Like the nose, everything about this is big. Roasted malt, coffee, bakers chocolate, and huge barrel character. Wood and vanilla. Lingering bitter coffee and bitter chocolate.
M/D: Like the others, a huge viscous body that is low on the carbonation. Intense, and brooding, but enjoyable for a few ounces.
I Honestly think there are much more enjoyable options easier to get, and often for me, locally made. I can actually get through more than a few ounces with this one though. Glad to tick it, but I am not seeking this out. 841 characterschamp103, Jul 05, 2014

A- Pours an opaque black with a finger of off-white head. This recedes to a collar, leaving minimal lacing.
S- Incredibly sharp espresso-like coffee and alcohol. It's almost like someone stuck an alcohol soaked coffee bean in your nose! Tons of fudge along with some bitter roast. A good bit of toasted oak and bourbon. Sweet brown sugar and some caramel round out this rich and complex aroma.
T- Wow! This tastes even better than it smells! This is an explosion of wondrously rich coffee and fudge. It's like drinking espresso brownies if they were liquefied. There's roast, there's sweetness, there's sufficient, but not overwhelming booze. This beer does exactly what it wants to do perfectly!
M- The mouth feel is medium to thick, slightly creamy, finishing with dry espresso beans and a bit of warming booze.
O- This is a beer that executes perfectly what it set out to accomplish! It's a glorious imperial stout imbued with loads of coffee and just enough chocolate to balance it out. The booze was present, but barely noticeable considering the 19.2% abv. While the mouth feel could have been a bit thicker, it was definitely thicker and creamier than other variants of Black Tuesday. A masterpiece! 1,241 charactersSadMachine, Jun 24, 2014

The beer hits of lots and lots of bitter cacao nib, with a pop of coffee in the middle, and then that signature sweetness from Black Tuesday. The adjuncts hide the barrel quite much.
I prefer Chocolate Rain, even though I expected to like this beer more because Black Tuesday is a perfect beer for coffee. There is just something about the coffee here that is not quite there, but still a fine beer. 474 charactersdar482, May 19, 2014
4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This bottle is approximately 6-months old
The beer is about as dark as Black Tuesday with some oily dankness and sediment, but little residual oil and no head. The nose is potent coffee upfront which has a slightly woody sweetness and minimal booze. The beer taste is chocolate sweetness upfront with a relatively un-bitter coffee presence in the finish. The mouthfeel is not thick and chewy, but masks the booze very well. This is definite an improvement compared to BT and I even prefer this variant more than chocolate rain, though I would have preferred to have it a bit fresher. 583 charactersThePorterSorter, May 19, 2014

A- Looks just like Black Tuesday. Dark black body, opaque, minimal offwhite head with little retention, no lacing.
S- Sweet sugar, cocoa nibs, dark chocolate, fudge jumps out first. There is a slight coffee flavour, as well as wet barrel oak. This is honestly a very chocolate fudge forward nose, which I'm very happy to enjoy. 
F- Very sweet and sugary base beer, but the cocoa nibs initially contribute a nice dark chocolate character with a nice bitterness that goes at least part of the way to cutting the sugariness of the base beer. Make no mistake, this is a very sweet beer. As it warms, the coffee comes forward with that similar damp coffee oak flavour remniscent of Bourbon County Coffee. Throughout there is a small alcohol solvent presence, just like all of the other Black Tuesday and its variant beers.
M- Thinner bodied just like Black Tuesday and its other variants. Really a sipper due to how sweet it is, but it's a lot more manageable than the aforementioned Black Tuesday or Grey Monday. I can certainly tell this is 19.2% ABV, but this isn't exactly drinking Johnnie Walker on the rocks either.
O- I can't decide if I liked this better than Chocolate Rain, but it's close and I'd probably have to give the edge to this one. This is a very nice rendition on the Black Tuesday theme; I think the coffee and cocoa nibs combination does a better job of cutting that base Black Tuesday sweetness than anything else The Bruery has tried. 1,623 charactersStevedore, Apr 24, 2014

Taste has a nice alcohol and coffee burn upfront, with the sweetness of the chocolate coming through at the end. Thin mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Pretty hot but wouldn't think it was 19 percent. Very sweet but the other flavors do a good job in balancing it out. 355 charactersMikeypnh, Apr 23, 2014

@The Bruery
App- This was about the same as BT. Just thick, dark and viscous in the glass. A small amount of brown bubbles formed and was gone rather quickly.
Smell- When I first had a BT, I thought it was more port with a big sweetness, phenol alcohols and fruits. This was like that but the chocolate and coffee dominated the flavors. When I put my nose in the glass, I felt I was smelling a fresh roasted cup of coffee.
Taste- I felt it was okay. Its a good stout due to the base beer, but I dont think I couldve drank more than my pour that I had. The coffee was a bit too dominant and the chocolate didnt balance enough for me. A little hot and grainy. 
Mouth- Thick and viscous. A low carbonation level and was very creamy just like BT. The coffee dominates the residual flavors. 
Drink- It was a good beer. It was expected. I appreciate when someone says its a coffee beer, it should taste like coffee. This was that and was a huge beer. 1,003 charactersFosterJM, Apr 23, 2014

Score: 91
2014 vintage bottle served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass and enjoyed on 02/22/14. Review is from iPhone notes. Thank you Moe for sharing this brew with me!
Appearance: Soda pop brown in color. Virtually no head off the pour. Decent oily legs, but no head or retention. 3.5/5
Smell: Milk chocolate, fudge, roast and a little vanilla. Big booziness, but not a ton of bourbon aroma relative to the alcohol esters. Simple and boozy, but effectively appealing. 4/5
Taste: Milk chocolate, vanilla, and mild coffee flavor with a nice light bitterness that's refreshing relative to most diabetes-inducingly sweet Bruery stouts. Still, despite this bitternes, this beer is still awfully sweet. Boozy, but more bourbon character than the nose and less sheer alcohol. I thought this was tasty, but it is a sweet sipper that is probably best enjoyed in small doses. My four ounce pour was sufficient for a lifetime. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation. Not cloying or nearly as sweet as Black Tuesday, but its on the sweeter side of stouts. 3.75/5
Overall: A really solid stout, but certainly not as good as its reputation would indicate. I prefer Chocolate Rain to this, but felt Mocha Wednesday was better than Grey Monday.
Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,425 charactersjegross2, Apr 23, 2014

A: Pours very dark coffee brown, some small bubbles but basically no head. 
S: Big medium-dark roast coffee, and just a touch of dark chocolate, molasses, and caramel. Coffee is decidedly dominant, and not much of the barrel character is discernible.
T: Dark cocoa balances with the coffee, more balanced than the nose. Some caramel as well. Delicious, but again, not much vanilla or oak presence.
M: Full bodied with medium carbonation. Mild to moderate alcohol burn, as with BT.
O: Delicious, big coffee aromas. Comparatively speaking, this has a little less of a coffee punch than BCBCS. I enjoyed this on par with CR, a little less than GM. A big improvement over Mocha Black Tuesday (served at 2013 Initiation Party), which was way overboard on the coffee. 868 characterspmarlowe, Apr 07, 2014

Appearance - Black, but not quite. Small, brief khaki head. Thin collar.
Smell - Bourbon, brown sugar. Coffee. Smells sweet. Vanilla.
Taste - Coffee with a little bit of acidity. Bourbon. Sweet brown sugar. Caramel diabetes. Chocolatey finish.
Mouthfeel - Heavy. Sweet. Everything I expected. Low carbonation.
Overall - The coffee is sharp, but the sugar balances it out. As always, too sweet. 435 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 01, 2014

Just a complete package with no let down in any aspect of the beer. Shared with rxeight, bryang002 and Jonnyhiggs at an impromptu beer group tasting. 
A - Viscious! This is when I start to get excited. My pet peeve is thin stouts and when I see one pour this thick I know it is a good start. 
S - Coffee and chocolate come through in alternating jabs that leave dreams of a scandalous affair between Chocolate Rain and BCBCS
T - Palate heaven. No one element get too much in front of another, the balance of the chocolate and coffee is just right. 
M - Motor oil and that is a good thing. How a BA stout should feel. Give me a milkshake stout all day. 
O - The only variant I haven't tried yet is GM, but this is superb and a notch above BT and CR, which says a lot that there is even a discernable difference. Top five beer for me, which takes great company with KBBS, MD and the Bourbon County family. 989 charactersjustlovebeer, Mar 19, 2014

Pours thick and black with a tiny pale layer that can't really be called head. No retention or lace to speak of but swirling it around a bit coats the glass with lasting, boozey legs. 
Huge coffee on the nose with strong bourbon, cocoa and booze. I can tell this is gonna be a treat. 
No denying that this drinks hot. Lots of boozey bourbon, bold coffee, rich dark chocolate, burnt caramel, molasses, cane sugar, a little bitter char and strong alcohol presence. It doesn't take me long to get over the booze burn and really enjoy the play between coffee, bourbon, chocolate and big delicious imperial stout. 
Heavy, full, syrupy body with low carbonation. Really coats the tongue well. A hot, espresso, cocoa and bourbon finish that lingers. 
A huge beer with robust flavors, this is a really tasty treatment for Black Tuesday. I'm very happy to have several to enjoy over a couple years as it develops- suspecting that the coffee is bold enough to still sit in the front seat after this had had enough time for the booze to settle down. 1,148 charactersThickNStout, Mar 01, 2014

A - Pours pitch black with a bit of filmy tan head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace what so ever on the sides of the glass. Completely lifeless for the most part.
S - Smells of gooey fudge brownies, smooth espresso coffee, vanilla, oak, dark roasted malt and warming bourbon. Booze is ever present but more hidden than some of the other variants.
T - Starts off with a quick dose of sugary sweetness, mainly the brownie batter and vanilla, quickly being joined by the smooth coffee roast and dark malts finally being joined by the oak and bourbon warmth. Finish is sweet roast with some light booze burn, lingering long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Huge, syrupy sweet feel with a mild booze burn at the end of each sip. Again the booze seems to be more hidden than in past variants.
O - This might be my favorite of the variants. It has a great mix of flavors and the booze is still there but not over the top like in the others. I would love to see how this one develops in a few years, it could end up being really special. 1,181 charactersorangesol, Mar 01, 2014

Nose is absolutely loaded with rich and robust coffee beans which pair with cacao and bourbon. Smells like decadent mocha with a huge degree of depth added by the barrels. A significant booziness comes in towards the end. Taste matches the nose, deep rich and decadent coffee notes paired with chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. Mouthfeel is thick syrupy and light in carbonation. This is definitely my favorite of the Black Tuesday family. Delicious! 554 charactershomebrew311, Feb 18, 2014

poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: black as midnight with no moon. no head to speak of after a hard pour. White ring around the glass. Really thick legs on the glass after every sip. 
Smell: Black Tuesday plus coffee grinds plus hint of jet fuel.
Taste: Sweet and boozey. Bourbon, coffee grinds, bakers cocoa, and milk chocolates.
Mouthfeel: full bodied beer with low carbonation levels. moderately boozy. Sticky and mouthcoating. At almost 20% ABV, this beer is still fairly drinkable.
Overall: This is a good varition of black tuesday, but I prefer grey monday and chocolate rain over mocha wednesday. The bruery would do really well if they could dial down the ABV to near 10% on this beer. Still enjoyable in small quantities. 772 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Feb 14, 2014

S- 1/2 Mocha 1/2 Malt. Smells very very sweet. This has more in common with GM and CR than BT with the crazy malt. 
T- The malt throws me off on this. The over 19% abv is masked a whole lot better than the other variants, but it is still a lot to handle. The mocha is definitely present. Sort of like a whipped cream mocha. 
M- Pretty good. All of the BT variants are higher up for M with me. I like thick stouts. 
O- I definitely would not go out of my way to get this one. Its OK; and if it is going 1:1 with DB Huna, grab the latter. If you are well versed in BT and the variants, you will not be shocked by this one. If you love BT and the variants, well then you should definitely try to get this. My palate has moved away from the BT variants.
This beer has more in common with CR than a BCBCS or KBS due to the malt 985 charactersgueuzedreg, Feb 13, 2014

Thanks to mrbubbler for sharing this one.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, coffee, and alcohol flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness and a huge alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely boozy but it has an awesome balance of cocoa and coffee aspects all around. 706 charactersUCLABrewN84, Feb 10, 2014

M - Syrupy sweet with a slight bitter coffee presence as well as light oak near the finish
O - Wow this is an impressive stout from the Bruery with tons of flavor. The coffee takes a good stout and makes it even better by adding more balance and complexity. 560 charactersjeonseh, Jan 29, 2014

4.94/5  rDev +11.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, this beer is a triumph. 
A: Deep, rich brown. Very little light passes through the rim exposing an amber-ruby color halo. Minimal head at pour that dissipates quickly. 
S: Dark chocolate and rich coffee vapors. As it warms, the oak and bourbon vanilla begin to rise out. Only the slightest hint of alcohol burn as expected with a monster 19.2% ABV. 
T: This is a masterpiece. Rich bourbon and roasty malts come out of the gates early followed by intense coffee that balances with a minor bitterness. Finishes with a sweet vanilla and savory espresso combination. Little to no alcohol heat. 
M: Not too thick, not too thin; This is right on the money. Slightly buttery from the barrel but not so much as to coat your pallet rendering you unable to taste anymore. The minor astringency from the coffee helps break the oil slick and open the pallet up to taste more and more of the intense flavors. 
O: I have posted before and I will put it up here, this beer is damn near perfection in a glass. I have been asked/offered many options to trade away MW and I am not sure there is any other beer (or combination there of) I'd rather have. I have now tried a pour off the tap and opened a bottle at home with very little deviation between the two. Both the Bruery and by proxy the Portola Coffee Lab/TCHO shine with this beer.

4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Went to pick up my allocations at The Bruery last night and a kind Hoarders' Society member shared a bit of his pour with me. I couldn't be more thankful.
A: Very dark brown, almost black; no head, very little lacing; the thing I noticed first about this beer was that it had great "legs" like a fine wine. I've never seen beer with "legs" before.
S: Chocolate fudge, fresh espresso beans, caramel, oak, and a slight hint of coconut. Then more chocolate. 
T: Where do I begin with this beauty? Starts out with an explosion of bourbon-chocolaty goodness, then mellows out along the middle of the tongue and transitions into warm flavors of vanilla, espresso, oak, coconut, and more chocolate. This is decadence incarnate. Just phenomenal.
M: Medium-light viscosity; oily, buttery, with a very slight boozy warmth as it goes down. Honestly, I'm amazed at how smooth this beer is considering how high of an ABV it carries. 
O: I've tried well over a thousand beers in the past 4 years of my journey as a craft beer enthusiast, and this takes the cake as the absolute best beer I've ever had the pleasure of placing on my tongue. Incredible. 1,142 charactersJules11788, Jan 08, 2014
4.91/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap in the Bruery tasting room. 
5oz. pour served @ 45 deg. allowed to warm to room temp before finishing the last sip.
A: very dark brown. Viscous and opaque. No head what so ever.
S: Roasted, espresso, chocolate, bourbon.
T: Very much like the nose. Roasted coffee, up front then creamy and dark chocolate. The high ABV is well hidden. Some dark fruit. Very drinkable. As the beer warms, even more of the flavors of vanilla and chocolate come out. 
M: The only fault I find in this beer is here. A little oily with no carbonation. But really how much carbonation can you expect at this high ABV. 
OA: Better then Black Tuesday and Grey Monday. Far more drinkable then the other two. The sweetness of the base beer is perfectly contrasted by the bitterness of the coffee. Black Tuesday is a beer you have to share, Mocha Wednesday is a beer you don't want to share. 875 charactersCrazydaddyo, Jan 08, 2014
