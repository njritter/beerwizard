4.87/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours an oily black color with a small, dark brown head, which vanishes immediately.
The aromas of this are simply amazing - there's a lot going on with licorice, scorched malts, tobacco and dark chocolate. The barrel adds a tremendous depth with dried apples, rock sugar, peppers, dried plum and lots of spicy wood, tickling the nose by developing a boozy warmth.
Drinks silk and velvet, full bodied with lots and lots of alcohol soaked layers of rich maltiness. 
Tastes right from the beginning of burned malts, wild honey, whipped cream as for its awesome mouthfeel, and fudge. Develops a spicy licorice roastiness once the barrel gets noteable, together with cinnamon, toasted nuts and a luscious amount of bitter chocolate. Finishes with molasses, melting chocolate, long lasting tobacco, dried earth and a flowery note from the otherwise still pleasantly spicy barrel.
This is like an amped up Bourbon County - not necessarily thicker on the tongue, but even creamier with more roast and bitter chocolate, countered by an even sweeter fudge note, balanced by earth and spices. Awesomly intense and balanced throughout. 1,128 charactersaleigator, Jan 22, 2017

Poured on Christmas morning 2016 into stemmed Hill Farmstead stemware.
Pours nearly jet black with one half finger of deep caramel colored head.
Aromas are incredible, a perfect mix of deeply roasted malt and bourbon.
Flavors are wonderful and balanced. Notes of bitter coffee, sweet chocolate and mellow bourbon.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Silky, thick enough.
Overall, this is completely on par with BCBS if not better. 434 charactersBoldRulerVT, Dec 25, 2016

Deep dark blown look with some lacing and a nice tan head.  The smell of this was heavy oak and milk chocolate.  Really enjoyable.  I got some similar notes in the taste but some sweetness opened up as well, almost like a dark fruit or cherry flavor along with some caramel.  Really nice.  Not super thick which is similar to their style, but the complexity of their barrel aged stouts continues to impress me.  I love their stuff. 477 charactersrabbott2, Dec 20, 2016

Nice lingering Oakey bourbon on he finish.  Mouthfeel is a little thin and hot on the finish.  Overall lacking in balance a little.  Great taste but a little lacking in the other departments. 467 charactersWolberjs, Sep 18, 2016

T: Bold molasses, chocolate, and caramel with subtle oak, rye whiskey, and bourbon flavors
F: Although the beer appeared to pour a viscous motor oil thickness, the actual feel was decidedly more medium-bodied
O: Another fantastic stout offering from HF. While the lack of carbonation on the pour did not provide the prettiest looking beer - the smell and taste were right up there with some of the better BA stouts I've had the pleasure of trying. I hope HF will bring this one back sooner than later - delicious beer indeed. 686 charactersFireman_RK, May 18, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Batch 2: bottled 8/13
Appearance:  A heard pour raises a modest mocha-colored head that quickly fades away leaving the pitch black liquid by its lonesome; viscous but not a lot of lacing
Smell:  Chocolate fudge, molasses, Bourbon and hints of smoke/oak
Taste:  Chocolate fudge and molasses, up front, with the Bourbon tones developing in the middle; after the swallow, the smoke and oak emerges along with a touch of soy
Mouthfeel:  A bit thinner than I would have expected for the style but still full-bodied; low carbonation and some warmth in the gullet
Overall:  I come out on the side of the BAs who have previously said this is a good but not great beer; the flavor lacks the range of the great brews and the mouthfeel is definitely an issue; glad to have tried it but I think the score reflects the brewery's reputation and I can well understand that
Thanks, Nuwanda, for the opportunity 900 charactersbrentk56, Feb 22, 2015

Black, though not of the thick and intimidating variety, with a modest but persistent fine-bubbled beige head.
Nose is quite barrel forward, with woody vanilla and coconut complementing firm dry cocoa molasses and burnt toffee. Flavours follow. Rich and indulgent choc-caramel fudge, burnt toffee and date slice before the cocoa, dark chocolate and tannins emerge at the end to dry out the finish.  Quite a coup.
Terrifically good Imperial Stout. Impressively clean and distinct profile. 531 charactersspicelab, Nov 29, 2014

The beer is dark brown, near black, with a small beige collar. Aromas of dark roast, chocolate. Rich and flavorful. Dark chocolates. Oak and bourbon character are there, but don't overwhelm the flavor profile. Elegant feel. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. While I enjoy everything Hill Farmstead, in general, it seems the stouts are not quite up to the level of their saisons and IPAs. 456 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 09, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 522oz bottle split 2 ways with BA morningthief. Poured into a wine glass. 
Appearance: Black with a one inch dark tan head. Leaves sweeping spots and arches of lacing. Looks pretty serious.
Smell: Pretty muted. Some oak and more molasses. Very good but a little simple. Some red wine notes come out with warmth.
Taste: Holy shit. The aroma didn't prepare me for all this flavor. Up front it's sweet bourbon and vanilla oak, leading to brownies fresh out of the oven and a lot of molasses. Highlights to the flavor are unique and amazing. I've tasted most of this before in different places, but the highlights to the flavor (and the overall impression, and how pronounced and complimentary everything is) is uncommonly excellent. 
I knew I would give this a 5 for taste after just a few sips. The question isn't "is this a good stout?" it's "Is this the best stout you've ever tasted?"
Mouthfeel: Full side of medium bodied, and very creamy. Slight dryness at the end to balance the pastry assault. Mild alcohol heat. Works with the flavor.
Overall: You want to think Hill Farmstead is overrated, but it's not. This beer is so good it's inspiring. 1,152 charactersPahn, Jul 04, 2014

Heads goes away fast but leaves some nice lacing. Smell isn't as strong as I would have thought. Chocolate, bourbon, some coffee. Taste is sweet bourbon right up front. Hints of toffee, black licorice, sweet molasses, on the backend but mostly the bourbon is over powering. I do wish it weren't so sweet. Mouthfeel is sticky, fairly easy to drink. Decent bourbon stout but awfully sweet. 458 charactersMikeypnh, May 02, 2014

Nice surprise seeing this one on tap! Dark black pour, maybe some faint brown hues around the edges, with a minimal head, just a dark collar, which left a few shards of lacing and some legs on the glass. Nice aroma, thick with fudge, dark malts, caramelized sugar, notes of bourbon and vanilla. More of the same in the taste, with the barrel element coming out a bit more, vanilla, coconut, bourbon, oak, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, slight char and roasty coffee. I got more malt/sweet/bourbon than bitter/roast/coffee in this one. Medium-full body, lower carbonation, silky mouthfeel, booze was present, but not too hot at all. Very good overall. 691 charactersRifugium, Apr 06, 2014

Popped my first bottle of B2 back in December with NYCBuckeye and Sobeleg and was unimpressed - thought it was thin and very hot. This bottle (same batch - B2) was a ridiculous improvement. 
A: Jet black of night. Barely any tan head, dissipates quickly. Looks like chocolate motor oil.
S: Big barrel character going to war with the chocolate and roast coffee underneath. A little bit of licorice too perhaps? We were out on the porch - could have been wafting in the air though from elsewhere.
T: Was really pleasantly surprised with the improvement an extra 7 months in the bottle did for the taste (and mouthfeel). Heat was way down, giving way to layers of (in order of strength): oaky bourbon, dark chocolate covered-esperesso beans, roasted malt. Absolutely outstanding. 
M: This was the biggest improvement since the first bottle we popped in December. This just coated your mouth like the unmixed syrup at the bottom of an old-fashioned glass of Hershey's chocolate milk. Super thick and chewy - which for the style put the beer into a new stratosphere. Not sure if the first bottle from December was bad bottle or not (we got the bottles together at the DBD release, so weird if there was that big of a variation). 
O: One of the best BB stouts I've ever had. This bottle edges out M&C 1 & 3, BoT, and even GoM. If you have the chance to trade for this, it seems like this batch is peaking right now. I highly recommend it. 1,490 charactersCrookdrain, Mar 13, 2014

No head, super dark pitch black thick beer nice legs, mild dark mocha head as I swirl. 
Nose tons of dark choc, dark malts, caramel, cocoa, then even more barrel notes, some bourbon, vanilla barrel, great toasty vanilla barrel and dark choc, hint of fluffy nougat, faint booze, even touch buttery oak. 
Taste is great but not as good as the nose, lots of dark malts, cocoa and dark choc, fluffy nougat, caramel, etc. Then barrel, vanilla barrel, little buttery oak and plenty of bourbon but not a ton, juicy dark malts, mild bitter earthy hops and bitter mild roast, touch of warming booze, even hint fudgey and toasted oak. Finish is dry with lots more bourbon and toasty vanilla oak, more bitterness and bitter dark malts, hint of booze. 
Mouth is thick and rich, heavy, but not too thick, decent carb, mild warming booze. 
Overall great, great bourbon and barrel, nice base beer that absorbs the bourbon and barrel well. 1,003 charactersjlindros, Feb 23, 2014

App- Typical RIS- dark black body, opaque with a nice 1cm light mocha head that dissipates slowly. Some lacing on the collar. Stains the glass oily brown when I swirl it.
Smell- Chocolate fudge, dark chocolates. Not much dark fruit here. Smells interesting with a nice bourbon charcoal sweetness. Interesting but not mindblowing.
Flavour- Pretty good! A nice base russian imperial stout is there with a nice umami flavour. The base malts are strong and roasty and sweet; but as it warms up, there is a more predominant umami flavour which makes the beer that much more interesting. I get much more of a drizzled chocolate fudge brownie flavour at room temp. Cold, it's just basically an imperial stout.
Mouthfeel- The most disappointing aspect of the beer. Watery, not particularly well-carbonated but carbonated well enough. Aftertaste is a slick chocolate brownie sensation. Definitely a sipper.
Overall- It's good but not great. Don't give up too much for this beer... unless you have a dog! 1,135 charactersStevedore, Feb 07, 2014

Thanks to DocJ007 for sharing this one with us last weekend, Batch #2.
A - Pours jet black with a small half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light ring around the edge of the glass, leaving little to no lace at all on the glass.
S - Smells of warm bourbon, fudgey chocolate, vanilla, molasses, dark fruits, overly charred oak and plenty of dark roasted malt. Lots of dark aromas lurking in the shadows of this one.
T - Starts off much like the nose does with a bit sugary kick - mainly the fudgey chocolate, vanilla, molasses mixed dark fruits - quickly being joined by the smokey charred oak and base dark roasted malts. Finish is much like before with a mix of sweetness and dark roasty flavors, lingering long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Slick feel throughout, booze is hidden quite well.
O - I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Not as good as when I had it on-tap but still a very enjoyable beer. Really looking forward to trying that Double Barrel version in the near future. 1,188 charactersorangesol, Jan 25, 2014
4.43/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up from a great trade with Evan! An aggressive pour of this pitch black beauty yields a one finger dark caramel-colored head that dissipates pretty quickly but leaves some really nice lacing. The nose is fairly sweet initially, but quickly yields to lots of dark roast, chocolate fudge, oak, vanilla, and a ton of booze. The taste is big and bold with rich chocolate fudge, vanilla, dark fruits, oak, subtle char, molasses, espresso, cocoa, black cherry, and booze. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick. Reminded me of tasting brownie batter. It's velvety smooth with a subtle warming on the finish. Overall, this was a hard beer to figure out. It was incredibly flavorful and easy to drink, even though the booze was sometimes a bit too much. With that said, it never really hurt the experience. Only my second beer from HF. Hopefully more to follow... 862 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 23, 2014

A - pours a deep dullish muddied brown. Nearly black as it sits in my glass. Fantastic near finger of rich chocolate/auburn tinted head. Decent retention, strong lacing.
S - Semi sweet. Vanilla, tons of chocolate, booze, almost a peppermintish boozy type aroma. Pretty broad smelling, not overly rich.
T - Rich boozey vanilla/charrred flavors initially with some raisin/dark fruit which soon mix with ample sweet chocolaty (minimally roasty) flavors

Where this felt short for me:
1. This is a very boozy beer
 a. Too boozy smell
 b. Too boozy taste 
 c. At least the nose matched the taste well
2. The mouth-feel was too watery for a BA stout. I wish this beer had some more viscosity.
Bottom line: this beer needs more thickness or less booziness or some combination of both. 475 charactersdmhurdle, Nov 04, 2013

4.43/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Sampled this at darkness day. Pours a silky opaque black with some tan head which retains a nice layer. The nose hites you with decadent notes of vanilla and cream paired with heavy roast and chocolate. Some smokey notes come through as well as some earthy hop notes as well. The taste is much like the nose. The bourbon barrel aged characteristics are expertly integrated wih the beer. The bourbon is present but is harmonious with the sturdy stout base beer. Taste is smooth, plenty of vanilla, chocolate, and roast with some mellow oak char. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with velvety texture. Overall, delicious brew here, definitely worth seeking out! 656 charactershomebrew311, Oct 31, 2013

M - Full body. Sludgy. Light carbonation. 640 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Oct 20, 2013
4.02/5  rDev -9.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4500ml bottle, from the Sept. 2013 release, poured into a snifter, shared with friends.
The beer pours a deep jet black color, oily and slick, with a few brown bubbles rising from the beer but the vanish quickly leaving a murky beer behind with no lace or film to be found. The aroma is of potent bourbon, lots of oak and toffee, mega barrel character, with lots of fudgey chocolate, rich malt, stone fruit, plum and cherry with an assertive amount of astringent alcohol towards the end that really mellows out as the beer warms. The flavors are very impactful, the barrel character is a bit more integrated on the tongue vs the nose, lots of chocolate, molasses, oak, toffee bourbon notes, charred wood, a bit of ashiness or chalkiness, with lots of fruit character that I really enjoyed that brings out a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking, the beer could definitely use a bit more carb, and while it's not flat, it's certainly a bit thin. It does coat the mouth well and finishes remarkably smooth, but I still wish it had a bit more liveliness or carb to help prop it up a bit more.
Verdict: A very nice bourbon barrel stout from Hill Farmstead. This beer definitely needed some time to open up and round itself out after opening and really hit the spot. It does need some body to it, the thin feel was a bit underwhelming, but all in all, this is a quality beer, perhaps not the world beater that it's being tossed around as, but a very quality beer. 1,470 characterskevanb, Oct 20, 2013

Pours barely a head. Beer is pitch black. Lacing is stringy and sparse but with nice legs. Decent.
Nose is chocolate, molasses, honey, cocoa, and booze. Solid but pretty straightforward.
Opens chocolate, plum, and fudge. Very sweet. Molasses and booze emerge from the depth and combine with the chocolate and subtle dark fruit nicely. Finishes sweet booze and more molasses with just a touch of woodiness. Aftertaste of bourbon and fudge. Very enjoyable.
Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Oily and slick in the mouth and goes down warm and smooth. Messy finish with a lingering, sticky aftertaste. Very good.
Hill Farmstead's recent Imperial Stouts have been a bit lacking by their high standards. Very solid but the flavors need to smooth out just a bit in this one. I'd wait on this for 4-5 months. 890 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 20, 2013

Very smooth with no boozy heat and initially a little too sweet but mellows as it warms
Overall as close to perfect as it gets and I'm surprised at some of the ratings of too boozy and hot. Maybe the month of waiting to drink has helped 449 charactersalaimoa, Oct 19, 2013

A- Black with no light passing through. Decent 1/2 inch mocha head that fades over a minute to a ring around the glass. Impressive lacing. 
S- Bourbon up front, followed by chocolate, cocoa nibs, and roast malt. Lots of roast malt. Some woody tobacco notes as well. 
T- Follows the nose- lots of chocolate, coffee, roasty malts, followed by a nice amount of boozy bourbon and some oak tannins. Complex, interesting, very tasty. Not the best of the style, but very good. 
M- Full body with low carbonation creeping on medium. Very tannic and astringent on the end- the booze (either the bourbon or the beer itself) really lingers on for a while, and not in the best way. 
O- Maybe it was my high expectations from this beer, the effort it took to get it, or the hype-train behind Shaun's beers, but I was a bit let down. This beer is good, but not amazing. I love bourbon barrel stouts, and this was just lacking the vanilla flavor and decadent mouthfeel that I really love about the style. I bet this will get better with a year on it- right now it is just too hot with way too much roast malt astringency at this point. 1,157 charactersjustforrazors, Oct 06, 2013
4.8/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours a viscous, used motor-oil black, with a finger and a half mocha head. Hello there beautiful! Good retention, but leaves very little to no lacing, probably due to the long time spent in the barrel. Very nice alcohol legs when swirled.
S- And hello there bourbon! Loads of vanilla, oak, chocolate, and booze! Hints of roast, grains, dark/sweet fruits (i.e. prunes/figs). Super complex, and damn near perfect! One detractor is there is a good bit of booze/acetone aroma that comes out as it warms.
T- The flavor is to die for! There are cascades of vanilla, chocolate, sweet molasses, and brown sugar that flow over the tongue. This is mellow, sweet, and complex. Dark fruits and roast play a strong secondary role, balancing and tying everything together. I would write more, but finding more descriptors is difficult, and this is so damn tasty I just want to drink the rest! 
M- The mouthfeel is so thick, viscous, and velvety smooth! Light carbonation, some warming/soothing booze, and a dry finish. Perfection!
O- Overall this was just an absolute treat to have! I can't wait to see how my other bottle ages, and how DBD tastes! 1,142 charactersSadMachine, Oct 05, 2013

Pours a dark brown, light black color with virtually no head at any point. 
A nice aroma of bourbon and chocolate rises from the glass.
The initial taste is of dark fruit and bourbon. Moderate sweetness and a little bit of alcohol heat gives way to a difficult to find dark roast/dark chocolate finish.
Mouthfeel is moderately thick and viscous. The sweetness really coats the tongue, and there is no carbonation to help move things along.
On the whole, a very solid beer by Hill Farmstead. However, in a crowded BA Stout category, this falls just short of cracking the top tier for me. Perhaps a better carbed bottle would have made all the difference. 699 charactersthebigredone, Sep 24, 2013

M- little to no carbonation, syrupy, very hot.
O- First off I love the lack of carbonation and flat pour. It feels like you have a glass of quality bourbon in front of you. It's too hot, definitely a sipper. This heat masks some of the flavor of the beer but with time I believe this beer will come of age nicely. 559 charactersAdamF625, Sep 21, 2013

A~ dark as night with a tiny dark brown head and a good amount of lacing. i only gave it a slightly lower score because of how small the head was but that definitely doesn't affect the mouthfeel. 
S~ a good amount of booze on the nose followed by a lot of roasted bitter chocolate. a little vanilla, caramel, and burnt coffee come out here as well.
T~ not nearly as boozy as the scent would make you think. super complex bourbon up front. you can pretty much tell that it was a blend of Buffalo Trace and Pappy. the "Pappy effect" totally comes out here. as it gets warmer its transforms into another incredible (bourbon)/beer. lots of roasted dark chocolate smashes your pallet followed by an extremely nice coffee flavor. leaving you with a thick vanilla extract and molasses after taste.
M~ super thick motor oily goodness! nice carbonation, not what i was expecting from the look of things. surprisingly super drinkable!
O~ my perfect bourbon stout, i know i'm gonna crave this one. glad i have a few more bottles. the complexity of the 2 bourbons is really outstanding. i can't compare this to batch 1 but if it was anywhere near as good when it came out i can only imagine how its tasting now. this to me is like an imperial version of BA Earl with a tad less coffee. which was 10x better then KBS in my opinion. so you can only imagine how incredible this is all around! 1,437 charactersSkrip, Sep 17, 2013

I never mention bitterness in my reviews, my bitterness taste buds are ridiculously under-sensitive.
APPEARANCE : No light gets through this tough guy. Incredibly opaque, with a heavy, syrupy look, almost no head, but what head it has is khaki. The bubbles forming the thin head creep up to the surface so slowly you'd think they're rising through molasses. A larger head would make for a more appealing appearance, but then the added carbonation might ruin the mouthfeel (more on that to come).
SMELL : First nose is herbal molasses, cocoa, roasted malts, coffee, wood, faint vanilla, figs and raisins, a bit boozy. Second nose has the same and also releases some sharper aromas, on the herbal side, but with a definite rich sweet vanilla undertone. Third nose is the same as second, but with more booze. The bourbon cask is obvious, but well integrated.
TASTE : The mouth releases a smoky side that was not obvious on the nose. The smoke is definitely strengthened by the roasted coffee aromas, they meld together quite nicely. The rest is the same as the nose. Some sweetness.
MOUTHFEEL : Thick. I've seen thicker (Hardknott's Vitesse Noire, for example) but this is definitely up there with the big guys as far as standing-a-fork-straight-up-in-your-glass goes. Almost no carbonation, which increases the heaviness, but IMO, not to the point of being overwhelming.
OVERALL : Very interesting beer, well crafted. Chances are some people will find this to be way too much, way over-the-top, but I personally enjoy it very much. We were limited to 2 bottles per person on site, so I'm very happy a friend of mine, who only wanted one, agreed to buy a second one and sell it right off to me. I'll keep these for the cold winter nights. 1,803 charactersFrostBlast, Sep 14, 2013

2011 vintage. Bottle # 609/864.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, vanilla, and cookie dough flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but the mouthfeel seems slightly off in my opinion. 639 charactersUCLABrewN84, Aug 26, 2013

Damon has a nearly black color with coffee brown edges. There is a small mocha tan cap that leaves a few wisps of lacing.
The aroma is sweet bourbon, creamy chocolate, a bit of dark roast coffee, and a full roasted malt presence. 
The flavor starts with a light and smooth bourbon flavor. Then there is creamy dark chocolate, full roasted malt, some milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and oak, with a bit more bourbon on the finish. 
It has a very nice full body, rich, creamy carbonation, and a little bit sticky mouthfeel. Damon is definitely rich and creamy.
Overall Damon does a great job of packing a smooth, tasty bourbon barrel stout into a nice, full-bodied package. 733 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jul 02, 2013

Thanks for opening this one with me, Callemcoon!
(Aged for 1 year)
Bottle #8/864
Near black in color with a small, very dark brown head of small and moderately-sized bubbles. Leaves the glass oily and spotted on the way down. This looks moderately thick, though not quite as impressive in appearance as, say, a Speedway Stout or any stout from Cigar City. Pretty and appropriate.
Well-rounded, and balanced aroma of chocolate, mild roast character, complementary but not overpowering bourbon, and chocolate-covered cherry. What I'm calling cherry is most likely a bit of oxidation that's crept in over the last year. It all comes together quite nice, without being overpowering or overbearing.
This is unlike most big, bourbon-barrel aged stouts. This is a drinkable, well-rounded, well-executed, even delicate version of an often bold, expressive, in-your-face style. Well integrated layers of chocolate, mild bourbon, a bit of roast and oak, and again, just a tiny peek of a chocolate-covered cherry note. It all comes together quite nicely.
The hallmark of this beer, personally, is it's mouthfeel. Without being terribly thick, it's creamy, coating, and nearly full.
Excellent, and I'm very glad I had the opportunity to try it. Strangely...I prefer BCBS (fresh or aged). 1,297 charactersehammond1, Mar 30, 2013
4.1/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle. Pour a dark brown-black, with mocha lacing. Aroma is decadent fudge, almonds, dates and prunes. Not your usual bourbon barrel imperial stout as it isn’t overly bourbony and leans more towards dark fruits and conforting alcohol heat. Not very roasted and coffee either. some dark chocolate and a slight roastiness. Very subtle and refine. Oily mouthfeel and low carbonation. 383 charactersLuk13, Mar 11, 2013

Pours a dark chestnut brown color that appears black and opaque in the glass.  Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a lasting ring leaving spotty lacing behind.
Smokey, roasted malt aroma with subtle barrel integration.  Some toasted oak and subtle booziness with more of an oak and peaty scotch presence than sweet, boozy bourbon.  There a faint malt backbone with some smoke, dark chocolate, coffee bean and oatmeal but the oak and peat notes overpower things a bit. 
Medium bodied with a nice smokey barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the dark malts of the base beer.  Smokey, peaty scotch flavor with toasted oak, ash, smoked meat and burnt malt along with subtle vanilla and dry oak.  This is countered by a balance of sweet and roasted dark malt flavors with hints of dark chocolate, toast, coffee bean and oatmeal.  Well balanced with a nicely integrated barrel presence, however, I'm getting more of a dry oak than bourbon flavor.  Complex with a well masked ABV that makes it easy to drink but there's something a touch off that i cant put mu finger on.  Still, an enjoyable beer that I'm glad to have tried. 1,207 characterscorby112, Feb 14, 2013

A - Dark chocolate brown with a syrup body. A light mocha colored head.
S - Light nose comprised of vanilla, bourbon, and light milk chocolate
T - Tons more flavor than you'd expect in the nose. Sweet bourbon upfront with vanilla, chocolate, and maple syrup. There is a light chocolate malt in the middle. The finish is bourbony sweetness that lingers on in the finish. 
MF - Silky smooth beer with barely any carbonation. Lightly astringent in the finish as well There is also a slight oak presence that lingers in the finish
O - Amazing flavor in this one which makes you want to keep on sipping it. There is a lot of bourbony presence and sweet vanilla in this one. Additionally, it has a great mouthfeel as well as it was nice and creamy. I do wish it had a bit of a better nose as it was not too fragrant. This is definitely good but I'm not sure it is worth giving up a lot to get a bottle 974 charactersjeonseh, Jan 02, 2013

Pour: Completely pitch black body. Straight up midnight. Perhaps the darkest beer I've ever had. Forms a half of an inch of deep khaki head, that leaves a nice rim. Slight lacing, but Damon leaves the glass with a brown sludge.
Smell: Bourbon vanilla up front, followed by some milk chocolate. Dark fruits take over the nose from here, with a nice combo of raisins and figs. 
Taste: Wow. Smooth bourbon toffee up front, that gives way to chewy chocolate fudge. A nice vanilla moves in, and characterizes the majority of the sweetness. The dark fruits complement flawlessly, and while I can normally do without them, they really work here. Finishes chewy with a brownie batter like lingering taste on the palate.
Mouthfeel: So incredibly smooth. Bourbon provides all the amazing toffee and vanilla flavors, with no heat. Nearly velvety, and walks the fine line between being light and thick. Awesome.
Overall: Amazing beer. Absolutely blew me away. I cannot wait to try future releases of this beer. 1,084 characterscfrances33, Nov 09, 2012

4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5500 mL bottle poured into a Hunahpu snifter. Bottle # 723/864.
Appearance - Small khaki head. Not quite inky. Wispy lacing.
Smell - Tons of black patent malt. Light bourbon. A big oaky presence, more than the bourbon and vanilla.
Taste - Lots more barrel blends into the flavor. Bourbon is still light, but vanilla and caramel come out. Dark fruit flavor right at the front, which might be a byproduct of the alcohol and black patent malt. Lots of molasses. Gives it a bitter flavor in the back.
Mouthfeel - Bitter. Not really chewy, but easy to drink at this ABV. The molasses gives it a sweet flavor that implies viscosity, without it actually being there.
Overall - Second time having this it was significantly better than the first. I was also smashed the first time. It would be really good with more barrel presence. 827 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 30, 2012

Thanks!
A: Pours pitch black in the center, with some edge translucence. The body has a small mocha-colored head. 
S: Fudgy brownies, vanilla, caramel, smoke, bourbon. While this is clearly barrel-aged, the bourbon and oak presence is relatively muted (compared to something like Bourbon County), and the smoke is an interesting touch. 
T: Brown sugar, fudge/chocolate, vanilla, caramel -- this is an imperial stout first and barrel-aged second. Smoke, bourbon, oak, and dark cherries accentuate the flavor in the mid-taste, with the oak pulling into the finish for a slightly tannic, as well as boozy, finish. Smoke carries into the exhalation. Quite nice. 
M: Medium-plus bodied; this doesn't have the full richness of something like Black Tuesday or Bourbon County, and I don't necessarily want that. I think Hill Farmstead angles for beers that are more balanced and ready to drink out of the gate, and that is reflected here. The one drawback is that it's slightly boozy. 
O: Another entry in my series of "Why is Hill Farmstead ruining my grading average?" series. I had a sip of this once, a long time ago, and it didn't make an impression. Sampling a bottle in a quieter setting over an hour was a much more enjoyable experience. This is outstanding. 1,323 charactersArbitrator, Oct 24, 2012

Nose has a fair amount of wood and some sweet bourbon notes. Chocolate cake is rich with a faint ashy, roast coffee bean note. The taste is very big, a bit sweet but not sugary with notes of vanilla and chocolate, the wood isn’t as strong but the bourbon seems to add a very nice balance and some heat in the finish. The body is thick, soft, and smooth. Semi dry finish that lingers for a bit as more rich chocolate continues to stay on the palate.***Had multiple times since first time, overly sweet and a bit singular. First bottle must have been lightning in a bottle, not nearly as good and had both batches multiple times. Rating to reflect. 729 characterscpetrone84, Oct 09, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the same bottle as the previous reviewer. (#178/864) Thanks to Deuane for the trade and to Kegatron for assisting in making an event out of opening up some Farmstead offerings. The brew poure black in color with a skimpy head. A few bubbles make their way to the surface and collapse quickly. When held to the light, some brown clarity is seen through the edges. Faint spotty lace sticks to the glass along with legs of alcohol.
The aromatics are straight up brownie batter: cocoa, fudge, vanilla and caramel all come together to formulate this rich sticky quality to the nose. Trace amounts of bourbon spiked alcohol emit from the glass as it warms up.
The taste is a bit more boozy than the aroma leads on. There is a spiit reinforcement of alcohol bite overtop of a plehora of barrel aging characteristics. Coconut, caramel, oak, vanilla and a bit boozy but it is masterfully integrated with a slight bitter roast inclusion across the back. The aftertaste is again a throwback to the aromatics: cocoa, coffee and fudgy with a hint of must.
This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a very light hint of carbonation. This brew displays awesome barrel aging character and is a real treat to sip on almost more as a dessert than anything. I cant gloat about nothing but the good here... being nitpicky id say that just a slight bit more carbonation would have been nice but id certainly take it again in a heartbeat if offered. 1,444 charactersstakem, Sep 13, 2012

4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5500 ml black wax topped bottle into a couple of snifters. Bottle # 178/864. Huge thanks go to Stakem for sharing this bottle with a couple of us. 
Pours black as night in the glass, with a think bubbly head of dark mocha froth. This maintains some rich edges, which just coats the sides of the glass with spotty lacing and gooey brown oils. The aroma smells of burnt bourbon character up front, with is quickly followed by notes of chocolate cake, coffee, molasses, brown sugar and spicy alcohol. Man, this has a nice booze soaked sweetness to it in the nose. 
The taste is chocolate fudge, roasted coffee, burnt molasses, brown sugars, and more spicy alcohol which leads into a charred bourbon finish. This is just so burnt, sticky and rich feeling on the palate. I’m in love. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with a thick and chewy carbonation that is undercut by a good amount of tannic slickness that helps this drink way smoother than it should considering the alcohol and assertive barrel character here. 
This a great BA Imperial Stout from Hill Farmstead and I especially loved how it didn’t hide its brashness but instead complimented it with a host of delicious sticky sweetness that kept this accessible and a joy to sip on. I drank a bunch of this at the last EBF and it was a pleasure to be able to sit down with it again. Thanks again Adam! 1,358 charactersKegatron, Sep 10, 2012

A - Black body, dark brown head, uneven bubbles.

T - Oak, Bourbon, bit of vanilla(?), small amount of chocolate, toasted marshmellow, molasses. A lot of wood in the finish.
M - Not a lot of carbonation which works very well. Very smooth.

Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass, proper! Color is pitch black, a small tan head turns to a ring pretty quickly leaving some spots of lace.
Solid, enticing scent. Lots of chocolate, dark fruit (cherries), caramel, strong bourbon.
Taste is also very solid and balanced. Milk chocolate is maybe most prominent with some dark chocolate there as well, deep caramel, some dark fruit but tame compared to the scent. Good amount of bourbon presence, definitely there but well balanced. Not much oak or roast, comes off as pretty dessert-y.
Very smooth+oily, lowish carbonation, a bit of alcohol heat but drinks pretty easy for the ABV.
Quite delicious, not mind-blowing and on the simple side, but if you like well-balanced yet big cocoa/bourbon/caramel goodness this should satisfy. 857 charactersChico1985, Aug 31, 2012

Pours a dark black with just a bit of light coming through at the edges. A small tan head settles to a ring and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The aroma is lots of bourbon, vanilla, oak, quite a bit of chocolate, and some light coffee. The taste is sweet with quite a bit of bourbon, some vanilla, a bit of oak, and lots of rich chocolate. There is also a light nuttiness. The finish is sweet with more rich chocolate and some oak and a light alcohol presence. Medium body. Low carbonation. Solid beer. Really rich. 583 charactersjethrodium, Aug 30, 2012

A: Pours black with raisin highlights around the edges. The head is thin and deep brown. 
S: Licorice comes through along with nutty and smoky notes. Caramel, roasted malts and toasted coconut come out as it warms. 
T: Rich chocolate, black licorice, toasted grains, slight caramel and toffee with smoke and a bit of warming booze in the finish. Bourbon and some chocolate fudge sweetness fill the aftertaste, which lingers long after the swallow. 
M: Super smooth mouthfeel, velvety carbonation that bubbles up in the finish. Full body, smooth warming booze that isn’t too hot or distracting. 
O: An extremely rich sipper. One of the richest and longest lasting aftertastes I’ve had. Definitely split with some friends. Thanks again, Michael! 816 charactersscottfrie, Aug 26, 2012
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Second bottle I have consumed, getting the review in.
A- Poured into both Hill Farmstead stemware glasses, mine being the snifter looking one. Pitch black all the way with a nice dark mocha tan head. The cap forms to a finger in size with a bubbly texture, retention is good for barrel aged. A few legs and lace spots.
S- The nose is somewhat dissimilar from the flavor, which will obviously come later. Aroma mostly consists of the great whiskey barrel: smoothed out Bourbon whiskey, great vanilla and toasty oak. Some cocoa and alcohol to finish.
T- Cocoa really steps up to the plate, like luxury chocolate melting on the taste buds with some great dark cherries thrown in by the yeast. The cocoa and fruits are well off with the barrels they resided in. Notes of whiskey, vanilla, caramel and oak wood balance it all out with just a tad of alcohol.
MF- Lower end carbonation but that is very appropriate for a 10% bourbon barrel stout. The body is rich, thick and somewhat creamy. A nice alcohol warmth supports the flavor well.
The flavor ends up reminding me of a brownie made with bourbon soaked cherries. The cocoa presence is rich and really works well with the bourbon flavor present. 1,199 characterscbutova, Aug 25, 2012

Reviewing the infamous Damon from Hill Farmstead Brewery out of Vermont. Hill Farmstead quickly became one of my favorite breweries this year, and Damon solidified Hill Farmstead's place in my top three.
Score: 98
2011 vintage (batch 1), bottle #471/864. Black wax. Served in a snifter glass and enjoyed on 06/06/12.This beer was consumed the night before being sworn into the Wisconsin state bar as a celebratory libation.
Appearance: Pours the color of motor oil with a thin brown layer of head atop the beer that quickly settles to a mocha-colored ring around the glass. Oily lacing, minimal head and decent retention. The beer looks visually imposing enough at 10.5% ABV. 4/5
Smell: Ample notes of raisin and complex chocolate coat the nose. There's milk chocolate, bakers chocolate, dark chocolate and even some fudge as the brew warms. There is also bourbon vanilla and fig present too. Absolutely awesome nose. 4.75/5
Taste: Smooth bourbon, raisins/figs, fudge and milk chocolate throughout with a nice vanilla flavor in the middle. The vanilla sweetness yields to a fudge flavor towards the finish, though the aftertaste is more of a creamy milk chocolate flavor than fudge. Residual notes of wood. Some sweet maltiness comes out as the beer. Smooth and without booziness. The balance and integration of the flavors here is absolutely superb, almost seamless at times. The flavors are almost too complex and integrated to pin down. Needless to say, this is is a decadent digestif! 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, minimal carbonation. Super creamy mouthfeel. Mildly dry finish with a rich milk chocolate aftertaste. 4.5/5
Overall: One of the best beers of the year; this one truly lives up to it's hype. My only wish is that I had another.
Recommendation: A top notch barrel aged imperial stout that is absolutely worth seeking out. Even casual beer drinkers should be able to revel in the flavorful, unboozy complexities of this big brew.
Pairings: Fresh mint ice cream.
Cost: $15 for a 500 ml bottle. 2,040 charactersjegross2, Aug 21, 2012

A- Pours a pitch black with a small mocha head that leaves minimal lacing. 
S- Plenty of bourbon upfront, oak, roasted malt, burnt caramel, dark chocolate and a hint of smoke.
T- Bourbon hits right away follow by roasted malt, oak, burnt caramel, dark chocolate, smoke and a bit of ash. 
M- Light to medium carbonation that finishes fairly hot. 
O- Somewhat disappointed as this was just too hot at the moment and not nearly as complex as the other stout offerings I've had from HF. This definitely needs some more time to mellow. It's a bit rough around the edges right now, but with the bourbon mellowing some and letting some of the other flavors shine, I could see this being quite good. 839 charactersiadler, Aug 14, 2012

A - Pours black, mocha-colored head, wisps, thin collar.
S - This is a Blanton's/bourbon bomb straight away! After the huge booze, there's roasted malts, chocolate, light bread, caramel, oak, very subtle hops, and burnt sugars. The booze flairs my nostrils...woah.
T - I think this beer needs to additional cellar time to lose some of the booze. The palate offers lots of bourbon, oak, chocolate, light vanilla, caramel, and toasted malts. The alcohol is very noticeable, which detracts from the rest of the beer. Finish is chocolate and booze with light oak. Really more like 3.75 here.
M - Medium to full body, good carbonation, rich, creamy finish.
O - While I like this beer, I want to like it more. I think another 6 months to a year of additional cellar time will do this beer some good. I will revisit then and update when I have it again. Right now, I suggest holding your bottles unless you really want a bunch of alcohol with your RIS (which some people prefer).
In summary, good now but is destined to be great in the future. 1,070 charactersSean9689, Jun 26, 2012
3.4/5  rDev -23.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5This reminded me a little of Bell's Black Note. In that they are both hyped barrel aged imperial stouts that underwhelmed. Body was slightly thinner than expected, alcohol was hot and up front, but way boozier than 10% abv should be. Cheap quality bourbon vanilla taste without rounded molasses notes. Sugars found in the middle were syrupy and wet, although there was a nice chocolate component present. Finish didn't carry the roastiness you'd expect from the middle of the taste. But probably the worst was that the booze was overwhelming and clouded by oak, ash and carbon. 
Worst part, those pieces - oak, heat, bourbon, stout base, weren't integrated very well. Maybe this was sitting in a hot place before we opened the bottle? I'd tend to give the brewery the benefit of the doubt, based on the tremendous stuff they've put out before.
And that said, for all the negatives, Damon still drank as a solid beer. It did the style adequately (despite the oak), and I'd quaff it again. Especially on tap. But when there's shelf stuff like Oak Aged Yeti available that tops it, I'd only drink Damon as a local find, not as a must-seek "gem". 1,144 charactersafksports, Jun 22, 2012

From a 500ml bottle into a snifter. 
Vintage 2011
Bottle 451 of 864
APPEARANCE: A sludgy black, thick pour yields a small, tight, tan head with very good retention. Head fades to a good wisp and ring. Pitch black in color with no carbonation evident. A swirling wisp and ring remain until the end and leaves dots of lacing down the glass. Thick and nasty looking. This is a black, black, thick, evil looking stout beer. 
SMELL: Big nose on this one for sure. Roasted malts, dark chocolate and lots of bourbon barrel. Oak, vanilla and milk chocolate in there, as well as touches of toffee and molasses. This is phenomenal, though perhaps a touch more base beer is needed for a perfect score. 
TASTE: This is a perfect score. Period. Roasted and caramel malt up front, with lots of bourbon barrel at the swallow. Bourbon, oak, vanilla and milk choclate with some bitter dark chocolate and toffee sweetness as well. Big, bold and lingering aftertaste of bourbon barrel, bitter dark chocolate, sweet molasses and roasted flavors just doesn't quit. This is phenomenally ballanced and absolutely decadent. Love it. 
PALATE: Full body, thick and heavy on the palate, with lower levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a bite at the swallow, though well measured, and finishes slightly sticky. Some heat lingers. Could be a touch smoother, but it's full, heavy, and plenty dominating. 
OVERALL: Well, I hate to say it, but this is perhaps the best barrel aged imperial stout to have ever crossed my lips. I can't imagine it getting any closer to perfection than this. A massive, evil look, a wonderfully bold and balanced nose, flavors to write home to your mom about, and a heavy and meanacing palate to boot, this is just a nasty beer that every BA stout lover should get to try. Actually, since I would love to get more of it, forget everything I just said about it. Nevermind. It sucks. Thanks again gents! Send more asap. I am thirsty. 2,197 charactersJeffo, Jun 07, 2012

3.85/5  rDev -13.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle shared by a generous BA at our tasting last weekend.
Aroma boasts dark, strongly roasted malts (almost burnt) with subtle notes of bourbon. Hints of chocolate in the background too.
Starts off roasty but gets immediately blindsided by booze and, to a lesser extent, bourbon. Chocolate tries to save the day towards the end, but the alcohol prevents it from finishing cleanly. A touch ashy overall too.
Truly surprised at how messy this stout was. If memory serves, my two pours of it on draft at EBF were considerably better and more balanced. Booze character then wasn't the sore thumb it's become in the bottle. *Generously* rating it 4.0 on taste because 1) I recall my EBF pours being quite good, and 2) time might smooth these rough edges.
Our 9-person group's opinion on Damon was (surprisingly) unanimous: this is a hot mess. Bourbon isn't integrated well, nor is the booze character. A tremendous disappointment.
Still, Damon's a decent RIS overall, though it falls far short of my expectations from Hill Farmstead. Founders Imperial Stout truly is a better beer right now, but that could easily change in a year or so. 1,139 charactersbrystmar, Jun 06, 2012

4.2/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sampled at EBF Saturday afternoon. Solid black color with an off white head. Aromas of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and caramel. Flavor follows the aroma quite well with a bit of a dry finish. Light body and level of carbonation with a sweet slick mouthfeel. Smells wonderful tastes pretty good but is a bit thin and finishes kind of dry. I’m a bit disappointed with this one because the other Hill stuff I’ve had has been exceptional. Maybe I can revisit this after the bottles come out.
I was able to try this again out of a bottle on 5/11/2012, thanks Matt. Pours a solid black with a thinnish tan head. Smells a lot of bourbon with chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, roast, and a hint of smoke. Flavor is big and bold with the bourbon and the alcohol that comes with it. Roasty chocolate and coffee with hints of vanilla and oak in there. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a chewy sweet mouthfeel. I certainly enjoyed the sample I had out of the bottle much better than at the fest. This is a damn good stout and I do love me some stout. Its a shame these beers are so hard to come by. My rating reflects my impression of the bottle version. 1,185 charactersjohnnnniee, Jun 02, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to IrishColonial for sharing a 500ml bottle of this with us the other night. It poured close to black in color with a thin, frothy tan head to it. The head quickly dissipated down to a thin ring of bubbles concentrating around the edges of the glass.
The aroma shows a lot of roasted, smoky and slightly burnt malts to it right off the bat. The bourbon is pretty reserved in it, but adds a little complexity to the background. There is also a little bit of a fruity, almost wine like quality coming out as it warmed A decent amount of alcohol shows in it, but not too bad.
The taste also has some bold, bitter, roasted malts with a touch of burnt smokiness to them. Again, it's pretty light on the bourbon but it does give it a little warming alcohol presence. I get some creamy sweetness adding some good balance to the dark malts. A little bit of a fruity, wine like character lingers in the finish.
The mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a very good beer. Great range of flavors to it and it comes together very well. 1,081 charactersbillab914, May 08, 2012

*From notes
-- Another solid pull from the cellar of IrishColonial --
A: Unlike HF's BoT, this is broodingly dark in appearance. Rich bootstrap brown to almost black at it's core. A healthy pour yields a .5 finger head that leads to a decent collar and no real signs of lacing.
S: A bit odd at first. This really needs to warm, allowing the beer to open up and blossom. As it does, I'm overwhelmed with charred hops, rich dark malts, a splash of warm dark chocolate brownie batter and medium toast.
T: I get the feeling that the folks at HF really like their smoke, as this starts out a bit smokey - just as their Jim and BoT do. I'm also getting a good bit of earth and a solid bite from the hop oil. Hints of medium body red wine and their barrels linger around in my mouth, though I'm not sure if they used wine barrels. On the finish, I get some subdued, mature bourbon and hints of fresh oak.
M: Extremely rich and dense. It's not BCBS, but it doesn't have to be. Luxurious texture adds to the complexity of the beer. The carbonation is spot-on.
O: Another winner from HF, whose seemingly on quite a roll. Intricate and delicate, yet big and bold. My hats are off to everyone involved in Damon, as it really is unlike any other RIS I've encountered. Heartily recommended. 1,336 charactersRhettroactive, May 08, 2012

A - Jet black. No other way to describe it. Really lacking in carbonation even after a super aggressive pour. Slight bubbles make their way to the top of the beer.
S - A lot of vanilla and wood on the nose. There is a scent there that I can't really put my finger on, but it just smelled a tad odd and out of place. Not unpleasant, it just didn't mesh.
T - Wow. Just, wow. TONS of roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla. They all intermingle perfectly together. Slightly better than BoT.
M - Smooth and silky, no alcohol on the back end. An incredibly drinkable beer for being a barreled stout. 
O - Another winner. Simply a beautifully done beer. His barreled beers can compete with anyone. Worth every last bit of the hype. 811 charactersraveskdr, May 04, 2012

Mouthfeel was excellent as well. Up front its definitely stout, bourbon, wood, etc. all very well balanced, on the sweet side but certainly not too sweet. Overall an amazing beer, and uniquely complex in the finish especially. 414 characterslandhoney, Apr 23, 2012
4.1/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours almost pitch black with a small tan head that fades into a wisp.
Smells of sweet bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and coconut. No one aroma overpowers the others.
Taste is similar. Starts out chocolately before showing some of the barrel characteristics. Coconut and vanilla especially come to the forefront and increase as it warms. Bourbon adds just a kiss of a boozy flavor to it, but isn't the main feature. 
Fairly thick and viscous mouthfeel, something HF always nails on their IPA's and does so again on this.
Overall this is a very good beer, but hardly the mind blowing experience many others made me expect. I feel it could use some coffee or some other bitter roasted malt to balance it out more. There are lots of good flavors, but they are all on the sweeter side. Still good, but would probably shoot to being one of my favorite with a touch of balance. 872 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 23, 2012

Appearance: Black as pitch with oily viscosity. A hard pour yields a finger of crusty brown foam that recedes slowly.
Smell: When cold, a lot of bourbon, oak and black licorice with milder notes of dark chocolate. Malt pops out more as it warms up, bringing chocolate to the forefront along with a good amount of molasses and tar. Smells pretty good, but I could do without the ashy, tar-like malt character.
Palate: Quite a bit of ashy, tar-like dark malt flavor. Bittersweet chocolate, molasses, a bit of dark fruit. The malt character reminds me quite a bit of Scandinavian imperial stouts. Bourbon and oak are nicely integrated, and blend well with the huge malt backbone. Mildly bitter with well masked alcohol, just a bit of heat in the finish. Mouthfeel is the highlight of the beer - it's full and viscous but not under-attenuated.
Overall: Very good, but I didn't like it as much as I was expecting to. Birth of Tragedy was more enjoyable to me. 987 characterslargadeer, Apr 19, 2012

Thanks to Alex for the bottle
A-- Poured a dark brown and settled black. Just a touch of dark mocha colored film. Lots of bubbles and a bit of a collar. No more than film even with aggressive swirling. 
S-- Bourbon, oak, dark chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut and oak. Well meshed smell and very rich at that.
T-- Thin taste. Thought I would get more out of the body than this. Picked up a whole lot after a bit. Rich, thick, and out of this world after 10-15 minutes of air. See smell for the flavors in this. Just richer after a bit. 
M-- Rich, thick and coating. Long lasting flavor and really the strength of the beer. Coconut really picks up in the mouth. Not as thick as other BA stouts but man how it feels is excellent. Medium bodied and low carbonation. 
O-- Outstanding beer. Just outstanding. Well hidden AVB, long lasting flavor and just a kick ass beer. A touch too thin for me but seriously made up for it in the feel. Well balanced and well thought out. Must try beer 1,023 charactersmulder1010, Apr 18, 2012

Pours a not quite black, dark with a tan head of foam that falls and leaves tears on the side of the Great Divide tulip. 
Smell is rich, with bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and oak, coconut and toasted coconut all there. Nothing too over the top, all mingling well and still able to get both the base beer and the effect of the barrel.
Tastes of chocolate, some vanilla, coconut with a touch of bourbon and oak that keep it ticking along nicely. 
No booze, beautiful coating mouthfeel. Not the thickest body, but what is there coats your mouth amazing well, yet has you back and ready for another sip not too long afterwards.
First Hill Farmstead beer and went into it with great expectations. It still managed to excel, brilliant. Massively enjoyable. Refined, tasty and great balance. Very enjoyable to drink. Hats off to mulder1010 for this! One amazing brew. 951 charactersMrKennedy, Apr 18, 2012
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Beer pours black with almost no head and pretty serious lacing. Smell is a really nice mix of the barrel and the base beer. Bourbon comes through initially, but there's also a nice amount of roastiness in there as well. Flavor is really nice, the base beer is a very nice mix of roast and chocolate, and the bourbon/oak flavors blend with it very nicely to give it a nice sweetness and smoothness. Bourbon isn't super prominent, but still plays a nice role. Mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied and the carbonation isn't the issue I thought it might be after seeing the beer. Overall this a really nice Imperial Stout, I'm very impessed and another hit from Hill Farmstead. 669 charactersstarrdogg, Apr 14, 2012

500ml bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle #165/864. Thanks for the opportunity to try this. 
A: Flows like motor oil out of the body with much viscosity, yielding a finger of dark brown foam that gives way to scattered lacing. 
S: A medley of dark chocolate, brown sugar, bourbon, and vanilla. I get a firm oak profile with a big dark malt presence, notes of dark fruit, and licorice. I detect the faintest essence of smoke with a whisper of maple. The bourbon is present but not overpowering, allowing the quality of the base beer to be showcased as well. The roastiness is tame, which is how I like it. Coffee is a shadow.
T: Lightly earth up front with an upper low bitterness and a dash of alcohol. Bourbon quickly takes the helm, guiding me into a tranquil sea of brown sugary dark chocolate and vanilla. This sea is inhabited by scattered colonies of blackstrap molasses and licorice. The beer has a big dark malt presence without any harh or overly roasted notes. The beer finishes with bourbonic oak, brown sugary vanilla dark chocolate, and an increased but not inappropriate level of alcohol.
M: The beer is full in body with a moderate level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, viscous, and silky, with notable palate warming. Really excellent feel for the style, and considering this is barrel aged I'm even more impressed.
Overall: An excellent beer all around. I raise my glass to Damon and think back on my beloved dog lost not long ago. 1,481 charactersHopHead84, Apr 13, 2012

I was the first one at the release at 9 am and got to meet all the brewers before anyone else showed up (was pretty cool). Most people in line were pretty cool too despite the fact that certain individuals felt the need to rush to the front of the line when more than 20 other people were there before them.
Bottle 280/864
Poured into my CBS glass
A: Pours a jet black with no head. Some small lacing that it retains on the top of the beer with some bubbles.
S: Bourbon, caramel, coffee all rolled into one. The Bourbon is most prevalent.
T: Lots of bourbon but not overpowering. Some notes of Carmel and chocolate linger. Overall there’s a lot of bourbon right up front and not a ton going on after that.
M: Bourbon, pretty much entirely bourbon flavor. Not as much going on as bourbon county and there’s really one flavor and not a lot of change.
O: Great beer. I think I prefer Bourbon County but it’s better than 99% of everything else I drink. Once more Hill Farmstead does and amazing beer. 1,024 characterscodysjb, Apr 07, 2012

Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, slightly oily in consistency with some residual heat. This is an exceptional, incredibly tasty and well-balanced BA stout. If you are expecting a big bourbon bomb, you will not find it in Damon; however, the way this beer comes together is quite fantastic. 535 charactersJwale73, Apr 01, 2012

A Pours opaque from the bottle and the same in the glass. Smaller brown head forms above the body and slowly comes down leaving bubbles and froth on top. Nice signs of carbonation when I play with it and this beer looks pretty nice, big surprise from HF. 
S Sweet malts and a nice dose of bourbon are the first thing I notice. Sweet chocolate and a subtle roast are there 
T Follows the nose to a tee. Sweet roasty malts, chocolate,sweet bourbon that is well integrated. Vanilla-y bourbon on the finish makes this one very nice and complex stout. Not one flavor overpowers another, each sip is a little different.

4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I decided to open this beer for my 500th review on BA. Definitely seems worthy of the occasion, especially considering how awesome Birth of Tragedy was.
Presentation: 500 mL waxed and capped bottle poured into my new Kate the Great tulip, which seemed pretty appropiate. Served at cellar temperature after peeling the wax off.
Appearance: Dark brown to black on color, pretty standard for a barrel aged stout. Leaves a nice, dark brown lacing around the edge of the glass. 
Aroma: Big dark chocolate and fudge cake upfront. A nice slight burn from the bourbon. Vanilla, bourbon and coconut are all noticable and add nice complexity throughout. Really balanced for being so young.
Taste: The chocolate and bourbon notes really play off each other well. There is some sweet caramel and vanilla. Lots of espresso and coffee notes that add a contrasting bitterness. The barrel aging is done well and does not make the beer too unbalanced or hot. The bourbon really works and does not overpower the base beer, which seems rich and complex on its own. Incredibly easy to drink as well.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy, coats the mouth very well.
Overall, a really well done and delicious barrel aged stout. Incredibly balanced and drinkable. Definitely one of the better barrel aged stouts I've had. Definitely hope that Hill Farmstead does this more than once. 1,363 charactersGosox8787, Mar 11, 2012

Price - $20/500ml bottle
The inaugural RIS brewed by Hill Farmstead brewery. I've been waiting a long time for this one.
Pours pitch black and I mean midnight black. A one finger brown creamy head follows and fills the top of the glass with red edges. A looker, hell ya like a Victoria Secrets model dressed in lingerie. The foam appears to be a little more modest and retreats to a creamy film. Left behind is polka dotted lacing at a stand still on my snifter due to the sticky nature. The appearance is a dead ringer for the style.
Let's talk about the nose, strong and full of aroma. Chocolate, bourbon, caramel, oak and dark cherries. A faint but noticeable roastiness works it way through but can't overcome the sweet sensation. Highly quaffable and simply amazing.
Tastebud sex baby! Flavors of chocolate and soft vanilla bourbon come on first followed by layers of extras such as buttery caramel, molasses and various dark fruits. The bourbon flavor is as close to perfect as possible without being overdone. A slight booziness is noticeable but quickly forgotten with the next sip.
The mouthfeel is silky smooth and maintains that creamy look with the feel. The body is medium with low carbonation and very little bitterness. Finishes tangy and moderately dry. A little more bittering hops please..
Overall am I biased due to it being brewed by a local, your f***ing right I'am but I'll take the hit on this one. As I poured the final glass I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. This was it. The bottle is empty and the experience is over. I think this feeling is what it's all about, keep them begging for more. The last time I felt like this I was enjoying another local favorite RIS "Kate The Great". Phenomenal job Shaun and thank you for the experience. 1,833 characters05Harley, Mar 10, 2012

A - Pours black with a very slow rising, minimal head. The head never really develops and remains as lingering lacing throughout. Returns upon some sifting. The lacing retention keeps it looking good.
S - Traces of oak, chocolate and dark fruits. Nothing is too strong at all. Nice, but muted.
F - Slight oak, vanilla, cocoa, dryness from the oak that has some sweetness to balance, and then a nice cocoa/vanilla finish. Wow. There is complexity yet so much balance and smoothness. 
M - Thicker side of medium, low-medium carbonation, very silky. Although the body feels so nice, it is still a little light on the tongue.
O - HF does it again. I'm having a tough time figuring out the difference between this as an RIS and Birth as a Porter. The only real difference in the two are the flavors....and a little bit in the appearance. Fantastic all around. I wish I had a case of this. 1,025 charactersclaaark13, Mar 07, 2012

A - Pours a deep, rich almost oily black colour. Definately is clear, I could see that in the stream, but as it collects in the tulip it is inpenitrable by light. There was a half finger deep dark mocha head but that disappeared rather quickly to leave a very, very thin halo.
S - Aroma is very rich and inviting. Some sweet malts, nice chocolate roast. Lots of rich mellow bourbon on this one. Clearly a good bourbon with some nice earthy vanilla wood. There is some slight alcohol burn on the end.
T - Very smooth and mellow. Nice roasted malts and chocolate. Dark chocolate. Dark chocolate that is wonderfully intermixed with smooth good quality bourbon. Nice bourbon and oak along with some vanilla. There is a very slight warm booze bourbon finish to it.
M - Mouthfeel is very nice. Rich, creamy, thick and silky smooth. Practically no bourbon heat at all on the finish but all the nice bourbon qualities.
O - Overall, yet another excellent limited release from Hill Farmstead. Their stuff is well worth seeking out. Delicious beer that will only improve even more with age. 1,297 charactersrudzud, Mar 05, 2012

Beer is black with a nice tan head of small bubbles, moderate retnetion, low carbonation, some lacing, looks nice.
Aroma is interesting, not as bourbon forward as one might expect but excellent because I can smell both the bourbon and the yeast, mild roast, sweetness, chocolate perhaps?
Beer is medium in body, creamy, sweet, mildly oaky and bourbony, tastes nice, an interesting beer. I commented that it is slightly Black Albert like and people didn't disagree. I'd have it again, a very nice beer. 747 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 29, 2012

a - Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with two inches of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of sweet chocolate, bourbon, oak, roasted malts, vanilla, and a tiny bit of citrus. Really liking the mix of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon in the nose. Really great.
t - Tastes of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, wood/oak, toasted malts, coffee, light dark chocolate. More vanilla then the nose, and still nice and sweet. Awesome.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy with no heat at all. Easy to drink out of the bottle and easier to drink on tap.
o - Overall this is up there at one of Hill Farmstead's best beers in my opinion. I've loved some of their hoppy beers but it's really nice to see that they can do a great RIS as well. A little sweet (which I like), and nice bit of bourbon mixing with chocolate and vanilla, well worth checking out. One of my favorites from EBF and the other day. 1,191 charactersmdfb79, Feb 27, 2012

Pours a viscous black with a smallish head (though normal for a barrel-aged stout) that is a rather dark mocha leaving behind a bit of lacing. The head sticks at one-finger in height for several minutes as I let the beer warm in the glass. bottle #436/864.
from feet away I smell the dark malts, chocolate and bourbon. bringing this up to my nose I get a rushhh of oaky bourbon mixed with dark cacao, a bit of black licorice, chocolate liqueur, loads of vanilla (straight vanilla bean and vanilla extract) some molasses sweetness and some dark roasted espresso. 
starts off with some boozy bourbon, but is quickly taken over by a rush of chocolate (dark, dark cacao) that smooths the beer out beautifully. lots of vanilla, mocha, espresso, molasses, a bit of black licorice. finishes with a bit of alcohol warmth on the gullet. warming brings out more vanilla and some burnt caramel.
perfect body. creamy, subtle carbonation and a slightly syrupy feel left throughout the mouth with a sweet aftertaste and an understated warmth.

Pours a viscous dark chocolate with a large, frothy yellowish light tan head. Excellent retention, fading to a collar and spotty film. Thin streaks and dots of lacing.
Smooth, subtle aroma of roast malt, black licorice, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon in the finish.
Flavor is sweet and smooth with a subtle blend of black licorice, bourbon, mild oak and vanilla. Incredibly balance and blend between the base stout and the barrel and well restrained alcohol presence. 
Medium thick, smooth body with light carbonation and an everlasting chewy, licrorice finish.
Wow, Genealogy was amazing and Damon is as well. Both are distinct from most other stouts in their malt profile and while HF has not released many stouts yet, they are going to destroy this style just as they have IPAs. Boom! 892 charactersyourefragile, Feb 26, 2012

Leaves some nice lacing on the glass. The nose is packed with cocoa, bourbon, wood and vanilla. Smells amazing. Roasty with a touch of booze. On the tongue its sweet bourbon and vanilla up front, but then finishes with a wave of dark chocolate and some dry, earthy, dark malt bitterness on the tail end. The 10% abv is noticeable, but doesn’t get in the way of taste or enjoyment. Very drinkable for a barrel aged imperial stout. The body is smooth and creamy with light carbonation. Overall, this is phenomenal, but Hill Farmstead never disappoints. Damon is drinking excellently now, but I’m sure it will hold up or even get better in the years to come.

A- Pitch black with a nice light tannish/mocha colored head. Reduces to a ring around the edge of the glass.
S- Lots of dark malt, molassas, and good amount booze. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and nice caramel roasted malt. 
T- Extremely smooth and rich. Chocolate, some sweetness, oaky bourbon, and again some vanilla. Still quite boozy, but very good. Nice roasted malt after taste, chocolate and caramel. A very well balanced blend of flavors, though the heat is a bit off putting.
M- Smooth and silky,great body without being overboard thick. Perfect carbonation for the style in my opinion.
O- While this is still a bit hot and boozy, it shows a ton of promise and is already quite good. It really is well balanced, and the mouthfeel is already pretty perfect. With some age, I think this one should mellow out nicely.

O- This beer is awesome and probably my favorite of the HF stouts. Compared to batch #2, batch #1 has a lot more fudge and with age it has a nice light dark fruit presence and very slight oxidation. I wouldn't age this anymore as its already slightly falling off but it's still tasting fantastic. 1,064 charactersjaasen64, Feb 10, 2012
4.21/5  rDev -5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5was uber excited to get to try this guy at the extreme beer fest last weekend. went back for seconds and thirds! hopefully i'll be able to get a bottle at some point.
anyway, it pours jet black with a small tan head. smelled just how a ris should...not too much bourbon on the nose which is fine by me, i like it to be present, but subtle. tastes great. again, not too much bourbon but enough to notice...lots of roasty malt character in this one. low carbonation, but it's from a keg so no idea how the bottles will turn out. this was one of my favs of the fest along with wide awake and gorilla warfare. bottoms up 616 charactersfunkel81, Feb 09, 2012
