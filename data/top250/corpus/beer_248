S- Heavy on the tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, orange. 
T- Too much bitterness from the fruit for my taste. Like eating the rind. Other than that, it's got some sweet malt and dank hops.
F-  Thick, dry feel. Medium carb.
O- I would rather just smell it. The thing I usually like about the fish beers is that they are balanced and don't have the overpowering fruit flavor. This one is just too much. 447 charactersZoomslowik, Apr 03, 2017

4.71/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A 22 oz. bottle (no date) poured into a TH tulip glass.
Appearance- A murky darker orange with about 1 1/2 finger of foamy white head. Lacing down the glass with a nice head hanging around for most of it. 
Smell- All tropical citrus notes. No pine or anything else coming through the fruit explosion. Reminds me of a Tree House fruit bomb.
Taste- The fruits dominate the taste but there is definitely a sweetness in there too. Maybe honey or could be the mixing. There was actually a little more malt in it than I expected. 
Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation and rather thick for an IPA. Stay juicy throughout. 
Overall- A great fruit explosion. My first beer from Pipeworks and I must say I was very impressed. On par with most NE style DIPAs and no alcohol in the taste. This one really hit me before I realized what a bite it had. Recommend getting one if you have the opportunity. 885 charactersKdouble, Mar 22, 2017

Smell is really dank, with onion and mint, lemon drops and vanilla.
Taste is pine, pineapple, and cannabis, maybe a little too much, as it's almost coming off as rubbery. This is saved by some tropical notes of mango and passionfruit.
Feel is fluffy and dry. 388 charactersSabtos, Mar 19, 2017

pours a super hazy body, orange-amber, with a white head that has spotty yellow spots in it. Nice lacing, frothy retention. Really unique and nice looking. 
Aromas are SUPER citrusy. Straight passionfruit juice, if I knew what that tasted like. I'd imagine it tastes like this. Tropical paradise of hops. Pineapple citrus mango. 
On the tongue.. interesting.. it's a fruit bomb, juicy  IPA at first with citrus and grapefruit notes, and finishes with tart grapefruit and passionfruit notes. The passionfruit puree shines on the finish with the tartness. Mouthfeel is medium body and carbonation.  NO alcohol presence for 9.5%. 
Unique.. a tart citrus IPA. I really enjoyed this. 729 charactersgcamparone, Mar 17, 2017

3.65/5  rDev -18%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5Pours cloudy orange amber color with a 1 finger creamy looking off white head that was full of tiny bubbles, dissipating slowly and leaving great foamy rings as it went down. Looks like a glass of guava juice.
Smells passion fruit, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel and all things citrus. No signs of malt and not balanced at all, it's basically all citrus fruit. It smells good but almost as much like juice as it does smell like a beer.
If you like grapefruit juice then this is the beer for you: bitter, full of citrus, tart and biting with a lot of red grapefruit and lemon zest. Not my thing, too bitter and unbalanced for my liking. It hid the alcohol masterfully, but that was not enough to sway my liking of this beer overall. 744 charactersCHickman, Mar 12, 2017

Look: Dark orange, almost brown, semi hazy. Nice soapy, foam head that lingers. (7/10)
Smell: Mold, malt, sugar, tropical fruit, orange, pond, citrus. Very faint smell, not too powerful. (8/10)
Taste: citrus, passionfruit, tangerine, clementine, orange, bread, very sugary. (7/10)
Feel: Acidic, watery, citrus bite, with a nice aftertaste that leaves lemon on the palate. (8/10)
Overall: This is a decent offering, but not their best. It was too bland in hops, and too much sugar in the mouthfeel. Its a must try, but would only drink this once. (7/10) 577 characterscurtis6290, Mar 11, 2017

The citrus element of this beer is the downfall. I don't know intimately the taste of passion fruit but i do know after years of drinking Tropicana Orange Juice that that is the taste in the back end. The one that sits the longest. The honey doesn't balance out that taste enough. I really wish the honey was more present. The front is splendid but it's the back that tastes like Macro Orange Juice. If that wasn't so prominent I would give this beer a much higher score. If this is exactly what Pipeworks is going for then hats off to them but I feel their Crimson Snapper, Sure Bet and Killer Queen are more successful with fruit additions.  It's still unique and good though and I would still recommend. 786 charactersDetlef90, Mar 03, 2017

4.32/5  rDev -2.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Received this as part of a great trade with BA pagriley. I couldn't find the batch number, but I'm 99% certain this is from the December 2015 release. Enjoyed on 1/18/16 out of a 22 oz brown bomber and poured into a Speigelau IPA glass.
Appearance (3.75) - Pours a surprisingly dark-hued tawny orange color with highlights around the bottom of the glass that are more mahogany in nature. As noted, much darker than I expected, giving it almost an amber ale look. The body is also reasonably clear, although in fairness, I followed the instructions on the bottle to pour while trying to avoid getting the sediment into the glass. Atop the body sits a two-fingered head of ecru with tighter bubbles near the liquid and larger, soapier looking bubbles near the top. Retention is moderate, leaving some sticky lace on the sides of the glass and some bits of foam an the surface of the liquid.
Smell (4.25) - The rather drab looking beer isn't fair to the deliciously fruity and bright aroma that emanates from the glass. Big notes of tropical fruit, headlined by the passionfruit puree that is part of this beer, but I think it's enhanced by the Citra hops as well. There is a presence from the grain as well, with a subtle, breadiness that balances out the huge fruit character.
Taste (4.5) - And with the taste, it seems like I've reached the goal towards which this beer was striving. Again, big character from the passionfruit and some mild bitterness from the Citra hops. I also get the sense that there is some honey sweetness, although I've always been under the impression that honey ferments out in the brewing process.
Feel (4.25) - Full-bodied for the style and carbonation on the low side of moderate. In general, it's big and juicy and almost "thirst quenching"--a characteristic that I often get from Citra beers, but not usually imperial versions.
Overall (4.25), a really well-done beer. For the most part, I've not found any all Citra or mostly Citra imperial beers that I'm a fan of, although I continue to look. Something about the increased malt profile and the fruity, low-bitterness of the Citra hop just doesn't work well with my palate. However, this one is the exception. I have no doubt that the inclusion of passionfruit played a part, and perhaps the honey did as well. Either way, Pipeworks has produced a beer that is insanely drinkable given the ABV and one of which I wish I had more bottles. 2,425 charactersLambicPentameter, Jan 26, 2016

S: Strong citrus, mango, and tropical fruit notes beset by a palpable dankness
T: Complex and nuanced taste profile in three distinct parts for me that melded well with each other. First, an intense blast of passion fruit and tangerines is then greeted by a sharp amount of hops. While a bit abrupt, this bitterness is immediately subdued by a smooth honey/sweet profile that lingers on the palate
F: Medium mouthfeel that borders on heavy with above average carbonation, which complements the citra hops
O: As with a few other Pipeworks beers I've had the pleasure of trying, Spotted Puffer audaciously pursues complex objectives with aplomb. While I've unfortunately witnessed other breweries' pursuits of similar scale end poorly, Spotted Puffer is able to pull off a citrus-forward, intensely hoppy, honey IPA seamlessly. There are a lot of competing flavors in this beer, but I was amazed at how well each complemented the others. Great beer all around and one that makes a unique statement in a very crowded field. 1,168 charactersFireman_RK, Jan 14, 2016

Smell: A bit underwhelming honestly, although smell isn't my strength. Citus, honey, tropical fruit.
Taste: Very juicy, orange, tropical fruit. Tons of passion fruit obviously, almost jammy but not souring or tart. Very sweet but not nearing cloying. Big malt profile.
MF: Medium-high mouthfeel, silky, slick, lots of residual sugars. Heavy. 413 charactersSpinaltapped, Jan 05, 2016
4.57/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L - very light  color with big billowing head
S - passion fruit comes through strong on the nose
T - Passion fruit is very forward but the bitterness IPA balances out nicely. Honey adds to the passion fruit giving the sweetness extra depth
F - light color and fruity smell is a bit deceiving. Ended up being very full bodied with a slight bite after swallowing. The honey and fruit definitely mute the DIPA bite.
O - Excellent beer. Pipeworks doesn't always deliver on flavored IPAs but this one certainly did the trick. Would certainly try again if I can find it. 564 characterspbgnar, Jan 05, 2016

It poured a clear copper with white head that left a spotty lace.  The scent was extremely pleasant....pine and strong citrus.  The taste was on the sweeter side as the fruit blend they used came through noticeably and more or less dominated the beer.  The mouthfeel was fuller in body with good carbonation.  Overall.....excellent....one will not be disappointed. 421 charactersWoodBrew, Jan 04, 2016

3.93/5  rDev -11.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75650ml bottle, from the December, 2015 release, poured into a Pipeworks Ninja Teku glass.
The beer pours a lightly hazy copper color, hues of orange and gold when hit by the light with a thick, foamy, white head, nice retention and plenty of soapy lace. The aroma is nice, I definitely get the passion fruit straight away, a bit astringent and soapy, plenty of citrus, wildflower, very floral in fact, a bit sweet, certainly the honey is impacting the sweetness and the floral character, though there is some maltiness in there as well. The flavors are very similar to the nose, sweet passion fruit, honey, maltiness really pop, though I'm finding that same astringent character that was present in the nose, though the hop profile of this beer is quite juicy and flavorful, lightly floral, but really citrus forward, those citra hops are firing on all cylinders and it's a great effect, though the alcohol character does become apparent fairly quickly. Raw honey is actually a nice component to this beer, adds a bit of earthiness that compliments the sweet, fruity and juicy nature of this beer. The mouthfeel is nice, really juicy feel, coating, nice medium body with soft and gentle carbonation, really nice to sip on that finishes with just a hint of dryness and some alcohol warmth.
Verdict: A nice Imperial IPA from Pipeworks, definitely another enjoyable beer in the "Square Grouper" line of IPAs. I don't love how big and boozy it is, nor do I find this nagging astringent and soapy character too pleasing either. However, this beer is redeemed by how juicy and flavorful it is. 1,588 characterskevanb, Jan 04, 2016

L - Pours orange with slight haze.  half inch head, with heavy lacing
S - Uber tropical with a hint of dank underneath.  Passion fruit is to the fore, with a hoppy slightly catty base underneath
T - taste follows the nose - passion fruit with dank tropical hops and a hint of citrus.  Very soft bitterness on the finish, smooth
F - moderate to slightly heavier body on this one, with fine carb and a slightly chewy body (which I like in my DIPA!)
Overall this is a super solid beer.  Smells great, with the passion fruit there, but not overwhelming.  Sweetness is well controlled and balanced, without the fruit additions making it cloying or over-done.  
This is a very good 'fruited' DIPA, and is absolutely worth trying, but not sure it is any better than sure bet - it just comes down to if you like mango more than passion-fruit; I prefer mango, but if you really dig passion fruit this is going to rock your world. 962 characterspagriley, Jan 02, 2016

Smell is hops and passionfruit, okay but nothing special.  Taste is strongly of passionfruit balanced by what the hops bring.  This seems to be more fruit forward than other fish series beers from Pipeworks.  Mouthfeel is very nice, well balanced carbonation.  Overall another winner from Pipeworks, one of their best. 416 charactersnovamat, Jan 01, 2016

Look: yellow color, nice head with lots of lacing.  Very enticing looking.
Smell: Incredible.  Citrusy.  Very fruity. 
Taste: Lived up to aroma.  Incredible stuff.  Very citrusy.  Litter hoppy on the back end.  Perfect DIPA for me.  Hides the 9.5% ABV well - no booze taste at all. 
Feel: Perfect for a DIPA - not too light and not too heavy.
Overall: This beer is right up there with the best DIPAs I've ever had.  It reminded me a lot like 3F Permanent Funeral but I think even better as it hides the alcohol better than PF.  I love this stuff and happy I was able to drink a few on New Years. 638 charactersTonyLuvsBeer, Jan 01, 2016

Lots of tropical fruit, mostly intense grapefruit and and undercurrent of passion fruit but there's a sort of peppery scent as well. Taste follows but there's this odd sharpness to it that plays against the honey and passion fruit. A really good but unusual beer. 372 charactersQbdoo, Jan 01, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a miniature snifter from a 22oz bottle.
Look: great bright yellow color, fluffy head that dissipates quickly but leaves behind noticeable lacing.
Smell: Smells great! fresh citrus hops and fruit noted wofting out of the glass. 
Taste: exactly what I expected from the smell, and it's not a let down. Very fruity and barely bitter as perceived to be in a higher alcohol IPA. 
Feel: Light body, light finish, smooth all around.
Overall: I can see where the hype comes from, but maybe not worth going crazy trying to get your hands on it. Delicious nonetheless. 575 charactersBeerBrose, Jul 19, 2015
4.53/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 ounce bottle, batch #744-745, into a Pipeworks snifter.
Pours a hazy, bright orange with a quickly dissapating medium sized head.  Not much lacing.  Looks good.  Smell begins with a big burst of passionfruit, then citrusy- mostly grapefruit hops, light malt.  Taste continues the big passionfruit and the citrusy hops.  The malt kicks in to balance the bitterness, as in all the others of the series.  I found the honey to add more sweetness to this, than in the others.  No problem with that- this is delicious.  Smooth, good level of carbonation, lingers on the tongue.
Another superior beer from Pipeworks, and in the top two or three of the series- although they've all been great.  This is one you want to try and one you should try to get, any time it's around. 772 charactersstortore, Jul 19, 2015

Smell: Tropical dankness from the citra hops.  Sweetness and tartness from the passion fruit.  Smells great.
Taste: Follows the smell very closely.  The passion fruit gives the beer a tartness that is just about perfect and not overpowering at all.  The citra hops shine in the taste as well.  The honey adds to the sweetness, which balances the earthiness of the hops.
Feel: Medium bodied.  No alcohol taste is really present.  Kind of sticky - maybe from the fruit and honey.
Overall: PW's fish series never disappoints.  These are some of my favorite beers of all time.  If you see one of these, be sure to grab it. 726 characterstmryan21, Jul 13, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a mason jar. Bottled on 6/17/15, making this just over 2 weeks old. 
A: Pours a pretty cloudy dark  orange color. Soft white 1/4-inch head. 
S: Tropical fruit explosion up front. As you make your way past the pineapple, orange, tangerine, and papaya, you land square on the passion fruit. Very strong, fresh and clean. 
T: Oh yeah. Passion fruit hits first here. Tart, fresh, sweet and so tasty. Balanced in the finish is the rest of the tropical bouquet of tangerine, pineapple, tangerine. Hops all the way, no noticeable malt balance, and not needed really.
M: Full, rich. Great carbonation. Like the other "fish" beers, alcohol is really well hidden again. 
O: Now this is how you do a Square Grouper variant. The passion fruit could not be implemented any better. It doesn't really dominate the beer, but rather enhances the amazing base beer. Super balance, super drinkable, tons of flavor. I thought Crimson Snapper was the best variant thus far, but this is definitely better. I think Crimson was crafted nearly as well, but I think passion fruit just works a bit better with the Citra hop than blood orange does. Not sure if it's better than the original Square Grouper, I guess I'd have to do a side by side to be sure. Nonetheless, it's a close 1-2. 
Recommendation: Probably snatched up by now in Chicago, but absolutely worth an IP trade. Top 3-5 Pipeworks beer right here. 1,426 charactersSparty1224, Jul 02, 2015

Took some willpower to knock out a couple photographs before partaking in this one. The citra hops are punchy and are given a smattering of honey to balance out the bitterness here. The 9.5% ABV is well hidden, as this beer goes down so smoothly that the high-ish alcohol content is barely noticeable. Feeling some mango and a hint of tangerine in here also. Exceptional stuff from a brewery that keeps getting better and better. 549 charactersBarnoloid, Jun 28, 2015

The latest DIPA creation from the masters at Pipeworks, this one brewed with honey, passion fruit puree, and citra hops.  Sounds absolutely delicious.  Expectations are high considering the source.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - It pours a juicy golden orange body. One finger of soapy white head with good froth and thickness. Leaves good white bubbles and lots of sticky thin scattered lacing.  Looks excellent.
S - A most ridiculously fresh, fruity, & floral aroma. Tons of fresh beautiful Citra hop goodness, and a sweetened honey balance.
T - Taste follows the nose: extremely juicy, fruity, & floral. I wouldn't know this was brewed with passion fruit just by flavor alone, but it is very clearly heavily imparted with juicy stone fruit goodness. Drinks like a nice glass of juice.
M - Extremely smooth, fruity, and juicy.  Medium bodied with excellent carbonation.  Super smooth drinking for a 9.50% abv beer. No alcohol presence is noted at all.
Overall, an amazing DIPA from Pipeworks.  One of the best I've had from them yet, which is definitely saying something at this point.  An excellent beer in a swelling line up of excellent beers.

5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is amazing. Another Square Grouper Variant type.  Just a couple weeks ago the new batch of Crimson snapper was released and I went out and ended up getting 12 of them.  After tasting the puffer i have to go do the same thing.  They are so good, that passion fruit flavor mixed with the citra hops it just stellar.  I only have a couple left. its gonna be a sad day when they are gone.  My new favorite IIPA 411 charactersJohnny_Cardboard, Jun 24, 2015

4.46/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This is a welcome addition to the Square Grouper and Crimson Snapper school of fish.  They appeared to have dialed back the honey, compared to SG, in order to let the passion fruit have a chance to shine through.  The nose wasn't very powerful on this one, but it tastes fantastic.  Rarely is 1 bomber not enough, but that was the case here. 341 charactersVeliksta1, Jun 23, 2015
4.56/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Another great addition to this series by P-Dubs. Typical hazy, dark orange  pour and a huge nose on this one, taste is very citrus like, but not as in your face as the smell would indicate. Much sweeter than many of the other beers in this series.  In all, another HR by these guys. If you ever encounter a pipeworks bomber with a pic of a fish on it, do yourself a favor and buy it!! 384 charactersCityofWind_brew, Jun 23, 2015
