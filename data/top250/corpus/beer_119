Huge sweet trioical fruits, subtle undertones of grass, pine resins, and bread. The balance between the hops is amazing.
My my. Mango and sharp bittering pine. The bittering just cascades away. The flavors are even more balanced than they were on the nose. 
No evidence of the ABV. Smooth and full with a juicy start and a crisp finish. Low carbonation. 
Signature Trillium. Nuanced and bold. A contradiction. A new favorite. 508 charactersdogleg_left, Jun 20, 2017

Pours cloudy gold with a short-lived head and minimal retention. Aromatics are hugely tropical and dank. Pineapple, mango, candied grapefruit, white grapes, and weed. Medium bodied with a tacky, soft, resinous mouthfeel. Ripe tropical fruit abounds on the palate. Lush with mango, peach, pineapple, and pine. Hints of blossom honey and a mild warmth hint at the heft of the brew. Subdued malt and fairly dry for the style. Finishes with a slight sweetness and a sustaining tropical note.
Great beer, a bonanza of tropical citrus. 555 charactersbrewandbbq, Jun 13, 2017

Aroma is all pineapple mango, sweet orange with a white grape and pine/resin note followed by some citrus zest.
Taste is very tropical, very bright with the citrus zest on the finish and a piney/resin/dank note along with white wine/white grape. Lots of grapefruit and orange in the finish.
Fuller side of medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, you can SLIGHTLY feel the alcohol and it feels a bit heftier than most Trillium beers. 
Still great and super drinkable, but not my favorite from them. 556 charactersJohnnyMc, Dec 10, 2016

Very well balanced beer. Despite it's advertised abc, this beer is really easy to drink. This scan says happy halloween and looks like it was canned on 10/31/16. Enjoyed some other cans at Thanksgiving.

4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look: Hazy golden orange with a persistent white head. Very active. 
Smell: Juicy ripe pineapple, peach, green mango, heavy floral notes cling to the nose. The only appearance of malt is a sweet honey that gets middle by the wallop of hops. 
Taste: Juicy sticky hops explode on the palate. Peach, bitter grapefruit zest, green mango, peppery floral notes, and just a hints of sticky pine. This builds to a sweet honey malt then pops with more citrusy juicy hops. 
Feel: Big and sticky. Coats the palate. A pleasant bitter is persistent throughout. Alcohol is present with a warming in the throat. Bone dry finish. 
Overall: A more traditional style Double IPA compared to the soft juicy one typical of NE. With that said this is one gorgeous double IPA. It's big, it's bold, and it's hoppy. What more could you ask for? 823 charactersBergBeer, Nov 09, 2016

Maybe a bit 'older' than it should have been but the essence of this beer was noticeable.  Loads of orange and mango on the nose and in the taste.  Sweet malts come in the back, which I would imagine aren't as obvious when fresh because it seemed to have started to drop off.  None the less, despite all that, a very good DIPA from Trillium. 372 characterseifster82, Sep 17, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A slightly old by some folks standards 25.4oz bomber dated 5/18/16 was poured into a large tulip. The first bottle that I had a lot closer to bottle date of this was not my favorite offering from trill. 
But this one just over 8 weeks later... Yowzer!
Pours a deceadant golden orange hue with a little bit of haze. An aggressive pour left about 1 fingers worth of head that took off as fast as you can say fruity juice bomb :-) 
Nice mix of small and medium sized soapy bubbles that did leave some alcohol legs. 
The nose on this for me is oranges mostly, with some other citrus. There is definitely a presance  of some dankness just after the orangey goodness. A touch of booze is there, but certainly not outputting. Some wheat is ther too. The mosaics are leaping from the glass on this one ! Mosaic is normally not my most favorite hop, but it's showcased here extremely well. 
Taste is much like the nose, citrusy, orange and very dank, a bit earthy and the touch of alchohol toward the end.  Is there some white wine presence here too ?! 
Mouthfeel when I had the first bottle was very effervescent. And the prickly feeling I got was off putting. So much so, I didn't know if I wanted to Dinah the second pour from the bottle. But this second bottle is muuuuuch smoother. The prickly is gone, there is still some nice carb and the mouthfeel is a solid medium feeling. It's not very bitter, you definitely know it's a double, and it's dry enough to leave you wanting another sip moment after. At the same time it's got that juicy quality to it. If you know what I mean.  Is that even possible ??! 
Overall, this bottle has done real well sitting in the fridge for a couple months ! I wouldn't frown on getting a bottle of this either from the May bottling or the June bottling and letting it mellow out for a bit. I was holding off loping this one because the first was Not my fave from Trillium. But it has regained my faith and can't wait till it hits cans the next time. Mosaic hops are showcased to the fullest here I must say. Well done. 
Cheers ! 2,057 charactersSteve_Tkachuk, Jul 25, 2016

A: An opaque pale, cloudy orange pour. Smallish light tan head that fades fast. Not much in the way of lacing.
S: Oh yeah. Mango stands out with some pineapple behind it. Hints of white wine (must be mosaic).
T: More of the same. Tons of juicy mango with quite a bit of that white wine now. Pineapple and grapefruit behind it but the former two stand out. Wheaty sweetness helps balance it out but there is still a substantial burst of hop bitterness on the back end. Long lingering pine and white wine in the aftertaste.
M: Medium-heavy, soft and easy drinking as always. Quite dry.
O: Another great hoppy brew from trillium. Strong mosaic in this one, tons of white wine everywhere. Tropical flavors like mango and pineapple are abundant as well. Interesting juxtaposition. Very dry but still soft. Even has a wheaty softness to it. Not the same old IPA, that's for sure. 897 charactersDope, Jul 24, 2016

Aroma is dank up front with citrus in back end.   
Flavor- this is the high point of this beer. Dank at first, then I get wheat and biscuit taste.  Galaxy comes in late and mosaic on the back end.  Very tasty
Mouthfeel appropriate for the style
Bottom line this is a very tasty beer but a notch below tree house or the double dry hopped trillium series.  That being said, a very high quality product out of mass 486 charactersjcflorian, Jul 16, 2016

4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle, stamped 06.23.16, poured into a Trillium snifter glass. 
The beer pours a bright orange color, golden hues, cloudy and hazy with a finger or so of white head, little retention and almost no lace to speak of. The aroma is nice, intense tropical fruit, really snappy pineapple, mango skin, citrus peel, pine, oily hop spice with strong alcohol and some soft, doughy malt sweetness. The flavors are massive, really intense grapefruit peel, sharp pineapple juice, mango flesh, spicy hop oil, earthy grassiness, strong alcohol presence with only a hint of cracker malt. The mouthfeel is decent, really syrupy texture, little carbonation, not that this beer really needs it, very coating, heavy body with a dry pickle at the finish, warming booze as well.
Verdict: A GIANT double IPA from Trillium, UPPER CASE, is quite the appropriate title for this one. Really intense tropical flavors keep this one bright and enjoyable, but the exhaustingly prevalent alcohol is a disappointing distraction. A tasty beer no doubt, but hard to see this as anything more than an experiment in hop hubris. 1,099 characterskevanb, Jul 15, 2016

L: 2F+ head with poor retention, a little bit of lacing and a ring. Beer is a hazy amber orange.
S: Lots of tropical fruit like mango and pineapple, some passionfruit from the Galaxy, grapefruit, Pils and wheat malt, piney
T: Pretty much follows nose: a melange of fruitiness up front, with the sweet malts to carry over and nullify any bitterness and a bit of pine to close. Very solid.
F: Medium bodied, pretty strongly carbonated for a beer already carrying 9% ABV, but it makes it seem lighter and more crisp. Good construction and balance.
O: Another solid Trillium DIPA. 637 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 11, 2016

4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Opaque honey color with very little head
Nose: Earthy, spicy, apricot, a bit of pine
Taste: Pleasantly bitter, balancing out the floral notes, and the sharpness of pine and citrus.  A bit dank.
Feel: A little boozy, but not overly sweet or syrupy.  Lightly carbonated, which allows the dry finish to really hang on the tongue.
Overall, a different beer than most of Trillium's offerings.  Although it definitely looks east coast, it had more of the pine/forest/citrus flavors you find on the west coast, as opposed to the tropical orange juice flavors Trillium is known for. 578 charactersTrojanRB, Jun 26, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a teku pint.  Label says 5/18/16.
A- Pours a semi-hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind.
S- Tropical fruit explosion.  Mango, peach, pineapple, guava, mandarin orange, it's all there with a nice shot of grassy dankness to go along with it.  Slight booze fume.
T- Bitterness sinks in its teeth but for just long enough to accentuate the fruity hop flavor that comes along with it.  You can tell it's 9% but still isn't overly boozy.  Malt makes a slight appearance only to give some balance to the full-on hop assault taking place.
M- Sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Pretty killer, I must say.  Definitely the most alcohol-forward offering I've had from Trillium thus far but it's not over the top. 962 charactersImmortale25, Jun 10, 2016

Pours hazy golden amber with a creamy white foam head. Smells like sweet fragrant tropical fruits, overripe mango, papaya, sweet guava, pineapple, passionfruit, subtle doughy malt, some grapefruit and floral orange citrus, with resinous pine and dank earthy grass. Tastes like sweet mango nectar, papaya, guava, passionfruit, pineapple, orange and grapefruit citrus, mild white wine, subtle malty grain, with resinous pine and dank earthy grass.

I am not sure the appeal with this one. I love trillium, but this was a let down. Very light in flavor. Not tropical at all. Onion and grassy hops show the most. Maybe a touch of papaya.
Medium bodied with light bitterness.

It looks good in the glass. Slightly hazy golden orange. Nice white head
Aroma is onion and overripe (read rotten) pineapple
Taste is very mild for a 9% DIPA. Some generic fruitiness with some savory hop flavors including chive and hints of garlic.
Medium body. 287 charactersjakemn91, Jun 09, 2016

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This beer pours a slightly hazy golden orange (not cloudy like most Trillium beers) with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly. There are a few thin chunks of lacing. Smell is mango, pineapple, grapefruit, slight herbal dankness and some doughy malt. Taste is the same with a good deal of bitterness accompanying crackery malt on the finish. More bitter than other Trillium offerings. Feel is medium, starts off soft, but the prickliness from the bitterness cuts right through. Alcohol is very well hidden. Although not my favorite by them, overall this is another great beer from Trillium. What else is new? 618 charactersCNoj012, Jun 05, 2016

Nice solid trillium iipa, this one falls on the candied hops light bright citric end of the spectrum of that juicy trillium hop. I like them a bit darker and thicker and richer but a bad trillium is like a stupid smart guy...and this is far from bad, but in the land of trillium where there are dozens of 4.5+ brews this one sadly lies just below that. worth a tick though. better than most local ipas buy not mettle. 635 characterscosmicevan, May 27, 2016

Pours a deep orange hazy body - not the typical trillium haze but a little lighter. Translucent. White head that reduces to a ring of foam. Leaves spotty lacing.
Aromas are dank and piney, grapefruit and peppery. On the tongue is lots of citrus, grapefruit, pine, resinous dankness, bitter aftertaste. A little boozy. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation.
Great beer but not my favorite trillium. Missing that fresh hop punch. 502 charactersgcamparone, May 26, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750ml bottle into tulips:
Appearance: bright, and only slightly hazy golden-orange body. Less hazy than most Trillium beers, but more hazy than most other brews on the market. It's not totally turbid and juice-laden, but it's not translucent either.
Aroma: just like the Heavy Mettle I drank right before this one, the hop aroma absolutely pours out of the bottle the second the cap comes off. Mango, lemon, pineapple. 
Taste: this tastes drier and a little more cracker-malted than most Trillium IIPAs, but the hop character is still super present as well. Carries all the juicy, tropical flavors you'd expect with a hop bill containing Mosaic, Galaxy, Citra, and Columbus. If most Trillium beers are 95% hop flavor, this is probably 80%, with a nice dry finish. 780 charactersTheElectricOne, May 21, 2016
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75L: Warm golden and orange hues with a slight haziness (much less than the typical Trillium haze bomb) and ample white frothy head
S: Mango, tangerines, and a plethora of tropical fruits on the nose with a subtle dankness on the finish
T: Exceedingly smooth hop bomb; the Mosaic hops display most prominently, but the Citra, Galaxy, and Columbus all play a large part in the supporting cast. The taste is citrus forward with a slight pineapple and grapefruit bite
F: Medium body and soft finish
O: Wow - this was an incredibly balanced and just smooth tropical ride from start to finish. While many of Trillium's beers tend to push extremes in hoppiness, haziness, etc. Upper Case came across as a more refined, slightly restrained and simply more polished DIPA. This was phenomenal and one I hope they'll consider brewing more often! 833 charactersFireman_RK, May 21, 2016

Probably the best BALANCED tropical beer WITH an alcoholic burn after taste I've had.  Nothing is too much but everything is just right.  I could say this is like King Sue but better as it has the same characteristics but just better balance and just the right amount of alcohol burn.
Yeah.  So happy I decided to put my trust in the brewery and got this today.  It makes up for the infected Artaic I got previously ... Seek it out people.  Seek.  It.  Out. 509 charactersBEEPOP, May 19, 2016

Feel: Typical Trillium, medium mouthfeel that leaves the palate ready for the next sip

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a 1-finger white head. The head is gone in seconds but leaves a good bit of lacing.
The aroma brings a ton of fresh mango and pineapple, as well as some peach. I get a slight floral character as well that's almost like fresh spinach. Can't quite put my finger on it but it's quite pleasant.
The taste follows the nose. Very tropical with a fair amount of bitter pine resin. Finish is faintly peppery, like freshly baked rye bread.
Feel is medium bodied with relatively light carbonation. A bit oily, but soft and smooth. No lingering bitterness. Drinks very easy despite the higher ABV.
Overall, a fantastic, well-balanced DIPA that is extremely tropical yet has the perfect amount of resiny bitterness to balance those flavors out. 776 charactersScaryEd, May 18, 2016

A= Red tinted and closer to clear than most of the usual IPA suspects  The head is big and fluffy small bubbles and nearly pure white.  Lots of sticky lacing.
S= Big tropical hop aroma with a toasted malt scent in the background.
T= The tropical flavors come through the strongest, some mango, tangerine, sweet grapefruit, citrus zest.  A bit of dank resin in there as well.
M= Medium body with moderate carbonation. A bit of smooth syrupy mouthfeel.
O= Great brew as always from Trillium.  Worth the effort on this one.  Very big flavors, but still very smooth, easy drinking, and balanced. 650 charactersjhavs, Dec 09, 2015

Smell is how I imagine the tropical skittles factory smells on a heavy production day. Simply frikkin stunning if you're into that sort of thing.  Which I am so that works out well
Taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell but it is riddled with tropical hops with a piney resinous flavor to the burps
Mouthfeel is soft and silky with a slight carbonation bite
Overall I think this beer gets a 100 on the smell alone.  Everything else just adds to the experience.  Trillium is doing amazing things with hops, grains and yeast. A must try for sure. 632 characters2ellas, Dec 03, 2015

Aroma is that of a mosaic hop bomb: right up my alley. Overripe mango and nectarine come to mind.
I don't get the onion angle here at all,or cilantro: what I get is what I enjoy about Mosaic hops, which is a bright and vibrant juiciness with a slightly peppery finish. Galaxy,Citra and Columbus are playing an effective minor supporting role.
Smooth drinking and a tad oily 9% goes down easy.
Bravo Trillium, this is another epic hop bomb,and another reason I'm glad to have buddies in MA that share these gems. 615 charactersHendry, Oct 27, 2015

Taste is grapefruit and orange with a spicy peppery mouth feel.  Mosaic hops really shining through.  Bitter big IPA packaged nearly and while it may taste slightly boozier than most Trillium offerings, you'd probably only be noticing it if you read the 9% alcohol content before your first sip.  Excellent DIPA. 425 charactersanteatr23, Oct 20, 2015

S - Interesting mix of orange sherbet, green tea, hop oils, and peach
T - Acidic orange sherbet. Fresh, bitter hops and dank, grassy qualities combined with juicy oranges.  There's a small hint of pine too and the finises has some breadiness and pilsner malts.
F - Drinks like a single IPA rather than a 9.0% double as it isn't thick, syrupy, or resinous at all. Drinks too easily with no alcohol presence.
O - I mean, it's another stellar Trillium IPA. It combines dank, weed-like hops with orange juice and sherbet. Yeah, it's weed and orange sherbet. That's how I would describe a Triullium Imperial IPA. Just thumbs up all-around. Keep cranking 'em out, Trillium and I will keep buying. 768 charactersThrewRedButter, Oct 05, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.564 oz. Growler poured into a tulip.
Pours a cloudy straw yellow in color with 2 fingers of fluffy white head, dececnt retention and sporadic lacing. Aroma is a bit restrained, I have to search for it. Aroma is dominated by tropical fruits; lots of mango, some pineapple, and resiny pine. Some light malts linger in the background. Taste follows the aroma, very tropical. Mango is much more prominent here, it starts slow then builds to dominate the taste. Grapefruit then resiney pine appears in the finish as the hops fade. Solid bitterness and a subtle light malt backbone. Alcohol is very well masked, you know its present after having a glass (or two) but otherwise it spends it time lingering in the background. Good mouthfeel, medium-light carbonation and medium-ish body yield an almost creamy mouthfeel. Overall this is a great beer, but if I'm being critical, I found it a little bit uneven. The aroma was pleasant but lacked intensity, I really did have make an effort to find it. The taste was wonderful, it had the right intensity without being overwhelming, it was complex and hit the right notes. Bottom line: this is very enjoyable and very drinkable. No beer is perfect (as far as I've found) but this was certainly worth the wait. 1,248 charactersmnj21655, Oct 04, 2015
4.39/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a hazy golden orange hue with bright white head. Like mango meat. It's totally opaque. Bursting with tropical aroma, in particular mangoes and tangerine. Not as tropical in taste as in the aroma. A little melon sweetness followed by a lot of limey citrus. It's got a little bit of the chalkiness that you also get in Congress St. The hop character is intense, which is typical with Trillium beers. It's a little boozy. Overall, it's an intense IPA, but is more citrusy than the tropical fruit character that I enjoy. 522 charactersSheppard, Oct 03, 2015

S: Notes of mango and pineapple jump out, dank hops are also present, there's a sweetness to the aroma that's almost like a juice explosion right in my nostrils…lovely!
T: Similar to the nose. Juicy citrus/dank notes pop out. Slight bitter finish.
M: Crisp/dry/hoppy finish. Moderate carbonation. Sticky hop bitterness seems to coat the palate. 
O: After having just about every IPA/DIPA that Trillium has made this is definitely up there as far as they go. Both Upper Case batch #1 (Feb. 2014) and batch #2 (Oct. 2015) are flawless. Upper Case is a classic! 662 charactersMA_hops, May 18, 2015

A- Fairly cloudy hazed up golden body with a frothy white cap rising to over a finger. Fair retention and a puffy ring drops large sheets of lace.
S- Pungent beast of hop oils and freshness. Mangoes, tart ripe orange juice, pineapple, passionfruit, dankness and slight onion funk, peach and nectar pf tropical fruits caress my nasal receptor. Clean beyond the hop explosion.
T- Follows up on the nose with a bursting mix of tropical, stone and citrus fruits as well as dank herbs and floral tones. Mangoes, orange juice, tangerine, apricot, peach, pine resin, passionfruit pulp and pineapple hop burst.
MF- Creaminess and frothy consistency in a slightly creamy body that feels a bit lacking in that department. Carbonation medium level and could be higher to pump up the hops even more. Fairly bitter but for 9% its uber smooth.
Big juicy nectar hop bomb with great notes of mango, orange juice and dankness leading the charge. For 9% its above the vast majority. 1,058 characterscbutova, May 15, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy pale yellow color with good clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Mango, pineapple, citrus, herbal, grassy, spicy, and resiny hops followed by biscuity, toasted, bready, and caramel malts.   Some slight alcohol in there too.
Taste:  Nice ripe tropical fruit, citrus, grassy, herbal, grassy, and spicy hops with nice wheat, toasted and biscuity pilsner malts, and caramel malts.  Some alcohol and slight bitterness in the rear too.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, light to medium bodied, light bitterness, medium carbonation, some alcohol, and a little chewy. 
Overall:  I need to get another bottle of this before it's gone.  Tasty and delicious.  Reasonably priced and we'll worth it. 902 charactersFlounder57, Apr 15, 2015

S- Spicy NZ hops, citrus, tropical fruit, caramel, toffee, crackers. Nice complexity and has that mineral profile that most Trillium beers have.
F- Citrus, tropical fruit, spice, caramel. Nice complexity to it, not too bitter but not too sweet. Good balance.
M- Medium bodied, soft and velvety, nice carbonation, smooth and easy to drink. Reasonably bitter but not overwhelmingly so.
O- Great DIPA, one of the better ones to come out of Boston as of late. Highly recommend. 558 charactersStevedore, Apr 08, 2015

The smell that came out of the bottle let us know we were about to try something great. I actually have to rate this so slightly higher than the HFB Abner simply due to two simple facts... 1.) I have to go to the brewery or a tap room to give it a try (accessibility to bottles or cans is "feel" trait for me)... and 2.) have to give just slight props for such a great beer coming from the home state! 
P.s. At 9%... you could totally have a three- way with one bomber and all still walk away satisfied. 576 charactersfulcrumbs, Apr 02, 2015

Served in a snifter
Slightly hazed, golden yellow appearance with amber accents. The beer was much more transparent than your average hoppy offering from Trillium. A small, bubbly, off-white head topped the liquid but it quickly faded to a thick, lasting ring. Streaky, sticky lacing trickled along the glass.
The nose was made up of simply everything you could possibly want to find in a double IPA. Incredibly hoppy and dank with intense tropical fruit notes. There was an equal balance between marijuana and bright, lively passionfruit. Mango also came through strong. Rich and fruity. Moderately sweet. Super juicy with loads of peach and tangerine. A subtle, honey-like quality appeared as well.
The flavor profile was super hoppy and intense yet remarkably well balanced. Tangerine notes were most apparent. Perhaps some canned mandarin slices. Uber juicy and fruity. Nice pale malt backbone. Just enough for balance, but not too much to get in the way of the hops. Peachy with tropical passionfruit notes. Touch of candied orange peel on the finish but absolutely no bitterness. The 9% ABV was nowhere to be found. After the swallow, a hint of rind-like pithiness appeared.
On the palate, the beer was frothy and foamy. A bit pickly. The liquid contained a lively, spritzy effervescence. A bit thinner and more carbonated than Trillium's other DIPAs.
Upper Case is a cleaner, thinner and more balanced double IPA than what I am used to from the guys at Trillium. Although I loved the incredibly complex, intense and rounded flavor profile, I felt it lacked a bit of the intensity and brashness found in Vicinity and the Mettle variants. 1,739 charactersDamian, Mar 31, 2015

So tropical... the mango, the clementines, the pineapple. But then you get some citrus.. grapefruit, orange zest... then you get a little bit of dank, resinous pines. and it doesnt stop there, you can taste malts as well as a little bit of yeast.
Its almost like you can taste every single ingredient that was used in making this beer. And when you put it all together, it creates liquid gold. 
absolutely perfect. 550 charactersCoorsy, Mar 29, 2015

The aroma is absolute hop juice. The Mosaic hops pummel my nose. Some people don't enjoy the almost oniony quality of Mosaic, but I love it. It's also incredibly tropical-fruity. A previous reviewer cited descriptors such as "cilantro and plant stems" and they nailed it. Still, the tropical fruit medley is impressive. I get a ton of guava, mango and pineapple. The flavor explodes once it hits my tongue. Such a concentrated hoppiness. Elixir, extract, nectar. The green onion, cilantro and stem-spice of the Mosaic is in elite form. Galaxy, Citra and Columbus hops also add plenty of hoppy depth. Mango, papaya, pineapple and guava hop flavors. I get signature Citra flavor as well as a passion fruit/moss flavor combo that I equate with Galaxy. It's half tropical and half green. I really love when a hoppy brew can balance between those elements. The malt is signature Trillium dense pastry and sugar. It really props up the lupulin. Body is creamy and fairly full. Bitterness isn't necessarily searing. It lingers but doesn't obliterate. I enjoyed this beer a ton. Up there with Heavy Mettle and Fort Point in my book. It really reminds me of Dinner by Maine Beer. Maybe not for everyone but definitely fits my tastes. 1,312 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 28, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. This was bottled today.
Appearance: Pours a hazy light amber and leaves a finger of fairly dense white head that fade very slowly to a white layer atop the beer. (4.5)
Smell: Mild pineapple, juicy bubblegum, light bready malts, citrus rinds. (4.5)
Taste: Pineapple, light bubblegum, some bready malts, mango, grapefruit zest. Really well balanced and drinkable. Actually pretty subtle for a Trillium IPA. Drinks lighter than a DIPA. (4.5)
Mouth-feel: Medium carb with a medium to full, creamy body. Definitely not bitter. (4.75)
Overall: Going into this I was expecting the standard (and delicious) hop bomb I've come to love from Trillium, but this one's different. Really balanced for a DIPA, really drinkable and with some different, interesting flavors. Definitely tasty and a nice experience. (4.5) 862 charactersResuin, Mar 25, 2015
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:  Pours a slightly hazy amber color capped by a two-fingered head; slivers of lacing line the glass
Smell:  Bright and floral, with mango, pineapple and a hint of herbal and grassy tones
Taste:  Angel food cake malt (and just a hint of it) underpins the hops and what a blast of tropical fruit they bring - mango and pineapple dominate, with subtle tones of passion fruit and grass; the finish has some residual sugar but the hops provide most of the flavor
Mouthfeel:  Medium body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  For a DIPA, this beer hides the alcohol; a well-executed example of the west coast style from a Massachusetts brewer 649 charactersbrentk56, Mar 25, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer wasn't as much of a hazy juice bomb compared to other trillium IPAs. I see this as a good thing, it is nice to see them switching it up a little. Huge mosiac smell. The other hops really balanced out the mosiac well, which is probably the thing i like most about this beer. There is some powerhouse hops in this beer but none of them overpowered eachother. I tasted a little more bitterness compared to other trillium beers which is another plus for me. Overall fantastic, one of my favorite offerings from one of my favorite breweries. 546 charactersEvmo31, Mar 24, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer comes in a completely hazy bright orange color.
The aroma hits of tangerine, passiofruit, grapefruit zest, sweet and overripe tropical.
The flavor hits of juicy orange, grapefruit, with lots of doughy flavors with its creamy mouthfeel. There's a resinous back end of bitterness.
Cold, the beer is dangerous, but then starts showing a more substantial mouthfeel and breadiness as it warms up. 403 charactersdar482, Mar 24, 2015

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5March 17th 2015 bottle, opened 4 days later on March 21st 2015. 
Scored after a cold morning of waiting at Trillium's 2nd anniversary release day.  Opened and reviewed later that day in a sunny park in a small town in Massachusetts on the way back home to New York.
Great day.
A - Hazy, soft yellow gold body with a finger and a half of off-white head.  Ok retention and nice lace.  
S - More acidic and herbal than most of the hop forward Trillium beers I've had.  Lemon, cilantro, plant stems, lime zest, and a touch of orange.
T - Grassy with softer green bitters, weeds and wild flowers.  White bread and agave backend with a woody herbal edge.
M - Soft, medium-light frame.  Par carbonation.
O - A really nice soft and sessionable take on the style. 761 charactersvfgccp, Mar 21, 2015
