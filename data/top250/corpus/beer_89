Beautiful Dark ruby color, almost no head. 
Aroma is moderate sour, red fruits, hay, barn, funky, lots of blueberries in the finish. 
Very drinkable. 163 charactersNicolaiw, Dec 14, 2016

I just think it's impossible to get the strong blueberry taste like you do with a peach or raspberry lambic.  This beer was one of the best blueberry lambic/sours I've ever had.  I had it along side a lot of different blueberry beers and this one was one of the top 3.  the funk was soft and the sour notes were very light but it was very smooth and I'd definitely trade high for this again 452 charactersfireazzi, Nov 19, 2016

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice slightly hazy blueberry juice hue with a light pink head that fades to leave sticky lacing and a thick blanket. 
S - Aromas of incredible blueberry, berry skin. Excellent light funk, basement and cheesy funk, soft lemons. Really really fragrant. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, tons of blueberry skin and tannins, loads of funk, cheesy basement. The acidity is nice, but the tannins are a bit too over powering. 
M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, very clean with a good funk. 
O - Overall this was a very good lambik. Excellent blueberry notes with really good funk. Excellently crafted.

Huge frothy head, pink blueberry thick head fades semi slowly with big lacing, slight hazy dark purple maroon berry juice color.
Nose is incredible! Loads and loads of blueberry, fresh blueberry and aged funky, great lambic funk, earthy tart sour funk, sour lambic tart berry skin, blueberry flesh, juicy as Hell.
Taste brings tons more blueberry, big berry skin, little bitter tannin, acidic funk, lambic acidic funk, funky wild acidic lambic tart earthy, blueberry seed, tart funk, delicious but tannins and acidic bite are a bit too much.
Mouth is med bod, nice carb, good acidity.
Overall awesome, incredible but some parts could be better. 722 charactersjlindros, Oct 01, 2016

Had a quarter pour side by side with a myriad of other blueberry beers.  Big take away was I surprised how soft and not sour this was.  Tart yes and still got that Cantillon funk.  Got more berry flavor as it warmed.  I've heard this beer is really over-hyped and compared to the other blueberry beers out there I still think this is a very special beer.  Maybe bluberry sours in general are just not as flavorful and jammy as raspberry, cherry, apricot, etc.  Proabably wouldn't seek it out again but was still a great beer to have. 546 charactersShogun250, Sep 19, 2016

4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75A 375ml bottle at Himmergiet of the 2015 Vintage. Poured into a mini wine glass.
Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy ruby red dark purple colour with a one finger pinkish purple head that had good retention and sparse lacing.
Aroma: Blueberry, tart, funk, some acidity and lemon.
Taste: Blueberry, sour, tart and light funk.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with moderate to high carbonation.
Overall: Wow, this was just special. One of the best Cantillon offerings I’ve tried along with the Lou Pepe Framboise. It’s just too bad I missed the 2016 release in Copenhagen by two days as I would have loved to open another bottle. 629 characterskitch, Sep 08, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a rich bluish, purple with healthy blueberry yogurt head.  Bottom of cork and nose smells like spontaneous funk with minimal barnyard mustiness but with healthy blueberry aroma.  Taste is young lambic citric acidic sourness with big tannic presence, a bit of lacto, and slight but real blueberry undertones.  Mouthfeel is full but the finish is very bitter and dry.  Overall, this is one of the best blueberry beers I've had but it's a difficult fruit to conquer.  Age would tone down the bitterness and let the lambic base come around but would likely diminish the amazing nose and kill the fruit from the taste.  Great beer but I prefer many of Cantillon's other offerings. 681 charactersIrishColonial, Sep 01, 2016

S: Tons of that lovely Cantillon funk with a complimenting undertone of fruit that smooths out the nose. 
T: Similar to smell; perfect funkiness, and just the slightest hint of juicy blueberry. The most authentic blueberry flavor I've ever experienced in a beer. 
F: Great carb level; does just enough to cut through the juicy funk so that the taste both coats and lingers for further enjoyment.
Overall, this lived beyond what I had expected. Blueberry is such a difficult flavor to impart into beer, and Cantillon, once again, blew me away. I'm stingy with chasing down hyped beers, but this is one I would recommend again and again. 723 charactersjolly_lynch, Jun 13, 2016

A purple/pink frothiness that sits atop the beer. Aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer. Earth, vinegar, wood, and of course, a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe, tart blueberries. The flavor was probably not as complex as other Cantillon beers I have had but it was surely impressive and flooring. It starts off very tart. A bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine. I loved how dry it finished. Each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor. The body was light and the tartness lingered. Probably won't have this again so it was definitely a treat. 746 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 26, 2016

Pours deep reddish purple with a one and a half finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small webs of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smells of sweet/tart fresh picked blueberries, the ever present Cantillon musty brewery funk, some mild lactic sourness, yogurt and finally some grains. Taste follows the same path with plenty of tart blueberries and lactic sourness up front followed closely by the must and finally the lightly chewy grains. Feel is slightly grainy quickly being enveloped by plenty of musty sourness and slight sweetness from the berries.
Overall an excellent fruit lambic. I still prefer a few of there others more but I would never turn down another chance to try this one. Glad to finally get to try it, thanks again Justin! 920 charactersorangesol, Apr 18, 2016

Tried at Himmeriget, Copenhagen; 160 Danish Krone for the 375ml bottle
Excellent stuff from Cantillon & easily the best of the albeit limited selection of lambics I've tried so far. Starting with a nice cherry & raspberries taste, the blueberries came through strong soon after & there was plenty funk/tart too. An excellent balance & great mouthfeel, the beer had a lingering sourness that stayed with you after each sip; excellent stuff & a must try if you can find it. 505 charactersflyingpig, Apr 08, 2016

There's a hint of a lactic/yogurt type of funk and sour on the nose.  Not getting the fruit on the nose, but blueberries aren't extremely pungent.  The flavor is fairly acidic.  There's a funky tannic quality that I assume comes from the fruit.  It's not a perfect marriage between the base beer and the fruit.  It closely approximates the overtly sour american wild ales.  Not my favorite offering from the fruited Cantillon portfolio but also very unique to that end.  A "bottleshare" beer in my opinion that can be tasted and discussed among friends rather than a full solo drinking experience. 711 charactersPHBoiler, Apr 04, 2016

Must take a lot of blueberries to make this.  Aroma was tart, sour funkyblue cheese blueberries, really dropped that on me something fierce, amazing ass aroma.  
Taste, wow, just wow.  Possibly the best Cantillon.  Thick blueberry sour pancakes with goat cheese. 362 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 23, 2015

S: It has that funky cheesy aroma that makes Cantillon so good. There is no fruit in the aroma.
T: classic Cantillon. There is a decent amount of blueberry present but you absolutely need to wait until the beer warms up significantly before tasting.
M: Same as most Canillion. It is thin and has sharp carbonation like a lambic should be.
O: Great beer but probably overhyped. The blueberry is amazingly well balanced with the lambic and adds a unique flavor to a lambic. 535 charactersjvillefan, Nov 21, 2015

- Pours a murky dark purple with a bit of pinkish white foam.
- Smell is quite mild actually, with a bit of berry and hay.
- Taste is nice tart blueberry up front with a whole bunch of musty funk behind that. Relatively low acidity and not very sour at all. The finish has a bit of an earthy bitterness. Not too dry, a little low on the carbonation, but the multiple layers of funk really make this beer unique and interesting. 
- Overall quite the treat. Complex with a lot of mustiness and not overly sour which allows more of the subtle notes to come through. Obvious this beer demands a lot for trade, but glad I got to try. I've seen mention of bad things about the 2013 vintage, but I still enjoyed it a lot (I don't have a comparison with other years). 819 charactersdeschutes_fan, Nov 05, 2015

Pours a dark purple, ember red color, with a dark pink, small head. The head collapses immediately to a glass coating sheet of lacing, revealing tiny bubbles at its edge.
The nose reveals a great blend of funky barnyard, dusty malts and unripe blueberry skin. Once the aromas open up, a ripe fruit tone becomes present, together with a mineralic quality, reminding of an actual fruit juice. Its tartness is present enough though, to prevent the beer from becoming jam sweet, also due to a light note of wood bark, wet spruces and leather.
Has a wonderful soft mouthfeel, while the beer reveals a lively, mineral accentuated carbonation, adding an utmost pleasant softness to its profound tartness.
Blueberries become visible in a prickly, unripe way and turn sweeter, once earthy malts wrap up the beers tart qualities. Berries don't get overly prominent on their own, but provide a great balance together with the present, pleasantly dry funkiness, ending with a ripe, wood accompanied, mellow sweetness. Its finish exhibits a great range of intense flavors working together with the fruits, consisting of lemon zest, a mineralic softness and a note of old, soft cheese, highlighted by the fantastic mouthfeel.
A great beer with an authentic, well integrated fruit character, which goes hand in hand with the typical Cantillon lambic sourness. Still, the most outstanding aspect of this beer is its phenomenal soft mouthfeel. 1,451 charactersaleigator, Oct 09, 2015

color is deep magenta, ruby red with a purple tinge, half inch of foam...looks beautiful!
Nose is funk, blueberry, cherry, lemon
Taste is fantastic, blueberry fruit mixed with lemon, some funk and tartness with a hint of plastic-essence... really delicious flavors though not as in your face (concentrated) as, say, lente which explodes in your cheeks!
Drinking great right now, but may improve with age.... 460 charactersReady4aHeady, Sep 26, 2015

(A)- A sexy crimson burgundy color with some purple-like highlights. Some light white froth that dissipated quickly
(S)- Mildly tart up front but rich jammy blueberry fruits. Subtle oaky funk. Slight stone-like mineral bit on the finish. A dynamic smell despite some age on the bottle
(T)- Just a sexy beer. Rich, jammy blueberries meets a stoney oak funk. Mildly tart to really up the complexity
(M)- A fantastic carbonation level. Silky smooth with just the right amount of fruit, tartness, and oaky funk to balance well yet still creating a complex and dynamic mouthfeel
(O)- So happy to have finally tried this very long time want. It is not Cantillon's best, but that is like saying I had mediocre sex. . . its still sex 790 characterssweemzander, Sep 10, 2015

Taste follows, tart blueberry meat and a touch of structure from the skins. The truest taste of a warm summer blueberry I've had, but lacking depth. I sense that you need something of a neutral background for this delicate flavor to avoid being swallowed. As a canvass for showcasing that ephemeral flavor, excellent. But lacking the complexity and layers of many other lambic. An incredible summer beer though if only it were relatively easy to acquire. 559 charactersKurmaraja, Aug 18, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +5.1%Shared a bottle at Olbutikken with Morten and others in the store. Was happy to be able to try, but concerned about the hype. No worries, An amazing lambic. Absolutely beautiful color and clarity. Nose was so fresh and bright. Funk was  upfront. but gently restrained. Really enhanced rather than dominated the flavor Blueberry flavor was complex and reminded me more of eating slightly unripe berries from the garden. Leaned toward tartness rather sweet blueberry pie. Malts and yeast merged to provide additional flavors and accents. Smooth, delightful carbonation. Wonderfully drinkable
It's a shame that this beer is not more available. Understand why, but this would be such a great beer outings, accompanying picnics, sipping on the deck and sharing with friends. This is  not a beer to limit to tastings and talk. 820 charactersBillRoth, Oct 11, 2014

4.73/5  rDev +4.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a tumbler glass at Øltibukken store in Copenhagen Denmark.  Vintage 2014, 375ml bottle.
Big deep ruby red color like a gem.  An absolute crystal clear gem, no hints of darker or lighter hues of different colors.  Shines crystal clear.  A faint pink head dissolves with a little bit of suds, but even manages some carbonation while in a simple conical tumbler.  One of the most impressive colors on any beer I have ever seen.  Doesn't get any better for a lambic.
Fascinating aroma.  Bouquet fills with earth funky notes, slightly ashy but even more so with hints of garden mushroom and fresh tilled soil.  Fruit angle is all over and surprisingly varied.  Blueberries of course but also sour cherry, raspberry, even peach like fuzz which works out amazingly.
THe first sip is exquisite.  While the fruit comes nicely with funky aromas, there is a great melding sweetness of balsamic vinegar to match.  It's as if it is drizzled all over a salad bowl filled with fruits of cherry, blueberry and so forth.  Great funk acid tones on this, with much of the earthy bouquet matching nicely.  
Everything is incredibly balanced with wild yeast taking the first notes, and fruit following with sweet acidic tones.  Not quite Rodenbach sweetness but unique all it's own.  Extremely complex and balanced.  The feel even for a lambic, does come off a little less impressive.  Depth in malt even comes across light, but the flavors easily push through. Fun carbonation. Hinting at light seltzery qualities but never getting there from a large palate that is complex
What more needs to be said?  A great lambic, probably the best blueberry beer of any style by far I have ever had.  Not my favorite Cantillon, but does this get any better?  No, unequivocally not even close. 1,795 characterssmakawhat, Oct 04, 2014

From a 37,5cl bottle into a tasting glass
Vintage: 2012
APPEARANCE: Pours a medium looking, foamy, white head with lousy retention. Head fades down to a ring rather quickly. A nice maroon red color, hazy, with no carbonation evident. A ring remains but leaves no lacing on the glass. A nice color, but rather unimpressive head. 
SMELL: Quite nice. Funky acidic notes, with lots of berries and some tart lemon aromas on the nose. Reminds me mostly of pomegranate aromas, strangely enough. Rather enjoyable and well balanced between the fruit and funky lambic. 
TASTE: Not quite as impressive as the aroma, unfortunately. A little empty up front with some acidic sourness initially. Tart lemon flavors and some sweetness from the berries come through the middle into the swallow. Bolder flavors come out after the swallow with acidic, tart lemon, light funk and some sweet pomegranate lingering on the palate. Sweet fruit with tart lemon and acidic notes linger on the palate. Rather nice and well balanced after the swallow, though a touch empty up front. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy and smooth enough on the palate, lighter, goes down fine and finishes dry and slightly puckering. A strange sensation of pomegranate slivers stick to the back of the throat, like you were drinking the juice. 
OVERALL: This is a solid fruited lambic for sure. Very enjoyable, and on the same level as many of their other fruited lambics. The berries are rather subdued compared to some of the other examples of the style, but that is part of the art in building complexity. I also wouldn't necessarily describe the flavor as blue or blackberries, as pomegranate tastes, and feels, much more accurate here. Nevertheless, this was enjoyable and I was very happy to finally drink this one at the source. Cheers gents! 2,002 charactersJeffo, Apr 26, 2014

A - Ruby red body with a light clean white head to it
S - Blueberries, sweet tarts, blue cheese and barnyard funk
T - Really funky with lots of blue cheese and barnyard, not tart as all but instead is all funk. Light tart blue berries but barely blueberries or tartness to it. It was a pure funk bomb
M - Really dry and slightly watery body. A slight thickness from the funk remains on the tongue kinda like the creamy layer that remains after you eat some blue cheese
O - Not that impressed and thought this was really overrated as this was one of my least favorite Cantillon to date. Really a funky beer but not much tartness or fruit flavor to it 666 charactersjeonseh, Jan 14, 2014

Gorgeous crimson with a surprisingly resilient small white head which picks up some of the colouring from the beer. Abates to a collar. Looks lovely.
Nose shows delightfully honed acidity. Surprisingly modest blueberry but beautiful integration. Lightly musty, musky and tannic.
The base Cantillon gueuze is quite conspicuous. Blueberry is again mellow but seamlessly integrated. Base gueuze notes of jalapeno and lemon are well represented.
Assertive sourness but definitely much reduced compared with most other Loons. Mild tannins. Satisfying and great drinkability.
Only had about 3 oz which probably biases my rating downwards, as this seemed uncharacteristically subtle and restrained (for Cantillon), the sort of beer that takes a bit more volume to deconstruct. 861 charactersspicelab, Jan 02, 2014

Pours a beautiful raspberry colour with nice white head. Glorious red as though it was made with raspberries. Nose is lactic funk, wine, blueberries, creaminess, some subdued perfume, little burnt rubber.
Taste is grapes, red wine, creamy, dried oak, almost oyster-esque decadent sourness and drying finish.
Mouthfeel is drying, oaky and champagne-y. Similar finish to most Cantillons.
This is not a let down and totally worth it. Perhaps rating a bit according to the occasion but still deserving of praise. 568 charactersdanieelol, Jan 01, 2014

Shared by Brad (ygtbsm94). Thanks so much for making this happen! 
This old bottle poured a nice murky purple-ish color, with the gorgeous pink head that everyone raves about. It actually had a good amount of head, considering it's age. Smell was predominantly blueberries and old, musty funk. It's awesome that the blueberry aroma is like actual berries, not some artificial stuff. Probably my favorite thing about the Cantillon lambics is that the real-fruit smells and flavors come through, even with age on them. The taste was stunning. Of course, there were loads of blueberries. I think with age, this beer has probably changed substantially, but everything was in it's right place. The bretty kind of funk was blended in nicely with the fruit, and a good lactic sourness tied it all together. I also picked up an interesting cinnamon note, which I have noticed previously in the cherry sours. Mouth feel was soft and lightly carbed. This beer is damn near perfect, and my review doesn't do it justice. Looking forward to trying another bottle, perhaps a fresh one, down the road. Drink this if you can; it is well worth the hype. 1,177 charactersbrother_kenneth, Dec 07, 2013

Took a tasting glass @ Borefts 2013, split the rest with some people. Cork is wet on top & has taken some of the beer in, looks purple at the bottom, this one of the old Cantillon corks. Appearance is incredible, radiant purple, red grapes, pink shades, head is incredibly radiant pink but sadly disappears immediately, this looks incredible. Smell is old musty, blueberry & red grape skins, slight berries, cork, brett, funk,… not bad. Taste is musky grape skins, blueberry skins, old musty, cork, old wine, floral, musty, funk, light tart, brett,… Very dry, finishing carb. More grape skins than blueberry, not that impressive by Cantillon standards, this is a bit like St. Lamvinus but not as neat as the better bottles of that one. I will give it a good score because it is a good brew but I have rated other Cantillon’s much higher. This is clearly way overrated because it is rare but actually obtainable, that is just it. 993 characters77black_ships, Oct 23, 2013

Beer pours a hazy grapefruit juice color. Very interesting. I've never seen a beer that looks like this. Fizzy and intriguing. A red/purple glow permeates the beer.
Smells pretty damn sour. Lactic and green apple skin. Of course, a nice blueberry scent. It's not a sweet blueberry preserve smell, but instead a fresh tart blueberry smell.
Taste matches the smell. There are tart fresh blueberries, heavy lactic, some vinegar, some lemon, some green apple skin. There is funk in here, but to me it is covered by the flavor. Quite sour. Most sour beer I've had next to Beat.
Mouthfeel is medium, fizzy, and finishes pretty dry. I get one of those "I want more" sensations after each sip due to the lactic and dry finish.
Overall, this was very impressive. 847 characterslunarbrew, Sep 17, 2013

Seriously. Thanks again, Brian, aka 4DAloveofSTOUT. Poured into a Cantillon wine glass tday, 9/15/2013, which is my first ear anniversary. Review #208.
Okay, so this beer pours something amazing. Its like this ruby grapefruit colour, so orange yet so purple at the same time. I cannot truly describe how great this beer looks. It pours with a typically Cantillon effervescent sour head that retains very well with a great film on top. Its just truly a great looking beer, even compared to Fou' Foune.
Smell on this is interesting. I can definitely smell that brewery funk; it takes me back to the brewery even more than Classic Geuze does. It's just funky, yet has that tart, ripe blueberry flavour that truly takes this beer somewhere else. The blueberries are there in such a way that Fou' Foune's apricots are, such that it doesn't take away from that Cantillon prototypical funk, but it adds so much more to it. Not gonna lie, this smells sour and just tasty at the same time. 
Flavour is even better than the smell. It's not the most sour beer I've ever had (that still belongs to Beatification b5) but it is just so complex and well-melded together... only second to Fou' Foune's apricots. It's sweet yet so damn sour at the same time.. while spewing out that classic Cantillon earthy funkiness. This is where I realize that the rarity itself on this beer is not the only thing driving this beer's ratings up, this beer stands very well on its own. No question about it.
Mouthfeel is typical Cantillon. Medium bodied yet so smooth and well-carbonated. The aftertaste is that classic Cantillon funkiness, horseblankets and barnyard flavour straight up. I can't imagine 3F doing anything better than this, because I'm just a huge fan of that Cantillon funk. Probably because of the great memories behind our trip to Cantillon in Anderlecht.
Okay, so I can honestly say that this is beer really lives up to the hype on its own merits, because that blueberry sweet AND sourness contributes a lot to this beer, more so than Bordeaux grapes or more cherries have done. I wish Cantillon would make a year-round blueberry lambic so that we could get this one more easily. Its an über whale because of its several hundred bottles-a-year production, but I will strongly, strongly recommend that everyone who likes sours, try to get one of these bottles at least once in their beer lifetimes.
Re-review: Had the opportunity to sample 2011, 2014, and 2015 vintages. Stemmed glass 4/30/2016. I specifically would like to state that the 2015 fresh vintage was excellent, and may reach the level that the 2011 bought. Specifically, the blueberry fruit was pungent on the nose and to a lesser extent, the palate. Blueberry seems to be a difficult one to pull the essence out of in beer, but this is a pretty good example when done right. The 2015 had a nice big presence to go with the underlying Cantillon funk, and 2011 retained that strong blueberry depth while funking up some more. However, the 2014 was underwhelming in terms of the blueberry. Not sure if it is the lack of blueberry flavours period (harvest related?) or if it has to do with the background of the lambic. Either way, I did not think 2014 was worth going after, but 2015 has the potential to do well with time, and perhaps as well as the 2011 did. 3,544 charactersStevedore, Sep 15, 2013

I just about fell off my chair when I pulled this out, my biggest want for as long as I can remember.
3rd 40th birthday beer of the day. 2011 375ml bottle.
Appearance. Pours a nice looking, hazy, purplish-pink with s finger + of pink head with a hint of blue. 
Smell. Nice and sour with that great woody funk, classic cantillon funk that is. Sour blueberries are there for sure ...the little wild sour ones that grow on the mountain, not the big fat sweet ones that are farmed out this way. Not sure what else to say, blueberry cantillon lambic, fuck yeah.
Taste. Oh man, sour blueberries, so tasty. Lots of that nice woody funk that anyone who's tried Cantillon knows and loves. It's a medium level of sourness and the blueberries are there, but a little more faint than I had imagined. Not like blueberry juice or anything, just amazing lambic complimented with the nice blueberries. 
Mouthfeel. Lighter body, fine medium-low carbonation. 
Overall. Expectations were high and I was not let down. Fantastic stuff. Wish it was part of the regular line up. Again, huge cheers to Jeffo for this bottle of blueberry heaven. 1,261 charactersRutager, Sep 01, 2013

A: Pours a nice light purple color with a thin white head on top, mostly forming a ring. Thin lacing with nice retention. 
S: Fantastic fruity aroma. Lots of blueberries with a bit of sour/funk typical of Cantillon offerings. There is a bit of cheese that comes out as it warms. 
T: Jammy blueberries with a slight tartness. Nice funk/cheese on the flavor as well, which blends nicely with the fruit for a fantastic flavor profile. 
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Not overly tart, slightly dry. 
O: An amazing beer. Going in I had high hopes, which were tempered from others who have had the beer previously. I will agree that it is amazing, but I would rather drink other Cantillon beers which take less effort/cost to get. 807 charactersmdaschaf, Aug 29, 2013

I couldn't wait to try this beer with my affinity for blueberries and Alex hooked it up yet again, thanks! I've never seen a beer pour quite like this one. The body glows rusty red with definite grape juice-like highlights throughout. Little chunks of blueberries float throughout the body and can be easily seen through the fairly clear liquid. The head is what makes this beer stand out like no other. A thick, fizzy cap has good staying power and shows off an incredible purple fizziness. I've never seen a head that's taken to the color of berries used as much as this lambic does.
The aroma is out of this world mouthwatering. There's that familiar Cantillon funkiness with all the wonderful dusty attic qualities and slight lemon acidity. Over the top of the funk are handfuls and handfuls of perfectly ripe, pungent blueberries. The funk runs deep below the blueberries and deeper pulls send off some cobwebs and wet rock with a slight wheaty twang. This doesn't have the huge funkiness of some other Cantillon products but the blueberries are showcased incredibly well.
The flavor can't quite stand up to the otherworldly aroma but comes awfully close. The blueberries aren't as vivid as the nose led me to believe but the flavor becomes more of a balance between the semi-tart blueberries and Cantillon funk. Mineral qualities abound with the always noted wet rock. Dusty barnyard aromatics more in the line of old wood than the usual horseblanket. Some lemon acidity kicks in and there's a decent amount of lactic sourness. The blueberries are still the showcase but balance more so than the aroma led me to believe.
The body is right where it should be with this lambic, light and airy. The carbonation shows a liveliness that pushed things through and manages to scrub the tongue clean for the next swig. A mild sweetness starts things off but quickly moves into the moderate tartness pushing through the finish before another quick flash of sweet counteracts the sour. 
Drinkability is through the roof. It's hard to even set the glass down, which I didn't do at all but tried plenty. The tartness is super refreshing while the touch of sweetness keeps it from ravaging the tastebuds. I could drink this beer all day long if was allowed, no question.
I've been looking forward to drinking this lambic for ages now and can't thank Alex enough for sharing a bottle. Hopefully I come across more in the future. Blabaer is another homerun hit by the incredibly imaginative guys over at Cantillon, keep 'em comin'! 2,534 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

Cloudy maroon, rosy orange at the edges. A giant pink head of whipped froth.
Intense aroma. Cotton candy, vanilla, blueberry, funky vinegar. This beer has been aging for a while; the bugs have obviously overtaken the fruit. Not that that's bad -- the funk works.
Tart vinegar slightly offset with blueberry syrup in the front. The swallow delivers a soft flash in tartness, along with lingering barnyard funk. Notes of sweet honey and maple combine at the finish to deposit a lingering blueberry muffin flavor.
Thin, light body, mild carbonation, big fizz. A refreshing drink, light on the palate, works well with the delicate flavor.
Not as world-shattering as I've heard, but a solid sour. Nice flavor integration. 768 charactersPhelps, Jul 12, 2013

Score: 96
2012 vintage bottle served in a GLASS and enjoyed on 05/07/13. Review is from iPhone notes
Appearance: Pours a lovely Byzantium/blueberry color with a thin layer of thistle colored head. The color of the head looks like what you'd expect on the label of a fancy bath product. Average lacing, excellent retention. I adore the color on this brew! 4.5/5
Smell: Sweet and jammy blueberries mixed with that classic "Cantillon dust" aroma you get with all their other beers. Not very sour-apparent on the nose. Hint of vinegar too. Not very complex, but extremely appealing. Maybe I am just a sucker for blueberries? 4.5/5
Taste: Sweet/jammy and slightly acidic blueberries with a nice light tartnesses towards the finish. Some of that "Cantillon dust" flavor throughout as well. Drying tartness, makes for a very interesting mouthfeel. Like the nose, the taste is not very complex, but what it delivers is quite delicious! 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, good carbonation. Sweet fruitiness and mildly acidic. Dry finish. 4.5/5
Overall: I found this brew to be absolutely delicious (albeit not overly complex), but as many have pointed out before me, this is not Cantillon's best beer (let alone their best lambic). I would absolutely love to try this one again, but it us not worth jumping through all the hoops one has to jump through in order to obtain a bottle when Fou Foune, St. Lamvinus, Vigneronne and Lou Pepe Kriek are at least as good, cheaper and easier to obtain. I'd recommend folks who have not had this beer before give it a try, as I found this beer to be world class; however, I would likewise recommend that such folks seek out a bottle with a group of friends so as to share the burden of the premium it'll take to obtain.
Cost: 46€ (approximately $60 USD) for a 750 ML, 23€ (approximately $30 USD) for a 375 ML. 1,922 charactersjegross2, Jul 06, 2013

T: fresh blueberry, funk, slight lemon.
M: this is probably the best part about this beer, nice amount of carb, prickly, medium body. What you expect with a loon.
O: It was nice to try this but it didn't live up to the hype I expected. I'd just as much prefer to drink a Rose, St. Lam, or Fou as I would this. I'll probably try and seek out another batch just to compare. 601 charactersBAstoutsNsours, Jun 29, 2013

Appearance - Deep red, purple body. Nice white head. Collar lasts forever.
Smell - The blueberry flavor comes out a lot, but it's got a green character to it. Nice funk and acidity.
Taste - Also very green. Funky and a nice blueberry flavor. Graininess and sourness. Finishes with a nice fruity flavor blended into a sour bite
Mouthfeel - Spritzy carbonation. Medium to light body.
Overall - I hoped the fruit character would be incredible, but it's very green. Fou'Foune is better, but this is a great lambic. 568 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 15, 2013

300th review.
Vintage 2011. 750ml bottle.
A: Pours a deep reddish purple with a 1" light pink head which fizzles before fading to the rim leaving a few spots of lace.
N: Classic horseblanket funk, chessy, with mild blueberry jam, some vinous notes. Somewhat sour with wood tannins.
T: Fresh blueberry and white grape. Funky with woody mold and mildly sour. Well balanced.
M: Medium body and carbonation. Dry, musty/dusty and fruity finish.
O: Amazing and enjoyed. Maybe overhyped? Try it and decide for yourself. Would have again and again. 627 characterswethorseblanket, May 31, 2013

Pours a purplish red color with a one finger pink head which fades quickly, leaving no lacing. The aroma has tart blueberries, barnyard funk, very acidic.
Tastes like tart blueberries. Acidic, and very dry. There is some barnyard funk in the taste, but not as much as there is in the aroma. The taste becomes a bit sweeter as I drink it, then goes back to being more tart and acidic. Nice and complex. Very well crafted.
Light bodied with low carbonation. Finishes dry. Very inviting and easy to drink. well worth seeking out. 557 charactershardy008, May 09, 2013

The thing that I would like to add the most is that I don't use a lambic basket, sorry. But the last glass of this was up there with Hommage for the dregs making it the best two glasses of beer that I have ever had. 
The blueberries were noticeable; not really a lot of funk, more acidic but with blueberries in the middle. Not dank by any means, but no blueberry beer has achieved that. 
This was great, I really enjoyed it; and it is a treat to try. 
2010 375ml poured into a Crooked Stave snifter. Bottle opener tore the top part of the bottle off. Salvaged the whole bottle, thank God. 
Appearance: Bizzare. Blue/purple hue lambic??? This is something unknown to me. Really excited to see what comes. 
Smell: Light blueberry acid, barnyard Cantillon funk. Great smell; obviously something I have never experienced... and I can't put it in words. 
Taste: Again, can't put it in words. You expect blueberry lambic; but when it hits you it reads as totally something different but within the blueberry lambic world. I can see why this is so sought after. 
Mouthfeel: Jungle of fun with this. Your mouth-to-brain is all over the map with how weird and delightful this is. Incredible. 
Overall: Not the best beer that I have had; but the most beautifully weird beer that I have ever had. I understand the hype. 1,358 charactersgueuzedreg, Apr 20, 2013

375ml bottle; vintage 2012; batch 8.
poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: an opaque medium reddish purple bodied beer with 2 fingers of white head that drops down quickly to a thin cap. 
Smell: fruity and funky sour beer with a touch of vinegar. This beer has a well balanced nose between with the fruit and the funk. Blueberry skins with musty and dusty funk.
Taste: Blueberries that are both sweet and tart. Also some notes of red berries as well. Nice oak barrel presence that is tannic and its earthy too. The funk flavor is both musty basement and wet straw. This beer has a nice sour pucker that is about a 5.5 out of 10. Tastes similiar to a sweetart candy. Finish gets much funkier as it warms...the musty funk really transforms into that horse blanket sweaty funk that Cantillion is know for. A hint of lemon, grapefruit, and berries in the finish as well.
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. The carbonation isnt as aggressive as most Cantillions that I have drank. It has more of a delicate carbonation that comes alive and epperveses as it hits your tongue. I do think that this beer could use just a little more carbonation. Semidry finish.
Overall: Yeah, this beer is wonderful. It is officially my new favorite Cantillion sour. I gotta say that its awesome to finally try this beer that I have been after for a while now. 1,423 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Apr 04, 2013

Pours a dark blue/purple with a small light purple head, decent lacing.
Smell is initially just massive blueberry. As the beer warms, the funk really starts coming through. Get blueberry, tart apple, citrus, wet hay, musty old barn smells, some mushroom. Quite funky.
Taste is like the nose. Blueberry, tart fruit, hay, mustiness, damp mushroom, barn/forest kinds of smells. Lots of funk. Definitely more funk than the 2012 fou foune or framboos, but it doesn't really come through until it warms up. Not quite as sour as framboos, however.
Mouthfeel is very light, with decent carbonation. It's almost a little too light for my taste, though.
This beer is excellent. I feel super lucky to have gotten to try it. Can't wait to get my own bottles. 802 charactersrodkin, Mar 15, 2013

A- Pours a dark purple color with a thin, fizzy pinkish head that quickly settles to a wispy collar.
S- Huge blueberry aroma, the kind of thing you'd expect from a blueberry pie, as well as some tart blueberry juice and skin aromas. There's a big lactic acidity with a touch of vinegar. As it warms a wonderfully complex earthy funkiness emerges, which lends some mustiness, horse blanket smell, and wet oak. It smells delicious.
T- Similar to the aroma, more flavors of blueberry, with a nice blend of sweet and tart blueberry flavors. The tartness is really great, with mostly lactic character but still some acetic. As it warms the funkiness becomes more prominent. The funk has a wet, earthy character with some hints of mushroom. There's also some oak and dry tannins.
M- Medium-bodied, has nice moderate to low carbonation with a very tannic, dry finish.
O- A delicious beer. I wasn't sure what to expect given the hype that surrounds it, but the blueberry character is really amazing and the funkiness of this beer is highly complex, so I think it definitely lived up to its reputation. This is one of the best beers I've had from Cantillon, and certainly one of the best fruited lambics I've ever had. 1,284 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 12, 2013
4.08/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375 mL bottle of the 2012 vintage. Served in a wine glass at Torst.
Blabaer pours a surprisingly dark cherry red, I was expecting it to be a bit lighter. Minimal pink foam tops the beer, and does manage to stick around for a while. The nose is a good blend of an earthy, slightly musty funk, and a slightly tart berry fruitiness. Flavor wise, the beer's not quite as balanced. The brett character isn't as potent, relegated to a bit of damp hay lurking in the background. The blueberry influence is a bit muted as well, just a faint berry flavor is appreciable. In fairness though, blueberry is a pretty subtle fruit in general when it goes into a beer. The acidity is what really stands out, flashy and striking while not being overpoweringly sour. I want to guess that Cantillon uses an older batch of lambic as the base here. The body is nice and light, but I find myself wishing the carbonation had just a little more zip to it. Blabaer is a great beer, and I'm glad I got the chance to try it, but give how much more of a challenge it is to get than some other 'loons, I don't think that I would recommend this one over the others. 1,137 charactersaxeman9182, Mar 12, 2013

4/5  rDev -11.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. 2012 vintage. From notes.
Blåbær has a blue violet hue and is moderately transparent around the edges. There is not much carbonation and barely any head; there is just a small off-white cap. 
The main aroma is blueberries, although the smell is not that strong. There are some tart and funky notes that give it a little more character.
The flavor reminds me more of tart blueberry skin than the whole fruit. It has that kind of hollowed out flavor to it, like there should be a more robust fruit flavor. Because of that, the flavor does not really change that much over the course of the sip and lacks much complexity. The blueberry has just a touch of sweetness to go along with its moderate tartness. There are some funky nots, and a bit of dry, oaky tannins to go along with the tartness.
The body is only somewhat sour and acidic. The lack of sweetness or real punch, combined with the light carbonation, make it feel duller on the palate than it is, with a medium lambic body. There is just a bit of dryness at the end of the sip.
Considering I was dying to try this for a long time, it did not meet my expectations. There are other Cantillon lambics I prefer. 1,214 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 30, 2013

Vintage: 2012
Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
Pours a deep awesome dark purple color with. Very dark. So appealing. There is a nice 1 inch purple/pink head that forms and recedes a quicker pace down to a thin film. So attractive. (5.0)
Aroma starts off with some slight vinegar that is then overwhelmed by awesome fruity tartness. Blueberries, blueberries, blueberries!! Amazing. There is some nice chalky yeast notes that blend in with the deep dark blueberry sweetness. There is then a nice blend of the sweetness with the berry tartness. (5.0)
Starts off with some nice wild yeast tartness and good fruity sour hints as well. There is some good barrel note with the brew that blends so well with the fruit tartness. The middle of the brew showcases more of the sweetness but with still that wild yeasty funk and some good dry tartness. There is such a great balance in this brew between the woody oak, the fruit, be it tart or sweet, and the awesome wild yeast funk notes. Body is very crisp and with a dry finish. Tartness is good but not overwhelming. Great brew. (4.5)(4.5)
I’m pretty lucky to try this brew. There is such a great balance of the main Lambic qualities and flavors; from the fruit notes to the oak and tartness. Amazing. (5.0) 1,294 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 01, 2013

Served chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
2012 Vintage. 
I never thought I would actually get to try the elusive Blåbær, so a big thanks to JAXSON for hooking me up with the bottle. 
Appearance: Blåbær pours a beautiful deep red/pink, with a back light even revealing some hints of purple. A rough pour yields a large pink tinted head that lasts quite well for a sour, but doesn't leave any lacing. 
Smell: After my initial sniff (which was almost all funk), I was a little worried that the blueberry character was going to be obscured behind Cantillon's signature funk, but thankfully as the nose began to open up, it struck a perfect balance between juicy blueberries and funk. Notes include: Fresh juicy blueberries, berry skins, a very faint berry jam note, a vinous character, some acidic lemon notes, old wood, sweaty socks, some old cheese, musty basement and a touch of leather. 
Taste: The flavour doesn't offer quite as much berry character as the nose, but the funk that replaces it is top notch. Notes include: Tart berries (a faint hint of sweetness), berry skins, a vinous note, tart lemon, some green apple peel, musty basement, old wood, sweaty socks, old hay and a hint of cheese. Interestingly there is a big blast of blueberry flavour on the burp. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with the faintest hint of stickiness (I love the effect the addition of fruit makes to the body of a lambic) and a medium-high level of carbonation. The beer is quite tart (not as tart as one would expect from Cantillon though) and very dry. 
Overall: Blåbær is a fantastic fruit lambic, however I am not sure it is any better than Rose de Gambrinus and probably rides on its rarity to some extent. Still if I lived in Denmark, I would certainly get my limit of bottles every year! 1,814 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 27, 2012

My ridiculously priced Christmas gift to myself...when in Rome...
This beer pours a gorgeous purple/blue-ish red with a finger of purple-tinged head. Lacing sticks nicely all the way down the glass. On the nose, upon first opening, it is musty with subdued blueberry notes. The classic barnyard smells are present in droves - leather, dirty horse blanket and some manure. The blueberry notes begin to take over the nose the longer it is open and it forms a nice harmony with the musty, barnyard notes. 
In terms of taste, it is very similar to the nose. Upfront it is all must, leather and other brettanomyces induced flavors. In the mid-palate blueberries come through but are quite subdued at first. After being open for about 15 minutes though, the blueberries come to life and take center stage. The blueberry is intense but not too sweet and very vibrant. These juicy blueberry flavors provide an excellent balance to the musty-ness. The blueberries are followed by the typical Cantillon mouth-puckering tartness however beneath this the blueberries are still present. It finishes dry with a sweet undercurrent of the juicy blueberries. 
A amazing lambic! It is very typical Cantillon but much, much more vibrant. It is a drop-dead gorgeous beer. The taste is quite similar in beauty with its harmony between dry earth and must, and sweet blueberry. It's exceptionally balanced and it takes your palate on quite a ride. It's an unmissable beer that is undoubtedly my favorite lambic. 1,560 charactersTallSaint, Dec 26, 2012

Pours a brilliant purpley blue color with a cloudy haze. Crop of white head rests on top, fading into a collar of filmy residue with spotty lacing on the glass. 
Juicy blueberries in the nose with funky sourness. Soft acidity and faint sweetness, straw and wet hay. Still fruit-forward yet tart despite the year+ of age. 
Blueberry-driven tartness with plenty of jammy fruit tones. The sourness builds on the palate while drinking, yielding a funky yeast and wet hay. Straw and biscuit malts with grain and more blueberries. Tart fruit skins and oak with a soft vinous character. Finishes tart and dry on the tongue. 
Lighter medium body, well carbonated, bubbly and lively on the tongue. One of the best fruit lambics I've ever had, although I believe Fou Foune is still my favorite. 855 charactersxnicknj, Dec 26, 2012

Not being a dedicated whale-hunter, I figured I wouldn't get to sample this, & oh well, but hey! Look! It's here! 375ML bottle with a blue label & no apparent year - the cork has 2010 printed on it. Pulled out to celebrate my wife's &lt;number censored&gt; birthday. 
Pop the cork out & can't resist a whiff, & it's good. The pour is purlishreddishbluish with plenty of emotion in the head. Nose is like nothing I've sensed: plenty of blueberry, but bone-dry, almost leathery. No sour overdrive. Me likes. 
Blåbær Lambik drinks like I think a sour should: sour plus something else. Lovely tartness up front, of course, but not tearing the enamel off the sink twenty feet away, & the blueberries add to it nicely. The berries aren't the sweet berry you'd pick off a bush in the wilderness (sigh, I'd like to do that, but it's winter), but dry, dusty, unripe berries. Bit of vinegar mid-bite. Dry, dry, dry. I am sucking this down. It's like a pleasantly harshed up version of my favorite fruit juice. 
Now I've had it & this - this is what lambics/wilds should be like, the sour & tartness playing off other aspects of the beer rather than being an exercise in facial contortions. Mind-blowing? No. Excellent? Certainly. Very glad to try it. 1,330 charactersmaximum12, Dec 09, 2012

37.5cl bottle poured into Loon flute
Vintage: 2012
Poured after letting this sit out for about 30 minutes, but the flavours were still muted together so let it warm to about 55°F before actually enjoying and reviewing.
A: Deep burgundy in color with slight tint of purplish ruby. Single (off-white) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Mostly lambic funk here with notes of must, aged cheese, soft citrus, and very hidden blueberry notes.
T: Like the nose, the blueberry flavor is quite muffled here. Disappointing considering fruit lambics are usually most enjoyable relatively fresh. I'm curious to know how this drinks compared to other vintages of this beer. The base lambic quality here is very enjoyable and smooth though - must, funk, and rounded - just wish the blueberry was a bit more pronounced.
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Very enjoyable here!
O: A quality beer for sure, but this didn't live up to the "hype" for me. I'm looking forward to trying another vintage of this to see how it compares. 1,036 charactersspdyfire83, Dec 03, 2012

Gotta say, I sure as hell didn't expect this guy to drop in my lap the way it did. My thanks go out to whomever it was that shared the bottle with me. It pours a clear deep indigo topped by a finger or so of light purple-ish foam. The nose comprises funky blueberries, light tobacco, and plenty of farmhouse-style funk. A hint of vinegar seeps in the back door. The taste brings in more of the same, with that vinegar coming in stronger, though not strongly enough to properly usurp. The tartness is a lot lower than I expected, though there's definitely some tannic qualities to be found. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly sticky finish. Overall, while this was a generally enjoyable beer, it came nowhere near to living up to the hype surrounding it. I can't for the life of me fathom why so many would stop at so little to obtain what I thought to be something just pretty good. To each their own, I suppose... 993 charactersTMoney2591, Oct 16, 2012

Pours a deep purplish, crimson color with a light pink head of about a finger. Head sticks around for a bit, then dies down to a light foaming around the edges of the glass.
Big horsey funk and mild blueberry jam on the nose. Some vinous notes, plenty of sour and a touch of oak tannin. Much funkier than I expected.
Huge vinous notes with a bit of blueberry. Lots of funk on the tongue as well, and plenty of barrel and sour notes. Not a super balanced taste, gives way to much more funk than fruit in my opinion.
Spritzy and medium body with a very dry finish. Spot on for a lambic.
Good funk with a mild blueberry presence among oak and vinous notes. Overall, I would say this does not live up to the hype. Is it an outstanding beer? Of course. But don't trade away the farm. Try it if you have the opportunity but don't lose sleep over it. 884 charactersauroracrisis, Sep 15, 2012

A- The most beautiful ruby purplish color. Pours with a nice light bubbly purple head as well. It is little murky looking. Exactly what you'd expect from blueberry juice.
S- I get some blueberry, vinous notes, and plenty of sour funk. Very typically of most cantillon beers I've had in the past. Very well balanced between the funk/fruit/sourness.
T- A heavy acidity immediately sweeps through my mouth, very tart and vinegary. Follows up with with tastes of blueberry skins, and hints of funk. The aftertase lingers for a while, and really holds a lot of blueberry flavor. Extremely well balanced flavor for a sour. 
M- Pretty much perfect. Good carbonation, body, and profile. It is very complex and transitional, while not overpowering the palate. Just the right amount of funk and sourness.
O- Overall the balance of this beer is really what amazes me. To some degree I expected a bit more blueberry flavor, but this was very pleasant and tasty. The blueberry came out more as it warmed up a bit, and it really became pleasant. One of my favorite Cantillons to date, if not my favorite.

s - blueberry. red wind. i just can't stop smelling it. dry. blueberry jam. some creaminess.
t - some blueberry on the taste. very red wine and extremely smooth and creamy...the creaminess actually gives it a bit of a white wine characteristic so kind of like red wine crossed with white wine and blueberries tossed in the mix.
m - prickly carbonated feel. pretty dry, but soft and creamy. just a hint of sourness...really easy to drink.
o - overally, what a great lambic. perhaps a great gateway sour as it isn't really sour at all, but rather fruity. not overly sweet. just right. really really solid. i can't decide if it lives up to the hype as the hype is so intense on this beer, but what a hell of a beer. 984 characterscosmicevan, Aug 31, 2012

A-No head on the pour, but it is a beautiful deep purple red in color. It is slightly hazy in clarity, it looks stunning. 
S-For being a year old at this point, there is still quite a bit of blueberry in the nose, much more than I remember when I originally tried this last year. Plump blueberries and some yogurt character. 
T-Blueberry is a little more subdued in the flavor, but is still quite present. There is also lemon rind, oak, and a generous amount of funk. 
M-Light mouthfeel, good acidity, lower carbonation, and a moderate lingering finish.
O-One of the better fruit lambics Cantillon makes, but in term of fruit lambics I think I still prefer Fou Foune, Saint Lamnivus, and Lou Pepe Kriek. 
Note: I had a 2012 vintage the following day and found the blueberry to be much more faint in the '12. I assume that the recipe is pretty consistent batch to batch, so I found it peculiar that I found the blueberry to be more prominent in the older batch than the new one. 1,071 charactersTnudish, Aug 27, 2012

Review # 444. Huge thanks to Steasy66 for sharing this beer. I am glad that I know the right people!
Deep pink-purple hued with a light purple head. Good head and good retention. Very clean aroma with no vinegar whatsoever, an instant hit in my book. Somewhat sweet with tart and bright berry notes and only mild hints of funk.
Taste is a clean, lactic and mild sour with strong berry notes. Very very blueberry. I was pleasantly surprised that my "robust" palate could detect the blueberries, they must have used a lot!
Medium body, medium carbonation and a clean finish. Very very good.

A: purplish red in color. Moderately cloudy. Forms a thin but very stable bluish purple head that sticks around for the entire glass. No lacing, but none expected. 
S: aroma is primarily blueberries, but "dry" blueberries if that makes any sense. Sort of like blueberry leather. Then there is a slightly acetic note with a bit of dusty basement in the mix. 
T: flavor is tart, slightly vinegary, but not overly so. Again there are blueberries, but they taste like the tart, unripe, not yet sweet and juicy blueberries you usually tossin the sink and don't actually eat. There is a bit of mustiness on the finish that sticks around for bit 
M: medium bodied, tart, with good carbonation. There is a surprising bitterness that accompanies this beer, bu it doesn't distract from it.

Pours a fantastic reddish purple color, hints of pink and burgundy with a nice fizzy pinkish white head that is very lively but recedes quickly, no lacing or head retention to speak of. The color though is gorgeous. The aroma is amazing, huge blueberry notes leap out of the glass, nice amount of yeast and funk, but nothing too cheesy or vinegary either, perfectly balanced. Mild amounts of wood find its way out as well. The flavors are just about perfect, lots of fresh blueberries, acetic acid, oak and funk. The balance is perfect, such a jammy, yet juicy flavor, this could be a pie filling or muffin filling. The body is perfect, while it has the acidity of most lambics and sours, this one is so soft and smooth on the tongue. 
Verdict: This is fantastic and warrants the hype. This is definitely a celebration of fresh and natural blueberry. 925 characterskevanb, Jul 29, 2012

Look: Pours a bluish/purple color with a reddish ring around the top of the glass. 1/4 inch pinkish bubbly head the resides down to a small ring and leaves behind some spotty lace
Smell: Lots of freshly picked blueberries some some under arm funk that make me think this must be what the guy smelled like when he picked the blueberries and some oak
Taste: This for me is where I lost interest in the beer. The beer starts out with some blueberry flavor and to me it taste like a cheap blueberry syrup then is followed up by this weird plastic off putting flavor. Some very light tart and funk and oak cleans up the backend of the beer
Mouthfeel: Thinner body mild to medium carbonation and just a bit tingly
Overall: Extremely happy that I got a chance to try this beer and even more happy that I never traded for one. So far of all the Cantillons I have had this one was the biggest disappoint.

3.92/5  rDev -13.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Bottle pour at Woodshop 7 held at Beachwood BBQ & Brewing in Long Beach, CA.
Pours a slightly murky dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some blueberry and other berry aromas along with a distinct plastic-like smell in the mix. Taste is much the same with the plastic quality coming through on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer as it stands but the plastic quality in the aroma and taste is not something too desirable in my opinion. 665 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jul 24, 2012

Appearance: Pours a cloudy purple color with some red and pink where the light hits the glass. There is a finger of pink head that fades to a layer on top of the pour.
Smell: Distinct lambic tartness and funk. Mildly sweet with some aged hops in the background. The blueberries are there, but they show up under the tart notes.
Taste: Sweet and tart. Definitely getting some funk and citrus like acidity. Blueberry flavor shows up but the beer isn't sweet. The finish is sour with a touch of hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with foamy, tingly carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: This is a great fruit lambic, but I don't know that it's that much better than the Kriek or the Rose. I would have this again, but not at the current price. 916 charactersoline73, May 17, 2012
4.37/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5*** Update after opening an '09 in Oct 2012. Been fortunate enough to try both the 2011 (b7) and 2009 (b4, I think) vintages recently. Both shared a gorgeous appearance unique to the style yet were wildly different from each other in every other regard.
The '11 emitted an exceptionally pungent aroma of fresh, juicy blueberries that would make most muffin aficionados jealous. It's on the *very* short list of aromas that would get a 10/10 from me. Taste was rather mild and boring, though. Almost watery with barely any funk or tartness.
The '09 was exactly its opposite: nose lacked depth and pungency while the taste showed matured fruits, funk, classic Cantillon acidity, and an overall level of refinement that simply isn't in the fresher bottle.
Blabaer is the perfect example of the "&lt;girl 1&gt;'s face on &lt;girl 2&gt;'s body" dilemma in beer.
*** Original review of the 2011: ***
375ml bottle split 3 ways, thanks to my new Swedish buddy! 2011 vintage.
I started trading beer specifically to acquire a bottle of Blabaer for my brother's 30th birthday last year, and although that mission was unsuccessful, it's heightened my anticipation of trying this lambic tremendously. Being the good brother I am, I saved a small pour of this for my brother (using a wine stopper) and presented it to him the next evening. Anyway, on with the review!
Deep, dark blueish/red color; almost purple. Let's make my 5th grade science teacher happy and call it indigo. Head is a similar color, and there's plenty of it.
A luscious aroma of freshly picked blueberries and wild yeast fills my nostrils. Smells like the juice from squeezing a ripe blueberry between your fingers, yet it also somehow reminds me of opening the can of tiny berries inside a box of Sarah Lee muffin mix. All I know is this smells incredible!
...but unfortunately the taste isn't on the same level. Blabaer is plenty acidic, yet only mildly sour. Most of the flavors are here, though it could use more funk and overall sourness. More depth and boldness of flavor would do wonders. Finishes a little watery. It did improve as it approached room temperature, but it wasn't served particularly cold in the first place. All three of us were equally disappointed with the taste. :(
Much like the Kate we opened immediately prior to this, Blabaer seems to suffer from hype syndrome. That said, this is still a very good lambic, and I'd love to try an older vintage.
...But honestly, I'm pretty sure I prefer Fou'Foune. 2,495 charactersbrystmar, May 05, 2012

4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52011 vintage, 750 mL split two ways.
Pours a dark red, fuchsia color with a pinkish foam that settles to a thick ring. Beautiful color, when held to the light, hints of blue and purple.
The blueberry was incredibly prominent. Typical Cantillon funk, wet oak, basement blueberry skins, and graham cracker sweetness.
The taste is very similar to the aroma, but I get blueberry skins more on the finish. Not overly sour, but a great balance and blend of sweet, sour, tart and funk complexity.
Mouthfeel is very creamy, almost milky, with a very dry finish. It has a thicker body than I'm used to, but it works well here. Very drinkable.
Overall, this is incredible and met the hype for me. Really complex and unlike anything I'd normally drink, in a good way. A quite intriguing beer - I look forward to trying my other vintages. 831 charactersislandboi8204, Apr 25, 2012

Aroma: similar to st lamvinus, blueberry, fresh not squeezed, musk with hints of barnyard and cellar, some fertilizer.  Definitely smells of fresh not so sweet blueberrys. Very little vinegar
Taste:  wow straight up blueberrys, vinegar, sour, acidic. The funk is somewhat there with a little oak
Mouthfeel:  tighter carbonation than some. The mouthfeel is medium to light.  Dry finish probably due to the acidity.
Overall: Even though this is the best Cantillon it really does not justify how saught after this beer is. Do not get me wrong, I think this beer is the best Cantillon I have tried but do not be led astray by believeing that it is soooo much better than anything else. 866 charactersscoand, Apr 09, 2012

Pours a hazy, pomegranate hue with a loose, white head that dissipates into a skim and a frothy band. Nose expresses berry fruit, citric acid and a hint of something chemical. Taste follows nose with the addition of a briney character that comes out towards the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with an assertive carbonation and acidity that lingers between quaffs. Overall, this is an excellent fruit lambic; however, the blueberry flavor is definitely dropping off. Nonetheless, I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have tried this beer. 614 charactersJwale73, Apr 01, 2012
4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5How lucky can one guy be? With all the talk of hunting white whales, sometimes you just need to return to the same place and eventually one will swim up on its own. One did, but I must give the credit to Danny, whom now I'm deeply indebted to. We have here a 2009 vintage coming from the 375 ml format. Ok...deep breath....on to the beer:
Looks like rosé in a glass. Ok, rosé with a tone of violet. Little of a head is produces, though it does throw a few spots of lace on the glass. But the appearance is not what makes Blåbær famous, right? For starters, check out the nose! It's outstanding. It does have a tart fruit nose, but it doesn't seem like blueberry, the fruit used to make this lambic. Sour and blanket add the missing components of a perfect nose. 
Blåbær may be the least sour/tart of the Cantillon's I've had to date. Make no mistake, it is relatively tart, and fun to taste under any circumstances. Here, it does seem that there is a little blueberry presence. But more so, it seems more dominant of currents. Tart, but not the palate numbing type. Perhaps that's why this beer is so revered. The beer is soft on the palate, not as puckering as the label will make you believe, and is stimulating.
Call it delicious, and end it at that. I'll let the rest of the community dictate its delightfulness. 1,325 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 22, 2012
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5How awesome was this, the beer had bits of blue, red, purple to it. I think a light pink/purple is the best way to describe it, totally nuts, like that magic ghost from fantome, just a color that grabs your attention. I was psyched to try it, thinking it would be either golden or blueish or something in between. And it actually formed a small head on it, better than most lambics, if not all frankly. But the thickness of the blueberry in here, just wow.
Aroma, really delivered on the fruit and the sourness, Cantillon really got the hang of that. Blueberry though, wow, thats a treat, I've had a few blueberry beers, the aroma and taste of blueberry really ranged from fake/awful to decent/ok in my limited experience. This was flat out excellent. The mild funk is accompanied by sweetness.
The taste, such a thick blueberry presence, way heavier viscosity than I expected. Perfect blend of sour, tart and that mild blueberry sweet. So delicious and easy to drink, love the sourness. It gives me everything I want, massive fruit flavor (doesn't hurt when blueberries have to be my favorite fruit) perfect sourness, perfect tartness. 
If I ever go back to Europe, I think I'm planning my trip around the release of this beer. Damn. So good, mad props for jh1982 opening this the morning of um. I dunno, was it Friday's games at March Madness? 1,348 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Mar 21, 2012

A- Purple body with a nice pink head.

It poured out looking, well, almost exactly like fresh raspberry juice - a mellow and thin red with delicate lacing. It's really quite beautiful. Aromas of saddle leather, field grasses, very ripe strawberry and blueberry.
It packs a bit of a sour punch, almost like a sourpatch kid or strawberry jolly rancher, but with a fresh blueberry/strawberry quality and a background of the grass and leather from the aroma. The taste is very clean, and the fruit is right up front as the star of the show. The mouthfeel is much as the appearance - akin to fresh raspberry juice; it is just the right balance of alcohol, sugars, and clean juice to keep the body in check from becoming too heavy or too thin. Absolutely wonderful lambik. 835 charactersfvernon, Feb 05, 2012

The colour is blueberry-purple, the liquid clear. The low head is pink.

The carbonation is light, the small bubbles fresh. The liquid is very dry. 
A very well balanced and highly drinkable lambic. One of the most intriguing beers I have had. 607 charactersbark, Jan 26, 2012

Pours a beautiful cranberry rose color, with a ½ finger of rich pink (maybe even a bit purplish) head. This retains with a creamy and frothy look, soaping the sides of the glass with thick swathes of heavy lace. Awesome look to this! Fresh raspberries are right up front of the aroma with a tart blast of flavor. Funk and acidic tones shore up the middle of this, while I’m getting some doughy sugars sprinkled throughout as well. The fruity tartness of this picks up in the back of the nose, leaving a favorable final impression. This has a nice compact feel in the nostrils but seems like it could have been a little more robust smelling. 
The taste is similar, with a bright and flavorful berry tartness that is emboldened by the acidity and funk. Some very light feeling sugars spread out and mostly hang with that berry flavor. Earth and woody notes are really sticking out to me in this. There is a real nice dry crispness here that gives this a lovely parching feel. Like most Cantillions, this is sour but the overall balance is so well done, that it comes off more as an intense yet refreshing tartness. Really nicely done. The mouthfeel is medium bodied; with a lively and effervescent feel that pops that fruitiness, while there is just of bit of a chewiness underneath which mostly holds that acidity and funky character. The feel here perfectly complements these flavors. 
This was good. Not mind blowing but pretty darn good. While this was certainly well crafted, it just lacked that wow factor to it that would have really put this over the top for me. It seems that rarity of this elevates it a bit. Thanks for the opportunity at trying this though Adam. It was most appreciated. 1,877 charactersKegatron, Jan 11, 2012

Pours reddish purple with a finger of pink head with lacing down the glass.
Aroma is straight fruit tartness. Lots of unripe blueberry and cherry scents with some oak and typical Cantillon funkiness.
Starts out with a little tart cherry flavor. Deep funk, straw and lots of sour acidity coat the tongue and it finishes with a tart blueberry flavor. Almost like eating a not quite ripe blueberry straight from the bush.
Smooth mouthfeel with high prickly carbonation.
An excellent beer. It is supremely sour with lots of tart fruit characters. Immensely enjoyable, but not the best beer (and maybe not the best Cantillon) I've ever had. 685 charactersjmarsh123, Jan 02, 2012

A Blueberry with a hind of head. Rather bubbly. Red hue down the bottom. Some sediment floating around (blueberry bits!). Little lacing. Nice purple/white head. Almost looks like blackberry.
S Blueberry and sour. On the sweet side though. Very nice. There’s the typical Cantillon funk as well. I must say, the sound of the bubble popping is very nice to listen to!
•	T Blueberry (obviously). Tart/sour. Not much else there though. There’s the typical Cantilon funk taste, though I noticed that it was not as sour as their other beers…but it did become a little bit more sour as it opened up. But never near the intensity I expected. A little too one-dimensional I think, but still good. 
M Medium carb. Very good. Aftertaste of blueberry builds. 
O An excellent beer. But maybe the hype is a little too much? Don’t get me wrong, this is an excellent example of a sour beer, but I just don’t think it is in the top 10 beers in the world. A great beer, but it didn't blow me away. I would rate other Cantillons higher than this one. Also note that there was some sediment at the end, which was a good surprise, you could definitely see the tiny remnants of the blueberries that went into this beer. 1,235 charactersgulden, Dec 08, 2011

deep cherry and fresh blueberry with hints of sour lemon and dry oak.
up front, there was almost a bright cherry aspect going on. through the back end and the finish this ripe fresh blueberry just lingered and stuck to the tongue for plenty of wonderful aftertaste. nice light oak and sourness through out to really carry this. lots of depth in this.

750ml bottle, '11 inscribed on the bottom of the label with silver marker. Split with Slatetank and Kegatron during a recent wild ale tasting. Poured into a matching Cantillon long stemmed tulip, this brew appears a deep purple color. A pink frothy head sits atop the brew and gets revived to a full finger's strength when lightly swirled. When held to the light, ruby coloration shows through the body and despite a careful pour, some tiny spots of what looks like blueberry skin rests on the bottom of the glass.
The smell of this brew is primarily funky with notes of plastic while it is chilled. Some indications of cheese and earthy fruit start to evolve as the brew warms up. It also has a mild almost medicinal touch about it. When the glass is swirled, only then do berry tinges come out and blend through the aroma. Once warm, this brew picks up a sort of damp woodsy character from the barrel aging. While not the most fragrant, bright or upfront fruit scent to a beer, it is well rounded and enjoyable.
The taste is funky primarily with plastic notes upfront. I won't sugar-coat my first impression; it is slightly disappointing considering the unrealistic aura surrounding this brew. As it warms up, it turns earthy and pitted with a light medicinal touch. The berry inclusion here gets increasingly earthy with a wet and almost moldy wood feel to it. There is a spice of alcohol that comes out across the back as the brew warms up. It is tart and rich in berry flavor once warm which is pleasant considering the initial let down.
This is a light bodied brew with a perfect amount of modest carbonation. It is lively enough in the mouth but not overdone and distracting. There is a solid mix of flavor/character to take in with lots of earthy tones. However, the initial impact of plastic and light nail polish remover was quite unwelcomed and didn't blend well with the rest of the brew. This offering was somewhat dry on the tongue which increased its overall salivation factor and ease of drink ability. It carries with it almost a cooling aspect about it in the back of the throat. 
After the fact consideration: While glancing over other reviews, I don't see mention of some of the unpleasant character I picked up on in this. It makes me wonder just how variable some bottles can be. This is something I wouldn't mind trying again but it most certainly is not worth the price of admission. It is not the best fruit lambic I have had, it's not even the best Cantillon offering available. The sheer amount of blueberries that had to be packed in this to discolor the brew to the deep purple it is, is amazing. Unfortunately, that excitement/impression doesn't easily transpire to the same degree in either the flavor or aroma. 2,873 charactersstakem, Nov 15, 2011

4.82/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was waiting for some time for the chance to try this and was glad I got the opportunity. Enjoyed from the 750ml into a cantillon tulip. 
A reddish purple hue with thick pink band after settling. The bead is of various sizes with lace that sticks pretty well. The clarity of this beer is on the translucent side. The smell is great, the funk is huge in this with big berry fruity aroma and mild phenolic accent which is slightly medicinal at first but seems to mellow allowing the dark berry odors to take over with a slight floral and woody note. There is a mild tart berry skin hint with a nice amount of oak and light herbal tinges. The feel has a tannic and juicy astringent acidity up front which makes way for some slight sweet fruit flesh tinges and the sour yeast which has a clean lactic sour quality and still adds a mild spice effect with the moderately high carbonation.
A blueberry taste is apparent with big fruity tart taste and bit phenolic flavor that carries over where the aroma leaves off. There is a lactic type of flavor with mild acidic puckering quality. The taste has a gentle woody tinge with mild bitter aspect in the background. The taste has more of an earthy accent as it warms with the funk flavor coming out to meet the fruit and sour taste with the tart pie-like berry blueberry tart tatste. Overall I was overjoyed with the experience. I find this to be a great fruit beer with a nice sourness from the wild yeast without becoming too overwhelming...the perfect blend practically of berry and wild yeast. I really enjoyed this and there is very little to find fault with -Kudos Cantillon! 1,625 charactersSlatetank, Nov 13, 2011

A: Deep red, opaque, light head with moderate lacing. Little bits of seed (?) are visible when held up to light.
S: Funky, fruity. Can't say the blueberrys are distinctive here, but I'm amazing at the level of fruitiness in the scent as this bottle is pushing 5 years old.
T: That fruitiness starts it off and quickly fades into an incredibly puckering sour. Fruit seems to linger in the aftertaste. This beer is truly incredible.
M: Light body, reasonably sticky. Carbonation is a little more subtle than other Cantillons I've had in the past.
O: This beer is absolutely awesome. I now have to seek out a fresher bottle to see what this is like fresh! 734 charactersmrand01, Nov 12, 2011

Thanks for sharing this, cbanker!
Murky purple and dark blue in color with a thin head--nice dotted lacing left down the glass. Unique and gorgeous!
The aroma is a nice combination of barnyard mustiness, hay, and lots of plump, juicy blueberries, currant, and cherry, interestingly enough.
Surprised by the flavor, the yeast and funk lead the way and steal the show here. It's incredibly sour, mouth-puckeringly so, and while there' a good amount of fruit character, I'm not sure I would be able to say it was blueberry without knowing otherwise. 
Low to medium bodied with high carbonation.
So glad I got to finally try this, but, I believe there are much better Cantillons. 695 charactersehammond1, Nov 06, 2011

Pours a crazy bluish purple color. Perfect head retention and good lacing. Very nice looking beer.
Smells like a huge amount of sour mix, blueberries and acai berries. Very fruit forward and you can tell this is funky and sour.
Tastes mouth puckeringly sour. See the guy on the bottle? That's pretty much the face you're going to make. Since this was a fresh vintage all of that wonderful fruit is still very strong. Funk, berries, sour, a bit of sweetness and a lot of delicious.
High carbonation and a touch thin. Doesn't detract from the amazing taste, though.
Overall I'm glad I tried this one, it's great. However, between fou'foune and blabaer, I would definitely take fou. 754 charactersdmsohyea, Nov 05, 2011

Appearance – Pours into a Cantillon tulip with an utter amazing dark blue/purple color. About a half finger of purple head that dissipates at an average pace leaving slight nifty looking lacing. Side note, as I drank this there were bits of berry that got stuck on the glass…awesome.
Smell – Lots of fruit; quite obviously blueberry. A wonderful tart and barnyard funk aroma. Leather, lemon peel, and more blueberry.
Taste – A nice puckering up front with loads of berry flavor. A slight barnyard funk flavor such as wet hay and leather. A hint of acidic characteristic, lemon zest, oak, and tannic qualities.
Mouthfeel – Lighter medium bodied, plentiful carbonation, finishes a hint dry and acidic.
Overall – I was thoroughly impressed with this beer. It was everything I was hoping and expecting it to be. To be honest, I recently went international to get a 33cl of the 2011. That said, I will admit this beer was not insanely better than other Cantillon’s I have had. While it is different with the variation of berries, the 2003 Lou Pepe Framboise I had recently was more mouth puckering and sour. Since I have had this beer fresh, I will now age the bottle I own. Still, a fantastic beer. 1,336 charactersSpdKilz, Oct 20, 2011

This was the first time having this beer and Im glad it was a fresh, because I’ve had some aged Cantillons, which were awesome, but the fruit taste was pretty much gone. It was hard to drink this beer. First off, the blueberry and sourness in the nose was so great that I just kept smelling the beer. I was fearful that I would drink it in one shot because the smell was that good. The taste was even better. Blueberries were present but not overpowering. The tartness added some great puckering and made each sip better and better. I never pass on Cantillon and its because of beers like this one. 654 charactersbiggsbowler, Oct 07, 2011

Not as "pungent" as previous batches. Seems
A little more "watered down." don't get me wrong, there are berries and funk, but not as much oak or depth of flavor as I remember with previous batches. This was a 375 and I will re-rate a 750 batch 7 sometime in future to see if more complexity develops. Slighty underwhelmed this go around. 365 charactersbulldogp04, Sep 26, 2011

Pours a wine like violet color with a decent head.
The aroma is killer, blueberries and ripe fruit.
Unfortunately the taste couldn't live up to the nose, few do...nice rounded tartness with a hint of funk. Obviously a solid blueberry note throughout and a nice lingering juiciness...a little puckering I suppose.
It was great, but not nearly as epic as it's made out to be. If I end up in Copenhagen anytime soon, I will certailnly seek out a few bottles to add to the cellar. Regardless, it's another one I can happily check off the list and am happy to have tried it.
Thanks Boss! 711 characterspixieskid, Sep 18, 2011

Pours a cloudy pink with a nice head. Great aroma of barnyard funk and blueberries. Aroma fills the glass with straw and a sour citrus that makes you want to smell it as much as drink it. Creamy mouthfeel with a balance of sweet and sour fruit and a complex mixture of blueberries, funk, apricots and lemon zest. Nicely balanced. Finish is dry and lingers on the tongue. Very nice stuff. 505 charactersDoodler, Sep 08, 2011

Served a bit too cold, but hey, it’s January in Michigan. Poured a blueberry pulp red with lots of purple and a nice frothy white head. Immediate smell is vinegar even after just uncapping! The nose definitely foreshadowed the taste as it packs a powerful acidic kick in the mouth. Bit of sparkling fruit soda mid-taste & on the palate, but very enjoyable. Tastes very similar to Cantillon Kriek and it’s hard to get much blueberry out of the beer until sampling the last 4 ounces of dregs/sediment. The surprising acidity of the beer (for a 2009) burns lightly on the finish. Extremely drinkable. 8/4/8/5/17
 Re-rate for 2009 (batch 4) 750ml: Shared by Dan at Derek’s first visit back tasting in April. Pours a vibrant purple with a pinkish head. Smell is a bit of funk, sweet blueberries, and vanilla. Taste is sour, funky, but accompanied by acidic blueberry skin with a dry finish. Woah, this was a very different beer compared to the batch 5 375ml I opened up some short time before. Way more blueberry fruit on the nose and taste which made all the difference in balancing the beer out. 9/4/9/5/20 1,175 characterssarro, Aug 23, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From notes 8/5/11. Huge thank you to Dobby for this one. 2011, Batch 7, 750 ml. Pours a deep maroon and cloudy with a thin layer of bubbles. Aroma is very good. Lots of blueberries, earth, barnyard and mild cheese notes. The berries don’t seem terribly juicy, but it’s wonderfully restrained and complex. The taste is dry with a tannic, blueberry skin quality. I’m guessing that my review would be very high for an older bottle because this one just doesn’t seem to have the tartness of other Cantillon and 3F fruit lambics, and more sour berry flavor would put this over the top. Still, it’s pretty great, as is. Mouthfeel is fairly normal for the style - light, not too bubbly. Good stuff. 701 characterspopery, Aug 15, 2011

A: Pours an absolutely gorgeous deep purple color with reddish purple hues when held in the light. Beer is topped with a thin purple-pink head that floats on top of the beer from beginning to end.
S: Beautiful aroma full of tartness, funk, oak, berries and some citrus notes as well.
T: Nice and tart, moderately acidic with a fair amount of barnyard funk that goes quite well with the oak and berry flavors. Leaves a lingering tartness and taste of berries after each sip. I have never had a true bilberry before but the berry character of the beer is similar to what I would expect from blueberries. 
M: Nice light and crisp body on the lighter side with moderate carbonation, finishes nice and dry.
O: One of the better examples of lambic that I have tried, great balance of tartness and flavor. Too bad that its as limited and sought after as it is because I would love to drink this more often than is realistic. 1,003 charactersAzurescens, Aug 15, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Funny that the description on BA says “blueberry lambic” while Blabaer is Danish for Bilberry, a quite different berry with a significantly different taste. But let’s stop the language course of the review and focus on the beer :) 2010 vintage
Look: The beer pours a deep blue-purple color with a nice light purple-pink head, wow!
Smell: Funky, light oak and fruity with lemon and Bilberries, less vinegar (lactic tartness) than the average Cantillon beer. 
Taste: Full of funk flavours, tart berries and other sour fruits (apple, lemon). The barrel (oak) is more present in the taste than in the smell. The finish is dry and tart with even more Bilberries appearing. 
Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Overall: What a great beer, looking forward to traveling to Copenhagen and pick up the 2011 version 826 charactersrvdoorn, Aug 12, 2011

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I actually got this myself! I didn't just sit on my ass and trade for it. I actually went out and acquired it in Copenhagen. Boy, imagine that. 
The July 2011 release 33cl bottle (with a classic metal pressure cap over top an embedded cork) was poured into a Westvleteren goblet in Stockholm Sweden, on July 14th, 2011. Served at a mildly cold temperature from the refrigerator. Reviewed live. 
A: Half a finger of purple (not blue!), creamy head with wonderful thickness and poor retention (especially for the ABV). Retention is maybe forty seconds. Colour is a unique solid purple-black. Nontransparent. I expected a transparent moderately dark blue, but this surprised me. Extremely appealing and unique. 
Sm: Blueberry (all in my head because I know it's blueberry?), raspberry, cherry, and strawberry. I expected only blueberry, and may be projecting my expectations. I try not to, but I do legitimately get blueberry from the scent - it's just not as strong as expected. Certainly souring hops are present - typical for the lambic style. I'd describe the strength of the scent as mild to moderate overall. It certainly isn't overpowering, but it is pleasant without a doubt. I'm excited to try it. 
T: Sour blueberry body. Slight underlying cream. Very full and expressive. Excellent for the style. It's very complex, even for the style. It's rather deep and inspired. It's not quite bold, but it's refreshing. It's evocative and inspired. Certainly brewed with care. It has a clear refreshing yet sour blueberry focus, though the blueberry taste may not be as distinct and focused as you'd expect. It incorporates other fruit ester hops to fill out the body and enhance the climax. The finish is a wonderful blueberry re-surge. I suspect that the high quality of the blueberries may alone account for the presence of other fruit esters; often high quality fruit is so full and evocative that other novel flavours are introduced. This may be the case here. In any case, the balance is near perfect; the souring yeasts/bacteria are a bit too dominant in my opinion. 
Mf: Smooth, full, wet, refreshing, and featuring ever-so-slight cream deep in the foundation that's quite nice. Complements the body very well, but not perfectly. (I had this the same night I had the Kaggen! Stormaksporter and the Westvleteren 6 so I'm well acquainted with perfect mouthfeels). 
Dr: It's not quite perfect, but it's the best lambic I've had, and will probably be the best I'll ever have. I don't know that it's worth the price - even aged - but I'm glad to have tried it. It's certainly worthy of special occasions, but better beers can be had at a lower price and for far less effort. However, it does live up the hype if that's what matters to you. For what it's worth, I'll compare all other lambics I have in the future to this one. It's incredibly drinkable and probably one of the most refreshing "dark" fruit beers I've ever had. Certainly a treat.

Smells pretty awesome, some dark grape/berry flavor and plenty of funky sour.
Tastes different than I expected but still incredible. As in the nose, the flavor is as much like dark grapes as blueberries, but still very fruity. Also very sour in a funky metallic brett kind of way.
I was scared I might be disappointed in this beer given its over the top reputation, but it really lives up to that reputation. Excellent beer, worth the trouble of tracking it down.

Review #600
My girlfriend and I have been waiting a long time to try this rarity. If the illustration on the label is any indication of this beer's tartness, I know that we are in for a treat.
The beer poured a stunning, rosey-mauve color. Quite hazy. A small, bubbly cap of light pink froth topped the liquid and quickly dissipated to a resilient ring. Sheets of sparkling lace cascaded down the glass with each sip but none actually stuck to the glass.
Tons of must and barnyard funk came through in the wildly interesting and potent nose. Crisp and quite tart with an underlying note of berry-like sweetness. Lots of fresh hay and lemon peel too. Overall, quite sharp yet pleasant. Put simply, "wow."
Like the nose, the flavor profile was amazingly funky and complex. The berry-like tartness hit hard right away and never really let up. Lots of funkiness and horse blanket notes came through as well. Quite leathery. A mild, fruity sweetness was also detectible. At times I thought I tasted blueberries, but I think this was merely psychosomatic. On second thought, the berry notes seemed more akin to strawberries than anything else. Sharp, super acidic lemon and vinegar notes dominated the crisp, dry finish. Some earthy, woody notes were noticeable as well.
Really nice mouthfeel. The fine yet lively effervescence created a slick creaminess to the body not typically found in the style.
This was undoubtedly the most intense and complex spontaneously fermented beer I have ever sampled. Needless to say, it definitely lives up to the hype. I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to sample this rare gem. 1,720 charactersDamian, Jun 27, 2011

Poured hazy pinkish, some red grapeskin hues with a pink-tinted white head that lasted a decent while. Wow the blueberry is really coming out of the glass. Nicely tart with a strong blueberry flavor... particularly of the unripe, sour blueberry kind. There's a lot more to this: slightest hint of mustiness, grass, and a puckering acidity. The beer is light and refreshing, yet very boldly flavored. Sourness is intense and relentless even in the finish, which is dry and tart. Berry flavor lingers a bit before giving way to a nice bit of funk. The beer is effervescent and dances with carbonation, but not too much so. Crisp and velvety at the same time, I can't really put my finger on it. All I know is that this beer is simply outstanding. Thanks again for sharing, Dave! 876 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 23, 2011

Big thanks goes out to sincereNC for sharing this one with the group! HOLY CHRIST, FINALLY! 2009 Vintage! Served from 375 mL bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a reddish purple with a one finger slight pink head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, fruit, dark fruit, blueberry, and a slight hint of funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, blueberry, fruit, and slight funk. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is nothing short of (as I'm sure you know) excellent! All aspects of this one just worked extremely well together... The appearance was really unique to other lambics I have seen as you could tell there were blueberries involved in this beer before you even smelled it. The aroma was very inviting and I dare say, even mocked me to take a sip. I'm not one to be mocked so I did just that. WOW! There was no tart aspect at all in this one which was nice as I'm sure it would have covered up the delicate blueberry flavors going on here. The slight funky aspect was a really nice touch on the followthrough on this one. Just not a lot bad going on in this one if I'm completely honest. REALLY glad I got the chance to finally try this one as it was one of my harder to get brews via trading. I am currently searching for a 750 mL for my cellar if you have one you want to trade (hint hint traders!). A definite must try even if you have to beg or steal for it!
After typing this review and thinking about it, I am actually tasting the beer again and I indeed know that I need MORE. Someone help me out... 1,747 charactersthagr81us, Jun 21, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 4 - Bottled 2009 - 375ml green corked and capped bottle poured into my Cantillon stemware...
Pours a pale and muddy dark reddish/purple. Not nearly as clear or vibrantly colored as other Cantillons. Two fingers of soft pink head forms and slowly recedes, leaving a nice haze on top for pretty much the whole drink...
Nice aroma of tart blueberries right off the bat, swear I smelled a little grape juice too. The musty Cantillon funk takes over in this beer, much stronger than the fruit component. Finishes with some subtle oak aromas, pretty subdued overall for a Cantillon...
Nice flavor of tart little blueberries, you know, the really little ones in the batch that are really tart, my favorite ones, that's what this tastes like. Tart and blueberrylicious up front, but after a few sips it is all about the funk. Musty and dry, with an oaky finish...
Medium bodied with low carbonation. This one is pretty sticky and syrupy in the mouth, could use some more bubbles to move it along. Quite tart with a dry and acidic finish...
Overall this is a very good beer, but no better than any run of the mill Cantillon, in fact, I'll take a fresh, off the shelf Cantillon fruit Lambic over this any day. 1,210 charactershawks10, Jun 10, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Small pour of the 2007 black foil vintage generously shared by Shaun Hill himself on the night before HF anniversary. Hazy pinkish pour with a few bubbles of foam. Aroma is a pure wonder. Lots of blueberry remains on the aroma despite this bottle’s age, with the regular lambic aromas coming out as a nice dry spiciness, almost peppery. Taste is super fruity but quite acidic too. Never has there been such a perfect match between a fruit’s acidic/sweet character and lambic’s funk/acidity. Everything just blends perfectly into one of my new favourite beers all time. Stunning. 584 charactersLuk13, Jun 02, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle 2010. Thanks to Schmaltzy for the split
A- Pours a darker ruby hue and 2 fingers of pink head that died to a light pink layer of head that remained for the entire drink, slight lacing but not much.
S- My mouth started to water the second I popped the cork and was hit with a wave of sour funk. In the glass there's more subdued mustiness. Both fresh, tart blueberry and sweet blueberry preserves.. Very tart and dry blueberry flavor that leaves your mouth watering before you take your first sip, it entices you to drink it.
T- Sour blueberry immediately then finishes with a huge dry hay/funk finish. The funk on this beer does not end... 3-5min funk finish. Ahhh very impressive. As the beer warms the beer changes... overwhelming crisp sourness is replaced by even more funk. I
M- Nice light body with loads of carbonation that cleanses the palate and leaves you wanting to drink more of this beer. My mouth is still watering after each sip. An excellent fruited lambic, much more sour, funk and lambic-like than sweet and fruity.
D- I would love to sample this one again. 1,093 charactersDJButters, May 24, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 Vintage opened up at my end-of-law school tasting and shared with yourefragile and beandip.
A: Pours a gorgeous ruby-red/purple with a pretty decent whitish-red head. I don't think I've ever seen a beer quite this color before.
S: I literally smell something different every time I smell it I get something a little different, the funk and the blueberry aromas seem to be battling for control here and there are hints of sourness a bit of band-aid lingering in the background. This was pretty much the only aspect of the beer that wasn't mindblowing. 
T: Taste is big on the blueberries up front, but it opens up into a great funkiness that meshes very well with the fruit, then finishes sour, but not overwhelmingly so. The flavors come together perfectly, making this a treat to drink.
M: Mouthfeel is stupendous, it's got very nice carbonation and it really coats your mouth and then finishes very dry, pretty much perfect.
O: When a beer is so hyped up like this one, there is concern about being disappointed in the end, but Blabaer lived up to its lofty billing without a problem. This is damn close to a perfect lambic, it's got everything you could want - fruitiness, funk, sour - in an ideal arrangement. 1,224 charactersstarrdogg, May 15, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5375 mL 2010 batch 6 bottle, shared by starrdogg with beandip.
Beautiful. Color is rich, vibrant grape purple with a reddish hue. Head is a faint pink and initially dense and light; hangs around indefinitely with a thick crown of bubbles and thin film.
Aroma is the only letdown, though there isn't necessarily wrong with it. Mildly sour and juicy blueberry fruit. No funk and basically interchangeable with other good lambics. 
Flavor is both exceptionally sour and blueberry sweet. Finish is thick with rind and fruit skin. Extremely dry and tannic in the finish with some lingering blueberry fruit. 
Mouthfeel is medium thick, with delicate carbonation and a puckering dry finish.
Amazing balance of sour and blueberry fruit, this was the standout of our tasting, thanks for sharing Matt 794 charactersyourefragile, May 15, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had the first three batches of this at the DC epic sour tasting. This rating of 4.3 is for 2007 first batch (so technically batch 2 overall). Batch 1 rating: thanks to ygtbsm94! clear, light orange witha very small white lace on the edge. Nose isnt much blueberry but noticeable since I knew what to look for. Taste is quite geuze like. Super smooth on the palate although quite sour. Definitely more geuze like than fruit lambic. Excellent brew. 4.0
Batch 2 rating: Thanks to tarheels86. Totally different! Deep ruby pour, slightly murky. YOu can actually get blueberry in the nose. Is much more acetic. Very similar sour level to the cantillon kriek. Really really nice sour. Much more acetic and much more blueberry than the batch 1. Very pleasant and drinkable. 4.4
Batch 3 rating: thanks to ygtbsm94. mellowed out. Much better head and retention. Definitely increased carbonation from batch 2, though softer mouthfeel, less blueberry, and less body. 3.9
Batch 5 rating bottle thanks to wavers1. Poured a deep ruby with a light pink, thin head. Nose is tart berry and apparent sourness. If blind, I wouldn’t have placed it as blueberry alone. More mixed cherry/blackberry. Funk. Taste was not as sour/funky as nose indicates, but very tasty and balanced. Mouthfeel was smooth, not as tart, balanced between full berry flavor, tartness, and more berry. Very berry. Probably the most fruit of the batches that I have had. 9 4 8 4 16= 4.1
Batch 6 rating: bottle thanks to Ryan. Best of the 5 I’ve had. Deep ruby red/pink pour with a large frothy pink head. Aroma is a pungent sour blueberry. This is batch 2 on steroids. More fruit and more sour than batch 2, which was my previous favorite. The taste is blueberry skins, bitter rind, tannins. Most of the blueberry comes at the end. Incredibly sour and fruity. 9 4 10 5 19=4.7 1,836 charactersSpencerDB, May 11, 2011

Poured a dark purplish-blue with a pinkish head. Very subtle blueberry aroma with amazing Cantillon funk. A little more musty basement smell then the normal barnyard from Cantillon. On the palate it was dry and light. It seemed to be more tart than sour. Mostly berry flavors with a little blueberry coming through. Extremely easy drinking for a Cantillon beer. Looking forward to having this one again. 484 charactersalampear, May 11, 2011

A- Pours a light orange with a bubbly white head. Clear in initial pour but insanely opaque grapefruit juice color with the yeast. 
N- Subdued blueberry muffin, unblended lambic citrus, funk, sour fruits. 
T- Slight blueberries, unwashed, full of blueberry skins, lots of bright citrus and grapefruit rind that takes over and makes the blueberry very subdued. Overall is very sour and light bodied. 
P- Geuze-like, tannic, sharp, very sour, very bright citrus. Leathery and lactic. 
750mL 2007-1 Batch 2 black foil courtesy of madsberg. This is a totally different lambic all together. 
A- Pours like a kriek that is on crack- straight up opaque purple with a billowing purple head that is insane. Blueberry seeds tumble into the champagne flute. 
N- Full of band-aid, goes almost chemical, and has some baked cherry pie that comes through if you give it a chance. 
T- More acidic, full of sour cherries, blueberry skins. Way different. Blind tasting either batch 1 or batch 2 I would not put as a blueberry lambic. I would put batch 1 as unblended, and 2 as a kriek. 
750mL 2007-2 Batch 3 gold foil courtesy of ygtbsm94. This is where I think Jeppe was able to find a happy medium between batch 1 and 2. 
A- This pours a cloudy pink with less of a pink head. 
N- No band-aid and has more blueberry muffin, brine, cheese, funk, and overall less intense than batch 2. 
T- Considerably more tart, full of lactic acid, more brightly acidic. 
I'm scoring batch 1 as it was my favorite rather than averaging all of them together. 1,633 characterstarheels86, Mar 30, 2011

A-Brilliant, lustrous, deep sapphire blue accented by subtle purple highlights. A thin, pinkish purple head caps the jewel like liquid and leaves spotty lace behind.
S-Gauze pad, tart blueberries and mustiness. Certainly interesting but not the most aggressively aromatic Cantillon beers I have had the pleasure of inhaling.
T-Super crisp tart blueberries with a dryness so pronounced it feels like you are trying to drink the Sahara. Tannic/oak astringency adds depth and additional palate dessication.
M-Light bodied, super dry and extremely crisp. One of the most astringent beers I have had the pleasure of drinking.
D-Whilst it is VERY dry it is easily one of the most drinkable Cantillon beers I have had. Super dry and crisp with just enough fruit sourness to help balance things out. An utterly delightful beer to enjoy slowly and savor each and every sip. 975 charactersDeuane, Mar 26, 2011

This is certainly an experience that hopefully all beer lovers will be able to enjoy at least once. Goddamn is this a wild looking beer. Poured into a Darkness snifter, this guy looks like a funky carbonated blueberry juice. Really pretty.
Smells of blueberry and funk with that Cantillon aromatic quality that is unique to them. Sours were never really my thing, but between Cantillon and Russian River I have really begun to love them.
Taste is again blueberry funk. Fruit there with great flavor, but a softness at the same time. A little sour and tart, but not as much as I expected.
Smooth body with great carbonation and something I need to find a way to trade for. Thanks again Brad, I owe you! 849 charactersLunch, Mar 26, 2011

A: Deep, watermelon red color. The pour produced a pinkish head that faded to a thin rim.
A: Strong berries up front. I get notes of raspberries, strawberries, and yes the blueberries. I also get herbal notes, and notes of citrus spice.
T: Amazing how the blueberries come through. I have had a lot of blueberry beers, but the berries are more prevalent in this than any other. Good amount of bitter sourness and nicely sweet. 
M: Medium body. High carbonation and tingely.
D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty high. The sweet tartness will limit it some, but we're really just splitting hairs. Overall this is one fantastic beer, and one of the highlights of the night. Big thanks to Dave for sharing. Skal. 804 charactersGtreid, Mar 10, 2011

Served in my Ithaca Tulip.
Pours a beautiful clear dark rosy pink. One finger pink-tinted white head. Lacing and retention are normal for style.
So the smell yields giant blueberries and oak. The flavor is fresh and bright-- not dank, musty, or earthy... Some oak and vinegar hit on flavor, but accent the blueberry nicely. Sweet and tart. Very moderate sourness. Tasty and nice. Not really much funk here... And not a ton of sourness... This drinks a bit like a well-made sparkling blueberry juice.
Body is light and airy. Very nice. This is insanely easy drinking... I like it, but I am not willing to stab my wife in the face for another bottle... And I don't really like my wife at the moment (she's pregnant and angry!). 
As far as it goes, this was my white whale.... This beer was very good, but in the end, I'm not sure it lived up to it's hype or my expectations. 930 charactersAleWatcher, Mar 05, 2011
4.11/5  rDev -9.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes
A: this is one sexy looking beer! pinkish to purple in color with a ½ finger pink colored head, leaves frothy spotty lacing
S: a hint of sweetness, a lot of sourness, and hints of berries fill the nose
T: tart! the berry flavor was muted at first and over powered by the strong tartness of this one, but as it warmed, the berry flavors become more evident. the tartness doesn't seem to disappear, just mellows out a bit. there was a strange aftertaste similar to that of a bandaid, but this too disappeared as it warmed.
M: mild to moderate carbonation, dry, medium body
D: maybe the prettiest beer I've had to date, the tartness makes this one a sipper, but better to let it sit for awhile and allow that to mellow out and enjoy more of the berry flavor. 
Cheers!

Pours a turbid, purple-hued burgundy color with a thin lavender head that hangs around the collar. Very acetic and vinegary on the nose with strong tart blueberry and cherry notes. Decent amount of funk, leather and minerality. Taste is also quite acetic with strong tart blueberry and cherry flavors along with lighter earthy funk and mineral. Pours near the bottom of the bottle have more blueberry flavor and more barnyard funk. Ample carbonation and a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Lightly sweet on the finish relative to other Cantillon lambics. Pretty drinkable - the 375 disappeared way too fast. Really great stuff overall. 697 charactersWeisGuy, Jan 19, 2011

A- wow, what a great looking pour. Cloudy purple, pinkish blue. Have never seen a beer this color. Nice one finger pink/cream head
S- The smell really through me off on this. The first wiff is of Band Aids and it was pretty prominent. As it opens up with some movement, that subsides and is replaced by fresh blueberries. The more it sits and breaths, the more the blueberries start to make an appearance. There is a light tart smell to it and small red berry aroma as well.
T- Slightly sour up front with a fresh blueberry puree finish. That sums up the taste of this one, from start to finish that is what I got.
M-This is a thick lambic. It is still relatively a light bodied beer but has some weight to it. It has a dry finish, leaving you mouth yearning for more.
Overall, I am really glad that I got to taste this much sought after Whale of mine. I would love to get more. This is one of a kind as far as the sours that I have had. I would love to open a new batch bottle to see what its like and to see if that Band Aid smell was just part of the aging on the one i had. 1,177 charactersGradyS1, Jan 15, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Happy New Year's Eve. This is how I'm starting off my night. 2009 vintage poured from a 375ml bottle into my Lost Abbey Sinner stemware. 
It poured a deep purple color with the head and bubbles showing a pink or very light purple hue to them. The head retreated to the edges where it remained for a good while. Loved the colors it had to it.
The aroma has a very nice sourness to it without being overly acidic. Some of the berries show through nicely as well. It has a bit of a funky, basement like quality to it that adds to the tart sourness of the fruit. Complex and appealing aroma overall.
The taste starts out with a moderate acidic tartness. The blueberries start to come through next with a tart and sour flavor to them. It has a kind of a musty flavor throughout it as well. In the finish the blueberries come back and linger with some nice sourness to them. Excellent flavor and nice complexity to it. 
The mouthfeel is medium to maybe a little heavy for the style. Carbonation is moderately sharp, but maybe a bit below average for the style. The mouthfeel worked very well for the beer overall.
The drinkability is excellent, it had some great flavors and complexity to it and was a great way to start the evening. It paired very nicely with a few good cheeses we had as well. Excellent beer overall and definitely one of the best if not the best fruit based sour beers I've had. 1,397 charactersbillab914, Jan 01, 2011

So pretty. Tart and acidic on the nose. Has a soft element that I really liken to 3 Fonteinen Hommage at about 1 year. Soft blueberries and raspberries. Pretty meaty. Soft and quite well integrated in the mouth. Deep blueberry skins and stems abound. A little foresty, pretty wild, quite rich. Brett isn't huge though it's quite sour and funky. Oak and soft acids are in the forefront along with the sour wild blueberries. Really enjoyable. 561 charactersJAXSON, Dec 13, 2010

A: Pours an opaque dark purple with a billowing soft looking bright pink head that took forever to slowly fade into a thick fuzzy film. This has got to be one of the coolest and most interesting colored beers I've seen. 
S: Complex and tart notes of lemon zest, mixed berries, and bretty funk. Smells like un-ripened red berries sitting on top a bale of hay that is left in a damp basement. 
T: Not as tart or sour as I was expecting. Rather sweet actually. Blueberry juice flavors mix well with a musty attic notes and some acidic hints of citrus. Aftertaste is full of sour grapefruit or lemon pith. Flavors are all well integrated and mellow enough so that not one aspect dominates.
M: Carbonation froths up on the palate over the medium body and rich, soft mouthfeel. Finish is pretty dry, but not intensely so, with a fair amount of gritty tannins. Very refreshing. The light tartness doesn't overpower any of the delicate fruit flavors. 
D: Overall a very good beer with great flavor and mouthfeel, but not one that I feel I would ever need to seek out again. This is great, yes, but there are plenty of easier to get beers that are just as good. Don't get me wrong though, this is pretty world class. 1,303 charactersscottfrie, Dec 04, 2010

Red wine appearance. Pink head.
Funky brett and acidic aroma. Super tart red berry flavors. Almost smells like a framboise. Some off band-aid scent.
Tart berries up front on the palate. Think very sour blueberries with no sweetness. Bone dry brett flavor with that band-aid after taste. 
Almost didn't enjoy this because of the band-aid off flavor but then it went away after taking a few sips thanks to the acidity leveling my tastebuds. Flavor was short-lived on the palate. Very enjoyable but I liked the '09 better. It was fruitier, which is something I was hoping for in a fresh batch. 615 charactersBearsOnAcid, Dec 04, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -4.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The 2005 Cantillon Blåbær poured a clear, golden orange amber. It looked like beautiful sparkling resin. It smelled like slightly sweet grape, touch of berry, touch of cereal and horseblanket funky sour. It tasted incredibly sour, pucker lemon, funky-cole-madina, lots of oak with a touch, and I mean a touch of berry. It was good. I was aching for a bit more fruit; but don't get me wrong, Cantillon has an amazing capacity to create incredible back-of-your-throat sour lemon puckers, which a lot of people love and crave. And it was good; I just wanted a bit more complexity and fruit flavor like in some of their other beers.
The 2007 Cantillon Blåbær Batch II poured the most beautiful color I have ever seen in a beer. I wanted to just stare at it all night long. It was this incredibly sparkling, brilliant ruby red with a touch of aubergine. Absolutely gorgeous. It smelled like a bucket of tart blueberries. It tasted like tart cranberries, tart blueberries, oak and back of your throat pucker sour. This had the complexity I was looking for. The beer starts tart to sour and then metamorphose into ripe and tart blueberries with the oak rounding out the transition. Beautiful. Elegant. 
The 2009 Cantillon Blåbær was the weakest link of the evening. It poured a cloudy, murky mahogany. It smelled like mulled cider mixed with berry pie. It tasted a little apple cider-y, with hint of cinnamon, sour green apple and cranberry. It was not much to my liking, but it actually helped when it was paired with dessert. 1,528 charactersfemALEist, Nov 27, 2010

Hats off to you, Bill for hooking me up with an elusive brew. 2009 bottle...not sure what batch it was because I couldn't read the scribble those Belgium's wrote on the side of the bottle. Poured into my town hall snifter:
A - A murky purple with nice amount of foam and nice signs of carbonation. The color reminds me of the innards of blueberry pie or a light grape juice.
S - Faint blueberries and a bit of band-aid and barnyard funk. Some citrus notes as well.
T - Flawless. Sour blueberries and bits of hay. Acidic and tannins that make my jaw lock up a bit. Very good stuff.
M - Nice and crisp. Light velvet.
D - Could drink it all the time. I've tried so hard to land this brew and now that I've had the chance to try it I can die a happy man (someday.)

A: an extraordinary indigo color that had little-to-no head with a little bit of sediment.
S: a blast of sour fruits, primarily dark, such as blueberries and plus with clear hints of brett. made my mouth water...
T: an explosion of tartness that made my jaw lock up for a second, which perfectly kept the flavors of blueberry, plum, and oak on my taste buds. wonderful citrusy flavors on the exhale as well.

750ml Batch 5 2009
Dark plum in color with a tan pinkish head that retains lightly in a ring at the edge.
Funky berry nose that comes through sort of sweet and sour.
Puckering and dry. Vinegar like with tons of berry flavor. I caught a touch of sweetness in the flavor as well but not many other people at the tasting did. Maybe it was something I had on my palate from before tasting this one. None the less a very good flavor overall.
Medium-light mouthfeel with some ok carbonation. Not very impressive on this front.
Pretty fairly drinkable but not outrageous here either.
I am eager to try Batch 2 of this beer. From what I hear that is a real treat! 678 charactersHabmike, Nov 21, 2010

From 11/05/10 notes. Had at a small tasting thanks to ygtbsm94; huge thanks to Brad for sharing this very sought after beer! Bottle is from Batch 3, 2007 Vintage.
a - Pours a reddish amber color with two inches of fluffy white head that has excellent rentention and leaves a little bit of lacing and light carbonation evident.
s - Smells of tart blueberry, sour fruits, brett, and oak. The blueberries aren't overpowering, which makes it wonderful to smell and enjoy.
t - Tastes of blueberry, sour fruit, yeast, and brett. Hints of oak as well, but not as much as the smell. The tart blueberries come through a little more in the taste than the smell, but again, pretty amazing.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, very smooth and crazy drinkable. A little bit tart but not too lip puckering, which allows it be be drank easily. Perfect mouthfeel.
d - Wow, what an amazing beer. At 5% ABV, I feel like I could drink a whole bottle of this and still want more. I'm not just marking this up due to rarity; this is one of the best beers I've ever had and if you like blueberries as I do, you'll love this one. We tried various sours at the tasting, including LeBleu and Crianza Helena and I enjoyed this one more than both of them; I came home the next day and immediately tried to trade for a bottle. Would love to have again sometime and truely worth the hype. 1,379 charactersmdfb79, Nov 09, 2010
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 bottle. Had this at the bottle share at the Pour House after the FW14 release party. Big thanks to the generous BA that brought this. Unfortunately all the beer drinking somewhat fogged my memory regarding his name.
Pours a beautiful light pinkish purple with a very small head that laces ever so slightly.
Blueberries, blueberries, blueberries. Some nice citrus notes as well (ruby red grapefruit comes to mind). 
This was much more funky than I had anticipated. The nose doesn't seem to have this same grassy funk, but it really hits your palate and its oh so beautiful. Tart, sour, and very very complex. The flavors just layer between blueberries, sourness, funk. 
Well carbonated that allows the blueberries to just pop on your tongue. 
I could drink this all day. Very very drinkable. I would love to pair this beer with a nice fruit dessert. 858 charactersteamizm, Nov 08, 2010

Vintage 2007; Batch 3
A: Red/Purple color with tons of yeast floaties, a very small frothy head, which dissipated quickly, except for the suds which stayed gathered in the corners throughout the session.
S: Fresh sour blueberries. Brett?
T: Sweetness bleached out by tons of pepper. The sourness reminds could best be described as blueberry "Sour Patch Kids" candy. I eventually took a sip and held it in my mouth for a few seconds. When I did this...wow.... pepper city!
M: Like I stated before, peppery. Also, the cushion of yeast props up the taste better than any other beer I've ever tasted.
D: Remarkable! This is truly a wow beer and it doesn't get much better. It's one of those beers that I will always remember tasting. 838 charactersChaney, Nov 07, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle. Cork says bottled in 2010. Pours a really nice slightly hazes purple color with a pinkish head that both coasters and collars around the glass. Classic cantillon aroma with sour/tart notes but with the addition of subtle blueberries. Slight barnyard as well. Light mouhfeel with good carbonation. Starts sweet upfront with subtle blueberries and lemon zest. Not mouth puckering but for sure both sour and tart. Some barn type flavors as well. No real alcohol flavors. I can see why people chase this beer down as it is exceptionally good. I feel bad having to take this off my gots as this is my only one. 613 characterskbutler1, Nov 01, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5375 ml 2009 bottle split between two tulips and shared with fellow BA Danny at his place in North San Diego County.
Pours a blue-purple with more of a head than most Cantillons I've had the opportunity to sample. The light pinkish-lavender hued head settles quickly but leaves a thick ring around the edges of the glass for the entire tasting.
The lambic funky aroma is very strong but anchored in place surprisingly well by the very clearly defined fruity blueberry notes. The style requisite tart character really works well with this particular fruit.
Blueberry flavors are much stronger on this bottle than I thought based on the observations shared with me by others who have tried it. Acidic, sweet, and oak barrel flavors are perfectly in balance. I'm glad I tried this relatively fresh because although it wasn't as funky as some aged Cantillon bottles I've tried I really enjoyed how much the fruit flavor was intact.
I almost expected a letdown on this brew because of some of the rarity induced hype but this is very impressive even for a Cantillon and among the best beers I've ever tried. Hopefully I can land some more in the near future. 1,156 charactersberkey, Oct 31, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A HUGE thank you to schen9303 for sharing this one. 2009 vintage. Poured from a 750ml capped and caged bottle into a Duchess wine glass. The 100th reviewer for this rarity!
A: Gentle pour yields a .5 finger fine, pink colored head with moderate retention that fades into a thin wisp that lingers atop a cloudy, near opaque, deep purple brew. Lacing is spotty and sparse with little cling. Not much to look at but very appropriate for the style which is nearly still and unfiltered.
S: Nose is immensely oaky and fruity. Blueberries linger in the background and create a nice, sweet backdrop. Oak and barrels are upfront and a subtle tartness tickles the nose. Very aromatic and perfect for a lambic. 
T: Opens sweet and tart, but subtle. Sour hides in the back but comes to the forefront little by little, supported by a dose of wood. Blueberries are present from the beginning to end and maintain an absurd level of balance. Vinegary finish is drying and seems to burn a hole in my stomach. Aftertaste is fruity and dry but lingers on the cheeks. 
M: Medium bodied with very subtle carbonation. Silky smooth and filmy in the mouth with a dryness that builds as the beer lingers and warms. Finish is drying and puckering with an aftertaste that seems to suck the saliva from my mouth. 
D: All day, every day. That's the only real way to describe the drinkability on this one. I've never EVER had a beer that comes close to as good as this one. Perfection in almost every way. The best lambic I've had to date by a mile. And indeed, probably the best beer I've come across to this point. 1,591 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 02, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle: Poured a deep murky blue-ish color lambic with a large enough foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of funky notes with well balance sourness and some light blueberry notes is quiet special and intriguing. Taste is a nice enough mix between some light sour blueberries with some well balanced barnyard notes with good sour notes. All elements are well balanced and provided great enjoyment. Body was quite full with limited filtration and good carbonation. 485 charactersPhyl21ca, Sep 30, 2010

I bet when he shipped it, he didn't think he would be drinking it with me! Batch 6 750ml bottle. I shared this at a tasting. Poured into a Cigar City snifter. (Reviewing from notes)
A- Pours a faint purple color. A 2 finger pink head that recedes to a thin ring. A very beautiful beer. 
A- smells of funk and earth. The blueberries are coming through in a big way. It smells very tart! 
T- tart blueberries that are followed up by more tart blueberries. At some points I swear I get a brief sweetness coming through. A musty earthy taste is present. Just perfect. I don't know what else to say. This is definitely my favorite lambic to date. 
M- on the thinner side of medium. A tart finish that leaves me yearning for another drink. 
D- I don't think it could get any better. Simply perfect! 878 charactersurwithdave, Sep 20, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 2 (first release of 2007), in a 37.5 cl bottle. I remove the cap and I'm greeted with a pleasant "pop" as I remove the cork. I see the foam begin to rise, slowly, so I tilt and pour into my La Chouffe tulip. 
The beer is light purple with a pinkish grapefruit hue. The light purple, champagne-like head flares up and dies quickly. I've never seen a beer of this color.
The dominant aroma is of fresh, tart blueberries. The aroma has some acidity to it...lactic acid with some funk in the background. A gentle swirl of my tulip glass releases more potent blueberries. Zesty, ripe, tart, sour.
Wow...wow. Mouth-puckerly tart and sour. Very sour! The beer segues from tart to sour and then to ripe and tart blueberries. I believe the blueberries create the most complex fruit flavor I've experienced in a sour. The complex finish hits the back of my tongue with more tart blueberry fruitiness, and it leaves me licking my lips, eagerly anticipating my next sip.
Good carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Outstanding.
Batch 3 (second release of 2007), in a 75 cl bottle.
I found this batch to be very similar to Batch 2. The color was nearly identical. I was, however, surprised to find the blueberries a bit more muted than in Batch 2, which surprised me because this was the fresher of the two. Maybe this beer spent less time with the blueberries. I don't really know. There seemed to be a bit more Brett character in this batch as well. 
Batch 4 (2009), in a 75 cl bottle.
I heard from numerous sources that this one was a gusher, so I tilted the bottle over the glass (which was over the sink) while my buddy pulled out the cork. The liquid rose slowly out the bottle and we lost none of it to the sink. 
Wow, this beer is shockingly beautiful. It appears plum purple (I stole that one) with an enormous light pinkish purple head that takes forever to fade.
The aroma is of fresh blueberry energy, lactic notes, and a faint mustiness. This has less Brett character than the previous batches, lending itself more to the lactic character. Some phenol notes are present with a touch of acetic acid. I get lots of oak in the nose. 
The beer is sweet, tart, and delicious. The flavor is sweeter than the '07 batches with a balancing tartness and acidity. The flavor is bursting with ripe blueberries, oak, and tannins. The finish has a touch of Brett and lingering blueberry tartness with lactic notes.
The beer is light bodied and effervescent like always. This is the freshest I've tried this beer, and though I can't say I prefer this batch to the previous ones, it is nice to try it when the fruit is most apparent.
Batch 6 (2010) - 375ml bottle on 9/13/2010 in a snifter. Opens with a light pop. Same resplendent appearance with a very attractive purple pink head. Wet leather bursting with ripe, tart, and slightly sweet blueberries (form a mental picture). Light musty quality and notes of damp earth and barnyard are apparent, but these blueberries are what set Blåbær apart from other Lambics. Holy hell the flavor is amazing. Tart and slightly sweet ripe Danish blueberries with notes of oak and tannins. Glorious tannic and spritzy mouthfeel This beer is excellent, batch after batch, and remains my favorite lambic. 3,244 charactersHopHead84, Sep 14, 2010

A big head forms right off the bat, rosy plum-colored, fluffy, cloud-like, not wanting to budge. Hazy is the body of Blåbær, with a deep cranberry hue. The nose is all phenolic funk. A bit too medicinal for my liking, with vinous greenery, fresh vegetation and wet soil.
More phenols in the taste, with Band-Aids galore. Earthy blueberry rinds and vine clippings. Blåbær slowly numbs the tongue as if it were a low-dose application of topical anesthetic. Slightly distracting, but the underlying sourness and tart, fruity finish is where it should be. Carbonation is big and bubbly, rolling around the tongue with a delicate effervescence. Almost too much for me, although this Lambic does calm down as it warms. Glad I got the opportunity to try it, but Blåbær wasn't quite up my ally. Thanks again Michael for sharing this! 952 characterswagenvolks, Aug 21, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A long overdue rating, from notes. Opened by Todes at a little throwdown at Willard's Tap House.
375mL bottle, poured into a wine glass. The appearance was a dense, cloudy purple with some blood-orange highlights. A thin pink head formed and fizzled quickly. I can tell just from looking at this that it is a completely different animal from other fruit lambics.
LOTS going on in the aroma department. Medicinal qualities. Dentist office aromas, followed by band-aids and big berry sweetness. Blueberries fight their way through, with some laffy taffy peaking in also.
Very heavy on the berries with the flavor, and more of the laffy taffy. Nice and tart but by no means bracingly acidic. Well-balanced would be an understatement.
The mouthfeel is probably one of the more unique things about this beer. Very thick, slick and sticky. Lacking the fizzy effervesence of most lambics. I would rate this lower because it doesn't really go along with the style, but the entire experienced was thoroughly enhanced by this aspect.
Super dry and tart but not abrasive, this is uber-drinkable. Thank you sir, may I have another. 1,124 charactersMcDiddyPop, Aug 14, 2010

Tasted at the Epic Sweet & Sour Tasting I w/ wunderbeer(Ron), ShadesofGray(Ryan), and Dan. Good times!
Poured a strawberry red in color w/ a skim coat white head that left no lacing on the glass. Nose was of earthy blueberries in PVC pipe - crazy! I attempted to slurp my first sip to pull more flavors into the nose, and it literally curled my nose hairs! Taste was the most amazingly tart blueberries you could imagine. The mouthfeel was thin, crisp, and refreshing. Drinkability? Give me as much as you have. Very sessionable.
Overall, finally got taste this brew and was not disappointed. Will be seeking out more for sure. 709 charactersmikeyv35, Aug 02, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Shep - thanks!
Pours an attractive shade of dark purple with a head that's half cream-colored and half purple. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of large amounts of funk - wet hay and leather among others - with solid amounts of tart blueberry aromas. As it warms the aromas grow mustier.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Good amounts of funk flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by solidly tart berry flavors. The berry flavors include blueberries but they're tough to pick out until the flavors sweeten just a bit before a crisp ending.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a nice thickness with active carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass very quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this beer is all that it's hyped to be. I have to say that this beer would work with any fruit but the choice of blueberries puts it in a very unique subset and makes it well worth a shot. 981 charactersglid02, Aug 01, 2010

A - It looks like unfiltered cranberry juice, with scant wispy head.
S - It smells of Band-Aid, generally medicinal, and of blackberry bushes and fresh picked fruit
T - Amazing; huge rustic wild berry flavor. Exceptionally balanced. 
M - The best mouthfeel I've ever encountered from this style of brew. Velvety and so substantial, yet not particularly viscous
D - Insanely good. 575 charactersktrillionaire, Jul 13, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Okay so I decided to pop this one open after a great vacation in San Diego where I got to drink some amazing sours. (Consecration, Red Poppy: draft and bottle, Framboise de Amorosa, and Isabelle Proximus). Had so many great ones this week why the hell not try out the top rated sour? 
Big thanks to Mike for hooking me up with this beer I had been trying to get it forever. 
2009 bottle poured 7-11-10 into my Lost Abbey stem glass. 
A: I haven't seen many, maybe one or two, beers near this color. It is a deep reddish purple. It poured with about 3 fingers of a fluffy pink head that stayed around for a good while. The head is still lingering around the edges. I give the glass a swirl and it looks like strawberry ice cream with blueberries. Amazing.
S: This one starts off with the familiar sour smell, and a nice fruity tartness. Breathing in deeper reveals a good bit of funk, like sweaty horseblanket barnyard funk. Why does that make it appealing to me? More fruit is showing up now, blueberries, maybe some cranberry. 
T: Pretty sour and tart. It has the type of sour that you get from unripe berries, however not really a lot of blueberry but it is there and it is really good. Very sour in the middle, and a very soft touch of blueberries to finish it out. 
M: Very smooth.
D: This is a very drinkable sour and... THE MOST FUCKING EPIC SPILL I COULD POSSIBLY EVERY HAVE!! JUST UNDER HALF A GLASS OF BLABAER DEDICATED TO MY CARPET. WTF!
This beer definitely gets a 1 on the "how easy is it to get out of a carpet" category. 1,542 charactersBS68280, Jul 12, 2010

A- Body is a dark opaque fuschia hue-haven't seen another beer ever this color. Pours with a 1 finger soapy light pink head which fades to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention from there. Some lacing left behind in the glass.
S- Light notes of vinegar, wild sour blueberry, a light funk, a hint of raspberry and other berries as well. Excellent and balanced.
T- Wow. Very balanced. Sour blueberry, a hint of vinegar, a hint of sour tartness. Finish is slightly sweet and fruity but with a hint of lip-puckering tartness and vinegar. Left to linger are under-ripe berries, a hint of vinegar, and a slight tartness.
M- Carbonation is very light and slightly tingly. Body is light to medium weight, somewhat dry and slightly thin.
D- This is a phenomenal brew. Its very complex and balanced. Almost perfect-but not quite. Overall a great sour blueberry lambic and a brew that deserves to be much sought after. 985 charactersPittBeerGirl, Jul 06, 2010

A-pours a dark maroon color, completely opaque with a light purple head that is pretty dense.
S-hint of tart cranberry immediately taken over by a cheesy barnyard funk. light acidity behind with a good sweet completely unripened fruit aroma, cranberry, blueberries and raspberry with a nice tartness to it.
T-the taste is great, nice sour and acidity. the cranberries and raspberries are up front, no where near ripe with that tartness that accompanies fruit of that nature. a light barnyard funkiness, not as present as the nose, with an astringent tartness and sublte blueberry flavor finishing it out.
M-soft feel to it, nice carbonation, syrupy body with a good crisp finish to balance and slightly astringent.
D-great balance, fantastic beer, excellent fruit appearance with perfect acidity and tartness, light barnyard funk adds complexity and works in very well. 931 characterscpetrone84, Jun 27, 2010

I had tried this previously (batch 4), and while I thought it was very good I wasnt blown away. Batch 6, however, was different and this review is for batch 6.
A beautiful dark violet with a nice pinkish/purple 2 finger head.
head dissipates after a little, but leaves a thin light pink layer on the top and there is a bit of lacing
S sour sour sour, funk and leather with a hint of wood and blueberries. perfect mouthwatering sour smell!
T very sour and acetic, the oak comes through and there are definitely some blueberries in the background, tart unripe blueberries. (where i think many sours fail is that they are too acetic and missing the fruit, wood etc flavors) this is an awesomely balanced sour. mouth puckeringly sour, refreshing, smooth with many flavors coming through
M/D wonderful. the balance of this lambic is impressive and makes for a very smooth and enjoyable beer, could drink this all day. 981 charactersdigita7693, Jun 27, 2010

A: Pours a clear, dark purple body underneath a vigorous, frothy light purple head. Crazy. I've never seen a beer this color, and it's amazing.
S: Classic, immense Cantillon funk, including barnyard, mustard, grape, and, yes, blueberries. Incredible.
T: Starts with fruit (blueberry), then gets sour and funky - but restrainedly so. Clean finish. Surprisingly restrained, but thoroughly delectable. So, so good.
M: Fairly light body, yet substantial, with tons of smooth, creamy effervescence. Excellent mouthfeel for a Cantillon especially.
D: I'd kill for more than a quarter of a 375. Extremely balanced for the style and brewery, I would drink this all day every day if I could.
Notes: Huge thanks to Tony for so generously sharing this, and also a shout-out to the amazing trader who threw this in as an extra. Unbelievable. I had no idea when (or if) I'd get to try this beer, and it was the most amazing surprise to see it make an appearance at this tasting. What a way to end an amazing night.

Aroma is straight funk. Lots of oak and straight lemon barnyard funk. Just how I like them. So far so good.
Taste is fairly bland for such a high rated beer. Not enough sourness and blueberry. Tastes like straight funk. Not impressed really. It's not bad, just kind of a let down.
Mouthfeel is very thin. High carb.

A - Pours the color of concord grape juice with a thick, fluffy purpley pink head of 2-3 fingers that lasts for a little while before falling to a thick, creamy collar and leaving lots of sticky lacing behind.
S - Very interesting. Smells of grapes, raspberries and brett mainly. Lots of interesting funk. Looking for blueberries I don't get fresh fruit, more of a blueberry jam.
T - Blueberries are more subtle than I expected out of this. Extremely tart especially up front and very dry. Layered with funky brett in the middle with some horseblanket and general yeastiness and finishing with some lactic and acetic sourness on the finish. Blueberries are somewhat light, but I keep coming back to the blueberry jam character. As it warms up a bit the fruit really starts to come out (and I get some lemony aspects too) and the tartness becomes less bracing and more well integrated into the overall flavor of the beer. A truly great and interesting beer. As it warms further, I really get left with the fresh blueberry juice flavor I was initially expecting. Very interesting how this beer changes through the range of temperatures - from fridge temp to approaching room temperature.
M - Light bodied, carbonation is medium high. Tart/sour flavors dominate and cause a definite puckering sensation on every sip. A bit of warmth though really does wonders for this beer. The flavors really open up on this turning a "good" sour into a great beer. Wow, warmer temps on this are leaving me very impressed.
D - On first sip, I was a little bit unimpressed by this. The tart and sour nature were overwhelming and masked a lot of the subtleties in this beer. As it warms the true character of this beer really stands out. Jammy and fresh fruit blueberry character becomes very prominent in a very good way. Would love to be able to try this one again, but I won't hold my breath. 2,026 charactersportia99, May 31, 2010

A - Maybe the coolest looking beer that I have ever seen. Stouts are either brown, black, or really black. This beer looks like something you would like to see on the best HDTV that you can find. Stunning purple pour into my flute. Really, this is the best looking beer that I have ever seen.
S - Typical profile for Cantillon with tartness and oak coming through first. This is not a blueberry forward beer, but you can smell the skins of the blueberry.
T - Sour up front with oak and sour berry taste. Not the most sour beer that I have had with the taste following the smell largely. 
M - A bit thin, more sparkly than anything else.
D - Very easy and sessionable. 
Given how hard this is to get and the cost involved, I would probably be happy with multiple bottles of supplication or temptation. The blueberry profile makes it unique, I am just not sure that I will pony up to purchase this one again given the cost. 1,118 charactersBeerisheaven, May 25, 2010

Batch 4.
A: This brew pours a stunning shade of deep blue, bordering on purple, with radiant crimson hues that give the beer a brilliant appearance. Sitting atop the liquid is a thick layer of lilac colored bubbles. The head retention is something to behold. I have never seen a head camp out for this duration of time, most especially on any Cantillon offering. I'm not sure if it's ever going to fade.
S: Distinctive and easily recognizable as Cantillon. Tart fruits and barnyard funk aromas. It's difficult to single out blueberries, though the overall aroma is fantastic.
T: Sour blueberries as fresh as they can be, balanced with enough tartness to make the beer utterly slammable. Wow. This beer is just phenomenal.
M: The feel is a bit on the thin side. If it was perhaps a tad thicker, maybe it could be even more tart and fruity? 
D: I truly wish this was more available. Definitely one of the best beers I have ever had. 996 charactersHuhzubendah, May 18, 2010

Beer is superbly pungent. Tons of sour coming through, acetic and lactic with some funky woodsiness that pulls the whole thing together. I could smell this all day long.
Beer is thin and light in body. Carbonation in the mouth props the body up a bit. Very sour and tart, good fruit character. I could session this all day long. Know where I can get a keg of this stuff? If I had to criticize it I would say it finishes too quickly due to the low body. I know lambics are suppose to attenuate out at a gravity near that of water, this one seemed thinner than others. If it had a little more to it, slightly more body, I feel the fruit would have popped more. Enough complaining though. This was the best lambic I've ever had and would drink it again, buy it again, trade for it again, fly to Europe to buy a bottle. 964 charactersdrabmuh, May 17, 2010

S - Lots of fruity berry goodness, including what seems to be blueberries. Little bit funky with some nice tart sweetness.
T - This was nice, but kind of disappointing given what I was hearing my friends say about it. A buddy of mine drank it with me and he said Batch 1 was significantly better. Has a funky blueberry taste, but not quite as sweet an tart as I was hoping. Little yeasty, and a little bit of heavier flavor than I wanted.
M - Syrupy and medium bodied, slightly creamy, nice carbonation, but would have preferred it a touch lighter.
D - Sweet and unoffensive, so it's pretty easy to drink. Not a session beer so to speak, but an easy drinker. 764 charactersAgentZero, May 14, 2010
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Pours an absolutely beautifull dark peach/grapefruit red. A very small amount of light passes through. If you tilt the glass you can definitely see some purple. Almost no head at all on a very coservative pour.
S: Funk and fruits dominate the nose. I dont really pick up on any blueberry, just fruityness in general. The funk is quite strong in the small, its obvious this big boy is going to be a bit sour. This is the best smelling lambic Ive ever tried.
T: wow. Very sour and tart upfront. A bit mouth puckering at first, just the way I like it. The blueberry comes out half way through, especially if you swirl a bit in your mouth. The finish is crisp and refreshing.
D: Perfectly carbonated, just amazing. This is drinking very well right now. I could easily sip on this all night if it wasnt such a whale to get.
I hate to give a beer all 5's, but this is easily the best lambic Ive ever had. One that truely lives up to the hype. 943 charactersMag00n, May 12, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I received this beer a couple of months ago from a friend in Belgium. Dated 2009 with what appears to be a "D" next to it. Decided tonight was a good night to give it a run. Split with my wife and poured into a Westvleteren chalice and a champagne flute. We've both been digging different sours lately and apparently consensus implies this is the best available.
Poured a cloudy plum that was a lot thicker and more purple than I anticipated. Very murky in there with little light passing through. A short pink-hued head formed but disintegrated within a very short while, leaving only a slight lace. 
Smell was largely what I anticipated, minus the blueberries. Tart, funky, horse blanket. Tart fruit - but not blueberries. Still a great smelling beer, I just expected a bit more on the "berry" side.
But the blueberries rear their heads in the drink. Tart is the first taste to arrive followed very closely by sour blueberries. The funky sour is so appealing - definitely what I look for in this style of beer. There is virtually no sweet at all, which is ideal for my tastes. Perfectly carbonated and medium-bodied, this is a treat to drink. 
I was definitely impressed with the Blabaer. The smell was really the only part of the session that fell short of my expectations. It's too bad it is such a tricky brew to corral; this is one I could drink all night. My wife was not quite as impressed - while she certainly enjoyed it, it wasn't until she pulled out the chocolate covered strawberries that she was truly convinced. It'll rank high on our list of sours, but unfortunately its scarcity is going to prevent it from being one of our go-to beers.

Pours a bluish/purple with a beautiful, foamy head. 
Naturally, lots of blueberries in the nose. Me, not being a sourhead, was a little anxious with this, but I didn't pick up much funk. Just juicy, farm-fresh blueberries. I seem to get more of a mixed berry whiff a bit later. I guess there is a slight vinegary component here but not enough to turn me off.
This is tart! Definitely a tad mouth-puckering. I'm getting oakiness and some leather hits, but I can't separate from those delicious blueberries! 
Perfect, medium carbonation. I could drink this all mother loving day. This beer is everything I was led to believe it was. Refreshing, gorgeous, mesmerizing. Dare I say it's a gateway sour? Good luck finding this particular gate again though. 920 charactersrudylaw, May 08, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Another great beer sent to me by Anders. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into four tulip glasses. 
Batch 2009 - II
A- Pours a hazy, dull cranberry / maroon color. Produced two fingers width of off-white head with a pinkish hue. Reduced to a thick ring. Good lacing. 
S- Instantly, blueberries just explode into the nostrils...almost have a vinous nature to them. Lots of barnyard funk underneath it all. Really digging this.
T- Much like the aroma. Heavy blueberry flavors upfront with a unique, vinous nature beneath. Almost one dimensional, but balanced out with a building sourness and some funk in the finish.
M- Light bodied with great carbonation. Really easy on the palate.
D- As for as fruit lambics go, this is pretty drinkable. Good overall balance between the blueberries and the acidity.
Overall, one of the better fruited lambics by Cantillon. Recommended if you're a fan of blueberries. 903 charactersrhinos00, May 06, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 vintage. 
Deep blood red garnet hue with a pink head on top. Looks beautiful in the glass. Aromas are bursting with a vibrant mix of fresh blueberry and great funk. Woody with mellow vinegar. Just bursting with wonderfulness. 
First sip brings vibrant berry flavors melding beautifully with wood and a mellow funk that's a little tamer than usual for Cantillon. Blueberry is all over the place and the mellow acidity and wood plays in so well. This is incredibly delicious and drinkable and it makes me sad to finish the glass. 
Mouthfeel is smooth light and creamy...arid and oh so easy to drink as the acidity is not as overwhelming as most Cantillon's. Just a lovely beer and worthy of the high praises it has received. YUM! 735 charactersorbitalr0x, May 01, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 batch 2. 
This esteemed beverage is purple in the glass, and smells like fresh blueberries and ripe armpits. The taste is blue and berryful. There is also some red wine.
Being six months old, the fruit isn't as full figured as a fresher bottle; blueberries aren't as robust to lambic as cherries, it seems. 
Not worlds apart from the Lou Pepe series, but the Danish blueberries are what I'm partial to. 410 charactersalfrantzell, Apr 26, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Vintage '09. Big thanks to Mr. C for the hook up on this.
This one was a gusher. But luckily I was ready and none of the sweet nectar was lost. Pours a dark, hazy blackberry with a silky purplish head. Truly exceptional color.
Nose has tart berries, damp hay, horse blanket, manure and oak. Doesn't quite have the blueberry presence I was looking for.
Taste is a perfect blend of fresh blueberries, barnyard funk and wooden wine barrels. Superb balance.
Crisp, refreshing body has a delicate yet brisk carbonation. Dry, sour finish lingers nicely.
This is certainly a beautifull beer, but seems to be on it's way down. The Cantillon funk is slowly starting to take of the wonderfull blueberry flavors. Like any fruit lambic, this is most likely best enjoyed fresh. 769 charactersrye726, Apr 17, 2010
4.51/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5375ml bottle from soulforpeanuts, who is the man. Thanks, Rick! This bottle was from Batch 5, I believe, with 2009 and what looks like a 2 printed on the bottle.
Blåbær (I'm still not 100% sure how to say the name of this beer) pours a dark but fairly clear purplish color, really stunning, with a one-finger head that has pinkish hues. This is not the appearance I expected after having had other blueberry beers. I like it a lot.
Aroma is very nice, but not a standout for a Cantillon fruit lambic. Cantillon's signature yeast is ever-present. Bretty funk and lactic notes as well as a substantial blueberry presence.
The flavor is intense sour blueberries (not too sour though) and a little funk. I got some grape flavors in there as well, and definitely some vinegar notes. I poured it out in 3 increments, and I feel like the flavor got more intense toward the bottom of the bottle.
The palate is somewhat typical for a Cantillon fruit lambic, which is to say it's awesome. There's really a great tingling that you get on the mouthfeel that almost chokes you up. That is a very good thing. Body is medium and mouthfeel is lively. Medium level of acidity for the style.
Very drinkable. I kept coming back for another sip, and my girlfriend, who I shared this with, had to get me to slow down so she could have some. What an excellent beer. I don't know if I could rank it over some of the Lou Pepe beers with age on them, but then again, this beer could probably be pretty damn incredible with age too. Looking forward to trying this one again. 1,555 charactersnickd717, Apr 17, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle thanks to callmemickey. I believe this is batch 4 or 5. 
Pours solid purple with beautiful pink bubbly head that lingers for minutes. Aroma is easily dominated by blueberry, but has some great lemon and orange along with earthy funk/horse blanket. Taste is mild honey sweetness then great tartness. A little vanilla on the finish but then a lingering blackberry taste on the tongue. Great tartness, well balanced and good carbonation. Another incredible lambic from Cantillon. 484 charactersChrisPro, Mar 28, 2010

A- One of the most unique looking beers I've had. Pours a purple-ish pink with a pale pink 1-finger head. Leaves little to no lacing.
S- Smells very acidic with lots of berries on the nose. If you handed this to me and said it was a kriek lambic, I wouldn't challenge it based on the smell. Very funky also.
T- Substantially different than the nose. The blueberries are much more pronounced than I had anticipated. I don't get a whole array of berries here, the blueberries stand alone. Also, less sour/acetic than the nose led on and a lot more funk than I had anticipated. 
MF- Less carbonation than I would prefer and maybe even a little syrupy (but this could just be a function of the under-carbonation.) 
D- Great, I could drink this all night. Sourness doesn't slow you down at all and the funk is heavy and nice. 982 charactersmbudner, Mar 27, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Small 2009 corked and capped bottle, poured into a tulip. 
The presentation is gorgeous, with a deep glowing burgundy color, similar to fresh wine, but better, considering the off white, pink stained cap that holds reasonably well despite the soft carbonation. 
The aroma is great as well, the blueberries are just an accent, as opposed to some fruit beers that are plain overdone. Funky, leather, sour and acidic notes, some phenol can be noted as well. 
Medium bodied, refreshing despite again soft carbonation that does go well with the flavor; this is bone dry, somewhat tart and quite acidic; the blueberries lend a rare slightly sweet note, but it is always dry, tart and acidic. Long and pleasant after taste.
A great beer, wish I had a full case to partake during summer. The fruit here comes the way I like it, as a contributing flavor as opposed to a dominating one obscuring all the good beer notes. 911 charactersbrdc, Mar 19, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +3.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 bottle shared by jammalamma. Poured into a mini goblet. The beer pours an insane color! Light purple, hazy/foggy with light pink edges. There is a thin bubbly pink head that fades quickly to a tiny ring around the edges of the glass, leaving barely any lacing.
The smell is tart blueberries first, but they are fleeting and quickly replaced by a more sweet berry note. There is a healthy amount of oak, hay and a bit of vinegar. I can also pick up a bit of caramel or sugared candy sweetness very briefly. 
The taste is much more tart than the smell let on. The tart blueberries, hay oak and funk come at you full blast. After the initial tart berry component there is a quick sweet blueberry note, but it's quickly replaced by a hint of vinegar sour and a return of the tart blueberries in the finish.
This one is very well carbonated for the style, not too much or too little, but just right. The beer has a nice dry finish and the flavors are really great, making this one highly drinkable. I would love to get my hands on another bottle. This is one of the few beers that I have had that exceeded my very expectations and all the hype. 1,147 charactersrpstevens, Mar 15, 2010

A: Poured a deep ruby with a nice light ruby head that left a bit of lacing on its way down.
S: Quite a bit of lactic sourness, without much vinegar smells coming through like with Saint Lamnivus. Definitely quite a few blueberry notes marking their way in. A little bit of sweetness.
T: Quite a bit of acidity, but nothing too overwhelming like several other beers coming from Cantillon. The blueberry taste is simply astounding, blending beautifully with the sweet, tart sourness. The blueberry flavor is quite unique and pungent, tasting almost like crushed blueberries that had previously been frozen, as opposed to fresh blueberries.
M: Beautiful acidity balanced against a lovely fruit aroma--very well done. 
D: Very, very nice. Wish this had been a 750 as opposed to a 375. Exceptionally thrilled that I got to try this one out. 855 charactersThorpe429, Mar 08, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Seeing as I have nothing that I could offer in a trade for this brew, I took the short route and bought this on ebay. 
Small not very informative label on this 750ml bottle, this is a 2009 vintage with the 2009 appearing to be hand written with some unidentifiable symbol next to it.This bottle is corked then capped. Time to put my corkscrew to work...
I popped the cap and some beer leaked out immediately and lots of bubbling sitting on the cork. I got the corkscrew in and I'm pulling on it but damn, it's going to be some work to remove it. I had to hold the bottle between my knees and pull to get the sucker out.
The smell hit my nosebuds as soon as the cork came out but I don't want to skip ahead so..
It pours a very reddish brown with a 1" head of pink white foam and lots of sticky lacing. I'm holding my glass to the light and I can't see through it so I guess I can say it's cloudy or murky or whatever. A great looking brew is the bottom line here.
The smell is supremely tart. Hell, and funky. The unmistakable stamp of blueberries is here along with a vinegar like sourness but the influence of Brett is just as strong and overall, a very intriguing nose. I can't wait to taste it.
Ahhh...blueberries well represented! Both in the unripe sour variety and sweet sweet ripe variety that most folks, including myslef, toss on their corn flakes for breakfast. The funky tones seem to be toned down compared to what I experienced in the smell and....that's ok with me. The reason I sought this brew out was the irresistable attraction that blueberries in beer has for me. The vinegar smell is also not as strong in the taste so the overall tartness factor in this Cantillon brew isn't even close to being over the top. Let the berries revel in their tasty goodness, I say, and that's exactly what my palate says they are doing. Touche!!
More sips in and the level of "funkiness" seems to change..sometimes more present, sometimes less. A flavourful addition to the taste of Blåbær's blueberries either way and maybe without it, I wouldn't find it the enticing beer that it is? 
It has a medium body with the carbonation on the light side but that fits this Lambic to a tee.
Drinkability? I'm probably a bigger fan of blueberries, when done right, in a beer than most so take my words with a grain of salt...incredible drinkability! 2,354 charactersBitterbill, Feb 21, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Dark purple in color, reminiscent of a Merlot in the body. Dense head is pinkish red with high retention despite having flecks of blueberry in it. Delightful in appearance. Aroma of finest Belgian style funk, Cantillon signature, with added presence of lilac, berries, and cattiness. As much as I love blueberries, they are not the most aromatic fruit out there. The flavor is classically funky with dark fruits, cherry, currants, and a tart berry finish. Medium in body with a smooth higher level of carbonation as expected. This is quite a tasty beer, indeed, though I still prefer Fou Foune or Lou Pepe Kriek or Framboise. The only thing truly exceptional about this beer is about how difficult it is to get. 711 charactersvacax, Feb 14, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I didn't think I'd get the chance to try this one.
Pours a deep blue/purple, wispy foam. It looks unique and very tasty, no doubt. 
Aroma is of wild tart blueberries, a little chocolate, and...a good deal of something that I would describe as "gas station bathroom." Heavy funk presence....funky in a way I don't think I've smelled it in beer before. This seemed to subside as it warmed, giving way to more of a pure tart berry aroma. 
Taste is dominated by tart berries - blueberries, but probably also raspberry, blackberry...more of a "mixed berry." Suggestions of chocolate, and the famed Cantillon sourness. Though this isn't the most sour Cantillon out there. It doesn't bowl you over with acidity, which I think is a good thing....it allows you to really taste the berries. Very decadent-tasting beer. 
Excellent level of carbonation as well. Bubbly, but does not get in the way of the taste at all. 
For me, this lived up to the hype. I could easily drink a lot of it...of course, I know that will never happen given the scarcity and high demand for these bottles. 1,077 charactersPatrick999, Feb 14, 2010

2009 Vintage (don't know the batch#) thanks to Mikesgroove for this one.
After I took of the cap, the cork slowly rose up, which I thought was weird. I didn't even need a cork screw and it popped off like a rocket and hit the ceiling.
Poured into Lost Abbey tulip.
Pours a massive fluffy raspberry pink head. Fades to a thin layer and decent retention from there. Leaves some splattered lace. Color is a dark blackberry purple. Very nice looking beer. 
Aroma: Wow, this is funky. Lots of sour acidic flavors. Leather and horse blanket. This beer is very funky and mouth watering. I get a nice amount of oak along with a decent amount of blueberries. It is smelling very fine.
Taste: This beer is very sour and acidic. A decent amount of vinegar flavors. I also get some cough syrup light flavors which I find to be odd. Lots of leather and horse blanket, maybe even some tobacco. Lots of oak flavors. If I didn't know it, it would be hard to pick out the blueberries. I get more dry cherry flavors. A very nice beer, but it isn't what I was expecting. 
Mouthfeel: Sour with some tartness. Nothing compared to some of their other sours in terms of sourness. Medium bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Ends dry and oaky relatively sweet. 
Overall, this is a solid beer, just nothing I was really expecting. I am really glad I got to try it, but I would be hard to trade off a bunch to try another bottle. Definitely worth a try. Pretty drinkable. I won't have a problem with this 375. I dig it. Very unique.
EDIT: After trying a fresh 2010 batch shared generously by kbutler1, I have come to realize why everyone loves this beer so much. Fresh blueberries dominate the nose and the taste on this batch. It has the perfect amount of sour and funk blend. It is very drinkable. This is a beer that needs to be drank fresh! The blueberries show much more and makes it a real treat. 1,904 charactersmothman, Feb 03, 2010

This review is of a Batch 4 bottle (2009)
A: The pour is a fantastic looking deep purple color with a fluffy pink head on top.
S: The nose is certainly very fruity, but I don't necessarily detect a lot of blueberries. There are some great cherry, raspberry, and a mixture of other tart berries. There is also a lot of lactic tartness, but not as much in the way of funk or wood as you usually expect from Cantillon.
T: Like the nose, the fruit is really the star of the show in this beer. A mix of indistinguishable tart berries really hits you up front. The oak comes through a bit more in the flavor, but is not overpowering. While I had been noting a lack of blueberry flavor, they really come out on the finish.
M: The body is medium to full with a nice tingly carbonation on the tongue.
D: This is one of the most fruit forward lambics/wild ales I've come across. I really enjoyed the balance of the fruit and the traditional funk and sourness. 1,089 characterswomencantsail, Feb 01, 2010
4.06/5  rDev -10.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 release, not sure if it is Batch 4 or 5
Pours an absolutely ridiculous color...beautiful deep red/purple with a half finger of pink head. Possibly the most unique looking beer I've ever seen.
Smell is tart berries up front. I personally wouldn't be able to identify it as blueberry if I didn't already know. Some cobwebs creep in reminding you that this is a Cantillon beer sitting there. The fruitiness continues to build as it warms.
The taste is surprisingly subdued in the tart/funk departments. Blueberries and wild cherries are the dominant flavor. Oak is definitely noticeable. A very balanced lambic from a brewery who is usually quite brash. Tasty for sure though.
Mouthfeel is medium to full with a tiny bit of carbonation sting and a very dry finish. This beer is definitely very good, but I would be curious to see how other batches compare. This one was tasty, but not a standout. 902 charactersalcstradamus, Jan 21, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I drank this 2009 version, not sure which batch(I'm guessing 4), from a 22oz bottle into my Rodenbach tulip.
The beer pours a deep grape jelly colored purple with a nice medium pink head. The head rises about 3 fingers and is very creamy and soft with great retention and lace. Probably the best head I've seen in a lambic. 
The aroma is medium with mostly tartness coming through, some horse blanket mostly. Its nice because you get the funkiness you're looking for but not so overpowering that you get tired of it. At the end you get a little sweetness, but not much blueberry. 
The taste is great, its super complex and well balanced. It starts soft and sweet and highly drinkable, towards the middle and end it evolves to have nice tartness. Once again, like the aroma it gets you the tartness you desire in drinking a lambic but not so overpowering that you can't drink a ton. At the end you finally get some blueberry mixed with a final tart goodbye. 
The feel is nice and heavy with a lasting feel.
The drinkability is off the scale.
Overall this is an outstanding beer. From the taste I'm guessing its batch four because its balanced with sweet and funk. A lot of top beers don't live up to the hype but this one certainly does. 1,242 charactersjrallen34, Jan 20, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Edit, almost forgot 2009 bottle unsure of batch # at the moment...but judging from the quick notes at that other beer site, I would guess I have batch #4.
First let me preface by saying I grew up on a 44 acre Cattle and Horse farm that had wild blueberries, wild strawberries, wild apples, wild blackberries, wild pears, and a few other little goodies growing on the property. And I believe it's that reason that I truly love this brew.
I poured directly from the fridge into a Lindemans tulip (how many of you want to kill me for that?). Pours wonderfully, although quite hazy. This could be the fridge more than the beer though. For some reason my fridge always tends to chill haze lambics and gueuze. 
A dark mix of garnet and deep violet create almost a mahogany color topped with a very interesting head. It has this amazingly pink center that fades ever so gradually down a hue to a whiter pink on the edges. As an artist I find this color ramping to be sublime.
Initial impressions on the nose are a vinergary tartness but it actually feels as though it's alive. The tartness level literally felt like it curled inward progressively. I loved it. The usual funk/barnyardy smells are present and make a strong showing which then seem to literally morph into a wild blueberry tartness. And I swear I pickup some stinky cheese (but a good stink) about midway through the nose. 
Still chilly at this moment. I definitely taste the cheesiness in the middle to the end. Some more vinegary notes compliment the odd cheesiness well. The blueberries are almost a flash at this temperature. The tartness increases towards the middle with the fruit flavor literally flicking your tongue on initial taste. 
The fruit flavor is sublime to say the least. If you like wild berries, this is just amazing. Dominated by wild blueberry, with some flavors/consitencies that seem like the skins as well with a slight grapefruit tartness. I can best describe the wild blues as to me, tasting like a grapefruit with a light zesting of lemon rind, perhaps a drip or two of fresh lime juice. 
---
As it is now rounding the recommended temp I feel I should divulge further. 
So much more wild blueberries on the nose. The smell has almost become the inverse of what it was. Now the cheese is playing the low and slow role. It hints in the front, but the blues now dominate from middle to end. 
While intriguing cold, this is now changing into a wild blue bomb. Cheese & vinegar await you the second you swallow, but I am just blown away by the wild blue flavors. Also picking up some very subtle oaky notes in the front of the smell. 
Mouthfeel appears to thin a little as it warms, but it coats your mouth so wonderfully I couldn't give it a lower score. It seems to clean itself up so well as it travels.
The aftertaste is no longer in the middle of the tongue as it was earlier (I swear it stuck dead center with the berry-ness). It now is a clawing sourness that I love more than anything. Literally feels as if there are two hands clasping the sides of my tongue. Loving this, extremely pleasant. 
Sorry for the book, this is my first review and I have literally two pages of notes and feelings about this particular brew. 
Thank you Cantillon and Jepe!
I prefer gueuze in most situations, but I find myself unable to put this down and not think about it, although I'm sure rarity and excitement play into that here's the real reason...
Directly quoted from my notes:
"This farm boy is practically time traveling to a simpler year. Cliche I know, but honestly I am awash with feelings and memories of growing up on the farm. Barefoot through the grass, eating handfuls of wild fruits, running with the horses as a child...Highly recommended to ANY country folk, I'm curious if this brew envokes anything similiar for the city dwellers. I could literally smell and daydream all day with this beer in hand!" 3,906 characterssleepydave, Jan 15, 2010

Very hazy purple.. no real head despite a nice carbonation... 
Nose is tart fruit with quite a bit of barnyard and horsey funk.. fruity and funky and a great complexity.. smells very sour.. more sour than funky.
Flavor is flashed with true "fresh wild" blueberry.. but the lambic components are abundant in the front and mid palate.. Not as sour as I was expecting.. instead a really tart/tannic fruit skin sorta sucks the saliva from my head.. lite lactic.. but never acetic.. The funk is surprisingly mild in my mind. very well balanced.
I am amazed this was not more SOUR ... this is far and away the least sour fruited Cantillon that I've ever had... yet the blueberries really do a number on the style... marvelous and worthy of the hype... fruity, tannic, mild woody, and brilliant.
Fuck, Sam... I don't know how to follow up this surprise.. I need to try... back to the drawing board.

A: Pours a murky reddish magenta body. The pour develops a finger of frothy pink head that retains moderately before lapsing into a thick collar. 
S: Blueberries, funk (horse, barnyard), some lacto, oak, and leather. As I was taking these notes, I thought to myself that I liked St. Lamvinus better... In transcribing them, I'm not sure I'd still say that. 
T: Tart blueberries, but I can see why Chad said they taste more like a reddish berry of some kind. It doesn't *quite* taste like fresh blueberries, unlike other fruit lambic varieties. Maybe something about the harvest for this particular beer, or the way blueberries work in this beer? Who knows. Hints of citrus. The sourness is a restrained lactic presence with some grape-like vinegar. Most of the wild flavor is funk and barnyard; the finish is VERY leathery with a mild astringency. 
M: Medium-bodied, with low carbonation. Semi-dry. It cleans up pretty well, but it does start to coat the mouth. 
D: This beer is immensely drinkable against some other Cantillon varieties that are intensely acetic or dry. This delivers the flavor without being so extreme that it becomes tough to finish. Cleans up well for the most part. Goes down too easily, almost. 1,363 charactersArbitrator, Jan 12, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a beautiful dark plum color with dark purplish mahogany edges and a one finger frothy pinkish/plum head that quickly dissipates into a miniscule off white ring that eventually fades as throughout the duration of the glass.
Earthy funky musty aroma with a good bit of barnyard horseblanlet character. Lots of sweet vinous dark fruit notes especially bluberry of course as well as some grape and plum.
Slightly tart and very puckering with a lot of musty barnyard funk. Not very acidic with a lot of earthy oaky tannis. Lots of dark fruit notes that adds to the sweet vinous, vinegary character. The blueberries really come through as well as some grape, plum and fig. Very complex and well balanced. This beer is surprisingly drinkable considering how complex and funky it is. I wish I could drink this again. Highly recommends! 835 characterscorby112, Jan 10, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Generously shared by Darren, of the Belmont crew. Always a class act.
Pours a really intriguing purple pink, and the reflected color in the head is just delightful. Just a gorgeous beer. 
The smell is where the concentration gets sucked in. Fairly aggressive nose, letting loose that blue pungence, it is hard to remove ones nose from the glass. 
While the smell comes off pretty strong, the taste was quite a bit more mellow to me. Not as sour as one might expect, though this was likely a more recent vintage. Nonetheless, the sourness was very pleasant, and did let the light blueberry flavor shine through, though not as strong as one might expect from this. Some heavy phenols present in this one. 
Being urbanites, we all agreed that we could relate the rich funk to a phone booth, as we have few horseblankets for reference around here.
All in all, quite a satisfying beer, and a real treat. Does it live up to the hype? Welll.... grain of salt. World class beer, just not sure I would trade my little sister for one. 1,029 charactersShareANevada, Jan 08, 2010

Review #650
Batch 4 bottled 2009.
Appearance- Pours a dark purple pinkish with a beautifully light pink and creamy one finger head. A perfect cap and collar (almost a half finger) remain the entire beer but unfortunately not a lot of lacing.
Smell- Definitely has that somewhat recognizable Cantillon smell. It's vinegary and tart with more of a Lambic kick than an actual berry kick. That's not to say the blueberry isn't noticeable though. It's unmistakably blueberry although I do get a bit of rhubarb and raspberry. A bit of worn leather and sweat adds a small amount of funk. It definitely smells WAY more sour and tart than funky. My mouth is watering awaiting my first sip.
Taste- Starts with a light bit of an acidic kick and a somewhat puckering quench. Definitely not as sour as I was expecting as the fruit isn't all that sour and the beer is still fairly tame. There is a light lactic twang under there though don't get me wrong. The beer is fairly tannic as the quench is woody and lightly vanillin. I'd even say there is a slightly red grape like vinous character to the beer but its way less than others I've tried. As it warms though the fruit in the beer does kick up slightly but it's still fairly light. A lingering dirtiness with a bit of tobacco and fungus.
Mouthfeel- Definitely one of the heavier bodies I've felt on a Lambic as it's damn near creamy. A semi aggressive kick of carbonation is prevalent the entire beer.
Drinkability- So this beer wasn't exactly what I was expecting or hoping for as the blueberries are fairly light and the beer is fairly tame. I know it'll sour up more as time goes on but for now it's very easy drinking. Too bad this wasn't such a bitch to get or I'd grab another bottle to sit on for a year or so. Thanks much Randell! 2,005 charactersyounger35, Jan 07, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Many thanks to Wespatrick.
A red-velvet cake, they're her favorite you know, and a lovely day for a celebration, all velvety and purplish... Only a couple soap-bubbles there, a still, beautiful maroon but blueish, like that dress at our first wedding, but no not that blueish, more of an old worn-out sweater that's so comfortable and makes me want to hold her close. 
There are my old friends, the bugs, the lacto and pedio and sacchar... and my buddy Brett, of course. but they all pale in comparison. She is beautiful. There is a blueberry aroma, a true... like the purple ice cream you used to love, luscious. Creamy vanilla in there too, all of this overwhelmed by the sour, mind you. And a kiss that takes my breath away. 
The flavour, a deep, heavy sour, so sour, so puckering... does anyone know before this what fermented blueberries really taste like? This is peculiar.... and exceptional. 
My wits come back to me and I stare into her eyes... where did you come by this, my love? I simply have to wonder at the depth of your eyes, their fire, their beauty. And blueberries... it's going to stain my mouth, I'll be purple, everyone will know... but no matter. my heart is yours. So sour it's surprising, with a deep flavour of blue, the colour of blue, the essence. 
A surprisingly full body, and of course oh-so-attractive in shape (you are beautiful my love!) and dry. Super-dry in the finish, and a light sweetness in the background that is completely overcome by the massive cocktail of sour.
I simply can't have you all the time, but you are lovely, and one day... It is wonderful. It truly deserves every bit of its reputation. And I am the luckiest man in the world. 1,684 characterskhiasmus, Jan 07, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 4 375ml bottle courtesy of and split with beeruser.
Had a serious "oh shit" moment opening this beer. After he took off the cap, we could see foam coming up around the side of the cork. Oh shit... But upon removing the cork, there was delayed reaction gushing. Luckily almost all made it into our glasses, and the head settled to a 1cm crown for the duration of the experience. Very impressive, but no lace. The color was amazing. Striking deep purplish body with an almost sickly pink and purple head. Smelled like typical Cantillon funk/vinegar with blueberry, blackberry, and old shit thrown in. Yeah.
This is the first blueberry beer I've ever had where I could taste the blueberry enough to truly identify and appreciate it.
Not nearly as sour or acidic as I had expected. Classic Gueze, Kriek, and Gambrinus were more sour to me. Started out tart, and transitioned to blueberry on the finish. At least at first. Halfway through my glass, essence of citrus, earth, grapes, blueberries, and funk weaved themselves together with no regard for my dumb ass trying to keep up with it. Unbelievable complexity. Medium mouthfeel, carbonation kind of reminds your tongue of it's role in life. Smooth finish, somewhat dry, and lingers just enough for you to want another and another.
Truly amazing beer, but not one of a kind. I could (and probably will) give a review very similar to this one to Vigneronne, Classic, and especially St. Lamvinous. It's not miles ahead of any of those. But it is miles ahead of the competition. 1,531 characters7ways, Jan 02, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Shared my bottle with a few fellow BAs the other night. We opened this up last after cracking bottles of Black Tuesday, FW 13 and a few other beers. This was the perfect end to the night and was really a nice contrast to the big brews from earlier in the night.
2009 375ml bottle poured three-ways into champagne flutes.
A: Rich reddish-purple body with a lively, bubbly pink head. Held on for quite some time before receding. Never quite died down though. Nice sticky, spotty lacing.
S: Bold, sweet blueberries. Light funky-tartness. Subtle vinegar undertones.
T: Absolutely incredible. The blueberries here are very refined. In general they give off a slightly sweet character, but are deliciously tart and sour as well. There is a nice lambic acidity that contributes an earthy, vinegar funk to round out this delightful beverage.
M: Light bodied with a nice effervescent, yet restrained carbonation level. Smooth with a nice crisp dry finish. The only knock on this here is the blueberry sludge, which I am assuming is left over blueberry skins which settled into the last sip of the glass. Slightly off putting, but a marginal flaw at most.
D: Out of this world. This really was a treat. To cap off the tasting with this was a superb decision. Now I just have to find more ammo to get more of this! 1,309 characterscallmemickey, Jan 01, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to FooFaa for saving this bottle for a special occasion and sharing on 12/30/09.
A - Poured an opaque, deep violet-colored body with light pinkish head that retained very well, leaving behind some foamy lace, which stuck to the sides of the flute.
S - Tart blueberry character with a hint of fruity sweetness, a subtle band-aid character and spicy notes. There's also plenty of wood and oaky tannins, giving the aroma a hint of astringency. 
T - Initial flavor is indeed quite tart (as the aroma had forewarned) with a subtle band-aid character and some spicy notes. A very slight fruity sweetness manages to overcome the intense sourness, but is gone just as quickly as it appears. Finishes with lots of woody astringency.
M - Medium bodied with a warm mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Prepare for your palate to be doused with a wash of astringency, resulting in a major pucker fest. 
D - Definitely one of the most drinkable Cantillon beers, I found this to be not as brash as some of the others I've had in the past, probably due to the addition of the blueberries. While this was still quite sour, it also had a slight sweet character and plenty of woody notes to quell the intense tartness, even if only slightly. 1,234 charactersffejherb, Dec 31, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 vintage, 375 ml bottle.
Pours hazy red, the colour reminds me of cranberry juice with slightly effervescent head that fades almost immediately, it looks quite attractive. Aroma seems to be intense vinegary with some wild fruit in the background.
Taste is crazy tartness, I think I have never tasted anything like that. Flavour certainly has got more fruity feeling than smell. Medium-dry finish; mouthfeel is light with light carbonation, excellent drinkability.
Although I liked the beer I can not say it was amazing. Mostly because I did not feel those blueberries I expected neither in smell, neither in taste, if they were there it was certainly too subtle. 669 charactersatis, Dec 31, 2009
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a tulip. So excited to try this one. 2009 vintage. Thanks, John.
The cork almost popped off by itself. Wow, crazy pour. A beautiful purple color with a huge pink head, which dissipates fairly quickly but never fully. Massively carbonated. This is the nicest lambic I've ever seen.
The smell is exquisite. The usual Cantillon musty, funky, old attic aromas combine with rich, plump blueberries in a perfect melange. I could just smell this beer for hours. But then I wouldn't be drinking it, would I? So here we go...
This does not disappoint. I was somewhat concerned that after the buildup in my head about this beer, that a letdown would be inevitable. Nope. A straight blast of sourness and funk, followed by the tiniest bit of sweetness accompanying the blueberry rush mid-palate. Some wood component throughout. There might be a tiny hint of citrus zest in there as well. The finish is nicely sharp, and quite dry.
Mouthfeel is excellent. Relatively light-bodied, lively carbonation, dry finish.
Let's just say that I would drink copious amounts of this every day for the rest of my life if I had any more of this beer. Man oh man, what a beer... 1,184 charactersdavod23, Dec 06, 2009
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750mL bottle, 2009 vintage, corked and capped. Upon removing the cork a steady stream of pink foam slowly rose to the opening, threatening to slowly make a mess if I didn't pour my first glass. After the pour, the foam in the bottle is about 3/4 inch thick above the liquid, and I can see some dark purple sediment attached to the walls on the bottle.
The beer is reddish-purple color with a light pink head. Kind of murky and impossible to see through, it looks really substantial. The aroma is, in a word, perfect. I expected an intense sour tartness and blueberries, but this was not so 2-dimensional as that. All of the funk you expect from Cantillon, this smelled like I imagine the attic at the brewery smells, musty and dusty, some leather, old barn, you name it. And throughout it all is the essence of blueberries, not like a fruit juice was added a la Lindemans, more like the yeasts fed on fresh blueberries and pissed out blueberry notes along with the funk. The combination of these aromas makes a 3rd distinct creation, just a perfect blend of all things good. I could keep smelling this forever, in fact I'm spending more time smelling this beer than drinking it. So...
The taste is also perfect. I don't like to give 5's so easily but really this is so excellent. The blueberries are there but don't define the flavor, this is more about the lambic and what the blueberries can ADD to it. Definitely the blueberries don't temper the funk with sweet notes, this is still a sour beer. But, on the other hand, maybe they do temper it somewhat as this is perhaps the least tart Cantillon I've tried. Either that or I've built up a natural immunity to bracingly tart beers... I've read others' reviews where they can get oak flavors from these lambics, and I'm sure those flavors are there due to the long aging in barrels, but I have a hard time discerning these flavors in the midst of all the aggressive and defining Belgian wild notes. In any case, this is supremely complex, delicious, and again reminiscent of a dusty, cobwebby attic. In a very good way.
The body and drinkability are perfect scores as well, I'm just gonna go ahead and give all 5's. After 1140 or so reviews it's becoming rare for me to feel a beer deserves a perfect score but this is no ordinary beer. I'm becoming sad but sated as the bottle empties, like a glutton I drank the whole thing. I offered some to my wife but, validating that the sour tartness is indeed becoming undetectable to me in these beers, she shied away from the wild notes. 2,536 charactersTurdFurgison, Nov 15, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage (batch 4)
A: A hazy reddish pink color with a small pink head that settles fairly quickly and leaves a ring of lacings. 
S: The first thing to appear is Cantillon's funky house character of hay, earth and a hint of vinegar. Then, the fruit aromas appear - both tart green apples and ripe (almost overripe and fermenting) red apples, and fragile yet prominent notes of blueberries. Everything feels very rustic and genuine, no artificial fruit flavors in sight. Being a fruit lambic from Cantillon, the smell is very balanced and sober, not even close to harsh.
T: A flawless balance between tartness and sweetness, and again this beer feels relatively balanced and tidy. The sourness isn't as puckering as in some other beers from Cantillon. Instead it showcases an amazingly balanced complexity. The mild sweetness has a pleasant fruit character. Lots of aromas of apples, lemon peel and goose berries. Lots of blueberry flavors - but they are not overly prominent. At first, the blueberries has a somewhat sweet character and really give the beer a unique overall character. But here's lots of tartness going on which levels the sweetness, and in general the beer is quite sour. Hints of vinegar and lactic acid. Pleasant funky notes of wet hay, earth and brett. Hints of wheat. The finish has a very subtle grassy bitterness to it and nice oak barrel flavors. Hints of tart blueberries, minerals and funk lingers on in the mouth.
M: Moderate body and sparkling carbonation. Feels like a sparkling white wine in the mouth, but unfortunately the carbonation is slightly too exaggerated and it gets somewhat inharmonious. Dry finish.
D: A unique and really good beer. But some aspects of it aren't as great as the overall character. It doesn't showcase the same "in your face-attitude" as some other beers from Cantillon. Instead, as noted above, it's really well balanced and very complex. Despite its few kinks, a masterpiece.

Some brief notes about batch 5, released in the fall of 2009:
The same lovely color as batch 4. The smell is also very similar to the older batch, perhaps the blueberry aromas are slightly more prominent. The big difference lies in the mouthfeel and in the way the blueberries appear in the taste. The blueberries are slightly more pronounced, especially in the finish were they are very noticeable (and very tasty with a genuine and rustic character). This gives the beer a slightly new expression and I really enjoyed it. The level of carbonation is somewhat lower in this batch and the beers seems a little smoother. All in all, it's still a great beer.

Batch 2 - 2007 - 375ml
A - Wow, I've never seen a beer this color... As I pour this deep purple lambic almost 2 fingers of pink stained tan head rises and settles after a few seconds.
S - The second I started pouring this I could smell the blueberries. When you're nose deep in the glass there is a strong acidity and a nice healthy funk, lovely barnyard and cheese.
T - Frickin' awesome. Not the sourest Cantillon I've had, but definitely packs a punch. It blend very well with the funk going on as well. The blueberries are also the most present out of Cantillon fruit lambic that I've had. It might just be in my head but I swear the blueberries also add to the sourness, as if they were picked early.
M/D - This one was carbonated pretty well and probably one of the only things I could find I didn't like about, and I was trying pretty hard. 
Rarity and price aside, I could drink this any day of the year, I would just need 30 minutes to lose myself in it.
Batch 4 - 2009 - 750mL
This is a pure funk bomb, tastes like a blueberry flavored band-aid. Fruit wasn't as present as I remembered, and this bottle was fresher... Too medicinal, I'm going to knock my appearance down to account for the difference in batches. 1,294 charactersxpimptastikx, Oct 30, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5a- 2009 375ml pours a hazy dark red/purple with champagne like carbonation. About half an inch of bubbly head with a less then vigorous pour.
s- Some blueberry fruit sweetness and sour cherry with a little bit of lemon in the background.
t- Not nearly as sweet as I expected it to be. The berries linger and really come out in the aftertaste, but for the most part it is a very tart fresh blueberry flavor up front that sticks around and slowly fades. A little citrus lemon sourness as well.
m- At first it was almost over carbonated and hard to drink and get any flavor to compete with the mouth burning bubbles, but as it warmed up it became much better.
d- After the carbonation subsided and i got used to the sour flavors, it became very drinkable. Overall a great sour, but not my favorite Cantillon. A big thanks to Adam and Mike for getting me this.
EDIT: Recently tried a batch 6 and it was MUCH better. Red pour with pinkish head, strong blueberry smell, some lemon. Very sour, sour blueberries, musky cologne, farmhouse funk, grainy blueberry seeds. A tart medium body with a medium carbonation. Very drinkable. 1,122 charactersnkersten, Oct 22, 2009

Vigorour head formed, vibrant pint color that receeded quickly and left a full ring on the edge. The nose was very tart, earthy and a bit of exotic fruit. The taste...tart, tart, tart! Don't get me wrong, the taste is excellent. The blueberry notes are strong, fresh and wonderful. There is also some citrus and pepper on the tongue. If you take a look at the label, the face tells you the story of this beer. Tart yet wonderful. Well worth the effort to get it. 580 charactersggaughan, Oct 10, 2009
4.76/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks Drewmrprs for the bottle. Review #1000. This will be a day long remembered. 
It has been an interesting two and a half years here on beeradvocate.com. The reviews and tastings mounted up, though sometimes it seemed like the more I tried to tighten my grip, the more rare beers slipped through my fingers. I've enjoyed many great brews, benefited from teeming throngs of generous BA'ers trading stuff my way, and subjected my recalcitrant liver to too many mornings in which I'd wished I had perhaps only knocked out one review the night before. What a ride it has been.
The Blabaer Lambik seemed like a fitting choice for review 1000. I've always wanted to try it, the buzz about it is overwhelmingly positive, and I'd like to think that my acid, tart contributions to the message board vibe perfectly with what I expected the beer to taste like. 
Pours a deep purplish pink. Very unique color. When held to light, has more of a ruby-ish, glowing haze look to it. The streams coming from the bottom look like the finest champagne. Something I imagine Christopher Walken offering to a lady he's trying to romance. Absolutely perfect frothy white/pink head, maybe half an inch, and it stayed half an inch for most of the bottle.
Smells ... tart. Whoa. I should have known not to expect a Lindemans abomination, but I perhaps did not expect this much puckering of my nether regions. There's a hint of berries ... they kind of smell blue ... but there's also a ton of funk notes, oak, and ... I don't know, is that the sad distilled essence of slaughtered dryads? I can't be sure. While it's a nice aroma, it may, perhaps, be the least appealing thing about the beer ... which tells you how phenomenal the rest is. 
Taste. is. fantastic. The berries are much more noticeable in the flavor, but no hint of sweetness in this bone dry, tart, acidic beast. Well, maybe just a tad, after you've been through half a bottle and your sour taste buds have raised the white flag and gone home to France. Bursting, unripe but still flavorful-ly sour blueberries, a crazy oak background that seems like they tossed the entire tree in, and a nice leathery tannin texture that adds an extra dimension. Let it linger on your tongue and it keeps evolving. Did I mention this was sour? It's crazy sour. In the immortal words of Governor Jesse Ventura: "THIS STUFF WILL MAKE YOU A SEXUAL TYRANNOSAURUS, LIKE ME!" 
Perfect mouthfeel. For such a sour beer, excellent drinkability. Sadly, though, it is over all too soon. Just as the mountains erode into pebbles of dirt, and we all eventually succumb the creeping inevitability of death, so too did I guzzle my sole bottle of Blabaer Lambik down my gullet. 2,695 charactersOverlord, Oct 02, 2009

4.88/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 375ml consumed 9/13/09
Appearance: Big pink, frothy head, the beer itself is a velvet-purple satin.
Smell: I just didn't get the blueberries I was expecting. The ones I found were very mellow, not fresh. Outside of that, it was perfect. A very strong acidity, with a welcome funk element of leather, wet wood, earth, etc.
Taste: Extremely similar to the bouquet, very faint/mellow blueberries with a bracing acidity and an excellent funk element. This one is incredibly sour, but everything is so balanced.
Mouthfeel: It isn't heavy, but an incredible amount of tannins from the blueberries cause this one to coat the full mouth. Definitely a teeth/limps stainer as well.
Drinkability: This one disappeared.
*NB: This is hands down the best lambic I have ever tasted in my life. Because I found the blueberries to be a bit subdued, I have adjusted the Smell down .5 (should be .25 really). This is the only thing keeping me from giving all fives. 957 characterscraytonic, Sep 14, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to ricke! 375 mL corked bottle poured into my favorite lambic glass (11 oz pilsner). 2009 vintage. Careful, it's a countertop stainer and a foamer!
Blueberry bits are all over this beer, and all over the cork. Inside of the cork is lavender and slimy looking, but remains intact and isn't actually rotten (thankfully). Pours with a big blueberry head, complete with small pieces of blueberry (invoking a homebrew of some sort).
Wild smell. Notes of blueberries are dominant, also sulphur compounds, old stale urine, gueuze, lots of pediococcus, wild yeast with off notes that would be a drainpour with a regular beer but it's beautiful here. I wouldn't enjoy it if I hadn't had wild ales before though...
Flavors are of tart blueberries. Wild lambic flavors are abound; this is the tamest Cantillon I've had, yet it's still probably a bit too weird for anyone who's unfamiliar with what to expect. Some mild oak notes. I've changed my score up from a 4.0 because I'm getting to like it more and more as it warms. Finishes sweet and tart with a medicinal blueberry fume.
A vigorous pour resulted in a mildly carbonated beer with a huge stable head. It's sticky and sweet but that doesn't bring the mouthfeel down one bit.
The more it warms the more I can't help gulp it down. I didn't quite like it when I first poured it but it came alive after about 10 minutes. Great stuff! 1,387 charactersrayjay, Sep 10, 2009

Huge thanks to Alex (MasterSki) for opening this one at our wild/sour tasting. 2009 Batch 4, poured from 375ml bottle into Bell's Tulip.
A - Pours purple/dark blue with a pink fluffy head. Lots of sticky lacing is left behind once the head dies down a bit. The look of this beer is unlike anything I've ever seen...something to be seen, no doubt about it!
S - Blueberry funk/tart, mellow sweetness, and light acidic notes. It's hard to put into words the perfection of this blueberry lambic, so pardon me if I just comment how awesome it is by saying, "it's awesome".
T - Well, what do you think it tastes like? Uh...blueberries? Yeah, I'd say so. Sweet blueberries, sour blueberries, funky blueberries. However you'd like your blueberries, this lambic dishes it out. A nice acidic bite but nothing too strong. This one stays pretty mellow when compared to the nose.
M - Light, nice fizzy carbonation that cover the palate well. This is a great beer to swish around on your mouth and enjoy slowly. A nice rich finish, that I really enjoy.
D - So easy to drink, I already want another all to myself! 1,117 charactersSean9689, Sep 02, 2009

A: Pours a very deep, brillant ruby. Decent sized champagne like head that holds nicely, cottoncandy pink. Lays to a fine but thick head. Some lacing.
S: Great fruity aroma and lots of Cantillon funk. Smells closer to raspberry than blueberry. Great funk, loads of complexity.
T/M: Amazing funk, not abrassive but tasty and complex. Great sour and tart fruits but still controlled. Distinct blueberry doesn't come out until the swallow and aftertaste. The funk is big and cheesy with all the nice horsey, barnyard, musky flavors. Body is about medium and carbonation is nicely elevated. Finishes with that great dryness.
D: very crushable. 5% and extremely refreshing. 819 characterspwoods, Aug 27, 2009

Pours a bright, almost purple to blood red with cloudiness and some larger sized yeast chunkies that were resting on the bottom. There's an aggressive, highly foamy rich, medium pink head above.
I get straight up funk on this one with no hints of blueberries. The funk is great.... Nasty and sour yet very inviting. The smell is rigid - strong and plentiful. Big ol' nose.
Taste is much like the nose. Lots of funk with high carbonation. Medium bodied over. At first, I was a bit upset because I didn't get the blueberry aroma I was expecting, but after swallowing and allowing the flavor to waft to my nose, I got the berry essence. The long lasting flavor that retained in my mouth is sour with fresh berries....
This beer is VERY easy to drink and enjoyable. There's big flavor, lots of sour all trailed by a nice berry flavor. Wow... 1,030 charactersbeachbum1975, Aug 27, 2009

Blueberry, some funk, tart acidic character, and a touch more blueberry. I could just smell this all night. Medium light mouthfeel with a lot of carbonation. Flavor had blueberry, tart acid, funk, and had a nice balance between the fruit and the funk. The blueberry flavor was a little subdued on the taste. Otherwise this has got to be one of my favorites. Thanks Brad for sharing this! 482 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 bottle - thanks to eyebrews. Shared with Nanoslug and lagradeer and served in a small taster goblet.
A - Opaque fuschia color with quick dissolving pinkish foam that settles to a thick ring - not so much in the way of lacing. Typical Cantillon look, but with bonus blueberry chunks at the bottom of the glass.
S - Lots of horsey funkiness, sour unsweetened blueberry juice, blueberry skins, a good amount of graham cracker malt, a touch of vinegar. Excellent blend of sweet, tart, and sour flavors.
T - The taste is very similar to the aroma, with minimal drop-off in depth or complexity in flavor. The aftertaste is pretty clean with some mild residual tartness.
M - Very dry finish, thicker body than I'm used to from a fruit lambic, with lower carbonation in the texture (even though the cork almost exploded out of the bottle).
D - Drinkability is terrific - I wish I had a 750ml bottle as the little tasters were a huge tease. Obviously low ABV, and lower carbonation, and amazing taste and feel conspire for an amazingly drinkable brew. 1,052 charactersMasterSki, Aug 17, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #1000. I can't thank Jan enough for the opportunity to try this rarity, a 375mL bottle, 2007 vintage.
The cork came out with an impressive pop. Pours a gorgeous hazy purplish red with a fizzy lavender head that recedes fairly quickly but does hang around as a cap for the duration. Lacing is spotty.
The aroma is very interesting and the blueberries were evident right as I popped the cork and they seemed fairly sweet and sugary. However, once in the glass the aroma become much more pungent and trademark Cantillon. It's got the strong tart blueberries, a strong vinegar acidity and a healthy dose of funk. A strong, complex and overall stunning nose.
The taste is more of the same with a strong vinegar presence up front with the blueberries coming in on the tart side of things. There is a faint sweetness in there, but not nearly as sweet as that initial blueberry smell in the nose. The finish is dry with lots of funk and lots of tart fruit.
The mouthfeel is spritzy with lots of carbonation and very dry and funky on the palate.
Well, I've certainly been looking forward to this one and it didn't disappoint. It's got lots of funk and vinegar but it's much more balanced (for me) than some of the other Cantillons I've had. Wonderfully balanced and deserving of the praise. 1,293 charactersgford217, Aug 15, 2009
3.78/5  rDev -16.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Separate '05 & '07 bottles shared under the admissions tent lights at BCTC late on Saturday. Too many spitters & not enough swallowers, as there was still some left once they were passed around & most of us turned in. In comes the late-night lush that is moi to make sure nothing goes to waste. :)
Double-fisting & always prepared, one comes out a rusty, yellow brown & not very pretty. The second, prettier. A cherry stained purple, with a dusty blue head.
A sour lemon yogurt-sort of smell carries off the top of the older bottle, while the newer brings just mainly boxed, dusty blueberries.
Taste was big in both directions. Not a real fan of exhibit A, as it was too much cheese & vinegar, & too little fruit. Fruit pits if you want to be picky, minerally, with a regurgitated stomach acid/gueuze sort of burn. Not exactly knocking it, just a little disappointed. It was a decently pungent Cantillon, but that's not exactly what I came for. The 07 was quite tasty though, though probably less complex. Super earthy & upfront blueberries, strong wheaty presence, barrel, & just a bit cidery on the end. Neither quite tannic, but the big fruit in the fresher bottle sold me.
Both times, a little too frothy. B was thicker, more rustic then A. A puckered me up plenty, B while slighter, still had me clenching some.
Sad to say that, however uneven, this score is a blend.
Quite a pleasure to have been its receptacle. :P 1,427 charactersPEBKAC, Aug 10, 2009

4.88/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to drseamus for sharing. 2007 bottle by way of gregc.
A: Super dark reddish purple color. The purplish head was really nice looking but it quickly retreated to a thin cover on the beer. There were chunks of blueberries in the bottom of the glass.
S: Blueberries right up front. This beer had an incredible balance between tartness and vinegar. Both were quite intense.
T: Intense tartness right up front. This beer pushed my glands about as far as they go. Insanely tart. The blueberry goes so well with the tart insanity. The vinegar/lacto is there and strong but it balances out all of the tartness. Perfectly balanced.
M: Just amazing. A touch dry in the finish. Gland crushing tartness as part of the mouthfeel.
D: One of the best beers I have ever had. Simply amazing. Even with the insane rarity this is still a 5. 832 charactersaerozeppl, Jul 08, 2009

I was incredibly worried initially. The cap was wet with purple liquid and the cork started pushing itself out. I almost crapped my pants. Everything was all good though as he first sniff indicated. 
A: Dark red very opaque. Tons of visible carbonation with chuncks if yeast and blueberries at the bottom. Dark pink head.
S: 50% sour funk, 50% vinegar, 50% blueberry. That's How intense it is. I must drink it now
T: Absolutely perfect. Rarely do I meet a beer as sour as I desire. This makes the cut. Amazing tartness up front that is exactly where I need it which fades into great blueberry. Truly an amazing beer. 
M: Dead on for a wild ale. Nice and thin but with some body from the funk. 
D: I hate to rate hyped beers high but this beer demands it. I've never been disappointed by Cantillon but this exceeds even their high standards. Truly a world class beer if I've ever tasted one. 926 charactersdrseamus, Jun 27, 2009

A: Pours a nice deep berry red with a fizzy head with a pink tinge. Little retention and no lace.
S: Nice funky sour aroma. The berries are there but they are of the sour sort. 
T: Nice and acidic up front. The berries come out in the middle. They are in fact sour like early season strawberries with a blast of under ripe blueberries. Hints of citrus peek through along with the funky tartness found in all Cantillions.
M: Rather light to be honest, zippy carbonation.
D: Very good for the style. I usually don't find Cantillion to be real drinkable this one is. 669 characterstpd975, Jun 27, 2009

375 ml. corked bottle poured into a tulip. 2009 vintage.
A very slow gusher, and by slow, I mean younger35 slow. Pours a deep purple body, almost black, with a quick dark pink three finger head that falls quickly to a foamy layer of goodness which lasts throughout. Minimal lacing, but still a beautiful brew with amazing colors. Aroma is packed with dark berries; blueberries, blackberries, and some red grapes as well. Underneath the berries is some funky hay and vinegar, but not overpowering. Taste starts with the sweet blueberries again but is quickly followed by a balancing tartness. Midway the horse blanket and grassy flavors emerge and dry up the mouth. Aftertaste consists of citrus zest, elderberries, and some earthy flavors. Love. This baby has a lot of life on the tongue as well. Fluffy, bubbly, and crisp...an absolute delight. Too easy to drink, total beergasm...I really need more. Thanks so much Joey! 968 charactersBeerTruth, Jun 20, 2009

Cantillon Blabaer, 750ml bottle, 2009 vintage.
Uncorked and poured into a delicate Cantillon goblet. A very lively pour, but caught 100% of the mini-gush straight into the glass!
An amazing thick foamy pinky white head formed, with small, medium, large bubbles all holding firm above the dark purple brew itself. Absolutely fantastic appearance, and halfway through I noticed a head in the bottle as well.
Taste, as others have said, has the dark fruit dominating the typical Cantillon sour character of the beer, so this Blabaer was definitely less sour than the Kriek or St. Lamvinus etc. A perfect balance of fruit and sour. Tasted more like bluberries than blueberries, so no confusion there! 
Mouthfeel was one of prickly carbonation through a creamy brew. This was one of the most special beers I have ever tasted, in fact, the head, carbonation and mouthfeel aspects were all like a fruit lambic version of the best Westy 12.
Hats of to Jeppe at Olbutikken and, of course, Cantillon themselves for creating a masterpiece.
A stunner in Cantillon's stable of world class beers. If lambics are your thing then you must try to search this one out. The best fruit lambic I have tasted. 1,271 charactersHabanero58, Jun 19, 2009

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opened this bottle up at my girlfriends medical school graduation party. Shared with a few friends, served around cellar tempature. This was the 4th great sour of the afternoon...we started off with some bullfrog el rojo, next was the veritas 003, followed by some russian river deviation and to end the night a 750ml bottle of 2007 Blabaer. 
Cap was a bit rusty and smelled like rotting fish...cork was in perfect condition. Upon opening a beautiful stream of white foam with purple tints began to creep its way out of the bottle.
The beer pours a deep purple color with a white/pinkish head. 
Aroma was the most increadable thing i have ever put my nose too. The first thing i notice are the danish blueberries. Its like im smelling fresh blueberries at the local farmers market in the height of their season. This is followed by a subtle funk. Some sour green apples, lemons, cocoa and as it warms a bit it begins to smell exactly like blueberry pancakes. Taste was supurb. A nice blueberry sweetness without being too overpowering, followed by the same blueberry flavor but this time they are very tart. Sour fruits galore in this one, just layers of complexity dancing over your tounge. A nice acetic feel with a bit of wet hay in the mix. The mouthfeel of this lambic is the best i have ever had. Nice smooth carbonation very creamy and goes down better and nicer then anything. 
The drinkability of this beer is outstanding. Its so flavorful and nice i could drink this all night. 
This is the most increadable lambic i have had the pleasure of drinking. If you are able to get your hands on a bottle, it will be a wonderful experience. 1,645 charactersgregc, May 26, 2009
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Don't care. This is going to be a touch one. As I said to Joey on the phone last night, "It has no flaws". I was thrilled beyond words to finally acquire this gem. I had been searching and searching for what seemed like forever before I could finally track one down. Alas, it has happened. Served at cellar temp and poured into a large snifter, 2009 vintage 375 ml bottle, this gem was consumed on 05/22/2009.
The pour was utterly mesmerizing. The rich, purple color was second to none. It looked like what they squeezed out of that girl on Willy Wonka. Just the darkest color I could have imagined with a nice head of purple and pink reach up over the top and cling to the sides of the glass forever. Lots of purple sludge coating the glass as the session ended up, this was too good to be true. As I reach in and take a deep breath, I fall back into my chair, suddenly oblivious to the world around me. I sink further in, falling down the rabbit hole of sweet, succulent blueberry. So rich, so well defined so complex, surreal. Layer upon layer of fruit just overwhelms the senses. I have had many a fruit Lambics and all seem to be intensely sour, or laden with oak, such that you never really get to experience the true complexity, the true flavor of the underlying fruit is lost. This however was the expression of everything I have wanted in a Lambics. Just so rich and smooth, I had everything I could do to not drink the whole glass in two gulps. It was like some sick and twisted dream I was in. So, several minutes later as I finishing mumbling to myself and my wife pummels me to shut up about this thing, I sit here and write this.
For those of you in doubt about whether this is worth seeking out I hope I can be of some assistance. You have to, you owe it to yourself. It was unlike anything else I have ever drank. This being the 3rd or 4tth batch of this beer, from what I have heard, the first was too sweet, the second too tart. I think the problem here may be age. This really needs to be consumed fresh. The flavor is soo ripe now, so mind blowing perfect it is hard to put into words. I have lost myself in the hobby again thanks to this bottle. Thank you Cantillon. Thank You. 2,206 charactersmikesgroove, May 23, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to my buddy Joey for sharing this one! Had this one at La Bella on 5-16-09 along with Tony, Danny, Jeff, and a few others. Hope you enjoyed this one Tony!
I was planning on drinking this for my 500th review but it crossed my path a little sooner, or I just didn't drink/review fast enough. The first time I had this beer was at the RateBeer Summer Gathering 2008, the Grand Tasting at Pizza Port Carlsbad. I only had about a 1oz sample and that was enough to make an impression on me and I've been hunting this one since then...fortunately a very generous trader worked out a trade with me and I was able to get a bottle (thanks jasonm, I will be enjoying that bottle soon).
The first time I tried this last summer (only a 1oz pour though) I thought the sourness and fruit were more balanced, maybe because it was fresher? Here goes...
From a 750ml bottle, 2007 vintage (batch II).
Poured a garnet and violet color, a little haziness, and an attractive pinkish quarter inch of foam.
Funky and tart blueberries assault the nostrils, lots of acidity, and lemon tartness. A bit of tea-like herbalness, lots of wet leather aromas, and musty as it warmed up. This beer was a battle of funk and fruit, both were very intense...the blueberries really make this beer outstanding.
Just like in the aroma, brett funk, hay, sour blueberries, very acidic going down, leather, and acidic lemon. It was almost like biting into a really sour lemon peel. The beer gets dryer with every sip. Again, the fruit flavor is just outstanding and doesn't overpower the beer. At some points it seems like there is some sweetness at the beginning but then the sourness and dryness wrecks the palate. Medium-high carbonation and a bit prickly on the tongue at first.
One of the best sours and truly one of the great Cantillon beers out there. Can't wait to have this again. 1,865 charactersseaoflament, May 18, 2009

Pours a light to medium burgundy with slight white head! Has a pleasant tart funky barnyard aroma with a touch of blueberry maybe a little cranberry in the background. Gotta love this soft tart blueberry zest; just enough to cause the lips to smack with delight. Much less acidic and sour than some other Cantillon fruit Lambics though. The mouth feel was pleasant with some carbonation along with a perfect balance of Blueberry tartness/acidity. This is definitely one of the best fruit Lambics on the market today. Thanks Jeppe for supplying all those tasty blueberries to create such a great brew. 719 charactersygtbsm94, Mar 12, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #500. Wow! When I started reviewing a little more than a year back, I never thought I'd get to try many of the beers that I have. This is one of them and thanks are due to Brad for hooking me up. 2007 release, batch 1 (375ml bottle, black foil)
A: As with some Cantillon beers, there's gunk under the cap. Halfway through uncorking it, the carbonation forces it out. Not bad. In my Duvel tulip, Blåbær sits a pinkish shade of crimson with a light pink head that starts off pretty big and settles to a surprisingly thick disk. Plenty of visible carbonation. No blueberry skins, though :-(
S: Strong funk with barnyard, wet hay and lemon, upon which sits the most delicate of blueberry aromas. The fruit aroma is pretty intoxicating - it's soft, beautiful and reminds me of unsweetened blueberry syrup. No sugar-based sweetness is present, just a pure fruit aroma. 
T: Opens up rather bracingly sour with a ton of lemon-like sourness and acidity that really stimulates the palate. Once the funk washes away, the blueberry comes in. Soft, like on the nose, the berry character comes through with the fruitiness being expressed beautifully, while the sourness continues where the funk left off. Finishes dry, tart and long with a little bit of fruit
M: Light and spritzy on the palate with perfect carbonation, this one is pretty awesome. Acidity is a little high (think along the lines of their Kriek) but fits in well in the overall scheme of things. Great finish
D: I'm definitely enjoying this a lot, it's pretty darned easy to drink
Notes: I had a chance to try the second release from 2007 (75cl bottles, gold foil) and that batch is far superior. The funk is more restrained, the brightness of the blueberries is incredible and the palate is quite to die for. I'd give that version scores of 4/5/5/5/5 but since I got only 2oz of that (thanks, Carl!), I'm not going to review that 1,898 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 04, 2009

 Two finger head on top of a purple haze colored effervescent body. Hints of blueberry and a silky mouthfeel, perhaps too silky for the style. Little to no hop presence. Typical tartness for a cantillon and a blueberry finish make a wonderful lambic. Best fruit lambic i've had to date. Enough horseblanket to make me remember it.

Served in a stemmed wine glass. Deep and vibrant blueish purple color that is just magic. Frothy, creamy foam that sizzles with a lively crackle.
Strong aroma of wet hay, like morning dew on a hay bale. Wild barn stall notes with an underlying fruity scent of the Danish blueberries. Tartness is perceptible in the nose, but it's very mellow and integrated. 
Luscious berry flavor, a very savory feel, with a moderate level of sour. Not too sharp or acidic, it's vinous and just about perfect. Nice level of carbonation that gives it lightness without any distraction. Just a fantastic complex lambic that really showcases the blueberries. 744 charactersemerge077, Oct 13, 2008
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 vintage, 750ml bottle received in a trade from pepsican. Thanks!
Appearance: This one started to foam up as soon as the cork was removed. A gentle pour left me with a hazy blueish-purple liquid with a big pink-hued head. Lots of visible carbonation and great head retention, with chunks of blueberry skin visible in the foam.
Smell: The aroma is an unbelievable melange of sweet, ripe blueberries and Cantillon's signature farmhouse funk. The fruit's fresh, ripe smell has held up remarkably well here.
Taste & mouthfeel: Fruity up front, the unmistakable taste of blueberries shining through above even the puckering sourness. There's plenty of sourness here as well, though it's not as abrasive as some Cantillon beers. There's no sweetness, no malt to speak of; it's tart blueberries from start to finish. The bugs provide lots of depth to the flavor, but there's no distinct funkiness, as the fruit really does overpower almost everything else. The finish is dry but not overly sour or acidic, making this one of the easiest drinking lambics I've had. 1,063 characterslargadeer, Sep 20, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Vintage 2007; Sampled April 2008
Pours with a frothy, initially two-finger thick, purple-pink stained tan colored head. The beer is a deep purple color, but shows a deeply hazy, plum-red color when held up to the light. As I was pouring this beer a scent of blueberries was noticeable. A closer inspection is much more accented towards the funky Lambic notes; lots of funky, phenolic, bandaid like aromatics, a definite acidity, ample butyric acid notes, musty cotton balls, cured leather, . Behind all of this is a subtle, yet zesty, berry character that is distinctly of sweet-ripe blueberries; the blueberry notes are almost more noticeable in the nose when you are not trying.
Bracingly tart, with a fantastic sourness that almost causes me to pucker. I would swear that the ample sourness is magnified by tart fruit character, though it is mostly lactic in make up. The finish has a mouth-coating tannic character to it that is deeply stained with berry skin flavors. The flavor of this beer is not quite as funky or phenolic as the nose suggested, but this is definitely on the funky side of the spectrum. Light bandaid phenolics, moldy cotton ball notes, . The tannins, fruit and oak contribute a nice heft to the body of this brew though a zippy carbonation keeps this on the airy / light side; overall this is a beer to be quaffed in quantity, just like a Lambic should be.
As the beer warms up it picks up a bit more fullness and the acidity seems to mellow just a touch, becoming a bit more fruit accented, though still bracingly dry and tart. I really like the tannic structure that this beer has, it gives it a texture that is quite akin to the feeling while drinking black tea; this somehow provides some balance to this beer. My second pour seems to get just a touch of ripe-berry character to it, just enough to add an ephemeral touch of sweet fruit character without actually adding any sweetness. This is just getting more and more drinkable, it didn't start out a slouch either, and I am suddenly left wondering what happened to my 750ml bottle & asking myself why I don't have more to drink right now.
Wow, this is supposed to be the less tart / funky of the two vintages; I can't imagine (or is it can't wait) the 2005 vintage I have waiting for me being more sour than this. This is just quite funky right now, this definitely leans towards the hard side & I wonder how much of this has developed since bottling; especially since I see this as being less tart and more fruity than the 2005. This is fairly fruity, but certainly not in a dominant fashion (even by authentic Lambic standards), the fruit seems to more contribute to the tartness and tannic qualities of this beer rather than the ripe berry notes one might expect in a beer described as fruity. After having said all that, this is just a fantastic beer, as someone who really like funky, sour beers and my fruit to be a supporting player, well this just hits the spot quite well. 2,967 charactersGueuzedude, Apr 19, 2008

4.36/5  rDev -3.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2007. Sampled at a private party at GABF.
Poured an amazing hazy purple with a tight pink head.
The aroma was of full brettanomyces barnyard funk, lactic acid, and faint blueberries in the background.
The flavor was moderately tart for a Cantillon beer. It had all the great tight and clean funk that makes Cantillon beers my favorite amongst the sours. The blueberry flavor was very subdued and in the background. The beer had a clean biscuity and wheaty malt backbone (very subtle, but nice).
The carbonation was high and the mouthfeel was light.
This beer was incredibly refreshing, as are all Cantillons, and extremely drinkable.

Smell: That telltale barnyard funky aroma was all wet hay and dirty stables, with a very assertive fruit character that oscillated between raspberries, rhubarb and strawberries.
Taste: Carbonation was not as prickly as other fruit lambic I've tried, and the fruit is definately in the forefront here, and it's all blueberry, but the kind that just a bit unripe, when they're sort of greenish blue. I can't tell you if they were like that when they brewed this, but it certainly worked out extremely well. The acidity seemed somehow separated from the flavor, as if every sip came with two acts, the flavorful rush of fruit flavor, then acidity, that was drying and refreshing - sounds contradictory, but it isn't - but was at a very sustained level, not as massive and brutal as some of the other fruit lambics. It was probably one of the most balanced lambics I've ever sampled. Lord knows people have tried and failed to make good blueberry Beers, but this style seems like a perfect fit. It went down insanely well, and was an absolute orgasmic match with trappist-made chocolate-dipped blueberries I just happened to have (it's the season here in Quebec). This one is a masterpiece. 1,455 charactersGoldorak, Aug 27, 2007
4.76/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a blueberry lambic exclusively brewed for Olbutikken, Copenhagen's best beer store. 
Astounding color. Deep magenta with a super dark pink head, with little pieces of blueberry particles in the head. The beer clearly absorbed the color of the blueberries in a spectacular way. Without question, the best looking Cantillon beer Ive seen. 
The aroma is prehaps the most disappointing aspect of the beer. Its just not nearly as powerful as Id like. That being said, its still nice. 
The flavor is absolutely incredible. Of all the Cantillon beers Ive tried with fruit additions (cherries, raspberries, muscats grapes, red wine grapes, apricots, cranberries) the Danish blueberries in this beer is absolutely the best fruit addition. After the mid-palate, the blueberries become dominant. The fruit tastes lush, authentic and phenomenal. Also, for a Cantillon its not intensely sour like Rose De Gambrinus or Fou Foune, but instead, very well balanced. This is an incredible fruit lambic. 1,013 charactersCrosling, Apr 11, 2007
