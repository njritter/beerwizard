A:	
Pours an almost-clear light honey color with three fingers of clumpy white head that airily settles to a patchy skiff.  Okay retention; spindly lacing. (4)	
S:	
Near-perfect blend of equal parts tropical fruit, crisp malt, dank hops and a little spice.  Guava, citrus pith, pils malt/toast, weed, mango, orange, pine.  (4.5)	
T:	
Similar to the nose with a little bump to the fruity and resinous character of the hops.  Green hops and tropical fruit oils ride on a layer of pilsner with a shellac-ishly hoppy finish.  (4.5)	
M:	
Creamy and luscious with light carbonation and a smooth, lingering hoppy finish. Entirely too drinkable.  (4.75)

This is a hell of a beer!  I can see why they chose the name (and I understand what you meant about it, KC.  Thanks!).  
This is a “West Coast”-looking IPA with a whiff of head and a fruity smell right on popping the can.  The aroma is a delicate balance between everything that a beer like this should be.  The flavor follows suit with a little more oomph.  It feels like drinking velvet.  This is a spectacular beer that is well-worth seeking out.  
It reminds me a lot of SoS (which is high praise coming from me).  I think this because Epiphany features everything that a beer like this should have: fruity, dank, bitter,malty, sweet, dry, and so on, all well-balanced, all where they should be.  Additionally it feels like drinking velvet (which is also one of my favorite things about SoS).  Anyway, they are obviously different beers and no one really cares what I think about it (and that is probably good), but the point is:  this is a flat-out excellent beer.  Just great.

4.04/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4The beer pours the expected hazy orange amber color with good head retention and lacing.  The nose is pretty nice as well, as I get considerable tropical fruit, orange citrus and a hint of dank weed.  The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely, but it wasn't quite as "juicy" as I was expecting (given the aroma profile), and the mouthfeel seemed a bit thin.  Also, while the alcohol was generally well integrated into the flavor profile, there was a bit of a bite on the finish from the noticeable alcohol (which I guess isn't a huge surprise, given the abv. in this beer).  Drinkability is pretty good otherwise, and frankly, I was surprised by the 8% abv. (I would have guessed something in the low 6% range).
Still a pretty nice beer/IPA, but given some of the reviews I saw for this beer, I guess I was expecting a bit more from it. 849 charactersJohn_M, Apr 22, 2017

Aroma is different than typical New England iPas.  I get candied fruit, biscuit, pineapple and peach.    Nice change 
Taste follows the aroma.  Tartness to this beer and very little bitterness.  Bites the tongue like a sweet tart.   The hop combo is very unique and I like it.  
Mouthfeel- light and a little juIcy,  but more of west coast mouthfeel vs east coast. 
Overall-   This is A very solid A-/B plus beer.  But not the same level as swish, dinner or treehouse, trillium beers.  I like this beer a lot though 584 charactersjcflorian, Mar 18, 2017

Very complex aroma, oranges, rooibos tea, grapefruit, sage, peach, spruce, and hints of pineapple, lime, rose, crackey malt, thyme, grass. Very herbal and fruity.
Taste is herbal/flowery over fruity but nicely balanced. Orange rind and tea are dominant, but there's also Tangerine, peach, sage, spruce, roses, berries. Hint of pineapple and thyme, some lime like acidity. Light sweetness but a bold dry bitterness on the finish. 
Light to medium bodied, smooth and sticky, sharp carbonation, drying.
Incredibly complex and balanced IPA. Very unique flavor profile. Perhaps not suited to everyone's tastes but built for mine. Those herbal notes mingling with the fruitiness combine for a totally different IPA experience. 858 charactersHoppy_Time, Mar 13, 2017

Leaves a nice white foamy lacing around the glass upon drinking, with a moderate amount of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. 
Smells: Immediate juicy tropical hops flavor with orange peel, grapefruit, and a dank pungent odor characteristic of a world class double IPA. There is a very sweet citrus smell evident in this beer with lemon peels, around a base of cracker and sweet malt which balances the bite of the hops.
Taste: Immediate juice bomb burst of tropical hops with orange peel, grapefruit, a nice tart dankness which I love in a good double IPA. After the tropical fruit flavors, the malt backbone shines with a nice sweet cracker flavor. The beer finishes with a dry bite you get with a beer of this class. Aftertaste is a tart bitterness, but the bitter that you love. 
Feel: The beer flows nicely over the tongue with moderate carbonation which stings the tongue and spreads all the delicious flavors this beer has to offer. The mouth is left feeling dry and dank.
Overall: This is easily my favorite DIPA in Maine, and you cannot pass this beer up if you're in the Portland area. 1,225 charactersCaleb_Parent, Feb 11, 2017

Overall a really nice beer.  Certainly takes back to the East coast style IPA as opposed to the newer NE style.  This has a nice bitterness to it that combines really well with the grapefruit, orange, and tangerine from the flavoring hops.  A very enjoyable beer that I am glad to finally have tried. 326 charactersrabbott2, Feb 10, 2017

4.26/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Tendency for head when pouring but the bubbles are not dense. From 16oz can into tulip. Most of head dissipates quickly. 
Muted deep golden orange and mostly transparent. Unlike many of the other NE IIPAs these days, with their opaque yellow appearance. 
Nose is some fruit—earthy—and hops. Throw some citrus notes in there as well.  
Sharp feel on the tongue. Good level of carbonation. Balanced feel. 
More piney and bitter than it’s partner, Venture, as well as it’s local competitors like Swish. There is some malt presence, compared to straight hop bombs, and the hop flavor is more resinous and earthy than tropical. Some citrus there as well, but not dominating. Finish is sticky and lasting. 
Overall, a good beer, but not world-class. 756 charactersj_d_b, Dec 09, 2016

4.12/5  rDev -7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Just told my wife I had an epiphany, she looked at me awaiting further commentary but I just walked away leaving her guessing.  This was about 15 minutes ago she's either left wondering, or just assumed it was my randomness coming full force, either way I'm cracking number two, onward and upward.
Look is what you'd expect minus the yeasty globules floating like black pepper flakes suspended in a thick honey.    She's bottled 10/11/16 bought right from the brewery so no age issues.  Didn't look at the first beer, I'm assuming it's being done on purpose and part of an unfiltered beer.   Just less cloudy with less haze and more of a congealed amalgamation of yeast.  Doesn't look great but,....
Smells of fruit cocktail.   Theres pear, peach and some sweetness, perhaps a modicum of pine if you work for it,
Taste is crisper than I'd expect, pretty clean good balance of malt and hops, hops accentuated a little better as it warms.   Not picking up much floral from the Ella or Mosaic, I'm searching, if I imagine it it's there but the fruit and pine notes dominate. 
Mouthfeel is enjoyable, easy drinking and you'd never know you were drinking an 8 ABV beer.
World Class?  Not on this go 'round.   That may sound like a harsh critique but it's honest.   However this beer is very, very good.  High marks for drinkability and hop balance, but not in the pantheon of great DIPAs, not this time at least.  Willing to come back and give it another try. 1,459 charactersMikeyBadnews, Oct 26, 2016

A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a white, foamy, one-inch head with good retention. Thick white lacing throughout.
S: Strong aromas of tropical fruits and citrus including mango, pineapple, peaches, melons, orange, and grapefruit. Mild notes of earthy and piney hops.
T: Mostly notes of grapefruit, tangerine, and orange rind accompanied by piney and resiny bitter hops. Milder tropical fruit notes.
F: Light-medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with good carbonation. Slightly dry.
O: Overall, a great DIPA. Love the fruity nose on this one. Piney hop bitterness balances the fruit characters well. Easy drinking and very tasty! 672 charactersBeerGuy8315, Oct 04, 2016
3.33/5  rDev -24.8%look: 3 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25Semi-hazy amber-orange with a fizzy white head that quickly recedes to a fizzy bubbly ring and then completely dies off, looking not far off from spiced rum.
Slightly dank pine and apricot aromas kick this beer off. A little boozy pear emerges as it warms.
Taste is overripe peach and pine, with a little tang and bitterness.
Feel is thin and fizzy, a little boozy, a bit cocktail-esque. 390 charactersSabtos, Oct 03, 2016

4.31/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, dated 09/12/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic.
Pours a mildly cloudy copper-gold with a scant finger of head. Retention is about a minute, leaving a solid scum and a thick ring of suds around the edge, with minimal lacing.
The nose is faint, fresh straw, oranges and meyer lemons.
Tastes of grapefruit pith and grapefruit juice, limes, spruce and vanilla. After the initial hop onslaught, a smooth caramelly grain body appears, chewy, earthy and dank, and schmeared with pineapple marmalade. Finishes with more grapefruit pith, lemon, pine sap and the slightest alcohol warmth in the gullet.
Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and dry with light-to-medium carbonation.
Overall, juicy and delicious. I'm glad to have had it and am looking forward to having it again. 782 characterspapposilenus, Sep 29, 2016

Lightly hazy amber color.  Not your 'typical' NE type of IPA/DIPA.  This reminded me a lot of the Pipeworks Fish series beers.  Mandarin citrus, lime, and some very light pine resin qualities.  Some mild bitterness at the very end as well after an initial smooth taste. 306 characterseifster82, Sep 17, 2016

Generally being in preference of session ales this beer surprised me and quite frankly scared me. It drinks with a big citrus and floral character in both the taste and the nose while the body is significantly lighter than what would be expected. The body while supplying fair mouth feel is a smooth and light pedestal to display this Hop forward IPA on. 420 charactersdeuce5645, Sep 17, 2016

Aromas of orange rind, dried grass, tangerine, peach, pepper spice, and some floral hops characteristics, too. Very aromatic. Flavors are more tropical fruit forward, with notes of pineapple, melon, and mango joining the orange, grapefruit, and peach, all on a bready backbone. Hops characteristics are still grassy, but with a little more herbal twist to it. Smooth and full bodied, with a fruit cocktail and herbal aftertaste. The finish is light, effervesced, and slightly dry. Good beer. 620 charactersGarthDanielson, Jul 24, 2016

It pours hazy with hues of copper and gold. The nose is very nice with tropical fruit, pine and citrus aromas. The taste is a delicious mango explosion. The mouth is dry yet still juicy. It features a very nice pine bite that balances the flavors exceptionally well. This is definitely a world-class beer that deserves more hype than it gets. 422 charactersCayseyW, Jun 27, 2016

4.17/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Big thanks to @walderek for this Solid, Glorious Maine Offering. My first from Foundation.
Pours a shiny penny with just a hint of haziness. One finger of tiny white bubbled head that retreats to a thin layer. Consistent lacing all the way around.
Smell bursts with a mélange of orange, peach, pine, with a hint of pineapple and malt sweetness.
Taste pumps its fist with a zesty orange peel up front, then moves back in the mouth with some tropical, slightly dry, pineapple and pine. Malt came through for just a moment, then some warmth. Yep, the pineapple and citrus escorts in a bit of what I perceive to be a gentle “heat.” More sips bring the tropical back around to a rounded out pine. Lotta good stuff going on here.
Mouthfeel is spot on. I often prefer a little more heft than style dictates, but this is full enough. And slightly oily on the finish.
Overall, I’d love a keg of this. My birthday is in July. Hook a brother up Foundation. 953 characters2beerdogs, Mar 20, 2016

Aroma: floral, piney, light tropical fruit, pineapple.
Taste:  slightest bitterness up front, citrus and then pine with a long lasting bitter finish, sticky but dry. some fruit in there as well.
Light carbonation.
I find this to be a mix of west coast and north east styles.  Very good.
edit:  call me crazy but I bought a case of this stuff so I had plenty which lasted over a month.  im down to my last 4 pack and just opened one up and it tastes better now than the fresh ones canned a day or two before purchase.
i had to increase my score a bit.  i didn't get much fruity flavor before but it comes through now. 686 characterskalosjakar, Mar 10, 2016

Medium slick mouthfeel.  Very good IPA with great balance and an array of hop flavors. 370 charactersNolaHopHead, Mar 09, 2016

Pours a medium orange hue with a thin white head and great lacing. The smell is first of grapefruit, Caramel, and maybe some cantaloupe, honestly it smells great. The taste is much of the same with the grapefruity flavors dominating at first, but then you taste the sweetness of the grainbill to offset it you can tell there are some oats in the bill it almost taste gritty sweet. The mouthfeel is great, feels like how you would expect a Dipa to feel, thin to moderate with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall a great Maine offering right up there with dinner id expect(have yet to try). 4.5/5 655 charactersanthony23cippy, Feb 28, 2016
4.83/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Look - murky orange in appearance with a nice big fluffy head. A good amount of yeasty botanicals at the bottom which was the only dislike for me.
Smell - hoppy pine and grassy citrus. Not as citrusy as I thought it would be but definitely lives up to other WC NE hops.
Taste - Super hoppy, piney, grassy, pithy yellow grapefruit. This is really a solid DIPA. A little boozy at first which actually mellowed as it warmed in the glass a bit.
Feel - medium with a slight sticky finish.
Overall - a solid WC NE hop bomb. Loved this beer and will have to check out any other offerings they have. 595 charactersMatthewHopHead, Feb 27, 2016

This one pours a golden orange-ish amber, with a small head, and a lot of lacing.
This smells like intense pine, grapefruit rind, orange, and peach.
This is a pretty intense IPA, in the best way. There's a lot of bitterness on the finish, with a huge hoppy and fruity slap up front, grapefruit rind, grass, pinecones, orange, and peachy fruit flavors, wit h a sturdy malt backbone that doesn't interrupt the hop attack.
This is medium bodeid, with a crisp and juicy mouthfeel, and a good amount of carbonation.
This was definitely wonderful and shows that Maine can keep with it's NE hop masters brethren. 655 charactersGreesyFizeek, Feb 15, 2016

Pours a hazy orange. Not as hazy as some of the other New England IPAs.
Smells of hoppy citrus and sweet malt. Not too intense.
Delicious. Citrus up front to a piney earthiness to a caramel/honey malt followed by bitterness. Drinkable as hell. You never really taste the 8% abv. Great flavors.
Softer feel with moderate carbonation. 
A unique brew and a must try. Tasty and smooth. It does leave a chalky bitterness that isn't as pleasant as some of the other big-time DIPAS. I find this beer slightly overrated. Regardless, it's near world class.

Grapefruit and pineapple juice lead the way with oranges, papaya, and apricots. Its hazy and juicy like the New England IPAs, but it nice a really crisp malt backbone that smooths it out without getting too sweet and allows some pine, resin, and earthy bitterness to add a completely different layer to the beer. Top ten IPA for me. Trade for it. 397 charactersdanh53, Jan 07, 2016

Visited the brewery last week, so the beer is very fresh.  look is orange with a two finger head when poured from a 16 oz can into a 20 oz tulip glass.  There is some lacing.  The head disappears to a film that does not cover the entire top of the beer.   The smell is magical orange or tangerine with an added acidic citrus sent.  The taste is orange on the front and citrus (not grapefruit, not lemon, not lime but intense citrus blast on the roof of my mouth).  Feel is smooth and easy.  Overall - one of the best. 541 charactersgonzo000, Dec 31, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A friend had given me a couple of cans of Epiphany and I was quickly hooked. I noted the similarity of it with Lawson's Sip of Sunshine. Being a Vermont resident, Lawson's is somewhat more available to me. But I was intrigued with Epiphany, drove to Portland and grabbed a case. 
Now I had within my possession both beers and decided to pit them against each other. I knew it would be a close call since both rely heavily on Citra hops. What impressed be before the side to side comparison was that Epiphany had this juicy, tangerine quality to it both in aroma and taste. 
So, I taste SOS and once again I was amazed at its taste. Then I tasted E and all I could do was shake my head and say, wow, great beer. Back and forth I went and even sampled both straight from the can as Heady Topper suggests drinking their beer and there is some merit to this with any hoppy beer.
The Citra hop quality makes these two beers so close in all aspects but I must say in the end that, the juiciness of Epiphany brings it across the finish line by a nose. Right now, these two are my favorite beers. I've brewed a clone of SOS that hits at about a 90% to the real thing. Thinking of adding some Cascade and Mosaic to the recipe to see if it gets that juicy quality. But if it doesn't, I'll still be happy with the outcome considering that these two beers are so awesome! 1,362 charactersDiverr69, Dec 26, 2015

A- Very cloudy tap to tulip pour suggesting many dry hops used in the process. A head rises above a finger with thick creamy consistency and good retention ending as a thick belt and blanket atop the brew. Thick pillows of lace as well as sheets.
S- Intense citrus hops off the top instantly reminding me of orange and grapefruit juice, the two starts here. A bed of stone fruits, floral, resin and herbal hops below that with a touch of caramel pale grains.
T- Grapefruit juice is strong with this one and the oranges come out with a fresh juicy feeling of their own. Mango, tangerine, bitter pineapple, slight passionfruit, apricot, peach, floral, herbal and grassy hops saturate the palate joining with the ABV to punch the palate hard. Tiniest bit of pale fruits, bread and crystal grain sweets.
MF- Puffy and creamy consistency to a medium overall body. The carbonation is zesty and on the very high side promoting the creaminess. Unexpected based on the description but it ends quite bitter.
Super grapefruit and orange forward IPA with plenty of fleshy pithy bitterness. This could replace my morning juice if I wasn't paying attention. 1,194 characterscbutova, Dec 19, 2015

O: This is a world class IPA for sure with a soft mouthfeel that masks the maltiness and reinforces the fruitiness on the palate.

4.51/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5It is a hazy orange gold. A soapy, 3 finger egg shell white head. It doesnt have a long retention, but leaves some spotty lacing and leaves a thin layer on top. 
Smells like dank hops and fruit. More hoppy than fruity, but plenty of each. Also a lot of grainy, pilsner like grain. 
A bunch of tropical fruit and pine flavor right off the bat. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and maybe a touch of mango and guava. Just a little spice to it. Some bitterness is balanced out by honey sweet malts. Very smooth. 
Very chewy body. Finish is long with a pineapple-orange jucie aftertaste. A little bit of resin coats the tongue, and the bitterness is low. 
Outstanding beer! 670 charactersWesMantooth, Dec 06, 2015

Served draft in a tulip but left with that metallic taste I get from drinking out of a bottle. Good beer, well crafted, little more dry hop and a different malt profile makes me happy happy though. 291 charactersBerkshireGuerrilla, Nov 20, 2015

S - What an interesting aroma! Extremely strong sticky caramel sweetness. A bready, almost sourdough type smell. Fascinating. 
T - More of that smell! But in taste form! Extremely dry. Sucking the moisture off my tongue. Rich, dark flavor for an IPA. No fruity floral bullshit here. This is dank and rich. Earthy, piney sap. Resin. Onion. Bitter hops on the end pull your face into a pucker as the hop juices settle in the sides of your mouth. About face from the Swish I just drank. Berries come out as the beer warms. 
F - Thick and chewy. Rich. I feel like it should fit this beer perfectly but something seems off. Can't quite pinpoint it. 
O - A scary beer. Tastes and drinks menacingly. I like it! 782 charactersagreenman19, Nov 12, 2015

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a semi clear golden hue with a thin wisp head.
S - Aromas of light tropical notes, faint mango, light pine and and faint grassy spicy. Loads of mosaic.
T - Taste is similar to the nose, fair amount of tropical notes. Nice light pine with a fair amount of earthy notes. 
M - Mouthfeel is light and a bit thin. Alcohol hidden well. 
O - Overall this beer was rather underwhelming.  The mosaic is rather mediocre with it clashing with the tropical notes.

Smell: tropical aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit, pineapple
Taste: very rich continuation of that smell. Slight earthiness; bitter.
Feel: slight citrus bite up front but very smooth throughout.

Well...a few of us tour people stopped at Foundation after Allagash, and we all grabbed a couple of beers. I stated with Moveable Type...kinda staying in the Belgian mood. Then I went to Epiphany.
Wow...and wow again!
Flat out the best IPA I had this trip including Trillium, BBB, Maine and a raft of IPAs at Great Lost Bear later that night. What a special IPA. SO big so floral so juicy so citrus so creamy...so FANTASTIC.
Do not miss a chance to grab one of these. 624 charactersBillRoth, Nov 02, 2015

This beer was so good I had to get a full pour (visited back in the summer so I'm writing this review from memory).
Beautiful citrus fruits, not overly dry or sweet, a really nice double IPA that hits you with great flavor and aroma but remains balanced and doesn't burn out the palate (at least too much haha).
Foundation is a great little brewery with great beer and good vibes.  Not to be glossed over when visiting Allagash or Bissell Brothers. 562 charactersVBWharfRat, Oct 30, 2015

As a pocket of the beer making populous employ the newest and most coveted hops on the planet, their special tropical tang and citrusy bittersweetness evoke thoughts of sherbet and IPA.
Easily confused with orange juice, the heavily hazed amber-orange seems to be freshly squeezed right into the glass. Is creamy foam structure is long and lacy, layering the nose with all things tropical and citrus. Sweetened with honeysuckle, light caramel and fructose- the malt support props up the hops and accents their unique fruity character.
The ale simply blooms over the middle. And as the angel-food malts dissolve on the tongue, the individual hop character comes in waves- Red grapefruit, tangerine, nectarine and a piquant lemony tang morphs into the softer pineapple, passionfruit, apricot and mango medley of exotic tropical fruit. Where fruit roll-up meets IPA, the bitterness pulls from the ale and closes the taste with fresh and fragrant grass clippings, torn pine needle and a tinge of cannabis.
Both creamy and dry, the beer's texture defies what's previously though about maltiness and dryness coexisting in a glass. Smooth and supportive, the medium-bodied beer tightens its taste in finish and packs a lingering sappy bitterness with light alcohol warmth, citrus oil and orange blossoms. 1,400 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 23, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Mckays restaurant in Bar Harbor, Maine.  Poured into a large willy type glass.  Pours a super hazy orange-yellow, with a small head that slowly fades and leaves no lace.  Aroma is huge citrus, with grapefruit and fresh orange juice, along with a very slight dank.  Taste is great, with lots of the same from the aroma, followed by a tiny bit of pine and resin, a sweet middle, and a nicely balanced bitter finish.  Mouth is about perfect, medium body, somewhat dry, clean and refreshing.  Overall, this is up there with Dinner as my favorite IPA from Maine. 567 charactersFFreak, Sep 29, 2015

A: Hazy cloudy yellow with a solid thick head.  If you like your IPAs clear, this one is not for you
S: subtle nose of mostly citrus
T:  An array of citrus with orande, grapefruit, tangerine.  It sweetens a bit when it warms.  Later there are hints of pineapple and candied fruit.Citrus rind flavor in the background.
Mf: no alcohol burn at all in this 8%er.  Sweetness lingers

4.74/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a can filled on 9/9 into a tulip:
Appearance: vibrant orange with a frothy, bubblicious head. Big off-white bubbles and tons of little bubbles rising up the sides of the glass. Somewhat hazy, but clear enough to be visible through the glass.
Aroma: INSANE amount of hop aromatics. Tons of fruity bitterness, like scraping the inside of a grapefruit rind. Some freshly cut grass, but mostly fruity dankness. Incredible smell; not understated at all.
Taste: in line with the smell, with layer upon layer of fruit juice and just a twinge of bitterness. I get little to no malt, which for a DIPA advertised as being a straight up hop bomb, is what I expected. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple......they're all present and tasting delicious.
Feel: Medium-soft body with not a whole lot of carbonation present. Lots of lingering stickiness from the whopping five-hop recipe.
Overall: probably the juiciest beer I've had next to Trillium's Headroom, and probably juicier. I get that this one is out of the box in it's lack of malt and balance, but if you are looking to drink a hop banger of an IPA, it is perfect. 1,121 charactersTheElectricOne, Sep 14, 2015

S-BLAM! if i were to take my nose's word for it then i id believe i just stumbled into some sort of indoor hop farm/smoothie bar.
T- again, BLAM! an absolute explosion.  juice on juice on juice.  buzzword central. peach, clementine, mango, over ripe cantaloupe, orange sherbet.  at the perfect moment a wonderful soft mix of inner grapefruit peel and piney bitterness climbs up the back of the tongue and just chills in your mouth for a while.  absolute juiciest ipa iv ever had ever.  
Feel- just shy of the tree house/trillium cream but not by much.
overall-like the dude a few reviews down, i spent the first couple cans adjusting to the fact that this much juice is possible.  After having a few cans over the last 2 days and really getting to know this beer, i think this is my favorite ipa ever, but who really knows. i also think i like this beer better straight from the can, heady style, but at this point its like choosing between doggy or mish, both have their merits 1,048 charactersmeson13, Sep 12, 2015

T - This is so good it's silly.  Juicy with orange, grapefruit, passion fruit and peach on top of fields of grass and soft bready wheat.

Consumed 9/9/15
A:  Pours a hazy tangerine with some honey and gold around the edges - medium, white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves a medium collar and leaves some really nice streaks and spots of lacing
S: Opening this can unleashes madness - this is insanely aromatic to start, but it does calm down after a minute or two to confirm that this is actually beer, and not a fresh-squeezed fruit juice  - very, very juicy, with a lot of citrus - tangerine, orange, and grapefruit - flesh, juice, zest, oil, and some very floral citrus as well - dank, spicy and floral, very resinous - tropical fruits, with a ton of pineapple, mango, and passion fruit - ripe peach - lightly earthy - pale malts and a touch of pilsner malts
T: So many hops - citrus, tropical fruit juice, and spicy, herbal - ripe, perhaps overripe, orange and grapefruit - flesh, juice, zest, and floral citrus - big tropical flavors, with pineapple, mango, passion fruit, and ripe melon - a bag of peaches - the absurd blast of fruit is blended with a spicy, herbal, resinous, oily hop flavor - some pine - pale malts are more or less nonexistent - very, remarkably dry, almost too dry - touch of alcohol in the finish alongside the lingering hops and some earthiness
M: Medium body, very smooth, lightly chewy thanks to the oats, lightly oily, nicely carbonated, dry finish
O: Yeah I've got a raging epiphany right now
I have two things to admit. First, I had not even heard of this beer before learning that I had the opportunity to drink it. Second, the first can I had more or less broke my brain; the sheer quantity of juice was simply beyond my expectations. This is not perfect, as it begs for just a touch of malt flavor - which is a statement that makes me want to kick myself based on some of my past reviews - and the alcohol is oddly apparent, but it is excellent.
Update (10/7/15): The taste profile really smooths out after chilling for a month. Holy crap. Increasing my score from taste from 4.25 to 4.5. 2,049 charactersangrybabboon, Sep 09, 2015

S - Heavy citrus aroma dominates the nose - oranges, tangerines, juicy spicy grapefruit.
T - An intense pour of dank tropical spicy citrus from start to finish and even after the sip is gone this beer leaves an after taste that makes you think it's still in your mouth.  Intense peach, mango, tangerine, oranges, and pineapple rind.
M - Full medium body to light heavy, slick and oily, an intense and lingering aftertaste that coats the mouth.  Lingering tropical fruit spicy sweetness with a bitter grapefruit-like bite to round out the sweetness.
O - I keep using the word "intense", I don't know how to better describe this beer.  IPA lovers seek this one out. 731 charactersjzeilinger, Sep 09, 2015

The beer was mostly clear, light-amber hued, orange, golden. About a finger of bubbly white head. Nose was full of tropical goodness and backed by a minor malty alcohol-tinged sweetness. Loved the smell of this beer! The taste doesn't deliver on the greatness the smell promises: tropical notes are more muted. I tasted a light apple flavor as well. Overall, it was a good beer; but I was expecting a bit more. 483 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Sep 05, 2015

Pours murky gold with a thin white head. A partial skim coat for the duration with some errant dotted lacing.
Aromatics blast off with juicy citrus and pine in the back. Melons, peach fuzz, tropical fruit.
Medium bodied with a tacky but somewhat creamy mouth feel.
A carpet-bombing of hops on the palate. Ripe fruit with a drying bitterness. Tropical fruit smashed on pine boughs.
A dry finish with lingering tropical hops.
Great beer, not a fan of the chunks in the can that are in fashion nowadays though. 523 charactersbrewandbbq, Sep 01, 2015

Juicy, Dank, Chewy, Citric
Yes, there is such a thing as an East Coast IPA ... it’s simply a beer from an East Coast brewery that aims to take over your palate with hops. Hoppy beer knows no borders. Foundation throws down oats, Pale malt, Pilsner malt, and a quintet of hops here, and from all of that this IPA is elevated to hyped-about status. Meaning this is an Epiphany you should be seeking out.

4.1/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Slightly hazed orange-gold. Relatively light. Head is bright-white and creamy. Decent head retention leaves a small cap and collar for the duration. Eventually drops to a few clumps. Some solid lacing. Notches and a few splotches.
Smell: Grapefruit in abundance. Oily, juicy, pithy, it's all there. Solidly tropical under the grapefruit. Peach, mango, and nectarine. Solidly floral as well. Malt base is slightly sweet with some nice bready elements. Some pale malt adds a touch of sweetness. Slightly woody with a soft herbal component. Green tree branch. Assertive but not aggressive hop spiciness with some juicy citrus. Slightly dank. Warming ups the dank and sweet elements. Oily and resinous. Deep pine.
Taste: Spicy and floral right up front. Followed by a ton of grapefruit. Juicy citrus. Zest and a good punch of bitter pith. Dank, incredibly dank. Deep and resinous pine. Oily. Tangerine, nectarine, mango, peach, and some other generic tropical fruits. Solidly floral as well. A big aggressive hop bite. Lingering bitterness. Malts are ever so slightly sweet. Pilsner and pale malt make their appearance. Even a touch of oat. Decidedly spicy hop character. A touch of alcohol runs through the back of each sip. A hint of aspirin. Herbal in a sweet and floral way. A touch of green wood and sap. Soft hint of cracker as well. Toasted edge.
Mouthfeel: Dry, very dry and crisp. Moderate carbonation and a mediumish body.
Overall: Ding!
It's another New England IPA with a focus on Cascade instead of New Zealand. Loaded with oily pine and grapefruit. Almost perfect if a bit too dry. 1,608 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Aug 14, 2015

4.69/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75I'm giving this beer the score that I am because it is easily among the two or three most intensely potent hoppy beers I've ever had. Think Lawson's sip of sunshine level aromatics, but with nectary mosaic and spicy Ella bursting out rather than straight citra. For me, it's actually a little too intense. The level of spice and the mosaic character make you want to suck on your tongue after you've swallowed it, which I love, but it is bone dry at 1.009 and for me, I could use a bit more body to back up the incredible hop profile. I'm Giving it the high score that I am bc it really is a stand out beverage and it deserves attention, but personally I wish they'd take the hopping schedule they've come up with and make something with a bit more character in the yeast/malt department. Great beer though if you like to get smacked in the face with peaches and mangoes. I've had it from cans that were a couple days old as well as on draft and I found the draft to be a bit more balanced and drinkable (this was also an earlier batch). Either way though, great beer and worth hunting for. More in the stone dryness/clarity department than in the tree house/trillium/HF cloudy, juicy New England trend. I'd love to put it next to Dinner as they both finish very dry and I feel like they have similar hop profiles. 1,314 charactersAhhhummmm, Jul 04, 2015

Put in on the list... and try it out. Foundation is doing some good work... and nailed it with this one. Tasted a high hint of pine in the finish... so ranks just under some of my other favorites (not a huge fan of pine)... but if I ever come across it again... its going in "the cart." 458 charactersfulcrumbs, Jun 28, 2015

A= A bit of golden haze, fine looking off white head that settles to foam covering.  Lacing wrings the glass as I sip.
S= Thick and dank hop aroma, hop oils, resinous.  Get citrus, lemon and zest.  Great aroma, makes you want to take a sip.
T= Lots of fresh hop flavor with malt balance.  Get citrus and pine, hops fill your palate.
M= Nice rich medium body and moderate carbonation.
O= Zero complaints, great balanced DIPA.  Fresh dank hops and malt, no hint of 8.0 ABV in taste.  Goes down smooth and tasty! 551 charactersjhavs, Jun 22, 2015

Something about the body just isn't doing it for me. I was hoping it might be just a tad bit more "chewy". Great lacing. Reminds me a lot of Jade down here in NC from Foothills Brewing. I'm not sold on this as being an "all that ipa", it is solid though. I'm glad I have three more to test out ;) 404 charactersmst934, Jun 11, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was fortunate that a coworker went to Maine and was generous enough to get me a couple of cans. I was told they are $4 per 16oz can.
Look: I did not pour overly vigorously, so a single finger thick off-white head was the result. It settled to a consistant, thin foam along the surface of the beer. A bit of lacing stuck on the glass as it settled out. The color of the beer itself is a nice golden color that you'd expect with an IPA. The beer is not entirely clear, but there are no floaters of any sort (not that I would deduct for sediment).
Smell: Oooo boy, that's nice! A lively aroma greets your nostrils. I would say this smells like Heady Topper. I'm not smart enough to pick out the individual smells, but the aroma is abundant.
Taste: The bite of the carbonation hits the tip of the tongue. You might confuse it for bitterness, but for me, that comes in at the end as you're swallowing. Again, not smart enough to pick out individual flavors, but I would say you get some of that dankness that you'll have with Enjoy By, and it is very juicy and sweet. With a FG of 1.016, you'd expect it to be somewhat sweet with a meaty malt backbone to carry all of these hops. As you swallow and then breathe out through your nose, you'll get an aftershock of that delicious aroma that your brain will translate into taste. The hops and bitterness completely mask any booziness for me.
Feel: As I mentioned above, the carbonation bites the tip of your tongue. I would say it is appropriately carbonated. With the strong malt backbone, this beer is ...I don't want to say it is syrupy, but...it's getting there. I think the hop bitterness makes it appear thicker in your mouth than it actually is. Completely appropriate for this *almost double* IPA.
Overall: This is delicious. I don't know what the distribution is, but if they were able to  get their name out there a bit more, I think it would shoot to the top of everyone's Want List. If you get the opportunity, try this. If you have to execute a somewhat lop-sided trade to get it, do it. 2,049 charactershuntley101888, Jun 04, 2015

a - classic ipa yellow orange with a frothy head. Semi transparent but mostly murky. Spotty lace.
s - bouquet of dank and citric forward hops. Sweaty and sticky while still being sweet and fruity. Mouth waters...
t/m/o - a winner from the first sip. Super refreshing bouquet of hops. All my favs shoe some of their characteristics with nothing too much in the forefront. Nice citric notes with super dripping resinous hops, very tropical and very ripe. Extremely well done ands super easy drinking.  Hard not to gulp it right down. Worth checking out for sure. 672 characterscosmicevan, May 18, 2015

Mild whiffs of grapefruit and pine. 
Starts with an almost oily base of pale malts. The hop bite is direct and peppery. It doesn't match the smell much, but still tastes pretty good. Spicy finish. Long lasting. 297 characterssmcolw, May 16, 2015

The pour was a hazy, barrel filtered yellow color with a big white head.
Nice toasty malt nose along with grapefruit or perhaps pineapple.  Nope, more grapefruit.
Nice medium to full body.
Same toasty malt presence in the flavor but there is this astonishing juicy fruitiness that starts it all off only to become quite dry on the finish.  This was better than decent. 460 characterspuboflyons, May 01, 2015

Served in a pint glass
The slightly hazy, golden amber liquid was topped by a tight, creamy, one-finger tall, off white crown. The head quickly receded to a lasting, frothy cap. Streaky lacing stuck along the glass.
The aroma was outstanding. Amazingly hoppy and fruity. Super fragrant and bright. I could literally smell the beer from a few feet away. Tropical fruits dominated. Loads of mango, papaya, guava and passionfruit. Citrus notes also came through super strong. Orange peel was most noticeable. There was a nice fruity sweetness as well.
The flavor profile was also amazing, though not quite as complex as the aroma. There was a subtle, sweet maltiness on the front end. Just enough for balance but not so much as to distract from the hoppy goodness. Orange notes dominated. The citrus presence was definitely much stronger here than in the aroma. Orange peel was most noticeable. Somewhat candy-like and really juicy. Tangerine and clementine notes also came through big time. Some mango and dried apricot as well. Orange peel appeared again in the finish. Just a touch of bitterness. Grapefruit rind was also apparent. As the beer warmed, the finish turned slightly more dry and bitter. All in all, amazingly flavorful, smooth and drinkable.
The beer was creamy, frothy, slick and smooth on the palate. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence.
Foundation Brewing's Epiphany IPA is a fantastic example of what this brewery refers to as a "Maine IPA." This beer has the intensity of a double IPA yet drinks like something half its strength. The longer I sipped on this, the more striking I found the similarities between it and Heady Topper. If you are into juicy, fruity, citrusy and tropical fruit-forward IPAs, you will definitely love this beer. 1,884 charactersDamian, Apr 29, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy golden orange color with a 2-finger off-white head. The head is gone quickly but leaves a crown of lacing around the top of the glass. 
The aroma to me is a pretty intense tropical fruit bomb. I get loads of mango and pineapple. I also get a lot of orange and grapefruit. A tad musty. 
The taste is a melange of tropical and citrus fruits. I get mango and ripe melon, with a bit of pineapple. There's also loads of grapefruit and orange. Finishes slightly bitter with a fair amount of pine.
The feel is incredibly smooth. The alcohol is all but unnoticeable and there is medium, to medium-low carbonation. One of the smoothest IPA's I've ever tasted.
Overall, a fantastic IPA that more than holds up to the other greats being brewed in New England. 765 charactersScaryEd, Apr 24, 2015

3.62/5  rDev -18.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75I love Foundation and love IPAs but I think there are slightly too many fanboys rating this higher than what it deserves. (I believe canned about 16 days ago) Cloudy golden color, good head and leaves a solid lacing on the glass. Smell is very aromatic but more fruity and sweet, not the bitterness I'm fond of. Taste I'm torn on; the lacking bitterness of the NE style IPA can be a hit or miss, and I think this is kind of a miss. Very dank and resinous on the mouth but it's kind of biscuity finish is not what I prefer.
New England/Maine/Vermont definitely have their own style of IPA and this fits in with the rest. Unfortunately, for me, it's place on that list is closer to the bottom. 692 charactersEyePeeAyBryan, Apr 01, 2015

The smell in this is amazing. Lots of apricot, pineapple and pine.  
First a smooth, slightly bready taste that quickly morphs into all the aromas plus a ton of bitterness. 
The mouthfeel is pleasant, perfect amount of carbonation bite on the tongue towards the end. 
Overall this is an amazing beer I'd put up there with any other IPA. 400 charactersKevin89065, Mar 26, 2015

Aroma is very, very hoppy. Definitely going for the New England über-hopped IPA style. Columbus, Cascade, Citra, Ella and Mosaic; what a team. I get a very fruity, yet still aggressive hop profile. Apricots, oranges, pine, melon. Sweet, candied malt really props up those hops; who have their own assertive sweetness, too. Flavor is notably potent. I got such a stressed flavor of apricots. Apricot, nectarine, citrus-blend. Finishes pretty coercively. Malt is candied sugar-hop decency. Light alcohol. Very bitter. It's a great beer but I feel like it lacks some of the hoppy intricacies of my favorites. Still, this is a memorable IPA or Imperial IPA. 763 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 25, 2015

Appearance: Pours a hazy gold with a short white head.
Aroma: Apricots, lemon, hops, pine and grapefruit are all in there.
Taste: Tasty IPA! Apricots, melon and cantaloupe are leading the way. There's a lot of hop fruitiness that is very appealing. Good stuff.
Mouthfeel: Easy on the palate for a slightly big IPA.
Overall: Another great Maine IPA. Up to the hype. 435 charactersillpass78, Mar 18, 2015

S - Tons of orange, grapefruit, citrusy rind, a bit of juicy pineapple, smells fantastic
T - Initially a moderate bitter taste, citrus seems to be a bit muted, strong lemon and lemony pineapple flavors come through medium-long.  Finish is lightly bitter, quite lemony but somehow muted at the same time.  Kind of lacks a tropical/citrusy flavor that i was expecting/hoping for, still very good.  An all day-er for sure.  Not much of an impact aftertaste, very lemony
M - Lawnmower IPA to the max in my opinion, surprisingly light for 8%, decently carbonated 708 charactersMacQ32, Mar 12, 2015

A:  Poured a deep golden/orange color with a decent amount of haze into my snifter.  The beer had a good white head.
S:  Big hop nose on this thing.  The aroma is heavy on fruits such as orange, cantaloupe, and some tropical fruit, but there's some pine and earthy notes as well.
T:  The bitterness is smooth up front and quickly gives way to tons of fruity hop flavor that follows the nose, orange and melon notes with some tropical fruit.  There's a fair amount of sweetness, but I think its more the juicy hops than from the malt.
M:  Dry but not as much as other IPAs.  This one has a fuller body that lends itself to the beers hop juice like quality.
O:  Another fantastic beer from the northeast, this part of the county is putting out amazing hoppy beers, and this is no exception. 825 charactersBrams17, Mar 11, 2015

Juicy and quaffable with a very nice nose, the only criticism I can barely muster up is the head and lacing - both of which are there, but just barely.  It starts out with a nice finger thick head on the initial pour, but regresses into limited to no head, maybe a couple dots of lacing here and there.     
While more known for their Belgian style beers - this one puts Foundation on the IPA map.  I hope they put out more IPAs like this and move away from the "infused" variations of existing beers. 583 charactershopley, Feb 01, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25First off, I'll say that I love the vibe and the people at Foundation.  I tried this beer when they released the first pilot batch on Black Friday and thoroughly enjoyed it, but thought it drank a little hot.  This one is really drinkable.  
Poured from a 4-hour old growler into a Trillium tulip glass. Fairly dark in color for an IPA - looks a lot like a homebrew.  Totally opaque - even when held up to a light.  The look of this was my least favorite part. 
The nose is great.  Citrus, stonefruit, very little in the way of maltiness.  
Mouthfeel is a little flat - had a bit more carbonation at the brewery so I'll blame that on the growler.  
Tastes like it smells.  A little bready, but no astringency or vegetal flavors that I seem to detect in most IPA's this big...
Overall, an "elite treat" worth picking up the next time you get the chance! 857 charactersPawoto, Jan 03, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy orange amber color with no vision of anything coming up through the glass.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank too.
Smell:  Tropical, citrus, grassy, herbal, candied fruit, lemony, spicy, juicy, bready, caramel, toasted, and pale malts.
Taste:  Just as good as it tastes.  Light tingly bitterness and a little chewy.  
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, nice bitterness, a little chewy, medium bodied, and medium carbonation.
Overall: Pretty nice DIPA.  Hoppy, balanced, and enjoyable. 631 charactersFlounder57, Jan 03, 2015
