Glass: Clear snifter glass
From: Alpine Beer Company pub in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $7.00
Purchased: Dec. 30, 2015
Consumed: Dec. 30, 2015
Misc.: 2015 release
Poured an auburn, murky color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki tan, foamy head when I got it. Burst of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Below average wet lacing on the sides. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.75)
Smelled toffee, caramel, dates, leathery tobacco, light Jack Daniels whiskey, light butterscotch, dark peach and light citra rind. (Smell - 4.00)
Taste was so much better than the nose, getting caramel, toffee, earthy rye, flat sweetened iced tea, some kind of woody barrel and light booziness. Alcohol was well hidden. (Taste - 4.75)
Medium body. Oily texture. Soft-to-flat carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)
This is an excellent representation of an American Barleywine. Not too boozy and not too hoppy. Loved it.

Smells like caramel apples and english toffee. Smooth! Amazingly smooth. Frosting. Melted caramel frosting. The flavors are not overly sweet and overly woodsy, but definitely there. Perfectly layered like a ganache. This is a sipper, and well worth the wait to try. 321 charactersRothobinide, Dec 28, 2015

Not a big fan of Barelywines I like them but would always prefer a stout or IPA, that being said "Great" and "A Deal With The Devil" are the only ones I would hunt.
Great is amazing this year around they found a way to improve a already great barleywine.
bourbon followed by notes of caramel, toffee, raisins and sweet fruit that are velvety smooth and silky. 
the nose is just as amazing as the taste. 446 characterslilreyreyatomic, Dec 23, 2015

An outstanding barleywine. This is a big improvement on good which I have always felt was overly sweet. With great, the sweetness is definitely toned down with the barrel aging. The mixture of caramel, raising, and apricot preserve is very well done. Some bourbon upfront with oak on the back end. This is a very rich barleywine that has a very bold, yet smooth flavor profile. I only wish it had the luscious dark red copper color that the mostra great had, which was also on tap. Other than that, it's hard to find anything I dislike about this beer. Very well done alpine! 603 charactersworldsworstextra, Dec 22, 2015

Hard to describe how GREAT this is.  It is the perfect level of sweetness without being too sweet.  Light bodied and extremely smooth.  The barrel is subdued and works perfectly to balance the sweetness. 327 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Dec 11, 2015

Aroma gives off a phenomenal smell of pure barleywine - wood,  sweet figs, and slight alcohol. The flavors replicate the aromatic qualities very well along with toffee and raisins. By grace, this is a delicious beer! This is just a tad below Cigar City's Leon, but a cut above Steel Toe's Lunker - both world-class bourbon barrel barleywines in my book! Very impressive coming out of a brewery that is well known for IPA centric beers. 565 charactersCuriousMonk, Mar 20, 2015

The alcohol is extremely well hidden. Having a '12 and '09 vintage, the fresher bottle was much better. A beer that really does live up to its hype. 308 charactersdar482, Mar 16, 2015

A: very dark brown, almost black like molasses or dark maple syrup; slight creamy head
S:  mostly toffee, maple, brown sugar; slight vanilla and bourbon; a bit of raisin and fig; when cold, slight vinegar smell but disappears as it warms; a bit of oxidation underlies everything
T:  very sweet and malty; brown sugar and caramel dominate mixed with figs and raisins; not much bourbon flavor but a bit of heat on the back end
M: soft creamy carbonation; decent mouthfeel but a bit thin
O: not sure why this is classified as an American barleywine, seems like an English style through and through; good flavor profile and well balanced but the sweetness is a bit overpowering; starting to oxidize and the bourbon was much less than I expected.  A good offering and worth trying but not in my top echelon of King Henry, Cognac Church on a Hill, Sucaba, and Mother of All Storms 888 charactersIrishColonial, Nov 25, 2014

Pours a hazy russet brown color, with no real head, or lacing. Looks really nice.
Smells like toasted malt, caramel, toffee, and breadiness. Smells delicious.
There's a nice dark Belgian chocolate and roastiness to this barleywine that's unexpected, on top of the classic toffee and caramel flavors in perfect unison. There's a bit of bourbon, not a whole lot, and some oak and vanilla. Absolutely delicious.
This barleywine has a body of medium thickness, with a low amount of carbonation. It's a little bit syrupy, not a whole lot, keeping it still very drinkable.
This one seems to fly under the radar a bit, it's amazing, but not a whole lot of people talk about. People should talk about it more. 742 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 27, 2014

Taste is bright and tight, bourbon is subtle but helps balance the malt sweetness.  Figs and raisin play a strong role with chocolate and dark malt presence with berry notes, caramel, and brown sugar in back.  Full bodied with soft carbonation and a very creamy inviting palate. 437 characterscpetrone84, Aug 15, 2014

12oz bottle sealed with pressure cap; vintage 2013.
poured into a SP wine stem.
Appearance: murky and opaque dark brown bodied beer with a thick cap of dirty white head that drops down to thin cap and thin ring around glass that remains the entire time while drinking the entire 12oz pour.(drank this 12 oz pour of beer over the course of 2 hours) 
Smell: Very malty and sweet aromas like all "GREAT" barrel aged barleywines. The nose has tons of caramel, bourbon, oak, and dark fruits. Hint of hoppiness. Robust yet balanced and nuanced aromoas from this brew!
Taste: This beer is loaded with caramel and bourbon which has very strong flavor profile in the front of this beer. Hints of wet oak, coconut, and honey. Lots of dark fruits, brown sugar, and light toffee. The beer finishes fairly sweet with a light bitterness lingering long after each sip. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with low carbonation. Rich and mouthcoating. Its a bit boozy even straight out of the fridge before this beer has warmed up. I could also use a a few more bubbles because this is almost has a syrupy mouthfeel and some bubbles would help to break that up developing syrup feel of the beer. 
Overall: Alpine Great very much reminds me of Kuhnhenn BA 4D. Great is also reminicent of really fresh Mother of all Storms. I think that Alpine Great is not an American Barleywine; rather it is more of a cross between a barrel aged English Barleywine and a barrel aged Old Ale in my opinion. This beer is huge and flavorful; my recommendation is to split a 12 bottle with a friend because 6oz of Great is enough for one sitting. 1,642 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 03, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A- Dark caramel brown body, minimal head, a bit of lacing. Looks like a barleywine, to be honest which already isn't a striking style in terms of A.
S- Caramel, toffee, sweet whiskey, oak, cocoa, dark fruit, a touch of citrus and pine. But the hops come nowhere near dominating the malt and whiskey.
F- Complex yet sweet. Caramel and toffee dominate, strong bourbon flavours add complexity and some bitter burnt malt. Hop character is present more as a balancing ingredient to all the sweetness. All flavours have melded very well.
M- Thick, caramelly and almost syrupy but not quite to the point where it would be off-putting. Smooth, sweet and balanced. Zero heat.
O- An American barleywine that drinks more like what an English barleywine does; little American hop flavours come out yet its just enough to make it interesting. Importantly, it balances out the sweet malts that would otherwise make it too cloying. Great mouthfeel and very drinkable. 956 charactersStevedore, Apr 27, 2014

Appearance - Murky brown amber. Small khaki head. Not much going on after a bit.
Smell - Brown sugars. Fruity specialty malts. Bourbon. Raisiny. A hint of hops, maybe?
Taste - Bourbon much stronger. Still very sweet. Brown sugar. Sweet and raisiny. Oaky in the back end.
Mouthfeel - Heavy and sweet. Medium low carbonation.
Overall - Reminds me of JW Lees. Not a ton of bourbon, but it does allow the base beer to shine. 462 charactersAlieniloquium, Jan 14, 2014

2013 vintage 
A big thanks to socalbrewlvr for sending over this long time want in a trade!
A: Pours a very dark brown, with reddish hues when held to light. Tan colored head builds, but not even enough to cover the entire surface, as just a ring is formed around the outer edge. Leaves only a trace patch of lacing. 
S: Aroma is heavy bourbon along with sweet dark fruits and caramel. There are some cocoa notes, as well as vanilla and faint oak from the barrel. I also get some boozy ethanol. 
T: Incredible right from the first sip. Lots of sweetess, with candied sugar and a huge caramel/toffee presence. There are also some rich dark fruits, like dates. The bourbon notes aren't strong, mostly on the finish, with a bit of oaky-vanilla. There is a subtle hop bitterness, but this certainly drinks more like an English-style BW than an American-style BW (which is a good thing in my book). 
M/D: Very smooth, carbonation appropriately low, a bit chewy. It has a whole body warming sensation. Maybe a touch syrupy, but the ABV is non-existent, and drinkability is great. 
O: Fantastic beer. One of those rare beers that I take the first sip, and literally say "wow". Easily in the top handful of barleywine's Ive ever had. Well worth the wait. A must try. Thanks again socalbrewlvr! 1,318 characterszac16125, Jan 11, 2014

From a bottle into a snifter
Vintage: 2013
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, medium looking white head that quickly recedes to a bubbly ring only. A hazy mahogany red in color with no real carbonation evident. A light ring remains until the end but leaves no real lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Wonderful nose. Bourbon, oak, coconut, some caramel and toffee sweetness, with lots of fresh maple syrup over the whole thing. Really decadent. 
TASTE: Very flavorful again. Bourbon, oak and lots of maple syrup sweetness the whole way through. A touch of spicy alcohol at the swallow, then a big and lingering finish of bourbon, maple syrup, coconut and caramel sweetness. No heat lingers at all. Could use a little bit of bitterness as balance, but this is decadently sweet and delicious. Desert in a bottle. 
PALATE: Fuller body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down great and finishes sticky on the palate. No bite or heat at all; the 14% is nowhere to be found. Impressive. 
OVERALL: This was outstanding. Awesomeness in a bottle. The flavor could use a touch of bitterness to help balance the overwhelming sweetness, but in small doses, this isn't an issue at all. I'm also surprised this was just aged in Jack Daniels barrels and there was no use of maple anything in its creation. Wonderfully flavorful and decadent with an impressive, non boozy feel to go with it. A real treat. Thanks again Vanlingleipa. Good times Doopie! 1,566 charactersJeffo, Jan 08, 2014

In fact, it is almost still. Nose is predominantly bourbon, with some nice dark dried fruit and caramel. Not quite as impressive on the aroma as I had expected. Taste is a follow-through on the nose. Had high hopes for this one, and it is good, but not King Henry good. The mouth feel is essentially flat and thin. Fairly standard, if mild, flavors for the style - bourbon, wood, caramel, figs, etc. Super sweet, with some hints of oxidation. Ultimately, it is lacking all the way around when compared to some of it's peers. Don't get me wrong, I like this beer, but considering the hype, there are far better examples of the style out there (King Henry, Blendiculous, etc). Drink 'em if you got 'em, because this one probably won't age well. 859 charactersbrother_kenneth, Dec 15, 2013

Smells incredibly sweet with the dark fruits, (raisins, prunes, figs) caramel, toffee, oak, malt and a slight boozy scent. Taste is a lot of malty, whiskey barrel and oak up front with caramel, toffee being prevalent and a slight taste of sweet dried fruits. Appearance was very dark brown with very little head that faded away quickly.
Overall a very good barleywine from Alpine that is sweeter than most and best enjoyed as a sipper to relish in all that flavor. Very sweet at first but this beer gets better sip by sip and is definitely worth seeking out. 634 charactersBullBearHawk, Nov 23, 2013

October 2013 vintage bottle served in a Ballast point snifter and enjoyed on 02/11/2014. Thank you Brandon for sharing this delectable treat while letting us crash at your place Darkness Day weekend!
Appearance: Pours a chestnut brown color with a few wisps of tan head that quickly settle to a ring around the glass. 4/5
Smell: Ton of rich, fruity, and desserty aromas present: brown sugar, toffee, dates, sweet dark fruit, caramel, whiskey, vanilla cake, and light oak notes too. Smells more like a quad a la Westy 12, rather than a barleywine. There is a very faint aged hops smell present too, a la an aged IPA. 4.5/5
Taste: Candied dark fruit, toffee, and caramel. More dark fruit-forward than nose. Molasses and a hint of soda syrup underlie as well, lingering past the finish. A little alcohol warmth on the finish too. Malty, rich flavor profile. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus bodied, low carbonation level. Malty sweet and rich, but not cloying. No alcohol astringency, while possessing a robust warmth. 4.5/5
Overall: Smells and drinks more like a quad than a barrel aged barleywine, which makes this unique. Seek this one out with confidence.
Cost: $10.99 for a 12 oz bottle. 1,300 charactersjegross2, Nov 21, 2013

The beer pours a deep amber color, hues of caramel brown, fairly sludgy, with no head or lace to speak of. The aroma is of heavy brown sugar, caramel malt, toffee, stone fruit and fig, with some light vanilla and just a touch of woodiness. The barrel is very light on the nose, and the base beer is very prevalent. The flavors are much more dynamic, lots of brown sugar and molasses dominate the tongue at first before a lovely charred presence from the barrel swoops in bringing out vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, stone fruit with some lingering caramel flavor. It's quite the experience, beautifully melded with no signs of alcohol heat at all. The body is slick and oily, almost no carbonation but it certainly doesn't read as flat, it coats the mouth decently and finishes richly and sweetly.
Verdict: A very delicious Barrel Aged Barleywine from Alpine and certainly the first non IPA I've found to be a home run from them. The alcohol is hidden expertly well and the flavors are quite sensational, a beer that lives up to its name. 1,152 characterskevanb, Nov 10, 2013

The only other amazing English Barleywine I have had is King Henry, and it was 2 years old and probably one of my top 5 favorite beers. This beer just vaulted itself into that category.
Holy fuck does this hit you in the aroma. 14% my ass, this smells like liquid raisins soaked in high end whiskey. Figs, Plums, prunes and raisins all mesh together to give this beer such a rich aroma. I could not tear my nose away form the glass. One of the best nose I have ever experienced. Would have loved a little more chocolate or coffee to compliment and offset all the juicy dried fruit, but I am not complaining. 
Lol, you have to be kidding me with this flavor. How is a beer this smooth? And when I say smooth, I mean in the sense that it glides over your tongue like a sip of cream. Coats every inch of your palate in rich, syrupy sticky goodness. In my opinion never got too cloying, but definitely rich and viscous. 
Honestly, one of the best beer of the year for me and top 10 all time. So damn good. I am very happy I traded for this puppy. 1,221 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 07, 2013

2013 vintage.
Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with caramel and toffee syrup and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a really smooth bourbon presence in the flavor that makes this one very easy to drink. 665 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 28, 2013

S: Warm and inviting notes of toffee, caramel and bourbon. Cola, raisin skins, vanilla and some oak as well. There's a touch of booze here, but it's far from overwhelming.
T: Opens with a rich wave of caramel, toasted brown sugar, toffee and light bourbon. Booze soaked raisin, chocolate, light plum and a slight woody dryness.

Poured into a tulip glass, the smell on this is amazing! Smells hot with sweetness.
 Pours a nice dark almost deep burgundy color, little to no carbonation.
Taste is amazing, slightly thick texture, very smooth and nice semi sweet taste. I can't taste 14% alcohol. This is very well balanced. The smell and taste compliment each other. I thought about trading some bottles, but after drinking 2 so far, I've decided to keep the rest. This beer is awesome, best barleywine I've had.

A - almost no head during pour. Very little lacing. Beautiful dark brown to almost black. 
S - first thing that hits you is the bourbon character along with strong vanilla, oak, caramel and molasses.
T - excellent caramel to almost burnt sugar. Mild alcohol presence. Vanilla. Bourbon. A bit of dark chocolate-like, pleasant bitterness towards the end. Initially comes off pretty sweet but is balanced by the bitterness and alcohol. Very complex. 
M - very nice, thick, somewhat viscous mouthfeel with minimal carbonation but just enough. Aftertaste is lingering and amazing. Mouthfeel has never been a major factor in a beer for me before but this is off this charts. 
O - what an amazing beer. I keep going back to smell the beer but the actual taste and mouthfeel on this sucker is unreal. This thing doesn't need any age on it at all, it's ready to drink now. So smooth and layered. 1,088 charactersEliotRosewater, Oct 10, 2013

The head comes and goes rather quickly. No real retention or lacing on this one. The beer smells sweet like caramel with a bit of barrel aging on the nose. The hops are a bit hidden on this. The taste of the beer is also sweet with a subtle bitterness in the finish, flavors of caramel and toffee in there with a minimal bitterness. I was hoping to get more of the JD barrel flavors from this but wasn't able too. The mouthfeel is smooth, very dangerous because it's easy to drink. Overall it's a good brew, really happy I got to try it. 638 charactersKnapp85, Feb 19, 2013

a - like many of the BA Barleywines tasted today, somewhat lifeless brown with no head.
s - smells...well...GREAT! perfect sweetness with toffee and caramel mixed in.
t - FANTASTIC! wonderful toffee. some booziness but perfect integration and amazing balance. just a perfect match between this beer and the barrel it sat in.
m - full and rich. finish is sublime. full bodied and drinks like a dream.
o - overall, great is GREAT!!! had this one side-by-side with king henry, wooden, hell, BA HiFi batch 2, BA Old Ruffian and this was my clear favorite. 924 characterscosmicevan, Aug 05, 2012

A. Pours a very cloudy, very ruddy light brown, ever so slight copper tinge. Absolutely zero head and lacing. Expected a little bit more punch from such a high class barleywine. I gotta admit, it looks pretty lackluster.
S. Wow, a caramel and vanilla bomb. Thick, warm caramel chews, loads of brown and green raisins dipped in cream, chocolate, coconut, vanilla, cinnamon, maple. Unbelievably complex bouquet here. An experience in and of itself. Spec-freakin-tacular.
T. Oh hell sweet yes. Caramel, vanilla, bourbon soaked raisins, chocolate. Alcohol is incredibly well-hidden. I'm also getting a lot of maple syrup. Incredible.
M. A little hot on the back end, but it is decadent and highly complex. Full bodied and chewy. Super rich and absolutely delicious.
O. I'm not the biggest fan of American Barleywines (I much prefer their English brethren). That said, Alpine Great blew me away. This was an absolute treat. 1,084 characterssiege06nd, Jul 21, 2012

Literally no head, no foam and no lace on the beer. A brown amber deep color.
Aroma is sweet of brown sugar, some bourbon and caramel. Not as much vanilla as some. The ABV is present and some alcohol is noted.
The flavor has many of the same components. Brown sugar really comes to mind along with some honey and yes bourbon. There is a sweet caramel that works nicely with the heat of the alcohol. Not too “HOT” which I don’t like, but more warning and inviting.
Pretty bold body, but not syrupy. Very subtle carbonation. It’s there, but barely.
Very, very good beer. Not among the elite of the bourbon barrel barleywines but certainly a treat to enjoy.
As always, thank so much Alex. 796 charactersReagan1984, Mar 20, 2012

Thanks to BdubleEdubleRUN for this one.
Shared with GuruDel, JazzPatel, MrHirschybar & BdubleEdubleRUN
App- A medium caramel brown with some soft ambers and brown and maybe a touch of sliding bubbles. Zero cling as well.
Smell- It's a pretty good BW note. Its aromatic with soft vanilla, malts and some booze presence. The whiskey notes get lost to me.
Taste- A good and malty caramel citrus flavor. A bit prickly but I didnt get most of the barrel notes. A well layered beer with nice vanilla beside it.
Mouth- A lighter medium with a light creamy medium carbonation level. Nice caramel and oak flavors.
Drink- A very good BW, but just not up to par with some of the heavy hitters we busted out last night. 767 charactersFosterJM, Mar 19, 2012

A: Clear, brilliant copper body with just a handful of coarse tan bubbles. Great legs, spotty lace. Very nice.
S: Gigantic, amazing and hugely enjoyable aroma of sherry, vanilla, bourbon-soaked raisin, oak, and toasted caramel. Really rich, really complex, and perfectly aged. Wow.
T: Follows the nose - rich malts, dark fruits, sweet toffee, vanilla oak, and some heady leather. As it warms, some delicious sherry oxidation shows up. The finish is bittersweet and warming, with the 14% showing up with some smooth warmth and pleasant tingling. Incredibly delicious - this might be my favorite Barleywine...ever.
M: Full body, moderate, creamy carbonation, and light stickiness. Excellent.
O: This beer's name is an understatement.
Thanks again, Miller!

12 oz bottle shared with madtowndmb1.
A murky rusty brown into a tulip.
Uncannily, the smell of this beer is the essence of southern style pecan pie. It's as if the good folks at Alpine bottled Thanksgiving dessert. Really a great smelling beer.
Taste deviates quite a bit from the smell. Light vanilla segues into a boatload of toffee and caramelized sugars. The barrel is very light and shows up as coconut and wood on the finish. 
Overall, this is a really nice barleywine that carries barrel aging that way I like it. The base beer is truly the showcase here. In my opinion, all too often, the barrel overwhelms and swallows the base beer in a bb barleywine. In this case, the base is the star and the barrel lays a gentle subtle layer the melds wonderfully. Not big, brash, or boozy. In fact, if this beer truly clocks in at 14%, it's a gem. Subtlety and grace, thy name is Great. 940 charactersBarrytheBear, Feb 18, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle I acquired as an extra in a trade quite a long time ago. My apologies to the generous person deserving of the mention. Shared with friends and poured into mini snifters. This brew appears a clear amber color with some faint bubbles and a ruby to orange coloring around the edges. Leggings of alcohol slowly creep down the wall of the glass after a swirl. 
The smell is almost candied with sweet hints of toffee and vanilla. Some oak is evident that brings out a tannic woody quality that lasts inside the nose and mixes with some herbal indications thy minorly form into something that is medicinal.
The taste is sweet with toffee-like maltiness. Boozy with alcohol that blends well into a toasty grain flavor that gets contrasted with an herbal quality and woody notes from the barrel aging. This brew is drying on the tongue despite the initial residual sweetness. The drying effect leves a bit of oxidative quality lingerin in the mouth. A light bitterness and herbal flavoring turns to wood and back to toasty sweet grain in the finish. 
This is a bold brew with a solid inclusion of alcohol. It is full bodied with a light level of carbonation. Super easy drinking for a big bold brew that isn't hiding it's abv level. It was well put together and enjoyable. I wouldnt mind having it again for comparison purposes with others in the style. It really isn't totally fair to make this comparison but considering the lack of availability and inflated asking price of this brew nowadays I'd much rather take some gratitude. 1,538 charactersstakem, Feb 14, 2012

It was pretty still with the only traces of a head being some bubbles towards the edges of the glass. It had a great looking, deep, dark caramel color to it though. I loved the color and the stillness of it worked for me given the style and abv of 14%.
The aroma shows a lot of caramel and toffee right off the bat. I get some excellent flavors out of the barrel component with woody oak and vanilla notes really coming out. The bourbon is a little more reserved but gives it some excellent complexity. I started to get a little more dark fruits with a little leather as it warmed. Alcohol is noticeable, but not much for being 14%. Fantastic aroma, everything came together pretty perfectly in it. 
The taste has some very good caramel, toffee, brown sugar and dark fruit notes to it throughout. The barrel aging gives it more of the oaky, vanilla flavors with the bourbon being again pretty reserved but also very smooth and flavorful. I get some bitterness in the finish providing some great balance to it. As I drank it I started to get a little chocolate coming out in the finish as well. Some alcohol heat in the finish, but not bad at all for the size of it. 
The mouthfeel is pretty heavy and a little slick. Carbonation is very low. The mouthfeel felt pretty perfect for my tastes. At 14% and almost no carbonation it drank a little like a good bourbon. 
Overall, I absolutely loved this beer. It definitely lived up to the hype for me. They got such a great balance between the barrel and beer characters and both of them together were just awesome. The low carbonation, high abv combo really worked well for me as well. Extremely flavorful, smooth and relatively balanced beer. At it's size and strength it's definitely a sipping beer, but it lived up to it's name for me. It just may be a new favorite of the style for me. 1,893 charactersbillab914, Jan 27, 2012

Appearance: The beer is a full brown bronze color with a small off-white head that fades to a thin ring around the edge. 
Smell: I have never smelled a barleywine that smelled this good, or that had an aroma that jumped out of the glass like this. Caramel, toasted malt, vanilla, figs, dates, and bourbon simply explode out of the glass.
Taste: Sweet to start out. Vanilla, caramel, and dark fruits blend well together but also retain their individual characteristics. Dates and figs flow into a vanilla and oak bourbon flavor. The end is still sweet, but has a soft bourbon dryness to it. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, with soft creamy carbonation. The truly impressive fact about this beer is that it is 14% with not a hint of boozy taste. It warms my stomach, but that is it. A slight sticky residue is left after each sip. 
Overall: So far this is the best barleywine I have had. Enough said. 987 charactersKickInTheChalice, Dec 14, 2011

A - Pours a dark, opaque, chestnut color with a nice layer of creamy foam that eventually subsides to a thin cream colored lacing.
S - Dark molasses, brown sugar, brandy and bourbon, raisins, figs, dates and slightly boozy, vanilla. Nice complexity. A little chocolate.
T - Raisins, rum, chocolate, vanilla, maple sugar, brown sugar, molasses, and ever so slight pine bitterness that's constantly buried beneath the complex and thick malt body. For a barley wine, the alcohol effervescence in very nicely hidden and what's left leaves very mild alcohol burn on the way down. Partially lingers on the pallate and with a rum, brown sugar, and molasses flavor. Toasted caramel and toffee malt.
M - Thick, heavy, viscous, sticky on the lips. 
O - Mellow and complex. 797 charactersjzeilinger, Nov 20, 2011

A: Pours a murky raisin brown with a very short lived thin dark tan head that quickly bubbled away into a faint collar that left no lace. 
S: Rich notes of sweet dark fruits, a touch of vanilla and toffee, and a bit of basement must.
T: Follows the nose and tastes a lot like an old ale. I get a slight bit of oxidation as well. Flavors consist of raisins, plums, dates and other dark fruits combined with sweet caramel, toffee, butterscotch, leather and spicy whisky barrel. The whisky and alcohol are very well integrated. The finish is sweet and almost berry-like, and the aftertaste is spicy, warming, oxidized and full of vanilla, cocoa and light tobacco notes. 
M: Full bodied, thick viscous and slick mouthfeel , and very low carbonation that is tingly on my palate. The double digit alcohol is hidden extremely well.
O: A very rich and potent barleywine. The low carbonation works very well with the strong flavors. Aside from the slight oxidation this beer would be near perfect. Thanks again Shawn! 1,080 charactersscottfrie, Nov 13, 2011

A: Pours a mostly clear deep reddish amber with light stone foamy head, which recedes quickly to a ring that retains quite well.
S: Dried red fruit and well integrated bourbon, toffee/caramel, oak and spice, and just a whiff of strawberry as it warms.
T: Nice bourbon, caramel and brown sugar, and citrus flavor, finishing with some winter spices and oak. Alcohol is somewhat noticeable as it warms, but pretty well hidden otherwise and admirable considering the ABV.
M: Medium body and carbonation. Smooth.
O: Really drinkable, awesome flavors, balanced, and nicely integrated barrel. More barrel characteristics than some of the recent Alpine -bal releases (like BA Token), if you were wondering. Probably one of my favorite barleywines of the year. 833 characterspmarlowe, Nov 11, 2011

T - Really nice. Has a great barleywine base that is complimented by the bourbon and barrel aging. Some sweeter fruit notes as well.

4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Chris (spycow) for this one. Excellent tick!
A - Pours a copper color, light tan head, no cap, thin collar.
S - Sweet caramel, burnt sugars, brown sugar, touch of vanilla, and it's amazing how well-hidden the alcohol is. Very sweet, rich, and such smooth booze. Wow!
T - Like the nose, very sweet and rich. Caramel, burnt sugars, vanilla, brown sugar, oak. Where's the 14%? I don't think I've ever had a beer where the alcohol is so well-hidden. Excellent. I could see this one being too sweet for some, but I guess I like 'em sweet.
M - Medium, syrupy, rich, creamy finish.
O - A stunner from Alpine that I really enjoyed sipping on. The alcohol is nonexistent on the nose and palate, which boggles my mind. An excellent barley wine from the one of the best Hop-producing breweries out there...that says a lot. A must-try. 838 charactersSean9689, Oct 07, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Chris (Spycow) for sharing this one. Served in a Bruery tulip. This was the more recent batch in 12oz bottles.
A - Thin, quick-dissolving off-white foam settles to a thin collar and not much else - minimal lace and no cap, wisps, etc. Murky dark orange-brown body.
S - This is a very fruity barleywine, with lots of cherry and other dark fruits. Caramels, treacle, toffee, tobacco, and plenty of oak and bourbon character. Mild complimentary oxidation that adds fruity port-like flavors. I don't think this batch was aged in Jack Daniels, was it?
T - Again, the taste is heavy with traditional barleywine flavors and only a moderate bourbon influence. Caramel, treacle, brown sugar, toffee, cherries, mild oxidation.
M - Medium bodied, with minimal alcohol warmth. Drinks like a lighter beer than 14% - I could have stood for a bit more viscosity and stickiness. Carbonation is unsurprisingly low. Not particularly oaky - very neutral here.
D - A very good barrel-aged barleywine that doesn't quite crack the top tier for me. I'll revisit this when I drink my own bottle (generously sent by ArthurPendragon before his untimely demise). Alcohol is shockingly well-hidden, which makes this a very dangerous brew. 1,225 charactersMasterSki, Oct 03, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5'Twas one of my last great wales but she was harpooned this last Saturday night. Huge thanks to Sean9689 for this 12oz beaut. 
The color was a tangerine hued copper meaning that it had a bright sheen to its heavy body and was slightly muddy. Minimal head. The nose was rich and sweet with only a little bourbon in its scent but plenty of vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. Perfect. The flavor is the pinnacle of barrel integration, exactly what barrel aged beers should be with the base beer and the barrel working in perfect harmony instead of coming through on the palate separately. Incredibly sweet but cut by the bourbon so as to provide a backbone to the flavor. No harsh finish to be found. The 14% alcohol was completely hidden. The mouthfeel had moderate to light carbonation which lifted the beer off the palate enough to keep it from feeling sludgy or too viscous but creamy enough to know you are drinking a heavy duty beer. Beers like this can be a burden to slog through even when the first sips are heavenly. Not the case with Great, in fact quite the opposite as I wanted more with every sip.
I will be haunted by this beer the rest of my autumn and winter life. 1,178 charactersGoGriz, Sep 27, 2011
4.51/5  rDev +1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a golden reddish amber with no head and no lacing on the glass. The smell is glorious. The aroma is bursting with vanilla, coconut, caramel, some light alcohol, marshmallow as well as some bourbon. The initial taste is some sweet caramel followed by some oaky bourbon, marshmallow, toffee, and vanilla. All the flavors come together quite nicely. The finish has a slight alcohol burn, but nothing unexpected given the ABV. Medium-full body. No carbonation. It could use slightly more carbonation, but it is certainly amazing the way it is. Easily one of the best barley wines have had. 647 charactersjethrodium, Sep 26, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes, back in late June. On tap at brewery into 6oz tulip. No head whatsoever, but has a creamy egg-shell ring. Medium brown color with a grapefruit pink hue. Very refreshing on the nose with a 'great' amount of caramel malt, sweet and salty candies (butterscotch?), with a nice alcohol presence. Taste is very similar, alcohol didn't burn me that much, the caramel and grapefruit came out more. Mouthfeel was decent, a tad too much carbonation for my tastes, as I have always enjoyed smoother barleywines. Still, ABC comes through once again with another magnificent brew. 588 charactersSDDanC, Jul 27, 2011

4.36/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.55oz pour into a tulip at the brewpub.
Pours a glowing copper with no trace of a head. Zero signs of lacing as well and the body is quite translucent. 
Smells of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, oak, deliciousness. I sat and smelled this beast for a good 5 minutes. Outstanding.
Taste follows the smell with the vanilla upfront leading to the oaked bourbon finish. Was expecting more bourbon on this one, but still very nice.
Silky smooth mouthfeel will definite traces of the alcohol, but that's what is expected. 
Very happy I got to try this. Made a trip out today with the girlfriend just to get away from home and am pleasantly surprised to find they tapped a keg today. 681 charactersDearthVader, Jun 22, 2011
4.44/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle generously shared by normyk at a Jackie O's tasting in May (thanks Rob!). Luckily there weren't too many of us, so everyone got a nice pour of this high ABV treasure.
It pours a light copper color, translucent nearly to the point of transparency, with the most minimal of heads. Very nice aroma, candy sweet and bourbony, like sweet liquor soaked fruits.
Toffee and caramel malts are strong in the flavor, along with lasting bourbon notes and a little bit of oak. This is actually even better than I expected, and I expected it to be good. The hops aren't very strong, kind of funny for a brewery known (at least to me) for their hoppy creations. 
Highly recommended, and worth seeking out. This is what Kuhnhenn BBBW wants to be. 745 charactersTurdFurgison, Jun 20, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Second big Want from Alpine I'm knocking off this week; good stuff. Been wanting to try this one for a long time. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.
a - Pours a hazy deep mahogany color with a slight dark red tint, one inch of very light tan head and light carbonation evident. Looks pretty good.
s - Smells of bourbon, vanilla, caramel malts, toffee, oak, sweet fruity malts, molasses, and raisins. Lots of bourbon and vanilla mixing with toffee/caramel, as well as sweetness. This is an amazing smelling barrel aged barleywine; gotta be up as one of the best I've smelt.
t - Tastes of bourbon, sweet dark fruits, wood/oak, alcohol, molasses, raisins, light chocolate, caramel malts, and toffee. Again, this is an outstanding tasting barleywine. Lots of bourbon and sweetness to it, which I loved. More wood or oak than the nose, and a little bit of chocolate. A slight step down from the nose, but still a great taste; the nose was just perfect.
m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy and not a ton of alcohol warmth; some, but not as much as I would have thought for 14% ABV.
o - Overall I thought this was an outstanding barrel aged barleywine; definitely up there as one of the best I've had. Amazing nose; up there with MoaS as one of my favorite barrel aged barleywines, and I'd love to get another bottle of it. 1,366 charactersmdfb79, Jun 18, 2011
3.67/5  rDev -17.2%look: 1.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 12 oz bottle kindly shared at O'Brien's.
A super hard pour comes out almost completely flat. A super thin amount of head around the rim. The color is almost a pinkish brown. Very interesting coloring, but the flat pour kills it for me.
Smells pretty good. Bourbon is the main scent with a good amount of brown sugar and little chocolate lingering.
Tastes like chocolate and whiskey with a strong brown sugar backbone. A touch of fruity sourness comes in somewhere in the back. Maybe cherries or grapes, can't quite nail down the flavor. Finishes with a good alcohol kick, but for 14% this is not super boozy.
Mouthfeel isn't too great considering it has almost zero carbonation and is moderately alcoholic. The body is surprisingly light for such a big beer. I would have been pretty impressed if it was more carbonated.
Overall, about 4 oz of this beer is plenty enough for me. For a barleywine I was impressed, even flat. Probably won't put too much effort to find this again unless it's on tap. 1,016 charactersdmsohyea, Jun 17, 2011

S- Caramel, maple, alcohol, molasses, smells fairly sweet.
T- A welcoming bitter chocolate, maple, caramel, just a little bit of alcohol heat.
M- Filling mouthfeel the lingers after it goes down, very little carbonation.
O- This is probably about the 6th or 7th serving I have had at the pub. 2 were 2005 and the rest 09, everytime I thought it would be the last time I had it for a long time and then when I walk in and see that name on the board I get giddy.

4.72/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to DSC for bringing the Alpine Great, mucho gracias.
Color looks like almond in hue, a light brown that is rather opaque.
The aroma affirms that this has time in the bottle as the 14% is hardly believable to be true, it's perceptably there but hard to believe it's a 14% powerhouse. It is instead blanketed over with the notion that the flavors are going to have some sweet and creamy flavors, and the nose turns true.
So much rounded out and integrated flavors of butterscotch, toffee, caramel, and toasted nuts mixed and incorperated into one another on an oak canvas, this is a delight to drink. 
This is one bottle i'd really love to get a chance to try again. 673 charactersChadQuest, Jun 13, 2011

 Appearance- A muddy sun tea color. Small off white head. Low lacing. 3.5/5
Smell- Vanilla and maple. Oatmeal comes out after it warms. 4/5
Taste- Fruity vanilla and sweet maple. Some alcohol but not much. 
4.5
Mouthfeel- This is where the beer shines in my opinion. I am a sucker for a good mouthfeel. For this particular beer I like the mouthfeel so much that I want to have another sip right away. It is a medium bodied beer that tends to be on the thicker side of medium. 5/5
Overall- This is a very good beer. It is a bit of a sipper, but that is just fine by me. Every sip seems to get better as you go down the bottle. Too bad that Alpine doesn't distribute in this area. I have a feeling I may not get a chance to have another one. But I will be seeking this out. Thanks, Jason!! 4.5/5 1,004 charactersMADhombrewer, May 30, 2011

In the lineup were Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, Hellshire I, BA Hi-Fi Rye, BA Old Ruffian, Abacus, and Alpine Great. Our intention was to also open up Perfect Storm '09, Mother of all Storms '10, Kuhnhenn BBBW, and Arctic Devil but we agreed it best to hold off on those beers for another day due to palate fatigue. Small two ounce samples of the six beers from last night were first tasted and notes were taken before returning to the bottles for more tastes and refined notes.
Thanks to SteelersX for providing a couple of bottles of the ’09 batch.
A: Murky-brown with yellow edges. Very tiny wisp ring with a thick glass coating layer. 3.5/5
S: Maple, tart cherries (not in an infected sense), and warming alcohol soaked wood. It’s pungent and saliva-inducing. 4.5/5
T: Very well integrated. Toffee, some butterscotch, day-old red wine, sherry, and pomegranate with a touch of acid. Arguably the best flavor profile of the night. 5/5
M: Thick, coating, and tongue numbing. Very low carbonation is fine by me. 5/5
O: My personal favorite of the night. A fantastic barleywine that should be able to stand up to any and all competition. I still have a bottle I’ll be looking at opening up next to the other BA barleywine’s I still have to taste. I expect it will look forward to the challenge. 4.5/5 1,506 charactershopsbreath, May 30, 2011

T: Starts dry and the alcohol is hot as hell, but some more of the butterscotch comes through. Some light vanilla, toffee, sweet caramel. Almost candy-like.
M: Full bodied and hot with absolutely no carbonation. This is the weak point for this beer, but the texture works for the amount of heat this one is throwing off.

S: the nose features big notes of bourbon along with notes of butterscotch. Notes of raw oak in the background with new aromas coming to the surface with each sniff. Notes of maple, grape, and raisins all join the show with a hint of sherry.
T: this brew is bursting at the seams in flavor with a big notes of maple syrup along with vanilla and oak. This one is pretty hot, but that is to be expected at 14% abv. Not as much bourbon on the palate as the nose suggested.

Thanks to hannydawg for getting this beer from parts unknown/California
I was excited that this beer might have some JD qualities too it, but not in that cheesy way like Friday's. The appearance of this beer is a touch hazy but maintains a nice amber color and actually for the first time in awhile is one of the BA barleywines that has a head on it. The aromatics of this particular beer are heavy with oak and vanilla, but rather mild on the bourbon aspects. This allows for the butterscotch and caramel which reign supreme on the palate of this beer, to come through in the nose as well. There is a background flavor that I actually love when I detect it in higher abv beers. Toasted marshmallow, some have said almond, but I'm sticking with my guns on this one. It really wraps up the flavor on this smooth drinking beer. Overall, this beer might get lost in a giant tasting like this one, but I guarantee, if you have a bottle all to yourself, you are truly not going to want to share it. 1,015 charactersVdubb86, Apr 21, 2011

Big thanks to hannydawg for sharing this bottle!
Don'tcha just love the modest beers? This one pours a very lightly murky ruby-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises toffee, graham crackers, light walnut, butterscotch, and a vague sense of alcohol. The taste brings in more of the tasty same, though the butterscotch and alcohol come through a bit more pronounced than before. The body is a stolid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice, very tasty b-wine. My only real criticism was that the barrels really didn't impart as much bourbon character as I'd hoped. Despite this, though, this comes through as one damn fine barleywine, straight up. 754 charactersTMoney2591, Apr 18, 2011

12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.
Virtually no head. Translucent ruby-brown with hints of gold in the light.
Big bourbon on the nose. Solid brown sugar, vanilla, and maybe some nuttiness? There is some hot alcohol on the nose that somewhat stings the nostrils and detracts from the otherwise perfect aroma.
Deep rich vanilla and a big big toffee finish. There's some very slight roastiness from a complex grain bill. Subtle vanilla/bourbon on the finish.
Little carbonation, full-body, as sweet as it is, there's still a slight tannic dryness from the barrel aging on the finish.
Overall, the most drinkable beer at this ABV. Alpine is one of my favorite breweries, and they killed it with this beer. After having it on tap last year, I had high hopes for the bottle and it delivered. 825 charactersChrisPro, Mar 27, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4'09 tick (Grade: A-/A)
My '09 review will be more of a short description and difference between the '05.
Huge amount of toffee. Syrupy. Heavy oak on the nose. JD barrels are less apparent (or maybe weren't used in this vintage?). Great depth of dark and milk chocolate flavor mixed together. Not much heat because the heavy sweetness cuts through it all. Nice thick body.
This was much better than the '05 I had. A lot less of that nasty JD whiskey and it had just the right amount of barrel presence. Lots of toffee and chocolate. I'm bumping my score +0.5 in taste, mouthfeel, and overall to average out my 2 reviews.
'05 tick (Grade: B-/B)
Reddish brown color, not much head.
Huge molasses and chocolate nose. Evolves into a cocoa butter/toffee aroma as it warms. Subsequent whiskey and slight oxidization from the barreling. 
Taste was slightly unapologetic. Soy sauce soaked toffee upfront that rounds out into a nutty white chocolate. That must be where that cocoa butter smell came from. Very sweet and syrupy but not extremely viscous.
This beer had way too much of a buttery toffee thing going on to be anything "great." Finish it off with a cheap whiskey barrel and this is what you get. 1,205 charactersBearsOnAcid, Mar 26, 2011

I've had this one once before but it was when I was new to craft beer and really didn't know what to expect. 2009 bottling I do believe. Shared with the La Crosse tasting group during out epic battle of the 12ozers. Poured into a snifter:
A - A nice caramely brown with deep mahogany core. Little carbonation, no head. 
S - Nice barrel with caramel malts. Brown sugar and oak. Toffee and dark fruits. A little sweet but there is a bit of heat to this one too. You can really smell the Jack Daniel's barrel.
T - Creamy caramel, brown sugar and booze. Really smooth and goes down nicely. The barrel is not offensive but it is there.
M - Smooth but a decent amount of heat from the barrel heat. A decent amount of carbonation, but over the top.
D - This one I really liked. It was a pleasure to try and share. It is totally a sipper but I may have drank this one faster because I liked it so much. A must try. 947 charactersjoshuaseresse, Mar 08, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -2.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #1100. Ironically, opening this bottle coincided with the acceptance of my first scientific manuscript for publication!
First, a huge shout-out to hamilton23 for hooking me up with this one. 12oz bottle (2009) into a Delirium tremens tulip.
Pours with a murky, caramel-plum body. Viscous body shows a head that only a 14% ABV beer lover could appreciate (that is to say, it's almost non-existent). Slow trickles of carbonation trace the outer edge of the glass as they rise. Plush bourbon and toffee notes hit the nose immediately, with a gooey caramel sweetness, soft chocolate, and breathy alcohol in the background.
The flavor matches both the aroma and the name of this beer--Great. Dusted chocolate becomes more pronounced, as does a big vanilla bourbon presence from the Jack Daniel's barrels. A bit green on the finish with some earthy hops and booze, as well as a hint of sherry and cardboard-like oxidation. Still, I'm guessing that this beer has held up fairly well, and the alcohol is nicely hidden for the ABV. Great is a slow sipper, and hopefully one I get a chance to sip again. 1,103 characterswagenvolks, Feb 27, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours cherry brown with very little head comprised mostly of a thin white ring around the top. Smells of brown sugar, caramel, booze and a hint of hops. Smell is very strong, but good. It is quite sweet in the taste with a hint of vanilla. Enjoy this beer pretty warm as, straight out of the cellar, it finishes with the reminder of the flavor of ham, which is unappealing. The people I enjoyed this beer with called me crazy, but acknowledged that the smoky, brown sugar sweet finish my allude to some honey ham. Once the beer warmed more, I was completely able to get over this issue and really enjoyed the beer. It is very thick and heavy in the mouth with low carbonation, but disguises the ABV really shockingly well. The drinkability is not limited by alcohol flavor, but instead intensity and its thick body. Ultimately, I held this beer to the highest of standards because I thought when I acquired it that this might become my favorite barleywine ever. To that, it did not live up to. Is this a really good beer though? Heck yes. 1,038 charactersseeswo, Feb 23, 2011

Served in a blind taste test with Kuhnhenn Bourbon Barrel Barleywine and Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine.
A: This beer appears copper / orange in color. The liquid is slightly hazy and still. The beer has virtually no head, but does leave a bit of lacing on the tulip. A respectable appearance, given the style and massive alcohol content.
S: The aroma is very nice, with scents of toffee, caramels, sweet malt, and bourbon.
T: Much like the aroma, this beer tastes "Great". The beer is sweet and definitely has an alcohol / bourbon presence, but neither of these aspects are overpowering or become cloying in any way.
M: Medium in body, with fairly low carbonation. Alcohol content hidden very well. I had no idea that this weighed in at 14%!
D: My favorite of the three bourbon barrel-aged barleywines (I realized after the fact), I would definitely recommend this beer. 949 charactersHuhzubendah, Jan 07, 2011

Beer is copper with almost no head, but some how leaves some lacing behind. There is a haze to it as well. Looks OK.
This beer has an awesome aroma, it's bourbony but it's not overwhelming, it's mostly sweet and like golden raisins and toffee. Yum.
The lead off for this beer is a medium body of malt sweetness and some bourbon comes into the picture in the early midpalate region. There is a nice caramel / toffee flavors that come from the bourbon and malt complementing each other and the finish is good with a moderate oakiness. The carbonation on the palate is low and the feel of the beer is creamy with a nice finish. 687 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 06, 2011

4.09/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle courtesy of a BA whose username has been lost to the ages (and a crashed computer). Been aging this one for a year or so - excited to give it a try.
Appearance: Pours a deep, vermilion rosewood, transparent when held up to intense light, but dark enough otherwise that it's for all practical purposes opaque. Nicely hued, really, but the 14% makes itself known pretty quickly. The half finger of moderately tanned head fizzles and fades fairly quickly, as does the surface lace. And the collar. And the lacing on the side of the glass. I mean, it's not that it's not expected, but a little bit of something here would be nice. 
Aroma: Huge sugars, free and intense, suggest caramel, molasses, honey, and whiskey-macerated citrus and stone fruits. Peaches, grapefruit, raisins, and cherry notes intermingle with a ton of sweet, golden vanilla notes, toasty wood, and a slew of rye whiskey.
Taste: Interesting dichotomy, this beer. First, it's definitely well aged - the malts dominate this one, and the sweetness shines through boldly. Sweet, gingery, cookie-like caramel notes, toffee, brown sugar, and molasses coat the tongue and intermingle with a huge slew of slightly nutty, toasty coconut. The barrel contributes a lot more, too - in fact, the barrel notes dominate the hop notes that I know must have once been pretty strong here. Huge vanilla joins the coconut, but both are overshadowed by enormously spicy, slightly sweet, roasted whiskey notes. Lord only knows how much of the 14% of this beer is contributed by pure spirit addition, but I imagine it's gotta be at least a percentage point or so on the top. There're obviously some remnants of hop notes here, but the bitterness has all but faded to a dull, persistent roar in the background, and most of the hop flavor notes have faded similarly. Only a few dashes of herbal spiciness remain, moderately leafy, minty, and slightly citrusy at points, with the free sugars amplifying the fruity aspects that do remain, like canned peaches or grapefruit.
Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, and nearly devoid of carbonation. But it works. As an aside, I thought the cap on this one wasn't on quite right - it seemed to flair out in a way that suggested improper capping. But when it was cracked, there was a faint hiss, and I am detecting a faint sizzle somewhere deep, deep within the body of this beer. It's hard to differentiate at times from the sizzle courtesy of the mammoth alcohol bill, but it's there. Somehow, though, the faint carbonation and thick, chewy, fat body work wonderfully with the sweetness of the base beer. 
Drinkability: I didn't love this beer. The 14.0% is definitely here, affecting the appearance, and the carbonation level is a little low, even for a beer this chunky and chewy. That being said, there's a lot to like here, and I did enjoy it. The aroma was pretty fantastic, and the flavor profile pretty robust and complex. On the whole, it's a mixed bag, and I'm not sure it's worth the $10.99 that was on the cap ... though maybe it'd be different fresh. Gimme some bolder hop notes, a little more lift, and I think this one would be stellar ... essentially, give it to me fresh! 3,181 charactersCrellMoset, Dec 21, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Can't remember who sent this, but thank you!
Pours a dark, impenetrable yet clear mahogany brown color with a quickly receding, initially two finger thick tan head. Unsurprisingly, the head isn't long for this world and leaves little trace behind. Aroma and flavor are both exceptionally sweet, overly complex and subtly balanced. The nose leads off with a strong boozy whisky and vanilla aroma with softer notes of figs, raisins, plums, brown sugar, caramel and sweet malts. Body is thick and lightly carbonated with a sweet, dry bourbon-y finish. A strong base of caramel, toffee and crisp malts supports the strong oak and woody flavors of the spirits and dark fruits. Incredibly smooth and balanced with surprisingly little alcohol heat throughout, despite the strong booze and spirit presence; this is an exceptional barrel aged beer. 881 charactersyourefragile, Dec 13, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to JessetheHutt for the bottle.
Great pours a darker, caramel brown color. It's quite hazy, and looks dark copper with backlighting. Carbonation looks to be very light, and produces a head that barely covers the surface. It disappears nearly as fast as it appeared. Lacing was very, very light. The 14% abv obviously killed it.
The nose is damn impressive. Initially, it has a strong dark fruit scent. Raisin, plum, and fig are present in abundance. They're complemented extremely well with a moderately strong whiskey (bourbon?) scent. Smells delicious. The secondary level introduces vanilla, oak, leather, caramel, and even a little tobacco. It's extremely complex and deep. Alcohol is certainly there. At 14%, that should come as no surprise. Go big or go home.
The flavor is every bit as tremendous as the nose! It kicks off with a very nice caramel/toffee flavor. The malt base is strong and sturdy. Dark fruit flavors of raisin, fig, and plum flood the palate and feature a tangy twist. The barrel aging imparts a very nice whiskey or bourbon flavor. It's an extremely nice complement to the dark fruit and caramel malt flavors. Oak, vanilla, tobacco, leather, and even a slight hint of herbal hops take up the secondary level. Alcohol is there and is a little warm. It finishes tangy with a twist of whiskey.
Great has a medium to full body. It feels more substantial with warming. Nice and chewy. Carbonation is very light and restrained. Very creamy and smooth? Yes, it is. Drinkability is good. For a big, barrel aged barleywine, this is quite drinkable. Nonetheless, it is 14% abv. That's damn strong. A 12 oz. bottle is more than plenty.
Great is one hell of a nice beer from Alpine Beer Company. As far as barrel-aged barleywines go, it's among the best. The chinks in its armor are so small that they aren't worth discussing at length. This is a damn fine beer that you should seek out. 
As an aside, I saw that this was aged in Jack Daniels barrels, and the label plainly styles this as a bourbon barrel barleywine. I've always been fascinated by the debate about Jack Daniels being Tennessee Whiskey, not bourbon. I digress.... 2,157 charactersprototypic, Dec 11, 2010
3.84/5  rDev -13.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter. Thanks to mikedashg for this one. 12 oz. bottle, 2010 vintage (I think).
3.5 A: A ruddy dark brown color. One eighth inch frothy head falls almost as soon as it is poured and leaves no lacing. Not really that surprising given the beastly ABV.
4.5 S: Rich caramel and toffee dominate. The bourbon and associated components aren't even close to the magnitude of the malts, which makes sense given the amount of malt packed into this bottle, and that's just the way I like it. Anyway, you can pick up moderate amounts of bourbon, leather, and oak. Some vanilla in there as well. Prune and raisin fruitiness with a port-like vinous component. A touch of herbal hops. Booze is pretty well hidden, but is still somewhat noticeable.
3.5 T: The caramel and toffee are still pretty strong, but not as much so as the nose suggested. Prune, raisin, fig, nuts, oak, molasses, and vanilla are next. The bourbon character is bittersweet in the taste. Bourbon, leather, and vanilla work well, but there is definitely a noticeable tannic astringency. 
3.5 M: Heavier medium body. I was expecting (and looking forward to) a heavy ass body. Still, it's thick enough. This could use a bit more carbonation and could be creamier as well. Otherwise, smooth.
4.0 D: This is a good beer, but it isn't nearly as good as the average score suggests. This doesn't hold a handle to 08 BA Old Ruffian or any vintage of CWBBBW. I'll put it on a similar level to Weyerbacher Insanity in terms of quality, with this being a hell of a lot bigger. I gave this a 4.0 to elevate the overall score a bit since I think the taste is right on the 3.5/4.0 border. 1,650 charactersDavoleBomb, Dec 07, 2010

A: Served with a light layer of fine white head with poor retention. Beer is a semi-cloudy deep brown. Very spotty and sparse lacing with no stick. 
S: Nose is very deep and aromatic. Notes of chocolate, booze, brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. Also some light prunes and crushed raisin in the back. Rich, warming, and delicious. 
T: Opens vanilla, prune, brown sugar, caramel, and nuttiness. Booze is apparent in the back. Toffee with a slight rich tartness towards the middle. Caramel comes in smooth at the end. Slight hop resin at the end with a sweet, brown sugar finish that sticks to the palate. 
M: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation, slightly abrasive, and rather hot overall. Oily and smooth in the mouth and warming going down. Messy finish with a sticky aftertaste. 
D: Again, I'm still not a huge fan of barleywines but this, along with a couple of others are helping me to turn the corner. Infinitely rich and complex with a very enticing nose and feel. A very good representation of the style. 1,070 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 14, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage on tap at Alpine. Caramel coloered with a small head that recedes to a thin crown. Aroma is amazing, rich caramelized malts wrapped in bourbon, oak and vanilla. Wonderfully oxidized, sherry like with a hint of savoriness. The palate is massively malty and rich. Flavors of butterscotch and bourbon are balanced by tannic oak. Oxidation lends notes of sherry and faint soy sauce. Full, almost syrupy body, yet this is surprisingly easy to drink and very balanced. This was very good from the bottle, but it's outstanding on tap. There's virtually no trace of alcohol, and the balance between beer and barrel is impeccable. 634 characterslargadeer, Oct 23, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. 2010 edition direct from the brewery via Milt on release day. It was an orange amber color with a few stray carb bubbles. Even with a hard pour there was no head. No lacing either. At 14% ABV not really surprised by either. 
The aroma heavy on the bourbon, vanilla and oak as expected but also had some really good toffee and caramel undertones. One of the better smelling ba-beers I've had in awhile. The taste follows the aroma with a rich toffee flavor blending nicely with the oaky vanilla components. You can smell and taste the high ABV for sure but it's not overpowering. Rich mouthfeel with good aftertaste.
Overall, an excellent bourbon barleywine. After a bunch of overpowered bourbon bombs, this one nailed it and showed what a ba-beer can be in the right hands. Another homerun from Alpine. Highly recommend if you can find it. Not avail here in TX so got from Milt. Rotation - lucky to get this one so this will probably be it. Would have again but only if sharing with some friends.

3.93/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the bottle into a Bruery tulip. Thanks, Jason.
As the liquid rushes from the bottle, it appears to be a deep, clear mahogany. A very thin beige cap forms but disappears nearly instantly. 14%, you say? Holding it to the light, it's apparent that the beer is not just brown, but closer to a slightly murky, deep reddish brown. The beer sticks to the inside of the glass when I swirl it. Impressive legs. I wish the head could have stuck around a while longer, and I wish the beer had a bit more clarity. Overall good though.
Smell. The booze stings the nostrils. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla straight up front, with a caramel and sweet malt backing. This smells very sweet - I've had three flies try to divebomb the beer. Very nice, but would be improved with moderation of the booze.
The taste is nice. Boozy, to be sure. This thing could stand to sit a while. Bourbon, vanilla, oak, toffee, and caramel are all present in a sweet conglomeration - honestly, this drinks pretty good, but if it were any sweeter I would have a major problem with it. 
Mouthfeel is appropriate. Low level of carbonation, smooth and creamy up front, with a very tannic finish. The finish is actually somewhat bracing.
Drinkability is decent for the style and for the alcohol content. This is a sipping beer, treat it with respect. 
I've had this beer on three different occasions. The first was at Stone Oakquinox from a jockey box, and I thought it was the best thing there - I was bowled over by it. The second was both 2005 and 2009 versions at the brewpub, and I was let down - I recall there being a weird smell akin to cat food in the 2005, and the 2009 needed some time to round into form. I'd rate this most recent experience to be in between those prior ones. This is a good beer, but there are a number of other barrel-aged barleywines that are better, IMO. If you can get two bottles of Great, do it, and sit on one of them for about 10 years and see what happens to it. 1,974 charactersdavod23, Sep 09, 2010

One finger off white head that sits atop a super dark ruby body. Head eventually disappears and leaves no lacing behind. Oily legs.
Smells of super rich caramel and toffee. Then some bourbon and oak, but the pungent sweet scent of caramel and toffee are the focus here.
Tastes of raisins, plumbs, and a vinous component. Then caramel/toffee, bourbon, vanilla and oak. A rich, sweet, and complex brew.
The mouthfeel is thick syrupy and nicely carbed. Smooth, but a bit palate crushing by the end.
Alcohol is well hidden, but it is a heavy and somewhat palate crushing brew. A real treat that I was stoked to have the opportunity to try. 710 charactersbillshmeinke, Aug 29, 2010

A - Very dark brown/deep red with a small half in white head that disappears very quick leaving no lacing
S - Lot of bourbon up front but there is some complexity going on. Vanilla, caramel, and some dark fruits all come into play.
T - Bourbon and booze up front but just like the smell it has the underlying fruit and vanilla.
M - Pretty thick but silky smooth. Unfortunately its flat but that doesn't really ruin a beer like this but it would have been a much better beer with some bubbles.

Wow. I ordered a 5oz taster of this and thank God I did. Alpine made no attempt to hide the alcohol in this big guy. 
S - Scotch, bourbon and whiskey. You pick up a bit of oak but the alcohol is overpowering.
T - This is a strong barleywine. At 14% you really taste it. Tastes of bourbon, whiskey, oak and mild spice.
M - Buttery and whiskey-like.
D - There is no way I would be able to put back a 12oz. Not impressed with this. That being said, the rest of the Alpine arsenal is delicious.
EDIT, 2011: Though for some reason this beer keeps popping in my head. Perhaps I was too "new" to the style and reviewed it low die to my inexperience. Must try on my next visit to the brewery (if I can find it). 763 charactersjamex, Aug 21, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4So happy that this was in a 12oz bottle instead of 22oz. Poured the color of a leaf pile, seemed to change from brown to dark amber to burnt orange over time. Very small head that faded quickly, basically no lace.
Smell was quantitatively intense but qualitatively reserved, unlike many booze aged beers. Sweet and buttery. Raisins, vanilla, a vague hint of fruit, and of course sweet, sweet whiskey.
Taste: Sweet malt, candied nuts, dessert wine, maple, and just enough bourbon to keep it interesting without blowing it. A touch of hops as an afterthought best left in the background, thank god Alpine had some sense. 
Perfect feel for a beer like this, clings to the palate for a while.
I imagine this beer tasting like the result of JW Lees Harvest Ale if it was aged in a bourbon cask. 
Best bourbon barrel aged barleywine I've ever had. 843 characters7ways, Jul 21, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Major thanks to jhenry04 for his kindness and willingness to send this east.
Pours a thick and cloudy orange-amber with red highlights, topped briefly by a good skim of beige foam. Clingy resin and and a few bubbles coat the inside of the tulip.
Often a prominent bourbon barrel aroma will have a sharp oak/whiskey/alcohol smell that overwhelms, or will lack any of the softness of the bourbon and/or the barrel. Here no. It is prominent, carrying some nice vanilla, but the deep caramel and luscious fruit of this play well, making a complex bouquet that also features fig, and even some floral hop in there.
First sip, prob. 55 deg., is a jolt of flavor. A wave of thick alcohol, deep sweet, bourbon, oak, and vanilla slide onto my tongue in soft resiny goodness. Nice! From there this brew just shines and shines. There is some really luscious cherry, some nice sweet floral tones, other notes I can't identify that kick in and usher the rest of the sip through the finishlands of alcohol and hops. Not the hoppiest barleywine by any means, but the bittering hops are perfect in the mix, and kick in at just the right time to dry a sip you'd think would have none of it. Eight ounces in, warmer, I've tasted remarkable variants of fermented maltsweet, of fruit, peach, nectarine, grapes, also a perplexing variance of alcohol intensity, from not to hot, other elusive and delicious flavors. It all makes for a complex monster of morphing taste. This is off the charts here. My brain's flavor center is ordering my conscious mind to type, "This is the best barleywine I've tasted." 
Mouthfeel is almost as good as it get in this style. Where thickness in body yet easy drinking are the target, this is the bullseye. Where a semi-dry finish for a beer made with ridiculous amounts of malts is the goal, this is Wayne Gretzky. Pretentiously named, but right to pretension can be earned. This baby walks the walk.
Drinkability? For a beer this size? Mwahahahaha surely you jest. All that's keeping me from actually killing myself with unbridled continuing consumption of Great this evening is the fact that I have only this one bottle.

Poured a deep dark brown with maroon highlights and a thin head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. The nose was very nice with big caramel and whiskey aromas from the oak. There were hints of vanilla, brown sugar, and booze that was not dominating the nose which was well hidden. Up front the taste was big on caramel and whiskey flavors with vanilla, toffee, and slight booze accetns. The beer was full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that had a thick sweet syrupy and faint boozy finish. Apline came through with an exceptional barleywine style brew that was really drinkable and made me want to serve up more in my glass every time it was empty. 702 charactersGobzilla, Jul 01, 2010

Forms a small head that settles very quickly down to nil. Body is a slightly rosy dark brown. Virtually no lacing is left. 
The barrel aromas of vanilla and Bourbon dominate at first followed by some toffee, chocolate, and fruit. 
The label says "a Barleywine done the Alpine way". Based on their other beers this lead me to imagine this might be a hop bomb but it seems they simply meant it was big and bold in character. Not to say this isn't hoppy, it's definitely no English Barleywine, just that the other characteristics dominate. Bourbon notes are joined by some sweet dates with some heat and hoppy bitterness on the finish. Toffee comes back and is joined by some subtle cherry flavors once this reaches room temperature.
A little thin bodied but not bad. Looks completely flat but there's a subtle soft carbonation that works here. As much as the Bourbon flavors are a big part of the flavor the alcohol heat is remarkably gentle and is pushed into the background for the most part.
An aptly named beer I'm very glad I got to try. Another winner from the Alpine folks. 1,204 charactersberkey, Jun 17, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to billab914 for this diminuitive bottle of promising-looking brew. I just checked & though we completed our trade over a month ago, I haven't cracked a single bottle. WTF? Let's fix that immediately.
My first non-hop-oriented Alipine brew, which have been great, so my expectations are elevated to a degree. Pour is a lovely, slurry red. Nose is evident from enough paces to quick-draw your six guns - bourbon. Lots of bourbon. Simultaneously overpowering & restrained. That's a neat trick. Nothing else comes through, but it doesn't really need to. 
Just from smelling Great, I can actually taste it before any of the beer actually enters the orifice meant for tasting. Massive flows of caramel surprise the palate after the smell, with the vanilla, bourbon, & drying oak taking a back seat, but still strongly present. Scorched sugar, toffee, & a big dollop of syrup round out a huge, complex beer. Alcohol arrives late, & reminds you not to drink & drive. 
Thick, like you might need a spoon to ladle it over an entree, & still as a dark night under the stars. One could perhaps quaff this all night, but it would be a short one. And make sure you have a GPS tag so you can be located the next day. 
Wow. Top-notch, fantastic beer that deserves its rating. Possibly the most complex, deep, & robust BA Barleywines I've ever had, & wonderful to boot. My opinion of Alpine only continues to rise. 1,409 charactersmaximum12, Jun 09, 2010

4.44/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served into a wine glass from a capped bottle. Pours a deep brown with deep mahogany highlights. Clear and with a thin and fleeting cap. Vinous on the pour like a Cabernet, yet with a light ring.
Nose of oaken wood and whiskey. I realize that a relatively flat pour fits this pour well. Though one sided this brew is quite interesting in that all your typical barleywine notes are buried beneath the barrel. Crushed by the oak and rendered insignificant, yet allowing subtle influence nonetheless.
Flavor offers subtle notes of wood and charcoal and cherry. Yummy should you prefer the barrel, and yummy regardless.
A very barrel forward approach given the style which settles out to offer a port like quality and improving in complexity with warming. 754 charactersHalfFull, May 20, 2010

S: Bourbon and oak provide the first noticeable aroma, but are hardly overpowering. The base beer comes through strong with caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, some light tobacco, and dark fruits.
T: Amazing...the bourbon comes in at just the right level, subtle enough to not overpower the beer, but strong enough to add depth. The caramel, toffee and molasses base swirls around in the background as vanilla and dark fruits play out over it. The dark fruits are especially stronger than in the nose, with figs and dates really coming through. Finishes sweet, as one would expect, with a linger aftertaste of brown sugar and vanilla. I hesitate to give 5s too often, but wow.
M: A touch on the thin side, but tremendously smooth with a good amount of carbonation to hold it up.
D: The booze is remarkably well hidden and it goes down way too easy. 1,055 charactersXul, May 19, 2010

I couldn't tell with a cursory once over, but Eric says this is the first bottled batch... very cool!! The first batch was a whale of mine for a long time and may have to step back up into those shoes.
I got one of the first pours and it shows deep reddish orange... very clear.. nice tan head.
nose is amazing and only shows hints of EtOH on the finish.. plently of caramel... maple... vanilla prior.. very rich.
flavor has a good oaky tannic aspect that adds a nice drying quality amidst all the malts... vanilla bean with some almonds and toffee.... plummy dark fruits.. maybe some hints of oxidation that mesh well with the overall product....
big body for sure... carbonation seemed restrained as it should be... a very slow sipper.... SAS said this bottle was his favorite after the Veritas.
Seems like a blown out of the water English BW.
Thanks a bunch Eric... I appreciate that you remember after all this time to bring this up to share.... pretty badass.

An absolutely huge and wonderful nose on this one, with the expected bourbon, along with vanilla, brown sugar and molasses. Flavors of bourbon, toffee, caramel, vanilla alcohol. Very syrupy and hot, with a somewhat cloying mouthfeel and a huge bourbon presence. A very good beer, one that could take some time in the bottle. 437 charactersemmasdad, Apr 29, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark golden brown color, very murky looking. Not much in terms of head but very appealing in color.
Big, really big. Lots of oak and bourbon in the aroma. Tons of burnt sugar and roasted malts come through. I cannot wait to try this.
Taste is of rich malts and burnt sugars, bourbon comes through and a lot of oak as well. Somewhat of a hot finish, but it goes down well. Toffee and caramel, this beer has a lot of sweet tastes. Very good barleywine, thanks to mothman for letting me try this. I would surmise this is the epitome of a bourbon barrel aged barleywine.
Mouthfeel is big, full, thick and creamy. Medium carbonation, the finish is a little hot, but it seems to finish well.
Given the ABV this is a very drinkable beer, a top notch barleywine which I would like to drink more of in the future. 816 characterspmccallum86, Apr 02, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into old guardian snifter.
Pours hardly any head. However there is a ring of foam. Very slight lace. Color is a mahogany brown copper.
Aroma: Massive bourbon oak. Vanilla with a very nice fall flavored spice. The oak is dead on. Tons of malt; caramel and toffee flavors. Burnt sugar. Very solid. 
Taste: Rich and malty. Toffee and caramel. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Very warm. Burnt sugar with some sweet notes. This beer has a very slight amount of alcohol showing for the high abv. Tons of malt with little hop showing. Great bourbon flavors blending this beer together.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and rich. The carbonation is a little lower, but it really works well with this beer. It has a fairly large body. It is ends sweet and malty, relatively clean. After discussion with my homie Pete dog, I notice the bitterness of the hops. I am glad he picked up on that as it is an American Bwine.
Overall, a very solid bwine. It is big, smooth, and drinkable. Lots of flavor and the bourbon barrels really tied the beer together to make it complex, yet drinkable. I am glad I had a chance to try this one. Very solid. 1,121 charactersmothman, Apr 02, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle received in trade with srandycarter. Thanks! Poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass.
A - Pours with an ever so slight yeast murkiness in a gorgeous dark amber brown color with reddish tinges to it in the right light. No head forms at all, but a nice thick collar of tan color and a steady stream of bubbles rising up off of the laser etching in the bottom of the glass. This is tempting me to take that first sip.
S - Yeasty and very bread dough-like in aroma...smells like fresh dough before going into the oven. Some malty, caramel, molasses aromas, sweet bourbon in a sorta heavy way...almost like a bourbon reduction sauce. Alcohol is also quite noticeable in the aroma too which isn't surprising given the 14% level here. Overall, a heavy, almost syrupy impression from the aroma.
T - Taste is quite sweet overall. Up front is caramelized sugar, toffee, molasses in a mixture together that blends with the bourbon. Bourbon doesn't have heat to it, just nice flavor added, some vanilla and alcohol flavors. Bready malt and yeast flavors kick in to round things out. Hops do not add any flavor character, just a touch of bitternes, although I think the bourbon edge does more to balance this than the hops do. Good flavors, somewhat unique...a bit heavier, deeper than others of the style. I want to say that there is a smokiness to this, maybe a bit of the char off the barrels.
M - Very thick and syrupy in nature. Mouthfeel is extremely full with only a light carbonation to liven things up. Flavors here are heavy and the body complements this. Smooth, sticky, mouth coating and extremely viscous. Overall heavy but a really nice sipper all around.
D - Hmm, tough call. Alcohol is quite high at 14%, which is a real impediment to drinkability, but the alcohol seems to only add flavor and character without the heat that I would expect (a definite plus). Mouthfeel is rich and full - pretty much a thin syrup. A sipper all the way, and I appreciate the decision to put this in 12oz bottles...this is absolutely the perfect serving. Trying to put down a bomber of this would be enjoyable, but hard work.
This would really be a quite expensive (and debatably a waste of this beer) marinade, but I think reducing this down a bit and using this as a marinade and/or barbecue glaze would on beef, steak tips especially, maybe chicken too would be absolutely amazing. 2,390 charactersportia99, Mar 30, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Dark, murky brown pour with only a small sliver of head. Pretty much as expected.
The aroma is a pounding assault of caramel and bready malts. Oh man, this is GREAT (!). Some pine resin, vanilla, and boozy heat round it out. My first impression is that this beer is going to be right up my alley.
First sip and it appears that I am correct. Although this the bottle label calls this a "barrel aged barleywine" I think the American Strong Ale category suits it best because to me it is a cross between an English Barleywine and a Wee Heavy. And it is decadent. Rich caramel and biscuity malts engulf the mouth with full flavor. I'm picking up notes of cocoa powder, toffee, and vanilla which is surely the byproduct of the barrel aging treatment. My throat and belly burn from the high ABV, and the noticeable heat does serve as a reminder that you need to sip on this beast and resist the urge to chug. 
The body is full and carbonation is low. The alcohol burn is a bit of a detractor.
Drinkability is extremely high in the sense that I would purchase this again in a heartbeat, but I have to dock this a bit simply because I am already worn out after less than 6 oz.
Overall this is a world class beer in my opinion. Highly recommended. 1,243 charactersalcstradamus, Mar 20, 2010

The smell is unique aggressive and amazing! I'm overwhelmed by the complexity...initially comes across with that classic corny butterscotch then an intense maple syrup over Aunt Jemima Eggo waffles or the revelation that an easy way to kick up a pancake batter is to add a dash of vanilla extract follows. Light carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied with a creamy smooth texture and chewy character...Full flavored, the rich sweet characteristics of the nose are mirrored in taste and enhanced nicely by the body. Maple pancakes with vanilla accents and black licorice, caramel and dark fruit experience. It all lingers quite nicely. The 14% ABV is extremely well integrated. A booziness is present and expected, to some extent in this style. Highly recommended! 915 charactersjjayjaye, Mar 18, 2010

A: Pours a fairly-bright dirty copper with a tiny whisp of a tan head.
S: Very rich bourbon alongside some caramel, toffee, sweet malts, and alcohol (although not nearly as much as would be expected from a brew of this alcohol level).
T: Lots going on with the bourbon beautifully complementing the sweet maltiness of the base beer. Some nice woodiness as well as loads of caramel.
M: Medium body with a low level of carbonation and moderate booziness.
D: Very delicious. Not extremely complex, but just done so incredibly well. 602 charactersThorpe429, Mar 16, 2010

A - Poured deep amber, ruby/garnet highlights in the light and no head. 4.0
S - Wow there is lots of bourbon and lots of caramel here. It's like Emeril went BAM with bourbon in this barleywine. Touch of dark fruits and vanilla too. 4.5
T - Very much like the aroma, there is plenty going on here. Everything you could want in a barleywine, plus the bourbon. Pretty sweet too, nearing the cloying department but it just barely toes the line. 4.5
M - Somewhat slick and chewy. Big body here. Very low to no carbonation. 3.5
D - Very good. The alcohol is obvious but for its abv, it drinks very well. 3.5 701 charactersDmanGTR, Mar 11, 2010

A- Pours a darker amber color with no head even with a more aggressive pouring.
S- The nose of this beer is mellow with a sweet background, no really prelude to what you are about to experience. 
T- This is really where this beer shines, the first taste you get is a sweet malty taste. As soon as you swallow you get coco, nutty and oak/vanilla flavor. This lingers for a while in the most enjoyable way. The 14% is integrated to a point where I would not believe it unless I saw it on the bottle.
M- The mouth feel for of this beer is prefect. I got a little worried when I poured and saw no head I expected a flat beer but it complemented the sweetness of this beer and allowed the after taste to show.
D- This is a great sipping beer, I am glad I had to pleasure to try this. It has great complexity and is such a great beer, grab this while you can. 930 charactersMikeBuff, Mar 07, 2010

A: The pour is a deep, dark amber color with some nice ruby highlights and no head.
S: An amazing nose to this beer: plenty of vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and whiskey. All the things you'd expect from some quality -bal aging.
T: The flavor is just as enjoyable as the aroma. Lots of sweetness in the form of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of butterscotch and molasses. The vanilla and whiskey come through nicely here, providing a bit of warmth as well.
M: The body is quite full with very low carbonation and a definite warming sensation.
D: This beer has indeed earned it's name. Quite a *great* beer that I'd love to have again. Yes, I know it was an awful joke. 697 characterswomencantsail, Mar 03, 2010

Pours a clear dark reddish-brown color with minimal head and lacing.
Aroma is really incredible: vanilla, oak, caramel, and bourbon. Smells really, really good.
The flavor, however, is a whole other level. So much going on there. The base barleywine is amazing, and the -bal aging adds a whole other element to it. Some crazy flavors in this one. Caramel, toffee, rich vanilla bean, oak, bourbon, sweet cake batter, marzipan, almonds...just a lot to it.
Full bodied with soft carbonation and an incredibly smooth and creamy mouthfeel.
Drinkability is through the roof for a -bal aged beer of this strength. This was definitely best of show for me. Just incredible. Possibly the best barleywine I've ever had. I can't believe this beer isn't in the Top 100. 834 charactersnickd717, Feb 17, 2010

Pours a clear caramel brown, not much of a head, just some lacing around the sides. The smell explodes with molasses, brown sugar, and whiskey. The taste is rich and sweet. Powdery sugar, and a sugary burnt marshmallow finish on the back of the palate. Although it's a comopletely different beer, the explosion of sweetness and the specific sugary aspect to this was SO similar in my mind to Black Tuesday. It was really amazing. For a sipping beer Alpine did a great job here. 542 charactersMiScusi, Feb 12, 2010

Scent of caramel, sweet bourbon, oak, a touch of brandy, sugars, grain, and faint alcohol. The alcohol is surprisingly hidded in this wonderful aroma.
Taste of strong sugars, caramel, sweet bourbon, oak, earth, nuts, and light alcohol. Strong and complex, not nearly as overpowering as I was expecting.
Mouthfeel is smooth and heavy bodied with a very light carbonation, excellent. 440 characterspaco1029384756, Feb 08, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412 oz bottle into a snifter. Big thanks to srandycarter for a bottle of this in trade. 
Pours a deep amber/near brown color, with a finger of light tan foamy head. This fizzles down pretty readily, with just a thin looking retention around the edges, but this still leaves a decent little amount of spotty lace down the sides of the glass. Yeah, I would say that the Bourbon and Barleywine have married each other quite nicely in the aroma. I'm getting caramel, butterscotch, burnt molasses, a little bit of plum and fig, and sweet, sweet, notes of vanilla. This is mostly sticky sweet in the nose but I'm also picking up some underlying roast, smoke, and even a touch of char from the barrel. Some lighter but still bright smelling green tannic character hangs on the edges of this, actually helping balance out some of the sweeter tones. There is some beefy warmth present as well but it mostly serves to add some thickness to the flavors. 
The taste is pretty much on the same page as the aroma. Notes of caramel, toffee, smoky molasses, some dark cherries and plums (which REALLY emerges as this warms), and an underpinning of char and roast all at the forefront here. Some hops do tickle the rear of the profile but what absolutely makes this; is the silky sweet flush of butterscotch and vanilla flavors across the backend, where in mingles with some deep woody dryness. The mouthfeel is full, thick, chewy, and viscous, just coating the tongue and lips with warm sticky liquid. Speaking of the warmth, that is exactly the way that this stays. Warm but never overly hot, which is very hard to believe with a 14% ABV on this. Pretty spectacular feel, with this coming off much more like it's in the 10% range. 
This was some pretty impressive stuff. Wonderful melding of flavors here between the beer & barrel; and the feel and drinkibility on this were pretty awesome for the size. I'd love to tuck a few more of these away for cellaring, as this is one that's only going to get even better with time. 2,010 charactersKegatron, Feb 03, 2010

12oz. brown bottle poured into a GLBC Christmas Ale snifter.
A: Pours a murky brown with orangish amber tinting in the light. Pours kind of thin. A rough pour gets about a 1/4 inch of spritzy head that dies immediately... I'd assume this spent plenty of time in the barrel. No lacing but some oily streaks.
S: Healthy dose of bourbon but even more massive is the huge dank barrel presence. Lots of earthy, dank oak. Some vanilla and molasses sweetness, maybe some pure maple syrup notes. Very woody. Listed as an American BW but I get great aged English Barleywine notes. The bourbon becomes even more potent as it warms.
T/M: Yow. Lots going on here. Plenty of bourbon along with some stronger alcohol complexity and a very satisfying warmth. More of the light molasses and maple flavors, some vanilla sweetness, caramel, toffee, dark fruits etc. Some faded hops, but I still don't know about American BW. I get loads of rich, alcohol soaked dark fruits as I swallow. I also get a sharp sweetness after I swallow, which is a minor flaw that is somewhat covered up by everything else that is going on. Body is actually pretty thin, which is my biggest complaint. It's only about medium light, which seems pretty far off the mark. Carbonation is light, which fits the style well, but doesn't do a hole lot with the lighter body. It actually reminds me of sipping a bourbon or scotch.
D: Massive ABV and a bit of a mouthfeel issue. Pretty damn tasty, though. If you're looking for a 'kick you in the teeth' beer, then this fits the bill very nicely. If you're looking for something complex and subtle... well this could still be for you because there is plenty to find, but the mouthfeel issues really hurt what they were trying to do and turn this from what could have been an absolutely stunning beer to a, still respectable, tasty treat. 1,968 characterspwoods, Feb 03, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Hophead84 for giving me a bottle of this most excellent beer.
Pours a rich orange-ish amber-y color. Just a few wisps of bubbles here and there and the barest hint of a crust of foam (that vanishes as rapidly as my optimism towards life did when I reached puberty). 
Smells glorious. Rich butterscotch, toffee, caramel, and dark fruits notes along with a hint, just a hint, of citrus. And bourbon, too, of course. A luscious brown sugary bourbon.
Phenomenal flavor. More toffee, more butterscotch, bourbon, notes of oak/wood that ripple along the deep, enticing flavor. It's a sweet beer, but there is a tang of hops to it ... not much though. The fruits and deep brown sugary malt really blend together fantastically, and the bourbon just tops it all off.
Dangerously drinkable, nice juicy/thick mouthfeel. 821 charactersOverlord, Jan 31, 2010

Bottle received in a trade with ArthurPendragon. Thanks man. Poured into a snifter, the beer is dark brown with crimson highlights and a small head.
The nose is very rich, with notes of dark toffee, brown sugar, butterscotch, vanilla, caramel, and prominent bourbon. The dried fruit character is similar to figs, dates, prunes, and perhaps plums. A faint nuttiness is present. I've not encountered anything else like it. Very unique and very nice. The 14% is well hidden. Intoxicating. A light oxidation quality is similar to sherry. Rich and unabashed.
The flavor is even richer than the aroma, if that can be believed. Big boozey bourbon notes are in communion with caramel, brown sugar cookies, butterscotch, toffee, molasses, vanilla, dates, figs, plums, and prunes. The combination of toffee and nuttiness is not unlike peanut brittle. Sherry-like oxidation is graceful. The alcohol is very well hidden in the bottle. I didn't find that to be the case with the draught version. Bow before this beast. I think 6oz would be a perfect serving size, and I have double the number before me. I definitely should have split this with another. This is very well done. Seek it out. 1,190 charactersHopHead84, Jan 26, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Received this brew from JessetheHutt in a nice little trade. I loves me a good Barleywine, especially when they're barrel aged. Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip.
Appearance- Pours a dark crimson brown with a fairly small off-white foamy head. A small collar remains the entire beer but not a spot on the cap. No lacing what-so-ever as well.
Smell- Intensely rich and super pungent as the barrel is wonderfully noticeable and full of goodness. The brown sugar and caramel are abundant as is a light oak and vanilla. Almost fruity as well with a dark cherry and cranberry like aspect along with a bit of raisin. The oak is just chocked full of vanilla and woody goodness, damn it smells good. Can't wait to take a sip of this bad boy.
Taste- Just as intense as I was hoping for as the vanilla and wood ooze out of this beauty. The caramel and toffee are ridiculously intense but thankfully not sweet. A few bourbon notes make their way through and as they mix with the alcohol it gets slightly warm. Some cherry and dark fruits are more than abundant as well as a bit of cola and tree bark. Something slightly medicinal and root like but honestly it's just so intense and so much going on, it's just part of the beer. The finish is full of caramel and vanilla and a touch of alcohol.
Mouthfeel- Thick and rich with a nice full bodied feel and light slick carbonation.
Drinkability- Really freaking good Barleywine. But saying that, the 14% is rather noticeable after a while. I like how the beer is super intense and chocked full of caramel but not sweet. A little bit of time will definitely help things and now I wish I would have traded for two. Thanks much Jess! 1,669 charactersyounger35, Jan 21, 2010

The pour was deep, dark brown, with no light penetrating it at all. Small head forms on top, just thin bubbles really before it settles back down and just lightly rings the outside of the glass throughout the rest of the session.
Aroma is the most intense thing i have come across. Rich butterscotch and toffee notes, huge buttery sweetness just rolling and tumbling through the air. Sublime. Warming brings out nice notes of vanilla and wood that seem to subtly filter through the air. The delicate butterscotch flavor seemed to be neverending. Sweet nectar of the gods here. Smooth, delicous perfection, this is nailed beyond what I could have imagined. simply sublime. 
Overall this is better then I could have hoped for. A superb version of a barrel aged barleywine. The vanilla and toffee notes from the barrel are perfect, mellow and subdued are the orginal hops from the beer, instead a sultry, sweet, and superb flavor have come forward. If every barrel aged beer I have is like this I would be a happy man. 1,219 charactersmikesgroove, Jan 17, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Great poured into my glass a dark brown color with almost no visible carbonation until I stopped pouring and a few strands of head formed before disappearing within the next minute or so. I don't expect a large creamy head from something in this alcohol range, but I expect more than this.
The aroma emanates maple, bourbon, booze, caramelized sugars, and a tad of peaty dryness. Pretty far out. Tastes of toffee, but not as sweet, peaty, slightly earthy. Finish has a full bitterness to it with a lingering bourbon and maple character. Yes, this one is big and boozy, but it is oh so good. Full in body, but maybe lighter than expected. Despite the lack of visible carbonation, there are plenty of tiny prickly bubbles to enhance the flavor. Very high quality example of the style. High drinkability for what it is, not quite perfect, but high. Good good stuff. 863 charactersvacax, Jan 14, 2010

A: Pours a murky, ruddy amber, with almost no head. Scattered bubbles on top with a VERY thin collar. Translucent honey edges. IMO it's too carbonated to be a proper English barleywine, but it looks inviting. 
S: Butterscotch, toffee, peanut brittle, a bit of soy-like oxidation, caramel, toast. There's something darkly savory that reminds me of that tamarind chutney commonly paired with samosas. 
T: Lots of butterscotch, toffee, peanut brittle, and caramel. It's pretty attenuated and doesn't leave a lot of lingering sweetness; there is a leathery savoriness (again, calling to mind tamarind chutney) throughout that helps balance the sugars. A hint of dry oxidation in the finish that works very well for this beer. There isn't much bourbon or wood at all, but vanilla does appear from time to time. As it warms, it gets more tannic and astringent. 
M: Chewy, warm, smooth. Viscous. Very restrained, with a mild and mellow heat (nowhere near 14%). 
D: This is really, really good. The barrel-aging is VERY subtle, and it hits the zone for me when it's at the upper range of the "recommended" drinking temperature. Lovely. I want more. It's pricey as hell at $11 a 12oz, but this may be one of the few beers where I think it's actually worth it, like a Hair of the Dog special release. [EDIT: I have been informed that this was $8 / 12oz at the release. That is well worth it, IMO.] 1,501 charactersArbitrator, Jan 12, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A fine example of an english barley wine. Murky chestnut color with only a hint of tan fizz that leaves a splotch of foam here and there.
Man noses on beers don't get much better than this. Everything comes through and adds depth and complexity to each other instead of one thing overpowering. Dried fruit character you would expect in fig and date with caramel and toffee undertones. Some red currant that then leads into some woodsy aromas and that sweet bourbon scent. Just a great smelling bw.
Ahhhh why I love English barley wines so much on top of that add bourbon barrel aging and you have one of the best beers I've tried in a long long while. A dessert style beer very sweet with mission fig, rum soaked rasins, caramel, date, currant, bourbon, vanilla, alcohol burn, a perfect tingly mouthfeel from a hint of carbonation that adds to the complexity. Slight oxidation and sherry quality. Christ this is good. 919 charactersmcallister, Jan 10, 2010

I am to bourbon barrel barleywines what Nelly is to cornrows - a sucker.
Pours hazy garnet/brown in color with ample tan carbonation. Smells of bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, and lots of toffee, among others. I like it, but the buttery toffee component is a little too much for my taste - reminds me a bit of Olde Bluehair's smell. Taste is outstanding - those same toffee, bourbon, raisin and brown sugar qualities are all quite strong, and blend together well. Not hoppy at all, this sits on the line where barleywines end and old ales begin. Mouthfeel is thick, sticky, coating, and well-supported by ample carbonation. At 14%, I was expecting to have difficulty drinking this, but those concerns proved unfounded. 819 characterswaltonc, Jan 09, 2010

S: RIch caramel notes upfront along with some biscuits, also a nice coconut and almost note is present and very enjoyable, maybe a little maple syrup as well. can definitely smell the wood and some vanilla and bourbon
T:It starts off very vanilla tasting with hints of oak and then caramel. A big load of biscuits is noticable. As it sits in my mouth I can also detect some toasted nuts. What is strange is some of the sips though are just straight booze which is a bit unpleasant
M: Some heat is present on this one and it could surely use a bit of time in the cellar, there is also a syrupy quality to it
D: I look forward to trying this one again in a year. I split the bottle with someone else and that was fine by me 882 charactersmikey711, Jan 07, 2010

3.61/5  rDev -18.5%look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Purchased from the source and shared with the very lovely Aimstatus; poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Bruery tulip glass at 52 degrees. 
A: An opaque brown body that exhibited absolutely no head or lace-like qualities. I contribute this to the high alcohol by volume, but still, not quite what I had anticipated for this beer. 
S: Tons of bourbon/whiskey, brown sugar, and molasses seem to be the main components along with a strong alcohol presence. In many ways, the barrel aroma coming off this beer reminded of Lost Abbey's Bourbon Angel Share. 
T: Bourbon sweetness, brown sugar, molasses, and perhaps some vanilla from the barrel. The beer also comes off as being a bit "green"; hints of green apple/acetaldehyde characteristics. The alcohol is hidden very well. 
M: You can feel some of the sugars sit on the palate, which I guess in some ways adds some body...but overall...a bit dry and thin throughout most parts. 
D: Even though I enjoyed the many flavors this beer possessed, I found myself only able to finish my 6-8 oz. pour. 
Overall: If cellared correctly, this beer could age beautifully. A try it beer. Cheers! 1,136 charactersOlieIPA, Dec 30, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Made a pilgrimage to Alpine Brewery during the holiday season...bought a bottle of great and two growlers (irish red and exponential hoppiness...)
Drank the great from a tulip glass (shared the 12 oz with my bro in law)
Appearance: deep brown, not much head, very little carbonation
Smell: like a decent whiskey. It smells like you are about to drink hard liquor. Not offensive
Taste: the smell creates the expectation of hard liquor, but the taste is only a suggestion...has the complexity and subtlety of a quad, but minus the spiceness or subtle sweetness (at least the belgian quads I have drank have those 2 qualities). 
Mouthfeel: packs a wallop in the mouth, only 6 oz left a lasting impression..
Drinkability: only one can be drunk at a time...
Overall: it is worth a taste, but would not be a star beer if you were planning a beer party. It, however, rivals angel's share 
Perhaps a cigar and a taster of this beer is in order! 944 charactersunseenbyyou, Dec 29, 2009
3.92/5  rDev -11.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured this one into a tumbler. Beer pours with no head. Liquid looks like a cola brown with red highlights. Shows minimal carbonation.
This beer smells sweet. Lots of brown sugar, maple syrup, and bourbon. 
This beer starts off with rich toffee,caramel, brown sugar and finishes w/ a kick of bourbon heat and lingering bitterness. I'm enjoying the taste, but I am already wondering what a year or two will do for this bottle.
Good mouthfeel, but felt a little thin, would of liked a little more body on this one, understandable though due to the high ABV.
I enjoyed this BA barleywine. The 14 % definitly limits how much I of this I would drink, but this is one of the more enjoyable barleywine I have had. Will try another bottle of great in a year or two. 762 characterssteadydose, Dec 26, 2009
4.09/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Pours a deep mahogany hue with little to no head.
S- Very sweet, lots of brown sugar, fig, nice bourbon aroma.
T- Extremely sweet all the way through, as in the nose there is a ton of brown sugar, dark fruits, smokiness, that leads to a slight hop bitterness / alcohol bite. The barrel characteristics are fairly subdued but it works out good for this beer.
M- Thick with medium carbonation.
D- This was a decadent desert beer. I split the 12 oz and loved it but dont think I could drink much more than that. 515 charactersLothore, Dec 25, 2009
4.14/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4After much anticipation, I've finally got the opportunity to try this offering from Alpine, due to their recent release. 
After time to warm to room temp, Great poured to my glass a brown/reddish hue with nearly no head. With my glass held to light, this beer appears deep, almost ruby, red. 
At first nose, I notice a very noticeable, but not overwhelming bourbon aroma. Other notes of molasses and rich malt abound. Sweet, sugary smells arise from the glass, as well. Complex smell profile keeps my nose in the glass throughout my trial of Great. 
At taste, I find a bit of crushed red grapes, with more bourbon familiarity. Heavy, but balanced malt tastes last from beginning to end. Finishes on my palate with a sugary bite. 
Decent consistency at mouthfeel. A bit watery for my taste, but still nice. Very well balanced flavors and body, with a great alcohol warming effect without being overtaken by this 14% beast. I was very impressed with this beer and would love to put this side by side with other barrel-aged barleywines. Something tells me time will improve this "great" beer, too. 1,098 charactersd0ggnate, Dec 23, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Bruery snifter.
Pours a redish brown with almost no head, due to the high alcohol content. Intense swirling yields next to no effect, some head does form but there is absolutely zero lace. Upon further swirling it lends nothing at all. 
Smells of sweet bourbon with very mild hops present. There's a nice butterscotch sweetness which combines with the pungent smell of bourbon and somewhat masks the smell of the malts.
Tastes strongly of bourbon with notes of butterscotch and toffee. It's smooth and has subtle bitter notes . Sweetness is evident, but not overpowering. There's a mild head present from the alcohol and you can feel it throughout the mouth.
This feels like it could benefit from a few years and I am very excited to see how it matures! 790 charactersradshoesbro, Dec 20, 2009

A: Pours a nice amber hue with tones of gold showing through. The small is very small yet exhibits GREAT retention. Nice big chunks of lace left behind.
S: Huge barrel aromas on this one. Fresh cut oak mingles with vanilla. Hints of caramel malt, molasses, and sweet brown sugar.
T: WOW I &#9829; this beer. You would think with the age the barrel qualites would have died down but this one smacks you in the face in such a good way. Bold barrel qualities with tons of oak and vanilla right up front. Very light bourbon notes peek thru giving just a hint at the ABV. The finish is nice and sweet with layers of brown sugar, gooey toffee, and a light pine bite.
M: Full in body, very smooth. I really grabs the mouth which really lets you enjoy the GREATness.
D: It's well....GREAT. One of the most complex and tasty beers I have ever tried. The barrel qualities while being bold yet balanced. Quite possibly the best use of a barrel when it comes to beer.
Thanks Dave you my friend are in fact GREAT... same goes for the beer. 1,178 characterstpd975, Feb 01, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375ml bottle at 53 degrees. A New Years eve prelude to the evenings festivities.
Pours clear dark copper with an inch-plus head of beige. Retention is decent with the head falling slowly to reveal a solid skim coat on the surface. Chubby dots of smeared lacework cling to the tulip glass.
Aromatics lead off with bourbon-spiked doughy malt and ripe fruit.
Heavy on the Jack Daniels with a substantial malt backbone to keep things in check. Peppery fusels and proofed dough with a grapefruit spritz.
On the thick side of medium bodied. Quite chewy and thick, with a pillowy, lush mouthfeel.
A tart vineousity starts the palate, followed by ripe malt, boozy whiskey heat, and some puckering grapefruit.
Hints of red wine, vanilla, oaky tannins, and dusty boards follow through. Bitterness is firm, but lies somewhere between English and American Barleywine territory.
Finishes with a lingering wine-like tartness, fading dough, and a building, peppery heat.
The vinousity in this beer is a real treat, and adds a complexity that I love. The doughy malt adds a great freshness to the mix, even though the bottle is almost two years old.
The Whiskey character is quite full, and you can tell this is all barrel-aged.
Similar to my all-time favorite Barelywine (Arctic Devil), but more complex with the vineousity.
Yum..And thanks to Joey for the hook up..SD style. 1,368 charactersbrewandbbq, Dec 31, 2008

An aggressive pour produces a short-lived fizzy head that dissipates almost immediately to remnants of a ring over a bright, cloudy caramel orange body. No lacing to speak of.
Big smells of the barrel-aging with oak and vanilla up front. There is a bit of caramel and fruit sweetness in the background, prunes and raisins, and lots of booze as well.
The taste has the sweet caramel malts and raisins up front before giving way to the oak and bourbon which leave a tingly finish on the tongue.
The mouthfeel is slick with little carbonation and coats the mouth in rich dessert-like decadence.
This is one for sipping all evening long, though the alcohol is fairly well-hidden given the ABV. A big, complex and damn tasty beer. Thanks again to Derek for this rarity. 845 charactersgford217, Nov 17, 2008
4.43/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle purchased at the brewery 10/06 consumed Feb. 9th, 2007. After pulling the foil off I noticed this puppy was filled to within a quarter inch of the cap so 0.375L+(that's good for me, eh). Pours slightly hazy brown with orange highlights. The tan head dissipated in under a minute. The aroma is pretty strong with caramel, alcohol, dark fruitiness, molasses, wood planks and just a hint of whiskey. Wow, I was expecting a more aggressive taste from this big beer. It starts off with a nice Barleywine date and cherry dark fruitiness mix with sweet caramel and toffee. About midway the whiskey, vanilla and oak notes surface. There's also light hints of alcohol and grape tartness. From midway on this beer gives a nice warming feeling that seems comforting. Great sipping beer.
Re-rate on 10/29/07. Pours a clear copper to brown color with lasting thin tan head. The aroma is up in your face big and bold with the aroma of a oak paneled shed followed by sweet creamy caramel candy and some chocolate malts. It also has a sizable load of fruity esters with prunes, dates and a bucket of raisins. The alcohol is not all that well hidden for a 10% beer. But for this beers big ABV it isn't too bad. The flavor is just as bold as the aroma with a whack in the face by a freshly milled oak plank followed quickly by red wine grapes, red wine tannins mixed with rich caramel candy. The alcohol is there too. Nice. Another decade of age could see this good beer turn truly great. 1,478 charactersBigMcLargeHuge, Nov 17, 2008
4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cola brown to amber in color, clear, with a small cream head that quickly recedes to a ring. Aromas are strong of the barrel ageing. Salty, a deep leatheriness, woodiness, and a good booziness are most prominent. There are sweet pruny malts in the background, more subdued under the effects of the barrel. Agitation reveals more of the deep leather, oak, and bourbon notes, you can almost smell the inside of a barrel. Taste is a flash of rich maltiness up front followed by the booziness, leather and grapes/raisins, and finishing oaky and dry, a boozy bite warms the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is medium, low carbonation keeps it somewhat slick, dry on the tongue in the aftertaste and warming. This is one of those beers for me where from the first smell I am taken in, my pen is writing furiously rather than searching for aromas and flavors. I'd love to try the good, i am sure it is an outstanding barleywine based on this sample. I hope that alpine produces this again in the future, outstanding beer. 1,019 charactershoppymeal, Jul 23, 2007
3.8/5  rDev -14.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4From the bottle at Spuyten Duyvil in Brooklyn, New York. Light bronze color. Unfortunately, it has a very mild nose overall, but it does show some barrel contribution (coconut, toasted oak, vanilla), very mild, piney aroma hops and a caramel laden malty aspect. Extremely well hidden alcohol, shockingly hidden beyond belief, quite honestly, yet it isnt quite as rich as I had hoped. Nice blending of butter toffeeish malt, with the barrel contribution quite profound, with toasted oak and vanilla flavors. Creamy, big full body, yet lacking in texture in a way. Still pretty delicious overall, although I did expect a bit more. 630 charactersCrosling, Apr 15, 2007
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Alpine Barrel Aged Great: 14% ABV, 375mL foil wrapped bottle. $7.50 limited to something like 40 cases.
Appearance: Clear Dark Amber, not much head nor carbonation. Looks like a glass of fine bourbon.
Smell: Holy Fire Cheifs. This smells like a Jack on the rocks. There are layers of sweet bourbon, burnt cherries, and a large presence of alcohol.
Taste: Barrel Aged Barleywine should be illegal. This stuff is beer?? I thoroughly enjoy the compexities of the oak aging, there are overtones of dark ripe cherries and sweet caramel. This beer took everything good out of the barrel. 
Mouthfeel: Very viscous and decadent. I get the impression that I need a fine cigar or a chocolate truffle to compete. Amazing beer.
Drinkability: A beer to be sipped and savored. You will need about an hour to really enjoy this beer to its fullest. As it warms, there are huge sweet oaking perfections coming out.
I should have bought a case. This beer will be amazing in a few more years. A work of art and Pat McIlhenney deserves all the thanks. Given the time involved in making this $7.50 is a bargin. More!! 1,114 charactersLongBeachHopHead, Feb 24, 2007
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I've had this on tap a few times last month and thought I'd try the bottled version. Poured from a 375 ml. green glass bottle into a Chimay snifter is apricot to murky brown with 1/4" of ivory foam. The foam settles quickly, although the carbonation is adequate for this barrel-aged beauty.
Very sweet and booze laden to the nose, dark ripe fruits, apricot, rockmelon, honeysuckle and bourbon come through strong. What you smell, is what you taste here...thick and somewhat chewy with big body and large ABV that doesn't seem as big and warming as it actually is. A very mellow and well aged brew here, not to mention very tasty.
If you want to try a big sipper with some complexity, look no further, this is very big and very well done. My kind of beer! 760 charactersscottoale, Dec 18, 2006

Huge bourbon flavors took me by surprise, I was not expecting so much whiskey flavor. Followed by cereal malt flavor, and a strange vegetable kind of aftertaste, I couldn't place it. This beer is like drinking bourbon but without the alhoholic sting. A heavy powerful brew, syrupy and sweet. Very glad I shared the bottle with someone.

Good presentation with no head at all due to almost no carbon dioxide so only a nice orange colored beer. Nose is lots of oak, burnt, alcoholic and bourbon like that overpowers most of the malts.
Taste is also very boubon like but with nice and smooth bitterness but high dosed. Overall well balanced but all tastecomponents double and extra; great beer to sip but be aware of the 14% as it still is quiet drinkable. 458 characterspaterlodie, Mar 30, 2006

Aroma: Bourbon, grassy hops, vanilla and oak. Great combo on the nose. 
Taste: Melons soaked in alcohol come to mind. Sweet bourbon. Vanilla. Cedar. Resinous hops. Toffee like malts. 
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: For 14%, it's not that alcoholic in the mouth. Medium bodied. Lightly carbonated. This one has a good "Returnability" factor to it. Something I'd return to without hesitation.

It has a very strong malty, caramel like aroma. The alcohol content is very present in the aroma. Not much in the way of hops. Just a big malty alcoholic aroma.
This beer has a very sweet taste. The alcohol content is very present in the flavor. It warms on the way down. It has a slight fruity taste to it. It has slight wine like flavors. Also, it tastes ever so slightly like bourbon.
This beer is quite thick. It is not very carbonated. It is full bodied. It leaves a stroms alcoholic, sweet aftertaste.
This beer would make a poor session beer. It is way too high in alcohol to drink all night. Also, it is very aggressive. It would wear thin very quickly. As far as a single glass, this beer lives up to its name. It was great. 865 charactersOStrungT, Dec 15, 2005

Poures a bight reddish orange with yellow highlights. Nice froathy tan head bubbly lacing. Quite a bit of carbonation.
Very strong malt smell and aroma like red wine. I can smell the bouron. 
Very sweet thick maltness on the palate. Fruity, grapes, raisins, grapefruit. Nice spice to it. Very strong dry whiskey bitter finish almost burns going down. I can feel the warmth of the ABV pretty quick. Numbs the tongue.

4.44/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: A gorgeously decadent thick gold colored dimpled foil covers the upper slopes of the 375ml dark green bottle. Sealed with a large shiny crown cap of the size often found on larger 750ml bottles, in fact when I examine the whole bottle; it seems like a miniaturized 75cl in so many ways, including the dimpled base.
The normal colorful Alpine label has been shrunk inside an upside down droopy curve for this offering. The rest of the label has a brown background featuring as assortment of white oak barrels. Labeled simply as We Call It GREAT and described as a Barrel Aged Barley wine. The right hand side of the label is set aside for the promotional blurb; Freshly emptied oak barrels from a famous Tennessee distillery were used to carefully age this strong Alpine Style Barley wine. SoDrink Alpine or Go To Bed!. Claims to clock in at a whopping 14% Alc. By Vol. 
If you ever got the Pizza Port Carlsbad Strong Ale Festival in 2004...it is worthy to note that this is the Alpine 'Good' that was on sale, but aged in Jack Daniels Casks, interestingly the 'Good' at the PP-SAF was listed at 17% !
Appearance: Slow thick pour fails to wake the sleepy carbonation from its long hibernation. Thick viscous dark amber body has a low grade scorched orange shimmering torso. Light wispy tan head soon breaks, to say it gives in quickly is an understatement - the head disappears faster than a French surrender. Extremely low levels of conditioning, but who cares!? This baby is to all intents and purposes liquor and I for one dont mind if it resembles one. 
Nose: Immensely pungent, rising vanilla beans leap out of the glass like hot Volcanic larva being projected skyward. It runs through an explosive 18 year old Single Malt whisky. Rich and deep this one is a real sexy snifter.
Taste: Lots of fresh woody oak threads through a warming scotch whiskey entrance. The sour mash starts to take the edge off the alcohol which never gets rowdy, but the ending is soothing, light caramel and a spicy pepper like malt laden dark fruitiness. Ooh this is luxurious. How can I describe thiswell its like being in a 400 year old London Gentlemens Club sinking into a high backed old leather chair with a top end Brandy warming in its Goblet as you gently swirl it in the open palm of your left hand, you listen to the crackling open coal fire whilst basking in its warming glow, all the time feasting of the calming blue smoke odors of an expensive Cigar which accompany the riveting reminiscing stories of shooting Tigers with your Old Etonian Chums and the Viceroy of India back in the good old days.. Jolly Good Show Old Chap!!...You know its an out of date concept, a guilty pleasure, but fuck it, because if you had the chance you know you would, damn if it isnt great, pardon the pun, to have the privilege to do so at least once.
Mouthfeel: More body than an East German female Shot-putter. Yet given its high end strength and barrel aging, I find this to be very smooth, the warming only starts in the latter third, whilst the real bite to this one is delayed well into the swallow, and even then, like a quality Tequila, it is one of those nice late kick in the balls that you dont really mind. Warming in a snuggly way.
Drinkability: 14%...!!! This is a very, very, very dangerous Barley wine that is smooth, silky, soothing and seriously easy to sink.
Overall: Nicely put together and a fine libation. Next time Im down that way I will be picking up some more Growlers of the fine Alpine brews and maybe, just maybe, if there are any bottles of these babies left, or some of the new batch, Im getting some more. You know this one will cellar well. 
The 'Good' is now "Great", but it's not Bad and definitely ain't Ugly!!!
A seriously big "MAHALO" to AleOha for this guilty treat. 3,861 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Oct 06, 2005
