I have had a few other sours from RR but this is my least favorite to date. not as sour or as oaky as i expected. more malty with hints of apple and pears. very mild peppery on the back end and a not so sharp sour zing. would probably try again if from a different patch or aged much longer. 343 charactersStoutFox, May 08, 2017

Pretty glowing orange, no head or lacing.
Funk, apricot, sweetness. 
Oak, lemon peel, orange, apricot, dry tannin notes. Amazing how there is so much fruit in the smell and taste and yet there is none. There are sours that are brewed with fruit that taste less fruity than this.
Medium carbonation, great balance between the sweet and sour, and perfect amounts of each. Dry tart finish. Session worthy. The fact that this is almost ten years old and tastes this phenomenal is really exciting for the ageablity of RR wilds.

Pours pale straw gold, clear with half inch head that dissipates to nothing
Vinuous, with the chardonnay barrel prominent.  Not a ton of funk
Acid up front, with some lemon peel, and white grape the dominant flavors.  Lacto dominant.  Bright clean and fresh flavors, not overly complex
Light and refreshing feel with a light spritz of carb
overall tasty.  Way better than its american peers, and moving toward the classic lambics.  Not as good as the Belgians, but one of the best american wilds I have had 529 characterspagriley, Mar 23, 2016

Look: Straw colored, slight haze, more in the second glass, I assume from a bit of the sediment sneaking out.  A bit fizzy with a foamy head.  The bubbles pop fast and settles into a small ring around the glass.
Smell: Citrus zest, tartness, earthy oak, a bit of dank funk.
Taste: Quite tart, hint of crisp white wine, sour lemon juice, sour but not puckering or unpleasant.  The earthiness from the oak cleans everything up and balances the flavors nicely.
Feel: Light bodied, active carbonation, effervescent.
Overall: Blissful, clean flavors for something that should be hard to taste clean.  Dry, tart, earthy and inviting all at the same time. 683 charactersjhavs, Mar 19, 2016

A: Pours a hazy orange with no head, not seeing much carbonation, no lacing, no head retention, looks like hazy orange juice. 
A: Sour vinegar, hints of lemon zest, tart, oak tannins, no alcohol on the nose, smells pretty solid.
T: Punch of vinegar sour and tartness up front, hint of lemon peel zest, oak from the barrel, finish is dry with more lemon and citrus notes reemerging, very balanced, ver drinkable.
M: Light bodied with a crisp dry finish, good amount of carbonation.
O: Very impressed, very balanced, not overly tart or sour, has a nice touch of lemon and citrus zest, some oak in the finish, a world class beer. 695 charactersBrolo75, Mar 03, 2016

Smell is very traditional, leather, some oak tannins, lemon zest, funk and tons of vinegar.  Taste for me was overpoweringly vinegar and acidity and I couldn't get the other flavors to marry with the heavy vinegar.  I'll revisit after 6 months to see how things are going. 377 charactersMLDucky, Feb 19, 2016

As far as taste goes batch 6 was far and away the best and is what my ratings represent.  Batch 7 in the beginning was a bit too yeasty but as it warmed the yeast got unpleasantly overpowering.  Batch 5 was very good but quit a bit drier and more astringent than the others.  Batch 6 was outstanding with just enough sweetness to offset the brilliant sour flavors.  All in all the beer didn't live up to my overly high expectations and memory of the last time I drank batch 6 but it's still an outstanding beer. 703 charactersDactrius, Jan 17, 2016

Lots of wooden, earthy, sour lemon, almost white wine and citrus notes.
Light body carries an immense puckering sour experience, wood in the background, later batches seem to up the citric mouthfeel a little more.  Mostly lemon though.  Similar to Temptation, this seems to be like a little less white wine than that but a little more concentrated in terms of its viscosity and sour factor. 544 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 01, 2016

Consumed: 10.2.15
A: 4.5 Pale golden-yellow. Slightly hazy. Minimal off-white head.
S: 4.25 Pretty mild. Lemon, funk, oak, and mild pepper. Almost like a gueuze with the volume turned down. Spontaneous fermentation still results in a classic Russian River quality, like temptation.
T: 4.5 Really nice balance of slightly sweet at the beginning to pleasantly tart in the middle and finish. More lemon, funk, oak and grass. Finish is slightly dry with little bitterness.
M: 4.5 Almost feels undercarbonated at first, but feels just right after a few sips. The beer is quite substantial for 6%, but the carb is just lively enough that it works.
O: 4.5 Pretty great sour from Russian river. Not quite as different from something like temptation as I was expecting, but that's definitely not a bad thing. 824 charactersTele, Nov 30, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Recent batch obtained in a trade and poured into a snifter. It pours a goldish color with small amount of head (fades quickly too). The smell definitely has barnyard funk, yeast, apples, grapes, pears, oak, etc. The taste is pretty tart with a small amount of sweetness on the back end. Has medium body with decent carbonation. Overall, this is a superb offering from RR and worth seeking out for sure; you will not be disappointed! Cheers! 440 characterstregan_20, Nov 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My own personal white whale that I finally was able to come across from the latest release. Bought 6 and plan on opening up a bottle every year to see the change it goes through.
A - Golden, head sort of quickly disappates which I was surprised with but fine by me.
S - Major funk going on and really can smell a barrel presence. Smells immensely citrusy and earthy.
T - Follows the nose and man, this is DAMN delicious. My mouth was watering the entire time and the only thing to quench was more of this beauty.
M - Quite carbonated even though the head disappeared quickly. Lasting carbonation that I would imagine will fade in time but will allow other flavor aspects to come through moreso.
Overall was extremely happy to pop this open via Facetime with my buddy who waited in line for me to acquire them. Is it the best Lambic I've ever had? Absofriekenlutely. 866 charactersHesscabob, Oct 22, 2015

My introduction to Beatification, though I can see why this used to be such a highly sought-after release. 
Heavy Brett flavor with nice carbonation, modest sourness, some funk and cheesiness on the palate, all quite nicely balanced with a lemon finish. 
A very nice beer that delivers on all fronts without overdoing any one thing. 350 charactersrodmanfor3, Oct 11, 2015

L: Golden Yellow, only slightly hazy, minimal head that goes away almost immediately. 
S: Pungent. A sweet fruity nose upfront with pears and citrus accompanied by a generous amount of sour funk.
T: Tangy stone fruit, lemon (quite tart), then the brett kicks in and bring the funk, slightly yeasty. Overall a nice balance of flavor. 
F: Long tart finish that goes through waves of lemon and wheat for a few minutes. 
O: A world class beer, phenomenal balance and unlike some of the heavier more robust sours that Russian River offers like consecration, beatification can easily be followed by another beatification. 644 characterscraftcraver, Oct 04, 2015

Pours a filtered, light yellow color and a fizzy, bubbly head, immediately dissapearing into small sheets of lacing.
Lower carbonated, with a very refreshing mouthfeel to it, due to fresh lemons and a balancing, wooden oak infusion. 
The aromas unfold just after popping open the bottle, filling the air in my room with a lovely, citrussy funkiness. Reveals even more ripe, juicy citrus when smelling at the actual beer, together with an immense tartness, bedded on glue, yogurt and old leather. Creates an interesting interplay between dough, soft old malts and prickly, crisp lemon, without becoming intriguingly complex.
The taste offers a good amount of lemon right from the very beginning, accompanied by easing, bready, musty malts and fermented wheat. Lemons get increasingly more body added, resulting in a very sour, funky tartness, almost numbing the front of my tongue during its peak. Finishes fruity, with fresh pressed lemons, revealing even lemon stones, as for how pronounced the fruit acidity gets, offering an acceptable dryness. 
The balancing oaky barrel vanishes completely during the beers finish, opening the palate up to pure, sour fruit lemonade. Hammers a bit too hard on the palate, regarding its acidic sourness, preventing the beer from showcasing its other, more subdued flavors. 1,336 charactersaleigator, Jun 05, 2015

Smell is divine- funk dominates with some tropical notes.   Taste wise it's pretty close to a gueuze, very lightly carbonated with the aforementioned fruit notes.   Really great, hopefully I can score myself a bottle sometime soon! 402 characterstmbgnicu, May 15, 2015

Batch #006, bottle date of 9/11/2013, poured into Perennial Societe Du Chene stem.
L: Pours semi-translucent yellow...about the same color as the label.  No foam, no lacing, close to zero carbonation.  (3.00)
S: Straight up funk, lemongrass, slight vinegar, tropical fruits, stone fruits.  Wonderful (4.75)
T: As with the smell, acidy, vinegary, unripe peaches, lemon zest, a bit of gueuze-esqe barnyardyness.  Pretty damn good, but I wish the bottle had some carbonation to liven up the flavor on my taste buds.  Also could use just a touch more (4.5)
F: Pretty good, but again its almost flat and doesn't really have much going on here.(4.0)
O: While extremely tasty, and without a doubt the best RR wild ale I have had to date, this one did not live up to my expectations.  I feel like years ago, this might have been the pinnacle of American sours, but now a days it takes much more than this to be mentioned in the best of the best.

L: Had a great pop on opening nice initial carbonation fades fast. Nice opaque straw yellow. Little to no lacing.
S: Impressive. Heavy fruity peach notes with a lot of geueze character. Funky and lightly acidic. Doesn't get any better.
T: Strong but balanced sour. Good amount of peach character. Lemon acid character and horse blanket. Oakey but overall could be more complex.
F: Nice tart and dry. Very clean but not too puckering. Could be more full.
O: This met my expectations. I have to put ddg ahead of this just on complexity but this is a solid beer worth seeking out. I'd like to try this fresh but a little age has been solid. Russian River delivers again. 750 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Apr 06, 2015

Hazy yellow with a white head that quickly disappears. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is basement must, citrus, especially lemon, tart sour grapes, vinegar, wood, and leather. Taste is a puckering sourness with citrus and vinegar notes, followed by some mellowing wood bitterness and earthy elements. A touch of citrus sweetness. Light-plus body, surprisingly creamy/thick but not overly so, just enough to coat the tongue, lively carbonation, long sour finish. 544 charactersSierraFlight, Mar 01, 2015

Slightly hazy golden body and white head which fizzles immediately down into a ring around the glass.
The aroma is heavy on the stone fruit aspect with peach and apricot. Pineapple with slight funk but more bright and fruity with some slight vanillin.
Really quite heavy on the sour and fruit on the flavor. Lemon, peach, apricot, pineapple, musty funk, and wood. Dry and light bodied.

4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Batch 6. 6% ABV
375 ml bottled 9/11/2013. Poured into a Russian River stemmed glass.
Appearance: Pours a bright golden yellow with less than a finger of a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly to a thin collar. Body is mostly clear with hight visible carbonation. 
Smell: Bright lemon, white grape, green apple, funk hay and oak. 
Taste: Light barnyard, hay, green apple, lemon and other citrus with some mild neutral oak. High acidic sourness that borders on mouth puckering. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied, and bit thin with medium lively carbonation. Finishes dry.
Overall: One of the best American spontaneously fermented beers I've had and probably the closest tasting to an actual lambic (though still not quite the same). Well worth seeking out. 755 charactersJonada, Feb 06, 2015

Smell - SOOOO much better.  Certainly doesn't smell like urine.  A nice fragrant sour bouquet.  Nectarines, grapes, apple cider, some funk.  Can't wait to dig in. - 4.5
Taste - T A R T!!!  If your looking for a mellow, delicate, balanced sour (Fou Foune), this ain't you beer.  It is amazingly tart. Taste follows the nose, but add in oak, hay. - 4.5
Mouthfeel - excellent. Dry, white wine finish.  Nicely (surprisingly) carbonated - the most delicate part of this beer. - 4.5
Overall - So glad I traded for this.  Not a daily drinker for me, but a nice occasional treat. - 4.5 778 charactersSweetChicken, Jan 22, 2015

Amazing how many different fruit and other aromas/flavors come out of this beer from the combination of bacteria and yeasts, without actually having any fruit. Pretty much every aspect of it was fantastic, down to the perfect mouth feel. It's not often outside of a big stout/barleywine that I say to myself "wow this beer has a great mouth feel!" but it was there, all right. 425 characterskrustster, Jan 20, 2015

A. Light straw color with shades of bright copper, great clarity, fine bubble egg shell head.  High carbonation. Prolific effervescence.
S. Big tart nose, with notes of apple cider vinegar, granny smith apples, sour yeast, sour bacteria, and neutral oak.
T. Follows the nose to the tee. Big funk presence and the oak is very well balanced with the sour yeast. I would say this is very sour.
M. Very smooth, high carbonation, light body.
O. I could drink this all day long.  It made me a little burpy but that goes with the territory. I'm a huge fan.  This is very well balanced and benefits from a little age. 638 charactersmacher0, Oct 24, 2014

The taste is strongly funk with a good sour bite.  Feel is a little harsher then I remember with a good bite but still fairly enjoyable.  One of the top American Wild beers. 289 charactersmrn1ceguy, Sep 27, 2014

Batch 05
A- Pours clear and golden with a half-finger of bright white tight foam. This recedes to a collar and leaves some lacing. Some nice alcohol legs are observed when swirled.
S- The aroma is very sour and there is a lot of Brett funk. Overripe apples, tart cherries, pineapple, and oak tannins. Some Granny Smith apple and lemony sourness. Very complex, refreshing, and inviting aroma!
T- Wow, this is warhead sour! Crazy amounts of cherry and lemon sourness. The oak tannins are the only thing restraining and mellowing the sourness. Very acidic and lactic. Refreshing, but bracingly sour!
M- The mouth feel is delicate, medium bodied, and lightly carbonated.
O- This is an excellent sour, though not for the uninitiated! Maybe lacking the complexity and subtleties needed to make it truly world class, but wonderful none-the-less! 876 charactersSadMachine, Aug 02, 2014

Pours with very little head. Hazy, light yellow in color. Smells fresh and tart. Fruity, flowery, and hints of vanilla. Wow, this is sour. What I get after that initial pucker is fresh citrus, earthiness, and a smooth vanilla oak aftertaste. This is one of the most flavorful beers I've ever had. The mouthfeel is light and bubbly. The natural fermentation yields a perfect feel. Overall I'm really impressed with this beer and I'm not a huge fan of sours. This is one of the best I've ever had. 592 charactersmattsdenney, Jul 15, 2014

Tastes bright citrus- grapefruit and lemon with crisp clean acidity. Tastes like the sour candies of your childhood. So complex and tart and the body on it is great. Just enough to hold up the acidity. Right up there with the most sour beers I’ve ever had and definitely one of the best I’ve had. 401 charactersjbaker67, Jun 20, 2014

A- a bright almost neon yellow with a thin head that never goes away. 
S- lots of peaches and pinneapple. Smells extremely sour. Lots of spices as well. Hard to pick out though. 
T- everything blends so well. The peaches and pinneapple and other tropical fruits come through very well. The sourness makes your cheeks pucker immediately and the acidity of the beer feels like its eating my teeth. There is a smoothness on the back end that really brings it together. 
M- a full beer that puckers your cheeks and leaves a strong sourness in your mouth. 
O- a very good sour. I find picking out flavors in sours are difficult but the taste and smell and everything about it are outstanding. 739 charactersmlhyatt, May 12, 2014

4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Single finger fizzy white head on a slightly hazy pale golden body. Aroma of Chardonnay, white grapes, lemon zest, funk, tropical fruit and nicely forbodes the level of tartness the taste has in store. The first sip has the salivary glands contracting and it's so tart initially it is almost bad but it's just enough to be perfect. As you get used to it the flavors pop with lemon, white wine, fruits, Chardonnay and Granny Smith sour apples. Oak is light. It's only knock for me is it lacks a little complexity likely because it is so tart the other flavors are lost. Crisp, light body with the sourness drying you out quite a bit. Another great sour from RR. Lives up to the hype and beyond. 693 characterskylehay2004, May 09, 2014

A: Pours a hazy opaque, yellow, slight orangish gold mix, the orangish gold mix is more of a hue as it closer resembles pineapple juice, nice and murky! No head when from the pour or after
This beer looks fantastic!
S: Sour! Earthy! Fruity! Sweet! Funky! So much complexity going on with this beer! I get some apples, pear, pineapple, straw, and all those lovely combinations of funky and sour bacteria! Perfection!
T: An immediate rush of tartness once it hits your palate, initial you get the tart, sour bacteria with a lovely, apple, pear, pineapple fruit combination, then it transitions to straw and funk, and finishes with a perfectly balanced combination of everything! The best part with this beer is it lingers and the flavor ever so slowly fades away, and when it's gone it leaves you begging for more! Absolutely stunning!
M: This category is perfectly executed as always with RR sours, slightly dry, light, hint oily, and incredibly crisp, and somewhat unexplainable on how good the mouthfeel really is for this style. Perfect!
O:Blown away, had high hopes for this beer, and it surpassed them by a mile! It is going to be hard to ever find a sour better than this! You must get this beer if you can! 1,323 charactersbpasquini, May 08, 2014

A- Pours a deep chardonnay golden yellow color. Has a very high wine like clarity. Small fizzy head that dissipated quickly. 
S- Lots of sour apple, some vinegar, some light vanilla, good amount of oak. some white wine character in there. 
T- Similar to aroma but amplified to an insane degree. Lots of tart lemon, sour apple, and vinegar. Finishes with a dry yeasty note. Has that old barn cellar thing that sours usually have. 
M- Medium-light the flavor makes this a sipper. 
O- This is one of the most sour beers I've had and if you're looking for something that delivers in the pucker department seek this one out. It is also somewhat too sour for me in my tastes. It's missing a bit of the subtlety that I got from Supplication. Still an amazing beer and if you want to test the limits of sour seek it out. 873 charactersPaulyB83, Apr 16, 2014

A- Pours a slighthly hazy, super carbonated, pineapple coloorred body with a fizzy white 2 finger head that reduces to a white ring. Leaves no lacing. 
S- The first thing I notice upon popping the cork is a strong champagne-like aroma, grapes and white wine. After pouring it and letting it sit, strong lactic tartness, leather, lemon juice, citrus zest, and a distinct earthiness. 
T- BOOM! The mouth puckering sourness that kept me seeking this beer out hits you the second it touches your tongue. Straight lemon juice, vinegar, sour apple hit you in face, followed by a earthy, leathery notes complimented by oak and subtle Belgian spice.
M- Crisp, refreshing, highly carbonated. Dry finish. 
I've been waiting to try this beer for almost 2 years now. What differentiates it from other Wild Ales I've tried is the mouth puckering sourness that it delivers. As with other RR sours, it was very well balanced and complex. This one's a winner. 1,053 charactersgcamparone, Apr 04, 2014

Acidic and vinous aromas, light wood, lemon, sour apple. 
Mouth puckering and delightful. It's such a fun beer for those that enjoy sour. Lemon, acidic, wood, tart. Bursts with flavor. 
Crisp and extremely sour on the palate. Abusive to the tongue. Sour like I'm going to get those little bumps on my tongue when I eat too many sour patch kids. 
Love, love, love this beer. It's in the discussion for my favorite of all time.

Russian River tulip
A: Pours out very pale yellow color. You can almost see right through it. Thin layer and collar of bright white head. Lots of carbonation streaming from the middle of the bell of the glass.
S: Funk. Brett. Oak. Lemon. Dry. Horse blanket. 
T: Up front you get that burst of sour funk. It attacks the tip of the tongue. Middle of the mouth it's more creamy than I was expecting. Getting some of the oak tannic character. Really like a Chardonnay mixed with the carbonation like a champagne. Finish is very dry and leaves you wanting another sip much like other sours.
M: Light bodied. Not as prickly on the tongue as I was expecting. 670 charactersinlimbo77, Mar 10, 2014

Pours to my tulip a light yellow golden color with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom. Aroma is nice tart lemon, yeast funk, some pleasant citrus-like sweetness, light vinegar (very light on that note), apricots, lots of lacto acidity. Flavor is a nicely balanced sweet and sour lemon, lots of lactic tartness, dry oak, dry dusty Geuze-like qualities yet a nice sweet citrus character to balance. Some wine like qualities with Sauvignon blanc type of acidity. Light bodied with high carbonation and a crisp finish. This is really nice, but I can’t ever see paying $18 for a small bottle myself. Differentiating sour beers is tough I guess. With that said no doubt I would drink this again. Yum. 800 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 09, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5After finding no time to make it up to the brewery to buy some bottles of this last December, imagine my surprise when, during a family visit to the brewery, that they were still tapping this! Couldn't ask for a better turn of events - this has been one of my all-time wants since I ever started getting into sours and gueuze beers. Batch 6. Poured into a tulip tumbler glass at the brewery.
Pours a faded amber color with some straw hues, as well as a slight golden glimmer when held against the light. Cloudy, with some noticeable carbonation at first that dies down alongside its initially frothy white head. Not much lacing, and if it weren't for its cloudy appearance it would retain the same look of a low alcoholic white wine. Hmm, previous batch pours (mainly from bottles) definitely indicated that this was more vinous looking in the past, but I'm not too concerned. Sour beers are very different from the bottle than they are on tap, and hopefully I'll be able to try a bottle of this to compare notes to.
Yeah, the aroma nails it, however - this is as good of an interpretation on the style as any world class gueuze I have tried from Belgium, and if this isn't enough reassurance that perhaps knowing how to make wine (as Vinnie does) isn't perhaps the best path to take before committing to brewing wild ales, I don't know what is. Huge notes of musty peaches, apricots, white raisins, and, of course, yellow apples and pears. A big dank cellar aroma is predominant, with notes of old, cold stone (I'm thinking slate), damp hay, leather, and a damp cloth aroma. This is brief, however, and the finish is filled with nice notes of toasted tobacco, vanilla, toffee, and a little bit of something floral, maybe herbal, from the fresh hops. Crisp, warm, and inviting. An excellent effort.
Wow, one sip and I'm immediately assured that this is one of the most drinkable wild ales being made in this country. This is so fruity, funky, sour, and yet so refreshing and comfortable to drink! At first, there's the large apple and pear notes, followed by some white nectarines and a bit of orange melon (all soured or under-ripe, of course), with some brief peppery sensations, as well as nice white floral notes. Sour and acetic, but also a bit lactic from the barrel aging. The funk then takes over in the middle of the mouth, delivering grassy, wet hay flavors that are earthy and quite mineral, with a crisp and cooling sensation at the same time. The finish is more funky, but also melds with the toffee, vanilla, and leather profile quite gracefully and balanced. Extremely creamy and filling from the yeast, but also crisp, and palate-cleansing - the white vinegar finish definitely does its work well. In spite of its acidity, this is gentle on the senses, and makes a terrifically approachable. Delicious stuff!
I knew other sours made by RR were already world-class, but this really took it home for me. This is not an easy beer to make, and to produce something that is so complex and yet so brightly textured and balanced when working with wild bacterial strains is nothing short of magic. For those who have had any doubt on the direction that wild beers are taking in America, try this one and be astonished. This is by far the leader of many beautiful things to come. I hope to get a bottle soon and compare some notes, and see how this changes over time. 3,378 charactersmagictacosinus, Mar 07, 2014

It is followed by a well-balanced pucker that doesn't have you reaching for the Tums. The finish is nice and astringent, which is the perfect lead in to the the next sip. Up there with Supplication as the best from Russian River. 453 charactersjjdc, Mar 05, 2014

This beer pours a beautiful clear golden straw body, same colour as the label, with a 1cm white frothy head that persists for a very long time. Its a very pretty looking beer, typical of Russian River. In fact, this reminds me of Sanctification.
The scent is basically straight up sourness. Lemon acidity. Smelling this beer- its so damn sour that my teeth starts getting eaten away, and I haven't even put this beer in my mouth yet. It is so acidic, vinegary sour that it burns the hell out of my Cranial Nerve 1 (the nerve responsible for our sense of smell). There is a nice woody, brett funky presence underlying this beer too. This is literally the sourest smelling beer I've ever had.. but deliciously so- there is nothing off-putting about this nose at all.
And man, this beer strips the enamel off my teeth. This is so damn sour. Even more sour than sucking on a ripe lemon. So mouthpuckeringly sour, it burns the hell out of my palate. We had Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, etc. that same night, and you would think our palate is destroyed. But I can still taste the sourness on the back of my palate, like 5 beers later. So sour, its amazing. It's got a good bit of zesty citrus sweetness that somehow balances out the sour so that it's not unpleasant at all. I don't know how Russian River does it, but they somehow made a beer that is way more sour than even highly concentrated vinegar yet is so pleasurable to drink. 
The mouthfeel on this is basically a medium bodied blonde with awesome carbonation and the most damn sour aftertaste. Its like my palate got stung the heck out of it, so now its expressing a permanent sour burn here. I get tons of heart burn from this beer... its so damn sour, its perfect. The only note here is that a mere 375ml bottle is going to be pretty tough to take down on your own.
This is the most sour beer I've ever had. I can't imagine it being any more sour. I thought Sanctification and Sour in the Rye were the sourest beers that I've had, but this one far outstrips them. Its such an amazing beer, perfect for sharing with 1 friend. And that friend had better be a good one! Highly recommend. Nice job Russian River, this beer is worth everything anyone would ever give up for it. Thanks again Brian, for extra'ing me an amazing beer.
Re-review: 375ml bottle of batch 006, bottled in 9/13/2013, opened today, 2/13/2014 at Voodoo Brewery. Poured into a Voodoo snifter. 5 months old. In contrast to the 19 month old batch 005, this one is a lot more complex and slightly less sour. More lemon, citrus, oak, white pepper in the nose as well as on the palate. Acidity is still there, at 7/10 while batch 005 was more of a 9/10. Just enough to make this incredibly mouthpuckering but without overcoming all the different complexities in the flavour. Highly recommend drinking fresh within a year for the full bouquet of flavours to enjoy.
Re-re-review, but not quite: 375ml genie bottle of PH1, served in a snifter glass 9/6/2015. Pours a darker, hazy orange body, a slight straw-pink hue, one finger white head with good retention, dropping into a medium collar. No lacing. Smells of orange zest, lemon, a lot of oak, funk, minerals. Gueuze-like in many ways. Significantly restrained acidity compared to fresher batches, more of the citrus. Flavour is very complex; more so than fresh Beat. Oak, funk, cobwebs, lemon, citrus, mild orange peel. Very clean and refined, yet still aggressive enough to provide that "wow" moment. It's done very well with time. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, softer carbonation, reasonably mouthpuckering oaky finish, clean. Overall- this is extremely tasty for such an old bottle. This batch of Beatification has done quite well and has added more complexity with time.
Yet another batch-related review- 375ml bottle of batch 007 bottled 3/25/2015; poured in a Russian River goblet glass on 11/14/2015. Pours a slightly hazy straw yellow body, hues of gold, fluffy one finger white head with nice retention, not much lacing. Eventually goes still as it always does. Smells of oak, an intense cobweb mustiness, a ton of acetic acid, lemon, a bit of earth. It's very acidic smelling fresh. The palate is similarly acetic, with a nice lemony bite, classic Beatification right there. Oak as well, cobwebs. It's not as funky as its Belgian counterparts, but apparently that comes with time (per PH1, anyway). Mouthfeel is there, medium bodied, good carbonation, refreshingly sour but with a slightly astringent orange peel that is a bit more astringent than in batches past. Might need some time to round out the edges; perhaps that's why Vinnie held back this release for so long. That being said, it's now drinking as well as it should be! 4,925 charactersStevedore, Feb 15, 2014

A: Slightly hazy yellow, some thin white bubbles on the surface
S: Very reminiscent of actual lambic - a very upfront brett funk, hay, wheat, I think I'm getting some of that infamous horse blanket. There's something in the funkiness aroma that you wouldn't expect to like but it is so intriguing and undeniably complex and enjoyable
T: Wow, a little more sour than your average sour. The mouth puckering aspect in the taste of this beer alone is a wild ride. Huge sour flavor with a big intensity at the very beginning that is felt by my tongue, cheeks and roof of my mouth. The intensity dies down but lingers in the background while you notice the sweet floral, hay like qualities of the malt balancing perfectly with the funk.
M: Just slightly dry, works with the flavors perfectly
O: I was not the least bit disapointed by this beer with the high hopes that I had for it. The sour aspect of this beer is very unique for an American beer. 974 charactersanteater, Feb 10, 2014

The color is golden with great clarity and thin white head that collapses. The smell is fainlty citrus with funky lemon lactic yet slight floral aroma with mild wood. The feel has a great balance of sourness with a light sweetness and dry quality in the finish.
The flavor is a mildly sour yet enjoyable lemony tart mixed with a woody tannic flavor and some malt toward the back. This was a great treat I can't wait to have this again. 475 charactersSlatetank, Feb 09, 2014

The aroma is straight lemon juice. Extremely tart. A bit of funk as well.
The flavor follows of that tartness in the front. It's quite aggressive and then moves onto a light wheat and biscuity malt hits in the middle as there is a second wave of aggressive tartness of lemon and pineapple juice. There's hints of funk throughout.
A well made beer but the tartness for me was a bit too aggressive. However, recently have Batch 5, I much preferred the restrained manner and less tart qualities in the beer. 560 charactersdar482, Feb 02, 2014

It is lighter than blonde and just barely lemon-tinted in the glass with a nice bright white head. Plenty of carbonation. The smell is complex. There is some tartness/acid scent but very funky to my nose. I get more funk than anything. Like preserved lemons maybe. The taste is sour on the front end but bright in the tartness. This tastes like a lemon sour patch kid to me. The sour is balanced so well and doesn't finish acetic. You get a bit of the wood and the sourness really smoothes out as this warms. I really enjoy lemons, so this beer really hits the spot. It's just this side of sour to not be completely thirst quenching, which is good because it's not like anybody has a big enough stash to throw back a few of these. Probably as balanced and as well made as any sour I've had. Slightly ahead of Cantillon Gueuze for me in terms of bright lemony lambic. 898 charactersPHBoiler, Jan 27, 2014

pours a murky pale yellow with a half inch white head that quickly dissipates. the smell is massively acidic and is just perfect. the taste starts out very sour and tart but then balances out so well with the funkiness and finishes so dry and awesome. an amazing sour beer...just about perfect in every way. carbonation and mouth feel are on point.

The head dissipates almost immediately, but looking down into the glass, there's a steady stream of bubbles rising up from the bottom like a geyser. 
S: A fantastic blast of citrus, lemon and funk right off the bat. Lemon zest, a touch of tropical fruit, maybe pineapple, dried apricot, vanilla and some spice mixed with earthy notes and good old horse blanket. Smells awesome.
T: Hits with a big tart, slightly acetic lemony twang that carries through all the way to mid-palate. Some underripe red cherry and lemon candy hit in the middle. Barnyard, wet hay, a touch of leather, vanilla and some oak. Sticks the finish. Intensely tart and lemony with a great lingering dryness. Like every RR sour I've had, the mouthfeel is impeccable. This is world class. 842 charactersnotchucknorris, Jan 23, 2014

Poured a bright golden yellow, nice two finger head with a somewhat aggressive pour. Smell is very sour, citrusy, lemon, oak. The taste is very sour, with a lot of lemon. Perhaps some oak, grass and pepper? on the backend, very dry, as well. Creamy mouthfeel with bubbles that coat the tongue and keep the tartness around for a while.

Poured into a standard tulip glass. 
Appearance: (4.5)
Pours a lightly hazed golden yellow with a mere wisp of a white head that immediately dissolves about as quickly as it formed. For a sour beer, this really has some nice clarity, it almost glows. 
Aroma: (4.75)
As soon as the beer is poured, a burst of clean, but very juicy citrus-y tartness makes it's presence known. The sourness is very lemon forward and doesn't come close to taking on an acetic, vinegar-y tone. Beneath this acidity are aromas of juicy, ripe apricots, peaches as well as some notes of white pepper. Being 100% spontaneously fermented, there is an earthiness, but it is very soft and supple, really just providing some nice balance to the bright nose. AS soon as the beer warms, some of the vinous barrel tones become apparent; predominately just a soft vanilla undertone. 
Taste: (4.75)
As the beer lands on your palate, you're hit by a wave of juicy acidity; mostly lemon juice and pineapple juice. Layered underneath this sourness is a soft bedding of light stone fruits; apricot flesh, ripe peaches. These fruity components are supported by a light coating of barnyard funk; damp earth, wet hay. The beer finishes very dry and tart with long lingering notes of lemon juice and peel, pineapple, apricot, leather and a buttery, vanilla tone from the barrels. 
Mouthfeel:(4.5)
Medium bodied, with moderate to high carbonation. 
Overall: (4.5)
Beatification is Russian River's 100% spontaneously fermented sour that is made in homage to some of the great Lambic producer's of Belgium; Cantillion, Drie Fontenien, etc. The finished product is extremely complex and highly recommended. 1,692 charactersflayedandskinned, Jan 08, 2014

This pours a champagne orange-golden, with an incredibly bright white cap of foam. 
The aroma is unmistakably tart, with a lemony-orange hop character. Dry and peppery, with a tart sourness that pops on the palate. Incredible. 323 characterselNopalero, Jan 06, 2014

On tap, poured into Belgian goblet. 
A: Light apricot-orange, light opacity with bubbly effervescence. Not a trace of lacing. 
S: Tart front, unripe fruit and lemony vinegar. A trace of hop snap cuts the sour bouquet. 
T: Again, tart as can be upfront while remaining palatable. Slightly sweet unripe berries play against an oaky dryness, touch of lingering cherry sweetness. Plenty of lemony pucker, and the whole experience is singular on the palate. Notes of white pepper dry toward the short, sour finish. 
M: Super-effervescent and light bodied. Bounces off the palate. 778 charactersrand, Dec 29, 2013

Pours a hazy gold color with a small white head which fades quickly, leaving a small disc of foam. The aroma has tart green apples, lemons, barnyard funk, yeast, grapes, and oak. 
Tastes very tart, with a mild amount of sweetness at the end. I mean that in a good way. Has the flavors of tart green apples, lemons, yeast, grapes, oak, and pears. 
Medium bodied with average carbonation. Has a tart green apple aftertaste, and is extremely drinkable. Finishes dry. I went through a lot of trouble to get this beer, and may need to go through the trouble again, as this beer is definitely worth it. 608 charactershardy008, Dec 29, 2013

A- Split from the bottle to a teku and a tulip with a murky, hazy golden appearance. A small pillow of frothy foam builds up upon pouring but falls to all but a tiny ring. A few legs stick but no true lace, looks like a gueuze.
S- Well this is going to be sour... Massive sour lactic and lemony tartness right off the top. Vinous oak barrels although there is no wine here from what I know. Some nice horsey funk as it warms.
T- Sour notes pick up to a vintage Cantillon or Hanssens, acidity just grips the taste buds and the entire mouth making my cheeks sore. Gueuze-like notes of lemons, vinous grapes, oak barrels, apples and even more lactic sourness. Some funk and grassy hay barnyard.
MF- Light bodied and immensely dry. As stated, a battery acid sourness lingers on the palate for many minutes after finishing. Moderate carbonation with a fizzy and somewhat silky texture.
Maybe the closest to a really good Gueuze I can think of coming out of America. I love Supplication and Consecration and this is a refreshing change to straight spontaneous ferment flavors. Sourness dominates but lots of other great flavors beyond that. 1,230 characterscbutova, Nov 25, 2013

A: Pours a hazy golden. Mid-sized and fizzy white head. Head fizzes out pretty quickly. Moderate streaks of lacing. 
S: Heavy on the sour citrus. Lemons mainly I'd say. Maybe some orange peel too. Big and bright and juicy aroma. Very acidic. 
T: Oh yeah, this is a sour one. Extremely sour citrus. Very acidic and biting. About half a step away from biting into a lemon. Very crisp and quite dry, especially in the aftertaste. Long, long lingering sour citrus flavors. Brief hint of oak in the finish before the aftertaste.
M: Crisp and dry medium body. Teeth-chatteringly sour and dry. Fine carbonation.
O: A serious contender for the most sour beer I've ever had. Not far from drinking lemon juice. Honestly, surprisingly pleasant. Not a lot of funk to this one, just straight-up bracing sourness. I expected more funkiness due to the brett and the almost 2-year old bottle. I think the sourness just obliterates anything else. I actually prefer this sort of sour. It's quite tasty and refreshing but drinkability does suffer due to the extreme sourness. Not exactly a sesssionable brew - but that's not the point of course. 1,174 charactersDope, Nov 19, 2013

Appearance is a beautiful golden straw color with a small soapy white head that dissipates to little bodies of bubbles atop the liquid. Effervescent carbonation coming up from the bottom. This seems to look a lighter color than the last batch.
Aroma is heavy grass, lemon, lime, light nectarine, pineapple, and subtle earthy mustiness. Smells grassier and less fruity than the last batch. But beautifully balanced nose.
On the palate, ah yes this Beatification! Once again beautiful balance between sweet, tart, oak, and dry finish. This one has less pucker and is due to its young age. Flavors of lemon peel, Granny Smith apple, green pasture, pineapple, under ripe nectarine, lime pulp, oak, and light Chardonnay. 
Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Light body, spritzy, even pucker through the palate with a slight incline on the finish as the beer drys out.
Overall this is a prime example of the mastery Vinnie possesses. A work of balance, very puckering but not overly so. Less funky than most traditional gueuzes but where it lacks funk it makes up in other nuances that make the beer just as divine if not more unique. Which I believe is the intention. 1,259 charactersMarcWP, Sep 27, 2013

Beer pours hazy straw yellow with a fluffy white head that sticks around for a bit. It's just chillin'. Beat is a pretty inconspicuous beer for being such a beast.
Smells sour. It just kind of made me laugh once I took a whiff. Smells a lot like SitR although there is clearly more lactic in this guy. Lemons and vinegar. Green apple? A little bit. I do get that barrel complexity somewhere in the nose. It doesn't come across as clean oak; instead the barrel has a funky damp wood smell--awesome in sours, shitty in stouts. 
Flavor is very complex, but that complexity is hidden by the sourness. Yeah. Beat is very sour. What surprised me is how good everything else about this beer is. Dat balance. I don't quite understand how the sourest beer I've ever had was so damn drinkable. Flavors of lemon and vinegar. The signature lactic flavor is huge. I can definitely taste dank oak. there is brett contributing to some funkiness. There is also some spiciness. After each sip your mouth responds with some sweetness. There is a lot going on here, but I can't necessarily detect what. Each sip makes you think, "wtf." Beat is a very tasty and enjoyable beer. 
As I mentioned, the balance is top-notch. This is a bit of an anomaly for being so damn sour. Carbonation is medium-high. The whole beer is right where you want it to be. Masterfully crafted stuff.
So yeah... Overall this is pretty phenomenal. One of the few beers that has made my perpetual want list. I might like Consecration a bit more overall, but I would rather be drinking this. It's funny to say, but this is the most entertaining sour I've ever tried. Let's hope I can get more soon. 1,736 characterslunarbrew, Sep 03, 2013

Bottled 01/10/12
6% ABV
Pours a golden yellow color with a thin head that quickly disappears, no lacing on the glass.
Wow, I can tell this is going to be a sour kick to the private parts just based on aroma alone, huge lactic citrus notes with a slight touch of funk to change up the scent.
Taste is as anticipated and even strong, really sets my tongue off with a huge sour bite on the sides, instantly makes my mouth water afterward, a bit too strong though with the sour since it covers up most of the complexity, takes several sips before the mouth can adapt and make out the subtle woody character, carbonation is appropriately high and explosive even though it looks flat in the glass.
Definitely a sipper and not something I could enjoy on a daily basis but a treat nevertheless. 875 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Aug 27, 2013

A) Nice golden hue and the fizzy head quickly dissipates.
S) Mostly a nice tangy lemon.
T) I get lemon, grapes, orange peel which are all nicely tied together by the tartness. What a great taste. Can't get enough!
M) Again the tartness is outstanding, just bordering on being overly so but not crossing the line.

A: Pours a hazy golden color, with active bubbly carbonation. 
S: Tart, citrusy, white wine. Lemon peel with a light earthy funk. 
T: Mouth puckering sour. Sharp acidity, lemon juice, and white grapes. This is incredibly sour, but yet surprisingly drinkable. 
M: Light, dry, tart with subtle but fizzy carbonation. 
O: This might be the sourest beer I've ever had. It's still quite refreshing though. Another lovely sour brew to get me through these ridiculously 90+ temps. 516 charactersbrydeen, Jul 18, 2013
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 5, poured into HF Goblet 7-17-13 at 45-50 degrees. Reviewed over the course of an hour. 
A- Pours a copper orange color with a fluffy white head that appears to be churning from the vigorous carbonation, almost as if it were boiling. Fairly cloudy appearance. The head falls quickly leaving a ring around the edge of the glass, and minimal lacing. 
S- I could smell how sour this thing was as soon as I popped the cork. Upon closer inspection, there are orange, lemon and apricot notes blended in with wet dirt, barnyard. and an amazing smelling yeast character that rounds it all out. It smells incredibly inviting.
T- Very sour right up front, dominated by lemon character. As the lemon fades, layers of funky barnyard, yeasty goodness, and a very enjoyable oak presence take over. The oak dries out the finish and leaves you wanting more of the fruit and funk character from the beginning. 
M- Nice prickly carbonation is right on for style. This beer certainly has a mouth feel of it's own, that being an insane level of mouth puckering, sweat inducing sourness. The oak dries out everything at the end, yet isn't overpowering to the point where you feel like you need a sip of water to get rid of the cottonmouth. It is getting pretty close to that though...
O- Wow- I knew this would be good, but I didn't expect it to be this good. This beer is the definition of a beautifully crafted wile ale. Do whatever you can to get this beer, it is amazing. 1,465 charactersjustforrazors, Jul 18, 2013

A: Pours a nice golden yellow with a very little head.
S: Mostly lemon going on here. Smells great.
T: Lemon taste right up front with a slight vinegar taste. Extremely tart, but not overpowering.
M: Right amount of carbonation and very dry finish.
O: Damn. Why did I trade so many of these away? This beer is extraordinary. It doesn't need any more explanation than that. TRADE FOR IT. 573 charactersRinkor16, Jul 03, 2013

Appearance: Pours a hazy amber and leaves a finger of nice, white head.
Smell: Tart grapes, mild tempting acidity, lemon. Refreshing aroma.
Taste: Very tart lemon, grapes, sour grapefruit, oak, orange. Much different than the mild aroma. Quite sour, but tasty.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium body. Quite sour which makes this not particularly smooth, but is to be expected.
Overall: I was very impressed with this sour. Exceptional smell and really delicious, this is a well-crafted beer. 603 charactersResuin, Jul 01, 2013

3.89/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I've had this before, but this review is for a recent tasting. I drank this alongside a Temptation and Supplication, as well as various ratio'd blends of the three with a pluot muddle to christen my vintage Temptation/Supplication/Beatification/Compunction glass.
Batch 5.
Slightly hazy golden-yellow pour, with a finger or so of white head that retained nicely and streaked the glass with thin lacing. Aroma was pretty intense: lactic, acetic, sour, green apple, citrus. More intense sourness/tartness in the taste...I was told this batch gets "sour in a bad way" with age. I didn't really think it was "in a bad way," but it wasn't exactly smooth. Flavors of green apple, crabapple, lemon, oak, brett, hay, vinegar, white grapes; lactic and tannic notes came out more as it warmed. Medium body, moderate carbonation, heartburn-inducing. Overall good, but probably one of the lower beers on the "-ation" totem poll for me.
Cutting this with Temptation and Supplication really took the edge off. And that's kind of scary. 1,030 charactersRifugium, Jun 15, 2013

A- Pours a clear golden color, topped with a thin white head, nice retention and some spotty lacing.
S- Some fruitiness, mostly lemon and maybe some apple and white grape, huge, huge lactic and acetic tartness, some funkiness and a lot of oak.
T- Massive, massive acidity. Really insanely, over-the-top sourness. This has gotta be one of the sourest beers I've ever had, but its acidity is nicely balanced, so it totally avoids that pure vinegar flavor that a lot of very sour beers fall into. There are also some nice fruity flavors of lemon, white grape and apple, along with some oak and funk.
M- Medium-bodied, nice carbonation, has a very dry, puckering feel.
O- One of my new favorite sours, the tartness dominates everything but is soooo good. Absolutely great beer and amongst the best I've had from Russian River. 934 charactersWillCarrera, Jun 04, 2013

A - Slightly hazy golden yellow with a slight glow to it. Slight carbonation trailing upwards 4
S - Lemon, lactic acid, and white vinegar
T - Lemon and slight vinegar that reminds me of a warhead slightly. Light, slightly bitter lemon zest as well. Rather clean actually as only slight lemon remains in the finish
M - Lots of carbonation and a definite tartness to it that makes you almost pucker your lips. Dry finish 
O - A really tart sour that closely resembles a Belgian gueuze. This one definitely goes to the sour side as it has minimal funk to it 577 charactersjeonseh, Jun 02, 2013

Pours a somewhat dull, golden-yellow blend with a mild chill haze, leaving the beer translucent with very mild clarity. The small, eggshell colored head builds up to almost a half-inch before quickly fizzling away into thin air.
Just from the aroma, I can already tell that this is gonna be one tart and sour MF'er. I bring my nose to the glass and my nostrils are immediately assaulted by an army of acidic and tart aromas; pure lactic acid in a glass. I'm kidding... But, seriously. Green apples, grapes, cherries, tart vinegar, mild oak, and a light but noticeable funk in the background. Probably one of the most sour "smelling" beers I've had the pleasure of sniffing, so I can only imagine how this one is going to taste. It's already got my saliva glands bubbling.
The taste is a brilliant collaboration of everything picked up on the nose, only amplified about a hundred times - extremely fruity and zesty. It's super sour and extremely tart, right from the beginning. Definitely one of the biggest lip-smacking, puckering beers I've had. Juicy, sour apples, lemon juice, white grapes. Huge acidity with heaps of vinous and vinegar flavors. Every single nook and cranny of my mouth is coated with this incredibly sour flavor. It's got me salivating like Pavlov's fucking dog over here. Some light wood and oak comes into the beer near the end and into the aftertaste, along with a light bit of funk, yeast, and musk. Thin-medium bodied with a huge bout of carbonation.
Whew! Now that's a sour beer. Huge sour flavors - so incredibly tart and puckering. Suck a lemon or drink pure lactic acid and you're right on par with Beatification. Nice little addition of funky and Brett notes, too. Thanks again to Tim for breaking this one out, it was incredible.
EDIT: 5/12/2013
Had an earlier batch at Jeff's house (thanks, Jeff!) and this stuff was even better than I remembered. So impossibly sour and so incredibly drinkable. I've never been more sad to see an empty glass. 2,098 characterstectactoe, Mar 03, 2013

This is a sour that is truly sour without any overtones of fruitiness. It finishes leaving you wanting more and more and more. Impossible to drink quickly because after the first sip you know you have come across something special. This is my current favorite beer, if you have a chance to taste any of the Russian River sours try this one first, it will blow your mind. 467 charactersLakemonster, Jan 11, 2013

This poure out as a hazy golden color with a pretty decent white hea on top. The lacing was thin but the retention held up pretty well. The smell is strong as hell, lots of powerful sour notes on top of some subtle vinegar. Very acidic aromas. The taste follows the nose. I nearly had tears in my eyes from how sour this was. The flavors of violent oak aging with Brett and vinegar all come together in this beer. The mouthfeel is light bodied, nicely carbonated and leaves me with a salavating pucker after each sip. Overall this is probably one of the most sour things I've ever had. It's brutal and not something I would ever drink a lot of. Still it fits the style and is sure to please anyone who seeks these type of beers. 787 charactersKnapp85, Jan 10, 2013

Batch 5
Bottled on: 01/10/2012
Thanks to Futura123 for hooking me up with this bottle. 
Appearance: Beatification pours a lightly hazed golden orange and is topped by a good sized white head. The head displays good retention for a sour and leaves a few small patches of lace clinging to the glass as it recedes. 
Smell: The nose is dominated by fruity notes, including: lemon, orange peel, white grapes, tangerine, under ripe stone fruit (apricots) and even a hint of under ripe granadilla, Beatification is not the funkiest beer around, but it is certainly not forgotten. There is a distinct musty character as well as notes of old dusty sacks, old wood, old dry grass, a good dose of oak and a very light earthy note. 
Taste: I have been told that Beatification is one of the more sour beers around, but I am not sure I expected it to be quite this sour - that said, I love sour so this is right up my street! After the big mouth-puckering sourness, flavour notes include: Tart citrus fruits (lemon and a little orange), green apple peel, tart white grapes, a little apricot, cider vinegar, a touch of white wine, oak, musty notes, old wood, some earthiness, a little leather and surprisingly a hint of horse. 
Mouthfeel: In almost all the -ation beers I have had from Russian River, Vinnie has nailed the mouthfeel and this is no exception. Medium bodied (high for the style), with a medium-high level of wonderfully smooth carbonation. 
Overall: Beatification is a fantastic geuze (yes, I consider this a geuze, not an American wild ale) and is one of the few American sours that I think will stand up well to its Belgian counterparts. I would love to see how this one develops over time. 1,776 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 19, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Deep hazy golden like the tipical Cantillon. Minimal head though. Aroma is barnyard, brett and leather but also very fruity (mango, oranges and apricot). Very wild and expressive. Taste is citrusy tart, but not very dry. It reminds me of a lemon pie with candied zests. Lemon is puckering but sweetness lingers in the aftertaste. Slight musty feel. It sure ain't a perfect beer but it taste goddamn good. It feels almost like a pure lambic and is definitly one step ahead from the regular american wild. I slightly prefer Temptation to this one, but it deifnitly hit the spot in its category. 600 charactersLuk13, Dec 08, 2012

A: Pours a pale gold, with a few cms of white head, fizzling quickly to a persistent ring.
S: Sweet and funky stone fruit, lots of toasted oak, orange tangerine, like a delicious sweet and sour candy. Big and enticing aroma.
T: Sweet and sour candy, a moderate mouth-puckering sourness. A little fruit and oak barrel are detectable but the other flavors dominate it.
M: Medium body and medium light carbonation, creamy body.

Appearance. Pours a clear, rich yellow gold with two fingers of bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly.
Smell. Strong woody funk and leather with traces of melons, apples, white wine and a touch of honey. 
Taste. Really sour, tart lemon juice and cider vinegar with some leathery funk and musty, dank old wood. There's even a slight saltiness going on. Very, very nice (despite this description). 
Mouthfeel. Medium+ body with medium+ lively but smooth carbonation.
Overall. An awesome brew. Very sour and really delicious. Enjoying it immensely! 659 charactersRutager, Nov 28, 2012

The beer pours a nice straw yellow colored body with not much head other than a bone white ring. 
The smell and taste have a beautiful elegant sourness that has a really nice roundness to it somehow as well. A mix of lighter fruits like white grape, apricot, pear. Really beautiful taste, almost like a fine chapagne with a big wild yeast note, really nice. 
Effervescent and bubbly feel, very elegant once again. This is so balanced and great.

the smell is funky, with some good barnyard notes, and hints of hay. there is also a lot of sourness that comes through in the smell.
the taste is punch you in the face sour. way more so than i was expecting. you also get a bit of sour apple and cheese hints but the main thing here is super sour.
the mouthfeel is thin dry and fleeting. the mouth waters not only because i want more, but because it is trying to protect my teeth with a bit of saliva to keep them from melting.
overall this is an excellent beer, I love the sour, but wish i could taste past it. i would definitely trade for it again. 704 charactersrowingbrewer, Oct 24, 2012

Score: 98
Batch 5. Bottled on 01/10/12, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed snifter and enjoyed on 010/19/12.
Appearance: Pours a nice mimosa-orange color that is on the opaque side of transparent with a half finger of fizzy white head that settles to a pencil thin ring around the glass that ultimately settles completely. Okay lacing, but not a whole lot of retention. 4/5
Smell: Very tart lemon juice hits upfront. Then there is a nice medley of sweet cole slaw vinegar, white grapes, oranges, granny-smith apples, sour peaches, "lacto-ey yogurt and brett" and a hint of oak. There is a very faint band-aid funkiness, but it's quite subtle. 4.75/5
Taste: Whoa! Tons of pucker-inducing tart lemon juice upfront, with more funkiness on the back half than the nose nose led on -- but it's really well incorporated into a sweet citrusy mix of flavors so it never overwhelms and merely complements the flavors of the beer. Tart white grapes, tangerines and sweet vinegar on the midpalate, with granny-smith apples towards the finish. "Lacto-ey yogurt," lemon and a hint of banana round off the finish and linger well past the swallow. Very gueuze-esque in flavor. Different than, but just as good as, Consecration in my opinion. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation that really accents the zesty tartness of the beer on the center of the tongue. Dry finish, but juicy on the palate. Has a decent amount of pucker. 5/5
Overall: Another outstanding, world class sour from Russian River. This one lives up to its hype, but for its difficulty to acquire, I probably prefer an in-season Consecration.
Recommendation: Seek this one out -- it is truly world class.
Pairings: Monterrey jack cheese wedges and sociables.
Cost: $15 for a 375ml bottle. 1,894 charactersjegross2, Oct 20, 2012

Hazed light orange with a modest white head that falls smartly to a film.
Simply glorious blend of tangy, bright, sherbety and earthy characteristics, manifesting as lemon warheads, oaked white grapes and miscellaneous sour citrus.
Follows the nose, swamping the sense with a rich vein of bright acidity. Brings back childhood memories of Vitamin C tablets, coupled with strong notes of green capsicum. Properly sour.
Medium bodied, with mild but also spritely carbonation leading to a vibrant, puckering, zesty dry finish.
Amazing. "Tangy" has never seemed a more apt adjective. Had high expectations and was not at all disappointed. The sort of beer that renders conventional aroma and flavour nouns largely obsolete as meaningful descriptors of character. 838 charactersspicelab, Oct 15, 2012

4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet. The bottle is dated 011012.
Appearance: Pours a clear light golden/straw color with a thick layer of fluffy white head. The head fades quickly and leaves a small layer and a ring on top of the pour.
Smell: Very light and extremely sour smelling. Definitely getting some funk and some hay/barn type smells. There is just a hint of lemon juice in the sour notes.
Taste: This is an extremely sour beer. The overall flavor is light and crisp. It's full of tart lemon, some white vinegar, and some funk. In the finish I'm getting some slightly herbal flavor that reminds me of aged hops. This one kind of reminds me of a very sour lambic.
Mouthfeel: The body is on the light side of medium with a good amount of fluffy carbonation and a very dry finish.
Overall: This is a really sour, really good beer. It may be slightly one dimensional, but it's really good at what it aims to do. I really enjoyed this and will search out more in the future. 990 charactersoline73, Oct 14, 2012

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Wow, mouth puckering sour this one is.
Pours a hazy golden color with a thin white head, but doesn't last long. Aroma is full of tart citrus like lemon zest and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of green apple and oak. Flavor is so full and complex and overwhelmingly sour, somewhat to it's detriment. I think I enjoy a well blended sour like Temptation to unblended. I enjoy the wild fermentation process to get these amazingly complex beers but the sourness somewhat detracts from what it is your drinking. Flavor is like strong lemon mixed with touches of green apple like the nose suggests but extremely sour, not much funk, it's a nice and fresh sour. Mouthfeel is great, low carbonation probably helps with the high acidity in this beer. Overall great beer for being unblended, glad I got to try it, definitely had to rest the tastebuds after this one. 851 charactersProspero, Sep 21, 2012

200th BA review, I picked a good one
A big thanks goes out to RuckusDu for sending this one over in a trade!
A: Pours a hazy wet straw yellow with a thin film of head that dissipates immediately before I can even identify the color.  Leaves no lacing.  
S: Huge citrus acidity, with lemons and limes, sour apple and tart white grapes. Pear, some belgium yeast banana, the slightest degree of musty funk.  
T: Holy hell is this an explosion of sourness.  Like biting into a whole lemon, then chasing it with a slice of lime.  You can taste the sour on your lips literally before it even hits your tongue.  A bit of peppery spice is there along with a touch of banana ice cream on the finish to balance out the overwhelming sour. This is just a pure puckering sourness, sourer than the most sour Warhead candy I have ever had, and it is sublime.  
M/D:  Aggressive carbonation pairs well with a puckering sour acidity to give this one a wonderful mouthfeel.  Thicker than most in the style.  Quick drying finish that leaves you in all too much of a hurray to take the next sip.  Awesome.  
O: Wow, what can I say?  Looks like pee, smell is good but Ive had better, but then you take the first sip and bam!  Just pure, unadulterated, sour bliss.  My favorite of the RR sours, and the most sour beer I have had to date.  I'd write more but I have to get over to the trade forum to post as ISO: Beat ; FT: first born son. 1,485 characterszac16125, Sep 21, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Brewstein77 for this one. Batch 5, about 9 months in the bottle at time of tasting.
Pours a very nice, brilliant gold with just a touch of orange. Thin wisp of head that quickly dissipates.
Smell is very citrusy. Lots of sour lemons, lactic acidity, limes, oranges. A touch of oak behind that and just a bit of funk behind that. As it warms I get a touch of acetic acid and a little bit of nail polish remover.
The taste is overwhelmingly sour, alcoholic, unsweetened lemonade. Nice bracing acidity, with just enough pucker factor.
The mouthfeel is very nice, very drinkable, but not too thin as some american wilds can be.
Overall, this is a very good beer however I think I enjoy the balance of the other RR sours to this one. I still have one for the cellar so I am hoping that the funk comes up a bit and gives it more balance. 846 charactersquirkzoo, Sep 17, 2012

The aroma on this brew is top notch! Tart lemon flesh blended with green apples and white grapes. A very acidic sourness encapsulates the aroma and has a nice earthy vibe as well.
The taste follows the nose...lemon tartness, green apples and white grapes blended with an acidic sourness. Oaky characteristics shine through on the finish. 
The mouthfeel is amazing. Light to medium in body with the perfect amount of carbonation with a clean, crisp, dry and sour finish. The sour finish lingers for days and days! So good!
Overall, this beer was worth the hype. Big thanks to my buddy Josh for getting this for me as a wedding gift. Major beer karma comin your way! This beer did it all without trying to do too much. Just amazing 835 charactersdcloeren, Sep 15, 2012
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml poured into Bruery tulip. Batch 5 bottled 1/10/12. Sent to me from an awesome BA, and good guy RC0032.
A - Golden, clear, very little or no head
S - Lemon, funk, hay. Notes of soured pear, must, and a light sweetness at the end
T - Immediately bombards the tongue with a blast of lactic sourness. Very tart, mouth puckering. Lemon and sour pear dominate, funk creeps in everywhere. Enough acetic acid to add some depth, but not a huge vinegar presence here. Slight hints of oak on the finish.
M - A little heavier than other Russian River brews, but still medium bodied overall. Enough small bubbles to make it crisp and refreshing from pour to finish. Mouthfeel and carbonation accent the intense tart/sourness flavors. 
O - Having had all the other RR offerings, I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. I got a beer that had enough complexity to keep a smile on my face, and enough lactic sourness to burn a hole through ones stomach. Not particularly balanced, but intense and a fantastic example of what American wilds can be! Would love to try this with a bit more age on it. 1,095 charactersactone2001, Sep 15, 2012

3.0 A: Very faintly hazed concentrated urine color. Two and a half fingers of frothy white head. Retention is average at best and no lacing is left.
4.0 S: Pears, pears, and more pears. This is the peariest beer I've ever smelled. Hay is the next most aggressive note. Moderately tart with more of the wild qualities being of the funk variety. Musty basement, dry-rotten sweatsocks, rotting wood, and dusty old barn. Lemon, vanilla, and oak to round this off. It's complex, but the aromas don't run very deep, if that makes any sense. 
4.5 T: Pears dominate the taste as well and it tastes great. Much more tart and acetic than the nose. Plenty of lemon and tart white grape with some lime underneath. The funk mentioned in the nose follows. The taste is both complex and deep. It's potent, yet quite refined. After having a bunch of Bruery sours lately, the quality of this one is that much more apparent. Although this is good and tart, it's still nicely balanced.
4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Higher, but normal range, carbonation with a dry champagne-like spritziness as opposed to a sweet creaminess. Good here.
5.0 D: A couple categories were borderline with a higher score, so hence a 5.0 here. This is the first RR sour that has truly impressed me since I first had Tempation. Solid all around. 1,358 charactersDavoleBomb, Sep 08, 2012

This beer froze in the mail, nearly exploded and now trying it, somehow it hasn’t lost one bit of its spectacularity. The cork pops with good pressure, pours with good, spritzy carbonation leaving a small, white head that dissipates quickly. Looks cloudy, beautiful grapefruit juice in color like a top notch geuze. Aroma is similar to the best geuzes I’ve tried: lemon sorbet, fresh grapefruit juice, grapefruit rind, white pepper. Taste is bright, fresh grapefruit and lemon with quenching tartness. Not very funky or horsey- more fresh citrus. Some oak, sour peaches, and Granny Smith apples shine through. The definite hit of our tasting. Thanks Joe!
375mL b2 courtesy of MrChopin. I’ve been debating about upping the score from 4.3 to 4.4 seeing that I dream of this beer on an almost constant basis. This, my third time trying the beer, has confirmed that it is time. Beatification b2 is so drying and so wildy complex with spicy cedar, drying oak, lemon/lime/orange, leather, peaches, apricots...it is an all encompassing sour experience that is never acedic, never citric. Just spot on perfection. My notes for this say, "It’s like the world ended and I was resurrected in paradise."

A-	Pours a cloudy, semi-radioactive orange-yellow. Active carbonation constantly climbs up the sides of my tulip. Eggshell white head fizzles away quickly leaving a thin ring/wispy cap. 4
S-	Bracing acidity, lemon/zest, tart green apple, and earthy/dirt funk. Very geuze-like, but muchhhh more sour. 4.5
T- 	Not as scathingly sour as the nose suggested, but just about there. Puckering acidic sourness on par with straight lemon-juice. Once that fades away notes of mild/earthy funk creep in. Finishes with some juicy/fruit notes in there as well. Simple, but damn tasty. 4.
M- Carbonation is very fine/high. Very light and refreshing body. I’d love to open another one by the pool. 4.5
O- I can see why people rave about this beer, but for the effort involved I’d rather just drink Boon Mariage Parfait. Although Beat is a better brew, it’s just barely so. 4 893 charactersstxSS07, Sep 04, 2012

S- slight aroma of lemons, with a nice bit of funk in there too. Good, but not overly fragrant
T- intensely sour. As in, I take a sip and I can feel it in my ears. Tons of citrus...grapefruit, lemon, and all-out funk.
M- the body on this sour is actually thicker than I have ever seen in a wild/lambic style. Carbonation level is good
O- this is one of the absolute best beers I've ever had, and completely worth the price tag and cost from shipping from Cali. If you're a fan of sours and you've never had this...well, what the hell are you waiting for?! 820 charactersbigfnjoe, Sep 01, 2012

A: Hazy yellow pour with a number of bubbles racing to the top of the beer. About a finger or two of white head sticks around for a good amount of time, and laces nicely.
S: It smells like sour tartness and not much else. Slight oaky and yeasty underneath.
T: Like the smell, I'm having difficulty describing the taste. It's basically just tart and sour with not much complexity. That's not to say I don't like it, I think it tastes very good, it just isn't much different than any American Wild Ale you could pick up off the shelf. The balance between tart and sweet is quite nice.
MF: Light and bubbly, the cork almost popped out of the bottle without any pulling. Very drinkable I would say. 
O: For what this took to get I'm a bit disappointed. It just tasted a bit average for me. The aggressive sour is impressive, but the rest of the beer doesn't entirely back it up. 887 charactersrusswbeck, Aug 12, 2012

The taste is full of lemon sourness in the front and the finish. I get a little more sweetness from the beer after several sips. Any oak or barrel notes are subtly placed in the finish. This is a very strong taste, suitable for slow sipping.

A - Pours hazy golden yellow with a small half finger tall white head leaving very small streaks of lace down a small portion of the glass.
S - Smells of lots of acidic sourness, white grape, lemons, green apples, oak and some barnyard funk. Batch #2 is mostly sourness at this point, Batch #3 has all the flavors in near perfect balance and Batch #5 is probably the "fruitiest" of the three.
T - Starts off with an intense sourness that never really goes away. The fruit - the lemons, grapes and apples from the nose - combine with some musty barnyard funk and dry oak to offer some contrast to the sourness but they can only do so much. Finish is quite dry, lingering on the palate long after consumption.
M - All three batches possess a light body with intense flavors and moderate to moderately low carbonation. Very sour, dry finish on all three batches.
O - All three of these were really good. My Batch #2 was definitely the most sour, Batch #3 was probably my favorite since it was the most balanced and Batch #5 just tasted a little raw compared to the other two. This was a seriously delicious test. 1,313 charactersorangesol, Jul 31, 2012

Batch 5; bottled on 01/10/2012.
A nice loud pop heard when the cork came out of the bottle. 375ml C&C bottle poured into duvel tulip.
Appearance: Glowing brilliant yellow bodied beer with one finger of white head that drops to a thin cap that stays around for the entire beer.
Smell: Vinegary; tart lemons jump out at your right away. The oak barrel is really noticable too. Earthy, wheat, hay / straw notes and some citrus is in there too.
Taste: This beer is sour! Gotta say its on the high end of sour or it might even break into the low end of high tart sourness. Sour lemons with a touch of vinegar and a touch of funk. Big oak barrel notes as well. Grapefruit and orange rinds citrusy sourness. Lite earthiness, citrus, and moderate sour finish to the beer. 
Mouthfeel: Low end of a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation levels. The mouthfeel on this sour is phenominal. Super dry finish. Very lively carbonation. Huge sour with a perfect mouthfeel. 
Overall: My favorite Russian River sour. Its just a seriously delicious sour beer that packs a hardcore sour punch. Its also one of the top American Wild Ales that I have been privilaged to try. 1,239 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 29, 2012

Appearance: Pours a light honey gold with a 1-2 finger sudsy snow white head. There is a fair amount of sludgy buildup inside the bottle where the cork came out, but it doesn't seem to pour into the beer. The head dissipates quickly leaving a small ring around the edges before finally disappearing altogether. Little to no lacing once the head dissipates.
Smell: Tart, but not overpoweringly. There is a hint of barnyard funk to go along with apple cider, sweet white wine, lemon, vinegar and a touch of oak. Extremely complex aroma which balances sweetness with tartness.
Taste: Wow, that's one intensely tart array of flavors! Vinegar and wine grape hulls up front followed by sweet cider and touch of funk in the middle before ending with lemon zest and just a faint hint of oak. Aftertaste is bitter, tart and very dry with notes of earthiness, oak tannins and a little funk.
Mouthfeel: Light-to-medium-bodied with an very high amount of prickly carbonation. The mouth is coated by the puckering sourness.
Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. I could drink a lot of this beer if only I were lucky enough to have multiple bottles.
Overall: Excellent beer overall. Russian River really knocked it out of the park with this one. I can't imagine a sour beer getting much better than this. I can't recommend it enough. 1,430 charactersadam42381, Jul 25, 2012
4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375 mL bottle from batch 5, opened for review #550. Thanks to afrokaze for the hookup, and this was poured into my Duvel tulip.
Beatification pours a crystal clear golden yellow. There's maybe a finger's worth of white foam crowning the beer, and it disappears quickly and quietly. The nose has a good bit of acidity to it. It's very citric, with some bright lemon poking through. There's also a good bit of funk, some earthiness and also pineapple/tropical fruits. The flavor follows suit, displaying the full potential of wild yeast/bacteria. The tartness is perfect, bold and attention grabbing without turning the beer into vinegar. A brief flash of lemon opens the beer nicely, before a tiny bit of oak and some earthy and fruity funk come in and fill the mid palate. The acidity comes back in for a lingering finish. The body is just a little bit full, and the carbonation a little bit lifeless, and combined they're enough to make mouthfeel just feel... off. Despite one or two minor quibbles, Beatification is a fantastic sour beer. It's managed to not only live up to all the community generated hype, but all the anticipation I had for it personally after getting to try only an ounce or two at a tasting a few years ago. I'm glad I have a couple more bottles tucked away in the cellar. 1,297 charactersaxeman9182, Jul 24, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Adam for busting this great brew out at an impromptu tasting!
Appearance: Pours a perfectly clear golden color with 1/4" of white head. Carbonation is there, but fairly minimal for the style. Head retention is nice, as a nice layer remains throughout the duration of the beer. The clarity and clear, warm color make the appearance of this beer very nice. 
Smell: Smells of lemons, tartness, some pale fruitiness (maybe some mango and peach), slight funk and light mustiness. Pretty nicely balanced between the tartness, funk and fruit character.
Taste: Some initial sweetness that is slightly peachy with some mango, followed by lemony tartness, slight funk, and a very sour finish. This beer definitely has more lacto sourness than brett funk, as the taste lacks funk and mustiness for the most part. A very good taste, but wish it had that extra gear. Still, good.
Overall/Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is perfect. Light bodied with ample carbonation. Overall, a damn nice wild that I was excited to try, and would definitely have again. 1,044 characterszhanson88, Jul 11, 2012

A- Pours a bright gold with a thin white head that leaves minimal lacing.
S- Plenty of lemon juice and peel as well as peach upfront, followed by lacto, horse blanket and vinegar.
T- Damn this is sour, just tons of lemon juice, lemon peel, lacto, horse blanket, vinegar and a hint of peach.
M- Fairly high carbonation and a light body with a long dry finish with the sourness lingering on.
O- This is quite sour, but that's pretty much it. Nothing too complex and am confused why this is considered a top wild from RR. Have had a few others from them and this just seems to lack any depth their other offerings had. Glad I got to finally try it, but wouldn't really seek it out. 773 charactersiadler, Jul 08, 2012

T. Closely follows the nose starting with lemon and bready sweetness but accompanied with very funky earth and a quite dry and sour finish. 
M. Full body moderate to high carbonation. Crisp

4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Yellow and orange appearance, looks darker than pte, almost appearance wise is more akin to a typical dipa moreso than a wild ale. Real good looking head, this is the best looking wild ale I may have ever seen, just pristine.
Really massive sour notes, dry, earthy and extremely citrusy (and not just lemon). 
Taste, wow, immediately reminds me why this is my favorite of the Russian -tion beers. And then it makes me pontificate whether I like this more than framboise for a cure or pty. Yup, that good. Body is light, taste, sour power is heavy. Keeps the brett aspect down, lets the other germs dominate. Never approaches anything that could be considered vinegar-esque. Oak notes are mild. Its all about orange type citrus notes, dry and earthy hyper drive sour. 768 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jul 05, 2012

A: Deep yellow, excellent clarity with beautiful pinpoint carbonation. As appetizing as a beer can look!
S: Damp cotton, lemon candies, wet leaves, lactic twang. Smells very familiar as a Gueuze, but there's something unique about the profile. Perfect.
T: Lemons at first, then a big wave of smooth earthy brett character. Wool. An extremely dry and sour finish even by Lambic standards. Has a slight 'coarseness' in the aftertaste, but flawless aside from that.
M: Torrential carbonation and VERY dry. High drinkability, highly refreshing, I love this beer.
So glad I finally got a chance to try Beatification. This beer blew me away as much as any Cantillon I've ever had. 692 charactersmattsander, Jul 03, 2012

Look: Pours a translucent yellow orangish color with a 1/4 inch white head and ok retention with some carbonation bubbles 
Smell: The nose has quite a bit of funk going on with some crisp citrus notes finishes with a touch of oak
Taste: This one starts out sour with quite a bit of lactic acid and it can become a distraction. Behind the sourness is the some barnyard funk lemon zest and vinegar
Mouthfeel: Light body lots of carbonation very sour and dry and makes you pucker
Overall: For the style this is a good beer but for me I find it hard to drink and could not see myself finishing a whole bottle. Not a fan of the style in general 711 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jul 03, 2012

A - Pours a clear yellowish orange, with a small head that quickly dissipates. Minimal lacing, but some visible carbonation in the glass.
S - Crisp and slightly tart with a funk. Hint of lemon zest and a sliced green apple.
T - This beer packs a very intense sour bite! There's a nice fruitiness (green apple in particular) too and a perceived sweetness though it's actually pretty dry.
M - the brew was medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, slight fruity, acidic, sour, and dry finish.
O - Another great sour from Russian River. I prefer Supplication and Consecration over this one. 627 charactersSkiBum22, Jul 03, 2012

A- Pours a slightly hazy translucent yellowish golden, above average carbonation- a lot of fast rising carbonation bubbles of all diffferent sizes, thin layer of white head (about a half finger) that recedes to leave almost no head.
S- Lots of sour funk. Sour cherries, sour lemons, vinegar, a little bit of hay, barnyard funk, sweaty gym clothes, etc. Very aromatic, could smell when the cork popped and while it is sitting next to me.
T- Sour cherries, sour green apples, a little bit of hay, finishes with a nice sour, tart green apple taste. Leaves a very nice sour green apple aftertaste that lingers for awhile inside the mouth and the lips. A little bit more vinegar/acidic tasting towards bottom of glass. So much flavor packed into this beer that even the last drop cloying to the bottom of the glass + bottle is exploding with a multitude of flavors. Never had a beer that played with the taste buds so much. Only complaint is that at times it was almost too vinegary/acidic and could have been balanced a tiny bit better. Overall though one of the best tasting beers I've had.
M- Light, crisp, refreshing, perfect carbonation to complement the sourness, very easy to drink.
O- This was an awesome beer, probably one of the best I've had. The taste and aroma are right up there with some of the best sours including the Cantillons. I definitely enjoyed this a lot more then the Supplication I had earlier, a lot more funk, more citrusy, and more overall flavor etc.. Definitely a must try if you are into sours. Wish the brewery was on the East Coast. 1,786 charactersjaasen64, Jun 30, 2012

375ml cork and caged bottle, fridge temp, batch 5, bottled on 01 10 12, poured into a snifter.
pours a very nice clear golden color, fairly retentive skim white head, no real lace to speak of.
lots of tart funky brett. tart cherries, sour lemon, a bit floral and lots of nice footy funk.
oh my sour! big tart lemon citrus, sour pie cherry, footy, bretty funk, a bit of green sour apple, and a hint floral. sweet tart like. very sour finish that lingers and definatly makes you pucker. 
i love the sourness in this beer, its pretty intense. very tart with a very dry finish. fairly light in body.
this beer (as well as any other RR beer ive had) definatly lives up to all the hype. some very nice funk and intense sour citrus makes this a winner, right up there with cantillion IMO. 825 charactersdogfishandi, Jun 30, 2012

Batch 005, split with dogfishandi...
A: Pours a cloudy golden straw with a half finger of pure white head that fades pretty quickly. There is no lacing on my glass as it drinks.
S: The nose is sour grapes, sour cherries, rose hips, brett, green apple, and vinegar. Sour is an understatement for this beer. It's glorious, but it's not for the faint of heart.
T: Damn. It's sweet and tart right up front. From that point on, it's just massive sour. Puckering vinegar, green apple, and artificial sours hit you big time. It's like sipping on a liquefied sour patch kid. It's super drying in the finish, and almost hurts the taste-buds.
M: Medium bodied beer. It's massively sour, super funky, and lingers forever. It almost hurts your mouth, but I'm loving it.
O: Fantastic beer. It's mega sour and super delicious. This is a true standout for wild ale fans. It deserves every bit of praise that it gets. Fantastic. 961 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jun 29, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to bugdoc for this one. '12 vintage poured from bottle to over-sized Mikkeller wine glass:
Pours a beautiful orange/honey gold with carbonation clinging to every corner of the glass. A lively two fingers of starch white head doesn't last as long as I'd expect. Could be the glass though. Still perfect lacing though.
The nose is intense, complex. Obvious funky honey and lemongrass. A deeper kind of sour, not as bright as its brothers and sisters. A great smelling beer.
Wow. Massive on the tongue. Pushing a Warhead level of sour punch. The sour intensity mellows considerably as the beer warms. Grapefruit, rich esters, orange peel/orange juice, syrupy lemonade, truly a gigantic beer. I'm blown away by how much flavor is crammed in here.
The sour side of the beer keeps drinkability rather low but its silky smooth mouthfeel is redeeming. 
Overall, very glad to have had the opportunity to try this one. Sour beers are quite foreign to me and gems like these make me excited to try more. 1,004 charactersyamar68, Jun 29, 2012

A: Slight pop when the cork came off. Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice white, fizzy head on top. Pretty good retention with sporadic lacing that doesn't last too long. 
S: Fantastic tartness. Some peach, lemon, apricot, and white grapes. Nice citrus fruits and some nice barnyard funk that blends nicely with the fruit/tartness. 
T: Has a very gueuze like flavor, lots of tart lemon and some apricot. Underneath there is some tart green apple and more white grapes. Very mouth puckering and it is amazing. 
M: Medium bodied, great level of carbonation. Very tart/acidic, but I am really liking it. 
O: Simply put, amazing. One of the best beers I have ever had hands down. Great flavor and extremely tart. 766 charactersmdaschaf, Jun 25, 2012

Note: Batch 5
Consumed 6/24/12
Appearance: Pours hazy, bright gold - big, white head to start - retains a little cap, leaves a few spots of lacing
Smell: Sour, so much sour - truly a bouquet of bacteria - sharp acidity, tart, with some serious wood - funky, but mostly sour, so sour - some pale malts underneath
Taste: Sour - so, so sour - unbelievably sour - a sharp, glorious sour that coats the mouth and sticks around - some lemon - very tart - some wood in the background, with a base of pale malts - acidic with some citrus
Mouthfeel: Light to medium, nicely carbonated, puckering to the extreme
Overall: Glorious
This is like sour concentrate. It's like alchemy, but with sour flavor. In a word, this is masterful. One of the best beers I've had from Russian River, and that is really saying something. 858 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 24, 2012
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Thebroth for hooking me up with a bottle.
Appearance: Slightly hazed bright gold. Head is bright white and drops to a tiny, bubbly collar with a wispy cap. Carbonation is lively but not aggressive. 
Smell: Mild powdery funk. Oak barrels add a nice woody earthiness. Some lactic tartness as well. Lemon zest with a mild floral undertone. Some old cheese. Touch of Brett breadiness. All kinds of funk with a budding sour edge. Layers of wild. Touch of yeast.
Taste: Lactic acid snap right up front. Sharp and bright. Touches of Brett funk add some hay and grass. Powdery yeast. Lemon zest with some fresh squeezed lemon juice. Some backing sweetness. Wood helps mellow some of the more aggressive tart flavors. Almost citric level of tartness. The barrel Influence helps pull everything together. Mild floral elements. Musty with some hints of ripe cheese. Sharp. 
Mouthfeel: Bright. Light body pushes toward medium. Carbonation is moderate, but effervescent. Flavor spreads and dries on each sip. Lingering powdery tartness. 
Overall: Top notch stuff. Incredibly complex blend with nice levels of funk and sour.
I'm glad I got to try this. It's worth all the hype and it would likely age incredibly well. Definitely a top showing from an already top level brewery. Incredible stuff to be had. Too bad I don't have more. 1,334 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jun 24, 2012

N: Soured oak staves. Some acetone and barnyard funk. Lemon/sour citrus. There is an unpleasant scent wavering through this which knocks off some points. 
T: Probably a 9/10 on the sour scale. Plenty of lemon citrus, and plenty of lactic acid. Great wood base to round things out. SOme pine/earthiness, but not in the way you'd get from hops.

A - Looks like a hazier Fou Foune. Good edge-clinging white, soapy head, great lacing.
S - I've never come across a brett aroma that I found particularly "refreshing", but this somehow is. Fresh cut haystacks, earthy, a bit herbaceous, touch of horse blanket, lemon vinegar. Great balance across the full spectrum of aromas here.
T - Sour. Bomb. This goes beyond Cantillon Classic Geuze. The level of biting tartness here is a bit stunning. Sharp citrus at mid-palate. Back end is cleaner grass and herbal.
M - The definition of finishing dry. Combined with the intense mouth watering, this is quite a tease to quench. Great carbonation, light body. Right on.
D - Hits the nail on the head while staying refined. Love it. 845 charactersAuracom, Jun 18, 2012

Pours a hazy golden straw yellow color with a bubbly white head. Retains for just a moment before dissolving into some cloudy film with a bit of lacing on the glass. 
Punchy, intense tartness in the nose driven by an powerful lemony scent. Hints of citrus peel with funky wetness and hay. Light touch of oak with acid. 
Zesty lemon and powerful sourness right off the bat. Citrus peel with funky tones and decent acidity. Puckering sourness continues throughout the profile, drying up on the tongue with some yeasty hints. Finishes with lemon and tartness. 
Lighter medium body, slightly higher carbonation, dry, bubbly and extremely lingering on the tongue. If you're looking for an intensely sour beer that packs a punch you won't soon forget, this is the one. I've been waiting to try this for a couple years and it's lived up to the expectations. 909 charactersxnicknj, Jun 12, 2012

RR corked and caged bottle, popped bottle, and poured slowly into my JK Farmhouse glass. Pours a really cloudy golden color, some white, tight bubbles in the head. It looks like a sour! It actually resembles a Gueuze in a lot of ways. Smell- sour green apples, citrus, earthy funk! I get some eastern asia tropical fruits (like a star fruit)- very tart aroma. Also, some vinegar aroma. So many things in common with a good gueuze. Taste- oh my god, puckering sour. Its the sour you get from biting right into a green apple (unripened) and gnawing on the skin. There is a sugary tartness on my teeth. Also, I get some sour patch kids sourness too. Definite vinegar present on the end, it works well with the sourness, not a detractor at all. This is an A+ sour. One of the best I've ever had for sure. 913 characterslnashsig, Jun 11, 2012

A: Light, frothy white head fades quickly. Super-clear and quite pale. Almost like white wine.
S: Excellent yeast -- sharp, funky, sweet, and sour. Full of fruit and tartness and all the excellent aspects I've come to associate with wild yeast, and none of the lesser aspects.
T: Interesting! Fiercely puckery...almost too much so to drink. Like Warheads as a child, this beer makes my jaw socket ache. Still, it's perversely delicious. A touch of vinegariness that I don't particularly enjoy, almost like olive brine, but otherwise quite nice...bright fruit, very wine-like, very dry, and rather acidic. Some lemons. Overall, enjoyable.
M: Your mouth will want to collapse in on itself. Your tongue will tingle. And you will like it. What a beer!

T - Starts off with lots of sourness and funk with some pear and other tart light fruits and lots of farmhouse flavors. Through the middle, some more funky flavors comes through with some Brett and other wild yeast flavors and some oak. The finish is a mix of funky wild yeast flavors with lots of farmhouse flavors, strong sourness, oak, and some lemon peel.

Bottled on 1/10/12.
Pours a slightly murky yellow with a beige head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, funky, earthy, and woody. Taste is the same with an awesome mouth puckering sourness. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an amazing beer with fantastic aromas and flavors. 479 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jun 03, 2012

Big sour nose. A touch of sour apple. Funky. 
Very sour flavor. Lemon juice and rind. That's pretty much it. 
Mouth is light and crisp. High carb. 
Overall not a Lot of complexity IMO. Very one note sour. Sour lemony citrus.  302 charactersMrVonzipper, Jun 03, 2012

Finally get to partake of the Beat. Pours a crystal clear pale yellow ale with a awesome frothy head that dissapates to a thing layer.
The aroma is killer. Light vinegar, lemon peel, lemon zest, grassy and earthy. Getting a lot of floral as well. 
Definitely let this bad boy warm a tad to get the funk...er..party started. Sour lemons, barnyard funk, white grapefruit peel. This definitely not as sour as I was expecting. While it's tart, it is much too drinkable.
Light carbonation in the glass but an explosion in the mouth.
Overall this is definitely worth the hype. This is a fantastic beer that blends the sourness with a touch nostril-pleasing floral goodness....and keeps it very drinkable.
Great job Vin. Hell, I even drank the sediment. 760 characterskaseydad, Jun 03, 2012

Pours a clear yellowish orange, with a small head that quickly dissipates. Minimal lacing, but some visible carbonation in the glass.
Oh man that's a strong smell. Comes to me easily as I pour the glass. Smells strongly of citrus. Lemon, orange, some peach, a little bit of a hay-like smell. Slightly musty. It smells like it's going to be pretty sour, I can get a bit of that mouth-puckering feeling just from a sniff. Pretty funky.
Yeah, that's pretty sour, but not at all unpleasant. Lots of citrus, some green apple, little bit of funk. Little bit of peppery spice at the finish.
Mouthfeel is just great. I don't know what else to say. I have absolutely no complaints.
The drinkability on this is nuts. I could down these all the time. Perfect summer beer: complex, light, and refreshing. Each sip finishes with this pleasant tartness that just makes me want to keep drinking. More, please! 927 charactersrodkin, Jun 03, 2012

A: Hazy yellow to golden in color, light white head dissipating pretty quick. Ok lacing.
S: WOW, the smell along on the beer blows me away, SO MUCH FUNK. Very complex, goes from smelling really good first sniff to smelling like something rotten next sniff back to really good next sniff. So weird, so good!
T: Almost no funk at all in the flavor, has a very clean crisp sour flavor. Fruity, spicy and complex. Flavor is very light but also rich at the same time. amazing!
M: Light, smooth, good carbonation
O: This beer is like nothing else, the difference between the smell and the taste is something else. Would be interesting to drink a sanctification right next to it. Awesome beer but for $15 bucks a pop I'll be trading it more than drinking it. 764 charactersanimortician, May 24, 2012

Upon popping the cork and sticking my nose at the bottle neck, my initial response was to say aloud, while alone, "Why the shit is this not a regular?! Get your shit together Vinnie."
This is a crispy golden beer with a solid, fluffy, white cap and a resilient central emission of carb rises from the bottom. Lemon zest, manure, hay, arugula, horse hair, soil, yogurt and hell yeah emit from the aqueous solution. One of the most tart beers I've tasted, lemon juice, hints of bitterness, mud, weed roots, dandelion - this beer is insane. Medium bodied with higher carb than I'd prefer (easily remedied with the amount of shaking and whiffing I'm doing) and a semi dry, yet mouth watering finish. 
This is the best American Wild Ale I've had (sans fruit). Just. Fucking. Outstanding. 810 charactersharrymel, May 22, 2012

Very light yellow body. Large fine white head. Bit of lace.
Smells almost like farts. This is some serious funk.
Incredibly sour. One of the sourest beers I've ever had. Like, Rodenbach levels of sour. Kinda sticks with you like Warheads.
Pretty fine feel, but it's a bit sticky.
Really sour and good, maybe worth the effort to get it though. 362 characterszaphodchak, May 19, 2012

A - Pours a yellow with a hint of orange, which can be seen right through. A thick head at first, a goes down a little. Looks really fantastic.
S - Crisp and slightly tart with a funk. Hint of lemon zest and a sliced green apple. 
T - Tartness upfront lays way to more tartness. Much like the aroma, actually, with more of the sour coming through in the flavor. There is lemon zest, some other light notes of very light fruits (apples, peach), some funkiness evident in well-blended gueuzes. The oak can be noticed behind the sourness after a few sips.
M - Lighter and crisp, which is perfect for the style.
O - This is a remarkably good AWA. It makes me think of a young gueuze blend more than any non-fruited AWA I've had. For a style that strives to be as good as something out of Belgium, RR has done it here. I find it to be slightly less layered and complex than the best gueuze I've had, but not by much. 1,024 charactersclaaark13, May 18, 2012

A: Golden apricot color, fairly clear. No head to speak of, instead only a ring of bubbles. There is some visible carbonation.
S: Sour, vinegar, fruity (peach/apricot/lemon) with just a bit of barnyard. Really nice aroma here.
T: Fruity again (peach, apricot, lemon, pineapple, strawberry?). There isn't much wood character but it is there in the background. Sour but not overwhelmingly so.
M: Pleasantly light mouthfeel with dry finish and moderate carbonation.
O: Awesome. Given the PITA that this ended up being for me to acquire, my hopes had really been built up. But unlike so many previous experiences with a similar backstory, it lived up to my expectations easily. Bottles of Beat would absolutely be a permanent fixture in my fridge if that was possible! 862 charactersmacrosmatic, May 09, 2012

Bottle to 5oz taster
Not sure batch
@Beachwood's BBQ Long Beach- Ode to Lambic
App- A very cloudy light to medium yellow with a good density and particle behind it. Zero head on it. Flat pineapple juice that really looks like Campbells soup to me.
Smell- A fresh field of hay in a glass. A lot of backing lemon and a bit of wheat. Not overly sour smell, more tart.
Taste- A small sour note to say the least and at 5.5%, dangerously drinkable. A good balance is struck between the lemon, wheat, tart, funk wheel of flavors. 
Mouth- Punchy lemon flavors abound in this one with a light to medium body and a fairly light crisp carbonation level. A bit damp on the finish.
Drink- It's good, but didnt blow me away. I can see what the fuss was about though and very glad I have another bottle at home. 822 charactersFosterJM, May 07, 2012

High-ish carbonation and a light mouthfeel. Dry up front with lemon, lime, hints of wheat and pepper, and a puckering sweet tart finish.
Really good -- reminded me a bit of Temptation but much more sour and intense. Had a hard time picking up on any barrel characteristics. 400 charactersgrittybrews, May 07, 2012

A: Golden Yellow, half finger head, lots of bubbles. Looks delicious!
S: Very similar to Temptation, imo, but stronger funk and fruit notes. 
T: Holy hell! Mouth puckering sourness, sour apple, lemon, funk, I don't get much oak, but damn, this is one of most sour and puckering thing I drank. 
M: Sharp carbonation, light body, awesome. Dry finish, as expected.

A - Gold with a slight haze. A small head of large bubbles that dissipates quickly. But a slow steady stream of rising bubbles remains for some time after.
S - A nice mix of funk and sour fruit. Just enough to hint at what's to come.
T - This beer packs a very intense sour bite! There's a nice fruitiness (green apple in particular) too and a perceived sweetness though it's actually pretty dry.
M - Moderate consistency with a low to moderate carbonation.
O - A fantastic sour! But then again, I wouldn't expect anything else from Russian River. 613 charactersGJ40, May 05, 2012

4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5375 mL bottle poured into an RR -tion glass. Batch 5, bottled 1/10/2012. A celebration beer. Robotics National (International?) Champs.
Appearance - Pours a hazy golden-orange body. No much of a head. Small bit of white foam that settles to a ring of bubbles. Not really lively looking.
Smell - Nice tart fruit aromas. Citrus orange and lemon. Good dose of white peppery funk, but it's not anywhere near as strong as the best Belgian lambics.
Taste - First sip is tart, quite tart. Loads of lemon tang to it. Fades quickly, though. Wheat and hay permeate the flavor as it fades to a peppery funk in the end. Again, it's not moldy cheese funky or nasty sweaty feet sock funky, but it's a touch funky.
Mouthfeel - Finishes crisply and without a puckering sour flavor. It actually retains a bit of a sweetness. Just a hint. Lingering flavors are excellent. This is a well crafted beer. Finishes with just a touch of bitterness.
Overall - Really pleasant sour. Easily the best from RR and definitely one of the best American Wilds out there. Compared to a true Belgian lambic, though, it's not up with the best. Lacks a bit of complexity and definitely missing the funk that I crave. I'm being picky, though. This is delicious and a worthy celebration beer. 1,258 charactersAlieniloquium, May 03, 2012

A: Pours with a light golden haze and frothy, airy white head. It recedes to a similar ring that leaves some splotches here and there.
S: Tartness and mild sourness. A mix of fresh tart fruit, mainly green apple and lemon grass with restrained funk.
T: Gueuze-ish with a slight restrained funk. Tart green apples, lemon grass, mild funk and some oak with a finish of vanilla sweetness that mixes with a little white grape sournes.
M: Zesty and spritzy. The body is light with a refreshing clean finish.
O: Delicious beer that borders on a gueuze IMO. If the funk wasn't so restrained in the backbround I'd say this wasn't a wild ale, but very good none the less. 755 charactersTreebs, May 02, 2012

S- Funky, fruity, oak, wine. 
T- This one is REALLY sour. Does have a lot of other flavors going on, as well, but this very well could be the most sour beer they make. The oak is definitely present, along with some fruit (cherries, pineapple, I think) and some funk. Again, VERY sour.
M- Maybe my favorite aspect of this beer. Unbelievably smooth despite the extreme flavors. Carbonation is medium low which works perfectly and give it a creamy mouthfeel.

A: Semi-hazy golden orange colored body with a modest finger worth of white head. Not much lacing and only a minor ring of bubbles lined the edges of the glass. For the style, this isn't unexpected at all.
S: Lemon, acidic funk, tart citrus notes, orange, white grapes. The barrel character surprisingly comes through towards the end with plenty of soft oak and sweet vanilla. An absolutely delightful smelling beer.
T: More acidic lemon, orange and peach up front which transitions into a quick oak character. The tartness washes quickly through the palate bringing in some dry white grape flavors and ending with touches of floral spice.
M: Highly carbonated, prickly and spritzy on the palate though never feeling thin at all. Really what you'd want from a Wild Ale. No dryness or linger of anything off-putting. Just really well done in this aspect.
Easily my favorite of all the Russian River sours I've sampled to date. This one has a very bright citrusy profile I love. Hands down one sour I'd drink on a regular basis if I could. 1,171 charactersShanePB, May 01, 2012

Pours a clear gold, a little light. Not much head left after what looked like a typical amount of head from a Belgian yeast. Lots of citrus, peach, super sour. Hard to pick out the aromas in this one. Overall, flowery sweet with a heaping dose of tart. Speaking of which, the first thing you taste is a nearly overwhelming sourness, but it mellows fast. Lime is prevalent with a faint taste of sour cherry and strawberry. Winey aftertaste. White wine. Tartness comes after the wine, with very little hop aftertaste as well. Vinous hops. Very watery feel, but after sourness subsides, bitterness gives it some substance. Dry finish.
Beautiful. Complex. This has some flavors I've never had in a sour beer (cherry, strawberry) that I've enjoyed. I want to try it again and again to pick out the other flavors hidden inside. 906 charactersPhilousa, May 01, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 5, 375ml corked and caged offering poured into a long stemmed tulip. The brew appears a hazed golden color with a finger of white head. The cap slowly fades but maintains a layering across the top from continuously rising bubbles of carbonation. A light swirl revives the cap and paints some patches of lacing on the glass.
The aroma of this brew is pretty darn fantastic. It smells lemony and lactic with a fruited quality that is almost like white grape juice. More smells bring out a greater focus on the barrel aging with a scent of moist cork and a bit of sweetness mildly reminiscent of vanilla that integrates so well with the previously described white grape juice scent. This brew has me salivating pretty bad even before I take my first sip. As the brew warms up and is swirled, a bit of a funky cheese note evolves.
The flavor of this brew is quite acidic. This ranks up there with some of the most sour offerings I have had. A flavor of lemony tartness blends into a tannic bacterial spike of acidity that rips the moisture right out of your mouth. The lactic edge gives way to some barrel flavor of moist cork mingled with layers of funk that are somewhat barnyard-like and earthen almost like something along the lines of must and cobwebs? The finish is a mixture of earth and acidity that is so sharp yet dry that you have to dive right back in for another sip. When small sips are taken, this brew really drives home flavors of lemon juice. When bigger gulps are taken, more earthen flavors are present with almost a bit of mineral edge.
This is a light bodied brew with a lively amount of carbonation that is not over done. It is light and lively in the feel with a brutal dryness and acidity to it. This is really a fantastic brew that nearly borders on being too much. I have waiting a very long time to try this and it has met my expectations quite well. The nose on this is unreal and while the flavor is deep and complex, it is a harsh bugger that is not for the faint of heart. I guess this goes without saying, wild ale fans, this is a must-try. 2,078 charactersstakem, May 01, 2012

Pours a slightly hazed perfect gold with a finger of off-white foam that dissipates fairly quickly to a small ring. No lacing.
Aroma of apples and apple cider, white grapes and white wine, citrusy lemon and orange. You can already tell this is wonderfully sour and tart. Some funky yeast.
First sip is a *wallop* of sour, wow. Everything from the nose seems present. Sweet apple cider, bright white wine notes, zesty citrus. Extremely tart through the middle with a tiny bit of relief through the finish. Finish is quite dry, with a lot of dry oak notes. Sweet and sour fruit linger on in the aftertaste. Some funkiness emerges in the finish/aftertaste as well. Alcohol is well hidden.
Medium to medium-light in body, medium slightly-sharp carbonation. Dry finish makes it drinkable, but heavy sourness makes it a sipper.

Interesting beer, not complex but an impressive showcase of the flavors it does have. I imagine it being served ice cold accompanying some delicious fresh seafood. Out of that context maybe it's more of a curiosity. 425 charactersCADMixes, Apr 30, 2012

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Jon for hooking me up with this loooong time Want (it's been on my Wants list for nearly 2 years). Batch 5.
Beer pours a hazy straw color with a moderate white head and minimal lacing. Aroma is fantastic, sour, oak, funk and citrus all blend fantastically, the oak really stands out and it has the funk smell of a Belgian lambic much more than your average American wild. Flavor is very sour and acidic initially, but is very complex. There's a great amount of oak and funkiness to this as well and it has some qualities that remind me of Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze. It comes off somewhere between a wild and a gueuze. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and coats your mouth very nicely. Overall, this is really a fantastic American wild that may come closest to the Belgian style it's modeled after of any American beer I've had. I'm a big fan and glad to have finally gotten a chance to try this after all this time. 926 charactersstarrdogg, Apr 27, 2012

Thanks to everyone who brought this to our DC Sour Tasting; never had it and have wanted to for a while. Got to sample a near vertical, as we had batched 1, PH1, 2, 3, and 4 side by side. I found batches 1 and PH1 very different fro the rest, as they were much sweeter then the others, and found batch 2 to be the sourest, almost too sour. Batch 3 was amazing and my favorite, so the one I'm reviewing. My order went:
3, Ph1, 1, 2, 4
a - Pours a transparent golden color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of tart cherries, sour fruits, citrus, lemon, oak, fruity malts, very acedic. Awesome nose, with just a ton of sour fruits.
t - Tastes of very sour cherries, sour dark fruits, and fruity malts, lemon, citrus, light funk, acedic, oak, vinegar. More sour dark fruit, especially cherries, in the taste, and a inty bit funky. Awesome, perfect tasting sour for me.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Acedic mouthfeel.
o - Overall I thought this was an amazing sour; probably my favorite RR beer to date. All batches of this were very good, btu Batch 3 is unreal right now. Highly recommended, definitely looking for more bottles of this one. 1,221 charactersmdfb79, Apr 24, 2012

Pours a light golden hue with a slight haze. An immediate effervescent fireworks starts occurring in the glass with the tiny bubbles radiating to the quarter inch frothy head. 
Smell is a funkadelic sour and citrus mix. Just a beautiful aroma that reeks of complexity.
So after the first sip you realize the hype is legit. A wonderful marriage of a lemon and sour funk that is smooth but complex just like the aroma. An optimal amount of pucker that is balanced with an almost chardonnay quality that dances in your mouth.
Overall this a phenomenal wild. I would describe the experience as an erection for the taste buds. 634 charactersmetalgdog, Apr 23, 2012

A - Pours a cloudy golden-yellow with a dense white head that settles to a slight pillowy haze.
S - Complex, gueuze-like aromas of cheesy funk, lemon zest, white wine, oak, and green apples. Becomes much more lactic as it warms up, almost like a creamy lemon yogurt. Beautiful, and so very Russian River in execution.
T - Nicely tart, puckering even, with lemon juice, green apple, and unripe pear leading to a astringent woodiness and more cheesy funk. Amazingly drinkable despite the apparently high levels of lactic and citric acid, this is a lovely balance of tart, musty, earthy, and funky. Certainly blended with a deft hand.
M - Crisp, with a medium body, effervescent carbonation, and a dry finish that leaves your teeth squeaking.
O - Another amazing Russian River Wild Ale, as if there was any doubt. While Supplication remains my favorite, this was the one I was most excited to try, and it certainly met my expectations! 1,005 charactersjsanford, Apr 23, 2012

The aroma is heavenly. Notes of lactic acid pair with candied tangerine, tart cherries, waves of oak, and a touch of lemon zest. The taste is quite a journey starting with candied fruits, mainly citrus. A bit of oak and funk comes through next as things quickly head towards the intensely sour side of the spectrum. The finish leaves a lingering tartness on the tongue which leaves you hanging for the next sip. The mouthfeel is effevescent and the body is light. Overall, this is not only a very approachable sour with great balance, but it is damn tastey and well rounded. The hype train surrounds this one for a reason. This is a must try for anyone who enjoys sour beers. 793 charactershomebrew311, Apr 22, 2012

S: Lots of lemon, lots of vinegar kind of smells, a very good amount of an herbal funkiness.
T: Taste follows the nose fairly well, lots of tartness mostly, the funk was a little lost here. It was still there, but not as much as the nose led me to believe. I'll have to see if that changes through aging though, which may be the case. Very sour with lots of lemon and vinegar though.
M: A bit thicker than I expected, but not a "thick beer" by any means. Extremely dry and it feels like the acid just ripped all the enamel off my teeth.
Overall this was pure awesomeness. My favorite sour from RR and one of my favorite beers overall. I can't to see what some more age does to these beasts. 823 charactersBobheed, Apr 18, 2012

Opaque and golden, like a hefe, but without the billowing head. Light clings of lace. Nose is full of earthy funk, chedder cheese (yes cheese), damp wood, citrusy lemon. 
This truly has sour power, perhaps one of the most sour beers I've had. But wait it has balance too! Right off the bat lactic sourness hits you, then a very grungy earthy quality to the taste, with grass and hay. Citrus and lemon lift, more sour. The finish is puckering. Lots of that russian river pedigree from there great oak barrels. I suppose we could call that terrior. Scrubbing bubbles sourness, DRY, lingering lactic finish, just amazing. One of the few beers I've had that is worth the hype, 'nough said. 768 characterspmlondrigan, Apr 17, 2012

Pours bright gold with a finger of white creamy head. Excellent lacing and retention.
Smells as much like a gueuze as any stateside sours I've had. Tart lemon and citrus with an underlying deep funk. Magnificent.
Flavors are similar. Lots of tart lemon and grass up front. Sourness really takes hold after that. Very light delicate flavors still stand out among the sour. Finishes musty and dry.
Creamy mouthfeel with good prickly carbonation.
I'm not sure it's the best sour I've ever had, but it's definitely a great one and something unlike most American Wild Ales. Perfect sourness level. The underlying components still shine through and create a great experience. Very excited to have a few more to age. 789 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 14, 2012
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Russian River Beatification (Batch 005)
I was fortunate enough to score a couple of these from the recent release so a big thanks to my cousin Dan for sending these down from NorCal! Beatification pours a wonderful hazy golden straw color, subtle hues of honey and orange, a thin bubbly white head surfaces, about a finger or so, but dissipates within seconds leaving a vapid layer of film atop the beer. The aroma is fantastic, pungent barnyard funk, wild yeast, sour fruits, acidic citrus, very tropical. It does smell very reminiscent of a gueuze, but so juicy and fruit, not dry at all, I was expecting to have some champagne like dry apples and butter in the nose, but was greeted with some wonderful wet, juicy sour fruit, I could keep my nose in the glass all night. The flavors are just as rewarding, it starts with some wonderful fruit flavors such as pineapple, mango, or papaya, but moves towards some bright citrus, hints of grapefruit, but very lemon heavy. The yeasty funk is less apparent in the flavors, but it does add a nice subtle layer of complexity to the fruitiness and doesn't leave behind any unpleasant aftertastes or dryness. The body is nice, the carbonation is actually very mild, but the acidity and sour profile gives it a feeling as if it were carbonated at higher levels.
Verdict: My words don't do this beer justice, it's truly unbelievable and the hype and hysteria is most certainly deserved. This is quite possibly Russian River's best sour offering and with an already impressive lineup of sour beer, it really is saying something. Whether you call it a Gueuze or an American Wild Ale, this is a must try at all costs for any sour lover. 1,676 characterskevanb, Apr 13, 2012

Hazy, golden yellow liquid sports a full finger of fluffy white head. Solid retention before receding to a thin white layer of foam guarding the surface. Subsequent swirls of my glass awaken the beast within. Good lace.
Nose brings the funk stronger than a James Brown album. Dirty yeast, wild funk, earth & grass, sour fruits; the whole nine yards. Just wonderful.
Sharply tart, funky, and quite sour from the start. Yeast brings in more craziness as the sour fruits make their way to the back of my throat. This incites a grainy, slightly tingly texture or sensation that I've never experienced with a beer before. Puckering sourness lingers as this brew finishes clean & dry. Can safely say that I prefer this over Cable Car '09, '10, and Izzy. Exceptional!
Slightly more creamy and viscous than a typical medium-bodied brew. Active body means plenty of carbonation, and it's done just right in Beatification. Sipping on this incredible brew makes me want to buy vacation property in Santa Rosa. That alone should suffice for my review :)
Beatification is a gueuze treading the same path as Cantillon & Drie Fonteinen, yet Vinnie and the Russian River crew demonstrate their own (masterful) Americanized interpretation of the style with this brew. A landmark American sour, showcasing what's possible in the style when you combine creativity with world-class brewing & blending talent. Ball's in your court, Belgium! 1,494 charactersbrystmar, Apr 12, 2012
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Eric... what else can I possibly say but thanks! I am ever grateful for this, one of my most sought after beers. Thanks. 
375ml. Batch 001. Gentile first pour yields a glowing and absolutely radiant clear, bright, copper/gold liquid with virtually no head and just the smallest appearance of carbonation. Aroma yields loads of tart acicity. Moldy tropical fruit. Wet dog. Foot and BO. Aged cheesy stank. Very light barnyard impression. Musty, acidic basement? The citrus component and funk of the brett and wood really play off each other wonderfully. Doughy, champagne-like yeasty malt quality. Wet rocks and gravel. Shit, I could smell this all day. Acidic, tart and rather minerally on the palate. Tart pineapple, plenty of wood tannin. Acidic, horsey, funky and damn near gueuze-like. As with the nose, the citrus, barrel and yeast aspects all melt together rather seamlessly. The malt component really reminds me of a doughy and bready Champagne, a la Bollinger. Plenty of spritzy carbonation all leading to a fantastically dry, funky, earthy, acidic and rocky finish.
With the yeast added the nose becomes a lot more musty and dank, losing a lot of the citrus component and adding a wholly wonderful layer of cheesy, animal, barnyard funk. Cheesier and moldier on the palate as well. The wood seems to come out more as well. Acidity is toned down on the finish, but the flavor and tangy yeast linger on the tongue for quite a while. Most excellent, but I prefer the bright tang and acidity of the top half of the bottle. Regardless, this a true world class example of the sour ale style and ranks up there with the best of them. Thanks again Eric!
Batch 2: 375ml Bottle. Initial review of the top half of the bottle before the yeast pours.
Holy shit! What a insanely funky and over the top nose! Tart, juicy citrus, white pepper, wood, brett, horse blanket, cow poop, farm. Absolutely wonderful in its complexity. Pours a clear gold. Nearly still. Nearly perfect. Shimmering in all its awesomeness. Flavor is tart and acidic beyond belief. Pineapple, brett, sour, funky. Awesome!
After the yeast. More musty notes emerge. More basement and less farm. Pungent and potent as all hell. White pepper notes emerge. Grapefruit skin. White grape skin and tannin. Assloads of tannic wood. Still acidic but a tad more lush and creamy. Dusty and gravely. Out-freaking-standing! Thanks Mark! 2,390 characterstyler_mn, Apr 11, 2012

T: Sourness in front of tongue. Even more midpalate. Same flavors as in aroma. Slightly bitter, dry aftertaste. Alcohol not found, thank god, because that is my main complaint about American sours (including most other RR's).
M: Carbonation is medium. Body is, of course, bone dry, but with plenty of acidity to balance.
O: Extremely drinkable. I compared this side-by-side with Sanctification and found it much more complex, sour, and balanced. Slightly disappointing, since I can find Sanctification much more easily. I guess you really need to let nature do its work without intervening to create a thing of beauty. Get it if and while you can. 1,009 charactersjibbyvonjibb, Apr 07, 2012

Murky, pale golden. Tiny and fizzy yellowish head, leaving nothing behind.
Lemon citrus, slight funk grass and some cedar on the nose.
Earthy and grassy flavors at first, with a ton of carbonation. Very active in the mouth. Big, citric tartness, lemon mostly, nearing a sourness. Finish is a slowly fading, juicy lemon flavor, not overly dry for the amount of carbonation. A funkiness and light pepper spicing develops as the beer warms, adding deeper layers to the flavor.
Phenomenal. Easily the best American wild ale I've had, topping even Cable Car. 595 characterslitheum94, Apr 04, 2012

A: A slightly hazy (but not completely opaque) yellow/golden. Light sediment on the bottom.
S: Sharp oakiness, vanilla, sourness. Maybe grapes, as well.
T: Lots of oak and vanilla, and very sour. Apricots and floral notes, definitely grapes. Very delicious. The fruity and floral flavors, especially, come out after the beer warms up above cellar temperature. Very clean finish, with no lingering aftertaste (except maybe a certain subtle and pleasant one).
M: Low on carbonation, but very acidic / sour.
O: An excellent beer. Almost as good as American sour beers get. However, at the price point (even directly from RR, which only offers 375 mL bottles), it's not worth quite the hype that it gets. Just keep in mind that - if you can find them - Cantillon and 3F gueuzes are actually cheaper per volume. Heck, a Cuvee Renee is 1/3 the price and is comparable quality (though some may disagree)! If you get the chance, try this beer. Just don't lose an arm and a leg for it. It is not a spiritual experience. 1,157 charactersshleepy, Apr 04, 2012

Batch 5 - Bottled 1/10/12
A - The most sunshine vibrant yellowish orange I may have ever seen, minimally somewhat cloudy in the 10oz wine glass I poured it in. Sunshine in a glass. Similar color to the bottle's label but much more BEAutifil. Active, begging for a whiff. Would get a perfect 5 with good head & retention...
S - Complexities really begin to come through as it warms - especially that barnyard funk. Citrus included oranges and lemons, some pineapple and this beer smells nice and tart. Very welcoming. I'm on the fence with a lot of sours but I knew I was going to really enjoy this one at first smell.
T&M - Follows nose. I am amazed at how freaking refreshing and crisp this beer is. At only 6% it's still a nice sipper on a warm sunny day. Clean crisp bone dry finish, I mean...even if your not a fan of the style, you usually can still tell when you're drinking a high quality specimen which Beatification most definately is. Pretty blown away I must say.
O - Usually, I don't find myself wanting much more than 10-12oz of most sours but I could have sapped back on 3 of these easily. SO refreshing, SO crisp, SO clean, and such a nice bone drying finish that kept me wanting more. I'm told and assuming age will make this beer better as it usually does this style, but I really couldn't imagine where it could have improved or how it could have been better. Admittedly, I'm not new to the style but new to appreciating it and finally feeling confident in my ability to critique or review sours properly. Great freaking stuff! 1,795 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Apr 03, 2012

Flavor has a nice bitter, funky, horsey, lemon character. There is a bit of sweetness and a lot of clean tartness. Some of the acetic sourness reminds me a bit of consecration in a great way. Quite gueuze like. Mouthfeel is light, dry, great carbonation, very nice beer. I was expecting a ton from russian river and they delivered for me. Great sour.

Batch 3
poured into goblet
Color: Golden to blonde with a few orange highlights. A thin white bubbly head appears but quickly reduces to a white ring around the glass. Leaves behind some head retention, but no lace.
Nose: Extreme and complex. Sourness, barnyard textures, funk, lemon scent, and mellow grassy notes.
Palate: Like heaven on the tongue. Extremely drinkable for how sour it is. The carbonation is perfect, no trace of alcohol and its tingles your taste buds. As this beer sits in your mouth waves of sour lemon and oak coat the tongue , later the grassy notes appear in soft gentle way. Truly well crafted.
Finish: Long and dry with plenty of layers. Tart and funky, sour and lightly fruity, and yea very drinkable till the last drop. A masterful sour!

A: Hazy pale amber body with a handful of coarse white bubbles. Decent, but uninspiring.
S: Funk + acid. Wow. Floral, citrus, and tropical aromas overlaid atop pure sourness. This is AWA perfection: complex, powerful, and simply overwhelming.
T: Soft fruitiness up front, pure lemony sourness thereafter. A bit of floral funk, and just lovely pure sourness. Great. My only complaint is that I would have liked a bit more dirtiness from the funk, but I'll take the enamel-ripping sourness and be happy with it.
M: Creamy, lively medium body. Perfect.
O: This one lived up to its reputation: brutally sour, incredibly delicious, and simply wonderful. Worth seeking out.

Thanks for opening this with me, schmoopsbeer!
(Aged for 3+ years)
Hazy golden and yellow with orange highlights and a pillowy, finger and a half high, nearly white head, that leaves the glass messy with sheets of lace.
The aroma is far more funky than I would have presumed along with with huge amounts of sour acidity rushing up from the glass as well. The funk comes in waves of barnyard, hay, and leather, while the sourness has strong apple, pear, and lemon accents. Strong, aggressive, and fantastic aroma. The Brett and the sourness combine incredibly well.
The flavor is just as amazing and even more complex, with the Brett, barnyard, horse blanket, hay notes coming through very strongly, right alongside the big, tart lemon sourness making one's jowls quiver. Complete, funky, sour, delicious, drinkable--all words I'd use to describe this bottle.
Medium bodied with high carbonation. A treat to drink.
One of my all-time favorites. 974 charactersehammond1, Feb 14, 2012

batch 004
a - poured a murky fuzzy orangey yellow with a thin fizzy head. the bottle was a gusher.
s - black pepper funk. sweet tarts. like a russian river sour on funk steroids.
t - WHOA that's a funky sour! sour grapefruit. like the juice they used to give me in day camp when i needed something thirst quenching, yet instead ended up having dried out puckered mouth. the oak is in there, but under the sour flavoring. smarties and sweet tarts.
m - PUCKERING - super sour.
o - extremely sour. not for the faint of heart. nearly knocked me down at first. all that being said, it didn't seem much different than the standard russian river sours, which in my opinion are just as good as this. this is definitely on the overly sour side.

Notes from a tasting on 8/15. big thanks to totoropanda for bringing this one.
appearance was just like the other batches i've tried, a murky orange. smell was super sour and tart in the nose with some floral kicks to it. taste was also extremely sour and sweet tart with some floral notes. the beer has a really nice feel to it. not prickly but close to it. this is a really solid beer, very balanced and extremely drinkable for such a sour beer. i found that i liked this batch better than batch 4, but not as much as batch 5. 1,473 characterscosmicevan, Feb 11, 2012

Wild ale brewed in the Gueuze way if I am not mistaken.
 750 ml cork and caged bottle enjoyed at Monk's Table. Split with a friend. Poured into a tall, flute like glass. Feels good to slay a whale!
 Clear golden with a good white head. Very carbonated, almost fizzy. Aroma is funk, lactic acid and diaper. Tastes intensely and insanely sour with notably less funk compared to the aroma. Strong lemon, medium oak with a slightly tannic and bitter finish.
 Very very crisp and bone dry, although the later part of the bottle drank slightly mellower. I like it by all means but I don't see the demand. It was worth the 50 dollars spent only because of its reputation. Assuming that it is fair to compare it to other Gueuze, it's not top shelf.

Bottle to snifter
Vintage: Batch 2
From notes. I opened this bottle at bspringer's birthday celebration. An epic night for sure to celebrate his golden day of birth!
A: Bright sunshine. No head on medium pour - just a few bubbles.
S: Burnt hay, green apple, barnyard, funk, oak, lemon zest and hint of spice.
T: Beautiful balance of sour, tart, and sweet. Loads of funk up-front with a soft balance of citrus fruit and hay towards the back. Quite they dry finish, but simply perfect!
M: Light body with zero carbonation.
O: This beer is truly a work of art! So crisp, to-the-point, and just awesome. Definitely worth seeking out and making a point to try. I look forward to trying other batches at some point in the future and am stoked that Vinnie & Co. at Russian River are continuing to produce this beer. 827 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 28, 2012

Pours a slightly hazy, bright gold color with a medium white head that goes down quickly. Scent is funky with nice lemon aromas. There is also a bit of sweat aroma in the nose as well. Lovely wild yeast scents and citrus with just the right amount of funk. Taste is very oaky at first with intense lemon and sharp, bitter funk from the wild yeast. A bit of cheese as well. Nice blend of lemon, funk, and sour. Mouthfeel is very crisp and refreshing. Puckering. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is the first time I've had this beer, and RR has yet to disappoint. I'm not regretting waiting in line for 3 hours for a few bottles of this. 693 charactersDovaliHops, Jan 10, 2012

Pours a bright, peachy, warm goldenrod. A nice head forms and immediately dies, leaving absolutely no foam. 4
Reminds me of Lost Abbey sours in the nose. Lots of tropical and stone fruits are apparent, possibly derived from the touch of acetobacter present in the ph1 barrel. Sweet, ripe, sun warmed fresh off the tree peaches, minimal phenolic funk. Beautiful. 5
Fresh ripe peaches, must cellar funk, citrus pith bitterness, tangy acetobacter. Age is detectable but this beer is amazing. Holding up well and just fantastic. 4.5
Nice full carbonation, does just fine here. 4
So lucky to be trying this. Really spectacular and worlds better than batch 001. A different beer than future batches, really something special. 5
Batch 002
Pours clear and bright golden, no head. 4
Smells dank and stanky. Marijuana, enteric funk, dirt, tangy nectarines. Incredibly tart, lactic sourness is ridiculous. Damp, musty wood and cellar-ness. 5
Earth, damp oak, lemons (juice and pith), so funky and so sour. This stuff is ridiculous. 4.5
Nice carbonation, leaves your mouth puckered, bone dry, and tannin'd. 4
Fantastic stuff. Really cool try it next to pH1. Way more sour and funky. One of the best American wilds out there. 5
Batch 003, reviewed 12/15/2008, 3 years before the rest of this vertical.
Appearance: It was simply beautiful. I poured it into an almost completely spherical goblet and it looked like a beautiful glowing orb reminiscent of the sun. The head quickly receded, but lasted long enough for me to get some great aroma. 4.5
Smell: Magnificent! Pure cheesy, barnyard, horse blanket funk. I was hoping the flavor would deliver like the scent did... 5
Taste: This was damn good. Super sour lemons initially, then that barnyard funk hits. It finishes with the flavor of a well aged ripe cheese. 5
Mouthfeel: My saliva glands exploded as it hit my mouth. You know when you drink a really gnarly lambic? Yeah, like that. It was crispy yet smooth. It burnt my chapped lips something fierce. Oh yeah. 4.5
Drinkability: I thought I wouldn't want a whole bottle, so I split it with my friend, but I could have sipped on this all night. It was great how the flavor developed as it warmed, and every sip was an explosion of flavor. It probably takes someone who has really acquired the taste of really wild sours to love this, but if you like this style and you get one of the 750ml bottles, keep it to yourself!
Overall, this was a real treat. I wish it was not so expensive, but I will have to get one or two more bottles. This jumped into my top 5 beers. Easily. 4.5
Batch 004. Thanks, Craig.
Pours clear and bright straw with a nice head which recedes into a thin film. 4.5
Smells lemony, funky, powdery, and citric. Smarties also make a guest appearance. 4.5
Lemony and sour at first sip. Musty, damp oak is prominent and lasts long into the finish. This is beatification alright. 4
Mouthfeel is great. Very full from dense carbonation. Light on the palate but not at all too effervescent. 4.5
Good stuff. Less complex and funky than it's predecessors, but I look forward to seeing what it does with age. 4.5 3,144 charactersMrFootstones, Dec 22, 2011

Pale, hazy daffodil. Poured directly into the bottom of the glass, not much head is raised, but what I get is a thin, watery, airy white.
Funky nose. Tons of hay and barnyard aromas. Herbal mint and basil mix with dried lemon peel and hints of strawberry. Perfect balance, crazy complex.
In the flavor, the perfect amount of stale hay mixes with vinegary dried lemon peel and soft touches of wheat. The swallow brings an intense blast of tart lemon, vinegar and the perfect amount of fruity sweetness. Kind of like a yellow skittle, but miles more complex, and with hay and soft basil sprinkled throughout. Just. So. Smooth. 
Fairly gentle, prickly carbonation excites the medium-light body as it moves across the tongue, but doesn’t display the crazy fizziness usually found in beers like this. If there is any alcohol it’s hard to notice amidst the tartness that’s currently causing me heartburn. I can feel it coating my mouth and eating away at my teeth. 
I’m most impressed by the perfect balance of funk in here. It’s heavily tart, but there’s enough sweetness an barnyard to temper it and keep me going back sip after sip. 
Batch 2: both funkier and fruitier in the nose than batch 2. Strawberries, wheat, maybe even some pear. Loads of funk, dried lemon peel. Little more sour than batch three, the tartness hits a completely different part of my jowls. Interestingly, as it’s become sweeter and fruitier in the nose, it’s become far more tart in the flavor. Not an improvement, not a step backward. Just different. 
Ph1: this is a completely different beer. The nose is sweet and floral, with lots of honey, caramel, pear, lilac and cinnamon. On the palate, it’s a bit overcarbonated, exploding into bubbles that make the brew hard to taste. Same in the flavor, though: lilac, honey, caramel, pear. Compared to later Beatifications, this is lighter, more delicate, sweeter and more floral, with none of the aggressive tartness of the others. I like how different it is. Redemption is the base beer here, which makes sense. 2,259 charactersPhelps, Dec 21, 2011

Smells a little lactic with sourness. Some funk, not much. Tart with lemon, peach, and grapefruit.
Tastes really sour, similar to the nose. Lemon, grapefruit, some sour cherries. Not much funk like a Cantillon, but a really clean, crisp, well done sour beer. As it warms it makes my cheeks pucker more. Good carbonation, with some oak tannins to dry my mouth.

Batch 002
Only a small amount of white head forms and immediately fades to a cap on about ½ of the surface. The beer is a bright brass color with the absolute slightest haze . No lacing to speak of.
Pungent with lactic notes, lots of earthy notes and some sharp funk. Very complex aroma. A sense of lemon.
Woow, sour to say the least. Some white wine notes, lemon peel, tart vinegar, A touch of granny smith apple and then some oak at the finish. Drinks a bit like a gueuze to be honest. The tart notes mingle with the oak at the end to produce an interesting finish. The real funky notes continue to emerge as it warms. 
Very light and refreshing. A sense of delicateness here.
 While this is very good, I still think Supplication is my favorite of their line-up. 911 charactersReagan1984, Nov 24, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I first had this beer on my first trip to CA, and my original review is below this one. It's been about 2 years (to my detriment) since I've had a bottle of this batch, and I'm kicking myself for it. In any case, here goes - happy birthday, me! 
Served in the original RR -tion tulip (this glass is no longer made and is now a whale IMO), this beer is crystal clear, straw yellow and has a dense, frothy off-white head with excellent retention and minimal lacing. The nose makes me smile. Beautiful overripe lemons, an insane level of funk with cheese, sweaty feet and just an incredible explosion of fruit (unripe white peaches, ripe honeydew melons). The sourness is beautifully citric in nature with some lactic acid no acetic acid. In fact, I will go as far as say that this is an impeccable gueze, it really does remind me of the better batches of Girardin 1882, and my all time favorite, the 1999 Oude Gueuze. The only thing that sets it apart is a light sweetness that's present, very mildly corn-like, and this is not something I've found in a gueuze worth gushing about. Even a little bit of white grapes? As I let it breathe, I get an intense, salty, cheesey, funky aroma. I'm starting to see the beginnings of a musty, mushroomy, wet wood-like funk to the nose that I'm going to enjoy revisiting in a year or so.
Opening and closing with a palate crushing sourness that is remarkably clean in its blend of citric and lactic qualities, this is a remarkable beer. Again, there's plenty of unripe stone fruits, semi-raw grapes, mellow melons, all topped off with a dollop of soured yogurt, this some seriously intense and good stuff. In particular, the yogurty sourness is of note, as it exemplifies what happens when the citric and lactic sourness play off each other. The sourness does hide some of the funk here, not really allowing the wet hay and grass to come through( unlike batch 3, which is a better balanced beer IMO). Under all the sourness, a bit of cereal sweetness does come through, a little grainy and a little corn like. Sour with lemons and a brilliant lactic sourness (I can't think of too many better showcases for lactic acid), this beer finishes with some tannic character. Light in body, medium-high in carbonation, this beer is wonderfully carbonated and wonderfully executed.
This beer , and this batch in particular, is probably the best lambic-type beer brewed in the US. Yes, batch 3 is a better drinking sour, but this batch has a certain je ne sais quoi to it. Far better than Duck Duck Gooze, on par or slightly better than Isabelle IMO. I traded too many of these away, but at least I got to make some friends in the process. A remarkable beer that I'm going to be sad to see gone.

S: Complex with notes of sour, vinegar, spice (black pepper), oak and a mild sweetness. There's an earthy slant to it. This is a great gueuze ! As it warms up, there's a hint of vanilla too, if you swirl hard enough.
T: Massive sourness with a lot of acidity. There's a hint of fruitiness that comes in - apple? The finish is dry and puckering tart. Definitely among the sourest beers i've tasted - it leaves my mouth watering
M: Lively carbonation on the tongue, sour and incredibly so with a dry finish.
D: I'll be honest - this is a new style to me and the acidity is in your face but i know this one's a gem as it keeps me coming back
These sours are growing on me and i'm glad i have a couple of bottles stashed away to come back to when i better appreciate the style
**Edit 12 May 2012**
I got a couple of these from Chebyshev. Thank you, Aaron! Batch 5 (aka 011012)
Pouring lighter than I remember it being, but still with excellent carbonation and head retention. The nose is a beautiful bright citrusy funk, with grass and hay. Combining the pure grassy funk of batch 3 with the bright acidity and melon and fruit notes of batch 2, this is a beautiful blend. A little bit of honey, graham crackers and a whiff of ethyl lactate (fruity, coconutty. No acetic acid is perceived, though the lactic acid esters do contribute a fruity sharpness.
Like batch 2, this is pretty hugely sour, but not as intensely so. Prominently lactic with some lime rind and citrusy acidity as well. Mild tannins and the lactic acid really brings to mind unripened stone fruit (yellow freestone peaches, nectarines). The funk level is tempered by the sourness, but grass, and straw are quite prominent. Mildly cheesy as well. Drying on the finish with lingering lactic acid, some oak tannins (that lend a chewiness), this beer is crisply carbonated. Highly sour, this is pretty excellent 4.5/4.5/4/4.5/4.5 4,775 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 19, 2011

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Batch 3. Thanks to readbaron and Dunt for bringing this to our WaLe tasting.
Appearance: This pours a dark, cloudy golden tangerine color with a small eggshell collar and no real lacing.
Smell: The aroma has some lactic and soft funky notes, but it is mostly sour. Lemon, peach, and grapefruit all provide the fruit tartness.
Taste: The flavor has an incredible sour flavor. It starts with lemon and grapefruit, with some peach, white grape, and a bit of cherry later on. Some grass and hay get lost with the light malt; if I really look for it I can get a little bit, but the tartness is overwhelming.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation and body are standard for the style, with an absolutely incredible tartness. Some light oak tannins dry it out a bit, but the sour is so deep and full that my mouth is constantly watering while I work through my glass. 
Overall: This is one of the most puckering and blistering sour wilds I have had - I absolutely love it. It reminds me of an incredibly tart gueuze. 1,044 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 30, 2011

A: Pours a hazy, straw yellow with a faint white head which fades quickly.
N: Super funky and horse blanket, pungent musty hay.
T: Throat clenching sour, lemon, peaches, oak notes. Very tart.
M: Lip smacking sour. Bright, clean.

Appearance – Poured into a Cantillon tulip with a hazy golden hay color. About an inch of fizzy head is achieved with a moderate pour that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving slight lacing.
Smell – Unbelievable funk and sour notes up front. Leather, wet hay, oak, citrusy fruit, and acidic aromas.
Taste – Yes. YES. This is what I was hoping for. An utterly intense puckering sourness up front – almost brazenly so. Green apples, lemon, peach, oak, wet hay, slight lactic, and more earthy flavors. Fan-freaking-tastic.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, plentiful carbonation, finishes quite dry.
Overall – The highlight of this crazy day for me. After having so many good beers (read BA Cuir, Zwanze 2011, Lou Pepe Kriek, 007, PvW Eclipse, BA Decedance, and Blåbær) this was the stand out. While 007 was somewhat “similar”, it was more balanced. This was just a in your face mouth puckering sour. I was hoping I would hate this so I didn’t have to try and find more, but alas, that was not the case. One of my favorite beers. I can’t wait to get more of this. Thanks again so much to Alex for sharing this. 1,275 charactersSpdKilz, Oct 20, 2011

Can't thank Troy enough for this extremely generous gift.
Between my new job and our wedding anniversary, today seems like the perfect day to pull this one out of the cellar end enjoy it with the wife.
A faint pop as I remove the cork. The white head is fleeting, leaving a cloudy golden body. Looks like a saison, but with a smaller head.
Apple cider vinegar, tropical fruit brett; a sour, funky aroma.
One of the most complex American beers I have ever tasted. Pineapple, lemon juice, brett, lactic acid, no real oak flavor. Deep fruit notes combine with a complex sourness. Up there with the best Belgian Lambics as far as I'm concerned. Can't put it into words, just fantastic. 695 charactersBradLikesBrew, Oct 11, 2011

Color is golden and murky with no head. smell is surprisingly clean with vague fruit notes and some minor funk. Taste is intensely sour and puckering with some citrus notes. The taste is one-dimensional in that the sourness is the overwhelming characteristic, though still very pleasant. Body is light. I enjoyed this, though there isn't that much to say. Perhaps the most sour beer I've had. 401 charactersBlanco, Oct 03, 2011

Glowing yellow color, white head.
Lemony, bretty aroma. Signature Russian River wild smell which is usually very clean an anything but offensive. Slight phenolic plastic smell.
Leathery brett tinged witha sharp lemon acidity. Not an overly powering acidity. I think it's fairly well balanced between the sourness and funk for an American wild. Clean flavor profile. Bitter, drying brett aftertaste. Not a lasting sourness. Cleans off the palate fairly quickly. 472 charactersBearsOnAcid, Sep 26, 2011

This one pours a light to medium bodied melted butter in appearance with a light white lacing. It smells of light Granny Smith apples with some apricot and peaches. This is officially the first beer to make me pucker. Wow! This is mind blowingly sour. It is just so tart and you don't get killed with brett its really astonishing. What a sour! As far as sours go, this is a sipper, an utter palate destroyer. Phenomenal, phenomenal beer. 574 charactersaasher, Sep 25, 2011

A - A finger of white foam settles to pretty much nothing. Lightly hazed golden orange body.
S - Funk, stone fruits, oak, white wine vinegar, horse blanket, hay, and other farmy notes. Extremely gueuze-like.
T - That is also quite excellent, with plenty of tart and sour grapes, white wine, green apple, brash farmy funk, and a mildly acetic finish.
M - Medium-low carbonation, medium in body, super dry and tannic finish. Crisp and refreshing.
D - A great beer, although I think I prefer the increased acidity of Batch 002. Still, this is the most Belgian of the "easily" available American Wild Ales. When I shared it with a highly regarded brewer his first two guesses were beers from Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen. I'm not sure there's a greater compliment I could give.
Will add in my thoughts on Batch 002 when I get around to opening my last bottle. Highly recommended stuff - I'm anxiously looking forward to Batch 004. Wish this still came in 750mls. 1,052 charactersMasterSki, Sep 19, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 2. The brew pours a hazy yellow hue and is topped with some wispy bubbles; just enough head to demonstrate liveliness. The nose is, whew, musky and hugely atomized. It is getting into my sinuses like Vernors ginger ale does (strange observation, I know...) Anyhow, the aroma is musky and lemon-zesty and just very pert all-around. The taste is just absolutely fantastic; it is the sourest a thing can be without crossing the line into a flagrant level. Notes of lemon, green apple, wet wood, overripe peaches (or maybe underripe?), wet dog, Warhead candy and a small amount of tart white grape reveal tremendous complexity within the sourness. The feel is pert for the most part, but it has an amazingly clean finish. Having had Batch 2 and 3, I must say I prefer 2. It is far more sour, disparately flavored and heavily nuanced; whereas I recollect 3 to be far more harmonious, juicy and less tart. Overall, one of the better American Wilds I've ever had. 962 charactersktrillionaire, Sep 03, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thank you jeff-Alewatcher for splitting a batch 003 750 with Chad quest and myself. 
This beer pours out a beautiful hazy blonde with hints of amber. The head is almost nonexistent with a thin ring around the edges. The smell puts off a big oaky character, with hints of funky fruit...hinting toward apricot. The main thing I get out of this is a big dry oaky tingle. The citrus acidity on the backside to this beer is incredible, the back of my tongue and cheeks are pulled so tight. This is what I'll expect from a "sour" from now on. The finish on this beer lasts forever, I can't believe how incredible this beer is. A life goal has been fulfilled...thank you again jeff and Chad for sharing this moment with me! 717 charactersPhineasGage, Sep 02, 2011

Batch 002
A - Crystal clear golden hue with some fizzy bubbles creating a head that fades rather quickly to leave a nearly non existant head.
S - Wow, great sour funk notes. Grapefruit, acids, and horse blanket.
T - Wow again. Stuff is tasty. Super sour and tart citrus right up front followed by great funk. The combination makes it mouth watering, which is crazy considering this stuff is War Heads candy sour.
M - Great mouthfeel too. So mouth puckeringly sour. Its super sour and dry, yet nice and refreshing.
O - Holy cow this was delicious. I LOVE sour, and this was hands down the most sour beer I've ever had. Stuff was great. So many great aspects to this beer. Wish I had more. 747 charactersrudzud, Aug 28, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5First off, a huge thanks to ArrogantB who threw this in a box he sent me. Long time want, and a real treat to have. Poured from the 375ml into a Russian River tulip, this is a batch 002.
A dizzying golden hue with frothy bubbles after pouring that dissipate after a minute or two to leave no foam on the top of the beer. Sporadic bubbles slowly move their way to the top.
Barnyard aroma with lots of grapefruit and dusty funk. Forward with tingling acidic citrus, and a backbone of funk best described as horse blanket. Lots more airy funk as the beer warms a bit.
Puckering, abrasive citrus notes at first. Raw grapefruit and lemon juices. So strong they dry out the insides of my cheek and surface of my tongue. This stuff is nuclear, and could probably strip paint if it were put to the test. After that fades, a cheesey funk comes in. Like goat cheese, real earthy and gives your mouth a break from the puckering. Leaves a mouth watering tart citrus flavor in your mouth, that keeps your jaw clinched and your mouth salivating.
Easily the most puckering beer I've had. Medium body and wet, but dries your mouth out due to the acidity in the beer. Quenching and mouth watering between sips. Spotty carbonation that can't even be detected due to the tartness of the beer. Truly a work of art in this regard.
An acidic and ultra aggressive yet tasteful citrus flavor with a mild cheesy funk. However, the aroma of citrus and barnyard is definitely understated compared to the flavor of this beer. An absolutely mind numbing sour ale from Russian River. Probably the most sour beer I've ever had. Can't wait to try other batches of this one. 1,646 charactersauroracrisis, Aug 12, 2011

Poured into my Bruery snifter. Looks really nice, intensely yellow with a present whitish head. The nose is vinegar funk, baby diaper (I think I finally understand what this disgusting sounding descriptor means), wood, and some lemon rind. The taste is like the nose (lemon rind, wood, funky, vinegar, maybe a touch of sweetness from white grape and/or peach?) with an important difference - there's an aggressive sourness that hits the back of the throat. It's not the sourness of a Fou Foune, instead, this was as though someone took unflavored sour candy powder and just dumped it in the brew. An effervescent sourness that elicits gas (via a burp) and tests the strength of my lower esophageal sphincter at containing the contents of my stomach. Overall, this beer is actually pretty hard to drink, physically. Left me with almost immediate heartburn, way more so than other funky beers including C+C LaFolie, Fou Foune, JJ Blauw, etc. The more hardcore sourheads with me liked it a lot. To me, this beer had no subtlety to it. Had an opportunity to try a lot of rarer sours recently, and this one was not near the top.
EDIT: lots can change in 9 months. Had b005 several times recently and it is crazy good. Edited well up to reflect this. 1,290 charactersseeswo, Aug 06, 2011

A - Hazy, golden amber colored beer with only the slightest bit of white head. Sheets and curtains of lace cascaded down the sides throughout drinking this eventually fading to some finer lace and spots.
S - Brett, as expected. Great tart and funk notes. The aroma turns the slightest bit vinous due to some pleasant vinegar that seems to be there. Slight bit of wood and some fruity sweetness coming through.
T - Nicely sour, with a little bit of a pucker-drawing taste. Some sweet lighter fruit that immediately turns tart. The brett is pretty much present through the whole thing, ending with some barrel notes, mainly in the form of wood.
M - Medium bodied beer with active carbonation and a dry finish.
O - Really great beer, not sure how much this varies batch to batch but this was a big time winner and awesome example of an American Wild. Really no complaints with this one, would love to drink it regularly. 932 charactersAgentZero, Jul 22, 2011

A-Pours hazy dark gold with no head, just a ring of brilliant white bubbles around the rim of the glass.
S-Bright, fruity. Underripe peaches, pears, a touch of white vinegar, barnyard funk.
T/M-This has changed a lot. The first thing I notice is the tannic dry mouthfeel. The tart acidity up front gives way to this drying, mouth coating characteristic. With each sip, it opens up a little more. Some nice leather and musty flavors. Thin and sharp mouthfeel, with low carbonation and a thinning, lemony finish.
O-More friendly and approachable than fresh bottles. A few years does this beer a world of good, though I am a big fan of it fresh as well. 702 charactersDaveHS, Jul 16, 2011

Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! Batch 003! I have been lucky as of late to knock out quite a few of my brews needed for my Russian River -tion Quest and this one is NO exception! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a one finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, and funk. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, sour, tart, funk, and wood. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was nothing short of excellent in all aspects! This one was a standout from the tasting that night for just about all of the participants. The flavor on this one was otherworldly sour and definitely brought the duck-face HARD! Even from the aroma you would get a partial duck-face going. Definitely well rounded in flavor though as the fruit and woodiness added a nice touch to keep your palate guessing rather than just drop-kicking it with sour and tart notes. Really really well done... Hope to try some older batches in the future for comparison (hint hint traders...) 1,263 charactersthagr81us, Jun 28, 2011

Mr. Arbitrator had the courtesy to wax a cork and cage, so 15 minutes after stabbing it with a knife I was able to pour it for the crew.
A- Strong, dynamic yellow, like lemon gatorade. Well, not that intense, but close. Low carbonation settles to a faint outer ring.
S- Earthy, musty, funky. Sour. 
T- Strong bitter/sour lemon rind, building to a heavy tartness that is borderline mouth-puckering. Faint wet grass, some mild strawberry sweetness in the finish. Really unique. 
M- Very tart- crisp apple and lemon gumdrops.

A light fizzy head that barely exists, slight hazy golden wheat color.
Nose has lots of sour tart, some barnyard funk, bready funk, light citrusy as well.
Taste has a weird banana like fruit at first, then tons of acidity, some sour malts, mouth puckering!, light bit of fruit, touch of creamy malts, little bready and a touch of light funk, then some oak rounding, but just long sour and tartness, gland bashing sour.
Mouth is medium bodied with decent carbonation and super sour.

A - Golden color with minimal head, no sediment, a some carbonation. A small head forms, and dissipates quickly to leave nothing behind.
S - All sour and funk. Almost like a white wine, there is a smell of grapes and green apples. 
T - Lots of sourness, with a ton of flavors. Lemons, grapefruit, grapes, apples, and oak. Wish this was a bigger bottle, as 4oz was just not enough to really appreciate it. 
M - Carbed well, lighter body. Just feels right for the style. Finishes with a dry sourness that lingers for a bit. Well done.
O - Batch 3 was my favorite beer of all time, and now this one has taken that over. This is a beer that could age forever, and just get better. Can't wait to open another. 727 charactersBeerThursdays, Jun 01, 2011

this beer is the most sour beer that I have ever had. This is the only thing I will talk about because of how sour it was. It was like I took everything I knew about sour beers, and blew my entire mind. Beatification made me literally lose all thought as I took a drink, it shocked me that much. At the same time, this might be its downfall. There would be no way that I could get this beer down on my own or even between two people, it is so sour. Excellent taste, great beer. 573 charactersrhodeska, May 25, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 1 and Batch 3 tasted side-by-side, thanks to Joe and Grant for sharing!
Batch 1 pours a hazy deep orange color while Batch 3 pours a lighter and clearer orange-yellow color. Both have half-finger white heads that dissipate into thin rings around the glass leaving decent lacing.
Batch 1 smells of light malts with large amounts of lightly tart citrus and mild amounts of funk. Batch 3 smells of light malts as well; however the citrus is far more tart and the funk is more prominent, with hints of vinegar.
Both taste similar to how it they smell. Batch 1 features light malt flavors kicking things off and equally parts sweet and tart light citrus coming in shortly thereafter. Slight wet hay and leather influences come into play midway through the sip, carrying through to a moderately tart ending. As with the aroma, Batch 3 has much sharper tart citrus influences. Additionally, the funk influence is more robust but of a similar profile to Batch 1.
The mouthfeel for both is good. Solid thickness with active carbonation.
Drinkability is great for Batch 1 and very good for Batch 3.
Overall I slightly preferred Batch 1, but not by much. Batch 1 was better integrated and the niceties of everything were allowed to shine. Batch 3 was much larger and the flavors popped, but I found some of the nuances were overpowered when compared to Batch 1. Both are world-class beers and severely worth a shot.

Golden yellow with nice clarity. A one-finger head recedes and the beer is perfectly still, waiting.
Huge lemon-lime acidity. White vinegar. Some mushroom funkiness, hay, and light must.
Vaguely reminiscent of a gueuze, albeit with an extra dose of citric acidity. A hint of oak lasts unattended for the first second, then a nice blend of lemon-juice acidity, green apple tang, and just a tiny bit of citrus (orange?) sweetness near the finish. Very acidic, very tart, very vinegary – if B2 is every more acidic, I’ll pass. There’s a discernible though almost overwhelmed oak tannic and mushroom earthiness throughout, most noticeable as a contrast to the sweeter notes. Mostly acidic though.
Medium, medium light and surprisingly slick, if not oily, the finish lingers on and on. Lower carbonation. When life gives you lemons –
One of the best wild ales out there, at least in my experience. The gueuze comparisons are inevitable, though this is less balanced and more overtly tart and less funky than befits that style. So clean and sharp, though not without its rawness. A treat, and one of the bars for the style. 1,190 charactersVerecund, May 05, 2011

I am going to break from my usual review format for this unusual beer. 
The aroma hits very sour with a healthy dose of strong funk, it is really a lot to take in, but given some time you can peel back the layers and start to pick out some grapefruit and some very light grain. I was getting a little bit of vinegar quality, but it was overwhelmingly lactic with that dirty sour that I find to have a little more depth. The flavor is much the same, but the acidity steps up a notch again. I found it to be less fruity than Belgian examples I have had, but there was still a little grapefruit. Again, primarily I was getting dirty musty funk and really very sharp acids. The longer I sipped the deeper it got, I started to get more summery fruits and the finish even got slightly peppery. The feel was so acidic little cuts on my lip started to sting, very dry and very carbonated. I want to be careful about comparing this beer to Lambic, but the similarities are there and voiced by the brewer, and it really does live up. Given the opportunity I would pick this over several imported varieties. 
I think the beauty of this beer is really in the details. Tasting a Lambic style beer known to be fermented and conditioned with yeast and bacteria native to a region other than the Senne valley that is so complex and delicious is inspiring. The impact of this beer is an illustration that although a true Lambic cannot be produced elsewhere, a complex, balanced, and truly interesting top shelf product can be made in other regions, and shows the true potential of the American Wild movement. I believe that an increased interest in this beer could be a key contributor to the increased legitimacy of beer as a gourmet product. Nice work Russian River, keep doing more of the same. 1,852 characterslarsenju, May 02, 2011

Batch 3 poured into Lost Abbey Tumbler. Slightly hazy straw yellow with a tiny white head fades to a collar. Smells musty and lemony sour. Not sweet at all, some white grapes, very funky. Taste is incredibly sour and lactic. Slightly metallic, citric, very acidic, funky barnyard, how many ways can I say sour. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Overall, this is a great American Wild. Intensely sour, this reminds me more of some of the great Belgians then any American sour I have had. 609 charactersnkersten, Apr 16, 2011

Pours a clear amber with with a small white head that has decent retention and leaves a bunch of small spots of lacing on glass. Aroma is very funky with big grapefruit and a mineral presence. Also a big of oak and some champagne yeast. Initial taste is huge tart grapefruit which goes into some lemon and mineral. Some light oak as well. Very dry and very sour. One of the most sour beer I have had. Mild astringency. Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Right up there with the best beers that Russian River (or anyone else) has to offer. 587 charactersjethrodium, Mar 25, 2011

-not a ton going on in the nose. there is a bit of a lemon rind smell to it, but that was about it

-cant really say anything bad as far as the mouthfeel is concerned. it coats the mouth a bit...which is fine

Batch 002
Pours a beautiful, clear, golden-yellow with a touch of orange. A small white head forms at first, but slowly subsides to a thin collar around the edges of the glass. A few patches of lacing here and there.
Vanilla oak infused with sour funk rises up from the glass. Swirling the glass brings out some sweet citrus acidity and hay. Earthy, slightly musty and a little grassy. Great nose.
Oak and a bit of funk hit the tongue, but these notes are immediately doused in a large wave of acidic sourness. Definitely the most sour beer I've had from Russian River. Green apple brett mixed with juicy oranges and peaches. Straw and hay with a nice fruitiness. Lemon juice acidity on the finish.
Mouthfeel is awesome. Smooth and slippery with perfect carbonation. Heavy sourness throughout. Crisp at times and always mouth watering.
Drinkability is good. This beer has turned into a beast with some age on it. Nice complexity in the nose and flavor, plus lots sourness. A sourhead's dream for sure. That being said, the level of sourness does cut down on the drinkability somewhat, but at the same time makes the beer fun to drink. I'll definitely have to seek out batch 003 now that I've had this. Highly recommended. 1,265 characterssisuspeed, Mar 15, 2011

Tastes refreshingly tart and juicy with a nice lingering sweet citrus presence. Amazingly clean. Slight meatiness. Hint of mineral on the finish. Mouthfeel is light and dry but not really dry with big bubble carbonation that adds a little stickiness. Not too carbonated though. Entirely drinkable.
I am very fond of this beer. Probably the best American Wild I've had to date. 644 charactersabuliarose, Mar 15, 2011

Notes from Batch 2
A-pours a bright golden yellow liquid that glows in the light with a creamy white head.
S-the nose is huge, tons of funk, lots of barnyard with notes of cheese. there are earthy yeasts, a fair bit of sourness in the nose with light signs of acidity. big fruits come in behind, tart lemons, sour peaches, juicy golden fruits.
T-this is very well integrated with great funk notes up front. the earthy barnyard aromas carry right into the flavor, light flavors of cheese, hints of yeast. juicy golden fruits are blended in with the funk with some tart lemon, light pear and peach flavors with a strong sourness to it.
M-the fel is livey and mouth puckering, medium to full body with a syrupy texture but soft and supple on the palate. nice dry finish and still a persistent sour feel.
D-this is extremely well balanced with a great funk to it not seen in most american sours. very gueuze like with plenty of fruit sweetness to add deep complexity and balance.
Batch 3-this is also very solid, would get a slightly lower rating. it has the same complex funk to it that Batch 2 had. It has slightly more acidity but still has the same assertive sourness. It also doesn't have the bright golden fruit presence that batch 2 has, it is there but not quite as vibrant. Integrated well but slightly less complex. 1,401 characterscpetrone84, Mar 07, 2011

A - Hazy yellow straw with hardly any head and just a bit of lacing. Looks somewhat boring after the initial pour.
S - The aroma on this sumbitch is colossal, you can smell it as soon as the bottle is opened and maintains for the entire pour. Super tarty and funky lemon with hints of funky hay and barnyard.
T - Incredible mouth-exploding lemon, lime and orange citrus birst. Holy shit, my taste buds are saturated with citrus, this is amazing. Vinegar, a noticeable barnyard funk and grapes work their way into the middle while that bright and bubbly citrus maintains through the finish. This is the ultra lemon-lime-soda beer.
M - medium body which completely immerses my mouth with low carbonation, but is just crisp enough to make it interesting. 
D - The drinkability isn't that huge, because of the unrelenting citrus, vinegar and funk notes, but I just cannot stop drinking this. This beer was an experience for me and I cannot wait to try it again. 993 charactersdrewba, Mar 02, 2011

Chilled and poured into a tulip
A - Golden honey color. A little cloudy, with very visible carbonation. Tight white head that hung around and provided nice lacing.
S - Bring the funk! Horse blanket, hay, very funky, a touch of sulphur. Very inviting. Light and clean.
T - Fantastic. Sweet funk quickly leads to a puckering lemon sourness. It attacks the back sid of your tongue and washes all over your mouth. Very exciting to taste this beer, it totally shocks your whole mouth. Musty, dank funkiness. A touch of sulphur comes through in the taste as well, but works well with all the other things going on.
M - Medium body, very nice, tight carbonation. The finish is dry and crisp. Leaves you wanting to take another sip.
D - Man on man, why didn't I buy more of this? Easily one of the best wild ales I've ever had. Just fantastic. I can't wait for another batch! 919 charactersGenghis22, Feb 18, 2011

Golden yellow and mostly clear with thin white soapy head, barely half a finger initially. Some light carbonation floating up from the bottom of the glass, but not too much to maintain much of a head. Light swirling forms a small amount of foam, but it dissipates quickly leaving no lacing.
Nose is sour apples, light citrus, earthy, wet hay funkiness and a bit of fresh herbs. Tart but fruity, grassy, and just really good.
Taste doesn't disappoint at all, tart and sour apples, lemon juice, astringency from skins of plums, fresh soil, rosemary, wet animal hair. Nice complex mix of sour, sweet, and earthy funk. Lingering sour fruits on the tongue. 
Light and crisp with good small bubble carbonation that gently tickles your tongue. Refreshing and easy to drink. 819 charactersnataku00, Feb 16, 2011

lemon and oak up front. light vinegar and white grape. nice sourness through out. 
quite sour all the way through. starts off with a bit if sweetness and quickly becomes sour. mostly bitter lemon with a hint of lime. very citrus forward. a hint of funk and dry oak. very deep in flavor.
carbonation is quite mild but works out well. starts out rather flat and with a swirl quickly comes to life. lots of dry oak in the finish. 
this is hands down the best american wild ale that resembles the belgian gueuze. amazing flavor and complexity. other sour brewers, take note. 760 charactershooliganlife, Feb 12, 2011

...only to be followed by a morning of epic proportions! "King of Wilds" sweemzander breaks out the surprise beer first thing after a late breakfast to get our wild on!
A - Clear goldenrod color with heavy carbonation and a good white head. Two fingers of foam and good retention with some nice sticky lace left clinging inside the tulip.
S - Wild bugs fill the nose, Brett, Sacc., lactobacillus, all blend nicely with very mild barnyard funk. Great mildly hoppy aroma with some tart and crisp lemon citrus. A swirl brings out bigger sharp tartness like sweaty gym socks. What's wrong with us geeks for liking that in a beer?
T - Pale malt and light citrus hops get washed away instantly by tart sourness and lactobacillus sharp flavor. One-dimensional, but oh-so-good!
M - Very sharp, heavy carbonation and a tart finish with a mouth-puckering sourness. Very dry throughout the finish.
D - Such great drinkability! This one goes down so well it's hard to keep any in the glass while reviewing! Also difficult in terms of it's rarity! Thanks for the top 100 tick Sweem! 1,176 charactersBeerFMAndy, Feb 03, 2011

Thanks to glazeman for contributing this one, as well as the other two rarities in the bunch. Since I first signed up for BeerAdvocate, Beatification has been on my radar. I've been waiting for this one for a long time. 
The appearance is a thick, murky, orange with no head. It doesn't look pretty, but in all honesty it reminds me of Raspberry Eisbock - flat, thick, and old looking. The smell is about as interesting as it gets for any beer - the most complex and outright strange beer I've ever smelled - I get musty basement, barn, horse, smelly feet, aged white cheddar, energy drink (such as Monster or Red Bull), with a touch of lemon and white grapes in the finish. Wow. The taste is SOUR. The most sour beer I've ever had - the sourness hurts my epiglottis, puckers my posterior pharynx, makes my face warm, and causes me to tear up. The drinkability on this beer is almost zero, but the taste and smell of it is so unique that this beer truly does live up to the hype. This is the best beer I've had tonight thus far. As someone who loves midwestern stouts and IPAs, I've always been a big basher of west coat sours. However, Beatification is as good as it gets. Touche. 1,261 charactersairohead2001, Feb 02, 2011

A: Right off the bat I was shocked by the lack of head on this beer. There wasn't even enough bubbles to cover the liquid even after a vigorous poor. This is hazy medium orange in color.
S: The smell has very little fruit, which was also a surprise. Rather it is dominated by an acidity, yeasty flour smell that is difficult to describe. There's some lime and some strawberry deeper down.
T: I had read somewhere that this was one of the most mouth puckering sours out there, and I agree completely. This tastes like a liquefied sour patch kid and then some. The flavor is balanced out by some strawberry and some lemon. Truly amazing in my opinion. The flavor is robust, unique, and amazing.
M: Despite the lack of carbonation, the mouthfeel is spot on. The sourness more than makes up for the lack of carbonation and anything more would take away from the experience as far as CO2 goes.
D: Well, I only had about 6 ounces of this, and wish I could have had more. With that being said, the extreme sourness of this beer would probably limit my ability to have a lot of this in one sitting. With that being said, I'd be happy to have this at any opportunity, and will definitely look to get more 1,208 charactersglazeman, Feb 02, 2011

Pours a light, golden color with a nice white head and moderate carbonation. 
Strong, aggressive aroma of brett, barnyard, must and funk. Pure, unadulterated funk, as you'd want in a wild ale.

A: Cloudy blond/straw/gold color with active, fine Champagne-like effervescence. Marginal head during the pour, and it recedes to a collar that remains for the duration of the drink. No lacing to speak of. 
S: Lemon peel, must and hay. Rotting mushrooms, earthy forest funk. Probably the closest gueuze-like aroma I've smelled in an American Wild Ale. 
T: Sour, sour, sour! Mouth-puckering lemon juice and peel, followed hints of wood and earthiness. Very acidic, with a dry finish that brings some earthy and hoppy bitterness to the palate. Intensely sour, if I haven't said that already. It has some residual sweetness that initially counteracts the acidity, but even a small pour becomes a burning chore after a while. 
M: Thin-medium with fine bubbles, though the carbonation has somewhat faded out. The finish is drying, though not fully dry. Some residual sugars contribute a nice contrasting sweetness to the otherwise acetic beer, though in larger quantities the beer simply becomes harsh. 
D: I find batch 3 much more drinkable (and I should probably review it formally). Batch 2 is ok in small doses, but it strikes me as straight lemon juice. 1,205 charactersArbitrator, Jan 22, 2011

The batch 2 was my top want, so thanks to titosupertramp!
This is amazing. The batch 2 is less carbonated, but the same color. Batch 3 has a small white head.
The smells are similar. 3 is funky, but not as dry as 2. The lemony am lactic sour is more prominent in 3, but still in 2.
The tastes are both excellent... They both follow the noses-- 2 is dry and funky with a great balance and 3 is super lactic and tart with a good funkiness hiding underneath.
The body on 2 is less carbonated than 3, but they're both fantastic-- medium body with a good bite.
This is my top sour. Either batch. I would drink these constantly. This is easily one of the top sours in the world. 749 charactersAleWatcher, Jan 15, 2011

A: Hazy honey golden... it quite literally appears to be the hue of a nice, organic honey. Head recedes fairly quickly, but leaves a very persistent collar. 
S: Loads of horseblanket and hay. Additionally, there's about an equal note of citrus and pepper note. A tiny note of mustiness, though there's a strange floral-like quality that balances it out and keeps it from being unpleasant. This is a beer I could sniff at all night, which would be as close to perfect as I can think of. 
T + M: Amazingly dry... beautiful. A lemony type of tartness, without being so intense as it makes me pucker up. It's just enough to get my mouth watering and craving more. Peppery, with just the right amount of barnyard notes. I think this might just be a favourite of the Russian River brews I have tried to date. 
D: This is pretty much as good as it gets, and I'm floored by how close to perfection is seems to be to my tastes. Suddenly, Pennsylvania doesn't seem too far to travel to try to secure more. I'm fortunate it's on the East at all! 1,109 charactersProteus93, Dec 27, 2010

Pours a dark hazy golden banana yellow color with golden yellow hues when held to a light source and a two finger frothy white head. Decent retention, slowly fading into a lasting ring that leaves sporadic spots of lacing behind.
Funky Brett aroma with hints of earthy oak, crisp light fruit, champagne yeast.
Medium bodied with a slightly puckering tart mouthfeel. Soft carbonation with some earthy oak notes as well as some puckering sour funk. The great thing about this beer is although it is sour and funky with dry bretty efervescence, it isn't acetic at all and is actually very well balanced by the citrus and light fruit notes. Hints of lemon peel as well as apple and pear. Complex and extremely complex with a nice tart finish. Each sip leaves me salivating for more. Get this beer!! 922 characterscorby112, Dec 25, 2010

T: Definite intense sour, like biting into a lemon. Yum! It's a wonderful sour that lingers in my mouth and on my lips. I can pick up notes of barnyard funk once the sour subsides a bit. A nice little bit of vinegary acidity. There's just such a nice complex yet simple sour tartness to it.
M: Low, barely there carbonation, a medium mouthfeel with a nice zing

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Rating from 2009 for a batch 2 bottle.
Bottle, batch 2, big thanks to Kevin. Pours a slightly murky peachy orange with a thin soapy head. Lemon zest, brett, and peaches kick off the nose. Has that round, eggy edge that some light Lost Abbey sours have. Wow, extremely sour and puckering, maybe the most sour beer I've had. Very refined. The sourness is centered on lemons and light citrus. Candy-like at times. Great for what it is, but perhaps the intense sourness kills some fruit complexity. Russian River seems to be the king of sours in the USA.
***Since the original rate I've recently had the batch 2 and batch 3 side by side. It's a wonderful beer, especially batch 2. I don't know whether the beer has matured in the last year or I've just grown to like it more. It's clearly in another league from Lost Abbey light sours, even the big name ones, and is better than most available geuze around here. 910 charactersJAXSON, Dec 04, 2010

4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I am tasting a bottle from batch 002, so it's about 2.5 years old (treated well all this time). Pours gold in color, fairly light, with white head that barely exists. It is clear at first, but as I poured the rest of the bottle it became hazy. Aroma is wonderful. First thing that comes to mind - funk. Tartness is clearly there. Maybe a bit of barnyard notes, and there is definitely some light, fruity sweetness. The beer is tart, but not in extreme way (at least not for me), which makes it quite pleasant. I'm guessing in the past couple of years it mellowed out a bit. Tasting beer first I am hit with tartness, but sweetness is left in the aftertaste. It's very drinkable for the style, and has medium body. Not a lot in terms of carbonation. 
I'll be honest, I am a big fan of Russian River (kind of makes it hard living in New York), and this bottle does not disappoint. I am enjoying it very much. And my bottle was signed by Vinnie at a fest some time ago (irrelevant for the taste, but still fun to mention). 1,020 charactersikats, Nov 13, 2010

T:One of the most complex "sours" that I've ever tried. It's a real lemon bomb up front though. That follows up with a strong tart apple flavor. Along with some hints of barnyard funk and a slight mustiness. There are a lot of flavors going on here that my palate simply has trouble picking out.
M: Very smooth, and very dry. It could probably use a touch more carbonation for my taste.
D: I'm very grateful to have had the opportunity to try this beer. I will certainly be looking to get more when the next batch is released. But this is some pretty strong stuff, flavor wise. One glass in a sitting was more than enough for me. 988 charactersCaptinRedBeard, Nov 09, 2010

375ml Batch 2 served in a tulip glass - thanks again for sharing, CaseyK!
A - Light gold and cloudy, hardly any head or lacing
S - Massive amounts of sour yeasts/bacteria, lot of lemon peel - I can't wait to dive into this!
T - Intensely sour from sip one, this is acidic, yeasty, and pungent --&gt; barnyard funk, lemon juice, and brett --&gt; intensely sour lemon and bacterial flavor on the finish, and this lingers for minutes
M - Good cabonation, acidic, lively, amazing
D - I'd drink all of this that I could - very drinkable for how mouth-puckeringly sour it is.
All in all, I'm amazed - what a beer! I love RR's regular sour offerings, but this takes the cake - only Sanctification comes close to the levels of funkiness in this. I hope to try every batch of this, but I'll always remember #2 fondly... 828 charactersklikger, Nov 06, 2010

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5batch 2 - served in a small tulip/snifter hybrid. sent to me very generously by BA'er JRSD whom I met through my awesome Brother-in-Law. has been a huge want of mine for a long time. this one goes out to Jim, Mike, and Amy.
A - cork pulls out a bit easily with a subtle "pop". pour yeilds just a quick flash of loose white bubbles that vanish within a minute. left behind is a very thin white film and a few bubbles around the sides of the glass. the last few seconds or so brings some yeasty dregs into the glass. otherwise, the beer is clear, solid gold in color.
S - big and bright sourness, equally tart. some bits of grains, hay, yeasty funk, and basement must. nothing overpowers another, and balances wonderfully. flashes of lemon, sour green apples, and oaky vanilla sweetness creep in as it warms.
T - puckeringly sour, incredibly hidden from the nose. bright and acidic, vinegary, tart yet fruity, metallic in the right spots. this one is going to take awhile to decipher. funk flashes in and out alongside sweet vanilla and oak, and then the next sip brings in fresh grasses and fields. lemony sweetness abounds with crisp freshly picked granny smith apples. could go on and on here but i'm just going to stop and enjoy this. one of those outsanding and rare beers that can be directed to different areas of the mouth and tongue to yield different results. yummm - if I could give it a 5.5 I would.
M - medium body, with carbonation that at this point is just barely noticeable. somehow, this works wonderfully. so puckering and sour it almost makes the nose run and the glands in your mouth and throat go into overdrive out of fear. 
D - a hardcore sipper: partially to blame is its incredible sourness, deliciousness, and complexity. one of those beers that just amazes me that naturally occurring things can cause flavors like this all on their own. sours/wilds really propelled me to the next level in beer advocacy and this point is one of its peaks. im running out of creative and artistic ways to describe this. simply amazing. 2,050 charactersStigs, Oct 31, 2010

S: Wow. I can smell this beer from 3-4 feet away, and that's not exaggerating. Very strong, musty, funky aroma that seems to grow more complex with each whiff. Amazing.
T: And then you drink it. This may be one of the most complex, interesting beers I've ever had. I have little experience with this style, but the flavor is extremely tart and sour, funky, acidic, dry finish... just, wow.
M: Medium-light bodied, moderate-high carbonation.
D: A new experience with beer for me. Definitely opened up my eyes even further. Just when I think beer can't impress me any further, it continues to do so. 723 charactersberley31, Oct 27, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a tasting glass. Batch 003. I believe thanks go out to Andrew for sharing this with us! Been a longtime want on my list.
(A)- Pours a hazy pale yellow straw color that produced a white head that dissipated after awhile. (4.5)
(S)- Dry, with an earthy hay/clay background. Some really nice tart citrus fruits. Hints of a dry, clean cheesy lactic acidity. (4.5)
(T)- Rather sour with the same nice fruits. Rather earthy like the smell with hay funk and some clay. Crisp. I really like the subtle oak woodiness that mingles in the background on this. (5.0) 
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. So smooth, yet so crisp and sour. Complex to a point, but just delivers on mouthfeel in a harmonious way. (5.0) 
(D)- Just a beautiful beer. Balanced with everything in the right place. Could not ask for anything better in the style. (5.0) 
(original review: A+ / 4.8)

**Updated Review**
750mL corked and caged bottle poured into a stemmed glass. Batch 003
(A)- Pours a beautiful clear golden yellow/orange color that produced a good white fluffy head that stuck around for awhile. Plenty of lacing left behind. A sweet looking color.
(S)- A wonderfully dry funky earth with some acidic and tart lemon rind. Its actually kind of simple, but is just such a sexy smell that I could enjoy its aroma all day.
(T)- Same as the smell. A wonderfully dry earthy funk with a mouthpuckering lemon rind and white grape sourness. Again, simple, but so dynamic and sexy in my opinion that it deserves the top mark.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. A massive acidic sourness, but an assertive dry earthy fruit funk to back it up. It really reminds me of a superb Gueuze.
(D)- Just a wonderfully sexy wild ale! A great feel, smell, and taste. It really is just about perfect. The sourness is quite potent however; just enough to not get a perfect in drinkability. 
This having been my second time trying it, I really do think it deserves the updated score I am giving it. Rareness and demand aside, this is really world class in every way. Makes me want to try some of the older batches to compare with this, but I doubt that will ever happen. Russian River needs to release a new batch of this asap! 2,229 characterssweemzander, Oct 25, 2010

Poured into a wine glass. Clear golden/orange body with a thin white head that fades to a faint ring. Very musty funky aroma. Flavor is of lemon zest, sour apples, very vinous, and acidic. Very astringent finish. Bubbly on the tongue, finishes very dry.
Excellent representation of the style. This may be my absolute favorite American Wild ale. 436 charactersmuttyd, Oct 25, 2010

A: Pours a bright clear orangeish-golden with thin bubbly white head that vanished into a faint collar. No lacing. 
S: Crazy funky and tart smelling with notes of sour cherries, lemon zest and musty attic. 
T: There is an initial blast of tartness as the acid hits your tongue, but it is not harsh or vinegary. The fruits in this beer are very vinous similar to that of a sweet white wine. I get flavors of white grapes, pears, dark cherries, oak tannins, faint vanilla and tobacco. Aftertaste has incredible notes of blackberries and blueberries with a light cheesy funk. Not as dry as I would have expected but there is still a fair amount of gritty tannins in the finish. The beer coats your mouth after each swallow and leaves a sweet sticky fruit flavor that is just wonderful. 
M: Carbonation is a bit low but who cares. Body is medium and the mouthfeel is so very smooth despite the light tartness. 
D: The best barrel-aged Russian River beer I've ever had. One of the best wild ales I've ever had. One of the best beers I've ever had! Oh man was this tasty. I wish I had more. 1,152 charactersscottfrie, Oct 15, 2010

T: Very sour up front. Matches the smell very well. Pure lemon, one of the most sour beers I have had, but in a very good way.
M: Perfectly carbonated, leaves a very pleasant tingle and zing on the tongue with a nice lasting aftertaste.

Poured from a cork and caged 750ml bottle into my tasting snifter. Pours a hazy golden color, with a small frothy white head. Head dissipates pretty quick. So far...looks great!
Aroma is perfect! If you love sours as much as me, this one makes your mouth water. So much sharp tartness in the aroma. The funkiness associated with sours(Brett) is a nice characteristic...with lots of lemon zest and oak.
Flavor is just like the aroma...perfect. This turned out to be my favorite/biggest surprise beer of the night(which had beers like Black Tuesday and Duck Duck Gooze to compete with). I expected this beer to be delightful, but didn't expect it to rock my world! The sourness/tartness is incredible. Loads of the sharp tart, oak, funkiness. Finishes only slightly dry. Light and crisp mouthfeel. High carbonation. What a fantastic sour!! 942 charactersShadesOfGray, Sep 14, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally getting around to ticking this one, cracked a batch 003 last night. From notes. Paired really nicely with Rogue River Blue. 
Pours a pale yellow-gold color, with a small whitish head formation that fades to a ring leaving a touch of lacing. 
Aroma is just a great combination of funk and the characteristic grapefruit flavor that this beer is often known for. I like that the funk character is complex and satisfying without going into the cheesy direction. Don't get my wrong, there's a time and a place for some stinky cheese aroma - it's just nice to find a great complex nose that satisfies without it. I'm mostly getting some musty straw-like components, wet wood and bretty earthiness in the funk department, which is just awesome contrasting with the brighter grapefruit and meyer lemon acidic qualities. The taste is just as delicious as the aroma prefaced, boasting sharp lactic sourness, all of the great lemony and grapefruit brightening up the palate with low-medium bodied with lively, yet subtle carbonation aiding in the long dry, earthy, mineral finish. Not as tongue-numbingly sour as batch 2, but still packs a punch. One of the best American sour beers. Always a pleasure to drink. 1,211 charactersIneedabeerhere, Sep 13, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #1500
Typically review "milestones" are meaningless, but right now 1500 seems like an awful lot of beers, endless hours spent tasting and transcribing. This calls for a special one to celebrate, and I have to thank Jason for his help in acquiring this one.
A mild *thwup* from the cork, and immediately wild farmhouse aromas waft out. Cheesy, musty horseblanket, damp straw and barn stalls. In the glass it's a more concentrated citrus, expressed as grapefruit, lemon, and orange peel. A bit of chalky, dry barrel must lingers behind the fruit. As it warms, a yogurty, lactic funkiness becomes apparent. 
The frothy ring of bubbles laces nicely around the edges, with a thin wispy skim in the center. Glowing sunset orange color, with a slight natural haze. 
Puckering lemony sourness, with the added dimension of grapefruit to take the edge off. Very crisp and finishing dry. Acidic and wine-like. As the palate acclimates to the sourness, more depth and complexity emerges, similar to a traditional lambic. Ripe fruit flesh, crabapple, lemon, and grapefruit blend in harmony. You can still feel the lemon pith sourness clinging in your teeth after it's gone. Very juicy at first, becoming puckering, with dry oak traces in the finish. 
One of the closer American examples to traditional Lambic. There were some similarities here and there to Cantillon Classic Gueuze, another all time favorite of mine. 1,416 charactersemerge077, Aug 29, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Ah, beatification, supreme happiness..
On warm humid summer days in New York humidity seeps in through the cracks of the farm's silo and mixes with fermenting corn, grains, and grass. It releases a poisonous odor that can only really be traced to farms, the smell of silage. I hold this smell very dear to my heart so you can only imagine how I felt when I eagerly awaited opening my bottle of beatification.
I bought bottles of beatification during a visit to the brewery in Santa Rosa. I first tried it fresh 2 years ago when I first bought it and was rather disappointed. It was my first sour beer and was immediately turned off. No malt or hop flavors to speak of and outrageously sour. Was it a beer? 
After several months a strange craving came to me and I needed a sour brew in a bad way. I don't know how, but the very taste I had once hated had grown on me while denied of it. I tried to get the same degree of sour in other sour beers but to no avail.
After popping the cork of this bottle I had been aging, I was overwhelmed again with the warm smell of silage, there is just no other description for it, wonderful. Pressed for glasses I poured the beer into a wine glass. The hazy yellow beer seemed to glisten in the sun under its quickly dissipating one finger bright white head. I also found that in the house it took a more orange/gold color, beautiful even if it was devoid of retention.
The beer goes down very smooth with slightly low carbonation and a sour taste. It has a tart, dry champagne like finish.
How does one describe the taste of sour? I think this is one reason I have grown to love sour beers. The taste is created by incredibly special and often very old yeast (some strains have been reused for hundreds of years) that can not be quantified, but only experienced. This beer is especially unique because it lacks yeast and is fermented spontaneously. Whatever random bacteria and yeast managed to latch onto the sugars managed to do a bang up job. It's organized chaos in the highest sense.
You can try loads of different sour beers, but each one is unique in its own way without an accurate description of the taste or how the sour flavor isn't exactly the same. Sure you can pick up on earthy, citrus, and very subtle wood notes, but nothing can prepare you for the unique sour flavors that your mouth will water to inside this beer.
The only thing I can say about this beer is you have to try it. You'll either love it, or hate it. But I think it is beatifying indeed. 2,513 charactersexanimo, Aug 24, 2010

Batch 2, 375ml split with my girl. This has been calling from the cellar for a while.
Into our fantastic Cantillon tasting glasses, we both remarked how fantastic the beer looks. Little touch of cloudiness, yellow-orange with no real head or activity. But that's OK, this beer doesn't need lace to be badass.
Smell is sour and remarkable. Huge lemon, grape skin and green apple. Oakiness is buried but just makes its presence known. Lacto and Pedio funk are apparent, and this is bracingly sour. Reminds me of a nice Belgian Gueze without the dirtiness.
This beer tastes like heaven. Sharp lacto sourness makes me think of sucking on a lemon, then a touch of spices and oak. Citrus and some vanilla, slight malt. A touch of vinegar and some brett. Amazingly balanced, it's got that traditional gueze without the skunky, dirty diaper element. Instead, an intense, sour, but dry and clean beer emerges. Awesome, probably the best Russian River beer I've had.
Mouthfeel is nice, not too carbonated like some American wilds. Sticky and dry finish because of the oak and sourness. Really nice but nothing world class like the taste. This beer is super sour, not Cantillon Kriek razors down the throat sour, but really puckering. This beer rocks, plain and simple. I have a batch 3 750ml bottle to open sometime down the line and I can't wait. Highly, highly recommended for the sour connoisseur or any beer lover. This stuff is amazing and may be a permanent ISO for me. 1,483 charactersjampics2, Aug 23, 2010

Batch 003
A: Beatification appears a very hazy yellow hue. There is a small head comprised of white bubbles that leaves a little lacing on the glass.
S: The aroma is simply amazing. I was expecting great things, and was not disappointed. Sour funk, lemons, hay, and brettanomyces are the basic makeup of the scents.
T: Not surprisingly, Beatification tastes phenomenal, as the fine aroma would indicate. Really tart, this is almost like a lemon gueuze. The aroma is staggering as you get the glass near your face, then the flavor is just awesome. The taste was an instant 5. World class.
M: As sour as this beer is, there is no harshness or astringent aspects to it. A pleasant pucker and lingering aftertaste with every drink.
D: I would drink this every day if it were feasible. Wow. 891 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 15, 2010

A- Pours a hazy golden color. A thin white head. Some light subtle lacing left behind. It's kind of bubbly.
A- Big bretty funky goodness right up front and in charge. There is a oak presence and slight hint of lemon. Sour and funky. A sharp chardonnay scent creeps up on me. 
T- Perfect, hands down! The funky brett and sourness is absolutely amazing. Again, as in the nose, I pick up on lemon, chardonnay, oak, some more funk, a little more sourness and a little more funk. There is also some sour apple taste that I'm really enjoying. Did I mention I LOVE this beer. 
M- Medium in body. A crisp dry finish. Carbonation was spot on. Leaves a lingering tartness. Again, I can't think of anything to say bad about this beer.

Tasted at The Epic Sweet & Sour Tasting I w/ wunderbeer(Ron), ShadesofGray(Ryan), and big Dan. Sweet event!
Poured a golden straw in color w/ a 1/2 finger white head that left nice lacing on the glass. The nose was of tart acidicness, light earthy funk, orange peel, and lemon zest. The taste was the same as the nose. Mouthfeel was thin and clean. I could easily drink this all night long. Everytime I say that I feel like I should quote Lionel Ritchie.

A: Cloudy burnt yellow. The pour dropped a less than impressive head, buyt what was there stuck around and then left some stickiness behind.
A: White wine, grapes, green apple, and yes the funk! Barnyard and horseblanket abound in this brew. Sour lacto, and notes of grass.
T: Sour funky goodness all the way. I get the same underlying notes as in the nose, but the sourness is seems to overpower them all. I am left scratching my tounge to see if any saliva is left. Nope, if finishes very fruity and dry.
M: Tingley with the aggressive carbonation. Medium body.
D and overall impression: Drinkability is just a touch lower due to the extreme sourness of the brew. Overall, I really liked what RR did here. Out of all the sours we tasted, this one came in at #2. Skal. 882 charactersGtreid, Jul 26, 2010

Batch 001 - PH1 generously opened by javib458, thanks!
I've had this a dozen times yet I seem to have failed to review it. I will remedy that now. 
Poured into a snifter, the beer is yellow gold with good clarity and a small fizzy white head that exhibits good retention and leaves scattered lacing.
The aroma is a piquant blend of tart citrus and oak, with a moderate Brett presence that imparts some horsey, musty, and cheese notes. It's fairly well balanced, but the citrus is slightly more prominent than the rest. 
The flavor is a succulent lemon tartness with light apple notes, balanced by oak and a dry, champagne-like mouthfeel. Musty and lactic notes are apparent, and the beer finishes with a mouth puckering tartness, a moderate sourness, and lingering citrus notes.
I first had 001 - PH1 on 7/25/09 in a full Beatification vertical (001, 001 - PH1, 002, 003), and I couldn't decide if 002 or PH1 was the best batch. I had PH1 again at Woodshop 5.0 on 2/20/2010 and it was a disgusting mess, so I was worried the whole batch had gone downhill. This most recent bottle was sublime, so I really have no idea what the deal was with the bottle at Woodshop. There were no detectable off flavors here; it was a display of all around excellence. 1,266 charactersHopHead84, Jul 21, 2010

Batch 003. The beer pours a hazy gold color with a white head. The aroma is much more funky than the other Russian River sours I have rated. I get some cheesy funk, a little tartness and some oak and vanilla. The flavor is more of the cheesy funk with some tart lemons and oak character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 372 charactersMora2000, Jun 21, 2010
4.29/5  rDev -4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 2. 
Hazy pale orange color with a minimal off-white head that fizzes away. 
The aroma is acidic and fruity. Very intense. Notes of cheese and dust, with a sharp lemon character. Very nice. 
The flavor is intensely sour with crystal clear lemon notes. Not as funky as the smell. Notes of grass and dust. Obvious cellar character with lovely barrel notes. The finish is bone dry and almost harshly sour. 
Medium body, fairly lively carbonation. 
This might be the most genuine American sour ale I've come across. Very lambic-like in terms of sourness and overall character. 582 charactersricke, Jun 19, 2010

A: Pours a slight .5 finger coarse white head that dissipates quickly into a thin wisp. Beer is semi-cloudy lemon with a tint of orange. Lacing is very spotty and with little cling. 
S: Lemon rinds, citrus, oak, peat, all painted on a background of subtle booziness. Very clean and crisp here with great separation. 
T: Lemon tartness is pervasive throughout. Citrus and peat with a rind bitterness in the back. Yeasty at points and very sharp. Vinegary as it warms. Finish dries out at the start but actually becomes more watery and messy going into the aftertaste. Sweetness left on the palate along with a yeasty sharp cheesiness. 
M: Light bodied and highly carbonated. Very lively in the mouth though slightly rough around the edges. Grainy at points because of the carbonation. Finish is slightly dry and aftertaste is moderately messy. 
D: A very solid beer and in my opinion, the best of the "-tion" series next to supplication. Clean and crisp with a taste that isn't overly complex but still very well executed. Thanks again to Jeff for the opportunity and I can't wait to try this again with perhaps even a little more time on it. 1,254 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 31, 2010

Appearance- Pours a hazy straw golden out of the bottle. Between the two bottles, I had a pour towards the bottom of the bottle and one more towards the top. The haziness of the beer naturally increased towards the bottom, but I digress, the review will be off the current pour, which is towards the bottom. I get a small, maybe quarter finger, of fizzy white head that almost immediately dies back to a ring around the edges. 
Smell- Wow, smells very tart and very citrusy. Extreme amounts of lemon zest is really all I can think to say with regards to the citrus, maybe just a touch of tart green apples as well. In addition to the citrus, there is a also quite a solid deal of well integrated barnyard funk. Smells delicious.
Taste- Huge amounts of lemon zest all over your palate right off the bat. I don't know if I've ever had an unfruited wild that has struck me as tasting quite so much of lemon. That being said, it is a really fresh and delicious taste with quite a good deal of lactic tartness to it. Rounded out again with a solid amount of funk that strikes me somewhat of an acrid leather taste in this instance. I really like this.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is adequately but not over carbonated and also plenty substantial for the style. Drinkability was fantastic for me as well given the fruity fresh nature of the beer. I knew I would be feeling the beer in my stomach later with all the wild bugs, but it sure did go down easy.
Overall, yet another fantastic sour from Russian River. As I said, probably my current favorite from their lineup. 1,890 charactersboatshoes, May 25, 2010

After a good night of Euchre and some beers, Kate and I stayed late to work on the Beatification. I give Kate some props for hanging late when she was faced with the FE (Fundamentals of Engineering) exam in a few hours. This should get her primed! 
Poured into my Portsmouth snifter, the Beatification looks a hazy tawny yellow. Very cloudy with swirls of suspension sticking around. A small white head leaves quickly and places no head on the glass. A decent looking beer, but nothing exceptional.
Smells zesty. Some grassy, wet, slightly funky smell stands out. Maybe a bit of lemon with only a slight amount of funk. It's there, but the barnyard is in the background.
Tart. Very tart. One of the most tart wilds I've ever had. I remember trying the Temptation for the first time and thinking it was very tart. Well, tonight I had them back to back and the Beatification holds Temptation's head under the water. This is tart, gland hitting stuff. I really enjoy the taste / mouthfeel. It is light bodied and not highly carbonated, but I love the way it feels. Great stuff. I get the tart before I even let the beer drop down over my tongue...it's obvious. There is a bit more of the funky barnyardness in the taste as compared to the aroma, but definitely not overwhelming. 
This is one of those weird beers. It's not going to rank as one of my tops on BA, but it is definitely one that I would prefer to drink above many that "rank" higher. I love the taste - again, it won't rank as high as something like Supplication, but it is something I would pick first. One of the best beers RR makes.

4.56/5  rDev +2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Whew, glad I found these notes...
Poured to a slender Argyle wine taster in the earliest hours of April 6th. I brought this (a 375ml caged/corked bottle, Batch 002) with me to Louisiana, where I had hoped to share a few sips with my mom. A little too late, though, as she slipped away into a semi-coma earlier in the evening... a grateful 'cheers' for the time we shared that weekend.
A: Uncorked with a soft pop and poured like liquid bread, a hazy golden-orange, 'apricot' colored. A brief fizz and roil, followed by a thin swirling veil and pencil-thin white ring. Behind that dense cloudiness, there seem to be a several decent streams of carbonation.
S: Brazen 'sweet-tart' greeting; it tingles in the nose with citrus pith, rotting hay ('barn' aroma) and a fleeting clover/mint sweetness. Finishing 'oak barrel' woodsy tannins, white grape.
T: Biting tartness and, later, a chalky dryness. Unripened berries and crisp green apples, both sour and introduce some sweetness. A pithy lemonade, an earthy tang that hints at stronger goat cheeses (???, but the bacterial/mineral base makes sense...). Complex (no surprise) and intense, pretty outstanding.
M: An upfront lip-pucker and tongue-curl. Cellaring seems to have reduced crispness/carbonation; the resulting milder feel is surprisingly smoothed, the body medium/light. Some medicinal dryness in a lasting finish.
D: A 'wow' American Wild, vibrant and refined over time...I'd love to have this again (and have since picked up later versions of Beatification for similar aging), but it's a style that is best in small quantities and/or shared with someone special.
Thanks to jgaston for sending this bottle back in mid-2008...glad I cellared it for a couple years. 1,728 charactersmsubulldog25, May 01, 2010

A - Poured a nicely hazy lemon yellow/tangerine with a frothy white head. Not much retention, as expected with most wild ales. Sparkles in the sun. Wow. 4.5
S - This is simply fantastic. So much going on here, yet I feel I'll be doing this beer injustice by attempting to describe it. But here goes. A crisp tart aroma similar to extremely tart lemons, a touch of that "barnyard" funkiness like a bit of earthy mushrooms, a very small bit of grass and a bit of oak. This is simply excellent. 5.0
T - Extraordinary tartness explodes with citrusy and a faint kiwi-like flavor. Followed closely with that distinct "barnyard" earthiness and a long, sour finish. I wish my vocabulary for wild and sour beers was better. 5.0
M - Light, crisp, well carbonated. So incredibly smooth. There is no "bite", nor is it lacking carbonation in any way. So well balanced. 5.0
D - What do you think?! This is phenomenal. Truly an enlightening experience in my beer ventures. 5.0 1,064 charactersDmanGTR, Apr 27, 2010

Oaky funk aroma with notes of butterscotch, grass, herbs, bread and yeast. Immensly sour flavor upfront with some white grape hints, butterscotch, slight oak on the finish, lemon, grass, sipcy hops, apple and yeast. Medium body.

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a very light golden with a tinge of amber and burnt orange. The head is off white, but doesn't stick around long enough to admire. The smell is great. Lots of citrusy fruits, mostly lemon. Some oakiness and even a little alcohol to complement the funky brett. 
Wow! RR sours continue to absolutely blow me away. This may be the sourest one I've tried. This thing is like drinking straight grapefruit juice aged in oak barrels with lemon added along with dissolved sweet tarts and that ever so special brett element that gives a barnyard/earthy character.
The mouthfeel is also great. Very light, but always (with RR) well carbonated. Drinkability too, is as always, through the roof. 691 charactersjdklks, Mar 29, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Shared at a sour tasting/brewing at a friend's house. We brewed a wild sour and between everyone we had about 23 bottles of various sours including Cuvee De Tomme, Isabel, Cuvee De Rank, Brute, and many more big sours. We then took the last bit of each bottle (about an 1")and added it to the sour we brewed. Will not be ready for bottling until next fall/winter but cannot wait to see what comes of it. 
 Had this in a snifter. A golden straw like color with a nice amount of carbonation that kept a very small ring around the top. A creamy vanilla and banana (major banana)aroma with the obvious brett character as well. Loved this aroma! Major tartness in taste. After a few sips I could taste the oak and wine in it with some lemon/lime hints. An excellent big sour taste. This is a real sour, unlike wanna be sours such as Moaten. A "light" body with much weaker carbonation then expected, but very well balanced especially considering all that is in it. I expected some vinegar but seemed like none considering how big of a sour it is. Anyone who wants to see what a sour beer is, you must try this one! I love this beer as one of my top three sours ever!! A must try. 1,174 charactersTonyBrew, Mar 28, 2010

Beatification by RR is a wild ale that is 100% spontaneously fermented beer using the oldest barrels that no longer have any wine flavor or oak flavor left in them. 5.5% abv. It poured a cloudy sun yellow. It smelled of sour, oak and Brett. It tasted sour! Lemon, lemon, lemon sour, Brett and super dry. It is one tart beer! Reminiscent of Isabelle Proximus, a one note incredibly sour beer. 440 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

Batch 002
Pours a cloudy golden color. Hefeweizen-ish. No head, no lacing.
Aroma smells Vinous. Very wine like. Lots of funk and tart aromas.
Taste is awesome. This one is super tart. Very lemony tart with lots of Brett Funk.
Mouthfeel is very dry on the Palate with a nice high carb.
Overall an amazing beer that everyone should seek out. It's gotten pretty tart over the course of a year or so so if you want to age some, be known that this is what it does. 484 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Mar 25, 2010

A: I poured the entire 375 bottle carefully into an oversized wine glass, making sure to leave all the yeast and sediment behind. Beatification had an amazing orange, golden apricot color. High clarity, leaving a minimal ring of white foam on the surface of the beer. Bright and beautiful appearance.
S:Lots of good ol funk in the nose: goaty, cheesy, tart, lemon. So much complexity. Just an amazing smell for a wild ale.
T:Starts of tart, acidic, lots of clean lemon, sour citrus, with the faintests hints of oak, especially as the beer warmed up to room temp. I couldn't imagine this beer getting any better.
M: Smooth, clean, soft carbonation and a dry finish. I would have liked a touch more carbonation, but at this point I am just looking for something to complain about.
D:This batch is ridiculously good. So clean and tart. I have had both batch 2 and 3 a few times, and I have to say batch 2 maybe a little more tart than batch 3. Although any version of this beer is simply outstanding. 1,010 characterssteadydose, Mar 15, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Split amongst friends at a recent gathering. 750mL Batch 003 bottle.
Poured into a snifter.
Appearance: First pour was crystal clear, but each successive one came out more and more hazy. I was trying to be careful, but oh well. Body was straw gold in color and displayed pretty active carbonation. A hair-thin ring of white bubbles sat on top for the entire session and didn't drag any lacing.
Smell: Huge banana! Wow! Banana, vanilla, cream, and lemon all come forth in harmony. As the beer warms fresh dough, peanut shells, and finally bret come out. What a fantastic combination of aromas! Easy 5.0!
Taste: Strong mouth-puckering tartness on the first sip. Once acclimated, I get lemon, sparkling wine, oak, lime, hay, and other farmhouse flavors. Honey? Maybe. Not vinegary at all. I love the big sourness!
Mouthfeel: Light-bodied with high yet soft carbonation. Very sour - leaves the mouth feeling pretty worn out. Mouth-puckering at times. All in all though, pretty easy-going for a sour. No vinegary sting.
Drinkability: By far the best light-colored sour I've had. Complex, intense, and tangy. The high sourness hurts the drinkability a bit. But damn... I still can't get over that smell! Highly, highly recommended! 1,231 charactersThreeWiseMen, Mar 07, 2010

A: Really a unique and beautiful beer. Almost like a neon yellow with a slightly off-white head that quick dissolves in a skin.
S: Wow, this is going to be a sour beverage. I must say that I am just now diving in the world of sours and I can certainly appreciate the style, but I am developing a taste and smell for it as I go along. A good degree of funk of citrus, having a heard time with this one.
T: The smell was funky, but the taste is out of this world. Perhaps the most unique tasting beer I have ever tried. Seems very well-crafted, but it is so sour and funky. Lots of citrus going on as well as great tartness and no sense at all of vinegar which is good thing, for me at least. I feel fortunate to have be able to try this and certainly appreciate it, but I don't feel that my palate is developed enough to pull out all of its complexities. 
M: Mouthfeel is quite nice and somewhat lively while being medium-bodied.
D: The extremely sourness is the only limiting factor.
Overall this beer was a true experience and a great leap for me into sours. Well-crafted from a unique brewery and certainly one I would like to revisit in the future. 1,274 charactersLunch, Feb 23, 2010

Poured from a bottle at monk's kettle
It poured a nice lite yellow, an off gold heather straw color. With a mighty funk odor presiding from the glass. This beer was super tart and super dry, with a strong citric taste. There was also a very bretty taste. The taste was very malleable, varying from sip to sip, jumping from the barnyard brett to a bone dry lemon making it a pleasure to drink. That combined with the low ABV, lack of sweetness and the pleasant fuzziness, I could have drunken this all day. Yet this review still comes out a bit drunk. Go figure! 571 characterssomabeer, Feb 23, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch PH3 (I think). This is the fourth sour from RR I've had (Temptation, Supplication, Consecration) and this was by far my favorite.
Beer is yellow and clear. Carbonation is moderate to low and forms a two fingered head of medium and small white bubbles. Head falls away leaving a lot of lacing behind.
Beer is a sour bomb. Totally citric and acetic but does not devolve into vinegar as some of these lighter bodied ones do. Its medium to low in body, the carbonation is important in the mouth. Drinkability is the really high and its the best tasting sour I've had. Tartness really hits me in the corners of my mouth but overall a great and solid sour. I'm shocked its not rated higher. I'll be seeking this out again. 724 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 22, 2010

Tried it at Monk's Kettle in SF, but had originally ordered Pliny (on tap, and they were out of it) and was up sold into it. not sure retail price, but after it was poured found out it was $35 for a 375, which sort of set the bar high. I believe this is only the second wild ale i have ever tried.
A Gold and cider like, almost neon like redbull but lighting was poor. No head.
S intense flanders style, hiddely ho neighbor! Too much going on to even pinpoint. Sweet and sour sauce, floral, tropical fruit, dankness, etc.
T Green apple warhead (toward the end right before it sweetens up) sour, tart, long lasting and intense. Wife stated and i quote, "it tastes like sour punch straws with piss on them." awesome.
D a great second beer, needs a show stater. Too much and too intense to start with. I have little experience with this style of beer, but it was an enjoyable and wild time. I dont think i would buy this in 750 format, i think a little goes a long way. 993 characterscleverbeername, Feb 16, 2010

Some head present, but on the less lustrous side of things. Aromas is citric, lemony, acidic, floral, and vinous. The spontaneous in-barrel fermentation lends a more powerful sour and funk than Russian River's other brews. The taste is tongue pleasingly sour, with citrus, lemon, pedio funk, and slightly earthy on the finish. Moderately bodied with a matching amount of carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, my favorite sour from Russian River. 517 charactersvacax, Feb 14, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Damn it. At this point in my drinking career I almost want to hate something Russian River comes out with. Everything I have had from them is stellar. I might go as far as to say that Vinnie Cilurzo is an artist. 
This bottle was batch 003. 
The bottle opened with an aggressive 'pop' and foamed up a bit. It pours a very cloudy blonde, and the head is white as snow. The head is a very fine carbonation, with small uniform bubbles. The head does not show itself for very long, but leaves itself to a white ring around the glass. Slight alcoholic legs with no lacing. It is a cloudy beer, and it also had some yeast floaters. 
The smell is mellow barnyard, must, lemon peel, lots of oak, and those dang bugs that make everything sour. 
The taste, for me, is exactly how I like my American Wilds. This is very tart, and has loads of citrus-y lemon characters to it. The lemon is so pronounced in this that I would describe it as one of the main characters. Some oak in the finish with my tongue doing backflips over the tartness. Mouth watering. There is a wine flavor in this too that is a background flavor that is noticeable on the second few sips. 
My tongue flees in horror! I love the tart, mouth watering, sour flavor that this one has. Sweet notes in the beginning. A good carbonation that just sews the sourness into the palate. Dry on the end of the palate, but mouthwatering none the less. So overwhelmingly sour that the first few sips had some time in between them to let my palate breath. 
The drinkability is very good on this one. It is a palate destroyer, so there is no use in having this be the first beer at a tasting. It is so sour that it actually hurts the drinkability. I kept reaching for it anticipating the palate killer. 
This is a delicious brew that I have been wanting to try for a while. I cannot say enough good things about Russian River, a brewery which has shot into a far lead for my favorite brewery. 
Cheers

A: A disappointingly quiet popping of the cork on this bottle. Despite that, the beer seems to still be fairly well carbonated. The pour itself is a hazy light golden color with a thin white head.
S: The nose is still very, very acidic. The lemony, lactic tartness is really the star of the show with some white grapes and green apple notes as well. There's really not much in the way of funk, but that's not really a problem for me.
T: The flavor picks up where the nose leaves off with a really intense lemon sourness. There are some flavors of green apple and white grape as the nose would indicate, but this bottle is not quite as puckering as others I've had.
M: The level of carbonation is just about perfect, with great effervescence really allowing the acid to really come through. The finish is very sour and dry, as you would expect.
D: I've always been a huge fan of the intense sourness that Beatification has, and this is no exception. I always enjoy the opportunity to open up a bottle. 1,132 characterswomencantsail, Feb 01, 2010

A: A crystal clear golden colored brew with nice head retention, reforming itself relatively quick after a vigorous swirl, and mild lacing. 
S: Tart, earthy, and perhaps banana are the main aromas I pick up. Some oak qualities come out a bit more as the beer warms up, but doesn't seem to be the main focus of the smell. 
T: A lot of citrus and sour tones, along with an extremely robust oak quality. Many times, I thought it came off too harsh and deterred me from taking additional sips. 
M: Good amount carbonation, medium to light body, and slightly dry. 
D: The alcohol is hidden extremely well, but the strong and harsh woody finish was hard to tolerate. 
Overall: Had anticipated more out of this beer, but a decent beer for the style. Not sure I'll be seeking this one out again, but worth a try. Cheers! 906 charactersOlieIPA, Jan 17, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4375ml bottle. Batch 002. Purchased at the brewery when it was first released and kept at cellar temperature. Poured into a tulip glass. Comes in at 6%.
A-Pours a semi clear straw yellow. It has a fairly thin off white head that quickly turns into a thin ring around the top of the glass. There is a small amount of bubbles that rise from the bottom.
S-It has a very sour/tart aroma and is not overly heavy on the funk. It starts out with plenty of mouthwatering tart lemon and a touch of barnyard funk. White grapes also are noticeable. It has a musty wine barrel smell that reminds me of the air in a wine cave.
T-It starts out with a really nice tart fruit flavor comprised of lemon and white grapes. It is quite tart throughout. When it hits the back of my mouth it reminds me in a lot of ways of how condensed lemon juice from a squeeze bottle tastes like. Every few sips I get a flavor that reminds me on an undercooked popcorn kernel. It also has a taste reminiscent of a nice sharp and pungent reserve bleu cheese. There is also wood flavor from the barrels.
M-Medium bodied. It is tart and dry. The carbonation is on the low end of the medium spectrum.
D-It is definitely a tart beer. A 375 ml bottle is plenty. I would like a touch more carbonation.
One of my favorite sours from Russian River and probably one of their least accessible for those new to the style. A little goes a long way. Always worth seeking out. 1,431 charactersmjl21, Jan 13, 2010

4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is not screwing around. Poured from the bottle into my Bruery tulip.
Clear, bright, golden blonde pour. Seems light in body. The snow-white head fizzes up but terminates almost immediately. A vigorous swirl brings the bubbles back, but only for a few instants. It's only average-looking as far as American Wilds go, but I have a feeling things are going to get better.
And they do. This slaps you in the face with buggy funk. Lemons, a hint of grapefruit citrus, oak, white wine (chardonnay? I dunno, I'm not a oenophile). Very nice. 
Taste follows the nose pretty readily, although the citrus component seems to get drowned out in the intense sourness and lemon flavors. Damn, this is really sour. I love it.
Mouthfeel is good. Medium-bodied, ample carbonation is a little harsh (but only a little). Sharp, dry (dryyy) finish.
Drinkability is excellent for the style. I cannot give it a perfect score simply because the sourness is so intense that drinking a lot of it would probably grow taxing, but my 375ml bottle went down without a fight. 
Russian River has my undying respect. I cannot get over how unfreakingbelievable their sours are. Also have a signature to them, which I enjoy - I feel like a new RR sour could come out tomorrow and you could blindfold me, stick it under my nose, and I would recognize it immediately. 1,346 charactersdavod23, Jan 07, 2010

A: Yellow/gold and slightly cloudy. There is some carbonation that rises to the top of the glass and provides just enough of a ring around the top.
S: Lots of tart fruit in this one with notes of sour lemon and lime. Also some tart green apple and a bit of grapes. Some mustiness is also present, but i always found myself attached to the lemon citrus
T: The lemon tart still was most prevalent in terms of flavor for me. It was a bit like the tart lemon for italian ice. Also some nice wood notes, but really it was just sour, but tasty sour candy type of sour.
M: Very dry and slightly acidic, yet it is not rough to drink at all. There is no booziness and the carbonation is just enough 
D: A very easy drinking sour that is very enjoyable and mellow in terms of flavor 806 charactersmikey711, Jan 05, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to nickd717 for shipping me out some of this. 750 ml bottle batch 003.
Pours a murky straw yellow orangish color. Tons of tiny carbonation bubbles float to the top. The head is white and doesn't have the best retention in the world.
The nose very vinous, with extreme hints of tart and sour apple, white grape juice, wet leather, some musty earthiness. Extremely complex and it evolves as it warms, become more complex and giving off new smells every sip.
This is intense. I've had Russian River before but never been blown away like this. If I could give taste a 6, I'd still want to give it a 7. Sour and tart fruits, mainly apples and grapes, very vinous and acidic. Surprisingly has a sweet side along with the sour, a very nice balance. Musty and funky, but just the right amount. Not overpowering but adds enough to take this to a whole new plain of existence. Seriously the best tasting sour I've ever had.
Mouthfeel is light to medium with a soft floating carbonation, almost fluffy. Finishes a bit dry, but nothing too intense.
Drinkability is amazing. I can't imagine a 750 ml going faster than this one would if I didn't pace myself. This is liquid gold in a bottle. I was thinking about trading my second bottle but I'm now having serious doubts and second thoughts. 1,290 charactersMistofminn, Dec 25, 2009

Aroma has some apple and grape fruit flavors with a slight citrusness and sourness. Taste is very good. The sourness hits you first with the fruity apple and grape flavors coming through. The sourness reminds me a lot of sour candies maybe, sweet tarts. It finishes with the funky barnyard flavors that I have read about but not experienced for so long.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with above average carbonation. Drinkability is good, this is a very strong flavor but also very enjoyable.
Overall I am very impressed, I would consider this one of my first real sour beers and definitely my first American sour. I can definitely see why these RR sours are so sought after now. Excellent beer that I would definitely buy again. 882 charactersbillab914, Dec 21, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750 ML received in a trade with ipa247
Pours a somewhat murky glowing orange/straw color. Lots of effervescent carbonation rising to the top and feeding a finger of head that recedes down to a thin film and nice collar.
Nose is a complex mesh of band aid, tart apples, white grapes, Now & Laters, some earthy must, cobwebs, and orange peel. Very very nice.
OH WOW! This is it! I have tried numerous times to get into sours and had mixed results. But this is it! This is the beer I have been looking for. A mouth puckering blast of sour candy and thankfully not bone dry on the palate. Tart apples and grape skin on the mid-palate. Nice sweet finish of orange peel and a slight bit of must and funk. This is seriously like drinking a liquid Warhead candy. Awesome.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with quite a bit of carbonation but mostly of the soft variety. A tad dry, but not nearly enough to bother me.
This beer is amazing. And I think it is my gateway. Thanks again Jeff...you picked a fantastic beer to send me! 1,026 charactersalcstradamus, Dec 14, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750ml RR bottle into my official Russian River 'tion glass.
The pour is a kind of hazy yellow with just a tiny ring of bubbles around the liquid's edge, just enough to remind me that this guy has just enough carbonation. As I drink it down, there is little lacing left behind on the sides of the glass.
The smell is so familiar and heartening. Its that delicious barnyard funk that smells like the underside of a well aged wine bottle cork. There's a touch of lemon peel on the top of the smell hinting at the time this beer spent in a barrel.
This beer's mouthfeel is closest to Temptation, thinner than most of the other 'tion offerings but still thick enough to be there. Its dryness isn't overwhelming but it ends the quaff quickly and doesn't hang around. The carb bite is on point, sharp and present making for a pleasant beverage.
The lemon character of this guy is the most surprising element of the beer. Like concentrated lemon juice, it pervades the drink making a mouth puckering beverage. The barrel funk on the drink is also present, but make no mistake, there is none of the balsamic vinegar aftertaste to the brew, only sweet citrus goodness.
The mild mouthfeel and general feeling of elation makes this a highly drinkable beer. The aftertaste might be off putting for some, but in my opinion it's fantastic, making for my favorite Russian River sour offering thus far 1,403 characterscptierney, Dec 12, 2009

A - bright hazy orange. A light white thin head grabs the edge of the glass. Dissipates quickly, as I wish the head would retain.
S - Starts funky with the smell of bready brett, and some sour fruit notes hit the nasal area. Smell of citrus pleases me as a beer drinker as the aroma fades....
T - Where to start? The very first taste is a sour bite. It grabs your cheeks and forces them inward. The puckering sourness of this beer is so good. Right after that, the funk kicks in and dies down the pucking sour. Tastes of spices from the funk come in. After the funk, the taste of sour lemon is left behind. It is like eating the peel. A very overpowing combination of citrus and sour.
M - Dry. Hits your mouth and leaves. This is how a sour should behave. It is not sweet and clinging. It hits the mouth, and leaves behind the puckering effects of the sour. Damn good.
D - This beer is drinkable for how sour it is. It is not an unpleasing sour, and allows for the drinker to desire more. I would not have more than 1 glass of this though, but I still love the one I am having! 1,196 charactersabecall98, Dec 10, 2009
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 475cl bottle shared by photomike. Just another animal entirely from the rest of the Russian River family. The sourest beer that I have ever had, but somehow remained smooth and drinkable. I'm not even sure that I understand. Ever since hearing Vinnie describe how they were brewing this beer while we were at the brewery for RBSG this past summer, I've been dying to try it. This truly is a Sonambic. The funk, the acidity, the wood. So intense from start to finish. The pour is a relatively unassuming hazy yellow with a small fine head that leaves patchy lace behind. The aroma is where things get interesting. It's just the funkiest, sourest, most oaky thing to ever hit my nostrils. Straight oaked lemon juice with brett. The flavor is super dry, super sour, with yoghurt and lemons coming through, and quite oaky, though relatively clean tasting as well, without the the sharper cheesy funk flavors found in some Belgian lambics. Light bodied with acid coasting the tongue. I had burned my tongue the day before on some tea, and Beatification started to bring back the hurt with all that acid. Pain for pleasure. Honestly, this borders on too acidic, and I have a very high threshold for sour. Though it is very well blended and smooth overall for how acidic it is. This might not have been the most pleasurable beer of the tasting, but it was the most heavy of an impact. Lacks the depth of Supplication, but the awesome sourness is unrivaled. Killer shit. 1,461 charactersbulletrain76, Dec 07, 2009

This beer pours a dark yellow that has a hint of orange in it, much much darker than tempation. The head and carbonation are both disappointing as I get NO HEAD AT ALL. There is no lacing either.
The aroma is all sour and funk but sadly there isn't much complexity or other aromas. You are just overwhelmed by sour.
The taste makes up for what is lacking in appearance and aroma. It is sweet to start then very tart, definetly a puckerer, the rest of the way but not so overwhelming you can't drink it.
The feel is tart and heavy and just coasts your tongue but crisp to drink and great drinkability for a sour beer.
Overall this wild ale is a good beer, partly just because I love sours. however, compared to other sours it is severly lacking in complexity and originality. Would I drink this beer again? Certainly. Would I go out of my to find it, trade something special to get it, or pay a lot at an auction site no. 990 charactersjrallen34, Dec 05, 2009

A - Lightly hazed bright yellow in color. Head is rather thin and bright white. Quickly fades to nothing and leaves very little behind on the glass.
S - Hints of oak, sour lemons and a bit grassy. The Brett comes through as it warms with just a hint of barnyard funk.
T - Sour citrus fruit up front with lots of lemon zest. Hints of oak mid-drink, especially as the beer warms. Hints of grape and apple as well. Just a hint of biscuity maltiness underneath. Finishes very tart.
M/D - Crisp, light feel. Very easy drinking. Mine was rather well carboanted which seems to be abnormal after reading other reviews. 654 charactersckeegan04, Nov 25, 2009

Received in trade from largadeer, thanks for the opportunity. 
I can smell the funk as soon as I pop the cork. Pours a crystal clear deep golden color with a good sized white head that sticks around for a while. Smells of barnyard funk, lemon, tart fruits, and leather. Smells very tart, I think I'm in for a treat. The taste is mouth puckering sour and dry with lots of tart fruits especially lemon and sour orange. Hints of horse blanket and tobacco round it out. Leaves a bone dry finish in which you can feel the lactic acid burn down your throat until it splashes into your stomach. Every sip leaves your mouth watering for more. Medium low carbonation, Medium light body. Wow that's a great sour beer! Lots of acid, some funk, very little vinegar. Vinnie you've done it again. 807 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 24, 2009

I've been saving it for the right time, &, well, that time is now. It's warm in Minnesota in late November, that's reason enough to celebrate!
Batch 3. Only 2/3 of the bottle poured between my wife & I initially to keep the sediment trapped in the big, cool bottle. Pours an almost radioactive yellow with evident carbonation but no head to speak of. Smell is sheer wild. Dry, cirtus, with a tangy undercurrent of champagne, which must be the yeast. Interesting. 
Beatification is mouth-puckeringly dry. Even before the taste kicks in, this is the primary impression I come away with from the first sip. After I unpucker, I get the sour lemon, the brett, the wood drying out my mouth even more. I'm going to need to drink some liquid after I finish this. Drinkable? Even for a wild, this is down on the scale for me. 
Good beer. Unfairly, I was expecting some kind of heavenly notes to sound when I opened the bottle, but this wasn't as good as some other sours I've had. Good, but simple. 1,083 charactersmaximum12, Nov 20, 2009

batch 002 (375ml corked and caged) side-by-side with batch 003 (750ml corked and caged). sampled nov 15/09.
appearance on both is about the same as my previous review. batch 2 seems to have a bit more clarity, but that's likely just because it has sat longer.
aroma on #2 matches my last review and is quite similar to #3 except that it has a more pronounced acidity and vinegary component.
taste seems to match what i observed in the aroma - both match my last review except for a more pronounced acidity/vinegary character in #2.
mouthfeel matches in both.
drinkability is pretty good, but the acidity, particularly in batch 002, takes away from it somewhat. it also seems to have lost some its depth with time. overall i think i liked #2 better fresh and #3 is pretty damn good now. i'll leave the scores as-is, but consider them to reflect each batch when fresh.
previous review: 4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5 = 4.3
thanks to fartingdog and DrJay for helping this one to come my way.
375ml bottle, corked and caged. batch 002. sampled aug 24/08, 7 days before i'll be visiting the brewpub. woohoo!
pours pale yellow with a small ring of dense white head. drops almost instantly and leaves a few spots of lace.
aroma is good. lemon and a bit of sour orange. leather and horse blanket. alcohol. bit of cider vinegar and acidity. white bread. cracker. bit of grain. touch of caramel. apple. white wine. bit of raw oak.
taste is great. lots of fruit up front. apple. lemon. bit of light citrus. then the funk hits - sour lemon, apple cider vinegar, leather and horse blanket. light caramel. bit of alcohol. bread and cracker. bit of grain. there's a nice floral component to it too that i kind of enjoy. white wine. oak. bit of vanilla.
mouthfeel is good. medium-low carbonation level. medium-light body with a fairly clean dry finish.
drinkability is great. balanced acidity, great depth. interesting and very enjoyable. it'll be neat to see how this one changes with some age. 2,057 charactersgrub, Nov 16, 2009

A - Pale yellow / straw colored, with a hint of orange. Very minimal head that dissipated almost immediatley.
S - Holy horse blanket. That descriptor didn't mean anything to me until I smelled this beer. This is the definition of "barnyard". Hints of lemony citrus as well.
T - SOUR SOUR SOUR. I'm a huge fan of geuze, lambic, flanders red, etc, but this one is puckeringly sour. Pushing the limits here for me, especially at first. Once the palate adjusts, it's not too bad, but up front it's pretty intense. Lots of sweaty lemon with some wood notes.
M - Not a huge amount of carbonation, but not flat. The acidity here overpowers my first impressions, but evens out a bit on the third sip and beyond.
D - Tough to drink at first, but after your palate adjusts it's actually pretty good. Still was tough to finish the bottle between two of us.
Overall, it's an interesting beer, but not terribly balanced, and missing the complexity imparted by the barrels of various other Russian River "sours". Worth trying if you have the chance, but it's not something I would go out of my way to try again. 1,163 charactersTiklmelmo, Nov 11, 2009

The aroma is very funky, lots of sweaty horse blanket quality with subtle tartness. Light sweet fruitiness. It's truly a farmhouse smelling beer with some light citrus spike and floral orange. Very nice.
Taste is pretty tart overall, with seemingly strong acetobacter characteristics and possibly vinegary notes way down. The beer has a very tart bite. Alcohol finishes out and gives a soft flavor to the end.
Mouthfeel is quite flat, not too carbonated. Pretty dry without much sweetness. Light bodied.
Drinkability is pretty good but a little over the top with tartness so not something you could sip on for too long. Nice flavors and interesting qualities. 851 charactersNoLiberty, Oct 10, 2009

4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a dogfish head signature glass.
The beer pours a hazy orange/straw color with a thick soapy white head. As the head fades it leaves behind small traces of oily lacing on the sides of the glass.
The smell is earthy and citrusy and slightly hoppy, but mostly sour. The citrus is a light orange peel/lemony citrus that moves into a fresh cut grass then to an earthy funky smell.
The taste follows the nose lock-step. Lost of sour-sour citrus notes fade to a fresh cut grassy hop then move to a very sour earthy/funky dry finish. There is some flavors of wood and hay throughout the taste that attempt to counteract the citrusy-lemon juice sourness. The carbonation, citrus and sour notes lend to an almost champagne-like quality.
The carbonation and dry finish combined with the excellent carbonation make this beer very drinkable. The alcohol is barely present and the sour notes are very well highlighted. 934 charactersrpstevens, Sep 29, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - A hazy light gold beer. I'm surprised by the lack of head, as very little white fluff formed upon pouring, and what did form quickly disappeared. 
S - Strong earth funkiness that complements some mild wood scent. Underneath is some apple and pear and lemon scent that really work with, but do not overpower, the earth funk, which is clearly the highlight. 
T - Up front is the leather/dirt provided by the brett. The sheer strength of funk here makes me pucker a bit. As the first wave of flavor passes through, it opens up to strong notes of citrus and lemon. The sourness of the lemon carries through until the finish, where sour apples come in and transition from citrus sourness to sweet sourness. 
M - Light bodied and very light carbonation on this one, which gives the beer a certain smoothness lacking from other examples in the style. It can get away with the light carbonation because the strength of the flavors prevent any risk of wateriness. Sour and dry on the finish.
D - Possibly the most drinkable beer I've ever had. The light body, coupled with the 5.5 % ABV and alluring flavor make this an easy one to enjoy in large quantities...if only I had enough to session with. 1,196 charactersschinebd, Sep 28, 2009

Mouthfeel: Dry, tart, and medium-full
Drinkability: Medium, I just couldn't get in to this one. Didn't even bother taking good notes sadly.
*NB: Probably the bottom of the Russian River wild ale's, but still better than most. 420 characterscraytonic, Sep 10, 2009

Overall a great great beer. A sour like you wouldn't think possible in a beer if you've never had a sour ale before (like myself). Impressive 452 charactersboomer31, Sep 08, 2009

Great lactic and tart wild brett funk right off the bat. Lemon and grassy citrus. 
Oak and some wonderful layers of barnyard and slight bandaid rubber. It's acidic and tart, with the malt barely to be seen. The carbonation is not quite champagne quality, but it's tingly and satisfying. Crisp tart apples in here too. Slight sulphurous match, but other than that quite clean and flawless. Yum! The little snifter half-pint was gone before I knew it. 555 charactersSurlyDuff, Aug 31, 2009

Bouquet has a mild funk and is dominated by hay and lemons. Can't wait to taste this one. Quite sour taste here induces some puckering, lemons and grapefruit hit you mid way and the sourness returns and lingers through the finish for quite some time. I prefer Consecreation and Temptation a bit more but this is still another great beer from RR which I'd recommend to anyone who enjoys the style. 497 charactersNick3, Aug 30, 2009

A: Golden orange. Relatively clear. Moderate fizzy head quickly receded with little lacing.
S: Sour lemons. Slight vinegar quality. Funky farmhouse nature. Some hay/wheat.
T: Incredibly sour. Lemons, grapefruit, vinegar, hay, yeast. Not much oak, which isn't surprising considering the age of the barrels used to age this guy.
M: Acidic. Sour. Certainly cleanses the palate of anything that might have been there before. Light bodied, and no sign of alcohol. Effervescent. 
T: Sour and tarty as hell, but has a sweet farmhouse funk to it. Hay and vinegar. Very acidic and funky. My mouth waters with every sip. Also has some oak to it. 
D: Gotta be in the right mood for this one as the sourness is among the highest I've encountered. 750 characterscallmemickey, Aug 29, 2009

A - Hazy golden color with a white head and good lacing. Some sediment present from the bottle.
S - Sour green apples, lemon, and funk. You can tell this is going to be a tart one.
T - Incredibly sour, lemony pale malt, lactic acid, and grapefruit. I know this is blasphemous, but this beer is too sour IMO. Really dominates the rest of the flavors.
M - Sharp and acidic with medium body. Pretty intense.
D - Not very drinkable. It's just too sour to have very much of. Would be quite a chore to take down an entire 750ml of this in one sitting, so it's good they bottle in 375ml too.
EDIT 2/2010: Had this a couple more times from the bottle and it grows on you a bit. Still a bit one-dimensional and overdone, but it is reasonably drinkable and can be tasty if you get the right batch. Raising it from a B- to a high B+. I like this beer now. 986 charactersnickd717, Aug 25, 2009

My first foray into American wild ales pours a hazy golden wheat with a smattering of head. 
Nose is a cornucopia of aromas - a hefty dose of fresh barnyard, hay, leather, funk, oranges and lemons. 
Any initial impression will be struck by the lip puckering sourness of this brew. Behind that lies a body of lemons (fresh squeezed lemon juice!), a hint of funk but not as much as the nose would have led me to believe or as much as I would have expected from a wild ale, hints of sour apples, earthy, bone dry finish. Bright carbonation.
The initial sip is a bit of a shocker but after the taste buds orient to the new adventure I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It wrests every taste bud and demands you hunker down and contemplate its depths. Love the pucker and the funk, time to see what else the world of American sours has in store! 907 charactersritzkiss, Aug 10, 2009

Cloudy yellow pour with a tight white cap that dissipates to a ring and leaves a few spots of lace. HUGE sour aroma of lemons and green apples taht really leaps out at you. Mega-sour flavour, with strong lemon and citrus notes throughout. Odd hints of apple, and a touch of funk. Just impressively sour and overwhelming for me. Light body, with a crisp, dry finish.
I don't think sours are really my thing, whihc will save me a bundle in the long run. However, I'm quite impressed with this and I can see why some people have fallen in love with the style. A very well-constructed beer, but not one I'd look for any time soon. 771 charactersbobsy, Aug 09, 2009

A- Beatification is quite beasutiful. A hazy mix of yellow and orange giving off a glowing look when up towards light. The head was not high, probably like a 1/2 inch of semi loose white foam. Lacing is not great, but this one is still quite a looker.
S- This smells great. A big blast of sourness with a backdrop of citrus consisting of lemons. Not very funky, more tart like. This wild is very closely resembling a gueuze. The smell just lingers from the glass, drawing you in.
T- Oh my, a sour tart punch straight to the tastebuds. This one woke me up. With the up front citrus the squeezed lemon is there plus some minimal grapefruit. There is some funk going on but I would not call it funky, maybe that's just in this newer batch. Quite acidic and delicious. Some oak and more funk come out with warming.
M- Puckering to say the least, let this one roll around in your mouth for some time and it will open you up. Tart, fruity and refreshing. Finishes dry with perfect carbonation giving off a spritzy feel when the drink is colder. The body is in between light and medium and is again perfect for this style.
D- A low ABV like this would grant a whole bottle to the head, but all the bugs in my system afterwards is not a good look and would eat my skinny ass up. When I gain 100 pounds or so I will attempt to drink a 750 of this, for now sharing is fine with me. The drinkability on this is insane, I drank my glass in no time, and now im looking for more. 1,569 charactersBARFLYB, Aug 01, 2009

Poured into La Trappe goblet. 
Poured slowly producing a thin fizzy layer of white head. Fades quickly. No lace. Color is a bright golden orange sunset. 
Aroma: Some vinegar, but has a big funky barnyard aroma going on. A ton of acidic citrus. Very sour of course. A different aroma from what I was expecting, but I like it. 
Taste: Sour and tarty as hell, but has a sweet farmhouse funk to it. Hay and vinegar. Very acidic and funky. My mouth waters with every sip. Also has some oak to it. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is super sour, maybe almost to sour, but I don't mind it. Light bodied with a high level of carbonation. 
Overall, this is a sweet beer. I like the sourness, but it still has a sweet funky farmhouse taste. I can easily drink more of this. 768 charactersmothman, Jul 30, 2009

%ABV: 6.00%
Poured into a Duvel glass this wild has a cloudy golden color with a frothy and retreating head that quickly dissapates to a few bubbles around the edge of the glass.
The Aromas are very crisp, refined, and citrusy. There is a ton of white vinegar in the nose along with dry tannins and light oak. I can definately smell the chardonay in this beer.
First taste is like an intense puckering tart candy. It's like a flavor explosion in the mouth. There is a ton of lemon, vinegar, and lime. This would be the perfect beer with fajitas and handmade corn tortillas.
Mouthfeel is extremely light and airy. There's a little carbonation on the tongue; just enough to increase the tartness of the beer.
Drinkabilty is a tough one to nail on this beer. I could drink one of these every year and be good so I can't say it's really all that drinkable. I don't want to break out the 750 in the cellar by any means. I do think the tastes, smells, and other components are great just not something I'd go back to repeatedly. I will try this again. 1,083 charactersPerzentRizen, Jul 24, 2009

This is a very different beer from what I'm used to. I've had a few sours and this one was the most pronounced in every way. Poured a hazy yellow with about an inch of white head leaving little lacing. Big lemon and citrus smell, some earthy tones and some funk. You can tell this one is going to be sour. First taste was WOW that sour almost in a bad way, but after i keep sipping my taste buds start to get used to what they are sensing. Very tart (obviously), acidic and citrus. This is a very powerful tasting brew, I was thinking about reviewing another beer tonight but I don't know if my taste buds can adjust. Mouth feel is good, not too much carbonation at all. I have an 003 in the cellar I might have to bust it out soon and compare notes. 795 charactersBobbydigi, Jul 09, 2009

A bottle of batch 2 pored into a challis produced a good finger worth of head that disappeared completely rather quickly. The body of the brew was a clear straw colored yellow.
The aroma reminded me of a gueuze in a lot of ways. The typical funk and sour citrus coming from the glass. The flavor was somewhat the same to me it remined me of a gueuze. I know It's a wild, but the sour citris and vinigar flavors were great. The mouthfeel was medium to light with almost no carbonation 
The bottle was quite enough for me but I will say I enjoyed every drop. I think the fact this is so hard to find will probably hinder me from looking forwad to driking this again . I was glad it reminded me of a gueuze so I can easly grab one to help remind me of the experiance 789 charactersjoepais, Jun 29, 2009

I have been wanting to try this wild ale for some time. Nice fine bubbled head, nice gold color. Smells of citrus and the best thing I can describe it as is TANG, before you add water and dilute it. Sour funk on the nose but moreso on the palate. There's a sweet/sour component where the brett/saccaros mingle that is very unique. Feels light on the mouth, but very complex. Excellent sour. 495 charactersHiAIPA, Jun 21, 2009

These Russian River barrel aged wild ales are usually pretty dull looking and this fits right in. Tiny head that dissipates right away and no lace at all. Pilsner colored with chill haze.
Gueuze-like aroma, very grainy and earthy. Not crazy funky, but definite funk-ification.
Flavor is complex and fruity. Lots of fresh strawberry flavor. Brett is a no-brainer. Fresh squeezed white grapefruit juice with a tart punch. Puckering, but by no means brutally sour. The flavors all work in perfect harmony. A very complex and drinkable beer.
No much carbonation, so the mouthfeel is a step above mineral water. No stickyness.
Quite delicious and refreshing, making for a very drinkable beer. Big brownie points for designing a hard-to-make beer, especially consistently. Cheers! 853 charactersrayjay, Jun 17, 2009

Good Lord, what an eye-opener. Pours a hazy orange and very murky champagne-esque consistency. Nice two-finger head quickly dissipates leaving an intriguing beer. Dare I venture any closer? 
As soon as the cork was popped the bretts and wildness of this beer jumped out at me. I absolutely love this smell - acidic, vinegary, EXTREMELY green apples freshly cut, and yes, now I know what the hell "horse-blanket" means. Man, I'm terrified in the most wonderful wonderful way.
First taste - grapefruit, lemon, citrus, citrus, citrus. Extremely tart and acidic. But something happens at the end - something very earthy. If you can imagine eating dirt as a good experience, then that's what it tastes like. These beer tastes like it's been around since the beginning of brewing. I really love it. 
I am very happy that I got a chance to try this. I would love to see what it's like on tap. Right now I must say thanks and give credit to Healthy Spirits in SF for having the only bottle in the whole area (I looked) at the time that I was visiting. 
This whole experience reminded me of the first time that I was in Toronado SF and someone handed the bartender a tulip of sour beer. It may have been Beatification, and, upon drinking it, he made the face that people in middle school used to make when eating sour "Warheads." Afterwards, he put the glass down and said, "That's my favorite beer." I think I understand that experience a little better now. 1,569 charactersraoulduke37, May 29, 2009

- Grimod de la Reyniere
Over-ripened mango dotted with tiny flakes of salt. The carbonation must be extremely fine, if at all existent. The surface is left bare with only the faintest trim. Its complexion is sullied although clarity is left largely unhindered. The beer actually takes on a bright daisy yellow tone when exposed to the afternoon sunlight. 
That the beer is aged in used wine barrels is not at all inconsequential. The brewery may insist they only use the "oldest barrels that no longer have any wine flavor or oak flavor left in them" but even sitting a full foot away I can smell something very similar to a dry white wine. Closer inspection with nostrils right up against the glass confirms, although more vinegary and tart notes also become apparent.
Having been to Belgium before and there having tried plenty of Lambics, I'm having deja vu. This beer (like all the barrel aged offerings from Russian River) were inspired by a trip to Belgium and are intended as interpretations of that country's spontaneously fermented ales. In this regard Russian River succeeds (better than anyone else, at any rate) in replicating the beers - but not of course duplicating them. 
Beatification seems, on the whole, not quite as dry nor as tart as many Lambics. It does offer, however, plenty more funk. Acidic, vinegary notes of wilted citrus, wild honey and over-ripened orchard fruit abound as do the shared characteristics to a dry, sparkling white wine. According to the brewery's bottle log, this batch (#2) is considered "ultra funky". Indeed, it's probably one of the "funkiest" beers I can recall having. 
The contents were put in bottle 29/02/08 but its two comprising batches were laying around in the barrels for some considerable time before that, 19 and 13 months respectively. Given the uniqueness of each batch, it's hard to say how this bottle, now at age one and a half, compares to fresher samples. That said, I see no reason to doubt the 4 hourglass lifespan Russian River labeled it with. 
Fascinating a beer though Beatification may be, it is (admittedly) largely thanks to those few Belgian brewers who continue the tradition of spontaneously fermented ales that such knowledge and technique were handed down (and then west about 5500 miles) to one of North America's most innovative and talented brewmaster. No wonder it's called "Beatification", this beer sure makes me happy! 2,500 charactersbiegaman, May 26, 2009

The nose is really exciting with such balance between the acidic sour and funky wheat tones. Sour cherries and sugary candied feel are really there. Shazam! Sharply tart as you take first sip, vinegary and acidic with lemony zest up front on the tongue, the sour feel really hangs on to both sides of the tongue. Now this really mellows out and turns sustainably powdery. Mouthfeel is early apple crisp and really enjoyable. initially the sour seems a bit strong but it quickly becomes lovely.

M-Pretty dry. Enough carbonation to keep it lively but much less then your average american beer. No alcohol noticable.

3.85/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I have been waiting over a year for an occasion special enough to open this bottle. An advance copy of the new album by my absoute favorite band, Current 93 marks such an occasion. Opens with less of a pop than I was anticipating and pours into the Magic Chouffetulip a deep honeyed gold. The head is very slight, and even with coaxing never rises to more than a quarter inch. Smells are slighter than I expected. A soapy, wood soaked funkiness, and an unidentifiable sourness. Taste follows suite. A sour beer to be sure, but not lemony nor apple like in taste. Simply sour, mouthwateringly so. This is not a sparkly, high on the tongue beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and coating. The sourness lingers, the mouth waters. As the beer warms, smells become much more assertive and pronounced, geueuze like. Drinkability is good, but the sour woodiness keeps this an indulgent sipper.
All in all, a delicious beer, but not as good as the Temptation I had previously. The Current 93, Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain, is a Sunn O like rocker by the way, as unique as their previous offering. Much like this beer. God bless Russian River and Current 93. 1,143 charactersOnibubba, May 15, 2009

Pours a brilliant clear gold, thin white head that turns quickly into a soapy layer. 
Nose is great. So much unfolding as you inhale... lot of barnyard, even heading into cat pee, beautiful notes of vanilla, pears, white grapes, all meshed so well together. It's the integration of the aromas that are so impressive with this ones. 
Taste slips off that velvet glove and just wallops you with one of the most intense, brazenly funked-up sour experiences I've had. Up front, you get clobbered with a nice array of richly funky/sour flavors - wet leather, barnyard, a musty lemony sourness, quite aciditic but held in check by the fantastic funk. Finish has a buttery richness that hints of lemon underneath the lingering leathery funk. The finish does more to lend some balance to the big funky, sour slap in the face than any other aspect of the beer. To me, this is to Gueuze what an American IPA is to its English cousin - a bit more brash, equally complex in a different way but less refined as well. 
Mouthfeel is superb. Rich and full, yet some light and dancing, lingering beautifully on the palate. Lip-smackingly good.
Drinkability is really nice. I savored every sip of this bottle, but unlike, say, Brute or Fou'Foune, I don't know if this is one I could down an entire 750 of. Course, I just realized I finished off this 375 well before I expected to, so...
All in all, a pretty fantastic beer. Definitely a balls-to-the-wall sour - this is not one I'd use to introduce someone to the style, even if I could get it off my local store's shelf. But yowza, what an experience. 1,701 charactersJohnQVegas, May 09, 2009

Pours a beautiful vibrant yellow color, orange highlights, slightly hazed. Real bright. Unripe lemons, barnyard and hay, funky bugs and yeast, grassy very dry aroma. Thinking I'm in for quite the ride here. Ok this beer is a little crazy if you ask me. It is just over the top sour. Pungent brutal sourness. Usually your tastebuds get used to the sour after the first initial sips, but this beer just keeps shocking me everytime I take a sip. With out a doubt the most brazenly sour beer I have ever had. Ballsy. I dig it. Lemon rind, green apple, wheat grass, hay, dust. Remember sour candy like warheads or cry babies? This beer is like an adult version of that. Excellent acidity. It reminds me of the most sour thing I've ever had, which were these little weird fruits called calamondins that grew on a tree in my grandma's backyard in Florida. I used to eat them all the time as a little fellow. They are like tart, acrid little oranges and they taste like this beer. Really an amazing feat in brewing to get so much flavor into one beer. I have to knock the drinkability only a tad because it's so outrageously sour, but it works here. I'm shocked. 1,215 characterstwelvsies, May 08, 2009

I swear my nose catches a ton of scents flourishing out of the glass without holding it up to my nose. White grape, orange, more pronounced cherry, tart lemon, a lot of brett funkiness that combines very nicely with the oak aging that this beer endured. 
On the palate, a little on the sweeter side but still incredibly tart. Huge lemon and white grapes, with boat loads of dry grapes and other tannins, and some really sour cherry accent flavors. I can see where the oak aging comes into play but its not as pronounced. Orange is present mid-sip. The beer is a little a thinner then similar beers but that's not say this is a negative aspect.

4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4375mL bottle, batch 2, poured into a tulip.
Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy golden orange with a creamy white head that settles in as a small cap fed by the bubbles continually streaming up from the bottom. Lacing is good.
The aroma is a great mixture of tart and sweet fruits with a hint of funk. The tartness comes from lemons up front before the sweetness of pears and maybe apples come in as well as a hint of light malts. The funk is present but very, very faint.
The taste turns the tartness and funk up a notch over the aroma. The initial blast on the tongue is a combination of tart lemons and vinegar acidity. The sweet fruits are there but it takes the beer warming up a bit before I can pick out the sweeter aspects with pears again coming through. The finish brings back the acidity and funk and leaves a puckering aftertaste.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and extremely crisp, clean and dry in the finish. Very white wine-like on the palate.
This is another great sour from Russian River and while I probably don't like it quite as much as some of their others, it's still a solid beer. 1,129 charactersgford217, May 02, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've been sitting on this Batch 003 since Clvand0 brought it back from the Land 'O Liberals, about two months ago. Might be the longest two months of my life. It's finally going down!
In stupid fashon, I pop the cork and take a second to examine the cork. Meanwhile the beer decides to leap out before I can get my chalice underneath. Ok, after trying to capture as much of the beer as I can, the session begins. A bright straw colored beer carries a ton of carbonation that continuously fuels the 1/4" persistent head and helps with a lot of eventual lacing. Mild haze which accumulates as each subsequent pours are made. The look reminds me of Duvel but without that rediculous head.
You don't even need to get your nose that close to begin the study of tart citrus fruits, funky mustiness, and acidity. Lemons, grapefruit, citrus rinds combine with cidery, vineous, and vinegar notes to give the impressions of white wine, wood aging, and grandma's basement. Maltiness takes a far back seat, but there is a detection of herbal and maybe citrus hops. With all the acidity and fruitiness, the beer's aroma remains clean and turns away from earthiness or dirt notes.
Flavors are a direct carryover from the nose except for the slight rise in malt pilsner malt flavor which provides a stable foundation for the crazy yeast. Flavors favor the lemons, citrus zest, and acidity while beginning to abandon the vinegar and cider taste. Rising notes of saltiness and sweat come in and give even more complexity to the beer's depth. Still clean, crisp, and refreshing taste.
The beer remains quite thin throughout, resting only on a timid pillow of pilsner malt to add a touch of creaminess and fullness. Otherwise, a mouth coating layer of tartness and acidity washes over and lingers for quite some time. While hop flavor went unnoticed, the bitterness of which melds nicely with the sourness of the citrus and bitterness of fruit rinds.
What is fantastic about this beer is the very clean sourness that avoids the cheesy, grassy, earthy flavors without loosing the complex Brett notes. Certainly not one-dimentional. But like most great sours, the astringency and sourness hurts a bit in texture and drinkability. Still I'll be hard pressed to ever have a better sour. If you had told me that this was a Berlinerweiss, I would have beleived you. 2,345 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 30, 2009

Pours a cloudy, dull yellow with orange hues. At first, a ½ inch white, creamy and frothy head forms but quickly dissipates. A small halo and frothy skimming floats atop during the duration of the drink.
Smells complexly of lemons, banana, light funk - like straw or horse blanket and some pineapple.
Tastes... WOW - lots of sour citrus like the nose... Grapefruits in the mix, too. Light to medium bodied (for a citrus) with medium to full flavor. The sour hits my tongue on tasting to the point that I can feel my jaw react to the pang, very intense. This one's a heavy hitter, lots of sour and sits heavy on the tongue in the aftertaste.
Medium carbonation and highly enjoyable - recommened. 831 charactersbeachbum1975, Apr 30, 2009

Poured a hazy golden yellow colour. White head poured pretty loose and frothy then faded quickly to patchy covering with thick edging... no carbonation... some light lacing...
Aroma - Very strong lambic brett yeastiness, sharp spicy fruits (light grapefruits, lemons, sour apples), musty barnyard / wet hay aromas, light vinegary notes, freshly cut wood, very light pale malts, some basil notes... outstanding...
Taste - Severe mouth puckering sour lemons and grapefruits, salty, light vinegar hints, sour (cooking) apples, yeasty, faint sweet after notes, grapes, light vanilla, floral, grassy, talcum powder, some woody notes, musty, strong champagne like hints... again outstanding...

Well, when I went to open the bottle the cork came off like a champagne bottle, hit my ceiling, then proceeded to foam over. Definately should have let it settle before I awoke the sleeping dragon. Just a disclaimer as it may have affected the review... 
Pours a whitish orange. Almost looks like a wheat beer with a thin bright white head. Smells of citrus and earth. Definitely can smell the malts in this one. The smell is somewhat mild. Taste starts sweet and is followed up by an intense sour. There is a lot of citrus flavor in this beer (apples and grape flavors all add to the citrus flavor). Hops kick in after you swallow and leave a bittering aftertaste. Barrel aging comes through nicely too via the earthy taste. Mothfeel is light with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkablilty is great. Obviously this wouldn't be a session beer. But I think I could have one of two of these after a meal. 986 charactersBeerStine, Apr 12, 2009

Cloudy, hazy golden colored pour. Not much on head but slight bit of lace.
Sour and bitter citrus aromas, definite grapefruit smell, slightly funky.
Taste was bitter and sour, with hints of grapefruit and lemon rind, slightly funky, perhaps leathery as well?

Pours an almost orange hue. Looks like it could have had some massive head but I poured it slowly as to not disturb the sediment layer.
Smells of sour apples, vinegar, funk. A tad muted compared to their other sours. 
Taste is similar to scent. Very tasty, sour, funky.
Mouth is medium in body and medium to high in carbonation. I felt it could have been a little more bubbly.

Pours a flat looking head, crazy really, as moments later the carbonization builds up and a thin, striking white head appears. This head then slowly dissipates into a white ring, but the end result as you drink is some thin, but dense lacing. It almost looks like an arnold palmer (half lemonade and half iced tea), by that I mean a yellowish tan, but rather light/clear. A potent sour smell up front, mellows a bit to an earthy undertone. This is the sour I have been waiting to try, it is a super crisp lemony sour, with a sweet ting at the end. I must admit, I am a novice when it comes to Wild Ales, with some having that barn/leathery taste that I do not care for. This is thing is a pure crisp sourness, really none of the earthy smell comes through in the taste. Obviously, very tart in your mouth, and as you drink it will hit the back of tongue hard too. In the end, an amazing beer from a pure, crisp sour standpoint. I'll need to try more to compare my tastes now... 1,092 charactersbhalter8, Apr 05, 2009
4.09/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 001-PH1. Bright kumquat with Champagnesque carbonation. Too bad the foam cap is nothing to write home about. It fizzes away like soda and is nearly gone by the several minute mark. Needless to say, the glass is virtually spotless. Maybe all those bugs or the acidity is to blame. As with most gueuzes, the lack of a quality head and lace isn't a huge negative in a wild ale.
The aroma is dizzyingly complex and is a pleasure to sniff. Nothing is overdone and pretty much everything is done... exactly... right. Tart fruit vinegar is dominant, with a perfect amount of buggy funk. According to the brewery, the PH1 batch used the highest quality (that is, the most Acetobacter-heavy) La Folie barrels.
If I hadn't picked up that fun fact from the Russian River website, I could have figured it out from the first mouthful. Wow, this stuff is tangy-tart! It isn't so much funky (in a sweat sock or horse blanket kind of way), so it won't alienate those who have a low tolerance for such flavors.
Beatification has to be the most gueuze-like of all the RR wild ales. That will be a positive for some and a negative for others. My impression is that the big blast of acidic tartness overpowers what might have been a deeper, more complex, oak barrel-aged blonde ale. Others may (and probably will) respectfully disagree.
The beer is reminiscent of an extremely tart white wine in many respects. Yes, I would have thought that even without knowing that white wine yeast was used. Flavors include immensely sour fruit (white grapes, green apples, lemons), cider vinegar, tannic oak and a mild-moderate, bacteria-derived grunginess. Can a beer taste both clean and dirty at the same time? Dirty in a good way, of course.
The mouthfeel is good because it fits the gueuze... er, wild ale... style very well. It's light to light-medium and has a sneaky slickness that keeps the flavors from fading away until long after the swallow. In spite of the guillotined look, the carbonation is gently energetic. Actually, by the bottom of the bottle, things are pretty calm.
This buggier version of Beatification Batch 001 won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's pretty uncompromising in its tart acidity, which will tend to put some people off. I appreciate and respect the skill that went into its creation, but there are quite a few Russian River brews that I find to be superior. 2,374 charactersBuckeyeNation, Mar 29, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got around to drinking my bottle of batch #2 tonight. Poured the dregs into a sour beer I'm currently fermenting, maybe it'll add something positive to the mix.
Poured a very clear orange color with zero head and not a ton of carbonation. Enough, but I expected it to be more carbed.
Smell is pure tart grapefruit and funk. Pretty damn funked up.
Taste is basically the same, super funky, sour grapefruit and some tropical fruit flavors mixing into the lactic bite.
Light in body, and incredibly easy to drink for a spontaneously fermented beer. The lambics I've had previously are usually so puckering they take some work. This is clean, delicious sour beer. Did I just say clean? I mean filthy. 708 characterskleffman, Mar 22, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Split a 375ml bottle of Batch 002 with Mrs. ThirdLap tonight. Wild ales have become her favorite style in recent months, and because of this I've been able to try all sorts of new beers. Never thought in a million years that she would have turned ME on to a style.
Beatification pours a clear yellow, reminiscent of sparkling apple cider. No head after a vigorous pour, and bubbling subsides after a few minutes. Even gentle pouring resulted in the second glass having a large amount of sediment in it, resulting in a cloudier appearance.
Smell is best described as a tart citrus funk.
The taste is obviously very sour, and the closest experience I can compare it to is the initial overwhelming acidic blast you get when you stick a slice of lemon into your mouth. Complementing the citrus are hints of white wine and tart cherries. Every sip results in a huge mouth-watering response by the taste buds.
Body is right in the middle, and the finish is incredibly crisp and clean. Carbonation in this batch is low to medium. The 5% alcohol is nearly imperceptible. 
Drinkability is excellent.
Very tasty. No one does sours like Russian River. 1,146 charactersThirdLap, Mar 10, 2009

The beer is golden orange colored and a little hazy with a very thin head. You know it's gonna be sour from the first sniff, acidic and "lambicy". The taste is intense lemon juice and funk, so acidic and tasty it's hard to differentiate from the wicked lambics I've had in Brussels and Brugge. Very dry aftertaste, and alum pucker that lasts and is reborn with each lick of the lips. This is the most sour wild ale I could imagine, very similar to my memory of Apfelwein in Frankfurt but with carbonation. Apfelwein is German apple cider and can be very sour (especially the Saurer Most version). 761 charactersTurdFurgison, Mar 08, 2009

Batch 002
Served in a tulip
Acquired in a trade with mikesgroove
The beer poured a hazy, golden yellow with no head but merely a thin layer of bubbly, bright white froth.
The aroma was super funky and tart. Sour to the max! Citric and acidic with intense lemon notes. Musty and dry. Hay and horse blanket came through strong. As the beer warmed, the mustiness really intensified.
The taste was outrageously sour. At first, this beer more closely resembled pure lemon juice than a "typical" beer. Extremely acidic. Earthy, musty, funky and barnyard-y.The dry, semi-tannic finish was oaky, funky and musty with an intense lemony tartness. Loads of woody earthiness carried into the lingering aftertaste. A surprising amount of hops were noticeable as well. Overall, the flavor profile was rather interesting and unique, yet it definitely was not as complex as I hoped it would be.
The mouthfeel was thinner bodied with a fine, champagne-like effervescence. Slightly watery. For some reason, the lively carbonation did not smooth out or fluff up the beer.
This beer was blindingly sour. In fact, I cannot think of another that is more tart. Even though I love most sour beers, I found this one to be rather overwhelming and somewhat lacking in a number of areas. 1,323 charactersDamian, Feb 27, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bought a bottle at Beachwood, consumed on the premises.
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy but brilliant (read: bright) lemon gold color. Head is fizzy and appropriate for its funky goodness, but settles quickly into a thin whisper of what it once was. Lacing is similarly fizzy and lively, but has better retention than the head. I love these beers for how lively their heads/lacing can be.
Smell: Chardonnay-type white grape vinousity, brett, lacto, and other various wild yeasts I'm not even familiar with. Lots of "spicy"-type aromas, including what I decided was white pepper. Apricot, moldy mustiness, mango on the back end. What can you say? These RR Wild Ales go on for days. It's difficult to discern all the aromas and flavors in one sitting.
Taste: Cork wood, champagne-like vinousity, brett and other wild yeasts, apricot, peach, pear. A little less complex than the nose, and the wild yeasts are far more assertive here, to the point that they begin to drown out other flavors. Still, pretty amazing.
Mouthfeel: IT'S ALIVE. 
Drinkability: Went down surprisingly well. This was most comparable to Temptation for me, which I think I still prefer slightly, but still, very drinkable. More so than Supplicaton. 1,223 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Feb 22, 2009

Taste: WOW! very sour, a lemony sourness. This flavor does not match what I expected from the smell, I am very pleasantly surprised. This sourness all ends with a smoothed out malt flavor. After your palate gets used to the sourness some sweet berries start to pop out, like raspberries or strawberries. 
Mouthfeel: Sour pucker initially. Huge tingle, leaves the mouth pretty dry. 
Overall: Amazingly huge flavor, very intense. Once you get a little use to the sourness many other more subtle flavors begin to pop out and the beer becomes more drinkable. 830 charactersnatasharai, Feb 22, 2009

A- Body is a very cloudy (nearly opaque) hazy straw yellow. Pours with a hefty 2 finger+ foamy white head (it did gush some upon opening). Head retention is great...eventually fading to 1 finger and keeping that the rest of the way down.
S- The first thing that hits the nose is a big whiff of tart lemon. Lemon all over the place. Behind this is a very noticeable oak presence.
T- Much more wonderful and complex than the smell. Very tart and slightly sweet lemon zest is definitely the main character here. The acidic tartness puckers the lips slightly but a slight bready sweetness balances it out. The oak is definitely detectable but hides deep in the background and comes through a little more for the finish but never overshadows the main characters. What also comes forward for the finish is a saltiness. It finishes rather abruptly and is very dry-esp for a brew with a lower ABV.
M- Great medium to high carbonation and a light body with a balance of breadiness and citrus.
D- This was an excellent brew and one I would definitely trade for again. It ended a gathering with a few other BAs that turned out to be a Russian River night. These 3 beers (this deviation, and the younger) were definitely my favorite by this brewing co. so far and I look forward to trying other brews they have to offer. 1,383 charactersPittBeerGirl, Feb 18, 2009

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a 750ml Bottle into a Snifter.
Appearance - Pours a transparent honey gold into the glass. The head is minimal and leaves virtually no lacing behind as it dissipates. The head becomes a thin halo around the rim of the glass. The head retention is minimal - a swirl of the glass brings the head back for a moment, but then quickly dissipates once more. 
Smell - The smell is pretty awesome. There is a large fruit component is this one. I detect green apple, green apple skins, sour grape, lemon and a small bit of cherry. The wild yeast makes a large appearance here, there is a lot of funk from the Brett and a large sour component as well. There is a slight oakiness as well.
Taste - The taste is very similar to the smell, but far more pronounced. Green apple, green apple skins, sour grapes, and lemon all make for the main fruit flavors. The sour comes through pretty strong. There is more sour in the flavor than in the scent, and vice versa for the funk. Light oakiness - not at all overpowering.
Mouthfeel - Man, this is really smooth for a sour. While the sour is powerful and you can feel it all over the inside of your mouth, it glides down the throat. Light/medium bodied. 
Drinkability - Man this is a drinkable wild ale - the mark of a good one in my book. The flavors are melded perfectly. This beer is a work of art. Get some and horde it.

Pours a beautifully crystal clear pale amber, a couple shades darker than later batches of Beatification. The head crackles away almost instantly in a champagne-like fashion. The nose is rather acetic with a surprising amount of sour fruit character (strawberries came to mind). Very Rodenbach-like, minus any sweetness. It's similar on the tongue, with much more acetic acid than the other batches, very Flemish, very sour and puckering. Big tropical fruit flavors. Crisp dry mouthfeel, light-bodied, highly carbonated. Nearly a perfect sour in my opinion. The acetic character isn't something I'm always fond of, but it works beautifully here. 724 characterslargadeer, Feb 11, 2009

Batch 003
A: Pours a semi-hazy orange, yellow with a one finger spritzy white head; Looking at the bottle this one seemed more clear, but it looks like it got some chill haze perhaps. The look is almost glowing.
S: Tons of sweet and tartness rolled into one hell of a lemon, puckering scent. We had an Isabelle right before this, and although they are similar in smell, Beatification is much sweeter. Some oak and slight cherry scents pull through as well.
T: Get ready to pucker. This one is a sour ball in a glass. The good thing about this though is that the finish is rather sweet. Great lemon zest and orange bitter flavors shine through and it is rather complex with a solid oak element.
Overall, this was just fantastic. Of the wilds I have had, I would put Isabelle above this, but Beatification is way better than Temptation IMO. 981 characterstreyrab, Feb 11, 2009

T-M - Nice champagney carbonation, sour brew, tastes like it smells; touch vinegary with sour citrus twists; lemony

4.26/5  rDev -4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Split this one with BA Pecorasc. Poured from a 12.7 oz bottle into a tulip glass.
A- Pours a vibrant gold that just seems to illuminate. Definitely has some haze to it. Two fingers width of off-white head was formed.
S- Not as pungent as I expected. Had a mellow, earthy aroma. Also detected musty, oak scents as well.
T- As this beer progressed in warmth, the taste became more complex and enjoyable. In the later stages heavy notes of what seemed like citric rinds produced a sour explosion in the mouth. This was offset by a dominant oak flavor that complimented it rather nicely.
M- This thing was mouth puckering. After an initial sip, I could not keep my mouth from drooling due to the extreme sourness. Quite an experience.
D- This is definitely a slow drinker. Even splitting a 12.7 oz bottles two ways was enough for me. 
Overall, quite a very unique and well-made beer. While the sourness was dominant, it was not overpowering and was wonderfully counterbalanced with oak flavors. A must try. 1,008 charactersrhinos00, Feb 02, 2009
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy light orange. Given the force which which it opened and gushed out of the bottle, minimal white head which rapidly dissipates into a ring around the edge and light dusting on top.
The smell fills the room - perhaps that's because of the half ounce which was spilled. But lifting it to the nose, sends a barrage of sour scents: sour apples, fresh lemons, a swirl brings out a funk with some earthy elements, but still warm. I could keep my nose buried in this.
Wow - that's nice. Clearly acidic and tart with sour apples and lemons again. But there's so much more to this beer. There is a sweetness, and I get oak notes - maybe similar a Chardonnay. The finish - well, a minute after the sip - there's a hint of bitterness. To minutes later, there are warm, earthy, woodsy flavors. As I move the air around my closed mouth, I get a distinct oak impression at he back of my palate - not sure if that's the taste or smell or the intersection of the two. Drinking this beer slowly allows the complexity of flavors to develop, rapid sips really build the lemon flavors in particular.
Palate cleansing, quite dry. Tiny bubbles and dryness are reminiscent of a champagne. Moderate level of carbonation.
I love a good sour like this as an aperitif, but a 750ml bottle is a bit excessive for this purpose. The acidity may be slowing, depending on what is paired with it or eaten before it. The low ABV and refreshing taste and palate are what caused me to think of this as a Super Bowl session beer. It fit the bill quite well, taking me from halftime through the end of the game, when it proved prophetic to have selected a sour given the outcome.
This is a fine beer. I probably wouldn't reach for it as much as some beers which are clearly lower rated and less fine examples of craftsmanship. But a lot of that is due to the price and the fact so few people I drink with enjoy sours. 1,895 charactersjpiper, Feb 02, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a very clear amber with tiny bubbles, a 1 fingered head and minimal lacing. The smell is of sour cherries. For being barrel aged so long you can barely taste that flavor because the sour flavor is so powerful, yet good, I really enjoy this bottle. A very slick mouthfeel and for a sour certainly one of the more drinkable beers I have had. 355 charactersBiggness, Feb 01, 2009

Not much of a nose, funk and brett a bit. Would go killer with food. Also very interested to see how this will age. Should the texture soften and the brett and other funk develope this could turn out to be something very special. 341 characterspaytoplay, Feb 01, 2009
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a bright gold with medium intensity and just a touch of haze. An average pour provides no head to speak of. A thin layer of carbonation forms on the top of the brew a few minutes after the pour. Of course, with no head, no retention follows. It does seem to muster some lacing though. 
S - Some sour / tart fruit comes through at first. Mostly green apple and lemon. Then it quickly turns to a musty aroma which is quite nice. Hay pops in to accompany the musty aromas. Finishes up with notes of ferrmenting fruit and wood. 
T - Pow! Tart green apples and lemon burst onto the palate first. They really do a number on the taste buds. There is a huge amount of eathiness that follows and plays a wonderful companion to the fruitiness. Kind of reminds me of the forest after a nice hard rain. Wet leaves and wood come through first. The wood flavor starts to resemble oak at this point. Some hay and barnyard flavors bring up the rear. Splendid.
M - Medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Finish is tart, dry, sour, a little sweet...it really cover most of the bases and it hangs on for dear life as long as it can. 
D - Drinkability is great. This brew really hits all the characteristics I would look for in a wild ale. The oak adds a nice touch that comes through just stong enough to compliment the other flavors. You would think the low alcohol would make this one really easy to put away but this is one that should be savored and enjoyed slowly. Another home run for Russian River. 1,501 characterscsmiley, Jan 31, 2009

A: Pours a lightly hazy dark yellow with a mild white head.
S: Sour apples, light malt, similar to a gueuze, light funk to it.
T: Just a beautiful beer. Light fermented fruit plays with the acidity in a complex, great mix. Almost a champagne quality to it, reminded me a lot of Cantillon with the high acidity. If I tasted this blind I would have thought it a Belgian gueuze, no doubt about it.
M: Very sour, not as dry as I thought it would be, it has a light sweetness that carries it through. What I want in a mouthfeel for a wild ale.
D: This is really good. Had to almost chug my first one since I had to order 3 beers at a time and couldn't carry them all. The second time around I got to really get into the beer. This is my first time having this one, and it shows Vinnie really knows what he's doing. This with Supplication are my favourite RR sours. Edit 2/2010 - I just had some batch 2 of this that may be the best beer I've ever had, the complexity and flavour is incredible and delicious. 1,028 charactersHalcyondays, Jan 31, 2009
2.95/5  rDev -34%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2375 mL bottle tried 20 Sep 2008.
Poured into a tulip glass. Very small white head, well carbonated. Slightly cloudy bright orange gold color. Smells quite tart, sour, with cherry pits and stone fruit. Good up to this point, then the wheels come off while tasting. Starts sour, the middle is tart and the finish is sour. This overwhelming sourness invades my mouth and beats my tastebuds senseless. Any remaining functioning tastebuds are mopped up by the long lingering sour aftertaste. All of my orifices are puckered by this assault. There are probably some other underlying flavors but they are lost to me.
I can see why some people might like this, and I respect that it's a difficult style to make, but holy cow... 721 charactershtomsirveaux, Jan 29, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750 into a tulip glass. Hazy straw color with some mottled white lace. Dry citrus aroma with yeasty funk. Starts off with a punch of tart unripe raspberry and citrus. It shows a lot of complexity mid-palate, with orange rind and tropical fruit unfolding into some barnyardy funk, and finishing musty with a touch of aged cheese. Dry throughout with lingering tartness.
The closest thing to a Belgian Gueze I've had from an American brewer. One of those beers that keeps you guessing, and sipping. Impressive complexity for the ABV. Although this may be one of the most impressive beers I've had in terms of brewing perfection, the price is tough to overlook. I'd sooner spend $24 on a good pinot or zin. 718 charactersbcm119, Jan 29, 2009

A - Cloudy yellow hazy pour. Lovely swirling sediment with a light head that dissipates rather quickly.
S - Funk, Brett, Barnyard, Lemons, Apples.
T - Funky in a good way. A bit like funky apple cider with lemons. Very subtle and enjoyable sweetness to balance the sour. Ends dry and tart. Slight hints of stinky tofu for those who have had the pleasure (or displeasure) of eating it.
M - Great carbonation and mouth feel from the bottle conditioning. Kinda champagne like without the intense carbonation.
D - RRBC makes great sours and this is no exception. Wish this were available all the time. Will I ever have a bad beer from them? 659 charactersLilMatrix, Jan 20, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5I'd had this beer before, and enjoyed it immensely, at two different GABF's. It was even better in the bottle - super sour, uncompromising, and delicious. Very gueuze-like, which is not such a stretch once you read the description of this beer.
It poured a hazy straw color with an exuberant head which stuck around forever. Aroma was very gueuze-like, and it was a touch champagne-like, but also rough, chalky, and very citrus-y. Not understated like Cantillon - this stuff is assertive, very sour, not overly sweet (like Berlinerweisse) with a very rough and chalky mouthfeel. If Cantillon was in Michigan rather than Brussels, then this is what gueuze would be known to taste like. In addition to rough-ness, mouthfeel is also very carbonated. 
Flyer bought this in CA, and brought it over for a tasting at my house with SurlySober which also included Allagash Black, Gouden Carolous, and Westvleteren 12 (quite respectable, eh?). 935 charactersBeerBelcher, Jan 19, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to BrewerB for this one!
750 ml cage-corked bottle, poured into a tulip glass:
Pours hazed/clouded golden with a pillowy white head that thins and stays. Uneven rings of lacing stick.
The smell is of lemon, sour/tart with oak and some grassy notes.
The taste is of tart lemon, very funky, acidic and oaky - some vanilla. Bready with fruitiness that becomes peach-like, then orange (with some banana and coconut). Enough malt is there to balance things out. Complex with an underlying funky sourness that works very well!
There's an effervescence to it while maintaining a nice body.
Funky, complex, nicely done! 624 charactersjwc215, Jan 18, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased directly from RRBC. Batch 003. Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into my NBB snifter. I miss the older style 375ml bottles that they used to have for their sours but the extra size here more than makes up for that. The label has the usual RRBC on the back - wish more breweries took the time and care to do stuff like that. It was a hazy golden yellow color. It had tons of carbonation. No lacing. I poured slowly, as suggested on the label, so as not to disturb the yeast so the head was quite small. Fizzy, white and gone in a flash. 
The aroma was FUNKY (oh yeah). Barnyard, wet horse blanket and lemon. I love sour beer aromas and this one was excellent. The taste was a sour bomb with a carb attack to boot. Mouth puckering sour from start to finish. Vinegary and funky. Ends very dry but then lets up right before being too dry. Mouthfeel is exceptional with great carbonation and acidic bite.
Overall, another classic from Russian River. I like Supplication and Temptation a tad better but this one is outstanding. Got another one that I'm going to age a bit and see how it tastes in about a year. Highly recommend. Wish I could get more of it.
**RE-SAMPLE** Had my aged one on 9/14/09. Poured into a Duvel tulip so even more carbonation this time. Head was larger and stuck around a bit longer. Aroma was still funky but was more classic brett with the lemon and barnyard toned down a little but still great. Taste was also still amazing. Would leave scores the same if re-reviewing. 1,514 charactersTexIndy, Jan 16, 2009

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle (batch 003) poured into my Russian River "Barrel Aged Ales" goblet (pretty ugly design though). Beatification is a spritzy gold with a large white head that leaves scattered lace. A nice crackle to the head, even though it is pretty quick to dissipate, impressive for what essentially is a gueze. 
Smell is very pithy and mineral laden, lemon tonic water, must and a touch of vinegar, very nice. 
Taste is wild for sure, wow. I had batch 2 before and it really blew my mind, and this one really lives up to my high expectations. Very tart and complex, citrus and a bit of sugar, though the sweetness is quickly cut by the sour, dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is spritzy and crisp, super dry, light body. 
Drinkability is pretty high if your a fan of gueze, in that I wouldn't mind have this on a regular basis. Still, the extreme acidity makes it a very slow sipper and not something I want more then one bottle of in an sitting. Ever since I heard about their plans to make a 'sonambic', I knew I had to get my hands on some. While it's undoubtedly awesome, it's prohibitively expensive, which is really a shame, as it mean I'll have to really hoard my reaming bottles for special occasions, like another Christmas! This should age very well, if I can manage to hold onto it that is!!! 1,295 charactersccrida, Dec 26, 2008

Pours a hazy light amber with a good head. Not much retention or lacing, but enough to get by. The smell is of tart fruit and just a general funky scent. Kind of like apple cider or some other cider. I actually do not have much experience with wild ales, but I really dig this. Some that I've smelled are a bit off-putting, but this one really smells good. The taste is really great. You could sort of describe it as sweet-tarts or pixie sticks. Also, there's a bit of a white wine kind of taste, white grapes and barrels. But there's a rush of sourness that is well-balanced with sweetness. There is a bit of a tart finish, but some brett beers are too tart. This one is just perfect. You get a good rush of carbonation along with the taste. I could really sip on this beer for hours and hours. The flavor is great, and the sourness will force you not to drink at a rate that will let the alcohol catch up to you. 1,060 characterstaylorhamrick, Dec 26, 2008

Aroma is sour and quite funky (barnhouse funk, horseblanket). Flavor of initial tartness, sweet tart candies. The flavor is less funky than the aroma. This is sour but not puckering sour, so it is quite drinkable for its style. Awesome sour that I can't believe I got the chance to try on tap!

Smells potent, very tart. Redolent lemons, yeast, orange tic tacs, and pink starburst. Very intense, very sweet and sour. 
Tastes even stronger than it smells. Jesus! The sourness is amazing, so strong it should be synthetic but also smooth enough to drink. Likening it to other flavors is sort of pointless, since it doesn't quite taste like anything I've ever come across before, not even very sour candies. It's just a hugely intense, unique sourness backed up by smooth, lightly spicy yeast. 641 charactersmynie, Dec 01, 2008

Smells like champagne and Belgian yeast. Extremely tart!
Taste is unbelievably tart, like sweet tarts mixed with Granny smith apples. I can't penetrate the tartness to get a feel for the underlying complexity; I literally sweat at the temples when I drink this beer. I would say it's a taste you'll either love or hate, but I'm actually pretty on the fence about it.
The low ABV doesn't help drinkability much. The tartness is far too strong to make big swigs possible.
I'm glad I tried it. I have one aging (we'll revisit in a year) but I doubt I'll be laying down $23 for another bottle. 747 charactersgyllstromk, Nov 29, 2008

Pale straw color, slightly hazy. Half-finger snow white head has little staying power, fading into a thin cap and collar in seconds. Funk hits the nose as soon as the cork pops. Once it hits the glass, grapefruit, grass, herbs, spice and lemon come out. Lemony, acidic sour bite on the palate first. After a while more erth, grass, spice and funk come through. Pronounced oakiness as well. Mouthfeel is tart, light and refreshing. I could drink this stuff like water.
Not particularly good looking, but everything else about this beer is spectacular. Complex, yet crisp and refreshing; Highly recommended. 645 characters0110x011, Nov 28, 2008

Flavor is straight-up earthy malt sourness, with a definite funk, holy cow. Sourness is on full display, as the acidic citrus hits every tastebud and tells them exactly how it's going to be.
Ripe grapes & pungent lemon mixed with a light woody taste on the finish. Dry as dry.

A: Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with almost now head at all -- a few bubbles and a slight swirl. Bits of overly moist, spotted lacing appear then disappear as I swirl. 
S: Aromas of horse blanket, brett, grass, and some earthy funkiness, underlying hints of sour citrus like lemon, and something that smells similar to Playdough. Very similar to this years CL Cuvee de Castleton. 
T: There's a lot going on here. Quite tart and liberally sour, slightly puckering so on the finish -- you can feel a slight sour burn if you breath out your nose immediately after you swallow -- though I've certainly had beers that pack a more sour punch like Cantillon Lou Pepe. I really can't pick out the base of this beer, but the overlaying flavors are lemony, slightly spicy, and positively funky.
M: Smooth and very slick, but still light to medium bodied. Much lower levels of carbonation than a champagne, though there are some tingly bubbles. 
D: This is a really enjoyable wild ale, the mouthfeel is a bid lacking in my opinion but I'd often seek this beer out if I had ready access to it. Honestly though, if you're looking for sour, Cantillon's got this beat. 1,203 characterskasper, Nov 21, 2008

A - Into da snifta. A cloudy sunset gold, with a layer of bubbles one could *almost* call a head. A very, "I just woke up and peed in this glass" quality to it. Not truly appetizing, but not horrid. No lacing.
S - NOW we're talking. So good. Major brett vibes, white wine, huge oakiness, limes, sour apples, fruit stand. Very VERY slight vinegar notes. The more I drink, the more I smell potpourri... christmas potpourri.
T - I was totally in the mood for a sour and this one hits the mark. Lots of tartness up front, puckering. Lactic acidity, dry finish. Earthy, yet refined. Oak highly noted in the finish, also sour green apples, citrus zest, apple cider vinegar. Fantastic in both execution and taste. It leaves your lips salty and sour after sips.
M - Medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Perfect for the style.
D - Hugely drinkable for the tastes involved. I couldn't really drink this ALL night, but if I had more than one, I'd be reaching for it.
Notes: This doesn't even compare to JP's Biere De Mars Grand Reserve in terms of tartness. That shit was ridiculous. 1,100 charactersSaucyA, Nov 03, 2008
4.07/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 12.7 oz. bottle (Batch 002) into a snifter.
Appears a cloudy golden yellow with a quarter inch white head that sinks down quickly to a skim. Doesn't leave much lacing at all.
Aroma is nice and sour. Fruity, with a dominant granny smith apple tartness, perhaps a bit of tropical fruit is actually present behind the tart. 
Taste is very sour, almost to the point that not much else comes through. I'm getting more of the apple tartness but now lots of lemon. 
Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation level is quite low but it is appropriate. Very soft on the palate.
Not as good as Supplication, perhaps a bit too sour almost, but it's still very tasty. I hope I get the chance to try some more RR sours sometime soon. 729 charactersroadhouse, Oct 30, 2008

A: Hazy golden yellow/orange. Pours with virtually no head. Fairly active carbonation bubbling up to the top that quickly mellows
S: Tart green apples. Funky, a little musty. 
T/M: Vert tart; probably the tartest beer I've had. Tastes like sour green apples. Earthy. Dry. Not as light bodied, carbonated and crisp as a Belgium gueuze. Interesting stuff.
D: Drinkable in the sense that it's low in abv. But unless you enjoy Warheads regularly you probably aren't going to consume more than a glass of this.
Of the RRBC sours, I put this one last. It's a little too tart for my tastes. But that doesn't mean it's not an interesting one. 649 charactersabfraser, Oct 25, 2008

I have wanted a great beer for a long time, and I have been anxiously awaiting the day I got to have a truely great sour beer. I waited until the last day of my vacation to open it. 
This beer pours a clear golden yellow color with an almost non existant head that disappears instantly, leaving no laces. It looks quite thin.
This beer as a sour aroma. It smells slightly of viniger, but not in a bad way at all. It has a fruity aroma also. Mostly apple, but with some lemon. It has a slight earthy yeast aroma as well.
This beer tastes like it smells. Sour, and great. Slightly viniger like. It has a citrusy fruit flavor of lemons. Also so apple flavor. Mmmmm, that sour flavor is great.
This beer is thin, and very low in carbonation, suiting it quite nicely. It is very crisp, and refreshing. 
I think this beer would make a great session beer. It tastes great, and is low in alcohol. I know that after a few, I could still taste the complexity of this fine beer. If I could get a few cases of it, I would love it.
Overall: Great beer by a great brewer. I have been wanting it for quite some time, and now I am satisfied. I WILL have this one again. If they ever make a Batch 3. 1,335 charactersOStrungT, Oct 14, 2008

Beautiful pale hazy gold. Minimal ring of white froth and a bit of lace.
Sour funky aroma. Sourdough, yogurt, green apple, lemon and berries, bacterial funk like damp earth and mature goat cheese, and some wood and vanilla.
Tastes powerfully sour, like yogurt squared, with clean bright fruit and deep drying wood. Quite dry and refreshing. After several seconds, a deep bacterial note like aged goat cheese develops. Lingering acidity and wood.
Soft carbonation with prickly acidity and some woody astringency. Quite refreshing and drinkable.
Great beer. 611 charactersBeerzebub, Oct 04, 2008
3.04/5  rDev -32%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Paid $13.99 for a 12.7 oz bottle from Monument Liquor in Concord, CA. Poured into the largest wine glass I have and shared with my girlfriend.
3/4 inch very fizzy white head. Heavily carbonated. A very cloudy yellowish gold color. Not too much head retention. Little lacing.
The wild yeast dominates the nose. Some grassier hops balance this one out. Carbonation present in the nose as well. Hints of dank bread - this would probably be a great pairing with good, fresh bread. Perhaps a bit of lemon in there as well - quite a complex offering. Not the most pleasant aroma, but certainly you have to give them credit for creating something this unique.
Taste is very sour. Very wild. Very different. Likeable? Not really, but it was fun to try. The taste is quite different than the smell - almost like sour candy. That sour taste lingers for a long time. Not as complex as the nose.
Very carbonated mouth. Light body. Definitely a sipper. Not sure of the occasion I would want to bust this one out for. 1,007 charactersibbjamin, Oct 04, 2008

S: Tart lemons, funk, and sweet tarts.
T: Lots of lemon up front with some crushed sweet tarts coming thru. A bit of pungent cheese in the middle and a bit of oak in the finish. Rather bold and sour.
M: Light in body with a great deal of fizz. Stings the mouth and tongue a bit with its sourness. Dry in the finish.
D: Drink the whole bottle myself without problem. A bigger serving would be too much though.
Very nice overall. 565 characterstpd975, Sep 26, 2008

The color was golden amber, good carbonation, the right amount of head (a lot less than some temptations I've popped which seem to have too much carbonation and have to settle).
The taste was strange. Sour, funky, but delicious. Every sip got better. I passed the glass around and the general consensus was highly recommended. 407 charactersantilogic, Sep 22, 2008

The smell is sour and stinky, but invating like so many other stinky things I love.
The taste is just addiction, I first you wonder what the attraction of such a nasty concoction is but then you just keep sipping until it is gone then you want more. It is just odd. Favors of sour stink, and outstanding blend of stinks. I just have no clue, odd fruits and stink.
The mouthfeel is good, a light and airy brew with a light stinky body and good stinky carbonation.
The drinkability is fantastic. That is all I can say, give me more.

a - cloudy gold, fading/thin head.
s - very similar to Cantillion (I don't have a *ton* of experience tasting sours). Lots of sour, yum. Not as much sulphur as Cantillion.
t - Starts out very sour and then fades away into watery. Like Cantillion diluted with maybe 20% water. Nice, agreeable sour flavors, but not blow-me-away sour. 
m - Easy, not too puckering
d - pretty high. Really good pLambic. Would probably age well for 1-2 yrs? 
I prefer the Cantillion, but this was delicious. I'm a little proud of the fact that it was made in the US!

Hazy golden color with almost no head at all.
Smells sour. Really sour.
This is the sourest beer I have ever had. I can almost pick up some citrus and fruit notes, but everytime I try to put my finger on it, the sourness takes over. This beer reminds me of that candy "warheads." I think it's a good thing, I like this one for sure.
Mouthfeel is puckering. If you let this beer sit in your mouth for too long, you will eventually pucker. I think that's pretty cool for a wild ale.
Drinkability is good, not something you can down though. 686 charactersHojaminbag, Sep 17, 2008

my brother (abcjiugui) got this in a trade with brewerb
batch 002, poured into small tulips
hazy, deep golden straw. some head, soon fades to wisps and ring. minimal lacing.
aroma of tart vinegar and cider, with lots of wood note and a mild barn funk. grass and hay mingle. whiff of phenols.
quite sharp acidity from the start. both cider and champagne vinegars. woody note melds with mild bitterness and sharp acidity int a tart, semi-dry finishi, with hints of phenols and mild funk.
not too thin, but lots of acidic texture and astringency. moderate carbonation does help to accentuate acidity and other flavors.
not bad, but pricey for what you get. i expected a little more for a top 100 beer... 747 characterschinabeergeek, Sep 14, 2008

Pours an almost clear light amber, almost golden, thin bone white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around my new Bruery glass, drops some nice lace spots on the glass. Smell is badass, tons of oak and vinegar, lots of funky goodness, wine, vanilla, some honey and biscuity malty sweetness underneath the acidic lemons, almost a fresh floral character, kind of like a riesling, pretty awesome. Taste is intense, sweet and sour beginning when it kicks you in the tonge, more of a sweet wine, I get a lot of dry riesling character, fresh floral and honey notes, then the funky acidic character hits, like toasted lemons, vinegar, wood, very nice herbal sour finish, perfectly balance. Mouthfeel is light bodied, silky smooth, low carbonation, goes down insane easy for a sour. Not as much of a palate bruiser as I expected, just perfectly balanced sourness, tons of character, I could drink this stuff all day. 1,031 charactersViggo, Sep 04, 2008

In the taste, small fruitiness and tart, again kind of like a sweettart. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry tartness in the aftertaste. Fantastic, big sourness, small fruitiness, primarily lemon like citrus, and just a hint of oak. 390 charactersOWSLEY069, Sep 01, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Again thanks go out to BrewerB for hooking me up with this beer. 375mL bottle poured into a tulip glass.
A: Pours the slightest bit of hazy bright golden yellow with a quickly disappearing pure white and tightly packed bubbly head that is gone completly in a minute or two. Carbonation is quite noticeable as little chains of it bubble up from the sides of the glass. It looks good but not great just sitting in the glass with a certain kind of quiet dignity.
S: As soon as I popped the cork on this bottle I could get a whiff of the wonderful blend of oak and earthy lemon pepper sourness. Lemon, sour cherry, oak and white pepper all work together quite nicely to create a very appealing aroma.
T/MF: This beer is knock your socks off sour like a handfull of those candy warheads. This is not to say the beer isn't complex as there seems to be quite a lot going on in the taste department. The woodiness of the beer is very noticable as well as unripe pear, sour apple and lemon, white grape skins as well as a good amount of sharp white cheddar. Mouthfeel is quite thick for a beer this size and feels on the heavier side of medium bodied though I imagine this is due to the fact that the beer just leaves the tongue ravaged in a sour wake, that is, though the beer may be gone it certainly still feels as though its sitting on the sides of your tongue.
D: While this beer had some amazing qualities in both the aroma and taste departments it is just too sour to be supremely drinkable. After every sip if was burping and could feel the sourness collecting at the base of my throat, I drank this beer for over and hour and can easily say that one is enough even though it tastes quite good. 1,697 charactersbluemoonswoon, Aug 26, 2008

It is a bright orange, somewhat hazy brew with a rather small white head that shows modest retention and lacing. 
Aroma is dominated by tart, acidic notes; some of that expected leathery funkiness, but faint; oakiness is also subtle, although increases as it warms up. 
This is dry, very tart and acidic, with little to no accompanying sweet notes. Fruity, citric notes come in, but the tartness just about overwhelms everything else. 
Lacking complexity and balance to some extent, but still a very pleasant beer. 637 charactersbrdc, Aug 24, 2008

Peach aroma, with a fairly strong sourness and a bit of oak. Nice to the nose.
Tastes of peach juice, funk, sourness, orange rind and oak. Quite a nice mix. Sourness strong but not the strongest I've had from this brewery.
Light bodied but not watery, though at moments it has a very wet feel to it. Fairly well carbonated.
A sipper, but not the slowest beer to drink. I must say I wasn't disappointed by the wild ales I've had from Russian River. 551 characterselricorico, Aug 11, 2008

A: Pours a clear blonde color with an orangish tint.
S: Light fruits such as pear and green apples, but most of all, a whole lot of sour funk.
T: The first flavors on the palate are that of fruits such as orange, pear, and green apples. Quite a bit of lemon as well. The finish is very tart, acidic, and sour. The aftertaste is very dry. Not near as much funk present in the taste as there is in the aroma. 
M: Very, very fine carbonation with a dry, mouth puckering mouthfeel. 
D: A very interesting beer that would pair very well with food. I think all of Russian River's wild ales do a lot better when paired with some food that the acid will balance out with. Not something I enjoy sitting around and sipping on it's own. 821 characterswilljschmidt, Aug 09, 2008

2.8/5  rDev -37.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Obviously, I do not understand sour beers (or the people who make them and drink them). I'm trying to learn to appreciate them, but a beer like this, it just defies imagination.
The beer pours a hazy, lemony honey color with decent head retention and lacing. The aroma of this beer is off the charts. I guess I get some lemon zest, but the beer is so tart smelling, and the barnyard funk so pronounced, I'm just amazed by what I smell. As odd as this beer smells, the flavors are just over the top. There is the lemon zest flavor, but I also get apple cider vinegar and just sour, sour, sour. Each sip has me grimacing in pain. The sour flavors aside, I will say the beer is pretty light on the palate with the abv. very well disguised. As for drinkability, the sour flavor is just overpowering and is nearly more then I can handle. 
Shared this bottle with 4 other people thank God, including a guy at the table next to me (Belmont Station cafe) drinking some gueuze. He was quite grateful, noting the Beatification was much better then his gueuze. Perhaps. I just wish I had the capacity to appreciate it as much as he did. 1,127 charactersJohn_M, Jul 27, 2008

Nice hazy golden color. Not much head, I get about one finger in my snifter but it fades quickly. Scent is sour with lemon and vinegar, and plenty of funk. Flavor is fantastic. Awesome sourness, again lemon and vinegar, but hints of other fruit jumped out as well. I noted peach and pear, if you can imagine what those would taste like long before they're ripe. Funk is prominent as well. Feel is medium bodied a somewhat syrupy. Carbonation is good, and a nice dry finish. A sipper but surprisingly easy to drink, really. Alcohol is subdued and doesn't carry much of a punch. Overall drinkability is quite high. I was worried that this would just be a sour bomb, but the flavor was really nice and complex. Maybe I'm just getting used to these sour beers...I dunno. I still liked Temptation more, but this is another fantastic effort from Vinny and the crew. 937 charactersrxdrewthejew, Jul 24, 2008

A: Golden, honey-colored pour with champagne-like bubbles. Thin, effervescent head layer faded quickly to a clear orange glassful. 
S: A light vineagar aroma. Sharp flora notes. Hints of pineapple and other sweet fruits.
T: Very sweet fruit flavors. Not so much citrus, but more tropical. Although, lighter grapefruitness is noticed. 
M: Puckering, but nothing that bucks your head back. Very smooth and almost refreshing. I was shocked and thought I would find this barrel-aged sour a bit more of a mouthful. This was not a terrible suprise, but just unexpected.

batch 002
 Looks like clover honey with an orange glow. 1" white frothy foam crowns and falls pretty fast with plenty of stickiness left over.
 Whoa, it's a nice, big aroma. I'm sitting at least two feet away from the glass and the breeze from outside is whaffing the aroma my way! Sweet and sour fruits, tangy grapes, mandarin oranges, sweet/tart candy, musty herbs.
 First impression: CRINGE!!!! major bitter-face. Unlike Temptation and Supplication the flavor of this wild bad-boy is just too funked-up for me, but only because of it's intense, medicinal and metallic bitter flavor that kills everything else. Tart/metallic/bitter that's about all I'm getting. Dissapointing to say the least, I really enjoyed the Other wild ales from these guys.
 The feel is light and crisp at first, then becomes much less lively pretty fast. Perhaps some oxidation has taken effect with this one? 934 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 14, 2008

Appearance: Pours a clear, yellow body with, well, no head. 
Smell: A sour-scented aroma smelling of sour ole lemons, white grapes, and grandpa's barnyard, all with a reasonably, understandably funky Brett component.
Taste: A sip of refreshing, oaky white wine and a bite of sharp cheese. Everpresent, underlying Bretty taste. Less a sour lemon taste and more of a taste of thick lemon rinds and a very puckering, almost grimacing wallop of acidity. Then a sip of a salty brine soak. Dry, sour finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body. No real carbonation present.
Drinkability: Quite good, though I'd appreciate just a teensy bit of carbonation. I'd go so far as to say I'd cheerfully drink this each and every damn day. But sadly I don't have easy access to Russian River beers. 791 charactersChainGangGuy, Jul 12, 2008

A: The ale has a hazy wheat ale color, more yellow than brown and resembling a still tea. There is little carbonation and no head save for a thin white band at the edge of the glass.
S: Mind-blowingly tart, this ale causes you to pucker up from the aroma only. Bright citrus and flowers emerge from the mix, as does an strong barnyard presence. The draw is so strong that despite the intensity, I can't take my nose out of the glass.
T: This beer is as gueuzey as it gets, thick with tart astringent flavors. Citrus flavors are quick to emerge from the tartness, with orange rind and grapefruit featured prominently. Sour apples run throughout as well. For the strength of the tartness, the body underlying it is quite delicate. The tartness last on the lips and palate for quite a while.
M: Fruit and horseblanket funkiness leave a lasting impression on the palate. This ale is as close to an authentic Belgian gueuze that I've ever come across.
D: At 5.5%, the ale is low key and light but the blast of flavor could impair your tastebuds. The ale is wonderful, great innovation from Russian River. 1,151 charactersakorsak, Jul 05, 2008

Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with carbonation bubbles making their way through the clouds. A thick foamy white head tops this off. Very slight lacing along the glass. This is a good looking blonde.
S: A wonderfully pungent nose on this beer. A smell that first struck me as sour fruits along with a floral background. I could sit here and smell this beer solely for a couple minutes, it's that pleasant. Very invigorating and inviting scent that helps compliment the appearance in making this a beer one can't help but want to taste.
T: The taste does not disappoint from the build-up from the other senses. The blonde ale within this is built up with the sour and combined in a way that works perfectly. Slight hop taste in the back end, but the sourness persists throughout. Fruits and floral make for a great beer.
F: Very very smooth. The sour is just right to compliment the rest of the taste. This beer has plenty of carbonation that will make your mouth come alive.
D: This is a wonderful beer. I could drink this beer at almost any time of the year. It's a very lively beer that goes down smooth and tastes delicious. 1,164 charactersScrumtralecent, Jul 02, 2008

This beer pours a lemony gold color in to my tulip. A column of micro-bubbles rise up from the dimple in the bottom. Be careful on the pour. One glass got a little of the dregs in it and it looked a lot more dull. 
Smells of raspberries, red grapefruit and a touch of banana with a strong emphasis on the tart aspects of these beers. There's a pleasant wild funk that permeates the entire nose. In the distance there's a clover honey and some wild flowers.
The flavor is predominantly funky tartness that reminds me of eating under-ripe crabapples as a kid. It picks up a flash of black pepper too along with ultra tart cherry and orange. It's hard to really articulate just how funky the funk is, but this one seemed to be a little more "in your face" and unbalanced that other Russian River beers.
Feels dense, but mysteriously vacant with only the slightest hint of tiny carbonation. This really helps the mouth deal with the funk.
A tasty wild ale, but not one of RR's best. 1,016 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Jun 25, 2008

Pours straw colored, slightly hazy, and with no head. The smell is quite funky with lots of lemon sourness and great barnyard aromas. The taste is super tart up front, followed by a splendid funkiness with loads of horseblanket character as well as a dose of minerality. Ripe soft cheese and lemon on the finish. Smooth, tart, refreshing in the mouth. Delicious and the real deal. I shared a bottle of this with brickstoredave, and his comment was "Wow, an American brewer made this beer?". My thoughts exactly. What an accomplishment and one more reason Russian River is my favorite American brewery. 681 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jun 19, 2008

Hazy pale lemon yellow edges around a golden center. Small, tight, off-white head. Decent lacing. Nose is tart with plenty of acidity. Citrus (grapefruit, lemon), hay, horse blanket, some powdered sugar sweetness, and a bit of wood. Great complexity.
Starts off refreshingly tart. Grapefruit and lemon citrus flavors flesh out the palate. Very acidic and dry. Earthy, musty edge to all the fruity sourness. Hints of hay and oak. Finish is incredibly dry with lingering grapefruit sourness. Moderate body with an almost sticky feel. Deliciously tart and earthy and refreshing! 603 charactersalexgash, Jun 15, 2008

Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1/4" bright white head over the totally cloudy golden brew. Head recedes to an uneven layer of bubbles, with ample small-bubbled lace. Aroma is tart bubblegum. Taste starts with a moderate tartness throughout the mouth, coupled with a light sweetness. Then the real character appears, piercing citric character, which rounds out at the close. Mouthfeel is silky soft and dry, and drinkability is impressive. A refreshing on a warm evening, for sure. 602 charactersppoitras, Jun 14, 2008

Slightly hazy, dark yellow-light golden color. Modest, white head. No legs, some lacing. Cork eased out of the bottle with a gentle phht!
Scent was sour! Touch of vinegar. Fruit -- sour apples, vitamin C. Some funkiness/earthiness. Cellar smell.
Taste was SOUR. Acetic acid, vitamin C again. Grapefruit juice comes to mind, lingers in a big way. Lemon juice.
Light to medium body. Low carbonation, expected higher. Very dry, approaching puckering.
Alas, if this is one of the best of the bunch for sours, I'm probably never going to be a big fan. Enjoyed Temptation and Supplication much more. I must say that it nails the description on the bottle and for the style. 713 characters, Jun 13, 2008

Head doesn't last very long, and leaves little lacing behind. Smells of Brett, green apples, lemon zest, cantaloupe, and vinegar. Taste starts out good and tart with plenty of green apples, lemon, and vinegar. Brett funk makes itself known as does notes of vanilla, but it never gets the sourness of some of the other RR Wild Ales, remaining tart and funky. Light in body with good fizzy champagne-like carbonation and lots of tartness and funk. Another extraordinary -ication from Russian River that is light, lower in alcohol, and packed with unique flavors. 633 charactersHopDerek, Jun 10, 2008

A- Rich golden, clear, no head builds up at all.
S- Very sour. You know it will be puckering by the aroma.
T- Intensely sour. We had this right after Temptation, Sanctification, and Supplication and all got blown out of the water by Beatification's sourness. Trying to search deeper is hard (for me) but maybe that pear/apricot type fruit taste (light a faint, light mellow sugar).
M/D- starts off pretty spritzy but the carbonation is worked out of the beer pretty fast. Comparing this to Cantillon Gueuze I would have to say Beatification is a bit more sour and overall slightly more interesting.

Appearance: It's hazy and a very light straw color. Maybe a touch of orange to it. Minute amount of sediment can be seen lurking around. Head is foamy white and a modest one finger. It receded quicly and left a very light lacing on the glass.
Smell: No doubt this is a very tart smelling beer. I can almost taste the sourness already. Due to the use of Brett, it certainly has a bit of barnyard funkiness going on. But, it's a little subdued and nicely done. There's a very light fruity aroma that smells mostly of grape. It's a little earthy and grainy. Nice and complex. 
Taste: The flavor really delivers when comes to being tart and sour. The nose was a spot-on representation of the taste. It's not so aggressive that it's mouth puckering, but it's very tart and sour. It certainly has a citrusy aspect. Lemon and grapefruit flavors are sweet and really contribute to the strong tart taste. There's a nice grainy flavor and a wood-like taste that appear toward the finish. I can only surmise the wood flavor is attributable to the barrel aging. Finishes sour and very, very dry.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied and very dry. It's really drying out my palate. Carbonation is lighter than expected, but well done. It's got an incredibly smooth feel and is very drinkable. At 5.5%, abv is very modest and if you're into sours, this could be consumed in mass quantities. 
I've been waiting to try Beatification for a while and it truly delivers. I don't really know how to characterize this beer. It's art in a bottle. Everything about it is just so artfully crafted. I can't constructively criticize any aspect of this beer. I'm not convinced it can be any more well done than this. Coming from one who's not the biggest of sour fans, that's a huge compliment. Highly recommended. 1,808 charactersprototypic, Jun 09, 2008

It pours a nice pale blonde color with very little head despite a fairly aggressive pour. There is some suspended yeast, as it is not perfectly clear, and the limited carbonation rising up is made up of very tiny bubbles. The aroma is far smoother than I expected it to be. There is the brett funkiness and tartness there, but it isn't as powerful as the other RR sours. There are some light fruity undertones of grapes, melon, and definitely some green apple. The malts are not easy to identify, but there is some light breadiness. 
Upon the first sip, I realized that the aroma was misleading. It is very sour. The brett did it's job giving it that distinct sourness it loves to provide us with. Once the sourness subdues, there are definitely those fruity notes, giving it very much a wine-like quality. The green apple really shines along with some melon. The finish is sweeter than I expected it to be and lingers on nicely. As it warms the sourness subsides and the fruitiness comes out more, along with hints of bready malts and oak. it's very nice how this one transforms. The mouthfeel is light and with just a little carbonation. Overall, this is one excellent wild ale. Probably the best I've had. 1,236 charactersASymon13, Jun 08, 2008

Batch 002
Courtesy of errantnight, thanks Derek! Beatification pours a murky, pale straw yellow with a minimal head. The clean white head grew to a finger but fell rather quickly to a ring around the glass. Random carbonation bubbles rise here and there to the minimal head. I would have liked to see a better head on this beer. It's almost nonexistent after it settles and swirls won't even bring it forward.
The smell makes my mouth water immediately. A big hit of brett sourness right off the bat. Damp hay and earth are the first things I pick up, a bit of vinegar shows up half way through and becomes the dominant figure before being joined by a slight damp oakiness. Although the swirls don't produce any head they do release enough carbonation to bring forward a peppery peachiness that only stays for a short time. Good depth with a great tart note.
Beatification will make you pucker. The puckering tartness hits immediately but calms down mid-palate. As this beer warms the flavors really start coming together nicely. The sourness shows signs of vinegar throughout but there's a good deal of pepper and stone fruits. Not as much earthiness as the nose suggested but it is present. At first this was simply a decent beer, after more warming it becomes very tasty and much more flavor sneaks through the sourness.
The mouthfeel is a bit of a let down; I expected more carbonation and that light airy feel. The lack of carbonation leaves the mouthfeel a little heavier then expected. The body is medium and leaves a slight stick on the finish. Causes a nice pucker and makes my mouth water but I would like a bit more dryness. Just me being picky again I suppose.
Very easy drinking. The tartness leaves your mouth watering for another drink as soon as you swallow the last. It feels like I've been drinking this slowly but I look at my glass and it's about gone.
A solid beer from Russian River. Not one of my favorites but all the flavor is there. Seems to me like a better carbonated brew would take care of most problems. I can't wait to see what a couple years will do to these bottles

Hazy straw gold colour with a thin, whitish cap of fine bubbles that quickly settled to a thin collar. Short-lived, spotty stickage. Super funky aroma, salty and tart with lots of brett and barnyard character. Some vinegar and a bit of fruitiness added a lot of depth too. Leather and oak/wood appeared as it warmed. Fruity, sour and tart up front, sort of a berry quality, with a vinegar and salt flavour following close behind. Plenty of earthy funk, but not overpowering, plus a nice dose of oak. Puckering by the finish with lingering fruity tartness. Light bodied with lively carbonation, bordering on sharp. Oaky dryness too. Delicious! These wild ales are truly a work of art and this one didn't disappoint. I'm glad I have a couple more of these so I can see how they develop over time. 811 charactersDrJay, May 26, 2008

I opened this one very carefully over the sink and there was no explosion like I experienced with Supplication. The first sniff from the bottle is sour juiciness. The color is white-yellow with some sudsy bubbles. More sour juicy smell with a hint of musty funky acrid sweat. Dusty basement smells also. Brutal yet beautifully sour taste like lemonheads candy. Citrus lemon is mostly what I taste in addition to the sourness and some acidity. Overall, this is really awesome if you like sours. This also has more funkiness to it than the supplication I had a couple days ago. I thought the supplication was better.
update 02/28/09 batch 002
really reminds me of gueuze, cheesy, funky aroma, puckering lemon juice sourness that contorts my face! Excellent beer and has aged well over the last year or so since release.

Smells quite gueuzy with just a whiff of funk at first that seems to grow as it really warms. Not nearly as sour as batch 002 but still juicy and has a bit of sourness to it and the promised hint of grapefruit. Really easy to drink, smooth and delicious but a little subdued compared to the previous batch. I hope to buy more "sonambics" from this brewery. 1,254 charactersArrogantB, May 24, 2008

Poured into a chimay goblet- light golden color with a decent amount of haze at first, even though poured slowly like it says on bottle. Then pretty clear with a thin white, wispy head. Aroma is pungent to say the least. I get numerous different smells from this baby! First- some banana, thensome sour apple, then some earthy, funky sweaty aromas and then finally some wet leather or similar smell. I can not believe the aromas from this beer- I want to smell it more than drink it.... for a minute. I actually can smell the beer from across the room. 
Taste is just as complex. At first I get a champagne like- tart, crisp flavor. Then the flavor sits on your toungue for a bit. I get the sour after that. sour fruits- especially apples. Amazing aftertaste lingers. Crisp, tart mouthfeel. I find it pretty drinkable for a sour, as I am pretty upset when I finish this beer- I can not wait to try the others from the RR wilds release! 1,003 charactersDrDogbeer, May 24, 2008

Appearance- Pours a light golden yellow with excellent clarity and a small bright white half finger head that quickly dissipates. The cap and collar are almost non-existent after a few minutes and not a trace of lacing is left.
Smell- Sour and tart with that delicious funk that I've come to love. The Brett has done its job on this one, the sharpest nose I've smelled other than Compunction. Lightly sour green apple, light melon and even some lemon zest are more than present. The oak hasn't seemed to affect the nose much although it is fairly pungent and might be hiding somewhere in the background.
Taste- Very tart and vinegary with a very puckering green apple bite right from the start. Plenty of citrus and lemon are the dominating tastes along with the Brett (obviously). The oak is very light and subtle but it is indeed present leaving a light vanilla that is noticeable after the sour fades. The funk is as subtle as the oak but still present. Musty and quenching through the finish with a lingering dirtiness that I don't enjoy as much as the rest of the beer.
Mouthfeel- Light and puckering with a very crisp bite and aggressive, champagne like carbonation.
Drinkability- Considering the sourness of this beer it's still amazing to me that something could be so tasty and drinkable. Although this one is (IMHO) "the least best" of the "new 3" batches of the aged Russian River brews, it's still really good. It's not as drinkable and nice as Temptation and not as unique and complex as Supplication but I suppose that's not the point. Big thanks to Matt for the help on these! 1,793 charactersyounger35, May 23, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 002. Corked & caged bottle 375 ml bottle into a Russian River Barrel-Aged Beer Tulip glass. A very classy presentation (as always) from Russian River. 
Pours a hazy light orange (with almost a golden sheen to it)and a thin head of brite-white foam that left a smattering of lace behind. There is still a good bit of carbonation release well after the pour that keeps the retention firm for a good while, which is a credit to the conditioning of this. As a matter of fact, things don't slow down until about half way through the glass and then it went immediately still. It was a pretty cool to see the contrast in the body between when it was poured and when I finished the glass. The aroma is straight up fresh funky Brett, that gives off a tingling, pleasant pungency. There is also a fairly prominent sensation of sour fruits (like apples) behind all the funk. 
The taste profile initially starts out with a fresh tasting crip blast of Brett tartness. What I love about this, is that never gets to the point of being sour. It takes things right to the threshold but brilliantly knows right when to pull back to keep things at a tart bite. And then what I REALLY love about this beer is that as it warms, the tartness melds with the sour fruit notes (that have been lingering in the background)to achieve a flavor not unlike a Sweet Tart of Sour Apple Jolly Ranger. Complete with an almost sugary sweetness that is felt in the finish along with a lingering tartness. The mouthfeel is fantastic, being medium bodied with a crisp feel yet dry finish and is smooth across the palette. 
This Wild Ale really is out-freaking-standing and remains a spontaneously fermented work of art. Jammed packed with all the tartness and funk that you would expect from a beer like this but it is never overbearing and retains a fantastic drinkibility. God bless Vinnie and Russian River for beers like this! 1,901 charactersKegatron, May 22, 2008

Clear yellow, with a fizzy white head.
Aromas of funk, sour green apple, lemon zest & tart horse stables
Holy sour...serious pucker on my 1st sip. Felt it in both sides of my jaw. Super sour...green apple explosion. Right on the tip of the tongue...funk felt in the back. Glands are now salivating...very acidic. Head has now dissolved, leaving no evidence.
As the beer warmed, the sour-tart-funk was less explosive, but still very present. Oaky tartness with a dash of brett in the mouthfeel.
Oak felt in the finish...very unassuming. Dry, lemony, sour tart sparkling wine also felt in the finish.
I did not know what to expect with this one. For a beer aged 9-19 months in oak, very surprised that oak didn't dominate the flavor. 797 charactersRustyDiamond, May 18, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5well, its been a long time since i've written a review, but as i'm sitting here with a snifter full of warming beatification, i thought i'd give it a shot. let's see if i remember how to do this...
i got this bottle, along with temptation and supplication, from the recent RRB release, and i've got to say that this is the funkiest, sourest, most surprising beer i've had in a long time. to be honest, i thought i had a bad bottle for a moment - the cork barely popped and didn't look like it had expanded in the bottle very much. upon pouring the light-apple-cider colored liquid into my snifter, i didn't see much of a lasting head and i got the decidedly odd smell of, well, animal sweat. i don't really know how else to describe it, except maybe as the rind of a cheese that the french would call "fromage qui pue." tasting this beer at fridge temperature was also very, very weird. almost painfully like vinegar. my eyes watered a bit. but how can this be the famed beatification? is it infected? well, of course its infected, it says so on the bottle! so i let it sit in my hand for a bit, the snifter resting at an angle in my palm, allowing the beer to warm. and warm it did! now i get so much more off the nose - sour cherry, almost kumquat, a bunch of lemon rind, and a dash of white pepper. the taste has also developed much - also kumquats, brett funk, citric acid, and just a touch of the original malt sweetness that has been feasted upon by tons of little "bugs and critters." cool! the mouthfeel is perfectly round in the first sip and slowly astringent in the finish, leaving me with a mild woodiness before the taste disappears. wonderful.
i've left the yeast/critters in the bottle, but plan on drinking that soon. excuse me if i cut out now - i'd like to savor the last few sips of my original pour before i dump in the haziness. 1,851 charactersisaac, May 14, 2008

Pours a hazy yellow/orange with a stark white head. Nose is tart brett funk and some light fruitiness. Taste follows with awesome brett funkiness and super tart green apple flavors. underlying wood flavor is good and lingers quite a bit along with the green appley tartness. Nice Geuezy flavor also. very complex. Mouthfeel is nice and crisp, good carbonation, and a nice viscosity for the style. Drinkability is unbeatable for the style. This is one of few sour beers I could see myself drinking more than one of. Excited to see how this one cellars. Fantastic concoction by Vinnie and the crew. Great beer. 643 charactersAKBelgianBeast, May 10, 2008
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5If only I had the same kind of access to the Russian River beers as I do to the Lost Abbey. If even they were even a little further away. A four hour drive. A five hour drive. Each and every one of the Russian River beers had something to fucking say. The Beatification of all had the most intense things to say, just extremely funky and flowery on the nose. When I popped it open it smelled like diapers or something, heavily stank cheese, I screamed, I passed it around, I got stoked. This was the overall champion of the night for me by a long shot, part of a very small (4 people) Russian River tasting. Beatification is a barrel aged and "spontaneously fermented" beer, brewed with wild yeast and then aged in barrels which have been used for both its original purpose and for making other beers that Russian River offers, meaning that it has a whole lot of life in the wood that contributes an insane amount of complex flavor to the beer. This beer has a list of the known yeast and bacteria strains present in the beer, which beyond being geeky is so insane that you can't just love it if you're interested in the science and alchemy of brewing. Poured beautifully from the mini-Champagne like bottle with a cork and cage and it really is like an intense spoiled semi-brute Champagne that could only come from Belgium, except that it's from California. Infected, golden, attractive. Russian River makes the beers that are closest to those from the motherland, with the perfect amount of American screw-all attitude to boot. This is so much like a Gueuze that it's hard to believe it's not, and it's in the same family as the Leelanau and Jolly Pumpkin beers which are so overtly "out there" that you can't help but listen up. Highest, highest respect for this brew, heavy dog compliments. 1,795 charactersbrewdogmrb, May 09, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Tasted towards the end of the Tampa BA gathering 5/3/08 - what a wonderful way to cleanse the palate from an afternoon of good beer...
Pours a cloudly yellow with a small head that drops quickly. Aroma is of sourness, sour fruit, dirty diaper, even light ammonia. Flavor offers a very sour but complex profile - hard to seperate it from mouthfeel. Elements of grapefuit and lemon show among the funk. Tart, acidic, cleansing, but flavorful.
Overall, an excellent sour ale, a must-try for those who really like this style. Not something I'd want to drink everyday but it offers a textbook example of the unique complexity to be had form these barrel-aged sour beers. 667 charactersmarksto, May 08, 2008
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Yeah.... that's gooood.
A nice pale straw with just wisps of carbonation that form a thin, and transitory head. Hazy.
Aroma is a sweet pile of brett-y funk. Some fruits, melon and citrus are present, sourness in the nose as well. Complex, a little musty.
The flavor is a whopping blast of sharp sourness, which maintains all the way through, and then lingers tenaciously on the tongue. It seems very pedio-centric, that is, a very clean and bright sour character, Sweet Tarts and whatnot. Mid palate sweetness, pineapple and bubblegum notes. It's delicious, but not as complex as the other RR barrel aged brews I've had... but it's tasty. Would love to try this side-by-side with some of the classic Belgian geueze's which this mose resembles.
It's awesome that we've got an American brewer making strides like this with sour, barrel-aged brews. But you knew that. 868 characterserrantnight, May 07, 2008

a - pours a very hazy honey color, one-finger white head, retention around the edges, moderate lacing, good for a sour ale
s - sour apple and intense barnyard funk, notes of cucumber strangely, light citrus, grapefruit and lemon
t - sour apple and white grape up front which quickly develops into an intense sourness that engulfs the whole palate, huge amount of brett funkiness and hints of grapefruit, lemon and orange on the mid-palate, more citrus and green apple on the finish along with lingering funk and notes of oak and leather, as it warms, the lemon becomes more pronounced, in one word: Awesome!
m - medium-bodied, lots of carbonation, very active in the mouth, moderately dry on the finish, very sour but easy on the palate at the same time, perfect mix of body and carbonation for the style
d - while this is certainly an intense beer, the complexities and refreshing nature keep you drinking, very sour yet easy on the palate, damn, I wish this came in 750s
I've wanted to try this beer for well over a year-and-a-half, and I have to say, it was well worth the wait. One of the best beers I've ever had. I couldn't think of a better special occasion beer. I need to get some more bottles of this asap! 1,347 charactersWeisGuy, May 06, 2008
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4HUGE thanks to prototypic for this special treat.
375 ml cork and caged bottle poured into a tulip glass. Batch 002.
Pours a foggy toasted gold with a thin half finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. No lacing at all with this one. Swirling the glass leaves some webs, but they quickly fall back down seconds after. Smell is heavy on the funk, go figure! Sour cherries, white grapes, brett, lemongrass, and oak. After a big whiff, the vinegar becomes present, but doesn't overpower any of the other wonderful complex aromas. Taste begins very tart and sour followed by the smooth oak, sweet tangerine and green apples. Aftertaste is a bit dry with sour grapefruit, some honey, and wood characteristics. So much flavor for such a low abv beer. Light to medium body with a stinging carbonation. Beatification is by far the most sour of the RR brews that I've had, maybe too sour? I'd take Supplication and Sanctification over this, but Beatification is still an amazing beer. Hopefully I can get my hands on another bottle so I can throw it in the cellar. Thanks again Josh for hooking me up!! 1,118 charactersBeerTruth, May 06, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, what can I say about this, I have been waiting to try this one for what seems like forever. Almost impossible to get a bottle of Batch 001, so I just waited it out and received my Batch 002 supply yesterday. Wasting no time at all I threw one in the fridge and let it chill down to a respectable temperature before pulling it out at about 9:00pm last night. The 375,l corked and caged bottle looked wonderful and I practically started drooling before I could even get it open. Needless to say I grabbed the closest snifter I could and found my new Belgium one and slowly poured the contents inside....
Appearance - A slow pour, being careful not to disturb the sediment left the most hazy golden, amber colored liquid imaginable. No head at all on this, well minimal at best with just a slight quarter inch layer of white coming across the top, good news was that it never did get any lower then that. Great side glass presentation on this one as nice silky smooth looking, cascading layers of white fizz, almost looking like sea spray just swirled around the sides of the glass. Some light carbonation could be seen coming up from the bottom throughout the session. As would be expected there was a bit of yeast sitting at the bottom of the glass after it settled. I was impressed but what would happen next would be off the chart....
Smell - The aroma was simply to die for. I love me some Brett, but this was literally taking it to a whole new level. I knew this would be nice, but my wife chuckled as I sat there for an hour sniffing this, as if...well you could imagine. Just the most grand, funkified, tart, sour, vinegar like smell you could come across, but in a good way. Rich and complex there seemed to literally be no end in sight for the depth of this one. Towards then end of the session, I may have just gotten used to the funky sour Brett, when I noticed some light fruit maybe coming into play, this was like a fine wine almost in aroma, I mean just insanely good. I am almost speechless, but I had to eventually stop smelling it and actually try it....
Taste - If I thought it smelled good, I do not even know how to put into words the flavor of this one. It was just wonderful. Started out with a full on assault of sour, Brett funk, that rolled through the mouth, sucking up and puckering anything that it came in contact with, but once it got past, it opened you up to a whole world of woody flavors that were hidden underneath. There was some light fruitiness of some sour, perhaps grapes, or green apples, that you could start to pick up as it rolled along, and there was a touch of sweetness there as well. This was not entirely unbalanced, far from it. In fact I think if you do not let this one warm up a bit, you are really cheating yourself out of how good it could be. It was remarkable in hour tart it was but just how well it blended. The finishing notes were really starting to show hints of the barrel aging, with nice wood notes coming through and it really getting a nice earthy feel to it.
Mouthfeel - Such a wonderfully rich and complex taste, would be nothing without the accompanying good feel. And, this one did not disappoint in any way. Nice medium bodied ale, there was more then adequate carbonation put through on this one. It never did get flat, or dull in any way, in fact it seemed to get better as the session wore on. Silky smooth in its consistency, I was in love with this one right away.
Drinkability - In a word it was outstanding, the flavors were so rich and complex that I literally could not stop sipping on this one if I tried. The feel so delicate and smooth that I literally just let it sit there and roll around to absorb the most out of it that I could. This was truly remarkable in every possible way.
Overall I was simply blown away by this one. It was easily the best sour ale I have ever had, and easily one of the best beers I have ever had hands down. I can now see why people rave about this one as much as they do, it really is that good. It has a light texture to it that is unmatched, and the Brett, is just perfect. Go out and get this if you are a fan of the style, if its not your thing, and you do not like the style, you are not going to like this, it's the epitome of the style. Simply astounding. 4,287 charactersmikesgroove, May 05, 2008

Batch 002
A: Pours a hazy, glowing, gold color with a small and quite bubbly head that recedes all too fast. The head melts down to a whispy skim and bubbly ring that leaves a hand full of small lacy spots.
S: The first whiff is of vinegar. As my nose became accustomed to the sourness I began to pick up notes of tart citrus, oak, and brett funk.
T: Tart and sour! As the shock to the tongue began to wear off I noticed subtle nuances of citrus (both sweet and sour), earthy hops, oak, and at the finish, some toasted malt.
M: Tart and pucker inducing. I kept running my tongue around the inside of my mouth to make sure none of the sourness went to waste.
S: Pretty damn amazing. I'm constantly amazed at my palates' ability to evolve. A year and a half ago I would've sworn this was spoiled. Now, I'm loving the sour beers! 946 charactersGbVDave, Apr 29, 2008

A - golden and dense, a bit like honey. a bit of bubbles form at the top once it's poured but there is really not much of a head to speak of.
S - lots of vinegar and oak. 
T - not as sour as i expected, but it's got a wonderful flavor. the brett is predominant and you can definitely taste the oak. not much in the way of fruit in this one, but you can taste some of the alcohol at the end.
M - champagne-like tight carbonation.

Batch #002
Pours a bright gold color, with slight haze, a light white head, and obvious carbonation.
Aromas are strong, and very pleasant. This was easily to smell right when the cork popped. Aromas are of citrus, mostly lemons, some dust, yeast, spice, and a floral quality. Definite funk.
Tastes is incredibly tart and sour. I am puckering just thinking about the first sip. A very dry citrus lemon flavor with some funky yeast spices and a touch of oak. Finish is crisp, with a nice hint of creamy malt flavors. 
Mouthfeel is great. Very clean, nicely carbonated, with a nice thick feel up front.
Drinkability is good. This is a beer I have wanted to try for quite some time now. Incredibly interesting and unique tasting. But one bottle is easily more than enough. I probably should have waited to share this bottle with someone. I really like this, but I prefer Sanctification, Compunction, and Temptation to this one. I just found those to be easier to drink. That's not to slight this one at all... Beatification is another Russian River home run. 1,131 charactersflexabull, Apr 25, 2008

I smell cherry and oak and citrus. The yeast burns my nose.
Taste is sour/sweet at the same time. There is a darkness to the aftertaste. It is bitter sweet like a persimmon fruit.
Mouthfeel is so darn clean. Nothing is left in the palate. We had cheese and mushrooms, this cleaned the mouth right up. I wish it would be more redily available. Petrus rates way below this one. 473 characterspeabody, Apr 24, 2008

Batch 2
A- Pours a cloudy peach color with little to no head.
S- Mostly all brett, some funky sour tones along with some barnyard funk.
T- By far the most sour of the recently released RR sours. Starts of with a strong sourness which subsides and brings forth apples and citrus notes followed by a bit of grape.
M- Medium viscosity, not a lot of carbonation.
D- My least favorite of the RR sours but still a good beer thats worth trying. 454 charactersLothore, Apr 19, 2008

A: Very cloudy, yellow/straw color. Small ring of small bubbles. Not much head there.
S: Not much aroma surprisingly. There's some funk/acidity and some apple aromas. Also some funky spicy and "barnyard" brett character.
T: Heavy on the Brettanomyces/wild yeast. It's sour for sure. There is some malt in the background and there seems to be some hop bitterness. Bitterness could also be some slight spicy yeast character. Interesting. I like it.
M: Dry, lively. Great carbonation for the beer.
D: Very drinkable for the style I suppose. I'm not sure I'd have two, but it is refreshing. It's not as clean as many lambics, but it tastes good. 675 charactersTheEremite, Apr 14, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 2. Pours a completely opaque goldenrod color into a tulip glass. Half a finger of head forms but dissolves into a ring quickly due to the acidity.
Aroma is so sour I almost shudder after whiffing. Acetic but with a faint candied sweetness just barely detectable. Maybe that's all I can smell anymore after having my nose hairs singed off with tart funk.
First sip aaaand... WOW that is sour. My eye literally twitched after swallowing. The sourness tastes like grapefruit rind soaked in lemon juice. Easily sourer than any gueuze I've had. Also a lot of wood here for added complexity. Wood and rind linger on the palate and lips for what seems like hours.
Same perfect mouthfeel I've come to expect from RR. Carbonation is exceptional, finish is long yet dry, and drinkability is through the roof for a sour beer lover, like me. 838 charactersillidurit, Apr 12, 2008
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Another splendid sour ale wild ale from Russian River. I was expecting this to be similar to Temptation (which I tried last night), but it ended up being quite different.
Pours a brilliant golden color. Thin white crust, no real head. It has the characteristic champagne bubbles, but decidedly less so than Temptation. As a result, the mouthfeel was a bit more flat ... unfortunately less appealing (for me, at least).
The smell indicated that the funk level was going to be raised insanely high. Vinegar, overwhelming tartness, and wood/oak tones abounded in the aroma. The taste was explosively sour. The wood/oak flavoring was gigantic, far more so than La Folie's Wood Aged Beer, which is the closest I can think of in terms of sour woodsy flavoring. Vinegar, tartness, and young sour citrus abound. While the flavor is definitely complex, it can be a bit more one-note than Temptation as the session progresses.
I see that folks mention lighter fruits such as sour cherries, raspberries, etc. I'm not getting much of that. If those were added, I guess the "Brett" character is pummeling them.
Definitely demands a lot of your palate. Delicious. 1,153 charactersOverlord, Apr 12, 2008
3.02/5  rDev -32.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3Huge fan of Russian River and tasted many of the 'ation' series years ago at Toronado. At that point it seemed that many of the barrel aged (chardonnay, pinot, etc) beers were clearly going to find a foothold. Thankfully for us, they have and are getting better and better.
My local shop has carried as many bottled 'ations' as he can get his hands on and I was happy to spend $12 for an 002 batch of Beatification. In the case of this one, it felt extremely sour for sour's sake. Each sip reminded me of biting in to a Zot in elementary school. So rough and so compelling at the same time, like staring at a car accident.
I'm happy to have had this experience and will enjoy watching others try it. I will probably wait for the next 'ation' though. 751 charactersBenway, Apr 11, 2008

Pours a faintly hazed yellowish color with light whitish head. Smell is bright, lightly funky and sour, yet soft overall. Taste is much of the same mild tartness, oaky dryness and very pleasant funkiness. Very easy to drink, now that I'm more accustomed to sours. This is really nice stuff, and very mild compared to some. 375 charactersJDV, Apr 06, 2008

I had something else in mind for my 200th review but it is warm today and my palate is asking for a break from all the double/imperial/barrel-aged strong ales I've been drinking so I decided to pop this beer instead.
This is from Batch 001.
Big pop once I was able to take the cork out. I'm glad this one is not a gusher like the Temptation I had not too long ago.
Pours a bright golden color with a touch of apple juice color. About an inch of foam quickly forms as this beer seems to be very effervescent, but it settles rather fast and leaves a white ring behind. 
Wow, the aroma is incredible. Tart cherries, apples, vinegar, pears, acidic strawberry, just a great combination of sour and tart fruits. It also has some vinous and faint oak aromas in the background. This beer made my mouth water. The funkiness is still there but it blends really well with the fruity aromas. Later on I pick up some orange, tangerine, and I believe the cherry becomes more pronounced. The pale malt is trying to peek through with some sweetness and hints of toast and caramel but it's easily overpowered by the vibrant and tart fruitiness. 
First taste is of some tart fruits and vinegar with a funky/brett finish and the pale malt also comes through in the finish. I'm starting to pick out the apples/apple skins, pears, strawberry, cherries and raspberries. The beer has a wonderful acidity level and at times I feel like I'm biting into a really sour green apple...yum! As it warms up the wood notes become more apparent and linger for a little bit in the finish.
The mouth-feel is light since it's only a 5.5% blond ale but it's still madly carbonated and goes well with the acidity. The carbonation is still aggressive on the tongue but surprisingly it finishes rather clean and almost velvety in the end. Sadly, this beer drinks rather fast since it's flavorful, refreshing and light...oh how I crave more beers like this! 
The finish is also dry but not an excessive dryness, just enough to make you want to take another sip soon.
And now I'm sad cause it's gone. Looking forward to the next batch coming in soon! 2,169 charactersseaoflament, Mar 25, 2008

Batch 001-PH1, aged in New Belgium La Folie barrels for 23 months, bottle says it can be aged for up to four additional years, poured into my Duvel tulip glass, bottle review #300
A-Medium orange with a slight red or pink tint when held up to the light, huge 1 1/4 inch head that aggressively bubbly, not much retention though, tons of little bubbles rushing to the top the whole time through, minimal retention
S-Funky sourness, nothing but tarty aromas, brettanomyces was pretty strong, wood chips, different citrus scents, oddly a bit of some kind of nuttiness, raspberries and cherries, balsamic vinegar, and some hints of malt
T-If this does not make you pucker then I do not know what will, amazing tarty taste that manages to stay smooth at the same time, sour cherries and brettanomyces right up front, lemon juice, earthy, grassy at times, seemed like there was some Belgian yeast, tangerines and grapefruit, coriander, orange peel and faint pepper flavors in the finish, not noticeably dry like most other Russian River wild ales, continued to get more complex as it warmed, sourness never got old, crazy how all this balanced out, fantastic flavor
M-Medium body, large amounts of carbonation that was a little much at the beginning, only complaint about this entire beer, taste lingered for a few minutes at a time, tarty sour mouthfeel
D-Could drink a half dozen of these at a sitting, so easy to drink and smooth, light on the stomach, alcohol can barely be tasted, only five percent anyways, one of the only true session wild ales, amazing drinkability
One of the best beers I have ever had, just slightly under Toronado 20th Anniversary Ale from this same brewer, which probably contained a good amount of this stuff in its blend, pretty much flawless in my opinion, will try to get a case of the next batch in a few months but this beer is in very high demand so I might be driving up north on its release date, I cannot recommend this beer enough, true masterpiece 2,099 charactersFloydster, Feb 11, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch PH1. Served in an Ommegang glass.
A: Brilliantly clear, highly carbonated amber body. There was an initially thick white head but it fell quickly leaving nothing on the sides of the glass but only a rim of head on the edge.
S: The La Folie influence on the aroma is overwhelming. I can immediately recognize it. The aroma is nice and tart with some citrus notes. VERY inviting.
T: Damn, I love wild ales and this one is outstanding. Very pronounced tartness but it still manages to be smooth. Great pucker effect. The flavor has an earthy note typical of Brett. There are also some sour cherries lurking in the background. This is really a top notch beer. Brew this again Russian River!!
M: The carbonation is great on this and gives it a great mouthfeel. It takes what would otherwise be a pretty light bodied beer up a notch or two and gives it enough body to last.
D: Outstanding. Perfect. Top notch. Insert any other compliments you can think of. Especially when you consider that it is only 5.5% ABV, the drinkability on this is out of the park. This is by far my favorite RR beer and certainly one of the best beers I have had.
Edit: When you drink this beer, pour the yeast into the last sip. It is excellent. 1,228 charactersdrseamus, Dec 02, 2007

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had this beer quite a few times now in various different stages of it's development. At first from a wooden cask via a wine thief at the brewery. Than a test batch flowing at some god-forsaken beer festival. And finally in it's bottled form, in both the PH1, and 'regular' 001 editions. This beer pours a slightly hazy light golden colour with a large, tight, and compact head of foam that slowly loosend up, expands, and releases the aromas of this magnificent 'neo lambic' creation. This beer has the classic sharp, acidic, traditional lambic aromas that I adore. Balsamic vinegar, cheese, fresh white winter truffles, morbier dipped in lemon juice, etc. A very vinous and lactic sourness is also detectable, moreso in the darker tinged PH1 batch, than the straight 001, I should add. The taste is pungent and acidic with a wonderful fruity wine-like middle that smooths out the 'in-your-face-nature' of this brew and leaves you with a lovely aftertaste on the front and back of your tongue. The mouthfeel is creamy, super smooth, and reminiscent of the Cantillon St. Lamvinus. The drinkability is perfect and this super sour funky american neo lambic is definately one of the most coercive and notion challening brews to ever have passed this BAS' lips. Bravo to Vinnie and Co. For making something truly magical on all levels. 1,335 charactersfrancisweizen, Nov 16, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is the Batch 001-PH1 version, also held for more than a year.
It pours from 375ml caged and corked bottle a very effervescent clear light gold with a large head of foam that quickly shrinks to about a 1 finger head but doesn't shrink much more than that.
The smell is sour dominated but I also get notes of citrus, yeast, and some malt. Dang. I could smell this one for almost forever but on to the tasting...
The taste, like the nose, is dominated by this wonderful sourness that completely has my palate at attention and craving for more. More sips in and it starts to get more complex. Huge funk to be found here along with a healthy malt presence in the background and some very tasty pepper, coriander, and more spices than I can identify and the fruity flavours of orange, apricot, and peach make my mouth pucker a bit but damn they are tasty. Also, the second pour gives me some sediment to give it a cloudy and more orange appearance(why would I leave the fine sediment in the bottle as the label suggests????) and the foam "talks" to me not unlike a bowl of Rice Krispies.;^)
It has a medium mouthfeel to it and the carbonation is also medium inspite of what I saw in the initial pour. It finishes sour and leaves a nice long tasty aftertaste. Man, am I wild about RR American Wild Ales and to me, this one goes just a bit over the top compared to the non PH1 sample. I'm *really* digging this beer and boy, I get this all in a 5.5%abv brew...The drinkability just shoots through the roof!!
Bottom line: This may be my favourite offering from RR to date and I've had a fair sampling...all were, imho, outstanding. I still say RR may be the best brewery in America. Beatification is another brew that does them proud! Highly highly recommended!! 1,763 charactersBitterbill, Nov 10, 2007

My gf had a glass too and I got a lot of samples and poured them on top of each other and let them warm. I had to review on my cell phone so I didn't get a whole fuck load of notes.
This beer has a crazy funkiness. Sort of like a belgian sour. Sort of citrusy undertones. I did not get the best notes on this beer, but I have to write these notes so that I am sure to have this beer again. My first wild ale. I love this.
This beer was superb, sorry I don't have more notes on the flavor characteristics, but I have to write what I have down so I don't forget that I must buy this by the case in california when I visit. 743 charactersjasonjlewis, Oct 15, 2007
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I shared this brew with a couple of my non-BA friends at a party. They all said it tasted like champagne. It was a hit and a lot of them were amazed that it was actually a beer.
Poured a clear light amber color with a thick one inch white foamy head.
Aromas were out of this world. Incredible funky, earthy, horseblanket, wood aromas. Musty.
Tastes of lemon and other citrusy characteristics. Also moldy, musty, funky yeast and some light sweet maltiness.
Mouthfeel is incredibly light and has a nice tingly carbonation to it. 530 charactersBillyB, Oct 08, 2007
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Originally reviewed March 31, 2007. Pizza Port Belgian Beer Fest. Pour from a 375mL. Fresh Meyer lemon spritz sour tang, with salty honey-ginger crispness. Sweet and bright aroma. Lightly hazed thin, with soapy off-white rim. Flavor a perky, brightly sweetened brettesque. Passionfruit and almond skins, yielding to grapefruit juice tartness. Nice percolation and stunning lightly hoppy finish. A different batch carried a whole world of earthy spice and robustness that took it to another level of excellence. Outstanding. 523 charactersCharlesDarwin, Jul 21, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.54-17-08: Batch 001-PH1. Finally getting to crack my PH1 bottle on a beautiful sunny day. Pours into my glass a lightly hazy honey amber orange with a thick two finger head of creamy bubbles. Aromas bring a mix of citrus, honey and crisp malts bathed in a Brett laden veil. Musty, sharp vinegar and acidic tones alongside woody aspects. Extremely complex and intriguing. Simply awesome.
First sip brings a crisp, sharp malt upfront along with swirling citrus, lemon zest and honey flavors. Mouth puckering sour midway that brings with it a dense array of Brett nuances. Old wood, acidic vinegar, hay, musty funkiness. I get a slight grape aspect as well. The tart and sour aspects are more pronounced that the regular 001. It flows down quite dry overall. An amazing sensory experience in a glass.
Mouthfeel is crisp with punchy carbonation that carries the beer down with a solid effervescence. A great sipper on my porch at the end of a beautiful spring day. One of my all time favorite beers hands down. 
7-13-07: Batch 001. Pours into my tulip glass a clear amber orange with a good inch of bubbly white head and lots of big bubbles rising up to the top. Aromas burst out of the glass with light citrus aromas bathed in brett funkiness. Musty, horse blanket, acetic farmhouse aromas alongside woody and honey scents as well. Has a really bright, vibrant character to it. Wow. This is just wonderful.
First sip brings a rush of tart and sour and a nice base malt. Light citrus flavors, lemon rind and honey mingle in the funkiness of the brew. There's a nice woody dryness with each sip along with a fairly sharp acidic bite. Finishes with a lingering tart funkiness, rather dry. I may be imagining it but I get a bit of a green olive aftertaste with each sip. This is simply an amazing sour, wild ale.
Mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a lively, light carbonation that rushes across the palate with each sip. Really makes drinking this brew enjoyable. I wish this came in a 750ml bottle as I could easily and throughly enjoy the whole bottle myself. Beatification ranks with the best Russian River brews I've had and to be honest the best brews I've had overall. Cheers to Vinnie, Peter at NB and everyone else at RR that made this brew possible. Quite an achievement! 2,280 charactersorbitalr0x, Jul 13, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 001. Pours a hazy peach color, nice and cloudy, with a small white head that recedes quickly. Aroma is strongest of tart apples that is balanced by a soft sweetness and at times smells of homeade applesauce. Aroma also shows some bready spices that blends with a grapey sweetness, also some black pepper and grassiness as well. A hint of the sweetness and spiced breadiness flashes at the front of the tongue before a good sized appley tartness enters and a lemony sourness follows. The taste finishes with a nice drying of the palette. Mouthfeel is fairly light in body, the tartness keeps it very refreshing, a nice dance of peppery carbonation on the tongue does so as well. The aroma was definitely complex and where its at for me with this beer. The taste because of the tartness was not as complex but was still very thirst quenching and very refreshing and easy to sip on. Thanks Mark for the opportunity. 918 charactershoppymeal, Jun 22, 2007
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 001, not the PH1 though.
Poured out a yellow orange color with a white head that quickly dissipated, but left bits of lacing. Smell was sour and vinegar-like; it had barnyard funk as well, but not as powerful, full of pleasant sour aromas. The taste seems to have a bit of lemon and oak beneath the strong sour flavors. I'm not real experienced with Wild Ales, but this one just tasted awesome. It also had tastes of vinegar and ends up with a dry, sour finish. Lighter side of medium body with a dry finish; carbonation is rather high. This is definately one of the better beers I've had and has changed my mind on what sour beers can be. I would definitely drink this again, unfortunately I'll have to wait until the next batch comes out. 747 charactersbadbeer, Feb 16, 2007

The smell is powerful and full of great smells, the best smell I have had in a long time. The taste is great, smooth, with lots of full flavor. The smell of horse blanket and different sour flavors are very non-offensive and just wonderful. They come together to make a really great flavor. The mouthfeel was sooo smooth and impressive, it was very nice and smooth. Overall I will drink this again sometime, very very good. 518 charactersErdinger2003, Jan 13, 2007
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 375 ml corked and caged. Barrel aged 23 months. Batch 001 - PH1. Aged in La Folie barrels.
Appearance: Poured per bottles recommendations without the yeast. Pours orange with just a bit of haze, and a small head with good retention.
Smell: Mmmm.. sour and funky. Lots of brett aroma with fruity undertones. 
Taste: Lots of nice tart sour brett flavors. The brett definitely dominates here - and its highly enjoyable. The base beer appears to be a solid blond, but the sour definitely steals the show.
Overall impression: Very nice sour beer - nice to see Russian River and New Belgium teaming up - this is a great example of an American brewer producing belgian styles. 695 charactersrowew, Nov 24, 2006
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had a few bottles at RR Brewco.
Poured a nice straw yellow with a tight whipped white head. The lace lasted the entire glass.
The aroma of the beer of sweaty horse hair, citric acid, oak, and wild yeasts.
The flavor of the beer was delicately sour and tangy without going overboard. It was incredibly crisp and refreshing. The hops were reasonably pronounced and had a dull floral flavor, as if they'd been aged.
The beer was highly effervescent and the mouthfeel was light.
I've had many a sour beer and for me, this is easily one of the most pleasing. Right up there with it's cousin, La Folie. Considering Vinnie Cilurzo's been brewing for such a short period of time compared to the Belgian's that have supposedly mastered this style, he gives them a real run for their money. The quality of American brewed Belgians is becoming akin to when Napa started turning out better wines than the French. 915 charactersSacoDeToro, Nov 09, 2006
4.91/5  rDev +9.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch PH1
Appearance - 375 ml bottle of the PH1 graciously traded to me by bennetj17. The bottle opens with the kind of energetic pop normally reserved for champagne. As I pour Beatification into a wine glass it only makes a small effort to inflate a choppy head, but quickly loses interest and lets it fall. The La Folie barrel has contributed some red/amber tones to the pale base beer. The first pour has just a hint of haze whereas the second pour in nearly opaque from the sediment.
Smell - At first there is a rush of lambic-like acidity, but it almost immediately dissipates into lavender and perfume. As the beer warms the vanilla laden oak appears and a hint of vinegar emerges. So good I kept smelling the empty glass even after the beer was gone.
Taste - The acidity is beautiful, soft like fresh squeezed lemons. There are a multitude of flavors ranging from dried flowers to toasted oak to the occasional sour cherry. The sourness strikes a perfect balance with the other components, it complements without being overbearing or lasting. 
Alcohol? Hops? Malt? Who needs them! This is just acids, esters and funk.
Mouthfeel - Despite being such a small and dry beer the sharp carbonation and tartness cover up its slender body. 
Drinkability & Notes - Its amazing what 2 years in a La Folie barrel have done to Redemption. A beer unlike any other, closest to a gueuze that isn't completely obscured by sourness. Another masterpiece from one of the great brewing artists; God how I wish I had a case of these to nurse for the next 10 years...
Batch 002 (Spontaneous)
Appearance - Perfectly clear golden-yellow. Thin white head with decent retention for a sour beer. The second pour brings some haze from the yeast sediment.
Smell - An amazingly distinct grapefruit aroma, there is some apricot, and pineapple as well. Some acidity, but it is not sharp or acetic.
Taste - Very citrusy (citric acid?), different than any sourness I have tasted in a beer. Vinnie has said that his large Kloeckera apiculata flora is responsible for this character. There is some rougher Brett/Gueuze like funk, but it is mostly hidden behind the fruitiness. Very little oak character due to the used barrels, just a pure expression of the RR house funk.
Mouthfeel - The lingering coating acidity dominates the mouthfeel. The body is not as thin or highly carbonated as a Gueuze, but it is still thin and spritzy. 
Drinkability & Notes - It's been awhile since I wrote a review, but figured this one was worth it. It isn't as good as the first batch, it lacks the same drinkability and complexity, but it is still one of the most distinct and interesting American sour ales out there. Thanks to Dyan for the bottle. 2,716 charactersOldSock, Oct 21, 2006

Cork disgorges with an resonant pop, loud enough to surprise.
Pours orangy copper and hazy, with an effervescent, beige head that raises and falls quickly.
Placid surface and only a few strands of carbonation with a broken ring of retention around the rim.
Aromatics are complex and tart.
Spritzy lemon zest with marmalade vinegar and wet goat.
Citrus oils with an underlying fresh hay note.
Brett is forefront, but not wincing.
Yeasty and fruity with an acidic twang.
Mouthfeel is lightish and sharp. Mildly puckering and refreshing.
Pallet is extremely fruity and tart, but not sour.
Tangerine, grapefruit, and lemon juices turned to diluted vinegar.
Malt is extremely light, only an afterthought and any remnants of hopping might be a peppery note in the finish.
Alcohol is minimal, but not missed as the stars of the show is the yeast, bugs, and barrel.
Many thanks to Vinnie for such a great brew as well as New Belgium for donating the barrel for this gem. 993 charactersbrewandbbq, Oct 12, 2006
4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was the PH1 bottling.
Appearance: Golden peachy, when left alone a few cloudy islands dance around the ring of lacy head, but comes to a good head after a swirl or two.
Smell: Whoh nelly, fantastic funk going down on this one! It almost had a waxy, old church candle thing going on. Great yeast presence too.
Taste: A kaleidoscope of funky brett, mandarin oranges, perfect amount of balsamic vinegar bittersweet acidity, and balances with pinpoint accuracy with the dry, tart finish.
I've said this before about a another American wild ale from the east coast funkmasters at The Alchemist, those Geuzestekerijses (don't even know if you can put that in plural) better get off their laurels because in a decade or so their American cousins just might muscle in on their racket... 795 charactersGoldorak, Sep 27, 2006
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks for sharing, Jim! The PH bottling, apparently.
Hazy gold, a fizzy, active white head forms on the pour, fizzing down to nothing like cola. Kinda like champagne. The aroma hides in the glass, probably due to the lack of head. Sour and tropical, reminiscent as Jim said of those canned Goya juices. Mango, in particular. Milder lactic funk, like swiss cheese. The flavor follows suit, with boisterous carbonation holding things together and keeping it exciting. The fuller body keeps it feeling somewhat mellow. For a sour ale, this is very drinkable. Fuller bodied than I expected, starting off with a juicy sweetness reminiscent of peach of mango juice, the pulpy kind, moving into a modestly sour and lactic finish. Slight cheese presence, big on the fruit juice. Nice and funky in a mellow way. I think it's good. I'd love to see this again with a couple more years on it. 882 charactersUnionMade, Sep 16, 2006

Nice streaming carbonation visible. Spotty lace remained. Sour apple and pear in the nose, just a really funky tart aroma all around, acidic, vinegar-like. The taste is intensely sour and it immediately begins to dry out through the finish leaving only a touch of bitterness. Light hints of apple, lemon and orange fruit present, with a mild woody taste. Part way through the glass the flavor softens a bit and is very easily drinkable. Sharp carbonation and a light body, there is a superb fluffy/creamy mouthfeel. This and the PH1 are both great offerings. Highly recommended... 698 charactersbennetj17, Sep 01, 2006

Pours out a murky orange with a fizzy tall white head of foam. The head stayed together awhile leaving rings of lace around the glass. Funky brett yeast notes come on pretty strong with a nice mix of fruit sweetness and a balancing light tartness. Some woody notes are in the mix as well. The flavor kicks off with some tart fruit and a light sweetness. Funky yeast and notes of wood add a nice depth of complexity. Lingering tart fruitness lingers at the finish. Well carbonated body and quite refreshing. Really drinkable stuff as well, almost too much so. I wish it was a 750ml bottle or bigger. A very unique and delicious beer that I would love to have available all the time. 695 charactersmeathookjones, Aug 17, 2006

Slightly hazed light copper. The big bubbly off white head fizzes away quickly and the remnant collar leaves sparse amounts of lace behind. Carbonation doesn't LOOK to be as jacked up in this one compared to the 001. Aroma is a little more pronounced than the 001. Some barnyard funk and more discernible brett characteristics on the nose. Even a little horse blanket smell. Bone dry feel again in the mouth. Medium bodied. Acidic and tart. Carbonation is not quite as spritzy as the 001, but still nice. Maybe a little bit more of an "airy" feel to it. The acidity and tartness are a little more agressive here compared to 001. Nice bite to it. The funk is more pronounced on the palate and it's pretty damn nice. Fruitiness isn't quite as noticeable compared to 001. I'm not one of those guys that lives and dies for Wild Ales and lambics and sour beers, etc... But this shit is addictive. I'm liking them more and more, but maybe that's 'cuz I'm getting the best of the best here. 
Thanks again to Darren for the sample. MUCH appreciated. 1,062 charactersBighuge, Aug 15, 2006
4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 508/11/06- Purchased by mail order direct from Russian River Brewery in Santa Rosa, CA.
Presentation- Batch 001-PH1. 375ml (12.7oz) bottle which was caged and corked. Poured into an oversized wine glass.
Appearance- Opens with a loud pop and pours with furious carbonation. The loudest talking beer I have ever heard. The carbonation was just screaming. Poured into a huge ass wine goblet, maybe 22oz capacity. Filled close to the top at pour and settled down at about a 1/4 inch of a spitzy yet slight creamy looking top. Quite lovely cobwebs and small chunks of lace leftover in the aftermath.
Smell- Bits of stinky horse blanket and musty barn and moth balls. You know this one will be a sour one upon the taste. Sour overripe fruits appear after the cork pops. 
Taste- Pretty much pure decadence. Combines the flavor of several of my favorite styles of beer. Has a NB Love flavor (which makes sense as it was aged in those barrels). Has a nice Flanders Ale quality....liked to Goudenband and even has that nice barnyard Fantome-esque flavor. Sour, but about the perfect acidic level fruits rush around. Lemon rind, maybe some cherries and raspberries. All combine to make you crave that next sip.
Mouthfeel- A tad bit highly carbonated and gaseous, but not too much as to hinder drinking. Sweet and sour aftertaste that lasts just long enough to tempt you for that next sip.
Drinkability- Well, I timed this one about perfect. Sat here on an early evening night in Broadview, Montana...nothing but vast farmland as far as the eyes can see. A few antelope over here, a few partridges over there and a cow or two mooing in the background...not to mention the bats starting to fly into the barn and the two hoot-owls going at it. Ahhh, all this in the middle of a thunderstorm. Review #999 and taking a 8 month or so beer respite as of bedtime this Sunday....only have a Dreadnaught in waiting for my last beer in my self imposed beer break due to my wife's pregnancy. This was about the perfect beer today. Great taste, incredibly refreshing due to the higher humidity today. Russian River scores again. Vinnie...thanks for making one of my last brews for a while a memorable one. Extreme highest of recommendation!! 2,235 charactersGClarkage, Aug 12, 2006
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours out pale yellow and sits bright gold in the glass with a waivering white head. Fades to a thin skimming over the surface with some decent lacings.
Smells sour and perky, very dominant Brett and Ped characteristics. Tart and shiny apples, light, puckering grapes. A very clean aroma, void of much mustiness, a delicate appearance.
Tastes powerfully sour at first contact. Under-ripened grapes and crab apples form the fruit body. Mild acidity and a pungent, near citric, soury sweetness pulled over any form of malt flavor, making this most akin to a sparkling sauvignon blanc. But to hell with wine, this blows it all away. A tight, crisp finish with mild bitterness caps it all off.
Crisp, with ever-so-tiny bits of carbonation, moderate overall, and a medium-light body.
This is fantastic. It's nice to find such a high quality sour beer being produced in the States. Too bad it doesn't find it's way out of CA, unless if I have agents working for me while on vacation. Just spectacular. 1,007 charactersSkidz, Aug 07, 2006
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had previously sampled Beatification at the RR Brewpub in October of 2005, straight from the barrel and again in January of this year at a RR dinner at Monk's Cafe but this is my first review of this fine beer from the bottle.
Batch 001 (PH1) is waiting patiently in my cellar.
The beer poured a nice brilliant hazy straw color with a bit of a white head that didn't last very long and gave way to a good ring around the glass and strong lacing. The aroma of the beer definitely had the characterstics of where it was aged, in an oak barrel, but it was not overpowering. Notes of cherry and other fruit. The taste was very impressive, tart and acidic and a bit of funkiness but not overbearing, just perfectly complimenting each other. The taste lingered in the mouth for awhile and did have a bit of a dry champagne burn to it which I like in a beer. There is a lingering sweetness to this beer that is very pleasant and I just can't get enough of. 
It would be interesting to taste this along side Redemption which is where this started and also with the PH1 to test the subtle differences in each. Vinnie and Natalie hit this one out of the park as they do with so many of their beers. A real winner, too bad there is not much of this out there. 1,259 charactersggaughan, Aug 06, 2006
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml smoked green bottle, batch 001.
The cork releases with a loud pop and the neck starts to fill with slowly building foam.
Hazy peach core with sunlight highlights at the margins. Short, loose packed head of small soft eggshell bubbles that crackles as it slowly settles leaving a tall collar and a thick cap. Intertwined lines of meandering carbonation mix with fine lines of racing bubbles. The aroma is filled with tartness and just a hint of funkiness. There is some blossomy sweetness paired with barrel notes. A wonderful tartness with an acidic edge opens things, filled with plenty of brett essence. There is a delectable sweet element that intermingles with a gently wood note. Bright and sharp with a delicate, sweetly tart underpinning. The finish is pleasingly edgy and with a prolonged dryness which makes this compelling. There is a sense of balance here, but it is still a bit brash. Medium body with ample peppery carbonation, there is a vibrant mouthfeel that is almost light, the dryness leaves the palate clean. In a word: fantastic. I could not put my glass down. This was simply a spectacular beer and I am looking forward to the PH-1 waiting down in the cellar.
A homerun by Vinnie and Natalie and the rest of the RR crew. 1,257 charactershopsaplenty, Jul 31, 2006
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5While I'd normally take obsessive notes to "properly" review this beer few tasting notes would do this brew any justice. This is quite simply the greatest beer I've ever tasted. The lenghth and breadth of flavor are intense ranging from cheesy to yeasty to oaky notes with hints of citrus fruits and spice throughout. Forgive the wine analogy but it's like Salon, Krug Clos de Mesnil, and a Flemish sour ale got freaky together and this is their love child. It displays all of the strengths of their parents without any of the detractions. It has the cleansing sourness of the Flemish ale, the cheesiness of Salon and the nuttyness of Krug all harmoiniusly balanced within its beery goodness. The only problem is that the bottle at 375ml is too small for a second serving. For a first batch (was there a test?) this is a resounding success. Bravo Russian River for an extremely amazing brew.

A: Fizzy carbonation that I'll let chill a bit before taking a sip. The blue tinted white head has reduced to a healthy ring and wispy top. The color of the body is truly breathtaking...A vibrant dark golden hue. No visible sediment but damned if you are going to see thru this beer. Walking the line between raw and hand crafted.
S: Lemon, oak, yeast, wet hay, sourdough bread and a quite a few other aromas that most brewers try to avoid.
T: Oh my...oh my goodness. The pungent sourness is immediate and apparent. This much I expected. The exotic yeasts then lend their buttery goodness and transform the beer from a standard sour to so much more. I expected this as well but not too the level at which its achieved. An ameretto flavor pops up and displays a nutty personality that took me by surprise. From there the beer moves towards a dryer tone with the sourness and sweetness balancing then waining and the buttery brett holding strong across the palate. 
M: Full bodied but a smooth but somewhat prickly carbonation.
D: These friggin guys, I swear. Where do they get off making beer like this? Who the hell do they think they are? 
I think they are the best brewers in the world, but thats just me. Simply staggering. 1,254 charactersWestsidethreat, Jul 12, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Batch 001, Sampled July 2006
Pours with an orangish, hazy (got a bit more sediment than I thought on that pour), gold color. It is topped by a frothy, pale tan colored head that disappears fairly quickly. It is pretty well carbonated, but seems to be a bit more subdued than the PH1. As soon as I pour this beer it is apparent to my nose that this is a sour beer; tart acidic notes reach my nostrils. A lactic sourness seems to dominate, almost has that fresh grapefruit aroma that some straight Lambics pick up. Does not have much in the way of Brettanomyces character; there does seem to be a touch of musty Brett funk and perhaps a hint of urea, but that is fairly subdued. When digging around in the nose there is a dry, malty, toasted grain note almost like crackers. This does not have the funk in the aroma, or the woody notes that the batch-001 PH1 had, it is still quite nice though and reminds me of the aromatics on a batch of Girardin straight Lambic I once had in Beersel Belgium.
Dry, tart and lactic from the get go, this is actually a bit harder in its perceived acidity than the PH1. I say perceived because this beer does not have as many of the balancing notes (wood and funk come to mind), that the other batch did, so it may just seem more tart. It does remind me some of a very tart grapefruit, sour yet with a bit of fruity complexity that a lemon does not have. Hints of green apples (in fact even something that reminds of a green apple jolly rancher) and a touch of unripe pear. The finish is at first dominated by the sourness (like the rest of the beer), but picks up a touch of astringency, perhaps some tannins, a dry sort of lingering, biscuit like maltiness and even a note that reminds me of Curacao orange peel. Wonderfully easy drinking, and light on the palate, while at the same time having a sort of creamy mouthfeel to it.
While it is not as challenging or complex, I really like it for its aggressive straight forward tartness. The dominant tartness is joined by a touch of malt character, some austere fruit notes and perhaps a wisp of funk. Another characterful brew from what is fast becoming one of my absolute favorite breweries. 2,181 charactersGueuzedude, Jul 12, 2006

Pours a hazy copper color and makes a fizzy sizzling white head. Head is rather short and fades quickly into a thin ring of medium sized bubbles.
Aroma is tart with some big sour citrus, earthy barnyard funk and vinegar.
Flavor is moderately sour with a lemony citric bite, barnyard qualities carry well into the flavor, very earthy. All hop characteristics are hidden by sour/funk. Very nicely balanced, strong acidic intensity but not overbearing.
Crisp, light bodied, very carbonated, some astringency and a very dry finish.
Quite good! 601 characterskmcnair, Jul 06, 2006
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Batch 001-PH1. 
(Brewed on 4-May-04 and Bottled on 6-Feb-06)
Primary: R.R. Belgian 2 
Conditioning: White Labs White Wine
5.5%ABV
The Batch 001-PH1 is the sister brew to the Batch 001, which I also tried. The principal difference is that the used La Folie barrel known as PH1 was, according to Lauren Salazar the La Folie QA & Sensory Analyst, the best of the two barrels used to age the Beatification. 
The Batch 001-PH1 was sampled alongside the Batch 001 in a simple straight forward good old fashioned side-by-side comparison.
Presentation: Exactly the same bottle as the Batch 001, like for like, the only difference, easily missed, is the fact that it is labeled as Batch 001-PH1, a reference to the above.
Appearance: Like last time, I used my Cantillon Gueuze tumbler again. For a start, the Batch 001-PH1 has a darker body, a coppery golden torso with a little more turbidity than the Batch 001. A starker contrast between the two was immediately evident before the first sip though, the head retention is dramatically reduced in the Batch 001-PH1. The head dies down quickly and leaves only a broken covering which very quickly rescinds to nothing, the surface only punctuated with an explosion of rising bubbles like farts in the bath. Whilst the Batch 001 looks Gueuze like, the Batch 001-PH1 is more like a 1 year old straight lambic.
Nose: Harder to quantify but it has a distinctly sharper aroma, cutting acidic character with a drier tartness in the finish.
Taste: The nose provides plenty of insight into the differences. The Batch 001-PH1 has a more aggressive feel, the softness in the Batch 001 is gone and replaced with a scorched middle, acerbic finish scrapes a little. Ending is shorter lived too I found.
Mouthfeel: Lower carbonation and a harsher feel on the palate, the woody nature adds more texture but it feels a rougher than the Batch 001. Big feel though and a solid presence.
Drinkability: Not much difference the two, they are not exactly alike in the drinkabilty stakes but they are both *very* appealing brews. I found the Bacth 001-PH1 incredibly drinkable despite the small differences with the Batch 001.
Overall: Differences between Batch 001 and Batch 001-PH1 are easily noted in appearance, but the changes in the nose and taste comparison are a little bit more subtle, but they are there. Batch 001-PH1 is the harsher of the two variants, higher in acidity and sharpness, it will be interesting to follow the aging of both versions, and I suspect the PH1 will flag first.
A great beer nonetheless, but Batch 001 takes it over the slightly more expensive ($1 more per 375cl bottle) Batch 001-PH1 for my money. 2,695 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Jul 01, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Batch 01. I have the PH too, to sample later.
Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.
A - Orangish, apricot color with a pilowy head that disipates fairly quickly. Well carbonated. Just a swirl of the glass with put more foam on top.
S - First, let me start by saying that I could smell this thing as soon as the cork popped from over two feet away. Smells of funky apples, almost ciderish, with subtle fruits in the background. The Bret is there too, bringing a vinegar quality to it as well. Great stuff.
T - Sour apples start, but very soon the earthy flavors push them out of the way. At the finish, this baby will make you pucker, while at the same time reminding you of a sweet Belgian. It is very difficult to describe and I'm not sure I've ever tasted anything like this. I like it a lot, however. Very unique.
M - Maybe a tad overcarbonated and a little thin, but I suppose that is OK for this wide-open style. As one would guess, this is a very dry beer, but in a good way.
D - Not a problem. I love it. 1,031 charactersSethB2, Jun 29, 2006
4.76/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I tasted both the 001 and the PH1 side by side to see how they matched up together. The differences are subtle but they are there. If you were to taste them a couple weeks apart, you probably wouldn't be able to decipher any differences though.
001
Pours a nice golden color. A distinct murkiness to it. Beautiful white head on it that never goes away.
Not to much on the nose. Definitely get the tartness and the carbonation. Smells of oak and fruitiness.
Incredible tasting beer. Of course the tartness hits you first. But not overpowering. I've had a hand few sour beers, and the tartness on this one was by far the most balanced. Not like the Cuvee Rene that your puckering for 10 minutes after you drink it. Oak flavoring, but not to powerful either. A slight taste of cherries too.
PH1
Of course many similarities between the two. The major differences though, are it pours slightly darker than the 001. Side by side, you can tell. The PH1 seems to have more initial carbonation, but does not keep the head retention of the 001. Not much difference in the nose between the two. The PH1 has a more profound tartness to it. Stays on the tongue much longer than the 001. A longer, more sourer, aftertaste.
I may be in the minority on this, but I preferred the 001 over the PH1. They are both absolutely amazing beers, and I do enjoy sour beers. I just preferred the fact that sourness dissipated on the tongue quicker on the 001 than the PH1, allowing you to pull the other amazing flavors from the beer. I've had a pretty wide selection of Russian River beers, and besides the Pliny's, this has been by far my favorite to come from them. You'd do well to try and get some of these. 1,702 charactersCallenak, Jun 26, 2006
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My notes were a little messy here, but I'm sure htis is the right beer.
Pours a lovely gold with a lingering white head. Having a hard time picking out this aroma ... cherries? Nice aroma though. Taste is delicious and lingering and a highly drinkable beer. 
Not many notes on this, but it was freakin good. 313 charactersobjectivemonkey, Apr 19, 2006
