12oz bottle poured into a snifter
A- pours a deep black color with a one-finger creamy light tan head that has great retention long after the pour, looks like an espresso and leaves great lacing behind, the best head retention I've ever seen from a BA beer
S- huge roasted coffee notes up front; earthy, herbal, light char, espresso.  Beyond the coffee, aromas of sweet vanilla cream, some nuttiness, cocoa & peppery bourbon soaked wood
T- opens with a huge hit of espresso, earthy & herbal, quickly followed by bourbon and spicy wood notes poking through.  Mid-palate gives sweet vanilla cream, chocolate, molasses and caramel.  As it nears the finish, notes of charred malt adds some smoky notes and battles with sweet flavors of more vanilla and coconut.  Lingers of sherry, bourbon, chocolate and char
M- medium body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues all the way to the finish, finishes with pure velvety, silky cream, abv hidden well 
O- I've waited a long time to try the BA version of one of my favorite coffee stouts and it didn't disappoint.  The barrel notes blend brilliantly with the base beer and has that remarkable creamy velvety mouthfeel throughout, just as with the regular version, outstanding 1,269 charactersTreyliff, Mar 19, 2017

A- Black as can be body from the taps to my snifter tasting glass. A tan cap forms atop the brew with good retention and massive sheets of lace decorate the glass everywhere. The head has a silky, fluffy texture.
S- Medium strength bourbon barrels and the best coffee stout of all compliment each other like spaghetti and meatball. Peppery whiskey, medium dark roast coffee, luscious cocoa, vanilla sweets, toasted oak, heavy toasted nuts and wet wood. The balance and marriage is spot on.
T- Again. Follows the aroma but somehow got better. Amazing balance of bourbon barrel and the best coffee stout. Vanilla, toasty spicy wet bourbon wood, pepper whiskey, slight raisin, caramel, dark chocolate around 80% cocoa, a bit of booze and even a scotch saltiness. Literally a balance of the ages.
MF- Medium thickness with a creamy smooth consistency.. Low end carbonation allows the decadent flavors to shine. Ends with some alcohol warming. A bit slick. Could use some more thickness but hardly an issue as it is big enough to support the balanced flavor profile.
This barrel is lit fire hype amazing. Coffee, vanilla, cocoa and whiskey in heaven. The best coffee stout gets a kiss from one of the best barrels around. Dessert goodness and something I could honestly sip on for hours if there was enough. 1,362 characterscbutova, Mar 17, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The the barrel age treatment given to coffee-infused imperial stout, the delima of how much barrel to gain versus how much coffee to retire puts the brewer in quite a limbo.
The Dieu du Ciel cellar masters hit this quandary head on, giving their classic Peche Mortel the right kiss of oak and bourbon with the smoothness of cold-press coffee to boot. Black, deep and nearly inky, its lowly headed appearance is brought to life with those bold espresso aromas along with chocolates and bourbons to suggest whisky infused dessert. Especially as the taste of bittersweet chocolate, molasses and caramel carry a smooth vanilla-like upstart. 
As the malt saturates the middle palate, its rich maple, molasses, caramel and creamy-sweetness is soon layered with the robust taste of burnt toast, coffee, roasted nuttiness and dark chocolate. As the oak and hops rise to balance the lasting malt and their charred accompaniments, any bitterness is dismissed as hops and assumed to be roast-derived. Coconut, vanilla, cherry, vinous sherry and unmistakable bourbon simmer in the finish for a satisfying but sultry taste experience.
Full, creamy and velvety smooth on the palate, the stout glides into the finish like silk. Heavy cream, milkshake and whipped cream come to mind as the lasting flavors are of bourbon wrapped chocolates lasting well into the next, savory dessert-filled sip. 1,381 charactersBEERchitect, Dec 02, 2016

Nutty coffee remains formidable here and the bourbon isn't too strong on the nose, giving off only a slight oaky presence.

Nose is dank, potent coffee. Hints of roast, chocolate and mocha all engulfed by a rich, sweet bourbon. Beer opens sweet and syrupy. Espresso, mocha and roasted malt up front with booze, peat and tobacco in the back. Wet wood is prominent here. Molasses sweetness from start to finish with a very light soy sauce presence at the finish. Good complexity with a full, velvety mouthfeel to match. Light bubbles dance on the tongue and combines with the booze to create a warm feeling going down. 
I actually think that the barrel-aging takes a little something away from this one. Still a very good beer but maybe it needs a little time to mellow the barrel presence. 832 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 15, 2016

4.01/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Pours opaque black with one finger heas. Aroma is licorice, booze, bitter coffee, and oak. I don't get the vanilla/caramel notes from the bourbon. Taste follows. This means more toward the generic whiskey flavor and lacks the rich toffee flavors. This is not a sweet beer. The coffee is smooth and roasty, but it's a little overwhelmed by the whiskey. I get some earthy hop notes as well. Definitely leans toward European style. Mouth feel light to medium. Overall, I'd say the barrel doesn't improve the base beer, but this is still very good. 544 charactersdanh53, May 15, 2016

F: Medium body with ample carbonation despite having been cellared for several years - exceptionally smooth overall and bordering on creamy
O: This was a decided improvement upon the base Péché Mortel, which is a stand out stout by itself. For me the barrel aging added a complexity and depth that enhanced the velvety coffee profile. Overall this is an incredible BA stout. My only complaint is the feel was a bit thinner than I would have hoped, but rest assured this is a world class beer and one of Canada's finest. 795 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 08, 2016

I've had so many beers that are absolutely ruined by a barrel, but thankfully this one is actually significantly improved, which is crazy because the regular brew is so great!
Pours with a nice head, only a thin ring of retention, but shows some leg.
Aroma is so much more complex, as the regular version is overwhelmed with coffee. 
The coffee flavour is more subdued, with a pleasant wood throughout and some bourbon in the finish.
Body is smoother and seems much less acidic.
I was sceptical, but this just might be the best beer in Canada. I'm seriously surprised how much better this is with some time in a barrel.  Well done... World class.
Thanks Papat444! 733 charactersDerek, Mar 12, 2016

A- Poured 1/2" black and 3" brown head that lasted for over 5mins before it got reasonable enough to touch. Very dark almost black colour
S- Some bourbon here but not a lot. Touch of chocolate and malt. Very subdued
T- Low on the bourbon scale. Expected a lot more and was very disappointed. Just a standard mortel with a slight BBA to it. Can't say I like it at all. Too bad really since l like the standard version very well.
M- Flat. Guess the nitro and rough pour might have screwed this glass up.
O- Not a big fan. If I get one in a bottle and it's any different I will re-review but as it stands will not buy on tap ever again. Very disappointed but will go to the brewery to see if I can try one in a bottle to see if it's different and report back.
Food Pairing
Bourbon barrel aged brews are not that easy to pair but this one had very little bourbon to it so if can pair ok with...... Brownies with caramel and chocolate chips inside. The chocolate overload will help this brew out.

4.8/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured on tap of 10 oz. into a snifter glass at Churchkey DC on Péché Mortel Day.  First running from the keg and tap too.  Vintage 2015.
Big thick rich mocha to dark tan espresso head produced, whipped up like a mousse with creamy and thick clingy retention.  Sits upon a simple opaque and real dark walnut nearly black body.  The head is particularly impressive in this middle color of not really dark but slightly so, and a bakery pastry whipped topping.  Excellent looking brew.
Aroma is just incredibly well done.  The nose bursts in to thick dark cocoa powder on first examination.  Following next are other thick notes of giant vanilla tones, with perfectly balanced ripped coffee beans.  A piping warmth of roasted grain and coffee comes off this, entering that classic espresso like character on the beer, but with a richer bitter chocolate and even a touch of caramel warmth coming through.  The aroma is just thick as hell and gets stuck in your nose, and not even a trace of boozy character.  A real impressive winner.
Palate is just a big winner.  While the booze is evident but not overly so on first sips or flooding the mid palate, much of the aromas don’t just come through easily, they come with even more surprises.  Creamy but lighter than expected feel out of the gate, but with easier drinkability  a little but still rich coating and filling the palate, and a big first burst of vanilla on first sip.  There's a perfect mix of shocking rich vanilla and then tobacco bitterness of roasted malt that is a wicked compliment going on in the mid palate that just takes over.  The sweetness on this is just perfect in that it has hints, but lets beer roast bitterness and even trace elements of cocoa take over.  Giant dark cocoa notes on the finish, but also a finish that accents lots of roasted bean and excellent coffee tones.  There's a noticeable piping warmth, much accented by a touch of booze that warms all the flavors incredibly bouncing from excellent espresso flavors to roasted malt and char qualities, to an excellent truly superior dark candy bar chocolate and vanilla wafery flavor.  The vanilla wafery quality even comes out in the aftertaste, giving this impressive adult chocolate tobacco coffee candy bar wafer and flavor.
Overall it's really stunning, a little boozy though in the pit of the stomach but luckily not in taste is the only thing that seems to be a minor detraction.  Otherwise this is about as near perfect a bourbon barrel aged stout with coffee gets. 2,513 characterssmakawhat, Feb 28, 2016

O:
Wowee! 
Definitely a delicious take on an amazing beer. It pours beautifully to the point that it even has a Macro-lager-commercial-esque head overflow. This is the kind of beer I can point to when people act like a boozy stout shouldn't have a gorgeous head cause of the alcohol. The small and flavor walk hand-in-hand with standard Péché riding on the back of oak vanillins, bourbon sweetness and a mallet sweetness that really makes it all taste like if you put maple, bourbon and cream in espresso and then carbonated it. The feel is fantastic, the flavor and smell as well. Truly a great beer. (4.75) 1,145 charactersTheDoctor, Jun 04, 2015

Bottle to Dieu du Ciel Snifter
341 Ml bottle (November 13 notched)
Thank Jon for this one!
App- For a stout and one that I liked so much with the base version, this is just off on appearance for me. Inky black but doesnt create a good head even with a solid pour. No cling or lace. Falls and looks like a bit of flat soda IMO. Was expecting more.
Smell- I get faint smells on this one. The coffee is there, but more of a cold pressed aroma. The barrel comes after with a strong whispy bourbon with oak, vanilla and booze. Not the most upfront booze but well layered and a bit sweet.
Taste- The flavors of this one are much more subdued but just so well integrated and create great pockets of flavors. Opening sips of a bit of the coffee with a bit of bitter. The vanilla and bourbon flavors come next with some smooth oak with a bit of a whispy booze on the finish.
Mouth- A smooth and creamy drinking stout with a thinner mouth feel with a bit of a prickly mouth feel. The bourbon isnt bold and in your face but so much layers on this one. Like the before mentioned pockets of flavors. This mouthfeel builds on this one.
Drink- Its been a want for a long time. I was lucky enough to finally land one and not at a tasting where 2oz, just wouldnt cut it. This was a good beer. Every Dieu Du Ciel beer I have had is a winner. They do great beers. 1,370 charactersFosterJM, May 19, 2015

The pour is sordid black with a spiffy head that doesn’t last long. The nose is surprisingly light, with only a bit of coffee & whiff of sweetness even after sitting out for several minutes. Huh. 
Peche Mortel – Bourbon Barrel Aged is a serious  mouthful. The base beer is huge, filling up the crevassi in my mouth like a good pothole filler. Beyond that, the coffee remains sharp & acrid, slightly bitter. The barrel is a let down. It seems to add only a touch of creaminess & a drop or two of vanilla, with no bourbon taste at all (though a bit of an afterimage, kind of like Predator). Mouthfeel saves this, it’s rich & full & lovely. I could drink plenty, or as much as my internal gyroscope would allow, anyways. 
Really not much of an improvement, if any, on the base beer, despite the nirvanaesque feel of this lovely burrito in my mouth…but that’s no insult. Still a good brew. 1,098 charactersmaximum12, Apr 15, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours pitch black with a very thin tan head. The nose is deep chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, a bit of dried dark fruit (Glosette raisins almost), some bourbon sweetness, and just a touch of dark roast coffee; extremely well rounded. Taste is full blown dessert; chocolate brownie, espresso, more vanilla, more bourbon, exceedingly delicious. Mouthfeel is fairly thick but silky smooth, light on carbonation, a slight boozy warmth.
Overall, one of my all time favourite stouts. Removes a lot of the roast/bitter characteristic of regular Peche and replaces it with some of the smoothest bourbon and chocolate flavours I've tasted in a beer. What sets this beer apart is not how bold of a flavour it produces but the integration of all of the flavours together; absolutely expertly crafted. 789 charactersBeervana, Mar 18, 2015

The coffee here is just massive...nose and taste...like whopping fresh and roasty..so large and present. The bourbon is soft underneath providing mellow support, but the coffee is so lively and jumps center stage.
I don't recall the base being anything remotely to this flavorful. My god...a coffee bomb in the freshest way, even 15 months after bottling. 411 charactersBarrytheBear, Jan 31, 2015

I love the standard Péché Mortel and had high expectations for this brew.  Sadly, the barrel character was overpowering for my tastes.  The coffee was almost completely hidden to me, and only really came through at the very end of the taste.  For big fans of bourbon though, I would imagine that this is a real treat.  A vintage bottle might be more to my liking. 424 characterslgmol, Jan 07, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +6.7%2014 vintage. Labeled as 2013 on the bottle but according to Dieu du Ciel, it's a new batch. 
Smell of coffee beans, vanilla, bourbon, wood and toffee.
Taste of intense bourbon, wet wood, coffee and aromas of chocolate milk and small spicy notes from alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Warm and round. Very complex and well-balanced. The strong aroma of coffee doesn't taste as much as the original version.
Bitterness is long and sweet. Hints of chocolate and bourbon. Very nice beer from DDC, again. 507 charactersFranck, Dec 11, 2014

Very small head, fades quickly, nice legs but little lacing, just about pitch black. 
Nose lots of dark malts, some dark fruits, raisiny like, then fudgey cocoa, dark choc, chewy milk choc, little coffee, light bourbon and some toasted oak barrel. Lush choc too. Little oxidation. 
Taste creamy choc, lush smooth rich choc, mild vanilla and light coffee, dark choc fudge with some bitter roasty char, faint faint booze warmth, little oxidation again. Light toasted oak and faint bourbon. Finish is bitter with little roast, more fudgey cocoa and mouth coating sticky lingering, little coffee and bourbon oak barrel.
Mouth is fuller bod, lighter carb, smooth creamy. 
Overall great but mild oxidation due to screw cap, otherwise amazing. I remember this being ridiculously phenomenal at The Festival, so I wonder if this has dropped off, maybe I'll get to try it again someday and confirm. 1,023 charactersjlindros, Nov 09, 2014

Aroma of coffee and bourbon
Head average (2.5 cm), light brown, creamy, slowly diminishing to 2 mm layer
Lacing good – multiple rings of tiny bubbles 
Body very dark brown to black, opaque
Flavor of coffee, bourbon, a little vanillin, and light chocolate predominate. It ends with a light bitterness, but is not unpleasant.
Palate full, creamy, soft carbonation.
This is a fantastic beer, one of the best I’ve ever had. It’s so good I don’t want to drink it because I only have one bottle and if I drink it, it’ll be gone. 583 charactersOzzylizard, Jun 19, 2014

A - Pours pitch black, two thumbs of dark mocha head, solid retention and nice sheeting lacing.
S - Loads of cocoa, raw coffee grinds, wooden oak, sweet bourbon and burnt sugar and boozy notes also come through.
T - Much like the nose with loads of dark chocolate and cocoa, solid coffee presence, raw espresso and burnt toast, bourbon aging comes through nicely with a solid dose of sweet bourbon booziness, wooden oak notes and toasted grains and burnt caramel lingers alongside a solid dose of espresso.
M - Medium bodied, smooth and a touch of dryness. Surprisingly not overly heavy or sticky.
O - A world class brew taken to the next level with a solid bourbon flavour profile. One of the best bourbon barrel aged brews to hail from Canada and a pleasure to have had the opportunity to try. Definitely a priviledge to try and not surprisingly one of the top rated Canadian beers. 989 charactersandrenaline, Jun 08, 2014

Date: 6/4/14
Location: Montreal Trade
Glassware: Tulip
Appearance: Black to Dark Brown in coloring with a nice mocha head. The carbonation evaporates quite quickly. The beer has a nice viscous ring along its edge. 
Aroma: Strong aromas of coffee that clearly comes from the base. But the coffee smell is not nearly as strong as regular Pêché Mortel. Malted caramel and some vanillas can be found along with a modest touch of the bourbon that I was looking for. 
Taste: This is clearly amongst the most well balanced of the bourbon barrel stouts I've ever had. The coffee flavor is even lighter on the flavor but the caramel, vanilla and even some marshmallow sugars come out a touch stronger. There is a hint of booziness from the bourbon which again isn't overpowering. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body.There is some coarseness from the coffee but the booze really seems to mellow it out. Little carbonation aides in the smoothness of the beer.

2013 Vintage
Pours pitch black with a short, dark mocha head fading quickly back into the glass leaving no apparent lacing. The nose is dominated by dark roasted malt with lots of subtleties: lots of coffee, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and some boozy bourbon. On the palate, the beer again is dominated by dark, sweet roasted malt, espresso and dark chocolate. The boozy bourbon is present but in the background not overpowering other notes in the brew (vanilla, cocoa nibs, molasses). The body is big with just enough carbonation for a silky smooth and rich mouthfeel. Overall, this is an outstanding BA coffee RIS with a lot of complexity; it is not overpowered by any single feature be it coffee, hops, malts or barrel. 779 charactersmtomlins, Mar 31, 2014

Appearance: It has a nice deep jet black color to it. It has a nice thick tan head that dies down moderately slow and leaves some spotty lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of dark roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, some espresso and woody oak. Fantastic
Taste: Like the aromas, it has loads of rich coffee, espresso, vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, smooth bourbon and oak. Wow, so complex! 
Mouthfeel: It has a low carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. Peché Mortel was already one of the best Imperial Stout I've ever tried but this just beats them all. 713 charactersSebD, Mar 01, 2014

2013 VINTAGE, 12 MONTHS IN BOURBON CASKS
I never mention bitterness in my reviews, my bitterness taste buds are ridiculously under-
sensitive.
APPEARANCE : Looks thick coming out of the bottle. Pitch black body, dark mocha head that barely rises and then falls back into the brew within a couple of minutes. Definitely what you'd expect from a barrel-aged imperial stout.
SMELL : First nose is straight to the point - coffee, burnt malt, bourbon aromas. Bam. Second nose adds in some dark fruits, like over-ripe prunes or dates. Some molasses as well. Third nose is a melting pot of all these, plus a healthy dose of yeast aromas, and the wood comes out a lot more as well. Barely any smoke, I did expect some, but it's almost completely absent.
TASTE : Molasses, coffee, prunes, dates, bourbon wood, burnt wood, scalded malts, more coffee, hint of vanilla. Dense but stays fresh and not too heavy, Most pleasing. Add in some smoke and this would be very close to being as good as Hill Farmstead's bourbon aged Damon.
MOUTHFEEL : The carbonation surprised me, considering the near-absence of a head. Had to give it a few swirls to bring it down to something more to my liking in this style of beer (I like my fat stouts with barely any carbonation at all). Texture is thick but not cloying or overwhelming. It coats the mouth pleasingly but doesn't overstay its welcome. It knows when it's time to let go. I just wish this alcohol warmth stayed with me for longer than it does - for the whole night, if possible, or maybe better still, that I woke up to it the next morning - among the best cosy alcohol warmth I've had the pleasure of feeling in a beer. And this brew's length is pretty impressive, it lasts and lasts. I could've gone for something a bit more on the oily side, but definitely not by much - say, never as much as Hardknot's Vitesse Noire, but somewhere on the way there.
OVERALL : Among the very best barrel aged imperial stouts I've had. I stand much impressed with this brew and I'll age the others I got my paws on, see what they have to say in a few years' time. I'd fallen out of DDC's products lately, and I still do believe that most of their products, while being very, very good, are not *outstanding* in a world-class sense, they did hit the nail solidly on the head with this particular brew. 2,340 charactersFrostBlast, Mar 01, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5served in a bottle at Dieu Du Ciel's brewpub. the bottles we got were aged from 2013 for a year in bourbon barrels.
pouring, this beer is black with a small, dense dark brown head that dissipates quickly. on the nose, there's plenty of trace bourbon with coffee and even dark chocolate. the taste contains a load of bourbon bite at the front and then transitions into dark coffee and chocolate. at 10% (i believe this is the percent of the beer; it is 9.5 aged for a year so i would guess it goes up a bit), there is a definite warming sensation but no overpower booze flavours. as the beer warms, the bourbon taste becomes a bit more subdued, letting the coffee come out more. this beer feels a thinner than the normal peche mortel in the mouth.
overall, a great beer that is a slight improvement upon the usual Peche Mortel, which is already a fantastic beer. at 6.5$ for a 341ml bottle, a bit pricey, but glad i got to try it. well worth the price. 953 characterszhivago373, Feb 12, 2014

Poured a jet-black with solid 1 finger tan head that hung around for most of the time. Solid espresso and dark chocolate notes with a hint of barrel and sweet note rounding things out. Taste matches nose with solid chunky mouthfeel with a hint of burn. Solid carbonation, overall slight improvement on a fantastic coffee IRS. Try it if you have the chance. 408 charactersunclejazz, Feb 11, 2014

Pours black with small dark tan head that dissipates quickly. Lots of alcohol legs on sides of glass.
Aroma is a brilliant combination of chocolate, molasses, vanilla, coffee, and oak. Aroma is a bit reminiscent of KBS. Lovely! 
On the palate you get that Peche strong coffee flavor mixed with rich dark chocolate notes and a rounding bourbon oak character. Freshly brewed black coffee, dark cocoa nibs, peaty molasses, grade b maple syrup, vanilla bean, oak, and caramelized dark dry fruit poking in gently. This is delicious. So smooth and drinkable. No flavor dominates though the coffee is still the front runner.
Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of things for an Imperial Stout. You can expect that when they are brewed with coffee though. Mouthfeel is Black Note body all the way with a bit less creaminess. Good carbonation for the style. 
Overall this is outstanding. You get big coffee, rich dark chocolates, smooth vanilla and bourbon characters, and a nice faint smokey flavor that makes this stand apart from a lot of other barrel aged stouts. Definitely up their with my favorite bourbon barrel aged coffee stouts which includes the likes of BCBCS, KBS, and BA Speedway. Only wish this was more available. 1,300 charactersMarcWP, Jan 31, 2014

Appearance: Pours black as night, opaque, with a 2 finger light brown crown that shows some retention and nice lace.
Smell: From greatest to least = Roast malt (a touch black patent ashy, although it could be from the coffee roast), Vanilla cream, coffee, and bourbon. Think iced coffee with a dash of ashtray and trace of bourbon.
Taste: Vanilla cream and ashtray.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied but it vacillates btw creamy and watery at times...weird! 
Overall: This was probably a very good beer 1-2 years ago. I'm late to the game on this one. 608 characterskoopa, Dec 29, 2013

Appearance - Dark brown colour with an average size frothy light brown head. I can't make out the amount of carbonation showing and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for 3-4 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon
Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and bitter coffee. There is also some boozy bourbon flavours and a light woodiness.
Overall - Bitter yet smooth. I really enjoy the regular peche and this is even better. I'd like to have access to this beer all year long. A great sipper and the perfect end to a crappy week. 692 charactersspinrsx, Sep 28, 2013

From a bottle into a snifter
November 2012 and August 2010
Review is for the 2012 with comments on the 2010 for comparison purposes 
APPEARANCE: A clear dark brown pour yields a one finger, looser looking, fizzy, light mocha colored head with lousy retention. Head quickly fizzes down to a half wisp and ring. Black body with no carbonation evident. A ring and swirly wisp remain with light dots of lacing down the glass. The 2010 was exactly the same. Lousy, fizzy head with an okay body. 
SMELL: Lots of coffee and burnt espresso beans on the nose. Some sweet cream as well, with mild bourbon barrel, oak and vanilla notes. Very bold nose with the coffee still the main act of the show. The 2010 was much different. While it is still a decadent treat, the added time has allowed the coffee to fade and made the nose more mellow overall. More bourbon on the 2010 in comparison, though it is still forthcoming enough to make it enticing. 
TASTE: Very potent and bold flavors for sure. Roasted coffee beans, sweet cream and more potent bourbon barrel up front. Caramel, oak, vanilla and alcohol into a bold and lingering finish. Lots of bitter, burnt coffee beans, sweet cream and caramel, bitter dark chocolate, bourbon barrel and some booze. Very bold and strangely balance; this is still a coffee stout first with a well-measured bourbon barrel as a supporting act. The 2010 has less coffee, so it's much more a bourbon barrel stout. Still, the 2010 is very flavorful and bold, but the emphasis is just a little difference. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy enough, goes down slightly abrasive and finishes sticky on the palate. Some heat lingers. The 2010 is lighter and harsher going down. 
OVERALL: Really good. Huge and flavorful. The nose needs to hold back a touch on the coffee and the feel needs to be a bit fuller to support the flavors, which would make this unreal. The vintages are definitely different, with the 2012 still being a coffee stout first and the 2010 being more of a bourbon barrel stout at this stage, but either way, both are excellent, excellent beers. Thanks again for this opportunity Rutager. World class stuff. 2,365 charactersJeffo, Sep 23, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From notes. Poured from a 341 mL bottle into a snifter.
Nearly black in appearance, there is a vague cranberry tint that is more noticeable at the edges. A small foamy tan cap rests on top off the beer until it slowly fades away.
The aroma has a big espresso nose with subdued bourbon notes. There are some dark roasted malts and chewy fudge notes as well.
Each sip starts with fully roasted malt and some dark chocolate. It is less creamy and sweet than the regular version. The bourbon comes through along with a bit of oak and vanilla. Toward the end, a hint of coffee turns into bitter coffee grounds, which I could really do without, but this finishes the sip.
The body is a little bit lighter than what I would ideally want from a 9.5% bourbon barrel stout. There is a noticeable dry nature to this beer from the barrel, especially compared to the base beer. The coffee imparts a somewhat acrid mouthfeel as well, and it is grainy throughout.
I would have expected barrel aging Péché Mortel would have made a great beer even better, but it simply is not the case. I would rather have the regular version, and it is conveniently much easier to come by as well. 1,172 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jul 03, 2013

A - Pours pitch black with a small half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a thin film, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Rather dead if I'm honest.
S - Smells of deeply roasted coffee, oak, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malt, warm bourbon booze. Still has quite a bit of coffee for its overall age, pretty impressive aroma.
T - Starts off with a mild coating sweetness - mainly the chocolate, vanilla and fresh toffee - quickly being joined by the warm bourbon, woody oak and plenty of dark roast. Finish is pretty dry thanks to all the roast and booze, lingering long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. This is definitely a big beer but the feel kind of got away from it. If it could be bumped up a bit this one would be money.
O - I had wanted to try this one for awhile and I am glad I finally got to try it. It still packs plenty of the base flavors and the bourbon is a complement rather than the star, as it always should be. I would love to have this again. 1,158 charactersorangesol, Jun 16, 2013
4.68/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pitch black with a chestnut head that lasts and laces. Tiny bubbles. Beautiful beer.
S: Rich dark chocolate, a perfect cup of coffee, flaky dessert pastry, sweet vanilla. Earthy, complex, wonderfully nuanced. 
T: Earthy/fruity coffee first, then intense bittersweet chocolate, caramelized buttery dark fruit. Long finish of bourbon barrel vanilla and coffee. The coffee's acidity brings a beautiful 'brightness' to this. Rich and intensely satisfying. Full mouthfeel without being syrupy. The barrel character is so well integrated, it doesn't dominate the other elements.
This is easily my favorite beer with coffee in it. Better in bottle than on tap. 659 charactersmattsander, Jun 14, 2013

A - Poured a nice super rich dark black hue with a good creamy one finger mocha head that leaves thick side lacing. So, so good.
S - Aroma is just bourbon and chocolate The bourbon and chocolate and barrel lends a nice coconut aroma here. Super, super rich with awesome espresso notes here. An already epic peche mortel made even better with bourbon. Argh!
T - Taste is just as epic. I could drink this all day. Tons of bourbon, espresso, chocolate, barrel, roast malts, light coconut. Unfathomably good. Great vanilla notes too!
M - Mouthfeel is so silky smooth and creamy. Lightly carbonated, soo velvety.
O - Overall this beer is well worth the hype. So freaking good here. The bourbon makes this incredible and the vanilla and chocolate..gah...I need some bottles.... 848 charactersrudzud, Jun 14, 2013

A: Pours pitch black with about a half finger of dark khaki colored head. The foam dissipates very quickly, leaving only a thin ring of bubbles along the edges of the glass. There is very little lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is wood, vanilla, mild roast, and mild bourbon heat. It's so woody. It smells great.
T: It starts out sweet light roast, vanilla, and milk chocolate. The barrel ageing comes through immediately after. It's super woody, with vanilla and caramel playing off each other perfectly. As the beer moves to the back end it gets bitter with roast, toast, and dark chocolate. The bourbon notes shine through as well.
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and coating to start, sits on the palate for a bitas the flavors shift, then lingers long after the beer is gone. The finish is wood, bitters, and bourbon.
O: This beer is pretty excellent, but I do have one complaint. I get zero coffee out of this beer. It's like the barrel aging of this beer dominates the rich coffee notes in the base beer. I get a massive amount of wood, and almost no coffee at all. The beer is still quite good, it's just not what I was expecting to taste. 1,195 characterstrxxpaxxs, May 21, 2013

A: Black, almost no head. Pours very dense.
S: Nose is on coffee and chili pepper, which is quite surprising because this is completely absent from the regular version. Spices, light vanilla, but overall the bourbon is not much present.
T: The palate is very much on coffee with a light woody sweetness, notes of bitter chocolate; with chili and spices. Finishes on coffee bitterness.
M: Thick, not much carbonated. Finishes warmth but with a welcome dryness.
O: A very good version of the Péché Mortel. I really can't know why there were those chilies in this bottle as it doesn't appear in other reviews but we all got this from the nose and palate. Anyway it was still really drinkable and enjoyable. Thanks Franck! 784 charactersFux, May 20, 2013

The beer pours a deep dark black with 1/2 an inch of a dense tan head that fades into nothing more than a thin blanketing within a minute. Mild lacing. The nose is definitely still the potent coffee-forward imperial stout I expected with little from the bourbon barrels except for an aromatic woodiness. The taste is definitely still a hardcore coffee stout with a touch of bitterness, molasses, and bourbon in the finish. It's obviously full bodied, but not too boozy. The coffee bitterness clashes against the big malty, slightly caramely sweetness. However, I'm not seeing the bourbon nearly as much as expected compared to the non-BA version. It's certainly a delicious beer, but I don't think it's worth the USA-Canada trade if you're able to get the regular version easily. 809 charactersThePorterSorter, May 11, 2013

Score: 95
2011 vintage bottle served in a Cigar City snifter and enjoyed on 04/20/13. Review is from iPhone notes
Appearance: Pours a coffee color with a thin layer of pale tan head that settles to a ring around the glass. Poor lacing, slightly below average retention. 4/5
Smell: Coffee grounds, chocolate, vanilla and smooth bourbon with no alcohol bite. Some roast, a little leather too. A really balanced, inviting nose. 4.5/5
Taste: Vanilla, balanced and not overpowering bourbon flavor and roasty coffee. Bitter coffee, roast and vanilla aftertaste for the finish. Not very complex, but boy is this tasty! 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, good carbonation. Bittersweet. 4.5/5
Overall: While not the most complex beer, this one absolutely delivered. Roasty and chocolatey with a nice bourbon complexity that does not smack you in the face with bourbon. I'll need to hunt this down again in the future!
Cost: $8 for a 12 oz bottle. 1,042 charactersjegross2, Apr 24, 2013

Very dark with a medium head. Very very strong on coffee and not anywhere close on bourbon/barrels. Taste is dominated by smooth coffee with some sweetness. A strong tobacco note is present but I wouldn't guess that this was -bal aged. Very different from other barrel coffee stouts but good in its own way. 332 characterstewaris, Apr 23, 2013

The creamy head immediately brings a café latté to mind, has a deep brown color, almost mahagony. The taste is very deep, complex and layared. First, the toasted malts and coffee beans assault the palate, leaving a dry yet rich mouthfeel. After the second sip, the bourbon aging becomes apparent, vanilla tastes and a sublte tang pile on, staying slightly longer than the coffee taste. 
Absolutely delicious. Try with a very dark chocolate, maybe some dried fruit like cranberries. 574 charactersBurnduri, Mar 19, 2013

4.97/5  rDev +11.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Pours pitch black, with mocha colored head. Head volume and retention is decent considering the beer has been aged. Very thick, lots of alcohol legs and lacing.
S: Exactly like I imagined my favorite beer to age (the regular version in bottles gets very very good after 6 months in the cellar). Lots of smoke, pepper and vanilla from the bourbon. Definitely still is the Peche Mortel I love. Lots of powdered cacao, dark dried red berries, coffee. Maybe a subtle hint of citruses coming from the hops.
T: Lots of good things, just like the smell. Powdered cacao, vanilla, smoke, pepper, dark red berries, coffee and citruses make for the perfect smelling beer. This is fantastic stuff, highly recommended.
M: Just what you'd expect, big, bold, sticky, with smooth carbonation. 
O: Fantastic brew, definitely worth the 16$ for the 4 pack. Really really good stuff. 870 charactersflipper2gv, Feb 26, 2013

Bottled November 2012
Bourbon barrel aged for 1 year.
Poured from the bottle into a Hunahpu's snifter.
A: Poured dark with a reddish brown tinge. In the glass, it is midnight black. 1/4 finger of off white, brownish head (lighter than the regular Peche) that dissipated fairly quickly. When the glass is held up to the light, there are blood red notes on the curves of the glass.
S: A non-overpowering but very upfront note of bourbon and vanilla. Followed by coffee and way in the back, a little chocolate. Solid nose.
T: Interesting. Only when I put it up against the regular Peche did I notice the differences. The barrel has seemed to subdue the "brightness" of the coffee and chocolate of the regular Peche. The chocolate seems to be sweeter, and the coffee notes not as fresh, or pungent. The coffee bitterness definitely seems to be turned down by the barrel, and the sweetness is turned up. A slight bit of vanilla becomes apparent in the back of the pallet.
M: Great, medium to full bodied mouth feel. On the lower side of carbonation is expected for spending a year in the barrel and contributes to the sweetness.
O: A great beer that is not your typical barrel aged bourbon bomb. The bourbon is there, but it contributes to accenting and altering the characteristics found in the regular Peche. To be honest, when I was first sipping on the 2013 BA Peche, I was searching for the barrel. It's subtle, but there if you look for it. This beer, for me, is not a "punch you in the face" bourbon forward imperial stout. Very interesting and not necessarily what I was expecting. Very different from the previous bottled batch. A beer to seek out and see how it compares to the likes of BCBCS or BA Speedway.
Cheers. 1,839 charactersmontrealbcr89, Feb 21, 2013

Belated big ups are in order to Mike ('hoser', on this site) from Artisan Ales, the rep for this venerable Quebecois brewery, out he-air in Alberta, who flipped me a single of this after a rather enjoyable and random run-in at a new-ish Edmonton hipster (I was only there for the beer, I swear!) resto-pub back in the summer of oh-twelve. Mad, silly props, my man.
This beer pours a dark, ill-boding colourless mire, with the slightest of forced basal mahogany highlights, and two fingers of puffy, densely foamy dark tan head, which leaves some randomly spectral swaths of lace around the glass as it readily recedes.
It smells of astringently woody oak barrels - soused 2x4s, for starters, a seemingly dry vanillan and dusty caramel candy sucker essence, muffled spiced whisky, subtle coffee grounds, and some singed, oily bar-top nuts. The taste is bittersweet medium chocolate, softly spicy bourbon barrel notes - wet wood, thin caramel, muted vanilla, and perky alcohol the most prominent - semi-sweet morning after coffee, sturdy, if a bit inherently confused toffee malt, and rather muted earthy, musty hops.
The carbonation is pretty much drowned and lost in the sands of time, the body medium-full in weight, and smooth, in that heavy, hearty whisky sense of things. It finishes on the sweet side, predictably, as the booze, wood, malt, and fruit esters all conspire to keep the aspirant dry coffee and bitter hops in check.
A bit of a changeling of an affair - first it's a whisky, then it's a strong beer, and then it's a... well, you get the point. Overall, it blends ably enough, and yet maintains a stellar heft, insomuch as to conflate the average ingenue as to its actual origins - an effect sought after by any and all brewers, I would surmise. A pleasure to experience, and while maybe not appropriate for all comers, I am now more than enthused to have seen what the top rated Canadian-made stout can do when upwardly challenged. 2,005 charactersbiboergosum, Jan 30, 2013

A - Light tan head ... good lacing, black in color, with light only coming through the edges

M - Silky smooth
O - I was glade I sought this out... thanks for the trade BlogueDeBieres!! I was however expecting a bit more from this beer being aged in bourbon barrels.

Pours very dark brown with a thin mocha head that recedes fairly quickly into a thin collar. The nose brings a good amount of oak alongside bourbon and some backing vanilla.

I'd been holding it to share with some other guys but got impatient and ended up opening it at home during a sunday night Packers/NYG game. It pours a dark brown color, opaque with a mocha colored foam that laces intermittently.
There's a surprising amount of coffee in the aroma, given the barrel aging I'd expect the coffee to be mellowed. The bourbon comes through with a light touch, giving an aroma more-or-less reminiscent of BA Speedway. Lots of dark sweet malts giving a sweet smell throughout, but the primary olfactory attributes are from the coffee and the bourbon (mixing in a very good way). Maybe just a hint of a sour note in the background, worrying me into thinking there might be an infection starting...
It tastes awesome, again similar (although not quite identical) to BA Speedway. Initial bourbon flavors give way to sweet roasted malts, with a lasting coffee flavor providing the aftertaste (with a little belly burn). No infection in the taste thank God.
The beer is thinner than I'd like, nearly medium bodied but I'd have liked more viscosity to match the flavors. I'm nitpicking here though, as the standard Peche Mortel isn't any thicker than this barrel aged version, so what should I expect? A little higher in carbonation than expected too (again nitpicking).
Thanks very much Mike, I'm really glad to have tried this! Too bad I didn't share it with anyone, but really with a 12oz bottle I kinda want it all to myself anyway. 1,495 charactersTurdFurgison, Nov 26, 2012
4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours black as night, with a finger of medium to dark coloured head. Leaves a bit of lacing and dissipates to a foamy ring. 
The aroma is of glorious bourbon. Intense, but not overwhelming and not too weak at all. Vanilla, and wood mingle in as well. Though some age on this, the coffee is still there, and quite nice considering the age. There's really nothing to complain about with the aroma. 
Tastes awesome. The only notch is heat is a bit up there. Very roasty, with a big bourbon note, vanilla and accompanying woodiness. There's a surprising amount of roasted coffee as well. 
The feel is good, creamy, somewhat slick. Not quite as full bodied for the style. 
Overall, it's fantastic. Other than a less than perfect mouthfeel, this thing is the whole package! Wish it wasn't so limited! 798 charactersEgadBananas, Nov 25, 2012

***2011 Vintage (aged 9 months)***
Had this at the International Péché Mortel day at the brewpub.
Appearance: A really black body with no head. Thick & opaque.
Smell: If i thought the special edition smelled like coffee liquor, this even more. Blurs the line between a beer and a spirit. Bourbon yet never boozy with traces of vanilla.
Taste: Bourbon leaves the heat a bit. While i get some coffee, the bourbon completely overtakes and subdues it. They mesh well but it's clear who's in control.
Mouthfeel: Surprised by its mellowness. No carbonation, a bit viscous but not overly so. Very mouth coating.
Overall: I wasn't blown away by it. A great beer for sure but not as good as the regular or special edition IMO. Hope to see them bottle this to compare.
Serving type: cask
FOLLOWING REVIEWED AUG. 20, 2012:
***2010 Vintage (aged 1 year in bourbon barrels)***
First beer that i review twice with two different serving types.
Poured from a 341ml. bottle, bottled 08/11.
Appearance: A dense brown body with 1-2 fingers of creamy head the color of espresso foam. Retention is average. probably due to barrel-aging. Some lacing is evident.
Smell: Oh my! Simply stellar. Roasted coffee and nuts, chocolate mixed with oak & vanilla. Bourbon soaked wood that melds perfectly with the coffee/dark chocolate. Charred wood as well.
Taste: Intense chocolate, coffee beans lined with bourbon. Vanilla notes as well as oak appear in the finish. At no point does this feel harsh. Like liquid candy.
Mouthfeel: Initial sip is smooth, slight alcohol kick appears but then reverts back to a creamy smoothness. The aftertaste has a bit of bourbon sting but feels mellow.
Overall: Remarkably well balanced and drinkable. Enjoyed it more than on cask. Sublime and doesn't hit you over the head with intensity. 1,843 characterspapat444, Aug 20, 2012

Aroma of bourbon is quite dominant with some good notes of coffee and vanilla which are really well balanced. Taste is a very nice mix between some coffee notes which are very floral and not too dry or astringent with some notes of vanilla and a bourbon finish which is quite powerful. Body is full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation with light warming alcohol notes from bourbon. I really enjoyed this one with a nice balance between the vanilla and the coffee – the only downside is maybe the beer spent a bit too much time in the barrel. 673 charactersPhyl21ca, Aug 17, 2012

Black with a brown head. Good retention and some lacing. Nose is similar to the regular Peche, coffee, espresso and cocoa. Light oak and the bourbon character is modest enough to let the base Peche still remain prominent. Taste has bourbon, espresso, cocoa. Alot of Peche character still remains, and the bourbon wraps itself in and around it - doesn't dominate the beer but does it's best to compliment. More oak, brown sugar and a bit of bourbon in the finish. Medium heavy body, viscous but not overbearing. Low carbonation elevates the drinkability of this. Brilliant BBA beer, really lived up to the hype for me. 672 charactersliamt07, Jun 21, 2012

Served side by side with the standard Péché Mortel.
The beer is dark brown with a small, beige head that leaves almost no lacing on the snifter. The dominant aromas are oak and bourbon, followed by a roasty, coffee presence. The flavor follows suit. The delectable coffee character I enjoy so much in the standard version is a bit overrun by the dominant bourbon barrel flavors. That said, this is still a very tasty beer. A nice, warming finish shows a bit of the alcohol. While this was most definitely a nice treat, I would have to give the nod to the plain ol' Péché Mortel. 624 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 04, 2012

At the time of this review, this is #28 on the 'Top Beers - American Double / Imperial Stout" and #11 on the "Top Beers - Canada" list.
Beer is black and has a smaller head than the original but it is there, brown small bubbles, some lacing, moderate carbonation to low carbonation.
Aroma is sweet, oaky, mildly bourbon.
Beer is oakier and less bitter than the original, it is good though, but the barrel / bourbon character is really low. Vanilla and oak on the end, dryer on the finish. Decent but not excellent, I'd have it again. 651 charactersdrabmuh, May 29, 2012

A - Dark black with a small amount of espresso coloured head that quickly receded to a ring around the glass. Very spotty lacing. 
S - Huge dark roasted espresso up front that gives way to some bourbon, vanilla and roasted malt aromas. 
T - Bitter dark roasted coffee up front that gives way to charred oak and roasted malt flavours in the middle. The finish is where most of the barrel characteristics show up - with some sweet bourbon and a hint of vanilla. The flavours are very well integrated with the bourbon being present without dominating as it does in many barrel aged beers.

O - This beer is near perfect.  Absolutely amazing example of the style. 826 charactersTheSevenDuffs, May 27, 2012

A- What is there to say? It's black as black can be. No light escaping and you are presented with a booming three finger dark tan head that slowly drops to a thin cap with chunky lacing everywhere. Looks almost creamy.
S- Booming assault of espresso and bourbon. Brown sugar, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, oak, and a touch of brewers licorice. There is a touch of booziness in the nose that warms the nostrils a little bit but I don't mind!
T- Bourbon right up at the front, followed by a nice char taste, than vanilla, a little booze and finishing off with coffee and chocolate. This is magnifiient, I enjoy how the bourbon is there but not overbearing that you can't pick out the finer things in it. The coffee really shines and that is a great thing.
M- Medium to full bodied, creamy with a touch of carbonation. Slight alcohol warmth follows close by.
O- How do you perfect the most perfect coffee stout ever made? Throw it in a bourbon barrel and let it sit. I'm glad to have tried this, will definitely seek again and I even happier such a renowned beer is a product of Canada! 1,248 characterskorguy123, Apr 30, 2012

Totally black with a small tan head that dissipates quickly.
Bourbon stands out strongly in the nose. A very nice smell but it really dominates the rest of the beer.
The taste is a different story. The regular coffee and cocoa flavours of Peche Mortel are clearly present, but nicely complemented by bourbon and oak, the bourbon being more present than the oak. Some vanilla in the finish. The barrel effect is very well integrated- present but not overpowering. Very nice.

A - Super dark mocha brown foam settles to a few wisps and thin collar, leaving minimal lace. Body is very dark brown, a tad lighter shade appearing at the fringes.
S - Massive bourbon and oak presence, but mingling with intense dark roast coffee. I imagine they must have continuously added coffee during and after barrel-aging, as this is still quite fresh smelling. The coffee mingling with the oak gives this a light acidity, and there's perhaps a touch of booze, but these are minor quibbles. Intense dark roast, vanilla, and chocolate-covered caramel round things out.
T - Taste is similarly excellent, with intense coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, a hint of smoke, and char, and oaky and vanilla-heavy bourbon in the finish. Coffee and oak yield a mild bitterness and acidity, but nothing excessive.
M - Smooth medium body, medium-low carbonation, a bit of alcohol warmth, and a dry and tannic finish. I was concerned that this beer might thin out too much in the barrels, as standard Péché Mortel isn't the biggest beer. Somehow this has managed to maintain its heft - curious if the batch intended for barrels was tweaked a bit.
D - Awesome stuff. Looking forward to sharing a bottle with my wife when I finally get my hands on my stash this summer. A superb take on an already excellent beer. Worth the nuisance of international trading. 1,509 charactersMasterSki, Apr 06, 2012

A nice surprise from the most generous hoser, I`m pretty stoked I had a few of the newer version in the mail because this is one I want to age and revisit. Get this one if you can boys and girls. 956 characterswordemupg, Apr 02, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Shared by dsgolovin. Thanks, David.
Appearance: Similar to regular Peche Mortel, pouring an impenetrable pitch black. Carbonation is at a lower-moderate level, and the head doesn't linger long.
Smell: Great barrel aromatics, a huge caramel and vanilla bourbon presence that wafts above the strong coffee and char foundation. The intense coffee character of Peche Mortel hasn't faded in the slightest despite time spent in barrels. 
Taste & mouthfeel: Coffee is even bigger on the palate, with a bittersweet espresso flavor that works well with the richness the barrel provides. This is quite a bit sweeter than regular Peche, it's vanilla, cocoa and caramel laden, though the finish remains fairly dry and coffee-forward with a bit of ashy bitterness.
Overall: Excellent, up there with KBS and other greats of the style. 824 characterslargadeer, Mar 21, 2012

4.2/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This lacing is thick, long lasting, inky darkness. Very great light bread body. 
Sweet vanilla acting like cream right before the huge coffee nose. Big espresso bitterness, oh my gosh espresso. It also has.... A shockingly roasted grain to complement the bitterness of coffee. Gosh. Light vegetation on the last note...
Tastes creamy smooth finishes bourbon heat without the sharpness. The coffee is light, folgers, oxidized. This barrel gives great vanilla, vegetal bite, hut not much else. 
Pretty solid, some claim not as good as base beer, I like it for what it is. 572 charactersKhazadum, Mar 21, 2012
4.66/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap at Jimmy's No. 43 in New York, NY
A: Pours a very dark brown almost black in color with some hints of reddish brown when held up to the light. The beer has a thin tan head that reduces to some thin patches and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing is observed.
S: Lots of coffee/espresso notes with more subtle hints of the dark roasted malts, some bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and hints of oak. There are light hints of bourbon that become more pronounced as the beer warms.
T: Follows the aroma of the beer...starts with the dark roasted malts and some sweetness upfront, then moved into the coffee/espresso flavors which are very strong, followed by the bittersweet chocolate + vanilla, and the finish is all bourbon. The flavors of the bourbon and the charred oak definitely get stronger as the beer warms.
M: Medium bodied with low to moderate amounts of carbonation. Creamy.
O: Didn't think that one of my favorite beers could be improved upon or get any better but the bourbon barrel aging made this one even more excellent. I wish I had access to this beer all the time because I could be content to sip on it every evening. Great balance of flavor between the coffee and the bourbon. 1,242 charactersdbrauneis, Mar 19, 2012
4.35/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Jimmy's No. 43, New York, NY
A: The beer is essentially jet black in color and has traces of amber near the edges of the glass when it is held up to the light. It poured with a patch of bubbles in the center of the glass and a thin ring around the edge.
S: There are moderately strong aromas of bourbon in the nose, even before the beer begins to warm up.
T: The taste has a great balance between flavors of bourbon and coffee beans, both of which are prominent but neither of which are overpowering. As the beer begins to warm up the bourbon flavors become stronger.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and very smooth on the palate with a low to moderate amount of carbonation. There is warming from the alcohol in the finish; this becomes stronger as the beer warms up.
O: This is a very nice barrel aged beer. The alcohol is well hidden, except for that which comes through from the bourbon barrel aging. 918 charactersmetter98, Mar 19, 2012
4.47/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours with slightly less head than regular peche. Slight lacing and a little less retention.
The aroma has great bourbon richness to it with a little less intensity to the coffee. A little sharper but slightly subtle still.
The taste is well balanced between the coffee and the bourbon. While it's slightly richer the body is thinner and a little less intense. It definitely seems a bit more universally appealing but the sharp bitterness of regular peche is missing. The bitterness does build up quite well by the end though. The appeal just built up till the end.
The body is medium/heavy and the finish is fairly dry and sticky.
Overall, a great version of peche. I slightly prefer it to the regular and i'm really glad I got the chance to try it. I'd love to try this on tap. A slightly thicker body would make this perfect. 832 charactersBBP, Feb 26, 2012
4.57/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz bottle into Darkness tulip.
A - Pours black, light mocha-colored head, spotty lace, thin collar.
S - Excellent combo of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. The coffee is right up front and stands out the most, while the chocolate and bourbon are less intense and create an excellent level of complexity. There's also notes of vanilla, light roast, cream, and oak. Such good stuff!
T - The coffee isn't as pronounced here, instead, melding with the sweetness of burnt sugars and chocolate and light bourbon barrel notes. All very-well done and simply stunning. Other notes of vanilla, burnt sugars, and coffee beans. When all combined together, this stuff is just lovely. Finish is bitter coffee and dark chocolate with light creamy bourbon barrel.
M - Full, rich and smooth, light carbonation, creamy finish.
O - This is a stunner. Dieu Du Ciel has created one helluva beer that surprisingly beats out the non-barrel aged version. I didn't think the regular Péché Mortel could be improved upon, but I was wrong. This stuff is ready to drink now, no need to age. One of the best bourbon barrel-aged beers in recent memory. Get this. 1,139 charactersSean9689, Feb 20, 2012

4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Great big thanks to BlogueDeBieres for this bottle!
A - Dark brown body looking basically opaque and black. A moderate brown head forms and retreats quickly to a thick ring
S - Damn. A coffee presence blends brilliantly with light notes of chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, a light alcohol, and a bit of the bourbon
T - Sweet chocolate and roasted toffee, a touch of caramel. Bourbon comes through more here and is present in the back of the taste most of all. Bits of dark fruits are also here in the back. Very nice taste here.
M - Smooth and pretty thick, a bit drying, verging on mild astringency.
O - this is a really great beer. The base is of course a great beer, and the barrel merely compliments it nicely, and does not get in the way. 748 charactersColdPoncho, Feb 07, 2012

4.07/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle thanks to BlogueDeBieres. Thanks a ton. Bottled 08/11 I think. Neck label reads: Reserve speciale 2010, vieillie 1 an en fut de Bourbon.
A - Pours black with one finger of creamy medium brown head. Lot's of carbonation coming up. Great thick lace around with a film of head left over.
S - Wood and coffee. Espresso. Chocolate is there too. Bourbon is pretty strong.
T - Woah. The barrel aging is clear here. Tons of oaky/woody notes and a huge bourbon character. The chocolate and coffee blend in but are mostly taken over by the spirits. There's definitely some roasty/coffee/chocolate notes there but the bourbon is really taking the wheel. All said, it's delicious.
M - Good carbonation, full body with a bit of an alcoholic whisky note and bitterness.
O/D - It's hard to find notes of the original Peche in the BA version. I'm torn on this. With more evidence of the original, it would be a tremendous beer. Yet with the dominance of the barrel aging, it gains something, but loses something as well. It's delicious, complex, and very drinkable, so I can't really complain. A delicious offering from DDC. I just wish the bourbon wasn't so dominant. 1,164 charactersbylerteck, Jan 20, 2012

4.75/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap for black Wednesday at the brewpub.
Pours a dark and opaque blackish red, no light gets through, thin light brown head forms and settles down to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spots and legs stick, looks nice.
Smell is really intense, huge toffee and caramel, vanilla, coffee and espresso roast, biscuit, insane malty, some raisin and sweet fruit through the middle, lightly buttery wood, oaky, alcohol, prunes, more coffee, chocolate milk, crazy.
Taste is similar, sweet toffee, treacle, chocolate milk with an espresso shot, a bit boozy but super smooth through the middle, biscuit, vanilla, oak, nice woody character, not overdone, more coffee and caramel, more vanilla and oak, intense finish, smooth.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, buttery smooth, with low carbonation. Bit of warmth from the alcohol but super smooth. Wow, didn't think Peche Mortel could get better but I was wrong, this is a masterpiece. 936 charactersViggo, Jun 14, 2011

6 months in bourbon barrel.
Black with red hues. Rich creamy tan head. Coffee grounds and sweet vanilla on the nose, some earthy notes. Medium bodied and round, slick and smooth with slippery alcohol on the finish. Sweet vanilla, fresh cream, tree bark, charcoal, coffee and oak flavors. Smooth and delicious. Smells like espresso grounds but not much of the grit on the palate. Better than the original. Less harsh. 490 charactersSFLpunk, Jun 30, 2009
