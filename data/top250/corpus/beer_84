I smell a crap ton of pretty potent, mossy wood, almost peaty. This woodiness is, unfortunately, largely succeeding in tamping down other elements that shyly present themselves as toasted nuts, raisin, prune, fig, apple butter, and bourbon.
Oh my god. Divine. Taste is nothing like the nose. Silky smooth, really rich fig comes first--this feels like a gift from the gods. Elements from the nose, such as the overwhelming woodiness, are subdued nicely, with a little charred tobacco and leather coming in, followed by decadent caramel, luxurious dark cherries and brown sugar.
Despite the very high ABV, BB4D is soft, round, and goes down easily, finishing faintly dry. The booze is only barely there and very well integrated. Are my ears red yet? 945 charactersSabtos, Dec 15, 2016

Pours a dark brown color with a quickly disappearing khaki brown head.
Smells of unsweetened coconut shell, earth and scented wood, enriched by dried grapes and old oak. Offers a nice Bourbon spiciness which gets entangled into toasted nuts and grilled corn. Surprisingly earthy, focussing on the barrel without turning just a tad too sweet, creating a spicy, warm complexity on the nose which is awesome. 
Drinks truly soft, establishing a great silkness, which unfolds the Bourbon in all its powerfull facets. Its hot bite gets balanced by the rich toasty malt base, creating a powerful, complex beer.
Tastes of sugar glazed malts, a hint of licorice, dusty woodbark and toasty, bready malts. Spicy, sweet cinnamon and bakers chocolate add to the malt backbone, while a warming Boubon sharpness slowly becomes more and more recognizable. Ends sweet with a well integrated booziness, showcasing even more tongue tickling spices and toasty toffee malts. Finished very clean and soft, with a heavy Bourbon appearance defining the taste.
Masterfully balanced, intense beer, reminding of a Barley Wine at first glance, which from there on transforms into something different. All flavors work very harmoniously together, exhibiting a slowly uprising Bourbon sweetness which reveals a respectable amount of earth and bread. At its peak sweet toffee and scented wood add to the taste, never forgetting its rustic, bready roots. Finishes utmost clean after revealing its breathtaking complexity,  calm after unleashing an intense flavor storm on the palate. Despite its taste intensity the beer drinks incredibly soft and almost easy if it wasn't for the perfectly integrated Bourbon, which works so good with the beers profound malt foundation. 1,887 charactersaleigator, Jul 17, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I got a bottle of Kuhnhenn's Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia.  I've been wanting to try this beer ever since I first heard of Kuhnhenn, I've had 4D before, but I'm really excited to tr the bourbon barrel aged version, so lets see how it goes.  2015 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz gold foiled bottle into a teku.
A-  The label looks good, it's got a clean and classy look to it, it's a little eye catching.  It poured a hazy brown color that took on more of a ruby and crimson hue when held to the light with a quarter fingers worth of bubbly tan head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left lots of little spotty lacing behind.  This is a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.  
S-  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with a huge caramel aroma being the first to show up with lots of sweet malts and caramel malts and there's a little bit of a butterscotch like aroma showing up in the background.  Up next comes the bourbon barrel which are noticeable and they blend perfectly with the other aromas and it imparts some bourbon, oak and and little bit of a vanilla aroma.  Up next comes a little bit of an alcohol aroma with an toasted marshmallow aroma showing up towards the end.  This beer has a very good aroma, all the different aspects work perfectly together.  
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with that same big caramel aspect being the first to show up and it's followed by the sweet malts and caramel malts, this time the butterscotch barely shows up.  Up next comes the bourbon barrel which imparts a noticeable bourbon flavor and it's a little less woody than it was in the aroma with that same noticeable alcohol aspects that I got in the aroma and I think it's hidden fairly well for being over 13% abv.  Towards the end there's a little bit of bitterness with some warming alcohol and a little more sweetness with the toasted marshmallow coming right at the end with the caramel showing up in the aftertaste and it developed a little bit of dark fruit flavor.  This beer tastes fantastic, all the flavors work very well together.  
M-  Fairly smooth, a little warming, slightly cloying, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is very good and it works well with this beer.  
Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was world class example of the style, to me it has everything that big, dark, bold and strong beer should have, all the bases are covered and all the flavors work so well together it's hard to tell where one starts and another begins.  This beer has nice drinkability, one is the perfect amount for me, it's a great sipping beer.  What I like the most about this beer is how well all the flavors come together and the balance is awesome.  What I like the least about this beer is nothing, there isn't anything at all that I would change.  I would buy this beer if I ever had the chance to and I would recommend it to anyone who like big barrel aged beer.  All in all I was very impressed with this beer, it's just as great as I hoped it would be and it didn't disappoint in the slightest.  IT's now my favorite beer from Kuhnhenn and it's a world class example of the style,  Great job guys, this is a super tasty beer. 3,362 charactersStoutHunter, May 11, 2016

Smell - Sweet booze is noted with dark fruits and sweet malts. 
Taste - My initial impression is chocolate covered raisins with booze. Sweet malts and other dark fruits are present. As the beer warms, sweet chocolate becomes more apparent. The booze is well balanced with the after taste being modestly warm. 
Mouthfeel - The sticky booze and malts really linger. There is some thickness. 
Overall - This is definitely worth seeking. 545 charactersJohnnyHopps, Mar 13, 2016
4.9/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.  Pours burgundy when the flow is viewed through the light, and when collected in the glass, creates a dark-chocolate, almost-black appearance.  A 1 finger thick tan, almost-khaki head, forms, and recedes gradually, leaving beautiful lacing with moderate retention.  The nose is a dry red wine right off the bat when nosed from the bottle., followed by caramel and bourbon.  When nosed from the tulip, the same features are present, but with more emphasis on the caramel and bourbon.  The palate opens with thick, syrupy malt with caramel and sweet bourbon.  The thickness of the beer, and the deep caramel notes mask much of the boozy warmth at first, but the alcohol becomes a touch more noticeable on the backend of the palate.  Hints of fig and currant emerge as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is incredible - one of the thickest, most syrupy beers I've tasted - it complements the beer itself tremendously.  Overall, an incredible beer in a style that is too-little-done in my opinion.  This beer almost tastes as much like a rich English barleywine that's spent some time in bourbon barrels as it does a bourbon barrel old ale (though the dividing line between those style's is admittedly blurry).  Truly a treat to try. 1,260 charactersLAp, Mar 04, 2016

4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. No bottled on date, but this is 2015 vintage, so maybe  2-3 months old at this point.
A: Pours a syrupy-thick, mahogany-brown color. Just a hand-full of bubbles in a very calm beer. Some light getting through.
S: Apricot, fig, maple syrup, plum, dark cherries, vanilla. The bourbon is very faint on first pass, but a good whiff reveals it. Comes through as a more oaky, leathery note, and less wet, fresh bourbon. 
T: Big fig, jam, plum, and caramel notes up front. Some vanilla and toffee in the middle. Finish leaves more of a slightly booze-tinged character than an overt bourbon note, but lets you know that there's some barrel presence there. 
M: Just brilliant. This is about as thick and chewy as you'd want for a barrel-aged beer, regardless of the style. The high-ABV is well hidden. Carbonation level is right in the sweet spot.
O: Kuhnhenn is my hometown brewery, as I grew up a short 15 minutes away. However, I didn't discover it's place in the craft beer universe until 1 or 2 years in. A very small, unique place, Kuhnhenn has a similar ethos to Founder's in that they do it their way. After my first Winter Solstice in 2012, it instantly became one of my favorites. BB4D is a legend, and 3 years later, it still holds up as a classic. This beer, for the style, has it all. It's rich, sweet, decadent, layered, and above all delicious. It's truly an achievement to craft a beer this drinkable and tasty. My only small critique is that I would like a bit more barrel presence here. Not sure if it was more predominant a few years back, but it's just a tad mute here. Maybe I'd have to have it side by side with 4D to truly appreciate it, but bourbon isn't the first thing that comes to my mind when drinking this one. Nonetheless, it's an under-the-radar beer that deserves a bit more acclaim than it already has. 
Recommendation: Mandatory drinking for lovers of all things barrel-aged. 1,967 charactersSparty1224, Feb 11, 2016
4.43/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours super thick.  Dark black with a thin head, and a ring stays throughout the drink.  The smell is of sweet malts, dark fruit, and bready malts.  I don't get a whole lot of wood, bourbon, or vanilla aromas surprisingly. The taste is full of toffee, caramel, and bready malts.  Some oak notes come through on the back end, and there is a splash of alcohol on the finish.  Really good beer. Must drink warmer than colder though.  It got significantly better as the temp rose.   Very nice mouthfeel on this one.  There is a touch of oxidation in this beer more apparent on the nose than the taste. 597 charactershardysf, Feb 10, 2016

Nice layer of film on top and stains the sides with some lacing as it drinks. Fantastic smell. Sweet bourbon, chocolate, date, fig, caramel, marshmallow wow. Taste is more elegant than I would have guessed. Abv is not noticed. Getting plum and charred/roasted fig. Hint of chocolate. Very yummy. A faint hit of carbonation. As thick as it looks, it just has a thin feel to it. The sweetness that while pleasant in smell and taste is a bit cloying. Still an awesome beer. 524 charactersHootie159, Jan 30, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Gold foil capped 12oz bottle from IAmJacksHopTongue (thanks for the awesome Kuhnhenn hook up!). 2015 vintage. Served in a goblet. 
Pours an opaque mahogany with chestnut highlights at the edges. The finger and a half of deep beige head is slow to recede to a modest halo. Scattered small islands of lacing find purchase on the glass. 
Aromas of toffee, dark fruit, leather, earthy oak and faint bourbon. This is one of those beers that I can savor the smell alone so my nose returns to the glass often to do exactly that. 
The bourbon isn't dominant but is much more apparent in the taste than the nose. Caramel, cereal grains, soft bourbony vanilla notes, dark fruit skins, toffee, wet oak, faint spice, earth and a surprisingly light touch of alcohol. Its a wonderful blend of old ale and bourbon barrel. 
Creamy, full feel with pillowy, light carbonation. A blend of raisins, slightly oxidized fruit, caramel and bourbon soaked oak caresses the palate in the finish. 
Kuhnhenn takes their already outstanding Fourth Dementia to the next level with some barrel aging. This is a little more boozey than the base and as expected adds some nice, sweet, complementary barrel notes. Like many of Kuhnhenn's offerings this is worth some effort to try. 1,252 charactersThickNStout, Jan 15, 2016

Best old ale I've ever had. Super dark brown in color and somewhat boozy on the nose, but, man...this is just smooth, caramel coated candy bar without ever being actually sweet. Coating mouthfeel, nice pleasant warming sensation. Truly wonderful. 
I was hesitant to crack this, now I wish I had a few more. Much better than I expected, as I'm not typically a huge fan of the style. Definitely a recommended brew. 442 charactersthatoneguymike, Jan 09, 2016

Hopefully once Kuhnhenn expands from current 2500 bbls per year to around 20000 bbls annual we'll all get more to share. 345 charactersdocoman, Dec 18, 2015
4.24/5  rDev -5.8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Not the prettiest beer ever made thats for sure, this was brown for the most part, but would reveal some more fire kind of colors (orange and red) that came out around the edges.  
Aroma was pretty much bourbon and caramel.
Taste was more of the same, add some toffee, thick ass viscosity mouthfeel.  Vanilla comes out, smoke, you could pour this on pancakes while camping and get your day started.  
Solid old ale, 1st tier. 428 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 16, 2015

The flavor is sweet molasses on the palate with dark fruit and nuts, all brought together by the bourbon barrel, in a thick and full body.

Mouthfeel:  Full bodied with low carbonation; some warmth from the ABV
Overall:  Tasting this side by side with the base version from the same bottling year, the Bourbon barrel treatment removes some of the harsh elements in the finish and replaces them with toasted coconut and marshmallow tones; a wondrous beer 719 charactersbrentk56, Oct 11, 2015

Dark mahogony color with a nice fine bubble with a moderate retention time. The nose is filled with dried fall fruits and bourbon soaked oak. The taste follows nicely with major notes of plums, figs, dates, prunes and raisins. There is a moderate barrel presence. 
This was a wonderful treat. The aging process did wonders for this beer. I was blown away. 387 charactersmacher0, Aug 15, 2015

A: Pours a deep amber color. Super murky and dense-looking with just a little cream colored head. 
S: Smell is a touch more faint than I was expecting, but this is still money. Lots of charred oak, a bit of bourbon, burned brown sugar, toffee, maybe a little bit of milk chocolate covered cherry as it warms, along with some toasted coconut and marshmallow. Gets sweeter by the second as it warms.
T: It's everything the smell promises, with a big kick in the teeth from the booze to boot. Heavy molasses mixed with charred oak, cola nut, brown sugar and a little bit of leather. Finish just scrapes across your tongue with charred wood, bourbon, tobacco and warming alcohol. It feels like you have one of those hand warmers you use while you're skiing on your tongue after a few sips. Mouthfeel is absolutely flawless. Rich and velvety without being too heavy. Stands up to the massive flavors and booze without taking away anything. Really, really, really love this one. 987 charactersnotchucknorris, Aug 05, 2015

4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This is the 2014 vintage from the summer solstice. Poured into a snifter this beer has a beige 2 inch thick head with a dark amber brown body. Smell is of wine must, raspberries, cherry, vanilla, bourbon, leather, slight spice, bread-y malt, molasses, dried fruit, plum, oak, and even coconut. Taste is tons of bourbon, cherry, vanilla, dried fruit, a slight warming alcohol (the most balanced alcohol I've had in a beer), caramel, toffee, a little bit of chocolate, lots of leather, wine must, and a nice bread-y malt. The mouth feel is full and the body is medium to full, it is syrupy and smooth, with just a little bit of bite. One of the best beers I've had, and deserving of it's status. 693 charactersjustinp444, Jul 21, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52012 Vintage:
Pours a rich, viscous amber, syrupy in color/appearance. Thin tan head forms with a vigorous pour but dissipates immediately leaving just a trace of a collar. English toffee, burnt sugar, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, oak, and coconut all peak through in the aroma with just the slightest hint of booze. All of these sweet, luscious smells come out in full force in the taste. Incredible depth and richness of flavors; the barrels are prominent but not dominating, instead balancing and complimenting the massive caramel sweetness/toast/oakey vanilla tannins/leather. Once the sweetness begins to drop, you're hit with huge sweet cherries/dates/dark fruit and a lingering hint of booze. Sticky lacing is left clinging to the glass. Mouth feel is full-bodied, sweet, syrupy, but the carbonation level is perfect to move this sweet malt bomb around the palate. Overall, it easily ranks as one of my absolute favorite Old Ales, it's simply fantastic and dangerously quaffable. 987 charactersDan_Inreallife, Apr 23, 2015

Ruby brown color with a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly. Toffee, fruity, vanilla, and light oak with hints of molasses and alcohol make up most of the aroma. Smells quite sweet but I like it. The flavor is sweet and fruity with bits of caramel and burnt sugars. Light vanilla and wood with some solid warming alcohol. Thick body with a sweet sticky mouthfeel. Great sipper! 443 charactersjohnnnniee, Jan 14, 2015

A: Pours a dark, rusty shade of copper with some bright ruby and russet tones
S: Burnt sugar, candied dark cherries, boozy oak, sherry-soaked almond cookies, and coconut
T: Lots of dark cherries and plums, sherry, toffee, and oak. Really nice, somewhat harsh alcohol burn on the finish. Alcohol presence became more pronounced as the beer warmed up (that was a good thing!)
M: Thick and viscous without being heavy
O: A fantastic, top-tier old ale. Loads of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and booze, with some nice fruit undertones. It's a lot like some of the best English-style BA barleywines, but a good deal sweeter and more sherry-forward. I think I favor 4D over BB4D. The regular has a lot of the same aromas and flavors as BB4D, but it was slightly less sweet and lacked the boozy sherry punch that BB4D delivers. I would've liked a bit more bourbon presence - for whatever reason I am picking up a lot of sherry or some kind of sweet liquer - but I'm not complaining. 1,004 charactersblankenhoney, Jan 05, 2015

Nose: see Mother of all Storms. Delightfully deep Rice Krispies, rich plum fruitiness and some really dark, dank chocolate. Smell is right up there with the best.
Taste is just as good, the chocolaty cereal grains are unbelievable. The yeast is there, but not prominent and the great depth of malt is what drives this beer to greatness. Mouthfeel is, unsurprisingly perfect - silky and thick. Alcohol is in check, but prominent and complimentary. Love it. 611 characterstwiggamortis420, Oct 29, 2014

Pours a fairly dark brown, basically opaque, with a small quarter inch head, and basically no lacing.
Smells just incredible, I can't even describe most of it. Dark fruits, caramel, toasted marshallow, toffee, and bourbon. 
One of the most interesting beers I've ever had- like I said before, I can't really even describe most of these flavors. Caramel, raisins, figs, toasted marshmallow, oak, vanilla, cola, sarsaparilla, walnuts, bourbon. The aftertaste is this incredible blast of caramel and bourbon- almost like bourbon-soaked Werther's candy or something. This is just so unique and awesome.
This is fairly thick bodied, with a sweet and mucho syrupy mouthfeel, and a very low amount of carbonation. Although I really want to slowly sip this, it's really hard to not just gulp it down, it's so drinkable.
This might be the best beer I've ever had. While drinking it, I honestly had no idea what was going on. 977 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 27, 2014

'11 vintage
A- Poured into my CCB snifter it is almost black, with dark brown hues around the edges. A tiny wisp of a tan head quickly dissipates, and only miniscule bits of carbonation can be seen rising. Not super pretty, but expected with the style and barrel aging.
S- The aroma is sweet dried/candied fruit bliss! Prunes, raisins, dates, figs, and even some dried pineapple and apricot! A huge malt backbone of caramel and bread. Significant vanilla and oak from the bourbon barrel come through. Hints of dark chocolate, cherry, and blackberry finish things up. As far as the style goes this may be the perfect aroma!
T- The taste follows the aroma pretty well, though there are some additional flavors. The first I noticed was damp tobacco. There is some peat, and a surprising bit of tart cherry. The dark fruits from the aroma are present, but perhaps not as prevalent. Fig and prune are the most noticeable, with raisin following right behind. The caramel and bready malts play a good supporting role. There is a hint of vanilla, but very little of the chocolate from the aroma. Significant amounts of medicinal and alcohol flavors take a bit away from this.
M- The mouth feel is thick, but not overly viscous. A bit sharp with alcohol, medicinal feel, and low carbonation.
O- This was awesome and incredibly complex! I only wish the harsh medicinal and alcohol flavors weren't so pronounced. 1,439 charactersSadMachine, Aug 02, 2014

I really can't taste the difference between this and Regular 4D. I'd rather stick with regular 4D as it's easier to obtain and not quite as costly. 257 charactersbowzer4birdie, Jun 24, 2014

Bourbon, toffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla and caramel sweetness on the nose. Very complex and delicious aroma! Toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses on the palate. Smooth with a little alcohol heat. Outstanding! Full bodied with light carbonation, this beer coats the mouth with velvet smoothness. I'm not an expert in old ales by any stretch of the imagination, but I can't think of a better example of the style than this exemplary crafted beer! 520 charactersJohnG190, May 30, 2014

It pours a muddy looking chestnut brown with almost no head or lacing but tons of boozy legs. The nose is a caramely sweet, bourbon boozy, earthy blend of heaven. The mouthfeel is thick and very sticky. Lots of caramel malts and alcohol to thicken this up. The body is more akin to something cloying like Kahlua or Baileys more than most beers. The flavor is every gorgeous thing that the nose promises. Sweet, boozy, earthy, and rich. This is absolutely outstanding. I can only hope that I can get my hands on some to add to my cellar. 610 characterslochef81, May 22, 2014

A- Poured to a wine glass with a dark brown almost opaque body. Small foamy white head forms but quickly recedes to the edges as a small ring. Spotty lacing for the most part but some nice patches around the glass.
S- Deep bourbon and huge old ale aroma blasts out of the bottle, I could smell it right as I broke the seal. Bourbon is not alcoholic feeling but quite smooth while remaining strong aromatically. Rich caramel sweet base and some raisin, slight cocoa dark malts.
T- Follows the nose very well, rich and decadent old ale with a great barrel bourbon feel blended in. The old ale base reminds me of a less sweet Old Stock, big raisin and dusty aged caramel. Bourbon is a bit peppery and has vanilla oak notes. Slight dusty dark cocoa feel.
MF- Super thick bodied with a semi-creamy but mostly oily feel. Carbonation at a moderate low level but suits what is happening. Finishes with some sweetness and a soothing warmth on the palate.
Right up my alley. Super intense Old Ale flavors and huge but ABV well hidden. The bourbon barrel is strong but the base has a ton complex flavors of its own. 1,296 characterscbutova, Feb 19, 2014

Pours a dark fig color with small tan head that leaves a thin ring around the edge of glass.
Aroma is deep dark fruit, vanilla, bourbon, charred raisin, molasses, leather, prune juice, and faint horse saddle. Oak bounds everything together.
On the palate you get bourbon, raisin, fig, date, caramel, prune, artificial vanilla, brown sugar, cherry cordial, port, and many other things. This is a complex beast! The barrel aging is downright popping the base beer. You get the booziness from the barrels but only enough to help balance out the sweetness. Just tasty as heck!
The mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Medium creamy body with just enough carbonation to add some depth. 
Overall this is a real treat! Would love to have easy access to Kuhnhenn. The best old ale I've had in a 12 ounce format. The second best old ale I've ever had behind Old Stock Cellar Reserve Brandy. And only by a few hairs! I like the way this tastes with a year + on it. Can't help but wonder when the sweet spot is for this. Can see it aging well for years to come. 1,105 charactersMarcWP, Feb 14, 2014
4.71/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer comes in a dark mahoghany color.
The aroma has tons of juicy sweet raisins, figs, plums, and then vanilla and a big toffee, brown, caramel sweetness.
The flavor follows with lots of rich sweetness. Vanilla, molasses, sweet raisins and dried dark fruits. Along with a woody flavor in the middle and then an oak finish on the back.
The barrel does this beer wonders by blunting many notes and melding them into a drippy sweet luscious beer. 450 charactersdar482, Feb 12, 2014

Pours a murky amber capped by a very light beige one and half finger creamy head. Dissipates within a couple of minutes, but above average retention for a BA brew, just a few hints of lacing. Bold nose, deep aroma of dark fruit, oak, brown sugar, toffee all capped by bourbon booziness. Opens with dark fruit including black cherries, sugar plums, prunes and raisins, and hints of dates joined by rich molasses, caramel, and brown sugar, some nuttiness and biscuit accents midpalate. Finishes with toasted oak, vanilla, continued dark fruit, and pleasant bourbon booziness. Low carbonation, syrupy full body that is amazingly smooth and velvety with just a bit of creaminess. This amazing brew is definitely one of my personal favorites. One of, if not the best BA Old Ale available. Whether fresh or aged this ridiculously complex brew delivers. 940 characterschanokokoro, Jan 28, 2014

Pours a dark murky raisin color. It's viscous with little carbonation, exactly what I expected. 
Oh wow it's a sniffer. Dates, figs, and extremely aromatic vanilla and caramel. Brown sugar. Oak. Every time I stick my nose in I find more layers. 
Summed up, flavors are dark and sweet. Heavy on vanilla, caramel, and dates. A little marshmallow. The few years on this bottle really mellows the booze and melds everything else. I'd love to try it fresh sometime. 
Thick body with minimal carbonation. Sipper, but smooth. It drinks heavy but should. The body holds it all together well. 
I'm glad I got around to ticking this one. It's been a big want of mine for a while. Definitely worth chasing. 713 charactersVonerichs, Jan 25, 2014

Caramel, vanilla, dark dried fruit, huge bourbon notes, Touches of sweetened espresso, marshmallow, figs, dates, and cocoa powder.
Completely mimics the nose. Caramel enrobed in chocolate, vanilla marshmallows stuffed with a blend of dried fig/cherry/date/raisins and drizzled with coffee/dark cocoa ganache. Notes of citrus lay in wait. HUGE notes of sweet vanilla bourbon and oak. 
Not quite as thick as I was hoping for, but it really sticks to your tongue and envelopes as it goes down. I think the bourbon thins it out but also intensify's and brings together all of these incredible flavors. 
This is a really intense experience in a bottle. Old Ale... Barleywine... call it what you will. This is worth seeking out, and I'm glad I did!!! 924 charactersThickfreakness, Jan 23, 2014

Pours a dark, dirty, muggy mahogany/ruby brown with no sign of carbonation - not pretty, but no olde ale should have to be. 
Aroma is outrageous. Boozy dark fruits - figs, raisins - huge bourbon caramel that enhances the caramel malt, toasted brown sugar. Very fine bourbon vanilla with a sweetness of marshmallow and coconut. Some brandy fruits and cocoa powder. There is some leather and tobacco as well. 
Taste is huge, rounded, and balanced. All of the above in the aroma is featured - incredibly smooth with an amazing aftertaste that just lingers and sticks to the bottom of the tongue. Not overly sweet at all - the balance is perfect. The barrel-vanilla character is what sticks out the most - it is very soft and subtle but integrates with everything else strongly. 
This is one of the finest beers I have ever had - incredible. 100/100

A: Pours a dark brown, molasses color body. Small, thin head billows up slowly after the pour and fades much quicker, leaving just a tiny rim. Pretty indicative of any olde ale.
S: The smell is oozing of caramel malts and bourbon. A bit of toffee, butterscotch, and vanilla are laced in between the malt and barrel.
T: Perfectly balanced and complex. Toasted marshmallows. Toffee. Butterscotch. Caramel. It's just like having an after dinner bourbon with some creme brûlée - and that's a good thing.
M: Creamy. Very full body. Velvety. Low carbonation, but that's probably due to the aging. Boozy warm.
O: Wow. Just wow. I was a skeptic that this wouldn't live up to the hype, but I was wrong. So complex that ever drink is a bit different. Some sips are dominated by marshmallow, while some are literally just like eating a creme brûlée. Bourbon ties it altogether brilliantly. 919 charactersJustin_Neff, Jan 16, 2014

Appeared a dark brown nearly black color with a quarter-finger mocha colored head. Head vanished nearly immediately. Once the head dissipated it was tough to tell that this was a carbonated beverage.
Smell was quite potent and delicious. Sweet candied fruits and vanilla, a bit of charred oak, and bourbon were present.
Taste followed the smell closely. Lots of dark fruits including plums and raisins, a nice burnt vanilla character and slight molasses. The bourbon is blended in nicely so there is not much of an alcohol taste to it. Extremely sweet.
Mouth-feel was excellent. Thick and velvety. Very smooth. Little to no carbonation (not sure if this would be different had it been a newer vintage).
Overall a fantastic beer. Would love to find some more! 810 charactersTWStandley, Jan 07, 2014
4.41/5  rDev -2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured out a caramel color, basically no head, huge amounts of lacing on the glass. Huge amounts of vanilla, toffee, caramel, burnt sugar, toasted coconut and booze on the nose. Taste is truly superb. Lots of vanilla up front, with caramel in the middle and a slight alcohol burn on the back end. It's a welcomed feeling, that cuts through the sweetness. Low carbonation on this one, very viscous, coats the mouth and lingers a long time. Just really really good. Basically the best bourbon barrel aged english barleywine that's not a barleywine out there. 556 charactersDavepoolesque, Jan 06, 2014

Appearance- Like foamy brandy- rich leggy amber that you can't see through. Looks amazing. 
Smell- Super complex- butterscotch, caramel, toffee, creamy coffee, faint sandalwood, vanilla, creamy chocolate, caramello!
Taste- Big fruity rye whiskey, followed by vanilla, smoke, raisins, figs, currants, dulce de leche, big chocolate toffee. Wait two minutes, and its like the finest cigar you've ever had all over your mouth. Super tasty!
Mouthfeel- Super smooth with just enough bubbles to keep it refreshing and not fizzy. Amazing- suits the character of the beer very well.
Overall- AWESOME! I truly did not expect this much out of it, but I now believe the hype. Glad it's local, and if you haven't had it, try it. One of the most complex, tasty brews I've had. Amazing stuff. Well done Kuhnhenn!!! 860 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Dec 21, 2013

Appearance: while pouring, it looked like heavily unfiltered apple cider. As the beer settled in the glass it was a dark opaque brown color. Just a couple mm of head presented which disappeared shortly after. No lacings around the glass. 
Smell: a lot of over ripen dark fruits, some toasted marshmallow, white chocolate, bourbon as well as a heavily sweet and smoky smell that I just cannot describe. 
Taste: its complex and boozy. Very sweet but not to the point of cloying. Taste raisins, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, a tad bit of spices and smoke. Finishes warm from the bourbon. Winter is the perfect time to drink this. 
Mouthfeel: full-bodied, smooth and slightly creamy. It can get sticky along the edge of the glass. 
Overall: this is one heck of a complex beer. A sipper for sure. As theres a ton going on in this beer, be sure to share this with a friend. There's lot to talk about this one with so much going on in this beer. 984 charactersBenish, Nov 25, 2013

Pours dense nearly pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a patchy lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisin, toast, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark bread, tobacco, light cocoa, and toasted earthiness. Absolutely insane aromas with great balance and complexity of malt and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, toast, toffee, molasses, maple syrup, raisin, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark bread, light cocoa, light tobacco, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark bread, light cocoa, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of malt and barrel flavors; with a perfect barrel/malt balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class old ale! All around insane complexity and balance of malt and barrel flavors; and dangerously smooth to sip on considering the very high ABV. Unbelievably amazing offering. 1,407 characterssuperspak, Nov 21, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Poured a cloudy dark brown with a thin cap that dissipates almost instantly, with no lacing. Really how an old ale should look like. 
S: Geezus. Big bourbon soaked dark fruits and candy bars. I smell marshmellow as well. Amazing.
T: Initial blast of big bourbon drench raisins and figs. I get a big caramel candy sweetness from what tastes like a roasted marshmellow, big sugary sweetness, more bourbon and dark fruits with some chocolate. A wee hint of oak and vanilla in the background. The finish is very big, bold, sweet boozey and sticky
M: Big feel with low carbonation . Sticky sweet with a dumptruck of flavors and textures.
O: How have I not had this? This beer was awesome.I can't recall another Old Ale which gave me such a "wow" factor. 755 charactersbarleywinefiend, Nov 04, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.252012 vintage.
Appearance: Brown, rust cloudiness. Not much head at all, and the small amount that was quickly fades to the perimeter of the glass only. 
Smell: Dark fruit, caramel, vanilla, coconut, boozy Bourbon, cocoa. I can smell the toasted marshmallow they speak of on the bottle as well.
Taste: A blast of Bourbon paired with big coconut and vanilla opens it up. Middle of the mouth is dark fruit. End of the drink sees the Bourbon reassert itself and finishes pretty dry. Booze is hid pretty well, though the burn on the way down gives away its strength.
Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, somewhat syrupy and medium side of heavy bodied, as you'd expect from the style.
Overall: A smooth, drinkable beer that hides the abv masterfully. Would seek out and drink again. 773 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Oct 18, 2013

A: Pours a very dark brown with a small but dense and fizzy tan head. Head fades slowly, leaving zero lacing behind. Good retention at least.
S: Oh yeah, huge bourbon notes. Loaded with caramel, brown sugar and toasted marshmallow (love the latter aroma/flavor in bbal beers). Burnt sugars. Some decent cocoa and a little heat from the alcohol. Lightest touch of dark fruit. Wonderful.
T: Again with the big bourbon up front. Not as strong as in the aroma though. A little sharp booziness with wonderful caramel and burnt sugars/toasted marshmallow. Touch of dark fruit in there too. A little bitter cocoa into the finish, standing stronger in the aftertaste. Lingering oaky vanilla and toasted marshmallow between sips. Remarkably mellow for a 13.5% barrel-aged brew. It's still big, don't get me wrong, but not harsh.
M: Big, heavy, viscous. Cut nicely with the bourbon. A touch dry from the oak in the aftertaste. 
O: Wow, an old ale for the ages for sure. Wish I could get this stuff locally...or basically ever. I've had normal 4D which was quite fruity. The bourbon in this covers up most of the fruitiness and brings in wonderful caramel and toasted marshmallow notes which I feel is a big improvement. Quite complex, well balanced, smooth and and very, very tasty. I think this might be my new favorite old ale, which was previously Fruet and Cuir. Not quite as good as Founder's Better Half though I don't think (that maple barrel really made it). Very close though. 1,492 charactersDope, Oct 05, 2013

A- Pours a viscous brown color with ruby hues when held to the light. A 1/2 inch beige head forms and quickly fades to a thick ring around the rim of the glass. Carbonation bubbles are apparent throughout. 
S- Bourbon. Vanilla. Alcohol. Some oak. A little bit of caramel and malty sweetness, but I can't tell if it is coming from the barrel or the base beer. Either way, this smells fantastic and very inviting. Only drawback is there is not a ton of complexity.
T- Up front, a really nice malty caramel sweetness along with some molasses and port-like cherry esters. On the back end, there is a huge blast of vanilla, bourbon, and some oak tannins along with a touch of bitterness to round things out. There is alcohol present, but no fusel or 'hot' flavor. Spot on for the style. Wow- this is an amazing beer!
M- Luscious. Smooth, low carbonation that gives the beer a creamy feel. High body, although not overly sweet. Great balance between the tannic oak and high finishing gravity make this a smooth drinker. 
O- I was not expecting this beer to be so amazing. I want to rate this badly in a disguised attempt to trade for more of it, but it deserves better than that. Great winter time sipper that meshes bourbon and malt perfectly, without being an over the top, diabetic coma inducing sort of beer. Gimme more. 1,388 charactersjustforrazors, Sep 25, 2013

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a balloon glass. Incredible thickness. It's a murky deep brown color with a red hue throughout. Topped by a creamy, orange-tan head, about an inch thick. Head dies down after several minutes. 
Aroma is of rich sweet caramel, toasted marshmallow, charred oak, very faint hint of the alcohol, and chocolate truffle. Robust aroma.
Well hidden alcohol. This is a very smooth, creamy bodied ale, full yet soft on the palate with a good level of carbonation. Sweet up front with notes of toffee. Mid palate has a little warmth to it, showing its strength. The barrel character expresses itself on the roof of the mouth, with a little molasses note on the sides of the tongue. 
Goes down so so easily. Very great barrel aged beer. When the barrel aging seems to just mellow everything and create something that has the quality of a lower alcohol beer, and passes over the palate with ease, that's when the brewer has utilized the barrel to its best effect. This is masterful. 983 charactersMusicaleMike, Sep 13, 2013

Vintage bottle from 2011 served September 2nd, 2013. 
Appearance: dark mahogany colored body with little to no bubbles on the body creating a slightly off-white head that has a light orange tint to it. The head with a hard pour didn't rise much, I would say maybe 1/8" if that dropping to almost nothing before the first sip. 
Smell: light molasses and caramel scent, awesome to sniff but little lighter than what expected. 
Taste: I have had old ales before and this one on taste alone crushes almost anything else I have ever had. Complex and sweet that might overwhelm some people with its brown sugar feel and maltiness that is incredibly addicting. 
Mouth: light to medium carbonation at best. Ridiculously sticky and for that alone I have to give I respect. 
Overall: If you are looking for a good beer and like that caramel note to it, this beer is beyond perfect. Has some flaws but most of is easy to overlook because rarely you get something that tastes as good as this. Grab a bottle on me and enjoy....Salud! 1,063 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Sep 02, 2013

Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this
Appearance: Deep, dark/medium brown, some dark caramel around the edges - nice clarity, pours with a small, creamy beige head, fades to some wisps of a cap, leaves a few streaks and spots of lacing
Smell: Rich and intense - tons and tons of caramel and toffee - very cooked and caramelized, brown sugar-like sweetness, intense but not excessively sweet - some chocolate and vanilla - lots of bourbon and bourbon barrel - a range of dark fruit, figs, and raisins - some pretty obvious alcohol
Taste: About as intense as the aroma, with some serious malts - rich caramel, toffee, sweet grains, sweet bread - highly caramelized - hint of highly cooked, vaguely old, vaguely oxidized tasting malts (typical for the style) - some syrupy sweetness and brown sugar, but not over the top - lots of wood and rich barrel - alcohol is pretty obvious, but so is the bourbon, so it works
Mouthfeel: Borderline full body, very smooth, nice finish, a nice sipper
Overall: Sure, I'll give this at least 4 dementias
This is probably the first Old Ale that I have legitimately enjoyed. The malt profile is pretty ridiculous, and they can support the bourbon barrel aging better than I expected. This is great to sip. I might die if I had to drink the whole bottle, but it would be an acceptable death. 1,348 charactersangrybabboon, Aug 30, 2013
4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Thanks to Jas45678 for the bottle. Split with angrybabboon. 
Appearance: Rich dark copper/brown. Hard pour leaves no head with the tiniest off-white collar. No carbonation. Standard affair for a barrel aged anything. 
Smell: Holy hell bourbon. Loaded with vanilla, toffee, and caramel. Mild barrel presence. Big sweet maltiness tempered by a very light choppiness. Some molasses with a deep fruitiness. Raisins and plums and cherry. Sharp bite of alcohol. Complex sweetness layered with alcohol. Slight spicy finish from the alcohol as well. 
Taste: Vanilla and coconut. Fleshy fresh coconut. Caramel and toffee in spades. Incredibly sweet with layers of bourbon. Complex malts add some mild roasted elements. Dark fruit with raisins and plums. Spicy alcohol. Vaguely nutty. Warming pushes the bourbon a bit far along with the sweetness. Almost like marshmallow on the finish. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with a medium body and minimal carbonation. Surprisingly clean with a drying alcohol. 
Overall: Sometimes hype pays off. 
I'm not usually a bourbon barrel or old ale fan, but this is good. Complex if a bit too sweet. I guess I need to get another bottle or four to cellar and try over time. 1,203 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Aug 30, 2013

Pours a medium brown, perhaps mahogany. Not particularly dark but not particularly light either. Comes with a swirly film of white head that simmers on top for a while. Not much of a head, but it is very pretty on the top of the body. 
Smells like caramel bourbon marshmallows. And very pungent here. The nose on this beer is a winner.
The taste is very intense. It's a big boatload of caramel, toffee, molasses, bourbon. A good bit of oak in here too. It all comes together to make some sort of bourbon marshmallow bomb. Very nice, unfortunately the alcohol here is very strong as well. 
Somewhat thinner for a full-bodied brew, typical of old ales. Decent carbonation, smooth and thin-feeling yet flavourful. Definitely a sipper, as the booze on this one is very, very strong.
Outside of the booziness, this beer is excellent. Strong vanilla, bourbon and caramel flavours mix together quite well here. I could not drink the whole bottle by myself, no way sirree. This 12oz bottle is meant to be shared with a friend who likes his beer sweet and strong. 1,193 charactersStevedore, Aug 25, 2013

Wax Capped
2005
Received this gem in a trade with badbeer, thanks again. A hard pour conjures up a minimal swirling of head that disappears rather quickly. There's a tiny ring of head around the edge of the glass. The small head is expected from such an alcohol bomb such as this. The color on the pour is a muddy brown before becoming opaque dark brown in the glass. 
I don't think this beer could even accommodate another aroma. Big nose filling whiffs of dark rye and pumpernickel bread start things off. All this bready goodness is wrapped around a handful of brown sugar and molasses. This again is all wrapped around a sweet oaken whiff of bourbon. Everything comes together flawlessly. There's alcohol in there but I can feel the fumes more in my eyes and nose that smell it's presence.
Flavor picks up right where the smell left off. The sweet notes (brown sugar and molasses) are just the right intensity bringing the bready malts into the oak and bourbon perfectly. The breadiness up front is absolutely mouthwatering and just pulls you right in. The bourbon and oak accompany the breadiness without being too dominant. World class old ale!
The mouthfeel is just as perfectly done as the rest of the drink. Sluggish carbonation leaves this beer sliding slowly along your tongue. As it slowly works through every separate flavor grabs hold at some point or another. The body has some weight to it and coats the mouth nicely.
The alcohol and big bold flavors keeps this a one and done type of beer. The bottle I'm drinking now will be a pleasure to finish but that's enough for one sitting.
This is not only a world class old ale but a world class beer period. The barrel aging sets this beer on an entirely different level. I'm glad I could get my hands on one of these. It's a great beer to celebrate Christmas. 1,841 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

The mouthfeel on this beer is great , nice and thick and the carbonation is spot on
The taste is wonderful all the flavors I want from the style are just about close to perfect , the alcohol is not hidden at all and makes it even more drinkable to me , nice and warming all the way down.

Smells very original and wonderful. Roasted malt, toasted marshmallow (actually comes through as advertised), caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak....Wow! This smells incredible.
This is such an incredible beer. Some much oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, and marshmallow. Truly original. Enormous flavor. I'm really taken back by this. Definitely some heat on the back end. Also notice some dark red fruits. They are not overwhelming, but a nice complement. These flavors add a little acidity, though, which I could do without.
Low-medium carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. With a little heavier mouthfeel and a creamier texture, this would have been near perfect. Still, this is such a small critique. 
Overall, this has been one of the most unique beers I have had in a while. It has a huge flavor which is extremely well executed. Kuhnhenn also managed to tease out some awesome flavors not terribly common in BA stouts (opposed to this old ale). I might have to seek out more of this. Very very well done!!! 1,085 characterslunarbrew, Jul 17, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Been looking forward to trying this after having the regular 4D awhile ago.
Pours a strange orangeish brown color with no visible carbonation.
Smell is strongly of bourbon and oak, with a heavy sweetness.
Taste follows the nose. Heavy bourbon and oak presence, the remaining taste can only be described as a graham cracker soaked in alcohol. I actually got a smidge or two of the marshmallow described on the bottle. A fair amount of alcohol coming through on the finish.
Mouthfeel is fine, a little hot on the back end.
Overall, definitely a tasty beer, but not as nuanced as the non-BA version. I like both, but would stick with the non-BA version going forward. 669 charactersthebigredone, Jul 04, 2013

4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on-tap at the Kuhnhenn Brewery on a paddle.
Appearance: Pretty nice. About a finger of a tan head and surprisingly decent lacing. The beer is a dark brown color with red when held to light. Looks better than I expected... I thought it may look flat.
Smell: Compared to the standard 4D ('11), this had a lot of caramel. There was also quite a lot of darker fruits there as well. The vanilla notes that you'd expect from barrel aging weren't really there all that much. A very nice smelling beer all the same.
Taste: Having side-by-side with the regular 4D, this was definitely a bit more mellow, as one would expect given the barrel. It's not a huge difference, but it's noticeable. The mouth feel is maybe a bit thicker. The taste itself on this one just isn't on par with the regular 4D... of course, that's just my humble opinion. The BB4D mellows out the fruity notes quite considerably and replaces them with a maltier, sweeter flavor. It's still excellent, but not quite as tasty.
I'm extremely happy to have gotten the chance to try this beer. I don't think it's as legendary as some people said it would be (like I said, I preferred the standard '11 4D), but I liked it. Recommended. 1,198 charactersSerialTicker, Jun 29, 2013
4.51/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Served out of a bottle.
This beer appears a very dark brown, with little head, and minimal lacing. 
The smell is bourbon first, and slowly going to toffee 
Taste, just like the smell, all begins with bourbon. I am instantly reminded of Sucaba. It has a lot of bourbon, chocolate, and sweetness, fading to dark fruits/dates. 
The mouthfeel was a little too boozy for me, but not at all unbearable. About what I expected out of a beer like this.
Overall, a great Old Ale, probably on of the best I have ever had 513 charactersHoppyKilaMonster, Jun 28, 2013

A: Pours a cloudy dark deep brown. No head is present, tiny amounts of lacing cling to the outside of the glass.
S: Huge caramel, sugar, dark fruits, vanilla, oak all laced in plenty of bourbon.
T: Spot on the nose, but much deeper. Huge caramel sweetness, vanilla, oak, bourbon, caramelized sugar and a hint of dark fruits.
M: Full body, low carbonation. A slight hint of heat trickles down your throat to remind you, this is indeed at 13.5% BA beer.
O: Overall, ridiculously drinkable BA old ale. It can be a bit sweet at times but as soon as I think that I get vanilla/oak/bourbon and remove all doubt. This is a world class BA old ale. Seek it out, drink it. Enjoy. 742 charactersWesM63, Jun 27, 2013

The fact that it tastes so much like soy sauce can simply not be hidden away by its great colour and aroma.
Sorry but this should be used for cooking and not drinking. Clearly this is just my opinion as it sits at number 20 of the most popular beer list. 318 charactersCramshawbar, Jun 11, 2013

A: Dark brown with a small beige head; it looks dark red in front of light
S: Huge bourbon and barrel followed by rich caramel
T: Wow, big bourbon barrel presence followed by huge notes of chocolate/caramel/toffee with some slight toast and minimal heat/alcohol. It has a nice, sweet finish as well.
M: Full bodied with a good amount of creaminess
O: This is barrel aged perfection for old ales. Amazing flavor and aroma with a perfect amount of alcohol burn, which could be from the 18 months of cellaring. Regardless, if you love old ales and BA beers seek this out immediately. 646 charactersDrucifer, Jun 05, 2013

A- looks pretty black to me, I don't see any light showing through. A pretty impressive head of foam here for such a strong brew.
S- this is the most "English" smelling brew that I can think of. Big caramel malt, big notes of toffee, big toasted...errr...incredible aromas. Almost forgot to mention what the barrel aging brought to the table...Bourbon.
T- taste is right up there with the smell. Sweet, toasted, lots of toffee, and yeah, a bit of an alcohol bite that isn't at all subtle after the swallow. The heat is here! But wait, I now get some pitted dark fruits, vanilla, and Bourbon. 
M- full bodied with light but noticeable carbonation.
O- I had the regular 4D back in 06(best before 11) and it stands as one of my highest rated brews ever. I'm gonna have to think long and hard on how to rate this gem. 878 charactersBitterbill, May 29, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer was served on draft at the Kuhnhenn Brewing Company taproom in Warren, Michigan. It arrived in a generic tulip, showing the deepest hues of nut brown. It held a one and a half finger head of yellowish cream, showing nice retention, and leaving geographic rings of lacing around the glass as it dissipated. A thick haze cut clarity, with no sediment noted. Carbonation appeared to be active, but the bubbles rose slowly in the thickness. The aroma was bright with massive caramel malt roast, sugary dextrins, and sweeter brown malts to match for the base. Mixing in were notes of sticky honey bourbon, floral pollen dryness, fresh vanilla, mossy oaky musk, and strawberry and plum freshness. With warmth came much more warmth and butter of the bourbon itself, along with raw cereal grain, roasted barley, and hazelnut skin. Our first impression was that, as in the nose, there was fantastically sweet malt base to match the big booziness, which showed some of the most wonderful bourbon smoothness we’ve encountered to date. As we sipped, the taste opened with fusel booze and black pepper spiciness, with massively thick woody bourbon, deep cherry and fig fruitiness, nutmeg spice, and syrupy roasted caramel malts. Moving to the peak was more of a mild chocolatey malt, with more of the sweetness of bourbon, woody dryness, melted brown sugars, rosehip, chalked toffees, raw butter, and the lightest nectary hop syrup. The end came with fruitiness of dark cherry sugars, continued thick roast and toast of caramel, toffees, and milk chocolate sweetness, and of course, that beautifully infused boozy core of woody bourbon and boozy spice. The aftertaste breathed of black pepper, bourbon flavoring, general fusel booziness, sticky caramel, pencil eraser, raw caramel malts, chalky yeast, and raw barley roast. The body was quite full, and the carbonation was medium. Each sip gave hearty slurp, sip, cream, froth, and finishing pop. The bubbles and sugars left a thick coating around the mouth, leaving it feeling oily and resiny, with surprisingly little astringency or dryness away from the softer twangs of boozy evaporation. The spice of booze lingered down the throat, giving prickle and warmth all the way down to the belly. The lips were left sticky, especially at the corners. The abv is big but expected, and despite this, the beer drinks insanely well.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. The smack of bourbon was so genuine, warm, inviting, and integrated, it seems hard to imagine the beer without it. This plays excellently off the hearty malt sweets of caramels, toffees, and roasty milk chocolates, acting as the unifying feature of smoothness to blend everything together. The booze is big, and this guy does everything in its power to hide that, much in the same way that Bourbon County is so sweet. Here we don’t come quite as close to that ultimate balance, but we actually are left a bit of room for that bitterness of not only booze, but grain as well, to poke through. The nose is comparatively softer, but inclusive of most of what you want, while the sip is sticky, frothy, and robust. This all makes for an incredibly balanced yet unique beer that will leave you screaming for more. 3,252 charactersTheBrewo, May 25, 2013

A- Pours a dark brownish with slight bit more translucency then you would expect from this style of beer. Thin creamy yeasty off white head forms that recedes to a flat top with a swirly creaminess to it, leaves some light spotty lacing that clings to the side of the glass.
S- Bourbon, raisins, oak, figs, fairly boozy. Decently aromatic, complex, and well balanced.
T- Raisins; figs; hints of other dark fruits such as plums, grapes, etc.; finishes with a nice bourbon oaky presence that balances nicely with the raisins and dark fruits. Very well balanced with great flavors, not nearly as boozy as in the aroma and considering the abv the alcohol was very well hidden.
M- Medium bodied, very drinkable, slightly creamy, in my opinion perfect for the style.
O- This was a fantastic brew and easily one of the better beers of it's respective style. For such a high abv the alcohol was balanced nicely with the complex flavors and was very drinkable. Although I shared this one with one other person, I could easily drink at least a bottle by myself. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,169 charactersjaasen64, May 04, 2013

A: Dark, dark ruby red with a teeny tiny head of white foam that almost instantly dissipates. Swirling it around in the glass leaves a slight residue on the sides. Clear enough to see to the bottom of the glass. 
S: Aromas of cherries and currants soaked in bourbon. Molasses, sweet malts and marshmallows. Smells a bit boozy.
T: Bourbon soaked cherries and molasses. The bourbon comes through pretty smoothly, giving a kiss of smoky and sweet whiskey notes to the blend of dark fruits and fig-like tastes. Even though this brew has mellowed for three years (and nine months, according to the bottle), this beer is still a bit boozy. This is definitely a sipper. 
M: Flavors linger for minutes after sipping; absolutely stellar mouthfeel. On the boarder between thick and medium body, but not viscous. The heat still hits the back of your throat and lets you know you're drinking a big beer. 
O: Kuhnhenn has yet to disappoint me. This is my first barrel aged beer by them, and it absolutely kicks ass. Old ales are definitely one of my favorite styles, and while most breweries shy away from them, Kuhnhenn embraces them and makes them their bitch. A must try for any bourbon drinkers and/or BA beer seekers. 1,266 charactersLordquackingstic, Apr 27, 2013

Type: 12oz. Bottle
Vintage: 2010
Glass: DFH Chalice
Pours a deep brown mahogany in color w/ a skim coat white head that produces little to no lacing. Aromas of caramel, toffee, dark fruits, a touch of roasted coconut and marshmallow, and bourbon. The taste matches the nose w/ sweet toffee/caramel and dark fruits up front, leading into toasted coconut and marshmallow, and finished w/ medium levels of bourbon and tobacco. Medium bodied and maybe a touch too thin for the style, which is about the only knock on the brew. The 13% ABV is quite evident which slightly limits the drink-ability of 
this tasty concoction.
Overall, a pleasure to sample! However, this could benefit even more from extended aging. 727 charactersmikeyv35, Apr 15, 2013

I cracked this open after a regular 4th D. 
It pours like beef stock with no head at all. The lacing is lightened from the lack of head but it exists. 
It smells of dates, malt, and booze. It's fantastic. The taste is damn near the same with a nice slightly bitter raisin and bourbon finish.
This is a great beer. 361 charactersmilliCAN, Apr 14, 2013

Appearance: Dark brown. Very little foam associated with the poor, but consistently had about 1-2mm laced on the glass. 4.5/5.
Smell: Truly intoxicating. Sweet caramel that had a warm feel to it. I wish I could smell this all day long. 5/5.
Taste: Wow. Sweetness hits first. Clearly a caramel and sugary component. Very minor vanilla taste lingers shortly afterwards. That's all I can discern at this point. 4.75/5.
Mouthfeel: A very nice mix of minor carbonation and smoothness. 4.75/5.
Overall: I am very impressed with this beer. Although I am just getting into the craft scene, this is most certainly one of the most enjoyable gustatory experiences I've had in my life. I am very glad I bought more than one of these beers so I can age it and see how it changes over time. Truly an impressive beer. 4.75. 921 charactersCadbury, Apr 11, 2013

2011
Pours dark molasses-colored with no head despite a smooth middle pour into Crooked Stave snifter. Some lacing.
Smells like yummy bourbon. Dark fruits and malt too. Some baker’s chocolate.
Awesome bourbon and chocolate. Flavors melded nicely, some coffee appears that wasn't evident in the nose. Also some lingering bitterness. Huge dark fruits becoming more prominent on each sip.
Extremely slick. Very little carbonation. Alcohol more apparent as it warms. This beer is strong!
2012
Pours a dark molasses color into my Night Shift BS teku. A hard pour produces some head, but not very much. Dissipates quicker than usual. Not much lacing.
Smell is dark fruits like cherries. Chocolate. Vanilla bourbon sweetness.
Taste has huge bourbon vanilla notes. More alcohol warmth. Lingering bitterness (hops?). Sharper flavors than in the 2011. A lot of dark fruit. Toffee, brown sugar, etc.
Medium carbonation, lighter body. Slick. 
Preferred the 2011 in the end, the luxurious mouthfeel put it over the top. 1,102 charactersAuror, Apr 09, 2013

A: Dark with mahogany glints. Very thin off-white head that fades quite quickly.
S: Woody, oaky scent. The nose is also sweet, with aromas of caramel and soaked orange. Nice!
T: Mainly caramel, toffee, chocolate upfront. Also wood, vanilla, soaked red fruits ans dark fruits.
M: Mouthfeel is sweet, buttery, thick, actually fat. A bit boozy on the finish, so a long time sipper rather than something very drinkable. Still appropriate for the beer.
O: SI had this side by side with Närke Kaggen! Stormakstporter on an epic day. Very different beers indeed, still it stood the comparison! 617 charactersFux, Apr 01, 2013

A: Pours a murky brown with almost a red or purple tinge. Good finger or so of light tan head with good retention, no lacing.
S: Just outstanding. Aroma is of sweet boozy bourbon and vanilla. Caramel. Almost nutty. 
T/M: Big vanilla. Caramel. Charred brown sugar. Bourbon. Sweet dark fruit. A woody, almost maple character. Sweet, but balanced by the booze. Mouthfeel is incredibly thick, with low carbonation.

2011 vintage poured into Bruery Snifter
A: very dark maple brown in color, created a thin film that was tan in color. absolutely no transparency even when held directly up to the light
S: the aroma is just massive and it was immediately notice during the pour. this is simply off the charts. just absolutely massive amounts of alcohol soaked dark fruits (raisins and figs), huge vanilla, oak chips, bourbon. immense sweet caramel. 
T: unbelievable balance. again, just a ridiculous amount of vanilla and caramel sweetness, alcohol soaked dark fruits, bourbon and oak. 
M: oh my God. this has to be one of the thickest beers I have even had. this could pass off as syrup. It coats the mouth with a terrific sugary sweetness and just sticks to the palate and the vanilla lingers. 
O: absolute 5's (expect in appearance) for me. and I am now in forever ISO of this brew. I was blown away by its viscosity, and for it being 13.5%, I do not detect any alcohol heat whatsoever. Seriously, I cannot thank you enough Matt! 1,101 characterstut2528, Feb 24, 2013

A - pours a thick black coffee type color, very little light brown head. Wispy foam swirls around on top.
S - Smells really nice. Toffee, burnt sugar, caramel, brown sugar. Really damn good. If it were a little more pronounced, it would be a 5, but really close to perfect either way.
T - Leads with the caramel, toasty marshmallow, sticky sweetness, pretty great. But, there is a sort of metallic finish that I noticed throughout. I noticed it when it was cold and it stayed present through the entire time it warmed over the course of 40 minutes or so. Not really bad, but right or wrong, I was sort of expecting perfection, and that definitely held it back. 
M - Nice and thick, Actually a little more carbonated than I expected, but not off putting.
O - If not perfect, it was very very good. Great sticky rich sweet flavor. Not the best beer I've ever had, but very tasty. 927 charactersBeerandboards, Feb 21, 2013

Light fizzy almost non-existent head, dark molasses brown color that lets just a bit of brown light through, thick legs on the glass.
Nose tons of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, some molasses even, sweet malts galore, then vanilla and toasted oak barrel, light bourbon in there even, and sweetened dark fruit like brandy soaked raisins, dates, etc.
Taste brings more of the same, fairly sweet, plenty of caramel and toffee, brown sugar molasses, candied dates, little nutty like, booze soaked raisins, fig paste, then barrel, some vanilla and toasty oak, and some nice bourbon, and a nice tingly warming booze. Finish is sticky sweet, long lingering sweet malts, caramel toffee, dark fruits, bourbon barrel, etc.
Mouth is fuller bodied, lighter carb, plenty of warming tingly booze.
Overall a very nice beer, top of the top in the style, bourbon barrel aged old ale executed almost perfectly. 1,007 charactersjlindros, Feb 18, 2013

Pours an opaque, sienna-brown color with a dark-beige, creamy head that smokes out pretty quickly and is kind of hard to bring back, even with aggressive swirling. 
The aroma is powerful right from the start, and only grows more so as the beer warms up. The bourbon barrel aging is apparent immediately, thanks to the heavy boozy-oak notes. Light vanilla, candied, booze-soaked dark fruits, and an intense sweetness build up the rest of the aroma. There's a nice clash between the dry warmth from the bourbon barrels and the savory sweetness of the malt.
This one is very creamy as it hits the palate, with a body on the thicker side and a medium amount of carbonation. Bourbon infused fruits up front; dates, figs, ripe raisins. Toasted brown sugar charges through and sweetens things up a bit, as well. Along with the brown sugar comes a delicate vanilla flavor that lasts into the aftertaste. Oak and bourbon flavors are hanging in the background from start to finish - although the word "background" may not do them justice, as they play a much larger role in the flavor. 
The taste has the same head-butting of flavors as the nose did aromas - a nice, smooth, mellow boozy warmth with a dry oak underbody competes with a delicate and delectable sweetness in the form of toasted, sugar-coated dark fruit. Booze is, as mentioned, very apparent - but in a "flavor" kind of way, rather than a "burning" kind of way - although it's additional warmth should be noted.
At 13.5% ABV, this beer is no slouch, and it deserves to be slowly sipped. Heavy oak, bourbon, sugar, dark fruits, and vanilla make for a nicely executed barrel-aged old ale. There's a reason people rave about this stuff. It's great. 1,760 characterstectactoe, Feb 17, 2013

The smell is just littered with barrel notes everywhere (this beer is still fresh): dry woodiness, oak flavors, and a small hint of vanilla. The barrel notes kind of remind me of KBS or New Holland Pilgrim's Dole. I get even more vanilla the more smells I take it. The old ale earthiness comes out a bit, but its definitely a bourbon barrel bomb on the nose. 
Now this is exactly what I expected from the hype. Strong notes of caramel and toffee dominate pretty much the whole thing. Lots of vanilla and dry woody bourbon from the barrel mix beautifully with the sweet caramel and toffee. They are just intertwined so beautifully, that you can't tell where one begins and the other ends. The bourbon heat makes an initial attempt at coming out, but loses to the amazing sweet flavors, then it warms the back of the throat in the finish. The old ale is woven seamlessly into the huge bourbon and barrel notes. The earthiness helps keep this beer from being cloying.
There isn't much of a body at all, but it feels super slick. The caramel and toffee make it drinkable for 13.5%. I didn't even notice it in the flavor that much, which is scary as all get out. Its a sipper for sure, but a tasty one at that. 1,387 charactersVncentLIFE, Feb 14, 2013

This is from the 2012 Winter Solstice release, still on-tap in February:
A - a beautiful dark toffee muddy brown color. There was minimal head and what head there was disappeared to a small ring around the top of the glass, with the small head there was a small amount of lacing, the lacing had great legs.
S - Man this smells great, toffee and marshamallow followed by the booziness of the Bourbon. There is a sense of some fig and raisin with the backbone of the malt present as well.
T - The taste is different from anything I have had before, the bourbon and toffee along with the marshmallow were dominant and just like the aroma there was just a hint of some fruit mostly figs and raisins but something else along with it I just couldnt place.
M - very smooth with minimal carbonation, nice full body.
O - wow, this is an outstanding beer. Was very dissapointed they didn't have any for sale in bottle even though the menu indicated they had some. would gladly pay $8.00 per bottle for a few of these. This is rapidly going to be something I search for and has moved into the upper tier of beers that I have enjoyed. 1,166 charactersDocrock, Feb 14, 2013

Pours cloudy dark brownish red with a hint of kahki head. Smell is an amazing blend of vanilla caramel, chocolate, oak, bourbon and maybe some brandy. Beautiful. Surprisingly mellow flavor. Bready malts and chocolate fade into strong vanilla oak and subtle caramel notes. Bourbon is there up front but dissapates into the complexity of the barrels quickly. Thick viscous mouthfeel almost like a stout. Almost like a caramello dipped in bourbon with vanilla ice cream on top. And yet the sweetness is not overpowering. Just fantastic.

4.83/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A friend brought this back after a trip to Michigan. This review is of the 2011 version, served at about 55 degrees.
Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized snifter. Pours a deep mahogany brown, with a minimal might tan head. Moderate cloudniess in the beer gives it a bit of a murky quality; otherwise, it is the color of cola.
The aroma is intense and boozy, with tons of burnt toffee, malt and dark cherry. I don't quite get the burnt marshmellow advertised on the bottle, but there is a burnt quality to the brew.
The taste is malty, boozy, yeasty and strong, with dark fruit, caramel and burnt sugar. This is an intensely flavorful beer that demands it be sipped. A bit peaty and earthy, there's tremendous depth to this ale. Chocolate notes begin to come out the warmer it gets.
Full bodied with low bitterness, the brew has the feel of heavy creme it is so thick. There's a bit of fruity tang in the finish that balances out the ale nicely.
This is a slow sipper of a beer, meant to be enjoyed like one would enjoy a sherry, port or cognac, perfect for a cold winter day. You don't come across many olde ales that are as "English" as this; a true treat! 1,170 charactersTheHoppiest, Feb 10, 2013

A - Mahogany with no head...wait a second...the small head rises. Perfect. White head with a hint of tan, beautifully turns into lacing, which returns when necessary. Foam doesn't stick to the glass, but the body does. Looks great for the style.
 S - Tons of wood, caramelized dark fruits pushing through, note of brown sugar.
T - Spiced, creamy wood, caramelized dark fruits, brown sugar and a lot of oak in the back half. Sweet oak is strong on the finish with a hint of heat in the throat, but not really on the tongue. The caramelized fruits blend well in the finish with the oak, but the barrel is stonger.
M - Thick. I love it.
O - We tried this about a year ago (2011 version) next to the BA Papier / Coton / Cuir set and it was better than everything except the BA Coton. I didn't rate it because I was in poor form, but I can now say that the 2012 has proved that this beer is quite incredible. I almost wish that Mike didn't send it, because now I need more. 1,101 charactersclaaark13, Feb 08, 2013

A - Pours a nearly opaque dark, dark brown body that is just a shade below black. Holding this up to the light creates a sheen of dark red illumination through the beer. One finger of light khaki foam forms but doesn't stick around long. A swirl generates a long lasting lace of tiny bubbles that falls down slowly leaving behind some alcohol legs. 
S - As soon as I cracked the bottle I got a huge whiff of bourbon and oak. The nose is strong on the dark fruits and vanilla. Dates, raisins, and mincemeat. A warming blast of alcohol followed by smooth and rich caramel, brown sugar, toffee, and marsh mallow. Spicy and woody with a lingering ethanol presence. The aroma does not hide its alcohol, instead it puts it on full display like a fine high proof bourbon.
T - Caramel, marshmallow, molasses, brown sugar, maple, raisins and some chocolate. Smooth and earthy english toffee with a smooth oak and vanilla finish. A very complex drinker with a plethora of sweet and decadent flavors attacking your tongue. The alcohol has a pleasing burn on the end.
M - Medium bodied and slick, well carbonated. Probably not for those who don't enjoy boozy beers. 
O - Very impressive BA old ale. Been wanting to try this beer for a long time and its certainly lived up to the hype. This beer is drinking phenomenally out of the gate, I have no idea why anyone would intentionally age this beer. Forever ISO! 1,518 charactersdavey101, Feb 06, 2013

Thanks, whartontallboy!
(Aged for 1+ year)
Murky dark brown and dark copper in color with a very small light brown head. Leaves the glass with an oily sheen, and only small specks of stick. Appropriate, though not particularly pretty, though that isn't exactly expected with a beer of this style.
The aroma is superb, and one of the best I've experienced within the style. Layers of caramels and toffees, earthy and vanilla-forward bourbon, some oak, along with marshmallow create something truly exceptional. A bit of an alcohol in the aroma prevents this from reaching perfection.
The flavor is, however, perfect. As with the aroma, the complex layers of caramels, toffees, marshmallow, bourbon, vanilla, and alcohol combine for the ultimate drinking experience. Such a delight.
Medium to near full in body, with moderate though creamy carbonation. Exceptionally drinkable.
The ultimate benchmark within the style. Perfection. 968 charactersehammond1, Feb 03, 2013

The beer is brown in color. Viscous looking beer. Light film of foamy head on top of it. Not much. Looks is similar to the original one.
The aroma shows more presence of vanilla. Caramel malts in there too. Sugar and possibly some rum. In the mouth, the vanilla is strongly present. More complex. Full bodied. This is an excellent beer. A true sipper. The alcohol is present and provides good warmth to the body.
Love this old ale.

4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A: Pours a muddy, murky dark brown. Almost no head to speak of and no lacing. Not a particularly good looking beer, but it is in a charming way, exactly what you expect from Kuhnhenn. 
S: This smells amazing. Caramel, toffee, tons of dark fruits, bourbon, a sweetness that has a vanilla/marshmallow character.
T: The lofty expectations established by the nose were somehow exceeded by the very first sip. Phenomenal. First thing coming to my mind is raisins or figs soaked in bourbon with a bit of dark brown sugar sprinkled on top. A sweet beer, but brilliantly balanced by the bourbon, oak, and underlying roasted malt. Picking up so many flavors, including caramel, toffee, vanilla, even maple syrup. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden for a 13.5% beer.
M: Thick and syrupy. Very little carbonation which works well with the thickness. 
O: One of the better beers I have had recently. Simply fantastic and something I would recommend to anyone. Flavor and aroma rival any other beer in the style. 1,006 charactersdbc5, Jan 24, 2013

Appearance: Syrupy murky brown. As expected not much head or head retention. Not a beautiful beer, but works for the style.
Aroma: Incredible. Waves of dark fruit, bourbon, caramel, toffee. Some chocolate undertones and definite sweetness.
Taste: Just as good as the nose. Vanilla, caramel, bourbon. Lots of dark fruit from the base beer. Rich and decadent. Sweet but not cloying. A really interesting earthy hop tone creeps in the more you drink. Can't decide 100% how I feel about it. Regardless, this joins a handful of other beers on my "I'd like to have six ounces of this every night before bed" list.
Mouthfeel: Not much carb. A bit on the syrupy side, but appropriate for what it is. Rich and decadent. Drinks like it should.
Overall: Easy to see why this is so highly rated and it deserves every point of it. Marvelous stuff. Perfect sipping, cold weather beer. 937 charactersjacewg, Jan 21, 2013

A - opaque brown with hints of a ruby tinge in the light near the edges. Thin ring of reddish-tab foam clings to the glass with each sip. 
S - big malty sweetness with subtler bourbon notes than many barrel aged offerings I've tried. 
T - wonderfully executed balance of smooth bourbon character with toasted malt, dark candied fruits (black cherry, Cabernet grapes), and hints of chocolate. 
M - thick, but not syrupy and surprisingly little alcohol heat or tingle considering the ABV. There is a hint of it on the back of the tongue in the aftertaste. This could sneak up on you. 
O - if you have the chance to try it, particularly on draft, don't miss it. 714 characterssmalenberg, Jan 18, 2013

2011 vintage poured into snifter
Pour: Color is a dark murky brown reminding me of very dirty water. No head to speak of but does leave a small collar around edge of glass. No light penetrating this at all. Not a pleasant looking beer to be honest.
Smell: Well here we go! Right up front is a big punch of bourbon and a huge sweet dark fruit component. I get booze soaked raisins and figs and plums. I get toffee, butterscotch, molasses, vanilla, marshmallow, and caramel. Now this is one hell of a nice smelling beer!
Taste: First sip had me reeling and I said out loud, this is fantastic! I taste initially the sweet toffee, caramel and vanilla. This yields to the dark fruits noted in the smell and then the alcohol and bourbon take hold on the finish and linger in the aftertaste. The barrel character really shines at the end and in the fantastic aftertaste with some wood notes rounding it out. A sweet beer for sure but does not get cloyingly sweet as everything seems to be in harmonious balance. Let me note that at 13.5% abv I would like to know how it is so well hidden? A slight burn but very enjoyable because it lets me know I am drinking a well crafted beer.
Mouthfeel: Medium to reaching for a full feel. I think it is the sweet sticky like quality that gives it the feel here. No carbonation really to cut the sweetness but I don't care. Sticks to my lips and tongue with syrup like consistency that has me craving more.
Overall: First time for me with this one and I have to say it has lived up to it's hype. I find this to be a fantastic sipping beer with absolutely everything I look for in this style. I am now on an indefinite ISO for this beer. I truly can not say enough good things about this beer. Hits all the marks for me! Well minus the appearance but honestly who the fuck cares what it looks like when it smells and tastes this good!! 1,900 characterssleuthdog, Jan 02, 2013
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Drove out to Kuhhenn's in Warren, wanted the 2012 4D but was also offered the bourbon barrel version, opted four the bourbon. Provided in their own Kuhnhenn tulip glass. 
A: What a sight, a deep almost opaque cloudy/murky maroon/brown color, with not much much head, limited to a lighter color brown hugging the sides of the glass with bits of lacing here and there. 
S: Smells delicious, caramel, brown sugars, malts, yeast, honey, and booze.
T: Wow. What a taste, such sweetness, honey, brown sugars, caramel, toffee, malts, yeast, all contrasted by that kick in the teeth bourbon/whiskey after burn along with that booze. What a mix, that was incredible. To be enjoyed in a slow and un-rushed fashion. 
M: Rich, medium body beer right here. Medium carbonation. Sumptuous and complex flavors, rich sweetness paired with the jaw jacking bourbon backlash. It was intense and strong after taste, but none the less, very good.
O: This was outside the box, the unexpected. Paid $8 for the tulip, fairly reasonable for what I got, some city bars charge $8 for bud shit lights, this was worth every penny and then some. Kuhnhenn is an incredible place to be and an incredible brewery, I recommend visiting the brewery if you can, as well as trying this beer. 1,258 charactersMavigo, Dec 30, 2012

Smell: bourbon, booze, brown sugar. dark fruits. vanilla and toffee.
Taste: opens up with caramel and toffee. bourbon and vanilla, along with some oak. dark fruits and alcohol.

A – This beer pours murky, almost muddy raisin color with absolutely no head. Swirling the glass barely creates some light bubbles that form at the edges. I finally understand what people say when they describe legs on a beer. This one coats the sides of the glass and then slides down slowly.
S – Woah! Huge bourbon aroma, with oak, rum soaked raisins, prunes, vanilla and hints of cocoa round out the nose. I’m not a huge fan of “Olde Ales” usually due to the overbearing aromas and extremely high ABV, but this is a wonderful smelling beer.
T – This beer starts off extremely sweet, with sweet booze soaked raisins, dark stone fruits, fig, vanilla and leather. The finish has a slight coffee like bitterness, but is still very sweet.
M – Thick and slick with very minimal carbonation. For the 13.5% abv, this beer isn't as warming as I would expect to be. For the style of beer that this is I would expect nothing else.
O – As I mentioned, I’m not the biggest fan of the style, but this is a great beer. Very drinkable for the high ABV. Really a great beer. 1,181 charactersdubinsky, Dec 25, 2012

2010 bottlng. A dark murky brown pour that is like a swamp after a flood. Not pretty but to the style. 
The smell conjures up coffee, toffee, and booze. Kalhua almost. My father says high surfactant-ness on the brew. Good luck knowing what that is. 
The mouthfeel lacks cabonation. Who cares once you get into the old ale stuff, especially aged this is par for the course. 
More toasted coconut, burnt toffee, dark roasted mocha coming out. Caramel bomb shining through as it opens. 
Overall well enjoyed. 534 charactersPatrickbrusil, Dec 24, 2012

I do still have a bottle of this in the cellar (thanks, Matt), and one day I plan on opening it side by side with the regular 4D.
Dark brown pour, nearly opaque, surprisingly (considering the ABV) capped with a relatively substantial beige head that receded to a thin wispy layer, leaving oily streaks on the glass. The aroma was so much of what I enjoy in this style, creamy caramel, vanilla, bourbon-soaked oak, dark fruit, brandy-like booze. The taste reflected the aroma, thick caramel and brown sugar, vanilla, woody bourbon, plums, raisins. Great, though unlike some other big old ales and barleywines, the flavor seemed to fade a bit as it warmed...maybe it was just my palate adjusting and/or numbing to the alcohol, which was definitely present, but relatively well-hidden. Smooth, full mouthfeel, low carbonation, appropriately, and a great sipper overall. Looking forward to trying it again. 979 charactersRifugium, Dec 18, 2012

a - pours a gnarly looking, murky brown with no head whatsoever. kinda looks like swamp water. leaves a single, fine ring of lacing around the edge of the glass. 
s - carmel, leather, vanilla, bourbon. 
t - massive carmel malt with lots of other little things going on. notes of raisin and fig, vanilla, faint leather. still has ample hop bitterness to counter the malty sweetness. finishes boozy and very dry.
m - full bodied. slightly chewy, lacking in carbonation, finer co2 profile, big alcohol warmth.
o - pretty good, but doesn't hold a candle to beers like hotd adam. nice flavor but lacking in some other areas, and still pretty hot after almost two years. looking forward to this years batch. will likely revisit this review with a fresher bottle. 806 charactersdivineaudio, Dec 13, 2012

A- Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thin cap that dissipates almost instantly, with no lacing.
S- Bourbon is prominent with notes of oak, coconut, caramel, vanilla, burnt toast and a bit of dark chocolate
T- Bourbon hits the palate first followed by some sweetness with caramel, cherry, coconut and maple as well as a hefty dose of roast at the finish.
M- Low carbonation with a syrupy body that finishes a bit hot
O- This is a big beer in regards to ABV as well drinkability. It took me some time to get through my 3 oz pour. This could use a couple more years to potentially smooth out since it was quite hot and bourbon heavy. 729 charactersiadler, Nov 25, 2012
3.99/5  rDev -11.3%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip. Aged for a minimum of nine months in used bourbons barrels. 
Pours a deep, syrupy burgundy. Milky with yeast. Not many bubbles arise; a hard pour delivers a quarter inch of light tan head. Not the best-looking brew. 
But the aroma. Oh, the aroma. The most intense caramel/toffee/bourbon/vanilla. I'm looking at the glass three feet away on the table and can pick out nuances. Crazy-rich. Brown sugar and maple come out upon closer inspection, with softer milk chocolate.
A two-step flavor. The front is all toffee-covered in chocolate. Tangy cherry as well. The swallow brings the rich heaviness I expected. Maple syrup, melted chocolate, vanilla bean, bourbon. Sweet, heavy.
Velvet-smooth and full-bodied, like heavy cream. The alcohol is giant and unavoidable, arriving at the swallow with heat in the throat and fire in the nostrils. A light tingle of carbonation.
Very rich, very sweet. Maybe a touch too much sugar. Not a ton of depth, but a ton of flavor. 987 charactersPhelps, Nov 22, 2012

Lots of dark fruits, figs, plums, etc. with candi sugar, sweet dark malts, bourbon, vanilla, coconut, toffee, and caramel. Taste is sweeter than the nose alluded to. Plenty of the dark fruits, sweetness, toffee, peanut brittle, butterscotch, caramel, bourbon, light alcohol heat, vanilla, coconut, light notes of dark chocolate and toasted marshmallow. The carbonation is light-medium, body is medium-full, consistency is full and filmy, and the finish is mellow compared to the flavor.
Overall quite a nice beer. I'm not sure it's the best bourbon barrel aged old ale I've had, but still very good and definitely one that's worth a try if you can get your hands on it. 753 charactersmatttttYCE, Nov 19, 2012

Pour: An incredibly ugly muddy brown with barely a head. Yuck this beer looks awful. But screw it,
Smell: Really awesome bourbon up front, followed by some nice chewy dark fruits, including figs and raisins. Really awesome toffee and caramel mix in.
Taste: Incredibly complex. The barrel aging comes on strong, but gives way to awesome vanilla, butterscotch, and toffee. Chewy raisins follow, with a lot of figs. Almost a sweet breadyness as well.
Mouthfeel: Pretty hefty bourbon warmth, but I'm okay with sipping this. Really relieved this is not too sweet either.
Overall: Awesome Old Ale. They nailed everything here, don't be fooled by the looks. 718 characterscfrances33, Nov 08, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
2010 Vintage. 
Appearance: BB4D pours out thick and viscous and appears dark brown in the glass, with a back light showing the body to be moderately opaque and deep red in colour. A rough pour yields a small tan coloured head. The head lasts fairly well and leaves a few spots of lace, while a swirl coats the glass in heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: The initial nose offers a massive blast of delicious bourbon, sweet caramel and vanilla. As the beer begins to warm the base beer begins to emerge, with notes of: Dark fruits (figs, plums, dates and raisins), dark brown sugar, dark bready malts, dark treacle, toasted malt, some milk chocolate and a light earthy note. 
Taste: As with the nose, the flavour offers a ton of bourbon up front, as well as some warming alcohol. As the beer warms, the base beer begins to emerge, but it remains very bourbon forward. Notes include: Sweet caramel, toffee, vanilla, butterscotch, brown sugar, dark fruits (plums, figs, dates and a touch of raisin), some toasted notes and a touch of molasses. 
Mouthfeel: As with the standard 4D, the mouthfeel here is absolutely perfect - full bodied and fairly sticky, with a medium-low level of fantastically smooth carbonation. 
Overall: BB4D is a fantastic barrel aged old ale, but I am not sure that the barrel aging has vastly improved the base beer. I love the bourbon character, but it seems to hide a little of the complexity that was on offer in the flavour of the base beer. 1,542 charactersThehuntmaster, Nov 03, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Small hiss as I pop the cap. Pours deep brown with light, but steady carbonation. No lasting head to speak of for the most part. Lovely auburn highlights on the sides of the glass. Legs apparent as I swirl the glass. This is a big beer. 
S - Huge bourbon, vanilla, coconut, molasses, and burnt sugar. A beautiful, inviting nose. Just divine. 
T - As the nose suggests: Sweet dark caramel, vanilla and coconut, more molasses and burnt sugar flavors. Sweetness gives way to a firm hop bitterness, sweet alcohol heat, and tannins that dry the finish off wonderfully. Booziness lingers in a delightful way. 
M - Full bodied, of course, but with a dangerous crispness on the end. 
O - Have been waiting to try this for quite some time, and I'm really happy to have had the chance. This beer's reputation is well deserved. One of the best BA beers I have ever had. Just perfect. 880 charactersSummitVA, Oct 28, 2012

Cheers to the ever generous aasher for sending this over in a trade. Thank you, Al!! 
Pours a clear, dark stained chestnut with reddish highlights at the edges. Head formation was next to nil, likely affected by the 13.5% ABV. Big booze evident in the aroma along with molasses, caramel, and chocolate covered raisins. Flavor skews heavily towards malty sweetness. Nods at chewy caramel candies, dried prunes, and sugar cookie. Not as chewy on the palette as some examples and carbonation is modest. 
Definitely a sipping beer with heavy malt sweetness and slowly unraveling depth of flavor. Digging it. Thanks again, Al! 637 charactersBrewerB, Oct 23, 2012

Pours an opaque toffee brown color with a thin beige head. Fades completely into a bubbled collar with little to no lacing. 
Intense nose with a complex blend of toffee, caramel, toasted bread and barrel character. Plenty of syrupy bourbon with residual vanilla and oak tannin. Touches of dark fruit with burnt sugar and raisin.
Swirling mix of toffee, caramel and dark fruit up front. Raisin and burnt sugar with bourbon heat and decadent sweetness. Candied notes with rich layers of roasted dark malts. Intermittent notes of vanilla and toasted bread with brown sugar. Finishes with heavy boozy warmth and syrupy sweetness. 
Fuller body, decent carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. This is a phenomenal barrel aged beer exploding with wonderful flavors and scents - I wish this was the norm and not the exception. 857 charactersxnicknj, Oct 14, 2012

Pours dark brown with a small, light, tan head which vanished quickly, leaving no lacing, as expected. The aroma is very nice, and I could pick it up without needing to bring the glass close to me. There is bourbon, toffee, vanilla, raisins, and brown sugar.
The flavors come together beautifully. The beer is sweet as expected, but is not cloying in the least. Just like the aroma, there is bourbon, toffee, vanilla, raisins, and brown sugar. The bourbon is not hot in the least. It meshes perfectly with the other flavors, and produces a beautifully made beer.
Medium to full bodied with light carbonation. Somewhat creamy. The alcohol is very well hidden for 13.50 % abv, and as I mentioned earlier, there is no alcohol heat. Wow, this is a great beer. Try it if you get a chance. 831 charactershardy008, Oct 13, 2012

Appearance: Pours a dark mahogany color with some light coming through the pour. There is just a small layer of light tan head that goes away very quickly.
Smell: Just a touch sweeter than the regular version. Lots of dark fruit, caramel, and brown sugar. The bourbon is definitely there, but the overall smell is incredibly smooth. Some toffee and vanilla show up as well.
Taste: This one is incredibly smooth. Sweet caramel up front with some dark fruit notes. None of the tart notes show up as they did in the regular version. Some heat from the alcohol and bourbon. Some oaky notes in there too. The finish is hot and just a little bitter.
Mouthfeel: The body is just on the thick side of medium with mild, tingly carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: I enjoyed this version a little bit more than the regular version. I thought it was slightly under carbonated, but the depth and complexity of flavors was very nice. I'll definitely have this again given the chance. 1,065 charactersoline73, Oct 09, 2012

Possibly the most viscous pout I've ever seen. It's like olive oil, but the color of used motor oil. Really clings to the glass when you swirl it.
S: Holy diabetes, batman, this smells like marshmallows, maple syrup, and brown sugar with hints of oak, alcohol, and leather. I'm honestly scared to taste this!
T: Much better than I expected from the nose, as the bourbon comes through much stronger. Prunes are an addition to the flavors listed above. Still too cloyingly sweet by far.
M: Here's where this beer shines, or at least gets points for being unique and impressive. The only beer I can compare it to in thickness and consistency is bcbs. In that beer, though, it works really well with the heat and roasty bitterness. Here, it enhances the sense that you are drinking syrup from the bottle. Still impressive.
O: I'm more than a bit disapointed with this one, but I did have pretty high expectations. Still, for an old ale, I'd like to see more leathery, oxidized, and/or tannic flavors to balance out the sweetness. I guess if you have a real sweet tooth, this beer is for you; otherwise steer clear. 1,205 characterseatabagofbooger, Sep 01, 2012

Big thanks to Jebus3515 for this one
Pours a rather translucent chestnut brown body with no head or lacing whatsoever.
The bourbon is strong with this one. Huge bourbon notes sting the nostrils while figs/raisins hold steady. Plums, brown sugar and vanilla round out the nose.
Ok. So, bourbon takes control early and often here. Raisins/figs with brown sugar and plums through the middle before everything gives way to vanilla and more bourbon.
Full, rich body. Fusel alcohol hurts the overall smoothness and delivers an oily feel. Finish is bourbon heat and vanilla.
Overall, this is a damn fine old ale. The barrel aging definitely takes its toll on some of the finer points of the reviewing process, but this beer is a damn good example of the style. A great sipper after dinner. 837 charactersColForbinBC, Aug 21, 2012

A - Deep brown with a very nice and clean look to it. It actually has a nice quarter inch off-white head comprised of many small bubbles. Actually one of the nicest heads I've seen on a high ABV old ale
S - Wow, the nose blows you away as soon as you get close to the glass. It is strong and complex. Strong caramel, vanilla, and oak from the bourbon intermingle with dark fruits like plums and candied dates. There is also a hint of marshmallow that intermingles as well. It balances the oak and bourbon perfectly with the other flavors as it gives it another dimension instead of overpowering.
T - Initally big hints of caramel, marshmallow, and vanilla hit the tongue. Then, a slight dark fruit that reminds me of English Christmas pudding intermingles with a slight alcoholic kick. The finish is bourbon and oak that lingers on the tongue along with the dark fruit flavors. It manages to be sweet but not cloying and all the flavors meld together perfectly as one flows into the next. The alcohol is there but just enough to serve as a reminder that this is a big beer. 
MF - Smooth and velvety on the tongue. Medium body with a slight stickiness to it but still very smooth. There is light carbonation that comes in the finish that helps add to the bourbon and oak flavors
O - A splendid old ale from Kuhnhenn's that impresses from the moment you first get a whiff of it. It has a strong and complex nose that really blows you away. The flavors blend sweet, fruity and bourbony together perfectly so that the all play off of each other instead of one overpowering the rest of the beer. It reminds you why people will go to the winter solstice and stand outside in a Detroit winter to get some of this. 1,747 charactersjeonseh, Aug 19, 2012

Fantastic fragrance of dark fruits, chocolate, molasses, licorice, and bourbon. Taste very much follows the nose - though these is an amazing complexity here, in addition to the chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and bourbon notes, there are hints of oak, soy, and a hint of tobacco. Its sweeter than I imagined it would be, definitely more "lush" of a taste compared to other bourbon barrel aged beers I've had. Mouthfeel is very well balanced and very big, definitely a slow sipper sort of beer, though despite its ABV it doesn't show, its hidden quite well. This is a fantastic brew, quite unique, and deserves its position on the list. 723 characterssrv33, Aug 05, 2012

Aroma: Huge caramel, molasses and brown sugar upfront. Really nice bourbon and vanilla is also very forward along with hints of oak. Barrel forward yet really well balanced.

Cheers to charity!
A: Breathtakingly thick on the pour – I can’t remember having a beer that looked this syrupy. Lovely dark brown color, not letting much light through at all, with only a moment of filmy head. Looks like thick coffee liqueur, but with specks of brown lacing as the body moves around the glass.
S: Potent, delicious caramel scents waft up as soon as the glass gets anywhere near my face. Strongest of those scents I’ve ever encountered in a beer, bar none. Impressively rich tones of syrup, including toffee and maple, help push the huge caramel backbone to sweet glory. Loads of chocolate, bourbon, and oaky vanilla show that the barrels are there, as well. Smoke and raisin give it some traditional old ale character.
T: Pure malt with definite aged qualities. Caramel, vanilla, chocolate fudge, marshmallow, and toffee give this a sweet, yet refined palate; it’s not devastatingly sugary, in other words. Marginal tastes revolve around sweet gingerbread, along with ripe dates, a spattering of herbal hops, brown sugar, and dark, vinous raisin. Thick barrel and booze tastes provide a decadent wooden tone that leads into the finish. Aftertaste is a reminder that you just drank a bottle of malt, playing on residual sugars and dark, earthy fruit tastes in sticky fashion.
M: All the thickness you’d expect from a beer of this gravity, but with memorable heat. Medium-full and satisfying, but not mouth-coating.
O: Kuhnhenn seems to have been going for the old ale to end all old ales; and, alas, they’ve done it. Style-defining for barrel-aged old ales; it’s just the right mix of barrel, booze, and bold malt. A beautiful beer. 1,877 charactersBarryMFBurton, Jul 28, 2012

S: A strong sweet aroma. Caramel, toffee, sweet malts, oak, some booze and a bit of dark fruit in the background.
T: Opens with toffee and caramel notes followed by some dark fruit notes and an oak finish. The alcohol comes through a bit on the finish, but not as strongly as expected for a bourbon-barrel aged old ale. The sweetness is a bit cloying in my opinion.

A: Pours a half finger khaki colour head that quickly reduces to an edgewise floater. Fair cream and thickness. Awful retention, though the ABV is quite high indeed. Colour is a nontransparent dark vaguely fecal brown. Opaque. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Not appealing really at all. 
Sm: Heavy caramelized malt, English hopping (dirty floral), some biscuity yeast, and some cream. Strong malts, some oak barrel. Some boozy heat. An average strength aroma. Not horribly appealing. 
T: Biscuity yeast. Heavy malt caramelization provides the foundation. Dirty floral hopping is prominent to its detriment. Some heat. Heavy on the toffee - probably its best attribute. Maybe some oak; if so, it's buried. It's alright, but I don't care for it much. Maybe slight hints of licorice. Some spice. Not horribly complex, and not at all subtle. I don't see what all the hype is about. This is mundane. Overly sweet. 
Mf: Smooth and wet. Good thickness. Good carbonation. Suits the flavours in a general sense.
Dr: I'm severely disappointed by this beer. Hides its ABV quite well, but that's the best thing about it. I expected far more given the style. It's no North Coast Old Stock Ale. Pricey and over-hyped. I wouldn't get it again. I just don't get it. I'll go with a C+ for the well-hidden ABV, but I'm just damned disappointed.

A-- Poured a dark murky brown. Bits of ruby, that are close to purple looking. Just a bit of off white film. Obvious and thick alcohol legs and quick fading spotty lacing. Honestly quite ugly looking beer. 
S-- Oak, bourbon, vanilla, Carmel, toasted marshmallow, figs, alcohol and dark fruits. Really settled down into the barrel characters and marshmallow. Big massive nose. Insanely rich and powerful. 
T-- Big dose of alcohol off the bat. Bourbon, oak, thick and rich carmel, fig, and marshmallow. Only issue is the heat from the ABV but this is just silly in the taste. 
M-- Thick and rich. Slightly sweet. Might have needed a bit more time ageing to smooth out more. Lots of figs, toasted coconut, and stewed plumbs in the mouth. Quite slick and finishes with a bit of alcohol heat and a lot of toasted coconut. Nice. 
O-- Big massive sipper. Close to wine like in complexity. Lots of alcohol is the only real negative to this. Brilliantly done and just a treat to drink if you like high ABV and high gravity beers. 1,064 charactersmulder1010, Jul 04, 2012

The flavors are bourbon forward, caramel and brown sugar, dates, molasses and maple syrup, and a myriad of other dark fruits. I can tell this is fresh.
The mouthfeel is low carb and syrupy. 
I like this beer, about as much as i liked the non-Bal version. both are really nice. 572 charactersChadQuest, Jul 04, 2012

M. Perfect, there is no other way to describe it. Low carbonation and not to thick makes for an amazing feel.

pours a murky mahogany / chestnut tone while yielding virtually no head even with a somewhat aggressive pour - not surprising in the least. obvioulsy no lacing, either. bold, malt-forward nose is rife with with bourbon, caramel / toffee, brown sugar, dark fruits, and a little vanilla. mouth-watering.
as enticing as the aroma is, i think the flavor is even better. just tones of the aforementioned characters with a few others i didn't get in the nose. some molasses, oak, and a hint of chocolate. chewy, full-bodied mouthfeel with slightly below average carbonation.
overall, enjoying the hell out of this one; so rich and flavorful but doesn't stray into the cloying sweet. great bourbon presence. just a phenomenal beer - world class.

Aroma is bourbon soaked raisins, with some heavy burnt sugar and caramel. The bourbon is not very strong.
Similar flavors. Loads of caramel and molasses with big time sweetness. A little bit of vanilla with well integrated bourbon. 
Pretty thick mouthfeel with almost zero carb making it cloying sweet at times.
Pretty good. Much better than the regular version although I'm just not a huge fan of the base beer. That said, the bourbon is very well integrated and adds a lot to this one so it was still enjoyable. As with all Kuhnhenn overall rating takes a hit because it is almost completely flat decreasing the drinkability. 694 charactersjmarsh123, Jun 21, 2012

A Pours dark brown and deep dark brown/black in the glass. Almost no head on the pour which I expected from the ABV. Nice signs of carbo when I play with it.
S Big time sweetness on the nose. Sweet rum soaked raisins and dark fruits follow burnt sugar and mollasses and caramel. Musty, dank, sweet, and a some booze. Smells fantastic.
T Follows the nose closely. Caramel, mollasses, vanilla, big sweet malts, wood and bourbon. Some smoke and leather hiding in there as well. There's so much going on with this one, I could focus on a few flavors each sip and keep getting something different. Bourbon is really well integrated in this one. really close to a 5.
M Big full feel is accompanied by a very low carbonation which completely suits this beer. Thick and chewy makes this a perfect sipper.
O I'm completely floored by this beer. The nose and taste are top top notch and everything else was great as well. It's great to get a beer that absolutely lives up to the hype. Permanently ISO 1,105 charactersGushue3, Jun 13, 2012

A very dark brown with a deep dark amber edge, well the edge goes to the middle of the liquid. A thumbs width of dark tan head fizzes out pretty fast and leaves no lace, about what you'd expect with the alc%, lots of streams of tiny bubbles though going up the side of the glass
S molasses and dark nutty toffee mix well with some mellow smokey, woody bourbon notes and a little booze. The roasted marsh mellow I read on the bottle is there but I doubt I would have picked up on it without it being pointed out. just a hint of overripe fruit pops up, smells pretty sweet in more ways then one
T even more bourbon notes then the nose but everything else is still there with a little cola, smokey and not overly sweet but lots of caramels both soft and burnt. Its a little boozy but if it wasn't at this strength and age I'd be concerned 
M thick and syrupy with perfect carbonation, a little sticky and just a little heat but all things considered the booze is very well concealed, my mouth has a little smokey woody burn left behind but I'm digging it for sure, I'll be tasting this tomorrow at this rate 
O near perfection in nearly every area, this ones so far above the non-barreled version I'm thinking my non-BB4d bottle was slightly tainted. 
The hype is real, but I'm wondering if they left some bourbon in the barrel. This is a completely different beer to the regular version I tried recently and I'm blown away by the difference. Thanks again liamt07 for this gem of a bad boy 1,558 characterswordemupg, Jun 10, 2012

4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle (2010 vintage) poured into a Cigar City snifter...having this immediately following a BBBW '10...hoping it compares favorably.
A - Pours a deep brown color, a bit on the muddy side. No attempt at forming a head ever occurs on the pour and only a very thin collar is formed on the edge of the glass...no lacing.
S - Immediately my nose is filled with the scent of prunes...in fact, almost straight prune juice at first. Behind the prunes is some dark caramel, a bit of molasses, burnt dark brown sugar, toffee, raisins. hints of vanilla, mild booze. Smells very good, but doesn't really stand out above other offerings out there.
T - Quite sweet overall...tons of caramel, loads of dark fruits, especially the prunes from the aroma, a bit of hoppy bitterness, touches of citrus - maybe tangerines or orange peel, super sweet, buttery toffee, burnt sugar, molasses, vanilla, bourbon. Super complex, but maybe a bit too sweet for my personal tastes.
M - Medium-full bodied with a minimal carbonation that fits rather well. Very sweet overall with lots of burnt sugar, toffee, caramel, molasses. Booze is amazingly well controlled...barrel is evident but so well done and controlled. Really no booziness here, just complementary flavors from the barrel.
O - Very hard to believe this is a 13.5% barrel aged beer. Booze is so subtle and works very, very well. Wish I had this on its own instead of just behind the BBBW. The BBBW is so balanced and outstanding I think it outshined this a bit and diminished my impression. This is an excellent beer, perhaps a bit too sweet, but still under control. A slow sipper that has great complexity of flavor and aroma. Definitely a great beer worthy of seeking out. 1,718 charactersportia99, Jun 09, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle. 2011 vintage. Poured this into my Lost Abbey tulip glass. Enjoyed this after Old Curmudgeon and Better Half, so the taste buds might be a bit off. Getting drunk for sure at this point.
A: It pours a complleletly cloudy dark dark amber. Very murky looking. No head on this big big beer. Can't tell, but it doesn't look to have tons of carbonation. Definitely get those alcohol feet though, for sure.
S: Delicious bourbon and sweet malts. Pulling lots of toasted caramel/toffee notes. The bourbon is there with some vanilla from the oak aging. I do get some dark fruit: figs, raisins, plums maybe. And as others have mentioned, some chocolate is hidden in there too.
T: This is a complex beer to say the least. Right up front you get lots of toffee notes. Burnt brown sugar, molasses, caramel, etc. There is actually a little touch of tartness from the dark fruits in there initially too. Then it leads into the BA'ing with some vanilla sweetness. That chocolate that I smelled is there but buried beneath so many other things. LONG finish.
M: Full bodied. It's a mouth coating beer. Seeing as this is a fresh batch, you do get some of that alcohol and warming in the throat as well.
O: Even with the fresh batch booziness and all the hype for Better Half, I liked this more on this night. I really wonder what more time would do to this beer. Even better I assume.
M: Medium and times full. 1,408 charactersinlimbo77, Jun 07, 2012
4.41/5  rDev -2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 vintage. Opened alongside the '11 at a recent tasting, and we agreed the '10 was clearly superior (with the differences not attributable to age).
Dull, murky-looking pour, but this brew makes up what it lacks in looks with personality galore. Caramel, oak, dark raisins, bourbon, aged booze, tons of malt. Love the aroma!
Malts and caramel flow freely around my taste buds while the bourbon and aged booze fall into a supporting role. Dark fruits make a brief appearance before settling into a slightly sweet finish, augmented by a nice warming sensation in the back of my throat. Viscous body nails the delivery. Very complex, and tasty as hell.
As stated above, the '11 couldn't hold a candle to the 2010. Whatever they did to that earlier batch was magical, and I want more! 785 charactersbrystmar, Jun 06, 2012

A - Looks like HotD Adam. Murky, dark brown coloring. Almost zero carbonation, retention, or lacing. Alcohol legs abound. 
S - Completely insane, unadultered toffee and caramel notes here. Like I can't even express how big the caramel is in this one. Behind that, barrel notes lie. Bourbon, some oak, a touch of different chocolates blended (baker's, dark, milk). Faint alcohol solvency. 
T - Well-balanced vanilla, chocolate, and charred malt grains. The toffee and caramel pours over itself multiple times throughout mid palate. Molasses, brown sugar. Residual sugar and oaky aftertaste. 
M - Moderate body, good carbonation, semi-sweet finish. Very smooth overall.
D - This is a cool stout/barleywine hybrid, expressing some of the best notes of both styles but not overextending its reach in either direction. I want more. 908 charactersAuracom, May 31, 2012

The color of the body was dark mahogany, almost like coca cola, and the head formed a tight, lasting cafe-colored barrier near the rim of my snifter. Smells oaky and strong scents of alcohol. The taste was unbelievable. It was soooo smooth. This beer hit with many flavors-apple, bourbon, coffee, chocolate and finished with warm alcohol overtones. The alcohol was present thorough-out, but it seemed to bite more at the end. The mouth-feel was medium creme body. The body was consistent and allowed for "timed released flavor" waves to hit your palate. This beer is excellent and a must try for anyone passing through Warren, MI. The brewery is great too! It is very low-key and prices are very reasonable. 764 charactersdrinknewbelgium, May 29, 2012

Pours dark brown with reddish overtones; it's a little chalky-looking, no head, just some fizz on top. The smell is old flower water, molasses, something boozy. The taste is big: lots of maple and molasses, something plummy, a bit of bourbon in the finish. It's a little hot, though not too much so, thick and chewy, low in carbonation. A nice beer - would go well with a pecan blondie. 402 charactersgory4d, May 29, 2012

It pours a syrupy caramel brown color, some red hues when held to the light, no real head to speak of, but a thin layer of film appears at the rim of the glass, no lacing, in all honesty, the beer doesn't look like much. The aromas just jump out of the glass, huge toffee and sweet caramel notes, sugary malt, a nice layer of bourbon with some oak and woodiness as well as some char. The aroma is simply unbelievable, one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The flavors are wild, huge amounts of bourbon soaked toasted marshmallow, fantastic. Candied sugar creeps in at the end with caramel and toffee, unfortunately, there isn't enough bitter wood or char to completely counterbalance the sweetness and after about 3oz, the sweetness became a bit much for me. Still a wonderful palate but I feel that the flavors are a bit simpler than the wonderfully complex nose. The body is spot on, thick, syurpy with perfect medium/low carbonation.
Verdict: Awesome old ale, probably the best I've had and one of the better barrel aged beers I've ever tried. A home run. 1,131 characterskevanb, May 28, 2012

Vintage 2011
A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with 1/2 fingers width of light tan head which dissipates almost immediately. Leaves only the faintest spotty lacing.
S: Huge aroma that I can smell literally across the room. Big bourbon on the nose, oak, licorice, fig and dates, raisin, chocolate, awesome.
T: Wow, really good.  Bourbon, candied sugar, black licorice, big dark fruits including raisin. Cocoa and coffee on the finish. A subtle hint of hop bittnerness, vanilla, and a big toffee presence...and all of this is within the first couple of sips!  The aftertaste of dark fruits, cocoa and black coffee linger forever after each sip. Huge complexity and incredible balance. Wow. 
M/D: Smooth, so smooth, and very chewy. Carbonation is low, which is appropriate. Full bodied and coats the palate nicely. ABV is incredibly well masked, there is literally almost no hint of the almost 14%. Drinkability is surprisingly good but this is a sipper, no doubt.
O: What a beer! Absolutely fantastic.  Not that much different from the regular 4D, but it doesn't need to.be.  Te standard 4D is incredible in its own right, and the bourbon barrel again here is not dramatic, but is a nice addition to an already incredible base beer.  World class.   1,305 characterszac16125, May 26, 2012

Boy oh boy, what a mix of flavors! Marshmallow, caramel, sweet bourbon, oak, toasted grain and deep sweet malts, mocha, slight biscuit, and a sweetness in the finish from the malt and bourbon.
I thought this would be a lot different than the regular 4th d, but it was as bourboney as id imagined once I discovered they brewed this, not complaining, still a wonderfully complex beer with perfect balance and taste. Alcohol is very well hidden beneath the plethora of multiple flavors.

Poured like a sun brewed sweet tea with a beige head that swells briefly after a rigorous pour, only to subside back out to a thin ring that will go on to provide distinct lacing. Sexy legs follow shortly after.
The bourbon barrel is the dominant player in the nostrils. Bits of graham cracker, smokey wood, caramel and toffee malts, figs and raisin, burnt sugar, more bourbon. The balance of all these flavors really overshadow the massive ABV.

A - Murky dark brown with a very thin layer of light brown head that quickly receded to a ring around the glass.
S - The bourbon is the dominant up front without being overpowering. Oak and a light vanilla aroma also come through from the barrel. The base beer adds sweet toffee and dark caramel aromas and lighter notes of dark fruit, raisins and figs.
T - Bourbon, oak and vanilla up front that are in the perfect proportion with the base beer flavours. Toffee, dark caramel, molasses, raisins, dark fruit, figs. A nice sweet vanilla and bourbon finish. The sweetness of the base beer is perfectly complimented by a slightly warming ABV. Remarkable.

This beer pours a medium bodied, very sticky dark molasses brown in color with no head at all. The nose is unreal. There is so much oak, vanilla, molasses, toffee, light cocoa, bourbon barrel and raisin. It is sweet yet ridiculously complex. It smells like an aged Mother of All Storms, but better. The flavors are rich and malty. There is loads of residual sugar with a touch of alcohol. Being 13.5% the alcohol is barely noticeable. Vanilla, oak, bourbon, raisins, figs, and molasses are featured in a true masterpiece. The flavor is everything that you would hope it to be. It drinks medium in body with plenty of residual sugar and a resonating after taste. It is all done so well. This is the best barrel aged old ale around if you ask me. Bourbon Barrel 4th Dementia is world class! 827 charactersaasher, May 07, 2012

Pours a dark ruby, looks black unless you hold it to the light. Very light carbonation is visible. Small head, about 1/8", which recedes very quickly. 
Smells of dark fruits, prune and raisin and maybe a little bit of candied cherry? A lot of alcohol sweetness, kind of a toffee/vanilla smell that mixes really well with the fruits. Very nice.
Taste follows the smell, but the dark fruit notes are not quite as strong. It starts with the malty toffee kind of sweetness, which is followed by the dark fruit flavors. Some nice barrel characteristics, and a little bit of alcohol warmth going down. The warmth is pleasant, never overwhelming. You can definitely taste the 13.5%, but it's not hot or unpleasant.
Mouth feel is fine. Slightly thinner and than I would like, with very little carbonation. It's good though.
Very drinkable beer. Pretty easy to put away a bottle on your own, but much more than that and it would probably get a little cloying. This is a fine beer though. Definitely the best old ale I've had. 1,084 charactersrodkin, May 04, 2012

Smells like it just cam out of the barrel. Just fantastic. Pretty boozy. Bourbon, dark fruit, raisin, caramel, molasses. 
Flavor is huge and not as boozy as I'd thought from the nose. There is a nice little touch of alcohol warmth after a sip. Big rich caramel and bourbon with dark fruit. Raisin, date and prunes. 
Mouth like syrup. Super sticky and palate coating. Low-med Carb. 
Overall it's a very good beer! I'd like to try it with age, but love it new. 529 charactersMrVonzipper, Apr 25, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 bottle poured into a Deschutes snifter at around 45 degrees. The pour has sort of a toasted caramel color - a dark red/orange/brown that builds into a nice dark brown in the glass. Barely any head - just a thin film in the middle of the class with a ring of roasted marshmallow bubbles.
Smells of oak, sweet bourbon syrup, roasted marshmallow, caramel, and a baked butter dough. The butter dough (i'm not sure how else to describe it, although i realize that is rather vague) keeps the back of the aroma faintly sweet and relaxing in what is otherwise a pretty forward hit of condensed flavors.
The first sip is decidedly sweet and syrupy at the onset, but quickly dissolves into an alcohol burn on the middle of the tongue and back of the throat. Flavors of bourbon-soaked raisins, toffee, buttered baguette, and a dark fruit spread dominate with a nice malted backing. It's a little thinner than i was anticipating, but not in any major way. The alcohol keeps it from sticking around too long, and the exhale flavors of hazelnut and bourbon are faint enough to keep lifting the glass.
This is a really wonderful sipper... I'm forcing myself to think of it as a slow sipper, because I could see moving through it more quickly than it requires. After being a little underwhelmed by the regular 4D, I'm really impressed with this - it's a strong, assertive ale that is much improved by the barrel aging. I'm looking forward to sitting on my other bottle until late next fall or so. 1,488 charactersfvernon, Apr 23, 2012

2011 vintage.
Pours a murky and almost opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form randomly around the glas on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and bourbon. Taste is of bourbon, wood, brown sugar, caramel/toffee, and malt. There is a slight sourness to the taste but nothing that really detracts from the flavors. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and very thick mouthfeel that lends to a very rich drinking experience. Overall, this is a fantastic barrel aged old ale with some very nice aromas and flavors. 713 charactersUCLABrewN84, Apr 21, 2012

12 oz bottle poured into a snifter
A: I have never seen a beer that looks like this. Absolutely no head, very little lacing. dark brown color (with a bit of reddish tone), it's defintitely not transparent, but not thick like a stout. It kind of looks like an unfiltered apple juice 
S: Bourbon, roated malts, maybe some dark fruits, I can also smell the booze
T: Bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, very sweet and boozy. In the middle, I can also taste something a bit tart? or sour? Very well done! 
M: Thick, smooth, very little carbonation
O: I enjoyed this one very much! I love bourbon aged beers, and this is definiely one of my top 3 I had. Glad I have another bottle on the way to age. 752 characterssukwonee, Apr 21, 2012

A: pours a dark brown with with some nasty dregs of a lighter brown color. Very cloudy, and no head, but still delcious and thick looking. 
S: huge bourbon aroma on this 2010 version of the BB4D, but it also has fruity smells of the old ale that are beginning to shine through, giving excellent balance. I get apple. 
T: everything from apple to raisin to bourbon to vanilla to sweet caramel shine in this beauty. Delicious. 
M: very low carbonation and heavy body make this an impressive old ale. Wish it had more carbonation. 
O: delicious beer, one of the best old ales I've had. The 2010 version that I am drinking has excellent balance. I can imagine the barrel flavors are unbelievable when it's fresh. 752 charactersHolland, Apr 20, 2012

Appearance: BB 4D comes looking still and thick, with no head in a quirky glass filled to the brim. Low carbonation and no lacing. Color is that of prune juice- not too appetizing. 
Smell: Beautiful, delicious. Port wine, raising, a rustic winery in La Rioja. Chocolate and caramelized sugar, plus coconut frosting. Toffee, hint of licuorice. 
Taste: Follows nose, with a more pronounced chocolate taste and a nice sweet-booze finish. It gets a little hot/cloying at times (not as balanced as, say, Old Stock), but still yummy. The raisin-dark fruit thing is really strong. Crushed grapes and cocoa powder. Hard toffee candy. 
Mouthfeel: Underwhelming. The lack of carbonation is startling, and the booze/sweetness (particularly as it warms up) can be overwhelming. Full flavor, medium body, low carbonation. Sticky-dry mouth and finish. 
Overall: Reminds me of a Harvest Ale on dope. Had it on a bottle, didn't love it, better on tap. Not super outstanding but fine. And better than regular 4D! 1,123 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Apr 19, 2012

Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours root beer brown with thin off-white head. Beautiful lacing that lasted extremely well throughout. Aromas of marshmallows, toffee, caramel, and hints of bourbon. Smooth, well-masked bourbon in the flavors along with caramel and some maple syrup. Amazing smooth mouthfeel with nice carbonation throughout. This is a beer I definitely want to try again! 531 charactersCuriousMonk, Apr 19, 2012

Purchased both from the brewery on our trip to Michigan.
A- Murky dark brown, almost black pour. Heavy pour and swirl leaves no head and no lacing. BUT the alcohol sticking to the glass is pretty amazing, it actually looks like it's staining the glass.
S- Massive bourbon aroma. Bourbon soaked raisins, bourbon soaked figs, bourbon soaked dates. Vanilla, brown sugar, molasses with a touch of licorice. Sweet dark chocolate and a touch of coffee. Leather and tobacco with a touch of alcohol.
T- Massive bourbon again. Just loads of sweet, sticky bourbon soaked dark fruits. Brown sugar and vanilla with less in the way of chocolate but the same if not more taste of coffee. Alcohol leaves a bit of a warmth but that is about it.
M- Full bodied, creamy and smooth. Sticky on the lips.
O- I downright loved the regular version. I honestly couldn't imagine how much better it could get. But in the back of my mind I know how regarded this beer is and how much I was looking forward to trying this. I was not disappointed at all. Super complex, well crafted. 1,107 characterskorguy123, Apr 17, 2012

T: Wow, that is sweet. TONS of caramel and vanilla followed by dark fruits. Such a sweet beer, I had a hard time finishing the half I poured myself.

A: Pours a medium brown in color with some dark amber hints when held up to the light. The beer has a thin light beige head that quickly reduces to a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Minimal lacing is observed.
S: This beer has a nice complexity to the aroma with some noticeable sweetness. There is some dark fruit sweetness with cherries and dates, some dark malts, and the heavy influence of the bourbon - some hints of oak, some hints of vanilla, and the actual bourbon smell.
T: The beer is sweet but not cloying. There is quite a bit of sweetness from the dark fruit - mostly cherries with some hints of dates. The beer has some dark malts and lots of flavor contribution from the bourbon barrel. I love the oakiness and smooth vanilla which are quite strong in the taste.
M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and creamy.
O: There is some alcohol present in this beer, especially as it warms up. The beer is a great sipping beer and has a wonderful complexity to the smell and taste. I enjoyed this beer but it was not super easy to drink and is definitely too strong to be sessionable. 1,162 charactersdbrauneis, Apr 15, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle courtesy of a great new trading partner - thanks! Poured in to a snifter.
Appearance: Pours a deep opaque mahogany, decadent looking, letting light slip in only around the very edges. A rather vigorous pour coaxes about half a finger of fawn head to the surface of this one, though it only sticks around for about a minute and change before settling down in to a thin but broad fog and a slightly more voluminous but dense collar. Agitation settles both some nice lacing on the sides of the snifter (which, despite the barrel aging and 13.5% abv price tag, actually has some heft and some sticking power, leaving nondescript blotches along the sides of the glass) as well as reveals the thickness of this beer vis a vis how long it takes the released carbonation to travel upwards (hint: it's very slow).
Aroma: An incredibly interesting and complex nose. Deep, fat, rich, and oaky, with almost no burn whatsoever. The base beer is prominent initially (though less as you bury your nose in it more and as it warms) and sits up front, and provides a solid foundation. Light fruits mingle very well with the barrel components (discussed below), but also well with the heavier fruits - dates, raisins, cherries, hints of (though not) fig - as well as cocoa and toffee. There are hints of darker malts, providing an earthier foundation than the other notes above suggest that they might provide.
The barrel here was very obviously bourbon or whiskey, and the marriage is very nice. Obviously, the spirits are fairly prominent - sweet bourbon with plenty of rye overtones accentuate both the (slight) twinge of alcohol as well as the thick sweetness of the fruity notes in the base beer. The other notes - dark oak, hints of vanilla, other very barrel-ish spice hints - are all right below the bourbon, and also a significant quantity of smoke. The only downside is the slight mingle of high-end fruity notes and alcohol esters - the combination comes a little too close to a chemical cleaning agent at points, maybe like Pine Sol or (at its worst) straight up isopropyl. 
Taste: There's the burn! Like the nose on steroids, but at 13.5%, that's at least partially to be expected. The base beer is still fat and prominent, darker here than it was in the nose, with more chocolate and caramel than dark fruits (but the dark fruits are still there, don't worry), but more light fruits, smoke, and esters. From tropical fruits at the top all the way down to smoky, chewy oak at the bottom, this one traverses the entire taste bud experience, but still has that pesky (and very intense) heat. 
Mouthfeel: Perfect, and likely this beer's best attribute. A fat, thick, chewy base beer, sugary and heavy, but dancing right along the "cloying" line with an expertly introduced amount of carbonation, well integrated, for a creamy, frothy frappe-like feel. 
Drinkability: Honestly, not as good as the KBBBW was. This one has way more heat and less of dynamicism between the barrel aging and the base beer - that is, the spiciness and strength of that base beer countered the barrel aging and intense alcohol overtones much better than this one does. That being said, this is still a pretty damn good beer, bursting with exciting and dynamic flavors, bright and energetic, while still a little mellow and refined. At 13.5%, I was pleasantly buzzed after finishing a bottle, so don't expect to down a six-pack of these (and if you do happen upon a six-pack of these, inform me immediately to assist with proper disposal), but it's worth seeking out, if not worth selling the farm for. 3,588 charactersCrellMoset, Apr 15, 2012

Aromas of oak, vanilla, dark fruits, prunes, raisins, intense caramel and a punch of alcohol.
Flavors of sweet, cloying caramel, oak tannins, vanilla, prunes, licorise, and plummy sweetness. A bite of alcohol heat at the back end of the sip.
Mouthfeel is thick, cloying, no hint of carbonation. Very full and almost syrupy. Some heat from the alcohol.

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 Bourbon Barrel 4th Dementia.
A- Pours a murky brown/mahogany with no real head, but just a small ring of bubbles.
S- Caramel, butterscotch, maybe a little butter, cinnamon apple, oak and bourbon. 
T- Sweet with prominent caramel. Molasses with hints of sugared plums, raisins and prunes dance in the background as oak and bourbon round out the finish. Definitely a sweeter beer, but the heat, while not nearly as powerful as a 13.5% alcohol barrel aged beer would suggest, is just enough to balance everything out. As I let it warm, I get a little hint of coffee bitterness/tartness on the end as well. Complex stuff. I would probably give this a 4.75 for taste, but I will round down just a bit.
M- Full bodied with very low carbonation. A bit syrupy in the mouth, but looses it a bit in the finish. Silky smooth, even considering the 13.5% alcohol and barrel aging.
O- I am very surprised at the approachability of this beer considering it is a bourbon barrel aged old ale weighing in at 13.5%. There is only a hint of heat on this, and it acts as a nice balance to the sweetness. I've had beers with less alcohol and much more age feel hotter (I'm looking at you, clowns at Goose Island). A very nicely crafted ale. One of the best, if not the best old ale I've tried so far. The only thing hampering its overall score for me is the appearance....but fortunately, its the least important factor when enjoying a beer in my opinion (so I bumped it up a bit to account for my overall enjoyment of the beer). 1,517 charactersTK5150, Mar 30, 2012

A: Looks exactly like the non-barrel aged version. It pours out of the bottle a hazy brown with a finger or so of light head. The difference is that the lacing and retention have taken a blow. Not really anything left to assess after only a few minutes.
S: If it's even possible, Barrel Aged 4D is more boozy than 4D. The Bourbon accents the alcohol, the combination of which overpowers the malt and dark fruits. Other characteristics are there, but bourbon, oak, and booze are just too strong for them to be taken seriously. As the beer warms, however, more roast and molasses come out.
T: The taste absolutely saves this beer and is the highlight of both offerings. My word, this is like a gourmet dessert. The booze is there, but allows the other parts to shine as well. Overall it's hard to describe. Mellowed to perfection between bourbon, caramel malts, molasses, deep dark fruits, booze, and vanilla. It's amazing how no one flavor comes out and dominates the beer. For this to have such a high ABV and be this mellowed, I'm blown away.
MF: I can't believe how fast I drank this beer. It's heavy with a low amount of carbonation, but the finish is clean and sweet and the booze is not even close to offensive. Complete 180 from the non-BA version.
O: Could not have been more impressed. I saw the "99" rating on here and had my doubts, but it delivered. The barrel treatment added to the beer, which is something I really look for in a good aged beer. I'm thinking a few years really helped curb the alcohol and make this beer stand out. I'm not a fan of Old Ales, but I highly recommend this. 1,618 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 25, 2012

Beer pours a mahogany brown, with some lighter brown colors, with no head on a vigorous pour.

Aroma hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Intense dark caramel, toffee, roasted nuts, chocolate, spicy graham cracker. Excellent barrel notes, vanilla, earthy and oak, aged leather. All this without smelling boozy at all, amazing. 
Taking a sip, sweet toffee and caramel mixing with the oak, chocolate, nutty flavors. As the beer warms on the tongue, some of the lighter vanilla and spices comes through. Finish is warming from the alcohol, but all the flavors linger on the tongue. 
Medium to full body, fairly well carbonated with a good amount of soft bubbles for such a big beer. Definitely a sipping beer, as it's packed with flavor.

Pours a dark mahogany color with.deep brown and red hues. Barely transparent. There is a small, thread thick layer of cream colored head. Oily lace.
The nose is a sweet malt overload. Bourbon is blended so nicely as it doesnt take the spotlight at all. Some soda bread, brown sugar, light vanilla, and deep caramel are noticed.
The taste has a full, rich abundance of caramel, biscuit-like malt, some prunes, raisin, toffee, all the while bourbon flows freely and evenly. Heat is noticeable but not deterring in the slightest. A bold flavor profile far from what others bring to the table.
Mouthfeel is big-bodied, rich, sweet, and beastly. Creamy with low levels of carbonation.

verrry murky deep brown with just a tiny half cm of film that laces slightly with each sip. didnt expect much head for the style and barrel aging.
very deep molasses, toffee, maple syrup, vanilla extract, hazelnut liqueur, some aged bourbon and a bit of oak. tiny bit of soy sauce. smells very nice. not too bourbon heavy, theres a ton of malty aromas intermingling in there.
again, molasses and maple syrup with brown sugar, dark caramel, hazelnut liqueur, lots of oak, a bit of smooth well-aged bourbon, some candied dark fruits, booze heat on the finish making this one a sipper that I can savor all night.
syrupy with little carbonation and a long-lingering sweet finish.
wow. I'm going to need to get a few more of these. I wonder how they age. I like how the bourbon aging was nowhere near the forefront, but instead added to the complex and deep flavor profile. love it. 895 characterssilentjay, Feb 25, 2012

3.94/5  rDev -12.4%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 served in my L.A. snifter. Bottle courtesy of Doodler.
A: Extremely dark brown. Aggressive pour yields minimal lacing. Good legs, however. Not an attractive beer, though. 
S: Intense nose - intense aromas from the barrel. (Vanilla, caramel, toffee). Prunes, brown sugar, molasses.
T: Very hot with more of the same barrel character detailed above. I really enjoy the caramel and honey laced through this one. The sweetness and bitterness offset to a fair degree, which is good, though I could use a bit less balance if I'm being honest.
M: Smooth and velvety. Despite the fact there's no carbonation in the appearance, there's enough in the body to keep this lively. 
Overall: Quite enjoyable, but it doesn't quite end up sublime for me. Far better than the bottles of Angel's Share (Bourbon) I've had, but it falls short of Hair of the Dog, IMO. Will have to give my 2011 bottle a couple more years to settle down. 925 charactersSarlacc83, Feb 20, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to 2BDChicago for satisfying this long-time want. Served at 53 degrees in my Ommegang tulip. 2011 vintage. Pours a brownish-plum hue with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that quickly disperses into a tight band around the shoulders. The nose on this beer is fantastic - toffee, butterscotch and bourbon notes - the nose screams sugary sweet and booze. Taste follows nose. All I can say is wow! The elements of the nose really coalesce nicely in the flavor profile. There is definitely a distinct ethanol presence as well as a trace of maple syrup. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a carbonation level that is just shy of still; there's just a residual tingle on the tongue. There's also surprisingly very little alcohol heat on this beer despite the 13.50% abv. This is a fantastic BA Old Ale. I'd love to sit on a couple of these to see how they develop over time. 892 charactersJwale73, Feb 20, 2012
4.94/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a dark, caramel brown with some light coming through. There is barely any head, a small tan ring is all that is produced.
S - The aroma is perfect. It's a perfect blend of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and malt sweetness. The bourbon character isn't at all overpowering. The base beer marries perfectly with the bourbon.
M - Full in body and very lightly carbonated. It's perfect for this style, any more carbonation would distract from the beer. Slightly syrupy, but nothing unexpected for the style.
T - Sweet caramel flavors come first along with some brown sugar. Vanilla notes and a mellow bourbon character with some alcohol heat follow. More caramel shows up in the finish.
Wow, this beer went from "meh I'd maybe like to try it", to "Yes, get some more" upon the first sip. This beer has a lot of depth and has several phases of flavors. Well worth seeking out. 880 charactersboralyl, Feb 19, 2012

The beer pours a rich looking dark brown with almost no carbonation. The nose is an intense bourbon with some malty sweetness. The taste doesn't dissappoint, straight bourbon vanilla. The aftertaste is money with syrupy sweetness and and a light tobacco bitterness. This is almost like drinking a glass of Utopias ...for way less money. This beer is banging, totally worth trying/ sharing. 416 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 19, 2012

Served in the Kuhnhenn logo belgian glass. Ruby brown body, very little head.

Flavor is deep waves of rich caramelly boozy richness. Not sure that the bourbon is coming through as much as I expected. Really a flavor bomb.

Pours a placid muddy brown. Uninspiring first act to be sure.
Smells of soaked cardboard, sherry, and cooked brown sugar. The second act is equally disappointing. 
This is one 12 oz bottle that will see it's end in a drain rather that either of our gullets. Oxidation has throttled the life from whatever had once set up residence here. Unbearable cloying sweetness lands the knockout punch.

4.54/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A 12 ounce bottle from JM03; I can not thank you enough for this bottle my friend. I can't seem to find any date information on the bottle except for "2010" printed above the brewer's description on the rear of the label. Poured into a DFH signature glass.
Pours an opaque brown and toffee color with some lighter muddy hues near the surface. Only a thin veil of khaki head develops, but nice swirling legs continually swim across the surface; little to no lacing as the wet bubbles just slide back into the body, though not surprising for the style and alcohol content. 
The aroma is of hazelnut, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, caramel, brown sugar, toasted malt, caramelized apple (very slight), plum, and dark cherries. The fruit notes are very light. Wonderfully balanced nose, with no ethanol to be detected. I don't consider myself creative, but I really couldn't ask for anything more in the nose. 
The taste begins with notes of toasted sugar, thin caramel, ample toffee, vanilla, and hazelnut. A good amount of wood (oak) comes through in the middle along with the bourbon and some warming alcohol. There's actually more alcohol here than I had anticipated, given the age on the bottle. Again, some slight fruits appear towards the end; apple, dark cherry, plum, and some date seem to show up. More oak and toffee on the finish. 
Mouthfeel is velvety, and while "heavier," it's not overly viscous or cloyingly sweet. The finish is rather dry, and is accentuated by a noticeable alcohol burn. It definitely lends itself to being an evening sipper, though in my case, I guess it's serving my late-Friday-afternoon-following-long-week wind down; I can already tell it will take me an hour or so to finish this delicious beast. 
Overall, this is a great example of what a bourbon barrel aged old ale or barleywine can be. I suppose I'm a bit partial, considering these happen to be my favorite styles, but I do thoroughly enjoy it. I do wish the alcohol was a bit more subdued and didn't burn as much on the finish (not bad, but you will unmistakenly be aware of it's presence), but that certianly won't deter me from enjoying every last drop that my girlfriend doesn't sip when I turn my attention away for a moment. 2,227 characterseclipse54, Feb 11, 2012

The beer pours a MUCH darker than expected color. A very dark brown with a few bubbles. The aroma is loaded with bourbon and dark malts. Not overly sweet in the nose. Bourbon dominates the nose. The flavor is also very bourbon forward but the malts do their best to keep the balance. Alcohol heat is present as is a prune characteristic. Some dark fruits, sugar, vanilla, grain bitterness, and a creme brulee flavor that lasts and lasts. Sweet, sticky, boozy. 
The mouthfeel wasn't anything to write home about. Slick and medium bodied. I would have like a little more creaminess or fullness. A touch more carbonation would have been welcomed. 
Overall a good, not great beer. I was really looking forward to this one and left a little disappointed. I'd drink it again happily. 854 charactersBrew33, Feb 02, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip glass. 
Pours a dark brown color that reminds me of a walnut finish on furniture. Initial pour resulted in bubbles cascading upwards to a two finger head. This subsided quickly to about half a finger, that is an off white. Appears to have fairly low carbonation. Some lacing remains.
Nose is great. Has all the barrel character while maintaining its old ale qualities. Bourbon, oak, and vanilla up front quickly followed rich, sweet malt and some dark fruit qualities.
Before I review its characteristics, I have to say this is probably one of the most well integrated bourbon barrel aged beers I've had. By that I mean that the bourbon qualities integrate with the rest of the beer really well. So many bourbon beers are all bourbon and completely block out other characteristics of the beer. This beer matches the nose really well as well. Right up front is sweetness from both the bourbon and the malt in the beer. Next I get a little bit of toffee and caramel. It finishes with a touch of dark fruits and oddly enough just what the label says, toasted marshmallow. Warming alcohol and bourbon. Delicious.
Fuller body and low carbonation makes for a perfect complement to the rest of the beer. A great sipper.
Overall an excellent beer. In my top 5 for sure. Everything in the beer just complements the other parts equally as good. Not being a huge fan of bourbon beers, this one blew me away. I really hope I can get my hands on some more in the future. 1,498 charactersahq514, Feb 01, 2012

thanks to abanton for the chance to try this gem.
pours a murky mahogany / chestnut tone while yielding virtually no head even with a somewhat aggressive pour - not surprising in the least. obvioulsy no lacing, either.
bold, malt-forward nose is rife with with bourbon, caramel / toffee, brown sugar, dark fruits, and a little vanilla. mouth-watering.
as enticing as the aroma is, i think the flavor is even better. just tones of the aforementioned characters with a few others i didn't get in the nose. some molasses, oak, and a hint of chocolate. chewy, full-bodied mouthfeel with slightly below average carbonation.
overall, enjoying the hell out of this one; so rich and flavorful but doesn't stray into the cloying sweet. great bourbon presence. phenomenal beer. 804 charactersperrymarcus, Jan 31, 2012

ive heard a lot about this guy, time to see what its all about. its going to be tough as ive got adam available, one of my fav brews.
bottle says its been aged for nine montha in the barrel and i believe another nine months have passed since its been bottled. 
12oz into a tulip glass
a- looks damn good so far, thin half inch brown head over a really dark ruby red hue ale. this is exatly how i like my old ales to look, alot bigger head than i was expecting knowing this was barrel aged.
s- noticed the nose on this one right when i opened it, awesome! dark juicy fruits are immediate, lots of sweet toffee and brown sugar. great mix with the barrel, i need to try regular 4d
t- nice, follows the nose closely. dark fruit is fantastic (plum and cherry) and up front followed by vanilla, and bourbon. nearly zero alc heat, this one is delicious. really enjoy that dark cherry flavor that lingers
m- heavy on the palate exactly as old ales should be. carbonation is high for something aged so long, very impressive.
o- now i know what the commotion is about! thank god ive got a second bottle haha. this guy really wins points being cheaper and more avaible than adam from the wood and it blows north coast ba old stock outta the water with value. the high quality is very present in this guy. like adam i think this one will age great for years! 1,418 charactersKevSal, Jan 25, 2012

4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I’ve been really looking forward to this beer for some time, and for some reason after classes today I decided that today was the day. I’ve heard mix reviews anywhere from “I had to pour it out” to “one of the best beers I’ve had”. This is one of the beers I’ve seen the rating for before trying, so I’ll try and not bias my rating. 
First Old Ale rating.
Bottle from Kuhnhenn’s solstices bottling party. 
A & S: Immediately after cracking the cap it came off super boozy. After a few seconds some of the scents I expected came through: toffee and lots of sweetness. Some lesser scents include raisins and bourbon. Dark (dead and dense looking) brown colored beer. Not much head (light tan) colored even when poured vigorously. The head dies very quickly to nothing but a ring and some interesting whisks in the center. The head never really goes away, a creamy looking ring is around at all times. Some specks of lacying cling to the sides.
T & M: The taste is extremely complex and rich. The overwhelming tones of the beer are a battle between sweetness and alcohol. There are a lot of different dark fruits I’m tasting in the one including: raisins, plums, and cherries. Caramel is a huge component of the beer. Other lesser tones I’m tasting include: a bit of smokiness, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar. It’s pretty boozy but, I feel like it pulls it off well, like a good barleywine would. Not as warming as you would think for a beer that is 13.5%. Very, very smooth and creamy probably the smoothest beer I’ve ever had, if not its in the top 5. That smoothness is complemented nicely with a bite of carbonation. On the chewy side for being medium in body.
O: I think this beer is great for the style I just prefer. I wouldn’t want more then one or two at a time, it very, very rich and intense. I think I would need to branch out more on my Old Ale before I could give this one a more honest rating. It really might be one of the best beers, but its just not one I feel I can fully appreciate yet. 2,037 charactersminterro, Jan 20, 2012

Pours a dark, muddy brown with ZERO head. It appears as though there's little to no carbonation in this one. Not sure if that's the norm or not. The nose is a straight up bourbon bomb, mixed with some vanilla and cocoa. The taste also proves to be absolutely laden with bourbon. This is 13.5%, and I feel like I can taste every last tenth of a percent of the alcohol. The taste otherwise mirrors the nose. The mouthfeel on this is pretty hot. Again, very booze forward. There's a mild dark fruit overtone on the finish, but it's tough to distinguish through the pervading alcohol. Overall, I'm glad I got to try this, and although it is tasty and I would certainly not bat an eye at the opportunity to have it again, I don't think it's one I'll seek out going forward. 880 charactersRetail1LO, Jan 20, 2012

*From notes
-- Thanks to ajsdad06 for the swap --
A: Not a bit of head on a hard pour. Caramel brown in hue.
S: Extremely sweet and concentrated late harvest vine fruit. I've never in my life encountered a bouquet like it. The concentration can't be underplayed. The more I get my nose in there, the more of the rich barrel characterisitcs I get. It almost smells like a Mounds bar.
T: Again, this is like drinking straight concentrate. Malt, plums, bourbon, vanilla and toasted coconut meld together to create what is one jaw droppingly unique flavor profile. And it goes on and on and on and on....
M: No complaints here. The barrel has really impacted the brew, as it's extremely smooth and silky, almost cask-like.
O: Like the finest of California's cult cabs, the concentration of Kuhnhenn's BB 4D is absolutely astounding. It may be a bit off-putting for some, as I can see this being an aquired taste. But for the barrel aged veterans, this is a thing of beauty, unquestionably one of a kind and simply delicious. 1,064 charactersRhettroactive, Jan 15, 2012

S - The aroma is a nice plum aroma, not overly strong, along with some sugary sweetness. I'm picking up some oak and bourbon as well but nothing too strong.
T - very nice flavor. i'm picking up alot of chocolate mixed with the dark fruit, vanilla, and some more oak. There is some bourbony sweetness in the middle and the heat only picks up in the finish along with a nice spiciness.
M/D - Milky and creamy mouthfeel, nice slightly prickly carbonation but not overly lively. The heat doesn't hold you back and you I just want to keep drinking more.
I'm thinking maybe a barleywine or an olde ale.
I've definitely not had this one before. I'm horrible at taking a guess so i'll just rip it open to find

4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I figure I should probably get around to reviewing my top 5 beers and I'm starting at number one.
Pours a little muddy with no head. Appearance is the only thing I can ding this beer on. My normal description is that its an ugly beer, but 3/4 of the way through a glass I have to say its not as bad looking as it was on pour. Its dark, but held to the light you're rewarded with cloudy copper and what was at first a bit ugly really shines. Can't give it more than a 4.5 for looks, though. And that may be generous, but to me appearance is the least important characteristic for a beer.
Aroma is caramel, dark dry fruit, bourbon and malt without unwanted butter. Too much butter has been killing a lot of beers for me and this does not offend.
Taste... As long as its not too cold it is a miracle. Caramel, chocolate, malt, spice, oak, vanilla, bourbon - all in mad harmony. I'd have guessed it a happy accident if they didn't deliver on multiple vintages. It is a warm happy place and is my go-to when I just want to go to my true happy. A glass of this and the company of my rabbit and I can put anything behind me.
Mouthfeel is warm, but not hot. Slick and barely carbonated, but it doesn't feel like it needs any more than it has. And I really don't get the burn I expect from something this big. It feels "right" and I can't say better than that.
Overall my number one beer I've ever tasted. In the three years I've been really drinking beer I've tried a LOT of great beers and only one true challenger comes to mind (and it was a draft only miracle via Urbain - capiche?). This is a style I love done right, bourbon-aged, and it hits damn near full marks. It is my miracle beer and I love it more than these words can convey. 1,736 charactersnormyk, Jan 14, 2012

2010 bottle.
Murky brown colour, no lace, barely noticeable white ring along the edge of the glass. Smell is of caramel, brown, sugar, fudge scents, raisin, dark fruit, some alcohol soaked dark bread, toffee, oak, mild vanilla and some whiskey notes. Taste is malty with brown sugar, vanilla and toffee, caramel, oak, light bourbon and fruit flavours, mildly sweet, a touch of warming alcohol, incredibly complex. Light carbonation, full body, full weight, rich overall feel is lightly syrupy and coats the mouth well. Outstanding stuff, incredibly complex and flavourful, will seek more of this out for sure. 661 characterspeensteen, Jan 12, 2012

Poured almost flat, save a couple bubbles atop. An unclear, if not muddy brown body with significant legs. Nose has lots of chocolate fudge, caramel, some bourbon - not prominent, but well integrated. Some dried dark fruits as well. Outstanding flavour, a bit of alcohol/bourbon at the front, with more fudge goodness, dried fruits, sweet malts and general barleywine-like character. Maybe some bourbon soaked dark fruits dipped in fudge would be the easiest way to put this? So much complexity in spite of these descriptors, just great. Thick and full mouthfeel, low carbonation and most certainly something to ponder over. Not a ton of alcohol in the finish. I'd certainly pursue this again, just fantastic. Thanks a ton Pino and Alex. 883 charactersliamt07, Jan 11, 2012
4.22/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- A low head developed, but what did come out was super creamy. Laces full and delightful with good retention. Deep dark body, a viscous appearance at times. What is that, maple syrup and soy sauce coloration? Interesting, interesting. Excites me.
S- WHOOOO diggity dog damn YES! That maple and bourbon barrel character are undeniable. This smells like... like something familiar. Oak and wooden back end, sweet caramels and molasses up front, some dark fruit and volatile chemical heat. Egg nog and custard... almost a... creme brulee note. The timing of the intake of breath allows different phases to be experienced. Initially it was a very sweet aroma.. vanilla and bourbon heat. As it warmed you got more caramel and molasses with the bourbon heat. Less sweet vanilla, more savory earthy sweetness. Its reminding me of a Hair of the Dog bourbon barrel barley wine. Adam? No... I wonder...
T- Nom, nom, nom! First impressions are the barrel characteristics, the bourbon sweetness, the heat of a high alcohol beer. A spicy burn right on the center of your tongue letting you know to be careful! I'm no slutty girl to be slurped down, but savored and gently sucked. 
After this opening slap you detect the vanilla and oak of barrel, it lingers, it delights, but it vanishes and you have caramels, maple syrup, and dry ethanol nature. 
M- Full body, slightly creamy, mildly astringent, definitely hot. Sticky flavors, a residue forming on the cracks and crevices of my lips. Low carbonation benefits it well, I'd say perfect carbonation. 
It tastes not as amazing as it smells. Don't get me wrong, its good bordering great in flavor... but that nose is where its at. 1,673 charactersKhazadum, Jan 11, 2012

A: Dark brown pour with some ruby highlights. No head or lacing, overall pretty "still" looking (3.5)

T: Caramel malt base with multiple layers. The dark fruit provides a bit of spice and melts into chocolate, vanilla and oak. The remnant of hops provide a contrasting bitterness to a mostly sweet beer. The hint of spice is mostly in the finish along with a small amount of boozy heat (4.5)
M: Medium bodied. Virtually no carbonation, very smooth. Lingering sweetness left in the tongue (4)
D: Really liking this beer. Guessing it's up there in ABV but doesn't really drink that way. Would revisit. Only complaint is it starts to become cloying towards the end (4) 933 charactersBrez07, Jan 09, 2012

S: A whole lot of bourbon and caramel. Maybe a touch of vanilla and some cherry, but the bourbon and caramel dominate the entire nose. The smell is intoxicating and inviting.
T: Whoa. No false pretenses from the smell. This is bourbon, caramel, and heavy malts toying with each other in my mouth. The huge malt backbone of the standard 4D holds up incredibly well to the bourbon. The way the flavors blend in this beer is nothing short of wonderful.
M: The bourbon and caramel coat my entire mouth, and the flavor lingers. This thing is thick, heavy, sticky, and warming. I can tell this is a 13.5% abv beer, but it does not deter me at all. It's amazing to me how smooth this goes down.
O: To me, this is exactly what you want from a barleywine or an olde ale. I deduct points for lack of head, but come on, who am I kidding? Beers just do not get much better than this. Very lucky to be able to obtain this gem fairly easily. 
Every time I have this beer, it never disappoints. 1,230 characterstravMI13, Jan 09, 2012

Appearance. Pours a cloudy, lighter brown with almost no head.
Smell. Caramel, brown sugar and bourbon with some wood and chocolate. 
Taste. Sweet brown sugar and molasses with some boozy bourbon and oak.
Mouthfeel. Full body with low carbonation. Warm, but not in an unpleasant way.
Overall. Awesome. Really easy drinking for the abv. 383 charactersRutager, Jan 09, 2012

A - Dark, almost like a burgundy color, slight rim of head that wasnt significant.
S - Wonderful aroma - smells of bourbon, caramel, molasses, earthy hops.
T - Very sweet up-front from the caramel. It finishes a little hot but nothing you wouldnt expect from a 13.5% beer. The flavors melded together fantastically.
M - Medium body with little to no carbonation. It is stronger so it took a good 30-45 minutes to sip through this one which was nice.
O - Absolutely wonderful old ale, the smell and taste were outstanding. I'd love to have a bottle of this to age for a year to get a little of the bourbon to subside. 662 charactersBeRanger, Jan 08, 2012

A: Minimal head over cloudy brown liquid.
S: Chocolate, toffee, bourbon and some yeast. Beautiful.
T: Toffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, yeast and a fair amount of alcohol.
M: Medium to thin viscosity with a low level of carbonation.
O: If it was less boozy it would be superb, however, this is still an excellent beer. 357 charactersDaftCaskBC, Jan 08, 2012

A: Pours a murky brown/red with only a few larger bubbles lingering around the edges of the glass. There is absolutely no lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose in this beer is sweet and boozy. I get a lot of malt, some really nice stone fruits, dates, caramel, and vanilla. It smells like this beer might have seen the inside of a barrel.
T: This beer starts out sweet and malty, with a great fruit character underneath. It’s big on caramel, big on booze, and the vanilla is definitely there as well. The heat from the alcohol is really big on this beer. This is darn delicious.
M: Full bodied beer. It’s sweet and syrupy, coats the palate, and lingers for awhile. The remaining notes are caramel and booze.
O: Color me impressed. this beer is nice. It’s a slow drinker, but it’s good. The sweetness and alcohol are perfectly balanced.
Got this from 2beerornot2beer in the Blind Beer Round 6 BIF.12oz. bottle poured into my Bell's Tulip:
A: Pours a super dark murky brown. There is very little head to this beer, just a thin khaki colored ring that hugs the glass.
S: The smell is super sweet. There is huge malt character, caramel, and toffee notes. I get a bit of oak and vanilla. There is also a roasty/toast scent that shines through. It’s also super boozy. A bit of sea-weed in there as well.
T: The taste is big and sweet up front. I feel like this beer has most defiantly been in a barrel. The booze is strong with this one. It’s a tiny bit funky, with tastes of sea-weed, but it’s not awful.
M: Full bodied beer. The flavors begin to envelop the palate, but the smoothness fades and I’m left with a lot of harsh boozy flavors. I wish this beer was smoother.
O: This beer is decent. The flavors are there, but they don’t mingle all that well from start to finish. 1,861 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jan 07, 2012

A: Pours a ruddy brown with just the faintest amber trace. No real head to speak of, though I wouldn't expect it from a bruiser like this. Just the tiniest bit of lacing. Good, but nothing special.
S: Wow, this is an intense smelling beer, maybe the most intense and complex brew I have ever experienced. Loads of vanilla and coconut, wave after wave of raisins, lots of ripe dark fruit, cherry, caramel, some toffee, oak, and, of course, bourbon. The essence is just a little too sweet for my tastes, almost a funky finish in the bouquet. I love the first 3/4 of the nose on this, but the finish is really weird. Dare I say it, almost made me gag.
T: Raisins, oak, tobacco, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla. Lots of tobacco and leather on the finish. Wow, I am really impressed with it. Super complex and with a nice, bitter, earthy finish. Home run. Great.
M: Moderately carbonated, a pretty significant alcohol burn. Flavors are all very well integrated and balanced, though. Super thick bodied and cloying, everything a beer like this should be. Great work.
O: If you can get past the mildly off-putting end notes of the smell, 4th Dementia reveals itself to be a spectacularly complex and enjoyable beverage. I can see why people rave about this one. This one feels great on the palate, and presents new flavors with each sip. Still let down by the smell, but the taste and balance make up for it. 1,483 characterssiege06nd, Jan 07, 2012

Surprisingly dark brown, nearly no light gets through actually. Not quite as thick as a stout by any means. Layer of light tan bubbles builds. Glad to see these new ones have some carb, helps the mouthfeel as well.
Aroma, Heavy bourbon oak, vanilla, brown sugar, prune, malty goodness.
Taste, Really a lot going on with this one. Malty caramel, brown sugar, rumcake, rainin/fig. Large accents of vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark chocolate.
Big,slick, creamy and warming, but the alcohol is really really well hidden. I can't believe how easily I could put this down for the size. Heat does build though, 13.5 does need to be respected.
Rock solid barrel aged old ale. The cream of a small crop. Up there with Black Biscuit for me as my fav.
Pleased with my choice for New Years Eve for sure, Happy 2012! 848 charactersBung, Jan 01, 2012

A: Very dark brown color, very murky looking. Guess that's the 4th Dementia. A slight wisp of tan head that is gone quickly and the thinnest of lace sits on the glass for a second.
S: Huge oak dominating. Bourbon behind that. Subtle vanilla and chocolate notes. Booze definitely comes through a lot.
T: Sweet chocolate and dark cherries upfront. Bourbon, vanilla, oak, raisins, and figs hit the middle of the tongue. Finishes with butterscotch and alcohol. Pretty complex.
M: Medium to full body. Very creamy. Little to no carbonation. Great aftertaste. Alcohol burn.
O: Very good and very complex. Lot's of booziness but it doesn't distract from the complexity of this awesome beer. 762 charactersdoughanson78, Dec 23, 2011

EDIT: Notes in () are updated, from a 2011 bottle. Scores are also updated to reflect the what I believe to be the intended product.
A: Pours a deep black with NO head. Adam told me to pour vigorous and I did. No head at all. No lacing either. Sorry gotta knock it for this. 2.5 (Poured a beautiful deep brown, with some fantastic crimson hues, some light getting through around the edges. Gorgeous frothy white two finger head, with sticky lacing hanging around. Awesome! 4.5)
N: No knock on the nose. This thing is brimming with great aroma. Sweet lust! Lots of bourbon, chocolate, caramel, a bit of oak. Yummy, yummy, yummy. I could sniff this all day, it's that good! Makes up for the lack of appearance. No hop character, nice malt coming through. The barrel really shows compared to the original version. 4.5 (Lots of the same going on with carbonated bottle. Maybe some more of the dark fruit character that wasn't coming forward as much before. 4.5)
T: Yes. Big bourbon notes, with a lot of caramel, and malt. Really satisfying. Some really nice ripe fruit notes coming through with a touch of vanilla. Little bit of sweetness that gives way to a great sensation of a dried oak presence. Is that oak, or cardboard? There is some really interesting things going on, even if they aren't all positive? Kind of interesting. Some cardboard, definitely. 4 (None of that cardboard or oxidation in this puppy. Really fantastic notes of malt sweetness, vanilla, ripe fruit. The bourbon and caramel are great! 4.5)
M: This beer really lacks from carbonation. Actually, I feel as though it was a bit OVER oxidized from the barrel aging. I'm getting some real cardboard notes, and if it had a little carbonation it might be able to hide those flaws. 3 (This was a different beer. Great mouthfeel, very rewarding. A full mouthfeel, with great sticky sweet notes, long lasting finish, and outrageously delicious after taste! 4.5)
D and O: It was a great beer, none the less. Lots of flaws though. I'm not going to rate this beer as high as I would like to, or lead to believe it should be. I have a few newer bottles coming. From what Adam tells me, there is a real difference between the ones that pour with no head and the ones that don't. I got one that doesn't, so I'm rating it as such. If I get one that pours great, isn't oxidized, has no cardboard notes, I'll revisit this, and update. (Completely different beer. I'm keeping my original notes here, so myself and possibly others can compare. The properly carbonated and not overly oxidized BB4D was a fantastic beer, worth seeking out for sure. 4.5) 2,727 charactersMarcatGSB, Dec 23, 2011

A: Looks like muddy water when poured into my glass. Zero head.
S: Malt Bomb! Resembles Utopias, lots of ethanol mixed with caramel, raison, chocolate, and, well, malt. Oak also comes through. Almost no hop character.
T: Very slight bitterness, alcohol presence right away, and lingers. Again, malt forward with lots of sweetness but not cloying. Lots of dark fruit flavors in the background. The oak character is perfect.
M: Thinner than I would expect, alcohol lingers but is not hot. low bitterness. Very-very low carbonation.
O: If you like the Utopias "style" of beer, then you would enjoy this. Lots of malt, very low hop character and low carbonation. But, very delicious and boozy. I feel good after just one :) 841 charactersbrewtechnik, Dec 21, 2011

Pours a clearish mahogany/ruby with a wispy cream colored head. Bourbon, oak, caramel, plum, fig, and other various dark fruits dominate the nose. Flavor is slightly more spicy the nose suggests; but otherwise a strong malt body with a barrel forward presence well integrated. Light carbonation with a medium thick, smooth body and a hot, dry finish. 370 charactersyourefragile, Dec 19, 2011

4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into my Kuhnhenn snifter. Decided to treat myself tonight, and with Adam FTW still in mind from the weekend, wanted to see what I thought of this one.
A - Pours a cloudy, murky, ugly brown. Only the slightest lacing of white head around the edge of the glass, even with a vigorous pour. When held up to the light, shows a reddish hue around the edges that is quite redeeming for the hue of this one. Looks thick and tasty, albeit an ugly shade of brown.
S - Bourbon vanilla, cherries, dark chocolate dominate the nose. Really potent, which is much appreciated. Smells somewhat hot, which is not at all surprising at 13.5 %, but it is a more integrated alcoholic aroma that is more of an accompanying piece than an unwanted intruder. As it sits and warms a bit, the vanilla and dark fruit begins to really dominate in the nose. Simply awesome.
T - Oh wow, cherries, chocolate, and the backbone of bourbon vanilla that carries this one throughout. Smoother than smooth, with absolutely zero alcohol sting. Also picking up a bit of an oak taste from the barrel and more dark fruit in addition to the cherry. Endlessly complex as each pour seems to open up different flavors that coat the tongue beautifully. As it warms more, some roasted malt profile becomes more prevalent as well. Really a treat of a beer.
M - Perfectly silky and smooth with no burn whatsoever. Coats the mouth beautifully and leaves a very nice film behind. For 13.5 %, the mouthfeel on this one is incredible.
O - Overall, the standard of old ales. I can't wait to get my hands on some more this year! 1,599 charactersMarkIntihar, Dec 06, 2011

A-Dark translucent amber. Low creamy head. Looks very appetizing.
S- Bourbon, caramel and dried dates. Very nice, but not nearly as complex as the beer i am drinking next to it.
T- Had to separate myself from the other beer around me to spend some time tasting and appreciating this. Nice balance of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, caramel and a light oaky heat. Spot on for the style and nicely balanced.
M- Medium body, lower carbonation. Very creamy with a lingering/pleasant warming. Awesome.
O- Cant wait to try this again down the road when a little oxidation sets in and contributes to the overall complexity of this delicious beer. 701 charactersstx00lax, Dec 04, 2011

A - Pours a dark plum like color. Little head forms on the side but nothing substantial.
S - Dark fruit and a lovely bourbon can be detected even when I just open the bottle. The nose doesn't lie once in the glass, dark fruit, bourbon, currants, and an almost sweet sugary smell. I'm just thinking of it as a dark candied beer mixed with bourbon in my head from the smell, and I like it.
T - Wow. I've said before that beers have some flavors that could have come through more, this beer has none of that. It comes at full force. Dark cherry, candied fruit, raisins, slight malt, toffee, and a lovely bourbon taste flowing all through that. This is a very murky earthy taste as well, it's a very interesting. Quite sweet, but I like it. The thing that makes this taste amazing is how well blended all the flavors are, they seem to all come together and just be bold together. And not to mention, many flavors to choose from. Great beer.
M - The bourbon obviously makes the flavors a little heavier, but is in no way hot and at a great balance right now. Carbonation is a little low, and while I wouldn't want much carbonation in this, a touch higher could have been better. But that's the only criticism I can find. For all the bold flavors, this is very drinkable and very enjoyable.
O - For the first really cold day of the season, this beer was perfect. Bold dark flavors, with the warmth of bourbon, but very drinkable. This hits the spot now, and probably could have hit the spot at just about any other time. Incredible beer and easily the best I've had of the style. 1,628 charactersScrumtralecent, Nov 30, 2011

A: Pours a murky reddish brown with very thin off-white head even after a fairly vigorous pour.
S: Tons of dark fruit and barrel aromas. Raisins, brown sugar, oak, vanilla, bourbon and alcohol. Smells amazing.
T: Everything from the aroma and then some. Loads of dark fruit and molasses, toasted malt with brown sugar. The bourbon barrel aging adds delicious vanilla, oak and bourbon flavors. Warming alcohol is quite present reminding you how big this beer is. The dark fruit really stands out and the barrel aging complements it incredibly well.
M: Slightly oily medium-full body with low-moderate carbonation and a sweet finish.
O: Amazingly flavorful and highly drinkable, perfect winter sipping beer warms you from the inside out. Could definitely drink a bottle of this every night through the cold months if it were possible. 909 charactersAzurescens, Nov 30, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A mix of brown dominating initially, then some darker red and orange colors when held up to the light. Aroma was definitely bourbon, but not harsh, inviting and nice. 
Smooth taste, not super boozy, toffee and caramel all over this bad boy. Brown sugar probably makes this a little easier to drink, but never entering into 'sugary sweet' territory. A substantial experience with vanilla as well really integrates beautifully with the bourbon. Chewy, but not thick. Slight oak existence. Even smaller amount of smoke. Possibly a syrup presence.
Its pretty rare that I get amped up about an old ale, but I've been having some pretty decent ones lately, and this is definitely the best of the bunch. Thanks for opening my eyes. 726 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Nov 07, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - This beer pours a really dark brown color, and it has some ruby highlights as well. A quite vigorous pour yielded nothing more than a small ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lace was left behind. 
S - The nose on this is just amazing. There are huge aromas of bourbon, caramel, a slew of dark fruits, dark malt, toffee, booze, dark sugar, and vanilla. The nose just blows me away, I can't wait to taste.
T - The taste is awesome on this. It is really complex and you taste different flavors with each sip, and they all meld really well together. There are some really nice flavors of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark malt, and dark fruits. Also, there is some chocolate, toffee, oak, and some booze. The alcohol flavor is hidden amazingly well for it being 13.5%.
M - This has a medium body and lower carbonation. It goes down super smooth, and it has a little bit of a chewy quality to it. This is probably one of the smoothest beers I have ever come across. There is a touch of alcohol warmth here, but much less than I expected. It's just so creamy and smooth. 
O - This has amazing drinkability. It goes down super easy, and the flavor is amazing. Overall, this is just an awesome beer. It is very complex and delicate. All the flavors go together really well, and make for an awesome beer drinking experience. The best Old Ale I've had so far. A must try. 1,379 charactersJizackFH, Nov 07, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this bottle.
The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a tan head. The aroma is full of brown sugar, bourbon and raisins. I also get some nice alcohol notes. All of the components in the aroma are very, very nice. 
The flavor is just as complex and just as nice. I get a lot of brown sugar and molasses notes, as well as a lot of bourbon, oak, maple and vanilla. The alcohol is present, but it is not as strong as expected from a 13.5 percent ABV beer.
Medium moutfeel and medium carbonation. 530 charactersMora2000, Oct 31, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -3.1%look: 2 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 512 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to Beerisheaven for this bottle.
Appearance - Dark, murky, sedimenty burgundy body. No head. No bubbles. Just pond water. As it warms, it clears a significant amount, which redeems it slightly.
Smell - Oh man. It's one hell of a complex smell. When it's cold, it smells like a wet, mildewy sock. As it warms, the bourbon, caramel, and leather smells come out. The wet sock persists, but more pleasant flavors emerge.
Taste - As complex as the smell, but nothing offensive. Sweet caramel at first, followed by a blend of earthy hops and bourbon. The bourbon is sustained throughout and finishes with a leathery, earthy finish. Amazingly complex. Boozy, but not any more than I'd expect from 13.5%
Mouthfeel - Nearly completely flat. Heavy and boozy, but on par for 13.5%. It's warming and very sluggish to drink. Half a bottle has taken 30 minutes so far.
Overall - An amazingly complex beer with flaws that can't be ignored. I wish I could give it a 6 for flavor, though. The best tasting old ale I have ever had. 1,062 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 30, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Really looking forward to drinking/reviewing this beer. From all that I’ve heard and the opinion of those that I trust their palate, I think this will be right up my alley. Special thanks to Jrallen34 for providing this beer. Bottle - 2010
Even with a big pour there is absolutely NO head on this beer. For a moment some bubble escape to the surface causing a slight disturbance, but nothing like a head. The beer is a dull brown color with some tiny bubbles slowly escaping. Not a chance in the world of any lace being left behind.
Aroma immediately reminds me of Older Viscosity. Brown sugar, warming alcohol, bourbon and vanilla.
The vanilla and brown sugar flavors are fantastic. Caramel is everywhere in this beer and it’s almost as if you are chewing on it. I sometimes speak of beers that are too “hot” I am not a fan of that straight heat of alcohol in my beer. Good news, this does NOT have that. Don’t get me wrong, the elevated abv is as clear as the nose on anyone’s face, but it’s smooth and warming vs. harsh and hot. What’s interesting is just as the sweetness could go over the top, there is a base of bitterness that provides nice balance. This really seems to be complex and a combination of some hop bitterness and some alcohol flavors. A moment where you taste some dates. Perhaps bourbon soaked dates! Wonderful.
Body is super bold and almost syrup like. Very smooth and coats your tongue. The carbonation provides just a tingle within the flavor.
Just a wonderful beer. Right up my alley and worth all the talk about it. One to sip while you enjoy the press conference for the new Red Sox General Manager. I’ll play in this glass for quite some time. 1,695 charactersReagan1984, Oct 25, 2011

12oz bottle at fridge temp poured into a snifter split with fellow BA's. had this side by side with the 2010 4D (non barrel aged).
they both poured out with pretty much no head. poured out a slightly murky dark brown, this was a darker brown than the regular version. 
lots of warming bourbon up front with some grapey, winey like fruits, dark fruits. a bit of concentrate apple juice. just a hint meaty.
grape like fruits, lots of hot warming bourbon, a slight briney character. this had a bit more of a smoked meat kind of flavor than the regular one. 
smooth, and not a super huge mouthfeel as expected. still the alcohol is a lot more obvious in the BA version. leaves a bit of stickiness on the palate.
a very interesting beer, not really like anything ive had before. i would definatly seek this out again, would love a few of these for the cellar. having the 2 side by side, i definatly enjoyed the non barrell aged version better. this one seemed to muddle a lot of the characteristics that really shined in the regular one with hot bourbon. 1,068 charactersdogfishandi, Oct 17, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 bottle that was part of a Bootlegger's Tasting since this is illegal in Mississippi: 
A: Pours a very dark brown that is slightly hazy.  A small khaki-colored head rises and falls quickly leaving behind only a trace of lacing on the glass. The body is amazingly still with very little evidence of carbonation at all. 
S: Holy bourbon barrel Kuhnhenn!  Lots of bourbon, dry oak, vanilla, caramel, and maple all fight valiantly for the spotlight.  Booze is slightly evident, but is subtle and masked almost completely by the better qualities of the beer. 
T: Follows the smell quite well.  Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and oak are dominant.  I imagine licking the inside of a bourbon barrel would taste much like a thin sip of this beer.  A malty sweetness sneaks in toward the end, along with dark fruits (mainly fig and plum).  The booze is a little evident at the finish, but it's hidden quite well, considering its level. 
M: Full-bodied with a really nice velvety creaminess.  The carbonation level is pretty low, complementing the rest of the beer, and its viscosity.  Smooth but coating on the palate.  
D: Definitely a sipper, but this is one great sipper.  It is nicely complex yet well balanced.  I absolutely love this beer.  I had it on tap at Jackie O's back in February, and the bottled version lives up to the memory I had of it.   1,370 charactersMississipping, Oct 08, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to my main man Mark for this one. Very generous trader.
Pours a dark dark red. Seriously looks like a brandy. Beautiful. 
Smells strong. Lots of caramel, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and alcohol. Taste is a lot of the same. Loads of caramel toffee and bourbon. Vanilla is present but not huge. Bourbon is very noticeable....LOVE IT! Very dry finish. Lots of tingles on my tongue, and also can feel the alcohol in my nose, like taking a shot of bourbon. Wonderful beer. This should be treated like a fine bourbon, sipped and savored. Quite masterful really. Glad Mark hooked me up with this one, and I might have to venture after some more. 649 characters1Adam12, Oct 08, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to pittsburghkid66 for hooking me up with a couple of these. Have been looking forward to this one for quite some time! 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter...
A - Pours a very dark amber body. No real visible carbonation and the very small head that forms quickly disappears. Looks more like liquor than it does beer. 
S - Very deep and very rich. Buttery toffee, rich caramel, roasted caramel malt, and lots of bourbon integreated very nicely. Sherry soaked dark fruits, molasses, vanilla come through and really makes the nose something I don't want to break away from.
T - Flavor is just divine. Follows the richness and complexity of the nose with the bourbon integrating itself well into the base beer. Toffee, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and bourbon seem to be the up front flavors with the other flavors noted in the nose subtly coming through. Really awesome!
M - Full, thick beer. A little hot on the tongue, but nothing offensive at all. Light carbonation makes this one really nice. Slightly sticky and chewy.
O - AWESOME beer. One that met the hype that surrounded it. So glad I got to try it. Looking forward to trying this with some age on it! 1,175 charactersKAP1356, Oct 05, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -9.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My thanks go out to Knifestyles for this one. 2010 Vintage.
Kuhnhenn 4d has a body that gives the impression of being brown, but when held up to the light it is really a combination of dark orange and red hues. No head at all, but the liquid has some legs like wine might.
The aroma is very good. Lots of toffee and toasted malt with a load of sweet caramel behind it. Dark fruits and bourbon make an appearance also. A little bit of heat seems to be lurking in the background.
This is certainly a malt bomb. Insane amount of sweet caramel and toffee. Lightly toasted malts come through also, with browned sugar contributing as well. Bourbon comes next, and is fairly assertive. Lots of dark fruit give this beer a brandy characteristic as well. The finish has a blast of booze and warmth.
The body is full and thick. Despite not having a head, the beer isn't flat at all, and feels quite good.
Overall this one is definitely a sipper, due to the heat and the 13.5% ABV. Despite the heat, this is still a pretty good beer. I look forward to getting my hands on some more Kuhnhenn stuff in the future. 1,105 charactersHojaminbag, Oct 01, 2011

Many times bourbon barrels add a great richness to the beer, but I prefer the original. Still a great beer, and I'd reach for this before many others. But I'll take the original over the bba each time. 322 charactersbirderbeerer, Sep 24, 2011

A - deep, dark brown with a small bit of white head. Fairly watery body, no legs whatsoever. 
S - BOURBON! Vanilla, oak, figs and dark fruits. Oh yeah, and ALCOHOL! Smells amazing. 
T - same as nose but with less burn than expected. HUGE bourbon profile with a ton of vanilla. A nice warming heat with each sip. 
M - caramel-like with a bit of stickiness to it. Pretty nice on this stormy eve.

Poured a dark cola color with a minimal, rapidly dissipating head. Very boozy on the nose, with aromas of bourbon, roasted malt and wood. On the palate, this one is full bodied, with flavors of bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt and lots of booze. Excellent. 336 charactersemmasdad, Sep 12, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -0.4%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Not so gorgeous at all. Very little head if any. Carbonation is there, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of it. 
S- The nose in one word-- Intense. The aroma sort of came out of nowhere. Initially, it's clear that there's booziness and character to be found here. After picking it apart, there's definite notes of bourbon. Oak and vanilla are quite prominent as well, and there's a peat like aroma to it as well. Hints of raisin and brown sugar take part as well. The aroma is superb, but a bit sharp and fierce for me. 
T- While the aroma is quite edgy, the taste is quite smooth. The follow through is monumental as well. I find that the flavor is very much like regular 4D, but the bourbon adds a certain kick to it. It doesn't interfere with the other flavors one bit, but it steals the show pretty well. 
M- Medium full. Light carbonation keeps it feeling nice, but not rough. Fairly dry and sticky in the finish. 
O- Much like the original Fourth Dementia with the addition of bourbon. Drinkability is compromised, but character is added. I can handle boozy drinks, but this seemed to slightly boozy for me. Perhaps some age could help this one out. The bourbon seems to play a more significant role in this than in most bourbon aged beers. You could almost swear that the ABV is bumped up from the 13.5% too. 
All in all, I'm not disappointed. For what it's worth, the Bourbon Barrel aged version isn't all that much more expensive than the regular, and a splurge that I'd suggest everyone do at least once. 
I can't say that it was volumes better, but being better than the regular 4D is an accomplishment in itself. 1,634 charactersBBP, Sep 10, 2011
3.74/5  rDev -16.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.512oz bottle into a snifter - 2010 Vintage
A: Pours a muddy brown with absolutely no head and barely even a tinge of carbonation on the sides. I even poured this pretty aggresively and it made noise when I popped the cap so I'm not sure what's goin on here.
S: The nose is big wafts of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and dark fruits.
T: The taste is a tangy version of the nose with big flavors of caramel, toffee, vanilla, dark red fruits, and earthy red wine. 
M: The feel is on the thicker side but it's damn near flat. I'm a bit dissapointed here.
O: The aromas and flavors are great but no carbonation makes this tough to drink. It's almost like drinking wine at this point. 678 charactersGregSVT, Sep 05, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5100th Review!!! Had to pick something good...
Split 12oz bottle w/ Barfwin. Poured into snifter.
Aroma: Deep, roasted caramel malt, toffee, sherry, molasses, vanilla, ... there's enough here to contemplate for a while. VERY complex.
Appearance: Dark amber body, but very clear. 1/2 finger head disappears quickly. Winds up looking more like a glass of dark rum than a beer.
Flavor: Carmelized brown sugar, deep fruitiness, raisins, and dates. A beer with the complexity of a fine cognac. Alcohol is obvious, but smooth as silk.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, medium-low carbonation, smooth mouthfeel, which is warming in the mouth and throat.
Overall: Wow--what a phenomenal beer. Believe the hype on this one! Definitely the best old ale I've had. Of course not a session beer, but I couldn't think of anything better to drink as a winter warmer. (or any time of year for that matter!) 885 charactersmdvatab, Sep 05, 2011

4.78/5  rDev +6.2%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I picked up a good number of these at the 2010 Winter Solstice, $7.50 each. Since then I've had the chance to pick up a few more at the brewery, same price. It seems expensive for 12oz bottles (as do all the Kuhnhenn beers), but in this case the high cost is justified.
It pours a dark murky brown, clearer at the edges, minimal head. Huge aroma, sweet and malty, lots of bourbon, a good dose of vanilla too. Sort of hot tasting, but in a very good way. The bourbon is very well integrated into this beer, sweet but not to a fault, burning but not overly so, massively tasty. 
Thickish liquid for a barrel aged beer, low on carbonation but that works well in this case. Among my favorites from Kuhnhenn, this is excellent stuff. 730 charactersTurdFurgison, Sep 04, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to maddog for this unexpected treat; it landed on my doorstep, unsolicited, out of the blue, one glorious day, along with a few other treats. Needless to say, I was flabbergasted by your thoughtfulness, Mike. The brew pours a deep fudgy-brown color, and is topped with a small cap of wispy tan froth. It looks sludgy and ominous. The nose offers a good deal of Bourbon, but is not perceived as 'hot' in any way. It is more an amalgam of wood, vanilla, buttery notes, and sweet booze, which is not potent with any one aspect, but is domineering in totality. The flavor follows the nose with additional complement of toffee-caramel notes; this beer is tremendously well-apportioned in the sense that everything works so well together. There is a sort of molasses thread that runs through everything, and the brew also seems to have a fair amount of Dark/Navy Rum nuance to it. The feel is ridiculously creamy, with a very soft petillance. Overall, this beer is insane; I want more. 990 charactersktrillionaire, Sep 03, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a sniffer
Appearance: Dark red-mahogany with nothing resembling a head even with a hard pour, all bubbles fade quickly.
Aroma: Caramel, vanilla, oak, whiskey, raisins, dark fruit, a touch of tobacco and a decent amount of alcohol. 
Taste: I was expecting this to be a booze bomb, but it was not. The alcohol in the aroma was virtually non existent in the taste. The taste consist of chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel, dark fruit. It's sweet but not cloyingly sweet.
Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy with no carbonation, a sipper for sure. 
Overall: This is an exceptional beer and very glad that I got to try it. I don't like old ales, but this however, is an exception. 691 charactersjamescain, Sep 01, 2011

Aromas of light bourbon, vanilla, cherries, oak. Tastes like toasted marshmellow as it states on the bottle. Lovely bourbon adds fusel notes and just a hint of alcohol. Sweet maltiness has the dark rainbow of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Nice notes of chocolate and dark fruits. Finish is earthy and mellow and very well done. Feel is light syrup with a perfect amount of carbonation. A superb beer and reading that it is on tap at the Gingerman in NYC has me making plans for tomorrow evening. 601 charactersscootny, Aug 26, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Another brew I got to try at the Ginger Man. Didn't state that it was the BB version on the draft list, but as I was ordering the server mentioned that it was in fast the BB version and I couldn't believe my ears! Having split a single bottle of this beer before with 2 friends and remembering how amazing it was, I was ready to have an awesome experience.
Served in a 12oz snifter, the deep brown off this beer lured me in instantly. The only thing I wish was different would be that the head had more character and stuck around for a little longer.
I could smell this beer forever. Vanilla, caramel, a little orange zest and a spicy note to finish. I'm just going to stop here, this is all you need to know about this beer. 727 characterspdeepak, Aug 22, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft @ GingerMan NYC. Pours a deep reddish brown with little-to-no head leaving subtle lacing. 
Aromas begin with a great deal of bourbon notes. It smells somewhat sweet but not overwhelmingly so. As it warms you can detect the base beer with some booze soaked dark fruits (raisins, prunes and dark burnt caramels).
The tastes begin with a ton of initial bourbon soaked dark fruits (dates, raisin and figs). As it warms there is some chocolate chip cookie. Alcohol is somewhat apparent, but is not at all overbearing or hot. Pretty heavy on the bourbon but the base beer is still apparent enough to keep your interest. 
The mouthfeel is medium-to-thick and coats the palate nicely. Quiet sticky and full bodied with a low amount of carbonation. On the syrupier side, which I usually do not like, but it really works with this beer. There is a slight warming from the alcohol which is common for these bourbon barrel beers.
Overall, I really enjoyed this beer; equally as much as the original. I appreciate how you can still distinguish that this was an Old Ale originally and that the dark fruits aren't completely overwhelmed by the bourbon barrel flavors. This is defintitely a sipper in the best sense of the term. There is so much flavor in each sip; it is best enjoyed in small doses over an extended period of time. Glad I have a bottle at home in my cellar. Highly recommended for fans of the original 4D as well as Bourbon Barrel aged beers. 1,454 charactersclaspada, Aug 17, 2011

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, wood, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, caramel, sweet alcohol, and dark chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. This brew was very Barleywine-ish in flavor and aroma if I am honest. This is definitely a good thing though as all of the flavors were mixed together quite well. The dark chocolate aspect I got on this one really took it to a new level though adding just a hint of sweet bitterness. A really well done brew that I would drink over and over again. 857 charactersthagr81us, Aug 16, 2011

4.69/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle shared by a generous soul – much obliged!
Pours a hazy deep copper-brown color with a cream-colored head that leaves solid lacing.
Smells of robust caramel malts with large amounts of vanilla and toffee. Also present are slight amounts of dark and medium fruits and slighter amounts of grainy toasted malts.
Tastes similar to how it smells, though not quite as phenomenal. Smooth caramel malts up front quickly give way to loads of vanilla, toffee, and butterscotch flavors. Midway through faint earthy hops and dark fruit flavors make an appearance, before fading out into a smooth ending. Mouthfeel is very good, with grainy carbonation.
Overall this truly is a world-class beer. Everything works together very well and this is a beer that’s well worth a shot. 777 charactersglid02, Aug 11, 2011

I recommend serving this beer at cellar temperature. 
Served in New Belgium globe glass. 
A: Pours clear brown with deep amber highlights. A skim of foam rests atop the beer. No lacing and effervescence, but that is appropriate for style. 
S: Lots of aromas in this beer: bourbon, caramel, dark, dried fruits, some chocolate, and alcohol. Additional and more subtle smells include butter, vanilla, coconut and hard toffee candy. 
T: Big flavors of malty sweetness, bourbon, figs or raisins and caramel. Alcohol splashes on palate. Medium-light bitterness. Secondary characteristics of smell are manifested in taste, with vanilla taking lead and chocolate getting buried. 
M: Heavy body and slight carbonation. Mouthfeel is oily and mouthcoating. Alcohol runs rampant in this category, singeing from tongue to stomach and seemingly burning a hole through the epiglottis. 
O: The smells and tastes of Barrel-Aged 4D become bigger as the beer warms up and measure up to the high abv. Even so, the alcohol is always present, which is expected for style.  I wonder if a little more time can tame this beer. I do not find the barrel to be overpowering and think it works quite well with base beer. A great sipper and excellent example of a barrel-aged Old Ale.  1,299 charactersWadsey, Aug 10, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5BA 4th Dementia looks very similar to its base beer (deep fig flesh colored) but noticeably cloudier with no head.
The aroma is an onslaught of vanilla, coconut, and strong strong dark fruit. Very very delicious, although the alcohol is rather in-your-face. Not on the level of bourbon, but more on the level of stronger wine.
The barrel aged version delivers everything good about the regular version in twice the amount, and with some bonus notes of its own: exceptionally silky, amazingly balanced, very sweet, yet quite bitter, and still so clean in its finish, this one can stand up against J.W. Lees! The flavors are primarily dark fruit, chocolate, leather and tobacco. While there was no head, the carbonation is just right; the body is no thinner or heavier than it should be. The roast is much more mellow than the regular version, but still present, and very welcome.
 Overall, a great beer! Thanks Ron! 917 characterstewaris, Aug 09, 2011

S: Odd and unenjoyable. Smells of rye, pumpernickel bread, caramel, bourbon, and a shit load of alcohol. eck. 
T: Taste is far better than the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla. Some sweet caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. 
M: Medium in weight, but a bit syrupy and viscous. Lower carbonation is to be expected. 
O: I have mixed feelings about this beer. Personally, I found the aroma to be horrible, but the taste was far better. Can't say I would seek it out again, but glad to have tried it. 549 charactersFlorida9, Aug 08, 2011

A - Deep, dark mahogany with slight reddish tints and a very thin khaki-colored head that dissipates quickly.
S - The nose on this is absolutely insane! Huge aromas of caramel, toffee, vanilla, coffee, and bourbon. Incredibly complex and decadent!
T - Oh my goodness. Yeah, this is insane, huge flavors of dark malt, caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate (and even more, I can't even describe everything I'm tasting!). The Bourbon is so perfectly integrated with the base beer. Decadent is again the best word to use here, I keep thinking of some sort of Bourbon-soaked dark chocolate cake or something.
M - Smooth, silky, and slightly sticky. Full mouth-feel, lowish carbonation. Just a perfect, late-night slow sipper.
O - I'm in love, what can I say? I need to track down more of this asap! 840 charactersjsanford, Jul 29, 2011

Bottle to Flute

Thanks to Wethorseblanket for this one to try.
App- Deep, deep mahagony and reds. It had a small head and some cling that left very quickly.
Smell- So many things on the nose on this one. Was big and brash with vanilla, oak, bourbon, sweet, malty.
Taste- This was very very very good. The flavors meld to go above what an Old Ale normally tastes like to me. More vanilla, more bourbon, more chocolate, small dark fruits.
Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonated. Such a great feel on the mouth. Nice creaminess with vanilla and bourbon.
Drink- Thank you Greg! This was a big want and to have some was amazing. Great beer, will def. try to get my own bottle of this. 713 charactersFosterJM, Jul 26, 2011

Big thanks to AleWatcher for sharing this bottle!
2010 Vintage. I've been sitting on a bottle of the non-barrel-aged version of this, waiting to do a side-by-side; and then this is brought over in a surprise strike. Guess I can't be too upset, right? It pours a mostly clear sienna-ruby topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises caramel malts (a big whiff of a generic malt bag, baby), light bourbon, very light oak, vanilla, butterscotch, and very light roasted malts. The taste holds notes of light cocoa, sweet toffee, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, buttercream, mandarin orange syrup, and caramel. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an almost chewy feel. Overall, a very good brew, one that, on the surface, at least, seems to have taken to the barrel aging rather well. Get some. 881 charactersTMoney2591, Jul 25, 2011

This is one off the list and its holding up to most expectations. This poured an intense dark void with no head at all except for a slight bit of a bubble ring at the last of the pour, there is zero light penetration. It smells like chocolate and dark malts from the time you crack the bottle, the chocolate is the easiest to pick out. the taste of chocolate and something mixed in there, its hard to pick it out, i bet this beer gets insane after a year or two. let some of the mixed flavors separate a little. The mouthfeel let me down a little even though you can tell from the taste that hops arent a big figure in this, its not light and its not lively. there is no attack on your tongue from the carbonation. overall, this beer to quote my friend is fucking awesome, i could drink this once a week on friday and be totally happy, my friend actually thought this was a bba imp stout when he had some at DLD. i say get some if you can cause this rocks....Hard 994 characterskaips1, Jul 23, 2011

a - popped the bottle and filled my CCB snifter. brownish plum with a very thin head. has a really nice reddish shine to it...to the light, really pretty and slightly transparent.
s - YUM. brown sugar and malts. caramel, wood, bourbon. i've always felt that the best beer for bourbon barrel aging is the old ale and this one is top of the list.
t - much like the nose, again brown sugar, caramel, toffee...strong booze. great marriage of flavors. some dark fruit, finishes a bit bitter. gets better with time.
m - very smooth, very boozy...finishes a bit bready and bitter.
o - overall, this is a SOLID beer. one of the best barrel aged brews around. i wish it was easier to come by, but feel very fortunate to have a few in the cellar.

2010 vintage. 12oz bottle to Kuhnhenn tulip glass. Thanks to scoot1969 for this.
A: Pours a very dark, cloudy amber, with not more than a tiny ring of sand colored foam which is not with us for long. No lacing. Standard stuff so far. 
S: Smell has wonderful layers of complexity: sweet caramel, marshmallow, bourbon, dried fruit like raisin and cherry, dry oaky red wine, cinnamon and pepper and cardamom (spot on imitation of the barrel characteristics of a Pinot), and some vanilla and grape in the secondary. 
T: Taste is caramel, dark chocolate, dried fruit, bourbon, oaky red wine, and finishes medium-dry. Alcohol is slightly noticeable on the finish but much mellower than regular 4D. Nice improvement. If there's any fault here, it's a little flabby and high on the presence of oak, and not quite as well integrated as I would hope.
M: Full bodied, mouthcoating and chewy, carbonation is light but definitely there. Carbonation is considerably lighter than regular 4D.
O: Overall, this is an exquisite, massive beer. More like a slightly carbonated sherry than a beer. Everything you want in an after dinner drink, too: lots of complexity, evolves over the course of the glass, and a touch of sweetness. A nice sipper. 1,246 characterspmarlowe, Jul 16, 2011

Nose is the best part of this beer, bourbon, sweet dark fruits & toffee.
Taste follows the nose, with some nice toffee butteryness (it that a word?). Bourbon is very pronounced here, makes it a nice sipping beer. It's not exactly the beer for a warm Florida summer night.
Mouthfeel is creamy, with little carbonation, but that's not really needed here.
A very good old ale, couldn't drink more than one of these at a time, it's a nice one to sip on. 582 charactersFLBeerGuy, Jul 16, 2011

And this time I decided to take some notes….
Pours a deep mahogany with very little head to speak of whatsoever, but the aroma on this beer is outstanding. Dark fruits (cherries, baked apples, raisins), burnt caramel, and bourbon meld together for a wonderful bouquet. The taste tends to follow the nose, with a very smooth mouthfeel and slight alcohol burn on the way down. Not much in the way of carbonation, but this doesn't really impact the beer in any negative way. This is just one really standout old ale and I'm glad I've had a chance to try it on a few occasions. 809 charactersNCBeerFan, Jul 14, 2011

12oz. brown bottle poured into a snifter.
A: Pours a deep murky brown. A small head forms with vigorous swirling but dies quickly. No lacing but some alcoholic legs.
S: Loads of bourbon and alcohol. Plenty of dank, damp wood. Rich malts with deep caramel and toffee aromas.
T/M: Plenty of bourbon with warmth and sting. Wood comes out a bit further. The malts can hold their own and rival the bourbon for supremacy, which still works well. Body is medium to medium full with very light carbonation. More carb would beef up the body a bit but I think it's still appropriate.
D: Great beer that's best warm. Can't go wrong with this one. 690 characterspwoods, Jul 07, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 2.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5In the most recent trade with STEG. Thanks for the hookup on this one man. Best box yet, and this one was delicious. 
From a bottle into a snifter. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, medium-thin, light tan head with lousy retention. Really noisy and fizzes down to a slight ring very quickly. Color is a clear seal brown with no carbonation evident. Slight ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass. Not off putting, but definitely not attractive. Forget this though; the rest is killer. 
SMELL: A big, bold nose of bourbon barrel. Lots of oak, vanilla, piles of bourbon, and some nice caramel and toffee aromas. Notes of maple syrup and brown sugar as well. Smells like barrel aged sweet goodness. 
TASTE: Much like it smells, but moves from a tamer initial flavor to a burst after the swallow. Caramel and toffee flavors up front, with lots of maple syrup and lots of brown sugar. After the swallow, an avalanche of oak, vanilla sweetness, caramel, and lots of bourbon goodness. Quite boozy and barrel heavy after the swallow, but it’s very, very tasty. Bold and lingering aftertaste is full of caramel sweetness and bourbon barrel, but is perhaps a little too hot for top marks.
PALATE: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth with a blast of heat after the swallow and finishes slightly sticky. A big alcohol burn at the end is a little rough, but the rest of the palate is strong enough to support such a big brew. 
OVERALL: What a tasty treat! This one is very barrel forward, especially after the swallow, and although I usually like my BA beers a little more nuanced, this one just seems to work. The base beer and relatively full bodied palate are big enough to support the big barrel presence, making it a delicious brew as opposed to a harsh booze bomb. It is, admittedly, still a little hot, but with a little time, this will be outstanding. In fact, according to the masses, it already is outstanding. I can’t argue with that. Thanks again for this gem STEG. Cheers! 2,030 charactersJeffo, Jul 06, 2011

A: Murky brown color. Dense and opaque. The pour dropped a soapy head that faded rather quickly, and left no lace.
A: Huge bourbon notes up front, followed by a caramely, vanilla sweetness. More sweet caramel malts, and a muted earthy hop profile.
T: From the huge notes of bourbon in the nose, I thought this one might taste more like a bourbon than a beer. I could not have been more wrong. The sweetness of the barrel play extremely well with the base beer. The bourbon accentuates the brew and does not overpower it. One of the smoothest BA brews I've had in a while.
M: Lower on the carbonation which makes for a slick and oily mouthfeel.
O: Really impressed with this one. Would really like to know what barrel was used. All in all, smooth, creamy, and not much hint of ABV from such a strong brew. Skal. 896 charactersGtreid, Jul 03, 2011
4.14/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42010 version - thanks to kickinthechalice for bringing this back from MI for me
Pours out a thick, viscous, deep, somewhat murky, yet vaguely clear brown with red highlights. 
Smells heavenly - a brilliant blend of maple syrup, caramel, toffee, figs, burnt sugar and bourbon. Just a hint of booziness at the end. 
Tastes a lot like it smells - however the bourbon is much more prevalent than the other flavors - you get hints of the caramel, figgy, malty deliciousness present in the nose, but they're largely overpowered by the bourbon. Hopefully a little time will cause this one to mellow out. 
Mouthfeel is great - viscous without being sticky. Despite the lack of foam, there's enough carbonation. 
I can't wait to see what a little time does for this. I can easily imagine it improving with a bit of age. 815 charactersreadbaron, Jun 30, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Alex for hooking me up with this on a great trade. Deep dark brown appearance with just a hint of red. An aggressive pour yielded a half finger head that quickly faded, but with decent lacing. Powerful, complex nose loaded with oak, toffee, burnt sugar, figs, and vanilla along with hints of caramel and maple. The taste is just as bold and complex as the nose. The oak and bourbon hit you right off the bat. Sweet caramel, vanilla and raisins with hints of maple syrup, chocolate and brown sugar with just a subtle touch of coconut. All that sweetness is nicely balanced with a nice, albeit subdued, hop bitterness that really emerges as it warms. The alcohol is well hidden until the finish, where there's a nice slow, warming burn. Slightly syrupy, slightly chewy, but very smooth mouthfeel, especially considering the 13.5 ABV. This is definitely a sipper, but I'm really wanting to crack another. The regular Fourth Dementia was great, but this is world class. Another great Michigan beer! 1,004 charactersbeerdrifter, Jun 25, 2011
3.69/5  rDev -18%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Review from notes.
A: The beer pours a cola brown and is somewhat clear (surprisingly). Only a small ring of bubbles formed, and that quickly faded to nearly nothing. 
S: Right up front, strong scents of bourbon, and more bourbon! Some vanilla, oak, and caramel in there too. 
T: The bourbon strength and presences also mirrors the nose on the palate in taste. Sweet brown sugars comes through, some mild toffee, strong caramel nuance, and some mild vanilla on the finish. 
M: Oily, low carbonation, slightly sticky from the sugars. 
O: Good, but hot in terms of alcohol. This beer was shared with me at the Clusterfork # 4 tasting event at the Bruery. Unfortunately, I have not had the regular version for a better base comparison. However, knowing straight bourbons, it was pretty heavily infused into the beer. If you love bourbon, then that’s a plus, if you want more balance, as I do, then this beer might have gotten too much residual bourbon from the wood in the barrel. It's still good, but is very much a sipper of a beer, and even 12 oz split a 3 ways, was plenty @ 13.50% 1,089 charactersRetsinis, Jun 24, 2011

Poured dark brown with ruby/maroon hues in the light. Not much head here, but other things can make up for the lack of giving head.
I smell wonders in the making here. I feel like I've just interrupted an intimate sex scene, where I've walked into a room where Ms. Caramel is making vanilla and fig babies with Sir Bourbon. I feel naughty for sniffing around like a lost hound pup, but damn I can't help but waft this beauty into my olfactory bulbs and bathe in its erotic presence. Man, it's like those two are just going at it hard, causing the oaken four poster to creak and crack. Their neighbor, Madame Toffee, is listening through the walls, enjoying the sounds of the intertwining lovers. 
As I leave the room, not wanting to further disturb them, I notice empty bottles of port wine and a leather whip laying on the nightstand. That will come in handy later I suppose. 
The whole experience is extremely smooth, velvety, and creamy. Everything is in place, even for the low carbonation. I have hardly a qualm for this beer. 1,085 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 23, 2011

A - Pours a swamp water ruddy brown with lighter brown edging. ZERO head, maybe a couple lingering bubbles. I never understand how people rate appearance a '5' when there is no head...anyways, still looks good.
S - Strong roast character (chocolate, minor espresso) with a huge wallop of sweet caramel and toffee. Vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar, figs, and booze. Excellent layering in the nose.
T - Huge sweetness balanced by slight fruitiness and bread. The sweetness is mainly from a huge butterscotch presence. Mid palate, believe it or not, I get S'mores. Honestly, chocolate and graham cracker with some marshmallow. Interesting. The vanilla, spices and dark fruits (mainly figs and dates) are in the finish. 
M - Pretty boozy, but that was expected. I think a year or three in the cellar will bring that down.
O - An incredibly deep and layered beer. Each flavour plays well with each other. A touch hot right now but still a stellar brew. Loved it. 1,032 charactersOakedCanuck, Jun 22, 2011

Appearance: very dark, almost opaque with a little bit of brownish copper. Absolutely no head, poured into a goblet style glass. 
Smell: Just fantastic. There's definitely a lot of the oak and bourbon on the nose. As it warms, the smell gets even sweeter, with more brown sugar and some serious alcohol heat. I could just smell this all day...
Taste: Very similar to the smell. Beautiful bourbon and dark fruits. As it warmed, more malty sweetness and alcohol came up front. 
Mouthfeel: It's pretty thick and syrupy - but not quite as thick as an imperial stout. It helps give the beer a nice long finish. 
Overall: I'm very happy I went back and picked up the bourbon Barrel version of this. The barrel aging kicks this beer into a whole other level. Seek this one out. I'm glad I bought 2! 903 charactersJ0E, Jun 22, 2011

Appearance – Pours a dark, murky brown into a tulip. Not much head if any, and just a tiny bit of lacing.
Smell – Just a fantastic nose on this. Port and sherry, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, figs and prunes, oak, slight leather and bourbon. Smells relatively sweet overall, but wow, I just keep enjoying this beers aroma.
Taste – The taste is completely similar to the nose, and exactly what I expected. Wonderfully integrated brown sugar and dark molasses up front which mixes with the earthy leather and bourbon flavors. Midway the dark fruits come through, more prune and fig than anything else I can put a finger on. An almost port like quality with bittersweet cocoa ends the sip. 
Mouthfeel – Quite smooth and creamy, thicker, lower carbonation.
Overall – Certainly an awesome beer and one I am glad I have two more of. For such a high abv, the beer went down like it was nothing. The nose and flavors were absolutely fantastic, and worked exquisitely well together. Though relatively sweet/rich, I enjoyed it immensely. Can’t wait to share one with my brother-in-law come Christmas. 1,290 charactersSpdKilz, Jun 20, 2011

Upon popping the cap to this sexy bottle, the aroma hits me, BAM!!! But we'll get to that in a moment. Appearance is a bit underwhelming. No real head forms, just some large soapy bubbles, but I did begin with a rather small pour. Deep reddish brown hue, with decent clarity.
Here we go, aroma is huge and full of so many things. Caramel, toffee, dark fruits, some kind of nuts, bourbon (of course), chocolate? It's just so good and fragrant! I could really sniff this all night.
Taste follows suit, and brings everything with some real OOMPH! I sorta just want to get this review over with so I can continue to enjoy this beer.
This is one of the most delicious beers I've ever had, and frighteningly easy drinking for 13.5%. 781 charactersjefferz5000, Jun 20, 2011
3.76/5  rDev -16.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5It hopefully goes without saying, but just in case, DO NOT DRINK THIS BEER COLD. I found optimal serving temperature to be between 61 and 66 degrees.
Deep dark brown with a swirl of an almost-head and zero lace.
Very dense, expressive aromas of black cherry on the vine (along with the soil), burnt fruit, brandy, and mainly super sweet malt. Rather phenolic and estery for a BA beer. No bourbon really, more of a big smokey and brandy/rum alcohol presence. It burns my nose and I like it.
It's hard to define anything but caramel/toffee/blah blah blah because it's so incredibly sweet and rich. Golden raisins come to mind. If it weren't just more than slightly tannic feeling, the -bal aging might be lost on me. The vanilla/oak/bourbon profile I look for is lost in the shuffle. But like many -bal aged beers, it is rather hot, and in this case almost like a semi-sweet caramel liqueur. Thankfully the heat dissipates quickly, allowing a very flavorful and pleasant finish.
This beer is very dense, with minimal but definitely sufficient carbonation. The alcohol "burn" is more akin to the feeling of smoke on the rear of the palate. It sounds off-putting, but it is much better than the alternative.
We are spoiled. There are so many beers available now that defy convention by apparently tasting and feeling "smooth" despite surpassing 12% abv. Taking that in context makes it difficult to severely judge BB4D. Despite it's faults, I do very much appreciate this beer. This is an elaborate, tortuous monster that may become something amazing with time.
And for the record, I think the barrel aging process really hurt this beer and was downright unnecessary. I gave the non-BA version an A+. 1,702 characters7ways, Jun 18, 2011
3.57/5  rDev -20.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Bottle: Poured a dark amber color ale with a tiny foamy head with limited retention and no lacing. Aroma of bourbon is quite intense with lots of brown sugar notes and light dry fruits. Taste is dominated by bourbon notes with light alcohol ester and some brown sugar with dry raisins notes. Body is quite full with medium to low carbonation and some alcohol was apparent. Interesting and very intense and complex but still a notch below the regular version. 458 charactersPhyl21ca, Jun 17, 2011
4.19/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle (2010) courtesy of Thorpe429. Cheers! Poured into a Ranger Creek snifter.
Sits in the glass with a faded copper penny color--mahogany at the edges. The head is wispy and ephemeral, quickly retreating to a thin ring of tiny tan bubbles. The aroma is delightful with intricate notes of bourbon-drenched caramel, raisin, fig pudding, and vanilla bean. It's sweet, but not overpowering or cloying as rum and dark fruit yeast esters add a nice balance to the maltiness.
The flavor shows off every inch of the +13% ABV; the regular 4D (and even 5th Dementia) do better at hiding this. Chocolate-covered cherries and dark rum notes swirl and warm the cheeks and stomach while a dose of English toffee and golden raisin linger after the booziness fades. Body is chewy and thick, but delicately carbonated. The alcohol is strong, and seems to get stronger as the beer warms. Set aside a lengthy sipping time for this beer, or better yet, share it with a friend. A full bottle, while delicious, is almost too much to handle in one sitting. Give it a few years in the cellar if you're the adventurous type. 1,109 characterswagenvolks, Jun 16, 2011

Appearance- Pours like a thick sweet tea. Very dark, dark crimson. No head or lacing at all. 3.5/5
Smell- Very sweet maple aroma. Some apple and alcohol as well. 4/5
Taste- This is where it gets interesting. Sweet apple and maple flavors. Some molasses and a little spice in there also. Good amount of alcohol, but you wouldn't know this was 13% abv. Lots of sweetness left on your lips. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel- Port- like thickness. Very good mouthfeel. 4.5/5
Overall- Very good sipping beer. I wish I had some more to cellar for a special occasion. Although I have a feeling that this is one that I would like better fresh. Thanks Jason. 4.5/5 709 charactersMADhombrewer, Jun 13, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Pours thick, dark brown. Not much head, and dissipates quickly.
S - Dark fruits, fig and raisins are the meat of it. Strong bourbon and vanilla notes round it out. Could whiff this all day long.
T - Awesome. A lot going on here. Thick, malty maple syrup notes up front. Strong bourbon flavors on the swallow, but not enough to put it out of balance. This is a perfect example of what bourbon aging can do to a beer without being overpowering.
M - Not giant stout thick, but pretty heavy for the style and syrupy.
O - This is a superbly done beer and the best of the style I have sampled. Definitely in my top 10 brews. 626 charactersPenguinBeerFan, Jun 13, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Kgristoff for the opportunity to drink this exceptional beer. This beer pours a murky brownish red with little to no head what so ever. The Smell is a divine blend of Bourbon, vanilla, Caramel, toffee. The taste is the same, but smooth and perfect. For me this is easily a top 5 beer of all time. If I could only drink this more often the world would be a much better place, Honestly there are only 1 or 2 beers tops that I currently Desire , and desire is the operative word here, more than this one. Wow, I love it. 527 charactersdavesway10, Jun 12, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look:
Dark, muddy brownish red with almost no head.
Smell:
Bold caramel aromas blended with mixed spices, bourbon, and dark fruits. This is an incredible smelling beer.
Taste:
Does not disappoint. Intense flavors of caramel, bourbon, raisins, cherries, plum, and molasses stand out. Undertones of cinnamon, rich wood, vanilla, cider and biscuit. Hints of coffee and dark chocolate round out the complex list of flavors.
Feel:
Heavy yet not overwhelming. Compliments it's sipping style well.
This is a big, bold beer. With such complex flavors there's a high chance of something going wrong. But this is an artfully crafted brew that left nothing unaccounted for. 666 charactersElGrecoVerde, Jun 12, 2011

4.28/5  rDev -4.9%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Kuhnhenn is a brewery most haven't heard of.
Most also haven't smelled my apartment this morning.
Eight hours after opening Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia (2011) I'm still reeling from the aroma.  A hard pour produced little to no head on top of the swampy dark brown ruby hued body. No fizzy bubbles to carry the smell up to the nose. No worries - BB4D has no use for bubbles. Vanilla, toffee, coffee, sugarcane, flan, roasted oats, baked yams, rum raisin, cherries, the smoke drifting from a small village stocked with Top Chef contestants. That's the smell of this beer. Oh yeah, and bourbon.
The taste doesn't stack up (how could it?) and is mostly malty sweetness, alcohol, and bourbon. Not much bitterness to speak of. It's not bad. In fact, it's extremely good. And The thick body solidifies this as a dessert Old Ale if there ever was one. But it's not matching the smell.
This is a drinkable beer if it's the only one you're having that evening. It's the best smelling velvet you will ever open from a bottle. An "A" rating does not do the smell justice.
But maybe... just maybe... it's a bit too much? 
I only ask because I've been blowing bourbon barrel boogers all day. 1,190 charactersafksports, Jun 08, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Found on the shel mixed among standard 4D. Poured into my newly bought Founder's snifter.
A: Deep toffee brown. Slight head that quickly dissapates.
S: Lot's going on here. Toffee, raisins, among other things I cannot pinpoint. The alcoho is there as well.
T: Just like the smell, this beer has many layers. I typically do not like old ales. This one is exceptional. 
M: Much thicker than your run of the mill craft brew, but not quite syrupy. Exactly how I would want it.
O: One of my favorites beers that is not a Stout. Well done. I am glad I live so close to Warren and can find this on the shelf at beer stores from time to time. 639 characterscamil1mj, Jun 07, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512oz/8.99$ at Decicco's Ardsley
Serving temp: Slightly Chilled
Glassware : Obnoxiusly Sized Ridel Bordeaux
Pours a deep brown hue, hues of auburn and coagulated blood. Fine bubbled light sand head with little retention goes missing soon after the glass gets to the table.
Smells of raisin, port, sherry, fig, burnt sugar, sweet malt, light vanilla and milk chocolate notes. A smell combo that sometimes makes me shy away from old ales but there's something reassuring in the nose that let's me know I'm in for something special.
The taste, albeit similar to the aroma, removes the only things I dislike about the aroma which is tough to pin down what, maybe the fig, has been removed and all the things I like about the nose have been amplified and complemented by the barrel treatment. Vanilla caramel, light bourbon, light plum and subtle wood tanins makes this truly wonderful to experience.
Mouthfeel is to style but the alcohol heat isn't until the end and is delightfully warming. Carbonation is spot on and removes the usual trudgig through the super high abv beers. It's a nice 75 out and even being used to low 60s all the time it's not a sickly syrupy difficulty to get through.
Overall this has changed my views on old ales and has me wanting to try the '88 Thomas Hardy's and the Bourbon Barrel Old stock and give old ales another shot Barrel treated or not. 1,377 charactersSTEG, Jun 07, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 2 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 512oz bottle courtesy of erikkoppin (thank you!), into a snifter. 
A - Pours a murky, cloudy auburn-brown. Not much of anything as far as head, retention, or lacing. I wasn't expecting much considering the abv, but this is looking flat.
S - Caramel, toffee, vanilla, and some roast. Definitely smells like it's on the sweet side, and I have to admit that I'm loving the aroma. 
T - Wow, this is awesome. More vanilla, burnt sugar, toasted coconut, and hints of nuttiness. Like a combination of creme brulee topped with marshmellow and peanut brittle. This is great, great stuff. Not much alcohol evident, although I'm starting to get warm. 
M - Thick and creamy, with light carbonation. I was concerned about the carbonation after the pour didn't show much, but it turned out pretty nice. More on the sweet side than dry, with a lingering finish.
O - I've heard good things about this beer, and I have to say that it definitely lives up to the hype. It works great as a dessert beer given the sweetness. It's somewhere between HOTD Matt and Cherry Adam, and to be honest it's better than both of them. Really glad that I traded for some of this. Also very glad that it comes in packs of smaller bottles, and that I still have three more. 1,241 charactersdjmichaelk, Jun 05, 2011
4.81/5  rDev +6.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to BeerWorld for the bottle.
A - Pours a dark reddish brown, with a small head. Pretty unassuming.
S - Wow the nose on this beer is amazing. Big time toffee, oak, vanilla, bourbon, leather, sweet candy. The smell on this one is one of the best malty beers I've had.
T - The taste follows through, this beer is top notch. It is sweet, but smooth. Big bourbon, rich malty flavor, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, some booze, and maybe a little tobacco and leather. The sweetness is up front, but is so darn tasty and finishes smooth that this one is up with the best.
M - Low carbonation, a little syrupy... not bad, but nothing really to speak of.
O - Having had this twice now, this has become one of my personal favorites. The nose and taste on this beer are stunning, and I would be a happy man to have a case of this in my cellar.... unfortunately I'll have to live with the 3 bottles I have left. 935 characterskhumbard, Jun 05, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured in to a snifter.
Essentially black, but once held to the light it's actually a very dark mahogany. Super thin head dissipates to only a tiny ring around the glass. No lacing.
Wow this smells awesome. Lots of caramel, bourbon, oak, maple, molasses, and vanilla. A deep enough inhalation after swirling the glass actually burns my nose from the alcohol.
Very strong molasses and maple. One of the strongest bourbon flavors I've tasted in a beer. Lots of caramel, toasted malt, and woody oak as well. The alcohol is well hidden for 13.5%, but it's certainly there; although it doesn't burn either. This is damn good.
I love the mouth feel. It's full bodied and syrupy. Little carbonation.
This is an amazing brew and totally worth seeking out. Anyone that likes bourbon barrel aged beers would LOVE this 812 charactersAdrianized, Jun 04, 2011

4.94/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a thick syrupy caramel into a tulip glass with very little head. 
Smell - wow what a great smelling brew. vanilla, Bourbon, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted malt and alcohol.
Taste - follows the nose really well. Tons of sweetness with the vanilla, bourbon, and holiday spices. The alcohol is present but nowhere near the 13% this bottle claims. Amazing brew well worth the wait. 
Mouthfeel - super smooth and very easy to drink. The carbonation is very tame and almost not present. As it warms the alcohol stands out a little more but still remains very smooth. 
Overall - the only beer better than this is KBS. I love them both equally. 641 charactersbadboyrsl84, Jun 02, 2011

Pouted into tulip glass.
Appearance: brown beer with red highlights. Ablsolutely no no head even after an aggressive pour. 
Smell: Beer smell just like it tastes. Caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, toffee, and bourbon.
Taste: Another nice, malty beer with the flavor of sweet caramel and vanilla. Hints of toffee and candied sugar. Some dark fruits are also present in the background of the beer. Alcohol is more present in this version, than non-BA version. Still no major burn from alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: The beer remains creamy and smooth. Full bodied and low carbonation. This beer is a bit more sticky than non-barrel aged version.
Overall: I prefer the barrell aged version of 4D to the original version; both awesome beers. This is my second beer by this brewery. It is fantastic! Thanks Kirk! 920 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 30, 2011
3.88/5  rDev -13.8%look: 1.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to capra12 for picking this one up for me. Most recent vintage. Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a Darkness snifter. 
A: Standard pour yields no head. Beer is a muddy brown/clay. No lacing and minimal legs. A really sad looking beer. 
S: Nose is caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, some dark fruit, and booze that tickles the nose. Aromatic and deep though a bit one dimensional with such a strong alcohol presence. 
T: Opens caramel, brown sugar, sweet plum, anise, molasses, and booze. Hugely sweet throughout. Some more fruitiness makes itself present towards the middle with layers of chocolate and vanilla coming in towards the end. Finish is boozy with some nice burnt brown sugar and more molasses in the aftertaste. Nice complexity and a lot of different layers. Very Enjoyable. 
M: Full bodied with low carbonation. Oily and viscous in the mouth. Very robust and heavy going down. Booziness is noticeable. Finish is messy with a lingering aftertaste. Very over the top. 
O: A real meal in a bottle, Kuhnhenn BA 4D is everything you'd expect it to be. Heavy, boozy, and incredibly rich, and complex. Its a solid beer but nowhere near as good as the ratings indicate in my opinion. Still worth trying though. 1,221 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 28, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #100!
Pours a deep reddish brown with almost no head. 
Smell consists of bourbon vanilla notes. It smells somewhat sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Also apparent are notes of toffee, oak and dried dark fruits including raisins.
Tastes of vanilla, chocolate raisins and figs. I also get a bit of chocolate chip cookie that is fantastic. Alcohol is somewhat apparent, but is not at all overbearing. A bit of breadiness. Wonderfully complex assortment of flavors that seem to meld together nicely.
Mouthfeel is medium thick and coats the palate nicely. There is a slight warming from the alcohol.
Overall, this is a sipper in the best sense of the term. There is so much flavor in each sip, it is best enjoyed a small amount at a time. This is one of the better examples of barrel aging really improving a beer, as I thought the regular 4th D was good, but nowhere near this enjoyable. 894 characterswarnerry, May 26, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -3.1%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish snifter. It poured dark brown in color with a thin tan ring clinging to the edges of the glass. It looked somewhat thin and still overall, I'll cut it some slack on the stillness with the barrel aging and high alcohol content though. 
The aroma shows a lot of the bourbon barrel aging character to it. I get some big woody and vanilla notes along with a good blast of bourbon alcohol. I get some great depth to it with dark, bitter-sweet chocolate, leather and a little smoke. The bourbon is a little hot maybe, but overall the flavors are excellent. Things really come together nicely and give it some great dept hand complexity. I love the way the barrel and beer flavors integrate so well and both seem to equally shine. After reading the back of the bottle I really do get the toasted marshmallow, but didn't pick it out myself initially.
The taste starts out with some of the sweeter, malty flavors to it with some caramel and brown sugar notes coming through. Midway, I start to get the vanilla and oak mixing with some dark chocolate, roasty flavors. In the finish the bourbon really starts to come out and lingers with the bitter sweet chocolate. A little hot in the finish, but that is really the only minor criticism I can nitpick at. Again everything really comes together nicely in it. 
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low. A little slick or creaminess in the mouthfeel would have really gone a long way for me. The carbonation was very nice for the style though. 
Overall it was an excellent beer and I'd definitely put it up there as one of the best bourbon barrel beers I've had. I found myself comparing it a lot to BCS on the bourbon barrel flavor aspect, which is a huge compliment given how much I love that beer. If a little hotness fades with some aging I could easily see this beer pushing the score into my very top tier. Everything came together in it perfectly and even though the barrel character was very pronounced, the beer still was able to shine. A few minor nit-picky criticisms on the look and mouthfeel, but overall a fantastic beer. 2,141 charactersbillab914, May 26, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +7.3%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - A dark, rich, coppery brown. Awesome color, but no head to speak of.
S - mmm... sweet bourbony vanilla caramel toffee delicious. No hint of alcohol to speak of. One of the very best-smelling beers I've ever had. 
T - mmm... buttery vanilla caramel bourbon toffee sweet amazing. The flavor caresses my tongue and lingers like a lover's embrace. A touch of alcohol on the finish, like a teasing pinch as she departs.
M - Smooth, decadent, and rich. No carbonation. I'm looking for criticisms, and it might be just a bit thinner than ideal. Still really really good.
Overall, this is an amazing beer. Super awesomely amazing. The cats' pajamas. The wasps' nipples.
It's good. 681 charactersabraxel, May 24, 2011

A: Mahogany, good clarity, flat as a pancake. Forget legs, this has waves! 5/5
S: Big wood soaked in peppery bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of pie spice make this a keeper. 4.5/5
T: The bourbon is strong with this one. The oaky barrel notes are bold and spicy. Milky Way candy bars, cherry cordials, and some vanilla keep this flavor profile decadent and tilted toward the super sweet. 4.5/5
M: Thick, viscous, and a real dessert beer. That alcohol really is quite tongue numbing. 4.5/5
O: This is such a rich beer. If I'm looking for a fault it's that there is some rustic character to add a counter-point to the sweetness. That's a reach though. This is phenomenal. 4.5/5 914 charactershopsbreath, May 23, 2011

A - Pours a caramel color with a few bubbles, my expectations instantly drop.
S - Molasses, bourbon, vanilla, oak.
T - Like a tootsie roll in a shot of bourbon. Chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and oak. It's decadent and hard to see how it could get better.
M/D - The lack of carbonation is perfect. I thought it would be hard to finish a bottle, but the second it warmed up I couldn't stop sipping it. A great barrel aged old ale, probably the best out there consider the price and availably of it. 560 charactersxpimptastikx, May 23, 2011

Pours a thick and cloudy brown, topped briefly by a light skim, then a bare cap, and barely a ring. A swirl leaves oily sheen on my snifter.
Alcohol greets my nose, carrying dark caramel, wonderful barrel notes of oak, bourbon, and vanilla, a touch of tannic and herbal, a few even lighter aromas I can't identify but which give a marvelous complexity.
Good God Amighty!! I am so glad the world is not ending as I drink this, I have three more of these in the cellar! Forget the usual clinical deconstruction of attributes normal reviewing style uses. All the aromas come together as flavors to make one of the most staggeringly delicious beers this fine beer lover ever has tasted, or likely will again. Words are inadequate here, let me add only that, as a homebrewer, I hope someday to approach the skill level required to make a beer this supremely delicious!
Highly viscous, yet somehow creamy and easy drinking, low carb. that adds just enough zing to propel the flavors into the pleasure centers of the brain, and a finish that destroys reason and defies reality. 
Overall this is one of the best beers I have ever tried, and second only to Alpine Great in the high Alcohol barrel aged type of styles I especially enjoy. 1,316 characterscavedave, May 22, 2011

4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4-2010 vintage
 Poured vigorously into my glass and got almost no head to speak of. A deep, dark burgundy almost brown color. Boozy nose. Vanilla bean, bourbon and charred wood at first. Aromas of raisins, fruitcake and butterscotch. Makes me think of pecan pie, chocolate cake batter or browned butter. Warm mayple syrup and brown sugar come to mind as well. 
 Sweet upfront in the palate, with little to no carbonation. Some stickyness on the lips, not too boozy. I taste rye bread, charred wood almost a peaty smokeyness. Lots of butterscotch, browned butter and toffee, caramel notes. Reminds me of amaretto and hazelnut liquor or coffee creamers. The bourbon and vanilla is well balanced. It does become flat rather quickly though making it a little thin in the mouth. There's a dessert-like quality to the brew. 
Walnut or banana bread, with almonds coated in brown sugar and toasted. 
 Warming, mayple syrup, and burnt toffee feel in the finish. 955 charactersCashMoneyVagrant, May 22, 2011
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Absolutley flat, little to no carbonation or head or lacing. A shimmering kind of burgundy to maroon, dark chocolate looking tone.
N - Rich boozy almost vinous notes, vanilla bean, overwhelmingly toasty and bready w/ dark roasted malt, faint suggestion of fresh pineapple, some medicinal/astringent-like.
T/M - Over the top vanilla bean and toffee-like flavors dominate this beer up front, and then the finish leaves you with a nice drying, fig like aftertaste. When you fist sip and get a big sugary rush up front, you start to think "Holy Shit, here we go!" but then the finish levels out with oaky tannin crispness. I was very surprised by the balancing act this beer pulls off. More notes of dark chocolate, maple syrup, bacon grease, a nice savory presence of white pepper to clove-like, and a scotch kind of dryness about it.
D - A total sipper, the alcohol is masked much better than the regualr 4D, this beer was made to be aged in oak. It's a great combination. 977 charactersbiga7346, May 21, 2011

A: Deep brown, murky, very little head, carbonation is there but ever so slight.
S: The nose one this beer is very intense, port, oak, vanilla, and nutmeg. There are some notes of cream sherry that become apparent after letting the drink warm.
T: Bourbon, vanilla, and cream start this drink, a heavy malt presence comes midway, and the finish on this beer is very clean for such a big beer.
M,O: There beer really comes into its self when it warms up to near room temperature. When I first opened this beer it was far too cold and it did the beer no justice, let it warm and this beer comes into its self. 633 charactersfastpass17, May 19, 2011

T: Taste is bourbon primarily but has a deliciously sweet caramel/vanilla flavor with hints of oakiness in the background. The base beer's raisininess comes through a bit as well. There's a small amount of heat in the finish. 
M: It's medium-bodied and a bit sticky without a ton of carbonation, but it actually suits the beer pretty well. 
O: This is a damn good beer that will only get better with age, which might help take some of the heat off of it. It belongs up there with the upper echelon of bourbon barrel barleywines (even though it calls itself an Old Ale). 797 charactersstarrdogg, May 16, 2011

Word of mouth traveled that if you ask....it will be poured! The Kuhnhenn stand was way off from the other Michigan breweries...like the a bad kid put in a corner. The stand itself looked a little goofy. I got to admit I passed it twice and didn't think of trying anything. Then I got word of the 4th Dimentia....
This beer was the BEST beer at the beerfest! The taste has so much going on its hard to separate them. Second best to the taste of this beer was the 5 minutes I spent smelling my empty glass. 
Now Kuhnhenn's Brewering Co. is on my map. May even be worth the drive. 655 characterschadhops, May 16, 2011

Pours a murky dark amber with some red highlights. After an aggressive pour, a few bubbles form and then dissipate. A little lacing on the glass. I smell lots of raisins, oak, vanilla, booze, bourbon, leather and figs. The taste reminds me of an English Barleywine and follows the smell exactly with the addition of marshmallow and coconut. Very minimal carbonation. The body of this beer is medium and kind of syrupy. An excellent beer to sip on after a meal. With some age, it will get even better. Definitely one of the best old ales/barleywines I have ever had.
Edit---i was wrong. I had a 2010 bottle that I aged and the beer really went downhill. Seems as though its best to drink this fresh 710 charactersDubber55, May 15, 2011

A: Really syrupy look with thick crimson tinged muddy brown being the main hue of the body of the beer. No head or lacing the speak of, though I wasn't expecting any in this style. Nice. 
S: Huge excellent complex bourbon barrel hits first and under that you get an amazing aroma of dark fruits, vanilla bean, cinnamon, alcohol heat/sweetness, and malt I can only describe as "cellar molasses/olde ale" malt. Excellent.
T: The smell is characterized in the taste with additions of brown sugar, barley cereal, ginger, oak bourbon, and definitely maple syrup. A great taste, with a little age this is going to be an easy five with the alcohol heat tamed a little.
M: As mentioned above, the alcohol heat detracts slightly but also gives the drinker the impression of drinking bourbon or port, which ain't bad at all. Very smooth thick feel thats great. 
O: An excellent barrel aged barleywine/old ale, probably my favorite to date. I will be looking to trade for this. 1,063 charactersDreadnaught33, May 13, 2011

This is my second time having this beer. First time it was late in a tasting and my penmanship was poor so sadly no notes. This time though with sobriety intact a proper review.
As most my reviews I pour the liquid into my trusty Darkness Snifter. A real muddy brown. No head whatsoever, and you guessed it, no lacing. There is a tiny white ring that circumferences the glass. A nice little contrast to the muddy brown. In the smell aspect I pick up lots of chocolate malt and bourbon. Like a kiss from bakers chocolate for my nose. It's intoxicating. Wow. There is a deep bourbon and chocolate love affair going on here. Just the slightest touch of sweet dark fruit, a little raisin I would say. Nice and sweet though. Not a lot of carbonation here. It is exactly what this beer calls for though. I think more would take away from the steamy love scene in my mouth. I can feel the boozy bite but damn it feels so good. 
Very impressed. In fact I really dig it. Worthy of every praise. 1,051 charactersTheDudeRules, May 13, 2011

Cap pops with a satisfying hiss; there was a little sticky on the neck, but I never could figure out where it came from, & thankfully it wasn't this bottle. All but the final 1/4 ounce goes into the sturdy, unbranded goblet, a liquid flow of flaky rust. The smell stirs me; classic old ale with brown sugar, toffee, & singular malts mixed with vanilla & bourbon of the most nose-pleasing varietal. Oooooh. This is going to be good, isn't it?
I'll confess; I wasn't wild about regular 4D, & it might be that I had an off bottle. This I like. A testing sip turns into three quick mouthfuls. The bourbon is hot & strong in this one, spreading warmth throughout my upper chest cavity; this might be good for curing a cold. Vanilla covers the tongue & weaves itself into a theme of sweet-on-sweet. Toffee & caramel bathe in a drawn tub of alcohol warmth. Slices of dark fruit, corn syrup, & leather may or may not be imagined. 
This is like sipping fine Elko, MN maple syrup. Virtually no carbonation, still & flat. But man, is it good, This is one of those Kuhnhenn beers that makes it worth getting through their catalog; excellent beer, only a breeze below the nose-in-the-air echelon of elite barrel-aged beers. Maybe. Somebody ought to send me another so I can make sure I didn't miss anything. 1,472 charactersmaximum12, May 10, 2011

Complex aroma, woody barrel, bourbon and brandy, booze is prominant, some nice leathery quality and hints of vanilla and chocolate. A big mouthful of bourbon, smokey notes, leather and ash; oak is there too. Chocolate, vanilla and booze too. 
Sticky and thick, oily, just perfect. A little hot but that is excusable at such a high abv. Beers like this grow my like for this style more and more. A really great sipper, nothing could be better about this beer. 572 characterspmlondrigan, May 10, 2011

Appearance: Dark brown almost plum color. Little to no head at all. Damn, this sucker looks good. 
Smell: Raisins covered in caramel with a side bourbon served on an oak bed. Exceptional smell. Ready to dive in.
Taste: The taste is beyond smooth. 13.5% you say?! Wow, that's very well hidden. The bourbon is more and more noticeable as I continue to drink, but its a welcomed addition. The complexity is outstanding. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth as gravy. Again, half way through the bourbon starts to reveal itself a bit more, but it makes the mouthfeel even more smooth. 
Overall: Yum sandwich. This goes down as the best old ale I 've ever had and easily one of the top 10 beers I've ever tasted. The smoothness is jaw dropping and the taste is outstanding. The more I had of the bottle, the more I enjoyed and truly savored this treat. 934 charactersBCGabbo, May 09, 2011

Thanks to him for a much appreciated sample of this gem! The beer poured out as a murky dark brown color with a little tan head on it. The smell was fantastic on this beer, rich and roasted aromas with sweet vanilla bourbon spewing from it. The taste is wonderfully blended with the complexity of the old ale with the elements of the barrel aged bourbon. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, nearly perfect.

Thanks to Sweemzander for breaking out this awesome old ale!
A - Dark, dark brown in color, it almost looks opaque despite being clear. Even a tall pour can't coax a head from this brew. So skim on the surface, just tiny bubbles are left residing along the glass' edge.
S - Warm alcohol envelops the strong malty nose rich with sweet caramel and toast. Dense bready notes and dark fruit esters hide behind the smooth but boozy bourbon and oak smell. Heavy and foreboding but mysteriously inviting.
T - Bold and complex, heavy malt supports the boozy alcohol and wood flavor. Notes of molasses, brown sugar, dark fruit esters, and dirt in the background.
M - Smooth and full-bodied, 4D is incredibly warm finishing with a retro-nasal heat finish. So tasty and smooth!
O - One awesome brew with solid flavor but little heat (for the percent anyway). Definitely best split a few ways but very good none-the-less. 999 charactersBeerFMAndy, May 07, 2011

Was really happy to see this was made again and even happier to have a chance to have it on tap. Never thought this would live up to the first batch from a few years ago, I am glad I was wrong. The appearance on draft wasn't much to write home about, brownish in color with almost no head on my pour. The aroma is where this beer starts to pick up some steam. Caramel, oak, vanilla with a hint of bourbony booze. Flavor continues to much the same with a huge hit of vanilla and caramel with a touch of fruitiness as it warms. The alcohol is definitely present but I did not find it overwhelming. Given the opportunity this will age beautifully. 687 charactersPuddintane, May 06, 2011

This beer looks great in the glass except for the lack of head. The beer is a dark caramel color with hints of red and gold around the edges. A small film of a head quickly dies out, leaving very little remnants save for a soapy bubble here and there.
The smell is quite frankly one of the best old ale noses, or barrel aged noses anywhere. Huge notes of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, oak and bourbon leap out of the glass. There are so many layers of goodness. A bit of toffee, dark cherry and a touch of booze finish the well-rounded nose. This is so expressive and intricate. Very, very good so far.
The taste is also stellar, but there's just a touch too much noticeable booze. I wonder if that will mellow out when the beer ages. For now, we get a really tasty base of caramel and toffee with huge notes from the barrel. Some flavors of dark fruit, baked bread and brown sugar lurk in the background. There are luscious hints of vanilla, coconut shavings, bourbon and just a touch of woody tannin. The beer is satisfying and flavorful. It could just use a bit less booze. At 13.5%, I'm not expecting any miracles here, but I would like to see the boozy note smooth out. Close to the best Old Ale I've ever had.
The mouthfeel is a touch on the syrupy side, with a medium to heavy body and low carbonation. That's just fine, but there is a slight flaw in that the finish is just a touch too dry - I'd like some lingering sweetness and instead this seems a bit drying. Overall, with a few small mis-steps noted, this is a legendary brew and one I would be happy to enjoy again and again. I'll be sure to make the trip up to Kuhnhenn for the next release!! 1,747 charactersjampics2, May 05, 2011

S: There are moderate aromas of bourbon, caramel, dark fruits, sweetness and oak in the nose.
T: The taste is very similar to the smell in that it has complex flavors. The bourbon flavors are a bit stronger compared to the aroma but they do not dominate the taste and are well incorporated with the other flavors. However, notes of bourbon do stand out in the finish.
M: It feels full-bodied and smooth on the palate with a light amount of carbonation. Notes of warming from the alcohol are present in the finish.
O: Considering its strength, this beer is exceptionally easy to drink because the alcohol is completely masked from the taste.

A: Pours a dark ruby red (a darker shade than regular 4D), a little bit of tan foam appears and quickly dissipates.
S: Less of a cotton candy smell that I thought the regular had, this has caramel and toffee sweetness, brown sugar, hints of bourbon, vanilla and oak. This is still very sweet smelling, but a bit more booze in the nose.
T: caramel and toffee dominate, with brown sugar and raisins also prevalent. Nice bourbon and oak characteristics come through. Still very sweet, but the bourbon adds another dimension to the beer. Very complex.
M/D: Thick, like pancake syrup, medium carbonation. Chewy, the alcohol is more noticeable on this one, but it does not detract from how great this thing is. 760 characterscpmichael, May 02, 2011

4.83/5  rDev +7.3%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter. 2010 on the label. I had this on-tap a little while ago and it blew my mind, but I didn't review it since I have pretty well buzzed with a wrecked palate. Here's my chance to spread the good word.
3.0 A: Pours a cloudy dark brown, nearly black color. A fairly aggressive pour gave a maximum head of about 1/4 a finger, which quickly receded. I'm sure the ABV didn't help with the head formation, but I've seen other Kuhnhenn brews form very nice heads despite super high ABVs.
5.0 S: Simply amazing. This is the perfect beer for a bourbon treatment and the bourbon treatment is done perfectly. The bourbon is what hits you first, so I guess I'll talk about that first. Intense, but tranquil bourbon - leather, peppery, raisin, oak and vanilla. There's also a moderate to not quite heavy booziness that complements the other aromas. The beer underneath is similarly wonderful. Dark fruits in the order of prune, tobacco, raisin, and fig. Sweet caramel and toffee. Perfect amount of sweetness.
5.0 T: Again, absolutely wonderful. Rich caramel and toffee. Sweet prune, plum, raisin, fig, date, tobacco, and raisin. Intense, yet well integrated flavors much like GI BCS. The bourbon again is a perfect complement to the base brew. Plenty of leathery bourbon that has a spicy quality to it with perhaps just a touch of peat. Moderate oakiness with a more than moderate amount of vanilla. Not a hint of tannins. The booziness is definitely detectable, but it doesn't taste like 13.5%. However, it certainly feels like 13.5% as in warms on the finish. Sweet caramel aftertaste.
4.5 M: Thick, creamy, and slightly chewy body. My only issue with this is that the carbonation is just a tad lower than I'd prefer. Incredibly smooth given the ABV.
5.0 D: This is one helluva beer. There's no getting around that. This takes a very good beer and supplements it with bourbon barrel flavors, which makes it a truly world class brew. The base beer is still strong enough to shine while the barrel aging adds everything you would want and nothing you wouldn't. 2,071 charactersDavoleBomb, May 02, 2011

2010 Vintage.
Appearance- Pours a dark brown, almost completely opaque to the first glance but still does let a fair amount of light though, with a miniscule half finger of off white head that quickly dissipates to a very thin ring leaving below average lacing on the glass.
Smell- Is rather sweet with molasses, toffee and what seems to be like a burnt marshmallow smell is actually present, no I’m not just reading the bottle this is what I actually smell. You get a nice strong whiff of the boozy bourbon in there as well mixed with a mild hint of vanilla.
Taste- The boozy bourbon takes over right off the bat and finishes with a nice sweet note of the burnt marshmallow almost a buttery flavour? With mild hints of vanilla and sugary sweet molasses/toffee taste. 
Mouthfeel- A full bodied bourbon barrel aged ale that is very well balanced on the palate, with minimum to no carbonation.
Overall- OMG amazing doesn’t sum this beer up enough; you do get a strong kick of the bourbon but when it balances out with the sugary sweet tastes it all makes sense and the booze is not overpowering in any way, especially for the very high ABV. Kuhnhenn definitely hit the nail on the head with this one, it is an absolute gem of a beer and I feel privileged to have had the chance to try one. Just be warned to don’t have one of these and attempt to do anything but relax for the next couple hours, it will knock you on your face. 1,496 charactersRoke87, May 02, 2011

Bourbon Barrel 4th Dimension pours an intense mahogany, with a nice cherry shimmer along the edge of the glass when it's held up to light. There's a small amount of khaki colored foam capping it as well. Caramel is the clear standout in the smell department, it actually reminds me of the smell of the ice cream place I work for making their hot caramel topping. There's also an undercurrent of vanilla running throughout the nose, and a definite bourbon note is present as well. The aroma was good, but from the first sip this beer blasted off into the topmost echelon of any beer I've ever had. Caramel is still there in spades, and is again joined by vanilla and an impressively smooth bourbon quality. Newcomers to the party include flavors of creamy milk chocolate and and toasted marshmallows. There's also a delightfully mild warming sensation from the alcohol. It's absurd to think that this one's 13.5% alcohol, because it drinks like it's only about 9%. The body is impossibly rich and creamy, and is balanced by the absolute perfect carbonation, it's just enough to balance the sweetness and prevent the beer from coming across as cloying. Bourbon Barrel 4th Dementia reminds me a lot of the draft pour of Abacus I had a few weeks ago (which I guess makes sense seeing as I've never seen there to be a huge line between English Barleywines and Old Ales in the first place), and is one of the better beers I've ever had. 1,546 charactersaxeman9182, May 01, 2011

A: Pour is a very hazy chestnut brown with tiny white bubbles on the top. There seem to be a lot of miniature particles hanging out in here that you cannot see directly but by the opacity, you cannot quite see through the glass.
S: Aroma of sweet malt, lots of bourbon, lots of Oak, heavy toffee, thick roasted malt, sweet barleywine / old ale aroma of marshmallow, caramelized sugars. Booze aroma. So many great flavors it is hard to capture them all. 
T: Delicious light Toffee flavors , with heavy sugar Caramelization. Strong bourbon presence, a thick body, nearly stale in carbonation, which is perfect for the style. The label says toasted marshmellow and is definitely accurate. There is definitely a booze presence in this although it is not nearly as hot tasting as the non barrel aged beer. It seems to have been smoothed out from the barrel aging. 
Plenty of vanilla with the toasted marshmallow taste. Golden graham / graham cracker finish with a little dryness. Vanilla really is prominent in here both from the barrel aging and the bourbon presence. This really is a fantastic -bal So good that I may need to go back and knock down some Old Ales that I have rated in a similar score.
M: Thick in mouthfeel with a light carbonation, almost like drinking directly out of a cask with the low carbonation.
O: applause - this has really come through strong. While I loved the non BA 4d, this just is a different beer and it is done extremely well 1,542 charactersalpinebryant, Apr 30, 2011

BB4thDOA comes into the glass looking a deep dirty rotted tree bark brown bordering on black and it looks dirty. A surprising skim of tan bubbles on top with retention, not sticking though.
The smell is through the roof. Not over the top great bourbon scents along with the expected vanilla from the wood. The old ale portion leaps with smoke/peat, a nice roast, port scents akin to old English vintage ales. Some scattered dark fruit and a whiff of alcohol. Nice.
And I am literally blown away by the taste on this pup. I get bourbon up front, not overpowering but the vanilla that it brings as well melds with the old ale oh so nice. Wood along with dark fruit, port notes, an English yeast strain I pick up, toffee, sherry, alcohol. Top notch. I especially like the sweet vanilla alot.
With an ale this big, you have to expect some heat. It's there but not 13% there, I expect some heat with old ales and I find that it adds to the overall experience of the style. 4th is no exception. The body is big and is suited for sippin
Overall I enjoyed this one a hell of a lot and a little mix of this into some K. Raspberry Eisbock goes a long way. 1,225 charactersBARFLYB, Apr 27, 2011

A- comes to me from the angel behind the bar with a finger thick cap of tan head that settles before the first sip and leaves a solid ring and a skin on top. Muddy dark brown in color with a chestnut glow at the edges. 
S- opens up more subtle then expected with a smooth barrel presence, hits of vanilla, and chocolate, with some bourbon, brown sugar, and baked desserts. Touches of anise and other fall spice. Very complex by the end. 
T- sweet brown sugar and vanilla with bready toasted malts. Lots of the barrel come out over times but with such a simple and smooth approach. Some spice in the back and a bit of booze. Long sweet finish. 
M- on the fuller side on body with a slow creeper carb that ends up rather strong. As the brew warms there is a bit of growing heat that ends up being rather substantial but of a massive bb beer I'd want no less. 
O- well the hype is warranted this is a spectacular brew that I'm very glad I got to try. Its subtly is its winning quality but its bold ass hell at the same time. Its hard to explain. Just go out and drink one and you'll see. 1,156 charactersoglmcdgl, Apr 26, 2011

Nose is big, rich, sticky malt, honey, some nice oxidation, tobacco, leather. Quite deep and old feeling but still very lively and assertive. Fairly high carbonation upfront. Flavor is really big, assertive malt, hot throughout. A lot of that tobacco and leather quality. Pleasant oxidization, spicy on the finish. Dark fruits like plums and dates, some cookie-like qualities to this as well. The sweet fruits play with the old leather, tobacco and spices really well.

Got this one to celebrate Easter with my family. Didn't get the chance to drink it there, but I'm glad because now I'll be able to give it my full attention. After a vigorous pour it is a dark brown with very little head. Not much in the way of streaming bubbles. I smell bourbon, molasses, raisin and a little vanilla. Not an overpowering taste of bourbon, but I also get some molasses and raisin. The 13.5% alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is the only let down for me. It has a full body with very little carbonation. I picture this not unlike a drink that they would have in the medieval times. I guess that makes sense, since its an Old Ale. This will take me a while to drink, and I'll savor every sip. Overall, very complex brew, but the lack of carbonation makes me lower the score a little. 821 characters33nickadams, Apr 25, 2011

This is the 2010 vintage. 
A: Pours a very dark brown that reveals substantial garnet clarity around the edges. Even a vigorous pour doesn't produce much head, though some beige bubbles eventually come out of solution and vanish quickly into a thin bead on the beer. 
S: This is well-oxidized, in the good way. Lots of sherry and port notes. Substantial bourbon, oak, vanilla, even a touch of booze. Mild notes of maple syrup and prunes. Wow. This reminds heavily of Alpine Great and even some older vintages of J.W. Lees Harvest Ale in its assertive oxidation character. Whatever the Kunhhenn boys did to oxidize this beer so well, they did it properly. 
T: The taste is, again, assertive [good] oxidation: sherry and port flavors abound. Prunes are noticeable as well. Caramelly bourbon and vanilla define the mid-taste. Oak emerges near the finish, while the finish itself is toffee-maple that carries into the aftertaste. I'd love some tobacco or smoke (I admit it -- Adam has ruined me for this entire style), but that's a small nitpick. These Kunhehnn boys have figured out how to work with high-gravity beers to tremendous effect. 
M: This is slightly hot, still. I fault that in most beers, and I won't make an exception here. I'm torn, though; this could use some time to cool off, but that could push it over the edge from 'good' oxidation into bad (cardboard, soy). At least its full-bodied, low-carbonation mixture is right on the money. Great mouthfeel for an old ale; good job, Khunehnn! 
O: Kuhnenhn should be applauded for this. This is a warning shot over Hair of the Dog's bow. Someone else in America knows how to make an outstanding old ale... 1,730 charactersArbitrator, Apr 24, 2011

A: Pours a dark ruddy brown with about a finger of light tan head that disappeared into a thick collar that left a few wisps of lacing down the glass.
S: Rich notes of bourbon, sweet figs, prunes, vanilla and wood. There is a touch of raisins and maple syrup mixed in as well. 
T: All of the above scents are extremely well integrated and polished on the palate forming a wonderfully well rounded brew. I would add milk chocolate to the list of flavors I pick up along with caramel and a touch of ambiguous peppery spices in the finish. The vanilla, caramel, chocolate and bourbon really shine through. This tastes amazing. 
M: Thick body with a chewy and exceptionally creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is warm but not hot or overpowering. 
O: An all around exceptional brew. I thought the normal version was good but this takes it to the next level. Thanks again for hooking it up Jeff! 966 charactersscottfrie, Apr 22, 2011

A - A rich, exceptionally dark brown that looked black at times. Went with the hard pour on it which amounted to zero head at first, but then a surprising late-rising finger of khaki rose up beautifully, before fading to a small ring. No stick left on the sides.
S - Chocolate, alcohol, earth, dark fruit and vanilla. A really great mix of aromas that are all exceptionally balanced.
T - Roasted/crystalized/burnt caramel initially, wrapped in some smooth bourbon and rich chocolate. The alcohol is exceptionally well hidden, with only the tiniest bit of burn letting you know it is there. Toffee completes the taste. This is pretty freakin' awesome.
M - Full bodied, chewy, thick, lower carbonation.
O - Fantastic beer, shocked at how smooth and tasty this is. One of the finest beverages I've drank in a while. 894 charactersAgentZero, Apr 21, 2011

A. 
beer is a dark brown with red and ruby hues. A slight vigorous pour gave it some small but very fizzy head, like pouring a can of pop. Nothing really impressive, but my first whiff of this beer has me ready for more! :)
S.
An incredible aroma on this one. Big time smells of bourbon, vanilla and oak with some dark fruit coated with brown sugar. Reminds me a lot of the BA behemoth. Absolutely fantastic.
T.
Awesome, just like the nose. Tastes of bourbon, caramel and booze soaked dark fruits covered in brown sugar. A little wood/bourbon barrel taste as well which I enjoy as well, and not too "barrelly" like some cheap BA beers. Only thing I'd knock on this is it's a little too boozy, but otherwise stellar. 
M.
Beer is medium bodied with low carbonation (which isn't that bad for a BA monster like this). A little sticky/syrup as well which was expected judging from the sweetness. A bit hot as said above but very tolerable. A nice sipper!
O.
A fantastic BA beer. I think it almost rivals a beer like BA behemoth. Incredible smell and taste, unfortunately difficult to obtain in my area (even for those in MI). Special thanks to Wadsey for giving me the opportunity to try this. I had a small sample of this at the Michigan Winter Beerfest, but my palate was already wrecked at that time. 1,328 characterscetherid, Apr 21, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle poured into a Cantillon wine glass. Really huge thanks to normyk for sending this as an extra! 
2010 vintage.
A - Appearance is obviously quite similar to the version, but this one is perhaps a bit more ruddy brown. The head still retains that one finger of foam, with an eggshell white color. Retention appears to be a little lower, only lasting a few moments after pouring. Unfortunately the lacing doesn't seem to retain the cascading characteristic that made the normal version so enticing as it quickly slides down the glass.
S - The nose on this beer is utterly fantastic. The normal version was good, but had a bit too much malt sweetness in it. This version still has a strong malt presence, but the bourbon soaks the dark fruit to cut the malts. The complexities just keep coming as the beer warms. I am getting lots more vanilla here than in the original, and perhaps slightly less oak. Just an excellent smelling beer.
T - After the vast improvement in the nose, I would've expected an improvement in taste, but after my first sip, I was blown away. If any complaint could be levied against the normal version, its that it makes no reservations with its sweetness. The bourbon barrel alleviates this problem and much more. The first taste is almost exclusively a hit of bourbon, but it quickly transitions into bourbon soaked fruits, grapes, raisins, and even some toasted coconut. The malts still come through to bring toffee and caramel, but its much more balanced. This version does seem to be a little boozier, but for the improved taste, its easily worth it. The finish is long and filled with bourbon, fruit, and caramel.
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy-bodied with pretty low carbonation. Seems to have less carbonation than the regular version but that's to be expected with the barrel aging. Long finish that leaves a lasting impression on the palate.
D - Drinkability is high. This is an incredibly impressive beer in all respects, and an improvement in nearly every way over the normal version. The only complaint I have with this beer is that it does become a little heavy on the alcohol astringency as it warms, but for 13.50% I'm just surprised it wasn't there all along. Make no mistake, this is a sipper, but it is enjoyable the whole time. 2,287 charactersnhindian, Apr 17, 2011

A: Slightly cloudy rusty brown. No head or lace. It does however have some decent legs. No surprise with the high abv on this one.
S: Loads of dark fruit soaked on bourbon. Caramel and toffee laced with bourbon. Rich malt sweetness along with plenty of hot booze. 
T: Thankfully the bourbon heat is much more subdued in the flavor. It's there but it meshes well with all the other flavors. Dark fruits, toffee, caramel, wet barrel wood, brown sugar, sweet tarts. 
M: Full body with just a hint of carbonation. Slowly slips across my tongue like a fine scotch.
O: Overall this is not my favorite style so I tend to have a hard time judging it. This one seemed to fit the style to a t. 770 charactersbeerwolf77, Apr 17, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served at 54º cellar temperature into a Duvel tulip.
Tawny brown with glints of ruby when held to the light. About a fingers width of foam rises initially and settles quickly into a ring around the edge. The glassy surface reflects the light, like a still pool of oil. Random flecks of spotty lace adorn the glass. 
Rich aroma of fried plantains, toasted almonds, rich toffee, vanilla bean, with a dose of mellow bourbon barrel underlying the sweeter notes. Impressive and nuanced. 
Complex rich flavors of oak, vanilla, brown sugar, toasted coconut, almonds, and sweet homemade toffee. Chewy, syrupy, and rich, though balanced and not overly sweet. Long finish of oak barrel and toffee. Bourbon is sweet, lending vanilla and coconut, and a minimal amount of heat, though it's certainly present. Creamy and full bodied. Confectionary. Slightest numbing from the alcohol, but it's remarkably hidden in the taste. Well crafted in that respect, no single aspect dominates, yet they blend together so well. The barleywine retains it's rich toffee character, and marries seamlessly with the barrel. 
Really nice, glad I had the chance to try it. Thanks Alex! Most generous, that guy. 1,183 charactersemerge077, Apr 08, 2011

(A)- Pours a thick burnt sienna color. Produced some tan to transparent bubbles; not surprising considering the ABV.
(S)- A nice smooth yet rich dry oaky caramel and vanilla richness. Bits of fig with a surprisingly balanced boozy finish. Not an overwhelming booze bomb like I was anticipating.
(T)- Very similar to the smell. A really nice dry charred oak character. Some nice fig and caramel. Ridiculously smooth, yet rich. The bourbon barrel aging really has been integrated very well into the overall character of the beer; it did not overpower it, but rather enhanced it.
(M)- A mellow carbonation level, yet fitting for the style. The ABV is expertly hidden; in no way does this feel like 13.5%. Rich and sweet, but has a really fitting mellow charred oak note that fits right into the mix.
(D)- A fantastic old ale. Rich and sweet, yet complex and smooth despite the ABV. Very well done. I find it very rewarding to see a beer that actually benefits from barrel aging and in this is a shining example how it should be. While I might just barely favor the regular non barrel aged version, this is still a top notch beer in its own right. 1,239 characterssweemzander, Apr 06, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Alex (Masterski) for bringing this one up on his visit to Alaska. 
Pours a nice brown color with major ruby highlights. Carbonation quickly falls to a skim, and leaves no lacing, but appears to be carbonated correctly for the style. 
Nose is chock full of dark fruit. Some caramel lurking in there as well, and also an odd maltiness that i picked up in alot of kuhnhenn's huge beers (extraneous and BBBW). 
The caramel flavors come on strong in the flavor, complimented by a big bourbony booziness. Certainly not for the faint of heart. Pretty hot. The finish is a little more bitter than i expected, but certainly not out of the style's sweetspot. Booze, caramel, and slight dark fruits linger after each sip.
Mouthfeel is money. Big and chewy, good carbonation, ideal. My only gripe is that it could be a touch bigger body-wise. Feels every so slightly thin.
Overall a very nice beer. Not much to critique here. A little more body, and slightly less booze would be nice, but really not in need of any serious alterations, IMO. A great beer. Thanks again Alex. 1,081 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Mar 25, 2011
4.81/5  rDev +6.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Had this baby on tap... somewhere. It technically wasn't legal in the state I had it in so I'll leave it at that :-P
Big thanks to MbpBugeye for purchasing this glass for me, though I think he still owes his brother and me a paddle next time we're out drinking... wherever it was that we were drinking this... yeah. :-)
Ok, two smiley faces in the first two paragraphs of a review... we're not off to a good start here, so time to dig into it. This is review #300 on the eve of my 1 year BA anniversary. I chose this beer because it was one of the most delicious beers of 2011 so far for me.
Served in a snifter, poured a cloudy root beer color, fairly thick, with a head of half a finger. The foam is cream colored and left above average lacing. My final notes for the appearance say "thick and heavy."
The smell... ohh the smell!! Dear god is this a luxuriously decadent beer! The smell of BB 4th Dementia ranks up there with the best smelling beers I have ever experienced. Sweet, sweet bourbon is really strong and in-your-face, yet it is well balanced with the malt heavy background. I kept smelling my snifter repeatedly without taking a sip - a practice my wife makes fun of me for indulging in. At one point she had to smack me, saying, "your eyelids are fluttering whenever you smell that beer!"
Yes. Yes, I guess they were. ;-)
Ohh snap, a third smiley. Well to be honest, the memory of this beer does make me smile. How I loathe the fact that this is not available in Ohio. The aroma is deeply nuanced with vanilla and oak, peppery spikes of earthy hops and chocolaty malts. This is every bit as wondrous as Founders Backwoods Bastard, only amplified by a factor of ten. And here I thought that no other brewery could master the art of barrel aging as well as Founders has...
The taste could hardly compare to the sublime aromatics of this brew, but it nevertheless impressed the hell out of me. Smooth and extremely rich, this was certainly a sipper. Luscious vanilla lends a buttery sweetness while oak provides a balancing dryness. There's a slight roastinesss to the malt character, but to be honest the barreling has mellowed the hell out of whatever the base beer used to be.
As the beer warmed and grew ever more swirled in my snifter, I began to pick out deeper waves of sweet complexity I can only ascribe the moniker of 'pure awesomeness.' Cinnamon crumble coffee cake became the dominant flavor, and all I can say is that this beer is damn delicious.
The alcohol on a beer that tops in at over 13% abv can never be dismissed fully, but I must state that this brew is very well balanced. The bourbon heat is appropriately warming, but never to the point of burning nor was agitating enough as to have prevented me from finishing my glass much more quickly than I should have. I stress that this beer is sticky sweet, but dry on the finish, and always always always - smooth.
The drinkability was fantastic. Had I not already been drinking since 8am, with plans to sample many more beers that day, I would have eagerly run to garner a second glass for myself. I feel that this is one of those beers that will always remain on my 'wants' list due to the sheer enjoyment I got from drinking (and most importantly - smelling) it.
My first ever Kuhnhenn beer was a true experience to remember. 3,320 charactersSpider889, Mar 17, 2011

The nose is mostly dark fruits at first. Plumbs, dark cherries and raisins. Also a little bit of marshmellow and toasted coconut.
The taste is similar. Dark fruits, mostly dark cherry and raisin, at first but then flavors of marshmallow, toasted coconut, and bakers chocolate take over accompanied by hints of oak and alcohol. Quite vinious.
Very sweet but the oak and alcohol helps to balance it out a little bit. Full bodied with low level of smooth carbonation. Alcohol starts to numb the tongue after awhile. Slightly chewy and round, but not super sticky or viscous.
A sipper for sure. 694 charactersbillshmeinke, Mar 06, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at the brewery, drank from a snifter. The beer was served to me with a thin white head sitting atop a dark brown/amber (almost purplish) cloudy glass of beer. There was minimal lacing left down the glass as I drank it down.
The beer smelled of of rich, sweet toffie-fied caramel drenched candied fruit with a splash of bourbon thrown in. Light hints of vanilla as well. The taste matched the nose closely, with a bit of booze up front quickly followed by deliciously sweet malty dark fruit goodness. The alcohol is well masked in this beer. The body was medium, with an ample amount of carbonation. 
Highly, highly drinkable for a high ABV old ale. The Kuhnhenn Bros hit it out of the park with this brew. 718 characterssurlytheduff, Mar 05, 2011

appearance - dark brown in color, some light makes it through along the edges of the glass it is more of a milk chocolate brown, thin tan head with a low amount of carbonation
smell - up front there is a strong bourbon scent, then there is a sweet roasted malt middle with a hint of caramel and vanilla, finishes with a slight hint of dried dates or raisins, and a slight smell of alcohol, very enticing smell
taste - taste is following smell to start, strong sweet bourbon flavor that remains through the middle, from the bourbon a sweet roasted malt shines with a bit of dulce de leche peaking in, and going into some sort of dried fruit sweetness, finishes with a nice mellow bourbon and vanilla hints, low alcohol presence
mouthfeel - feels almost syrupy, with the light carbonation giving it a slightly lightened feel that makes this a very refreshing warmer, self restraint was needed to make this one last
drinkability - this one is quite easy to sip on, considering it was ordered as my first on three separate occasions, proves to me that this is a solid brew, enjoy this one with the free house popcorn and good conversation 1,414 charactersSeaUrchin, Feb 27, 2011

A - pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with just a tiny foam ring that forms around the edges. It almost looks like there is some red hues around the edges. Spotty lacing that leaves no retention on the sides.
S - Wow! This smells amazing! Deep toffee notes with heavy brown sugar, coconut and caramel. Other notes such as vanilla and oak. The bourbon barrel comes through very nicely and smell rich and smooth. Truly a delicious smelling brew.
T - Taste pretty much follows the nose with notes of caramel, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, candy, coconut and sweet, creamy bourbon. There is only a tiny bit of leather and tabacco in it, like in the regular 4th dementia, but the bourbon is more forward in this one and is very nice. There is a bit of heat in the taste, but its understandable at 13.5%. Awesome! 
M - Carbonation in this one is pretty good. Leaves a bit of a tingly feeling in the mouth. A bit of heat from the booze but it is very welcoming. 
D - Really a great treat. It is a nice sipper for a nice winter night (since we got about 6 inches of snow today.) The bourbon is very nice in this one and it is top notch. I really wish I had more, but I'll let my last bottle cellar for a couple years before I try it again. 1,339 charactersjoshuaseresse, Feb 21, 2011

Alex sent me a bottle of this, many thanks to you, kind sir. 2010 vintage packaged so wonderfully well I have a hard time believing its a Kuhnhenn beer. This beer got a little wet in my fridge, and I can still read the label. Fancy that!
A murky, reddish brown with a dense, light brown head that rises briefly before falling off to a thin ring. There's a little bit of glass-coating sweetness as well. The nose is stunning. The base beer is a rather leathery beer to start with, and the barrel just accentuates that character. Rich and complex,I get toffee, coconut, vanilla and a surprising oxidation character. In this way, it's very port-like. There's also some raisins in sugar syrup here. This beer really evolves, I get a few puffs of rose water as well. 
The palate really demonstrates the fact that this is closer to a port or a cognac than a beer. Rich, complex sweetness with brown sugar, raw sugar (jaggery), plenty of dark caramel, as well as more to go with that malt sweetness - there's tobacco, leather, a little smokiness even. The barrel character is beautifully integrated with vanilla, bourbon heat and tannins. Fruity in the mid-palate, this has raisins and dates as well as a very port-like oxidation character. Moderately tannic on the finish with some sweetness and heat, this is a beer that is rather wonderfully put together. Medium in body with soft carbonation, the mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Excellent stuff, despite the richness and sweetness, this drinks very easily.
**Edit 27 May 2012*
Miraculously, this seems to have fallen off, especially the mouthfeel. It doesn't have the complexity it once had, it seems to have lost it in the past few months. It's just become mellow. Tons of honey. Still excellent. 4.5/4.5/4.5/4 1,789 charactersDefenCorps, Feb 18, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle picked up by my mom at the Winter Solstice 2010 party. Served in a snifter.
Pours a dark reddish-brown with a very thin, short-lasting head. Some legs around the edges of the glass plus a bit of a thin collar. Nose is really nice and complex with bourbon, dark fruits, brown sugar, and plenty of malt sweetness. Everything is integrated well and there's just a bit of booze in the background. The flavor isn't quite as complex, but I still really enjoyed it. A bit more booze in the flavor than was present in the nose. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth; the bourbon and booze integrate well with the body on this. Very delicious and I'm looking forward to some aged bottles of this in the future. 700 charactersThorpe429, Feb 14, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Many thanks to gormanb for the opportunity to try this beauty.
The beer pours a fairly dark brown color with good head retention and decent lacing. While the beer doesn't look all that impressive, one whiff when I opened the bottle told me I was in for something special. Wow. I get a huge aroma of brown sugar, prunes, maraschino cherries, vanilla and milk chocolate. This beer smells great! As good as this beer smells, it's even better on the palate. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but I also pick up anise, light butter and cherry cough drops, with a hint of heat (from alcohol- bourbon barrel aging is very noticeable in this one) and hoppy bitterness in the finish. The latter helps to counter somewhat the unbelievable amount of richness I get in this beer. Interestingly, although this beer is pretty sweet, it's not at all cloying or tiring on the palate. Granted, this beer is pretty rich and weighty on the palate, but then the alcohol is 13.5%. Otherwise, the finish is sweet, long and powerful. Drinkability isn't too bad, especially considering the abv. and sweetness. Still, there's no getting around the fact that the alcohol is pretty noticeable, and that this is very much a sipper. 
This beer is comparable to a fine vintage or tawny port, and would work equally well at the conclusion of a fine meal. Just an altogether excellent fine aged ale from the folks at Kuhnhenn. 1,402 charactersJohn_M, Feb 12, 2011

Aroma is complex and strong. Good bourbon, molasses, raisins, plums, sweet maltiness. Very nice.
Beer is medium in body and completely coats the mouth. It's sweet up front and gives way to a nice smooth liquor flavor on the midpalate leading to a mild but clean bitterness at the back, it's subtle but there. The whole beer is good. I want to hold it in my mouth. There is a nearly treacle-like sweetness through out, minimal esters and other characters. A very good beer. 668 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 11, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I didnt want to be the first one to say where I had this on tap. Shit, I still wont say. Its a respect thing. But lets just say it wasnt necessarily supposed to be where it was. But when it was announced that this was on tap there was a collective "Oooohhhh!" heard across the room. Having recently enjoyed a bottle of this stuff, I was probably the loudest of the "oohs" as I grabbed Chris and drug him over to where it was being served. 
Served on tap, from a sixtel, into a snifter. Probably about a 10oz pour for $7. Quite the steal if you ask me. Ive drank much less enjoyable beers for more money at Bodega.
A- Its not much different looking on tap than it was when I had my bottle. Perhaps there was a little more lacing from the tap version and a little more clarity as well. Its a dark, fairly cloudy chestnut, earthy red/brown. 
S- After I was done nursing my snifter pour and Chris and I had moved on, my brother approached and said "The smell of this is YEAH!" I wasnt sure what beer he had, but I guessed that it was the Kuhnhenn. I was correct. We both shared a short freakout over how delicious the smell of this beer was. There really isnt much out there that smells this smoothed out, silky, lovely and huge, robust and powerful at the same time. Cherry, toffee, caramel, Alcohol and chocolate chip cookies are flawlessly executed. I think Im going to BM the Bros and see if they cant raise my 5 to a 500 here. 
T- Im left shaking my head in disbelief. Its a true wonder how a beer this strong can be so smooth, having all of its flavors so artfully interwoven. Its pretty close to the aroma. Lots of chocolate chip cookies, toffee, nougat, vanilla and rum-raisin. Its so soft yet huge at the same time. 
M- Very smooth with an unreal creaminess. The alcohol burn is really all you get from the 14% abv. It hardly affects the flavors. Personally, I think the alcohol heat is perfect for this beer. 
D- Ive had this twice in a month. Sadly I think thats probably going to be the last time I have it. No, Ill totally be driving the 4 hours to Warren to snag this again. Simply the best beer I've ever had. 2,126 charactersMbpBugeye, Feb 11, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Muddy reddish-brown with little head, low carbonation. Good enough for what it is. The aroma, on the other hand, is incredible. Burnt sugar, integrated oak and bourbon, stewed dark fruits. Some leathery, port-like oxidation, too. Very little noticeable alcohol. The taste, likewise, is incredible. Brown sugar/molasses flavors provide a backbone for notes of leather, and bourbon. There's a nice fruitiness that's date-like, and graceful oxidation that lends a touch of port and cocoa. The body is full, carbonation low. A little too easy to drink. This reminds me quite a bit of Kuhnhenn's 2005 bourbon barrel aged barleywine. 627 characterslargadeer, Feb 09, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Review from notes taken 2/5/11. A guest tap/interesting surprise at Jackie O's during the strong ale event.
This brew pours a hazed amber brown without a head. Not even a lace creeps to the top of this brew. A few off-white bubbles rise to the surface when this brew is swirled and that is all that displays reminiscent of a head.
The aroma is sweet with a scent of caramel or toasted toffee and vanilla. In the back it is lightly spicy and earthy with hops. A minorly evident mineral character is present that fades. As this brew warms, it stings the nose with a fusel alcohol presence that is not nearly as evident as I was expecting for 13.5%. Also increasing in character is the rich scent of toffee tones.
The taste of this brew is sweet with a surprisingly forward vanilla upfront that turns more into a caramelized sugar and caramel malt flavor. There is a big booze presence in this brew which is not surprising considering. It has a modest hoppy earthy bitterness that creates a dryness when coupled with the alcohol into the finish. The oak only comes through an makes itself known as it warms up with a very bitey alcohol character that has an evaporative quality on the tongue.
This is a full bodied brew, smooth with a modest amount of carbonation. It is quite drinkable with more of an herbal earthy bitterness and dryness that I was not expecting. Very well done and a complete transformation from the non-barreled version that I had not too long ago. This could be a real gem in a few years, wish I had a bottle or two to stash away. 1,553 charactersstakem, Feb 08, 2011

The problem is detailed in ptykozoon's review perfectly...either the abv or a slightly annoying hop bite affects this beers finish and takes away from what will be a spectacular beer down the road. Normally I would go through the full review but other reviewers have hit the flavor on the head except for the back end sting of this one. 
Do yourself a huge favor...pick up at least two of these and drink one now. Then age the other as long as possible. I think that will reveal this beers true potential which I forecast will be amazing. 621 charactersGoGriz, Jan 28, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Hard pour reveals a short lived fizzy head. Beer looks thin and well carbonated. Pretty brownish purple - no head, lacing or legs.
Vanilla, liquor - bourbon, cherries, lots of caramel, toffee, butterscotch and a bit of chocolate fudge.
Mostly caramel and roasted chocolate, raisin. Very tasty, reminiscent of wine.
Nice bite from the abv, thick mouthfeel, as opposed to my original assumptions - weighty texture, lighter carbonation. Excellent. 
Could DEFINITELY use some more ageing, the abv gets in the way of things and knocks of some complexity points. Otherwise this beer is fantastic.

4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle from my favorite MI trader.
Pours a murky chestnut brown with a small beige head that recedes to a small collar and leaves no lacing, just some boozy legs clinging to the side.
Aroma is massive and spectacular. Where to begin - sweet caramel malts, vanilla, coconut, toffee, tobacco, leather and sugar-coated dark fruits. Let alone the bourbon and oak which integrate into the rest. Whoa.
Taste is just as impressive with an initial sweetness from coconut, caramel malts and dark fruits - raisins and figs. There is also an underlying earthy leather character. The finish is just decadent with toffee, vanilla and a nice bourbon burn with spicy oak thrown in.
The mouthfeel is smooth and dessert-like, thick and sweet with minimal carbonation but plenty for the style.
This is an exceptional beer, decadent, complex and wonderfully balanced for such a massive beer. One of the best beers I've had in recent memory...possibly ever. 947 charactersgford217, Jan 23, 2011

The aroma is very rich with caramel, toffee, nuttiness, booze, and sweet dark fruits. Absolutely luscious and decadent.
The flavor lives up to the aroma. Wow, this is quite good. Rich toffee and oak up front with a burning booziness in the back of the throat that reminds you of the huge ABV. This is big, bold, and unapologetic but not messy.
The body is medium to full and carbonation is low but still somewhat prickly.
Overall this beer is phenomenal, no doubts about it. I'm not sure it is really an improvement on the regular 4th Dementia, but rather an equally good but different beer. 676 charactersalcstradamus, Jan 20, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on tap at Kuhnhenn in a tulip. 
Appearance: Bourbon Barrel Fourth Dementia is bistre in color with walnut edges. A small off-white head starts firm, then fades to mostly a ring. Not much lace, but the head reaffirms itself with each sip or swirl. Not a ton of lace expected here with such a big ABV.
Smell: Great aroma, there is no doubt about it. Tons of molasses, plums, raisins, fig, caramel, and dark roasted malts. Bourbon and oak just add another level of complexity, although each aroma is easily identifiable in its own right.
Taste: Once I smelled this, I figured the taste would be incredible, and it does not disappoint. Just tons of flavor throughout each sip. The bourbon barrel aging interacts perfectly with the original beer. Very complex. Caramel malt is the first flavor to be noticed, and then an bourbon burning that is present throughout. Sweet molasses and roasted malt, figs, and plums provide the sweetness. Light earthy hops, then oak, smoke, and a touch of bourbon to finish. Very satisfying.
Mouthfeel: The creaminess is immediately noticeable, with the body of the beer quashing the carbonation. Alcohol warms the throat and stomach throughout, and the lips are left a little bit sticky. A very full body.
Drinkability: Barrel aging claims another victory. It just made a great beer even better. Obviously a sipper, but I would be satisfied sipping this for a long time. 1,410 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 12, 2011

A - Pours a mirky reddish/brown, half a fingers-worth of off-white head with some larger bubbles here and there on top. After the initial pour, there's no lacing a some random bubbles and a thin film on top.
S - Burnt sugars, candy, bourbon, oak, dark fruits, bourbon, malts and more bourbon. It's not overly sweet and not too boozy. I was very surprised how balanced this one was, especially with very little aging.
T - Very much similar to the nose. Bourbon, burnt sugars, candy, oak, roasty malts. Again, nothing overpowering each other here...everything is working well together. I wouldn't say there's no booze coming through, but not 13.5% worth.
M - Medium to full, rich and smooth, drinks like a fine spirit.
D - It took me an hour to finish my pour, but I really took my time to enjoy it since it was my only beer of the visit. It was excellent on-tap and I'm looking forward to cracking a bottle in the near future. A must-try! 1,131 charactersSean9689, Jan 11, 2011

A - Pours with a dime of off-white foam that settles to a thin ring and some filmy haze on top, but no lace. Nearly opaque dark brown body.
S - Earthy bourbon, dark fruits, oak, vanilla, some grape and dark fruit sweetness. As it approaches room temperature it grows slightly fusel, but it's not unexpected considering this is over 13%.
T - Bourbon, vanilla, raisins, brown sugar, and shockingly well-hidden booze. From taste alone I would never guess this was as strong as it is. It's essentially a reference quality barrel-aged old ale.
M - Medium-full body, some expected warming of the throat. Finish is surprisingly clean and doesn't feel syrupy or cloying. Carbonation is quite low, but style-appropriate.
D - Splitting a 12oz bottle three ways was an appropriate serving, although I could probably tackle a bottle on my own if I was feeling ambitious. This should cellar extremely well and should only improve with age. 1,014 charactersMasterSki, Jan 10, 2011

A: The beer is a medium brown in color and has very little head. Actually just a swirl of bubbles after a few seconds.
S: The smell is great and is of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, and a little bit of dark fruit. 
All of the notes come together well.
T: This beer is very rich and complex. There's bourbon, burnt sugar, brandy and a little bit of cherries and raspberries deep down. There's a bit of alcohol heat but not much.
M: I thought that this was just about spot on. There's a very appropriate level of carbonation, and a great aftertaste. The beer sits on the tongue well.
D: For a high ABV beer this has excellent drinkability. It went down easy and I could have easily had more of this. I don't really know what to compare this beer to, as I've never really had anything like it. More brewery's should experiment with a bourbon aged old ale. 952 charactersglazeman, Dec 29, 2010

4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A big, huge thanks goes out to Jay for hooking me p with this one. I had been on a mission to track down this as well as the Barley wine for quite some time, and it was just utterly fantastic to be able to try them both in the same week. Served at cellar temperature and poured into an over sized wine glass. This one was consumed on 08/07/2008.
The appearance was ominous. A deep, dark brown. color emerged almost immediately. Entirely opaque, except for a few hints of light on the sides and bottom that showed off a bit of a reddish hue. The head was small, maybe an inch at first and then settling down to about a quarter of an inch, but it did have a tremendous amount of coating effect on the sides of the glass.
The aroma was just spectacular. Lovely hints of vanilla and bourbon, swirling around with caramel, roasted malts and a deep, sweet profile. Enormously complex, it was hard to put the entire thing into context, decadent is a good word. This followed along the flavor as well. Lots of lightly blended bourbon flavors, nothing over the top or really heavy, this was wonderfully accented, and essentially perfection. Started with a rolling touch of caramel, and sugary roasted malts that were accented by touches of vanilla and oak. Hints of some earthy, touches rolled into it as well. Long lasting flavor of bourbon, with a touch of peppery spice on the finish. Luscious Mouthfeel was really just the icing as it came off full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. A smooth sipper, this was easily the nightcap on the evening and needed to be enjoyed over the long haul which It was.
Overall this was fantastic. My first two BA beers from them have both been two of the best I haev ever had. They really know what they are doing with this one. To be honest I have to score this high, as I really have had maybe one or two beers that I truly liked better then this in the style at all. Damn near perfection and something I would only wish I could get again. Hopefully I can trade for another bottle. 2,030 charactersmikesgroove, Aug 10, 2008

Very dark brown, mahogany edges with a fine beige cap and lots of spotty, streaky lacing. Tons of caramel and toffee with a rich earthy/oaky aroma. Some vanilla and raisin, mild booze. Balanced bitterness keeps the big malty sweetness in check. Caramel and toffee, mild woody character, tootsie roll, some chocolate character. Amazing, rich flavour. Full bodied, low carbonation makes it a little heavy, smooth texture. Kuhnhenn has a knack for making big beers extremely drinkable. The barrel aging didn't overpower the base beer, which I found really appealing, while adding a new complexity to a great old ale. 679 charactersDrJay, Mar 01, 2008

I love the regualr Fourth Dementia, so I've been dying to try this one.
Pours a hazy dark brown with no head to speak of. Smells of bourbon, raisin, plum. There is a heck of a lot going on in the flavor department- bourbon, chocolate, plum, a slight barrel tannin, very interesting and damn good! There's also a hint of a flavor that reminds me of pipe tobacco. Leaves a light film on the tongue- perfect for a lingering pleasant aftertaste. Noticeable alcohol warming on the back of the throat after a bit.
Again, Kuhnhenn does not disappoint. This is one hell of a tasty old ale! Definitely worth seeking out. 637 charactersfartingdog, Sep 11, 2007

pours a crystal clear deep red-brown with nice ruby highlights when held to the light. a very scant incredibly fine tan head forms and disappears almost instantly. no lace.
aroma is excellent. lots of vanilla and oak. toffee and caramel. notes of brandy and maybe a little sherry. raisin. chocolate. light alcohol. bit of almond. bread and biscuit malt.
taste is amazing. much smoother and mellower than the regular 4th dementia, and meshed together nicely. light alcohol. dark fruit - raisin and date. light toffee. caramel. dark chocolate. almond and hazelnut. hint of coffee. vanilla and more vanilla. touch of raw oak. much of the bourbon seems to have mellowed since my last sampling when freshly bottled. doesn't have as much lingering sweetness as the regular 4th dementia. bread and biscuit malt. so many layers. just incredible stuff.
mouthfeel is fantastic. super smooth well integrated low carbonation level. medium-big body is great.
drinkability is excellent. the 7 or so months since i purchased this bottle has given it time to mellow out and removed all the 'hot' alcohol i noticed when fresh. perfect balanced, with a more mellowed warmth than the regular 4th dementia. i thought the drinkability on that one was excellent, but this brings it to a new level. fantastic stuff. 1,493 charactersgrub, Aug 06, 2007

I can smell this beer instantly, the woodiness and rich malts waft up and have me salivating. Aroma is hugely rich and sweet with prunes, caramel, grapes, and vanilla, as well as a large deep leather and wood aroma to balance the sweet along with a faint soy sauce. Taste follows suit with some hugely rich and sweet pruney and caramel maltiness and a nice dose of woodiness that mingles with a warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, a slight tingle from the woodiness blends with the warm alcohol in a slightly dry finish. This beer has pretty much floored me, I love the regular 4th and this is far and above, extremely complex aroma, extremely rich taste, a sipper for sure, but a heavenly one at that. Cheers to Kuhnhenn for making such an incredible beer. 906 charactershoppymeal, Jun 09, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5As good as a old ale can look. Amber/copper chock full of scarlet undertones. Head is tan full and has very good retention considering ABV. Leaves a layers of lace wherever any head was. Nearly opaque accpet when held to light where the ruby scarlet takes charge. 
One of those beers you just don't want to take your nose out of. Full of rich candied toffee. Burnt caramel and hints of milk chocolate. Aromas of what seems to be pounds and pounds of dried smyrna figs put in a blender and liquified. Bing cherry, brown sugar and maple with a nutty character. Nice sweet toasted vanilla oak aromas,delicously adventurous. 
Wow is the first thing that comes to mind. Rich and full with a round brown sugar maple sweetness that isn't cloying at all. Again this is just full of pasty fig flavors and aromas. Dried berries and cherries, with a hint of hazlenut. Nice alcohol burn in the chest is the only offsetting flavor. Barrel aging added a nice hint of vanilla and sweet bready flavors meld well with the full milk chocolate covered toffee mid palate. 
Although this beer is huge I could drink this all day everyday and life would be nice. Unfortunately I can't so I will savor this beauty for the next couple hours. 1,225 charactersmcallister, May 20, 2007

Poured a thick, dark mahogany with copper highlights. Absolutely no head and no noticeable carbonation.
Aroma was rich and sweet. Dark and dried fruits (plums, prunes and raisins) were apparent along with brown sugar and a port wine-like quality.
Taste was similar to smell except deeper, darker and more alcohol rich. Smooth, toasted malts along with burnt sugar, raisins and currants came through strong up front. The intense, rummy alcohol flavor took over mid-palate and crescendoed in the finish, where it became sharp and biting. No discernible hop presence.
Mouthfeel was quite syrupy, thick and rich with little to no carbonation.
As for drinkability, this beer was definitely a sipper. Even with the strong flavors and aromas, I felt that the alcohol intensity was overwhelming (though not surprising at 13.5% ABV). 874 charactersDamian, Feb 20, 2007

Pours a dark brown liquid with red edgings. Smells solventy, chocolate, char, strawberry, stingy vanilla and coconut as it warms. The overall aroma, I just can't describe. Wonderful to sniff.
Tastes like a sort of chocolate liquor. Chocolate covered strawberries with a stray raisin thrown in for good measure. Sharp clean alcohol sting and dry finish. Not strong oak, refined and well done. Minimal char mixes with chocolate and toffee. Chocolate candy with vanilla-liquor center. Caramel is buried, some sherry malt-oxidation and a smidge of butterscotch (not diacetyl). Thick smooth body could overbear, but the alcohol cleans. Mild carbonation. Fantastic beer. 786 charactersmentor, Feb 12, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Spuyten Duyvil, Bklyn, NY, as part of their Big Fattys celebration or month long ode to strong and barrel aged beer. This one seemed to be the hot beer according to the gathered throng of BA beer aficionados, so I gave it a try. Poured into a tall wine glass, it exhibited low carbonation, minimal head and next to no lacing. Dark, muddy and dark milk chocolaty looking. Big nose of bourbon, raisins, figs and some alcohol. Served near room temp. on a freezing cold day. Soft, smooth, heady brew, plenty of rum raisin, vanilla, chocolate and dark malty goodness. Alcohol clearly present but did not take away from drinkability. World class sipper, night cap kind of brew. A welcome treat on tap. 713 charactersBillolick, Feb 04, 2007
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had no idea what I had in my fridge. This has been sitting in my fridge since last summer. That's 2005! Holy Crap! I can't believe I waited so long to try this.
A: Poured into and IPA glass a dark coffee with red highligts. Foam only came from the last pour of the bottle leaving around a 1/4" of head which has remained around the rim.
S: Oranges. Grapes, chocolate, maltiness.Maybe some apples? Alcohol.
T: Sweet (grapes and apples) and malty (chocolate and coffee). Oh, and some Hops kick it in the rear! For an bittery alcohol leave.
M: Bittery sweet and silky smooth. 
D: Not everyday but this is my first Barleywine so, I am not used to them yet. 661 charactersstouty1, Jan 17, 2007

Sweet mother of god! The smell hits as soon as I open the bottle, super sweet malts, cherries, chocolate, caramel. This thing is trying to climb down my throat while still in the bottle. Served at about 65 degrees and pours a dark amber with sticky white lacing that hangs on the sides of the glass. 
The taste was better than the smell. Silky smooth, just the right amount of sweetness, complex fruits, chocolate, with the oaky bourbon alcohol very well hidden. 
I could easily drink this every day and not get tired of it. This is now my favorite barleywine by far. Exceptional in every way. I'm searching for real estate near the brewery! 658 characterskirok1999, Jan 16, 2007
4.95/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours fairly brown, but dark red when held to light, with a strong white head that retains very well and leaves retention. Surprising given the percent. Smell jumps out at you, moreso than some DIPA's even. The smell is of bourbon, brown sugar, cherry, molasses, vanilla, oak and maybe even some dates; remarkable. Taste is hard for me to keep track of, it just has so many flavors blended together so well. Seems like some of the bourbon beers I have had have too much bourbon, this is not the case with this one. Full bodied, with slightly higher than medium carbonation; a little less and this one's perfect. A damn near perfect sipper, I'd drink plenty of this if it was available. Well worth the very long trip to Michigan for it. Highly recommended. 755 charactersbadbeer, Jan 10, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Roughly poured the head is wuite large and the lacing is seemingly sticky as all hell. The smell is just overwhelming with different flavors of a slight bourbon, fig, and it's just really complex...I can't put my finger on one thing before thinking of something else. The taste is HUGE, it's got a high alcohol kick with some great full flavors that won't let you down. There's a very sweet coffee roastiness and a huge fig flavor, but not totally fig, you'll notice some other flavors along with it. The mouthfeel was great, a little smooth, but there's an alcohol bite to it. Overall this is really great, I can't wait to age it for a few years and see how the flavors mellow. 678 charactersErdinger2003, Jan 09, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed this wonderful treat at Ashley's as a part of the Raspberry Eisbock Release Party. Tried this after the eisbock and wow was I blown away. Filled the snifter with gleaming dark ruby with russet brown edges. Small, ringy head of light khaki. Nose of rich, sweet malts. Sugary and fruity, with ample touches of oak, bourbon, vanilla, and alcohol. Taste follows suit. Incredible. Very malty, but not overly sweet. Sugary fruits, caramel, brown sugar, and toffee up front. Bourbon, oak, and madeira around the edges. Hop bitterness is moderate, stopping this malt bomb from being cloying. Finish is warming and whiskeyish and terrific. Velvety mouthfeel with perfectly modest carbonation. Full-bodied but not too syrupy or cloying. I drank three large snifters of this in a row and I still wanted more! 805 charactersalexgash, Dec 14, 2006
