Pours a hazy orange.
Smell is tropical as hell, with mngo, pineapple and starfruit, backed up by some ginger.
The taste ditches most of the starfruit, but keeps the other. The ginger notes really make this something very special.
Mouthfeel is spot on, soft and pillowy and very smooth.
I love Grimm, and this was the first of their hoppy beers i got to try, It was as good as I had hoped. 427 charactersJamFuel, Mar 14, 2017

Served in a cervoise
Fantastic appearance. The hazy, amber-tinged brassy yellow body was topped by an inch tall, super tight and frothy, bright white head. Solid retention. The crown slowly dropped to a lasting cap. Streaky, patchy lacing coated much of the glass.
The nose was super hoppy and exotic initially. "Tutti fruity" came to mind. Huge tropical fruit presence. Mango and passionfruit dominated. There was an intensely dank, weed-like quality too. Orange and tangerine notes were apparent as well. As the beer sat, the citrus notes quickly overshadowed the other interesting nuances.
The flavor profile was also really hoppy and fruity. Juicy orange and tangerine notes appeared up front. Bit of an interesting, honey-like quality as well. Slightly floral. Some mango came through in the center. The beer turned fairly pithy and bitter on the finish and displayed strong notes of grapefruit peel.
Outstanding mouthfeel. The beer contained an incredibly fine, frothy, zippy carbonation and was amazingly plush and creamy. Super smooth and supple on the palate.
I have enjoyed many of Grimm's sour ales and stouts and finally had an opportunity to try one of their highly sought after hoppy beers. Lumen is a super flavorful and fairly complex IPA that drinks all too easily. This is definitely worth trying but, with so many other terrific hoppy beers available in my region, probably would not go to great lengths to seek this out again. 1,494 charactersDamian, Mar 08, 2017

Smells of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, tangerine, faint pineapple, star fruit, citrus hops, melon, floral hops, biscuit, caramel, toasted wheat bread and peppery spices with some coriander. It smells really good and hoppy, but it's a bit softer smelling than most Grimm IPA's with mellow citrus.
Tastes like fruit juice, with a lot of citrus and tropical fruits. Like the nose I got grapefruit, lemon, tangerine, orange peel, pineapple, star fruit, tropical fruit, fresh citrus hops, melon, zesty piney hops, earthy notes and floral hops. The backbone provides everything a good IPA needs with biscuit, tea leaf, light caramel, toast, wheat bread, fresh cut grass, pepper and other spices such as coriander and brown sugar. So many herbs and earthy notes help level out the citrus making this easy to drink and session-able.
Mouthfeel is super smooth with light carbonation, a medium body, light to average bitterness and a semi-dry finish that is sort of tart but in a good way. The zesty citrus fruit completely covers up the ABV. Overall it was really well balanced and tasty, giving a lot of citrus flavor for a regular IPA. Grimm never disappoints, and this was another great offering. 1,513 charactersCHickman, Feb 25, 2017

palate has big grapefruit up front, tangerine orange, peaches, lemon, bready malts, minty grass notes and resinous pine on the finish. mouthfeel is pretty soft and fluffy, although a bit light. overall this is a really nice offering, stoked to have the opportunity to drink this. 592 charactersHyptochrons, Feb 25, 2017

My first Grimm IPA!  Finally.  This is quite unique and really fantastic.  It's nose is just amazing, and while the taste doesn't follow as much, it's a nice combination.  The citrus bursts in the nose, and then the earthiness comes through on the taste.  Some candied orange, white wine (actually I expected this to have some Nelson),  tangerine, mango with a nice and soft, bitter feel. 417 charactersrabbott2, Feb 24, 2017

4.38/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (Jester King stemware, holler at me JK I luh yu). This has a canning date of February 2, 2017 printed  in black ink on the underside of the can, making this beer about two and a half weeks old. It’s been refrigerated for several days since purchase, and I’ve been rolling it around a bit now prior to drinking (as recommended on the can). Can’t wait! 
Appearance (4.5): This pours out about two to two and a half fingers of thick, fluffy, bone-white foam, capping a hazy but not quite cloudy body that’s glowing orange in color. It’s gorgeous. The head dies down fairly slowly, leaving a rocky, pock-marked cap as it goes, with broken collars of sudsy lacing around all sides. As the drink goes on, it leaves thick, wide, nearly unbroken (in places) sheets of thin foam on the far side of the glass, dissipating further down into fat, thick legs and lacing. 
Smell (4.5): Ooooh boy, this is oozing with sticky, somewhat exotic fruit aromas: honeydew, pink guava, a bit of papaya, punchy red grapefruit flesh, and a nice dose of passionfruit all come out, blending with a slightly resinous, dank scent that adds some depth and dimension to the nose. There’s a bit of fairly generic, pale malt coming through, with plain oyster cracker, baking soda biscuit, and flour coming through, but it’s really walloped by the hops—which actually show a lot more of the funky, weedy, dank aroma as it warms, as well as more passion fruit and some white grape. 
Taste (4.25): In contrast to the nose, this is bitter and pithy first and foremost, rather than juicy, sticky, and sweet. Not complaining one bit, though, because the hoppy bitterness is bang-on. Lemon zest, underripe pineapple flesh, green banana, yellow grapefruit flesh, a slightly soapy, herbal bitterness, and a nice, subtle dose of pine sap round out that flavor. There’s a quiet spiciness that raises its head just past the mid-palate, adding a nice, varied dimension to the beer. The malt comes through as a very, very soft, doughy character that’s bready, very pale (no sense of toastiness to speak of), and incredibly smooth. It’s a little starchy, emphasizing the green banana-like flavor in the hop profile, which I don’t mind. But I can’t get over how smooth it is. Toward the finish, the hops come back in for a lemony flash of bitterness, but it’s not astringent or puckering at any point; rather, it’s well-balanced. 
Mouthfeel (4.75): I really am surprised by how smooth and soft this is, given its fairly assertive bitterness. The carbonation is full and fluffy, cruising to reach every corner of your mouth, covering up a pretty much medium-weight, dry but smooth malt body. That body is fairly creamy, with very little starchiness evident at first until the bitter hops flare up with the wash out—and then it melds nicely with that hop profile. Really, though, this is remarkably smooth and creamy, but also bitter and quite dry in the end. Damn. 
Overall (4.25): This is an excellent IPA, and it really excels in most regards. My only notable complaint is that it just doesn’t quite satisfy my lust for juicy, thick, sticky hop flavors. And on that note, it absolutely delivers in the nose. I want to make this clear, though: this is not a knock on the beer itself. This commentary is strictly a reflection of my personal tastes. For example, Magnetic Compass is, so far, my favorite Grimm (D)IPA. But as IPAs go, this beer is damn good, and all of the fundamentals are screaming on point, if you ask me. Definitely recommended. 3,592 charactersfmccormi, Feb 19, 2017

So here goes my first Grimm IPA canned 2/2/17, so 2 weeks old. Isn't as hazy as other NE IPA but has a nice yellow-orange translucent hue. The nose is fantastic with juicy, citrus, tropical. I could just smell the beer all night. Has another layer in there instead of just being a juice bomb which I appreciate. Getting a nice hop scent to go along with the citrus. The complexity of this taste is where I find this NE IPA to shine. Follows the nose, plenty of juicy notes, very well balanced a right amount of hop bite and on the finish is where I really appreciate this candied fruit flavor lingers. Just awesome. Not as creamy as other NE IPAs but not thin or lacking. Solid brew from Grimm, worth seeking out. 850 charactersGambyt20, Feb 17, 2017

A: The beer is a light gold color, with a medium off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains fruity citrus, floral hops and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with strong flavors of citrus and caramel. Then a strong but not over-powering hops bitterness comes in. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is very nice IPA to drink for a long time. 765 charactersTheManiacalOne, Sep 12, 2016

4.69/5  rDev +4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked this up in New York not too long ago, as the "canned on" date on the bottom was 6/17. Of course, I rolled this before opening up today, and thankfully, there wasn't anything on the bottom of this as the hop particles were suspended! Instructions aside, this was a fantastically wonderful beer that outshone nearly every other northeastern IPA that I've recently had, with the hop and juice flavors meshing wonderfully together over an incredibly smooth, slick, and wet mouthfeel.
Really wonderful pour to this as the beer had a glowing, hazy apricot hue to it with a wonderful shine in spite of the translucency present here. Nice, big bubbles in the head that slowly settled down although the lacing wasn't as voluminous as I would have been led to believe. Wonderful aroma of orange, tangerine, mango, and passionfruit with so much more in the taste to augment those flavors. Apricot, stone fruit, nectar, and a smooth and full sweetness underneath that really made this beer shine as the hop profile ensured that this had enough booze, earthy bitterness, resin, and burn to counterbalance everything else that was going on here.
This felt a bit stronger than it was in actuality, because there was so much going on here. Can't say that I can think of a beer that had a better fruit profile to it than this one and a sweetness that didn't feel too overt or forced. As close to nectar as one could find, this was easily Grimm's best offering and worthy enough to stand toe-to-toe with the best from Tree House, Trillium, or any other IPA that tops most lists. Shame I only found one can of this! 1,605 charactersJerzDevl2000, Aug 23, 2016

Growler fill, no date available, but released in mid June so this is roughly 1 month old
Appearance- Pours a bright, deep golden yellow color, very hazy. Finger thick, frothy white colored head, tightly packed bubbles. Lots of spotty head lacing.
Aroma- Bright citrus juices, mostly orange juice, sweet and creamy. Tropical fruit notes of pineapple, mango, papaya. Strawberry kiwi. Zesty, lemony sweetness. A touch of dankness.
Taste- Loads of citrus, orange juice, tangerine, sweeter grapefruit, orange creamsicle, touch of zesty orange peel and lemon. Smooth, juicy pineapple, mango, peach. Bright berry notes, juicy blueberries. Zesty, dank, herbaceous on the finish. 
Feel- Light bodied feel, but very soft, smooth, and creamy. Just a mild zesty bitterness on the finish, but doesnt linger on. Moderate carbonation level.
Overall- Just an excellent IPA. Juiciness on top of juiciness. Citrus comes through the most, but its just wave after wave of citrus and tropical fruit notes, and then a dash of lemon. Has the classic soft mouthfeel. Zestiness of the finish provides a great balance. 1,110 charactersOrangeMen, Jul 17, 2016

Golden, slightly hazy body. Fluffy and frothy head. Looks tasty. I'm drooling already. 
Total pineapple and mango bomb. Prickly with some unripe mango and passionfruit. 
Digging this flavor. Mango and pineapple mingle with a light peppery and floral yeast. Grapefruit pith, orange and tangerine. Just lots of fruit swirling around, especially as it warms. 
Juicy and more juicy. Got an interesting yeast feel and character. Bitterness is very mellow and the body is plentiful enough to satisfy, but light enough to encourage sip after sip.

Moderate haziness, bright lemon yellow in color with a thick, fluffy eggshell white head and lots of carbonation visible streaming up from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma has a lot of tropical complexity.  Papaya, passion fruit, key lime, candied orange, lemon zest, guava, ripe pineapple, peach, mango nectar, honey, lemon cake batter.  Lighter bodied, creamy consistency, very juicy, moderate sweetness, with mild bitterness in the back end.  The taste has mango, papaya, bitter grapefruit, hint of pine, herbal notes, sweet orange, citrus zest, honeydew melon, and clover honey. 603 charactersCzarkazm, Jul 06, 2016

My only complaint with anything Grimm is I wish they made more.  I scramble just to get a few cans.  Not the up front hop bomb of some IPA's but tasty throughout. 277 charactersnjcraftguy, Jul 05, 2016

Appearance: hazy electric gold with a nice fluffy white head; super hazy
Nose: crazy tropical, pineapple, mango, citrus, tangerine, mild bitterness, orange peel, fresh squeezed citrus, peach, apricot, other stone fruit, crazy juicy
Taste: follows the nose perfectly with the addition of some residual sweetness and super juicy. Tropical, mango, pineapple, orange, juicy, Juicy Fruit Gum, very mild bitterness.
Overall: This one is is the best IPA I have ever had. Truly a masterpiece. This is only the second beer I've ever given a 5/5 to. I must have more Grimm IPAs in my life. 623 charactersClavisAurea, Jul 01, 2016
4.73/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7516oz can into a NEBCO chalice.
Appearance: Fully hazed orange/yellow with a longlasting frothy white head and sweeping lacing.
Smell: Guava, Citra-smokiness, lime, some sweet stonefruit.  Bright and inviting.  Mildly pungent but not dank.  As usual with Grimm, more succulent citrus mixed with berries and flowers than greenhouse/marijuana.  Smells awesome.  Melon, some banana.  Every time I bring the cup to my lips and pick up the scent, I'm taken aback by the strong, well-integrated aroma--it's like the various hops coalesce into some kind of mega citrus fruit, characterized by lime, banana, and melon.  
Taste: Follows the nose, big hit of banana-tinged melon, big Citra lime, same Citra smokiness that I think I first noticed in NEBCO Fuzzy Baby Ducks and am always happy to find in Citra beers.  Fruity and soft, VERY juicy, with an ever changing chorus of berry and citrus notes.  Some grainy pale malt in the finish, welcome.
The taste is excellent.  Maybe not as "world class" as the aroma, but that's very nitpicky/subjective.  Definitely without any off flavor whatsoever.  Could be a touch more bitter for my taste, though I get the whole "Northeast style 100% late hopping" thing.  This is a beer made by and for people who like Heady Topper, no doubt.  
Mouthfeel: medium bodied, low side of moderate carbonation, semi-dry finish.  Honestly, I consider the carbonation level and the not-dry-enough-ness to be flaws, but it's *so* satisfyingly juicy that it gets enough extra credit to push the minuses back up to a 4.75.  This juiciness is just perfect with this particular flavor and beautiful aroma; it really makes the beer sing.
Overall: Grimm just keeps getting better and better.  My only complaint is that there are still more 4 packs at the place I got this, and they cost $20 each.  How am I not supposed to stock up on this? 1,858 charactersPahn, Jul 01, 2016

4/4.5/4.5/4.25/4.5
Hazy clear yellow. 
Bursting with tangerine and clementine and sweet citrus. Very strong. 
Really tasty! The tangerine lingers, and it's almost orange juice levels of citrus, mixed with pleasant, herbal bitterness. Long taste, great punch, really lovely orange-forward IPA. 
Grimm makes great stuff. If this beer is a bit one-dimensional, it's not any less good. 439 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 12, 2016

Appearance:  A two finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy pale orange with good clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Tropical, spicy, herbal, lemon, citrus, and grassy hops followed by bready, caramel, and biscuity malts.  Spells juicy snd delicious 
Taste:  Not only is this juicy and delicious, this is balance to this beer.  Hop forward juiciness, but a nice malt bill to balance things out.  Light chewy and bitterness in the rear too. 
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium bodied, medium carbonation, light bitterness, a little chewy, somewhat crushable, and delicious.
Overall:  So happy to have enjoyed a few glasses of this beer.  Looking forward to the next bottle or draft. 847 charactersFlounder57, Feb 04, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a hazy golden color with a huge, pillowy, bright white head. There is a full finger of retention that sticks around for the entire beer and some spotted lacing. The smell is bursting with tropical and citrus fruits. Most notably pineapple, grapefruit, mango, peach, melon and a good bit of dankness. Taste is similar, but the grapefruit really stands out more so than in the smell. Feel is light, very soft and pillowy. Overall another outstanding beer from Grimm. Just below Pulse Wave as my favorite from Grim, but this is damn close. 552 charactersCNoj012, Jan 31, 2016

O: Another great IPA from Grimm. To me the grapefruit stands up boldly - the beer is a bit one note, but it is an extremely pleasurable grapefruit essence. Grimm is making some incredible beers, especially in the soft and citrusy IPA category, and Lumen is another standout for sure. 562 charactersFireman_RK, Jan 31, 2016

Foggy golden yellow glow under a small white head that deposits patchy lacing on the glass.  Smells fresh and fruity…oranges, mangoes, limes, grass, and a bit of grape.  The El Dorado seems to be contributing a watermelon-like note as well.  Flavor is hoppy: juicy orange and lemon citrus, not super tropical or sweet, though mangoes and peaches are there.  Interestingly, it’s the Equinox that seems to add a little extra character to the taste with some peppery greenness that mixes well with the bitterness.  Slight leafy, floral edge.  Soft medium body with a dry finish.  A satisfying IPA that delivers more sharpness than expected, which is fine.  Quality hop burps…
Update: Newer batch seems to have more Citra and less of the Equinox and El Dorado - an improvement, in my opinion.  Juicy fresh, bright hop flavor.  Aroma seems mellow at first, but opens up to feature some nice passion fruit, mango, and oily hop resins.  Really good stuff. 973 characterswedge, Jan 27, 2016

The beer comes in a medium to deep gold color, glowing out of the glass with a medium plus haze with a fluffy off white head.
The aroma offers passionfruit, papaya, sticky mango, dried tangerine peel, tangy tangerine, a light breadiness.
The flavor follows with tons of orange and tangerine peel, passionfruit, pineapple, underipe mango, a chewy breadiness and medium soft mouthfeel in the middle, onto a dank and dry finish. Soft bitterness. 
Another out of this world IPA from Grimm.
(Batch 1)
The beer comes in a deep gold color.
The aroma pops of passion fruit, white grape, strawberry candy, sweet clementines.
The flavor follows with that initial rush of passion fruit, melon, pineapple, a bit of malty sweetness, but then onto a good amount of Equinox with pine and green herbs with a some light lingering bitterness. 
This one hits at a blend of Afterimage and Pulse Wave. 915 charactersdar482, Jan 20, 2016

This one pours a hazy glowing orange, with a small head, and a ton of lacing.
Smells like orange, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, and melon. Super aromatic.
This is another great Grimm IPA. It's cool to see that they can nail a single IPA as well- all their previous hoppy beers were DIPAs. It's so soft and pilllowy, with billowing citrus, tons of orange, melon, mango, pineapple, with a very slight pine bite on the end to remind you it's an IPA and not fruit juice. I'm lovin' it.
This is light bodied, but not thin, with a crisp and super juicy mouthfeel, and a normal level of carbonation.
Grimm is fishing with dynamite here, they just can't miss. 705 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 16, 2016

This one is like cloud busting IPA but not as belgiany.  Excellent complexity of fruit and airy hops.  This one is extremely crushable and has a softer finish than some of the other Grimm IPAs. Grimm is really using the best ingredients these days making some high quality new england style IPAs. Get some if you can. 383 characterspalma, Jan 15, 2016
