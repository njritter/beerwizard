4.21/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A gift from @SomethingClever – thanks Dave!
Bottled 4/17/17.  Stored at 42 degrees.  Served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Aroma – citrus – mostly grapefruit with some piney notes.
Head large (Maximum 6.8 cm, aggressive pour), white, low density froth, average retention, diminishing to an irregular two to five mm ring with widely scattered lacing about the glass.  A rocky partial layer is present.
Lacing – fair.  Initial long wisps of lacing as the head retracts followed by wide partial rings of tiny to small bubbles as the beer level drops.
Body – medium yellow, clear.
Flavor – begins moderately bitter with grapefruit flavors.  As it warms, a little malt comes through.  (Allowing it to warm in my mouth banishes the grapefruit and it becomes a weak malt drink, so not a good idea.) Aftertaste is bitter with a good hang time. 
Palate – medium, watery, lively carbonation.
A very drinkable DIPA that won’t destroy your taste buds.  This one was fresh – I could easily drink a bunch of them.

S: pine and citrus

F: A tad thin, but easy drinking

A: Golden yellow with a thick finger of foam.  The head remained throughout.  Great lacing 
S: Piney with grapefruit tangerine and candied fruit aromas
T: a fine base of resiney pine with grapefruit rind, peach and green apple
MF: Crisp and dry. Just resiney enough to coat ones mouth.  Would never now it was 8.3%
O: About as good as it gets.  If you are looking for a hazy glass of o.j. look elsewhere.  If you want an incredibly well made DIPA in the classic Pliny style this is about as good as it gets. 550 charactersSammyJaxxxx, Apr 10, 2017

L:  Pours bright light golden with finger of medium density white head that had moderate retention and left spotted lacing.
S:  Not overly dynamic but had very pine and tropical prominence with citrus undertones. Perhaps some floral notes too.  Loved the nose,  just wanted it more prominent,  possibly due to age and travel. Tropical aspects faded as it warmed.
T:  Delicious, balances all the nose attributes well, pine, tropical, and floral lead,  citrus in tow.  Loved it!   Finishes very light,  moderate bitterness and a hint of astringency,  clean...nothing lingers. 
F:  Light bodied,  carbonation on the higher side.   Very light for the ABV.
O:  Great DIPA, would buy it fresh every chance I'd get if in my distro. Hope to get it fresh again,  great DIPA! 803 charactersjakecattleco, Apr 01, 2017

Smell is potent hops!  Citrus and pine, some nice caramel malts.
Taste follows, not surprisingly, to a beautiful combination of piney and fruity hops and nice caramel malt.
Mouthfeel is quite nice, light but substantial.
Excellent DIPA that hides its abv quite nice. 401 charactersJosholson666, Mar 17, 2017

A: The beer is a light gold color with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains fruity citrus, floral hops and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with sweet flavors of citrus and caramel that are quickly followed by a strong but not over-powering floral hops bitterness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.
O: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid 2IPA to drink for a long time. 845 charactersTheManiacalOne, Mar 11, 2017

Pours a golden orange with good sized head that leaves plenty of sticky lace.  Nose is quite dank with some citrus, but is not nearly as big as you'd expect from such a highly rated beer.  Taste is somewhat malty, with some sweetness, along with some solid hop flavor and balancing bitterness.  Well rounded and doesn't try to just be a bitter hop bomb.  Overall, very good, but would have liked to see the hops pop more on the nose. 484 characterscaptaincoffee, Feb 26, 2017

3/5  rDev -32.4%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Thanks to nollie77 for this extra, knocking a long-time beer off my wants list. That’s old school trading there. 12 oz. bottle all to myself. 
The pour looks IPA light, sunshine yellow. Smells like citrus & oranges & rock sugar. 
Bodhi - I seek to understand the true nature of this beer (sans all the unnecessary suffering). This is a thick IIPA enough residual sugar to make me twitch. Even more. Rock sugar, raw sugar, pour some sugar on me (which might be the worst song ever conceived), before I get to something that might resemble an IPA. When the hops finally show, they’re dank, resinous, herbal, with mild bitterness & full o’ scallions. Don’t kiss a girl after imbibing this and/or brushing your teeth. One of these is plenty. 
WFT? Columbus IPA is wonderful & I’ve been looking forward to this one, but I feel like I just listened to the fourth Eve 6 album. Mediocre & a big letdown from expectations. 926 charactersmaximum12, Feb 19, 2017

Look: semi-clear golden hue with a thick bubbly white head.
Aroma: It has a wonderful slightly piney citrus aroma.
Taste: tropical fruits, I think mango, pineapple, orange, ending in a piney grapefruit bitterness, and its dank and juicy.
Feel: Medium body, dry, smooth. It is light and crisp. 392 charactersThomas_Wikman, Dec 02, 2016

A- Pours a light amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- Floral, citrusy hop aroma with notes of orange, lemon and grapefruit.
T- Concentrated punch of hop flavor and assertive bitterness with a touch of malt backing which provides a tad bit of sweetness.  Alcohol is pretty well hidden and the citrus character is well balanced with the resiny bitterness.
M- Quite sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side. 
O- Glad I finally got to try this.  I'd call this a classic representation of a west coast style DIPA that packs a wallop of flavor.  Very tasty and super drinkable. 847 charactersImmortale25, Dec 02, 2016

I know I am going to get roasted for saying this but I really felt it is better about 2-3 weeks after bottling than super fresh. The hops are just so edgy that I like it rounded out a bit.

Pours a slightly hazy bright orange and with a caramel hue; two finger thick pulpy white head with good retention and tons of lacing. Smells of grapefruit, citrus, light danky resin, cereal grain and caramel sweetness, orange peel. Very nice balance with a fair amount of grapefruit hop aromas, and I suppose a bit of cat pissiness that detracts slightly. Flavour however contains no danky cattiness; it is full of grapefruit and orange peel with a moderate caramel sweetness that provides nice balance without being overly sweet; moderate resinous bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, substantial without being sticky or too sweet, good resinous bitterness on the finish. A classic that I've finally been able to sample and enjoy. 804 charactersStevedore, Oct 26, 2016

The smell hits you immediately with strong hoppy citrus.  Closer examination shows pineapple, orange, grapefruit, and a piney bitterness under it all.  An outstanding smell.
The taste is immediate citrus, orange, pineapple, bitter pine, and a strong lingering bitter hop finish. The west coast pine seems to dominate the flavor while the citrus dominated the nose.  There is no hint of the alcohol.
Mouthfeel is heavy carbonation but smooth.  No oily feeling.  The aftertaste sticks with you for a time.
Overall, this beer is phenomenal.  The smell is just about perfect.  It's very easy to drink.  The only thing that brings the score down slightly for me is the overpowering aftertaste.  That's more of a personal preference though.  This would be a go-to DIPA for me, if I had access to it. 996 charactersjvgoor3786, Oct 10, 2016

Mango and  other citrus right up front, hop-heavy in a very good way yet balanced and  powerful.  I had two - one with dinner and one about 3 hours later.  The latter formulates the score of this review, as it's just to hoppy to have with food and get full enjoyment out of it(live & learn).  A remarkable DIPA.  I was lucky to find this in a Columbus grocery store, and one of the store employees told me that it was starting to show up in force across the city. 514 charactersowenwood, Oct 08, 2016

SMELL: Gargantuan waves of mangos, papayas, peaches, and apricots are suitably supported by strong aromas of oranges, grapefruit, and tangerines. Subtle scents of pine, white bread, caramel, and alcohol offer a delightful balance to the massive fruitiness.
4.75 out of 5
TASTE: An intense explosion of mangos, peaches, apricots, and papayas initially strikes the palate. A flood of strong orange, tangerine, and grapefruit flavors along with with mild flavors of pine quickly flow in and expand the already massive hop profile. A malty balance soon establishes as mild flavors of caramel and subtle flavors of white bread commingle with the hoppy goodness. A mild hop bitterness and subtle alcoholic flavor finish off the symphony of taste as all prior flavors maintain.
4.5
NOTE: This was as amazing as I had expected it to be. The tropical fruit flavors that I love in IPAs remained dominant from the first sip until the last. The supporting citrus and piney hop flavors were present in just the right quantities and offered a wonderful hop balance. I thought the bitterness was too high and the not thing that prevented me from appreciating this even more. 1,311 charactersMyotus, Sep 27, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally got my hands on two four packs of these recently released C.B.C. Bodhi's out of the three that where available on the shelf. I have been drinking this beer for two years or so hear and there on tap throughout the Columbus area's craft brew inclined restaurant's. This beer is a Midwestern take on a west coast style double IPA from Columbus brewing company in Ohio. Poured out of a twelve ounce bottle, bottled on 07-21-16 so it's been three weeks or so since the vat. It pours a very pale color for a double, almost pale ale yellow with a slighter gold or bronze tint with barely a one inch head. On the nose it smells of grapefruit, pineapple, and a hint of lemon maybe which seems unique. It must be dry hopped as well considering the smell is a very pungent dominating west coast variety of hops that resemble pure pine on top of the citrus notes. It tastes as if the at this point, now obvious dry hopped process makes my mouth water beginning in the tonsil or throat area followed by a rush of bitter hops, citrus, definitely lemony note, and then a very slight warm alcohol taste that is nearly non existent having been covered up by the marvelous combination of citrusy fruit and piney hops. This beer is one of the finest double's I have ever had and I think it may be due to the relatively low abv for a beer of the double IPA style but it is nonetheless a world class double IPA. Columbus brewing company's beers tend to be low in comparison to others regarding abv anyway but all are quite amazing examples of American brewing. This is the best Columbus brewing company beer I have personally ever had and at least a top five, maybe top three double IPA's I can personally get my hands on in the Columbus, Ohio area. Fantastic, world class beer here. 1,770 charactersWyattFrench64, Aug 10, 2016

A: Hazy (but not remotely cloudy by today's standards) bright gold-orange body under a finger of creamy off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Attractive.
S: Pure, intense dank grapefruit hoppiness. Simple, straightforward, and excellent.
T: Citrus rind (both lemon and orange) up front, followed immediately by bitter grapefruit pith. The bitterness grows toward the back end, overwhelming the modest hint of biscuity malt that briefly attempts to make its presence felt. Grassy, herbal, astringent grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Nothing but astringency on the aftertaste. I appreciate the old-school focus on hops throughout - including bittering hops - but this is more than a bit unbalanced. Still, the front end deliciousness earns it a solid mark.
M: Creamy, soft, lively. Light resinous stickiness. Excellent DIPA body for sure.
O: Enjoyable beer, but not one I'll be quick to think of when remembering my favorite hop bombs.

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice crystal clear golden hue with a thin white head that fades to leave light wisps and a light halo.
S - Aromas of light caramel, light pine and earthy spicy. Little malt sweetness. No real booze. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, fair amount of malts, nice grapefruit, rather pine and spicy, some caramel, rather generic bitterness.
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, not really boozy. 
O - Overall this was a rather average dipa. Rather mosaic forward I think. Not boozy. Shocked.

Light fizzy head, slight hazy golden straw color.
Nose pine sap little tropical dank resin, oniony, mild citrus juice, grassy earthy, fruity, little malt. 
Taste brings big sweet candy cracker dough, candy syrup, hint of booze, big spicy earthy hop, grassy, pine sap, little oniony again, resin, mild tropical citrus fruit but not much, little minty on the background, bit herbal, big bitterness, herbal bitter spicy chewy hop extract thing finish.
Mouth is med to heavier bod, decent carb, bit syrupy, little booze warmth.
Overall not very good, poor choice of hops, and poor execution. 609 charactersjlindros, Jul 28, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bottle (from the 7/16 release) into a tulip at fridge temp.
Look: light orange, not quite perfectly clear, with a nice persistent sudsy offwhite head.
Smell: mild spice, orange pith, lavender, oak.
Taste: an almost rye-like spice, with lots of floral notes, and hints of orange peel, pine, nutmeg/clove/banana. Starts off pretty delicate and subtle, but the flavor really gets robust and rich in the middle. Pretty good balance between sweet and bitter. No hint of alcohol.
Feel: medium body, fluffy, and quite dry.
Overall: a very good beer. Not especially better than the best from Stone, or Saint Archer, or Modern Times... but quite good, nonetheless. 660 charactersneurobot01, Jul 23, 2016

Regal white lathery head sitting on top this hazy golden beer.   Nose is grapefruit,  bitter and a little sweet.  Taste is near perfect for a DIPA as it exhibits equal parts grapefruit, maybe mango? alcohol presence and sweet malt.  Pretty full bodied with a pretty quick,  dry exit.  Bitterness and saccharin sweetness linger on the tongue.  Very much worth all the run it gets. 457 charactersgopens44, Jun 03, 2016

Fuck me, that's a delicious DIPA. The balance and intensity of flavors is insane. Very sweet, juicy hops, coupled with some biter, dank hops, a little bit of "Hey, this is a DIPA" alcohol warmth... so tasty, so balanced, so good. DIPA's have a tendency (in my experience) to be on the bitter side or the sweet side, and this is right in the middle. So fresh and bursting and damn good. The malt sweetness and juicier hops are just enough against the drying, bitter hops... finish is clean, a little dry, a little wet... I don't even know anymore. All I know is that this is one of the best DIPAs I've ahd in quite a long while. 666 charactersSerialTicker, May 24, 2016

Floral aromas of dank, sticky green, slightly skunky cannabic hops abound. This stoner bouquet is enhanced with the accompaniment of a fruity, munchie-inducing aroma of Trix cereal.
Flavors are really very close to the smell, but a little more piney and citrusy. 329 charactersSabtos, May 06, 2016

Thin to medium mouthfeel, soft and slippery.  Excellent IPA, glad I finally got to try it. 377 charactersNolaHopHead, Apr 23, 2016

It's not a fruit bomb but plenty of fruit flavor balanced by a hoppy finish. Mouth feel is exceptional with very pleasant carbonation. This was a growler right from the brewery so exceptionally fresh. Drink local, drink fresh! 334 charactersBierRunner, Apr 10, 2016

Look: Golden, hint of yellow brightening it up a bit, mostly clear, just a slight hoppy haze.  Foamy white head quickly settles into thin cap and ring around the glass.  Lacing for days clings effortlessly to the side of the glass as I sip and ponder.
Smell: Instant big wave of hoppy goodness the second I uncap the Growler.  Bold and forward aroma, spicy hops, earthy, dank.  A bit of sweetness comes through balancing all the earthy scents into one mouthwatering whiff.
Taste: Definitely following the nose, big earthy hops up front, pine, spice, floral, hint of citrus zest.  Not juicy, big and bold earthy hop flavors.  Dankness and desire would be two words I would use if I was only allowed to use two words.
Feel: A rich mouthfeel, you can tell your drinking a bold brew.  Not heavy like a stout, but not at all light on the tongue.  Moderate carbonation.
Overall: This has been one I have been trying to get my hands on for a while, I had really high expectations, and it met them, actually above and beyond them.  Often I am underwhelmed by the highly rated IPA's I get from afar, but this brew was worth the wait.  One of my local favorites is Second Fiddle, it is different than almost all of the big east coast hoppy brews with an original hop profile.  This is very similar, and fits my flavor needs perfectly.. 1,428 charactersjhavs, Apr 03, 2016

Nose is sweet and juicy and inviting. Honey sweet and floral and... I don't even know I can't even completely corner all of it, but it is professional and lush and engaging and incredible. 
Flavour follows much of the same notes: sweet floral hops juicy citrus and tropical honey dipped deliciousness. A light bitterness to finish, but damn 
A little thinner than I would prefer/expect but overall... man this has an impeccable reputation for a reason.

4.37/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Living in Dayton, OH currently, I had the pleasure of driving over to Columbus this Saturday and thought it would be a great opportunity to fill my Howler with Columbus Brewing Company's Bodhi DIPA.  This was the second time I visited the brewery, having tried their standard IPA on the first visit.  I didn't chance drinking the Bodhi the first time, given it's 8.5% ABV; an hour drive back to Dayton can get a bit monotonous and didn't want to doze off.  So I brought my howler with me this time and I'm glad I did, even though I had to wait until arriving home before trying...it was worth it!
As soon as I open the door to home, I hung up my jacket (cold today in OH), and reached for my pint glass...
(A)ppearance takes on a clear golden color, so clear I could read this review through the glass.  Not hazy in the least.  And thinking it would be a bit flat, I was pleasantly surprised by the thin head that lingered after the pour leaving a slight lace.
(M)outh feel was a bit thin, just a medium body (not to be taken as a negative...thick body beers should be more for brown ales or stouts or porters.)
(S)mell developed as a strong floral, hinting at the beer's 93 IBU's before tipping the glass for the first mouthful.
(T)aste came in strong...pine tree bitterness, leaving a good burn on the throat, but quickly dissipating the more you drink.  This would go well with a nice burger or other meaty item to cut through the hoppy bitterness...or a nice piece of Winan's chocolate!
(O)verall a nice DIPA, strong hoppy taste not for those who prefer lagers or even pale ales.  I would love to have some to take home in a bottle to save (had to finish the howler in one sitting, not wanting to risk losing carbonation), but respect the idea that it is only sold on tap.  Draft beer is the best way to enjoy a beer and I think this one would lose some of its character if taken from bottle or can.  A great DIPA, enjoy! 1,927 charactersNamabiru, Mar 19, 2016

Lorna Morgan wearing a sheer gold bra. Next. Snow white head that projects across the glass like a lie detector recipient who's telling the truth. Spotty lacing throughout the glass. In the nose I get a mixture of honeydew, orange peel, faint clove and tobacco leaf. A slight breeze blowing through fresh manicured lawns on a spring afternoon. The taste is where this beer really excels. It's an exceptional balance between citrus, herbaceous and bitter. The feel is clean, and it gives me just enough tongue smack on the finish to make me say 'larrrrrrrrrrrrrge.' Columbus Brewing has something special right here. Give me more, please. 742 charactersTheIPAHunter, Dec 17, 2015

a: Crystal clear, gold body. One finger white head stands for a bit before subsiding.
s: Huge wafts of allium and pine. Spicy, fresh chives, citrus rind, grassy compost, with modest caramel malt.
t: A sweet malt backbone holds up huge layered hop flavor. Piney, a good amount of dankness, grapefruit and spicy, green allium finish.
mf: Medium bodied with good carbonation. Slight resiny feel. Spicy, dry finish.
o: Wow. What a beer. This seems to be going in the opposite direction of the current trend with IPAs in that it is supper refined. And tastes and feels like a beer. 615 charactersPatrickCT, Dec 16, 2015

At first whiff I could tell this was going to be a petty good brew.. reminded me a lot of the way TG brews smell... kind of a light malt that I anticipate to be dry.. along with a pretty strong and floral hop odor.. now I am thirsty!
Tastes very loyal to the nose. Dry, hoppy, and mildly sweet. A very mild brew for the ABV and very mild for a double IPA IMO.
overall a really good beer .. polished off the growler easily in one sitting. 551 charactersJosh012012, Nov 22, 2015

Full pint(s) served in a tulip glass – 05/17/2015
A:  Like some mystical golden elixir.  Pure, clear, and burnished.  Half finger of foamy paper white suds over top.  Nice retention efforts noted along with a few solid streaks and patches of sticky lace left clinging to the glass.  
S:  A virtual Citra assault on the olfactory.   Pink grapefruit with a pungent pine and herb note and spikes of gooseberry jam.  Smells super fresh and brightly hopped with loads of sugary citrus fruit to this one. Some sweet caramel malts underneath but this is most all about the hops.  Real solid with the aromatics.  
T:  Big zesty blast of Citra flavor conveying an aggressive hop bitter approach.  This really has some truly awesome Citra zing to it and quite possibly a little catty Simcoe thrown in.  I get a heavy emphasis on the Citrus zest, mainly grapefruit, with some fresh gooseberry and sticky evergreens.  Super resinous with some constricting linger and a touch of alcohol warmth in the finish.  Something mildly herbal and spiced as a little caramel malt surfaces to an otherwise unobtrusive malt bill.  Outstanding brew, well balanced for such a hop monster and it’s just super crush.
M:  Moderate to light moderate body with an upper amount of perceived bitterness.  Draws into a dryer finish with a light alcohol warmth and great resinous coating on the palate.   
D:  A truly great DIPA.  What a magical find here in SoCal.  I think I liked this a tad better than Kern River’s Citra which is speaking volumes.  Has a touch lighter mouthfeel however they are very similar to one another. 1,653 charactersNugganooch, Oct 23, 2015

4.43/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Darker brew than I expected: we often call bright yellow colors "gold," but this is more the color of actual gold. Topped by a good size snow white head with very good retention. Tons of carbonation flying up the center and edges of the glass. Basically transparent brew.
Super fresh, citrusy, juicy aroma. I immediately think grapefruit pulp, but that is followed quickly by pineapple and mango flavors. Definitely a touch of dank grassiness. Grainy pale malts upon very close inspection.
Flavor follows, with one key qualifier: more. More dankness and more malt than in the aroma. Not quite as juicy, however. There's a bit of juicy grapefruit on the end, and just a touch of grapefruit peel.
Really tough to judge the bitterness. I initially felt that the bitterness was quite low, but the more I drink, the more it really becomes strong and clear, finishing surprisingly bitter and dry.
Very drinkable; it takes at least half the beer to really start to notice any alcohol on the palate.
This is an excellent brew that really applies new school dry hopping levels and hop varietals with an old school level of bitterness and dryness. In that way, it's very similar to many of Stone's better (D)IPAs. Profile wise, it's similar to Sip of Sunshine, albeit cleaner, dryer, and more bitter. I can't say this is my favorite (D)IPA, based on my personal hop varietal preference, but I can definitely see why so many people love it. It is a beer with few faults. 1,464 charactersRoguer, Sep 18, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle served in a tulip.
From the bottle, aromas of lemon, lime, tangerine peel, and faint pine.  Definitely a lighter citrus nose than many competing DIPAs.  Pours a surprisingly pale and surprisingly clear yellow, with a barely 1-finger head receding to leave respectable lacing.  The palate opens crisply with a more lemon-dominant note than the nose, and develops into a more pine hop background than the citrusy nose would lead one to expect.  The light, dry hop profile lends an almost ginger-ale-like element to the beer.  The beer is crisp and dry and the mouthfeel is a real standout.
I'm revising this beer down after trying it more thoroughly in a couple bottles.  I was extremely impressed (and caught up in the hype) when I first reviewed it on tap, but a more sober (forgive the brew-pun) look places this beer lower down in my estimation of great Double IPAs.  It doesn't have the savory dankness of some true titans of the style, and shoots instead for a more unique take on the west-coast double.  It succeeds to some degree in this regard, particularly in its tremendously well-crafted mouthfeel, but the palate leaves a little something to be desired.  There's not as much texture to the palate as I would expect from such a well-liked beer, and while it is supremely drinkable, upon more meticulous dissection, it lags behind the world-class DIPA competition. 1,387 charactersLAp, Sep 13, 2015

Pours a clear golden body with a gushing foamy white head that reduces slowly after 15 min or so to leave heavy lacing and retention.
Aromas are out of this world .  Fresh grapefruit and citrus, bursting tropical fruit and pine in the background.
The tongue matches the nose.. Crisp citrus and grapefruit, pineapple, followed by zesty peppery resin and pine, slight bitter aftertaste but not much. Easy drinker. Crisp and smooth. ABV is very well hidden. Medium carbonation.

Not sure how widely available this is, but definitely not to be missed if you're ever in central Ohio. 324 charactersdcotom, Jul 29, 2015

Aroma is big time piney, resinous, dank hops with just a hint of tropical citrus and pineapple.  The flavor highlights a veritable plethora of bright fresh citrus, dank herb, pine, floral, and resin notes.  An incredibly tasty double IPA with a ton of rewarding flavor and really no hint of the alcohol.  Sweet neutral slightly toasty caramel grain notes provide a base for a hop explosion.  Medium to full bodied with a spot on level of carbonation and crisp finish.  Simply put, an incredible imperial IPA with flavor for days.  This is one I would always come back to.  Thanks to Jess and Karla for bringing the growler, this pretty much stole the show and was the first beer opened. 810 charactersStinkypuss, May 27, 2015

A: pours a bright gold, 1/8 inch white head. Little to no visible carb. [a few steady streams, slightly hazy, excellent lacing.]
S: redolent with grapefruit pith, resin, nondescript tropical goodness. [Decidedly tropical and Resiny; strong mango, papaya, something floral - like lilies perhaps.]
T: slightly sweet arrival, turns immediately clean, then blast of fruity, tropical astringency. [Stoll true, but the astringency is not overpowering; I wouldn't put this past 60 IBUs, tops]. Some lingering grapefruit pith on the finish.
M: light, lifting, crisp. Lovely. [Really just excellent; lighter side of midweight, low to moderate carb, extremely clean finish.]
O: the most West-coast IPA I've had from Ohio. Bottle this, and I will have it in my fridge always. [Promise will be kept, if I can find it! Managed to snag a single; 4-pack next time!] 934 charactersSaltofOH, May 23, 2015

Too many more good Beresford have here tonight, but if you are a hop head, you will love this. Only bad thing about it is that each sip leaves a mild dry bitterness that makes you absolutely want another taste. Dangerously smashable for 8.5% :) 268 charactersKain05, Apr 21, 2015

It pours from my growler into a pretty IPA glass with a near perfect yellow with loads of head. The head dies quickly to leave a decent head. The aroma is strong and hoppy. Floral but not too much so. Sublime.
The taste is a perfect balance. It has loads of malt balancing a not too heavy (but judicious) hops load. The aftertaste is bitter but easy to take.
This is a great double IPA. 603 charactersschoolboy, Mar 26, 2015

My first thought was 'damn, this tastes like Heady Topper.' But it's not a clone, this IPA is a little drier and thinner in the body — more West Coast where Heady is rich and smooth. Anyways, it's giant floral grapefruit with pine and a biting bitter that's incredibly bright and blindingly fresh. A fantastic hop bomb if you can find it. 453 characterstempest, Mar 05, 2015

Nice look to it; barely hazed gold. Flavor has full, sweet hops with some clear pine that isn't overly obnoxious or abrasive. Smooth is the word here. It's really amazing (and great!) that smooth IPAs and DIPAs are the new rage. So pleasant and easy to drink. 452 charactersRblWthACoz, Mar 01, 2015

Light golden hue. Moderate pour produces a one finger head.
Admittedly I get very little off the nose. Some sweet fruit. Little pine. I'm a little concerned.
Taste allays my worry. Bold taste. Nice balance of tropical fruit and pine followed but big hop bitterness mid palette. The finish however has plenty of malt and just enough sweet to balance this off perfectly. This is extremely drinkable and at 8% it's almost scary.
This was worth seeking out. Well done. 556 charactersZaximus, Jan 31, 2015

From start to finish this is an homage to sweet juicy, sticky tropical hops with lots of fresh ripe fruit and balancing hints of pine and grapefruit rind.  Easy drinking considering the ABV and just enjoyable.  I cannot wait till it is bottled or canned! 369 charactersmtomlins, Dec 31, 2014

Dark yellow/orange body.  Burnt orange.  Sugar, pine, and resin aroma.  Sweet/rich/bitter pineapple taste with a sweet, subdued, peachy, background.  Way in the back.  Candied, subdued fruit, flowery, in that order.  Sharp finish.  Dense carbonation in the mouth.  Chewy.  Smooth, no aftertaste, clean.  
Overall...I would put this up there against many of the great DIPAs, such as Pliny the Elder (PtE), Abrasive, Hopslam, and Heady Topper.  I think it is PtE's half-brother.  This DIPA is great!

Growler fill ($14) from my local bottle shop (Bottles 101 in Kent,OH).
L - Fantastic, golden hue. Soapy lacing.
S - Piney, not overpowering.
T - Smooth and not too heavy.
F - Resin, but again not over the top.
O - Just a fantastic DIPA that doesn't feel or taste like a DIPA. Clean & smooth, not bitter, not too heavy.
It's absolutely criminal that Columbus doesn't bottle this. I know they're planning to do so. It will fly off the shelves in Ohio. I could live the rest of my days drinking this, Head Hunter and White Rajah. 608 characterschrisbues, Dec 23, 2014

A lot going on with the aroma: dank/resin, mango, pineapple, mandarin orange and some pine for good measure.  The taste is not as fruity as might be expected from the smell but it's still fruity/East Coast up front, followed by bitter, hoppy, PUNCH! to the tastebuds as it goes down.  The alcohol is not very apparent and the aftertaste is smooth and clean.  Mouthfeel is fine if unremarkable: smooth, medium bodied and medium carbonation.
Suggested food pairing: New York style pepperoni pizza
If you like this beer then you should also try: Let's keep it in C-bus and say Howling Moon
Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) My biggest gripe with this beer is that they don't put it in cans.  If this were in cans and could get some distribution via the normal channels or just beer trading, Bodhi would be regarded right up there with the most highly sought IPAs.  Plus, I think that design would make for a cool looking can...but I digress.  Great, big, complex flavors and great balance.  Super drinkable.  May be tough to get a hold of if you're not in Columbus, but if you can get some it's worth the effort. 1,227 charactersSHDoyle, Dec 14, 2014

Head is short and off white poured from a growler.  Orange rind and flowery resin dominate the nose.  The body is bright and full of citrus as it enters the mouth with first sip.  The body is very vibrant for any style, especially an IPA.  Crisp, sharp, and electric in character and absolutely delicious in every way.  I could drink this brew every day.  This beer is the real thing.  I really hope they start packaging this beer for distribution. 563 charactersSPLITGRIN, Nov 25, 2014

One of the most amazing beers I have ever had... This DIPA is crisp, dry, dank beyond belief also has a subtle sweetness that isnt overwhelming or assertive, massive pine and citrus (Tones of Lemon, Grapefruit and Orange) Also has lots green, grassy earth tones. While the taste is certainly impressive, what's really amazing is how well the ABV is hidden, It's an 8% that drinks like 5.5% or less. I have had a few big dog IPA's (Heady, Pliny, Z-Dust, Double Citra) I would easily put this up against those any day of the week. Truly world class in every regard~ 736 charactersClePaul, Nov 15, 2014

A beautiful golden yellow with a little head, the nose and taste are very citrusy. Extremely easy to drink, I almost forgot I had a beer in my hand and not a smoothie. 348 charactersBeef_Curtains, Oct 30, 2014

Pours a mainly clear golden yellow, with a bright white fluffy head. Decent amout of lacing. 
Smells pretty hoppy. Lots of floral and pine, with a touch of citrus and medicinal aromas. Kind of has a rock candy sweetness. Not a lot of malt noticeable.
An initial sweetness, with a honey malt that provides a very light base for the hops to explode out of. The citrus punches you in the mouth right of the bat. Pineapple and a passion fruit.  A lot more tropical fruit flavor then you would guess from the aroma. It is followed up with a wave of pine and floral bouquet flavors. Fairly green and dank, without being too medicinal, and very crisp and clean in the finish. This is a hop bomb under control if that makes sense. 
 A moderate amount of resin feel. It is medium bodied, with just the right amount of carbonation. No alcohol in the flavor or feel. These go down dangerously easy. 
While the midwest usually offers up tropical juice bombs, or a mix of east and west coast IPAs, this one is definitely a more traditional west coast version to me, and it absolutely nails it. This is in the Pliny the Elder good category whether you want to believe it or not. Probably a little less balanced.  Still one of my top handful of DIPAs. 1,409 charactersWesMantooth, Oct 18, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Honey yellow color glows from the glass, not much head, lacing on each sip but not strong enough to cling.  The smell is ridiculous, I smelled it the instant I popped the growler like it was caged and waiting to bust free.  Amazing citrus aroma with strong orange, grapefruit and lemon.  None of the grassy or piney notes hops usually bring.  Very clean focused aroma.  Taste is maybe the best of any beer I've had to date.  So delicate with big citrus flavors.  Orange, grapefruit and lemon; yeah it's all in there.  Light sweetness in the background from the malt that accentuates and just let's the hops shine.  Soft mouthfeel, low end of medium mouthfeel and none of the stickiness you'd expect from a beer with 8% ABV.  Finish leaves great hop flavor, refreshing and crisp and then in a flash it dries out.  This beer is dangerous.  Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had and I hope I get to have it again. 924 charactersHopBomb515, Oct 09, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5the thing thats so impressive about this beer isnt its hop profile, as good as that is (its amazing), but its the mouthfeel. there is no evidence at all that this is 8% abv, it drinks like 5%, and the body isnt even all big and sticky and filling, its just delicate stuff, very east coast, very impressive. the hop complexion does rock though, quite lemony but only mid range on the bitterness scale. there is a honey color to the beer but a definite baked malt profile under the hops, which gives balance but not much body and certainly no residual sugar. i like beers like this, that arent what i expect but are delicious anyways. some earthiness to the hops too, not grassy or piney, my familiar descriptors, but someplace in between, plant-like and mildy astringent, but with that lemon thing in there too. its got great carbonation and would be way too easy to get messed up on. my first beer from columbus is nothing short of sensational. 944 charactersStonedTrippin, Oct 09, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.6%This is my first review and I don't think I'm very good at explaining and describing a beer.  All I know is that this beer is absolutely phenomenal.  I've had a lot of Pliny (the Elder).  I've had Heady Topper and I've had quite a few Three Floyds.  I know these are some of the greatest IPAs (or double IPAs).  And they really are!  I love them all (in their own way).  But I really do have to say, if there was one beer that towers over them all, then it's this one.  From the nose to the taste, it's just brilliant.  I could never tire of drinking Bodhi.  Columbus and their brewmaster have really done something phenomenal with this beer.  I really don't even want to compare it to other beers.  I don't feel like it should be a competition.  But at the same time, I do have to say that this is absolutely the one I would favor over all of them.  For the simple reason that it never gets old.  Not too sweet.  Not too bitter.  Not too malty.  It's just right.  Glass after glass.  With every sip, you'll taste a little bit of heaven. ;)
PS:  I live in VA and drive up to OH just to drink this brilliant brew. 1,113 charactersnixage, Sep 30, 2014

I first noticed it with the 4/17 bottled batch, and a couple after that, keeping me from purchasing possibly my favorite local brew.  Had a pint the other night at Mac's because nothing else really sounded good to me, so i figured I would see if it was back to normal, and it IS!  Thank goodness!  Some of these people giving great reviews of this recently, April-May-June-ish, can't be trusted.  I am not 100% sure when this beer got its mojo back, so I am not talking to all of you. Cheers!
This is a very outstanding IIPA, it hides its alcohol extremely well, which I like. 8.5%, and I can drink them like water. I'm stocked up on this and FFF Zombie Dust right now, and am having trouble deciding which beer I like better (I do realize they're two different styles, but....). Both outstanding, of course. I saw some reviews that seem to be refering to off flavors, and all I can say is, I know they were having some bottle conditioning uses with this beer, that have since been figured out. I think this issue stalled this beer from flowing into the market. Give it another shot! 1,183 charactersjsidonis7, Sep 25, 2014

4.96/5  rDev +11.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5One of the best happy beers ever.
Look is straw yellow, minimal head, clear.
Smell is orange, tropical fruits, citrus fruits, coconut, papaya, tangerine, grassy and earthy, some dank herbal characteristics.
Taste follows nose: orange pith primarily, followed by coconut and papaya, grassy notes behind that. Some hints of tangerine and peach.
Feel: not super thick, but full enough for style, would clarify as chewy 97/100 times. Lingering bitterness, with some darkness hanging around too.
One of the best in the business. Surely a victim of this absurd "rarity" culture that permeates the craft beer culture. If Columbus made the same beer, renamed it and sold it in a limited run on a random weekday, it'd be a top 10 beer without a doubt. 746 charactersKevBot89, Sep 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.6%The beer comes in a hazy golden yellow color.
The aroma offers big tangerine, passionfruit, ripe apricot, peaches. A bright Citra aroma with no malt to speak of.
The flavor follows tasting of pure grapefruit zest. A smack of spicy floral of lavender and hints of eucalyptus and grass hit on the middle as the beer dries out towards a slight herbacious note.
 A hugely floral DIPA that could be mistaken for a treat from Shaun Hill of Hill Farmstead.  A large hop presence that sticks to the teeth, leaving hop residue and flavors lingering. 543 charactersdar482, Sep 01, 2014

Aroma of citrus and tropical fruits jump out of the glass.
Taste is similar to the nose, citrus and tropical fruits, good malt balance, minimal bitterness.  Not sure if this would be even fruitier if really fresh, but if so that would be pretty damn amazing.
Overall, a great beer. Very smooth and dangerously drinkable.  Easily crushed three 12oz pours in a very short time period.  Heady and Pliny have nothing on this. 463 charactersthebigredone, Aug 27, 2014

Appearance: Brilliant shade of Sunshine! Cloudy and mischievous, with a nice crown of frothy white head. The aroma is just straight Dank hops! Look, I hate to use the word Dank, but yeah, this brew is Dank and pleasant! Underlaying of citric, earthy hops with almost an herbal onion quality! The taste is just as banging! Citric, earthy and herbal. All hops with some subtle malts and alcohol on the back part of the tongue. The beer finishes as any DIPA should, dry, bitter and smooth! The mouthfeel is Medium-light and light carb. 
Overall: This beer is up there with Gandhi Bot. This brew is now one of my favorite DIPAs. It isn't lacking anything when it comes to DIPAs. It's incredibly drinkable, hoppy and nice balance on the malts yet Raw! This brew is recommended! 896 charactersShroud0fdoom, Aug 23, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +7%This beer is simply fantastic. Beautiful color and excellent smell. The hops explode on the tongue and there is little alcohol aftertaste that many DIPS's seem to have.

A: The color is a lovely shade of pale yellow straw. The beer looks hazy, crisp, and refreshing. Just a beautiful beer.
S: Intense aromas of grapefruit peel, juicy pineapple, and candied orange. Also some tangerine notes and plenty of dank, pine-laden hops. Delightful
T: Lots of citrus fruit (pink grapefruit, orange, and tangerine) and bits of mango. Nice backbone of pine and resin. Incredibly juicy and refreshing, with a great dry finish.
M: Somewhere on the lighter side of medium-bodied: it goes down easily and is endlessly drinkable. Light, juicy, creamy, and refreshing.
O: So glad I got to try this one…a fantastic DIPA that rivals some of the better DIPAs I've had 774 charactersblankenhoney, Jul 26, 2014

Review from notes, 6/7/14
Appearance: Lightly hazy, honey-orange in color with some nice tangerine and gold hues - pours with a small, off-white head, fades to a few wisps of a cap, leaves some lacing
Smell: Lots of citrus, definitely juicy and definitely dank - fleshy, juicy orange and grapefruit, with some grapefruit pith - very dank with some weed, grass, and piney notes - herbal and floral citrus as well - very hoppy (obviously), simply smells bitter (a good thing)
Taste: Maybe even more aggressive than the aroma - juicy, fleshy, chewy citrus - big orange and grapefruit flesh and pith - interesting blend of dank flavors, weed, grass, pine, and hop cones - very grassy, earthy, and herbal - very interesting, if not my personal favorite for a hop profile - moderately bitter, and the pithy bitterness lingers
Mouthfeel: Medium body, light carbonation, smooth and easy to drink, some earthy dryness
Overall: A growler? Sure!
This is a solid DIPA with an impressive amount of dank, weedy, grassy, and herbal notes in addition to a solid blast of citrus. I can see why people would go nuts over this. Personally, it's novel, but not the best I've had. 1,199 charactersangrybabboon, Jul 09, 2014

Big hop presence in the nose with pineapple, grapefruit, lemons and than a dank herbalness.
At first sip I taste honey and then Pow, I'm hit with intense pineapple. The pineapple is sweet and tangy before it melds with grapefruit, lemon and mango. Herbal, earthy tones are woven throughout the mid palate before it ends with a caramel malt sweetness.
The is drinks so smooth and easy it's like water but with a nice full carbonated heft.
A beer that lived up to its hype and fulfilled expectation. 622 charactersKYGunner, Jun 12, 2014
4.16/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4With the embrace of fruit and lupulin that Columbus has with beer, there's really no surprise with the demonstrative IPA that puts both front and center with a host of tropical, citrus and orchard fruit to entice and intimidate the senses all at once.
Tangerine, nectarine, passion-fruit, mango and even papaya join with more obvious fruity hop flavors of pink grapefruit, orange and pineapple for an early taste and vibrant aroma that steps straight out of Hawaiian Punch. Wrapped in a candied cocoon, its honey, caramel and simple syrup sweetness gives an emboldened ripeness to the fruit's character.
While the sweetness holds on in the middle, its fruity center turns bitter, resinous and pithy. An underlying estery quality of peach and marmalade reinforces the hops with seamless taste. Citrus pulls ahead late while introducing earthy flavors of fresh-cut grass, chopped chive and an exotic herbal character likened to cannabis.
A late dissolve of sweetness finally allows the hops take full control, dragging the tastebuds into a sticky and resinous dryness that's also elevated by spicy alcohols that numb the tongue lightly with the peppery prickle of acetone. 1,173 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 11, 2014

A- Poured a clear golden color with bright white soapy head that left splashy lace.
S- Big tangerine, mandarin orange, orange marmalade, and peach notes. Lots of pungent hop character and sweetness in the aroma.
T- Lots of sweet and juicy tangerine, orange marmalade, peach, and tropical fruit notes. Pretty bug pungent hop presence and moderate bitterness.
M- Lots of warming, light burn, full bodied, a little sticky, and dry finish.
O- Reminds me a lot of Boneyard's Hop Venom DIPA, a really big IPA with tons of sweetness and hop character. For 8% ABV, the alcohol is definitely present and borders on a little boozy. 662 charactersHoptometrist, May 26, 2014

Appearance - Golden orange. A little hazy. Nice white head, but settles enough to really fill up this snifter. Thin pillow of foam on top. Some lacing sticks inside.
Smell - Tropical fruits. Lots of tropical fruits. Doughy pale malt. The background has more of a grapefruit hop.
Taste - Less intense on the tropical fruits. More prominent grapefruit. The doughy sweetness is replaced by a more cracker malt and some caramel. A little bit of spicy bite in the back end, too.
Mouthfeel - Medium body, but pushing heavy for a DIPA. Never too sweet. Medium carbonation. Pretty boozy.
Overall - This is really good. Solid in every way. 673 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 28, 2014

Appearance - The beer was a coppery golden color. Since I was carrying the howler in a backpack, the beer was a little foamy when I opened it.
Smell - Sweet citrus is the initial impression in the smell with a mild maltiness in the background.
Taste - My first impression is the strong pineapple with orange and grapefruit lingering in the background. This is a sweet DIPA with the bitterness largely staying in the background. I had difficulty detecting the alcohol despite the high ABV. On might detect the resin a little more in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - For a DIPA, I thought this was fairly light. It coated the tongue nicely, but I did not think it was very thick.
Overall - This is probably one of my favorite DIPAs. 792 charactersJohnnyHopps, Apr 27, 2014

Lacking proper glassware, I poured this into a Night Shift feku. Very attractive beer, golden color, good clarity overall with a slight haze, topped with a beautiful cap of white foamy head; excellent retention, and nice pillowy lacing. The aroma was dank and earthy, notes of body odor and marijuana, pine resin. It seems like a lot of people pick up citrus notes in this beer, but I really got nothing citrusy whatsoever, and it was certainly lacking in crispiness. The taste largely reflected the nose, very dank, wet, flavors of pine needles, pot, a little oniony, with a good dose of bready malts that I'd expect from an average DIPA. Body was about medium, clean mouthfeel, but again, not really crisp or fresh/zesty. Definitely a nice beer, and easily drinkable for the style. 845 charactersRifugium, Apr 20, 2014

Pours a hazy yellow, with a one inch head and sheets of lacing down the glass.
Smells include citrus zest, tangy grapefruit, sweet and juicy orange, pineapple, apricot, and peach. Just outstanding smell, jumps out of the glass with fervor.
The taste is just incredible as well. Went down way too quick, despite all the flavor jam packed into this DIPA. Strong orange pineapple and grapefruit flavors, keeping it a little bit sweet, then the resinous pine slaps you across the face, makes it presence, and holds you in. Quite bitter, even more so as the beer warms up. The bitterness mixed with the juicy hop flavor is perfect, prototypical dry pine/citrus style IPA. Pretty dank flavor here, methinks.
Medium bodied, incredibly, there is no alcohol flavors. Drinks like a pale ale, hits you with flavor like a DIPA. Dry finish, warming, crisp mouthfeel.
Amazing stuff here. 930 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 14, 2014

Served in a snifter
The brilliantly clear, glowing, pale yellow-amber liquid was topped by a flimsy, bright white crown that fell to a lasting, bubbly ringlet. Hardly any lacing.
Fruity hop notes dominated the nose. Lots of tropical fruitiness. Mango and papaya were most apparent. Quite sweet. Strong peach notes.
The beer's flavor profile was very similar to the nose. Super fruity and juicy. Lots of candied orange peel. Intense peach and apricot notes. Some tangerine as well. A semi-sweet, caramel malt backbone gave the beer balance yet did not detract from the hoppiness. Ruby red grapefruit came through on the finish. Just slightly pithy and bitter.
The mouthfeel was somewhat disappointing. It seemed that my growler had definitely lost a good amount of its carbonation in transit from Ohio. The super fine, mild effervescence nevertheless gave the liquid a slightly slick creaminess.
Columbus Bodhi is a flavorful and immensely drinkable double IPA, but it is definitely a half-step below the best offerings of the style. Someday I would love another opportunity to sample this fresh on-tap. 1,168 charactersDamian, Mar 31, 2014

If you live anywhere near Columbus and haven't tried this beer yet, you're missing out on one of if not the best brews in the midwest. This beer goes quickly though. If you're lucky enough to see it on tap, snatch it up. By comparison, it's smoother than the regular CBC IPA. Extremely drinkable.
Now available in bottles (July'16). New batch every 2 weeks will hit stores. Giant Eagle has been the most reliable. Extremely fair price at $10/4-pack. 559 charactersSwettenham_Shire, Mar 12, 2014

Drinkability is solid, very much in my style, just could have used a bit more time in the bright tank. 477 charactersccrida, Mar 11, 2014

I consider myself very fortunate to have this whenever I want it. Pours a golden strawberry yellow, minimal head with some aggressive fizzies clawing to the top of glass. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, peach and mango. Flavors follow close behind with pineapple leading the way . . . Finishes clean and dry, juicy feel and taste. Overall, again, very fortunate to have this readily available. One of the best dipa's around 529 charactersGOBLIN, Mar 08, 2014

T: Fruit juice. Rich and juicy pineapple-grapefruit. Slightly bitter citrus aftertaste and absolutely no alcohol to speak of. Mind-blowing!
M: Medium-heavy bodied. Very smooth, creamy, and refreshing going down. 
O: Definitely one of the best, if not the best DIPA I've ever had. More people ought to seek this out! Right now limited to growlers; if they ever get it into bottles, I bet this would really take off. A++ 632 charactersd5001986, Jan 24, 2014

It pours a murky yellow with a two finger head. The smell to the nose was heaven. Pine, grassy, citrus. At first taste all that I smelled came to the tongue and was delicious. It was not as bitter as I thought or hoped it would be. But it was delicious and very easy to drink. I absolutely recommend this one and being 15 minutes from the brewery I will never miss out on this. 
An edit after the second glass...this stuff is amazing. It has it's own character and delicious hopiness that is hard to duplicate. My favorite so far has been fathead headhunter. This is a very close second for me. 683 charactersBeernDrum, Nov 21, 2013

M: So delicious you almost can't sit on the mouthfeel too long, but a decent carbonation that is smooth and satisfying.
O: If you haven't had this one, you really need to find a way to. A great Columbus beer that spoils the locals a little, but the second it hits taps, this one flies away, so be quick on it. 514 charactersTheAlmightyDejus, Oct 31, 2013
4.91/5  rDev +10.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Thanks so much to NW2285 for beering this forward! Pours a beautiful cloudy golden honey color with thick, two finger white head. Good retention and nice lacing. The aroma is the finest example of DIPA that I have ever experienced - redolent of grapefruit, pine, and just a touch of dank. Very hop forward on the nose. The taste does not disappoint, it is every bit the equal of the nose, if not superior. Grass, pine, and citrus come first, followed by a mild malt backbone that does an outstanding job of balancing out the mild bitter finish. This is the finest tasting DIPA I've ever had! It's balanced and smooth, the bitterness isn't overdone as in west coast IPAs. It has a medium body with good carbonation. Finishes dry. I can say without hesitation that this is the best DIPA I've had to date, and I'm pessimistic that I'll find one better. Please bottle this Columbus Brewing, please! 894 charactersJohnG190, Oct 30, 2013

Thanks to Wowcoolman for sharing this one.
Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink. 635 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 29, 2013

Pour is light orange with 2 fingers of head.
Smell is pure awesome grapefruit, pine, deep fruit.
Taste is just f!king fantastic. I'm really blown away here. Did not expect this amount of awesome when I cracked the growler. You have just a potpourri of tropical and citrus fruit with BAM amounts of hops. Minimal malt and extreme freshness. Something special here folks. I would drink this every day and twice on Tuesdays. A must have. 
Overall this is something special. Keeps up with the best of them. I'm motoring through this growler like it's a glass of H20 after a 2 day survival mission in the Mohave desert. It's like Natalie Portman bred with Giselle. 
Must try. May just be the best IIPA I've ever had. 777 charactersOneBeertoRTA, Oct 06, 2013

A - Pours a pale golden color with a slight haze. A finger of fluffy white head lingers on top for several minutes - shows good retention. Foamy lacing is left on the glass with nice rings forming as beer level descends in the glass.
S - Super piney on the nose up front with some lighter citrusy grapefruit and a nice mix of tropical pineapple and mango...a great mix of a variety of hop aromas. A low level base malt aroma manages to sneak thru yielding some light caramel and some bisuity malt aromas. 
Super hoppy but still shows a good overall balance, although definitely trending towards the hoppy.
T - A touch sweet. Super fruity and tropical, lots of grapefruit here. Pine really comes on strong here giving the largest hop flavor contribution. Malt is low in the flavor profile but the caramel malt in the aroma also shows thru into the flavor nicely.
M - Body is on the lighter side with a medium carbonation level. Resiny and sticky with tons of pine.
O - A DIPA that has been on my wants list for a long time, which is always dangerous since it is set up to be a letdown. This one definitely was not a letdown. Great hop character, full of flavor and variety from tropical and citrus to the forceful pine presence, this was hoppy all the way. Body is lighter, making this a pretty easy drinker. Shared the growler with one friend and this disappeared very quickly. Alcohol is well hidden here (although making our way thru this growler in short order, we definitely were feeling it at the end). 1,558 charactersportia99, Sep 20, 2013

Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy gold color with about an inch off-white head that stays around for a while. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, mango, lemon peel) and pine hops, along with some bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like citrusy (mango, grapefruit, oranges and orange peel) and piney hops, bready malt/grain, and a bit of floral hops too. There's a good lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. It drinks like a lower ABV brew would. Hopefully CBC will get around to bottling Bodhi soon. I guess it's been in their plans for a while but hasn't happened quite yet. Definitely worth trying if you see this anywhere, it's always nice to have a local brewery who can make a great brew like Bodhi (and Columbus IPA too). 970 charactersbluejacket74, Sep 06, 2013

A- Golden Straw color. Minimal white head from growler, light lacing lingers through the glass.
S- Sweet pine and citrus smell. Very tasty smell, maybe a slight malt aroma in the sweetness but mainly bright citrus. A little light but really nice.
T- A very Nice balance between pine & citrus. Some resin qualities with the bitterness. Alcohol is hidden nicely, wouldn't know its 8.5%. Very reserved but big flavors at the same time. You could really taste a lot without it overpowering your senses, which was really nice.
M- Light mouthfeel, lower carbonation. Light bitterness that follows through with a light lingering bitterness. A nice crispness with the bitterness. A little sticky and coats the mouth nicely. 
O- A very good beer. Excellent example of a DIPA. Perfect balance of big hop juiciness with just enough malt to support and bring out the hop flavors. 915 charactersWhiskeydeez, Aug 22, 2013

A: Pours a crystal clear, golden orange colored body. Huge, pillowy, bright white head. Leaves awesome residue on the sides of the glass as the head slowly dissipates. 
S: Exploding with hop character out of the glass - smells strongly like Galaxy hops, which happen to be one of my favs. Tons of orange, lemon, tangerine, and grapefruit citrus. A bit of bready, biscuit malts. This smells like a hop-head's dream.
T: Tons of sweet citrus hops upfront finishing with orange peel bitterness. Very little malt character, which is perfect, as it lets the hops steal the show. Virtually no booziness. If I didn't know better, I'd think I was throwing back a session IPA - dangerous. Some pineapple and mango sweetness, with even small hints of apple.
M: Surprisingly light. Moderate carbonation - though this could be a little carb loss due to some air space left in the top of the growler fill. A bit oily and creamy.
O: I'm always a bit leery when I engage in a beer with this much hype behind it. That being said, I'll jump right on this hype train.. You can never be fully certain of any blemishes when your first try is from a growler after a long commute home, but this one still delivered. I can't wait to try this on tap sometime - hopefully at the brewery one day. The juicy fruit sweetness balanced by incredible hoppiness is awesome in this one. The hops steal the show, but there isn't a ton of bitterness. 1,450 charactersJustin_Neff, Aug 16, 2013

Smell: Grapefruit and tropical fruit dominant
Taste: Just a hint of malt and we are off to the tropics, with huge grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors; nicely bitter, but the citrus (perhaps a hint of orange, too) really dominates the flavor profile
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall: This has got to be one of the best DIPAs brewed today - the ratings are high but if this showed up in bottles or cans it would have a lot more visibility 576 charactersbrentk56, Aug 13, 2013

4.02/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 432 oz. growler filled last weekend, but unopened since then, poured into a NB snifter.
A - Pours a light, pale golden. Two-finger head of tight, dense eggshell-white foam is topped with a small crown of really loose sudsy bubbles, all of which dissolves into a sheen across the surface and trails of broken lace around the sides. Held to a full-spectrum light, the beer is a bright, almost neon sunshine yellow with just a trace of lime green in it, and clear. Nice legs on the glass from the malt sugars.
S - Citrus and resin hops backed by grainy, lightly toasted malts. Nose is somewhat subdued, but in an approachable way. Pleasant.
T - Toasted malts with bits of light caramel and a touch of butterscotch are nicely balanced by citrus and pine hops that match up like two sides of a coin; they compliment each other well and are tied together with just enough room for each to be noticed on its own. The citrus hops are especially good, tasting like a bowl of oranges and red grapefruit mixed together with a splash of lemon juice. The bitterness of the pine takes over in the finish and pushes out hints of lemon drops. Not a trace of the ABV, this drinks like a regular IPA.
M - Rather fizzy, almost foamy; carbonation should be tighter. Reasonable body with good, integrated construction. Solid structure. Finish is pretty dry, with almost a pucker at the end.
O - Compared to other Double / Imperial IPAs, this one is on the tame side, but that's what makes it so drinkable. Nicely balanced. While it still features the hops, there's a good foundation from the malts that makes this a solid, tasty beer that you keep reaching for across an evening. 1,662 charactersBuckeyeSlim, Aug 03, 2013

A sweet malty, hoppy and citrus fruits comes through very nicely in the aroma. The citrus and malty flavors were amazing – fresh hops, tangy grapefruit, and piney. Medium bodied and decent carbonation throughout. Overall, this was a fine example of a DIPA and one that closely resembled a Three Floyds Dreadnaught / AleSmith IPA meets Three Floyds Zombie Dust type of beer. I would love to get my hands on some more of this beer! 534 charactersCuriousMonk, Jul 29, 2013

Aroma:  terrific nose with citrus notes.

Feel: a soft feel on the palate, no coating and low oils.  Very nice on the palate, and a pleasure to drink.
Overall: an outstanding IPA that is so refreshing and low on bitterness that many non-IPA drinkers enjoy it.  It is all the great things of a terrific IPA without some of the negatives. 514 charactersCynic-ale, Jul 29, 2013

I've had this one numerous times in the past, so I figured it's time to give this one a review. Pours a light golden; extremely clear and transparent; beautiful fluffy eggshell white head with solid lacing and retention. The aromas are extremely tropical. Tons of mango and pineapple. There's also a good amount of grapefruit in the nose as well. It as a west-coast vibe to it. The flavors match the nose. It never becomes overwhelming or overly bitter. There's a great balance between the bitterness and sweetness. Malts take a backseat. Very sharp, clean and flavors. There's a subtle touch of pine needles going on. There's a subtle dash of garlic, but nothing to be concerened about for the garlic/onion hater. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's medium-bodied and feels light for a DIPA. The carbonation is there, but far from overboard. It's also extremely fluffy and creamy. The alcohol goes completely unnoticed. This is dangerously drinkable!
Bodhi has those GOOD characteristics that alot of hopheads look for. It's not aggressive and in your face. It's more balanced and it doesn't have much to complain about. It's always been one of my favorite "local" DIPAs and is worthy of the acclaim it receives. Highly recommended. 1,298 charactersBB1313, Jul 27, 2013

A- It pours a very pale straw color with a decent sized white head that recedes somewhat quickly, leaving spotty, but distinct lacing.
S- The aroma is a straight grapefruit and tropical fruit bomb! Some other citrus comes through with fresh squeezed orange, tangerine, and loads of lemon verbena. A hint of caramel and pale malt balance it perfectly! Amazing nose!
T- The flavor matches the nose almost perfectly. Definitely more grassy/lemony flavors coming through, but this is balanced with sweet citrus and caramel malt. There is also a good bit of mango and pineapple, with a touch of passion fruit.
M- The mouthfeel has medium thickness, moderate carbonation, and goes down smooth. Another dangerously drinkable DIPA at 8%!
O- I am so happy to have had the opportunity to try this, and I will need to get this again! One of the best DIPAs I've had!! 956 charactersSadMachine, Jul 10, 2013

Medium bodied, sweet, generously hopped and carbonated, and has a lingering grainy citrus. This is a highly drinkable dipa, which reminds me of rpm.

Pours a cloudy light golden color with a decent head and lice retention and lace. Aromas of citrus, pine, resin, garlic and a heavy dose of caramel and bready sweetness. The flavor follows the aroma but ends up a bit too much on the sweet malty side for my liking. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resiny mouthfeel. Nice enough IPA but seemed a bit sweet for a dipa imho. 480 charactersjohnnnniee, Jun 08, 2013

Dank nose of orange peel, citrus, and pine resin. Could use a bit more "oomph."
Taste follows the nose in the dank path of hops. Slightly sweet honeyish malt character. Some residual sugar. Needs more hops to be a true Double IPA.

Currently only on tap (growler, draft, etc.). Hasn't ever been bottled for wide release by the brewery. And arguably the best beer the Columbus Brewing Company has ever produced (and also, one of the best Ohio-produced beers).
Bodhi isn't your typical DIPA. Of course, it's supposed to be hoppy. What it *isn't* supposed to be is to look like a hefeweizen. Nor is it *supposed* to have a mouthfeel that is superior to Bud Light somehow. And it's still hopped out of the roof! This beer is world-class and in a class of its own.
Appearance: Very very cloudy and hazy orange. Fantastic head. Carbonation isn't top-notch, but with the flavors packed in this beer, you could drink it flat, and it'd still excel. This simply isn't what a DIPA is "supposed" to look like.
Smell: Balanced hops and touches of banana.
Taste: Finely balanced hops, a touch of banana and ester. Quite balanced all around. It has the hops you want and crave, and yet also brings other flavors to the table. Outstanding.
Mouthfeel: As previously noted, would give a 6 to this alone. A DIPA simply isn't supposed to be this smooth. Just isn't supposed to be.
My highest recommendation for those of you looking for a DIPA/IIPA. 1,326 charactersxare, May 26, 2013

Pours a hazy golden color with a finger of white head with decent retention and a fine sticky lacing. The citrus shines through with an orange/tangerine dominance among several citrus flavors. It's like Sculpin used to be, but better. It's not punch you in the face grapefruit citrus (although it's there) it's a little more mellow and well balanced. Medium mouth feel perfect for the style, easily the best Double IPA I can recall not from CA or VT. If this was available locally this would work into my IPA rotation and would likely dominate it during warm weather.

A few other thoughts: This guy was excellent because it packed a major hop punch, but was lighter bodied than a lot of the IPAs and DIPAs I have been drinking. It also had a little more sweetness and creaminess than is usual for the style, and masked its relatively high ABV (8%) well. 553 characterstipfortap, May 20, 2013

Thanks, claaark13!
Very slightly hazed light golden and yellow in color. Moderately-sized white head. Nice amounts of visible carbonation rushing up through the glass. Lined lacing down the glass. Very pretty, very appropriately sticky IPA. So far, so good.
Lots of sharp grapefruit and orange aromas erupting from the glass. This reminds me of Pliny or a good batch of Sculpin in a lot of ways. Citrus, mild dank, and just a hint of pine and resin. Very nice.
The flavor follows the aroma: lots of grapefruit zest and juicy flesh, just a hint of caramel sweetness, moderate bitterness, but disappearing, crisp, marvelously drinkable flavors. This reminds me of early batches of Sculpin in many ways, which is the highest of compliments.
Lighter-medium bodied with crisp carbonation.
Fantastic. Easily my favorite Midwest (D)IPA. Finally, the Midwest brings a contender! 903 charactersehammond1, May 07, 2013

Growler to Travel bottle....=)
8oz to GI Chalice
App- When I popped this one into my chalice it was a nice medium colored orange. Maybe a touch of gold intermixed with a lighter yellow center. A small bit of bubbles was there but didnt leave much cling. A bit flat from going growler to travel bottle to glass.
Smell- When I took of a whiff of this it did have a bit of flat malts behind it, but at the same time a good balance of some strong mango and other tropical fruits. A little bit of pine as well to round out the back. 
Taste- A well rounded DIPA. Had a nice balance between the thicker malts and then a stronger fruit flavor than the nose suggested. A good hop bite but still a little flat from the travel. More malty than I wouldve though with still a nice pine.. 
Mouth- A fairly solid medium body and due to lack of bubbles a creamy medium carbonation level. A bit buttery feeling but thats okay. I get where they were going with this. Residual tropical fruits. A touch of pine as well.
Drink- I don't normally ask for travel bottles of DIPA's but trying to tick the top 250 calls for some skill and friends to help out. Thanks again Matt. Appreciate this tasty treat while away from home. 1,227 charactersFosterJM, Mar 20, 2013

A: Poured a yellow/orange color with a small white head on top, with nice head retention. A cap lasted for a good while with thin lacing down the glass. 
S: Nice tropical fruit aroma, some grapefruit and orange zest. Faint pine on the back end with just a touch of sweetness. 
T: A nice flavor profile, lots of citrus and tropical fruits. Lots of orange and orange peel, some grapefruit, the pine is a bit more pronounced compared to the aroma. A bit maltier too, with some light caramel. 
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Extremely drinkable, the growler was not hard to finish off at all. 
O: Wasn't surprised at all that I liked this beer, a nice big brother to their regular IPA. 752 charactersmdaschaf, Mar 13, 2013

Served in a tulip glass
A - It is a hazy yellow color with a couple inches of white head. 
S - The aroma is sweet tropical fruit. There is also some juniper and pine in there. 
T - The taste is full of tropical goodness. I get mango, pineapple, peach, nectarine, and just enough pine on the finish to cleanse the sweetness from my palate. It tastes like fruit cocktail with a pine finish. 
M - Medium with biting carbonation.
O - This is probably the easiest drinking DIPA I have had. It has all the flavors that I love in an IPA, citrus and tropical fruit with just the right amount of pine. I have been fortunate to try this on multiple occasions and finally was smart enough to take a growler home. This just goes down too easy. 751 charactersbuschbeer, Mar 10, 2013

4.88/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a growler into a tulip. Appears an extremely hazy orange, with nice head that leaves pretty nice lacing. 
Nose is absolutely perfect. Tons of citrus hops, and some good floral notes. Almost all hops, but there is a very small hint of sweetness that makes this combination amazing. The taste is similar, as expected. The upfront flavor is good malt that is immediately washed away with hopiness. Lots of floral and citrus, but the pine flavors finally make their presence known.
The mouthfeel is very smooth at first, but has a little bite on the tip of the tongue. There is a lot of stickiness, but it goes down nicely. Overall, this is an incredible beer. Very satisfying, refreshing and so flavorful. Another great beer from CBC! 745 characterszimm421, Mar 02, 2013

a - Pours a murky medium orange-yellow color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of oranges, citrus hops, grapefruit, fruity malts, some pine hops. Nice nose; not quite as hoppy as I was expecting but the citrus is very nice.
t - Tastes of oranges, citrus hops, pine hops, grapefruits, creamcicle, fruity malts, earthy notes. No bitterness at all in the taste, and a lot of orange again. Slight step down from the nose, but still really good.
m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation, with absolutely no bitter bite at all. Super smooth and easy to drink, I like the mouthfeel a lot.
o - Overall I thought this was a good beer, though I was a bit disappointed given the ratings. Justin was nice enough to bring back a case of fresh Columbus IPA as well and to be honest, I liked that one a bit better. It smell and tastes good with a lot of oranges and citrus, and has a great mouthfeel, but it isn't as hoppy as I would have hoped for. I thought DC Brau's OTWOA, which we also had that night, was much better. Worth having and would like to have it again for sure, but wouldn't trade the world for it because it is in the Top 100. 1,290 charactersmdfb79, Jan 03, 2013

Pours hazy orange/yellow, with a lacy white head, healthy head for a growler. The nose on this is amazing, piney, tropical citrus, lemon, bready, juicy, crisp, clean, need I say more? Tastes as its smells, great citrus fruit, not bitter like some DIPAs, so refreshing . It's got a great texture, without being "thick". The finish is so smooth for a DIPA, and doesn't leave you with a bitter finish, just enjoyable. This beer is not over rated, one of the best I've had. They've been talking about bottling this for a while, hopefully it's sooner than later! 622 charactersbrewtus, Dec 30, 2012

The beer pours a nice hazy orange color with a nice creamy white head. 
The smell and taste are good, but a little one dimensional to me. When I taste it I can only think it tastes like an orange cream sickle. It has a nice orange hop presence with the lactose like sweet malts, but really not much bitterness or hop bite at all. A nice feat, but really not too interesting after a while, a nice creamy feel though. 
Not bad but overrated in my opinion. I agree with my friend starrdogg that it is too simple to be in the top 100. 573 charactersDreadnaught33, Dec 29, 2012

At the time of this review, this is #15 on the "Top Beers - American Double / Imperial IPA" list on beeradvocate.com. Overall this was quite the nice double IPA, probably slightly over-rated from my perspective but really only slightly. I would definitely have this again if I could find it on draft. I love it. The aroma was the best part, smelled like Hill Farmstead Abner.
Beer is yellow with a slight haze to it, nice slightly off white head, small and medium bubbles, some lacing, moderate to low carbonation.
Aroma is grapefruit, biscuit, sweet, hops.
Beer is medium in body, chewy hop resin, nice moderate bitterness from the hops on the back, decent hop flavors, could have been more forward on the palate, overall a great beer though. 811 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 04, 2012

Beer is a slightly hazy yellow with a thin white head. The smell bring a nice tropical fruit hops aroma to the table with a little bit of bready malt in the background, but I'm not overly impressed. Flavor follows the nose - it's got a nice citrus fruit hoppiness with a light malt with a slightly bitter finish. It's not really overwhelming in any one way like a great DIPA should be. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a solid DIPA that I would certainly drink regularly if available to me, but in my opinion it's VERY overrated. It just doesn't compare to a lot of the other DIPAs on the Top 100 list - too simple. 682 charactersstarrdogg, Dec 04, 2012

The beer is hazy and straw yellow with a half inch of white head that coats the glass with lacing. The aroma brings fresh hops, tangy grapefruit, biscuity malt. The flavor is very nice, though not quite as lovely as the scent. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation.

4.67/5  rDev +5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at CBC first as part of a flight, then in a tulip. Because as it turns out, a 2-3 oz pour of this baby is not enough.
Pour isn't terribly impressive, especially when measured next to IPA and Super Flesh H.O.P in the flight. A cloudy, flattish pour, evocative of chicken broth. Nice lacing though. Amusingly looks like the fat that rises to the top of broth.
Smell. Picking up on American hops, and a palette of citrus and tropical fruits. Something special happening here.
Taste is just a carpet bombing of hops (simcoe?) and fruity notes, orange, mango, grapefruit, pineapple(?) all vying for attention. There is not a single false or unpleasant to this beer. The deeper I get in the glass, the better it gets.
Tremendous, medium body. Again, everything is right with the consistency of Bodhi.
Overall, a must try. If you don't like it you don't like beer, or at least you don't know hoppy beer . As of this writing, this is the #15 DIPA on BA. And look at who's ahead of Bodhi. Nothing but legendary beers and revered breweries. In this instance, CBC has earned it's place among the greats. 1,104 characterslurpy1, Nov 17, 2012

Pours a frothy, hazy burnt orange with a pillowy white cream head. Above average lacing for an imperial IPA. First smell...hmm...nirvana? Not exactly, but the closest experience I've had in the world of beers. Faint malt sweetness mingles with a whirlwind of citrus(grapefruit and clementine) and tropical(light mango with pear) flavors followed by a hop slap to the dome. Pure dankness. The intensity of the hops never lets up, but at no point do you feel overwhelmed(or underwhelmed.) Medium-full mouthfeel has just enough carbonation to please the tongue while allowing the subtle dryness to leave you wanting another sip. and another sip. 
Notes: On this occasion, Bodhi was consumed multiple times through out the Ohio brews vs Michigan brews beer tasting at Brews Cafe(Granville, Ohio). With beers like Founders Breakfast Stout and Bells Expedition Stout many beers can get lost on the palate and become forgettable at best by nights end. Not Bodhi, not even close. Best beer of the night? yes. of the year? more than likely. But definitely the first and only keg to be completely emptied at this tasting and that's saying quite a bit about this amazing beer.
Edit. Inconsistencies are the only thing that have taken this brew down a notch, from 5 to 4.75. It;s never been bad or average but never has it been as good as it was at a particular beer festival. 1,389 charactersequincel, Nov 12, 2012

Growler picked up from The Wine Spot, Cleveland Heights, about 4 hours ago ($13.99).
Somewhat hazy, golden-yellow elixir, poured into DFH chalice. No precipitate. Beautiful lacing clings to the vessel during the tasting.
You really can't mistake the aroma from this one. Hophead's dream: hoppy citrus and mango predominates and pine with subtle earthtones. Delightfully complex DIPA.
 Wow, smooth hop bitterness from beginning to end. Some nice dank, resinous pine, but not cloying or overstated. No way this is 8% ABV. So smooth.
Medium body, smooth, not oily or too slick. 
This one is on par with the best DIPAs and really brings the hops forward without being overwhelming. Nice job Columbus Brewing. 781 charactersCaptCleveland, Oct 28, 2012

Pours a hazy honey gold with constant beading - the body is like that of a good hefe, topped with a finger of paper white fluff that thins out to a cap after a minute or two... great lacing. 
Bittersweet mango fruit twisted with dense conifer qualities, syrupy bright hop aromas of every kind, some mellow citrus, the floral and herbal/earthy bits are appropriately mellow I think.
Love the easy drinking level of bitterness that this beer displays... massive hop presence that isn't muddied up by an overly bitter mouthfeel. Nice. Sweet citrus and tropical bits, smooth... great stuff.

S: The most tropical smelling IPA I've experienced yet. Tons of pineapple, mango, and citrus aroma. Absolutely top notch.

Cool mild orange pour, some noticeable haze that is far from a detraction in this beer. Amazing aroma, heavy on the tropical fruit, the lushness of the aroma is so enjoyable, this ain't one of those shitty dipas that just slams you with copper penny bitterness, this is like a lush rain forest of pine tree, citrus and tropical fruit hop medley. 
Same aroma mimicked in the taste, damn this is good stuff, low bitterness, high hop mouthfeel, the body is relatively light, doesn't get resiny or sticky. Really lots of citra, amarillo and columbus seem to be in play here. They produce plenty of tangerine, pine and mango flavors. The beer doesn't even approach being challenging to drink, the alcohol is nowhere to be found. 
Columbus is just a fantastic brewery for making hoppy stuff. Best brewery for multiple hoppy beers outside of California? I wouldn't argue with the contention. Nor would I argue with the contention that its better than 95% of the breweries in California's stuff either. 1,054 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Aug 16, 2012

A: The beer is very hazy straw yellow in color and has a light amount of visible carbonation. It poured with a thin yet dense finger high head that has excellent retention properties.
S: There are light to moderately strong aromas of grapefruit and orange citrus in the nose.
T: Like the smell, the taste has flavors of flavors of grapefruit and orange citrus intermixed with a light to moderate amount of bitterness. The bitterness becomes stronger as the beer warms up.
M: It feels medium-bodied, a little crisp and very smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: The mouthfeel of this beer is incredibly smooth for an IPA. While it’s quite drinkable (because there are no traces of alcohol in the taste and it’s not overly bitter) it is a beer that has an interesting flavor that makes you want to sip and savor. 889 charactersmetter98, Aug 16, 2012

Tastes like biting into a fresh fruit. Orange and grapefruit at every turn, fresh citruy hops make me smile. Huge malt backbone. Clean, crisp, and balanced. Very good, wish I could drink this every day. 426 charactersbrystmar, Jul 20, 2012

A- Pours a slightly hazy orange liquid with a few streams of rising carbonation. The white head is thin but creamy. 
S- Passion fruit, mango, pineapple, pine, caramel, and a bit of citrus. Absolutely astounding.
T- The fruit really jumps out at first followed by the biscuity malt. Really fruity and delicious. The malt backing is definitely a but on the lighter side which works really well for this beer.
M- The carbonation is nice and the lingering bitterness is spot on.
O- An outstanding beer for the style. Seems like an extreme Zombie Dust. 588 charactersgordavidson, Jul 19, 2012

S - Big citrus hop nose with some pine as well. Grapefruit and some tangerine. Slight biscuit malt presence. Very good.
T - This tastes fantastic. The hop presence is big, but not harsh or abrasive. Very little malt, but just enough to give a little body. Similar to smell there is mostly a citrus hop presence, but I get some pine and grass as well. A bit resinous. Fantastic.
M - Medium mouthfeel with a nice bitterness throughout. Lingering bitterness, but very pleasant, not overwhelming or insanely dry.
O - This is one of the best DIPAs I've had. Definitely a hop showcase, but also somehow restrained in a really excellent way. Wish this was available near me. 761 characterswarnerry, Jul 16, 2012

Appearance: Slightly hazy pale ambe body with two fingers of lingering foam.
Smell: Tangerine, orange and pine. A hint of tropical fruit. Malt is barely perceptible. Hops are vibrant and intense. 
Palate: A ton of citrus - orange, grapefruit and pineapple, with a resinous kick beneath. There's a light bready malt backbone, a touch of caramel and bitter orange peel. The finish is clean but firmly bitter, body is medium-light. This is fantastic stuff. 470 characterslargadeer, May 20, 2012

First steinful pours with a towering 2" bright white head, over the cloudy golden brew. Head snocones above the rim, literally doesn't go anywhere for a long while, with sticky lasting lace. Aroma is citrus, dominantly grapefruit. 
Taste starts with a light sweetness, but is more defined by the grapefruit and citrus power from beginning to end. Sticky lingering bitterness at the close, with ample alcohol warmth. No overpowering bitterface though, which is awesome. Mouthfeel is totally smooth, with incredibly dangerous drinkability. And this was put in a growler three weeks ago?!? Who says growlers don't last? Cheers to GATM! 727 charactersppoitras, May 06, 2012

Appearance: Pours a clear amber with delicate bubbles and a two finger off white head. There is good retention and some nice lacing left on the glass.
Smell: This beer smells incredibly fresh. I'm getting some malt sweetness with a lot of citrus and pine hops. Very nice.
Taste: The taste definitely isn't a let down compared to the smell. There is a very nice malt sweetness with a mild alcohol warmth, but the hops are the star. Hops all over the place with citrus peel and pine cone bitterness. The finish is bitter, but some of the grain shows up as well.
Mouthfeel: The body is just on the thick, syrupy side of medium with very delicate carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: This is a great double IPA. I love the fact that you can pick up the malt even though your tongue is being assaulted by hops. I feel very fortunate to have gotten to try this treat and would love to have more in the future. 947 charactersoline73, Mar 23, 2012

A- Surprisingly light, pale yellow color, with a slight hint of orange color. One finger head popped up with moderate retention. The suds had a good lacing characteristic. 
S- Monster Grapefruit. Really big, bold citrus, with a hint of pine. The fresh citrus really stands out though, and I love the smell, especially given the light color. 
T- Kinda like getting punched in the tastebuds with a bag of grapefruit. Serious citrus notes with a lot of grapefruit up-front. Solid bitterness at the end, but it isn't just bitter for the sake of being bitter; this beer utilizes it's hops really well. Very little malt profile, as they were clearly trying to highlight the hops in this beer.I love this beer. 
M- Moderate mouthfeel. Just about right. 
O- Really good beer. Not the most complex thing you are likely to have, but the hops are awesome. If you are a fan of citrusy-hop characteristics in a beer, this is a must-drink. 962 charactersIPA4LIFE, Mar 08, 2012

A. A clean, pale orange yellow. About a finger of crisp white head. Solid retention as a quarter finger lingers throughout the session. Really good lacing, gobs of the sticky stuff are all over my half empty glass. A good looking DIPA here. 
S. Mmmmm, pineapple, grapefruit, and citrus zest are coming in loud and clear. Some nice pine resin and just a hint of skunk in the background. Creamy, citrusy, and delicious. 
T. Pineapple, pine resin, sweet malt. A super light drinking DIPA. Creamy up front with an assertive hop bitterness in the mid. The finish is delicious pineapple and cream, but a touch of thinness comes in and almost gives a watery impression. Slightly dings an otherwise spectacular flavor profile. 
M. Good. A slightly watery finish is a bit of a negative, but for the most part, flavors are balanced and well integrated. A solid DIPA. 
O. Another good IPA from CBC. If you see it on tap, don't hesitate to partake! 970 characterssiege06nd, Dec 31, 2011

Aroma: Light biscuity aroma gives way to flowery and citrus-like hop aromas. Smells like liquid citric acid. I mean that in the highest of compliments. Aroma seems much more balanced between light biscuity notes and citrus American hops but we'll see.
Appearance: Cloudy straw color with a thin and wispy white head. Appears still in the glass. Seems a touch turbid.
Flavor: Strong citrus flavors up front. Fresh orange zest and lemon peel. Nice clean bitter base. Balance is definitely to the citrusy and somewhat pine resiny hops. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is lingering and bitter.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Slightly oily but the alcohol is well hidden...a velvet hammer. 
Overall impression: A highly drinkable, clean, hop driven, West Coast style IPA. Not sure it hits the Double IPA category but splitting hairs here. It's a nice hoppy IPA. Will try again. 934 charactersmattcrill, Nov 06, 2011

A-Beautiful golden color throughout with transparency. Big white foamy head...lots of lacing and good retention. 
S-Fruity, citrus and tropical and VERY hoppy....a trademark of any CBC IPA....especially true here. I want to keep smelling the beer...can I have this scent in cologne form? 
T-Holla! Great fresh hoppy flavor throughout...crisp...bitter...fresh. But...and this is a good thing...as the other reviewers have noted...it is not DOMINATED by hops...flavors of fruit (pineapple, lemon, orange, grapefruit) and pine are also clearly present. 
M-smooth...medium carbonation...just the right texture for DIPA. 
O-This is easy to get carried away with...considering it is 8.0% ABV and it is so damn good and easy to drink. I feel like each time I review a new beer from CBC Hop Odyssey I say this...This is my new favorite of the Odyssey. CBC knows IPAs....and it is also clear they know how to make a damn fine DIPA as well.

A - Big white foam that has great retention, splotchy lace, and eventually settles to a thick cap. Golden transparent body with lots of visible bubbles.
S - Lots of earthy aromas, with piney, floral, and dank notes, with a bit of tropical fruit and citrus in the periphery. The malt character is bready, with a small amount of toasted sugar as well.
T - Candied citrus fruits, perfume and floral notes, largely unobtrusive malt character and medium residual bitterness. A little bit understated, but quite enjoyable.
M - Lower carbonation, medium body, sticky and chewy, with no perceptible alcohol. Could stand to be a touch drier for my tastes.
D - I wasn't blown away like some of my colleagues, but this is a solid, well-crafted DIPA in the Midwest vein. It's incredibly easy to drink (crushable, if you will) and would be an excellent go-to beer if I lived in the Columbus area. 1,019 charactersMasterSki, Jun 16, 2011

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Truly thrilled to try what I believe is Columbus's best DIPA.
Yellow-orange color with slight haze. 
Fantastic citrusy, floral aroma with huge hop punch. Grapefruit, pine..everything I want in a great double IPA. 
It is truly exceptional how this very hoppy beer does not become overwhelmed with hops..the malt that is present is well-noted as well. That being said, the malt does not get to a sticky-sweet level, and the finish is somewhat dry.
While the brewers have refined this beer and they feel it can still be improved, I must admit to me this beer is pretty close to the epitome of what I want in a West Coast style DIPA..hats off to the CBC crew for creating a superior beer in all regards. 703 characterssmithm1970, Jun 01, 2011

golden amber with wonderful clarity, three inches of white foam quickly develops on the top of the beer. Settles slowly, but surely into a sticky, glass coating mess that lets you know you are dealing with a monster.
Such crisp, ripe citrus aroma, this may be hands down the best smelling double IPA I have ever run across, it really is just that good. Oranges and heaps of sugary tangerine goodness are just oozing out of this one, Simply spellbinding as it tugs you in and will not let go, not for a moment. Then you manage to make it past the cloud of citrus and into the first sip, and then its over. First off this is over nine and a half percent and drinks like its five. Amazingly hidden alcohol. The smoothness of the profile as the hops are seemlessly blended to the point you get the full brunt of the orange and pineapple flavor but your palate is not torn apart. Remarkable beer. Super dry finish leaves you thirsty, begging for more, wandering around outside looking for that growler to get another taste before its gone,
One of the best beers out there right now period. 1,266 charactersmikesgroove, May 28, 2011

Hazy, burnt yellow-orange color. On the pale side for a DIPA. This beer has a summery look to it.
Huge citrusy, floral aroma. Tropical fruit, a bit of pine. This mix of hops is reminiscent of Columbus IPA, just stronger. Mouthwatering would be a good way to describe it.
Taste is big on hops. Tangy grapefruit leads into a mild sweetness, some cherry and mango notes, and ends with a nice piney hop bite. Great hop:malt balance in this one. Malt sweetness does make a brief appearance, but the hops dominate.
Medium bodied. Slick with a dry finish. Super easy drinking.
Overall a great DIPA. The aroma pulls you in and the taste and smooth mouthfeel just make you want to keep drinking. If you like the CBC IPA, this is a beer you will enjoy. 827 charactersDaehpoh, May 25, 2011

I was expecting the Uncle Rusty i loved so much last time i ordered their hop odyssey. When the light gold glass was put in front of me i was a little disappointed. All of the was over when i took the first smell. citrus prevails with grapefruit some pineapple and a little pine. the first sip put any remaining reserve to rest. pale malt is discernible in the background and is well balanced by the hop profile which is similar to the smell. sweet citrus and pine start, medium smooth body with a bitter finish, just how i like an imperial ipa. I'm not usually one to pay too much attention to lacing but this time it really stood out. I cant make up my mind which i like better, uncle rusty or bodhi. both are incredible if you ever get a chance try any of the hop odysseys, you wont be let down. 886 charactersdmanis21, May 24, 2011

4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky to find this on cask at Bob's Bar. Glad to see it available again. This beer is light golden color with a very fine haze, and a thick frothy layer of white stuff. Huge lacing too, thick sheets of bubbles dried onto the glass.
The aroma is fairly awesome, the crew at CBC knows how to make a good IPA/DIPA. Tropical citrus like mango and pineapple, some toasted malt is barely perceptable too. Mainly hops though, with no noticable alcohol. Same with the taste, what an excellent beer. The hops shine through, not abrasive or burning in any way, more just aromatic and flavorful. This is a DIPA done very well.
The body is ideal, just a wonderful light and velvety cask character, this goes down like water. Delicious hoppy water. I'm ordering another right now. 775 charactersTurdFurgison, May 18, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Ahhh Bodhi reappears for the 2nd Round of Hop Odyssey. I didn’t have a chance to try this the first time around, so I’m pleased to see it.
Bodhi’s an interesting pale gold color. Much lighter than you’d ordinarily expect for a DIPA. One glance tells me this beast is very short on caramel malt. Works for me. Slightly off-white head covers it and stands just shy of a finger tall. It recedes rather quickly, and leaves a moderate web of sticky lace in its wake. 
The nose is fantastic! I’m unsure of the exact hop profile, but citric and pine notes are abundant. Grapefruit, pineapple, and light mango are the most prevalent. I don’t know the exact hop profile, but Citra is definitely in the mix. In that respect, it is somewhat reminiscent of 12 Hops of Christmas. It smells sweet and perhaps a tad sugary. The malt base is sturdy, but subtle. I’m not getting any caramel malt at all. Maybe a little pale. Whatever it is, it gives the hops plenty of room to shine. Alcohol is blended well. 
The flavor is easily on-par with the nose. It really does have an interesting, restrained malt profile. I suspect it is mostly pale. I’m not getting any overly sweet caramel notes, and I love that about it. It really enables the hops to take charge and deliver bold, tasty citric and pine flavors. Citrus grapefruit, mango, and pineapple flavors are strong and delicious. It is bitter, but isn’t palate wrecking by any stretch. Don’t get me wrong, the hops have an aggressive, intense impact, but it’s apparent in flavor rather than bitterness. Alcohol is masked extremely well and isn’t all that strong. Finishes with a ton of hop flavor and just a touch of bitterness.
Bodhi has a medium body that is definitely nice and smooth. Carbonation is dialed down nicely. It’s going down really easy. In terms of its abv, it’s definitely deceptive and inviting. Proceed with caution. 
Several years ago, the first elephant born in the Columbus Zoo was named Bodhi. Bodhi was also synonymous with ‘nirvana’ according to ancient Buddhism. Irrespective of what prompted the name here, it is a tremendous elephant of a beer. I would also buy into the argument that drinking it is close to nirvana. It really is excellent. Grab a growler and see for yourself. 2,278 charactersprototypic, May 14, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Ah, yes. I finally get to try Bodhi. For a while I feared that this one would never make a reappearance. Thank God for the Hop Odyssey redux. 
Growler poured into a St Bernardus wine-style glass. I'm going to experiment with glass shapes over the course of this growler to see which one I like the most for this beer. 
Appearance
Despite the wide mouth on this glass the head and it's retention are very strong. I'm getting a couple full rings of pure white lace with a smattering of foam below them. The beer has a nice color, but for whatever reason it came as a surprise to me. Its a pretty pale gold with a modest haze about it. I think my surprise came from the fact that this is lighter in color than their regular IPA. Maybe that just means there will be less malt intrusion and a lighter malt character all around. We'll see here in a second. 
Aroma
Lots of the tropical hoppy aromas that make CBC beers so fantastic. This one, however, brings a lot more pine than the others in Eric's portfolio. It smells like they are going after Pliny the Elder here, and are doing a good job at it. A bright pineapple and grapefruit rind combo carries equal weight to lots of fresh evergreen and pine sap. Malts are definitely sturdy here and of the lighter order. There might be some pilsner malt, but whatever it is is giving off lots of white bread and crackery dough aromas. There is even and intermittent honey sweetness. This is certainly bursting with hops, it smells green and fresh. 
Taste
Pine is very strong and sees things through to the end. At about half palate grapefruit rind and lemon zest come out and provide their tropical nuances. Unlike many IIPAs, in my experience, the malts hold off until the finish, where they impart lots of white bread crust and unsalted cracker. There is a flash of sweet pineapple juice in the middle. The finish is formidably bitter with a long lingering pine resin flavor. Once the glass warms slightly a new level of citrus awakens. Things get very floral with notes of honeysuckle and candied orange. A similar effect is applied to the aroma as well. 
Mouthfeel
Medium bodied, this ale finishes very, very dry. It gives it a very crisp, biting conclusion and keeps you sipping. The carbonation is more fluffy than sharp but it does grip the sides and tip of the tongue.
Overall
This is exactly what I think of when I think west coast imperial IPA. A truck load of hops with a pale malt base and copious notes of pine with citrus interspersed. People from all over are finally getting to know and enjoy CIPA, but its the small batch beers like this, Creeper and Uncle Rusty that I really wish could get spread around. Soon enough people will see that CBC isn't a one trick pony. Kudos guys, I can't wait to see whats next! 2,774 charactersMbpBugeye, May 06, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This one stole the show at the 2009 Micro Brew Festival. This is my number 1 DIPA it has it all. The smell is like your in the middle of a pine forest. The taste is what a hop head would expect from a double, grapefruity citrus heaven bomb, yet it still holds a balance. It's in no way over the top like Ruination it's just a thing of beauty. I'm so lucky to live so close to CBC if only the rest of the country could enjoy this brewery... On second thought that might mean less for us locals, scratch that!! My only beef with this beer and a few of the other CBC offerings is that we never know if they will be back in circulation again. Long live CBC!! 654 characters2Stout4u, May 14, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a pint glass on 9/12/09
A - Very light & pale golden-yellow color. Slightly obscured & hazy. It was a full pour, so not much foam. Some small bubbly lace early on, but it doesn't hold.
S - Big grapefruit nose. Sweet & fruity citrus. 
T - Very potent grapefruit is in the foreground & it certainly is quite bitter. Obvious hints of other light citrus fruits - orange, pineapple undertones & the like. Not getting much as far as malt characteristics.
M - Lighter side of medium-bodied. Crisp & zesty carbonation. There is a bit of lingering bitterness on the finish.
D - Almost too drinkable; it's a nicely ramped-up version of their IPA. Given my druthers, I would still take a regular Columbus IPA over this, but Bodhi is a damn close second. An excellent treat. 779 charactersRyan011235, Oct 15, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky enough to try this 'special' draft (that is what my waitress called it). I'm hoping that they keep this one around...
A- Pours a clear golden color with a thin white foam head that leaves a few rings of lacing towards the top of my glass.
S- An absolute citrus hop bomb! Very tropical and hoppy with a slight tang of alcohol. 
T- Thankfully, this one tastes like it smells. Nice sharp initially hop bitterness with flavors of orange peel, tangerine, pineapple, passion fruit, and lemon. The alcohol has a slight warming effect on the way down but isn't bothesome.
M- Medium bodied with ok carbonation. A touch lighter in body that I would have guessed for a DIPA.
D- Dangerously drinkable with a great citrus hop flavor. 747 charactersprojectflam86, Oct 07, 2009
