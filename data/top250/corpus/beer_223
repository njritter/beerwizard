4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a golden-orange color, but I was surprised to see it this clear despite being labeled “unfiltered.” Lot of rising bubbles. Thin white head that lingers. Floral and tropical fruit aromas. Taste mirrors this, moderate amount of hops for the style, there are certainly more aggressively hopped IPAs. A delayed malt character presents itself to balance out the finish. Thick, lacy mouthfeel, can feel and taste this beer for about 20 minutes after finishing it. 467 charactersnick_perry, Jun 19, 2017

Poured a  light golden color in a Spiegelau glass with a 4 finger head.
Excellent head retention. The head lasts few minutes.
Wonderfully floral bouquet. Spice.
Very carbonated, spicy.
Grape, citrus  taste. Before warming, the taste is dominated by hoppy spiciness.
Grape and citrus, and a smoother MF come into play with warming. Spicy hoppy finish.
Overall, an excellent excellent+ beer. 446 charactersbrureview, Jun 18, 2017

Pours a very slightly cloudy medium amber color. 1 finger head that sticks around for a bit. Not a ton of lacing.
Aroma is great. Mangos, banana, pine, orange, lemon, wheat, peach, malts. Very fruity and creamy. 
Taste is bitter grapefruit and smooth malts. Lots of citrus. Was expecting more fruit based on the nose but the bitterness dominates a bit.
Dry and bitter finish that makes you want to keep sipping. 
Overall, a great DIPA. A bit too bitter for my taste but great nonetheless. 535 charactersBdubz94, Jun 08, 2017

Bottled 4/22/17
No indication from the bottle that I detected, but this must be from Richmond.  Unlikely that California beer made it by surface transport in two weeks.
Enjoyed from a local brewery tulip.
Golden, hazy appearance with 1/2 inch head which quickly dissapates to a persistent ring.  Spotty lacing.
Citrus aromas, accompanied by characteristic Stone yeast note.
Grapefruit, mango, tangerine well balanced with the malts.  Stone signature yeast melds with everything else in a harmonious unity.
Substantial body with dry finish.   Not hot or boozy even as the 9.4 % ABV shines through.
I skipped at least two Enjoy By's  prior to this one.  Plenty of DIPA's available fresh these days.  Really impressed by this vintage. 750 charactersReef, May 04, 2017

Pours clear golden without much haze, no sediment.  A 1-inch foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly.
Smell is of fresh and pungent hops strong in grapefruit rind, citrus, tangerine, some peach, and a little bit of spice (clove?) and pine.  Taste follows the nose and is more citrusy up front, then mid-palate has some grapefruit and other fruits with a combination of bitterness and sweetness, and there is a resinous and oily quality whereby it crawls into every part of the mouth supplying different notes in different places.  Feels fairly full bodied with low carbonation.  Sharply bitter in the back of the throat and finishes dry but doesn't linger too much, and somehow invites another gulp.  Incredibly drinkable at 9.4% alcohol.  I loved it. 859 charactersPlinyMeNow, Apr 26, 2017

Smell is a sweet piney honey scent. Very nice.
The taste is excellent. A very balanced ipa with slight sweetness and piney hops. Hard to put a lot of notes on it as i just drank a 120 minute ipa (palate wrecker) for this abv, it is a great ipa. 
Mouthfeel isn't thin, but more drinkable than some super high dipas.
Overall a very solid beer at 3 bucks per 12oz. If i wanted to pay more I'd go with double crooked tree (darkhorse) or the implication(odd side). They are a little heavier. I like my dipas at 11-13%

L: pale amber-gold liquid, mostly clear but with maybe a very slight haze... rocky, jiggly blanket of bright off-white foam, nice hold... a few jagged scars of crusty lace
S: orange pulp, sweet pepper, grapefruit oil... very soft, medicinal booze underneath, as well as some biscuity malt... maybe more than a hint of peach and a subtle overtone of old wool upholstery... nice little nuances, but intensity may have softened by the point
T: super citrusy up front, with a surprising degree of lightly toasty-roasty crystal malt poking out... spicy, peppery static in the middle of the palate... the malt stays nicely balanced with the bitter citrus of the hops in the aftertaste, but that could be due to the hop dynamics having softened by the final day... malt and spice goes almost snickerdoodle last two sips, mmm... bold flavors overall, though lacking any unique (hop) characteristics
F: at first, medium-light bodied and supple... softly oily residue with a lovely full-thorax warmth... excellent tongue squeezing bitterness long after each sip... the alcohol behaves itself - such expert execution... by the end, it's malt/hop nectar (filtered hermetically clean, however)... the balance is superb - maybe you could lay this down for awhile
O: the hop flavors are very conventionally west coast, but their depth, density, and intensity is fantastic... this might easily be their most flavorful, enjoyable hoppy pale (when young)... great marketing concept (drink by), though the 10-hop garbage still never does amount to anything interesting 1,642 charactersBouleboubier, Apr 22, 2017

hazy golden body, light carbonation, thick off white creamy head leaving very nice lacing.
a little citrus on the nose, a little dampness, and a little hops. 
Oh boy is this one tasty brew. usually dank doesn't do much for me, but this balance is devastatingly spot on. 37 days to the day after being bottled. the mix of hops hits this palate perfectly. 
close to full on the mouth, slightly bitter and sour on the finish. 
overall, this is one of the most dangerously drinkable 9.4's you will find. Since Stone orders me to "Enjoy by 4/20/17", I guess I'll have to drink the other one in the fridge tonight. poor me. :) 701 charactersMikeWard, Apr 21, 2017

From the bottle: "Devastatingly Dank"; "Enjoy Now!"; "Brewed to be Enjoyed within 37 days"; "Live for the Now, the present."; "You have in your hands a devastatingly fresh double IPA. While freshness is a key component of many beers - especially big, citrusy, floral IPAs - we've taken it further, a lot further, in this IPA. You see, we specifically brewed it NOT to last. We've not only gone to extensive lengths to ensure that you're getting this beer in your hands within an extraordinarily short window, we made sure that the Enjoy By date isn't randomly etched in tiny text somewhere on the label, to be overlooked by all but the most attentive of retailers and consumers. Instead, we've sent a clear message with the name of the beer itself that there is no better time than right now to enjoy this IPA!"; "Our all-important, hop-driven quest to deliver the most devastatingly fresh IPA on the planet facilitated a paradigm shift in 2012 with the launch of Stone Enjoy By IPA.

Get your hands on this dank, golden beauty before everyone else gets wind of it."; "There is no better time than right now to enjoy this beer."
I Pop!ped the cap & debated as to an aggro pour or a gentle one. I went with the latter, followed by a vigorous in-glass swirl. This raised just under three fingers of dense, rocky, foamy, tawny head with good retention. Color was solid Amber (SRM = > 7, < 9) with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled like a bag of sticky, resinous dank had been dumped into my glass by way of the bottle! I rarely indulge as I have gotten older, especially while job hunting, but I can easily recognize the smell. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste had a unique bitterness, ranging from tropical fruit to bitter citrus fruit to resinous pine with a bit of cattiness thrown in for good measure! Whoa. I wonder why my hophead self never bothered to review this before, Finish was dry, hoppy & a good way to kick off 4-20 Day.
Praise be to Greg Koch & the rest of the Stoners! I have long been in Greg's ear about all sorts of wackiness, but at least their beers in CANs has come to fruition. 
Yo, I'm about to drop the mic on some Enjoy By 07.04.17 in a CAN, yo! 
From the CAN: "Defiantly Independent"; "Enjoy Now!"; "Brewed to be Enjoyed within 37 days"; "Our all-important, hop-driven quest to deliver the most devastatingly fresh IPA on the planet facilitated a paradigm shift in 2012 with the launch of Stone Enjoy By IPA.

CANducting a Crack! & inverted Glug is just like riding a bike - once you learn, you never forget how to do it. I was doubly heartened by the fact that this one was marked as being "Unfiltered". No need to be gentle when the lees, particulate & flocculate are supposed to be in suspension. Two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, foamy, tawny head with moderate retention & I was there. Color was a deeply-hazy (but NOT cloudy) Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose smelled of ... pineapple?!? Wow. Actually, pineapple & ruby red grapefruit, which is just a little sweeter than standard grapefruit. Mmmph! I think that I just creamed my jeans. Mouthfeel was medium, light for the style. The taste was actually surprisingly sweet with pineapple being the primary & underlain by the semi-sweet grapefruit. 8=O Finish was only semi-dry, making it all that much more drinkable. This could be dangerous. 4,457 characterswoodychandler, Apr 20, 2017

L: Bright , clear gold.  Beautiful fluffy off-white head that has some excellent retention.  
S: Grapefruit, dank pine, leaf tobacco.  Smells super clean if that makes sense.  Refreshing to the point that having this after work seems brilliantly relaxing.  
T: The grapefruit takes a back seat, the dankness of the pine shines out well.  Leafy hop also shines strong too, this is very refreshing.  Really impressive flavors.  
F: Medium body, good carbonation that's crisp.  Some hop oils remain on the tongue.  Semi-dry but in this case its nice.  
O: Wow this is just an impressive beer.  Stone continues to blow me away.
Update: Got my hands on the next batch, Enjoy by 5/29 (Memorial Day) tasting this on 5/3/17, bottled on 4/22/17 so only 11 days old.  
L: Same.

22 oz. bottle poured into a be here.
An aggressive pour yielded three fingers of white foamy head that was reminiscent of a root beer float. The mostly clear, rich coppery golden pour left thick and gooey lacing whenever I tilted the glass. The nose was strong and somewhat pungent, predominantly grapefruit and pineapple with an underlying base malt aroma. The taste, again a little pungent and fruity with moderate hop bitterness. There was an ascending grapefruit 
bitter sweetness (that I haven't experienced or noticed in other IPAs) that quickly faded into a bitter finish. I would call it medium bodied and smooth and I found the carbonation was just about right producing only a slight tongue bite at first. Well done! I am looking forward to the next release 788 charactersBJB13, Apr 18, 2017

L: Beautiful amber color poured to YETI, medium sized white foamy head, good retention, solid lacing. 
S: Bold and sharp aroma, fruity hops, grapefruit, very nice!
T: Taste follows the aroma, flavorful, bold, strong, thick, exciting, fruity, hop forward with a pleasingly rich, lightly bitter pine finish, malt is just right. Bottle says "Devastatingly Dank", I agree.
F: Chewy liquid, medium to full bodied, resinous. Not boozy at all for a 9.4 abv.  
O: Very unique and awesome, every sip an experience and keeps getting better throughout the session; one of those beers that you never want to end. Even though I like the Tangerine version better, I can't think of a regular DIPA being any better. Also shared one with a friend, his first ever DIPA, and he really liked it; he didn't realize a beer could smell and taste like this... World class. Also paired very well with a Perdomo Craft Beer Series cigar! Life is good! 967 charactersALHOPLOVER, Apr 15, 2017

4.45/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip
Appearance: this is without a doubt the brightest beer I have ever tried. Golden with no haze whatsoever. The head is bright white with poor retention. The short duration of the head is what prevents this beer from scoring a 5 in appearance.
Aroma: dank hops. Pine and pineapple.
Flavor: mouth-coating lupulin. Super hoppy, oily. There is little malt backbone – just hops. The label states “10 different [hop] varieties”; there are no specific hop flavors. No specific fruit, pine, etc. No alcohol flavor or heat.
 Mouthfeel: this is heavy-medium, heavy even considering the 9.4% abv. 
Overall: damn tasty. This is far better than most of the 2X IPAs on the market. At $16.99 / 6-pack, perhaps the price exceeds the quality, but this is a damn tasty and worthwhile beer nonetheless. 813 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Apr 14, 2017

L- Thick soapy slightly off white colored head that stands one finger tall,with good retention and sticky lacing.Hazy amber colored body with a gold hue,low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,light amount of sediment.
S- On the nose I get citrus hops consisting of mango and peach,with some pine and floral hops as well.There is also a nice dank aroma to this IPA.
T- The palate follows the nose with citrus hops up front ( mango and peach), floral and spicy hops in the middle,and a bitter pine hop punch on the back end.Dank after taste to it as well.
F- The mouth feel is medium with a sticky texture.Medium amount of oxidation on the tongue.Slightly dry yet smooth finish,with a somewhat chalky texture after the sip.
O- This is a very good IPA,I wish I had picked it up at an earlier date,it probably would have been even better.Can't wait for the next version to come out.Highly recommended to IPA lovers,and hop heads. 1,058 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Apr 13, 2017

S: [4.00] Big pineapple and dank notes.  Peach and mango.
T: [4.50] Spot on.  Mango, pne, dank resin, pineapple, orange rind, sweet malts.
M: [4.50] Thick and coating.  Nice carbonation level.  The bitterness is just right. It is there and lingers but is not overwhelming or distracting.
O: [4.25] I like the concept of making the name of the beer the drink by date.  But it is not just a gimmick - this is a great beer.  Tons of fruit flavor and aroma wrapped with dank notes.  The body is nice and there is NO hint of 9.4% alcohol.  Overall this is a fantastic IPA. 716 charactersfscottkey, Apr 10, 2017

Redolent with orange, citrus and pine.  
Heavy on the hops up front of course, but plenty of fruit juice, caramel and spice to balance.  And if that weren't enough, there's an encore wave of honey-like bitterness to finish. 
Goes down medium and smooth, but you will not forget it's weight.  
A complex and timeless DIPA for old school hop heads. 439 charactersstephens101, Apr 08, 2017

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75After having this beer on tap (today!), I believe this is easily the best IPA I've had so far.
It looks awesome in the glass, with a nice, dark golden orange color and a creamy head.
The smell is very tropical with citrus and pineapple right off the bat; the most wonderful hop aroma I've smelled so far.
The taste is exactly what you get in the nose, and the hop bitterness hits you in the front of the tongue but doesnt follow through to the back(which is nice), and the flavors invite you to sip some more (which I did!)
The feel is very smooth, not really heavy but not too light at the same time, very easy drinking for the 9.4%, which I couldn't even tell was there.
Overall, I'm glad that this was the first Stone beer I've tried, because we do indeed have Stone beers in Texas stores, yet I was afraid to try them. This is what a go-to double IPA should strive to be like. I'll definitely drink this again! 914 charactersBullyy56, Apr 07, 2017

Nice head, great clarity, and an outstanding nose.  Citrus and strawberry and dank.  
Huge taste.  A big, juicy, citrus hop bomb with a malt center and a piney finish and aftertaste.  A lot is going on here.  This is delicious and is eminently drinkable at nine point four. 356 charactersdaliandragon, Apr 02, 2017

Smell-4.25- citrus hops, mango, apricot, peach, boozy. Sweet malt mixing with the hops, but hop forward. Clean ferment smell. Retronasal follows up with the dankness.
Taste-4.75- follows the nose, sweet citrus up front with sweet fruit like mango and melon following up with a boozy taste. Lots of complex hop flavor melding with the malt sweetness. Dank hop bitter lingers but not overpowering.
Feel-4.25- medium carb, over medium body without being too heavy for the style. Alcohol warmth builds as pallet warms up. A slight creamy carbonation feel, not spritzy.
Overall-4.5- one hell of an ipa! Will buy again and again. No question. 729 charactersMitchmoore12, Apr 02, 2017

bright clear amber with a nice white head
some good lacing and the head breaks down
 but stays around.scents of pine are strong and fruit 
 notes as well. dank hoppy scent  noted
pine, orang and grapefruit tastes, not real zingy
 on the tongue.just a tad of sweeter fruitiness with later sips
dense , chewy mouthfeel.but a clean finish.nothing lingers

In the aroma, I get lots of citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon), a decent amount of the dank, but, not quite oniony vibe, and a nice touch of caramel malt. In the flavor, nice waves of hops and malts that alternate back and forth from sweet to bitter, ending with a pleasant bitter note. Dank is mostly what I'm picking up in the flavor, which is great, but, I think the nose gives off a little more in the way of the citrus. Still, a very tasty brew. The feel is, above average carbonation, full feel, a little oily up front, and, quite dry on the finish. I can see why it's in demand. Nice stuff. 691 charactersmatcris, Mar 26, 2017

Nice and Dank and just as good as previous editions.  This one is full of bodied, floral and nice and smooth. Had that creamy feel to it that I've come to expect. 
Stone has me hooked and I will be there for the next batch .   Keep it flowing boys I can't get enough. 345 charactersRabbleRouserRye, Jan 22, 2017

Over all the good ones overtake the bad and for this I give it a 4.25 overall rating. Also trust the bottle and enjoy by the date on the front of the bottle. Not much later than that date can alter the overall feel and integrity of the beer. 346 charactersErikshegda1994, Jan 20, 2017

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5By far my favorite beer I have ever had. I mean...come on people. It's amazing. Takes a lot to get 5 star ration across the board. Look is a fantastic light golden haze with bubbles and awesomeness. Smell is like I'm peeling a grapefruit or maybe an orange or maybe a star fruit/grapefruit/orange/tangerine/mango-hybrid. Just incredible. Taste is basically the same as the smell. Just outstanding. Seriously world class stuff here. As far as west coast American IPA's are concerned this is the cream of the crop. Mouthfeel is just outrageous. Crisp, clean, smooth, thick enough to really set the flavors into your tastebuds, light enough to wash away after a moment or two after swallowing. Overall this is probably my favorite beer of all time, and each iteration is just a new and exciting version to sample, every time a new enjoy by comes out it's a nice diversion to a different aspect of the original profile without changing so much as to be unrecognizable as an enjoy by. I look forward to each one, especially the unfiltered editions. Thank you stone!! 1,061 charactersPhilsadvns, Jan 14, 2017

Appearance: Pours amber-golden in pint glass, with heavy white suds but with a small head and little lace.
Aroma: Brilliant tropical hops, with citrus, pineapple, mango…absolute hoppy bliss!
Taste: Strong on the bitter note, with tropical hops yumminess emanating through. Definitely a potent imperial IPA, with bitterness lingering in the finish. A stunning IPA and wholly delicious. 474 characterssecondtooth, Jan 07, 2017
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I've had many iterations of this long running IPA series.  Six in total, ranging from 10.31.14 to 10.31.16.  My favorite was 04.20.15 which was had the best overall aroma and flavor.  My rating of 4 is the combined score from all six I logged on untappd.  In my opinion, this serious has run over due.  It was a great idea, and they've proved their point.  Its time to move on to bigger and better things. 405 charactersDrvitlkeyustolit80, Jan 06, 2017

smell - piney and fruity
taste - nice balance of bitter with peachy fruit at the top, piney notes and sweet malt
feel - slightly on the thinner side of medium i would say
overall - highly enjoyable, i'd buy it again.  very fresh taste, smell and feel - the hop flavors come alive, all nicely balanced 368 charactersc_tails, Dec 20, 2016

4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Look:  Brilliant and crisp golden orange color.  Not a huge head like expected.  1-2 finger head with a fairly rough pour.  Head dissipates rather quickly, but has a nice 1/4 inch of bubbles continuously being replenished.
Smell:  Not overly aromatic, but has some funk, pine, juniper, and citrus.  Quite a Catty aroma.
Taste:  A decent hop bite upfront.  There is a battle between sweet malt and bitter hops.  The hops burst first with peach, pineapple, and pine.  There is definitely more cattiness in flavor than in the aroma.  The bitterness backs off and then more malt flavors come through.  
Feel:  Light-Medium bodied.  Felt a bit thinner than most IPAs.  
Overall:  Great IPA.  Not the best, but very good.  Not the biggest fan of Catty hop IPAs, but this one is well balanced with other flavors. 809 characterssjdevel, Dec 11, 2016

Look - A gold with a nice white head.
Smell - I detected a nice punch of fruits, mostly oranges and pines.
Taste - The taste is very similar to the smell.
Mouth feel - A quick kick and it was enjoyed.
Overall - I like the fact that they brew dates that are expected to be drunk before a certain day.  This pleases me because it gives you a fairly obvious "drink before date" to experience the best of what the beverage has to offer. 535 charactersh0wdy, Nov 06, 2016

Poured into a snifter glass. 
A golden yellow with a nice one finger of head. Not much lacing from this one.
Smell is mostly grapefruit and some pine blended with it. The pine starts to become stronger after it settles.
The taste goes along with the smell with grapefruit and citrus followed by the pine notes. A little sweetness in there and the alcohol starts to come through. Tasted better about the halfway point.
More complex fell than I expected. The hops finally kicked in with some nice bitterness in there. All of it balanced nicely.
A great beer to have fresh. Not sure this one would age well. 656 charactersKdouble, Oct 30, 2016

Defying the laws of retail beer distribution, the Stone Brewing Company  delivers this release with a label displaying an enjoy by date not far from when some lowly clerkboy stocked the beer. Now, I'm not sure why anyone would buy a case of 4 6-packs and not be able to drink all of it in one night but for such plebians it is probably recommended you stick to more layperson varieties such as Coronas which, from personal experience, can be drunk a good five years from purchase date (a single bottle half-drunk was found behind my fridge after cleaning out my condo and still tasted fine). However, if you're into a fresh boozy beer with a flavor of manufacturing plant still in the bottle you have the King right here. 841 charactersChristianAlexander, Sep 15, 2016

Bottle to pilsner glass. Enjoy by 4.20.15.   I'm a week or so late, but this should still be good.   Appearance: big white head. Hazy medium yellow. Aroma is citrus, grapefruit, light grasses and pine. Taste is mostly hair spray, some lemon and pine. Medium carb. 
Not impressed, though I rarely am by a hyped ipa.

Smell is big citrus/grapefruit rind and pine/resin blend, light earthiness, very heavy on the pine late in the aroma with subtle maltiness.
Taste is similar to the aroma with dominant citrus/grapefruit flavors first then resin/pine/earthy notes late with subtle sweetness form the malt, light booze/ester and herbal note as well. I started my ratings at the 4 range then increased as the beer warmed and i kept pouring more from the bomber.  Great aroma and taste.
Mouthfeel is definitely bitter and fresh at the same time, hop/bitterness level shocks the tongue but the countering sweetness balances nicely, great lingering presence and flavors.
Overall, a great idea and a great beer - beer freshness is a wonderful thing to promote and understand, with IPAs having a short shelf life for some of these fresh and floral flavors. 1,045 charactersmvanaskie13, Jul 06, 2016

Aroma is a burst of citrus and pine, very nicely balanced. 
Taste contains many traits of an excellent IPA, all contained in one beer! Pine, citrus and malt are present right off the bat. The citrus have a sweet, candied quality to them. Good amount of bitterness on the back end, with a dry finish. Definitely has a stronger malt presence than you'll typically see in IIPA's, but its a welcome addition.
Medium bodied and disturbingly drinkable for its ABV.
AFter hearing about this beer for a long whole and finally managing to get my hands on one, it definitely lived up to the hype. 691 charactersmajorbase2, Jul 04, 2016

The beer had a bright, murky orange appearance with some lacing and a thin ring around the glass. Excellent aromas of pine and citrus that really linger in the nose. Taste follows the nose with a bittersweet, citrus beer with plenty of hop flavors. Medium body overall and well carbonated. Overall, really nice beer, especially with its aromas and taste. 418 charactersfitzy84, Jul 03, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Enjoying the Enjoy By 07/04/2016! Actually...enjoy sounds like an understatement. This IPA is fabulous!!
Pours a brilliant bronze and orange color. Nice thumbnail foam head. The lacing is ever present and semi sticky. An attractive drink for sure.
The aroma covers the spectrum of fruity flavors with a constant undertone of biscuity malt. Mangoe, pineapple and all sorts of tropical goodness hit the nose. Midway, the citrusy tones( I'm thinking grapefruit pith) provide some zest. The resiny hop oils add some pungency.
The tropical and citrusy fruit are most noticeable the first half of the drink. Also, the caramel malt backbone is present. Although there is lots of sweetness, the prevalence of hops truly takes over halfway. Citrusy hops, sharp pine needles, resin, herbal aftertaste. Overall, this is a big juicy and hoppy IPA, however, there is some dryness that keeps you wanting more. The body is medium, smooth, the carbonation is soft. So drinkable it's scary! Truly delicious! One of the best! World class! 1,020 charactersGajo74, Jun 30, 2016

I used to love these, but they have really gone downhill, with 10/31/14 being the last amazing one.
This one comes off as all over the place, when i think the aim was "complex". It is very hoppy, very layered...good enough mouthfeel. Little boozy. Little chewy. I think in 2016 this is only a slightly above average double ipa. I do appreciate this release, and happy stone continues to do it. They are never "bad" and always interesting. Im just not sure it needs 27 hops
Edit- i noticed someone else said better from bottle than poured, i agree. My grade from bottle would be solid 4/5 605 charactersIpaBeerDrinkers, Jun 23, 2016
4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a very lightly hazy pale copper in color with a finger of white head. Very hoppy, pine, some citrus, and a bit of tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose and is hugely hoppy, the flavors are somewhat less distinct than the aromas but tropical fruits are more pronounced here but pine and citrus are still present. I get a bit of booze here as well but it's not unexpected given the 9.4% ABV. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer but I will say that I found  it far more enjoyable straight from the bottle as opposed to from a glass. 581 charactersmnj21655, Jun 23, 2016

4.49/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Over 3 days, I've had 3 of these already. I think that says a lot. Looks damn near perfect for a DIPA: bright, golden amber body, mostly transparent, with a foamy 2 finger head. Head dissipates down to a thin layer of foam and a little swirl of the glass stirs up a surprisingly thick layer of foam. Even the last couple ounces still produce more head than some beers I've tried when first poured! Smells of strong, bitter citrus fruits and a hint of pine. Taste is predominantly grapefruit, tangerine, orange, and lemon. I'm getting both the juices and the rind of each fruit flavor. There's some strong pine bitterness buried beneath all the citrus fruit, and a little bit of candy like sweetness way in the background. This is a great marriage of sweet and bitter, really embraces the west coast style of strong bitterness and is much more balanced than some of the east coast DIPAs I've had. Feel has a really nice drying effect from the hop oils, and feels full bodied and with medium carbonation. The one downside of this beer is it gets the tiniest bit harsh as it warms. I drank one relatively quick and the next day let it sit a little longer, and the last few swallows of the one left to sit out had a much more noticeable alcohol presence. Otherwise, this is an awesome DIPA and I'll be on the lookout for the next batch. 1,332 charactersBrokenEdge, Jun 19, 2016

Smell: A strong grapefruit aroma is noticeable the second the cap is removed. After the pour I get strong grapefruit and lemon aromas, with just a little bready malt. I also get a distinct smell of grapefruit slices (the gummy candy). Just a little bit of bitterness comes through as well.
Taste: A mild piney bitterness hits up front for just a brief moment before giving out to a balance of bready malt and citrus flavors. Grapefruit shines through the most, along with lemon, tangerine, and some elderflower-like floral notes. Finishes with a mingling of tropical fruit, pepper, and just a vague lingering bitterness.
Feel: Medium bodied, and low-to-medium carbonation. very smooth.
I never quite understood what people meant when they called beer “juicy”, but I think this is what they're talking about. I was blown away by how good it was. An incredibly well balanced beer, and an absolute pleasure to drink. 998 charactersleap89, Jun 16, 2016

On tap: pours a clear, honey-golden body with a bright white head with good retention. Aromas are lively and potent: huge hops are predominantly citrusy with a healthy dose of pine, and tropical fruit notes like pineapple and papaya feature strongly as well. On the palate initially sugary and pineapple juicy before an electric jolt of hippiness rattles the mid-palate. Finishes with a nice fruit-salad like quality, with some hop oil lingering to remind you of the beat down delivered by the bitterness. A fantastic beer. 558 charactersdroomyster, Jun 15, 2016

Nice balance with citrus flavors but not much bitterness. I can't remember if it was tangerine but it was excellent nonetheless. The fact that this is a iipa really surprised me because it was extremely easy drinking. I tried it on tap in Champaign IL with my graduate so it was even that much better! 406 charactersKeithE, May 27, 2016

Big nose of grassy, earthy, and floral hops.  The taste has much of the fruit and straight bitterness of their mix of hops.  There is a slight green taste in the glass.  Certainly a slick feel and syrupy amount of malt.  The body is a little on the thinner side and carbonation medium at best.  Neither detract anything from the beer; they allow the hops and all of their glory show through.  This was the latest incarnation, 4-20-16.  Each release seems to be close to the same recipe, IMO. 579 charactersphishgator, May 04, 2016

Look- Light cloudy orange, poured 1" head, retained none.
Aroma- TANGERINE! citrus, juicy (smells juicy), lost of fruit ester going on, Piney, Spicy, catty ammonia, and lots of hops
Taste- Started mild due to the temperature of the pour, smooth and easy bitters. as it warmed it became very earthy, dry, piney, dominated by tangerine and fruity juicy palate, nectar
Aftertaste- SO DRY, i liked that. Crisp, malty smooth, almost had a faint sweetness, assertive alcohol presence as it warmed
Mouthfeel- Clean, medium body, medium carbonation, clean, but unfiltered lingering flavors
Overall- Holy DIPA! Intense ale not for the faint of heart or beginner craft beer consumer. Alcohol and fruit flavors overwhelm the palate especially as it warms. 887 charactersSkor, Apr 29, 2016

This iteration of Stone's Enjoy By IPA is a crystal-clear, finely effervescent golden beer topped by a giant, off-white pebbly head; retention is good and lacing is excellent, consisting of thick, fine-grained bands and ladders. The nose is medium in intensity; it leads with biscuity malt, which is quickly overridden by a nice blend of grapefruit and cannabis with hints of perfume and tamarind. Alcohol overtones are deceptively slight. Up front, the palate is medium-bitter pineapple and nutty, caramelly malt; mid-palate, the biscuity malt foundation presaged by the nose shows itself prominently, and the hops expand to include grapefruit notes and a bit of grassiness. Perceived bitterness rolls back to moderate in the face of the malt onslaught, and alcohol undertones are considerable. The finish is a good hit of boozy, nutty caramel, and is modestly astringent; the linger is a surprisingly modest resinous pine bitterness that lasts for awhile. Mouthfeel is on point for the medium body, and is moderately astringent; the texture is slightly creamy and medium-peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

L- Golden color, solid white head with a lot of lacing. 
S- Piney, a little dank and fruity. 
T- Great Balance of malt and bitterness. Slightly fruity (grapefruit and mango). Don't really notice the alcohol. 
F- Medium body, dry finish.
O- I try to grab a sixer of this whenever it's available. Admittedly I've enjoyed (pun intended) some of these more than others, but it's still among the best I've had. 496 charactersZoomslowik, Apr 23, 2016

Pours a deep honey, with a 1/2 inch head.  Head is bright white, has great retention, and leaves thick lines of lace spread out around the insides of the glass.  Very dank, resin smell.  Lots of fresh tropical fruit, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit.  Taste and smell go hand in hand.  A lot of juicy tropical fruits.  This one is an easy drinker, crisp, and refreshing.  Amazing offering by Stone, decent price and readily available, this is world class. 506 charactersbrian44556, Apr 21, 2016

Wow, what a beer! I have not had the Enjoy by 4.20. It sells out fast around here. Now I can see why. The hops are perfectly displayed-pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. I thought the pine and dank were in line with the rest of the hop's flavor components. The grapefruit and subtle resin kick up in the finish, lingering just a bit. The overall bitterness is moderate at best. It starts low and slow, peaking in the finish. But even the finishing bitterness is mellow enough that you don't think twice about going in for another sip. The hoppy bitterness is softened by pleasantly sweet, and light bready malts. There is some caramel in the malt as well. The malt is always present providing the perfect balance needed for a world class beer, which this beer is. I really enjoy the body of this brew too, smooth and slightly coating/creamy. Alcohol is well covered, which makes this a dangerous beer. All of this contributes to a well balanced, harmonious, super drinkable brew. If you have the opportunity, don't pass on it. This is truly a must have if you are an IPA fan. 1,134 charactersmac31, Apr 20, 2016

Aromas consists of tangerine and grapefruit, and slightly piney.
A solid hit of grapefruit on the tongue initially, supported by a thin layer of biscuit and caramel sweetness. Finishes with a strong dose of piney hop bitterness.
Dry with a medium to heavy body. Medium carbonation and just a hint of heat from the alcohol. 
This is another solid and enjoyable brew from Stone. 501 charactersgutbuster, Apr 13, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer poured a lovely shade of golden, with one a crystal clear body.  The head was a little small, barely measuring at one finger thick.  The aroma was  very dank, smelling of grapefruit and pine resin.  The taste was superlative.  I was blown away by the assault of the dank piney and citric hops strong enough to strip teeth enamel.  The hops were backed by simple pale malts that provided just a touch of sweetness.  This was a sticky hop bomb, and coated my tongue, and throat going down, providing a long lingering hop aftertaste.  The alcohol was well hidden, making this very drinkable despite the near double digit ABV.  This is an essential beer if you are a hophead.  I thought I had already reviewed it before now, but I was wrong about that.  You can bet this is going to be a go to purchase for me from now on.

4.20.16 edition, bottled on 3.15.16, enjoyed on 4.08.16.
A- Pours a clear, deep golden, with initial, cascading carbonation streaming up the glass. A white, billowy, two finger head caps and leaves butterflies of lace. 
S - The nose is and floral hops with notes of juicy orange, tangerine, and lemon rind. Almost Belgian white pepper - yeast vibe too. 
T - Resinous and bitter hops dominate, with rounds of flavors (per the aroma - citrus colors) that resolve in a peppery and malty finale. Complex and wine-like. Drink slowly out of wide tulip and savor. 
F - Finishes with alcoholic bite, with a dry, warmth from its 9.4% ABV. Glowing and brandy like. 
One of my favorite beers. 764 charactersAct25, Apr 09, 2016

Quite similar to last year's, in fact I can't pinpoint much change at all, happy this comes out around my Birthday (04/14).
Enjoy!
Enjoy by 04.20.16
I suppose it's the glass we poured into, or the temp, because the last pack I got of these would have ranked much higher, haha higher. But unlike the last this one has an astringent tinge with semi present alcohol taste. Low carbonation and pleasant bitterness that hits the sides of the tounge and roof of the mouth. I feel a slight bit more carbonation could go a long way in hiding the alcohol.  Wish I could say that I'll be buying it again someday. 621 charactersprincessbay710, Apr 09, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 44.20.16 version.
Look (4): A golden yellow and orange tangy looking brew. Exactly what I'd say the sun set looks like. Kind of hazy. A big white heady that is cloudy like in color and froth.
Smell (4): It's like opening a door in your refrigerator that's been holding fresh tangerines and peaches. It's got a lovely citrus and tropical aroma as well as some bacog round caramel malt aroma. Also a very dank weed smell is evident through the whole smelling process.
Taste (4.25): Tropical cut up peaches and pineapples are being thrown at my face. It's clearly got more then one specific hop used in it and the dankness clearly takes hold and doesn't let go. A malty backbone definitely helps a bit with balancing this out, but it's definitely a hop heads dream brew.
Mouthfeel (3.75): It's like licking a fruit with fuzz and then while pulling your tongue away you end up with some cream texture on it. It's definitely lighter bodied then I remember the last version... the aftertaste is never ending #thisiswhybeerisbetterthenwine
Overall (4): A solid 4. Nothing will ever be as good as when you have it the first time around, but I definitely remember the last version being a bit more full bodied and malty. 1,215 charactersivehadthatbrew, Apr 07, 2016

Long time fan of series. Sorry, but this latest batch was a let down. I wanted Devastatingly Dank, what I got was disappointingly dunce. However, still good. Just not nearly as good as previous editions, especially that last unfiltered masterwork they served up. That one was so good I didn't even want to drink it. I hated to see it go.
This one is lacking in body, floral and smoothness. Maybe I was looking forward to it too much and it could not live up to my own hype. Left a coarse feel on palate and went down kind of grainy. Did not have that creamy feel to it that I've come to expect. 
It cost me as I bought 2 six packs of it. I'll get around to drinking it. I had 4 Southern Tier 2XSMASH in fridge that put this Enjoy By to shame. 
I drank that instead. I still will be there for the next batch but this one left me wanting. The beer just came off as nothing special, just an average DIPA.

Pours a clear golden yellow, with moderate carbonation streaming up the glass. An off-white, billowy, two finger head caps it off, fizzling away leaving excellent lacing.
The nose is full of pine and floral hops with notes of orange, tangerine, grapefruit peel and lemon rind. There's a whiff of white pepper too.
When you drink this beer; resinous and unrelentingly bitter hops assault your tongue - scrubbing your taste buds - but ultimately paving the way for a crisp, light and well balanced, graham crackery, malt sweetness. 
There's a touch of vanilla for a moment. Then juicy hops akin to the taste of nectarines, grapefruits and oranges reassert themselves and meld with the vanilla for a deliciously sweet, yet still bitter, orange creamsicle flavored ice cream float type of taste.
Mouthfeel is heavy and sticky. Finishes with a healthy alcoholic nip and a dry, delightful warmth to it. You can tell it's 9.4% ABV.
Overall it can be a little too bitter at times, and the mouthfeel is rather heavy and not what I would call thirst quenching, but it's a damn good IIPA. 1,119 charactersBloodSoakedAleMug, Apr 06, 2016

Beautiful looking crisp beer. Smelled like mango  and tropical fruits. Flavor was a bit bitter at first, but as it warmed up the bouquet of flavors really came through. Nice hop flavor with tropical notes and mango. Very light feel - bit too light for an DIPA IMO, but not distractingly so. Overall enjoyed this one, but probably wouldn't pick it up again. 387 charactersFBarber, Apr 06, 2016

This was the first enjoy by that I have ever had, and maybe it's due to high expectations, but this beer fell short for me. Honestly I had this with another beer because I was like "Really? This is it?" and wanted to compare to something I've had multiple times before. After thinking about it though, I realized I just didn't like this much. It looks great, and smells even better, but the taste and mouthfeel were really lacking for me. I ended up pouring out probably 4-6 ounces of it. 581 charactersrms3434, Apr 04, 2016

From 12oz bottle.
Clear deep gold color. Head fades with moderate lacing.
Moderate bitter smell. Pine. Less fruity than a New England double IPA
Taste is clean, well balanced, not bitter, but not fruity. Stretching it, a sense of a good Scotch and water with some effervescence.
Nice, but not notable feel.
Overall, very good double IPA. Very drinkable. 371 charactersLonborgski, Apr 03, 2016

OHH MMYY
Gold color 
You can smell the Hops before you pop the top. OK not really.......
At first taste "crisp" would be the word. Hoppy?? Oh yes !!
Easy to drink ..which is dangerous at 9.7 % but HEY ! I'm not driving right now, so be it !!
Stone ..... In my subjective opinion, the beer made it to NJ still crisp fresh hoppy and drinkable.
AND for 9.7 and be drink-able?? I'll bet at the staff meeting the beer masters went:
"We're gonna get a few people toasted on this"  HEHEHEHEHEHheheheh"
And ... And ... 
4-20-2016 ??
COME ON man !!! Really........ 4/20 ?!!?!!!
Some dudes just bought it because it just says 4/20 (LOL!)
ANYWAY 
Asking for the "feel " of the beer like in my other reviews is still personal !! IMHO
Continued Good brewing from these gentlemen...

Pours a gorgeous, clear gold with a thin white head that becomes a collar rather quickly. The lacing is spotty and webbed. Aroma is one area where Enjoy Bys typically shine and this is no exception. A lively bouquet of grapefruit, honey, malt, and citrus. The flavor is hop forward but does so mildly, with a round finish consisting of more grapefruit, melon, earth, and rich malt. The finish is wet and clean with a long bitter touch. The hops are not overdone and mix well with the rest of the palate. A great IPA. 579 charactersMrHolden, Mar 29, 2016

Pours a slightly hazy medium gold ale color with the tiniest bit of carbonation. Smell is piney resin drops of dank if that makes any sense, and the taste follows suit with a bold refreshing flavor that quickly opens up your pallet but hides the 9+% deviously well. For some reason it wasn't kept refrigerated by HEB. Great job Stone, concept is a very welcome one in this craft beer market where many a retailer overstocks, ruining beers in the process. 561 charactersHotDogBikeRide, Mar 28, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a golden yellow, which is quite lovely. Head is foamy and white and retains well. Lacing is tight and everywhere. Tangerine, citrus, and dank hops form a juicy, hoppy aroma. Nice juicy dank and piney hop flavors with a bit of citrus and tangerine to back it up. Good balance, which leans on the bitter hoppy side. Mouth feel is a bit harsh on the carbonation side, but otherwise manageable. Not as full as other IPAs either. Overall, a good solid IPA. Didn't deliver as well as I thought it would (my first Enjoy By), but it's still quality. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. Bottled March 14th. Drank March 26th. Enjoy By 4/20/16 version. 639 charactersHarrison8, Mar 26, 2016

Easily the best DIPA that i've had since I got turned onto the style, comes in an absolutely beautiful bottle that you really can't wait to open upon first sighting it in the store. I had the pleasure of spotting one in the singles cooler at my local bottle shop, have waited until i've had a few to give it a review. Pours with a thick white head which settles into a gorgeous thin layer of foam on top of this golden beauty. The smell of tropical fruit is strong and helps mask the massive 9.4% alcohol that you're about to consume. Lifting the glass to your lips, it starts with intense hops and bitterness, finishing dry and boozy as it goes down. Adjusting to the bitterness, you really start to get the citrus notes coming through and it turns into a truly amazing DIPA from a truly amazing brewery. 841 characterscurtisjoseph, Mar 26, 2016

The nose is perhaps a little muted but there is some soft citrus aromas coming through. The taste is better than the nose showed with strong citrus and tropical flavors going on here. The mouthfeel is smooth but there is a little bit of alcohol burn in the back of this. And since this was really fresh it is a better than average beer. 386 characterssmanson56, Mar 26, 2016

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.254.20.16, opened the first bottle a couple weeks ago, this is holding up fine with a couple weeks before the EB date.
Look is clear copper body with decent, off-white head. Dissipates rather quickly leaving some spotty lacing and a thin ring.
Smell is very piney. Dank and resinish, this is dominated by the hops early, with no sign of malts on the nose,
Taste is similar to the nose, except you get a biscuity, bready flavor rather early in the taste. It works really well with the sharp bitter notes. Citrus notes are somewhat hidden, but easily detected when you pay attention.
Feel is excellent, not too heave - which is how I think an IPA should be - but plenty of malt to balance out the hops. Very sticky, long finish. Great!
Overall, you can't go wrong with this one. Its in your face, but well rounded. Alcohol is not prominent, but this is still going to be a huge beer for anyone that doesn't have big beers regularly. 933 charactersGreatStoutman, Mar 26, 2016

An outstanding DIPA, nothing really so special as to put it in that world class category in my opinion, but It is no doubt a very very good IPA.
Enjoy by Unfiltered is a better and perhaps world class beer, but it is a league above this. This is still an outstanding DIPA and my rating is only so high because I took into consideration how easily they are attained versus other outstanding DIPAs of similar class. 465 charactersskeeterloveshops, Feb 05, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy by 2/14/16 - poured from a bomber bottled 1/9/16 into a tulip on 1/24/16
Look: Amber, semi-translucent. A little hazy. Finger of off-white/yellow head. Large fluffy bubbles. Good retention with moderate lacing. Easily roused to a finger-height head with little agitation
Smell: Incredibly tropical and fruity. Mango, guava, peach, apricot. Mild pine and resin but the fruits predominate. Increasing pine character as it warms.
Taste: Typical pine and resin. Nothing surprising. But of orange-juice / rind
Feel: Fairly high carbonation. Deceivingly thick mouthfeel. Fair amount of alcoholic heat but I wouldn't place it at 9.4%
Overall: Great stuff. Absolutely intoxicating aroma and very balanced flavor. My first of the Enjoy By series and definitely not the last. 776 charactersPCole, Feb 01, 2016

Lots of tropical fruit mixes with a caramel malt. Similar in flavor, a nice malt backbone smooth a never-overwhelming blast of fruity and citrus hop flavors. Finishes slightly dry and slightly bitter.
Edit 04/20/17 batch, enjoyed 11 days after 03/15 bottling. Same words as above can describe it, but bumping some metrics. This is so smooth, so not-harsh, and no hint of the 9.4%. I could drink this by the gallon. 530 characterstekstr1der, Dec 31, 2015

Consumed 12/25/15 in tulip 
A:  Saturated golden-orange with champagne bubbles lingering as we slowly enjoy.  Sumptuous, foamy head with substantial lacing.  
N:  Burnt orange rind and pine.  Heady.
T:  Bitter citrus pith,  buttered toast and floral honey.  Balanced between strong, sophisticated hops and warm carmel.  
F:  Sticky, thick and substantial.
O:  Excellent  beer.  Has all the hoppy complexity you want from an IPA  that others pretend to by making their beers too bitter.  Malty Carmel flavor keeps these hops balanced and adds to the complex deliciousness.  A real treat. 608 charactersk8kruk, Dec 27, 2015
4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Enjoy By 12.25.15.   Bottled on 11/18/15.  9.4%ABV.
Bomber ($8.99) poured into a stem.
Look: Pour golden, clean, clear, champagne color. Half to 3/4' white head, that quickly subsides to 1/8" to 1/4" layer that hangs around for a while. A volcano of champagne size bubbles rising from the bottom of the stem. When swirled in the glass a bit, to wake up more of the buquet, it leaves really nice heavy lacing on the glass.
Nose: Upon initial pour the buquet is BIG citrus (grapefruit, orange peel) that quickly subsides and becomes very subtle.  Swirl it a bit and those champagne bubbles wake up!  Some floral notes, perhaps Magnolia, rich yet crisp and clean.  Really opens up as it warms!
Taste: Bitter grapefruit, orange peel, perhaps a hint of green mango, vanilla. Very, very clean and crisp. The bitterness, for me, is by no means excessive or overpowering. Alcohol content very well hidden.  Flavors become richer as it warms.
Feel: Very  light on the tungue initially. The bitterness is very much in the fore and subsides to a slight sweetness.  Very, very, clean, crisp.
Overall: Without out doubt a keeper!  I hope I have another bottle amongst my stash.  It'd be worth a side-by-side tasting with Arrogant Bastard, Double Arrogant Bastard, Tunderstruck and, the standard Stone IPA, to sus out the differing nuances of each.  That's a lot of brew!  Calls for a tasting, with lots of help!  :)

Bottled on date of 11/18/15. Poured from the 22 oz bomber into a tulip on the enjoy by date.
L: Pours a beautiful crystal clear golden caramel apricot color with a solid white head leaving good lacing. Delicate effervescent bubbles continue to rise up to the top. Did someone call for champagne?
S: Wet grassy resinous hops and peach-heavy tropical fruit aromas mingle with caramel malts. Touch of alcohol in the nose. The aroma is rather delicate and not as in-your-face as I like my IPAs to be, but quite inviting.
T: The taste follows as a bigger version of the nose as caramel malt sweetness hits the tongue first, accompanied by a pleasantly sharp but not overbearing punch of alcohol backed up by the prickly carbonation. Tropical fruit flavors of mango and pineapple settle in next and then transition to a dominant peach note, finally giving way to a wet resinous hoppy bitterness that sticks to the tongue well after each sip. Sweet biscuity malts are present throughout and provide a solid tasty backdrop for the hop train. Very nice.
F: Medium-bodied and sticky, and quite satisfying rolled across the palate. Carbonation is excellent and the bubbles are going straight to my head not halfway through the bomber.
O: This is a solid IIPA and tastes more complex with every sip as it warms. Devastatingly joyous? Perhaps. Well-crafted and delicious? Definitely. Great job, Stone. Will enjoy again next cycle! 1,488 charactershavron, Dec 25, 2015

3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Look: Clear, and deep gold in color. The two-finger white head disappears right away, likely due to the high ABV. 
Smell: Bready malt mixes with honeysuckle and a somewhat tart,  meaty smell. It's not stomach-turning, but it certainly doesn't hit the spot. Makes me wonder if I'm too close to the end-date? In the background, light citrus hops are subdued by caramel. 
Taste: Once the palate grows used to the intense taste of honey and butterscotch,  resinous hops and a soft, bready malt make their presence known. In spite of the sweet notes, there's a moderate bitterness accentuated by spicy peppercorn. 
Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a creamy, satiny finish which still retains some dryness. 
Overall: The well-balanced taste is the highlight here, and while it's not a mind blowing beer, it's delicious enough to be undeniably worth drinking. 881 charactersBethanyB, Dec 24, 2015

Look: the beer pours a light orange color, white head with a good amount of carbonation. Some alcohol lacing on the glass
Smell: I get some tropical fruit, I think pineapple, and then a little malt. Maybe some dankness. Pretty nice
Taste: similar to the nose, pineapple for a short second, a little malt, and then a grapefruit bitterness
Feel: dry, and bitter through most of the drink. Medium mouthfeel.
Overall: a nice offering, but I've had better for sure. Maybe a few weeks earlier this would've been a lot better, but it reminds me of this years Abrasive from Surly 621 charactersCfred371, Dec 20, 2015

ABV is well hidden.

Pours crystal clear with a nice bright white head.  Lots of lacing.  Smell is unremarkable.  Moderately sweet up front, followed by a sharply bitter back.  Bitterness is akin to grapefruit peel.  Has a great texture and weight -- crisp due to great carbonation with a medium body.  
This is a great beer, but lacks aroma.  Tastes very good, but that 'something special' is missing to make it a great beer. 463 characterszizouandyuki, Dec 18, 2015

Smell is peach, grapefruit, and light caramel malt, with taste following almost identically, which is a commendable feat. Taste adds a touch of resin.
This is usually a well balanced IPA for Stone, who sometimes likes to go overboard with bitterness. Some alcohol does make itself known.
Most recent: a 7/4/16 fresh on draft in the first week of June. Can't add or subtract anything significant for 4/20/17. Maybe a little breadier, and also, somehow seems like a wet hopped/hop harvest brew, with lighter, more floral notes. 603 charactersSabtos, Dec 17, 2015

*First 'Enjoy by' for this fella. Pretty stoked.
Eyes: A light golden color. Poured with a 3 finger head. About a 4 minute retention. 
Nose: Pine, mango, tangerines, hibiscus, white grape. Very sweet and herbaceous. 
Taste: Very sweet. Honey syrupy goodness. Grains of paradise is prominent (even if it wasn't used). Coriander and lemon zest on the back end.
Body/Feels: Thinner than I thought. Sticky and boozy. Although the 9.4% is masked very well. I would have pinned it closer to 8%.
Overall: I was hoping it would be a little more on the piney/bitter end of the IPA spectrum. But for being on the other side, its very good. You can't go wrong with a stone IPA, and the Enjoy by Series seems to be top-shelf, and decently priced. If you're an experienced beer (IIPA) consumer, this won't knock your hops off. But its tasty, refreshing, and damn good.

22 oz brown bottle
Bottled 11/18/15
Served in a 20 oz Samuel Smith's glass
Pours yellow into the glass with a bronze tint. A thin white head forms on top and quickly begins to leave trails of sticky lacings. The lacings become webbed as they cling to the side of the glass.
The nose is magnificent with whiffs of citrus fruits and a bouquet of fresh flowers. 
My first sip unveils a sweet and syrupy biscuit backbone and then comes a full blown hop assault on my palate. Flavors of clementine orange, key lime, lemon and Ruby Red grapefruit. There is also black pepper bite and hop resin presence in there too. 
The mouthfeel is awesome, this is a hop bomb masterpiece. 701 charactersHibernator, Dec 12, 2015

Emptied the bomber into a chilled glass and was pleasantly surprised at how well the head held up (considering it being an IPA). Color is on point with what you'd expect from the style: Orange/amber.
Smells pleasant, reminds me of a christmas tree. Great flavor with Pine, Citrus, and a slight Floral after bite. 
Overall a fantasitc IPA - - - Has that fresh hoppy flavor you'd expect, yet isn't overly bitter, which gives each one of the flavors a chance to be noticed. 530 charactersDevWand, Dec 12, 2015

Look: A light amber color with very little head. Typical for the style.
Smell: Holy dank! This beer smells as piney as a Christmas tree. Picking up a ton of tropical fruit; papayas, mangos, pineapple maybe some stone fruits and a ton of grapefruit. Smells great!
Taste: Amazing. Super piney and fruity! Getting a slightly floral note that isn't as pronounced as the tropical fruits. Delicious!
Feel: Feels pretty typical of a double IPA; slightly chewy and very mouth coating. Drinks really smooth for the relatively high ABV. 
Overall: Stone really hit a home run with this beer! With a little more refining, this beer could compete with the likes of Pliny and Heady Topper. An amazing feat for a large brewery. Glad this beer is widely distributed and not entirely expensive. 820 charactersTHSmusicman, Dec 09, 2015

Got them proprietary tropical fruit hops working to the bone here.  Good stuff.  Super dry mouthfeel and taste, hops seem to be in the amarillo/citra/simcoe vein.  Not a lot of bitterness.  Alcohol easily covered up.  Damn good stuff, no need to chase small bottle counts when Stone kills it like this, especially in the six pack format. 502 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 09, 2015

Clear, orange/golden with a beautiful white creamy/foamy head.
Scents of fruit, tropical, mango, pineapple, citrus, pine.
Amazing smell.
The hops are noticeable in the taste but not overpowering.  An amazing IPA.   The clarity, the smell, the taste, the mouthfeel.... its all there.  Also the alcohol is well hidden.  Tastes like a 7% to me.

Aroma: Full of tropical fruit, dank piney hops, and citrus (guava and slight grapefruit). The sweet malt is apparent in the aroma as well, but comes out more in the taste. 
Taste: Phenomenal and full of piney hops, tropical fruit, and citrus with the sweet malt rounding out the profile towards the end.

A great Imperial IPA, heavy on the tropical fruit - mango, pineapple, passion fruit - mixed with a healthy amount of dank piny hops, on top of a sweet, malty body. This beer kind of reminded me of Pliney the Elder, but it was not nearly as balanced (the bitterness and alcohol were a bit rough around the edges) and the texture was not as smooth. Other than that, an excellent beer. 447 charactersMarius, Dec 07, 2015

Look; Crystal clear gold with two finger white head, plenty of lacing after a quick reduction.
Smell; Dank, piney with a slight cat pee scent that often precedes top notch IPA's.
Taste; Well balanced.  A quick melding of pine, citrus and then malt.  The flavors seem to blend as you drink.
Feel; Creamy, very pleasant to drink.
Overall; A top notch DIPA, deceptively smooth for a 9.4% beer. 435 charactersSFNC, Dec 06, 2015

L - Bright orange color wit maybe a hint of green.  Off white head is thick, with an oily sheen.  Significant lacing.
S - A citrus and pine extravaganza on the nose.  Toasty malt on the final edge of the whiff.  
T - Massive hit of bitter hops as orange and pine, accompanied by a late sweetness from the malt.  In the finish the hops return as a strong, almost eucalyptus-like burn.
F - Medium body with creamy, mouth-filling carbonation.  Huge hops bitterness blends into a significant alcohol burn.  
O - Everything about this beer is huge and flavorful and right.  It becomes more deep and complex with every sip. 710 charactersRadome, Dec 05, 2015

The 1st glass was fresh & crisp with no noticeable ABV and it almost resembled a "session" beer because of it's drinkability. SCARY because it is actually 9.4%! 2nd glass was with spicy food and it held up to it fantastically. This beer shines tremendously with the addition of food. The hops are clean and cut through perfectly with out being overbearing. This is a beer that seems OK until you get further into it then it shines. Excellent and a perfect spicy food paring! 518 charactersFranklinPaine, Dec 05, 2015

Smells strongly of citrus, tangerine sweetness, and generally sweet bread. 
The incredibly sweet nature of the smell, is subdued in the taste by the bitter nature of the hops and malt. Mouthfeel is quite light, but not overtly so. As expected out of a beer which prides itself on its freshness, this is quite juicy. Although, this is definitely more dry than some of its competitors (Surly's Wet comes to mind). 521 charactersWer34truh, Dec 02, 2015

Smell is tropical fruits and biscuit malt.
Taste is tropical fruits mango grapefruit hop resin and very good amount of biscuit malts.
Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation and a slightly wet and bitter finish.
Overall a very nice DIPA that hides the 9.4% abv quite well so steady on.
I did not enjoy by 10-31-15 it five days past that. Great beer anyway. You can reform the head anytime with just a swirl of the liquid. 503 charactersSpikester, Nov 06, 2015

Appearance:  Briliantly clear, golden color with one finger of bubbly head that fades slowly with nice lacing.
Aroma:  Pine and grapefruit rind over sweet, buscuity malt
Taste:  Big malt presense up front, a little chewey, with building earthy and pine bitterness.  Theres a big hit of tropical fruit before the finish, which is quite lingering with pithy bitterness.
The Rest:  At 9.4%, this is definately in IIPA territory with a body to back it up.  Great aroma, but lacking a bit of balance. 517 characterscurasowa, Oct 31, 2015

Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
LOOK: Pours with a finger's worth of white foam that halves itself after 1 minute. Yellow in color. There is an abundance of both medium and large sized bubbles rising towards the top. Lacing is thick, but moderate.
SMELL: Has strong aromas of floral hops, mango, papaya, apricot, and pineapple that entangle with mild aromas of grapefruit, orange, piney hops, and bready malts along with hints of bitter hops.
TASTE: Strong floral hop, mango, papaya, apricot (no pineapple, though... I suppose not every IPA can be a Yellow Rose) flavors enter initially and are immediately followed by mild piney hop flavors. Mild grapefruit and orange flavors come onto the palate next along with subtle bready malt flavors. Subtle bitter hops and a hint of alcohol finish off this delicious symphony as all previous flavors persist, except piney hops, which grow slightly stronger.
FEEL: Somewhere between full-bodied and medium-bodied. Moderately carbonated. Goes down somewhat smooth and finishes with a horribly strong dryness (please get me some water).
NOTE: What an amazing Double IPA.  It wasn't overly bitter and the 9.4% could barely be tasted. The major downfall in this brew was the mouthfeel. I will definitely be buying the next Enjoy By. 1,310 charactersMyotus, Oct 28, 2015

A light golden honey color with an off-white, eggshell color.  The smell is super fruity and tropical, guava, peach, pineapple, onion and garlic sweetness, mango, marijuana dankness, pine, grapefruit rind, honey malts.  Nice balance and a great aftertaste, not too bitter.  Its like drinking the leftover juices from the fruit salad deluxe from a company christmas party.  Lots of tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, guava, citrus, dank resinous qualities, bubblegum, candied orange, clean malt sweetness.  Haven't had this beer for a while but it was a great reunion.  Only picked up a single 12 oz. bottle but its enough to hold me over until the next batch comes around. 757 charactersCzarkazm, Oct 26, 2015

S-Floral and citrus hops are wonderfully fragrant. The aroma is almost intoxicating. I should have bought a six pack, even though over $18.
T-God, I love this beer. Very well balanced, yet complex. Hops are aggressive without overpowering the taste buds since it is balanced by a delicate malt sweetness that is absolutely delicious. A real treat. No bitter after taste and alcohol content is hardly noticeable for its 9.4% ABV. Extremely well constructed.
F-Very smooth and extremely well balanced. Carbonation is perfect.
O-Dangerously smooth given ABV. Tastes great cold and as it warms. 755 charactersvelosuds, Oct 25, 2015

Pours with a small white head and golden color. Nose is hoppy, fruity, some tartness, pine. Lovely. Taste is tangerine, hops, resin, grapefruit and orange pith, and tropical fruits. Very little alcohol detected. Finish is rather dry and begs for another sip. Hard to believe this beer is 9.4%. Wonderful balance between the hops and malts. Usually, with high abv DIPA's, I always seem to notice some green onion and garlic. Not here. Very impressed and this might possibly be the tastiest Stone offering I've had. 621 charactersBeertsipper, Oct 21, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a six pack while in New York State. Enjoy by 10.31.15. The reputation of this series precedes itself, so I had to buy while I saw it. Served at cellar temperature into a pint glass. Bottled September 24, 2015 and Enjoyed October 20, 2015.
Appearance - A moderate pour yielded a clear dark golden cooled beer with minimal bubbles. A finger and change of long lasting white head rests on top. Good rings of lacing left behind. 
Smell - tropical explosion on the nose, with an underlying dankness to the beer. Plenty of citrus with pineapple and mango being the stars and some support from oranges and grapefruit. Quite inviting and tropical.
Taste - pronounced bitterness to start which quickly turns sweet. The deliciousness of ripe tropical fruit hits the palate in all sorts of appealing ways. A slight booziness to the flavours, but it's not too pronounced.
Mouthfeel - smooth, sweet with modest carbonation. Not quite sticky or cloying but the flavours will definitely settles in the corners of your mouth providing long lasting satisfaction. A little hot to finish.
Overall - everything comes together in a way that is a little greater than the sum of each of its individual parts. Honestly one of the best double IPAs I've ever had, and enjoyed fresh this is delicious and delightful. A definite must try. 1,325 charactersDenisKolkin, Oct 21, 2015

Beautiful in appearance, a translucent dark orange with a voluminous snow-white head despite a somewhat tentative pour. The aroma from the bottle was piney, but once into the glass the hop presence was muted. On the palate, some sweetness up front followed by a bitter, resinous finish. There seemed to be a lot of hop oiliness and bitterness without much of the actual hop flavor. Too close to the enjoy-by date? I don't know. Not the hop bomb I was expecting, but a pleasant enough offering and very (too?) drinkable for the high ABV. 623 charactersdcotom, Oct 21, 2015

Poured a nice light-amber color with lots of carbonation and a decent, lingering head.  It leaves prominent lacing over time.
I would describe the smell as a floral lemon-lime with a touch of hoppy pine.  It is a sweet smell, for sure.
Taste follows the nose, I got a lot of floral and sweet/citrus fruit, bitter hops, and both alcohol and a touch of spiciness on the end.
Mouthfeel is,,,not thin.  Pretty much what I would expect for a good double IPA.
It's a great DIPA with very delicate flavor notes inside the overwhelming fresh hops.  I will be getting more, personally. 611 charactersj4mmin42, Oct 20, 2015

Nose is big, fresh, piney hops. Flavor is similar; big, fresh, piney hops. Not surprisingly, the malt is almost nonexistent. Not a balanced beer, but a delicious hop bomb, as I'd expect from Stone. Maybe not the most complex IPA I've tasted, but a tasty one. Really a delicious, fresh, brew. Would have again. 400 characterssoupyman10, Oct 18, 2015

Great looking brew.  A lot going on in the aroma, floral and fruity, pine notes, touch of alcohol.  Very clean taste of toasted malt, resiny pine and flowers. Balanced well but leaning on the sweet side, a little different than I recall the earlier batches which I believe we're more dank and hop forward. But could just be my palate after so many great DIPAs. Mouthfeel is thin to medium but slippery. Semi dry finish, bitterness lingers just right amount, tad of alcohol comes out. This is a very good DIPA that's readily available when it hits, always have to try it. 681 charactersNolaHopHead, Oct 16, 2015

Medium foam with sufficient lacing, golden-yellow color with a copper tint. 
Floral and piney on the nose, very rich aroma. Includes citrucy and exotic fruit, some earthy leaves and berry. 
Huge biscuity malt complemented by piney and citrucy notes. Possibly cascade and amarillo hops among many others. Malt is complex and well-balanced with the hops.
Rusty on the tongue, a bit hot, and puckering sensation from both alcohol and hops. 
overall, a solid IPA with a great aroma that will satisfy most hopheads, but could work on the malt profile. 618 charactersretry4z, Oct 15, 2015

The color is the standard grain colored gold with a white head and a short statured head, and from this we catch touches of a bright and weedy smell. Grassy memories of soccer matches as a kid and clumsy face first tumbles into the turf are conjured here in the scent, with some spurts of pineapple juice, and even a bite or two of fresh, peppery mango. The flavor is milder than expected, given the nose, with a balanced mellowness. The intensity of the flavor is flat and predictable, consistent from beginning to end, but hoppy and well colored. It's that Stone hop profile that's practically Koch's signature, but it works well here, with all its marijuana and orange overtones, and once again, I am inclined to drinking this well before its date. 858 charactersGarrettB, Oct 15, 2015

The aroma offers breadiness, white sugar, light peach, pine, resin, hints of dankness.
The flavor follows with sugary sweetness up front, hints of pineapple and grapefruit, pine, intense resinous bitterness throughout, medium plus bitterness with lingering resin, pine, and herbal. Hints of alcohol come through as well. Mouthfeel is medium.
Sweet, pine, resin, sugary sweet candy. Quite drinkable, but flavor is weak compared to newer aged East Coast brews. 506 charactersdar482, Oct 14, 2015

L: Tangerine orange with slight carbonation. Cool amber hue that you can see right through. 1 inch head that dissipates after a few minutes
S: Smells magnificent. Clementines, pineapple, grapefruit, papaya a citrus bomb, with really no hint of malt.
T: Tastes even better than it smells. After having Heady and Focal Banger and a handful of delicious New England IPA's and DIPA's this is a refreshing West Coast style Double. At an insane abv. of 9.4% there is no presence of any alcohol whatsoever. This beer is a straight citrus bomb that tastes like an orange julius. Taste's like a Tree House Julius but even better.
O: This might be one of my favorite beers, I can't find a single flaw in this and I am really surprised that this beer is not rated higher. Crazy how drinkable this 9.4% beer is! 930 characterscaptainsdaughter, Oct 13, 2015

Enjoyed on 10.9.15 in a Belgian tulip, mission accomplished. Pours a deep hazy amber-gold with two fingers of frothy white head that leaves a nice cap and lots of sticky lacing. Smell is an interesting mixture of fresh cut grass, pine, bitter citrus, peach, and cat piss.
The taste brings an interesting medley in line with the nose. The first impression is dank and grassy, followed by some floral/tropical sweetness, and finally a sharp bite from the resionous pine. Juicy. The light caramel malt is subtle and balances the hop flavors well. Medium body, medium carb with a slightly oily feel that coats the palate thoroughly. There's no mistaking that this is a big beer, but it drinks surprisingly smooth for something north of 9%.
Very very good and I look forward to having it again. Doubt I'd ever want to buy a whole six-pack, but will certainly grab a single here and there when I see it. 918 charactersglass_house, Oct 12, 2015

It's about $3 for a 12oz bottle which would make you think i'ts up there with the big dogs well it might be for lots of people but not for me maybe it's because I haven't much high alc tolerance but it just seems like the overall it's something that doesn't fit my agenda. I like by beer a little easier to drink since I live where the climate is hot most of the time so I appreciate something that is not as strong so it goes down easy and I can cool off. It's good to have at least once though to get a feel for robust beer which in my opinion this is. 623 charactersyoucantmakeme, Oct 12, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Look: Perfectly clear golden-colored beer with a perfect white head that dissipates into a thin film. Not much lacing, but a solid appearance nonetheless.
Smell: Citrus, onion, cannabis, mango, and Nelson Sauvin's grassy white wine cattiness, backed by a general tropical-ness from the Galaxy dry-hopping. Yum!
Taste: Follows the nose with some maltiness as it warms, which works well as a backbone for all the intense fruit flavors. The reminds me a lot of 2015's Gubna, which also utilizes Galena hops. Very good. Galaxy is definitely more in focus taste-wise than aroma-wise, which is great. Juicy midpalate with solid bitterness on the backend. Very well-done.
Feel: Medium+ body makes for easy drinking, despite how quickly the ABV sneaks up.
Overall: Another fantastic Enjoy By. My only other experience with this series was a small sample about a year ago and I don't recall it being noteworthy. This one is. Definitely seek it out. 943 charactersOnemoresolo, Oct 11, 2015

Just about the perfect look for a dipa. Smell is very aromatic with the obvious hoppy floral you would expect with hints of spice and onion like notes. The taste hits right away with hops and bitterness. Some maltiness as it warms, but not quite as much as you might expect. The feel is spot on with a creamy initial feel and slight carbonation. Overall this is a stone beer with plenty of hops but it drips right off into the bitterness and I would hope for a bit more complexity. Not dissapointing but not the best I've had. 620 charactersBenGap, Oct 10, 2015

10/31/15 edition, poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip style glass.  Pours a beautiful deep amber color with a half finger head that quickly dissipated.  Smell is very pleasant, not too intense especially for a double IPA.  Taste is truly excellent, wonderfully hoppy and piney without being too intense.  There is a Wonderful aftertaste that sticks with you, almost bring out some fruitier (?) notes the more you savor.  Mouth feel is very smooth, and the beer is not too effervescent.  Overall a wonderful beer, and one of the better IPAs I have had yet. 589 charactersnomad93, Oct 09, 2015

3.51/5  rDev -20.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Went to the store looking to get a 4 pack of Double Jack and came out with a six pack of Stone Enjoy by 10.31.15 instead - cost a little over $18 after taxes. I will start off by saying Enjoy By has always been hit or miss for me. Anyway, onto the categories
Pretty slow pour into a Spiegelau IPA glass: 
Look [4.5] - A nice deep golden color with plenty of white, butty head. Absolutely no bubbles flowing up - not a big deal. The color is what you'd expect from a standard American IPA - good head retention and lace following the glass quite well. You wouldn't think this beer is 9.4% abv judging by the appearance.
Smell [3.75] - An orange/mango aroma followed by a spicy, bitter aroma. Mimics the taste quite well.
Taste [3.25] - This is where the disappointment set in for me. As the beer hits your tongue you get a splash of orange and mango followed by pure hop bitterness. As someone who considers themselves a hop head, I welcome the occasional bitter bite, but in this beer, it seems to be a very sloppy transition. As the beer warms up, the bitterness is prevalent from start to finish, which actually improves the taste and you get a more complex hop flavor, still not much malt, which I can understand that this is the nature of this very time sensitive DIPAs.
Feel [4] - Great mouth feel. Just enough carbonation combined with a slight creaminess - this really saves the beer for me. The beer goes down quite smooth despite the absolute hop-dominated profile. Really love the mouth feel.
Overall [3.5] Not a bad imperial IPA by any means, but considering the price tag, this beer is nothing special. The well balanced mouth feel is the real  standout for this beer for me. The taste is what you'd expect from a Stone Enjoy By DIPA - hops, hops, hops. As much as I love double IPAs, I tend to rely on some malt backbone - even as someone who enjoys a pungent hop taste, the lack of a malt presence really leaves a bit to be desired. I wouldn't recommend picking up the 6 pack if you're looking for a good DIPA. I wish I had picked up the bomber instead. This beer is pure Stone - lots of hops. That being said, unless you let the beer warm up a bit, you won't taste the or notice the 9.4% ABV whatsoever. Letting it warm up, there's a slight heat to it, which I do enjoy. Otherwise at 35-40 F this beer is deceptively drinkable for anyone well versed in west coast IPAs. 2,390 characterssentimetal, Oct 08, 2015

L: Nothing remarkable.  Frothy white head, which dissipates.  Nice golden sheen, a note darker than your typical lager.  Little bit of lacing.
S: As soon as I popped off the bottlecap, I could smell this beer.  Straight up fresh hoppiness   In the glass, there is a really nice maltyness.  Hop aromas are very floral and sweet, as well as fruity aromas.  No alcohol aroma either
T: As good as the smell, sweet, fruity, and floral.  Almost juicy in nature.  Malt is present and quite welcome to bring everything home and provide balance.  So tastey
F: Definately a little biting bitterness, but it is so well balanced.  Actually surprised by how easy this one goes back.  Smooth as hell
O: An awesome beer.  Straight up really impressed with what Stone is doing with this beer. 799 charactersedward_boumil, Oct 08, 2015

Starts off with a pitch perfect golden appearance and wonderful frothy white head. Fresh is certainly what the nose screams of, incredible grapefruit an floral aromas smack me in the face. Very grassy flavor, unexpected but not necessarily unwanted. The flavor still hides some of those tropical citrus notes but they take a backup role for sure. Creamy, and sticks in the mouth but does not overstay it's welcome.
Everything I had heard about "Enjoy By" was certainly backed up, the grassy flavors are not what I am used to in an IPA but it works incredibly well with the grapefruit and tropical fruits. Going to be picking up more of this while it is still fresh. 685 charactersfoundersfan1, Oct 06, 2015

Look: Awesome golden color, with a pretty good head. A good amount of lacing left on the glass
Smell: hops are very forward, smell of grapefruit time. A bit of alcohol comes with a rustic smell.
Taste: I get some grapefruit, a bit of some of some grassy notes. I also get some citrus, with a little bit of alcohol burn on the back end. But for basically 10% beer can't really complain.
Feel:Very nice Feel, all almost a bit oatmeal creamy, with a medium carbonation. Great mouthful.
Overall: I was expecting more of a troptical bomb, the grassy citrusy Is a new taste for me on this beer 601 charactersBeergasm1, Oct 03, 2015

Coloring is a light gold and pretty much see-through as the beer is well filtered. The hop aroma is very strong from the start (when opening the bottle). There is a decent amount of citrus with added spices (maybe cracked pepper-basil combo?). There is some malty sweetness but it is not overpowering at all. Overall this is a great offering from Stone; fresh, hoppy beer! 434 characterstregan_20, Oct 02, 2015

Look:  Amber color, quite clear, with a inch or so of foam that dissipated rather quickly leaving lacing. 4.25
Smell:  Hoppy, with a very slight fruity aroma, followed by a pungent smell that is a little less than appealing.  3.5
Taste:  The taste starts with heavy hops, then shift to an earthy grassy flavor immediately.  The resin taste then comes into play alongside lemon, with a very very slight citrus note that can be easily missed as the hops begin to dominate the aftertaste. Overall very grassy and a bitterness that tastes slightly burnt.  3.5
Feel: Some carbonation but not too much, goes down smooth and has a good body.  4.5
Overall:  I was expecting it to be better, not into the heavy grass lemon mix.  3.75 791 charactersaceseth13, Oct 02, 2015

Dank, aromatic hops, with citrus undertones - tangerine most prominently.  The palate of this beer follows the nose, with a thick, dryly hopped forepalate being mellow by a sweetly piny orange-fruit finish.  Palate is middle of the road and complements the beer tremendously.  An exceptional IPA.  Balanced, even in its extremity.  A world-class representation of the style. 578 charactersLAp, Sep 13, 2015

While there is another category for the larger "Enjoy By" series, it is my belief that each one is different, so that is why I am reviewing this particular one.  That, plus it's my birthday!
Poured into an over-sized glass, it came out the color of the approaching Fall, a late-September Orange like you would see on the descending leaves as they touch the Earth.  A simple sniff both from the bottle or the glass will pronounce the Hops which are evident, a West Coast IPA, and in keeping with Stone's excellent tradition.
The 9.4 ABV is not all that noticeable due to the complex flavors which seem to hit your mouth simply by tipping the glass in the general direction.  A perfect pairing to the smell, the taste too is dynamic yet understood; defining in one glass the last 36 years of my life.
Overall this beer is a perfect transition from Summer to Fall and from 35 to 36.  A six pack may be asking a bit too much but one in the afternoon certainly couldn't hurt.  It looks, smells, tastes, and feels smooove, a remembrance of things past and what awaits in the future.  
As is the case every year, good things come on September 2nd... 1,237 charactersWestCoastLibations, Sep 03, 2015

Small swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, tropical fruit, earth, and slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet citrus juice, citrus zest, tropical fruit, berry, and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with fantastic fruit forward hop characteristics that make this one a treat to drink. Great job, Stone! 657 charactersDaveDay5, Aug 18, 2015

4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Stone doesn't make my favorite style of IPA, but they do make a damn good one, and the Enjoy By series is one of their rare moves that goes beyond gimmick (unlike the Enjoy Afters) and guarantees a fresh IPA.  So yeah, not much here that you can't get from their regular IPA or even the Arrogant Bastard which are both easy enough to find, and popular enough that, due to high turnover at most beer shops,  you shouldn't have trouble finding a fresh one.  But it does have nice holiday coincide-ance so you can say, "Hey look I'm drinking the 7/4 bottle on Independence Day!," but at that point we're going back to gimmick-mode, which Stone does quite a lot of. 661 charactersjmasher85, Aug 05, 2015

A truly outstanding beer from Stone right here, I was expecting a lot from this one going in (particularly given how much the bottle cost) but it definitely delivered and then some. There was tonne of hops and bitterness to kick things off with some touches of alcohol appearing too but it still managed to remain drinkable and well balanced with a really refreshing and highly drinkable palate; this one was well worth ever penny I paid for it. 489 charactersflyingpig, Jul 21, 2015

Edit - Just had the 10-31-15 edition
MUCH better!! Super fresh. Dank, chivey, hints of tropical (peachy/pineapple) and hints of citrus. Don't get much of the 9.4% ABV although a little sweet, still goes down super easy. Very much enjoyed....one of the best Stone has to offer. 481 charactersTonyjenlasc, Jul 20, 2015

Look - Pours murky amber with a frothy two finger head that leaves a good amount of lacing.
Smell - Grapefruit pith galore with a good dose of maltiness. Very floral and mostly hop forward.
Taste - Like a three way. Dominant grapefruit on the front met in the middle by malt and a mango finish all splitting of and returning slowly and in a galaxy all their own. None taking direct command over the other.
Feel - Exceptionally juicy, though light with medium carbonation.
Overall - Ever passed its date, a top tier DIPA with loads of flavor, very sessionablr with no alcohol presence. Fantasicalexpealidosich 664 charactersRaime, Jul 16, 2015

After breaking the seal on the 22 oz. bomber, a smell that is uniquely Stone engulfs the room: a former roommate of mine would probably call it “dank” and I wouldn’t necessarily disagree (keep in mind that he also used this word to refer to girls, burritos, parties, and – as expected – weed). Citrus fruit and pine resin quickly follow the initial fragrance of fresh-cut grass. At first sip, hops and booze smack your palate (in the playful bad-girl way that a Las Vegas stripper smacks a bachelor). Fortunately, the 9.2% ABV brew is balanced by its earthy character and fruit-forward nature, so the bitterness does not overwhelm. So Crisp. So Delicious. So Fresh. So Clean. ♫ –♫ — ♫. Time to listen to some Outkast and relish in the genius behind this beer. 842 charactersljjpowers, Jul 15, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. 
LOOK: Clear gold with a finger of eggshell white head, that leaves rings of lacing.
SMELL: Holy hops!  Super dank, juicy, and tropical.  Grapefruit, apricot, peach, pineapple, earth, grass, onion, pine, and resin.
Taste: Follows the nose for the most part.  Tastes of a mix of citrus and tropical fruits--grapefruit, orange, apricot, peach, pineapple, papaya, passionfruit, guava, and mango.  Takes a sharp turn for acidic, oniony bitterness on the finish, but then smooths out nicely leaving a citrus-pine aftertaste in your mouth.  Alcohol is present but barely noticeable for 9.4% abv.
FEEL: Medium-feel, crisp carbonation, with a long resinous finish.
OVERALL: Ridiculously good double IPA.  Buy it fresh whenever you're able! 776 charactersHorseheadsHopHead, Jul 02, 2015

The nose obviously screams hops with a earthy pine taking the lead, followed by floral and citrus notes.  There is some caramel malt around the edges trying to fight it's way though with minimal success.  Now on the taste those malts do come forward but are still surrounded by pine resin and citrus fruits and finished with a even bitterness.  The mouthfeel is nice and makes the beer quite refreshing.  Looking forward to having this again. 592 charactersSvingjo, Jun 30, 2015

However.... my biggest complaint with this highly- distributed beer is that it taste totally different on tap than in a bomber. When the experience is that different between a bottle and bar... I'll take my $$$ somewhere else. If you see it on tap... go for it...! On the shelf... knock it off the list... but I could put that $8-$10 to so much better use...! 391 charactersfulcrumbs, Jun 28, 2015

S: Juicy, ripe fruit, background of bitterness, some pine.
T: Wonderful smorgasbord of fruits. Orange, lemon, passionfruit, a lot of other stuff. Sweet malt, just an undertone, almost like honey or caramel. Mint/pine on the finish. Nice and juicy.
M: Light-medium body. Light prickle of carbonation.
O: My kind of IPA- lots of fruit, bitter but not cloying, highly drinkable but with high ABV. This is not just palatable, but enjoyable- is Stone relenting on the hardass destructive IPA styling? Or am I a hardass now?? 606 characters1000lbgrizzly, Jun 19, 2015

Look: Crystal clear pale gold. Finger or two of head has nice retention.
Smell: Dank hops, earthy malts, and lemon citrus
Taste: Exceedingly bitter plays nicely with the alcohol, nearly masking it entirely. Grapefruit from the start turns to lemon by the finish. Certainly very dank. Very much like wet straw.
Feel: Excellent body. Slightly dry finish. Carbonation dances about the mouth long after the finish. Very refreshing.
Overall: Really great. Always a must get when it hits my shop. Not a whole lot to criticize this beer for. Its right up there with some of my favorite beers. 609 charactersDikfour, Jun 14, 2015

Straw colored and the off white head lasts the entire time leaving behind layers of lacing.  Aroma smells of light citrus, pine, and grass.

APPEARANCE:  pours a clear, golden color with one-finger off-white head, excellent retention, the head slowly faded until a thin, unbroken layer of small bubbles remained, significant lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.
SMELL:  pine resin, grapefruit, bread, some pepper, I can also smell the alcohol.
TASTE:  the taste follows the nose, initially some sweet citrus and bread then a piney hop blast, the 9.4% ABV is clearly present.
PALATE:  medium body and carbonation.
OVERALL:  this is a beautiful looking beer but not the best tasting IPA, a little too boozy for my liking, I can only enjoy one in a sitting, I like the concept of having freshness date in the name just wish the beer was better, this beer was terribly overpriced at $16.00 for a six pack of 12 ounce bottles so I'll not be buying this again. 909 charactersHoppyBastard, Jun 13, 2015

There is so much discussion regarding inconsistency from batch to batch and the mysterious onion taste.  I have had every batch in Delaware distro for past three years. IMO - the past 12 months have been incredibly consistent.  A juicy citrus has complemented the (devastating) dank more recently in both bouquet and taste.  Mouthfeel and appearance has always been off the charts.  Drinkability is amazing.  3 years ago I assumed a great marketing approach led to over-inflated scores.   But this is without doubt one of the best IIPA’s out there. 567 charactersTheWolf, Jun 13, 2015

A:  Nothing too special.  Vibrant clear gold with 1/2" of off-white head that recedes pretty quickly.
S:  Amazing, breathtaking.  Huge grapefruit & citrus with a nice oily hop character underneath.  A bit of biscuit & malty sweetness provide counterpoint, but the fruit is the star of the show.
T:  Grapefruit, lemon & lime peel, cinnamon, brown sugar, pine, black pepper, grass, hop resin, exceptionally well-defined bitterness that seems to focus on woodiness & a hint of onion.  Holy moly.
M:  Moderate carb & a big malt body do the job perfectly.
O:  My only complaint is that this brew is just too drinkable. 695 charactersMUTINY, Jun 12, 2015

 The 4-20 version of Enjoy By usually is the highlight of the series, right? I was disappointed with my first bottle of this because the green onion thing was missing. However this version has totally grown on me and I have purchased 9 six packs so far and consumed 6, drinking almost no other brand, and also drinking it in excess, which normally I don't do to my self standards.
I have like a Dostoyevsky writing bent for these reviews. My tasting notes are worthless and even trying to compete makes me feel like maybe I should be stuck on Sierra Nevada. The high end citrus thing and the well done malt and yeast thing and the great drinkability make it dank. It reminds me of the moment I realized sativa is better than indica.
I cleared out the remaining stock of retailer1 tonight and will see what retailer2 has tomorrow. Thanks Stone, I hope this isn't the sewage one. 964 charactersrockaroo, Jun 11, 2015

12 oz. bottle into a tulip. Pours a very clear golden with a moderate amount of carbonation. 1/2 a finger of white foam initially, but quickly dissolves down into a thin film. Dank, piney, sticky aroma on this beer, with a hint of sweet fruit. Light weight and a very lively mouthfeel. Dank pine and hop bitterness right away on the taste. A little bit of grapefruit middleways, but this beer is all about the hops. More dankness and pine resin on the back end, with an earthy bitterness left on the aftertaste.
Overall, not bad, but nothing like what I expected. This beer tastes like liquid marijuana, at least to me. I usually love my IPAs more pine-forward, but this one was different from any I've ever had. Definitely an A beer, but I'll admit I'm slightly let down. 794 charactersdo_ob, Jun 07, 2015

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Seems right the dankest IPA they have made so far is set for 4:20, it also happens to be my birthday and there have been two before, each having a significant date for myself as the enjoy by - this is the third I've had and I'll be damned if it doesn't follow the third time charm (not to say the first two weren't awesome).
A:  Pours a foamy sloth that keeps its creamy head, but dissipates into a crystal clear golden straw color.  There's a few rising streams of tiny bubbles, and it looks oh so inviting.
S:  Ho lord I cant wait to try this, it smells like passion fruit and pineapple with slight tangerine.  I'd say Nelson Savin is in there, along with some other New Zealand hops, the sexy lupulins that they are.
T:  Holy damn, there is so much hoppiness and boozyness laying on you all at once that it smacks you - but in a sexy bad girl way.  The malts are clearly here as a necessity because they are surely not the life of the party.  There is so much boozyness in this that it tastes like it was spiked with vodka or Sake - but, it does serve to peel the layer of hoppy stickiness that comes with it.  It's like eating a chocolate lava cake, the richness or sweetness alone would be too much, but with the balance of the two extremes - it's got you thinking seconds.  Those tropical hop notes really do come out in a way that mellows everything back to being on a Caribbean island drinking fresh squeezed juice from local fruit bounty - if those fruits also had obscene amounts of alcohol in them.
M: This is  a full body DIPA through a trifecta, maybe even a quadfecta.  The FG needed to balance the booziness give physical body while the limited carbonation doesn't pull any tricks trying to mask the heftiness.  Then there's the alcohol tang which lets you know this isn't a game, you could equate it to a heavily spiked glass of jungle juice kinda feel.  Lastly, the hopiness sticks to your tongue until the next sip utilizes the booziness to wash away that dose, only to be replaced by the newest gulps worth. 
O: It's a full circle beer that hop heads will enjoy the whole way through, from opening and admiring, the first waft, each individual sip, to the final drop.  This is absolutely one of the most pinnacle IPA's, let alone DIPA's, I have ever had the pleasure of coming across.  It's intense and out on a mission, and that mission is to show just what a DIPA can be and do - and be it it does.   Grade - 97
Beware though, this one is not for the faint of heart - Cheers! 2,501 charactersPanda_Brew, May 10, 2015

Stone makes better DIPAS. This one Unbalanced, thick, bitter in the wrong way, RICH instead of REFRESHING, and a lingering aftertaste I can only describe as...unforgiving.

Nose could be more pungent, but excellent dry, pale-malt grainy notes mingle with floral sugariness and hints on limey pine.  The color and flavor match the dexterity of the aroma, but with greater and more assured—though still ultimately mild and measured—intensity: pale, round golden-brown chromatics meet rich, grassy sugars and juicy, soft-touch hops, featuring notes of papaya, nasturtium, and hints of lemon-zest. 
Great balance, great depth, great freshness and refreshment. 560 charactersOrestesMethuon, Apr 13, 2015

A: Dark orange, see through with a nice finger of head. 
S: Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, some danky garlic/onion in the background. Some sweet background notes from the malt.
T: Pop of bitterness right up front. Little bit spicy in the middle mouth with garlic/onion notes mentioned before. Lots of grapefruit and orange peel.
M: Full bodied with a dry finish. Nice carbonation that complements the taste well.
O: Great offering everytime I have it. The fresher the better! 560 characterschrisjws, Apr 12, 2015

3.36/5  rDev -23.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 322oz. bottle split into two snifters.
A - Poured an opaque ambery yellow, thin, short head.
S - The most aromatic brew I've ever laid nose on. Promises of dark fruit, citrus, and wonderful flora entice...
T - ...and totally disappoint. The rich fruit is a little present on the front but is quickly smashed by a bomb of hop flavor and bitterness. I mean "bomb" as in a messy, directionless explosion. Residual bitterness is extreme, and almost seems to step on each successive sip.
M - Certainly not bad. Not too aggressive - it lets the hop presence take care of that.
O - Maybe my taste for hops is underdeveloped, but the extreme bitterness really takes away from the hop flavor here. If it tasted like it smelled, this would be incredible. 748 charactersstompilator, Apr 12, 2015

Nice lacing and good balance between the citrus and bitterness although sort of a sweet fruit forward in the front end. Taste of orange juice stands out in front and not as much "devastatingly dank" as advertised on the label. ABV seems well hidden. I'm not sure if î is really hidden or is it the Lupulin River I had a half hour before. Still a good but not great IPA. 495 charactersrblib, Apr 12, 2015

Aroma:  Fresh cut grass, lemon, and grapefruit quickly fill the nose.  
Appearance:  Cloudy amber pour with a low sticky white head.  Head retention is good.  Appears still in the glass.
Flavor:  Big punchy bitterness up front. Flavors include big lemon, grapefruit, and melon all hit hard.  No malty sweetness at all.  There is some sweetness to it but more like you'd get from grapefruit or orange juice.  Balance is firmly bitter.  Finish is clean and dry.  Aftertaste is a powdery lingering bitterness.  
Mouthfeel:  Medium bodied with high carbonation.  No heat, astringency, or oiliness.  
Overall impression:  Big, bad, and bitter.  Stone delivers and is worthy of the hype.  Glad I tried it.  Worth the special treat. 748 charactersmattcrill, Apr 10, 2015

Tastes of dank bitter hops, and an aftertaste that hints back at the sweet citrus and bread.  The hops are the defining characteristic.  This is a bold IPA to be sure.  Really an awesome imperial that lives up to the hype.  I'll be looking for another sixer of this at the next release. 369 charactersanteatr23, Apr 08, 2015

F (4.25) - Good mouthfeel.  A little bit of carbonation bite, but quite drinkable.  
O (4.5) - I'd never had this one, and wasn't necessarily going to buy it.  But I got a bomber of it . . . Wow!  I'm really glad I did.  I really don't have many complaints.  Good drinkable beer with great flavor.  I will buy more. 668 charactersNickTheGreat, Apr 08, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured 12oz bottle into snifter glass. 9.4% abv. 4/20/15 Version
Appearance- Pours a bright amber. Very clear.  Two finger head and much effervesence below the head.
Smell- Rich citrus qualities. Orange, mango and pineapple. The sweet caramel smell is there but takes a backseat to the citrus aromas.
Taste- Sweet caramel malt, slightly toasted, fades fast into a citrus kick with loads of grapefruit and plenty of pine like flavor as well. Finishes very clean and dry with a lasting bitterness. 
Mouthfeel- Medium-heavy in body with active carbonation. Very smooth and crisp.
Overall- Keyword here is fresh! The flavor profile goes through fast, from malt tones to bitter finish. Freshness definitely adds to the smoothness of this beer. Easy drinking, and the abv is well hidden. Great concept by Stone, and the quality is more than there. Excellent 2x! 860 charactersPA-hunter, Apr 08, 2015

Poured into tulip from 12 oz bottle. Finger of head. very clear, golden straw like color. Smells very floral. Like I buried my face into a pile of whole cone hops. No malts, sweetness or booze. Just hops, yet not overwhelming hops. Taste, well, smooth. Great citrus, floral,piney hops. Slight malt sweetness, but mostly hops. Not super bitter though. I'd say just anout perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is nice; smooth,refreshing, bubbly, slightylh creamy, but not sticky or syrupy. Slight earthy aftertaste, but in a good way. Overall an amazing beer. Cant even tell its 9+ abv. Taste like a 7%. Very smooth, floral hop note, with an amazing hop nose. highly recommend. 685 charactersPatrickBeebe, Apr 08, 2015

Smell – What you expect a dank to smell like. Dirty, YMCA shower before going to the pool.
Taste – Where is the alcohol? Sweet grapefruit taste. Bitter aftertaste. 
Feel – Feels heavier than expected. Filling. Not much expansion.
Overall – I like this dank IPA, but that is what I go for in IPAs. It is a hit it and quit it release. 405 charactersmadelfonatree, Apr 06, 2015

Clear gold -- no cloudiness.  Head made of tiny bubbles, lots of lacing.
Mild fruity smell, hint of onion.  Freshness is noticeable.
Taste continues with fruit, hint of onion, and super dank.  Some malt sweetness peeks through.  Bitter, but not more than you'd expect for a DIPA.
A bit too much alcohol burn on this one for everyday drinking, in my opinion.  Also the syrupy/oily feel contributes to feeling of heft.
If you prefer dank/fruit hop flavors over floral/pine, this could be one of your favorite IPAs.  Very fresh example of that style.  For me it's just a solid option.  I love the clear labelling and hope it sets an example for other breweries.
Also, this is way better than their old DIPA, Ruination.
Update: A year later I had the 2016-04-20, and the quality hasn't dropped a bit. 825 characterscfalls, Apr 05, 2015

This one came a pale gold with a lovely film of head that stuck around until the end. 
Smells of ridiculously fresh hops.  I have not yet found a way to articulate this, but super-fresh hops have like a tingle in the senses that arises from its musky vegetative quality, and this one's packed with them.  There's also an accompaniment of red grapefruit and pine, with a sweet and smooth orange juice beneath. 
Tastes quite similar with seemingly -all- aromatic hops as there is nearly nothing dry and bitter in the finish.  The same tingly-fresh, dank-ass hops are here, with a menagerie of tropical fruits.  There's a very powerful yet intimate encounter with fresh hops going on here that is an utter delight.  
Feels smooth and velvety, and extremely clean. 
What a delight to find on tap.  This is a great example of what an IPA can be. 859 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Apr 04, 2015

I don't know how to feel about this beer. I really like the smell, nice floral notes and a little bit of sweet stone fruit. I like the taste but I expected a little bit more punch from something that says devastatingly dank on the bottle. That being said it is very drinkable and has strong citrus flavors which build up as you drink. Another solid offering from Stone. 387 charactersJackolope, Apr 04, 2015

Pours a light brown golden body with a fluffy white one inch head that lasts. Thin lacing all the way down the glass. Cool painted bottle.(yeah I know the bottle doesn't factor in, but it's still kind of cool.) 
Smell is outstanding !!  Really vibrant grapefruit and pine. This is fresh.
Tastes like it smells.The citrus is out in front with this one.  Heavy on tart grapefruit with just a little pine bitterness
Nice full feel
Overall this may have been one of the best citrus forward IPA's that I have ever had ! 
Freshness really does make a difference ! There is a vibrancy to this beer that the freshness brings.  And the 9.4 ABV ? Oh Yeah ! These folks at Stone Brewing are a bunch of mad scientists that "get it " .  If you are looking for the living embodiment of the phrase "respect beer, look at this one. 1,040 characterspianoguy, Apr 04, 2015

4.89/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This has to be my favorite IPA!!!!!  Tried 2.14.15 for the first time when my friend shipped it to me from San Diego to Chicago (we like to trade beers).  Picked up 4.20.15, and this IPA didn't let me down at all.  After pouring into my glass, I noticed many good floral notes right away.  Had a really nice, thick head on the beer, with a really nice amber color.  The taste was really great as well.  Pick up a really nice hoppy taste, as well as a nice citus grapefruit taste.  Wasn't very bitter at all.  With it being 9.4% alcohol, was very surprised at how smooth this beer is.  Myself and my friends are now huge fans of this beer!!!!! 642 charactersrichwhite420, Apr 02, 2015

Color was a very clear dark gold, with a finger of white head. Smell was beautiful, lots of grapefruit and some pine. Taste was a incredible. I was expecting something with more if a hop kick to it but this beer uses that to its advantage. Without the overpowering hops you get all the other amazing flavors going on. 
I've truly never tasted a beer this fresh and flavorful. Incredible 432 charactersJeffrey-Pulver, Apr 02, 2015

It was more resinous out of a bottle but on tap it was silky. You don't get the bitter until 3 seconds after your sip. What a solid beer.

Amazing west coast IPA smell: danky, piney and fruity. A very pungent aroma that leaps out of the glass. The taste lives up to the smell- a perfect balance of dank, tropical fruit and pine needles. There is a gumminess on the aftertaste that, along with the grapefruit, pushes the bitterness away. The only knock I had was that it's just a little boozy on the back end. I can't wait to try the next Enjoy By. 500 charactersElJacobian, Mar 29, 2015

Clear straw with an orange hue and a huge white head. Pine resin, some citrus and a smack of mango in the aroma, which also carry over to the taste.  Decently bitter -- but not as devastatingly dank as one might hope.  A slight creaminess to the mouthfeel, and a small but noticeable alcohol punch.  This is a good beer, but the bar for great DIPAs is so high these days, it just doesn't measure up. 408 charactersthebeers, Mar 28, 2015

So it is with Enjoy By, which still smells the part, and is by no means unappetizing, but can't reach the heights attained by more restrained brews.

The retention on this one is great, especially for a 9.4% brew. When it starts to dissipate, it leaves rings around the glass as you drink down. On the nose, wow, you can really tell there’s a lot of hops in this one. Mango, Pineapple, Orange and Tropical Fruits hit first, with a touch of Pine and Sweetness from the Malt on the finish. Whilst drinking this beer, the first thing you’ll notice is the bitterness from the word go. On the Palate lots of Pine, Citrus Peel and Tropical Fruit. This is definitely an IPA for warm weather, although it could also work in the colder months as that Alcohol is detectable but not overwhelming. On the finish there’s a few Grapefruit notes and a touch of sweetness from the Malt. The beer is surprisingly smooth, and although starts bitter and dry, finishes sweet with good carbonation. 901 charactersSam-VW, Mar 27, 2015

Yum I don't know what else to say. 
Real bitter, dank and great, if you enjoy big in your face IPA's you will probably love it.  Arguably the best beer I've ever had. 199 charactersdj14365, Mar 27, 2015
4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 44.125/5.  Really torn between the obvious dankness and the obvious skunkiness of 4-20. There is just enough "Heineken green bottle" going on to keep this out of the upper echelon.  Great gobs of bitter and onion on nose but some sulfuric fartage on the end, which IMHO they did on purpose...but I digress...
There is great hop bombadiering on the taste. By far , flavor is the best characteristics of this beer.  A lot of pellety flavor though. My take is enjoy by 420 would have been even better fresh.  ENJOY since sister beer would be what I'd want to try. 559 charactersjbru1971, Mar 27, 2015

Without going too in-depth, I love the mix of tropical fruits and oniony, peppery, spicy characteristics. It did wonders to the palate, and it had me hoping for a limited edition bottle that includes a tongue scraper. Dank, delectable, and overall delicious. Like Daniel LaRusso and Ally with an "I", Stone and hops are a winning combination. Enjoy. 456 charactersTheIPAHunter, Mar 26, 2015

I'm getting tropical fruits, berries, flowery a bit of that onion and grassy smell.  NIce bite up front evolving into a slightly boozy, big hop bomb. Every smell is in the flavor leaving that tongue scrubbing bitterness and some warmth from the 9.4. I love how Stone has no reservations and just serves up a huge double IPA with a take no prisoners attitude. Not for a person that just wants to have session beers. This ones huge! 505 charactersthebrood1987, Mar 24, 2015

The initial smell is great, hoppy, floral, etc. I was so excited after smelling the bottle that I was severely disappointed by the taste. There are some good hop flavors but nothing to impressive compared to other Enjoy By. Then again, every enjoy by is different so I understand that it is hard to compare. This IPA was very boozy in my opinion and lacked the flavor of other IPAs with less alcohol and less price. Maybe my bottle was exposed to light/sun light or left in a heated area for a while. Overall, still a good beer just not worth $7.99.... 693 characters805_YungHopsMcGeeZax, Mar 21, 2015

Wow, this is a pretty excellent brew. I have never had the chance to try this one, as I am from Missouri, when all of a sudden I visited a local liquor store and a stack of this was sitting in between a couple other stacks of 12 packs. It would have been extremely easy to walk right past this and never even know it was there.
This is a awesome IPA, extremely fresh, and tropical flavors and hop bitterness dominate. There is a great level of balance here between those two main flavors. I would have considered this one an even higher rating if it wasn't for a slight pungent onion flavor in behind it all. As it warmed, this flavor became more pronounced and quite present over the other flavors.
Drink this one cold and it is awesome, if it warms too much though, you will regret it.
Would absolutely purchase and drink again.
Bottled Enjoy By Date: 4.20.15
This one is more dank and much more bitter. Still delicious though.
Would Drink Again: Yes
Would Purchase Again: Yes 1,013 charactersJLaw55, Mar 04, 2015

Smells of bright tropical citrus, backed by some dankness and resinous pine, rounded out by a nice floral bouquet and some faint sweet malt. 
Taste is sweet and bitter citrus up front with some mango and grapefruit detected. It has a sticky sweet malt middle with a touch of caramel quickly giving way to resinous pine and thick herbal dankness. This is an excellent double IPA. 473 charactersChickenhawk9932, Feb 22, 2015

4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.53.14.15 - Enjoy By Pi
This is my first Enjoy By, so I can't speak to past iterations. That said, this is a amazing DIPA.
L: Amber hue with crystal clarity. Solid head with really nice lacing.
S: Floral but with nice pine notes. I typically love citrus bombs, but the smell here is really inviting.
T: Sweet malt up front, but finishes with a nice piney, pithy hop bite. Really interesting balance at play with this beer. 
F: Perfect carbonation, I can't believe the ABV is 9.4% because this is easy to sip. Something else interesting about this beer, it's literally mouth watering--the same way fresh squeezed juice is. But make not mistake, it still has a dry finish.
O: I love when beer lives up to the hype, and this definitely does. This style of DIPAs is not what I usually reach for  (like I said, I love big citrus DIPAs), but this is fantastic. Definitely a world-class brew. If you can get your hands on it then scoop it up.
(Updated: I had this beer again 8 days before the drink by date, the booziness was much more evident than the first two bottles I had. It was also much sweeter than my prior two sittings. I guess there is something to that freshness dating.) 1,182 charactersCayseyW, Feb 18, 2015

4.31/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I've had a few of the new Pi Enjoy Bys over the past several days. The interesting thing about this series is that it's actually pretty different every time. This time it's super heavy on the garlic/onion hops, which honestly I don't prefer. It's still a great beer though regardless of where they take it each iteration.
I would really like to see a return to a more floral/tropical kind of thing that they had going on more in the early bottlings, and seem to have less of now, but that might just be my bias talking. 520 charactersCheynem, Feb 17, 2015

Clean flavours too, with a focus on piny, resinous and more petrol-like hop notes. Some slightly solvent-like booze notes. 291 charactersCrazyDavros, Feb 16, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25So I'm having this a day late (2/15, not 2/15). The day doesn't seem to have ruined it. It pours a slightly cloudy orangey gold with a nice white head that leaves some small sticky lacing. It has lovely rich tropical fruit, citrus and floral hops aroma. The taste is restrained for a Stone IPA, but it is still a delicious and well-made beer. The hops flavors are not overwhelming, but blend together well and are supported by a sturdy and subtle malt backbone. Not too heavy on the palate and with just a little bitter bite on the finish. 539 charactersdelta490, Feb 15, 2015

T - Sweet and hoppy, without extreme amounts of bitterness.  Notes of passion fruit and orange peel, with some malt coming through.
M - Medium body, without much burn.
O - A nice pleasant taste.  Not extremely bitter and very refreshing. 417 characterssilverblaze540, Feb 14, 2015

Even at the end of the time period...last day...still very good. All the flavors of great hops, citrus and floral, and strong alcohol just flow right together and fill the mouth will fullness and an easy creaminess.  Nothing stands out but nothing takes a back seat. 
Extremely well made solid IPA. Surprisingly easy drinking. Awesome on tap.  Amazing marketing strategy but easily accomplished with such a great beer. 438 charactershotpauko, Jan 31, 2015

S-quite dank for my liking, but I supposed this constrast to the taste provides interest and appeal
A-golden cleat and light, white head that dissipates to nothing eventually, nice amount of lacing 
M-carbonation right on and does not detract from bitterness and other enjoyable qualities of this beer
T-is it Citra? Mosaic? Simcoe? One of those three comes out to play, I think it's Citra, but I am far from a connaisure. Great IIPA, very drinkable too bad it 'expires'! Highly recommend. 498 charactersSSS, Jan 31, 2015

Light golden color which is unusual for a double IPA, smelled a little bitter and piney, taste was quite good, less hoppy and lighter feel than expected for a double. Didn't linger long on the tongue. Deceptively light for a double, easy to drink. 345 charactersBillT916, Jan 31, 2015

This one looks great, clear gold, white head, beautiful herbal and citrus aroma, strong herbal taste with citrus undertones, and near palate wrecker carbonation and flavor. 414 charactersMDHopster, Jan 29, 2015

Pours straw yellow with 1 finger of white head with good retention and lacing.  Aroma is strongly citrus with subtle tropical fruits.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit sticky.  Palate is robustly citrus and resinous hops balanced nicely against the malt backbone and alcohol.  Nicely balanced DIPA.  Probably the best Enjoy By since the 4/20/14. 395 charactersPliny_the_Self-righteous, Jan 27, 2015

reviewed again for 12/25/15. roughly the same taste but i think this one has a cleaner more pure taste. Enjoy By never disappoints.
Enjoy By 4/20/16.
pours an off-orange with a thick white head.
you can smell this beer as soon as you open the bottle. and once pouring the smell is even more noticeable. smells peachy, maybe some pineapple as well. nice fruit smell, but not the typical grapefruit-y.
i can taste pears, peach, pineapple in this. totally understand how a lot of this beer is New Zealand/Australia hopped. very "down under" hop taste.
goes down very smooth, could drink this all night!!
overall this is always one of my favorite beers. and i ALWAYS buy a bunch of it. the 10.31.15 isn't my favorite of the series but it's still great. i've had multiple Enjoy By's before, i thought 4.20.15 was absolutely amazing. this has a more soft fruit taste.
as always, i cant wait until the next batch of Enjoy By in a few months! always a tremendous beer.
7/4/16 is amazing again, lots of tropical citrus to this. 1,221 charactersWiffler27, Jan 25, 2015

Served cold in a curved "porter/stout" glass.  Beer is crystal clear and medium pale amber in color.  Surprisingly tropical aroma, and fresh, of course.  Courtesy of Citra, perhaps?  Flavor is moderately juicy, builds pine, resiny flavors on top of the tropical fruit/passion/mango notes promised in the nose.  Surprisingly well balanced for a Stone double IPA, too.  I would even say the finish is not totally dry.  The headiness of this brew, along with the corresponding amount of residual sugar, are the only things holding back this otherwise supremely drinkable IPA. 654 charactershreb, Jan 25, 2015

This is always fantastic. Nose and taste are very hop forward with a strong piney, flowery presence. Body is light, carbonation is active. I always grab two or three of these when they become available, totally worth it. 261 charactersZebraCakez, Jan 24, 2015

22 oz bottle, tulip
02.14.15. Edition
A – Light to medium amber and highlighted orange.  About an inch of slightly off-white foamy head with moderate to long retention. Mostly clear.
S – A bomb of grapefruity hops and some bitter citrus, like dried lime.  Lightly grainy-sweet malt with a touch of caramel.  Very smooth.
T – A ton of grapefruit with a touch of acidic bite, papaya and lime zest also in the mix.  Malt mostly provides a strong backbone, light bread crust.  Waves of hop bitterness come in and stay through the finish. 
M – Very high bitterness, assertive, but high carbonation and enough malt sweetness to hold it up.  A hop assault, but a very balanced beer, considering.  Moderate to full body.  Moderately dry.
O – When I think of the quintessential American Double IPA, this is basically what I’m thinking of.  Huge hop bouquet and flavor with strong hop bitterness, and the malt body to hold it all up.  Excellent. 971 charactersinfinitebruner, Jan 24, 2015

Excellent lacing retention. Aromas of pine trees and musk. Lemongrass. Good mouthfeel. Lots of citrus tastes. Nose is all pine and grapefruit. Astringent bitter notes. Mid-palate it breaks to lemons, grapefruit, and some coriander spice. Back palate is a slight cinnamon bread malt and some bitter lemon notes. Lots of grapefruit and a slight alcohol bite. Excellent. Crisp, clean aftertaste. Some more bitter grapefruit and lemongrass. A hint of pepper and spice. 4.5 out of 5. Excellent. 599 charactersdigitalflood, Jan 24, 2015

Pours a clear golden color (lighter than I would have expected), two finger head, noticeable carbonation bubbles. Resilient lacing. Inviting classic citrus IPA scent. Crisp, medium-bodied feel with a little bite from the carbonation.  Wonderful hoppy taste but not overly bitter, has some malt backbone that gives some balance. But still very hop-centric.

Appearance - Bomber poured into a tulip glass. Beautiful golden copper with a nice fluffy white head. Great lacing and lots of clarity.
Smell - Very earthy, fruity, dank, floral.
Taste - More earthy than many IPA's. A little citrus. Not very much grapefruit. Very well balanced beer, not bready but the hops don't overwhelm. A good bit of pine. Reminds me of wet soil and pine in a forest.
Feel - Unbelievably drinkable and smooth. The carbonation bite is toned down a bit which is a plus for me. Sessionable (LOL)?
Overall - An incredible beer. You can really taste the freshness. I love beers that taste pure (no chemical wank, etc.). This is probably the one of the most "pure" tasting beers I have ever had. Highly recommended. 754 charactersCIBoy10, Jan 22, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a beautifully, deep golden hue with extremely good clarity.  White, fluffy head with excellent lacing.  First thing you notice about this DIPA is it's wonderful fruity, floral aroma.  Very interesting flavor that transitions from malt to hop bittering with the PERFECT balance leaving no unwanted aftertaste; it even provides a deep earthy note toward the end that is very nice.  The carbonation is just so so to provide a great mouthfeel.  Interest lay enough, it is 9.2 ABV without tasting boozy.  Drinks like a session, so be careful. Nothing bad I can say, except with I would've bought more! 602 charactersMike-Dean, Jan 21, 2015

Clean fluffy head, clear  amber liquid.
Citrus (grapefruit) forward, strong floral backing.
Following nose with strong citrus front, floral/earthy notes push heavily in through the mid and finish.  No alcohol detectable.  Strong onion end.
Superb mouthfeel, just indescribable how nice this is to drink.
Freshness is key with this series.  Everything is extremely clean and distinct, no harsh transitions or unwanted lingering.  A bit too much onion for me (score dropped a bit) but otherwise excellent. 546 charactersGasc0igne, Jan 21, 2015

Very good IPA right here. Poured vigorously into a Palm tulip with a 3 finger head bursting with the aroma of grapefruit and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very full and filled with complexities reminiscent of grapefruit and florals. The alcohol isn't hidden but is subtle enough to be quite enjoyable. The lacing remains for the entirety of the glass and remains until completion. I will be purchasing another bottle of this before the 'expiration' date. 472 charactersBisco42, Jan 19, 2015

Look: Light amber color with a thin head. Excellent carbonation. Looks like angels dancing! 
Smell: Welcome to the grapefruit jungle! Picking up some piney notes as well.
Taste: Outstanding, this is what we want! Hops and more hops, without being kicked in the head by an unbalanced beer.  Even my wife, who is typically turned off by IPA's, enjoyed this. Maybe it's the fresh beer concept. 
Feel: Just about perfect on the tongue. Nice crisp bitter feel, without the lingering, overpowering, aftertaste many unbalanced IPA's and DIPA's tend to include.
Overall: Thank you Stone. I will definitely seek this one out again. A DIPA that drinks as smoothly as an IPA. Love it!! 869 charactersBreakfastStout, Jan 17, 2015

I consider this as one of Stone's best creations to add to the list of top brews they create. 
Taste: fairly muggy hoppy looking (classic IPA look), nothing out of the ordinary. 
Smell: incredible piney with strong hoppy notes ( much more than their Stone IPA)
Taste: rush of quality hops up front, smooth taste, and great finish for a solid imperial. 
Feel: Ive had a fair share of Enjoy by's. I had their enjoy by 420 ( one of my favorite)
Had another later in 2014. Same feel and finish, but hoppy notes weren't as piney as id hoped. 588 charactersmendo059, Jan 16, 2015

T - Lightly sweet oranges, pineapple and grapefruit upfront with a bitter hop twist at the end to round it off. Strangely, a very welcoming but incredibly faint smokiness develops at the end.

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My all time favorite IPA or DIPA (so far). Huge mouthwatering aroma of citrus and tropical fruits with some pine. The taste will blow you away. I got strong guava flavors which is unique along other tropical flavors like pineapple and mango with fantastic bitter grapefruit citrus flavors to compliment. Nicely balanced with the malt but definitely hop heavy (which is my preference) I just don't want to stop drinking this beer. Better than Pliney in my opinion in smell taste and mouthfeel. If you see this beer, get it, and drink it fresh! 542 charactersIPAs_and_titties, Dec 30, 2014

3.29/5  rDev -25.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25Purchased June 3, 6 days after bottling. Purchased at Total Wine in VA. for $8.49. Color is an amazingly clear, gold color with about two fingers of creamy white to off-white head. Allowed to sit and breathe for a bout 10 minutes, head is now almost completely gone and left in it's place is an average amount of lacing, nothing to really talk about. Aroma is pineapple, fresh squeezed orange juice, creamsicle and a small background of hop pineyness. During the second whiff of this on the second pour, I get a ton of ONION, wow, not my favorite, This aroma changed very fast from juicy citrus to fresh cut SCALLIONS... This version is quite a bit different, IMO, from the others I have had. I get a lot of hop bitterness right up front  and the citrus now takes a back seat. I still get some pineapple, but it is subdued by the piney hops and the bitterness. I definitely can feel the alcohol a lot more than in previous Enjoy Bys. it really bites and lingers on the palate. Finish is pretty short, but the bitterness and alcohol remain for quite awhile and so does the smell of onions, weird !!. Of the three different Enjoy Bys I  have had, this one is my least favorite because of the cloying, persistant alcohol remnants that refuse to leave and the lack of that burst of fresh citrus that were in the others. Overall, nice but not spectacular. Slightly disappointed !
OK, opening another one of these to see if maybe my taste buds were off a few days ago when I had my first one. Pour is the same, with a clear gold color and a finger or two of head. Aroma, this time around is right upfront with the onion and some pineapple. Taste is abundant with alcohol feel and I don't get a lot of fresh citrus like I would like, even though there is a touch of pineapple. This beer is gonna be what its gonna be, a bittery, oniony beer that is definitely not the dank, citrusy beer that was the past enjoy bys..Oh well, gave it a second shot, Ill wait for the next one........ 1,975 charactershophugger, Dec 27, 2014

Been sought after for a few months now after trying most of stones regular releases and reading more and more about this one. Finally found one available in my home town (without an expired date! Chill bumps upon noticing in the cooler!) although if I find another tomorrow( as today on Christmas the store is closed) ,  I will buy another and drink right before i CANT enjoy by!! have very high hopes and I can say..... This beer is magnificent! Beer is an understatement.  From the smell to the Taste this fills all the gaps that other iPas lack, and I didn't even know they were lacking until I endured this HOP /FLAVOR  explosion.I wouldn't even say it is bitter like most iPas as the bitterness is full flavor until it completely fades from your taste buds. It has completely ruined my palate as I have read from others.. This beer sets the bar for all iPas for me at this point. And with an abv in the 9's I'm blown away more like 6's by taste. If u drink iPas regularly do not pass this up you will not regret it!! Can't wait to find another!! Cheers, Kevin. 1,087 charactersIpaupaweallpa, Dec 26, 2014

Deep, rich, bitter flavor. Very nice. Slightest hint of sweetness on the attack is slapped around by the grassy bitterness on the midpalate, never to be sensed again.
Nice mouthfeel, a bit on the richer side, consistent with the huge flavor.
Long, long, subtle bitter finish. Very nice indeed. 398 charactersJeffsta1, Dec 25, 2014

Beer pours a lite copper in color the head quickly disappears and is off white in color. The beer smells delicious, one of the best smelling IPA's my nose has had the pleasure of meeting. IT reminds me of frolicking, through the citrus grooves of California. I have never done that but that's probably what frolicking is like. The flavor comes off as a caramel sweet orange with some tropical fruit flavors. The beer isn't a display of hoppy bitterness tearing at your enamel as much as it is a display of the softer more  sensitive floral flavor and aroma of the hop. 645 charactersi4ourgot, Dec 21, 2014

4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This is an impressive brew. Golden orange liquid topped by a clean white head that is large and slow to leave. When it does it leaves quite a bit of evidence of its presence. Nose has an abundance of tropical fruits and light sweet malty goodness. The two pair to create an olfactory delight . Taste builds from there. Hops hops everywhere and just enough malt to ride. While big and pervasive they are not a grapefruit bomb. Multilayered and multifaceted they display an attention to the smallest detail. The tropical side is dominant when colder with the lovely citrus showing its yellow skinned dry and puckering edge as it warms. In all cases the abv is a "Say What?". You can pound this brew and not know it until you wake up on the floor. Feel is medium heavy with a full creamy carbonation the enhances the overall quenching quality. It just drinks like a session ale. A superb beer in all aspects. I love the attention to the hop construct that drives a brewers vision to create something like this. 1,007 charactersscootny, Dec 19, 2014

Appearance:  rich golden hue with a light haze and a light effervescence.  Head is a finger of frothy ivory foam, leaving a nice lace on the glass.  Not bad at all.
Smell:  fresh, sweet, grassy, green hops; lighter than I was expecting in intensity, but the freshness is just superb.
Taste:  big fresh hops really make all the difference.  Lightly citrusy, grassy and just a little bit tangeriney; quite well done indeed.  
Mouthfeel:  medium body with a good carbonation and a good creaminess for the style.
Overall: this is quite a good beer.  Something about the composition of the hops isn't my favorite, but the freshness and craft quality cannot be disputed.  Kudos on that. 755 charactersflagmantho, Dec 19, 2014

Poured into a clear no marking Can glass
Look- Crystal Clear with an aggressive put it lays down a 1 finger head that dissipates after the first drink or within 2 minutes.
Smell- Fantastic!!! Fresh handful of hops all in your nose, super dank fresh smell. Some pineapple and a left nostril bite of faint fresh tobacco leaves. a teeny bite of mango at the end too.
Taste- Front of the tounge is stingy bitterness, then rocks back to let you taste the hops all the way back, some fruitiness, little vegetal. Over all a fantastic taste. Exactly what i want in a DIPA the 9.4% ABV is hidden so nicely its scary, little bit of malt on the after taste along with a rooftop bitterness that lingers after each gulp. 
Feel- Feels great in the mouth, that heaviness that you want from an IPA but not even close to big beer heavy and liteness you want in a drinkable beer but not bud light light, its that perfect happy medium.
Overall- I love this beer, but i wish it had some personality in the appearance, nothing more beautiful than a hazy unfiltered IPA, this beer would be almost perfect if it came unfiltered that orangeish bronzish gold color would dazzle in my eyes. 
Get ahold of this beer if you can. and buy lots of it. Luckily i got ahold of the last bottle in alaska. 1,359 charactersPintOh1759, Dec 18, 2014

4.96/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Stone has its many lovers and many haters. The haters complain about Stone's hubristic promotional language, failing to realize that it is largely self-parody. The balance nazis also hate Stone's aggressively hoppy brews, even though IPAs are supposed to be hop forward by definition.
So yeah I am generally more on the Stone lover side, and the Enjoy By series is one of the main reasons why. This 12.26.14 version is one of the best:
Appearance: Very nice golden color that catches the light nicely but then is actually pretty cloudy. Gorgeous. Head very nice and a bit thicker than, say, Ruination's.
Smell: Apricot, tangerine, with slightly dank grassy mossy aromas. Palisade hops? Citra? Outstanding and half the fun of these fresh brews.
Taste: Follows the nose pretty precisely, with an unobtrusive but clearly present malt foundation. Personally I find this to be very well balanced, with just the right touch of fruity hops, skunky hops, and malts.
Feel: Drinks incredibly well and smoothly without much hint of the 9.4 ABV. 
Overall: Fantastic beer, and a must try for anyone who likes hops that impart flavors like apricot, tangerine, and tropical fruits along with just a touch of vegetal dankness. Awesome. 1,225 charactersCobrito, Dec 17, 2014
4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Bomber poured into a tulip. Bottle best consumed before Boxing Day. No obstacles there. Dark yellow amber with a finger and a half of creamy, slightly frothy off-white head. On the light side visually speaking. Aroma dominated by tropical fruit (pineapple, guava, mango, passion fruit), tangerine, lemon, and peaches, with a subtle pine undercurrent. There is more pine on the palate (along with a decent blast of booze), with the nose skewing fruitier, although I am still getting copious quantities of tropical nectar and peach. Slight hint of onion. Very light malts, just a tinge of toffee. Comes off as well-attenuated, with little to conceal the generous hop bill. Somewhat woody and herbal on the back end but lacks the potent green notes one can get in less refined fresh hop ales. Less body than expected for such a "big" beer, dare I say on the light side, with just the right amount of mid-range fizz. I am temped to deem this Go To IPA's big brother, although that comparison does not quite capture the nuances. Suffice to say, this is a powerful brew yet somehow sophisticated in its lack of coarse bitter notes or green off-flavors. Nothing but tropical muskiness, citrus rind, and pleasant floral alcohols to nourish the beer geek soul. 1,251 charactersCalgaryFMC, Dec 17, 2014

4.24/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Rating is based on the 12-26-2014 edition, which as I understand it is surpassed by a handful of prior bottlings. That said, this is an extremely enjoyable double IPA which deserves to be consumed fresh. 
Head forms at the width of a finger or two, recedes rather quickly. Citrusy and flowery aroma, candied fruit malts with some tacky pine, excellent bitter hop finish. Not incredibly complex but Stone prices this right and DIPA fans should absolutely take notice. 
No gimmicks here, drink by the posted date and your taste buds will be rewarded. 550 charactersdd43, Dec 17, 2014

A clear golden yellow liquid, a little lighter then expected, lots of little bubbles feed a well sustained two finger foam that slowly falls coating the side of my glass with random lace 
S  big tropical nose on this one, pineapple, guava, mango, peaches, tangerine, lemon, and a little passion fruit, smells massive, a hint of pine, hard toffee and booze but its a total hop runaway 
T  more pine, lots of lemon rind and the booze comes out a little more, still very tasty stuff but it just doesn't quite keep up to what the nose was offering 
M    lighter side of medium, creams up nicely, bitter and gritty with just a little heat going down, pine and lemon linger 
O  solid DIPA start to finish but the nose was a little ahead of the other departments, booze popping up here and there is my only complaint and its a minor one 
I can't complain that I bought this in Alberta but selling it here might be a slight challenge with the ten day window before its "BB" date 1,061 characterswordemupg, Dec 17, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%Enjoy by 12-26-14 edition… Enjoyed on 12/14/14
Appearance is slightly paler than a traditional IPA. However, it is beautiful with its orange and golden hues. 
Aroma was immediate right when I popped the top off. I could smell it from a solid 2 feet away! Beautiful aroma of citrus and tropical fruits. Definitely grapefruit peel and some peach notes. Finishes with a mild honey or syrupy-sweet smell. 
Taste is definitely hop-forward. This is an aggressively hopped beer as is traditional with Stone brews! I get so much tropical fruits and more bitter grapefruit! The oddly addictive taste is the peach and mango flavors. Very pleasant. Middle of the mouth is major hop bitterness that transitions into a moderate alcohol finish. Carbonation is moderate. Recap: major grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors, then bitterness, followed by a warming alcohol. I would highly recommend this dish with something rich. I enjoyed it with a bacon mac n cheese and it was PERFECT! Everything ended up balancing out!
Overall, this was a better version of the Enjoy by. I have had this before previously, but this batch had a much greater emphasis on the tropical fruits, which I enjoyed. The only downside is that the beer wasn’t all that balanced. It definitely hit with the hop bitterness, but it didn’t have enough malt backbone to make it more well-balanced. I’m not saying that it shouldn’t be an IPA, but it needs a tad bit more malt to up the complexity and overall balance. I would rate this a 90/100. 1,512 charactersDaverCS, Dec 15, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%22 Bottle of 12/26/14 in a Spiegelau IPA Glass...
Appearance: Golden with about one finger of head - aggressive pour.
Smell: BAM, right at you before I could even get my nose in the glass.  Pineapple and grapefruit(?)...  Some bread.  Smells fresh...  
Taste: You taste those fruits up front.  Crisp and fresh tasting.  Very enjoyable.  You do not notice the alcohol at all.  At 9+, that could be dangerous!  I could have finished this quick, but sipped it through the first half of the 1 PM NFL games.  Tasty.  
Mouth feel: Slightly sticky and refreshing.  
Overall: A great beer.  I finished the second half of the bottle during the second half of the 1 PM games and into the 4 PM games...  Definitely felt the alcohol at that point.  Great beer. 753 charactersBoozer, Dec 14, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%22oz Bottle of Enjoy By 12.26.14. Poured into a Spiegelau IPA Glass:
Appearance: Clear golden color, a dense head with great retention
Smell: Tropical fruits such as mango and pineapple
Taste: Like most IPA's from Stone, it tastes very dank. The tropical hops come out up front which turn increasingly lemony and bitter. There is some biscuit , but the hops dominate the flavors.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with some creaminess due to the strong head retention
Overall: What I dream for in a Double IPA. The citrus comes through from the aroma all the way to the finish. i look forward to the next chapter in the enjoy by series. 632 charactersSeanPaulZ, Dec 14, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -4.5%Whole family swung up to Plymouth yesterday (13DEC14) to see daughter #1 and get a tree. After cutting a fresh Christmas tree for the first time, we stopped into Biedermans for lunch. I actually ordered a Stoneface IPA, but was served a Stone Enjoy By...  This is the 12.26.14 version, and I believe I was (mis-) charged $4.00 for it.
My shaker pint held a slightly cloudy, bright, medium golden brew. Carbo was slow and scattered, and the head was a creamy, fluffy layer of marshmallow white foam. It lasted well, with some nice stick left on the glass. The aroma had some solid rindy hop action mixed in with some sweet, tangerine-like sweetness. Body was medium-plus, and it was quite smooth going down.
Flavor began with some fruity sweetness; a bit of tangerine and apricot hitting the palate. Then it was mostly hoppage, with some grapefruit and pineapple melding together in a rindy, piney bitter mix, which lingered quite well. Oddly, as the bier warmed it seemed to get hoppier and not more malty. Quite a pleasurable bier!!   Prosit!!

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%In my opinion, these never disappoint. Been drinking them regularly since 2013 and have enjoyed them each time.
Some people say that the Enjoy By series essentially is the same beer each time, and I can see that. Nevertheless, the EB beers, IMO, are among the best that Stone makes. They're very indicative of what the best/better IIPAs are/should be.
What I look for in IIPAs is flavor, aroma, hoppiness/crispness, color, balance ... you name what you're looking for, and you're likely to find it here. The EBs have it all.
Solid 4.5-star beer - thank you, Stone! Keep it up. 579 charactersM_J_Z, Dec 13, 2014

Sticky, resiny hops dominate the nose along with hints of grapefruit, pine, tropical fruit, orange peel, and subtle green onion.  The taste mirrors the nose with dank, resiny, earthy, fresh picked hops along with hints of pine, orange peel, grapefruit, tropical fruit, green onions, and just enough sweet caramel malt to keep it honest.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied, subtly chewy, and extremely oily with a mouth-puckering crisp, dry, bitter finish.  Overall, I've been trying to get my hands on this beer for quite a while, and it did not disappoint.  Incredibly fresh and bold and every bit as good as Heady or Pliny!  Highly recommended! 760 charactersbeerdrifter, Dec 13, 2014
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%Serving: 22 oz bottle poured into an IPA glass (12.26.14 release).
Appearance: Clear, bright gold. Persistent white foam with lingering lace.
Smell: Citrus, pine and some fresh onions and mustiness.
Taste: Caramel malt and slight honey sweetness with layers of hops: citrus zest, resin, herbs and savory vegetal notes. Good bitterness level.
Mouthfeel: Medium, slightly oily body.
Medium to soft carbonation.
Overall: Plenty of good hop notes with balancing malt sweetness, but some off key vegetal tones detract a bit. 524 charactersHipCzech, Dec 13, 2014

A: nice soapy head unbelievable clarity see the carbonation light amber color good lacing on the glass

T: very herbal almost some citrus but gone with a very nice sweetness and an herbal almost spicy but not quite taste
M: has a little bit thicker mouthfeel than most IPAs it's actually quite pleasant 
O: My best advice I can give on this beer is fuck the reviews and just buy it. I've had roughly 6-7 different batches of this, the first time I had it the beer was a citrus explosion juicy and delicious, the next 5 times it had an over powering onion taste that really turned me off. I had about given up on it but then I decided why not. Now it's herbally which is much more pleasant than the onion but I can't seem to get any consistency out of this beer which in my opinion makes for an average beer. However as you can see just buy the damn thing and form your own opinion on this one. 985 charactersSomethingClever, Dec 13, 2014

4.4/5  rDev 0%Stone Enjoy By 12/26, picked up at Mt Airy Liquors on draft. 
Pours a liquid gold, clear and crisp as an autumn day, with a finger and a halfs worth of eggshell head. Mostly tight bubbles, small bubbles rising from bottom of the glass. 
Not getting much on the nose, maybe as she warms, what little I do get is pine and faint tropical fruit hoppiness.
Taste begins with this magical duet of light malt sweetness and juicy hops - as the piney hop flavors develop a sweetness settles in on the tip of the tongue, and the beer goes down the gullet finishing with a nice bitterness and alcohol burn. No yeast flavors apparent, and the malt I'm picking up is light and sweet. 
Overall a damn fine IPA, very well balanced, could have had a bit more complexity with the hops with some stronger tropical or citrus flavors, but overall very solid, very drinkable. This could be my go-to IPA if it were more available. 912 charactersGoingPrimal, Dec 11, 2014

S-Floral, herbal, piney....fragrant....oily hoppiness
T-Big again on the floral/herbal notes...not outwardly bitter....good oily hop flavor...almost noble hop feel at points....a good dose of evergreen like pineyness.
F-Definitely a DIPA in body but not sticky sweet like some...I like the oily hop feel to this.
O-A solid DIPA and my first foray into the "Enjoy By" offerings.   Apparently they change?   This is definitely a quality beer but I wouldn't rate it as high as it sits right now on this site (99) 570 charactersZAP, Dec 09, 2014

This beer looks great golden with orange and honey and a nice three finger head that lasts for a few minutes before breaking.  The smell is mostly pine with some citrus as well and malts.  The taste is high pine hops and a nice malt support.  Mouth is slick, which I found surprising, and carbonation is medium.  
All in all a damn fine beer.  Perhaps the best from Stone 8 have had, and one of the best in the style I have enjoyed. 450 characterspolloenfuego, Dec 05, 2014

This one, like all the others,  poured a golden color that is very clear with a ton of foamy white head. The smell is floral and piney with a bit of citrus. There is a lot of hop flavor up front, very citrusy with a resin finish. This has a medium mouthfeel. I look for each iteration of this beer as it is always enjoyable. 419 charactersMeyers1023, Dec 05, 2014

22 oz. brown glass bottle
$7.99 @ Whole Foods Market, Plymouth Meeting, PA
I felt remiss in not getting to this beer sooner and as I've had it for over a week and I've only got 24 days left so I figured I'd have to try it even though I wasn't really in the mood for a double IPA. I wasn't looking for something heavy and bitter, but if Stone actually went to the trouble to make sure this beer got out so quickly then I owe it to them to drink it !!!
Fortunately for me it's not a heavy, bitter, and alcoholic double IPA. It's actually golden in color, and it's got a medium-full body with a moderate carbonation (kind of English in character). The malt is pleasantly straightforward and just lightly sweet and subtly biscuity and caramelish. Nor is it overtly bitter. Don't get me wrong, it's got bitterness to it, but it's not that harsh and raspy bitterness you sometimes get. What I was in the mood for, and probably what really swayed me towards opening it tonight, was hops - and it's got 'em, but again, I was surprised, I thought I'd find it drenched in resinous, piney, and citrusy hops but it's actually quite smooth and refined. All of those attributes are present but they're not "in your face", even in the aroma. It's also a bit minty, softly grassy, earthy, and gently leafy or tea-like, but the mildly citrus pith and gentle tropical fruit are what really define it in the flavor. It's really rounded and supple, leaving it remarkably drinkable for the style. The one thing that reminds you that it is a double IPA is the alcohol which peeks out here and there, especially as you progress through the serving. Still, this is one dangerously drinkable beast. 1,705 charactersNeroFiddled, Dec 02, 2014

Very good looking beer when poured into the glass but the aroma was a bit weak considering this is a Stone IPA.  Decent hops taste but nothing overly special, but what really turned me off was the soapy like aftertaste this beer leaves behind. Looking back for an extra dollar I could have bought a six pack of some other IPA that's better or at least just as good.  I personally am getting a bit tired of companies thinking that just cause they put their beer in bombers makes it priceless when they don't make the beer itself worthy. 561 charactersLXIXME, Dec 02, 2014
5/5  rDev +13.6%A DIPA that absolutely gets it right.  Too many just don't have strong enough hop flavors and the malt ends up taking over, making them more like a hoppy barleywine.   Enjoy By brings the huge, dank hop smells and flavors that unmistakably put this in IPA territory.   Also appreciate the novel way to focus unavoidably on freshness through the prominent date on the bottle. 374 charactersBikeChef, Dec 02, 2014

A: Very light for a double ipa slightly orange but mostly a blonde clear amber nice lacing and thin head.
S: Fresh Hops, Pine, hints of tropical fruit
T: Fresh hops right up front but not bitter, citrus. Easy drinking for a 9.4% beer
M: Almost spicy with hops but smooth for such a high %
O: Try this beer if you love fresh hopped ales I thought it was delicious and I don't usually go for high % beers. 461 charactersy0tommyb, Dec 02, 2014

The 12-26-14 not so much.  Missing are citrus smells.  It smelled more like an wet sock with a slight hint of skunk.  And the taste wasn't much better.  I actually poured the 2nd half down the drain. 267 charactersdouble_dipa, Nov 25, 2014

Tried to 12.26.14 on draft. Still a great IPA, but did not have all of the pronounced scents and flavors as the 8/16 version.
Recently downed some 4.20.15 - wonderfully dank and piney. Absolutely delicious, and went down too easy for such a big IPA. 443 charactersLouZ, Nov 24, 2014

Also, the beer does change from release to release, but stays in the same vein - very delicious, fresh, floral and slightly piney. If you grab this past the enjoy by date, don't drink it. Remember, they're always releasing new batches so don't sell yourself short. Grab the freshest and go to town. Grab two if you can, and always enjoy with a hops loving friend. Especially if you're a malt person. They'll steer you straight.

Really Amazing clarity of this beer. Impressed by the lack of hop haze given the aroma. Big aroma   maybe simcoe? Has that hint of cat pee aroma but pleasantly fresh. Light malt backbone and big hop resin flavor. Really drinkable fresh IPA simplistic in it's goodness.   -cheers 298 charactersLosMythos, Nov 21, 2014

Not sure if they tweak the contents for different batches, or if I am under the influence of what I ate before drinking this. The hop profiles were, as expected and hoped for, the dominant flavors early and across the tongue. Finish had a little boozy element to it. Would rather that be less pronounced (beer was at good temp, not too cold). Looking forward to next batch.
4.20.14 version: also tropicals up front but with a nice grapefruit in the finish, but with a boozy little pop right at the back announcing the 9+ABV. 645 charactersMisterGone, Nov 16, 2014

Color clear gold with a thick white head.   Nice sticky lacing.  Nose is grapefruit, pine, and herbal hops.  Just a touch of sweet malt.  Flavor is very hop forward on the palate.  Lots of resinous hops and tropical fruit.  Finish is long and bitter hops.  Medium body with a lot of hop oiliness.  A very delicious DIPA that I've had before and will definitely be having again. 454 charactersmr-jj, Nov 06, 2014

Delicious aroma with predominant notes of passion fruit, mild pine and white wine.
Flavor with notes of pine, grapefruit, resin, tea leaves, pineapple, earth, spices, honey and grapes.
Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Alcohol of 9.4% abv is incredibly hidden.
Excellent IPA, yes, fresh does matter. Very well balanced with the characteristic search for perfection by Stones brews. 446 charactersFLima, Nov 02, 2014

I made the mistake once of mentioning to him that there was a lot of stale-dated Stone bottles floating around the Western New York market and it costs someone their job. It's no surprise this be the brewery to pioneer the concept of putting the 'best before' right in the beer's name...
And it's not only common sense that tells you it was a good idea - the aroma makes probably the strongest argument of all. Nevermind the fermenter, it smells like my glass was dry-hopped! Granted, it's not like Stone to make nondescript beers but this bouquet is flat-out over-the-top herbal, earthy, and fruity. There's vividly bright notions of lemon, mango, and pineapple.   
The flavour makes me think of kiwi skins and orange peels; this fruit smoothie has an unmistakably tropical profile. It's not all juice, however - skins and piths clearly made it into the blender too. It also tastes like a handful of matcha green tea powder was thrown in as well. The beer is almost hauntingly dry, with an uncanny synergy between power and quaffability.  
Enjoy By is dank and reminiscent of a wet forest after a spring rain. It has overwhelming leafy and herbal qualities that, especially in the finish, drop onto the palate and detonate like bombs. There is some maltiness to help temper all that bitterness; the grain has a certain 'crunchiness' to it and strong notions of caramelization that mask both the IBUs and the alcohol (9.4%). 
The obvious point about Enjoy By is that freshness matters. The more important thing to take away from this fantastic Double IPA, however, is that Stone cares about how their products are consumed - not just how they sell. No wonder everyone is "California Dreaming" - they've tried the IPAs like this one and, most astonishingly, they don't have to pay too dearly for the experience. 1,906 charactersbiegaman, Oct 26, 2014

4.4/5  rDev 0%Stone enjoy by 7-4-14   A non beer geek friend had this and donated to my fridge. I'm not going to say no because of a giant drink by date on the front!!
A-	Hazy burnt orange color that you can’t see through.  One finger thick cream colored head that was gone quickly. 
S-    A nice fruity peach and mango smell with a hint of berries. Also a mix of wheat, grass and bread.
T-    The taste is huge! Lots of pine up front with a big bitter kick as well. Tasting some lemon and orange peel. I can also taste a good amount of alcohol at the end. 
M-   Crispy and smooth, the alcohol seems to cleanse the palate well and prepare you for the next sip.
O-    Really good, probably better if I drank it three months ago like the bottle said too, but still good.  I like how the flavor profile is so big and each part stands out on its own but somehow remains balanced. 863 charactersMo_fro, Oct 16, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +8%This beer is outstanding.
This was Enjoy By 10/31/14, drank on 10/13/14.  It was a beautiful blend of citrusy hops balanced perfectly with just a touch of malt, but not too much so that the beauty and  taste of the hops is perfectly represented in all phases of taste - initial and on the finish.  
It is all at once so incredibly hoppy yet ridiculously drinkable, don't know how they do it. Thanks Stone. 407 charactersCheshire_Crew_Al, Oct 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%Enjoy By 10.31.14 Poured into a cognac snifter. It pours a rich darker orange color that is fairly clear. There is very little head on an agressive pour and it dissipated by the time I got my computer booted.
Immediately there is a large amount of grapefruit on the nose. A great deal of ascerbic/citrusy scent comes up after that. I only can tell the faintest amount of alcohol which is quite impressive with a 9.4%. I would describe the smell as delicate compared to other DIPAs I have had.
The taste is just wonderful. It is supremely balanced and very easy drinking despite its high ABV and what I would imagine is a high IBU count. It's like drinking sweetened grapefruit juice with almost no sense of the alcohol. As it warms up it only gets better, and its one of the few DIPAs I have had that taste great both warm and fresh out of the refrigerator. 
The mouthfeel is a prolonged sense of grapefruit on the back of the mouth. It is very pleasent. Usually my issue with DIPAs is that they can be very bitter on the way out, but this mouthfeel is like after drinking orange Gatorade: smooth and completely pleasurable.
This is ranks up with the best DIPA's I have ever had. This is my second bottle, and I plan to get another couple if I can find them in the next week. The price is also quite reasonable, and for an ale that I would probably take over Permanent Funeral. It is well worth the price. This beer could not be made any better. 1,449 charactersTCJ0100, Oct 13, 2014

Smell: So much citrus and floral hops! Smells amazing!
Taste: Bitter up front, followed by sharp bitterness and malts, then ending with some piney bitterness. Did I mention it’s bitter? Some faint ethanol taste pops up at the end.
Mouthfeel: Moderate thickness and carbonation.
Overall: Hoppy even for a DIPA! The malts never really stand up to the hops, but it doesn’t matter. Explodes with hop aroma and taste. Plus, you know you're getting a fresh one when you grab this. 572 charactersSensorySupernova, Oct 11, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%Enjoyed this in a side by side taste test with a Pliny.  First time I have had either of these beers.
Poured a lovely dark golden hue with a thick creamy pale head in a Spigelau IPA glass.  Aroma was very citrus hop forward and sweet in nature.  A little alcohol in the nose.  Very aggressive nose.
First sip was bitter with a huge hop hit.  Citrus, pine, spice, almost spicy hotness with the hop hit.  Followed by a large dose of alcohol with a slight malt backbone.  Crisp finish though most likely due to the alcohol.  Felt like I was hit with a hop hammer, but I liked it!
Ultimately, I love a beer that challenges my senses and this one does.  For my tastes a bit more in my wheelhouse than Pliny.  Both great beers, but if I had to choose one forever it would be Enjoy By! 781 characterswasso67, Oct 10, 2014

Appearance: Nice yellow/golden color and crystal clear. White fluffy one-finger head that stayed till the bottom and left some nice lacing.
Smell: Huge grapefruit, pineapple, with a hint of onion and some slight malty sweetness
Taste: just like the aroma, with lots of grapefruit and pineapple - just can't get enough of that flavor.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, not too much carbonation- feels really nice on the tongue, with a great finish and aftertaste that leaves you wanting more.
Overall: Such an outstanding beer, unfortunately we only get about every 3rd release of Enjoy By here in Colorado. I will continue to seek out this brew whenever I have the opportunity. 678 characterstimontheroad, Oct 06, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -2.3%First time trying an enjoy by. Poured into a pint glass. Very clear golden amber with about an inch of head. Smell is largley a strong pine with some subtle notes of citrus like grapefruit, lemon, and orange. The taste follows the nose very closely and has a more balanced taste between cirtusy and pine than the smell does. There is a pretty large malty backbone in it as well. Medium mouthfeel with a good hop smooth hop bite on the back end. This beer reminds me a lot of a more hoppy hopslam. Solid brew by stone once again, but a slightly above middle of the road IPA. 573 charactersmlhyatt, Oct 05, 2014

4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Been wanting to try this brew for a long time.  Just had a bottle of Hop Stoopid so I'll probably be comparing the two.  Here goes:
A:  Not what I was expecting.  Pours a one-inch head, but this readily dissipates.  There also doesn't appear to be a ton of carbonation.  On the good side, the beer has a ton of lacing and it pours a nice orange-amber color.
S:  Whatever the appearance lacked was quickly made up by the smell.  This one's a beauty.  Straight up pine and citrus, however the pine is spectacular.  Probably the pineyist beer I've ever smelled.  Tons of grassy floral notes as well.  Like being in a pacific northwestern forest.
T:  Taste follows the nose, making it spectacular.  Lots of pine, citrus, and grapefruit.  There's also a lot of malt to balance out the hops, making the beer extremely balanced.  Although this beer is rather limited and somewhat expensive, buying it was one of the best decisions I've made in a while.
M:  Nice and thick, but not overwhelming.  Maybe could've been more carbonated.
O:  A spectacular rendition of the WC IPA. 1,073 charactersleantom, Oct 03, 2014

A- crystal clear amber color that has a nice fluffy 2 finger head.  Spiderweb lacing and mountainous peaks.
S- a nice dank piney leaf smell with hints of citrus smell.  The combination is aromatic and pleasing to the nose.  like a citrus pine needle.
F- strong citrus and pine with a slight malt base.  The hops are juicy and sticky.
M-hoppy and light bodied.  Dry in the mouth but crisp and refreshing.
O- great beer and a def spot in my top 10 beers.  I am thinking it could be a lil better if I would have got it before the enjoy by date. 645 charactersDodo2step, Sep 28, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%Enjoyed multiple versions, and always buy any one that I can find. Enjoy By 4-20-2014 was the best batch.
A - Orange hue, slightly off-white head that hangs around like a well hung bull.
S - Fantasticly fresh, everybit of a grapefruit, citrusy, lemony aroma that lingers like a bad hangover. Except every bit of this smell was well taken.
T - Impressive malt backbone from a brewery that seems to skimp out on that aspect with IPA's and favor the over-usage (but welcomed) of hops. Great balance.
M - Creamy, almost as if they used oats within the grain bill but the brew is exceptionally clear, so that didnt happen. Perfectly carbonated.
O - Among the other festivities that usually take place on 4/20 this was by far the most memorable... I think. Can stand up to the very best in the IIPA world. 800 charactersHesscabob, Sep 19, 2014

Enjoy By 4.20.14. Bright orange body. Thick white fluffy head. Earthy hop aroma. Very bitter grapefruit taste. Actually a little sweet. This beer does have a good amount of malt taste. Very delicious. I’d totally buy it again if I’m in Chicago. Can’t get Stone in Madison. 301 characterskkleu357, Sep 17, 2014

A:  golden, dehydrated urine color with minimal head
S: piney, dank, ripe pineapple, citrus
T:  I was surprised by the big juicy pineapple and citrus up front.  Dank but smells more piney than it tastes.  Sticky tropical aftertaste!  2nd bomber definitely had a strong orange rind taste 
M:  smooth all the way through with a sticky mouth feel
O:  this beer is awesome.  Most reviews I read said big pine and dank but I got more tropical fruit with a little dank.  Would love this as a year round offering 565 charactersDwkasper, Sep 11, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%Poured from a 1PT 6FL OZ bottle into a pint glass.  Enjoy By 09.20.14 IPA (bottled on: 08.16.14 per website - this is indeed "devastatingly fresh" at just over three weeks old!)
Appearance:  Pours a clear bright pale body with a nice white head.  Significant lacing.
Smell:  Bright citrusy wonderful.  Even the bottle cap had a fantastic aroma.
Taste:  One of the better, if not best tasting IPAs I have ever tasted.  If indeed this recipe hasn't changed over time, then I think all of the major players (and favorites) are there:  Amarillo, Citra, Simcoe, Nelson Sauvin, Galaxy?  Stone has hit all of the high notes for me.  This is fantastic!!
Mouthfeel:  Nice and smooth, no complaints.
Overall:  I hate giving a beer a perfect 5, and don't think I have ever done so thus far, but this could possibly be the best tasting beer I have ever tasted.  This is my first time trying this beer and I always thought of it as kind of gimmicky or more of a sarcastic marketing response to the beer nerd community.  More than anything though, this is a fantastically crafted, amazingly tasting Double IPA.  It has a huge burst of tropical hop flavor and is not overly bitter.  I could drink this all day! 1,200 charactersJednoPivoProsim, Sep 09, 2014

Taste: apricot, peach, grapefruit at the end strong grapefruit finishing into bitter hops. Mouthfeel: smooth and fresh, not syrupy or sticky. Light crisp carbonation. Overall: terrific IPA, very we'll balanced and full of flavor.  wish there was a bit more complexity, but very enjoyable! 468 charactersBubbawilly88, Sep 07, 2014

It has a very fresh aroma and nice earthy hop smell, with a sort of garlicky characteristic. The beer is interestingly complex with a ton of hop flavors: predominately resinous pine, grapefruit, and orange rind.  There is also a slight malt sweetness.  A terrific DIPA; one of the best examples out there. 454 charactersthomda11, Sep 02, 2014

Smells green with bright fruits and alcohol. 
Pungent, sharp hops. Tastes like guava/pear juice, mango, pineapple and pine. Crisp and slightly sour with citrus rinds. Piney and grassy all the way through. A bitterness that is squashed some by sweet, light  bready malts. The bitter hops show up again in the lingering aftertaste. Some resin with a little oily slickness. Finish is a little drying.  Alcohol is noticeable, but it is not "hot". Easy drinking. Exceptional balance.
Edit: with the 12/25/15 batch I am noticing onion flavor that I never picked up before. 726 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 31, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%Modestly superb. Mine was 'Enjoy By' 9/20/2014.  Golden orange/amber and very aromatic. Nicely hoppy in the mouth, but not overly so.  
It was somewhat sweet, but not '9.4 ABV sweet', and the sweetness didn't last long in the mouth, fortunately.  
If I had to go all night, I would likely not quaff these one after another.  But if I had to limit my intake to a single bomber, and I often do, this one is at or near the top. 426 charactersmick92627, Aug 23, 2014

I won't go in to too much detail on this one because it was several weeks ago when I enjoyed this beer. Furthermore, how can one describe in words what they believe to be a perfect beer?
This brew struck the balance between a hefty, complex, flavor profile and an extremely refreshing and clean finishing experience. Both the aroma and flavor was, obviously, hoppy - citrus, floral, pine. It was all there. A very delicious beer. An adventure that I will seek to replicate for the rest of my life and most likely never will. 640 charactersBigC88, Aug 13, 2014

A - pours up a cloudy medium gold at first, eventually clearing, with a small white head, not much in the way of retention or lacing.
S - lemon, oranges, mangos, grass, bread
T - sweet caramel malt followed by a citrusy hop finish. There is a slight warming at the end, but by and large the alcohol is well hidden for a beer this big.
M - good carbonation, medium thick, very slight aftertaste
O - what's not to love!!! 454 charactersMojo, Aug 02, 2014

Growler from keg at local beer-specific retailer. Good dense gold color, a little hazy, but normal for a DIPA. Good healthy one finger head which left slowly. Aroma is almost pure hops, with a backing of malty sweetness. A bit grassy in its hoppiness, along with pine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit. Taste is wonderful, full in your face hoppy bitter resinousness, backed by enough sweet malt to make it really drinkable. Again, a bit of green freshness in the hops, I'd compare it most to nopalitos or green agave, which accents the pine and grapefruit excellently. Finishes dry, hoppy, and leaving you wanting more. Great beer. My first in this series, but definitely not my last. 755 charactersMikeI, Jul 26, 2014

T- floral sweetness that hits side of the tongues and lingers a tang of grapefruit. Malt slightly present at finish but is over whelmed by those beautiful bitter hops whilst being layered with a resinous sweetness. M- bright with medium body. O- though alcohol is evident in the aroma it's presence is hidden by the glorious hops. Quite enjoyable considering the decent ABV. Paired perfectly well with a baked macaroni and cheese casserole. 547 charactersJefriedrichs, Jul 19, 2014

Overall I've loved the Enjoy by series. But I feel that they are getting a little too mainstream with the taste. Some of the previous ones have been some of my favorite beers. The last two I've had have left me wanting more from this great beer company. 304 charactersMartinHook, Jul 09, 2014

Smell: Highly floral, lavender, meadow, sweet
Taste: Floral initially with mid-palate bitter citrus, some grapefruit, back bone slightly sweet malt, ending with bitter-sweet floral again and easy to drink, engaging
Mouthfeel: Medium to full-body
Overall: great DIPA, cannot wait for the next series. Truly enjoyable to drink 427 charactersAJchase, Jul 07, 2014

Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a tulip glass. 
A- Pours a medium gold with a two finger white head that dissipates slowly. Great amount of clarity for such a hop loaded beer. 
S- This beer smells like every hop in existence, and i think that's what the use. It smells like yo just stuck your face in a bag of hops. Dank pine, citrus, tropical fruits, and stone fruits all in perfect balance. Not really getting any of the onion that I've gotten from other batches. 
T- Get mostly pine and then tropical and citrus. Very light malt presence detected on the finish. A lingering bitterness that is not too much. 
O- An excellent DIPA and one of Stone's best brews. Each batches seems only slightly different and this one is fantastic. Any type of hop aroma and flavor is accounted for, expect maybe floral notes. i try to seek out at least one bottle or glass of every batch we get in my area, you should too. 929 charactersPaulyB83, Jul 05, 2014

Used a Troegs HopBack glass because I couldn't find my Sam Adams or Dogfish glasses. Best beer I have had in a long time. Amazing nose... hoppy, citrus, resinous, other stuff going on. Bursting with flavor from the first sip BUT not so hoppy that it isn't balanced and refreshing. Would not think it was 9.4% ABV if it didn't say so on the bottle. Wish I had bought more than 2 bottles.... 437 charactersVero-Dave, Jul 04, 2014

Appearance: A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer. It is a pale orange color with great clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass. Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell: Super notes of tropical, citrus, grassy, resiny pine, and herbal hops. All followed by caramel and some toasted malts.
Taste: Same as above with mild tingly bitterness and slight hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, balanced, very mild bitterness, 
Overall: Wow. Top Notch Superb beer. Nuf ced. 581 charactersFlounder57, Jul 04, 2014

The latest: "Enjoy by 12.25.16" on 12/09/16 in a 22 oz bomber - see ratings as attached.
This one: better than remembered...although a lovely IPA back in 2014 BUT in July probably did not do much for my taste buds.
Note to Self #2: great time with the knowledgeable staff at Stone's new outpost in Richmond!  Great and FRESH IPAs and such on draft.  Vibe?  Not the best but then again - it was on a late Wednesday afternoon.
Looking forward to my next visit - hopefully in the Spring of 2017. 631 characterskevintaraross, Jul 04, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge hype for this brew and I went to 4 different liquor stores looking for this coveted nectar. Awesome graphic on the bottle and the premise of a drink by date only 30 days from bottle seems extreme. I was a little hesitant about the drinking only 2 weeks from the brew date but I had to give it a shot.
A - Beautiful golden- light orange color. Vibrantly clear with perfect fine white head with moderate lacing.
S - Very strong hop fragrance with tons of citrus fruit and every hop smell you would ever want all packed into one glass. Could smell it as I opened the bottle. Like a grownups candy it makes your mouth water.
T - Huge hop flavor with a full fruit hop character with citrus, tropical fruits, some pine, and dank resin hops to round out one of the most bold beers I've ever had. If you like citrus flavored hops by the bucket full this is a great beer. There is some malt and but almost no alcohol but it's all masked by the hop explosion on your taste buds. The bitterness seems clean and precise without detracting from the flavors. This is clearly a hops showcase.
M - Medium mouth-feel with perfect carbonation. Basically only the hops sit on the tongue but some how it isn't too much and I kept wanting to drink more.
Overall, probably one of the top 5 beers I've ever had. Great aroma, flavor, feel, appearance, and anything else you would desire in a DIPA. This brew is perfect for every hop head out there. This beer went down fast and it put me to sleep even faster. It's a limited release so you've got to get lucky to get a taste.

This beer is a nice amber color with a great fluffy head.
Smell is not overpowering but a very deep pine hop aroma.
Taste is the same as the smell, the hoppiness jumps out in the aftertaste and its not like biting into a pine tree.
Very thick and creamy feel. Overall a very good beer, Its great knowing you are getting freshness as well. 373 charactersconfer, Jun 30, 2014

Light dirty blonde around the edges and a dark dirty blonde towards the center, light golden hues emanate throughout the body. It is slight hazy overall and topped off with a thick white head that sticks around for a while.
Smell:
Strong citrus zest like orange and grape fruit mixed in with hops and some lemon grass.
Taste:
Just like the aroma, grapefruit zest, hops mild wheat flavors all carried by a slightly sweet taste. The aftertaste is bitter with a hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel:
medium to full bodied and well rounded.
Overall:
Another great beer from Stone Brewing, great tasting, smooth and refreshing. 624 charactersvickersspitfire, Jun 28, 2014

A = golden amber with a slight lemon cast. A foamy head that leaves a bit of lacing.
S = Hoppy flowery, light spice, and pleasant alcohol - not too alcohol forward.
T=Crisp and clean for an IPA. The bitterness tickles the back of the tongue in a good way. A slight malty sweetness.
M = Medium bodied and the 9.4% alcohol ensures crispness.
O = A delicious summer IPA, totally appropriate for the season. It would pair nicely with a barbeque meal, or any full flavored summer foods. Also tasty by itself! 609 charactersThisLadyLovesBeer, Jun 28, 2014

3.79/5  rDev -13.9%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.7522 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint.
Appearance: Slight haze, golden color, moderate off white head, head fades slightly but does not disappear
Smell: spicy, dank & slightly floral, low grassiness. Med grainy malt sweetness in background - but clean bready malt, no heavy caramel sweetness. 
Taste: primarily spicy/ herbal with a little tropical/ citrus, and a background note of that weird but lovely gooseberry licorice Nelson sauv thing. Fantastic hop profile, interesting, clean, and for the most part spicy and dank. Malt character is perfect for this style, light grainy malt w low to no caramel or excessive complexity. Dry and well attenuated. Possibly some wheat or touch of oats in here, I get a flavor associated with low-adjunct beers like Lag SUCKS. Very nice.
Mouthfeel: medium/ med-full but fairly clean on finish. alcohol noticeable but not in the way.
Overall: A nice full bodied hop encounter with the humulous lupous characters I like. Spicy, dank. Love the spicy hops with a touch of citrus/ tropical funk. Love the dating concept, especially since I spend so much time searching for dates on other hoppy beers. The last one Enjoy by 4/20/14 here in NYC was not so good - hops had faded and beer came across as astringent, sharply pine with some other odd flavors. But I dig this new installment. 1,325 charactersSimont, Jun 28, 2014

This IPA is super fresh and has outstanding hops and citrus/pine taste. Goes down smooth. Pick up a few 22oz bottles for the holidays! 311 charactersFrank_TX, Jun 28, 2014

Appearance: Clear, golden/copper color, adequate lacing on the glass, decent head retention.
Smell: grassy, floral hops, reminiscent of a cut lawn on the Fourth of July
Taste: Aggressively hopped, sweet pale malt taste, citric dryness followed by a VERY subtle Anise/licorice note
Mouthfeel: dry, without coating the mouth. Refreshing finish with a touch of sting on the tongue.
Overall: An American Double IPA which succeeded in providing what it intended to provide: A full bodied hop-headed delight just in time for the 4th of July. The taste could really only be described as "Fresh" with plenty of herbal hop aroma and taste, but with an undeniable malty sweetness to balance the more assertive flavors of the hops. I personally enjoy this one more than Stone's "Enjoy by 4.20.14 IPA", despite that being an excellent brew. Perfect complement to the dog days of summer, in the midst of job and apartment hunting, just hoppy enough to keep me awake. Intending to purchase again prior to Independence Day.
Cheers,

It's an ever-so-slightly hazed amber orange with a brilliant flare in the body and brightness, mostly transparent. The head shows force and structure, maintaining its finger and a half or so of head for a good while and never dropping very much, keeping up a sticky crown that plasters some nice patching to the glass.
There's a really nice freshness, so to speak, all over this IPA, raw but not unrefined, rustic but not dirty. It's a blend of earthiness with some pretty fresh pine resin, and it mingles nicely with plenty of citrus and some other greener and earthier sorts of fruits. It's also moderately pithy from front to back. This is balanced against enough malts bringing in bread and caramels to keep the hops in focus and up front. It's not as massively deep or fascinating as some of the reviews and ratings would lead me to believe (maybe some versions are?), but there's no doubt this is a great IPA from a brewery that knows IPA.
The mouthfeel has that balance between strength and ease of drinking, brightness and heaviness, crispness and smoothness, and has each of them in measure to make this an easy-drinking but thoughtful brew. 1,209 charactersBrenden, Jun 21, 2014

A - Poured out a crystal clear light golden orange, with a nice white two finger head which leave nice legs. 
S - I could smell this bad boy from the moment I poured it two feet away. Smells of pine and citrus, dankness, tangerine, mango, slight caramel notes and a bit alcohol. It tickles the nose slightly. 
T - Loads of hops then bitterness, some residual sweetness. I get more dankness on the flavor, with some citrus and resinous pine, then the lingering bitterness comes through and the burning alcohol after it goes down. Quit enjoyable. 
M - Soft medium body with a slickness and good amount of carbonation. Leaves relatively dry but does have a nice sweet middle note. 
O - Pretty awesome double IPA from Stone. Its great to get a bottle that you know is fresh without having to search for it or gamble on it. If you want a hoppy double IPA that wont disappoint pick this one up soon. Only downfall with this brew is the relatively high price at over 8 dollars, so I had to reduce the overall score from 4.25. Keep making great beer Stone, cheers! 1,131 charactersDrinkMoreBigBeers, Jun 21, 2014

"An over-hopped abomination" is what a few European / British friends of mine might call it. I'm more in the former camp myself, as I find it hard for stone to do any wrong, regardless of how much hops they manage to fit into any given beer. But don't be fooled, this is a hoppy one! If you're one to think this week's English ESB is a bit over the top, this one's a bit out of this world. 
Orange tinted tan and clear, 2 finger head drops off after a couple mintues, lace is sparse. 
Taste and aroma - well if you didn't guess "hoppy" by now, there's ot much hope for you, and we should just head on down to the corner store and grab you a fourty. 
Body is medium with a slightly slick finish and a resinously hoppy linger. 
Overall - it's Stone. The name alone says it all. 867 charactersAlCaponeJunior, Jun 20, 2014

It's clean and crisp on the nose and the palate. Perfect IPA taste and smell. A beautiful golden, slightly orange color to it. I poured it into an IPA glass very slowly so there wasn't much head but it bubbled around the edges nicely and stayed the whole time I drank it. For a 9.4%, there's no alcohol taste so it really creeps up on you. Fantastic beer. Hoping to get another pint before 7/14/14 482 charactersbennettjd13, Jun 20, 2014

Ok, now we have more hops and bitterness.  It seems a return to what the Enjoy by was several years ago.  I like this one.  
06/18/14 Enjoy by 07/14/14
This one was much softer than previous Enjoy bys. Wasn't as hoppy as the previous early 2014 and 2013 productions. Reminded me of the 04/13 style, but this one was even softer. I felt as if Stone also brewed this one with a muscadet or semillion wine grape because of the roundness.
03/27 Enjoy by 04/13/14
This one had a much more floral nose to it. DIdn't appear as hoppy as the 2.14.14
It was also much softer than the previous one. It did not have the orange hue to it, so I have to imagine the IBU count isnt as high.
But this is still a very enjoyable beer. Different than 2.14.14, not better no worse, just different. Mush more of a soft smoothing, slow sipping beer
02/07 Enjoy By 02.14.14
Getting better. This one had to have a higher IBU rating. There was a orange hue to the pour from this one with strong aromas of grapefruit, citrus and pine. To me, there was so much hops, that this beer was dry before I even tasted it. Dry isnt the word. Its a beer for a hop head, no question about that. This one, I would rank up there with some of the real hop head beers.
Totally enjoyable, but one flaw... Too much hop without enough to balance this one, so too much in one direction
10/16 Enjoy By 11.12.13
This by far to me has been the best enjoy by in a long time. I am a huge fan of Ruination and once I poured this one, it didn't have the same deeper color, but everything else is right there and some more
The hops came out across the room, you didn't even have to be close to the bottle. The air was filled with citrus and grapefruit. As I got closer to the glass, my senses opened up even more. The bitterness of this beer let your tongue know for sure what you were drinking but at the same time, giving you a comfortable mouthful and balance. Each sip, was more bitter than the one before, but in such a good sense.
The finish was outstanding...
I could not find anything wrong with this beer, hence, a '5' it gets
---
I couldn't wait to taste this one. I just didnt know what to expect from Stone. The pour was a nice amber reddish/golden hue with a nice frothy white head.
Then I put my nose up to the glass. U almost feel off my chair! By the smell, I was expecting the IBU count to be into the thousands, far beyond what mortals can drink.
But at the first sip, I realized that while the Hop aroma was there, almost crazy, this beer had a good amount of hoppiness, but very gentle, something you would think in the 70's
Each sip was cleaner and cleaner. Still the nose held up so very well.
The taste was crisp and clean All those hops didnt jump after your tongue. This was one enjoyable beer. I know its limited, but I gotta see if I can convince of of our guys to let another go. 2,896 charactersrdilauro, Jun 19, 2014

pours crystal clear, bright dark golden in color, bright white head. good head retention, and a bit of lacing. aroma has got to be the most intense hop aroma I've smelled from an IPA before. like opening up a package of vacuum sealed package of hops. citrus, pine, a bit dank. clean simple base malt and all hop flavor. highlights the hops well, but I personally prefer a bit more malt flavor in a DIPA. medium body, higher carbonation. 480 charactersjmdrpi, Jun 19, 2014

Pours a cloudy amber color with two finger head that slowly dissipates and 20 minutes later remains to create lacing. Lots of floral notes in the nose. The taste is surprisingly balanced - I was expecting my taste buds to get knocked around by the hops, but they survived. The alcohol is well hidden so be careful! 393 charactersdpkpr, Jun 19, 2014

Beautifully crafted with a slight grapefruit-y hop smell, it is a medium bodied double ipa that does not overwhelm nor intrude. Pairs well with a delicious summer salad... or a Jameson neat.

I don't notice a big difference between them, although some have said they thought the 4-20 was more dank. To that I would say: maybe. You would never know this is a 9.4% beer when drinking it, so be careful
Color- light gold / yellow - much lighter than you would expect for a beer with this ABV
Smell - An explosion of pine, then more pine - a little bit of other aromas, citrus floral
Taste - it is a christmas tree in a glass. Again a ton of pine resin broken with a citrus finish

Smell is dank, very resinous, pine, cat pee. 
Taste is also big hops, again, resinous, though there's a little citrus as well, some line. Moderate bitterness, this is actually pretty balanced in spite of the intense hops. Delicious. 
Mouthfeel is oily, dry, with full, softer carbonation. Light bodied. 
This is a killer IPA, stone really nailed it. One can argue that more citrus hops could amp up the complexity, but there is some citrus, and I prefer the resinous hop flavors. Light body, high, clean ABV, what's not to love? 568 charactersccrida, Jun 17, 2014

I'm getting a lot of booze and onion in the taste. It reminds me of FFF Arctic Panzer Wolf and a better version of the regular Stone IPA. While very good, it just seems overrated and overpriced. I can find local IPA's that are more satisfying. 411 charactersSwettenham_Shire, Jun 17, 2014

The aroma as I poured was intensely crisp with an abundance of pine. Once I dug into dinner and swallowed this lightly crisp, but very complex IPA I was blown away. This beer was promised as a fresh, but date driven determinator and it more than delivered an enjoyable experience. It's complexity isn't like the usual offerings in the IPA category. It offers something refreshingly different and makes me want to go get some more before July 4th. 563 charactersthumperskibum, Jun 17, 2014

smell - lots of floral and bitterness in this one.

mouthfeel - those hops are aggressive and don't leave your mouth right away.  pleasantly carbonated as well.
this is a very fresh hop bomb.  stone sure knows how to make a hoppy beer 415 charactersbeatenbyjacks, Jun 16, 2014

Pours a clear light amber with nice finger and a half of loosely bubbled head that is persistent and leaves a great lacing. Nose is grapefruit and most notable, tons of tropical fruit especially mango/papaya, maybe even some peach mixed in. Extremely fruity. Taste, unfortunately for me, follows the nose pretty close. I don't know the type of hops off hand but there's a hit of hoppy, piney bitterness and then another assault of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel is what it should be, nothing to brag or gripe about. Overall, there's waaay too much of the tropical fruit sweetness for me. I just don't "enjoy" it. I'll still buy the next one though because this series from Stone is generally one I enjoy. 722 charactersslackattack, Jun 16, 2014

Even the wife thought it was really good, and she hates IPAs. Update: The 12/26/14 was just a delicious mango explosion. Update: 3/14/15 Pi was enjoyed with my pal Jens4212, I got the tulip. Beautiful golden amber pour with sticky-icky lacing. Hop explosion: orange, grapefruit, mango, bit of a savory/earthy hop. Not much alcohol noticeable in the mix of citrus, bitterness, and deliciousness. Clean finish. Enjoy by rocks. Update: 7/04/15 had huge pine/grapefruit juice and citrus peel, crisp and clean with a dry finish, just an absolute hop playground. 669 charactersMikus, Jun 16, 2014

Bubbly, frothy two finger white cap quickly settles into a nice layer of bubbles with decent lacings. Clear golden orange color with scant carbonation streams. 
Aroma of pine, resin. Grass. 
Bitterness on the sides of the tongue, bitterness on the tip.Taste of the hops with pine the dominant flavor. Smooth carbonation on the tongue. Gentle but present bitterness on the aftertatse. 
Clean fresh IPA. STONE does a great job in producing beer and this is another fine example. 507 charactersWunderLlama, Jun 15, 2014

T-hard to tell you all the things that i taste, but I will try. Malt and hops at the beginning that goes to a hard pine hop aftertaste that slowly fades as you finish.
M-high carbonation
O-the smell is by far the best. I could not wait to taste it, the taste did not let me down very much. I will buy one every time now, the hype made me think it would be hard to live up to, but it did

S: Dankness of hops! Also some honey and grassy notes. 
T: Yes! Note that I have to be in an IPA mood to enjoy these things; luckily this is one of those moods. This is awesome... dank hops, grassy notes, rough pine, citrus, crispy saltines, apple skins, and a nice and balanced malt backbone. 
M: Nice and creamy, with a crisp carb on the back end. As it warms I get a more syrupy mouth feel. The coating on the palate isn't too much, but just right. 
O: Glad I picked it up! Stone Enjoy By is one of those IPAs I can thoroughly enjoy. A very pleasant and balanced beer with wonderful flavors. 659 characterstitty_mcbitty, Jun 15, 2014

Hell yes to this beer, lightning strikes six times! Have been back for more on 2 other occasions to my local beer store. Really did not think this would still be around, but it is. Taking advantage of the general public in my area not knowing about this. Enjoy your case of Bud Light.. See review of the first one:
I spotted an open case of these at my beer grocer. They were so new that they couldn't even find the price on them. Bottled a little more than 1 week ago from enjoying!!!
I pounced on the opportunity.
A grapefruit BOMB pervades the nostrils in a pleasant way. 
Grapefruit and bitter finish, and clean.
One caveat is this: As I have enjoyed the 6 bottles over the past 2.5 weeks, yes, there is a marked difference between drinking this a week ago and now. It will never be as good as when you can drink less then a week after it was bottled.
This and the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA are the two best IPA's I have ever had. I guess the conundrum with this is once you have had these Enjoy By's, it ruins your palate for other IPA's, which is unfair. Once you have had this, it is hard to accept anything less.
Such a treat, and on a select few of perfect IPA's. 1,363 charactersdave39, Jun 14, 2014

A- Nice straw colored IPA. Standard bubbles and white head. Picture purfect IPA
S - Smell of a nice blended hop bill. Grass, pine, resin.
T- Not over the top hops, but I'm getting a pretty standard hop bill. Well balanced, but with all the IPAs on the market, this one doesn't differentiate itself. 
M- Standard IPA, not too think, not too thick. Tiny bubbles to disperse the flavor without annoying the palet.
O- A solid IPA. Well balanced and a decent hop bill. Will probably buy a bottle of each release as long as it is under $10 566 charactersPBRmeasap1980, Jun 14, 2014

A- Clear amber with yellow hue. Finger of white head. Medium amount of lacing. Carbonation noticeable.
S- Best part of this ale, although it tastes great too. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits coming off. Tangerine, guava, orange, and lemon are very apparent. Lots of flora. Just of touch of grass and pine. Not much of a malt presence, but just enough.
T- Very juicy, hop-forward DIPA. Not quite as many citrus flavors as the smell, but definitely still fruity and flowery. Bit of pine as the smell indicated and a little bread. Alcohol noticeable, but not by much.
M- Crisp and light bodied for the most part. Carbonation present. Just the right bight.
O- Another favorite DIPA of mine that can party with the top guys. Very drinkable and refreshing. The flavor of this really reminds me of Pliny, but with a stronger bite and bitterness. Wish this was a little more available, as this is the first time I've noticed in the area and there were purchasing restrictions. Highly recommended and kudos to Stone. 1,051 charactersEveningCordial, Jun 14, 2014

T: A wonderful mix of citrus and floral characters, with just enough pine to balance out the sweet honey malts.
M: Medium body, medium low carb, matches nicely with taste. This is a pretty big beer, not an easy drinker.
O: I can feel the alcoholic warmth, was confused until I looked it up and saw that it is 9.4%... Hides the alcohol really well, hidden by the bitter pine finish. I was expecting this to be more in the 6-7% range, the value is much better as a high ABV beer. Not as in your face flavor as most IPAs that are this strong... Man this is a good beer. If you see it, grab it. There's a reason Stone is legendary for making IPAs. 755 charactersbareju, Jun 13, 2014

O: Bought this today at Trader Joe’s near Williamsburg, VA. Drank tonight near Raleigh, NC. Certainly fresh. Not the best double IPA I’ve had, but good in it's mouth feel, very much hiding the alcohol. Good and fresh, and unique carbonation for this style. 818 characterspatre_tim, Jun 13, 2014

Super fresh and hoppy, very citrus forward, masks alcohol surprisingly (dangerously) well, very smooth. Importantly, no maltiness / sweetness which is sometimes a drawback of this style for my taste. If you're looking for a fresh, hoppy, big west coast IPA I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one. 396 charactersSubhop, Jun 11, 2014

I've had from the growler at the brewery and It was the FRESHEST IPA I've ever tasted. I live about 50 miles from the brewery so even the bottles are fresh beers. I highly recommend picking up any enjoy by IPA's that you see.

I'll keep this brief. A couple days ago had an 07.04.14...first thing i noticed was the (fantastic) sweet citrus smell. then I tried a taste...simply outstanding. 311 charactersstaudio, Jun 10, 2014

Currently, I am drinking the 07.04.14 for this review. It pours wonderfully with a light bronze color and thick foamy head. My first inhale hit me with a dank citrus, pine scent with undertones of an earthy, fruity base. The beer itself is smooth and round with a crisp bite of citrus. Its fresh, bold and I love it! 422 charactersAyeMito, Jun 10, 2014

I've had a few 4.20.14's and a few 7.04.14's.
These are indeed world-class ales! You can tell just by the lacing that this is something special.
9.4% ABV. &lt;--- That can't be right! I want to drink this all day- dammit!
I would have given it 5/5 for every category, but I'm not sure that my palate is refined enough to qualify me to do so.
So refreshing!
So tasty!
Devastatingly dank!!!
This is one of God's own prototypes. Some kind of high powered mutant never even considered for mass production. 567 charactersOldRickSputin, Jun 09, 2014

Pours a nice yellow beer. Nice head, tall and foamy. Smell varies depending on release, but mostly strong and hoppy. Taste is the same, bitter, strong, hoppy. Mouth feel is good, light beer. I can drink a few of these. 319 charactersJulioH, Jun 08, 2014

My first enjoy by beer from Stone.
Beer pours a brilliantly clear amber with a full, frothy inch and a half of ecru colored foam. Beautiful sticky lacing as I empty my glass. 
The scent is absolutely fresh. Smells like sniffing a fresh bag of hops from hop union on brew day. Hops consist of pine, grapefruit and a wonderful dank earthiness. Very hop forward in the nose. 
The taste begins with a smooth citrus flavor and fades towards a caramel sweetness. Any sweetness is brief and gives way to a very bitter citrus finish. The taste lacks the layers of complexity found in the nose. 
The beer is medium bodied and an appropriate level of carbonation. The high level of alcohol is well hidden.
Overall an enjoyable beer. I think I enjoy the concept and push for fresh beer more than the beer itself. That said, it is very good, yet not something I would hord or seek out. 897 charactersJmamay22, Jun 08, 2014

Appearance: Orange golden color with a frothy one finger light beige head. Phenomenal lacing
Smell: Bright tropical fruits, light citrus, pine, slight onion; Very dank. My nose picked up the aromas from an arms length away and my brothers from across the table! The most aromatic IPA I've ever smelled
Taste: Once again, super dank. The tropical fruits hit you upfront, then comes the hop resin, pine, and light citrus.. along with a undertone of malt sweetness that balances it all out that fades into a pleasant aftertaste that lingers
Mouthfeel: Medium body; Smooth yet enough bitterness that lets you know its an IPA. Goes down extremely well for a beer pushing 10% abv
Overall: I have yet to try PtE, the "big" three Vermont beers, or some other highly rated IPAs/IIPAs, but this is certainly the best representation of the style I've had thus far. I had both the bomber and tap and although both were amazing, it was even that much better on tap. Stone beers tend to be past their prime by the time they get to my area, where the hops fade, leaving a malt and onion mess. But with this, I know each batch will be fresh. At just over a week since bottling, this is one of the freshest bottles I've ever had, and it shows. Enormous vibrant hop presence that I enjoy in an IPA without being too aggressive. We have a real winner here! Worth the $9 (with tax) price tag for a guaranteed fresh bomber of this quality brew. Can't recommend this one enough, and absolutely worth the hype. Enjoy!
Edit: The recent batches iv tried seem to have more of that oniony taste and less tropical fruit. There's so many great DIPAs on the market now that i dont necessarily think this is the best anymore. Still great nonetheless 1,778 charactersBone53, Jun 08, 2014
2.44/5  rDev -44.5%look: 5 | smell: 1 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Enjoy by 7-04-14 tasted on 6-7-14. So very fresh.
I really hate the smell. Smells like gruyere crust to me. I have had the same problem with several stone beers. Since so many love their beers I think that it is simply some kind of reaction with my palate. I don't get the fruity smell lots talk about. The taste is no as bad, but still taste like gruyere to me.
I had the same problem with the go to IPA (not as much though), ruination (more than with the "go to ipa"), the Gotterdammerung.
Must be something wrong with my palate (some reaction to the type of hops they use), so don't judge the beer by my review. 614 characterslulubrewer, Jun 08, 2014

4.98/5  rDev +13.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Enjoy By 07.04.14 (Bottled on 05.30.14 and consumed on 6.21.14) into a 16oz Libbey Munique elongated tulip glass.
A- Poured an ever-so-slight hazy golden with a solid 1+ finger worth of a creamy, white head...as it is consumed, the lacing is really attractive. (5.0)
S- A commingling of sweet citrus (tangerine, ruby red grapefruit) and stone/tropical fruit (apricot, mango, papaya) along with a dank and piney 'herbaciousness'  all bounce from the glass...the balance of all those elements are what makes this such a classic. (5.0)
T- Sweet malt hits first followed by healthy dose of tropical fruits found in the nose. The finish is a dual assault of citrus rind followed by an undercurrent of a resiny pine quality...classic Stone finish. (4.75)
M- Carbonation is just enough to create a nice head and open the palate to get those flavors to infiltrate the palate to create an exceptional experience. (4.75)
O- Kudos to Stone delivering this beer into the market as distant as VT within 1 week of its bottling. That is an immense testament to their commitment, enthusiasm and influence in the market to prove their point. I have now tasted various iterations of this beer at 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months and post 90 days...although it is a delicious offering at any time, I am now a convert of enjoying this as fresh as possible since the tropical fruit notes sing the loudest and blend the best with the herbal notes. Time will accentuate the garlic/onion qualities that are only muted as a young beer. (5.0) 1,523 charactersthreeviews, Jun 07, 2014

A: nice resinated foam legs for days. Otherwise a clear amber gold much like the insect from Jurassic park. Good retention in carbonation.
S: peaches galore much different this time around. No spiciness which is good and bad depending what you are into. Nice citrus profile. I want this in an air freshener.
T: Once again those peaches with lingering pineapple at the end. Almost tart. This enjoy by is much different than the others. Oddly remind me of Le terrior in a good way. Nice woody character. Resinated finish without powerful hop burn.
M: holds real well considering the alcohol content. Again this is a different batch. Clean. Easy drinking. A great beer to advance someone who kind of likes ipas.
Overall: bravo stone. I always look forward to these. At first I thought this beer was lacking to its predecessors but as it opened up it became a clean citrus bomb. 1,026 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Jun 07, 2014

Look: An absolutely beautiful beer, the color is 24k liquid gold with a crystal clear, glimmering clarity and thick, creamy white head that leaves an afterparty of white confetti lacing down the sides of the glass.
Smell: It's an IPA! Aromas of crackers, toasted corn, and sweet malt desperately try to escape the delightfully oppressive superpower bouquet of grapefruit, pine, and cannabis. Truly one of the best IPAs I've had the pleasure of holding to this nose.
Taste: Sweet baby jesus, this was an amazing IPA. This beer is definitely best for the hop lovers out there as it is less than gentle with the hop bitterness (according to the girlfriend) though it still manages to be extremely balanced and drinkable. This bottle is Christmas in Hawaii in beer form. Tastes like a tropical Christmas tree with the usual DIPA citrus-pine smell characterized by grapefruit and tropical fruits. 
Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, huge body, lengthy finish, what else do you want me to say? It feels as good as it tastes, and it tastes great. It manages to be creamy and refreshing at the same time.
Overall: How have I never had this beer before? I'm a hop head that lives walking distance from Stone Brewery and am ashamed to say I skipped over this beer for almost a year before finally deciding to try a bottle. This is without a doubt the best double IPA I've had and is sure to please any that consider themselves hop heads. STOP READING AND GO GET SOME 1,561 charactersthecarter3rd, Jun 06, 2014

Tasted on 2/14/14, a perfect Valentine!
Color- cloudy honey gold. Medium but thick head. 
Aroma- hops, hops, and more hops; hints of evergreen bushes and fresh cut grass. 
Taste- A hoppy and complicated brew. Starts with a raw hoppiness that isn't citrus or evergreen, it's more like a raw, bitter weed from the field. Then transitions to a mild buttery mid body. Finishes with a long, lingering pungent hoppiness. Very different from other offerings by Stone. The high ABV is fairly well masked. An excellent imperial IPA. 
Poured from 650 ml bomber into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass), 662 charactersutfiero, May 19, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer appears golden and cloudy. I can barely see my hand on the other side of the glass. The head is white and dissipates into a light ring around the edges as you consume the beer. Lacing is minimal. It has a strong smell of sweet tropical fruit. The smell supports the taste. Fruity, piney, hoppy, and sweetness all rolled into a complex, superior taste. The mouthfeel is also top of the line.
Overall this beer is extremely enjoyable. I grew up drinking Stone, growing up only a few miles away. I even have a picture on their website from their 2nd anniversary party. This beer is up there with PtE, Nelson, HT, and Abrasive. This is an excellent beer. 661 charactersmabermud, May 18, 2014

Holds up to the Pliny the Elder everyone is so high on. In my opinion I'd take Enjoy By over the Pliny any day. The fact that it's dated makes it easy to know you're getting a freshly made batch. If you haven't tried Enjoy By you're missing out. 348 charactersSeanamonica, May 13, 2014

Big pine when I crack the bottle, pawpaw, bit of rubber, general tropical smells. There's also a strong spice contingent to this- Thai curry spices. Also notably floral. Over time these meld together deliciously over a nectarine malt backdrop. Candied/stewed fruits. Alcohol at times. Slight corny note.
Taste is a well-poised balance of malt and tropical fruits, and more of those spices and nectarine. Still a fairly harsh finish at times- hops and alcohol are kinda present.
Good tropical mouthfeel featuring malt, and a bit of booze.
Also tried this same batch 2 weeks and 2 days ago. I remember the hopping being harsher (duh). It's mellowed out with the extra few weeks and the hops and malt are more integrated. Ideally I would have had this earlier but it's also been interesting to compare a two week vs month old DIPA. I definitely feel it's changed a bit even in such a short timeframe, but it's pretty hard to judge objectively.
At times the aromatics are great, but its ABV is in what can be a danger zone for DIPAs. A big, bold, spicy and aromatic beer, whose ABV could easily sneak up on you. 1,183 charactersdanieelol, May 12, 2014

Pour: Bright golden yellow-ish orange. Beautiful fluffy head, looks AMAZING.
Aroma: Dank pine, tropical, onion/garlic, ripe grapefruit, crackery malt, cannabis, citrus, absolutely everything I want in a double IPA.
Taste: Big fresh hoppy bitterness in typical Stone fashion. Huge grapefruit, lemon, onion/garlic dankness, slight tropical, underlying sweetness. Just an AMAZING DIPA.
Mouth feel: Not too little, not too much. Just Right.
Overall: This pretty much sets the bar for what a fresh DIPA should be. If you love DIPA's and haven't had this then go find one, now! Indescribably beautiful liquid art. 629 charactersBriantheBeerGeek, May 09, 2014

4.32/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Enjoy by 05.16.14: made it with 2 weeks or so to spare. 22oz bomber purchased from Ales Unlimited in San Francisco.
Beautifully clear pale golden colour, with a very fine, sticky and white head that subsides in streaky lacing. Body is fine and sleek, holding plenty of static fine carbonation at its swirled. Big and bold.
Yeah, the nose is big. This is the point of that date blasted on the label. This is fresh, bright and hectic: big pine and herbal characters, crushed and pressed into aromatic bliss. "Devastatingly dank", it says as well, and there's certainly a dank organic character to it, giving a funky overhopped mass. Impressive stuff—just what you expect from a super-fresh Stone beer.
Taste is also superb. Clean, bright and fresh, with a solid smooth malt underpinning that never gets in the way. The bite comes in the back, with a firm bitterness gilded and caressed by a smoothness from the malt and the slightly higher ABV. Aniseed and piquant herbal notes complete the picture on the back, coming through move strongly as the beer warms slightly. It's a really great brew.
Feel is smooth and light with a slickness to help propagate the hop characters.
It's a big beer, no doubt, and yet it manages to be so surprisingly drinkable at the same time. After a while, I can feel the 9.4% ABV, but to be honest until I'd drunk most of the bottle, I didn't really notice it. That's the sign of a really good (or at least really distracting) beer. 1,467 characterslacqueredmouse, May 04, 2014

A: poured from a 22. Looks nice and clean, like it will have great hop flavor. Leaves nice lacing along the whole glass. looks very appealing.
S: Smells like citrus and pine, just what I'd expect form an ipa. The smell leaves with an aftertaste of onions which I'm not so keen about.
T: Taste follow the nose, unfortunately the onion taste overpowers the beautiful west coast IPA 
flavors. The citrus and pine are there, but overshadowed by onion. There is a nice bitterness, but still overshadowed by onion. If you hate onions as much as I do maybe you'll agree.
M: Good, medium body. nice carbonation. Feels like it should.
O: Was very excited to try this one, but after having 3 separate brews I have decided to give this one a pass in the future. Too much hype, too much onion. 820 characterstyweiss, Apr 29, 2014

Golden color, foamy head, lots of fruit on the nose. Definitely smelling some pineapple and mango in there. Sweet, refreshing, very fruity IPA with a nice bitter finish. Methinks it would be a great summer IPA. Too bad it’s still the dead of winter.

Appearance: Perfect clear, bright, gold color. It develops a robust head that quickly goes away and leaves just a thin ring. The lacing is incredible, covering the whole glass and slowly sliding away.
Smell: Big citrus, hop aromas of pine, grapefruit and spices attack the nose. The smell is very good and very important to the overall experience. 
Taste: The citrusy grapefruit taste is right at the front along with some pine and spicy pepper notes. There's also an alcohol sting at the end thanks to a 9.4% ABV that gets stronger and more noticeable as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. It's smooth and very refreshing when cold. It only gets smoother as it warms up.
Overall: It was a big deal for Puerto Rico's craft beer scene getting this. Believe the hype, it's simply incredible in every aspect. Hophead or not, you need to give this beer a try. It should be noted that in order for this beer to be enjoyed fully it should be had slowly. The taste and texture both change the warmer it gets. 1,159 charactersVoodooBear, Apr 27, 2014

4.31/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25"You have in your hands a devastatingly fresh double IPA. Freshness is a key componenet of many beers- especially big, hoppy IPAs- but we've taken it further, a lot further with this one. We brewed this IPA specifically NOT to last. We've gone to extensive lengths to ensure you get your hands on this beer within an extraordinarily short window, and we've sent a very clear message in the name of the beer itself that there is no better time than right NOW to enjoy this IPA!" Brewed in the style of an American Double IPA. First released in late 2012, this is a beer that comes around in small batches with a clear date printed on the bottle to consume by. This review covers the 04.20.14 batch compared to a 02.14.14 batch (roughly 2 months out of date) for a comparison on how fast a beer like this could fall off.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a tulip glass. Served north of 52º Fahrenheit.
(Appearance) Pours a pastel white frothy cream head over a golden amber body with a mild haze and meager carbonation. Retention is very nice and lacing is medium thin and tiered. 4.25
(Smell) Aroma is rich with hoppy complexity; piney, herbal and resinous with a bold grapefruit aroma and a bite of spicy hop character for an aggressive hop front. Lesser hop notes include tropical fruit and earthy hop notes and the hop bitterness is bold in the aroma. Malt presence is slightly milder led by a syrupy grain caramel and a moderate cracker and biscuit malt sweetness. The aroma of this beer overall is phenomenal on the hop front, there's just so much to behold and the complexity is so rich, the potential for these characters to rapidly fade may be the main drive behind the dates on these bottles. 4.5
(Taste) The malt profile was a bit overstated in its sweetness from the aroma. In the flavor, it is very rich in flavor and body but the sweetness is muted and mellow. The hop profile is very forward with herbal and resinous hop character with a strong bitterness. Although the flavor is very similar to the aroma, I didn't pick up on as many hop subtleties as I did in the aroma, or they aren't as well carried into the flavor as I had hoped. The finish is distinctively herbal with a touch of hoppy must and pepper before trailing with long-lasting tropical fruit. 4.25
(Mouthfeel) Texture is mildly chewy, oily, slick. Carbonation makes for a soft, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Body is medium/high for a Double IPA and medium/high amongst all beers. Balance is bitter over sweet. Alcohol presence is mild, masked by the assertive hop character. 4.25
(Overall) While the malt profile of Enjoy By IPA is nothing special, the real bravado is that of the hops on display- so many flavors and subtleties that listing them all may exceed my character limit. One of the most enthusiastic and adventurous DIPAs you can get on the market, Enjoy By manages showcases the hop flavor potential in all its glory. It's highly recommended that you go out of your way to pick up at least one bottle. 4.25
Notes on the 02.14.14 batch, 2 months, 6 days past enjoy by date:
A trained eye can immediately notice a difference in clarity at this date, as the beer is far more hazy, the retention poorer and the carbonation more prevalent. The aroma is also different; while the hop profile is nearly as potent as before, many of the more herbal hop notes are fading and the more predictable Double IPA notes of citrus, piney resin and tropical fruit are thus gaining ground. The flavor of this batch is slightly sweeter and more balanced with the hops than the fresh batch, and the hop notes of herbal, grapefruit and resinous hops are still incredibly bold but collectively not as sharp and bright as those of the fresher batch. The mouthfeel is nearly the same although I much prefer the balance of sweetness to hops in this batch in particular. I recognize it could be a batch inconsistency, but the carbonation plays much better with some pairing malt substance and sweetness to back it up. To the novice craft enthusiast, there aren't severe enough differences to make drinking Enjoy By on time mandatory, so don't fret if you miss the date by a month or so. To the seasoned palate, understand that this beer loses an exponential part of its hop potency from the moment it's bottled, so it's worth trying one as soon as you can and not to hesitate. I preferred the fresher batch by nearly every measure, so it's not just marketing- them hops are truly fragile!

I poured this into a ipa glass, it has a golden color body with a small sticky head. The aroma has a pine and citrus coming from it. The taste has a bitter hop of pine up that's hits the tongue. I get a little citrus also. The mouthfeel is sticky and leaves a sticky hop taste on the tongue. Overall this is excellent dipa. 344 characterschefhatt, Apr 21, 2014

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed 9 days after being bottled. Poured from a 22oz bomber into my Dogfish Head oversized snifter.
Alloy orange to amber gradient, day-bright and topped with a magnolia collar surrounding an archipelago-like surface slick. Fine sandy lacing, moderately sticky yet fast running legs. Decent retention.
The profusion of hops utilized is immediately apparent in the nose, a frontal assault that begins the moment you pop the cap and becomes a nearly overwhelming wave of tropical fruit, citrus, and fresh herbs when poured into the glass. The individual notes are name-able (passion fruit, lemongrass, orange marmalade, garlic chives...the list goes on for ages), but are insufficient in themselves to convey the impression that the full olfactory constellation has upon your senses. The intimidating list of hops in the kettle is such a melange that I was fearing an unworkable muddle, but the cohesion is remarkable. Nearly stunning.
The herbaceous and spicy hop notes are surprisingly to the front of the palate - much more so than all the fruit from the nose would lead you to expect. The peppery bitterness melds with a potent malt backbone, though without too much specialty character to get in the way of the hops. Potent bitterness gives way to an equally potent burst of fruit fading to an earthy acidity in the finish. While not exactly fulfilling the promise of the nose - the flavors serve as a great foil to your expectations.
Medium mouthfeel - faintly oily yet a touch prickly at the same time. Precisely calibrated to deliver the maximum flavor without sacrificing refreshment.
As I brew more from home, I buy less and less beer - and appreciate more those beers that I am unlikely to be able to reproduce. The complexity and expense of the recipe used to create this ale, along with the assuredness of craft on display make me willing to part with $8 for a bomber without complaint. Far superior to Double Bastard in my opinion - one of Stone's best efforts to date - a pure and uncompromising example, in rare company in the style. 2,054 charactersaugustgarage, Apr 20, 2014

Bomber into Dogfish "IPA" glass.
Still looks pretty. Hazy light golden color. Nice retention, not much lace.
A spicy, diesel-like smell (referred to last year as "dankness") predominately with some floral-citrus backing.
Tastes encompassing the aforementioned diesel and citrus, as well as a bit of pine, hop bitterness, and alcohol. Not especially so of any specific quality however – they're all blended together.
Feel is practically flawless. Wet and juicy, yet not at all thick and heavy as one would expect with that combination. Neither too light nor too heavy. Very difficult to drink slowly.
Overall I don't think this year was quite as piney as last; the "dank", "diesel" smell overpowering it this time around. Probably a good thing however considering the brew's apparent motto.

Bottle into over-sized wine glass.
A - Medium density, 2-finger, light-cream head. Dissipates to be fairly loose and frothy. Moderate lacing. Light to medium amber in color. Quite spectacular, rather intense and seems to almost glow. Almost totally opaque. There is an interesting 'snap' to the carbonation on finishing the pour.
S - A deeper, darker, pine resin, alcohol, "dankness", tropical florals. Surprisingly little citrus for style.
T - Astringent bitter pine. Very little citrus if any. Not complex, but delivers as promised. Very much following smell.
M - Rather abrasive overall generally due to bitterness. Slightly warming, alcohol-type aftertaste. Otherwise smooth, nothing glaring to point out; which is to say its balanced to the point of not noticing it (beyond being a palate-wrecker).
O - "Devastatingly Dank". Yes. Basically delivers on what is expected, and does so very well. I feel it is more hop-focused/forward/centric than other DIPAs, much to its own benefit. 1,960 charactersusername, Apr 20, 2014

A: pours a clear dark gold with a generous white head that settles down quickly and leaves some great lacing.
S: gotta hand it to stone. They picked the piniest hops they could find for this one. Woodsy, maybe a little citrus, but they want this one smelling piney and that's what you get.
T: you get a little bit of the breadiness of the malt right in the front, but it gives way to the pineyness of the hops quickly. The taste of the hops doesn't linger that long though, but the bitterness does. Lot going on with this one.
M: heavy, which you expect out of a 9.8% beer, but not unpleasant. It taste as so good that you want it lingering for as long as possible. It's huge but balanced.
O: I've been off IPAs for a little while now. Not due to any sort of protest. Just making an effort to try some new stuff that's out there. So maybe it's just the fact that I haven't had many recently, but this is the best IPA I can remember drinking. It's huge, but absolutely balanced from beginning to end. I'll be stocking up on this one for the next month or so. 1,104 charactersckearns919, Apr 19, 2014

Pours an amber with a finger heard because poured aggressively, it dissipates, but leaves a ring of bubbles. Looks great
As the bottle says, devastatingly dank. The freshness of the hops is unreal. I'd have to guess cascade hops.
Taste matches the aroma. As if it came right off the bright tank. Resin and grapefruit come to mind. 
Despite being a well filtered beer, it has the mouthfeel of a beer that is bottle conditioned. Well carbonated, but has a lingering aftertaste.
Overall, this is a very special beer. I will definitely purchase Enjoy By ___ in the future. 702 charactersJordonHoltzman, Apr 19, 2014

Great golden yellow coloration. Pure white 1/4" head. Slightly cloudy.
Nose immediately picks up citrus and fruity aromas ; definitely lives up to the "devastatingly dank" hype labeled on the neck of the bottle. 
Extremely flavorful and emulates the aroma of the beer. Bold citrus flavors are elevated above the bitterness often associated with IPAs. A little "sting" is pervasive throughout each sip from the relatively high alcohol content, but it only adds to the dept of this beer's flavor profile. 
Not necessarily full, but not light by any stretch of the imagination. Carbonation provides that iconic tingly sensation on the lips with each swig. Only issue here is that it took away from the initial flavor of the beer; all you could feel was tingling and couldn't even register the front-end of the flavor.
Absolutely fantastic Double IPA that, even bottled, is the personification of what this style of beer should be. It was a fresh beer that stands apart from the rest of Stone's line-up, which is generally overrated and readily available at many bars and liquor stores in my general area. I would recommend this specific brew to anyone that enjoys hoppy beers. 1,236 charactersSpacingOutMan, Apr 18, 2014

Pours very clear yellow with touches of orange. Smell is citrus, hops, coriander. Taste is freaking fantastic, fresh, hoppy, grapefruit, subtle bitter, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is so smooth and silky, with nice carbonation.
Overall, probably the best IPA I've ever had. Bitter but finishes nice and sweet. 346 charactersJerUrbans, Apr 14, 2014

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4The Stone Enjoy by Series is, for me, becoming one of the best beer series ever. The most recent addition is the Enjoy by 4.20.14 and I think that it's the best one so far. It's very smooth and crisp IPA. I bought this for my Dad for his birthday in a growler and as soon as we were done 64oz he was asking me to go get him another one! My Dad is not a huge IPA guy so the fact that he liked this so much showed me how good this brew was/is, I was unable to operate a vehicle after a few of these due to the 9+ ABV. He said he'd try and go the next day. 553 charactersPlatoSmash, Apr 13, 2014

A - What more could you want in a beers appearance? On this one maybe just some chunkier lacing. Bright orange, slight copper tinge that glows in the glass and is capped with a 1 finger bright white head. Nice thin lacing on the glass as you drink. 
S - Dank? Hell yes. Big citrus and peach notes, pine, slight caramel, more pine notes, floral and herbal undertones. Citrus distinguishes itself as grapefruit and orange.
T - Follows the nose, big citrus flavors of mostly grapefruit send some orange cutting in.  Peach rounds it out and is prominent with the citrus notes.  Just enough caramel like sweetness to cut through the bitterness. Piney, resinous, dank and citrusy. The flavor is so bold and big my palate was shot at the end of this bomber. Bitterness was perfect, right where I'd like my DIPA. Spot on for me. Only criticism, little hot, that 9.4% ABV comes through as it warms and it does detract a bit. 
M - Fuller side of medium body. Nice carbonation that carries the flavor and a coating body with a crisp semi dry finish. Could be cleaner, this beer hung around after each sip. 
O - A spot on DIPA, guaranteed fresh, and amazing balance. With a cleaner finish and maybe a lower ABV this could be a Heady killer. Either way, it's a world class DIPA. 1,349 charactersHopBomb515, Apr 12, 2014

Very tropical. Lots of fruit and sweetness. A bit dank and heavy. 
Similar to nose, although more dank and resin like. Tropical fruit dominates. Light citrus. Faint malt. 
Fairly easy. Never overpowering from the bigger malt profile. Drinks easy and almost a bit light.
Never got old, booze was hidden really well. Complex. 409 charactersExtraStout, Apr 12, 2014

Color: Dark almost red golden color. Bronze?
Smell: This is where they get ya! This beer has about the best nose I have ever experienced. Its piney, fruity hop brilliance at its finest. Shall I say pine, bubble gum, and tropical fruit, juicy fruit gum perhaps? Then there is the dank, oh the dank. I love earthy dankness I guess.
Taste: This is bitter, but smooth, hoppy as hell, but just wonderful. I detect pine, grapefruit and other citrus fruits. This is what an IPA should taste like people! I know I am using a lot of punctuation to describe this beer, but what have I been missing out on? I have drank a lot of IPA's and DIPA's as of late and this one is the best I have had. I have never given a perfect score on a beer and I don't know if there is such an animal but this one is about as close as I have ever given. I just hope it doesn't become as hard to find as some of those others, which by the way I have never been able to get my hands on. So, maybe those are 100 beers. This one, is really really close to being my all time favorite IPA though. One complaint, at 9.4% you can't drink but one. 1,291 charactershumuloner22, Apr 11, 2014

3.75 A: Light to moderately hazed copper color. Just about one finger of frothy off-white head. Retention wasn't great, but I did pour it somewhat cold.
4.25 S: Big floral hoppiness to start. Notes of cat piss, grapefruit, pine resin, and orange and mango fruits. Really clean, which is how I like my DIPAs these days. Mild neutral maltiness with a hint of toasty caramel.
4.5 T: Again big hoppiness in this. Floral, some herbalness, piney, grapefruit are the strong flavor. Cat piss, citrus, and earth are underneath. Again clean neutral malts with light caramel.
4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Lightly creamy and super smooth.
4.25 D: Overall, a damn good DIPA. I haven't had one in a long time that impressed me, but this does. 797 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 09, 2014

Location: City Swiggers
Glassware: Tulip
Appearance: Amber to Orange in color. Pours with a pinky size white head and excellent retention. Lots of carbonation is rising to the top of the beer. 
Aromatics: The fruit is an instant aroma hit on this beer, oranges, pineapple, grapefruit and peaches just shoot through the nose. Some honeyed sweetness hidden in there as well. 
Flavor: This beer starts with all it's sweet fruits and by the end moves right into its hop resins. Just an absolutely beautiful example of a DIPA. 
Mouthfeel: The beer tastes creamy and smooth until the hop resin starts kicking in at the finish. 633 charactersKornWallace, Apr 08, 2014

S:Great smell with a lot of citrus followed by some piney hops with a slight malt
T: One of the best. A hop bomb of nice citrus,piney flavors but with a slight malt background to balance the bitter. My favorite part of this beer is the delicious aftertaste that you can taste for quite some time. This beer is really easy to drink and impressive with its high abv.
M: This beers only downside with slighty to much carbonation and a sticky feel.
Edit: just had the 7/4/14 edition and was like a completely different beer not very good and a much more harsh taste
ReReview of the 12/26/14  edition. One of my favorite ipas ive ever had delicious hoppy, citrusy, fresh taste with some amazing aftertaste and very easy to drink. Hard to describe the dank taste you get. 913 charactersGinjaSlice, Apr 08, 2014

Medium amber color, aroma heavy with floral hops. The taste is just divine. The hops hit hard up front but then the side notes of citrus come in, a hint of lemon on top of peaches. The malt base is actually present and brings a nice balance. The aftertaste is pleasantly tart with returning hop features. Would I get this one again, absolutely! 440 charactersDesMoinesMike, Apr 08, 2014

Lightly hazed orange with sudsy fluffage
Smells nice and bright: oranges, grass, and pine with little in the way of malt obstruction
Taste is a bit darker and more vegetal and herbal. Piney and moderately bitter with a bit of stickiness in the feel and a lower-moderate carbonation. Orange lurks but doesn't pop. Bonus points for being welcomingly non boozy despite its abv.
Good concept, enjoyable enough, thankfully not overly malty, yet nothing overly original or unique. 509 charactersBarrytheBear, Apr 08, 2014

Nose is full of loads of citrus, pine, and some dank notes as well. This is very resinous, and citrus almost takes a back seat, but is still very present. There is almost no malt to speak of in the nose. The taste follows along these lines, but the citrus, specifically grapefruit is more of a focal point. The resinous and dank pieces are still there, and blend wonderfully with the barely present touch of caramel malt. 
The mouthfeel is slightly thicker than medium bodied, with good active carbonation, and a slightly sticky finish. This goes down just like a DIPA should, but maybe a touch too heavy for me. Overall, this is an excellent DIPA that I look to get every time it comes in the distribution area. I love the concept of the naming / labeling, and wish more dates were clear like this. The citrus and pine work together beautifully, and the nose is an absolute hop bomb. Definitely worth the hype. 1,108 characterszimm421, Apr 06, 2014

A: Clear with no haze, pale golden in colour. Minimal head.
S: The smell was the best part, in my opinion. It was the "freshest" aspect of this beer. By this, I mean that it smelt resiny in a way that I tend to only notice in fresh beers. Lots of citrus as well.
T: This was a tasty beer and you could tell there was a lot of attention to detail. Not too bitter, with some residual sweetness. It was a well balanced IIPA, but nothing spectacular about the flavour that I haven't had before in other IIPAs.
M: Easily drinkable, not too heavy and overpowering on the palate.
O: As I mentioned with respect to the taste, this beer was not spectacular. Stone beers are overrated, but this one in particular is overrated. It is a good beer and there is no doubt about that. However, it probably is not worth the $8 since there are other IIPAs out there for less that are pretty much the same. The aroma was "fresh," but that was about the only attribute that sets this brew apart from others in the field. 1,033 charactersHam-Nord, Apr 05, 2014
4.52/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally decided to review this beer after many many bottles and a few on-tap. This stuff is good, like REALLY good. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher than it is really. This is a serious Imperial IPA. It tastes like one, smells like one, etc. Its probably a little sweeter and malty'er than any other double I have had, and I personally attribute that to the freshness. This months bottle, 04-20-2014 is probably the best one I've had. I'm sure that's just a coincidence... If you have not tried this offering from Stone, try it out ASAP. You probably are not going to find anything better anytime soon. There are few others out there that compete, but are not nearly as READILY AVAILABLE as Stone Enjoy By. Tastes absolutely fantastic straight from a bottle, but if you must, pour it into a glass and do all that looking and sniffing, then gulp it down all the same. Enjoy! 876 charactersturbotype, Apr 05, 2014

Semi-cloudy copper-orange with frothy 1/2” head on the first pour. 2nd pour was clearer and head was thicker, about 1”. Smell is intense, pungent grapefruit citrus, pine resin. The alcohol scent is apparent behind these as well. Taste mostly follows nose; citrus and pine, with an earthy undertone. Malt is understated. Not as tongue-coating as I expected, although the hops are definitely front and center; finishes fairly clean, considering the style and ABV. Medium-to-full-bodied with moderate carbonation.

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have now enjoyed both the 4/20 and the 2/14 versions of the "Enjoy By". I've like every Stone offering that I've tried, so I wasn't surprised to enjoy these. This is an imminently drinkable ale for this amount of alcohol. This had well rounded flavor and seemed to have less of the sweetness than the Lagunitas Undercover. (Which was also amazing) This featured a nice head, pleasant aroma, and smooth mouthfeel. 414 charactersEdwardK77, Apr 05, 2014

This one pours a beautiful shade of copper with a two finger fluffy white head that teases you to sip what's beneath. I say sip because this is truely a DIPA weighing in at 9.4%. Heavy speckled lacing dresses up the glass screaming freshness.
Aroma is rich and earthy with pine and grapefruit signaling to the taste buds "this beer has balance". Hops, hops and more hops...
Taste is big and bold and full of flavor. Pine, grapefruit and a spicey blend sums it up. Damn this is tastey.
Mouthfeel is bitter sweet draped over a medium body. Near perfect bitter aftertaste, much smoother than I was expecting. Don't get me wrong, this isn't sessionable by any stretch of the imagination but it isn't difficult to put down either.
Overall, a super addition to Stone's IPA portfolio. I've enjoyed all three "Enjoy By's" and have been pleased with each offering. 984 characters05Harley, Apr 04, 2014

Smell is classic stone. Piney, hoppy and crisp.
The head is think but laces beautifully down the glass.
Nice strong hops up front. Pine, citrus, peachy maybe a little pineapple. Very slight malt presence, very effervescent and slight resinous as you swallow. Strongly bitter after taste/ as it goes down. 
Overall a terrific expansion on what Stone normally does with their regular IPA and definitely has a slightly more diverse bouquet. I would prefer a little less bitterness and maybe a little more balance, but overall this is quite the terrific DIPA. Stone rarely disappoints and they sure as hell don't with this one. 681 charactersBearslikeBeers, Apr 04, 2014

A: Pours a bright and clear golden/orange. Large thick off white head. Good retention 
at first, but this does not last. The lacing is also not much to talk about.
S: Strong and fresh. Citrus. Pine. Hops. Resin. Pineapple. Hops. Dry. Malty. Hops.
T/M: Not unlike the aroma. Citrus flavors such as grapefruit and pineapple. Strong dank
hops. Pine. Hop resin. Bitter, but balanced well enough with malts. The finish has hop
bitterness and a linger of citrus. An alcohol taste comes through slightly. 
O: World Class. Delicious. Hop Bomb. Great citrus flavors. Not too extreme which helps
with the drinkability. This beer is a must try if you're a Hophead.

Clear, bright orange. Almost no head. Some lacing along the glass.
Lots of grapefruit citrus, fresh pine, granny smith, grass, mint, slight alcohol
Sticky piney notes, juicy citrus fruit, slightly sweet malts to balance abundant bitterness, hint of booze.
Medium body with light carbonation. A little bit of heat with finishes with a bitter tinge.
Stoked I finally got to try this one. Truly dank. Truly delicious. 436 charactersTheMultiYeast, Apr 02, 2014

Nose of sweet citrus (mango, orange) over a light grapefruit and earthy dankness background. Light medium bodied with a slick texture. Normally carbonated with no effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavors over a slight biscuit sweetness with a low level of bitterness. It begins with the sweet citrus flavors which are soon overpowered by the dank earthy hop components. While complex, the flavor is heavily "dankcentric" - lol. On the smooth finish, you get a bit of biscuit sweetness flowing into the dankcentric vortex coupled with a nice residual alcohol tingle at the back of the throat. An exceptional beer that those which wonder what dank means should try. 795 characterstillmac62, Mar 31, 2014

Had a few other ones, all fantastic. Figured I'd finally give it a review. Serving type: 22oz bomber poured into my Tree House Brewing tulip
A: Super clear orange. Very small head. Decent lacing
S: Even through a cold, DANK is delivered as promised. Smells like I'm smelling a bag of hops. Pine, grapefruit....big delicious hop aromas.
T: WOW. Big flavor without being bitter or overpowering with the hops. Tropical fruits, grapefruit, pine. Again, not overpowering or super bitter. Delicious. Sweetness, but not cloying. Big flavors all around, but the balance is unreal. Found that as it warms up, the tropical flavors and aroma come forward a lot more. Fantastic.
M: Perhaps a bit overcarbonated at first, but not bad at all. Medium mouthfeel, a bit thicker than a lot of IPAs. Surprised at how dry it finishes with the amount of sweetness it has.
O: Just a fantastic beer. Have had 3 or 4 of the Enjoy By series, and they all impress me. A perfect example of what an IPA should be, at least to me. I love them like this, big tropical fruit, with enough bitterness to know it's there. 1,109 charactersBarRoomHero88, Mar 31, 2014

Pours a slightly hazy orange golden, bit of white sudsy lacing for a head.
Smells of orange blossom honey, sweet biscuit, some citrus, and extraordinarily fresh fruity and floral hops. 
Flavor is of orange, honey, biscuit, and a range of hop flavors ranging from floral and fruity to piney and dry. 
Full body with stinging carbonation on the roof of the mouth.
A very exceptional IPA with a supremely fresh aroma and flavor. Not the best IPA ever, but in the higher class of IPAs for sure and provides a unique character beyond just the freshness. Drinks very easy for its strength. 616 charactersCylinsier, Mar 31, 2014

It tastes very much like grapefruit as well. The last edition tasted like grapefruit, but the 04-20-14 edition tastes very much like a grapefruit with a strong hop presence and minimum malt presence.

A- fairly clear (a tad hazy), copper, orange hue. Appealing. 
S- excellent nose. Pine!!!! Some grass, too. Some floral notes to boot. 
T- big full wallop of resin (and that pine), lingers throughout. Bitter soon follows and strengthens at the end. Didn't note much of the citrus thing, unfortunately, compared to some the other reviews.
M- big, full, dry.
O- I'm a sucker for Stone (love Ruination!), and easily fall prey to the "enjoy by" campaign, so I'm a lock to try each offering. Not sure how long they've been doing this (started last year, I think), but I really, really liked the one I had in '13. That said, I'm glad I bought the 4-20-14. I "enjoyed" it, but won't be picking up another. A quality IPA, indeed, but not worth another round. Look forward to future offerings.

A - Pours a remarkably clear pale orange, with a finger of head that clears out quickly, but leaves nice sticky lacing.
S - wow, they aren't kidding with that "devastatingly dank" tag line. I get big swampy dank notes of raw hops. I just finished brewing a batch of beer and the nose on this beer is like ziplock baggies of pure hop pellets. It smells green -- grass, marijuana, green onion, lemon grass, with faint touches of pine and mango.
T - Big, concentrated doses of mango, pineapple, onion, with a tinge of lemon and pine around the edges. Juicy middle; bitter and savory on the back end.
M - mouthfeel is big and full, with ample sweetness, but a dry finish. 
Overall, this is a big, in your face DIPA with nothing to hide. It may be the most savory IPA I've ever had. This is the first time that all those descriptors like onion, garlic and cat piss really resounded with me. There is some tropical sweetness to balance things out, but I think this is not quite my cup of tea. A great beer, but they could tone back the CTZ, Summit, or whatever's bringing the onion. 1,098 charactersMongrel, Mar 30, 2014

well I guess I better review this, as it is my fave beer. 
s- are there hippies in my house? dankness. and pine, almost equally balanced. some citrus in there too. 
a - clear copper with a thin white head that disappears fast but laces. I've seen prettier beers but appetizing looking. 
m - sticky and full. good carbonation level for this beer. 
t - I have not had all the "trophy" beers but I've had a bunch of them. and I would put this up at the very top. what enjoy does (similar to what makes heady different from all the rest of the IIPA's) is it throws in a healthy amount of dankness to add some depth to the usual pine and citrus thing. comes on bitter and dank on the front end, with citrus and pine notes behind it. has a floral and dry finish. enjoy does not "hide" it's alcohol as well as a lot of beers which gives it a spicy alcohol burn that you may like or hate. finishes very dry. the only problem with enjoy is I feel obligated to drink as much of it as possible when you can get it around here. which can quickly lead to trouble :( 1,113 charactersitsratso, Mar 30, 2014

A - Upon pouring from the bottle, a thick white head developed, but dissipated quickly. Body is an agreeable amber hue with no haziness.
S - Cantaloupe, citrus, honey-sweetness
T - First comes a wave of citrus - Meyer lemon immediately comes to mind. Then, a hearty malt backbone with berry-like sweetness on the center of the tongue. Some onion and savory flavors follow, especially as the beer warms up. However, the savory notes never become overbearing. Aftertaste is residual bitterness and pine all over the palette.
M - Creamy mouthfeel to counteract everything else going on in the beer. Perhaps a tad over-carbonated at first sip, but that mellows out over time.
O - Stone really does this beer right. Although I think it is best enjoyed on-tap, the bottle is one of the best to be had at the local package store. It does age quickly, so heed the advice on the label. 936 charactersporter_collie, Mar 30, 2014

 From the bomber into a standard pint glass results in a very bright,clear golden body capped by a one inch head that slowly falls into a very determined cap of foam with sticky lace all over. 
 Aroma is pungent pine resin, marijuana,fresh cut grass, not overpowering but substantial.
 Taste is upfront hop bitter with a pronounced malt sweetness for balance, but here is where I get off this train, there is a very strong medicinal alcohol flavor that for me is distracting.
 On the juicy side. More of a sipper than a refreshing drink
 One and done for me, I prefer my DIPAs to hide the alcohol better, Pliny the Elder, Lagunitas Sucks and Boneyard Hop Venom do it better. All that said It's a very good beer and if the other ones are not available I'd never turn this down 804 charactersmudbug, Mar 29, 2014

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Found at the local bottle shop. Happy that it showed up.
A: Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Pours a white 1.5 finger head that leaves some decent lacing. Hazy, ruddy, straw color.
S: Great nose on this beer. Flowery and grassy notes right away that fade into strong pine and grapefruit aromas.
T: Very balanced for the amount of hops in the nose. It starts off with flowery/pollen flavors that follow up with a toasty, bready, even biscuity. Ends with a moderate hop bite that sits on the back of the tongue. Really hides the alcohol as it only really shows up as a slight sweetness throughout. 
M: Medium heavy mouth feel. Really sits in your mouth, but not in a bad way. Easy to sip or quaff if you feel like it (though I wouldn't recommend it).
O: Really great DIPA. I can't find much of a flaw with it at all. If it was around all the time it would be a regular in my lineup. Highly recommended if you can find it. Stone does another great highly hopped beer. 969 charactersJohannBock, Mar 29, 2014

A: Tangerine.
S: Pine, marijuana, apricot, and jasmine.
T: A wave of aggressive bitterness that we've all come to expect from Stone. After that comes a heavy dose of sweetness, tropical fruit, and flowers. It tastes thick and pungent, like nectar. Mangoes and jasmine. It's almost overwhelming. Then the bitterness and astringency returns to leave you yearning for another sip.
M: From nectar to a drying finish.
O: Solid. I had prepared myself to be disappointed given the hype but this is definitely worthy of the praise. 548 characters01001111, Mar 29, 2014
4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I have had this previously. Written this full review based on 4-20-14 version.  Note:  Additions made based on 12-26-14 version.
A - Copper orange clear pour with a frisky white head that forms and fades fairly quickly, leaving behind extensive lacing.
S - Full frontal hops here. Smacks the nose up with a big resin core, pine front with citrus hints, but with danker notes, too. The fruit is more forward in some versions (e.g. 12-26-14) and not in others (e.g., 4-20-14). Given the hop explosion, a few of the darker elements of a hop bomb sometimes float up, too (cat urine in the 4-20 version), but well in control, and always second to the fruit and pine.
T - Where the smell leads, but without all the random hop cacophony. The taste is controlled with its explosive power. This hop bomb pulls no punch, offers no quarter. It is bitter and proud. But the pine, hop resin, and grapefruit pith are all tied to a fine malt backbone that levels things out and allows the explosion to go off without wrecking things. A nice trick. Bright notes come to a sweeter middle mark as the malt comes in with its cracker and sugar notes, closing with a wicked hook back to hop bitterness, which builds but does not crush the palate.
M - Crisp, moderate carbonation, but with some drying that builds as you drink. Still, given the nature of the brew, this is a very easy beer to drink. Dropping nearly 10% ABV in the process, the alcohol is essentially hidden until you feel it.
O - When I picked up this offering for the first time, I'd never had a true blue IPA or DIPA. This opened my eyes, and so wins major points for its role. But the beer holds up to the high initial rating I gave it because it delivers on its promise. A big, bold hop celebration, to be drunk quickly but not forgotten. Well worth the price. 1,814 charactersTsar_Riga, Mar 29, 2014

Freshness: Enjoy by 04-20-2014
Packaging: 22 oz. brown bottle, pry-cap
Glassware: Tulip
Purchased: Single from Frugal MacDoogal, Nashville
A: Beer is a dark copper color, semi-clear. The off-white head has good retention and lacing. 
S: Aromas are of citrus and piney hops, with grapefruit and also a green onion smell.
T: The taste features a big hoppy bitterness, very resinous and somewhat astringent. The green onion I noticed in the aroma is also present in the flavors. 
M: Chewy mouthfeel with a high carbonation level. The finish is bitter and astringent. 
O: Overall a good DIPA but seemed one dimensional with little malt presence. Also the green onion seemed like an off-flavor. 716 characterssommersb, Mar 29, 2014

M: Perfect

Bittering is much milder and seems to be off balance now. Flavor is still solid but it is missing the 'grapey' (nelson sauvin?)finish I thought made this beer so unique. Dank hops are much more noticeable in this version. Not sure what has happened to the recipe or if hops used are no longer cost effective but it is not the awesome hop head offering it once was in 2013. Too bad this was definitely one of my favorite readily available IPA's in my area. 558 charactersJbats, Mar 28, 2014

The lunch was sooo much better that it may influence my relatively low rating. This beer had a somewhat soapy taste and while there was a lot of hop bitterness up front, there wasn't too much balance. Also the smell was pretty run of the mill with some mediocre pine and citrus but nothing that really stood out. Maybe Stone advertising the freshness has led to this one being though of more highly than it should otherwise be. I will revisit in bottle form though. 525 charactersglazeman, Mar 28, 2014

Pours a brass color with a foamy head. Looks good. Hop stink: resin, green onion, over-ripe fruit, guava BO. What a taste! DIPA with sweetness in check (I love that). Lots of oily hops on the palate. Citrus, tropical fruit, garlic chives, sap, resin. Bitterness is fully present, but very well-balanced. Well-hidden alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, full, and a bit chewy. Not too heavy. This is about as close to perfect as a DIPA gets. 452 charactersgoochpunch, Mar 28, 2014

This beer pours an ever so slightly hazy, medium golden amber hue, with three fingers of puffy, tightly foamy, and somewhat bubbly ecru head, which leaves some blotchy streaks of soap sud lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.
It smells of musty wet vegetation - ok, 'dank' - piney, leafy, and grassy, all - over-aged orange, lemon, pineapple and kiwi citrus rind, and a fairly laid-back bready, kind of crackery pale and caramel maltiness. The taste is pretty much the same, except noticeably more bitter - muggy pine resin and cones, acrid leafy notes, a citrus pith key party, some gritty, and near-overwritten bready and caramel malt, a touch of crispy biscuit, hints of tropical fruit, and the mere suggestion of metallic alcohol.
The carbonation is decently tight and frothy, the body a sturdy middleweight, and weirdly smooth, what with all that hop bitterness running around like the proverbial chicken (I'm not insinuating anything poultry-like at all about this offering). It finishes off-dry, barely, the hops stuttering just a bit, but re-setting and driving forward in no time flat.
Fresh, and yet dank, in the same physical space - wow! A five-week enjoy-by window is ballsy, is what it is, but it does make its point about freshness and point of origin and Stone's hubris just fine. I wonder what it would be like to be able to try each successive release of this - probably, like anything, one would just get bored of it. Or not - this is one tasty, tasty DIPA, the hops large and in charge, and the near 19 proof booze significantly less 'fresh' and in your face. 1,812 charactersbiboergosum, Mar 27, 2014

One of the most unique beers I've ever had. First time writing a review because I wanted to make note to myself in the future that this was for the 04.20.14 variety of the Enjoy By series. Smell and appearance are both excellent. Taste is very unique and like no other IPA I've had before. They mean it when they say Devastatingly Dank. 376 charactersDestroyinator, Mar 27, 2014

Appearance: It has a nice semi-hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice thick off-white head that dies down moderately slow and leaves nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of citrus, pineapple, grapefruit and plenty of pine resins. Total hop bomb! 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has loads of tropical fruit (citrus, pineapple, mango and grapefruit), a nice resiny pine bitterness, light floral notes and some bready malts. 
Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with an outstanding overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. 645 charactersSebD, Mar 26, 2014

Appearance: Brilliant gold color with a head that dissipates quickly. Light lacing.
Smell: Awesome. A heavy grapefruit aroma with undertones of pine and malt. I could smell this beer all day.
Taste: I could drink this beer all day as well, if my liver allowed. Follows the nose, with a powerful grapefruit/tropical flavor that balances well with a slight pine taste and large amount of hop bitterness. Aftertaste is malty with lingering citrus. Absolutely delicious.
Mouthfeel: Thick, well-carbonated, and full-bodied. Slight alcohol burn.
Overall: One of my favorite double IPAs. As far as Enjoy By releases go, this one might be my favorite. 709 charactersBedrocker, Mar 25, 2014

Still the pick of the Spring for moi. So tasty.
Dropped in a Bomber Bottle at 7.99 $ per. It's a the deal of the day.
Pours out golden with a very light haze. BIg head that recedes quickly. 
Aroma is piney, citrus notes with pineapple. 
Palette is crisp. Light (well. Lighter for a medium body)
Taste is not as heavy on the pine as last year but big fruit. Pineapple, orange with a welcomed lingering bitter bite on the back end.
Abv at 9.4% is well balanced. Perhaps a touch of bite on the initial taste. 528 charactersFATKIDREVOLUTION, Mar 24, 2014

4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5APPEARANCE: A fluffy, finger and a half head rests atop a light orange and transparent beer. A few lazy bubbles make their way to the surface as the head fades at a similarly slow pace. Good looking beer, but not a whole lot of lacing.
SMELL: Dank and delicious smelling. The aroma on this beer gets me every time…so good. Piney resin plays around with not-so-subtle grapefruit notes and an underlying grassiness. Tropical fruits round it out with a little sweetness.
TASTE: Less surprising than anything else you’ll read about this beer, it tastes amazingly fresh, but just two weeks away from the brewery, what else should I expect? Enjoy By is the beer equivalent of Phil Spector’s wall of sound. Multiple, big layers of deliciousness all seem to attack the palate at the same time. Pine and grass provide a base for big citrus and tropical fruit flavors to blend perfectly with. Also, I’m getting an unexpected (but not unwanted) hint of white chocolate with the finish. 
MOUTHFEEL: Bitterly balanced is the best way to describe the mouthfeel of Enjoy By. The balancing malt arrives with just enough strength and just in time to leave the palate teased for the bitterness of that next fresh sip. In terms of body, this would fall into the bigger end of the medium-to-big-bodied category.
OVERALL: The best way to sum up this beer is that it is simply a well put together Double IPA. Also, I love the short shelf life, ensuring that if I can find one it will be fresh with 100% certainty. Hope Colorado gets more in the next round. 1,546 charactersStoneTSR, Mar 24, 2014

This beer is super fresh and super hoppy. It's what most hop heads dream about every night as their perfect beer. It's actually not too expensive considering the amount of work that goes into getting a 1 month old or fresher beer from the brewery to the store shelves. I won't talk the beer up too much, so you can have your mind blown too. 384 charactersBeerNoobNC, Mar 24, 2014

A- a perfectly clear golden hue with orange highlights. Plenty of visible carbonation. A nice very off white froth sits atop. Plenty of lacing.
S- Lots going on. Red grapefruit, hempy/tobacco note, lemon peel, mandarin orange, pear and some mango.
T-Big smack of bitterness up front. Alcohol. Hops follow the nose, but there is a lot more of that onion/garlic thing going on in the flavor. The only thing that holds the taste back from a "5" rating would be if the hop flavor popped just a bit more, and the bitterness backed off just a touch. It's fairly bitter throughout.
M- Medium body, syrupy, but plenty of carbonation to move things along.
O- Very good, and certainly and upgrade over ruination. 749 charactersJWU, Mar 23, 2014

Appearence is a great transparent honey color. Aroma is one of the best DIPA smells around. Great balance of citrus , sweetness - maybe honey, slight pine and floral features. Taste is incredible and follows the nose. This release tastes even better than I remeber the last one being. Buy them all!!
Update - Enjoy by 7/04/14
Super floral - even more so than the 4/20 release. Still delicious, but a little dryer than I remember. 503 charactershops202, Mar 23, 2014

*Enjoy by 4/20/14, bottled on 3/13/14, consumed on 3/22/14.*
A: Pours an ever-so-slightly hazy honey amber with a commendable two-finger head that retains for ages. Eventually dwindles down to a creamy cap, but leaves ABSURD amounts of lacing down the glass. The head retention is a bit weaker than I had hoped, but it's still a gorgeous bit of eye candy, nonetheless.
S: Oh my god, where do I even begin? This is just an absolute perfect display of American hops and what a DIPA should smell like. It's floral, piney, citrusy, dank, rustic as hell, and just... pure, unadulterated fresh hop perfection! It did get a little too boozy in the nose as it warmed up, but it's not too much of an issue.
T: The flavors pretty much follow the nose inch for inch, except for the fact that the malt backbone is present in the initial sip. A little bit of honeybread sweetness teases you before you're absolutely piledrived through the floor by the hop rampage. Did I mention malts somewhere? Because I seem to have forgotten their existence... An absolute barrage of everything hoppy. Grapefruit and orange citrus notes, followed by some rustic pine, grass, and floral flavors, eventually finishing in pure earthen bitterness that leaves the palate screaming for m(ercy)ore.
M: Closer to a full-body with the perfect level of carbonation. Not as creamy as some DIPAs, which isn't really a disappointment. It made it almost too easy to drink, though. The only thing slowing me down from pounding this was my absolute respect for the brew and its complexity, along with how warm my face was feeling halfway through.
O: This is admittedly my first experience with a Stone Enjoy By xx/xx/xx IPA and it has absolutely changed the way I look at life. I've had good IPAs in the past, but never anything this fresh, this complex, this perfectly crafted. Stone Enjoy By, I feel, has ruined me... because now as soon as the next release is mentioned, I'm going to be flailing like a madman trying to get my hands on a bottle or two. I hate to sound too much like a fanboy, but this has honestly been an experience like no other. 2,143 charactersThePaintedGrey, Mar 23, 2014

Nice carbonation. Mouthfeel is substantial without being syrupy.
Great beer for a hop fan. Not the best DIPA, but definitely worth grabbing a bottle or two before the enjoy by date (after which, I assume, Stone's fairy god mother spell expires and the beer magically transforms into skunk Natty Light). 410 charactersmsquared36, Mar 22, 2014

T: Very fresh. I taste more pine than citrus. Leaves a nice bitter hop taste that lingers long after, reminding you it's time for another sip. Ever so slight taste of alcohol.

A - very appealing pale honey. Outstanding off-white head and lacing that lasts. 
S - powerful hops, bright, crisp citrus and pine. 
T - they're not kidding: this is about as fresh as you can get by bottle! Gorgeous IPA profile; not medicinal at all.

F - Creamy full bodied with a nice amount of head.

2.14.14
Poured into snifter; light orange, clear, very light for the style (following the trend of others). Moderate white head that fades quickly. 
Smell is awesome...onions, tropical fruit, citrus, pine, bitterness, awesome. This is like a west-coast version of Hop Ranch. 
Taste is also like a west-coast Hop Ranch...onion, fruit, pine, citrus, bitterness, earthy...damn. Sweet, fruity, oniony, awesome IPA. Fresh as hell and delicious.

Smells amazing...bright tropical fruit, mango, sweet onion, weed, candy sugar, mint, herb.
Taste...wow. Sweet peach, mango, onion, apple, mint, herbal, sugar, tangerine, grapefruit...incredible. The hop flavor packed into this beer is mind-blowing.

Dark golden orange sun kissed copper, an even cloudiness keeps it from being completely transparent. As it warms, it clears. White head, fades fast, little to no lacing.
Pine tar on the nose mixing with fresh citrus and a touch of sweet tropics fill the nose.
First sip...medium carbonation...an extremely creamy mouthfeel but watery too? Peaches up front mix with the sweetness of honey. Rounds out with some caramel and green pine and a quick bitter finish. A warm alcohol lingers on the throat...white pepper on the tongue.
I'm a big fan of double IPAs (my favorite style) and was really looking forward to this beer...my first Enjoy By. I've read the reviews and comments in the forums...and must say I'm disappointed. I've let it warm and sipped it slow but something is off? It's not much older than a week, so freshness isn't the problem. Seems a little to watery for a double, a little lighter in color than I'm use too...those things I can live with but there is an "off" flavor that I'm not familiar with...charcoal? Maybe I just don't like "dank"? I guess my expectations were so high I'm trying to find excuses why I think this is only good and not great...it is what it is...for me...good but not great.
Im so surprised at my review's outcome I will try one more Enjoy By in the future and comment further. 1,388 charactersBoca-X, Mar 21, 2014

A: Dark copper, but fairly transparent; very thin head that dissipates within a few minutes.

T: Hoppy, tropical and dank (sound familiar?). The beer makes no qualms about what it is: A West Coast DIPA.
M: Warm and oily with mild carbonation and a full finish.
O: I'll preface this with the fact that 4.20.14 is slightly different than other Enjoy Bys, but that said, it still stays true to the original recipe. It's more dank than usual, yet you're still looking at the same overwhelming hop aroma and flavors bombarding you throughout (in a great way). 752 charactersJohnCassillo, Mar 19, 2014

O - This offering by Stone is unbelievable. It's almost good enough to curb my mourning for the lack of Pliny here in WA. 447 charactersZachHodgson, Mar 18, 2014

A: Brilliantly clear amber/golden body with small amount of head. A small amount of lacing persists as the head recedes.
S: Good lord I could smell this beauty from five feet away when it was cracked. Intense mango, orange zest, and a bit of grapefruit in the nose. A bit of malt sweetness comes through as it warms. Wish they made car fresheners that smelled like this.
F: Resinous hops. Passionfruit/mango followed by some pine. A bit of crackery malt followed by warming alcohol and an assertive punch of bitterness. Delicious.
M: Medium bodied with slick hop oil covering the palate. Prickly carbonation persists throughout.
Overall just a fantastic beer. When fresh it is borderline sensory overload. Love this stuff. It probably helps that Nelson and Galaxy are two of my favorite hops. 820 charactersMore_betterness, Mar 18, 2014

A- Pours a clear honey yellow with a hue of orange, carbonation throughout, Nice white fluffy head that laces and sticks on the sides. Nice bright colors.
S- Grapefruit, hops, oranges, crisp clean grass and hints of pine. All kinds of goodness to the nose.
T- Very much like the nose, just as crisp and clean with a bright hoppy slightly bitter finish, very good.
M- Light body, decent carbonation, clean. Slight bitterness that is from start to finish.
O- Very impressive from the full sensory overload to the nose, to the crisp bitter taste. 570 charactersGryphon69, Mar 17, 2014
4.15/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This was an October release (can't remember exact date.) A bright golden color and strong pine hops made this beer an excellent IPA. The bitterness was not overwhelming.
Very memorable. Served from a Chimay chalice between 40-45. 
I am looking forward to another one of these. 278 charactersTenor, Mar 17, 2014

Appearance: A dark golden color with a whitish head. The head doesn't persist all that much but it's still nice looking. A lot of very small bubbles throughout. 
Aroma: Grassy hops are the primary aroma of this one. I like it but it's a little bit much. I want to pick up some of the other aromas like the malt and some fruits but this is really just a grassy hop bomb. 
Mouthfeel: Good mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation levels
Taste: This one tastes like it smells. There is a slight alcohol touch to it but really the biggest, in your face flavor are the grassy hops. There is a little malt backbone that stands up a little bit to the hops but it's definitely an IPA
Overall: It's not bad, not my favorite beer but certainly something that I would have again when it comes out next time. 929 charactersBeerEngineer, Feb 18, 2014

It's that good.

A - Poured with a relatively thin, but fluffy, white head. As it dissipates it leaves some nice, sticky lacing on the glass. Color is dark gold/amber which looks quite appealing. 
S - Big time citrusy and fruity hops up front. I'm getting lots of pineapple with some mango mixed in. There are some hints of pine/resin in the background but I feel they're overwhelmed by pineapple/mango. I'm not noticing any malt character or any presence of alcohol. Wonderful smelling IPA...one of the best I've experienced so far, IMO.
T - Some malt sweetness right up front that explodes into pure, bitter hop flavor. Unlike the smell I'd characterize the hop flavor as dank and resinous. There are some tropical fruit flavors in there (mango, papaya?) but the pine/resin flavors are right in my face. I love it. I find the flavor, overall, to be more on the bitter side compared to some other IPAs and DIPAs I've had. The finish is dry and bitter, though not at all unpleasant.
M - Medium to light carbonation. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side for an IPA with such big flavor. With that said, it is a very crisp IPA that's quite refreshing considering that it's over 9% ABV.
O - Excellent DIPA. I'm glad I was able to find this one while out and about at my local beer store. This one is definitely for beer lovers who enjoy the bitterness that hops bring to the table. I'll be keeping my eyes open for the next installment. 1,483 charactersCJRubes, Feb 14, 2014

4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy by 2/14/14. Honey yellow in color with the slightest haze. Started with a shirt white foam that left ladder of sticky lacings down the glass. Pungent, earthy, citrus hop aromas with a hint of malty sweetness beneath. Smooth, incredibly delicate feel with gentle, lazy carbonation and an oily feel toward the finish. Flavor was similar to aroma. Pungent citrus, pineapple, and rioe grapefruit flavors uo front with a tangy hop bite through the middle. Caramel malt flavors peek through toward the end. Very enjoyable.
Sampled again....Enjoy By 7/4/16.....notes from 2 years ago are still spot on. Golden yellow in color with just the slightest haze. Poured with a short, creamy, snow white foam with good retention. Medium high tropical citrus hop aromas of pineapple, mango, and ripe orange. Medium light malt aromas. Medium bodied with smooth creamy feel through middle and lazy medium carbonation. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Medium high hop flavors up front. A fantastic blend of citrus and tropical flavors along with spicy notes. Medium hop bitterness through the middle that transitions to spicy hops and booziness to the end. Finished semi-dryly with a light maltiness followed by ripe tropical hop aftrrtaste. This bursts with fresh hop flavors. Booziness presence is undeniable, but very pleasant and mellow. 1,346 charactersIronLover, Feb 13, 2014

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler poured into pint glass
A: Nice light goldenrod hue topped with a one and a half finger head. The head is fickle and quite paper white. Carbonation is apparent, but underwhelming. I’ll have to continue evaluation on the next pour. 
A more aggressive pour brings out a bit of the visible carbonation and releases the aroma a bit more. Looks medium/light and drinkable. Lacing on this pour is much more evident. 
S: Citrus punch! Grapefruit, bits of lemon and orange, after a big sniff the nose rounds off with dry scents of fresh florals, which are earthy and inviting. Just before the floweriness begins to dominate the nose, I pick up mellow sweet fruits, mango and other light tropical fruits, suppressed banana & pear. Somewhere in the earthy essence there’s some dry pine/wood but its built into the complexity. Overall very aromatic and dominated by many delightful esters, one of the best. 
T: Follows the nose (expected and excellent). The taste is fresh and clean, with the freshness provided by the circus of zesty citrus flavors. Spices trace the citrus, possibly spearmint and ginger that facilitate the transition to a dry flower flavor. The ABV is completely hidden, no boozy character, although there is a slight hotness (presumably from the spice citrus blend). 
M: Immediate aftertaste is a woody sweetness that is somewhat dry and makes you want more. The carbonation is hard to assess awing to the various flavor facets that continue to assault the palate. 
O: This along with one or two other DIPAs have really revitalized my love of the style. This is damn fresh and damn tasty. Kinda jumped on the tail end of this 2.14.14, but its fresh taste is still in your face. This has me amped for the next installment of this #EnjoyBy series.

Over the past week I have tasted Heady Topper, Hi - Res and now Enjoy By. All 3 are incredible beers. I place Enjoy By in the middle but closer to Heady than Hi - Res. 
Great color, cleaner than Heady. I poured into a pint glass the head was not noteworthy, but the lacing was. 
Aroma is fantastic, but my sense of smell is horrid
Taste is clean and maybe a bit more bitter.... Grapefruit? than I prefer, but I assume I will get used to that in the world of IPA's
Overall, I will buy this any chance I get as it was relatively cheap at $9 for the bottle. 653 charactersdonbet69, Feb 12, 2014

Pours a orangy golden with one finger of head. Classic example of an IPA.
The moment I took the cap off the bottle, I could smell the aroma of this beauty. I got a LOT of papaya, maybe 80% papaya, 10% pineapple, 10% orange/grapefruit. Just spectacular, juicy, and tropical smelling. 
The taste was the smell, plus malt, more sweetness, and more hoppiness. Very well balanced, and I got absolutely zero alcohol on the taste. VERY well made, and now I see what the hype is all about. 
Overall, I base my opinion on whether or not I would buy the beer again, so I take into account the price, taste, and availability. A bomber for $10 that is hard to find, to me, is a steal for this type of beer. Phenomenal! 798 charactersbball208, Feb 11, 2014

A: amber with a very predominate white head, carbonation is high almost reminiscent of a soda. 
S: Very citrusy with mild hints of earthiness as it warms up. 
T: Phenomenally tame for a double IPA, meaning most double IPAs make me want to punch a hole in a wall from the inherent bitterness. But this is very subtle it's much lighter than most of there dIPA's I've had. The hops have a grapefruit and mild hint of orange very appealing taste. 
M: Lightly carbonated and is very different from the rest of Stone's range of IPA where usually there is a large lingering aftertaste of the overwhelming hops. 
O: Definitely in my top 10 of DIPA's there are few that can have this light and easily drinkable qualities and still be called a DIPA. Will definitely be looking for the next Enjoy By. 810 charactersTonerelia, Feb 08, 2014

A: golden-amber with little head, not much lacing
S: orange with sweet caramel notes
T/M: much like the smell, very malt forward, melding into orange blossoms, then into a grassy (tinged with citrus). Mildly dry pull that lingers.
O: very good beer. Could maybe be a little less sweet, but love the citrus backbone of this beer, as well as the malt front and somewhat dry finish.
#12: 11-12-13
A: clear golden amber, but more lacing in this pour
S: same, but I notice an earthiness this time
T/M: more bitterness I notice up front in this one, less sweet than I reviewed before.
O: I didn't change any of my ratings, but I think I expected better given the rating versus what I thought about this tasting. Given that, I await my next one to see if I should adjust my rating.
#14: 2-14-14 (adjusted ratings up)
A+: more lacing
S-: weaker to me
T: definitely more bitter than original review, but there is what I now consider mango flavor (not orange).

Poured into a tulip. Crystal clear golden orange with a finger of head. 
Scent of dry piney hops, as per ushe, and a hint of sweetness that's tough to describe.
Different kind of bitterness here. More orange than grapefruit. Can't put my finger on it, maybe it's those New Zealand hops. Not as bitter as anticipated. Actually a tiny bit sour, interesting. A bit let down by the bitterness, but it makes up for it with the complexity of it. The more I drink of it the more orange I'm getting. Gets better as it warms.
Thin and drinkable with an aftertaste that hits periodically after the sip.
Overall a solid IPA, not in my top 10, but earns points for surprising me with something different in an IPA. 715 charactersPeterParker, Feb 06, 2014

Bottled: 1/10/14
Drinking: 2/4/14
Setting: Living room couch watching Seinfeld. Putty was the best character on that show.
A: Pours a hazy orange/tangerine color with a soapy and rocky white head of about 2 fingers, which dissipates to about 1 finger as the beer sets. Definitely can't see through this one. Hazy and rich. I can smell it from here! 
S: Tangerine, orange, and grapefruit. Lots and lots of citrus. Undertones of lemon zest with bread grains. Faint hint of resin'y pine. 
T: Taste is full forward candied orange peel and a blast of grapefruit juice. Enjoyable sweetness from the get-go, but not cloying. A touch of alcohol as the sip warms on the tongue, but incredibly well hidden for being 9.4%. VERY DRINKABLE. Bitterness is retained throughout, and mellows into subtle biscuit notes towards the end. Not as much pine in the taste as I detected in the nose. This is a wonderful citrus bomb and again, I can't get over how smooth this is to drink.
MF: The carbonation is perfect in my opinion. It's just enough to allow the flavors to pop once you take a sip, but not so much that it dominates. Not overly sticky on the lips or tongue, which I usually experience big boy IPA's. Dare I say, I think that's what's missing here? Hey, I'm nitpicking.
O: Fantastic DIPA. I could easily drink 2 or 3 of these in a sitting, but would probably pay for it shortly thereafter...But it's that good, and that smooth. Another west coast beaut! 1,469 charactersJeffoC6, Feb 05, 2014

A - Pours crystal clear, a bit light on head/bubbles and only thin lacing but still looks nice
S - Oooh it hits the nose before you even pick it up and get close to it. I get a mostly piney and slightly floral aroma, very appealing. As with most IPA's I am having trouble detecting the subtleties after my nose adjusts to the smell and it fades a little. 
T - Such perfect balance between the hops and malt, and the freshness really comes through. They REALLY nailed it. Sweet taste initially, enjoyable bitter finish. The piney hops come through in the flavor. Tastes closer to a Lagunitas IPA than a SNPA or Torpedo IPA. Can't even believe this is a 9-10% ABV beer as it's so easy drinking and balanced. Quickly vaults itself into one of the top flavor beers i've encountered.
M - Smooth/slightly oily with a tingling of the tongue carbonation/hop presence. Dry finish leaves you begging for more. 
O - Really really really liked it. The average score might be dinged by the appearance but do you really care about that if it smells/tastes delicious? Easily one of my new favorite beers. Just a shame it isn't a common 12 pack :-) 1,179 charactersYoda22, Feb 04, 2014

Enjoy by 2.14.14
Appearance: Perfectly clear golden color. Two finger, slightly off-white head. Great lacing. Nice looking beer. 
Smell: Very fresh on the nose, as I'd expect. The two dominant aromas I pull are pine and grapefruit. A sort of malty sweetness as well. Not exactly blowing my mind with a huge depth of interesting smells, but what's there is very nice.
Taste/feel: Quite nice. Like the smell in a lot of ways. A good bit of sweetness through most of the sip with a slight burn and bitterness on the finish. The flavor on the front is resinous, piney hops, with grapefruit and other citrus flavors meddling in the middle of the mouth, with that bit of a burn/bitterness at the end. Aftertaste is a sort of lemon zest bitterness with a caramel sweetness. I like it, but not it's not blowing my socks off. Medium body. Medium carbonation, maybe a little high. Very drinkable. As the brew warms slightly, a sort of Summit hop flavor comes through (for those who don't know, a bit of an oniony flavor). It actually becomes pretty significant and it makes the brew a bit more interesting and causes it to stand out a little bit more than it otherwise would have. As it warms up even more, tropical fruit peeks through, as does the alcohol. Tastes almost like a completely different beer from when it was straight out of the fridge.
Enjoy By's a brew I've been wanting to get my hands on since I first heard about it. I missed out on the last batch that came to Michigan, but not this one. Grapefruit and pine dominate when it's first out of the fridge, but then Summit hops (or ones similar) add a third dimension. This is a tasty one to crack open and spend an afternoon or evening with that also comes at a reasonable price. It's a beer I'd recommend you seek out, but in a way, I'm ALMOST disappointed? I decided to give it a 4.5 overall just because I love how the flavors change so much throughout the 22oz of beer.
TL;DR: Enjoy By should be tried by ANYBODY who likes or loves IPAs, simple as that. 2,089 charactersSerialTicker, Feb 03, 2014

Pours a nice medium amber, decent to moderate head.
Aromas are very nice, sweetness, hoppiness, little malt notes.
Taste is really, really nice. A lot of tropical fruit, pineapple, very little bitterness.
My favorite Stone beer by far.
A very nice IPA not trying to be a bitter bomb from Stone. Good work. 346 charactersBoldRulerVT, Feb 03, 2014

Appearance: transparent amber/orange color with 1 finger white head that dissapates slowly leaving moderate lacing
Smell: one of the best aspects of this beer. Dank, fresh hop aroma. Citrus and pine combine almost perfectly to create a great nose
Taste: largely matches the nose. One of the freshest tasting IPA/DIPA's I've had (accomplishes the goal exceptionally well). Taste is probably the closest thing to fresh hops I've ever tasted
Mouthfeel: medium body, medium to light carbonation, very easy drinking for the ABV
Overall: certainly one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. The freshness of it definitely contributed to that, so props to Stone for putting an emphasis on it. The smell and taste are pure hop joy 758 charactersZdrummer15, Feb 01, 2014

Enjoy by 2.14.14
Appearance - Golden to burnt orange. Transparent with a about a finger head that settles nicely leaving a ring around the glass. 
Smell - Pungent tropical fruits. Burnt pineapple, mango. Some spicy pine aroma is present as well. Not a lot of alcohol on the nose. 
Taste - Dank sticky mango, grilled pineapple, grapefruit to start. Piny bitterness and spiciness like garlic towards the middle. Mild woodiness, and alcohol to finish. 
Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation, medium-full bodied, refreshing and crisp 
Overall - Good beer. Punch in the nose and to the palate. It's a nice blend of citrus and slight spiciness that will surely leave you wanting next times batch. Got to try Enjoy by 11.12.13 as we'll (sad I didn't review) but I will be looking for this again next time. 822 charactersFlopjack, Feb 01, 2014

Pours a translucent, golden-orange with a loose, quarter-inch, off-white cap that dissipates into a froth and then an oily slick that coalesces into a thin band around the shoulders. Some spots of lacing and a random swath present during the tasting. Great nose - tropical fruit, citrus rind, grapefruit, spiciness and an herbal/piney character. Taste is less fruity than suggested by the nose. Much more of a malty backbone as well as a spicy character and rind towards the finish. An oniony character is also revealed as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a bright, prickly carbonation and a light acidity that stimulates that tongue and salivary glands. Overall, quite interesting, but I have to say that I wish the flavor profile was a closer match for the nose - a bit too much malt and spice and not enough tropical fruit for my sensibilities. 928 charactersJwale73, Feb 01, 2014

Enjoyed on 30-January-2014
Pours a clear copper with a finger of white head that retained well. The nose has good hoppiness and a touch of citrus. There was a blast of hop bitterness upfront followed by an interesting blend of malt and hops. This baby is plenty bitter. The finish has a touch of alcohol bite that does not go well with the remainder of the tasting experience. The mouthfeel is a touch thinner than top shelf DIPAs.
This offering is quite good, but I am not convinced that it lives up to the hype. I am certainly interested enough to try another batch if I can get my hands on one. I drank this bottle at cellar temperature; I think that next time I will briefly chill it before enjoying it.

This second sampling proved to have a stronger citrus flavor which was accompanied by a notable spiciness. Also, the alcohol was much better in check this time. All around - a tastier iteration than the first.

My third iteration of this classic was not as bitter as the first two (by my best recollection).  Also, the citrus notes were reduced while the earthy notes accentuated this time around.

It's been about a year and a half since I sampled this gem. The bottle for this iteration states that it is "devastatingly dank" (of course). I got some dankness but this is by no means the dankest DIPA that I have ever enjoyed. However, it remains superb as an all-around offering.

Appearance: Clear and light, with little evidence of crystal/caramel malt coloring. Poured a 1 finger head of fine white bubbles into an 8 ounce sample glass, which subsided to a ring after a few minutes. Noted, but not remarkable lacing. Persistent champagne-like carbonation.
Smell: Remarkably fresh hop aroma with a strong dank cannabis presence, accompanied by notes of bright grapefruit and resin. Very close to the smell of whole cone hops from the bag.
Taste: A brief splash of malt sweetness at the front, enduring only a split-second before succumbing to white pepper and lemongrass washing over the mid-palate. Alcohol is noted, but incorporate into the flavors well. A dry resin finish joins the remaining pepper bite to bring the next sip fast. 
Mouthfeel: Adequate carbonation and alcohol bite to present the juicy hop character well. It seemed to linger noticeably more than most IPAs, but the substantial gravity is likely to blame. 
Overall: A very unique and fresh IPA! I can't remember having another quite like it, with the focus towards dank and peppery flavor. A pleasant change from the citrus forward fare of the day, but with enough grapefruit to remind you it's an American IPA. In my opinion, an outstanding beer. 1,316 charactersYeastiary, Jan 31, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25I found this beer by surprise at Joe's Inn in Richmond Virginia. I had been keeping an eye out for it for quite some time and it always eluded me, so this was quite a treat.
This beer came out in a shaker pint, with a crystal clear, amber-orange appearance and about two fingers of foamy white head.
It smelled like a classic west coast ipa, with a twist. It was grapefruit, pineaple and pear with a faint, simcoe-garlic background with some pine.
The taste followed suit, although the garlic was more pronounced and there was a surprisingly assertive sweet malt presence in the mid palate. The finish was pine and hop resin with pear.
The mouthfeel was thicker and more substantial than expected but finished dry.
Overall, this is a beautifully crafted beer that absolutely lives up to the hype. Crisp, clean and tropical with a quick bitter punch. Highly recommended. 874 charactersprecariouslydaniel, Jan 30, 2014

Had a fridge just stocked for a good night of decent beers. Between the Dogfish Head and the local IPA from shipyard (Black and Monkey Fist), This was a spectacular night of great beer. 02.14.14 from Stone was highlight and also the 2nd to last trip to local packy. She sent me for smokes one more time, damn. But came home with a nice lil 5 spot for the night. The Stone was the star but you cant beat 90 min. from Dogfish Head. It's epic and we all know it. The fact i had a Sixer of the the local Shipyard IPA was a bonus and that Black IPA is real damn good. Stone continues to deliver and to be fair I live out in nowhere ME so the fact I'm getting this beer is just plane awesome. Wow I got min of 84 to go and all I can think about is that damn meatloaf i just microwaved. I shall go now and chow. drink well my friends Ü 914 charactersSlipweasel, Jan 29, 2014

Lets get to it. This one pours a beautiful copper amber hue with a generous white head that gives way to a gentle and lasting Frothy film and decent lacing. The aroma of this is slightly disappointing. At first it seems perfect with a nice sweetness followed by a ton of citrus and floral hops. Alot of grapefruit and mangos, some pine and definitely some skunky grass aromas. As I smell deeper im finding notes of garlic and scallions. Not sure if it fits in this super fresh dipa profile. The flavor is delicious...at first. Super fresh and hoppy, bitter and sweet. Very balanced. A lot of citrus, pine, grass, and some nice malt and yeasty bread notes. But in the aftertaste is still those damn garlic and scallion notes. Its not bad by any means just seems to negatively affect the freshness that this ipa is known for. The body on this beer is wonderful. Medium and a little sticky. Coats the mouth with hoppy goodness for a long while. This is a great beer and I cant wait to try the next date in the series, however I do not believe it is anywhere near Stones finest offerings. But for an allocated beer how can one go wrong at just $7.99 a bomber. 1,304 characterslochef81, Jan 28, 2014

 the color is deep amber with dark golden hues and hazed with thick white cap. The smell is fruity, tropical, juicy and light citrus odors all encompass with mild papaya aroma. The feel is great with tangy bitter and light sweet element from the malt with mild astringency and slight warming of alcohol.
 The taste is very hop drenched, lots of tangy citrus and zesty mango with some grapefruit and tropical flavors from the blend with slight catty tinge hinting there is some simcoe near the finish. Overall this is as good as expected based on the track record -lots of hop flavor which is helped by the freshness which shows..almost chalky from the raw vegetal matter jammed in- this is a quality Imperial IPA, one of the best I have had in recent memory. 901 charactersSlatetank, Jan 28, 2014

3.7/5  rDev -15.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I picked up a bottle of Stone's Enjoy By IPA a couple days ago for $7.99 at The Lager Mill. I've never had any beers from the Enjoy By series and this is the first one that I've seen on the shelfs, so I thought I should give it a try, lets see how it goes. Best by 2/14/14. Poured from a brown 22oz bottle into a snifter.
A- The label look nice, it's simple and straight to the point, I think it's a little eye catching with the best by date being the main feature on the label. It poured a fairly hazy golden color that was slightly orange and it took on more of a darker gold and orange color when held to the light with two and a half fingers worth of creamy off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice sticky rings of lacing behind. This was a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.
S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness followed by the hops being the first to show up with a little bit of piney hops coming through with the citrus and fruity hop aromas seeming to stick out the most imparting a real nice citrus and tropical fruit aromas with some nice peach aromas showing up. Up next comes a medium amount of onion and garlic hops that make for and interesting combination when mixed with the fruity hops. Towards the end I get a real light bready and grainy aroma. The aroma was ok, but I wish the onion and garlic like hops didn't show up as much as they did.
T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness that bordered on being highly sweet and it's followed by the hops being the first to show up but this time it's a mixture of the fruity hops and the onion and garlicy hops sticking out which makes for an unusual flavor. There's a real light amount of malts that impart a slight grainy flavor. On the finish there;s a lower amount of high bitterness that doesn't really linger that long and there's a hoppy aftertaste with the onion and garlic like hops coming through. This was an ok tasting beer, but I thought it had the same problem as the aroma with the onion and garlic hops sticking out too much.
M- Fairly smooth, a little crisp, on the slightly thicker side of being medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was pretty good and it worked well with this beer.
Overall I thought this beer was just ok and I I didn't think it was the best example of a DIPA, it was going the right direction with some nice fruity hops, but then the onion and garlic comes through and it really muddles the flavors and it leaves me a little confused. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little crisp and not too filling, but the taste didn't do the best job at holding my attention and half the bottle was enough for me, I don't really feel like drinking another glass mainly because of that onion and garlic flavor. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both pretty good and they worked well with this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was the onion and garlic hop aspect, it really held this beer back from being as good as it could be. I wouldn't get any more of this particular beer, but I wouldn't rule out trying the next one that makes it's way to Michigan. I wouldn't recommend this beer unless you love onion and garlic like hops. All in all I was fairly disappointed with this beer, I had heard that this was a pretty good DIPA and that it was more than marketing hype, but it didn't live up to my expectations mainly because it highlighted my least favorite hop profile. There are many other DIPA's that I would much rather have. Better luck next time guys, this beer just wasn't for me.
Edit 2015, over a year later I got to try Enjoy by 4/20/15, this is much better than the first Enjoy by I had, while it still has some green onion aspects to it, the fruity hops stick out the most and I enjoy it.  I bumped up the score to reflect this batch, while still keeping other batch in mind. 4,061 charactersStoutHunter, Jan 28, 2014

A - beautiful light copper orange with thin light cream head that drops fairly soon
S - Some fruity hop smell, but a somewhat disconcerting and dominant oniony/garlicky aroma. I was not expecting that.
T - The onion/garlic aroma translates somewhat into the taste and did not do it for me. This fades somewhat as the beer warms
M - excellent body and mouthfeel
O - The dominance of the onion/garlic hop aroma and flavor are not what I appreciate in a good beer. This was very disappointing for me as I've heard so many positive reviews for this beer. 652 charactersFFreak, Jan 27, 2014

Poured a rich light amber color with a creamy thick head of 3/4 inch. Significant lacing. Smell is making my mouth water. Taste - wow! Nice IPA, one of THE BEST I've ever had - Pure hoppy beautifulness! A truly great beer - enjoyed every last drop and want more! 289 charactersWortman1998, Jan 27, 2014
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Wow this is quite a beer. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of citrus fruits, mango, guava, and starfruit. All of the juiciest fruit seems to make an appearance but has none of the tarter and more noticeable citrus flavors are found here. The taste is much in the same vein as the nose but there is a very mild undercurrent of piney and resin flavors underneath. The mouthfeel is almost the best part of this beer. So smooth yet with just a touch of carbonation, on such a robust DIPA it really makes drinking easy and before you know it your bomber is gone!
Stone did this one really right. Awesome DIPA. 604 charactersTheFizzinator, Jan 27, 2014

T - Follows the smell...hops from beginning to end, with a surprisingly smooth finish. Slight malty aftertaste. Sticky and fresh.

Should have named it "Enjoy by the bottle"
A-Nice coppery color that you get from an IPA. Head boils down into nothing leavening just thick, resinous, sappy lacing on the sides of the glass. Enjoyed this portion from a snifter. 
S-Decadent mimosa up front dominated by huge notes of champagne and orange rind mixed with fresh cut wildflowers and briar/thicket.
T-Aromas translate well into taste leaving just the slightest tingle of hops from this huge IPA. Booze, at ~10%, is very well concealed and could very well make it through the tightest of airport securities. It leaves one of the most satisfying residual flavors I've ever experience in a beer. Just a faint, almost sugary hop not at the end that is both thirst quenching and begging for more. 
M-Very balanced. Not thick at all like you might be accustomed to with DIPAs. Lightly carbonated. Very easy drinking. 
O-Beer was very fun and definitely looking forward to what comes next in the series. 1,109 characterskylelenk, Jan 27, 2014

A - Pours a deep copper orange with a huge stack of foamy, bubbly, pancake batter egg shell colored head that reduces to a thin cap during the entire drink. Wonderful spots of lace surround the snifter.
S - HUGE bouquet of flowers, citrus zest, grapefruit, orange rind, resinous, fruity, hop oils. Damn this is fresh and one of the best smelling beers I've ever experienced.
T - Follows the nose - citrus hop bomb, grapefruit, citrus zest, nicely balanced with sweet malts. Moutfeel tingles tingles and numbs the palate. One of the easiest drinking 9+ percent beers I've had. Dangerous.
O - I purchased two bottles from Copper Vine and shared the first with a couple of buddies. I'm now drinking the second and savoring every sip and I'm going to go back to get as much as I can tomorrow. This is one of the best beers I've had and it has it all for what you want and expect in a DIPA. 951 charactersandrewjraab, Jan 27, 2014

A - Pours and absolutely clear orangish ruby with a one finger head. Dissipates to a thin lace, which hangs on the slide on the glass throughout.
S- Even with a cold (I am hoping this is the cure), a good waft of strong grapefruit, with some pine and sea salt. 
T - Bitter hops at the forefront and through the finish. Grapefruit (though much milder than in the nose), sea salt, pine, and some crushed pepper. 
M - Pretty spot on for an IPA. Crisp, but not overly so. 
O - Stone has been one of my favorite brewers for quite some time. Good to see a brewer willing to put an expiration date right in the name rather a cryptic bottle code. Having it available in a growler was a bonus. 769 charactersApellonious, Jan 26, 2014

Appearance- Beautiful sunset orange with lots of bubbles streaming up to the top with about a half finger of egg white head that disappeared quickly. Awesome.
Smell- Wow. This is amazing. Smells like I'm sticking my nose in a bag of tropical fruits and hops. What I get is hops, mango, peach, grapefruit, slight bread malty notes. Just epic smells. 
Taste. Holy crap this is so much more fruit-forward than the October 2013 version. Follows the nose precisely. Tastes like hopped up fruit juice. Just an amazing, and probably my favorite IPA currently. 
Mouthfeel- Super carbinated and drinks dangerously well for a 9.4 % beer. 
Overall- This is easily Stone's best beer. And that's saying a lot. Amazing. 806 characterswinningwes91, Jan 26, 2014

Much sweeter then I was expecting! Not really any malt balance on this brew, very hop forward, but what else what you expect from a Stone IPA? I've been drinking lots of brown ales and stouts lately and this was my first IPA back from my malty phase, I enjoyed this brew but its almost a little TOO sweet for me personally. Hop heads should love this one. 615 characterstheteleman, Jan 25, 2014

A - A fairly active pour yields two fingers worth of slightly late to develop crisp ultra light khaki colored head comprised of medium and large sized chunky bubbles... Excellent retention... The head turns a much creamier as it settles ultimately leaving a full velvety veil of lacing and moderately thick collar... Surprisingly still with just a stray carbonation bubble hear and there... The color is equal pats pale copper and vibrant amber... Gobs of sticky lacing cling to the sides of the glass... 
S - A big hop forward nose that doesn't disappoint... Bursting at the seams wit topical fruit and citrus... Mango... Pineapple... Oranges... Grapefruit... Honeydew... A bit beneath the surface lies an additional layer of slightly dank resiny piney hops... Little to no malt backbone in terms of aroma... Loaded with an array of depth and complexity that truly showcases artistry in hops... 
T - Starts fairly restrained and subtle... A mix of earth hops are at the forefront... Again no malt to balance out the palate... The hops really begin to intensify on the finish and take on a resiny piney character... Much of the fruity nature alluded to by the nose are absent...
M - On the lighter side of medium bodied... Slightly astringent... Clean and fairly crisp... The bitterness turns slightly blistering on the finish... 
D - A truly excellent beer, but one that is a bit over hyped in the opinion... I personally would opt for a Ruinten any day of the week... With that slight disclosure out of the way, this is still a craft beer and especially a hop heads dream... The aroma is the star of the show... Overall, it seems to be a bit less than the sum of its parts... 1,736 charactersphilbe311, Jan 25, 2014

3.99/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.75Pours a two finger head into my DFH IPA glass. The head has a strong resemblance of clean sea foam, if there ever was such a thing. Pretty deep amber, almost glows.
Scent of grass, followed by a little pine. Lemongrass, grapefruit and a bit dank. Hardly any booze smell, just a little sweet. The smell is so exciting that I took a sip before I intended to... The high aroma rating more so for the excitement it provided than it being spot on for the aromas I like in the style...If that makes any sense?
A tad sweetness at first, a little earthiness and grassiness. Pine and grapefruit are present here, but much more subdued. Overall just very...meaty. Makes me crave a steak.
Finishes pretty dry and bitter. Strong excitement long after each sip due to the carbonation.
Despite this being bottled two weeks ago, it seems to just be missing some freshness. The flavor profile isn't what I prefer with the style, but it kind of works. But, it's still pretty drinkable. I will have no problem polishing off the bomber myself. 1,028 charactersMrBoh, Jan 25, 2014

A: Golden orange. Big head that follows the beer with rings that hold onto the side of the glass.
S: Ripe guava. If you haven't smelled ripe guava from Mexico, this is what it smells like. Amazing! FYI, ripe guava has a little funk to it.
T: Initial taste is citrus fruit accompanied by a sour-hop taste that matches the smell. The more I drink this, the more it tastes like guava. I sense a bit of malt and alcohol on the exhale, but just the right amounts.

Appearance: Poured from bomber into a Duvel tulip. Pours a brilliantly clear, rich golden orange color with a sudsy, two-finger head.
Aroma: Really nice hop aroma, as expected. Big floral hop notes, some earthy, herbal notes, some ripe tropical fruits.
Taste: Follows nose, big hop bitterness up front, transitions into just enough malt presence to be noticeable, but only for a moment as hops return. Herbal, slightly savory, almost vegetal hop character that was present in nose is more present and articulated in the taste. Slight alcoholic warmth?
Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full bodied, slightly viscous. Smooth, light carbonation.
Overall: Excellent. Yep. Really good. Glad to be able to try it. 717 charactersjhawth, Jan 24, 2014

O: I must say, this being my first Enjoy By experience, I was a bit disappointed. I had only heard good things from friends and BAs, but it's not quite as marvelous as I had expected. Perhaps it's because I'm inevitably comparing it to Abner or Heady, but it strikes me as a slightly better, more alcoholic version of Long Trail Limbo that cost me $7 a bomber rather than $10 a sixes. Anyway, I'm glad I tried it, I enjoyed it, and I will probably get another one at some point. Try it for yourself, because fresh IPA is hard to come by. 809 charactersBTVflatlander, Jan 24, 2014

Lots of warmth and bigness and chewiness to this beer, nothing watery going on.  A full bodied DIPA if I've had one.  A nice standard DIPA, but a tad pricy.

Pours a deep gold color with a thick white head.  A really good-looking beer.  Good retention and lacing.  Really citrusy, moderately bitter but not in-your-face about it.  Medium body, nice level of carbonation. Alcohol is well-hidden.  
I first had Enjoy By at Poe's Tavern on Sullivan Island SC, and it was an almost religious experience.  Enjoy By is good from the bottle, but I think draft is superior.
Enjoy by 12.25.15 update:  On tap at the Holy Hound in York, PA.  Tulip glass.  Nice clear orange-gold with a modest white head.  Initial impression is a lot of citrus, tropical fruit, and pine.  Very fresh and very good.  
I think Stone must vary the Enjoy By recipe - each release is a little different.  This was one of the better ones. 842 charactersdbl_delta, Jan 23, 2014

The excellent appearance gives way to a strong sweet apricot hoppy nose that is simply delicious. On the tongue is it presents a strong hoppy bite. Behind that lies a fruity citrus that gives way to a wonderfully balanced lingering hop. In the mouth this beer is smooth, refreshing, clean and crisp. Quite simply this is a fantastic IPA. Certainly worth a night for the IPA lover. I don't advise is for a new drinker or non IPA person. 582 characterslsiberian, Jan 23, 2014

Poured a very clear darker amber. Medium sized head of dense bubbles. No real lace to speak of. 
Very complex smell. Lots of apricot, canned peaches, and tropical fruit notes. Some piney hop resin as well.
Taste had less dimension than the smell, though was excellent. Heavy on the citrus rinds, particularly grapefruit and lemon. Some tropical fruits, with a bitter pine finish. Fairly well balanced with a good malt backbone. 
Mouthfeel was crisp. Resiny bitter oils clung to my tongue. 
Overall an excellent DIPA. 539 charactersIeatlambfries, Jan 22, 2014

The sheer ecstasy of this brew's first greeting to my taste buds seared itself into my mind and to this day has yet to let go. An incredibly balanced blend of citrus (orange, tangerine), warm bread, spices and hops... every flavor in perfect proportion, bold and up front and yet somehow sharing the stage equally with all the other elements going on - absolutely divine! If you ever see this, buy as much as you can and share it with good friends quickly. 646 charactersJames773, Jan 22, 2014

Appearance: Pours a clear golden orange color. Nice head retention and lacing. Nothing extraordinary to look at. 
Nose: A total blast of piney hops. Wet, first pine. some tiny alcohol and medicinal notes in the middle, with some mustard and malt at the end.
Taste: Great mouthfeel, and a perfectly balanced malt foundation. This is what a big IPA should feel like. Tastes like pine, citrus, ginger, sweet toffee, and a tiny bit of aspirin at the end. 
Notes: Beer is always best fresh, and I commend the effort behind getting this beer to market. I don't care if others feel it is a marketing gimmick, it brings super fresh beer to my liquor store and I will not complain about that.

4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Wow, I was surprised by this "Enjoy by 02/14/14 IPA" the look was typical of an IPA, a solid golden yellow/brown color with a good head. The smell was amazing; it might be the best part of the beer, an insane combo of floraly hops with a soft piney caramel to it. The mouth feel, sort of gummy, chewy, beer with a smooth finish. These taste is the only part that levels off the beer. A very solid pine cone cinnamon flowery finish that is classical of a solid IPA. Overall a great IPA. I'd have another. 503 charactersTairy1Greene, Jan 21, 2014

A - Beautiful beer. It's a nice amber color with about a 2 finger head, very good retention, and pretty active carbonation. This is crystal clear. 
S - Strong smelling but very pleasant. I'm getting grapefruit and pine with a touch of dankness and a little touch of malt in the background.
T - I'd say piney hops is the prevailing flavor. The citrus is pretty muted. Very little malt presence but quite bitter.
M - The worst part of this beer. The bitterness lingers on the tongue a little too much for my taste. Very dry finish. 
O - Overall, I am very pleased to have gotten to try it. It's one of the nicest DIPAs I've seen and the smell is really nice. I wish they could tone the bitter aftertaste a touch but other than that, it's a rock solid DIPA. 796 charactersPSU_Mike, Jan 21, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a dogfish head IPA glass. Bottled 1/9/14 (enjoy by 2/14/14 edition).
Appearance is transparent amber, with lots of bubbles rising quickly, and a thick nearly-white head that leaves tons of sticky lace.
Smell is crazy. Mind-blowing citrus, weed, onions, resin. So many hop aromas it's staggering.
Taste is much the same - lots of candied orange, freshly-mowed onion grass (if that makes sense), flowers, and weed popping around in your mouth with equal intensity. Finish is tongue-sappingly bitter (in a good way). Aftertaste is dank, earthy, and resiny. There are so many hop flavors going on in here that I just can't even believe it. Also, after a while it gives you the most glorious hop-burps!
Mouthfeel is relatively thin, with lots of prickly bubbles - absolutely perfect for the flavor!
Overall, this is just an incredible beer. Probably my favorite-ever IPA. So happy it made it to Georgia again, and I already can't wait until next time it comes here! 977 charactersMasterfulIdiot, Jan 21, 2014

Pine, grass, citrus, lemon, very small hints of alcohol. Taste is similar to how it smells. Opens with the piney/grassy taste, citrus fruit hits and finishes with a slight pear flavor. Very minimal alcohol flavor here. Very well hidden. This is my favorite beer and is my #1 recommended. Find it. It's worth it 415 charactersbryangb, Jan 20, 2014

Poured from a 22.oz bottle into Portsmouth tulip glass.
The color is a deep darker orange with a finger of white head with some nice lacing left on the glass. There a cloudy look to this beer that blocks the light out a bit does have a slight yellowish hue in the margins.
The smell is very piney hops flavored bringing a spruce aroma. There is a saturated clementine aroma that brings a bright citrus aroma that is hard brings visions of pulp to mind.
The taste of this beer is citrus at first but as it goes toward the back of the younger it pastes a layer of pine flavor hops that have slight sting as the go down. A slight scrape of the tongue by the bitterness of the hops is felt but feels like a battle scar since there is also tinge of pleasure there as well. At the corners of the mouth there is a nice slight tangerine flavor that resides there for a short time.
The feel of this beer a has a nice fullness that feels like it surrounds the pallet but does not engulf the entire mouth. This feels like a big IPA but does not hit hard either but slips into a push into hops here, there, and everywhere. 1,133 charactersDuhast500, Jan 20, 2014
4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This is the 02.14.14 version of this beer, and it was bottled about a week and a half ago.
A: A really nice light orange/copper color, when held to brighter lighting it seems almost golden, which is very unique for a DIPA. It's completely clear, and when poured it has a minimal amount of cream colored foam.
S: Hoppy, obviously. What stands out to me most is the juicy grapefruit notes with a decent amount of pine and earthy smells as well. 
T: Once again, hops are the main attraction. A complex layering of pure hop bitterness with herbal, piney, grassy, juicy, and spicy notes. Stone beers tend to have a very typical aggressive hop character, but this one changes it up a bit and I really enjoy that. Usually DIPAs are relatively heavy on the malt flavor, but I really like that the malty sweetness is pushed to the background in this beer.
M: Light bodied for a beer of this style, but I think that makes it unique and enjoyable. Medium level of carbonation makes allows for this potentially aggressive brew to be surprisingly drinkable. 
O: A great hop experience, and a beer that I would highly recommend. If you like DIPAs for their heavy malt character, this beer may not be for you but if you like hoppy beers then look no further. Believe the hype. 1,276 charactersErbayd, Jan 20, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Glass Used: Tulip
Appearance: This offering has a crystal clear golden tangerine body with a thick two finger snow white tightly packed foam. The lace on this DIPA goes on for days leaving an eighth of an inch foam cap on the surface. This is a beautiful beer.
Smell: Floral hops is abundant in the nose with only a bit of tropical scents for me. Malt is there in force. 
Taste: Hops are there again in the forefront, middle and finish. The malt lets you know its there but the juicy & bitter hops pushes its way through and shines. The lingering of the light resinous, citrus hops is really welcomed and quite enjoyable.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is medium with medium cling coating the mouth. 
Overall: This is my first IPA from Stone and am quite impressed. It's not the tropical citrus bomb that I like in a DIPA, but it's damn tasty hoppy brew that I will be more than happy to pick up any time I see one. Definitely recommend. 944 charactersdarthvohn, Jan 20, 2014

Nose is plenty hoppy, citric and tropical with some alcohol and biscuit malt bordering on toffee. Smells good...
Taste is hops, both leafy and fresh and bittering aftertaste. Juicy without being overly resinous and tastes like wet hops to me. The malt is light and pretty much gets the fuck out of the way and the alcohol is very well integrated. This is an outstanding beer...not going to compete with the best of DIPAs...but right there at the top of the second tier. 668 characterstwiggamortis420, Jan 20, 2014

Poured into a Sammy Smith pint. Thin uneven head, dissipated promptly. No lacing. Slightly brassy redish-golden color.
Aroma is intense piney resiny hops.
Taste is amazing. Citrus and pineapple with an oaken quality as if barrel aged. Surprisingly not as bitter as expected from other Stone Brewing Co. experiences. Mildly persistent hops presence. Floral quality muted, which is also a surprise since a) the beer is so fresh and b) this is a Stone product which typically have an in-your-face hops presence in my experience. No alcohol notes. This is one of the most complex hops experiences I ever had.
I will go buy more of this tomorrow while it's still available. 750 charactersTinfang, Jan 19, 2014

M - 4.25 - light-medium, aftertaste is very grapefruit/pine from the hops, very pungent. Alc is completely covered. 
O - 4 - It's great, but not the best. It's been a while since I've had Pliny but I think this may be similar. A little bit more earthy/spicy/garlic notes than most of the other double IPAs, but it's still good. 1,215 charactersISmith87, Jan 19, 2014

A - Very clear golden orange with a 1.0-finger white head that fades to a 1/2-finger and leaves a good amount of lacing. 
S - Mildly dank, pineapple, pine, hop floral. Pleasant. About the same aroma strength as the 10.25.13 release,
T - Hop forward, dank, ripe pineapple and stone fruit, some orange, white pepper, onion/garlic (more that I care for), moderating fruit-malt sweetness. Alcohol is present in the background and nicely complimentary. Finish includes spicy and bitter hop flavors with moderating malt and alcohol sweetness. .
M - Medium body and light-medium combination. Luscious, firm, viscous, resinous, prickly, clings.
O - Best one yet. Glad this particular one made it to Pennsylvania.
2013-10-21 in Columbia, PA. This is the 10.25.13 release. 
A - Mostly clear golden orange with a 1.5-finger white head that fades quickly to a 1/2-finger and leaves a mild amount of lacing. 
S - Pretty dank, pineapple, peach, hop floral. Less aroma strength than the 7.04.13 release but still very pleasant.
T - Rich pineapple and stone fruit, some orange, nice dank and spicy/peppery hop presence, onion/garlic (about like Deviant Dale's), moderating pale malt sweetness. Less pine than the 7.04.13 release but still evident. Alcohol is present in the background and nicely complimentary. Finish is a fine balance of tangy/spicy hop flavors and bitterness with moderating sweetness. Good balance.
M - Medium body and light-medium combination. Luscious, firm, viscous, resinous, prickly, clings.
O - I really enjoy this series and observing the similarities and differences from one to the next. This is a good one, for sure!
Had this on 2013-07-01 in Columbia, PA. This is the 07.04.13 release. Special thanks to Matador677.
A - Mostly clear golden orange with a 1-finger white head that fades quickly to a skim and leaves a small amount of lacing. Not surprising for the high ABV.
S - Moderately dank, naval orange, peach, hop floral, honeysuckle. Very inviting.
T - Smooth. Ripe stone fruit, plenty of luscious orange flesh, grapefruit zest, then a mild flavor of lightly toasted bread, pepper, and alcohol sweetness. Finish is a great balance of complex fruit sweetness, pine and a commanding but not overpowering bitterness. Very little bready-malt in view. 
M - Medium body and light-medium combination. Luscious, firm, viscous, resinous, prickly, clings.
O - A really top-notch DIPA. So inviting sip-after-sip. Please sir, may I have another? 2,677 charactersTucquan, Jan 18, 2014

Great appearance and nice fluffy bit of head. Flavors are citrus, pine and ripe tropical fruit. Bitterness dominates the party in the best way. Mouth is just the slightest bit thin for a double ipa, but it wont detract from the overall experience. Alcohol is there for sure but not at all in the way.

A white finger appears atop and fades back leaving patchy lace on the glass. A swirl revives a finger effortlessly.
The aroma is quite juicy with hops. Very tropical smelling with herbs and pine to give depth. A little catty, dank and floral character is also thrown in there. Really a lovely bouquet of hop aromatics that doesnt really leave any room for other attributes like malt or even alcohol.
The taste is all hops. The flavor runs the entire hop gauntlet from tropical fruits and grapefruit to pine resin, dank herbs and even catty quality before getting rindy and pithy. This is so hoppy that is has a dusty hop flavoring that is slightly vegetative towards the finish but in a good way.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Despite displaying a ridiculous amount of hop flavor, it is not overly bitter. For being more than 9% abv, the alcohol is hidden really, really well. I would most certainly drink this again. 1,060 charactersstakem, Jan 16, 2014

The smell was catty and vanilla? Earthy and spicy. Pine and citrus. Later, as it warmed it became more pungent. 
The taste was tropical fruits and grapefruit pith bitterness. Well hidden alcohol. Mild sweet oranges. Really a perfect DIPA for me. The higher alcohol makes it less than easy to drink but it is oh so tasty.
The mouthfeel was actually thinner than I expected but there was adequate carbonation and it starts off rather creamy. I have gone through several of these and will pick it up anytime I see this one available. 724 charactersCresant, Jan 13, 2014

A-Alluring orange. Bright, glossy and yet deep in color like a liqueur. Great standard sized white head. Lacing meets the standard as well.
S-Floral. Like honeysuckle I guess. Still learning my floral scents. Mandarin. Tangerine. Grapefruit. Cream even. Honey malt. Spicy hops. I could nose my glass like a dog muzzle forever if need be.
T-Starts sweet. Then malty. Then the grapefruit and pine explode. Sweet onion. Radish. Juicy hops. Truly bitter-sweet. I don't think there is a set formula for how the beer starts, progresses and finishes. It's a constant transfer, switch of bitter and sweet. 
M-Good moderate body. Fluid enough, thick enough. Average carbonation. All the feels a DIPA should have are here. Nothing makes me sit and swish the beer though to find new feels. Solid. The slight sting of onion is interesting.
O-Overall a great beer that I look forward to trying each new edition. My first tasting is the 12.13.13. I want to try them all from the beginning but I don't know how realistic attaining all would be. And more important how fresh the tastings would be. Enjoy By will be enjoyed by most. It has a vegetable quality that works. Who knew I would like onion in my beer. 1,215 charactersshacawgo24, Jan 03, 2014

S- grapefruit, vague hints of tropical fruits, fruity hops, and a decent malt backbone.
T- grapefruit, papaya, malt. the finish has a "sticky" bitterness about it. It clings to the back of my tongue.
M- mildly prickly carbonation, medium bodied. A bit sticky.
O- at the end of the day, it's another great stone IPA. 435 characterssilverking, Dec 26, 2013

Enjoy By did NOT disappoint. Frankly, I could care less about smell or appearance, so let's move on to the other categories. Lots of quality IPA flavor--pineapple, citrus, pine, florals--a very complex and fragrant beer and goes down surprisingly smooth considering it carries such a high ABV. DIPAs are my go-to and Enjoy By is now in my top 5.
A difficult beer to find but well worth picking up when you can. 600 charactersIPA_Chris, Dec 24, 2013

Bright orange/gold colour with a sticky, dense, eggshell cap. Good head retention and lasting lacing. Crazy hop aroma. Tons of grapefruit and orange, juicy, slightly tropical, bright and fresh. Nicely balanced flavour too. Lots of bitterness, sweetness, citrus, and alcohol. Lingering bitterness, earthy and citrus, with mild alcohol spiciness and some higher alcohol character. Mild warmth, medium plus body with smooth carbonation, excellent texture. This was really good -- balanced, bold and fresh. 511 charactersDrJay, Dec 23, 2013

Look great a transparent pale amber with a bright white fluffy head.
The smell is full on grapefruit with a little malt sweetness. This smells awesome.
The taste is bitter, sweet malts, fruity citrus hops. Very tasty.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. The hops really coat the tongue.
Overall another great beer from Stone, if you enjoy grapefruit flavours in your ipa I'd definately recommend. I'll be looking out for future 'enjoy by's'. 492 charactersDave1999, Dec 21, 2013

A: Pure golden, pale, clear
S: When totally fresh, a few days after bottling, its the best aroma there is. So much heady pine, tropical fruit, citrus, marijuana, grass, nectar
T: Again, within a few days after release the taste is close to the smell. Its a bit less complex then I'd like. Hits you almost all up front and then dissipates.
M: Pretty good here. Its not as full bodied as I'd like but its good enough to deliver the juice.
O: When very fresh its equal to any of the other big IIPA's. Aroma is the best of all of them IMO. Taste and mouthfeel maybe not as good as others but its close. 646 charactersvitALEity, Dec 20, 2013
4.79/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I'm reviewing 12-13-13: Stone is the brand here in SD. Having said that, I'm typically a Green Flash guy. So it was with a little trepidation that I believed the hype on this beer. From the minute you pop the cap the hop fragrance takes hold of you. Smelled of weed and citrus, with a dash of pine. The first sip socks your jaw with hop pungency and light caramel tones. Then you notice the nice head and great color this brew displays. The alcohol is up there, being a DIPA, but doesn't overpower or take your buds off of the taste. Just enough kick on the back end. Very drinkable, and the mouthfeel is full, but not cottony. Overall one of my top 3 brews HANDS DOWN. Can't wait for 2-14-14...Get you some! 708 charactersprecisemike, Dec 20, 2013

A: Brilliant, clear golden color. Extremely "pretty" beer
A: Clear, golden orange. Thinnish white head with some lacing.
S: Boxwood w/sticky, lemony sweetness
S: Dank, sweet pineapple and papaya.
T: Hop-forward. Resinous lemon hits and then finishes dry while all flavors linger. Bit of spice hit or alcohol in the throat.
T: Surprisingly balanced overall. Lots of grapefruit, some honey tones.
M: Light for a 2xIPA. Again, stickyness lingers on the tongue and mouth.
M: Light-medium body, finishes pretty dry. Definitely leaves you wanting the next sip.
O: Good beer, very enjoyable. The freshness is evident. Winner.
O: Prefer this version to the 5/17/13 SEB. Refreshing even with the bitterness. 815 charactersDad_of_Rad, Dec 19, 2013

Awesome painted-label bottle (great for bottling homebrew) with green, easy to read label. Thanks to Julian at Craftshack for expediting this to me to drink before the enjoy by date. I'm sure it would
have been ruined had I not sampled it before the 12/13/13 deadline.
A-Yellowish, almost clear brew with a constant 1/8" beige head. Medium carbonation.
S- Fantastic hop bouquet. Floral, citrusy, tropical. Malt aroma is there in force too. Like I'm walking behind a combine in a Montana barley field, while Oregon hop growers wave 20 foot
 bines of freshly harvested hops in my face. Absolutely lucious.
T- Follows suit with the nose. Fruity, (peach, apricot,) citrus, (tangerine, and grapefruit) tropical fruits, (mango, pineapple) plus a bit of pine also. A tinge of alcohol heat, but well hidden for a 9% beer. And that malt backbone again, I love when a beer can carry that 
 crushed grain, freshly baked bread taste along with such a powerful hop presence.
M- Ever present bitterness, hop oil, resiny, with a wonderful body to highlight all of this together. On many double/imperial IPA's the alcohol snuffs out what would otherwise
be a great brew. Not this one. All flavors and bitterness linger quite awhile on the tongue.
O- I had high expectations for this one after the reviews I had read. It did not disappoint.
This rivals any west coast double IPA, at a great price. Hope this becomes a regular from
Stone. 1,491 charactersGambelli, Dec 14, 2013

Last night's tasting showed a lot of bright fruit, tangerine, odd citrus like calamansi or yuzu, really great stuff. Much more hop complexity and vibrant nose than my first experience with Enjoy By 04.02.13. I'll look for this again and hopefully rate higher if there's consistency with recent taste.

Enjoy By 12.13.13 IPA (9 days to spare)
Appearance – The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a billowy two finger just off-white colored head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a nice level of thick foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big and sweet with tons of tropical fruit aromas. Mango, papaya, and tangerine all make a strong sweet showing with some lighter hints of some pear and peach as well. Along with the sweeter fruit smells is a good level of hop aroma. A pine hop smell is the greatest, but other hop aromas of grapefruit and some grass are there as well, rounding out the overall hop aroma profile. With a hint of an alcohol smell mixed with the rest, the aroma is overall pleasantly fruity and hopped with a nice warming smell.
Taste – The taste begins with the sweeter tropical fruit flavors that were detected in the nose, as well as a moderately strong presence of hop. The tropical fruits are heaviest of a tangerine sweetness, but contain nice notes of mango, pineapple, and papaya as well. The hop that begins the taste, is of a more pine like flavor, with it starting out on the lighter side and getting stronger as the flavor advances to the middle. Beyond these two flavor types, there is also a nice doughy flavor mixed in there as well, which with the sweeter tropics, creates an unchanging base for the hop profiles to evolve upon. While the pine hop grows stronger more toward the middle of the taste, it is joined by other hop flavors of an earthy and grapefruity nature. The pine then starts to fade ever so slightly with the grapefruit getting stronger and a little bit of a caramel sweetness sneaking onto the tongue toward the end. At the very end the earthy flavors along with a woodsy flavor really ramp up in the taste, and with the nice sweet and doughy backdrop and other hop flavors, end up leaving a rather pleasantly fruity and hopped flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is a bit on the lower side. The thick body is fantastic for accentuating the hop tastes on top of the sweeter tropical fruits and doughy flavors, with the lower carbonation only enhancing the feel of the thick body even more.
Overall –This was a very enjoyable IPA. Rather balanced for a stone brew in my opinion and not quite what I was anticipating. It blended a sweeter and thicker base with a nice hop profile, making for one very enjoyable sipper. 2,586 charactersDarkmagus82, Dec 05, 2013

Appearance - Body is a crystal clear orange with tones of honey and and brass colors as well. Atop the body sits a moderate head the color of off-white, about two fingers thick. Dissipates over several minutes, leaving a film across the body with a rim of thicker bubbles around the edges of the glass. As I drink it down, there are noticeable rings of lace at each place where the liquid remained while I paused between drinks.
Smell - Pine, some faint grapefruit, and herbal notes, including green onions--the tips, aka chives--and grass. Mostly herbal/vegetal rather than fruity/floral. I also get some esters from the high level of booze, but they aren't overpowering.
Taste - Very much expected based on the smell. Here, the grapefruit is a bit more present up front, along with some lemon zest, which slowly evolves into a more complex flavor with the essence of green onion and fresh-cut grass. The esters are a little more aggressive here, but honestly blend into the overall flavor quite well. Surprisingly drinkable for a 9.4% beer.
Mouthfeel - Moderate carbonation and medium-to-light body, with some element of viscosity lending a slight chewiness to the beer. Dry finish.
Overall, a stellar beer. I've had several different batches (7.4.13, 9.13.13, 10.25.13 and now 12.13.13) and I must admit it's hard to resist the temptation to buy a new bottle from each release. A quality double IPA that certainly stands up to the marketing efforts that surround it. One of my favorites from Stone. 1,722 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 04, 2013

Ap. - Brilliant golden body. Continuous lacing from off white head. 
Ar. - Not a whole lot going on in aroma. Classic IPA. 
T. - Pineapple juice! Nice grassy hop, and a touch of clean malt. 
M. - Would like a touch more carbonation. Otherwise very nice and silky smooth. Slight bitterness backs it up. 
O. - I keep telling myself (and others) that I'm not a hop head. This is scary. I'm a big fan. 416 charactersKVNBGRY, Dec 03, 2013

Smell: Strong citrus hops notes of grapefruit, possibly a slight pineapple smell to it. Very pleasant.
Taste: First sip hits the palette with the taste of citrus...heavy grape fruit barely noticing the alcohol. Finishes smooth and clean on the tongue making me anticipate my next sip.
Mouthfeel: Hop oils sit on the tongue leaving a nice aftertaste that hides the alcohol. It really seemed more like a mid range ipa as far as alcohol and not on the level it contains. 
Overall: I'm a big fan of Stone and this is by far my favorite brew of theirs right next to the Imperial Russian Stout. Very pleased.
Serving type: Bottle to pint glass. 854 charactersTheBrouMaster, Dec 02, 2013

A- Pours a deep, clear orange in color. A medium sized, dense head forms and retains well. Lacing is also good. 
S- Very piney and resinous up front. Fairly fruity with a focus on the citrus side towards the back end of the scent.
T- Starts with a moderate burst of hops bitterness. Hop profile in the taste is much more pine forward, with very little floral or fruity presence. Slight bit of dull bitterness from the alcohol about halfway through the drink. Overall, this is fairly one dimensional on the flavor side, and that dimension is hops bitterness.
M- Somewhat thick and slick across the tongue. Highly carbonated and there is also some alcohol warming on the tongue. Hops bitterness isn't so intense as to affect the beer's drinkability, but the alcohol content might.
Overall, this is a good DIPA for an affordable price. Nothing to blow you away, but good hops, higher in the alcohol department, and at ~$6-8 a bottle, it's a relative bargain. 969 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 01, 2013

A: Nice deep gold with nice lacing and head retention. Clear and really clean looking. Sticky head that clings to the glass.
S: Wow this is pungent! Hop bomb on the nose! Getting lots of piney and earthy fresh hops. Pine, lemon, lime, earthy hops, floral note, and no real malt to speak of. Smell sticks to the nostrils. Like sticking your nose in a handful of hops. 
T: Taste a lot like it smells. Tons of hops come rushing in but not overpowering like a ruination. It's all fresh and quenching. getting pine, lemon/lime, back to pine, orange rind, slight white pepper, white peach, nectarine, and malts do make a brief appearance at the end to balance it out. Really tasty!
M: Super clean for what i would call a DIPA. It is smooth a clean on the tongue but the hops still make their presence felt with a nice resiny mouthfeel on the finish. To sum it up wet and clean. Almost no booze for a 9%.
O: Really well done. Nice and balanced considering the nose and i love how it has that quenching wet sort of feel too it. Makes this one super drinkable and sets it apart not only form stones other IPAs but most others i have had. I would put it up there with Pliny for sure. Stone does it again! 1,256 charactersBergBeer, Nov 28, 2013

Appearance: Really nice golden color with good carbonation and lacing, but little head retention. 
Smell: Huge notes of freshly cut grapefruit. Like fresh citrus right off the vine. 
Taste: Mimics the aroma quite a bit. Very citrusy/grapefruity. I was surprised by the slightly sweet malty finish, considering Stone's other IPAs. 
Mouthfeel: Excellent for an IPA. Light and refreshing but not thin. A little highly carbonated for my taste, but that does add to the refreshing quality considering this is a high abv beer. 
Overall: Amazing. I was shocked to see this in stock at my little liquor store in IL, and couldn't be happier I grabbed it. I'll be going back shortly to buy them out. A great, fresh IPA that's refreshing, citrusy and not ridiculously bitter. Try it if you have the chance! 818 charactersHammer35, Nov 28, 2013

Dank piney and citrusy hops are quite abundant, the hop resin sticks in the nose and slight caramel to note as well.
Pineapple, orange, mango, cantaloupe and an array of other tropical flavors explode over a muted caramel malt backbone.
Mouthfeel is thick and sticky with plenty of hop bite for any hop fiend to enjoy.
Overall, one of Stone's best and a favorite of mine. 458 characterslarryarms847, Nov 28, 2013

Pours a transparent golden sunset color with about a finger of white head that retains well. The smell is that of dank, oily, earthy hops, a bit of onion, lemon, grapefruit, and orange peel. The smell is amazingly fresh, so I would say Stone succeeded in what they set out to do. The taste follows the nose, delivering a resinous, mouth-coating blast of bitterness right up front along with grapefruit and orange notes. There is also a weird onion taste that detracts from the quality of the beer, but it's not overwhelming. The finish is dry and unapologetically bitter, leaving a tingling in the back of my throat. 655 charactersitsscience, Nov 27, 2013

Grapefruit dominates, along with pine. Not as tropical as you might expect from a SoCal IPA. A little bit of skunkiness. In the finish, that oily sensation from too much hops, medium finish. Bitterness lingers. It's a good beer, and fresh, but it's a bit too harsh for me. I might try this again though if I can get it under 2 weeks old. 403 charactersjibbyvonjibb, Nov 26, 2013

A: Pours a slightly chill-hazed bright orange/gold. Head is one finger and white. It doesn't last extremely long, but there are islands of thin, white head throughout. Good lacing.
S: Wow...the smell is truly amazing...one of the best IPAs I've ever smelled. EXTREMELY strong dank, grapefruit smell. Lots of blood orange and mango, too. There are even hints of marijuana present....truly a hop-heads dream smell. 
T: Taste is full on hop assault. Extremely dank, yet extremely fruity. Grapefruit, marijuana, mango, orange, pineapple, and a touch of mint on the end. Zero bitterness and only the absolute minimum amount of malt that lets the hops shine through. Really one of the best IPAs I've ever tasted. 
M: Medium body. Oily...slick. Not much carbonation. Perfect mouthfeel that allows the hop onslaught to stick around for what seems like forever. 
O: Easily one of the top 5 IPAs I've had (and I've had a lot of the "best" IPAs available.) Lots of depth, fairly easy to acquire, great price, and a perfect indicator of when to drink this amazing beer! 1,151 charactersTTAmod, Nov 24, 2013

Smell is massive grapefruit hops, some citrus, random hints of random fruits. Insane hop flavor right away! Heavy floral hops, then grapefruit, then citrus, then the massive bittering kicks in. Absolutely coats the mouth. The bitterness is a little higher than I usually like but the fresh hop character is astounding. Aside from the lingering bitterness, the finish is really crisp and dry on this - I just realized this is 9.4% abv and now I'm even more impressed. Way too easy to drink considering its strength. It's easy to love stronger ales but this one really deserves it. 765 charactersanarchia, Nov 23, 2013

Appearance: Clear golden color, good white head, minimal lacing
Smell: Very fruity and citrusy, very fragrant
Taste: Again, fruity, citrusy, lighter on malt than I would have expected. No indication of the abv. Complex, yet very drinkable
Mouthfeel: Medium body, good carbonation, exactly what I expect from Stone for this style
Overall: Excellent, and a little different than you typical Stone brew. Focuses on the aromatic side of hops, instead of cramming bitterness down your throat. Very enjoyable, and I think they are targeting Pliny the Elder with this one. Can't say which I would rather have, but they are both world class. 745 charactersMadCat, Nov 22, 2013

A- Fantastic light copper/golden look.
S- Piney, tropical, citrus, perfect smelling DIPA
T- Slight hop bitterness up front fading into citrus, tropical taste. A very refreshing DIPA
M- Light bodied, very clean, crisp feel. This is a 9.4% beer, but does not drink like it. Very smooth.
O- I get the enjoy by every time I see it. This is in my top 5 DIPA's ever and I like the fact it is very easy to get throughout the year. I put the enjoy by up there with Dogfish Head Burton Baton and Coast breweries Boyking. A phenomenal beer. 559 charactersKJK-1, Nov 20, 2013

4.07/5  rDev -7.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25I'll start but saying that this brew is a deal on wheels. Very affordable big batch brew that has most of the bells and whistles of a special release ipa 
Pours out a hazy war of orange and yellow - nice and clear enough to see right thru 
Aroma is hops at first followed by vegetal notes. A lil bit of old lemon and awesome onion 
Taste is much the same - hop sweetness at first very refreshing if your thirsty - bitterness comes from over hopping- malts are there just adding to the sweetness of this brew 
Not really a full bodied beer this goes down quick - I'm not sharing this bomber! Carbonation is pleasing as you quaff down big sips of this brew 
Overall I'm really into this brew - the hop bill is overkill but that's ok by me - this DIPA could hang with some of the big boys - but very rough around the edges and not really refined - 
Last note. A lot of these have tasted the same to me - with the exception of enjoy by they made after releasing they're session IPA - that one seemed very weak. So weak I was almost done looking for this beer. I'm glad I gave it another go around 1,098 charactersModernrickk, Nov 19, 2013

One of my new favorite series, a big, bold and fresh IPA. Citrus plays second fiddle to strong earthy Flavors. A well hidden 9.4% ABV makes this a must seek and buy~ 283 charactersClePaul, Nov 17, 2013

This is hands down by far the best beer I have had from Stone. An absolutely delicious double IPA! A beautiful golden brew that just glows in the light. Fantastic clarity and a nice white head. Showing a good amount of carbonation some pretty steady bubble streams. The aroma of this beer screams hops. Very resiny hoppy aroma kinda skunky but it's absolutely bloody brilliant. The taste goes right along with the nose. This is just a delicious hop bomb with tons and tons of hop presence but it's not excessively bitter. My kind of beer. This is delicious hop nectar.
Edit: This was so good I went out and bought another.. Second one wasn't cold when i bought it but at $6 a bottle it seemed like a steal. Tasted like soapy shit. Moral of the story this thing spoils quick way before the enjoy by date if its not cold. Plus, when this brew goes bad it goes really really fucking bad! Had the second one on 11-18-13 and it had already spoiled (12-13-13 IPA). 984 charactersCA_brewster, Nov 17, 2013

This is one of my favorite IPA's. This was a good one, but I'm still searching for that first time. This is still a great IPA. Meant to drink fresh, can't get any better. 
A - Clear and fresh looking with a nice 1 inch foamy head. Golden clear liquid.
S - Smell is amazing with fruits hops pine, citrus, tropical fruits. 
T - Taste is much the same with upfront fruits some Apricot and honey. The hoppiness onslaught comes after the initial taste. Outstanding Taste, very refreshing.
M - Light bodied imperial IPA at 9.4%. 596 charactersCeltics17, Nov 16, 2013

22 oz bottle poured into a Stone IPA specialty glass. 
A - A very nice golden clear pour with a nice 1 inch head.
S - So fresh. Smells so piney with a hit of tropical fruit. Absolutely love it.
T - Hits you with a very bitter taste which is followed by a very fruity flavor. Finishes a bit sweet, but the bitter taste lingers for a while. Fantastic.
M - Very smooth and crisp.
O - A fantastic Double IPA. Try all of Stone's "Enjoy By" IPAs if you can get your hands on it. BevMo (west coast) sells them for about $6.49/bottle. It's an absolute steal.

Pours a clear golden body with 100% clarity, a big frothy head of medium and large-sized bubbles, with great retention and lacing, a gorgeous pour.
Smell is very west-coast IPA, with heavy pine needle notes, grapefruit and citrus, floral, somewhat but not overly sweet and malty on the nose.
Taste is bitter right up front with a wave of pine needle hop flavor followed closely by juicy grapefruit and citrus notes, bitterness lingers throughout, sweetness on the back end is evident, not bready though, no alcohol burn to speak of, and bitter aftertaste on the follow-through. Great balance.
Mouthfeel is clean, crisp, moderately carbonated, smooth but not creamy, sticky and dry finish.
Overall, this is one of the best DIPAs out there and for the price point there are really few, if any, which are better options. Drink this as fresh as possible, the hop flavor is beautiful and balances the bitterness, which is necessary given the heavy malt backbone. This is Stone's best beer, for sure. 1,147 charactersMCain04, Nov 15, 2013

Appearance - A clear golden amber color. Strong pour yielded a 1/2 finger head that dissipated quickly. There was minimal lacing while drinking
Smell - Very hoppy / bitter smell. Fresh cut grass and oranges.
Taste - The taste is quite bitter. Slight grapefruit and no malt flavor at all - this doesn't seem very balanced to me.
Mouthfeel - Medium to high carbonation and the warmth of the alcohol comes through.
Overall - Compared to other IPAs I have had, this one is a bit heavy handed with the amount of bitterness present. I would have preferred some malt characteristics and tropical fruit. Probably wont seek this one out again. 657 charactersshadetree67, Nov 14, 2013

A - Dark golden (on the edge of orange). Eggshell head leaves OK lacing.
S - Very hoppy. Catpiss first, then underlying peaches, apricots, and mangos.
T - Again very bright tropical notes upfront. Definite catpiss component, plus the peaches, apricots, mango flavors. Bitterness creeps in on the finish, but not harsh. Their is a slight sweet malt backbone that makes it smooth. There is a slight alcohol note, but not off-putting. It accentuates the hop flavors.
M - Crisp and light for the ABV. Carbonation is medium high and lively. Makes it seem like a lighter beer than it is.
O - Great beer nose-wise. The smell really pops and makes the whole experience more enjoyable. I also really like the hop combinations. Had the last version on tap at the brewery and thought it was more malty and boozy. 973 charactersjeff1973, Nov 14, 2013

Stone Enjoy by 11.12.13
22oz
Pours a clear, light amber. Tight white head retains nicely. Average retention. (3.5)
Aroma is floral-hoppy, slight ester. Pear, fresh-cut grass, tropical fruit, orange. Pretty nice, though not quite as bright as I expected. Slightest bit of paper (oxidation). (3.5)
Flavor is not terribly bitter up front, but the bitterness does linger on the palate. Clean, no autolyzed yeast flavor. Sweet malt and light caramel. Heavy/dank hop flavors come through more in the flavor, as does the citrus. Simcoe funk and Amarillo grapefruit. Alcohol is apparent, but not boozy. Very drinkable for a DIPA, and quite warming. (4)
I waited until the last day this beer was "fresh" and it still tastes great, though I'm sure it would have been even better two weeks ago. I'd absolutely love it if it were a tad less sweet on the front and had more of a biscuit-not-caramel malt character. (4) 918 charactersdasenebler, Nov 13, 2013

Appearance:
The beer pours a decent and creamy white head. The beer itself a clear orange honey color but that is slightly foggy but that may be because of the glass.
Smell:
The smell has several types of hopes. One of them appears to be floral and another appears to be closer to a grapefruit smell. The sweet malts also make an appearance. Additionally, there also appears to be a bit of fresh grass smell as well.
Taste:
Very bitter hops dominate the taste palate and finish. Additionally, there also bits of alcohol that makes its way through. The malt makes a slight appearance but the hops are so bitter that it's hard to make it out.
Mouthfeel:
Very thick and heavy bodied. The finish feels heavy and lasts a bit that does not give it a very good feel.
Overall:
An okay DIPA under some circumstances but does not really do anything for me. Maybe I'll have to drink one of these earlier than the expiration date. Some people might like the Enjoy be a certain date DIPA gimmick but I'm not one of them. 1,029 charactersHattedClassic, Nov 12, 2013

Haven't had this in a while so thought I'd get it again.  Not sure if my palate has changed that much, but this isn't the same beer I remember.  It's still good, but just not the citrusy tropical bomb I remember.
What an awesome beer. Had this twice. Last one was the 11/12/13 batch. Crisp, clean, tropical and just outstanding. From memory, appearance was clear as you expect from stone. Aroma and taste all tropical hop goodness, just what I look for in an IPA. As of today this beer tops my list. 528 charactershopflyer, Nov 10, 2013

3.74/5  rDev -15%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Poured into a Stone balloon glass. 7-04-15 edition.
Look: The beer is a clear rich honey color. An eggshell colored head recedes to a thick soapy film. Random light lacing on the glass.
Aroma: The beer seems to have a nice malt backbone, but that is immediately covered in spicy hops. There's hints of dry cedar, and only maybe some onion, but the onion note seems to be a non-issue. Dry, spicy, earthy hops in the finish.
Taste: Much like the aroma but midway through very bitter grapefruit rind emerges. There is a lot of dry, spicy heat from the alcohol content. Finishes really bitter.
Mouthfeel: Pretty heavy. This is a sipper for sure.
Overall, I updated my review to the latest batch. There was little or no onion element to this beer unlike the last one I had which was 11-12-13 edition. This is a good bitter, thick, strong IPA. 842 charactersJuicesFlowing, Nov 10, 2013

4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This was the 11.12.13 vintage. Beautiful pour from a growler with a nice head. One of my favorite things when sipping this was the smell each time I put the glass near my mouth. 
I have a weakness for Stone beer and consider them probably the best brewery out there. But this double IPA was as smooth tasting as if not more than the other Stone Beers I have enjoyed. Factor in that is 9.5 ABV but you do not taste the alchohol makes this a rare treat. If you have a chance to get this fresh beer, jump on it.
Please note that the 4.75 on overall instead of 5 is only due to the cost.
But hey you have to spoil yourself every now and then. 638 charactersWrigfen, Nov 06, 2013

A: poured into a IRS 17 oz. glass. Amber color with little foam. Nice lacing.
S: strong hops but also really fruity, 
T: hoppy as expected, but the presence of tropical fruits balance out the bitterness. Finish smooth and tasty.
M: Smooth with the bitterness and sweetness lingering 
O: Very good beer, a must-try IPA if you are wondering what IPA is. Once you had it, you will probably find others to compare. My favorite IPA beer so far. 495 charactersrDi, Nov 06, 2013

4.31/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bought this a few weeks back down at Joe Canal's in Woodbridge. It was behind glass, so I had a feeling that this was pretty special since they had to open up the case to get one for me. Seeing that 11/12/13 is next week, I did enjoy this by its due date and eagerly anticipated the freshness of this. While I thought that the hype turned out to be a bit much for this, I enjoyed this beer and the easy drinkability of this, given how high the alcohol was. It was much smoother than I thought and went down easily, even though I split the bottle with a good friend of mine!
Nice pour to this, as this beer had a crisp golden hue, fluffy head, and lacing that made its mark ring after foamy ring. Lots of earthy, herbal hops and "stink" in the nose, making me think that this was a beer from Green Flash. Then came the taste - soapy, buttery, and sneakily smooth. The hops were recessed but present here as more floral notes predominated. This was so strong but went down so easily and although the taste wasn't immediately addictive, it grew on me. It was a bit like tea, in that the minty notes took a while to grow on me but they soothed at the same time. This certainly felt and tasted fresh from start to finish, as if I had this on tap and not out of a bottle.
Strong, this was but this certainly did not feel it. Downing a whole bottle will make you woozy but with the appeal and bitterness of a Troegs Nugget Nectar combined with a rich array of sensual aspects and a chocolate-chili type aftertaste, there's a ton to like here. This was so clean and crisp that it misled me into thinking that it was an American Amber but alas, it's just an IPA that lives up to the "Imperial" moniker. Loads to love here, even without the date on the bottle. This was one beer that you'll want to drink as soon as you get your hands on it! 1,833 charactersJerzDevl2000, Nov 04, 2013

It's a crystal clear pale amber with a bounteous white head of tight bubbles. Just gorgeous to look at! The aroma is what I would imagine heaven would smell like, with wave after wave of wild flowers, tropical fruits (mango, passion fruit, pineapple, papaya), peaches, citrus (tangerine, grapefruit), lemon-grass, FRESH dank hops, and just enough caramel malt to keep it balanced. Almost every time I drink this I have trouble taking the last sip because I know I won't be able to smell it anymore if I do! Then you have the flavor, which, unlike many top rated DIPAs, actually delivers what you smelled with just as much punch, with even more complexity and balance to boot! Every aroma noted is present in the taste in a big way at some point, with additional flavors such as onion grass (a surprising but pleasant addition), a big malt backbone in the middle (but not so big as to take away from the plentiful fresh hops that are on display), and a mild to moderate bitter hop bite at the finish (may be moderate to heavy for some people, but with all the hop bombs I've had it doesn't feel like a ton to me!). This beer is just perfectly balanced, and quite frighteningly drinkable at 9.4%! I could drink this all day every day if it was available and I was rich enough to not have to work! =P
edit - After the last 2 batches available in NJ were just nowhere near as good as the first 3 I had I felt it necessary to alter my scores from the perfect 5s across the board that I had given it. Please realize that I felt those first 3 batches deserved that score, but inconsistency has made me change my mind. I hope they can match the brilliance that was those earlier batches in the future! 1,849 charactersSadMachine, Nov 03, 2013

A: Nothing really special, poured a nice golden-pale color with around .25" of head and left behind some nice lacing.
S: Very aromatic, luscious tropical fruits and grapefruits, but with a strong hop bite. I love smelling this beer.
T: Initial strong hop flavor with the perfect amount of sweetness to balance it out. And then the tropical fruits come in. I got some juicy pineapple flavors and oodles of grapefruit. 
M: Light carbonation with a medium body. Somehow i could not taste the 9.4 abv at all.

Poured into a DFH snifter.
Beautiful golden color. Very opaque. 
It is a fantastic tasting DIPA. Very nice hop bitterness bite. Very citrusy. It tastes magnificent. It is a tremendous balance of bitterness and malts. 
Consistent mouthfeel through the entire bomber. Very similar in mouthfeel to ruination. 
Overall this is a fantastic beer. Please seek this one out if you are a fan of west coast DIPA's. It is utterly amazing. Kudos to Stone. 466 charactersdancingnancie, Nov 01, 2013

Above is what I wrote when I first had this beer. That was over 2 years ago. Lately the beer has become a Piney west coast IPA. I think the quality has changed for the worse. Still a good beer but not the way I remember it being. 505 charactersGuess2814, Oct 29, 2013

Appearance: A beautiful golden orange color with a thin white head. A very refreshing look to it in which I couldn't wait to dive in. Didn't appear too heavy on the carbonation but it made it's presence known. 
Smell: Strong citrus hops notes of grapefruit, possibly a slight pineapple smell to it. Very pleasant. 
Taste: First sip hits the palette with the taste of citrus...heavy grape fruit barely noticing the alcohol. Finishes smooth and clean on the tongue making me anticipate my next sip.
Mouthfeel: Hop oils sit on the tongue leaving a nice aftertaste that hides the alcohol. It really seemed more like a mid range ipa as far as alcohol and not on the level it contains. 
Overall: I'm a big fan of Stone and this is by far my favorite brew of theirs right next to the double dry hopped Ruination. Very pleased. 945 charactersMattyBones, Oct 29, 2013

Poured into a goblet. Pours a nice cloudy orangy-yellow with very little carbonation. The head quickly disappears, even with a vigorous pour. Small amount of lacing.
Pleasant, surprisingly mellow aroma. The hop profile already seems a bit muddled, not quite sure what it wants to be. I'm having trouble teasing out anything distinctive.
The flavor gets a little more specific, with a rich apricot and mild pineapple flavor at the forefront. The alcohol has a decent bite, and borders on harsh. Usually I like this- here the booze tasted a little like it was spiked with a cheap vodka. It simply wasn't compatible. 
The mouthfeel was surprisingly sticky, yet wicked dry. I don't really know what to make of it. I guess it slightly compliments the flavor profile, but it's not particularly pleasant in and of itself.
I don't want to call this a complete disappointment. But it's a beer that doesn't really know what it wants to be. It's dry, yet finishes sticky and a little sweet. The hop profile is slightly all over the place- some may call this "complex," but out of a world class IPA, I expect an identity. This is a nicely-made, well-rounded, strong-flavored, yet ultimately boring IPA. 1,318 charactersstonermouse, Oct 29, 2013

Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVED this beer. I had it on tap at Falling Rock in Denver, CO. The keg ran out as he was pouring it, so he tapped a new one, so I got the first pour out of a keg.
It was a dark copper, but was completely transparent, not murky like a lot of IPAs. This also was so hoppy and bitter. My girlfriend had a pint of Russian RIver Blind Pig, and when comparing the 2, Enjoy By blows BP out of the water. 
I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys solid IPAs or DIPAs. 
Very citrusy taste, extra hoppy. That's why I loved it. 574 charactersxVERITAS, Oct 28, 2013

Pours out a nice golden color, almost light orange. West coast IPA color. Very good clarity. Holds a decent white head, pretty good sticky lacing. 
Holy aroma! Initially it's big juicy tropical fruits, pineapple, mango. As it warms some vegetal hops comes out. Dank all over, a bit catty. 
All about the hops. Vegetal, juicy tropical fruits, dank, grapefruit citrus, nearly a little bit of everything from the hops. No real malt detectable both in the taste and aroma. Not an overly aggressive bitterness, just about right. 
Quite light in the mouthfeel, makes very a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA, very west coast like. 
Quite an outstanding DIPA, up there with the best IMO. Can't drink enough of this. 829 charactersdogfishandi, Oct 27, 2013

Appearance: Pale honey with good clarity and an off-white cap of foam.
Aroma: A hop bouquet of tropical fruits, with an emphasis on mango, and just a hint of dank hop juice. It has that great almost musty aroma that is synonymous with west coast IPAs, in my opinion.
Taste: This one definitely has the 'it' factor. The flavor begins with some crisp piney bitterness up front that morphs into a tropical ride for your palate. The hop character hits the perfect mix of pine, west coast fruits, and that touch of dankness that all the great IPAs balance so well. Speaking of balance, the malt is basically nonexistent here--which works in its favor. The 9.4% ABV is likely what is keeping the hops in line, but it is very hard to detect any alcohol presence. The 88 IBUs really make the most of their power, diminishing slightly in the finish before blasting through to echo around in the aftertaste for a very long time. It's not difficult to enjoy this one.
Mouthfeel: Just below medium in body which is quite a feat for an imperial brew. The carbonation keeps things lively but is just a tad excessive (nothing a vigorous pour can't fix). Suburb drinkability which is dangerous given the ABV but makes taking down a bomber no problem.
Final Thoughts: I was lucky enough to try an earlier batch of Enjoy By on-tap in Colorado in a flight next to PtE a couple months ago and Enjoy By was the better of the two (albeit by a narrow margin). The lack of malt flavor makes this beer even more impressive because there are no detectable flaws in the flavor and it seems to be consistent from one batch to the next. The Enjoy By series proves that Stone gets it. They understand that the consumer wants a fresh product, which means a lot coming from such a large brewery that doesn't need to be doing this kind of thing to survive in the vastly expanding craft beer industry. I have the utmost respect for Stone because they have respect for the consumer. The fact that Enjoy By is such a fantastic IPA is just the icing on the cake in this situation. Would I drink it again? Yes, anytime I can get my hands on it. 2,130 charactersJamesMN, Oct 26, 2013

A: 3/3 - golden-orange coloration, impressive clarity as per usual for a Stone IPA (can both see or read through), initial soapy white head dissipates into subtle glass lacing, moderate alcohol legs which re-agitates the carbonation on swirling
S: 11/12 - as expected from a Stone IPA, there's heavy citrus fruit - grapefruit, pineapple and apricot - hop character likely from "C" hops; as the beer warms, some dank piney-resiny aromas punch through; pils malt character in the background for balancing but the hops totally shine through in the aroma, which is most impressive because this bottle shipped across the U.S. and was kept at RT behind the shelf in the store!
T: 18/20 - on the anterior tongue, tropical/citrus fruit like bitterness predominates; it the middle of the mouth, the bitterness continues to linger with some pils balance and muted alcohol flavors; finishes drier than the already-dry Stone IPAs; aftertaste is a pleasant citrus flavor that invites sip after sip...after sip (if I had more!)
M: 4/5 - moderate body with resiny hop oils sitting on the tongue tongue, the alcohol is present but I definitely don't get 9.4% ABV; impressively high carbonation for a ~10% imperial IPA that does not detract from the flavor profile 
O: 9/10 - another major win from Mitch Steele and hop bursting; as much as I enjoy RuinTen, I think that this one even surpasses it; it reminds me a lot of Founders Double Trouble, and it's up there with the best DIPAs in the world (HT, PtE, Abrasive et al.); I have had an older version in the greater D.C. area but I don't recall it being this great; I'm excited to brew a huge modified hop burst DIPA with Amarillo, Bravo, Centennial, Citra and Zythos after this beer has whet my appetite; and, for $9.99 in an expensive beer city like D.C., I cannot think of a better beer bargain in the DMV; please come back to us soon!

I do as I'm told... this time.
Appearance: Bright clarity, almost transparent infusing the light with a golden hue. Holds a cover and collar of bright white foam that leaves spotty curtain lacing behind.
Smell: Hop oils, citric and pine, almost to a burning g intensity. Get a hint o bread yeast (does Stone have a house yeast?) and just a hint of sugary base. This may burn a bit.
Taste: Full juicy hops are bitter, citric, pine, pineapple, grapefruit extract; just the glory of a fresh hop cone. The base malt high as much as possible without being absent. White bread, cracker dry malt seems to be the white wall the dripping green hop vines have been splattered against. The end story is the upper limit of hop bitterness just before it starts to eat through the glass. 
Mouthfeel: Heavy body, almost sparkling carbonation crops off to leave a heavy lasting coat of hop oil that dries and strongly encourages the next sip.
Overall: They heard you like hops. 998 charactersHardTarget, Oct 26, 2013

This was a lucky shelf pull late in the game for me, as this series is not readily available where I live. So, I am enjoying this beer a little over a month late... however, I am quite sure that the hop flavor has not broken down in any sort of drastic way. I believe in drinking hoppy beers fresh, but unlike a lot of the talk on the BA message boards, I strongly believe IPAs have a shelf life of several months (and even at that point they are not totally 'bad').
Moving on, as I look upon this beer in my glass, it looks simply glorious! It's a pale golden color, with decent clarity and small bubbles rapidly rising to the surface. the head is quite thick and foamy, moreso than your average DIPA, that's for sure. The aroma conjures images of an tangy citrus fruits, like lemon and grapefruit, an evergreen forest, and some kind of breadiness as well. 
Wow, this is really something.... this is a very heavy beer with grassy, herbal, and tobacco-like hop bitterness. My guess would be that Simcoe is part of the hop bill. This is also the type of DIPA that has a strong malt backbone as well, which is manifesting itself as a slightly boozy, biscuity, tart sweetness. It is very much playing second fiddle to the dry-as-a-desert bitterness that peaks in the finish. There is a pleasant taste that lingers for a while in my palate, as the somewhat noticeable alcohol warms me up too. It feels just right - a moderate mouth feel. 
Overall, I'm certainly glad I decided to grab this even though it was a little past its so-called prime. If you're reading this and you stumble upon one of these past the date, don't hesitate to try it, It's definitely worth the money. It goes without saying this has to be marvelous if you are lucky to score a bottle right away too. 1,864 charactersNeorebel, Oct 24, 2013

I enjoyed the Hoppiness without the distraction of so much bitterness, which was a bit wierd for a stone beer. I was expecting a booze bomb but its actually very balanced. A very smooth 9.4% abv. 304 charactersnumber1, Oct 24, 2013

3.93/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle. Opened 2 days before "drink by" date. Clear dark yellow with a fluffy white head. Initially upon opening, there is a nice hop aroma, but it attenuates slight soon thereafter. Big malt profile that overpowers the hops. No doubt that this is a double. Some apricot in the nose, but mostly hops and malt. The flavor is good, but the bitterness is a little harsh. Palate is perfect for a double. Medium carbonation that rapidly dissipates. It's a big beer. Well done, but a little heavy-handed. I like what Stone is trying to do here. I just prefer an IPA with a bit more balance. 584 characterschickenflea, Oct 24, 2013

Crystal clear light gold to orange with a strong 2 1/2 finger off white head. Amazingly thick, clingy lacing. Carbonation is evident.
Very fresh hugely hoppy aroma. Very herbal. Grapefruit and peel, pine and freshly cut wild herbs like homeopathic medicinals. It smells healthy.
Bitter homeopathics and grapefruit peel repeated and elevated compared to the aroma. Slight taste of alcohol early on. A fleeting hint of almost cinnamon in the back of the mouth. As the beer warms, the bitter characteristics mellow out and the sweet malts blend with the hops to mimic a tropical fruit punch.
Medium thick, not quite creamy. Peppery with light syrup. Very warming.
Incredible aroma and taste. My favorite double IPA ever. Even better than Firestone Double Jack.

T - out of this world!
M - hardy and full of citrusy hops.
O - this is up there with the best of 'em my friends. Stone has knocked another one out of the park, not too many competitors able to touch this one! Simply amazing.
Post Initial Review Note: 09.13.13 was close to a perfect 5! 11.13.13 not as good, recommendation is to try many releases as possible and often! 2.14.14 closer to 9.13.13 release, great stuff Stone! 4.20.14 release was superb, really not digging the 12.26.14 release, maybe next time! 02.14.15 was excellent! 04.20.15 amazing! 07.04.15 just okay. 10.31.15 getting back up there, great stuff! 893 charactersrkf1976, Oct 21, 2013

Appearance: Clear burnished gold with moderate white head, leaving light lace.
Smell: I smell hops and hop oil, but can't pinpoint the actual aroma very well. Citrus, pine and tropical notes seem to be blended together.
Taste: Fairly sweet malt core with loads of fresh hops on top. Orange, grapefruit, mango, peach, pine - lots going on but individual characteristics are hard to separate. Finish is spicy and piney, but only somewhat bitter.
Feel: Medium body, moderate carbonation, creamy and oily. Mostly dry finish.
Overall: I absolutely love the concept of this beer, and the execution mostly lives up to the concept. A little more distinct aroma and a little more dryness, and this could have been a home run. I will settle for a triple however. Great stuff. 788 charactersbsp77, Oct 19, 2013

I have had slightly maltier incarnations, but this one, 11/12/13, is one of the brighter and sweeter specimens. it has the maltiness that an imperial should while still getting that sharp and bright hop character that Stone IPAs are famous for. 
very pretty pour. lots of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass that keep rising as it sits. some fingers of foam decorating the glass, bright amber color. very uniform. grows more bitter as it warms.
it smells like heaven. very bright, very warm, very sweet. a little bit of grapefruit and bread, which is better than it sounds. 
does not drink like a 9% beer. very easy to quaff. way too easy to quaff! I look forward to more beers in this series. 780 charactersfragilemacabre, Oct 16, 2013

A very deceptive 9.4% on the palate, it hits the head not long after passing the gums. Mild peach and nectarine notes in the flavor, along with the same sort of tartness and bitterness those fruits can provide. A lingering top note of sweetness is there that persists beyond the IPA bitterness. 
I've had a few of these Enjoy By beers and they've all been lovely. I hope Stone keeps up the trend. 449 charactersommegangpbr, Oct 16, 2013

S - Without hyperbole, THE most wonderful aroma of any beer I've ever had. Fresh, spicy, green, vanilla, mango, pineapple, it goes on and on. So inviting it's incredible.
T - The theme of freshness is underscored here. IPA fans will have a lot to love. May be one of the most intense beers available. Crisp green piney bitterness packs a punch and is followed by soothing sweet tropical fruit softness. Complex and interesting every time. 
M - Alternates between smooth creamyness and sharp bitterness. The remarkable balance of these qualities livens the palate without wearing it out. 
O - Stone's sublime dedication to beer craftsmanship has yielded yet another masterpiece, and we IPA fanatics may once again reap the gratuitous rewards. Outstanding! 836 charactersChugMan, Oct 13, 2013

It pours gorgeous yellow with much head and lace. The aroma is nearly perfect. What could be more perfect? It is overpowering, as appropriate for the style. Crazy amounts of floral and piney.
The taste similarly is a hops overdose. Stupendous. The aftertaste lingers huge and bitter. What a treat. I am going to enjoy several glasses of this after which I will take it easy a bit and then clear my palate, because nothing can hold a candle to this. First rate stuff.
I also have a bomber of this to try later this weekend, but this draft is amazing. I am certain the bottle will be good too.
7-4-2014 - update - this version has a different taste, especially the aftertaste, which is an amazing crunching into greenery experience. Amazing. 948 charactersschoolboy, Oct 11, 2013

a- light copper with a light foamy white head.
s- Beautiful! Tons of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus and hops galore! It even has this unique sour candy aroma that is extremely pleasant! 
t- Bitterness on the tip of the tongue that quickly fades to the sweeter citrus side of the beer making it well balanced to say the least. Afterwards the bitterness comes back and lingers alongside a decent floral pine.
m- Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated
o-Phenomenal double IPA! Get it if you can. This beer is probably my favorite IPA alongside Greenflash, and dogfish head 90min IPA. 
i will get more before 10/25/13 671 charactersitlnstallion11, Oct 11, 2013

O- Great beer can't stop drinking it. Glad I got another bottle for another day. I love IPAs and this will be one of my favorites for a long time. Great beer. This, Ruin Ten, Double Bastard, and Arrogant are my go-to beers now. 526 charactersMotorboatMofo, Oct 10, 2013

Pours a hazy bronze color with an inch of airy white head that quickly recedes leaving moderate surface layer and lacing.
Aromas of pine and citrus.
Flavors of both bitter citrus zest and sweet candied citrus peel. There is also a strong pine presence.
Medium bodied and crisp with moderate carbonation and a lingering, bitter aftertaste.
Overall a very nice display of hops. Would definitely try again. 444 characterssrhoadsy, Oct 09, 2013

Poured a hazy copper hue with a one finger frothy white head. There was god retention and very good sticky lacing. 
The smell featured tropical fruit and pine. 
The taste consisted of ripe pineapple, apricot, pine and white pepper atop a firm grainy malt. 
The taste was round with a dry finish and no hint of heat. 
Overall a superior hop bomb that hides it's ABV very well. 388 charactersplaid75, Oct 08, 2013

A- Poured a mostly transparent, copper color with a fluffy off-white head with good retention, and small lively carbonation. Nice lacing, but how much does that really matter?
S- Very hop forward with all sorts of fruity and citrus hop aromas. Tropical fruits, pineapple, leafy herbal hops. A bit of toasty grains and boozy aromas too as it warms. Definitely, some pine in there too.
T- Like sucking on a fresh, wet hop. Bitter on the tips of the tongue all the way through to the bitter finish, but there is enough fruity, hoppy flavor to go along with the bitterness to make for an “enjoyable” experience. The alcohol adds a pleasant flavor and warming finish, but doesn't get in the way of the hoppiness. There seems to be just enough of a malt backbone to keep this beer honest and complement the juicy hops.
M- Full bodied mouthfeel, slick and resinous, but not sticky which could be partly due to the carbonation doing its job. A bitterness hits the back of the palate and throat on the finish; and, along with the retro-olfaction, leaves an herbal, hoppy sensation that lingers. 
O- Everything about this double IPA is intense, distinct, and full flavored. The amount of concentrated hop aromas, flavors, and acids that are packed into this beer is quite impressive. Yet it isn't so domineering, because I wish I had another bottle to drink right now. However, I think this beer is making me realize that I'm not a huge fan of double IPA's at this point in my drinking career, which is reflected in my overall score of only 4. With that being said, I can certainly still appreciate the skilled craftsmanship involved in the creation of this fine brew. 1,742 charactersElijahRivera, Oct 01, 2013

A: Very bright, crystal clear gold. No haze of any kind. Decent head that dissipated fairly quickly, nice lacing.
S: Huge tropical fruit, sweet citrus, as well as some underlying pine resin. Malt comes through as a neutral bready character with a little candy-like sweetness that binds with the hops. The aroma is explosive, intense even for the style.
T/M: Big, smooth hop bitterness that lingers all the way through, it is soon met with huge resiny tropical fruit, citrus and pine notes with underlying spicy, oniony complexities. The malt makes an appearance as well, giving a slightly sweet, bready backbone to the beer that works beautifully with the fruity hop notes. Hops just blast through the bone-dry finish.
Overall: Wow... wow. Big-time west-coast hop-bomb! The hops explode in this beer, and while that is getting more and more common, this one does it with incredible complexity and subtlety. You can pull out a huge array of hop flavors, and they all stand distinct, without a messy overall character. The balance is extraordinary, and that is an accomplishment in the West-Coast IPA style. The concept of this beer is awesome, get it to the customer as fast as possible and teach distributors about the importance of fresh IPAs. But, the execution was even better, Mitch Steele nailed this one. 1,354 charactersSiriusfisherman, Oct 01, 2013

Appearance: Pours a golden orange with two fingers of foamy whitish head that fades relatively quickly, leaving beautiful lacing.
Smell: Just lovely, with tons of tropical fruit, predominately grapefruit and pineapple with lots of citrus. A good deal of Stone-style west coast hop bitterness and piney aromas come through as well. Freshness is evident here.
Taste: Beautiful strong citrus, with the grapefruit and pineapple of the aroma and some mango as well. Despite this, a great deal of pine and grass come through to strike a remarkably balanced DIPA.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with perfect carbonation and solid hop bitterness. A bit of heat, and a nice crisp dry finish.
Overall: Absolutely fantastic, and I'm glad I finally got to try this one. Great beer and I hope we get it again. 874 charactersMikecap, Sep 29, 2013

#95
Bottled Date: 9/20/13
A: Yellow to orange golden with a towering pillow of off white foam that slowly fades to lace on the glass.
S: Mango and pineapple on first pour. Strong citrus, pine and flowers come through as the brew settles. There are also hints of bubble gum and mint founded on a base of bread and honey.
T: This brew brings together the sweetness of mango, pineapple juice, and grapefruit along with honey and cane sugar and juxtaposes that sweetness with earth, pine, flowers, and freshly baked bread. There are also moments of mint and green tea which brings complexity to the palate. Some pepper spice joind the warm finish.
M: The linger is forever and the feel is medium with good supporting carbonation.
O: So fresh and so flavorful. I attribute this mostly to the freshness which really brings the hop flavors out. A must grab and enjoy it now . 899 charactersElSid, Sep 25, 2013

A - Pours a lush clear gold 2 finger of slightly off white head, nice lacing.
S - The aroma is out of control, big mango, pineapple, dank pine, some biscuit bready malt, big juicy tropical fruit hops.
T - Full of those tropical hoppy flavors, nice bready and biscuity malt, some dank pine on the end.
M - Some alcohol burn, but very full, clinging to your palate.
O - Honestly one of the best IPA's you could ever get. Immense tropical fruit flavor but not too sweet, very balanced but bold. 515 charactersOmnium, Sep 18, 2013

22 oz brown bottle with a green, white and black label. Pretty standard and gets the point across with Enjoy By IPA 09.13.13. Overall a nice and classy looking bottling but the stuff inside is what matters. Poured this into a stemmed Belgium style tulip glass. 
A - golden colored body with a creamy white head. Nice smooth fluffiness to it and lasts throughout leaving a lot of slow moving stick. Superb looking beer. Beautiful and lush. Looks and pours like a dream.
S - fresh fresh hop aroma. Somewhat dank hop aroma. Fresh ripe peaches with a basket of tropical fruits. Small and soft grainy malt in the back ground. 
T - soft malt hits first but is an afterthought to the hops that follow. Loads upon loads of gushing hop flavors of ripe peaches, orange, grapefruit rind and tropical fruits. A real dank pine flavor as well as a fresh grassy note creeps up as it screams its freshness and its one of a kind style. A brilliant tasting DIPA. I've never tasted anything like it. 
M - nicely bodied and it carries good texture while covering the entire mouthfeel with loads upon loads of fresh and gushing hop fruitiness. Alcohol is present but mainly bc you know it's there and not bc it comes anywhere close to dominating the palate. I i i i i wouldnt call it a balanced As it is a pretty one sided hop affair, but that abundance of hops are indeed balanced Within theirselves making for a Smooth feel and very enjoyable offering.
O - it is everything it says it is. An extremely fresh double ipa with the quality to back up all the hype. It's something ill always look for from now on. Easily one of the best DIPA's on the planet and one of my new favorites. It has it all the right pieces perfectly in place for a truly special release. I sure hope we get the next batch!

Leaf, tangerine and floral nose. 
Mango on toast, then crazy tangerine and resin hop that segue into some gooey skunk. 
Orange rind and nectarine end and powdery linger.
Round, lt-med, slight cling, no heat. 
Citrus redux. Bright and fresh, with Lagunitas-like tastiness. Roughs up a bit at the end to let you know it's for real but absolutely no heat, making it one of the most smooth and easy DIPAs around. 454 charactersStJamesGate, Sep 16, 2013

A - Pours a very light golden yellow with a nice 1.5 finger head, near white in color. 20+ minutes later very decent lacing remains on the glass and a thick outer ring is still standing, nearly the entire surface of the beer has a very thin film across the top.
S - Smells of aboslutely terrific grapefruit with some mango and pineapple aromas. Some rindy/resinous qualities as well, almost a hint of spice, although I chalk that up to rinds. The more I smell it the more i get a slightly sugary odd aromas, almost like pasta sauce... wierd, this must be the aroma that kills me.
T - Consuming at about 55-60 degrees, maybe slightly warmer than desired, but i like my ipas roughly around 50. Tastes as it smells, initially bitter hops and spiced rinds of grapefruit and possibly orange, sweeter mango type flavors peak through breifly before being fairly overpowered by the resinous/spicy rind flavors at the aftertaste. Aftertaste is dry hoppy bitterness.
M - Really great mouthfeel, well carbonated, medium bodied (at this temp, a little lighter feeling colder, no doubt). Very drinkable and refreshing.
O - Consuming the second glass at a cooler temperature allows more citrusy flavors to shine through the spice i was initially getting from the first glass. fringe 4.5 overall gets the bump up 1,352 charactersMacQ32, Sep 16, 2013

Appearance - The beer was a handsome copper color with a white head. Lacing was demonstrated on the sides of the glass
Smell - The aroma was most emblematic of pine. One could detect the citrus, but the pine dominates.
Taste - Initially, the tongue alerts the brain to tastes of orange and spice. For a DIPA, one might suggest this beer to be quite thick. Toward the aftertaste, one notes a massive hop hit on the roof of the mouth. The thickness allows the hop burn to linger.
Mouthfeel - This is thick, particularly for DIPA. I don't mean this in a negative way.
Overall - At a bottle share, this DIPA was consumed in succession with Pipeworks Unicorn's Revenge. While this one is good, Unicorn's Revenge was the consensus winner. 893 charactersJohnnyHopps, Sep 15, 2013

Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge pineapple, mango, passion fruit, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, peach, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of tropical and citrus hops with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, peach, mango, lemon zest, tangerine, orange rind, passion fruit, pine, floral, and light caramel on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity of big citrus/tropical hop flavors with surprisingly light pine presence; with a moderate malt balance and zero cloying bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a lightly creamy and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA as expected. All around awesome complexity of tropical/citrus hops; and dangerously smooth to sip on for the ABV. An extremely delicious offering. 1,398 characterssuperspak, Sep 14, 2013

Bottled 08/09/13
A= Pours a beautiful translucent dehydrated piss yellowish orange color with a nice thick two fingers of head on it that holds great retention and lacing on the side of the glass.
S= The smell is wonderful. Big bright hops. Potent as hell I can smell it from a ways away from the glass. Nice and grapefruity smelling.
T= The taste is no different. It has a big grapefruit taste to it. Like a super bright in season ruby red. This baby is rolling on all cylinders with the hops that's for sure.
M= This is perfectly carbonated.
O= This is a great beer. I grabbed it on the last day and it's still drinking like a champ. I would drink this tomorrow even if Stone doesn't recommend it. 722 charactersjjanega08, Sep 14, 2013

3.96/5  rDev -10%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Long time craft beer drinker and enthusiast, but this is my first review on Beer Advocate. This review is for 9.13.13.
A - Pours a nice dark copper like a solid Imperial IPA should. About half a finger of head which dissipated a bit quicker than I expected. Some nice lacing. 
S - Piney. Like walking into a nursery during Christmas time when you're looking to purchase that perfect tree. Somewhat grassy, but the aroma is deeper than that. Cannabis like in a way as well.
T - Pine, all pine, in a really, really good way. Hits of rosemary. Definitely not citrusy. Again, it's way deeper than that. Almost woodsy but not earthy. Strong hop flavor but surprisingly not bitter. Great finish.
M - Harsh somewhat at first, but finishes extremely smooth. Not as silky as something like Heady, but very good in its own right. A bit of carbonation, a little more than expected. Amazingly, like others have said, very drinkable. Not sessionable by any means, but definitely a beer you can enjoy a few times in a day or night.
O - Just an excellent Imperial IPA. One of the better I've had in awhile. It kind of gets everything right, but the tad bit of harshness before it mellows out stops it from being exceptional. But, truthfully, that's nit picking as this is a tremendous beer when compared to others in its style. 1,317 charactersTheHopBrewKid, Sep 14, 2013

The aroma of hops jumped out of the bottle with fruity citrus notes, a bit of pine and even the dank hops I know and love. There are obviously a lot of hops which is to be expected from a Stone IPA, but they were handled very well. Loads and loads, but balanced so as not to give you the bitter beer face or palate wrecking experience of some IPAs. There were tropical fruits and citrus on the front end with the pine bitterness coming through on the back leaving a nice bitter coating on your palate. All of these great hop flavors were riding a danky hoppiness that held it all together. The Enjoy By IPA really handled the hops with a more delicate balance. One of my all time favorite IPAs. 749 charactersbrurevu, Sep 11, 2013

A - Standard color for a top-quality IPA. A dark gold with some small sparkles raising in the glass after the pour. A thick finger and a half of off-white head rounding off the top of the pint glass.
S - Like a douglas fur christmas tree. Rosemary, cannabis, cut grass, and grapefruit. Unmistakably an imperial IPA on first whiff. 
T - Grapefruit, basil, fresh pine come to mind. Like I said, dank. Strong, yet unoffensive taste. Easy to enjoy. Hops are strong with this one.
M - This feels ridiculously good upon first sip. I was comparing this to RuinTen, which I love, but this just feels better.
O - If I had a choice between this 17th Anniversary, or RuinTen, I would take this beer without hesitation. I enjoy it more than the 17th anniversary... and even more than the 16th Anniversary. I would put this up with the best-of-the-best double IPAs out there. Double Jack, Pliny the Elder, Cafe Racer 15 - Enjoy By is definitely in the big leagues. One of my favorite IPAs. Easily. 1,142 charactersSwongler, Sep 10, 2013

This review is specifically from a 9.13.13 bottle
A: Poured out a slightly hazy amber color with one finger of white head. Not much retention or lacing to speak of.
S: Big smell of pine, some floral hope and sweet citrus.
T: All the flavors found in the smell but not as potent as I would have expected. The background flavor is of biscuit and pineapple.
M: Medium, creamy body with a lighter and softer carb.
O:These "Enjoy By" brews are wonderful. Also tried a Enjoy By 4.21.13 on tap in prior experience and was very impressed. 9.3 abv and you can hardly tell. A very smooth DIPA that is great to sip on. I would definitely go out of my way for one of these. 821 charactersmpedara429, Sep 10, 2013

Bottle to tulip.
A: Straw color that is slightly golden. Aggressive pour yielded a healthy head that retreated to a frothy rim and minor film. Excellent lacing.
S: Moderate to strong fragrance. Bursts of resin, citrus, grapefruit, straw, and pine. Very well balanced aromas. A tiny bit of booze as it opens.
T: The citrus that is noticeable on the nose turns mostly to pine and resin in the taste. Very strong hop bitterness. Not much booze in the taste, well hidden, even after it opens.
M: Slightly harsh, but a clean finish. High carbonation.
O: Not in my precise IPA wheelhouse, but I certainly enjoyed this beer. I will certainly enjoy it again next time it comes around. I really enjoyed the multi-layer aromas. This beer changes slightly as it opens, but its better darn good crisp and cold. 842 charactersmacher0, Sep 06, 2013

A: Pale bronze with a vicious white head. lots of carbonation bubbles from the bottom.
S: Pine tar and resin with a slight floral component. A little herbal. fresh grass and bright sharp citrus before and onslaught of ripe peach, nectarine and orange.
T: Taste definitely doesnt disappoint. Flower pollen and grapefruit hit you at once. Sweet tangerine and burnt orange zest follow it up. Sticky caramel and peach show up before bitter pine resin stick it straight to your tastebuds. A little spicy herbal finish that stays with you all night.
M: Very crisp for a double. light with more carbonation than i expected. proceed with caution because this is dangerously drinkable. 
O: Stone has been on fire recently and this is no exception. an absolute standout. I need more! /96 789 charactersschwemjw, Sep 06, 2013

4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This is a review of the 09.13.13 IPA. Drank it on 09.04.13.
Got a growler of it from Oliver's Brew Crew in Albany, NY, poured fresh from a keg. Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. light copper/golden in color and crystal clear (flitered?) with a thick white head that fades to lacing on the glass. This one is an amazing double IPA. Smells of passion fruit, grapefruit and some mango in the background. Little to no malt in the aroma. The taste starts off slightly sweet and explodes with citrus flavor up front: grapefruit and passion fruit with just enough sweetness to balance it out, but nothing to stand in the way of the hops. Middle gets a bit more fruitiness form the hops: mango. Finishes with a touch of piney resinousness and a light lingering bitterness. A touch of alcohol heat, but it in no way tastes to be the 9.4% it claims. 
Overall, just what a DIPA should be. It's a high octane beer that drinks easy. This one is focused intensely on hop flavor and aroma with just enough bitterness and malt to balance the beer out and hide the alcohol content. One of the best DIPAs I've had. 1,108 charactersspokeydonkey, Sep 05, 2013

Had the privilege of enjoying it on tap at the Craft Ale House in Limerick, PA. This beer rivals Pliny The Elder or Firestone Double Jack IPA. Great citrus from the first sip and great hops throughout with a good malty finish. This is a top flight beer! 313 charactersBeerHo, Sep 04, 2013

Appearance clear orange, with bright white half-finger head. Some lacing.
Smells great...piney and sweet but not overwhelming.
Taste is similar. Really piney/syrupy, sorta dank but not dried at all,very wet. Juicy.
Feels smooth, if not a bit thick for an IPA.
Overall fantastic. It's got a lot-a-bit of everything and for some May be too much. I enjoy it very much. 420 charactersrodlavers, Sep 04, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a couple bombers of this gem from Carson Street Deli on the South Side of Pittsburgh. Specifically, this is the "9/13/13" edition. Poured the first one into a snifter. Don't judge me, but I drank the whole bottle myself. Good decision.
A: Pour resulted in a finger of an off-white head which faded within a couple minutes, kissing the glass with beautiful lacing. Heavens to Betsy, what a beautiful color this beer has. A brilliantly clear amber-orange that invites one to dive right in. Another beer that has a glow. As I drank, this beer continued to leave it's mark on the glass.
S: An incredibly floral beer with dominant pine aromas. Of course, in pure "West Coast-ian," Stone fashion, citrus also tickles the nose. As the beer warms, sweetness becomes more present. This is, undoubtedly, one of the better smelling beers I've enjoyed. I'd never leave a woman's side if she smelled like "Enjoy By."
T: Follows the nose wonderfully. Fresh hops right off the bat. Sweetness makes its presence known as I swallow. Another rush of hops at the end of the sip. Heavy pine in the after-taste mixed with citrus flavors, most notably, grapefruit. At 9.4%, this beer is sneaky. Alcohol is hidden well. Hardly any presence in the flavor other than it's warming presence down the throat. I just about cried when I came to the last sip of this beer. 
M: This beer will not leave you alone as hop oils cover the palate. Carbonation is hardly noticeable giving this beer a great mouthfeel. Dangerously drinkable. I should know. I imbibed 22 oz. of it quite easily.
O: A brilliant beer from Stone... yet again. The freshness of this beer just made it that much more enjoyable. Maybe I'll be generous enough to share my second bottle with a friend. A very good friend. A thoroughbred hop-head. 1,796 charactersjbwimer, Sep 04, 2013

I was actually off the day I had it and was just swinging by the office to pick up my paycheck and take it to the bank,which is right by the bottle shop,how convenient! It was heaven in a glass!!! Nice and stinky,looked just perfect,color,carb,lacing... and it was a taste explosion. Hop bomb delight!!!! This is the first beer I have ever given a 5 to. I swore I didn't think there was a 5 out there,there is,this is it!!! Went back the next night with my built in designated driver(my wife) and enjoyed a few more! If this beer has and equal or one is ever brewed I hope the good lord sees it fit to have it find it's way to my lips...It is the holy grail of beers as far as I am concerned!!! 891 charactersIDABEERGUY, Sep 03, 2013

A: CLEAR! Must have been filtered, nice head which dissipates with not too much lacing (I reckon due to the strong hopping)
S: Wow. First IPA I've ever tried that made me think WEED more than Heady Topper. Outstanding
T: Again, incredible dank/citrus hops with minimal malt backing (just enough, thank you Stone for not being too sweet!), complex and I think I like this even better than Heady Topper which is the highest praise I can think of

Served: 1 September 2013
ENJOY BY 09.13.13
Appearance: A magnificent light copper/amber color, crystal clear, with a small, half finger head clinging around the top of the snifter. Nice white head, minimal lacing.
Smell: Incredibly assertive hop smell- extremely clean and crisp piney and bitter citrus notes jump out at you, but don't overpower you. I could just sit and smell this one and be happy, but the smell makes the beer so much more tempting to sip...
Taste: Big hop presence in this one. Nice semi-sweet malt backbone really carries the flavor. The hops hit you up front, but really mellow out on the back. While some DIPAs tend to feel like they coat your tongue in bitter hoppiness, this one is different. The hoppiness is concentrated on the front portion of the tongue, and then the sweet maltiness really balances out the flavor profile after you swallow. The beer finishes an astonishing semi-dry, even with all the hops. 
Mouthfeel: Good carbonation for the style. I actually preferred this one more as the carbonation left the beer since it seemed to emphasize more of the malt backbone.
Overall: My 150th unique beer according to my personal list, and certainly one worthy of the milestone. This is an incredible beer, and I would highly recommend it if its distro'd out to your area. Would by again without thinking twice. ENJOY BY 09.13.13! 1,437 charactersBeric, Sep 02, 2013

It pours a handsome looking golden amber with a lingering silky white head and great clarity.
The aroma is alive with floral and spruce hops as well as a biscuit note in the background. Clean scent.
The body is better than medium but not quite bold with a smooth coating feel on my tongue and back of my throat.
The taste begins slightly sweet and biscuit-like but it does not take long for the hops to attack the rear and take over everything. Over 9% ABV and the alcohol is well-integrated and not even noticeable. Moderate lingering finish.
I had this one back to back with the ever outstanding Alchemist Heady Topper and I actually liked this one better. Must be those west coast hops rather than Vermont hops. 768 characterspuboflyons, Sep 01, 2013

Umm...well yaa its really really good!
After a fine pour into my farvret tulip it had a loverly orangish, copper glow with a b a utiful 2-3 fingers of foam on the top, which settle into a loverly lace along the sides.
Now a nice little twirl or two and a big sniff...oh yeah....big pine and maybe peach hit my nose with an allure of something that I like A LOT...big hops!!
OkAy, taste time...hits the tongue right away with a bitter hop bomb and just keeps going, maybe black chery with some sort of spicy citrus, can't put a name on it but whatever it is it is very good. They definately got it right. If you are a lover of the hops like me then you will love this one!
It feels perfect in the mouth, just the right bitterness with a bitter/sweet aftertaste that just keeps wanting to be tried again and again. and I will try again, my store had 4 left and I will be going back to buy the rest hopefully before someone else figures it out. keep it coming Stone, beer is good! 1,115 charactershomersimpson67, Sep 01, 2013

Appearance: This beer pours a clear deep amber with a slightly off-white head and leaves a little lacing.
Smell: Piney with some citrus and earthiness. Exactly what a dipa should smell like.
Taste: Very similar to the smell, but the nuances and balance of each flavor pull through a lot more. The alcohol is completely hidden behind the hop and malt notes. Perfectly balanced between hoppy and earthy.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very drinkable. 
Overall: Stone crushed it once again. I have had two of the previous batches, and the consistency has been outstanding. This series is easily top tier among double ipas, and at an amazing value as well. It has quickly become a benchmark of the style. Any hophead should enjoy this beer. 757 charactersawakeavast, Aug 31, 2013

Pours a clear yellow, amber. Brilliant and has a fast falling head of white foam that leaves loose bubbles and a ring and cap . Film on top and great lace. 
Nose is pineapple and sweet from the ripe fruit. Dry pine needles and some grapefruit to be tart and to tease you a little. Omy. There's not a lot of malt on the nose but what there is smells earthy and breaddy. Not too sweet just a breath of honey. Like if I leaned in close and then whispered the word "sweet." The real sweetness on this nose is from fruits and that excites. The hops are succulent even on the nose and floral.
The taste is out of this world. Malt is lightly breaddy and flows like silk under the sweetness of the fruit. It doesn't offer too much and stays just behind the pine needles and the pineapple. There's a little orange that comes forward as it warms. This beer is perfectly balanced and there's a nice dry bitter. Not loud, not tremendous, just right. The hops are plump and floral on the palate and juicy in and of themselves. If that's even possible. This has a fluffy malt character that is light as a feather and then there's resin and oil and pungent spice but not too awful much. Just enough. 
This beer is the reason you drink an IPA. It's bountiful in it's hop character. It's decadent in it's fruit sweetness. It's malt is superb and flows underneath it all to lead you to a spectacular bitter. It's pronounced but it's not egregious. It's not heavy, it's light. the mouthfeel is something you don't even think about until you are lost in the aftertaste. So glad I tired this. One of the best beers I have had this year. 1,645 charactersutopiajane, Aug 31, 2013

I love this beer. Every 3-4 months a new one comes out and it's just as amazing as the last and always so fresh. I'm sure I'm spoiled as some people can't seem to get it often enough.
A firm pour provides a modest bit of foam, I don't expect much lacing given the head. Crystal clear (too much so but it's crazy fresh) with a dark golden orange head. This looks a bit darker than their normal IPAs but not much.
The nose is HUGE full of citrus grape fruit and just intense grape fruit rines. The level of dryness is mind blowing, this is going to be amazing. 
A complex blend of just explosive hops, I mean these are just off their rocker. A massive sucker punch of grape fruit, tangerine, mango, and god knows what else come at you like a thunder bolt. the beer is sweet, but hell if I could tell you anything about the malt. The hops start a billionth of a second after the first taste and they don't let up, period. 
The beer drinking surprisingly light, the hop body and bite mixed with such a clean carbonation makes this amazingly easy to drink. The hops just ripping your tongue apart are the only thing to remind you this might be a high abv beer. 
I'm not sure if the balance and blend of perfect malts with perfect hops happens here. It just misses on the most elite of elite ipa's but I'm splitting hairs here. 1,382 charactersbobhits, Aug 30, 2013

O - A shock goes through me every time I see the "Enjoy By" label appear on the shelves. I then proceed to clear the rack. This has everything I want in a big IPA; deep bassy malts, intense bitters, and a strong abv. 618 charactersJAFoley, Aug 30, 2013

4.58/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I bought this bottle online from Bringonthebeer.
A- it pours a crystal clear gold with a close to a 1 finger head of foam that seems to be shrinking slowly, leaving some lacing behind.
S- the aromas oozed out of the bottle when I popped the cap. Hoppy as all get out. Big grapefruit, decidedly bitter to the nth degree. Reminds me of a certain "triple" IPA, which shall remain nameless, that went above and beyond my comfort zone. This smells very oily with the hop presence..
T- laws yes..err...no. It's not at all like the other brew I didn't mention by name. Well, they are both VERY hoppy and bitter but this has an oily/fresh hop flavour that kills it. Light on the malt but not that light. Mid palate is where I notice it the most...a kind of earthy malt presence. 
The rest is all the best of what hops can bring to the table and I "should" know. I have had some of the best thanks to online orders, TRADES, and what I can find off the shelf locally.
M- tongue stickingly great. Perfect carbo and body. The latter..woo, woo, woo!
O- I guess I kind of get what the hoopla is all about with Enjoy By. Yes.I.do! 1,121 charactersBitterbill, Aug 30, 2013

A: Slight yellow-strawish color. A bit hazy. Lack of carbonation bubbles visible. Solid head that fades into a slight spiderweb lacing. Interesting.
S: Grapefruit, citrus, pine and a slight fading alcohol.
T: Pine, grassy notes, followed up by big grapefruit and citrus explosions. Alcohol is undetectable. 
M: Heavy for a DIPA, but carbonation balances well. Bitter from beginning to end. Just how a DIPA should be.
O: Only thing I can say..A must have. This is the third time I've had a beer from this series. All amazing. 574 charactersBoardwalkBock, Aug 29, 2013

took a little while to find this series, but a local distributor got a keg today and i filled up my growler posthaste. $20 for 64oz growler seemed like a solid deal to me (normally around $9 for a bomber). poured about a pints worth to celebrate finding it. Color was one the lightest DIPA's I can remember. the nose was mostly piney, with a hint of spice, very solid. TASTE was great, piney with i'm guessing some onion maybe, something kicking it up a little, and the solid bitter finish. a nice unique blend that i've never tasted. malt isn't so pronounced, just enough to let the hops do their thing, i.e. not so much balanced as it is geared toward the hop-head. the only downside would be the mouthfeel, a little light, i like my doubles to feel like doubles, this drinks like a regular IPA, which isn't really a bad thing depending on how you look at it. insane drinkability, love this beer. i haven't really had a Stone offering that I REALLY loved yet, but this is Definitely the first. For anyone who needs that foot-in-the-door to Stone, dig it. Bottom line, an absolute must have.
edit: next night (bout half the growler left) definitely got some Bubblegum notes in the nose, but not much in the taste. 1,245 characterslabattblueribbon, Aug 29, 2013

Appearance-
Golden copper color, but missing a fiery red hue I like to see in my hoppy beers.
Smell-
Oh my god, oh my god kyle. It is of that define ambrosia that I liken to a slight tropical bubblegum, with crisp fall bitter. This smell makes me scream, "TAKE MY MONEY!"
Taste-
I wanted to find more fault, I really did. It is one of those rare switch from the nose. I taste the bitterness first, and it mellows into a fruit sweetness almost ending in watermelon notes.
Mouthfeel-
A little weak on the bubble, but it is hard to detract from the delicate coating and flavor left.
Overall-
Second time I have been able to find this excellent series, and it is one of those fantastic beers that makes the whole chase and luck worthwhile. 748 charactersRope, Aug 29, 2013

A strong hop bomb hits the nose and tongue, shattering the competing sweet caramel and citrus in the background. The carbonation and body are overwhelmed by the perfection of hops and hop taste.

A: pours pretty clear. I would say a deep golden hue. really great clarity for a DIPA. frothy bright white head has great retention and leaves a good deal of lacing on the way down. 
S: after the initial pour this smells like copious amounts of hop oils. definitely grapefruit, definitely pine. a lot of hop resins here. all about the hops. very American. wouldn't hate for some malt balance, but that would be tough to compete with all this resin. 
T: a bit of bubblegum. virtually no grain presence. really resiny on the back-end. not overwhelmingly bitter in the finish, a little during the drink though. I mean it is there, but not as much as most brews of this hop magnitude. a bit of alcohol burn too. 
M: pretty mellow carb. tingly. full bodied for sure. works.
D: really tasty stuff from Stone. I love how much this beer demands fresh consumption. I am sure it is quite the challenge for their distribution staff and network, so that gets extra points in my book. 1,035 charactersJimmys, Aug 28, 2013

A- Amazing, medium golden to near red in thicker parts of the glass. It's crystal clear. Thick white head that diminishes in about two minutes but some remnants remain.
S- If there is a weak point to the beer, this is it. The hops smell surprisingly understated while I get more caramel and grain aromas. 
T- Pine and mild floral hopping jump right out at you. Pay a little more attention and I found a bit of crystal malt back their. I would not say that this is an super complex beer but the hopping clearly utilized multiple additions. Basically, the whole beer is meant to be a platform for the hops... as it damn well should. 
M- Medium body. Medium-high carbonation adds to drinkability and increases perception of hops. Very well done in my opinion. I never have much to say about mouth feel.
 O- I really like this beer. I'd buy it again. If I could improve one thing it would be making the grain bill more pronounced but hey, its an IPA. 960 charactersShabedue, Aug 27, 2013

a: Clear deep gold with a finger thick white head which receded quickly to very thin patches of surface foam and some stringy lacing.
s: Pine with a slight oniony tinge.
t: Bitter pine hits immediately, but the underlying feel is refreshingly light. Seems like a near perfect Southern California/Southwest US beer, light yet spicy. 9.4 ABV very well hidden except perhaps going down.
m: Light at first, but the hop bite lingers on the sides of the tongue and even in the throat, making it seem more substantial.
o: A different DIPA, the onion hints in the pine bite were not strong enough to be off-putting, and makes this brew distinctive.
UPDATE 9/11/13 had another bottle on a hot night with a cigar in the gazebo, and did not detect the onion. Drank from a tulip glass this time. What came across most was a winsomely slick mouthfeel along with moderate hops. It was still lovely, certainly no reason to downgrade my earlier assessment, only to note a slightly different impression.
UPDATE 11/13/13 FOR ENJOY BY 11/12/13: Enjoying this vintage even more than the last. Wonderfully tasty piney hops dominate a light to moderate, very easy drinking brew, especially for such a high ABV, which it is hard to believe from drinking except for some slight throat burn. Hardly any tongue bite on this one despite the very strong hops flavor. This one I'd score conservatively a:4.0, s: 4.5, t: 4.75, m: 4.5 o: 4.5
UPDATE 2/5/14 for ENJOY BY 2.14.14: Gotta improve my appearance score for this one, to 4.5, two inch tall white head receded slowly to rocky surface foam and dense patterned lacing. There have been so many great new DIPAS out since my last Enjoy By in November, some of which I'd rate close to or even higher than Enjoy By, and it's still so expensive at $8+ a bomber, that I may well stop at buying one bottle per issue from now on. Consider Lagunitas Sucks (not new but the new issue is out, plentiful and relatively cheap), Green Flash Palate Wrecker, Sixpoint Hi-Res, Long Trail Limbo, Smuttynose Durty, Victory Dirt Wolf and Hop Ranch and Otter Creek/Lawson Double Dose, etc. Enjoy By is great, but new competition, some of which is at a lower to much lower price point, is making it less of a must-have IMO. 2,296 charactersscotorum, Aug 26, 2013

The nose gives a powerful blend of pine and citrus hops, with a hint of nectarine underneath. The first sip is wonderfully rich and complex, with an assertive (but not over-the-top) hoppiness evenly balanced with a subtly sweet caramel malt and an odd twinge around the edges that I just can't put my finger on -- maybe a weird blend of mango and onion? Very nice smooth texture, relatively full-bodied, dry on the upper palate. The finish is kind of short, but leaves a nice lingering bitterness. Overall, an excellent example of the DIPA style. Well done, gentlemen. 684 charactersAnotherBeerGeek, Aug 26, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured (into a tulip) almost the color of a single malt with smallish head that quickly disappeared to nothing. Nose was wonderful - citrus (especially orange and grapefruit) grass and some other herbs in the back. Taste is, at first, pretty dry and bitter but quickly gives way to sweet citrus notes of lemon, mango and grapefruit. Finish brings in just enough malt to balance this nicely. Alcohol warming is there as you would expect with the ABV, but not excessively. Carbonation is fairly low but present nevertheless. Mouthfeel is medium but doesn't present an overly cloying or sticky feel as you might expect. All-in-all, this is a delicious west-coast style IPA I hope Stone shares again.
9-13:"Enjoyed" from a bottle purchased from Pinocchio's in Media and served in a snifter. Poured a light golden orange with a one-finger head which dissipated almost immediately to a thin coating. While there was light lacing, it marked the glass throughout. The nose was oranges, lemon, grapefruit, mango, and pine. The taste was wonderfully hop-centric, with oranges and lemon predominating but the malts in the background ALMOST come forward for balance. The finish was only slightly bitter, moderately dry and slick. Beer was medium in body and somewhat oily with nice carbonation. None of these descriptors would necessarily suggest my conclusion that this was a GREAT DIPA. I wasn't prepared for HOW good, given my previous experiences with Stone's other Enjoy By offerings. If you like hoppy beers, you MUST try this! 1,521 charactersregspeir, Aug 25, 2013

Arrives in a pint glass with a half finger of foam. Clear bright orange color. Aroma is fantastically hoppy, redolent of grapefruit and citrus. Wow. First sip is an explosion of hoppy goodness with a very smooth finish. No harsh bitterness here and just enough malt to round things out. This beer is hop flavor in a glass without any harsh bitterness or cloying sweetness. 
It's been a long time since I've had an ipa this good and is making me fall in love with hops all over again. I will look for this beer again! 571 charactersFickleBeast, Aug 25, 2013

A – Poured a light honey/golden wheat color with a one finger head that left little lacing. 
S – Big grapefruit aroma up front. Faded a bit as the beer warmed. 
T – Not as great as I was hoping. A touch oily but masked by the tropical notes. Of course the west coast hops are ever present as expected.
M - Mouth feel is good for a DIPA. The alcohol is remarkably hidden as I didn't realize it was 9.40% until I looked it up. 
O - I was happy I was finally was able to catch this limited release on tap. The nose was the star of the show. This beer is incredibly fresh, another winner from Stone.
As an edit I had the 12.26.14. The nose was extremely oniony which was a big time turn off. Couldn't get past that. It was fresh but I wouldn't give it a 99. Maybe a b*. What happened? 856 charactersWheelsPSU, Aug 25, 2013

Appearance- Pours a copper color with a half inch head that recedes to a slight foam on top and leaves good lacing. Lots of visible carbonation, a bit much for the style.
Smell- Hops and more hops. Nice blend of citrus and pine, strong smell but not overpowering. I do get a background smell of onion that a lot of others have experienced with this release, but I think it compliments nicely.
Taste- Again lots of hops with a bitterness to be expected from stone. I get bitter grapefruit and pine with that onion again lingering in the background. I get a slight caramel flavor as it warms though I would like a bit more of a malt backbone.
Mouthfeel- Medium body with a bit high carbonation. Leaves a slick resin after swallowing.
Overall- Really good beer. The onion character is actually a good accent for both the taste and smell. Not an overly dry beer and very drinkable. 936 charactersIPAdams, Aug 25, 2013

A - Pours a crystal clear light honey hue with a one finger creamy head that fades to leave light lacing and a thin blanket. 
S - Mmmm...yeah, dig the nose. Nice almost bubblegum hop aromas here, grapefruit, super faint tropical, nicely dank. 
T - Similar to the nose, but not nearly as good. Nice bubblegum notes as well nice bitter pine and grapefruit, solid bitter hop finish. Not getting much tropical notes of floral fruits. Bubblegum, pine, and grapefruit.

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: Light orange to a deep amber yellow, with about one finger of white foam. It dissipates fairly quickly, though it still shows a lot of carbonation and lacing. 
Smell: As I was pouring it, I could smell that signature IPA smell: bitter, bitter hops with a lot of citrus.
Taste: Wow, this is big. There is a lot of orange. It is almost like an orange creamsicle. Mixed with that are notes of orange zest, grapefruit, and lemon rind. There is some sweetness too, almost a hint of vanilla. As I keep drinking, I pick up on more grassy, bitter hop notes, which begin to dominate more and more as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and very creamy, with lots of nice carbonation. It has a nice, crisp, clean, bitter, and almost mouth-puckering finish. 
Overall: This is a great IPA, and a perfect example of the style. It takes bitter to the next level. My girlfriend describes it as an "alcohol waterfall," and that somehow seems appropriate. 990 charactersweltywm, Aug 25, 2013

A - For what it's worth I like the 1/4 inch of head that settles to a thick ring. Means its thick in body with little carbonation which is good. 
S - Smell is hoppy yet mild strong pineapple hops meets some balancing crystal and cracker malts.
T - Well it's hoppy and bitter quite medicinal. Borderlines Ruination in bitterness cloying bitter and sticks to the palate after every sip. OK I guess.
M - Medium and thick in body. bitter and unforgiving.

4.4/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottled on 8/09, enjoy by 9/13.
A: Pours a bright amber. Initial pour was very cautious and produced a less than half-finger head that quickly dissipated, a more aggressive top-off produced a towering creamy off-white head, easily three fingers high, which gradually subsides to a persistent finger or so. Sticky curtains of lacing.
S: Grapefruit is the star here, with powerful undercurrents of pine, lemon zest, apricot. Strong floral notes as well, subtle grassiness and just a hint of biscuity malt. Despite all this, fairly restrained in its attitude...complex and delicious, but it doesn't exactly jump out of the glass at me.
T: An initial wallop of bitter pine and citrus yields quickly to a surprisingly balanced middle, with grassy and earthy notes from the hops mingling pleasantly with sweet bready malts, along with hints of sweeter fruit--pineapple, mango, a bit of peach. Finishes clean, dry, and bitter, slight notes of spiciness and even a little woodiness. The spiciness on the finish masks the alcohol well.
M: Medium-bodied and creamy, pleasantly carbonated. Somewhat oily for most of the mouthful, with a slightly soapy finish.
O: A damn fine beer, not quite worthy of the hype only because of how very much hype every release seems to generate. Strip the fervor that its rotating geographical release causes away, and the beer itself is easily among the best examples of the DIPA category that I've enjoyed. Would have again in a heartbeat. 1,513 charactersLjudsignal, Aug 25, 2013

I mean there is no such thing as a perfect woman so I guess beer would have to fall in that category, please beer take no offense. I usually do not get excited about the color of a beer this one though has a nice peach looking color to it great eye appeal, just something a little different from other IPA's and their copper-orange color. Great hit of citrus when I stuck my nose in my glass, holy crud the alcohol content is hitting me already, WOW, and lingered well after the head fizzled down. The same with the first intake of the beer, real good citrus flavor followed by a smooth and mellow wheat flavor. For being an Imperial (double IPA) this is unusually mellow yet like I said holy crud the alcohol is hard hitting. This is definately not a swilling IPA, take the time to really enjoy this IPA, you will be pleased each pull on this beer is just as good as the first. The good thing is that the after taste of the beer does not hang around leaving you with that "I just licked a leather boot heal" taste in your mouth that some shoddier IPA's will have the tendency to do. This is an excellent IPA, I look forward to the next batch of Enjoy By, Stone Brewing be darn proud of this beer, darn proud. Now if you all will excuse me I have a girlfriend to go drink. 1,383 charactersIPA_OR_NOTHING, Aug 25, 2013

Decent lacing. Great floral aroma up front with nice sweet malt notes in the background. Hoppy bitterness hits the front of the tongue followed by a torrent of pine resin and grapefruit rind. Sweet malt backbone balances the hops nicely. Mouthfeel is where this ale shines; smooth and easy drinking for the ABV. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall, this is an outstanding example of an Imperial IPA, extremely well crafted and balanced. Kudos Stone. 579 charactersJohnG190, Aug 25, 2013

I'm not saying it's hyped up but I love fresh IPA. The concept was something I fell in love with the date is 8/24/13 the bottle says to drink by 9/13/13. Look it's expressive in appearance, copper bright body almost an orange layered hue to the beer with cream almost white head forms thick. Fine speckled lacing I'm again in love, why does this have to be the beer, one which sells out quicker than stores can get it in. Aroma has bright grapefruit, citrus notes that expel any notion of less than fresh hops. It's actually an explosion of hops withheld in a room of fresh hops, earthy qualities are dumbed down by bright citrus. Each gulp goes down smoother than the next, beautiful beer I'm drinking each sip thinking where is the next drink coming from that's a strong hook that radio DJs look for in every overproduced song on the market. This is not overproduced it's just the best quality beer of every quality IPA you have ever tried. Slick oily mouthfeel leads to expressive carbonation levels soft and excellent between every twist and turn get me a case and I will drink it. 1,163 charactersWVbeergeek, Aug 24, 2013

Smell is all hops.
Sweet smelling with gobs of tropical fruit aromas. Pineapple, Mango, orange, papaya, cinnamon and passion fruit. Malt scent is pretty much pineapple juice here.
Starts out sweet and savory. Good bitterness and orange rind. Flavor is not as complex as the smell.
Mouthfeel is good.

4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25I've had a few versions of this brew, but tonight I had the 9-13-13 version twice on tap at the Global Brew Tap Room in O'Fallon, IL. Served in a Boulevard tulip both times. Clear body, dark yellow with slight orange tint. About a one-finger head and decent lacing along the glass.
Nice aroma that starts with a strong note of citrus hops that trend toward a light pine cone aroma. A light, sweet, caramel malt to finish.
The flavor is similar to the aroma, but the hop blend is superb. Citrus, pine, light tropical notes, and just enough bitterness to have a decent bite. The hop/malt blend is nearly perfect for a DIPA - just enough sweet malt balance to the hops. 
Medium thickness in the mouthfeel, with very little notice of the alcohol. This might be the best Stone beer I've ever had. RuinTen is close, but both are exceptional DIPAs. 844 charactersFanofHefe, Aug 24, 2013

Scent is noticeable on opening the bottle. Pinesap and resin, grapefruit, orange peel. Pungent hop notes.
Taste is even better. Minty hops. Spicy hops. Piney hops. Earthy hops. Dank oniony hops. Pineapple hops. Floral hops. Sure there is a crisp lightly sweet malt in there somewhere but who cares. This is a hop beatdown.
Mouth is juicy and slick with a dry finish. Not a thick heavy beer - refreshing and easy to drink.
Tremendously satisfying. Absolutley love it. I wish I could drink this year round. 594 characterssethmeister, Aug 24, 2013

Use by 9.13.13
bottled 8/9, enjoyed 8/23
Appearance- Lovely amber color. Nice, thick, lingering foamy head.
Smell- citrusy floral scent, pine undertones, strong grapefruit when inhaled deeply, vaguely sweet in a pleasingly heavy way. Memory stirring, puts me in mind of summer and honeysuckle bushes.
Taste- Beautiful. Very dry with a strong hoppy tang, yet smooth. Somewhat tart but with a slight sweetness, like a hint of honey with citrus. Alcohol is noticeable, but not in an unpleasant way. Nicely balanced.
Mouthfeel- Full bodied, but not too dense. Fills your mouth and washes pleasantly over the tongue, leaving a nice lingering tingle. 
Overall- Love it. This is an amazing taste that hits all my happy places for an IPA. SOOO glad I was able to get my hands on these. Definitely worth the hype. Wish I had been able to get more than two! 910 characterswr3ck00n, Aug 24, 2013
4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25got the 9/13 brew.... solid attack on the senses. 
brilliant neon gold glow. minor amounts of foam. laces admirably.
smells... like a hop festival.... did I mention I took their tour last night? super hot chick with red hair and a forward personality manning the mic....
strong floral taste. strong hop. hides the 9.4% well. not as fresh as the Pliny i'm drinking, and I like the Pliny a little better. it's more balanced. but if you're a hops guy, this is for you. it's got its place, I imagine. I do not prefer hop-heavy brews, but more of the balanced stuff, ya know? but it is good. I've come a long way in my assessment of hop-heavy brews....
I give the taste a 4.5 for its accomplishment of the hops domination. overall, however, it's an 85 in my book as I don't see the need to attack the sense with such hop-domination. I respect the intent, and the design, and for that it's "worthy" as the label says.
update: the 2.14.14 seems to be a different brew with different hops. more tangy and juicy with fruit flavors. a bit thinner, too, it seems, but it's an even better brew. is it my imagination? 1,104 characterspkalix, Aug 24, 2013

Pouring a clear gold with a dense white head with nice retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose is a big blast of pungent hops, pine, grapefruit and a minty herbal note being most dominant. Dank and resinous, You can tell that this beer is brashly hoppy. Alcohol is noticeable too. 
The palate is quite bitter, with a blend of dank weed, pine resin and grapefruit pith lending plenty of bitterness. Alcohol is noticeable, emphasizing the brashness of the pungent hops. Faintly soapy as well. A little sweetness is present, mildly sugary with a burnt sugar effect(especially in conjunction with the hop bitterness). medium light in body, this beer is moderately carbonated and has a long, pungent finish that's a touch soapy. This is more of a bitter , dank west coast dipa than the more recent hugely aromatic dipas that are all the rage. Recommended. 952 charactersDefenCorps, Aug 23, 2013

S - Detected grapefruit and tropical fruit hints.
T - Citrus/apricot hints followed by bready bitterness, lasting long after finished drinking. Unfortunately, feel that beer is missing something... lacks complexity of flavors I was looking for.
M -Clean/crisp. Nice tingle on the tongue.
O - Disappointed on first attempt. Usually a big fan of Stone products, so I gave it another try. Had a better impression the 2nd time around, but still to do not believe this beer lives up to the hype. 721 charactersDuane_Opfer, Aug 23, 2013

S - Pine, citrus, and something very unique most likely from the Nelson Sauvin hops I know they used to dry hop this. This is probably the best beer I have smelled. 
T - It has all the hop taste you would expect from Stone and doesn't taste anywhere near 9.4%, but it doesn't match up to the smell. I homebrew and I've used Nelson Sauvin. When I first smelled it I thought it was going to be the best hop ever, but I personally like the taste of Citra and Centennial better. In fact, I just had to drop the taste rating down a little (9-4-13) because that Nelson Sauvin aftertaste comes out even more when it isn't dead fresh, no wonder they put it right on the label to enjoy by a month after bottling. At this point, I'd probably rather have a Ruination. 
M - Smooth and dry, almost too dry, and I like dry beers. Again, I can't believe this is a 9.4% beer.
O - This is the big dog and of course I'm drinking the 09.09.13 iteration as I write this review. 1,151 charactersianmatth, Aug 22, 2013

Appearance: 2 fingers of tight, off white head from a gentle pour. Nice honey colored body and lacing. 
Smell: A wonderful waterfall of hop cones. Green pine needles, floral citrus, pineapple and orange peel (like smelling a lemon or an orange before you eat it). Also a bit of green grass in the end. It's like smelling a handful of hop cones. A bit of sweet booze pops up. 
Taste: Bright citrus fruits. Lemon zest and orange peel. A bitter pinyness and some grass. A sweet, sturdy malt backbone. Some biscuity malt. Finishes with a bitter herbalness. You can feel the ABV but it's not offensive. 
Mouthfeel: Lower carbonation with a medium to full mouthfeel. A substantial beer though one I feel like taking gulps of. Very warming and sweet.
Overall: I just love the nose on this! Worth it just for that. The ABV is never too much and just comes off as sweet and mingles with the malt. Worth the $8 or so dollars. Stone just keeps bringing out the fun beers and I am so glad they're now in KS. One worthy of the hype!

Marmalade with an eggshell covered head that dissipates into a ring of foam around the edges. Spotty lacing, clear body, and decent sized large bubbles.
Peaches and tangerines are the first thing that hit your nose. It's not really jumping out of glass at me, I have to get within about 4 inches to smell much of anything. Kind of disappointed about that, I remember the aromatics on the last batch I had being much better. But it certainly does smell nice when I can smell it.
The taste is where it really shines. Opens with lots of citrus and fruit. Tangerines, peaches, passion fruit, with a slight bit of dank pine and earhtyness on the finish. Up there with any other World class IPA in terms of flavor. 
Light-medium bodied with a drying finish. A little bit sticky on the lips, and you can definitely feel the carbonation on your tongue as it eases into your mouth. 
Great West coast style flavor with an emphasis on pitted fruit and zesty citrus. I honestly remember the previous batches of this jumping out of the glass at me more but it certainly doesn't smell bad when I can smell it. Still an outstanding IPA though. 1,176 charactersauroracrisis, Aug 22, 2013

The 10th batch of this beer, and the first I've managed to get my hands on. Stone Enjoy By 09.13.13, a more than obvious vintage date. I've been sitting on this bottle for about a week now, so I don't see the need to wait any longer! Exponentially stoked to have gotten this.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter glass.
A - Pours a bronze-orange-gold colored body with just over a finger of bubbly off-white head that settles down to suds pretty quick. Second pour yields a good two fingers of creamy doughy off-white froth. Impressive clarity.
S - Nose is actually quite tame compared to what I was expecting. Some fresh cut grapefruit, apricot, blood orange, some soapiness, and a buttered biscuit malt backbone. Alcohol is barely detectable for being such a high abv beer. Smells pretty 'ordinary', but spot on.
T - Taste brings more of the same. Extremely well-balanced, and not the ridiculous hop bomb one might normally expect from Stone. The bready malts pair well with the fresh grapefruit hops.
M - Feel is extremely smooth, creamy, and clean. This is clearly a fresh beer, and even the mouthfeel reflects that fact. Dry bitter hop resins clinging to the palate. I feel like this would pair well with some cheese, and I wish I had some.
Overall, I was initially sort of let down by the 'tame' nature of this beer by Stone's standards, but this is remarkably smooth, creamy, well-balanced, and drinkable for having such a high 9.40% abv, and that is most likely due to the freshness factor. Call it a gimmick if you want, this is the pinnacle of fresh imperial IPA's.
Stone Enjoy By 09.13.13 IPA ---4/5. 1,683 charactersmfnmbvp, Aug 22, 2013

Golden clear pour with good carbonation. 
Smells are salty spicy dank hops. Damnit, I need to start homebrewing if this is what fresh hops can smell like in the glass. Love it. I don't know if Nelson Sauvin is here, but it sure smells like it.
T: Thankfully, follows the nose. Salty and earthy hops coat the tongue, spicy vibe too. Continues that N. Sauvin theme. A bit of garlic/onion, but in the back and it works with the other flavors. some typical pine/citrus as well. 
M: Pretty clean overall. If this could be resined-up and and stickified I would be even happier.
O: Top shelf. Will be buying again. Hit me in all the right spots. 695 characterscaskstrength, Aug 22, 2013

O: 4.5 this brew does not disappoint. Very happy to find it on draft, hope these keep coming out in Indiana! 336 charactersroger617, Aug 20, 2013

S- It has a nice balance of pine and citrus aromas&gt; Smells clean.
T- For a taste it has a wonderful full flavor of hops to begin, then it follows with a clean finish just as the nose does. The bitterness lingers for a moment and then leaves your palate begging for more.
M-The mouthfeel is slightly full bodied but the finish cleans it all up. Carbonation is low but still apparent. One of the best balanced IIPAs I can remember.
O- Overall I love this IPA. I could drink this baby a hundred times before it expires. Good fucking job. 600 charactersBeerAficionadoMCMXC, Aug 20, 2013

This version (4.20.16) is definitely better than the last version I had (less dank and piney), and clearly shares the same hops as the Unfiltered version. However, where Unfiltered was a bright hazy orange, this is a clear gold. Unfiltered also has a much more juicy and full taste.
This stuff is excellent, but no comparison to the Unfiltered version. I respectfully disagree with those that say the two beers are practically the same; they share the same complements, but clearly leaving the beer unfiltered amps the deliciousness up quite a bit. 716 charactersSeanBond, Aug 19, 2013

A - Amazingly clear golden honey orange with a nice frothy white head. Spectacular.
S - Super fresh hop smell. Filled with pine, citrus and a very mild onion / garlic undertone that makes it just smell super dank and complex.
T - An immediate dominant hop flavor hits the tongue with mostly tropical fruits but with pine and onion more apparent on the finish. No alcohol taste whatsoever.
M - Medium bodied thickness that really coats your mouth. Carbonation and body feels just right on this one!
O - My favorite Stone offering and one of my favorites overall. Such a classic Stone west coast hopped beer that stands high and above most others out there. 689 charactersDemoniChris, Aug 18, 2013

4.35/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Pours up a copious amount of head which has pretty good retention. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale amber which glows a little bit lighter when held up to the light. Some lacing left behind.
Nose- Very warm and inviting. The most dominant note that I get is peach and more peach. There is some orange and citrus as well. Some melon and tropical fruit. 
Taste- The flavor profile begins with citrus which is followed by lots of peach, melon, and tropical fruit. Obviously very reflective of the head. Ends with a nice finish of pine and resin and the kind of spiciness you tend to get from really fresh hops. Solid, very good imperial. There is a dollop of honey and caramel on the finish. This seems a little odd to me as most IIPAs that I've had show their malt notes in the middle. There are nectar and floral notes as well. I don't detect any heat at all. The beer has incredible balance and integration. It has a good amount of juiciness which has become standard for IIPAs these days. 
Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with a little bit of syrup. Good amount of carbonation. 
Drinkability- Very well rounded for an IIPA. Very easy drinking. And the price point of 7 bucks a bomber is pretty much unbeatable for a quality beer of this style. No heat at all.
Overall- Very good beer, solid IIPA. Very fresh and definitely worth a try. 1,377 charactersartoolemomo, Aug 18, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.759/13/13 version. Pours a translucent, golden orange color with a finger length head that dissipates somewhat quickly and leaves a sticky lacing. Aroma is amazing. Tons of of overly ripe pineapple, some grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach, more tropical fruit notes, pine, tiny bit of breadiness and sweetness from the malts. Taste starts with some bitterness, but more tropical and citrus fruits like pineapple, papaya, grapefruit, mangos, some floral qualities as well. Was already smooth on the front end, but then gets even smoother and creamier in the middle from the malts that somewhat balance it. Then finishes dry with more tropical and citrus fruits, as well as some pine qualities. Very smooth and crisp finish that cleans the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Has a slight sweetness throughout, which complements the hop characters and gives the hop flavors almost a gummy bear-like taste. High medium, oily body. No alcohol detected at all. From what I read, this beer is made with mostly flavoring hops and not many bittering hops. I agree with this, as there are just massive amounts of juicy fruits in this. Better than Ruination in my opinion. Well done! 1,188 charactersbrewskis, Aug 18, 2013

Poured from a 22oz bottle on 11.19.13
A: Perfectly transparent, a beautiful golden color with a very thin white head. Parts of the head dissipated leaving a cool foamy pattern.
S: Big lemon and grapefruit right off the bat. This one smells pretty dank.
T: To anyone who's ever opened a bag of hops and stuck your nose in it - this is pretty much it. It doesn't smell like the things that hops smell like... it smells like hops. Amazing citrus, floral and grass flavors with a moderate bitterness and a great sweet malt backbone to support it. Its got a dankness to it. Usually beers that I would describe as dank are too much (I'm thinking about Hop Stoopid here), but the balance here is phenomenal.
M: Crisp with just a slight resinous quality. Medium carb.
O: I always get so excited for this to hit my state and for a good reason. It never lets down. This IPA is fresh as hell but freshness wouldn't mean a thing if it wasn't an unbelievable IPA to begin with. Pretty far up on my list! 1,014 charactersanteater, Aug 17, 2013

A – Fantastic light golden color like real gold with some dark straw. Very clear and translucent. Almost seems to have a tiny green hue, but that’s probably my brain smelling fresh hops. Head was good and off-white, but subsided too quickly.
S – Wow, just fantastic. Pine and grass, with citrus. I can pick out orange, some lemon zest, and mango. There’s also some light neutral smell almost like coconut.
T – Very flavorful, matching the smell well. Not too bitter either, just great. The taste lingers through the swallow and doesn’t dissipate too much. The aftertaste is very tasteful, not just a bitter piney mess like some other D/IPAs. Mellow pine, grass, and citrus (mainly orange) upfront. These hop flavors rest on a strong yet subtle malt backbone that imparts just a tiny woody flavor.
M – Very smooth, actually undercarbonated. Light-medium body, not cozy. A little fuzzy which is good because it’d be too smooth and velvety otherwise. A very not dry finish.
D – A damn fine beer, but the undercarbonation is unfortunate. Supremely balanced and hits great hop notes in smell and taste. However, I can’t say it’s a league above Racer 5 [though the numbers suggest that]. It does have clarity in smell and flavor setting it apart though. And a beer I’m just trying that inspires me to review is very uncommon. It holds its flavor as it warms too so you know it was masterfully done.

Bottled 9/201/13, best by 10/25/13, bought 10/3/13
A – Extremely clear and translucent. A nice gold, tinged with yellow from my lighting I think. Thin but complete head, probably my glasses fault.
S – A nice hoppy aroma greets me, but a slightly buttery and burnt smell follows behind it. Very planty, as in grass, cut flower stems, a bit of pine. Peach and a musty citrus, probably from earthy hops. Slight butter detracts though. When I pick up the burnt smell, the dankness also picks up, as if someone put some half used skunk in the brew. Overall, it’s pretty muddled but still something I like about it.
T – A pretty planty, not very fruity taste. Some bitterness but actually a bit sweet. Maybe the OG was too high. Finishes sweet with a lingering of planty fruit. Not what I’m looking for in a Stone DIPA.
M – Undercarbonated. Feels almost heavy-bodied and it’s kind of silky. Finish is pretty wet. It feels properly carbonated just on the tip of the tongue for a second. At least it’s not harsh feeling.
O – Not nearly as good as 07.04.13. It’s not 1-dimenisonal in taste, but it’s not very well-made either. Mouthfeel is pretty disappointing. I was really looking forward to this beer, and want to like it, but it’s pretty meh. The appearance was pretty cool though.

4.55/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle, Enjoy By 09.13.13. Poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours an orange/copper color. About one finger of a light khaki head that hangs around fairly well and sticks to the glass as it recedes. Carbonation bubbles steadily and slowly rise to the top. Hazy, opaque appearance. Very good looking IIPA.
Smell: Massive, fresh hop aromas just bursting out of the glass. Lots of citrus characteristics (grapefruit and orange rind, lemon/lime), very dank hop aromas, some subtle pine notes, a little bit of an earthy onion/garlic quality. A bit of sweet breadiness as well. Picking up some sweeter and tropical fruits also (pineapple, peach, strawberry). Just an excellent, fresh smelling beer.
Taste: Strong bitterness at the front of the tongue which takes on a strong citrus, grapefruit flavor. This morphs into some of the sweeter fruit (pineapple, peach, apricot, a bit of strawberry) tastes and malty breadiness. Finishes with some more bitterness as the flavors become more earthy, more of the pine, onion/garlic tastes come out on the back of the tongue.
Mouthfeel: Great feel to this one. Medium, resinous body to this one, almost an oily consistency rolls smoothly through the mouth and over the tongue. Leaves a tingly sensation over the tongue as it finishes dry, making you want to wring the hop flavors out of your tongue.
Overall: The Enjoy By concept is a very appealing idea as super fresh IPAs aren't always easy to find, but this does make them available for a known, limited time (depending on the markets to which its distributed). However when it does make its way around, it's quite easy to find and priced about reasonably at around $6.99 per bottle (in this area at least). This beer is really quite a treat and highly recommended to try. 1,778 charactershermit990, Aug 17, 2013

I've had a few vintages from this series in the past. 22oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a beautiful transparent golden with a slight haze, fluffy eggshell white head that sticks around and leaves great rentention and lacing. The aromas are great and full of sticky mango, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, lime zest. It's extremely tropical. There's some pine needles in the mix as well. The flavors are wonderful, but not aggressively bitter. There's a subtle amount of malts that give this one a decent sweetness. There's a little bit of pine in the finish. Mouthfeel is nice. It's on the lighter side of full-bodied; moderate carbonation. Alcohol goes completely unnoticed and this is extremely easy to drink.
Ultimately, the flavors and aromas remind me alot of the stellar IPA/DIPAs out there. There's not much to complain about. This is a very enjoyable DIPA. 907 charactersBB1313, Aug 16, 2013

A: Light brassy orange. Transparent. One finger khaki head. Retention is decent for the high abv's. Lacing is stellar. 
S: Boom. Drinking a three day old IPA does something for the nose, that's for sure. Huge burst of tropical sweetness coming from the nose. Pineapple, mango. Bit of that weird onion/garlic scent. (New to me, but since it was pointed out I've been noticing it more). Level of dankness. Grapefruit pith. Sweet breadiness off the malt. Touch prickly in the sinus cavity. Fairly complex, but insanely powerful aromatics. 
T: Bready sweetness up front. Transitions into the same tropical fruitiness mid palate. Combine this with a large rush of Ruby Red grapefruit and orange. Back is prickly pepper notes, with shots of pear skin and apple. Aftertaste is fairly resinous bitterness, with notes of spearmint and spruce needle. Alcohol warmth comes through in the finish, kicking up the spicy/peppery notes for one last hoorah in the aftertaste. 
M: A tad slick from the alcohol. Medium bodied, with a subdued carbonation that allows the incredibly powerful flavors to really coat the tongue. 
O: It's greater than the sum of its parts, really. Glad I picked it up again and I will continue to pick it up when it's available. Superb beer. 1,420 charactersMcStagger, Aug 16, 2013

Bought at Stone Brewing in a 2 liter growler. Pours a clear golden color with white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Aroma is tropical fruit, citrus, and a bit of pine. Taste follows the nose for the most part with an intense bite at the end. The bitterness is covered up well by the flavor. Mouthfeel is near perfect. Just the right amount of carbonation and light and crisp. This is definitely one of my favorite brews, and one of the best Stone makes.
4/20/14
A lot more citrusy and bitter than I remember. A tiny bit of caramelized onions in the nose as well and even less in taste. The alcohol is covered up unbelievably well and there's almost no sweetness from the malts which is pretty rare in a DIPA.
10/31/14
I don't know if my palate has evolved, but I'm getting a way cleaner bitterness with a lot more mango than before. Not as citrusy as I remember. Very dank. Piney. Very juicy. 915 charactersMisSigsFan, Aug 15, 2013

4.95/5  rDev +12.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Based on the 08.02.13 batch. Poured a gorgeous clear amber, with a half finger white head. It looks fantastic poured into a tulip. Scents of pine, citrus, especially grapefruit, pineapple, slight tropical fruit and a bit of malt. The scent is fantastic and entices you to drink. Each sniff made me want to take the first sip more and more. Flavor begins with a burst of bitter citrus and grapefruit pith moving into a blend of grapefruit and bitter pine and finishing with a nice resiny pine flavor and aftertaste. A hint of malt sweetness in the middle blends wonderfully with the hop flavors and a noticeable alcohol presence hits at the end. An amazing double IPA flavor profile, comparing favorably with the best of the others of it's style I've tasted. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's standard, but not bad. A sublime double IPA. Full of hop flavor, with an extreme bitterness and citrus flavors. It slams your palette with it's assertive flavor and doesn't relent. Well worth getting, a fantastic beer and a great showing from Stone. 1,066 charactersAuraan, Jul 31, 2013

It was a nice aroma and an excellent hoppy taste. The only bad thing about this beer is its avalibility. Unless you live on the left coast its gonna be hard to get some here in mass, but if you are fortunite to get your hands on it enjoy every ounce of this wonderfull beer. 393 charactersJohnnysBarIsIt, Jul 28, 2013

T- the big passionfruit note is still there though a bit overwhelmed by some of the bitter citrus components of the hop profile, rush of grapefruit, tangerine, mango, very bright. no sign of the abv

Juicy citrus apricot hop greatness. Inviting pine and resin. This smells fresh and fantastic. 
Tastes dank and and delicious. More oily pine than fruit in the taste, unlike the initial aroma of this brew. And with a spicy bitterness leading up to the finish, in a lemon-like way. Finishes more abruptly dry. 
Smooth and prickly. 
Highly enjoyed. Highly recommended. 562 charactersTBoneJones, Jul 27, 2013

In that case, I've had a taste from an amazing batch, because this was as exceptional as an IPA gets. The nose was fruity, floral, not too herbal or piney; I won't bore anyone with talk of lacing or head retention, lets cut right to the flavor. Oh my god. The marriage of fruity and citrusy hops is mind blowingly delicious and so different from the herbal, piney IPAs that Stone is known for. If you are a fan of IPAs, you must try this and see for yourself. I dream about this beer at night and think about it when I'm thirsty. I'm hooked! 604 charactersAaron_Ramson, Jul 25, 2013

Amazing how they've dry-hopped the SHI@#$ out of this beer to give this the nose of a handful of fresh picked hops! But, this beer stays away from most of the bitter hop aromas and is overall extremely floral, hoppy but easy and drinkable.
a - golden color in the glass
s - the MOST aromatic beer you will ever smell, which is whole point of this beer. Total floral (citra) hop aroma on the nose. Like you walked into a field of blooming, springtime hops. FUCK@#$ unreal.
t - good medium body and easily drinkable. clean finish with a nice crisp floral hops on the tongue, surprisingly void of any bittering hopes.
m - med body, easy.
o - 10/10. buy as many as you can while you can get it. 757 charactersEQueezy, Jul 24, 2013

Enjoyed on: 07/08/2013
The beer pours a dark amber color with a few centimeters of nice foam. Super fresh hops emerge from the aroma: pine, orange, and grapefruit. Alcohol clears the sinuses along with a wee bit of caramel in the background. Medium bodied and smooth, almost creamy, but for the carbonation Lots of hops in the flavor, as expected. Piney resin and citrus both contribute, but pine is the biggest contributor. A hint of malt brings it all together. Very enjoyable. 520 charactersBeardedBoffin, Jul 14, 2013

Good retention and lacing. Pale golden color and crystal clear. Aroma is wonderfully hoppy. Crisp, pungent, and fresh hops. Mango, citrus rind, tropical fruits, pine, and notes of grass. The taste is much the same with plenty of tropical fruits/mango, big citrus kick, pine, loads of bitterness, grassy notes, with a light malt backing that adds just a nice rounding to the barrage of hops. The mouthfeel is great. Not too full at all. Moderate carbonation works well to keep it lighter feeling, light-medium and filmy consistency, medium body, and a nice and bitter crisp finish.
Overall another REALLY great IPA from Stone. They have not disappointed me yet, and I was even more thrilled with this IPA than I expected to be. Just fantastic. I will certainly be getting another few of this batch and will get any subsequent batches that are released in my distribution network. Fantastic idea with the series and done completely right! 1,029 charactersmatttttYCE, Jul 11, 2013

A nice hop bitterness and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dryer fresh pine hop like aftertaste. Big and fresh hops, the only flaw, it is almost too fresh, but really nice. 395 charactersOWSLEY069, Jul 10, 2013

A very clear. Nice head and lacing
S really nice balance of citrus and pine. Nice smelling beer
T just as it smells. Starts out citrus with the pine shinning thru as it warms. Not a lot of hop bitterness on this one.
M excellent. Moderate carbonation and a nice malt backbone. Very drinkable.
O very good beer. Never been a big fan of stone but enjoy by is a great concept executed perfectly. A very well balanced beer which any ipa fan would enjoy. 470 charactersDrewskiWhit, Jul 04, 2013

A one finger white head sits atop an illuminescent, clear golden amber body. Looks like any other great DIPA.
It smells like sweet, freshly peeled grapefruit and oranges! A really intoxicating and irresistable citric scent. There be hops here as well.
The orange comes through big-time in the taste, This is followed by juicy, delicious hops, and finished up with a truly splendid, resiny pine bitterness. No alcohol at ALL. Incredible!
The mouthfeel is like a dream... so unintrusive, and perfectly carbonated for full enjoyment of all the flavors.
This is an OUTSTANDING DIPA. And I'd bet that it would stay this outstanding for at least a good month after the printed "Enjoy By" date. After all, I'm drinkin' this one only about a week or so before that date, and it's still FANTASTICALLY POTENT, both in the nose and on the tongue. 977 charactersKuaff, Jun 29, 2013

3.55/5  rDev -19.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4I understand there is a huge demand right now for Double IPA hop assault beers. And Stone’s masterful play to this demand with the Enjoy By series has to be appreciated. They are not just playing to the market, they are also making multiple crazy hop balanced, big IPAs, that make your palate ride that sharp toothy edge of huge IBUs without drawing blood. If you know how to brew, you know it’s not easy to do.
Appearance 3.5: Slightly warm, glowing, golden color. Medium, white, lasting head. Laces well. 
Aroma 3.5: Hop characters come across as pine tips, eucalyptus blossom, chamomile, and dank musky sage. A little wet alfalfa. No malt characters to speak of. 
Taste 3.5: Aggressive peppery pine bittering. Most of the citrus peel and floral aromas are from the hop aromas invading the taste space. Malt provides a blank canvas only, carries no character to speak of. 
Mouthfeel 3.0: Medium light body. Hop oil slippery to start – turns fast to astringent and bitter/dry. Alcohol heat and astringent hop bitterness finish in the mouth and throat. Somewhat medicinal. 
Overall impression 4.0: This is a liquid delivery system for hop bitterness, astringency, and flavor. It stands back on balance in delivering fresh hop aroma. Other than to provide a carriage for hop characters, the malt and yeast profiles are nonexistent. I rate the overall higher for the novelty of a clean, dry, and very Stone execution of a hop assault. It reminds me of Pliny the Younger – where PTY is a laser beam focused hop weapon, this Enjoy By is a polished hop boulder to the palate. Another well done hop monster from Stone. 
I get it, it’s a fun ride – but still, I’m a balance and nuance guy.

I guess they're not going to tell us what hops they use, but this is the weirdest, fruitiest hop smash-up. It's sort of a spoiled fruit flavor, like really ripe mangos going black and that pineapple you forgot about. Plenty piney as well. Fortunately the bitterness is remarkably restrained, so this is kinid of a unique hop overdose without the usual tongue-pickling. A little sweet, which I'm grateful for.
Add the ridiculous alcohol and you have an experience you have to try to believe. From the 22 oz bottle bought at Liticker's in Ocean Beach. At nine bucks it's pricier than virtually every other Stone brew, but what tha zzz. 810 charactersmactrail, Jun 23, 2013

A - Looks like a great IPA, active carbonation streams occasionally bubble through a mass of deep gold, opaque liquid. Head comes to a couple fingers of white, thick foam that retains well and leaves beautiful lacing. Looks delicious.
S - Wow. You can smell hops, definitely citrus and pine notes, with a zesty bitterness reminiscent of fresh lemons. Smells unbelievable, I kinda just wanna sit here and inhale the aroma over and over.
T - Sweet mama, that is a hop bomb if I've ever heard of one! And I thought Ruination and Hop Stoopid had the market cornered on bitter... Well this one embraces the bitterness of the hops while leaving some breathing room for plenty of that citrus zest and sweet background. Balanced is not the right word for this. However, if you're looking for a hop bomb from hell, grab one of these!
M - Goes down smooth, hits the mouth with lively carbonation and a nice thickness that doesn't overwhelm. Feels like an easy drinker, once you're adjusted to the hop explosion.
If you're not a fan of hops, you might go ahead and try it anyway. It could very well convert you. Or kill you, whichever. 1,201 charactersBigBarley, Jun 20, 2013

Perfect Pilsner-like color* For those who would argue that it should be more appropriately copper colored... *The first officially designated American craft brewed IPA was Grant’s, and it contained Pilsener malts of this golden hue. The nose is an exquisite melange of grapefruit, Mandarin orange, tangerine, pinapple, mango, kiwi, and lemon/lime. The flavors follow suit, and the body is medium to full with just the right amount of malt backbone which is more of a textural thing, in this case, than a flavor enhancer. The hops are given free reign to truly shine here. The balance is nearly flawless, right through the long, dry finish which is crisp, and remarkably refreshing.

Scent is immediately floral, but quickly fades to DANK hops. I can't help but be reminded of the hoppy beers from Alpine when I smell this special offering from Stone. The hop scent on this is just so damn inviting, it's ridiculous. Sweet, but not malty...it's a sweet, hoppy resin aroma. Some pine and a ton of citrus fruit with a hint of pineapple and mango. Taste is just as it smells. It is so hard to explain this beer, because it is so delicious and everything an imperial IPA should be. So fresh and so clean...as Outkast would say. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied. Drinkability is VERY high! This is a top notch IPA that reminds me of the quality that Alpine produces. Definitely my favorite hoppy Stone beer. 821 charactersDovaliHops, Jun 15, 2013

I'm really in the midst of a New Zealand hops phase, and this tastes strongly of Nelson or similiar hops.
A: 4.50 clear attractive light amber color (I hate this catagory. If it smelled and tasted great, Id' drink it if it looked like split pea soup)
S: 4.75 I LOVE that grapefruit/pineapple acidic aroma that screams 'NEW ZEALAND"
T: 4.75 Again, this groves perfectly with my current passion for an over-the-top citrus flavor thats amazingly thirst quenching.
M: 4.50 very nice. smooth and bready in it's maltiness, which is cut so well by the acid taste from all the hops
Overall-Excellent example of the type. For me, this would be a constant in my fridge if it was always available. Great alone, but stands up very well to strong food flavors. Seems to hold it's carbonation better than most others of the style. I had a pint sit for a couple of hours and still taste great, where others seem to go flat very quickly. Now I need to find out if Stone has it on Nitro at their tasting room... 1,214 charactersSchnauzerlord, Jun 13, 2013

Bottled on 5-31-13
Consumed on 6-8-13
A- Clean looking copper with a 2 finger off white head that is thick as can be. Lacing does a nice job of holding strong, and the retention is persistent as hell. A little light in color for a DIPA, but all of the characteristics are here for an impressive beer.
S- Oh my! Massive hop aroma. Not sure of the IBUs, but the hop profile is divine. Dank (I mean DANK!) hops of citrus, pine and slight floral. You don't have to work hard at all to find this aroma. Explodes out of the glass. It is like walking through an orchard of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, peaches, lemons and abundant pine trees.
T- Follows nose. Once again, superb hop characteristics take over the palate early on and linger throughout. It runs the hop gauntlet - dank, wet, powder coated and resinous all in waves. A sweet caramel malt base shows up with perfect timing to ensure this doesn't become an astringent experience. Some earthy tones also make their way. Bitter bite in the finish.
M- Dry, oh so dry. Mouth can't wait to get another sip. Creamy to a degree for the style, yet lighter than many. Alcohol present with some warmth. Perfect carbonation.
O- So pleased to see this distribute to MO as soon as I moved here. Certainly one of my favorites from Stone. Won't compare to others as this one speaks for itself. I'll say this though, not many beers excite me so much that I go back to the store the very next day to stock up on some more. I did with this one.

Appearance: Pours a warm, clear golden honey color. Ample carbonation is apparent. About 1.5" of eggshell white head forms, which has great retention and lacing. Very good looking IPA. 
Smell: Extremely dank on the nose. Bitter grapefruit and some pineapple and mango notes. Very fresh and clean hop smells. Some bready and caramel malt notes peek out as well, but the hops really shine.
Taste: Bready malts do show themselves initially, as well as perhaps a bit of caramel. The remainder is very sticky, and very dank hop flavors. Citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and sticky hop resins are apparent. Overall, the beer is fairly sweet which is not surprising for a 9.4% ABV beer. However, the finish is pretty dry, which is a nice quality.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, with ample carbonation. Very nice. Overall, I thought this was an outstanding IPA. The hop character is very resinous and very pronounced, but all in all the beer has a nice balance. Super. 1,008 characterszhanson88, Jun 12, 2013

A: Amberish/golden hue with a stead head and good lacing
S: Grapefruit, weed, pineapple--so fresh with somewhat of a bready backbone; but mostly lots of hop resin aromas dominating
T: So bitter and resiny: oily, piney, dank, grapefruity--it is so bitter and I wish there was a little more sweetness underneath
F: So sticky and oily and awesome
O: This is a bitter, in your face beer--I like it--but I wish it had a bit more of a malty sweetness underneath; but like I said, it is still a darn good beer 548 charactersdbossman, Jun 11, 2013

Golden with a loose soapy white foam sheet. Smells nice: mango, pineapple, resin, biscuit, dextrose, bit of mint. Bitter, sweet, sugar sweetness, some onion, some body odor, some grapefruit. Medium bodied with moderately sharp carb and an off dry finish. This was better the first time I tried it, but I feel there are a couple characteristics here I'm growing tired of: onion and body odor in the IPAs - seems to be a palate trend for me lately unfortunately. 478 charactersharrymel, Jun 11, 2013
4.86/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Best IPA I've had to date. Had it as a sampling at a beer distributor by me. Picked up a few singles of other beers, left, drove halfway home and turned around. Picked up a Growler.
Batch: Enjoy by 5/17/13
Consumed on 5/15/13
At first sip it was surprisingly good.... good hop punch, balance and a crisp tongue snapping finish.... the thing that really got me is how drinkable it was and how on my ride home I just couldn't get that goodness it left out of my mouth... it's the type that you wanna continue drinking... a big standout to me was how ridiculously fresh it tasted. I definitely recommend anyone to try this... even if your not an IPA fan... you may just turn around to like it after all.
Edit: I have had severall bottled versions and on draft afterwards. Some bottled versions I did taste the onion-y hop to it. None were better than the 5/17/13 version.

4.81/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer was amazing. It had a really fresh grapefruit aroma that exploded out of the glass. I was amazed at the tasty freshness. I can't really put into words the actual taste of freshness, but it was such a clean IPA. The malt backed up the massive hops pretty well, although lets be honest with ourselves, this IPA is not so much about the malt. I would love to get my hands on more of this stuff. If I were to compare to Pliny, I would say they are actually quite similar, but more grapefruit on the Enjoy By and more tropical flavors in Pliny. Enjoy by July 4th is truly a great beer. 590 charactersbrenty0man, Jun 10, 2013

It has a massive hop smell that hits you right in the face and does not let up one bit in the mouth. This tastes like liquid heaven for a fan of hops. The alcohol is very present, but that is no reason to apologize. This beer is not for the weak of mouth. The appearance is also amazing. This is probably the best looking beer I have ever seen in my glass. Get some! 497 charactersILoveIPA, Jun 10, 2013

4.03/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Light pour, some foam. Clear, darker yellow. Doesn't look bad nor does it look all that great.
Great aroma. Pine, grapefruit and some unidentifiable fruits, backed up by some hidden malts. 
The taste was a little disappointing compared to the smell. I didn't get much of the pine, really just citrus and some subtle malt flavors. Tasted sort of one note, although it was a great note.
Good light body with medium carbonation. Appropriate for the style and weather, which is warming now. Could stand to be more refreshing.
A great IPA but not quite as complex as I'd like. However, you can't really go wrong with a 9.4% abv beer that is this drinkable and delicious. While I prefer most of Alpine's IPAs, Sculpin, Yulesmith Summer, and even Stone's own Ruination to this, the availability of Enjoy By makes it a strong choice. 829 charactersChizoad, Jun 08, 2013

Poured into a Sam Adams 'perfect pint' glass.
AP: Light golden colour with a 3/4" white head that dissipates down to a dusting across the surface. Some lacing on the sides when the glass is tilted. A little transparent looking.
AR: Nice aroma. Hoppy goodness in a glass going on here. It's like someone dropped some pine and spruce sprigs in my glass. Dank, resiny pine. There's fruits in there as well like grapefruit, orange, tangerine, mango, papaya, guava. Crackery malt aromas pushed to the background.
T: The pine that was in the aroma isn't nearly as strong in the taste. The taste is more about the rinds/skin of grapefruit, orange and tangerine. The fruit tastes are rather juicy and lush on the palate, which is how I prefer my IPAs. Malts add cracker and grains to the taste. The tropical aromas are also a bit muted in the taste. It's still very good, but the nose misled me raised my expectations of flavour.
M: Crisp on the tongue with good carbonation. Light body for a DIPA. It's like it tried to finish dry but the juicy fruit of the hops sticks to your palate to leave it a bit moist.
OV: A very solid offering from Stone. Don't know if my opening this 21 days past the 'enjoy by' date had any effect on the quality of the beer. The tastes that were there were quality, but I was expecting a bit more from the aromas this gave off. And the body was lighter than I prefer. 1,457 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Jun 08, 2013
4.54/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy By 02.14.14
A: Super clear light golden-amber appearance. Poured into a frozen glass with 3/4 finger of off-white head, small sized bubbles. Bubbles dissipated down to a thin film around the edge of the glass pretty quickly, which could be due to the temperature of the glass. Bubbles left just a trace of lacing on the cold glass.
S: I'm a bit stuffed up today, but I can detect hints of floral and some danky hops. This is about the best I can do with one functional nostril.
T: Lots of good stuff here. Less sweetness on the start compared to other Enjoy Bys. Subtle pine flavors, less hoppy than others. Tastes similar to the other Enjoy Bys, but more mellow (which is probably because I'm a little late to drink this one.) I found the other Enjoy Bys to be a little bit of a caricature of IPAs, so I appreciate the mellowness. 9.4% ABV, but it does have a mild alcohol dryness.
M: Medium+ body and tongue stickiness. A little bit oily, but not fatiguing. Carbonation is great, as always with Stone.
O: I'm a little late to drink this one, and consequently its a little bit mellower than the other Enjoy Bys. I think this is a good thing, but lovers of the other Enjoy Bys exaggerated style may find it a bit lacking.
Enjoy By 11.12.13
A: Very clear dark-straw/golden color that pours with a good finger/finger and a half of very small off-white head. Color and clarity is great here; I wish my homebrews looked anything like this. Good head retention in a chilled glass that left nice lacing.
S: Smells like an IPA. Sweet/floral start with nice hints of bready malts. No significant hops here.
T: Pretty close to its smell, but with a few more subtleties. Semi-sweet start (maybe dragon or stone fruit; can't really put my finger on it.) Less malty mid-taste than it smells, though the smell wasn't the strongest to begin with. It finishes with enough mild hop-bitterness to be a west coast IPA, but doesn't feel like a boxing match with your tongue. It's a bit softer than the usual Stone "over-the-top" style, but it makes for a great IPA. No taste of booze at 9.4% abv, which could be a little bit dangerous; the less exaggerated tastes means I could seeing drinking more than one of these.
M: Medium/medium- body, with a slightly quicker flow down the throat. Carbonation is great, as with all stone brews. Very appropriate for a single IPA.
O: A great all-around IPA brew; easy drinking and great tasting, just be a bit conscientious of the abv. Guaranteed to take you from sober to "life is fun" in no time flat :) (Funny to read my previous review; this is definitely not the same beer. No hints of pine at all in this, and a less exaggerated taste.)
Enjoy By 07.04.13
A: Pours extremely clear mid-to-dark amber color, with 2-2.5 fingers of fluffy eggshell white head of very small bubbles. The head retains decently before turning into a solid film of micro bubbles. Lacing is medium+.
S: VERY fresh piney hop smell. Maybe some minor notes of semi-sweet fruits (grapefruit, stone fruit) but it's dominated by its piney, resiny hops.
T: More balanced than it smells. It's a bit lighter taste all the way through. It starts with a sweet/sour grapefruit-like beginning, before moving on to a light, biscuity malt flavor. Piney hops are present through both the start and the malty flavors. It finishes with the mild/mild+ hop bitterness you'd expect from a DIPA. She packs a punch at 9.4% abv, though it does finish a bit dry and boozy.
M: Medium- to medium body for an DIPA. A good bit quicker and slicker than most DIPAs; it feels closer to an IPA. Carbonation is great; no complaints.
O: Tastes like Stone's interpretation of a by-the-book IPA (which means they said "let's make it a double.") Imagine that Stone had a Pliny the Elder recipe in their hands and said "let's do this, but let's do it our way." It is a very well balanced brew that doesn't rely on extreme hops to define itself. It's a little different for Stone, and I'm glad I had it. 3,985 charactersrringler, Jun 08, 2013

The aroma of fresh hops: strong on the pine. Wonderful.
The taste is big and bold bitterness: pine bitter, lemon bitter and a big malt bill to hold it all together.
The texture is smooth and crisper with moderate carbonation.
It's a top of the line beer. 332 charactersFatehunter, Jun 07, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Presentation: Awesome looking bottle with extremely eye-catching painted on graphics and font. Gives really nice back-story on the beer, web info, ABV info, bottled on date(4-12-13), states “Enjoy Now”, “Live For The Now, The Present”, “There Is No Better Time Than Right Now To Enjoy This Beer”. Awesome!
Appearance: Allowed to warm for 10min before pouring into a 16oz snifter from 22oz bomber. An aggressive pour lead to a very clear yellowish orange beer with a 2 finger tightly packed off white head of a medium density. Head retention was 4min 12sec before fading to a thick bubbly coating and ring. Excellent lacing. 
Smell/Aroma: Smells very fresh with a dominate citrus hop aroma. Hints of lemon, orange, and sweet grapefruit. Also has strong pine resin and grassy scent with slight hints of tropical fruit, maybe mango. 
Flavor/Taste: Taste is fresh and exceptional with hints of pine resin hops and a slight bready malt backbone that turns juicy with a lemon citrus hop flavor on the finish. 
MouthFeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied and slightly chewy with a perfect amount of carbonation. Extremely drinkable and tasty. 
Overall/Comments: FRESH!!! 05.17.13 version. For me Enjoy By is rivaled only by the fresh Stone IPA that I tasted while visiting Stone Brewing Company in 2011. The alcohol is undetectable in the nose and palette. Any IPA lover will be in heaven with Enjoy By. Classified as an American Double/Imperial IPA @ 9.4% ABV. Consumed 4/25/2013. 1,485 charactersthegodfather1076, May 28, 2013

4.5/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very clear, straw color, decent head. The smell is strong and nice. All hops, with a touch of that oniony smell/flavor. This one leans away from the citrus side and goes more for the dankness. Taste is good, just like the smell. They did a really nice job of infusing the hop flavors into this beer. The hops are strong, but the beer is by no means bitter. Mouthfeel was good. Well carbonated, a bit of body. All in all, it's a very solid DIPA with great hop flavor, even though it's not quite the hop profile I would have gone for. 540 charactersdougfur, May 25, 2013

a: clear honey-gold. some alcohol legs, almost no lacing. 
s: very sculpin-like. Honey and citrus sweetness, floral notes, and that strange, bitter, astringent, oniony smell. Very nice. 
t: Before you even get to fully taste the beer, bitterness comes in and hits you, with astringent, floral hops rolling across your tongue. finishes a little hot.
mf: medium, almost on the sticky side like RuinTen. Alcohol does come through a little bit. 
overall: definitely worth trying, or grabbing a few bottles. Isn't as good as some of those other big guys, but it is what it is. 636 charactersraynmoon, May 22, 2013

Smell is slightly bitter, but very fruity. Most prominent notes are orange peel, grapefruit. Whatever hops they use, I'm impressed.
Taste is velvety, floral, fruity, and bitter. It showcases a flavor profile that only a young Imperial can deliver. Fruitier than Heady Topper, Milder than Double Jack, smoother than anything from Lagunitas (and I'm a way bigger fan of Lagunitas than Stone, usually).
You'll appreciate the mouthfeel. It sticks around and makes you want the experience to last longer. Finish is long and memorable.
Overall, it's a great beer, but a bit pricier than several competitors that offer similar young double IPAs for half the cost. That being said, if it's the only beer I'm drinking that evening, it's a solid choice. It doesn't leave me wishing I ordered something else. 897 charactersBauzen, May 20, 2013

A - Nice cloudy, light golden. Good head.
S - One of the real strengths of this beer. Citrusy, herbal, some spice but not overly.
T - Again, citrusy and lemony flavors, medium hop flavors, yet very sessionable for the abv. Solid taste.
M - Smooth, not overly carbonated.
O - A very solid IPA. It's no wonder fans of this style seek this out. With food, I found it going down very quickly, despite the high alcohol. 427 charactersBeer-A-Lot, May 18, 2013

Ironically, I was getting ready to watch the Penguin game #2 against the Senators and was shopping for a good beer to drink at a store in Brooklyn and stumbled across this bottle. Now, I am watching the best team in hockey from my hometown and drinking best by 05/17/13 on 05/17/13. Life does not get much better than this!
Poured a golden in color w/ a big 2 finger white head that left sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma was of a massive amount of grapefruit, citrus, pine, and earthiness. The taste was big grapefruit up front, leading into medium amounts of resinous bitterness, finishing w/ vanilla mixed w/ an herbal quality.Medium bodied and somewhat dry. This, like most DIPAs was pretty drinkable.
Overall, a great DIPA from Stone! It was nice to see Stone's concern on freshness and innovation despite how large this brewery has become. This one just has a slight vanilla note on the end and the fact that it needs to finish drier that prevents it from being all-world. In the end, a well made DIPA that did not have many holes, but Stone should thank the Pittsburgh Penguins for filling the rest by winning 4-2.
Go Pens! Stanley Cup number 4 is around the corner. 1,292 charactersmikeyv35, May 18, 2013

A: Absolutely gorgeous. A clear golden amber with a big, rocky white head that lingers and laces. This is the platonic pale ale, appearance-wise. 
S: Even with one day to go, it smells like brewday. Citrusy and resinous. Floral, a little early. 
T/M: A total hop showcase, unsurprisingly. Grapefruit and other citrus. Nicely bitter, persistent but not overwhelming. A tiny bit of alcohol. Not much malt flavor to speak of. Mouthfeel's on the thick side for the style, very low carbonation. 
O: I think Enjoy By is one of the better innovations in craft beer recently. Putting a hard deadline on an IPA is brilliant. 678 charactersCharlatanSin, May 17, 2013

Served in a tulip glass and enjoyed on 5/15/13. The appeared a nice deep amber color with a thick, rocky white head that was really well retained. The beer gave off an intense pine hop aroma with maybe a slight hint of citrus. The taste was very good...the hops, while very very upfront were not so overpowering that I was turned off by them, as happens occasionally with some DIPAs. This might be one of the best DIPAs that I have enjoyed. The beer felt good and the beer was smooth, but drinkability does suffer given the ABV. Overall, an excellent brew. 619 charactersPhillyStyle, May 16, 2013

Mouthfeel is slightly this for a IIPA,but does not detract from the overall quality.Nice aftertaste that lasts.

The scent of this beer is wonderful you just smell wonderfully aromatic hops as soon as the cap comes off.

Generally flavorful and enjoyable 
Overall this beer reminded me a lot of the loose cannon Hop^3 IPA by heavy seas. If you like one of these beers you will like the other. 461 charactersTheheroguy, May 16, 2013

Thanks to rgilbert for getting me a couple of bottles of this.
Poured from a bomber.
Appearance: Nice hazy orange colored body. 2-3 fingers worth of foam, nice long lacing on the sides.
Smell: Wow, fresh zesty citrus aroma! Lemon, hops galore, breathe of fresh air, smells like squeezing fresh fruit.
Taste: Like biting into citrus fruit, major lemon rind, cross between lemon & grapefruit flavors with some good sweetness going on.
Mouthfeel: Bitter like it should be but very drinkable.
Overall: Love the idea behind this and while i might have enjoyed a bit more flavor depth, it's overall a solid brew. 636 characterspapat444, May 14, 2013

S - Intense, sweet hop aroma. Tons of tropical and citrus fruit, including mango, pineapple, grapefruit, mandarin orange, peach and subtle lychee aroma. Subtle bready malt aroma in the background. Fairly sweet on the nose.
T - Similar to the nose. Tons of sweet, juicy hops. Sweetened grapefruit/mandarin orange along with mango, pineapple, peach juice flavor. Very subtle malt backbone provides a hint of sweetness as well. It starts out somewhat sweet; then it gets predominantly fruity but balanced; and it finishes slightly bitter with some flowery/herbal and citrus rind flavors. Linger fruit, especially citrus, flavor. Faintest whisper of pine hidden throughout.
M - Light body with slightly above average carbonation. Crisp but goes down smooth. Not very hefty or sticky at all.
D - Wonderfully balanced DIPA with the light and crisp feel of an IPA. Loads of hops that stay strong throughout. Not overly bitter; actually, somewhat sweet in a DIPA not cloying way. Very easy to drink with alcohol absolutely hidden.
Notes: Enjoy By 05/17/13. I really like the idea of a somewhat limited, very hoppy beer with a very clear date. Not something I will get all the time, but not something that will just sit around and take up space. This was well executed with the hops shining and the malt really just helping to showcase the hops. I really enjoy fruity, slightly sweet DIPAs and this hit the spot. Surprisingly light and easy to drink really paired well with the flavors. Lived up to the hype I was reading and definitely worth a try. Great treat for every now and then with no concerns about freshness. 1,748 charactersFreshHawk, May 14, 2013

 the carbonation is perfect, the taste is indescribable and the after taste just leaves me craving my next gulp! the most pleasant thing about this beer is that despite the alchohol % and i.b.u. this beer is sooo BALANCED.... its unbelievable. perfectly balanced. i had the 7th batch (enjoy by 5-17-13) keep more comming to MN stone! 636 charactersBeerlover, May 14, 2013

Overall: This is a solid IPA from Stone. Comes off very fresh in flavor and is very enjoyable to drink. There’s virtually no hint of the amount of booze in this brew until you start to feel it from sipping your way through the beer. Stone is one of my favorite breweries and this beer doesn’t disappoint. 814 characterstastymug, May 13, 2013

A: transparent orange/gold color, two and half fingers of head, solid lacing.
S: Outstanding aroma. Picked up citrus hops right away, could smell tropical fruits and floral notes.
T: HOP BLAST! It jumps out to you with its hoppy and grapefruit flavor. Delivers a great combination of bitterness and sweetness. Aftertaste of bitterness remains but lightly.
M: Medium-bodied, moderate to high carbonation, slight boozy and dry finish.
O: This one reminds me of Abrasive in terms of bitterness and hoppy flavor and LOVED IT! Stone Brewing did another great job with one of their products. Arguably one of the most hop-forward beers out there. 732 characterscw577enfield, May 12, 2013

Pours golden with a fluffy one finger head and perfect clarity. Beautiful aroma of floral grapefruit, pine, lemon zest, grass, wow. Slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Flavor is grassy pine and sweet citurs. Lighter flavor and mouthfeel than I expect from a top double, but incredibly easy drinking and makes this even better than I expected.

Picked up a 22oz bomber and paired it with a piece of blue cheese jalapeno cheesecake from the new Stone Brewing World Bistro and Gardens at Liberty Station in Point Loma.
Pours a slight amber/straw-like hue with a fluffy white head that lingers, giving way to a good amount of lacing. Distinct yeast smell right off the bat, followed up with the expected hop bomb aroma - dried grass, grapefruit rind, earthy and herbal. Taste is similar to the nose but even greater amounts of white grapefruit and black peppercorn that seamlessly lead into a sweet grainy, lightly boozy (not in a bad way) finish. On the lighter side of medium bodied (how one does this with a Double IPA clocking in at 9.4% ABV is beyond me ???). Carbonation is light, the finish is clean and smooth. Insanely well done IIPA - once again proving that Stone is the king of hoppy beers! 871 charactersDeanMoriarty, May 12, 2013

It poured with a big frothy head that quickly dissipates. It has low retention and very little lacing. It has a bready aroma with big grapefruit notes. It tastes almost like it smells. Bready upfront and then turns to a grapefruit taste with a great finish. It has a decent body but I hoped it would be a little bigger and good carbonation that still tingles your tongue after you swallow. The fact that they hidnthe 9.5% abv makes this a great mouthfeel. This is a good beer and the one that had was from the 7th batch. It is the Enjoy By 5.17.13 and I enjoyed it on 5.11.13 so I was close to the expiration date. Good beer and I would like to try other batches. 705 charactersbrewdude1982, May 12, 2013

S - Wow! Mango, grapefruit, just plain hops. Absolutely intense. Mild sweetness and alcohol, a bit of orange.
T - Extraordinary. The bitterness doesn't overwhelm you at first; the first impression is "sweet." The grapefruit dominates the other fruit flavors, maybe a little too strongly, in fact. The aftertaste is a clean, hoppy bitterness. Smooth, very easy to drink. Every taste is completely full-bodied; letting it linger in the mouth reveals a little more fruit, and an aftertaste of grapefruit or orange peel. It's difficult to separate the various sweet citrus and fruit. My palate detects almost no specific malts, but maybe that's just me.
M - Tiniest amount of carbonation in the mouth, barely a hint of the 9.4% ABV. Extremely smooth, and easy to swish around and enjoy. Not exactly a gulping beer, but certainly not a dubbel or quad, either. This might be the most perfect mouthfeel I've found in a beer.
O - I was absolutely blown away by this beer, so much so that I ran out and bought two more to share at a tasting with friends. They were just as impressed. Every time this is available, I will buy it.
Poured into a Duvel goblet (slightly more than half the bottle per pour), and paired with apples, horseradish cheddar, crackers, and salami. 1,378 charactersRoguer, May 11, 2013

Great aroma of piney hops.
Taste is great as well, mostly piney hops with some floral hops. Bitterness is just right. This one ranks up there with Pliny the Elder, Blind Pig and other great DIPAs.

I got a bottle of the 7th batch, Enjoy By 05.17.13. The pour is a translucent flat yellow with orange notes. A fluffy finger and a half of cream colored head sits on top.
Wow, the nose is an intense blend of citrus and pine. Further inspection does yield some malt in there, but the grapefruit, mandarin orange, and pine car freshener smell are very strong.
Mango starts off the fun, then grapefruit and pine step in, pineapple, mandarin oranges... this is a hoppy festival in my mouth. Swallowing gets you a little malt, then its back to the pine and grapefruit.
This beer is perfectly carbonated, medium bodied, and goes down way too easy. There is no alcohol detected, and it's very refreshing. Only lightly sticky and not as drying as expected. Very juicy. 889 charactersCFHMagnet, May 10, 2013

A - Translucent orange with a forthy white foam head that retains very well. Nice rings of lacing. Very impressive looking beer.
S - Scents of tropical fruit. Tangerine, mango, and grapefruit hit the nose. There is a residual scent of hop resin and pne tar. Good complexity of smell, and you get the sense that this is a robust beer.
T - Tartness in the initial sip. Then there is a medley of sharp and bitter hops. Citra and cascade perhaps, but honestly a guess. The finish still holds citrus notes and a rich body of grain and malt.
M - Clearly a robust beer. The mellowness and balance tempers the ABV and bitterness. Actually a beer you could have a few of if you had the time to recuperate. 
O - My first crack at an Enjoy By beer. It is a high quality IPA and worth a try for any hophead. If this is the new standard in fresh IPA's I'd say Stone has set a benchmark for others to reach. 917 characterssocon67, May 09, 2013

I believe the best by date is 5/17/13, if I'm reading the arcane coding right. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife. 
The pour is one hundred percent pureed mango; I can almost imagine the pulp hiding in the dense liquid. Nose lovely right at the pop, pure-bred tropical fruit & citrus with an underlayment of sweetness. That's good. 
Enjoy by 5.17.13 succeeds in pushing hops straight up your nose; they're everywhere your palate turns. The nose leans into the taste with large-bore tropical fruits & liberal dose of citrus up front. The middle brings a low yield of grassy dankness, which isn't my thing in IPAs, but the bitter clean-up blast that follows mitigates my mouth somewhat. Bitterness sticks like pine tar. Alcohol isn't noted, & this is easy to sip. I'd buy this in a Big Gulp. 
Brilliant marketing ploy aside, this is a very good IIPA, but not worth the premium price tag. Glad I tried it. 1,021 charactersmaximum12, May 09, 2013

In the middle of the label is the head of the Stone gargoyle. The back of the bottle has the usual Stone novel. This version was from the 7th batch, 05.17.13. This beer was enjoyed on May 6th.
When poured into a Peg's Cantina Snifter, this Stone beer was a crystal clear golden apricot orange color. There's gold in this beer! On top of this golden brew was a small 1/4 of an inch cotton white head of foam. It had acceptable retention that left behind a tiny string of rings and a few spots of lace around this beer. 
There's gold in the color and pine in the aroma. Right up front in the aroma was a wall of pine. It didn't smell like a Christmas tree garden. A little less than that. Waiting for the pine to pass was this aroma's fruit orchard. There were citrus fruits and even a few tropical fruits. My nose picked up on bitter grapefruit, orange, mango, lemon, and even a drop of pineapple. I'm not sure what kind of hops were in the aroma. Smelled like it was a mix of floral and citrus hops. Doesn't matter what they were. They smelled great! I couldn't pick up any malts in the aroma. I'm OK with that. It didn't need it. 
If I had to describe this beer in one word, I would use the word "hoppy." Was it super duper hoppy? Just a shade under that. This beer didn't want to mess around. Right off the bat was the bitter citrus hops. These hops stick around for a while before it lets through the pine forest and fruit orchard. The fruits in the aroma had more of a variety. The taste only had bitter grapefruit, a pinch of orange peel, a drop of lemon zest, and a splash of pineapple. At the finish line was a subtle and I mean subtle taste of toasted malt. 
This was a medium bodied Imperial/Double IPA that had a good level of carbonation and a full flavored hoppy aftertaste. This aftertaste had its fair share of bitter citrus hops, pine resin, bitter grapefruit, lemon zest, and some floral notes. This aftertaste was so bitter than it will cling to the roof of your mouth and on the surface of your tongue for a long time. It will take an entire lake to get rid of this aftertaste. 
A very good and fresh Imperial/Double IPA from Stone. I had high hopes for this beer and it actually exceeded them. Would I drink it again? That's a stupid question! Of course I would! I hope I don't have to tell you this. Don't sit on this beer. Drink it fresh like the label says. You won't be sorry. 2,471 charactersAltBock, May 08, 2013

Just had this on tap, and it was better than I remembered. 
Peachy, sunny orange with a gentle haze. Drippy lacing forms a halo around the edges of the glass. A finger of foam settles to a delicate skim with a cirrus pattern to it. 
Pungent hoppy aroma, not without some pale malts bleeding through. Flavor is big on bitter citrus rind, grapefruit pith and orange zest, vague traces of cantaloupe. Smooth with a hint of pale malt or wheat. Bitter hop resin sticks to the teeth a little. Medium bodied but fairly light for a DIPA. Overall very solid and drinkable. 574 charactersemerge077, May 08, 2013

A - The beer is a lighter, transparent gold. 
S - tropical fruity notes, some citrus. 
T - nearly full flavored sweetness up front that is followed by a bittery and resiny aftertaste. A nice dry finish. It hides the booze well for a 9.4% beer. Some biscuity sweetness on the front end before the tropical fruit kicks in.
M - Not overly aggressive on the taste buds, but a very pleasant, drinkable double IPA with a very nice dry, bitter aftertaste.
O - Enjoy By is one of my favorite IPAs. It isn't the hop symphony that a beer like Heady Topper is, but Enjoy By really hits the hop appetite. I'm more of a bitter, dry tasting IPA guy, and Enjoy By certainly falls under this category. For me, it hits all the spots. 767 charactersSheppard, May 07, 2013

The angel is fruity, lemon, musky, but also contains strong notes of onion and chive. The chive and sweet vidalia are quite strong, and carry through on the taste which is also permeated by bitter hops and slight malt. 
Overall, if you like Sorachi Ace hops, you'll dig this beer. If not, you should probably pass. Personally I find it flavorful, unique and enjoyable. It is definitely different than many other stone offerings, and I'm interest to try my second bomber. 586 charactersRoyBatty, May 06, 2013

Light golden orange colored beer. Nice head. Decent retention. Great lacing
Fantastic aroma! Tropical fruit and citrus hops. Pungent and resiny Very strong and pronounced hop aroma. Some sweet malt, too. This is how a double IPA is supposed to smell like!
Great flavor. So much hop character! A nice balance of hop flavor, malt flavor and bitterness. Again, tropical fruit and citrus hops. A little spicy. Really nice flavor.
Medium bodied. Carbonation and bitterness is pretty harsh on the tongue. Everlasting dry, bitter finish.
I've recently realized the importance of drinking hoppy beers when they're fresh. This is a fantastic beer. I like the idea of having an "Enjoy By" date so prominent. For a hoppy beer, anyway. Hopefully I can snag a bottle or two from the next batch. 835 charactersUnderPressure, May 05, 2013

Pours a clear gold with two finger thick dense creamy head. Thick rings down the glass. Smell: quick melon note, floral, grapefruit, pine, dried apricot, alcohol. Taste: fleeting biscuit and melon then big hop blast - pine, grapefruit peel, grassy. Oily into drying into sticky. Really good SD style DIPA. Thanks for sending this our way - probably the freshest Stone to hit FL. 414 charactersbabaracas, May 05, 2013

A Transparent gold/amber. Thin slightly foamy head that disappears quickly. Fizzy carbonation. Nice lacing follows halfway down the glass.
S Piney. Flowery. Hoppy. Grapefruit. Intoxicating aroma. Just how I want an IPA to smell.
T Boozy. The 9.4% isn't hiding. This gives way to a refreshing hop bite. Do not pick up the fruitiness of the smell. Bitter aftertaste.
M Nice and chewy. A little bready. Once the carbonation settles, a very nice feel. Warm boozy finish.
O Extremes all around. From the powerful aroma to the bitterness and warmth of the taste and aftertaste. I do not get much complexity in the taste. However that may not be the intended vision behind this beer. Good powerful West Coast slap in the face! I did enjoy this. 781 charactersPieOhMy, May 04, 2013

Taste - Less intense hop flavor, but still high quality. Orange and tropical fruit flavors. Sweetness is pretty strong, but not overpowering. Minimal bitterness.

Appears to be an orange gold, clean beer, with a white pooofy top. Lace is gluey. Aroma is clean, orange soaked pulpy juicy layers, sweet deep spice, tea and nutmeg. Taste has a massive pile of orange, spice, and pine. Bursting with juiciness and flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy, dank, bitter. Body is big. Deceptively very delicately carbonated. Overall this beer is essentially a hop flavorfest and to no surprise another treat from Stone. 446 characterstastybeer, May 03, 2013

Lightly hazed golden orange colour, one finger of white head, good amount of lace on the glass. Huge citrus upfront, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, mango and a faint lemon, a bit of sweet honey dew like malt but certainly not shortage of hops in this. Taste is citrusy, grapefruit and pineapple, a bit of dank piney flavours, solid bitterness throughout , starts off dry and hoppy with a touch of sweet malts toward the end. Light dry carbonation, medium bodied and fairly oily as well. Just incredible stuff, cartainly something I would love to have again and again. 638 characterspeensteen, May 02, 2013

The nose is crazy hoppy. Tons of tropical and grapefruit hop flavors with an undertone of piney bitterness.

The mouthfeel is on the light side and fairly carbonated, and the drinkability is exceptional. Overall, Stone Enjoy By is an extremely tasty and enjoyable IPA.

A: The body is insanely clear. Almost yellow in color, the beer looks very inviting. The two-finger head is white in color and laces the side of the glass nicely. 4.5
S: The aroma is all fruit. Citrus and grapefruit mostly. I'm surprised there isn't more bitterness, but I'm not complaining at all. 4
T: The taste begins with all citrus, but is followed by grassy, bitter hops. I swear there's a dank character in there as well. Slightly weed-like, not going to lie. A very slight amount of booze is there, but it certainly isn't unpleasant. 4.5
MF: Light body with a nice amount of carbonation. The finish is crisp and clean with a really nice bitter finish. It's very drinkable for the high ABV. 4.5

I'd heard a ton about this beer and was really looking forward to this brew. Poured a bomber into a tulip, and the head dissipated rather quickly. The color was a perfect pale gold, and the head was a nice white/pale straw. The aroma didn't do much for me, a touch of spice, and sweet and earthy/flowery smell. The taste isn't as sweet as I was expecting and, although I appreciate west coast IPAs, this one didn't really have the malt character to balance out the appreciable hops. After all of that being said, I did enjoy this Enjoy By, and will probably pic up one of them again, but likely in late fall if they put one out around then. 703 charactersmverity, May 01, 2013

Enjoy By IPA pours a soft golden amber color. It is quite transparent, with visible carbonation rising up from the bottom of my glass into a robust off-white cap. This exhibits great head retention and leaves a few spiderwebs of lace down the sides of the glass.
The aroma is the strongest aspect of this beer. Sweet and juicy mango and tropical fruit hop notes waft out of the glass first, with some candied grapefruit, dank, and pine notes coming through as well.
Even without seeing the label, it would be easy to tell that this is a Stone beer. Brazenly hopped, there is still a great transition from sweet to hoppy, which is a progression that separates the best IPA’s from the rest. A bit of honey and caramel lead nicely into the caramelized grapefruit hop notes, with tons of mango, peach, apricot, pine, and herbal hop flavors as well. The finish is bitter, but the flavors help to grow the bitterness over the course of the sip.
Stone also brews its beers with an understanding of keeping the ABV, flavor, and body all in line, and this is no exception. A high ABV by IPA standards, the flavor really masks any suggestion of booziness, and the smooth body and creamy carbonation work to keep each sip fresh. 
With a robust addition of hops across a wide range of flavors, this is a great addition to the Stone family. I also appreciate their effort to encourage hoppy beers to be labeled fresh for immediate consumption. 1,479 charactersKickInTheChalice, May 01, 2013

Glass: Bell's "globe" style snifter.
Appearance: Hazy, copper orange color. A finger of head is left after a moderate pour. The head quickly dissipates into wispy traces on the surface of the beer. No lacing remains after taking sips, but I suppose that comes with the territory. 
Smell: Grapefruit! A bit of orange mixes its way in, with the tiniest bit of pine thrown in for good measure. 
Taste: Amazing. Grapefruit from the smell comes through in a very strong way. A piney bitterness lingers on in the aftertaste. The alcohol is very well hidden.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium carbonation, perfect! Oils mingle with a wonderfully dry finish.
Overall: My favorite IPA to date. Just an amazing beer. 730 charactersChrisKayler, May 01, 2013

Poured into a large snifter glass. The beer pours clear orange golden with a thick, slowly retreating white head and lots of tiny streaming bubbles. The beer has a bright aroma of grapefruit, mango, and peach, but also hints of pine and sweet malt. Flavors of grapefruit, peach, mango hit the mouth up front with the piney bitterness hitting in the back. Further sips bring in more piney bitterness, though this is milder than some of the West Coast hop bombs, and more of that malt backbone. Make no mistake about this one. This is geared towards hop heads, so you're not going to find an extremely balanced IPA here. Still, the malt profile is bready and has light caramel sweetness. Because of the lack of malt balance, this is a bit thinner than many DIPAs. The body is medium and the carbonation is moderate. The finish is slightly dry and the hops provide plenty of aftertaste. The drinkability is very high since the alcohol can't be tasted. This is an excellent beer for what it is. I can admire what Stone is doing for the marketing gimmick, reminding people that beer should be enjoyed fresh. 1,145 charactersacevenom, Apr 30, 2013

A: Thin, very white head. Paler malt than customary for a DIPA, but Stone IPAs are usually on the lighter end of the spectrum. Some bubbles releasing from bottom. 
S: All citrus. Peaches. Mango and pineapple as it warms. Some alcohol. Big and raw.
T: A flash of peach before the bitterness spreads out. Not extremely bitter, though there's not a lot of malt balance here. It's a hophead's delight.
M; Heavy, slick. Lingering bitterness, obviously.
O: Perhaps the beer that brings the issue of IPA freshness to the mainstream. Also a beautifully executed West Coast-style DIPA that's heavy on citrus aromas and light on malty sweetness. Not a terrible value at $7.49 and still very much around New Orleans in its second week since dropping. 846 charactersZethOfTheNorth, Apr 30, 2013

A- Pours a dark golden color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that retains a long time before slowly shrinking to an 1/8 inch head. Semi-resilient lacing leaves cloud-patterned wisps behind on the glass. 
S- So pungent of a hop aroma it bypasses the usual citrus notes and moves on to a dank, almost chemical-like green aroma. Hard to describe but just think of all the piney, fresh, resinous hop flavors you know and love concentrated into a strong bouquet that's just lovely.
T- Intense bitterness lays on the palate smoothly with lots of citrus and pine notes that also linger in the aftertaste. Alcohol is concealed very well allowing the brightness of the hops to shine and play on the tongue. 
M- Slightly sharp and oily with a lightish body and medium carbonation. 
O- Hard to imagine IPAs can get much better than this, though it's possible and I've witnessed it. Not the best of its kind, but it ranks up there with the other heavy hitters. Certainly the best DIPA Stone has ever made though, IMO. 1,063 charactersImmortale25, Apr 30, 2013

The beer is surprisingly easy drinking for such a big beer, good carbonation, full bodied. A good DIPA.

Aroma: A good bit of honey, caramel, toffee accompanied by a big whiff of cat piss, grapefruit, orange peel and pine. A pretty balanced nose in terms of the components of the beer, though the cat piss is pretty damn strong. A pretty dank DIPA. (4)
Colour: I don't know if its the teku (my first brew in this glass) but this is an absolutely beautiful, clear light copper brew that pours with a thick fluffy white head that gets as high as 3cm before very slowly, slowly receding into a somewhat thick film and a rather thick collar. The lacing is ridiculous with a lot of staying power. Altogether, a very appealing beer that looks fantastic in the glass even when its gone. (4.5)
Flavour: Nice! Its a very hoppy, dank brew that still busts out its malt card. In the beginning, I get a lot of citrus and tropical fruit- a combination of grapefruit and mango is the best I can put it, followed by honey, toffee and biscuits, which provides a nice sweet deliciousness. Then at the end I get a good bit of pine and accompanying citrus. Delicious- balanced yet supremely hoppy. I guess its very hoppy and malty (though obviously hoppier than it is malty). Even better, its refreshing to drink on this fine spring day! (4.25)
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied brew that's very well carbonated and coats the palate with all of the flavours and some carbonated fizz to boot. It's resinous with a semi-dry finish yet refreshing. Aftertaste is a continuation of that blend of malt backbone and hops- it's like the malt and hops are battling and it's close, but the malt loses out in the end. That's exactly why this is a double IPA. Pretty nice, quite dank and hoppy yet not too bitter and very easy to drink. (4)
Overall: I'm very impressed with this fresh DIPA offering from Stone. It's appetizing, rich, tasty, sweet and hoppy yet very easy to drink. This is a beer where the malt and hops are both present, making for rich complex flavours yet still crisp and refreshing (as opposed to a RIS or barleywine). I'm impressed and going to have to give Stone the due they deserve here. Tasty as heck. (4) 2,235 charactersStevedore, Apr 29, 2013

Reviewed from notes. Poured from bomber into an Upland pint glass.
A: Beautiful clear gold with a one-finger white head. Carbonation visible in large bubbles, but seems a little low.
S: Huge nose on this. Smell-it-from-three-feet-away kind of huge. Big grapefruit, pine, mango/tropical fruit, grassy, dank and some cat pee. All of these dwarfing the biscuit sweet malts but not overwhelming them entirely.
T: Follows the nose, with some more melon/spice hops and less citrus than the aroma. Hop bitterness in the finish but not overdone. Obviously a hop-forward beer, but drags a toe closer the the balanced line than I expected.
M: Light body for DIPA, good carbonation. The hefty ABV is very well-hidden.
O: I'm quite impressed. The hop profile isn't my first choice, but the elements work in harmony. My first Enjoy By iteration, but hopefully it won't be the last. Excellent beer. 907 charactersmacrosmatic, Apr 29, 2013

A: It serves up a nice light orangey tan color. What really creates the visual appeal is the beers ability to keep a nice cloying thinly ribboned head far up the glass.
S: Fresh grapefruit and piney scent. Expected a little buttery notes from the appearance but it is all fresh and crisp.
T: When I think of "fresh" hoppy beer I am thinking undeveloped and waiting to reach complexity. Instead of that bitter dry hopped taste this beer, surprisingly, is more mellow on the bitterness and esters. It has a really nice balance with a hint of non-malty sweet on the back end that comes through more as it warms. Never fear intrepid IPA'ers it keeps it's hops profile full and upfront.
M: The only small downside to this beer is the oily feel it leaves. A trade off to the pretty cloying head. Not as thin and crispy as you might expect. Which is a good thing in my book.
O: I am not a huge IPA fan, though a double is better. I do have to say this is one of the better representations of the style. Stone always provides a quality product and this is no different. What really impresses me is the ability to weigh in at 9.4% without getting wacked up side the head with the alcohol taste. I will be back to hunt down the next batch. 1,282 charactersweeheavybutdieting, Apr 29, 2013

Appearance - a very slightly hazed golden brew with two fingers of white manila foam. Very sticky, lacy ropes and clumps all around, the head recedes to about a half-finger and is holding. 
Aroma - fresh orange, mango, lemon, with a piney edge. Pine and some biscuity malts emerge as the beer sets up.
Taste - good biscuity malt base, hops moving in without delay as expected. Some light fruitiness, grapefruit pith mostly, though not as much as expected given the citrusy sniff. The character here is more piney, with some pungency in the exhale. Gets dry and has a more pronounced bitterness on the swallow and aftertaste, edging into medicinal territory. The finish is a bit harsher than I prefer, but the intent here is to showcase the hop, not necessarily balance. No trace of the 9.4%.
Mouthfeel - pretty crisp, though not as big a body as I would have thought for a DIPA.
Overall - glad to have tried it and worth chasing down having missed it the last few go-rounds. but not one I would continue to pursue, unless of course they vary up the recipe each time, then it would be interesting to compare the different batches. 1,151 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Apr 28, 2013

Mouthfeel: Tingly feel, not too heavy.
Overall: This was an impressive beer from Stone. I thought it would be more bitter, like Ruination, but it had a nice sweetness to it that gave it balance. It was really easy to drink, more like an IPA than a double. Good stuff! 512 charactersMdog, Apr 28, 2013

Poured from a bomber into a tulip glass.
A: Clear, brassy golden color with one finger of white foam head. Heavy lacing remains on the glass.
S: This beer's smell presents sticky over-ripe tropical fruit and dank green plant stems; qualities of current hops cultivars are obviously well represented. No alcohol is detected.
T: Begins off-dry, with intense hops aromatics that include passion fruit, guava, and herbaceous spice. Pale malt is refined and relegated deep into the support function. Flavors dry out during the middle while hops-derived flavors decline slowly. Bitterness is fairly restrained for the style, with a late whiff of carbonic acid lingering. No alcohol is detected.
M: Medium viscosity, sticky on the palate, with low carbonation.
D/O: This is a solid DIPA with a modern hops profile. At almost 10% abv, this one is a sleeper that threatens to punish the overindulgent later. It masterfully keeps the hops qualities laser-focused on just the most appealing, never veering into the "kitchen-sink" territory indicative of many over-the-top members of the style. Beers like this are going to eventually demand that all brewers of fine experimental pale ales update their recipes. A Centennial-heavy IPA just can't measure up to the apparently Simcoe/Galaxy/Citra foundation that is faithfully transmitted here. This is indistinguishable from Lagunitas Sucks, which actually puts this beer in a position to apologize for being stronger by almost 2%. 1,491 charactersbeagle75, Apr 28, 2013

S: Blow your head off hops! A peppery mix - Citrus (grapefruit, lemon, orange peel?), resinous pine, faint malt and finally some alcohol. 
T: Hops explode on the tongue, citrus leads but the pepper/pine mix follows. It really does taste like it smells. The finish is long, lots of bitterness on the back of the tongue, but with enough malt to balance the explosion of bitterness.
M: Starts light and refreshing but finishes heavy and oily from the abundant malt and hops.
O: Horribly enjoyable. So refreshing that you might mistake it for a session beer, but drink at your peril. I really liked this beer! 809 charactersbschinelli, Apr 28, 2013

A - Pours a bright golden hay in color with borderline amber hues. Has a frothy bright white one finger head with big bubbles. Not much retention but good lacing.
S - Grapefruit juices, lingering pineapple with a touch of pine hops. 
T - The citrus notes in the smell along with the bready malts balance wonderfully. There is pine notes on the end. Just hoppy through and through, from beginning to end.
M - Very drinkable... It's crazy how it's not overly malted or sticky at all. Just a medium bodied beer with great carbonation that is scarey easy to drink!

Classic Stone IPA aroma of hops, hops and hops. Wet, soapy, lots of sharp citric with touches of grape and floral notes with minimal malt smells. Malts are more noticeable in the taste of this beer as it has a slight sweet edge, and in fact I notice that it seems to sweeten up a little more as it warms. Enjoyable beer (no pun intended), very crisp, dry finish, good balance, overall a hop lovers delight as it has a very strong hop presence with lots of citric and grapefruit flavors and even touches of sweeter fruits. 636 charactersclayrock81, Apr 28, 2013

First off I want to say that I haven't been a big fan of IPA's and have just recently started tasting them due to my experience and taste maturing. I had a few from the LIberty Tap Rooms in Columbia and Myrtle Beach, SC as well as from the Sunoco gas station in Georgetown, Sc (who has a few micro brews (Rogue, RJ Rockers, and those frog themed guys out of Georgia as well as Chimay in stock all the time) and my go to store Pawley's Island Wine & Spirits. I give big kudo's to PIW&S for turning me on to this one.
Appearance: a clear slightly orange straw color with a big white rocky head that fairly quickly dissipated leaving beautiful lacing down my Duvel glass.
Smell: Strong Pine and Moderate Grapefruit
Taste: Similar to the smell, slightly hoppy with strong pine, more grapefruit and a little grassy fruity taste. Damn it was smooth. My favorite to date. Drink it not to long after it poors as for me it mellowed too much with time.
Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth for an IPA. Slightly oily, not to bitter as most IPA's are for me and it finished rather quickly but left a very slight bitterness but mostly pine/grapefruit aftertaste. It made me want to take another taste fairly quickly.
Overall: The ABV in this hidden well and it will bite you in the ass if you aren't careful. To date this is the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking, providing you don't let it warm too much. I will go back to Stone for this line again if they continue it. 1,498 charactersKneph13, Apr 28, 2013

A: Very few bubbles coming up from the bottom with minimal head and lacing. It is a very clear amber bronze.
S: The smell on this is a true citrus bomb, with main notes of grapefruit and pineapple. It smells like the aerosolized spray that you get when you open up any citrus fruit with your bare hands. There is a slight backend note of pine to smooth things out.
T: Everything about this is even and balanced. You get steady waves of citrus and pine that balance and enhance each other like sine waves in sync. The aftertaste is about the same as how it tastes regularly, with the pine notes just slightly edging the rest out but I think that is because of the tendency for the stickiness of the resin oils to stick about (only my quick beer science hypothesis). Oddly, though I seem to like it a bit cooler as it seems to mellow out as it warms, but still is a top-notch IPA even then.
M: One of the smoothest IPAs I have tasted. It had less carbonation than the Dayman, and it flows nicely with almost no obstruction from carbonation, but you can feel it faintly tickling your tongue and that is about it.
O: I've had this before on tap (the 4/1/13). It is an excellent DIPA, but I think I prefer it on tap. I actually shared a little less of half of this one for a friend's birthday. This beer really is just as I remember it, but that first time on tap seems to be a bit better. However, that could have been anything: a few days fresher, the physics of being on tap, the company/atmosphere, and even the nostalgia of it being my first time having it. I will say that this is one killer IPA that deserves its status, and is only like this because of the mandated freshness. It reminds me a lot of Burley Oak's Aboriginal Gangster, which is just a super local IPA that is always really fresh. 1,847 charactersgillagorilla, Apr 28, 2013
4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pale amber body with a slight haze to the body. Has enough transparency to see some carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. A thick, slightly off-white head lingers around and leaves a ton of lacing.
S- The usual citrus and pine come through in a huge way, along with a lot of tropical fruit notes including grapefruit and mango. 
T- All of the big flavors come through. Very citrusy with tons of the tropical flavors coming through. Just enough malt sweetness as well.
M- Incredibly drinkable for just a big, bold IIPA. The feel is what makes this one stand out. Big hoppy beers are rarely smooth and sometimes harsh on the palate. This one is very smooth for the style. Perfect carbonation as well.
O- A tremendous IIPA and different enough to be memorable in a crowded category. 803 charactersstephenjmoore, Apr 28, 2013

Great hoppy smell that is not quite like any other double IPA. Maybe based on the the smell my expectations were extremely high. The taste was a very slight let down from the smell. Hoppy yet, not nearly what you would expect from the smell. The feel was a bit thin too. I felt like for this double IPA, the hoppy presence peeks very quick then fades into more of a watery mouthful. Overall, I do like this beer but was expecting more from it. It did fall short of being a world class beer but I still enjoyed it. I do have another bottle that I will try as the first beer of the evening to see if I've been thrown off by the other beers. 757 characterssjones5045, Apr 28, 2013

Great looking beer. Clean gold body accented with steady beading and a frothy finger of bone white head which laces perfectly.
Lush citric hops and loads of tropical sweetness... just a touch of prickly conifer... classic West Coast IPA aromas.
Big, bright hop flavors that show little to no abrasion. Bittersweet orange zest, pine and mellow mango. Dynamic, balanced, and surprisingly drinkable. 
I seriously hope this one returns to MN in the future. 511 charactersyamar68, Apr 27, 2013

The aroma: oily hop resins, prickly pine, lemon zest, orange peel, plenty of bitterness, but not too much so.
The taste of it: Intense bitterness grips the palate, buzzes the tongue, leaves little bombs of sweetness at variable intervals. With each new sip and swallow, a repeat of the pass, gripping bitterness, attacking the tongue, swabbed by sweet, ending dryly, reading for the next round. Medium bodied, long hoppiness…and the high alcohol doesn't get you until you're, wait, where are we now? About 3/4 into the bottle. Yep, it's creeping up…
This lands somewhere between the regular Stone IPA, which I love, and Ruination. Not quite as ruining. I would appreciate it more dialed down a notch or two, though. Maybe 7.5% would make it more enjoyable by.
Here's some gobbledygook from the label: "You have in your hands a devastatingly fresh double IPA. Freshness is a key component in many beers, especially big, hoppy IPAs--but we've taken it further, a lot further, with this one. We brewed this IPA specifically not to last. We've gone to extensive lengths to to ensure you get your hands on this beer within an extraordinarily short window, and we've sent a very clear message in the name of the beer itself that there is no better time than NOW to enjoy this IPA."

It is not a Pliny, Hopslam, or even a Nugget Nectur. But, this beer sends a message to IPA beer lovers. That message is freshness. While it is not anywhere near the best IPA I have ever tasted, it is one of the freshest and I think that this concept is missing. As a IPA drinker I have been feeling that sometimes I'm cheated. Nugget Nectur ( I consider this an IPA even though it is an IAPA) is one of my favorites, but I always feel like I have to buy it when it first comes out. If I don't, I run the risk of buying an old batch in which the hops are gone and it taste not the way it is intended. Ever wondered about the "create your own 6 pack" special at some beer stores. Yea.. don't do it with IPAs because the single beers they sell in that form is always three months old. So... while it is not the best IPA, it is an IPA that I would rather drink than a 3 months old Hopslam. You have to respect a company that takes the quality of their beer seriously and that is why I will probably continue to wait and stalk a beer store for when they receive an "enjoy by." 1,172 charactersmvice001, Apr 27, 2013

4.43/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy by 05.17.13. Served in a Dogfish Head signature glass
Appearance: Pours a golden, light orange, honey color with a finger of an off white head. Body is somewhat hazy, with some light carbonation streaming throughout the glass.
Smell: Big bitter citrus aromas, pine, resin, mango, grass, with a slight malt sweetness underneath it all.
Taste: Grapefruit, pine, orange zest, tropical fruit, sweet malt. Bitterness is high, but not overwhelmingly so. This is a very well balanced DIPA.
Mouthfeel: Lighter side of full bodied. Medium carbonation. Finishes dry but with just enough malt sweetness to balance things out. 
Overall: While I enjoy IPAs, they're generally not one of my favorite styles. This beer could make me reconsider that stance. I had previously had the 12.21.12 and it seems as though the tropical fruit notes in this batch are not as prevalent. So while that does detract a little from its overall score, this is one of the best IPAs I've had and is definitely worth seeking out. 1,005 charactersJonada, Apr 27, 2013

Appearance: Medium yellow to light orange in color. Pours a light lacing that sticks well to the glass.
Aroma: Bitter grapefruit, orange zest and some pine tones.Plenty of bright hoppiness here. You can definitely pick up on the freshness.
Taste: Bright grapefruit, lots of citrus fruit, a touch of mango and some earthy, pine notes. Big dry and bitter finish. The sweetness from the malt and the ABV is really quite low.
Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected carbonation with a light to medium mouthfeel for the style. Really refreshing and easy to drink.
Overall, a really tasty imperial IPA with a big, bitter hop bite. I like how it maintains the drier character of a lower ABV beer. Tons of flavor, but the sweetness and complexity of the hops are a bit overwhelmed by bitterness. I really appreciate the idea behind this beer and the beer itself is also very good. 952 charactersGosox8787, Apr 27, 2013

Crystal clear gold with an orange tint. Nice, foamy white head. The smell is simply intoxicating. I'm not sure I can verbalize fully; hard to distill the qualia. 
Dank, citrus rind permeates my palate in the freshest and meanest way. The flavor is eye-rolling good -- wonderful balance of rich malts and a sexy melange of hop notes. Grapefruit, tropical fruits, and resins resonate throughout and are fully supported by an appropriate body and mouthfeel. Piquant grassy notes poke through here and there as well. Smooth and devilish for the ABV. Rich grains and toasty caramel notes play in the secondary. Prickly, peppery resin notes linger toward the finish, which is nice and dry. Medium to full-bodied and a sheer joy to drink. 
Absolutely delicious. And I love the concept of promoting fresh beer; most beers do not need to sit in your 55 degree closet. So happy to find this release here in VA. Thanks to Bon Vivant in Smithfield for stocking this. 992 charactersZraly, Apr 27, 2013
4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Very good ipa. Pours a yellow-gold, with a nice white head. Aroma is big, big hops. Pine and citrus rind fill the nostrils. There is a deep, somewhat dark note to these hops. Taste is a little sweet and simple at first, I'm getting maybe just base and a caramel malt, but then the hops open up delivering puckering lemon rind and a hint of grapefruit. Deep pine notes overwhelm. The finish is nice bittersweet at first and then just bitter. Mouthfeel is okay, maybe a little thin. Overall great hop aroma and good hop taste, but not one of my elite dipas.
Edit: Had this on tap in Asheville and it was fantastic. Might have been a different bottling, might have been me. 670 charactersjmaharaj, Apr 27, 2013

Pours a beautiful sunset orange into my DFH glass. Chewy, foamy, white head billows atop this crystal clear copper brew. Not as much carbonation as I expected. The head fades rather quickly but leaves gobs of sticky lacing all over the glass.
Overripe pineapple, lots of yellow grapefruit, orange peel, touches of mango, dried compost and pine needles. Little bits of skunky weed, but mostly and mix of tropical fruit with a citrus punch. I had the last batch on tap and I remember the smell being much more intense. 
Lotsa pine, grapefruit rind/pith, mango and pineapple. Really nice blend of citrus bitter and tropical sweetness. Not outstanding by any means, but very nice.
Really nice, but nowhere near a perfect blend of citrus/pine/caramel/tropical. Bitter enough, but still lets the fruit shine thru. 
I'm not overly impressed with this IIPA. At $16/4-pack it's not at all worth it IMHO. I'll take Resin or Big A over this anyday of the week! Not bad, but not at all worth it either. Get on the hype train. 1,038 charactersThickfreakness, Apr 26, 2013

The beer pours a beautiful golden orange with almost amber highlights. It pours with a half of a finger’s with head of pristine white, small bubbles that all sit as uniform in size, and stay the same height on the glass, but fad to a scrim in the middle of the beer. The head leaves a lacing of thick, creamy bubbles on the glass, forming fat waves on the sides. In body the beer is clean with a slight chill haze and lots of little bubbles gently working their way to the top of the beer. On the nose, the beer is pungent from the minute the bottle is cracked. This smell is everything I expect from Stone, with big sticky resin on the nose blending beautiful into tropical and stone fruit notes of mango, papaya, slight grapefruit, and a kiss of boozy malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly bitter with a nice kiss of sweet hops, a touch of sweet alcohol, and some slight acidity coming off the hops as well. The flavors begin as sweet mango and papaya, which are quickly blasted away by dank, resinous pine notes that smother the bitters gently across the palate and give the tongue a nice shiver. Pinecone flavors meld and overpower a slight sweet caramel touch, while stone fruit flavors and a touch of pineapple gel in the background of the flavor. The finish is long, smooth, and bitter with medicinal and pine flavoring that works into the aftertaste of bitter resin, though the finish does showcase a hiccup of sweet and almost cloying caramel malt. In the mouth, the beer feels surprisingly fat and syrupy, coming in on the heavier side in body with a smooth and sticky carbonation that oozes the beer over the tastes buds. The mouth is left wet on the sides with a light dryness traveling up the middle of the tongue. Overall, this is good DIPA, and I didn’t expect anything else from Stone. It could use a touch more dryness to it, as the alcohol and sweet hops do provide hiccups of cloying sugar on the tongue and stomach, but overall, this is a beautiful expression of hops. The hop character is deeply complex and nuanced, revealing new flavors to the palate with every sip. It does sit a little thick in the stomach, though, and is definitely more of a sipper, but all in all this is a damn good DIPA with a great message about the life of hoppy flavors. 2,291 charactersMaxwell, Apr 26, 2013

Smell is a blast of citrus and juicy hops. The immense dry hopping here is very evident. Complex? No, not really, but for this style this is about as good as it gets (for me anyway).
Taste is slightly bitter up front, then delves into a juicy citrus (grapefruit/orange) middle and then a nice dry finish. The slightest bit of harshness starts coming through over time, but never in a bothersome way. No real sense of alcohol in the taste.
Mouthfeel is a bit slick while maintaining a sense of crispness. Good for what it is.
Overall this is a really great IPA and a great concept. Tons and tons of hop juicyness without any intense bitterness. I hope they continue producing this and keep it relatively easy to get. 832 charactersmechamifune, Apr 26, 2013

Appearance: A nice growing light orange with a little gold thrown in. A one and half finger white head that dissipated fairly quick. 
Aroma: Mango, pine, and some citrus. Very slight floral. 
Taste: Mango, tangerine, pine, grapefruit, slight orange, and a little mint at the end. Plenty of sweetness. A little caramel is detected. Very light breadiness. Bitterness is actually soft and barely lingers. A nice balance between the two. Surprisingly clean.
Mouthfeel: Good full feel. Goes down very smooth. Feels a little sticky. 
Overall: A good Imperial IPA. I look forward to when it come out again. Since I missed out last time and now finally got a bottle. 694 characterszrbeer1579, Apr 26, 2013

A: pretty standard, yet still beautiful, DIPA color. Light amber with a hazy, sunburst orange look to it... like jimmy page's les paul.
S: sweet hoppy goodness. Pretty mild, yet sweet smelling IPA. I get a piney, resiny smell with this one. Maybe a minuscule sense of citrus in there.
T: wow this DIPA does not mess around. Right out of the gate a strong taste of citrus and pine, with the hops reasonably present throughout. As a fan of east coast DIPAs, there is always more room for hops in my book, but this will do just fine. Nothing too boozy upfront, just an insanely clean beer for a 9.4.
M: beer really shines here. Pretty full, but nothing overwhelmingly carbonated. Goes down smooth ad definitely lingers on the tounge for awhile. Stickiness isn't too profound, but it's there.
O: absolutely happy with Stone with this one. A very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA, especially on a warm spring day. Nothing too unique compared to heady or Lawson's (i know, I know...) but would absolutely recommend to a fan of sticky, citrusy DIPAs. 1,115 characterstake_it_sleazy, Apr 26, 2013

4.76/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Enjoy By 5/17, bottled on 4/12.
Fairly conventional-looking IPA at first, with a pale amber color and high clarity. A big, fluffy head forms, and the head retention is excellent. Pretty epic lace formation, too. Super-fresh aroma, with an awesome fruit presence through notes of tangerine, mango, and passion fruit. To a lesser extent, there's some grapefruit, and to an even lesser extent some grass and pine.
As expected, the flavor is immensely hop forward. While dry overall, there's just about the perfect amount of malt sweetness to stand up to the bitterness. Just a very slight flash of alcohol heat on the finish. Big grapefruit and resin presence. Oily and also a bit sticky on the palate, with the carbonation having a soft touch.
A truly outstanding DIPA, head and shoulders above Ruination. Stone reasserts their cred when it comes to IPAs. 856 charactersgr0g, Apr 26, 2013

Pours a light gold, with hints of copper. Bone white head which goes away pretty quickly. A nice looking DIPA. Candied lemons, sour fruits, fresh grass, a little orange, and even some maltiness are all coming through on the nose. My nose was a little stuffed up while drinking this unfortunately so I wasn't getting as much aroma as I would have liked. Taste is very balanced for such a strong and fresh-hoppy DIPA. Really nice hop profile, lots of IBU's but it's balanced very nicely by a pretty solid malt backbone. The maltiness really compliments the hops and makes this beer more than just another extreme over the top hop bomb: the hop profile is pretty intense and great, but it's balanced nicely, which I like. The 9.4% alcohol is nowhere to be found in the aroma or the taste which is great but dangerous. I don't doubt I will be feeling that by the end of this bomber.
Overall an awesome beer. Super fresh and super delicious. My only "complaint" (not really a complaint just a comment) is that for a beer that advertises itself as super fresh and hoppy, it could be a bit more of a hop bomb. Compared to something like heady, the hop profile is not that insane. Still and amazing beer though. 1,298 charactersnquigley16, Apr 26, 2013

Solid finger and a half of egg-white head retreats to a thin film which remains for the rest of the drink and leaves behind small spots on the glass.
Bright, brilliant, fresh and unparalleled aroma. Lemon and orange zest, grapefruit, pine needles, juicy mango, ripe tropical fruits, honey and fresh cut grass.
The flavor delivers what it promises. This is by far the freshest IPA I have ever tasted. I love how the malt character is subtle with white and rye bread tones. This allows the hop flavors to come through full force with lemon rind, grapefruit, pine, and mild detergent. Leaf, oil and resin bitterness battle against a midwestern IPA tropical sweetness of mangos and tangerines. Absolutely perfect balance for a beer of this strength and complexity.
Mouthfeel: again, flawless! Perfect medium body, lighter than most DIPA's and this adds to the flavor. Oily at first then dry from middle to end. Crisp, dry finish leaves your palate begging for more. Perfectly carbonated.
This is more than a beer; it is a work of art. Such aggressive flavors yet such perfect balance and light, crisp, refreshing feel. I could drink this all day if it wasn't 9.4% abv. I love the combination of Midwest and West coast hop flavors. I also love the fresh IPA concept and if the name hadn't caught my eye, I probably wouldn't have bought it. Well-done. 1,454 charactersbnes09, Apr 25, 2013

I didn't realize but apparently the r Enjoy by series makes its varying appearance in different states at different times of the year, and that explains why it took a couple months for me to get my hands on one after the 12.21.12 which made its appearance at Beermageddon 2013.
To be honest I'm glad I didn't try it, not only would it have been old, but the 4.1.13 that I got a hold of was fantastic. I had mine in mid-march (sorry for the late review, but I'm getting the 5.18.13 Enjoy by via N'awlins soon so I wanted to compare my notes), and I felt like I should have worked up a good sweat before trying this thirst quenching IPA. 
The appearance was a transparent amber haze, and the smell was pure hops- very forest like. The taste was good like I said refreshing, tingling the taste buds wanting more. The mouthfeel did have an odd but refining quality, but the after taste was lingering one that wouldn't go away even after popcorn. All and all, decent, get it if you can, I'd give it a 93/100 1,055 charactersAbbbp, Apr 25, 2013

Appearance: Pours a light amber/gold and leaves a pretty smell white head - less than one finger. Extremely transparent beer.
Smell: Very strong pine as well as some earthy notes and hints of citrus. Definitely on the stronger side for a DIPA.
Taste: Strong pine and other earthy notes, this one's all hops. Notes of citrus can be found as well as some tobacco, and light grassy flavors. Finishes with more bitter pine as well as some alcohol.
Mouth-feel: Low level of carbonation, light to medium body with a bit of a syrupy texture but pretty light. 
Overall: A solid Double IPA, emphasis on the double. The hops explode with flavor and this is definitely not a session ale - this one packs a punch. For hop lovers, this is a must try. 829 charactersResuin, Apr 25, 2013

the taste was absolutely stunning. the hops popped on the tongue with a freshness and fullness that i have not tasted before. i LOVED schlafly TIPA this past winter, and this brew reminded me of tipa on steroids...everything was amplified. so much fruitiness, so many hops, and so little booziness...this brew simply disappeared from the glass with absolutely no effort on my part. if you want to introduce a friend to the world of double ipas, this is your gateway...i loved drinking this brew.

A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with two fingers of dense white head. Good retention, decent lacing.

Picked up a few bottles, opened the first with a friend. Poured into a tulip. Pours an absolute crystal clear pale orange with a large rocky white head on top. Retained well and left bits of lace stuck to the glass. Huge amounts of citrus in the nose - pineapple, grapefruit, mango, honeysuckle. The aroma is so sweet and fresh. Wow. I'd love to scent my home with this. 
Crisp, clean mouthfeel. Great carbonation really drives the flavor in this one. A wallop of fresh citrus washes over the palate. Grapefruit, passionfruit, orange - with a really sweet finish. Bitterness is there, but this is so fresh and flavorful, that the bitterness is tamed down in a way. This is dangerously drinkable. One of the best DIPAs I've had the pleasure of having. Keep sending these to NC!! 834 charactersOnenote81, Apr 24, 2013

pour is a tangerine tinted gold. Nice a clear. Finger of white head fading quickly, but lots of lovely lacing.
Nose is everything I could ever want in a DIPA. Sticky, citrus sweetness with that lovely hint of pine. Really quite perfect.
Taste is just as incredible. Citrus forward, with grapefruit, mango, and honey with a lovely floral component. Follows by perfect hoppy bitterness, with lovely pine resin stank. 
Mouth feel is pretty spot on, but just a tad thinner than I would want to go along with the flavors.
Awesome beer. So fresh and clean. If Stone keeps doing this, it's worth buying every time.
9.13.13 batch
So glad it's back in ct!  Beautiful pour. Nose is soo insanely juicy. Mango. Tangerine. Cantaloupe. Flavor is super citrusy up front but bigger hop on the end. Seems a little more dry and less sticky than my last batch. Regardless, heavenly. 887 charactersdheacck11, Apr 23, 2013

Pours a bright gold with a huge white head into my glass. It looks like it would tingle the taste buds and probably more. 
Grassy and full of citrus notes from the hops. West coast! The only other thing I can think of that's hoppier than this is Heady.
Wow. Very pleasant and bursting with juicy hop goodness. Citrus, pine, etc. Mango? Either way, it doesn't disappoint in the hops dept.
Lingering grassy, citrus and pine flavors. Like freshly-mowed grass. Very fresh too. I assume it's the 2nd most recent batch (bottle says 4/12/13). 
Stone should keep doing this with limited batches of beer. It might make more sense and cut back on the beer that lingers on shelves for months. They have the beer dating thing down pat and detailed info on the batches. 853 charactersBrad007, Apr 22, 2013

Aroma was an overpowering citrus- grapefruit especially, with some floral coming through as well. 
Mouthefeel is a standard body and carbonation for a typical ale. 
Taste is amazing - hops up front then a bit of sweetness, and similar to the aroma a big grapefruit element. The finish seems to be clean but then a nice bitter bite closes it out. 
Overall this is a fantastic DIPA, prob in my top 5. I need to get my hands on another bottle this week if I can--absolutely a great fresh brew. 613 charactersmaxcoinage, Apr 22, 2013
4.09/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Picked up a 05.17.13 bottle and drank it on 04.21.13. This beer is insanely hoppy. Nine different types of hops ( super galena extract, motueka, citra, cascade, simcoe, delta, amarillo, nelson sauvin, and galaxy) were used during the hop bursting and dry hopping process. Amazing bitterness and hop characteristics. 
A - A light, golden ale with lots of carbonation. A decent 2 finger foamy head that dissipates quickly. Foamy coats the glass very nicely.
S - Lots of earthy, grass aromas next to some fruity citrus flavors. A little sweet, but mostly bitter wheat aromas.
T - Quite bitter, but what do you expect from such a fresh IPA? Some sweet undertones that hint at a very slightly burnt chocolate taste. Kind of strange coming from an IPA, but tastes great.
M - Very thin and lots of bubbles hitting the tongue. Coats the throat, but leaves a huge presence in the mouth after swallowing (that's what she said. Am I allowed to say that here?)
O - This beer laces the glass like no other. Very bitter, but not quite as hoppy as expected. It's bitterness is at 88 IBUs, which is pretty high, but I've definitely had bitter-er (is that a word?) beers. Overall a great IPA, but I feel a little disappointed considering the amount of effort it took to hunt it down (in Chicago, the place where rare beers can easily be found if you look in the right places). Either way, if I ever see it again, I'd pick it up, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find. Cheers. 1,465 charactersoN3xM, Apr 22, 2013

Beer poured the clearest of light orange with a decent white head. The clarity is quite good.
Nose is primarily citrus.
Taste is fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with some mango. Finish leaves a lingering pine flavor.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonated moderately.
Overall an excellent brew. This is very close to being right out of the tap the freshness is that good. A tough brew to track down but definitely worth chasing! 516 charactersarizcards, Apr 21, 2013

I figured since the hop is a cousin of the cannabis, a very fresh IPA was a very appropriate beer for me to enjoy on 4/20/13. Poured into my Stone Arrogant Bastard pint glass, this batch of this beer poured a clear medium golden color, certainly much clearer than the other 2 batches of this beer that I have had the pleasure to drink. Initially with lots of little bubbles rising up to the surface of the beer and a white head about an inch thick initially when poured that settled pretty quickly to a nice medium sized ring lining the inside of the glass along with some swirls of foam here and there covering the beer's surface. Decent lace, but I do also notice that the head retention and lace aren't as good with my serving of batch # 7 as they were with the other 2 batches of this beer that I've drank. Crisp aromas of piney and citrus hops and some nice floral notes as well. Has the nice aforementioned and very fresh piney and citrus resinous hops along with a nice slightly toasted caramel malt flavor. Also has hints of brown sugar, mango, and honey. Very nice and a bit of a different flavor profile from the other 2 batches of this beer that I drank. Has a somewhat crisp and smooth, chewy, somewhat oily, medium to full bodied mouth feel with moderate carbonation. This one really coats the inside of the mouth nicely and doesn't leave any time soon. Very drinkable for a 9.4% ABV beer. Excellent!
Below is my second review of this beer written on 4/13/2013 for batch # 5 
ST bottle A-4 S-4.5 T-4.75 MF- 4.5 O-4.75
Re-reviewing this because I am drinking batch # 5. So, even though I did not enjoy this bottle of this batch of Enjoy By by the enjoy by date of 4/01/2013 and am drinking it 12 days late, I think I am still in for an awesome beer drinking experience here Poured out of a bomber into my snifter, this beer pours a clear, but slightly cloudy/hazy, deep medium golden color with a slight copper hue when held up to the light. has a white head about 1 1/4 inch thick when poured that settles fairly quickly to a nice thick white ring lining the inside of my glass with a nice big swirl of foam that covers most of the beer's surface. Decent lacing. Aromas of citrus grapefruit, apricot, earthy hop bitterness, perhaps a hint of pineapple, rounded out with some malty caramel sweetness. Flavors of citrus grapefruit and apricot, earthy hop bitterness, and the hint of pineapple that is all rounded with with some slightly toasted, biscuity caramel malt undertones. Has a very crisp, yet somehow still somewhat smooth and even slightly creamy, full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Not the easiest beer to drink per say, but easy to drink in the way good beer ought to be!
Below is my initial review written on 10/31/2013 for batch # 2 of Enjoy By 11/09/12
ST: bottle A-4 S-4.5 T-4.5 MF-4.5 O-4.5
Poured into my tulip glass out of the bomber. This beer pours a fairly clear medium golden color with a white head that is about 2/3 inch thick when first poured. Surprisingly clear and light in color for a double IPA and for a beer from Stone. Head settles pretty quickly to a fairly thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with spotty little clusters of foam dotting the surface of the beer and a decent amount of lace lining the inside of the glass. I wish it had had better head retention. Aromas of potent piney, citrus, grapefruit hops along with touches of mango. Very nice! Has a nice citrus, piney, somewhat earthy hop bitterness upfront that gives way to some nice toasted caramel sweetness. Not as upfront with the hop bitterness as a lot of Stone's other beers are. This beer is incredibly smooth for a beer with 9.4 % ABV. Has a slightly crisp, smooth, and somewhat prickly, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Incredibly easy to drink for a 9.4% ABV beer. An excellent beer and I hope to somehow drink this again somehow!

eyes...
super nice and clean white head, sticky as hell bubbles cling like an ex, dark straw and crystal clear, just a trace of bubbles floating up, the head fades out pretty quickly, nothing much to look at...
nose...
hop cone. (period)
jeezus, pine sol bomb
flash bang of alpha almost to the point of acrid-ity, the malts exist but man are they fighting for air, you can also pick up a touch of the alcohol, really nice hop nose but sort of one note-ish
taste etc...
incredibly full mouthfeel, coats the tongue, all the mishaps in the nose are not problems here, this drinks really smooth but yet does remind you at the end that the ABV is right there, the bitterness is nice but not killing my taste buds, subtle carbonation with the weight really just makes this too damn silky, I really am reminded of when I first tried Ruination but this is much smoother but just as deadly, this really has a backbone to support the ABV and ridiculous use of hops, this keeps drawing you back in.
verdict?
sometimes beers are reputations only, this shows some really nice maturity in craft, there is some ways to go to a perfect brew... but man alive just the drinking phase of this one is damn skippy.. meaning? don't pass this one up, stone could by all means just sit on their ass, but they don't, and I respect that. They keep coming up to bat. 1,380 charactersEgo, Apr 21, 2013

An inch or so of white head caps the brew, and it slowly dissipates while leaving a ton of sticky lacing. Hops aromas burst from the glass. Citrus, pine resin, and freshly mowed grass provide a dominate hop presence in the nose, with just a touch of burnt toast providing any malty hints. Fruity citrus flavors, as well as caramel malt sweetness open up on the palate as floral hop flavors, and a bit of pine resin pull through the finish. The sweet malt flavors provide excellent balance. This amazingly fresh and tasty brew is medium in both body and carbonation. The next batch out is 5-17-13, get your hands on this amazing Imperial IPA!! 759 charactersphishsihq, Apr 21, 2013

Batch #7
Really pleasant fresh hop aroma with no sense of any harshness at all. Reasonable complex hop character-sweet fresh fruit is most forward and quite nice.
Brilliantly clear and not very dark for style. Solid gold. Dense rather white head not quite making an inch on a full bottle pour. 
A bit of excess shows in the flavor. Fortunately it mingles with other more pleasing flavors. Bitterness especially in the long finish. The complexity of the hop flavors a little harder to identify in the taste (little more of a mash of hop flavors , and while this is clearly a hop forward drink the pale malt foundation will be recognized.
Slightly lighter body than most in this style, but it's not an issue. Helps with drinkability. A nice smooth drink with carbonation that enhances the experience. Some warmth in the gut, but this drinks lighter than the alcohol would indicate.
This one, for me, is better than the sum of the parts. Not a "well blow me down" experience, but a very enjoyable beer. I really like the decreased intensity and it crosses into a complex big beer that drinks nicely.

I've had several batches and am enjoying this more than ever.  Any excess that I previously had exists no longer.  Smooth and rich, great hop aroma and flavor.  One of my favorites.  I've bumped up the scores. 1,420 charactersgarymuchow, Apr 21, 2013

Great hoppy, pine aroma, balance and you can truly taste the freshness. The alcohol is a bit high, but to me, the bottle is just the right amount for personal consumption. But, the price went up at our local wine store... I hope it's not going to get more expensive so I can hord a bunch of these without breaking my bank.
Enjoy By 05-17-13: What a nice IPA, crisp, perfect for a Spring day evening. Not technical, but just a note to say I enjoyed the beer. I'm surprised to find it in the local wine store, but they had a couple of cases that came in yesterday (unannounced, of course), so I grabbed a case and will finish it by the date. High ABV, so my score may be skewed. 739 charactersbcheng, Apr 21, 2013
4.44/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is for the 05/17/13 edition.
Nose: Pine resin front and center is joined by a burnt resin streak, with everything else taking a distant backseat. The rest of the balance goes to hints of brown sugar, orange peel, and honey. Palate: No surprise that pine resin dominates the attack but is also joined by bitter citrus and a hint of malty sweetness. Malt and bread notes form the mid-palate. Pine resin and bitter grapefruit linger on the finish.
Some 30 minutes after the initial pour, the added warmth has given the nose some sticky sweetness. At the outset, this DIPA was quite jagged and the pine resin quite pronounced. With some warmth, sweetness is more evident and things are more balanced overall. This really is quite good. 738 charactersgunpwdr, Apr 20, 2013

Appearance: Pours a bright and clear copper golden orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. About two fingers of white head that slowly fade into a thin creamy layer. Leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. 
Smell: A big and bold hoppy aroma with lots of citrus fruit and earthy pine. Strong ripe tropical citrus fruit presence upfront with big hints of grapefruit, orange, mango, pineapple, tangerine, papaya, melon, and lemon. Also some hints of spicy pine resin and earthy grassy hops. Some sweet malt in the background with hints of biscuit, caramel, and yeast. Also some hints of candy like sugar and honey. Very hop forward and juicy.
Taste: Like the smell hints, a big bitter taste of fresh hops with lots of citrus and pine. Big ripe citrus fruit taste with notes of grapefruit, orange, mango, tangerine, pineapple, melon, papaya, and lemon. Strong dank taste of pine resin. Earthy notes of grass. Some sweet malt in the background with notes of bready biscuit, grain, caramel, and yeast. There is some sweetness coming from a little candy sugar and honey like notes. Huge hop driven taste. Very good. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very juicy and oily. Very drying finish. Alcohol heat is hidden by the heavy bitter hops. 
Overall: A great West Coast imperial IPA. Very good taste of citrus and pine spice that is very fresh. 1,493 charactersMattyG85, Apr 20, 2013

This brew pours with a nice little foamy head and a caramel colored body. The aroma is sweet succulent hops; both very grassy and tropical, this brew can be smelled from across the room. The flavor just bursts with tropical hoppiness, the gamut is run from mangos and pears all the way to pineapple and all sorts of citrus. You get some of the cattiness that is found in Simcoe beers, so I wouldn't be surprised if that hop or a close relative was used. The mouthfeel is lighter than expected, especially for the ABV. I could drink way too much of this. 
One of the better DIPAS I've run across. Enjoy by IPA is an excellent example of the style, however, I find that this beer is difficult to come across. Nevertheless, if I see this beer again [with a different date of course, I'm sure this batch will be gone in 3 days], I will buy it. 858 charactersLiquidCucumber, Apr 20, 2013

This beer was bottled 1 week ago from today, and has made it from the brewery in SoCal to a shelf in my local beer shop in Atl, GA in 1 week. Not sure that has ever happened before!
A - Yellow golden hue with a tiny bit of clarity. Whats impressive here is the 3-4 fingers of head and lace left all over the glass!
S - Ok, this aroma is off the charts. Pine cone galore! Fresh hops. Almost burns your nose hairs off its so pungent. Beautiful
T - Like the smell, off the charts piny hops. Sweet, smooth, well balanced. Delicious! 
M - Oily and slick. Well carbonated.
O - A fresh hop lovers dream. Glad to have the last 2 series, after finding the 4.1.13 in NYC last month. 2 in a row have made it to ATL, hoping that trend continues! 775 charactersBeerDawgs, Apr 20, 2013

Pours an attractive golden straw color. Dense white head.
A very nice looking beer.
Smells of tropical fruits, pine, berries. 
Tastes of bitter hops. Bitter grapefruit, spicy, earthy hops. Some alcohol on the backend.
Mouthfeel is full without being too syrupy. Moderate to low carbonation.

Enjoy by 5.17.13 has finally landed in MN. This was bottled on 4.12.13 and consumed one week later - Extremely fresh. It pours a clear light gold body with a sizable head that lasts for a bit.
The nose brings on tons of fresh tropical fruit. It smells much like a Surly Abrasive Ale. Lots of pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, mango, sweet peaches, and a little bit of pine. The taste follows very nicely with potent tropical hops and lots of bitterness on the finish. Medium bodied and light carbonation. Unique in its own way. Fresh Stone FTW! 569 charactersmnphish, Apr 19, 2013

Clear, light amber color with two fingers of head that settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left down the glass.
To me this smells a little catty. Also pine tar, citrus, and dankness.
Dry, hoppy, and bitter. The hops are strong and taste fresh. Citrus, pine, and dank green flavor. Absolutely dry malt profile with little flavor of its own. Definitely putting the hops on display with this one. Alcohol is not detectable.
Medium body with really nice carbonation. Just about perfect for a beer like this.
This beer delivers the hop goods. Not sure if it is worth it or not. Worth a try at least once. 635 charactersmorimech, Apr 19, 2013

Pours a deep yellowish orange. Mostly clear, but looking through it, I can just make out my hand on the other side of the glass. One finger of almsot-white head, good retention, nice lacing. A thin stream of bubbles drifting up. Solid.
Smell is fantastic. Huge melon, grapefruit, and sweet orange. Impressively fruity, juicy and sweet. And it's smooth and full all the way through, with no holes, gaps, or sharp edges. Among the very best I've encountered. The only ones that might surpass it, in my experience, are Heady Topper, Abrasive, and Lagunitas Sucks. That is truly impressive company.
Taste is solid, but just kinda straight. A little sweet, drifting into half-chalky bitter. Not bad, but not all that flavorful. Balanced, with a little sweet and a little bit more bitter. But not a ton of positive flavors.
Mouthfeel is good. Medium-bodied, smooth and mouth-filling. A bit of stickiness. The carbonation is really nice, in a way that adds a lot to the beer. It starts out smooth and placid, then rises up in a rush of small bubbles, fuzzy, before drifting back down like a receding wave. Lasting, slowly fading away. Delightful.
A really good IPA, though it's mostly carried by the amazing smell. But I'm a sucker for aromatic IPAs, so I really dig it. If I could, I'd buy this regularly. 1,494 characterszeledonia, Apr 19, 2013

Rich golden body, excellent clarity, bone white head settles into a quarter inch of persistent foam leaves sheets of lace. Citrus rinds, pineapple, mango, lightly sweet and spicy nose. Taste is a blast of spicy, resin and citrus pith flavors heaped on all at once. Bitterness is pervasive with upwelling of sweet malts, further layers of mango, papaya and poneapples adding delicious flavor, balance and heft. The balance is just spectacular exactly right IMO for an IPA. Body is medium with a velvety creamy yet crisply carbonated mouthfeel. A moderate, spicy bitterness lingers and fades into the finish. Excellent, excellent. Very Delicious, and from Escondido to my glass in Minneapolis within 6 days.

Pours clear amber with a one finger bright white head, with good retention and lacing. The aroma is very tropical with grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and pine. 
The taste is just like the aroma. Both bitter and sweet with grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and pine. There is a small malt backbone, which is not very noticeable, but it is there.
Medium bodied, above average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. Finishes somewhat dry, and the 9.40 % abv is hidden very well. This is an excellent Imperial IPA, well worth waiting for. 550 charactershardy008, Apr 18, 2013

Appearance: Slight copper color, very clean looking body. Above average carbonation which was very active throughout. Just below a finger of head on the pour which was light and fluffy. Sticky lacing left on the glass while drinking. Enjoyed out of a tulip shaped glass. 
Smell: Extremely bright and fresh hops hit right away. There is a very strong malt backbone which became much more of a player as this beer warmed up a bit. Very rich syrupy tones provided great complexity for this aroma.
Taste: A touch of lemon, prairie grass, spices, and some sugary hops. The hops are light and exotic, much different then other DIPAs. The body takes a heavy turn and the malt backbone felt in the aroma comes in hard on the finish of this brew. The transition from light fresh bones to saturated malt is outstanding. Feels like two different beers. Some spices are also felt on the aftertaste along with waves of hops still hitting the palette.
Mouthfeel: Bubbly carbonation is light on the palette. A good mixture of dryness and sweetness. 
Overall: Little doubt at this point that these Best By IPAs by Stone are the real deal, no gimmicks here. Having this beer reminded me of my first experience with IPAs when I was getting into craft beer (the Stone IPA), felt like firecrackers going on in my mouth. So many things going here, just oustanding. Credit to Stone for continuing to be innovators in the field and just another example of their masterful craftsmanship. 1,539 charactersKFBR392, Apr 18, 2013

First thing I notice is the amazing clarity going on here. Seriously, it looks like a mass produced lager, which is a pretty amazing feat once you realize how much hopping it took to make this beer. Even has around 3/4" of head, white, on it, which again, is pretty amazing given all the hops/hop oil up in this.
Smell wasn't massively hoppy, it was good, but it didn't permeate my nose with tons of hops. Not a letdown, but didn't live up to the rest of the characteristics about the beer that blew me away.
Taste, hops are plenty noticeable, there's hardly a malt bill to it, but somehow, there is no alcohol heat, the bitterness is kept down, even though it seems to have plenty of Simcoe hops to it. I think there might be some Galaxy and Nelson/Mosaic around here too. Summit? Only if in small quantities, its far from a prime time player in this hop meld. Green apple hops, tropical mango. Its actually one of the most gentle double ipas I've ever had, and I mean that in a good way. Some pine and mint undercurrents to the hop flavors. Mouthfeel continues to impress, how does this taste so light and abv around only 5-6ish? Plenty dry as well. Must have used some sugar to dry this out and keep a light body, which it works quite well. Slightly grassy as it warms. Stayed away from heavy caramel. This one is biscuit light in terms of malt flavor and additions. 
This is one of the best double ipas bottled. I had mine on draft, but it caused me to go buy a bottle from the gift shop. 
Must try if you call yourself a hophead. 1,695 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Apr 17, 2013

A: Holy shit. The first thing I noticed was the clarity of this beer! It looks like a macro lager! A deep golden color with a solid white head. This beer could be used in billboards. This is what perfect IPAs look like in my head. 
S: A blend of tropical fruits and pine resin. Fresh mango, peach, pineapple. Lots of citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon). *Smelled very boozy towards the end. That was my fault though, I got distracted for a bit and let it warm up more than I wanted. Still great though. 
T: Huge hop bite! Citrus and pine flavors blend together perfectly. Some nice toasted malts to hold up those hops. Ends with a resinous bitterness that doesn't linger too long, just right. Alcohol is very well hidden. 
M: Light/medium bodied. Nice, medium carbonation. Great for the style. 
O: A relatively easy to find, widely distributed IIPA that happens to be one of the best I've tried? Yes that sounds like a winner to me. 973 charactersstandardcherry, Apr 17, 2013

A - Pours a beautiful crystal clear light honey color with a perfect 3 finger white head with great retention. Great lacing in this beer as well.
S - Amazing smelling beer. I got a huge aroma of orange right of the bat followed by other citrus like grapefuit and lemon. There is also a slightly floral smell to the beer. Not much in the way of malts or grains aromas.
T - Wow, big citris punch. Orange and grapefruit right up front followed with a piney betterness. THe hops are perfect in this beer. Interestingly enough, at first I could not detect any malts, but as the beer warmed I was able to pick up more and more of the caramel malts. 
M -Medium bodied beer that feels both spicy and zesty. Still, its a very smooth easy drinking beer for 9.4 ABV
O - Great job Stone Brewing. I'll be seeking this beer out with each release date. Its a very easy sipping double IPA. Doesnt get much better! 966 charactersGoosehunter75, Apr 15, 2013

Appearance: Pours a light golden honey color. This beer is ultra-clear and not hazy in the slightest. 1/2 inch white head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring.
Aroma: Very fruity. Smells of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, light hint of pine and leather, big citrus notes, finally a slight bready/biscuity aroma.
Taste: Oily hop resin, piney, big citrus, almost an earthy/woody taste. It's spicy, herbal, and quite dank.
Mouthfeel: A medium-body. Light and dry with a slightly peppery finish with loads of delicious bitterness that coats my mouth for a few seconds before disappearing.
Overall: This beer masks its 9.4% ABV very well. Dangerously drinkable for a double IPA. And for a 10 day old bottled beer? That's a great win for fresh beer as time is usually not the friend of IPA's. This beer is quite delicious and I had the foresight to purchase 2 more bottles. The aroma of this Stone beer is just phenomenal. 1,050 charactersClonies720, Apr 12, 2013

The aroma is hoppy, shocker. Big grapefruit scent with some pepper and a touch of tropical fruit, mainly pineapple.
The taste is fairly grassy but still has some notes of grapefruit. Some tropical fruit notes but not too sweet, which is good. A bit peppery and earthy. The malt base is a touch bready but mainly sits in the background. A nice hoppy beer but it probably faded a bit.
Moderate feel with fizzy carbonation. Bitter on the palate but not in a crushing way. Its a big beer but its not sticky or thick.
Enjoy By was enjoyable, wish I could of had it fresher. Good hop profile with a nice light malt base. 798 charactersGmann, Apr 08, 2013

A golden hazy hello color with a few carbonation bubbles rising to the top , a pretty white 2 finger head with lacing sticking to the sides of the glass and hanging on through the whole glass
The first thing I smell is the hops , then some sweet malt then a little bit of booze on the end. The hop smell has a faint citrus smell to me but not over powering 
This beer goes down smooth and is very refreshing. Not too much carbonation and not to heavy on the tounge , every thing is just right
The taste is really complex , not too bitter , starts off with a hoppy flavor with the malty sweetness hitting in the middle with the booze finishing off at the end , not too sweet , not too hoppy and the booze isn't too over powering. This is a really great beer and I will be buying more of it 844 charactersubenumber2, Apr 07, 2013

S - Wow, smells amazing. A great hop hit, with great grapefruit and mango accents. A little pine and malt there for good measure. It reminds me of Sucks a little. 
T - More of the same. An great hop blast, with wonderful citrus throughout. 
M - Crisp, light bodied and leaves a dry palate. It is smooth despite it's higher ABV. 
O - The last batch (and first) I had of this was back in December and it really surprised me. This batch did exactly the same. This beer is amazing. Fresh, easy to drink and well balanced. Well done Stone. 689 charactersdrrone, Apr 05, 2013

From a bomber into a snifter
04.01.2013 
Review is from notes kids... 
APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium looking, fluffy white head with good retention. Perfectly clear gamboge orange, though more amber when held to the light, with lower levels of carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a wisp and sticks to the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp remains and leavs some dots of lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Lots of citrus, grapefruit, lemon and orange peel on the nose. Floral elements with some melon and a touch of caramel. Really bold and heavy on the citrus and grapefruit quality. Nice stuff. 
TASTE: Lots of pine, grapefruit, lemon and citrus flavors for sure. Floral and piney bitterness at the swallow with a big but dry finish of bitter citrus and floral hops, pine and a touch of caramel sweetness. The hops are great and it's very flavorful, though I'd appreciate a slightly bigger malt profile as balance. Still very enjoyable. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes dry. Good feel. 
OVERALL: Another good IPA from Stone. This is a fun series and I ask myself whether any of the collectors are putting together verticals of this bad boy. I would like to see a little more malt presence here so as to add another dimension to the beer, but the hop profile is quite lovely as the centerpiece anyways. High quality and would gladly drink again. Cheers vissai. 1,509 charactersJeffo, Apr 03, 2013

Poured from a 22 oz bomber into an oversize wine glass. Purchased in North Attleboro, MA.
A- Pours an ever so slightly hazy deep gold body with a 2 finger white head that reduces fairly quickly but leaves some foam behind. Small lacing.
S- The second you take a whiff of this beer you can tell why they want you to enjoy it fresh. It smells SO fresh and tropical, the hops are really at work here. Fresh mango, apricots, pineapple, grapefruit, citrus, and after a while a hint of booze. Really amazing. 
T- Huge hop bomb the second it hits your tongue - citrus, grapefruit, clementines, all play together to create a masterpiece of bold flavors, which develop into a subtle resinous bitterness that doesn't stick around too long, the finish is smooth. The only thing preventing this beer from getting a 5/5 is that it is lacking the creamy, malty, caramel finish of the one and only Heady Topper. Very very little booze detected for 9.4% abv
M- Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Pretty drinkable for such a bold brew.
Stone has really outdid themselves with this beer. In my opinion,  this beer deserves a spot at the top. The hop presence is bold and intense, but not cloying. They work intricately to create a balanced and tasty beer. 1,293 charactersgcamparone, Apr 02, 2013

Bottle (5/17/13 on 4/21) to DFH IPA glass
A: Light golden orange color with a off white head and plenty of carbonation. It is also very clean as there is nothing in it and it is completely translucent what a traditionalist might look for in a DIPA but i like it cloudy with hops though I will not hold anything against the cleanness. 
S: Well there are definitely plenty of fresh hops in there. In this batch the smell is floral mostly and very clean but there are notes of pine there though it is not too resinous smelling. The hops smell is pretty much dominant, but that is what I expect. It is different then the others I've tried that where more citrusy this beer has none of that.
T: These are not typical hops or at least they are different from the other releases, they have a very bitter hop bite without a lot of resin and is extremely clean. This bite however is powerful and stays on your tongue for almost 30 seconds after one sip. Other then the hop flavor there is not much else there , but the hop bitterness has a significant amount of depth as it unbitters.
M: There is a little resin that stays on the tongue but it is mostly that your pallet is just assaulted with bitterness as this is a palate wrecker for sure. With that being said it is also thick but very watery and clean as can be though the thickness does effect the drinkability it still goes down pretty easily while disguising all of the 9.4% abv so that is impressive.
O: This version is different from the others and have to say i prefer the citrus juicy hops but this beer is very good. The most impressive aspect is definitely how clean it looks, tastes, and feels it is competitive with the big boys like pliny but not as good for sure. It is however a very solid DIPA if you enjoy palate wrecking hop bitterness definitely try this but if IPAs aren't your thing stay away and drink it fresh as this is gonna be a malt bomb fast. 1,938 charactersPinknuggets, Apr 02, 2013

Honestly to see all the hype I am disappointed in this beer. Don't get me wrong this is def a good beer, but I'm not buying into this brewed to be extra fresh crap. The beer pours average, no exciting appearance, nothing special with the head. The aroma is quite unique though. It has the basics of a West Coast IPA but more, there seems to be tons of varieties of hops, very complex. This strong hop flavor makes you forget it's over 9% abv. Although I appreciate all these hops, I feel like they could have been chosen differently to better compliment each other. All in all my opinion breaks down to this. Every other type of IPA I have had from Stone Brewing has been better than this beer, and they are all half the price. I was super excited to try this been and unfortunately I was disappointed. Save your money and buy the original Stone IPA, it is the better way to go. 909 charactersvicg12, Apr 01, 2013

Appearance. Pours a rich but clear gold with a finger of white head. Decent lace, but nothing spectacular.
Smell. Beautiful pine and lucious tropical fruits. Mango, pineapple, papaya, limes and grapefruit. There's some toasty grainy malt backing it up, but this smells like it brings the goods in the west coast style hop department.
Taste. Big juicy hops again. Lots of tropical fruit, grapefruit rind, oranges, pine sap, spicy hops, grassy hops, and some nice toasted grainy malt backing it up ...but not too much. The full range of hop flavours is here and not in a overdone sort of way. Nice bitterness in the finish as well and very fresh tasting, as expected. 
Mouthfeel. Medium+ body, medium-low smooth carbonation. 
Overall. A pretty awesome IPA. If you like hops and lots of 'em, this beer doesn't disappoint. 941 charactersRutager, Apr 01, 2013

Appearance - Clear amber with an average size fizzy off-white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some decent lacing. The head lasted for around 4 minutes.
Smell - Hops, malts, grapefruit, resin, apricots
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste caramel, malts, and hops. There is also some grapefruit and some pineapple mixed with apricots and a bit of booze. It ends with a resiny/hoppy above average bitterness.
Overall – This beer packs a punch in both booze and hops. It's missing just a bit of the limp smacking sweetness that I find in Sculpin/pliny, but it's still a world class beer for sure. There is no reason to buy ruination if this is sitting on the shelf as well. 816 charactersspinrsx, Apr 01, 2013

A- Beautiful thick apricot gold color, initially cloudy, but clears up after pour. A 1/4"-1/2" bubbly, foamy white head that sticks around for a while. As the beer sloshes around in the snifter a fine bubbly film trails down the sides of the glass
S- The smell of this is wonderful! It's fresh. It's Clean. I smell fresh juicy hops, some sugar, some caramel. The hops are not piney and not really grapefruit-like, but remind me of the mandarin oranges I used to eat out of the can when I was a kid. Also I am reminded of the smell of the shell of a candy apple.
T- Much like the smell, the first sip, a ZINGER as my taste buds go wild! Floral hops, mandarin oranges. This beer is only a few weeks old, so it is SO fresh. As it warms, I get a bit of sugar, some estery caramel hoppyness which is unique but out of this world tasty. As I proceed with my servings I aggressively agitate the beer in my mouth and pick up some subtle coriander and chamomile. 
O- Overall this is one of the best imperial IPA's I have ever had. I bought an 8 oz. snifter of the 04/20/13 on tap at a restaurant earlier this year on a whim and I loved it. This is the first time I had it since then and perhaps the first IIPA I have had since then as well. This beer is surprisingly refreshing and the alcohol is hidden very well. It CAN NOT BE TASTED AT ALL! For a brew approaching 10% that is very impressive. I have had some really HOT brews at 9-10%. Not this beer. I strongly recommend this to hop heads and anyone who is a craft beer aficionado in general as this is not a harsh IIPA. Bold, vivid in flavor-yes, but not harsh in alcohol or hops whatsoever-a WORLD CLASS BEER! 1,778 charactersmitch3114, Mar 31, 2013

Pours a nice shade of peach. Head is a finger thick of bright white bubbles. Lacks some retaining, but leaves a decent lace behind.
Nose is pretty remarkable. Pine, orange, grapefruit and pineapple combine for an amazing party.
Taste follows the nose...pine, orange, grapefruit and pineapple are still partying. Enough biscuity backbone to hold up to the hops. 
Normally a DIPA like this would destry my palate, but this one actually brings it to life. There's sweetness from the orange and grapefruit, acidity from the grapefruit, and bitterness from the hops. The bitterness is prevalent, but very welcomed. The sweet and acid almost completly balance each other for a smoothness not normally found in something of this style. The alcohol is well hidden.
Overall, it's a pretty kick ass beer. Gives Pliny a run for it's money, and might even be better. 870 charactersRickS95, Mar 31, 2013

The aroma has lots of orange and grapefruit citrus, plus pine and caramel malt. 
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is creamy with light to moderate carbonation. The flavor begins with hops, mainly orange citrus and pine. The middle has sweet malty notes of caramel and bread. It finishes moderately bitter with an earthy grassy flavor. Once gone the caramel and orange citrus lingers on the palate.
I like the idea of this beer suggesting a 'fresh by' date. I just made it with the bottle I had. 672 charactersWanderingFool, Mar 30, 2013

A - Insanely clear, pilsner or scotch coloring. Frothy, thin, eggshell head. Fair soapy lacing and retention with prominent alcohol legs.
S - Rich sap, pine leaves, prune, Meyer lemon, naval orange, perfume, and huge grassy herbaceous character.
T - I don't want to half-ass here, but everything exactly as prescribed in the nose in complete balance. 
M - Medium body, appropriate carbonation, dry and quick finish.
D - I'm almost at a loss for words that Stone has produced something so fucking good. Normally, they drive a lot of hype that is deserved for a larger micro but a bit over the top in perspective of the industry. This is worthy of every praise and is in my top 2 for most drinkable DIPA's I've ever had. Wow.
Edit - I had a considerable amount of the 05.17.13 bottling, and it's not quite as excellent. Still more than worthwhile especially at this pricepoint.
Edit #2 - Revisiting my original review a year later with the 04.20.14 bottling. More dank and herbs and just fabulous melding of flavors. Upticking a few points. 1,176 charactersAuracom, Mar 29, 2013
4.71/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours from the growler a orange hay color. Looks somewhat clear but viscus. Lacing is pretty nice as the one finger head dissipates. Great looking beer and very inviting. 
Smell really sets this off. Tropical, pine and grapefruit, with melon and slightly sweet caramel notes.
Tastes of a tropical fruit and piney/peppery note mixed with a subtle herbal quality. Fantastic notes of pineapple, grapefruit, grass, and what I believe to be a slight peppery saison feel. Mouthfeel is almost perfect with it's fair amount of carbonation and sweet viscosity. The roundness keeps this from being overly drinkable for the abv.
Overall, this is one of the best double IPA's on the market. And the fact it's label alone keeps it fresh is great. 736 characterslsummers, Mar 29, 2013

Body is just a perfect tone of liquid gold in tone. Head is a thick fluffy two fingers of off white rocky foam. It has nice retention and fades leaving random waves of lace. Nose is bright and invigorating with notes of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine resin. The pineapple plays big time with the first sip yielding a big juicy citrus based profile. This really is a beer that I could drink all night, so easy its scary for 9.4% alcohol. Just the right amount of bitter, flavor and balance makes this a wonderful IPA. I really cant wait to get more of this next time it comes around. 603 charactersSPLITGRIN, Mar 29, 2013

A: Medium head dissipates somewhat after the original pour, but the light head that remains has very good retention. Incredible lacing. Extremely clear - probably one of the clearest ales I've ever seen. The color is very inviting - an amber/golden affair with a tinge of orange that looks just delicious. I rarely give out "5"s in any category for any beer, but this beer absolutely deserves a 5 for appearance.
S: Others have commented on the resin nose on this beer, but the batch I drank (4.20) is much more fruity than resiny. I get alot of tropical fruits - pineapple, mango, grapefruit and a little hint of lemon. There's a little pine going on in the background, as well as some slightly floral notes. Powerful aroma overall. Much fruitier than I expected. 
T: Initial taste is more subdued than you would expect. Floral and fruity with a hint of bitterness but not the overpowering hop flavor that you would expect from a DIPA. That is, before the pine and grassy flavors really kick in mid-sip. As expected, lingering piney bitterness remains on the tongue well after drinking. A decent - not exceptional - malt backbone on this. 
M: Surprisingly full for an IPA during drinking. Must be some Special B in this sucker. Finish is dry dry dry. 
O: I am definitely not a hop-head but I had to try this beer after hearing so much about it. Overall, I'm happy with it. What impresses me the most is the complicated hop flavor of this beer. Most DIPA's are strongly bitter....and that's it. This beer, while definitely bitter, is not nearly as harshly bitter as most DIPAs. The hop characteristic in particular is more complex than expected - fruity and floral with a nice resin base. I find DIPAs disappointingly one-note - I think this is the first that I would buy again. Nice job Stone. 1,889 charactersMighHighBrewer, Mar 29, 2013

T: Resiny, fresh hops are the first impression. There is a modest foundation of biscuity caramel malt, but it's overwhelmed by piney, grapefruity hops. Some earthiness and spiciness as well. Finishes with lingering resiny pine bitterness.

Beer is golden in colour with a fair-sized white head. Pretty good retention, very good lace.
Lots of citrus and tropical fruit scents in the nose. Grapefruit, passionfruit, papaya, a hint of pineapple. Sticky. 
Beer tastes like an amped-up Stone IPA. Hop focused with a strong citrus flavour. Grapefruit, orange and some tropical fruit flavours: passionfruit sticks out, but there is plenty happening. Finish is a bit spicy and piney, some white pepper. Malt is very low- beer seems to be all hops, with a minimal malt presence. Very nice.
Medium to full bodied, oily, strongly carbonated. A fair bit of alcohol heat.
Overall, really good. Glad I got to try this one. 692 charactersjrenihan, Mar 28, 2013

4.51/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy By 2.14.14 is easily the best batch of this beer that I have had the pleasure of having. I'm not exactly sure how much of this has to do with me getting it a mere two weeks since it was bottled (and about six days since it arrived in stores), since I had the other two batches I've gotten my hands on a little later than that. Perhaps there's something to do with recipe variation...Who knows. All I can say is, I am blown away by how complex this batch is: incredibly juicy and aromatic and the carbonation and mouthfeel are super spot-on. And where is that alcohol!? Hats off to Stone, the standard bearer of hoppy beer.

Finally I have my hands on the much sought after Stone Enjoy By IPA. Very excited to get this into a glass and see what all the hype is about. The specific batch I'm reviewing is Enjoy By 4/1/13 and I consumed it on 3/20/13. I would have loved to drink it sooner, but I'm sure it's still in excellent condition. 
Appearance (4.25/5): Pours a nearly clear orange-copper color. Two fingers of white head on a moderate pour. Decent head retention. Plenty of sticky, resinous lacing clings to the sides of my DFH signature snifter. This is what I want my IPA's to look like. 
Smell (4.5/5): Nose is super hoppy–dank pine aromas rise from the glass, with citrus pine and tropical fruit adding that mixture of fruit sweetness and bitter twang. Actually quite balanced for a beer billed as a palate destroyer. Smells incredibly fresh and really reminds me of fresh Union Jack IPA in that there's a nice touch of malt sweetness alongside the grapefruit and dank pine going on here. 
Taste (4.5/5): This one starts out sweet and then the hops explode...Tropical fruit flavors of passion fruit and tangerine come on in the beginning to open up the tongue with some nice sweeter hop flavors before giving way in the middle to huge, bitter pink grapefruit and pine flavors. That quintessential West Coast hope profile is here but amped up considerably. Excellent flavors here; nothing super complicated tasting, just very well executed. No alcohol in the flavor, so kudos to the brewers on masking the high ABV well.
Mouthfeel (4.75/5): The most remarkable thing about this beer is its bone dry finish. I am not sure if I've ever had an IPA whose finish mimics the aftertaste of grapefruit so well, and I love it. The dryness invites you to go back for another sip, and there's no problem with that–this beer is very drinkable. Carbonation is medium–right where it should be–and body is medium. Great feel all around.
Overall (4.5/5): I really love this beer and would gladly buy 10 more bottles of it if I could. It's what fresh IPA is all about–the bitterness, the citric bite, the dry finish, the drinkability and refreshing qualities...they're all here in spades. I would love to have this beer even earlier in its life. Maybe next time a batch comes to Illinois or Massachusetts. Until next time, remember friends: drink it fresh. 2,972 charactershagbergl, Mar 27, 2013

What a delightful beer- I really love the whole idea of the lengths they've gone to encourage freshness in an IPA. Nothing like a fresh IPA! Wonderful delicate floral aroma with some citrus blossom and a touch of floral honey. The taste is beautifully balanced with citrus, floral, herbal, and a touch of pine in the finish. Vibrant and fresh tasting with just enough sweetness to keep things zippy. A touch soft, but just a great beer all around. 473 charactersGeorgiabeer, Mar 24, 2013

A - Pours a very clear golden color. Light white head formation, gone quickly. Little lacing.
S - lightly resinous, not overly overt hop aroma. Has the diesel fuel scent which I normally associate with simcoe. 
T - Starts off lightly hoppy, a little bit dank and earthy. Turns more strong, pine, resin, and evil those super dank diesel fuels. Finishes with more of those hefty hops, almost balanced but certainly bitter. 
M - Moderate body and a stronger carbonation, light and frothy. Oily and tongue grabbing texture from the hops. No alcohol warmth.
O/D - A very worthy beer. Hides its strong nature very well. Certainly accentuates the fresh hops. Not sure it brings out anything new for me however. 721 characterskatan, Mar 23, 2013

Poured a brilliantly white head that after several minutes faded to a think solid layer but with good lacing. 
The smell on this batch seems to be a little less piney/resiny and more subtly fruity. Very pleasant. 
The taste is certainly pinier than the smell lets on and lets you know again its a double IPA you're drinking. 
The mouthfeel is very smooth.
Overall, this a great double, but as they stress on the bottle, it's always best the sooner you drink it.

4.65/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy by 4/20. Bomber to a snifter, really high expectations 
Pours a deep gold, perfect balance between yellow and orange with a finger of foam that has some impressive retention. Beautiful transparency and very little carbonation. Nice sticky lacing, five minutes now and almost all the head is still there. I can't find any faults with it 
Aroma of strong hops with a powerful grapefruit back bone. Lemon and lime zest pick through along with a nice earthy pine and some grass. Malts are well disguised yet present, sweet bread along with a touch of caramel. A little bit of alcohol comes through on the finish, everything comes together pretty well
Taste- follows the nose well, straight forward hop bomb with a strong grapefruit along with other citrus esters, lime really coming through for me. The malts through in the middle, sweeter than I was expecting but balancing the bitterness well. The end leaves a nice after taste of alcohol and citrus
The feel is pretty good also, very crisp and even with a solid medium body. There's some heat on the way down, as is expected at 9.4% and a week old which is pleasantly warming. Very dry and sticky finish, everything hold up with the rest of the beer
Overall this stuff wasn't quite what I was expecting, but pretty good anyway, as are all of Stone's brews. Working in shipping, I can appreciate the logistics of the beers concept, but wouldn't advise ordering one for 10$ (and then $20 for shipping) online like I did. I'm not sure it will ever come to my region, so I'll probably have to start trading if I want another, in which case I'd recommend it.

Gold, bright orange in appearance. 
The nose is strong over the top pine and citrus.
I am reviewing the 4-1-13 batch and I have to say its the best so far, much more balanced out then previous ones, this time around it was scary how smooth it was. Mango, peach, citrus, 30 minutes later I was still tasting it in the back of my mouth. 
Medium body but extremely smooth 
Overall it seems that every batch just gets better and better I have not gotten my hands on the latest 4-20-13 batch but I have one bottle of the 4-1-13 batch that I'm saving for the day before the enjoy by date to really wait to the last minute to see how much it changes.

22oz bottle poured into a large mug
This is an extremely pretty beer. Pours a clear, rich golden with a coppery tint, beautiful head that fades slowly and appears to be sheeting the sides of the glass, lots of continuous carbonation action. Smell is fresh, grassy, clean, honeysuckle and flowers, citrus.
Taste is sweet, bready up front with a deep bitter backbone, pine and grapefruit zest.
Mouthfeel is thick, slightly chewy, slightly sticky, but not cloying. I might call it creamy. Overall, this is an excellent beer.

Appearance- Perfectly clear golden color. Two fingers of off-white, peanut color head. 
Smell- Floral citrus explosion. Smells like a wet cellar (Good is this case). Grapefruit, lots of pine needles. 
Taste- Punch of hops in the front and back of the tongue almost at the same time. Big grapefruit and pine in the middle. Finishes super dry with an underlying sweetness. 
Mouthfeel- It hits you hard with hops and finishes dry like an IPA should, but with an underlying citrusy sweetness. 
Overall- Very well balanced. The freshness is so apparent. All the flavors are so vibrant and pronounced. It feels like the flavors are wrestling in your mouth for your attention. Your mouth tingles with hoppy bitterness after. Dare I say my favorite IPA. . . so far. 780 charactersRyFikes, Mar 21, 2013

A: Pours a nearly clear golden/orange color. A two finger white head forms with good retention. Lots of lace is left behind.
S: Citrus, resiny pine, grapefruit. Spicy, peppery aromas in the nose. I am surprised by the simplicity here, though enjoyable. A bitterness lingers on.
T: Follows the nose with a clean citrus and slightly resiny flavor. A lingering bitterness. Again, I am a bit surprised by Stones restraint. Something they are not known for.
M/D: A medium to full body, Crisp carbonation. Very clean and dry as well. For the alcohol and hoppyness this is very easy to drink. I can have a few easily.
I am as surprised as anyone when I say this is rather muted. Certainly a good citrus, piny hop kick. Though not near what I was expecting from Stone. Which to me is a good thing. That, or Stone is responsible for dulling even the stingiest of non hop heads tastes. Joking aside, this is a good beer. 988 characterschamp103, Mar 21, 2013

T: Tasted of hops, a good amount of alcohol, citrus (grapefruit especially), malt, and a bit of pine as well. As it is with all good DIPAs, this one has a very complex flavor. Extremely powerful and tasty.

Fantastic beer! This light colored ale poured a thin head and had light lacing. The beer reamins true to its American IPA/Double IPA style with a strong hop smell and pronounced hop taste. Stone asks that the beer be enjoyed while it is still fresh, but I wonder how might age. 
My only disappointment was that the liquor store limited sales to just one bottle per customer. My bottle was gone in a flash. 449 characterslazy8, Mar 20, 2013

 Appearance is very nice in this double IPA at 9.4 abv.Pours somewhat cloudy body, with a thick lacing 2 finger head; shiny penny tone(new copper).Smells of "sour-diesel"/piney scent. Nice fresh aroma of hops bitter notes. Skunky in flavor up front, with cherry and white grapes on the stringent finish. Pine-tar like consistency on the palate, and a lingering hoppy dry,almost rubber essenece on the finish. Overall, I like this hop bomb, from one of the Masters in the game.

A: This beer was a super clear light yellow gold. When the sun light hit it, it had a slight glow to it. Really beautiful beer in the glass. It had the nice clarity that Pliny the Elder has. Had a nice bubbly finger thick head that dissipated with a little time, and left nice lacing on the glass.
S: Very hoppy, obviously. Reminded me of Ruination a bit. Very herbal and floral is what hit me first on the nose. Piney, resinous, and slightly sweet follow. Not much malt in the nose. The hops are really the star players here in the smell department. 
T: Again everything above describes the taste as well. Very herbal and really floral with the taste. Nice bitter bite up front, from the pine. Lots of grapefruit and citrus on the way down. Those were the only tropical fruits I could pick out. This one seemed to stay with the earthy, herbal, floral, grassy flavors that hops impart. Also the malty sweetness really started to come out as the beer warmed up. The balance of sweetness to bitterness really came alive as this one warmed up. 
M: Smooth and easy drinking for a 9.4% ABV. The alcohol was really there because I was feeling it after the whole bottle, but never noticed it while drinking it. Just a really clean drinking experience. 
O: I'm glad that I purchased two of these and looking forward to having it again. This, for me, was really a stand out of all the Stone beers that I have had over the years. Well done, and cheers to Stone. Keep sending them to Texas. 1,532 charactersandys_war_hall, Mar 19, 2013

A - This brew arrives a plae gold hue with a thin lacey bubbly ring that sticks to the glass. 
S - Hoppy hoppy hoppy! Very big on the floral hops, spilling into the pine part of the hop spectrum, but mainly floral. Some candied sugar background gives it a balanced aroma. 
T - More hops than in the aroma, didn't think that was possible. Floral and piney and piney and floral. This beer is hoppily delicious. The candied sugar didn't back down, its their forcing in some awesome balance. Its kind of an unflavored rock candy taste. 
M&D&O - Yes! More please! A fantastic DIPA. Hop bombs like this rarely have this kind of balance. Try this if you can. 716 characterssinstaineddemon, Mar 19, 2013

Look- Clear medium amber with two fingers of dense frothy eggshell head. Decent lacing, good retention.
Smell- Standard profile but well executed. Honey, biscuit, fir needles, mint. Bubblegum in the background. Swirling brings out a more resinous aroma.
Taste- Similar to the nose, but calmer. Strongly reminds me of Nugget Nectar. Floral, pine throughout, orange blossom honey, lingering grapefruit pith and modest bittering. 
Mouthfeel- Full, chewy, medium carbonation. Light prickle, on the whole a substantial feel- on the hefty side.
Overall- I had this on tap about a week ago and enjoyed it much more than I'm feeling this bottle at the moment- I'm thinking it's just a bit undercarbonated. As it sits it's a better-than-average DIPA and it's well marketed, but it's just not capturing my attention. High price point, not quite as good as the Nugget leaves me wishing for more. Worth trying, nice to see a national release like this. I'd probably buy it again. 1,047 charactersLawl3ss, Mar 19, 2013

A- pours a bright sunshine-like golden color, slightly hazy with two-finger white foamy head with good retention, reduces to a thin layer that seems to last forever, leaves a ring if lace
S- citrus-grapefruit-like hops, freshly cut grass with a bit of pine, some pineapple & pear, and a lemon flavored cookie sweetness, quite complex 
T- right away I taste the grassiness that I picked up from the nose, definitely the freshest grassy flavor that I've had. Some tropical guava & pineapple, a bit peppery in the finish with some nutty malt and a hop resin linger. 
M- medium bodied with medium carbonation, lively-yet-creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish, just a bit of alcohol warmth but you'd never guess it was almost 10% ABV.
O- definitely one of the fresher hop flavors I've had, quite fitting for this beer. All hops take center stage, just a bit of nutty malt noticeable. Pleasing finish with a refreshing, lingering grassy bitterness. Very solid DIPA. 1,004 charactersTreyliff, Mar 18, 2013

Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip.
A - Golden copper. 4
N - Lots of tropical hop notes and bready malts. Also some pine and resin. Surprisingly balanced nose. 4
T - Not quite as balanced as the nose. Starts off with amazing tropical hop flavors of mango, pineapple and some orange. This moves to a nice amount of grapefruit, pine and resin. It finishes with a touch of sweet bready malts. This is an awesome West Coast Style IPA. 4.75
M - It has a nice medium-body but is still crisp and easy to drink. It also has that oily and sticky body that I love in IPAs that really puts it on the Pliny, Alpine and other world-class IPAs level. 4.5
Overall - This is a perfect example of a West Coast style IPA. The tropical hop notes combined with the pine and resin make this one an excellent offering. It's probably the best hoppy beer from Stone and one I hope they decide to make year-round, mainly because its a great value at $5.99. It's so close to the other great IPAs (Alpine, Pliny, Heady etc) but just not quite there. 4.5 1,070 charactersDrunk_And_Sarcastic, Mar 17, 2013

Appearance: golden amber with a very light hazy body. Head is subtle considering its off the tap maybe 1/3" off the body. This brew did settle nice and even with steady lacing.
Smell: aroma overload with grapefruit and hops that make your nostrils wish you could take this home. 
Taste: extreme hops complimented with a bitterness overload that comes off very citrusy. I am absolutely indulging in the taste alone. 
Mouth: medium carbonation, might come slightly light wish it was a little heavier but it's everlasting stickiness is incredible. 
Overall: here at the bar enjoying one of the best "new" imperial IPAs I have had in a long time. Little expensive but honestly I have had so many DIPAs that this seems priceless. Salud! 776 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Mar 17, 2013

Swish it in your mouth and taste the changes! This is one of those that changes with temperature, and has an evolving aftertaste. 6th batch was indeedly a treat; smelled and tasted herbal... Basil/rosemary/other garden thangs. I'm wondering if there is any legitimacy to the drink by date-or just newly minted marketing majors making a stamp on the craftbeer scene. I'm visiting the northeast this weekend, but wish it were available back in Lousiana where I'm working. Strong work Stone. 600 charactersFlashyspoons, Mar 17, 2013

Pours a crystal clear golden orange color with a 2-finger white head. Head dissipates rather quickly but leaves some nice lacing. 
The aroma is very piney with tons of citrus. I also get plenty of pineapple with the slightest hint of bready malt on the backbone. 
The taste is far more sweet than I remember other Enjoy By's being, but this is hardly a problem. I get tons of pineapple, mango, and juicy citrus. But the piney, bitter, resiny hop explosion is still very present.
The mouth is the best part of the beer. Very creamy, very smooth, and the 9.4 ABV is almost non-existent. Medium-bodied with medium carbonation, and almost no lingering bitterness. 
Overall, while this release does seem a bit different than past releases, at least to my palate, it's still absolutely fantastic in every way. It's bitter, but not overly so. It's sweet, but in no way cloying. Simply put, one of the better double IPA's out there. 951 charactersScaryEd, Mar 16, 2013

A- Poured into an oversized snifter with a slightly hazy golden orange body. A frothy white head forms to about one finger in size and has good retention. Lacing comes in small spots that are plentiful.
S- A blast of fresh fruity hops doesn't surprise me but it sure is pleasant. Fresh pineapple, mango nectar, dank weed, orange peel, grapefruit juice and pine come off strong and saturated. This reminds me a lot of a coconut mango curry dish I eat sometimes in a nice way.
T- Again, a ridiculous amount of hop presence. I would say mango and dank floral notes give off the most to me as we'll as citrus, herbal, grapefruit and pine hints. Just a tiny malt and yeast backbone.
MF- Creamy and silky smooth moderately thick body. Carbonation is very easy on the palate but still at a medium level. Dank bitterness in the finish.
This beer makes me want to go back to San Diego. Each sip reminds me of the great time and IPAs I had there. Impressive hidden ABV, feels so smooth like it could be 4%. 1,020 characterscbutova, Mar 16, 2013

The beer pours a nice copper color, clear texture with a few bubbles rising to the top of the glass. A nice soapy white head rises above the beer, almost a finger high, that has decent retention and a decent amount of sticky lacing. The aroma is very tropical, lots of mango, pineapple, wildflower, grapefruit, tangerine with a bit burst of earthy pine and hop resin that finishes with sweet alcohol. The flavors are very nice, lots of tropical fruit, big mango layer, tangerine, grapefruit with lots of backing caramel malt and alcohol sweetness, lots of bitter, resinous pine sneaks out at the finish, balances the flavors nicely. The body is nice and thick, very juicy with a nice dry finish.
Verdict: A great DIPA from Stone, arguably of their best hoppy beers to date. It's a very boozy, but has a great hop profile. So happy to see this beer as a regular brew, if only they would bring back Ruination 10th Anniversary. A hop heads dream beer. 1,017 characterskevanb, Mar 16, 2013

These rest atop a lovely set of near-Jolly-Rancher-like orange, berry, cherry, and apricot fruit esters, as well as brown sugar, and a good, if light, earthy base of toast crust, biscuit, and floury baguette. The aromas are obviously heavily geared toward hops, which constitute perhaps three-quarters of the aromas, and should set any hophead’s tastebuds aflame in anticipation. As a whole, this is an excellently balanced, finely nuanced IPA, that sets a brilliant standard for others to follow.
On the tongue, the beer opens with a huge, bitter hop blast, with pine resins, heavy dandelion stems, lemon oil, grapefruit rind, and eucalyptus eating away at the tastebuds in near-apocalyptic fury, scorching their way in bitter, oily, resinous goodness. Against this onslaught, other flavors are actually difficult to locate, but there are a few orange, berry, cherry, and apricot fruit esters, as well as toast crust and biscuit grains. The aftertaste is a continuation of the hop blast, lingering on the tongue in palate-wrecking levels for a long time. Mouthfeel is an oily medium, and carbonation is medium.
Overall, this is easily one of the best IPAs on the market, though it should be made clear that it’s definitely not for the faint of heart: there’s more hop goodness in one bottle of this stuff than in a truckload of anything Anheuser-Busch produces, and the sheer intensity of the flavors will probably be unpalatable for anyone who can’t even stand a more friendly IPA. But if you’re a hophead, this must be on your must-try list. Excellent fare. 1,879 charactersjondeelee, Mar 15, 2013

A: Clear pale amber body; 1 finger of fine tan head. Ok retention, spotty lace. Solid.
S: Deep, intense, richly fruity hops. Really tropical, with mango being followed by pineapple and grapefruit. Wonderful.
T: Opens with magical fruity hops goodness (all mango and grapefruit); the hops continue their dominance throughout, ending with a clean bitterness. Delicious.
M: Creamy medium body with silky carbonation. Great.
O: Wonderful DIPA, plain and simple. Perhaps a bit bigger and heavier than I find ideal (coughHEADYcough), but thoroughly enjoyable in its richness. I've still got a bottle of my own that I'm looking forward to drinking on April Fools Day to see just how good it still is on the last "acceptable" day of consumption.

A - My favorite part of this beer. I drink a lot of imperial IPAs and I was not expecting this color. It's a fantastic copper / gold color that you can see through. Very surprising for a highly hopped beer of this ABV. The foamy head is nearly pure white with heavy lacing. Very appetizing.
S - Lots of grapefruit and some lemon. Actually light in nose for an IIPA.
T - Very very good. Lots of grapefruit, citrus, and some grass. A tiny bit of pine. Hoppy hoppy hoppy. A touch of malt brings it back to sanity but this beer is definitely for a hop head.
M - Leaves a fantastic aftertaste. I found myself licking my lips and irate that I only bought one of these. It has that pleasant, piny, almost tar like thickness that is an indicator of this style.
O - A really fantastic IPA. This is the first of this series I've tried and will definitely try the remainder of the batches. 934 charactersAdamHart22, Mar 14, 2013

This beer was a clear gold color with a thick white head. There was a good deal of lace.
Mostly a citrus aroma, but there were some floral elements also. A sweet malt background. 
Primarily citrus taste, grapefruit and lemon. Some piney/floral hops. Biscuit.
This was a pretty hop forward beer, but I thought there was still some good balance.

A good looking head, better from a growler than the bottle. The lacing always coats the sides and looks great as it goes down no matter the source (tap or bomber).
Wow, the hops aroma jumps out and smells very fresh up front; the smell is a combo of piney hops, citrus like pineapple, lemon, tangerine, grapefruit and orange peel, biscuit, tobacco, herbs and floral hops. The citrus hops smell like the oil was squeezed out of this, and while it’s hop dominant and extremely fresh smelling, there is just enough grainy and caramel balance to make this outstanding. Later whiffs seem to have mint and tea leaf, like a crazy hop potpourri. 
Taste is lip-smackingly good. Even though it starts off bitter and herbal, as the flavor washes over your tongue it seems to coat the tastebuds with resinous hop oil like a napalm bombing just laying down the hop attack. This is very much like the nose, but more complex, with fresh piney hops, citrus hops, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, tangerine, orange peel, coriander, mint, tea leaf, biscuit, tobacco, roasted grains, pepper, grass, herbs and other light spices, floral hops, some candy or brown sugar sweetness, earthy notes and very mild alcohol which is basically covered up by the piney and citrus hops. The malt comes through, but the feel is odd as it’s dry and slightly bitter with a textured herbal feel to it. Very hoppy, but not obnoxious hoppy, it was surprisingly easy to drink with the 9.4% ABV. 
Mouthfeel is on the slick side, with a medium almost chewy body, a grainy or herbal feel like the liquid is thicker than it looks, and a slightly bitter and yet dry finish. How a hopped up IPA can end so clean is a masterful brewing trick and the drinkability just may be the most impressive part of this brew considering the ABV. 
Overall this was as good as I hoped it would be and I hope they keep making these “Enjoy By…” beers and shipping them to NY so we can be treated to such beer excellence. This beer is up there with some of the all time greats from Stone. If you read this review then get your ass out to a beer distributor nearby that might have some and buy a bottle now.
NOTE: A week after having the bottle of this masterpiece I was able to get my hands on a growler, which I shared with my brothers. We all agreed that the aroma was better and fresher out of the growler, with the hops giving off strong oily notes, and while the flavor had more alcohol bite to it, overall it was just as good and maybe even better on tap/from a growler. Complex, fresh and extremely hoppy, this was outstanding.
SECOND NOTE: 5/7/13 had Stone Enjoy By 05.17.13 on tap at the Lark in East Northport, NY: pours cloudy orange gold with a very nice 2 finger foamy white head that faded slowly, leaving good foamy lacing and rings as it went down. Amazing grapefruit, mango, floral and citrus hop nose that is perfectly balanced with the malty backbone that has nice hints of caramel. Tastes as good as the 04.01.13, with strong grapefruit, lemon, orange peel, pineapple, citrus hops, pine cone/piney hops, tangerine, lightly roasted grains, fresh juicy hops and then a malty caramel backbone to allow for the ultimate smooth drinkability that completely hides the ABV - this is a masterpiece, almost DIPA perfection and up there with some of the best ever.
THIRD NOTE: 10/29/13 had Stone Enjoy By 11.12.13 on tap at Sapsuckers in Huntington; like the versions before this it was near perfection. It was fresh and crisp and poured with a great head and excellent lacing, so the rating/review went up overall.
ROUND FOUR: Had Stone Enjoy By 02.14.14 on tap at The Lark again and this batch had a lot more pronounced grapefruit and what seems like mint or very dry floral/herbal hops; it was very tasty and full of fresh hop flavor still, but it just seemed different from the other versions. Looks and smells great and was just as easy to drink, once again masterfully hiding the ABV.
ROUND FIVE: Had 04.20.14 on tap at The Lark and once again it was delicious. Looks great, fine sticky lacing leaving rings, huge grapefruit and juicy hop nose and of course a ridiculously tasty hop bomb that's full of citrus, grapefruit and dank resinous hop juice like hops were squeezed out if the cones from a vice. This shit is awesome!!
GROUPIE ROUND: Enjoy By 07.04.14 bomber; after trying this for the past year I can conclude that this is one of the best beers ever made. Need to try Pliney The Younger and Double Sunshine IPA in hopes of having something better, but besides Heady Topper I've never had a fresher tasting DIPA that was smooth and ridiculously easy to drink with great balance, fresh complicated hop/citrus flavors and a nose so wonderful. This always delivers, one of the all time greats. 5,007 charactersCHickman, Mar 13, 2013

O-Solid and balanced IPA that is extremely drinkable, although the abv will keep you from having more than one 404 charactersatr2605, Mar 13, 2013

A: Pours a golden orange, with a three-finger, cotton white head; sugary sheets of lace line the glass - very impressive; a steady stream of bubbles keeps the retention and slight headiness firmly intact. 
S: Resinous hops; piney; tobacco; citrus rind - mostly grapefruit; a tad husky / grainy. Hops dominate and are very nice... but not quite as hoppy as I was expecting from a Stone Double IPA.
T: Again... resin. Piney hops. Some light citrus in there to brighten things up, but hop flavor is mostly of the "dank" variety. There is some light malt character... rustic grains / bread crust / almond skin. But that's about it. Some alcohol on the end as the sip comes to a close.
M: Near full-bodied; high carbonation; lively, textured mouthfeel. Very impressive. Not overly oily - and also not really THAT dry. A nice balance of feel, carbo and wetness for an imperial IPA.
O: Not too shabby, although I'll be honest... I was expecting something more along the lines of Ruination. That being said, this is still a really nice DIPA. It's not super bitter or dry, which helps its drinkability. Would love to have it again, if it comes around! 1,255 charactersjpro, Mar 13, 2013

Pours a pretty gold and slightly orange color, clear with a ring of head, very pretty. 
The smell is just awesome, pungent dank hops soaked in a mix of pepper, honey and earth, very clear that this beer is all about highlighting the hops no question, very little malt. Outstanding. The taste follows suit and features a very plant based hop base which is just delicious. Maybe a touch of sweet to give a malt backbone but the stars are hop flavors: citrus, weed, pepper, earth, pungent hop nugget. 
The feel is nice, great carbonation and a medium feel, a lasting aftertaste of bitter sweet dripping hops. 
Overall, wow. An excellent beer, on par or better than their IPA specialty neighbors Alpine which is high praise. Well done Stone. 938 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 12, 2013

A - Beautiful golden/light copper color, crystal clear, nice carbonation, decent head. Lots of lacing.
S - Best part! Very hoppy, grassy, some spice. Makes you want to drink slowly and savor every scent.
T - Hoppy and piny, some initial sweetness. Still developing my palate but as such I can still say this is one of the best-tasting IPAs I've had.
M - Not light but not terribly heavy. Smooth and highly drinkable.
Overall - Easily the best IPA I've had. Pick some up if you get a chance. The local liquor store limits these to 1 per customer due to scarcity--now I understand why. 661 charactersSoCalBeerIdiot, Mar 12, 2013

N - Resiny, citrusy, grassy hops shine through the nose. Smells fresh, as advertised. Hints of grapefruit and a hoppy characteristic I've never smelled before--like a savory spice. 
T: Very hop-forward, moderately bitter, with interesting hop complexity. Fresh-tasting citrus hops, resin, orange, grapefruit, grassy hops. Subdued malt, but good balance, given the hop profile.
M: High carbonation, may be a bit thin, and feels very dry (which is surprising, because it's almost 10% alcohol) and drinkable. Drinks easily and warms simultaneously. 
O: Excellent beer. Dry, complex, hop-centric profile with excellent drinkability. One of Stone's best offerings. I sure hope they continue to make these for upcoming summer nights. 863 charactersBazaar, Mar 11, 2013

Hop madness straight out the bottle! Poured a golden yellow imto a standard British pint glass. The bitterness of the hops was easily disguished by an amaziing smoothness and overall drinkability not found in average IPA's. 
My second, the 08-02-13 edition, was enjoyed really fresh (brewed 06-28-13'- consumed 07-01/02-13) via a growler straight from the brewery! If you ever get a chance to visit, this is a mandatory stop...but I digress. The 08-02 poured same as the 04-01 and each glass was consistent throughout. This has to be one of Stone's best!!
Third: 09-13-13 edition, 22oz bomber, not as tasty as the "straight from the brewery" taste I enjoyed in August, but still an the best IPA I've had! 801 charactersTheRougeBastard, Mar 11, 2013

Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz bomber.
Pours a clear light gold with just a tiny white head that quickly fades to a thin cap. Just a few chunks of lacing cling to the sides of the glass.
The aroma has a very pungent, almost oniony thing going on combined with some pine sap and a touch of tropical fruit. No malt to speak of as it is all hops here and they prove to be very mouth watering.
Lots of orange and pine in the flavor with just a touch of butterscotch. More earth and sap coming in towards the middle along with some tartness. There is a brief sweetness that appears but is then quickly ushered away by an extreme drying bitterness. Mouthfeel is somewhat silky but then finishes very dry which is impressive for a beer of this strength. Alcohol is completely hidden making this dangerously drinkable.
Overall, another great IIPA from stone. I love the drinkablity and the unique hop combination of this brew and am really glad I picked it up. 983 charactersrangerred, Mar 11, 2013

4.12/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Very bright white head with a thick foamy texture. The color appears more golden with less orange hues typical for an IPA.
The scent is remarkably complex with floral and citrus hops blending well. Mango, tangerine, lemon, and orange play out of a sweet citrusy tone. Musky, pine and earthy scents mix in as well, in a strong aromatic display.
The taste is equally complex and strong but more dominated by the earthy, musky and even oniony hop characters. The citrus notes are near the front but its hard to discern the individual tastes. The floral, piney tastes than dominate and finish. No alcohol taste is present but a great warmth spreads through the chest.
I can appreciate this for all the character it possesses even if it is not necessarily my cup of beer. 769 charactersKYGunner, Mar 10, 2013

---
22 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.
A: Pours a freaking gorgeous golden amber shade with perfect clarity. The head is a three finger white shade. Everything is good here - retention, texture, and the lacing down the glass. This beer makes Sofia Vergara look like a damn horse in comparison.
S: There is a distinct savory note from the hops that reminds me of onion/garlic. Otherwise, this one comes off as being bitter just from the nose alone; there is a lot of grapefruit peel, black pepper, mango, papaya, pine, and guava. It really smells damn great, but perhaps it's not quite to my preference for an IPA.
T: At first, there's some slight maltiness (in an earthy expression) before it finishes both dry and bitter. Transitioning between the vaguely citrusy opening and piny, bitter ending is a strong midtaste of onion and garlic; I actually like this portion of the flavor profile the best. But the biggest problem here is how boozy this one seems. Maybe it's some of the earthy and oniony qualities coming through on the back end, but there's a real distinct sharp heat to it that doesn't strike me as being hop-derived. Certainly it feels every bit its 9.4% ABV. To be fair, this note helps to rein in the bitterness somewhat, so it's not all bad, I guess.
I've got another one on standby that I plan to serve more chilled than this one - maybe this will tone down the booze some? Regardless, what a letdown.
M: Typical Stone IPA: bone-dry, clean, astringent, and bitter as fuck. Well, maybe not 'as fuck', but it does have a good lingering bite to it. Something like this should be spectacularly drinkable - thanks to all the poorly concealed alcohol I taste here, I'm reduced to vegging over this one for a moderate length of time. Drinkability is actually okay because the general feel is quite good - but then again, I expected something fantastically chuggable.
O: I really thought this was going to be a world-class DIPA, but instead I find it kind of harsh and meh. I hate to say it, but this has nothing on some of the local DIPAs I can get fairly readily (Evolution Lot 6 DIPA and Troegs Perpetual IPA); and let's not talk about how badly Lagunitas Sucks pounds this one into submission. Absolutely worth trying, though - hell, I seem to be only one who doesn't love this. But Stone, unless the second bottle I drink manages to make me shit out rainbows and sunshine the way I expected this one to, you are back on my naughty list again. 2,693 charactersThisWangsChung, Mar 10, 2013

A – The beer pours an incredibly clear and filtered golden orange, almost the like the color of Honey. A foamy two finger head formed as I poured it into my crate and barrel snifter. The head seemed to stick around for some time eventually receding leaving behind some serious lacing. 
S – The aroma of this batch is less pungent than I remember from previous examples of the beer, but it still is very citrus forward, with tones of lemon zest, fresh squeezed orange juice and the traditional pineapple an mango hints. There is a strong hop presence with this beer, as its fairly piney and resiny.
T – Huge, bitter resinous hop flavors dominate the front of the beer, followed by the citrusy components I detected in the aroma. Although delicious, this is a very bitter beer, unlike Sucks or Heady which are very tropical and citrus forward. That’s not a negative nock against the beer, just an observation. The taste finishes of very dry with slight bready malt flavors. 
M – Fairly light mouth. Fairly astringent (not in a bad way) with a nice dry finish. The high abv is undetectable as I feel little to no heat from the beer.
O – This is not the first Enjoy By I’ve had as its come around my area twice now. I regret not reviewing it the first time as I thought that batch was significantly better. Part of me is really disappointed by the inconsistency I perceive from batch to batch, but the other part of me is loving the brilliance and the quality of this beer. The idea of dating the beers like this is brilliant and I will continue to buy them every chance get because I will always know how old they are without digging for the date. Well done Stone! 1,698 charactersdubinsky, Mar 10, 2013

A: It pours a golden orange, initially a two finger head that receded to a skim. Lots of lacing sticking to the glass and some alcohol legs.
S: Very dank, there's a lot of resinous pine hop aromas maybe some grapefruit. As it warms, the sweeter tropical hops come through, and I'm also getting some mild cat piss/garlic which sounds weird, but it blends nicely with the sweeter hops aroma. Not a lot of alcohol, maybe a light whiff.
T: Follows the nose almost exactly. Hops are earthy and very resinous with pine, grapefruit and more of that onion and garlic thing. There's also some tropical fruit hops flavors that blend with the resinous hops. The beer is pretty bitter and the flavor leaves a resinous lingering bitterness.
M: Medium, slighlty sticky feel especially as it warms up.
O: This one got much better as it warmed up and more flavors started to pull through. I was however slightly let down by this one especially with all the hype around it. I thought it was an excellent beer, but (and I hate to make comparisons) I prefer a DIPA like Sucks for the immense drinability and tropical flavors to the more resinous/dank that Enjoy By has. That being said, brilliant idea by Stone. 1,233 charactersDools9, Mar 10, 2013

04.01.13
A - This DIPA is on the lighter end of the color spectrum. It is a light amber that could pass for a golden color. It is topped off with an inch of off-white head.
S - There's a lot going on here. I get an initially smell of some skunk weed and metal. Then I get some citrus, and after that the tropical fruits come into play. 
T - Pretty much everything that I described in the smell is going on in the taste; however, in a different order. It starts out with the citrus and tropical fruits. Then gives way to the skunk weed and iron taste on the finish.
M - It is really smooth with lower carbonation than expected.
O - I had this on tap and noticed a lot more grapefruit. The bottle seems to have more bitterness, especially on the finish. It has a lot of flavor and is good, but not necessarily my favorite of all time. 877 charactersbuschbeer, Mar 10, 2013

L – Pale amber color with a 1-finger frothy, cream-colored head. Pretty good retention and some nice patchy lacing. Clear with a good amount of bubbles.
S – Tons of west coast hops with grapefruit, peach, mango, and pine notes. There may be a touch of bready and caramel malt, but the hops take front and center for sure.
T – Just like the nose suggests, this is a wonderfully hoppy beer. The taste starts off sweet for a split second with bready and caramel malt flavors before a sweeping wave of bitterness comes through. The hop profile includes grapefruit, orange, mango, and peach flavors at first, and a great resinous, piney taste appears at the very finish.
F – Medium-bodied with pretty good carbonation, a chewy and sticky mouthfeel, and a very bitter finish. Grapefruit and pine hop bitterness lingers wonderfully.
O – This is an awesome DIPA from Stone. It is not only delicious, but is also dangerously drinkable given the ABV. I’m so glad I finally got to try a beer from this series. It was worth the wait. 1,152 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Mar 10, 2013

Happy to see this in Michigan on the (relative) cheap, $7.99/bomber. I'm much more willing to buy this at a reasonable price in MI than I am at $10 in NY. 
A - almost transparent, extremely translucent, beautiful oranges and yellows, one of the clearest IPAs I've ever poured. Very little foam on the forced pour. No carbonation bubbles, despite the lacing that gets left up the side on every swirl. 
S - huge citrus on the nose, lots of orange, some fruits that balance between acidity and sugar, pineapple coupled by grapefruit, kiwi/mango coupled with some earthier greens, arugula, swiss chard, and butter lettuce. There's something a little fishy here too, an empty, lager-like sweetness; isopropyl alcohol. It doesn't last. The lasting impression is rubbery.
T - sweeter than expected, cloying honey and sugary tones, with only a hint of the fruity hops that back them. The sweet ephemeral fruit notes of pineapples, kiwi, and orange give way to some emptiness that isn't especially pleasant. Big and boozy. 
M - there isn't a ton of balance. There's a lot of booze and a lot of sugar that fight each other the entire time. The alcohol is relatively hidden, but not entirely absent. Enjoy By coats the tongue.
O - I love the gimmick, I think it's got a good message. Some of the fruitier tones are somewhat diminished by the rubbery tones. I like the strong booze presence, but it doesn't benefit the taste in any significant way. Enjoy By is good, definitely worth &lt;$8 /bomber, but not any more than that. 1,593 charactersJamesShoemaker, Mar 09, 2013

Golden honey colored. Poured into a tulip glass with about a 1 finger head, doesn't stick around for too long but leaves great lacing. 
S - Zesty citrus notes up front...lemon peel, over-ripe orange, maybe a little pineapple. Followed up with a nose clearing piney/resinous note. As the beer warms you get a bit of the alcohol. Smell is not as in your face as I would expect.
T - Taste comes in almost the reverse order of the nose...strong pine notes up front with a slight alcohol note. By no means a burn but you notice the 9.4%. The beer finishes with the citrus notes mentioned in the smell and a slight sweet bready maltiness.
M - Very light for the style. Often IIPA in the 9+% abv range become fairly viscous; not the case here.
O - Great IIPA, one of my favorites. Love the concept of "Enjoy By" 917 characterseandersen, Mar 09, 2013

T- sharp lemon, grapefruit peel, massive fresh citrus, alcohol, and more bitter grapefruit on the finish.
M- Medium bodied, low carbonation, extremely bitter, very dry
O- lived up to the hype, just an incredible hop monster of a beer with still enough malt to make for a great body of beer, just amazing, a testament to what fresh IPA's ought to be. 518 charactersgabedivision, Mar 09, 2013

A - pours a nice golden, amber with a fingers worth of head on it. 
S - hoppy smell right off the bat. Piney dankness with sweet notes of grapefruit.
T - there is a lot going on in the taste of this beer, all good. Right up front there's a sweet yet sharp tartness to it. Notes of mango, bitterness, grapefruit with a little booziness to it but not strong and overpowering as with most Stone beers. Very easy to drink with a dry, bitter finish.
O - I've never been a huge fan of Stone's stuff because the taste of the majority of their beers are very overpowering to the point where I can't drink it comfortably. This one, however, is completely different. Very easy to drink yet still maintaining that strengthness thats become a hallmark of Stone. A complex mixture of flavors going back and forth with each sip. Excellent beer and very well balanced. I really love this beer. I had it on tap in Waterbury, VT and it was just as delicious and refreshing as the bottle. Complete success with this beer. 1,083 charactersnootch23, Mar 08, 2013

Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, golden-orange coloring with a slow, steady flow of carbonation bubbles and a thin, filmy, bright white head that recedes into a surface coat that clings to everything it touches. Aromas of resiny and piney hops fill your nose on every sniff. Tropical fruit and grapefruit sweet and tart ribbon through the aromas, also. Smells green and tasty. Flavors are amazingly balanced. Green, resiny, hoppy punch initially, with a dose of bitterness that quickly washes into a tropical fruit blend of mango and grapefruit. Resiny and bitter at the end of the palate, with a slightly roasty and tangy sweet caramel backbone coming through. Hoppy and peppery spiced aftertaste, with a bitter feel that leads to the clean, dry finish. Smooth and clean in mouth. This beer is tremendous. 867 charactersGarthDanielson, Mar 08, 2013

A - Golden/Bronze/Copper/Orange hue. Mild carbonation coming from the bottom of the class with no head to speak of. Lots of lacing and some alcohol legs.
S - Hits right up front and hits hard! As soon as you open the bomber, immediate citrus, pine and a slight astringency. Very power typical IPA smell.
T - More big citrus notes up front. Some pine and a very mild malt background. Not really balanced, but it works very nicely for a DIPA. 
M - Par for the course with what I expect from a quality DIPA by Stone. Nothing that screams amazing, but certainly not bad. Drinks very nicely for 9.4% abv.
O - A great DIPA by stone. Better than 10th anni Ruination? Not a chance. A very good beer none the less. Also, a very cool concept for beers that need to be consumed fresh. If it ever stayed on the shelves long enough, it would drive stores to dispose of old IPAs 895 charactersTitans77, Mar 07, 2013

This poured out as a clear yellow color with a white head on top. The retention was good as well as the lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is loaded with fresh hop aromas, big floral and citrus notes with a subtle malt sweetness in there as well. The taste of the beer is very good as well. The malt balances the bitter hops quite well giving this more of a sessionable flavor in my opinion. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth with a bit of oiliness to it. Overall I wasn't thinking this was an Imperial IPA, I was thinking it was just an amped up standard IPA. All in all it's a good brew and I'm glad to have tried it. Worth checking out if you want a quality brew. 713 charactersKnapp85, Mar 07, 2013

This one is GREAT!!!

The hops bitterness is there at the end, but it is smooth bitterness if that makes sense.. and so much lovely grapefruit.. man I love this beer. I'm going to go buy another one tomorrow... period.

Pours clear amber with a two finger white head that leaves some spotty lacing and settles to a small cap.
Aroma is hoppy with a little bit of everything, pineapple, lemon citrus, floral hops, pine, dank, onion, apricot, alcohol, some bready and caramel malt. Good to very good strength.
Flavor is at first a big blast of oniony hops and lemon, then some pineapple, citrus rind, resinous hops, pine, decent caramel malt backbone, minimal sweetness, great bitterness and a fairly aggressive solvent alcohol punch at the end.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, with sharp carbonation.
Pretty good Double IPA. Pretty dank. Very hoppy, although a fair bit of malt and booze as well. A nice treat to try, glad it finally made its way into the Georgia market. 829 characterselgiacomo, Mar 07, 2013

T- Pine, grapefruit, resin, floral notes, bitterness lingers in a good way, well balance, just enough malt backbone.
M- Smooth, crisp, medium body, good carbonation.

5/17/13 version
Had this on draft a few months ago and wasn't overly impressed. Picked up the bottle version for a second try and was a bit more impressed, though not blown away. Pours a beautiful copper color with a moderate head. smell is HOPPY. to be expected from a 10 day old beer. Taste is the normal west coast DIPA taste...very bitter and very hoppy. Enjoyable. Moderately carbonated. Overall not a world class brew as others would have you believe, but worth picking up and trying if you see it. I prefer Stone's regular IPA, Cali-Belgique and Ruination to this one. 625 charactersAxnjxn, Mar 07, 2013

Pours like a great IPA should- a honey-colored hazy orange. One inch head off-white head, significant sticky lacing all the way down the glass.
The smell and tastes are relatively the same here- juicy, succulent fruit flavors intermixed with dank, herbal hop tones. Some piney bitterness doesn't overtake the tropical and citrus tones given off by the heavy-handed use of hops. Fruits noticed include grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Very bright flavors.
Medium bodied, very dry, well carbonated.
One of Stone's best hoppy beers, in my opinion. 675 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 07, 2013

Poured into a Bruery chalice, produces a thick foamy head over an absolutely brilliantly clear golden body. There is some lacing at the outset. Eventually the head fades to a slight ring. Really looks like some slick commercial hi-production beer. 
But one whiff tells you it is not. Loving the nose with sweet light caramelized malt, orange fruit, and fresh basil. Smells a bit like pesto, it is a bit cheesy as well. I immediately think I want a pesto pizza with this. Definite pine as well. 
This tastes terrific with a light nutty sweet maltiness that is just spot on in balance with the fantastic orange and vegetal (basil)/pine/cheesy flavor. It is a seductive hop assault that is never harsh, with flavors that expand on the palate and last for a very long ride. 
This has a terrific mouthfeel too, with a medium body and moderate carbonation, all the taste buds are instantly excited and they stay that way for the very long ride. Orange and light pine hoppy bitterness envelops the tongue, with just a tad of stickiness. 
This beer exudes nuanced, well balanced flavors that just ride on and on. It is very tasty and the ABV at 9.4 is hardly noticeable, so it could pull you under quicker than a rip tide. I definitely want some more, but this is a beer that is best consumed in moderation with food and friends. 1,344 charactersBeerenauslese, Mar 06, 2013

Clear, deep golden to medium copper body. Lighter edges. Tall, rocky, whipped, light beige to off-white head. Great lacing. Loads of fresh hops on the nose. Tropical fruit, pineapple, mango, mandarin orange, resinous funk, and even a little cat pee.
Taste actually starts out with cookie-ish, fruity malts. Light toasted edge. Herbal, numbing hop bitterness quickly ekes in, but then big tropical fruit hop notes take over. Pineapple, mango, and mandarin orange stick out. Undercurrents of grapefruit and citrus peel. All this hoppy goodness sits over a solid bedrock of fruity sweet malt. Still, this is definitely a hop-forward beer. Finish dries out some, with lingering notes of tropical fruits, pine, and spicy alcohol. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Very drinkable; I just wish I had more :). 839 charactersalexgash, Mar 06, 2013

Clear yellow orange pour with a 1 inch head that sticks around for quite a while. Sticky lacing clings to the glass nicely. Alcohol legs for days.
Smells of strong dank hop resin. Malt is there but the hops overpower. Pine, floral with a touch of citrus. 
Wow-this is fantastic. Quite a battle between hops and malt. Hops win but the malt fights for balance. Dank ass hops and sweet malt blend well. Very tasty and in your face. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Smooth as hell. Goes down way to easy for a beer with this high of ABV. This shit is dangerous.
Stone's best example of the style in my opinion. West cost DIPA that is crisp, super tasty and no holds barred. Highly recommended. 747 charactersChrisMon02, Mar 05, 2013

Appearance- Beautiful clear gold with thin head that left gorgeous lacing.
Smell- Wet grass, super herbaceous hops, some apple and peach, and something woody. All over the place, but beautiful none the less.
Taste- Tons of layers here. Earthy/grassy hops (along the lines of heady topper), smoething funky which I can't describe, fruity apples and peaches, and finishes with a great crisp bitterness. No sense of alcohol presence. 
Mouthfeel- Very crisp and clean. Good carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. Lighter body.

One of my favorite breweries making my favorite style super fresh, and it only comes every few months. I had the pleasure of having the 12.21.12 but didn't have a BA account at the time, so I am looking forward to reviewing it.
Enjoy By 04.01.13: It pours an absolutely gorgeous, and perfectly translucent copper tinged gold with tons of effervescing bubbles and a thick, light head. The smell is simply staggering; lemon, orange, grapefruit, tons of pine and hops, sweet mango and pineapple. Traces of malt. It really is an amazing smell; breathe long and deep. The taste is a wave of citrus and hops. Tons of lime and orange peel, buttery caramel, lingering grapefruit and hops left on the palate, slightly peppery. Everything you want out of a good IPA is here. Perfect amount of boozey heat for 9+%. Mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation really helps bring the flavor to life and accentuates the pepper and citrus. Balanced, amazingly hoppy, a great aroma, this is definitely my favorite beer from stone, and one of my favorites of all time.
Enjoy By 09.13.13: I was afraid I was going to rehype this too much for myself, and set myself up for disappointment, but it was just as good as I remember it. Amazing beer, and the smell is simply exquisite. Freshest hops of any brew I can think of. 1,336 charactersSamuel906, Mar 05, 2013

L -- possibly the coolest pour i've yet seen in a beer ... I'd swear it percolates, like watching fresh-roasted, fresh-ground coffee beans in a French press. at least an inch head of off white THICK foam on top of a gold medal. crystal clear. and no amber. this thing is yellow gold, and the head is not tan but just a bit off of white.
S -- GRAPEFRUIT! really stout, too, and honestly, I think you could trick people blind-folded on which is the beer and which is the grapefruit juice.
T -- make a meatball out of hops, drop it in a pitcher of grapefruit juice and you've got it. damn good. relatively easy to drink despite the big Stonesque hop bite and 9.4 ABV. it's yummy. 
F -- nothing noteworthy in any direction. just good. good carbonation without feeling overly heavy or light.
O -- I'm not smart enough nor experienced enough with beer to say if this lives up to the hype, but they sold me. I love it. And I've got a feeling I'll always partake.
I want to compare this one side-by-side with Stone IPA, because let's face it: That is the ultimate test for this particular beer. 
But however it compares, I love it. 1,189 charactersPremo88, Mar 05, 2013

This was delicious. The malt is a bit sugary and sweet which blends perfectly with the intense hop character. There is such great balance here. It also has tremendous drinkability for the ABV. This is an IPA that all beer fans should try. 540 characterstdm168, Mar 05, 2013

Crystal clear gold pour with two plus fingers of soapy, snow white head. Lacing is excellent. This was poured into my new DFH "IPA" glass and the steady stream of bubbles rising from the bottom has me mesmerized.
Bright juicy grapefruit, sweet clementines with some fresh peaches. There is a grassy wetness with bitter pine. My mouth just watered lol.
Bitter pine up front that transitions to a tongue coating sweetness like a simple syrup. Juicy citrus than makes way for a bitter dry finish. Zero alcohol in the taste.
Light body with a high carbonation prickle on the tongue. 615 characterskorguy123, Mar 04, 2013

Really could not get any fresher. Excellent mouthfeel-just a huge body that is very well balanced against the enormous flavor. WOW! what a great beer all in. Reminds me of Moylan's Hopsickle just picked off the bine. Just killer all in. Had no idea about this beer until the guy in my local turned me on to it.

Taste: Strong grapefruit and citrusy hop flavors, up front, with just a hint of a malt base underneath; a hint of mango and a bit of onion creep into the mid-palate, but they add an angle rather than dominate; citrusy finish
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall: Glad to have snagged a bottle from the release (4/1/13) that made it to NC; really tasty and avoids the stickiness that I have encountered with some other beers brewed by Stone 630 charactersbrentk56, Mar 04, 2013

A - Poured from a bottle. Poured with a decent one finger, bright white head. Head faded rather quickly leaving no visible lacing. Pretty light orange, not as dark as I was expecting for such a strong IPA. Crystal clear with nice bubbles floating to the top of the brew.
S - Very astringent hop smell. Reminds me of the Green Flash West Coast. Lots of pine and a little lemon rind. Smells very bitter.
T - Sooo smooth for the ABV. This is very, very impressive. Strong initial bitter bite that quickly recedes to pine and a zesty floral taste. Very nice flavor and tastes really fresh. 
M - Very crisp and dry. Leaves you wanting another drink. Very nice carbonation.
O - Another excellent showing of hops from Stone. Very fresh taste. I really hope stone continues these drink by beers and can't wait to see what's in store. 839 charactersThePaleRider, Mar 03, 2013

4.57/5  rDev +3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The 4/1/13 batch. 
Poured from bomber to a snifter. Dense 1 and a half finger head, sort of beige in color. Minimal lacing on the initial pour, but more as I get further into the bottle. 
The smell is very unique on this beer. Very Piney and dank, kinda has a garlic nose almost. There is some citrus fruit in here, but almost masked by the other scents to me. 
Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and and yet extremely creamy. Really excellent! this might be my favorite aspect of this beer. The taste is very well balanced with a strong floral hop forwardness. Loads of pine hit first with a twinge of oil and spicey vegetable. A bit of sweetness in the malt hold the beer together well. A bit peppery with a long satisfying dry hoppy finish. 
Overall a very unique beer with some scents and flavors I have never tasted in a beer before. Absolutely not what i was expecting but good nonetheless. 894 characterssketchpunx, Mar 03, 2013

Forget color.
The smell is clean, clean hops -- sweet and bright, floral and tropical. I get passionfruit, and I love it.
The taste doesn't surprise after the nose. Really traditional west coast DIPA flavors -- pine, citrus, flowers, and tropical fruits -- plus that really well-rounded, full-bodied sort of completeness that you get in the Plinys. That mega-hoppiness without being too top-heavy on the flavor spectrum. Full, complete, round, balanced, etc. All those words that reflect that sense you get that this may be the best style of beer there is. 
And then there's this little kick, this dryness that let's you know that, yup, it's still Stone. You know how Stone feels. In sum, I'm really glad that they have made a big, wet DIPA that's pretty much the Platonic Form of the style while remaining unmistakably theirs. 
I'm getting to the bottom of this bottle, and the bitterness is starting to take hold, but I was ready for it. The gnar builds. If you can, drink a whole bottle -- it's worth witnessing the change.

Had the second batch and forgot to review, so I'm glad it's back in Ohio. Poured into tulip.
A- pours clear golden with a single finger white head, only small amount of lacing
S- amazing, floral, piney, tropical fruits, slightly bready 
T/M- follows the nose. Tropical fruits, floral hops, lemony zest, woody pine, faint honey, little to no malt, must crisp smooth hops. Texture isn't too thick, isn't too thin, its just right. Did I say it's smooth? 
O- damn this is good stuff, it's very drinkable for the style, not syrupy, not bitter, just refreshing. I hesitate opening beers so its nice to have one that demands I pop it open. If you're lucky enough to get one, buy as many as you can.... And then plaster it all over social media. 764 charactersbrewtus, Mar 03, 2013

A: Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with just over 1 fingers width of only slightly off white colored head. Decent retention. Leaves a small amount of lacing. 
S: Big, dank, resinous hop aromas. Juniper, pine. Very herbaceous. Sweet malt is present which providers a firm backbone. Hints of citrus with grapefruit and citrus rind. Awesome aroma. 
T: Doesn't quite live up to the nose, but tasty nonetheless. Strong malt presence. Hop bitterness. The hop characters area mostly pine, along with lemon zest/orange peel. 
M/D: Great mouthfeel. So smooth for the style, perfect amount of carbonation, no hint of the ABV, and drinkability is very good. 
O: Overall, this is a great DIPA. Im so glad the guys at my local bottle shop made me aware that there were a couple of these in the back! Just another beer to add to the list of great hoppy offerings from Stone. Im really not sure if anyone does hoppy beers better than these guys. Consistently pumping out great beers like Stone does is impressive. Looking forward to drinking this again in the future. 1,104 characterszac16125, Mar 03, 2013

Clear gold in color with just a touch of hop haze with a perfect 3 finger layer of pure white foam. There's a big oily juicy hop aroma on the nose with notes of grapefruit, oranges, and nectarines.
Medium body with a wonderfully creamy feel and an in-your-face hop flavor. The bitterness of the hops is well-tempered by a big, sweet malt backbone. The combination of chewy malt and oily hops is delightful in this beer. There is a faint vegetative scallion-like taste that I find a bit unpleasant, but the citrus notes of the hops are so intense, I'm willing to forgive it. The mouthfeel is divine. It's the creamiest IIPA I've had since FFF Dreadnaught.
A very good beer and devastatingly fresh. Very tasty, but falls far short of the hype it gets. Fresh Ruination is better than this (and the Ruination 10th Anniversary Ale Stone released completely blows this stuff away). 977 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Mar 03, 2013

A - Transparent gold/orange with a couple fingers of head that quickly dissipates into about half a finger.
S - Sweet malts, citrus fruits, herbal hops.
T - Lots of vegetal/garlicy hops with a bit of citrus and caramel malts. The alcohol doesn't come through at all in this one. Very aggressive hops, but not to bitter.
M - Thick and resiny with a lot of carbonation. Only other beer I've had that makes your mouth tingle this much is Heady Topper.
Very nice, but I'll probably stick with Ruination and Sublimely Self Righteous due to cost and availability. Great hop-forward DIPA though. 646 charactersRoninTK3, Mar 03, 2013

Terrific aroma, best part of the beer, rising notes of pine, resin, citrus and tropical pungent mangoes and pine apple. Pine resin is huge here, building and dank, some hint of underlying cereal malt. 
Huge quantities of hops impart a huge resin and dank pine with some vegetative herbaceous flavors near the back end with a steady bitterness. Lightly sweet malt is clean and steps aside easily. Warming alcohol and the hops really coat and desensitize the palate quickly. 
Adequate body and carbonation. Coating hops make the palate numb to a drying sensation. I feel quite a bit of alcohol warmth coming through.
It's about time a craft brewer really focused on the freshness of hops and really pushed the process of keeping ipas fresh to their distributors. Enjoy by is a top notch hop bomb, aroma is stellar, the taste is very dank and pine heavy, terrific DIPA. The best I've had from them thus far. 1,043 charactersrawfish, Mar 03, 2013

Really love the smell...resiney pine, tons of tropical fruits, citrus, and a bit of "weed" smell. Uber fresh!
Delicious...quite a bit of tropical fruits, lemon, pine, grass, and spice. Just a very small amount of caramel malt for posterity only...this is a hop heavy brew! Medium body and carbonation...nearly perfect for the style. This one coats your mouth with hoppy goodness.

4.08/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Excited to try another hoppy offering from stone. 
A- a golden yellow rich body with amber shades glowing. A frothy white head of foam bursts and then slowly subsides to a dusting of foam on the top. An intimidating ruination type appearance to say the least
S- a whiff of citrus lays out a template of pineapple, dank piney hops, and biscuity flavors. Strong caramel malt is at the backend with an adamant presence. I really feel the need to mention the resinous scent that enjoy by carries
T- very piney, resionious, dank hop flavor that blasts your palate. Bold caramel malt flavor rips into your palate and leaves no return. Some citrus theme is certainly there but a rip roaring citrus attack... This is not
M- coating flavor that literally prickles
O- I completely applaud stones enjoy by concept. While this was not my preferred hoppy presentation of a DIPA, it was still enjoyable. Thankful for the opportunity to try this 935 characterslovindahops, Mar 02, 2013
4/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served from tap into a shaker. Poured a golden yellow with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grass, grass hop, citrus hop, and spicy hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, grass hop, grass, onion hop, and spicy hop. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a good brew. This one had a pretty big explosion of hops going on here while still managing to be refreshing. There was quite a nice balance here as well. The aroma is quite inviting and the flavor has just enough hoppy resin in it to remind you of the style it falls under. A really well done brew that I would definitely have again. 774 charactersthagr81us, Mar 02, 2013

Served in a snifter, the beer pours a clear golden/orange color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's also a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like citrusy (grapefruit, mango, tropical fruit) and pine hops, along with a bit of bready malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some lemon peel, floral hops and a bit of onion. There's an enjoyable bitter hoppy finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and sticky with moderate carbonation. It's also easy enough to drink. I think it's a good brew overall, I hope Stone keeps making it (and Ohio keeps getting some). $6.99 a bottle. 703 charactersbluejacket74, Mar 02, 2013

A- Pours golden yellow with an off-white head. Lots of lacing.
S- Lots of grapefruit, pine, and onion. Sweet underlying pineapple.
T- Big grapefruit, pine, and bitterness followed by a massive amount of spicy ONION with garlic. Hints of pineapple in the background, but everything takes a back seat to the onion. Dank, and not to sound crazy, but maybe a bit of cellar-like funk. I could see this beer going well with a dish containing sauteed onions.
M- Medium body and decently high carbonation. A bit of a kick to it.

4.36/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Best by 04/01/2013 (obviously). 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.
Pours a clear and bright golden orange with a small, fluffy white head. The head disappears very quickly and leaves a small soap-like ring of foam on the glass. The lacing is just ok but it matches the head as light rings of foam are left on the glass. 
The hop profile in the nose is massive. Huge citrus and tropical fruits (grapefruit, mango and maybe some pineapple) give way to even bigger notes of resin and pine. There is a touch of malt sweetness but the hops dominate and it doesn't come through enough to pinpoint exactly what type it is. 
The taste follows the nose but it's both bolder and more balanced. The fruity notes from the hops lead the way again and they are juicy, citrusy and tropical. The malt shows itself a bit more as well. It's still sweet as it was in the nose but it brings a nice breadiness with it as well. The citrus hops and sweet malt balance nicely in each sip before giving way to the piny, resiny finish. Despite the huge resin notes in the nose and the big pine notes in the finish the bitterness is remarkably restrained. 
This beer drinks much lighter than a 9.4% ABV double IPA. The mouthfeel is very crisp and extremely clean. The carbonation is lively but soft. A lot of time lively carbonation brings a prickly sensation with it and it can be somewhat harsh with this much going on in the hop department. That's not the case here as the carbonation is spot on. 
This is an excellent beer overall and a top tier DIPA. It's extremely hop forward with enough malt to make it relatively balanced. Definitely a beer I'd like to see much more often, if not regularly. 1,682 charactersms11781, Mar 02, 2013

A-Poured into a snifter. It pours gold/honey with a somewhat thin white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Not much lacing left and no cascading.
S-Hops, hops, and more hops. Citrus and some pine, but you can tell this is going to be one hoppy beer.
T-Citrus, with a slight hint of tropical fruit, with a more piney bitter lingering hop finish. This is one of the hoppiest beers I think I've ever had. The hops are fresh, pungent, raw, and in your face. I was expecting a more tropical experience, but Stone focused on making this bitter. It is very good and a classic version of the style.
M-Pretty syrupy with a touch of carbonation.
D-I drank an entire bomber by myself without any problems, but this is really takes a toll on the palate.
Overall, this is a great IIPA. It is one of the most hoppy and bitter beers I've tried. I was expecting it to be more tropical, similar to Hopslam and Sucks but it was not very much like them at all. This is a hop lovers dream as it is in your face. This is a great beer, don't get me wrong, but given the price at about $8.60 a bomber, I think I will stick to Lagunitas Sucks at around $10 a sixer. 1,155 charactersthegodfather2701, Mar 02, 2013

So psyched that my buddy was able to snag a few over at Beverage Warehouse in Winooski (VT). We had been waiting for a few weeks and weren't sure if the shipment was going to make it up here.
Look - Pours golden with a tinge of copper and a minimal, frothy head. Filtered with some carbonation. Moderate lacing that stays.
Smell - Sweet malts with hops smoothly resting over it.
Taste - Carbonated malt and resin. Hops creep in after and settle surprisingly gently.
Mouthfeel - Amazingly drinkable, smooth and sweet with a great blend of hops.
Overall - BOOM. Stone's best brew to date. 656 charactersJMScowcroft, Mar 02, 2013

 Actually pasting my notes as I drink Enjoy By 04.01.13, which matches this review
From tap to tulip
A: copper-tan in color, clear. Small head leaves patching lacing everywhere 
S. lemony, earthy in the front. Lots of vege scents, onion especially. Ample alcohol lifts the dense bouquet. 
T: Typical IPA flavors at first - rind-y citrus, but the vegetable notes pop to the front. Onion, celery, bouillon. Sharp lemon-pepper blends well with ample alcohol. Everything resonates well. Completely unique IPA profile but still a distinctively West Coast style. Suprisingly short finish. 
Possibly the best beer Stone had come up with. Someone told me this was a Pliny clone, as Stone distributed for Russian river in ca, but its got its own groove. Same West Coast style, but definitely unique. 889 charactersrand, Mar 02, 2013

A: Crystal clear, golden-yellow with a huge, bubbly, bright white head that leaves behind decent lace and retention. Nothing crazy.
S: Massive hop profile. Like, nostril assault. Heavy resin and pine. Some citrus. But mainly the sappy, thick, pungent, fresh hop vine aroma. Astringent and strong like freshly cut citrus. Makes my eyes tear a bit...from the nose and from the beauty of the hope profile.
T: Super dry and heavy on the resiny, piney side of hops. No fruit or floral character if you're looking for that. Straight West Coast hops that slap you in the face with dry, resiny hops. Heavily hopped and reminiscent of Lagunitas' brews but without enough malt in the finish to balance it out.
M: Craaaazy hops. A bit cloying in the finish. Very dry and properly carbonated. Skunky, earthy, sizzly, hoppy of course, and ultimately palate-changing.
O: Pretty f'n awesome. Worth the hype? Yes. Top notch? For hop heads. Up there with the best? Nahhhh. It's great but it lacks balance and true character. Really a one-trick pony.
Update: 9/13/13 on draft...awesome! Massively bitter, huge hop aroma and flavor, dry, not much of an alcohol presence...everything a hop bomb should be. 1,218 charactersGatch, Mar 02, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Straight pour from a 22oz pry-off bottle to my tall Ommegang flute; freshness date is, well, pretty clear on this bad boy. My understanding is that this was bottled on February 22, which would therefore make this beer seven days old. Yep, it’s fresh as shit. 
Appearance (4.25): A solid three to four fingers of just-off-white, cream-colored foam rises from the pour, capping a crystal-clear, 24ct gold body. Quite handsome. The head devolves slowly to a raised cap in the middle, looking like a big meringue nipple, and leaves behind scattered, widely-spaced splotches of dense foam in little archipelagos. It has pretty nice retention, though, leaving some chunky stuff well into the glass, and leaves some fat collars which I like quite a bit, too. 
Smell (4.25): Juicy, sticky, citrusy nectar (mango, papaya, apricots, and passionfruit) melds with a resinous, piney-dank tone that suggests sweaty nuggets of hops and marijuana. The malt does come through a bit underneath, mainly sweet biscuit scents mixing with rich, fresh-baked bread, like a brioche—a bit sweet, a bit rich, very soft and tasty. 
Taste (4.25): As expected, the hops character is almost all flavor and almost no bitterness: sweet citrus again (pineapple with some lemon juice), covering a really very slight, resinous bitterness underneath. Some citrus pith, too, and red grapefruit flesh. The malt is again bready and sweet in that rich way, like brioche or challah, but carries a sweetness that mixes with the hops like iced lemon bundt cake. While it’s all flavoring and aroma hops, it seems, I will say that it’s quite good (liking it more and more as it warms, actually) but it’s not blowing me out of the water, either. But still, quite good. The dank hops flavor actually comes out as more and more bitter, with some spicy notes, actually, as it warms. Some booze, but it melds with that resin character well, so points for that. 
Mouthfeel (4.25): Soft carbonation giving a silky texture to a generally medium-weight (at most) body—the head sticks around long enough that some soft pillows pass the lips. It finishes definitively dry, but not parchingly so—still easy enough to drink in every regard that it’s hard to take it slow. 
Overall (4.25): This is a well-above-average DIPA, no question there. And it definitely delivers what it promises: the short shelf-life flavor and aroma hopping is here in spades, but I’m surprised at how little bitterness there is. Compare this to Ruination, for example, and the difference is clear as day. But this beer is very, very good, and I’m glad to have tried it. And super kudos to Stone for latching onto an idea (with the freshness initiative, as it were) and running with it to its logical extreme—who else would do that so well? 2,784 charactersfmccormi, Mar 02, 2013

The beer pours a clear, slightly coppery golden yellow with sticky white inch of head. The nose is potent citrus hops with a hint of grain sweetness and booze. The beer drinks very easily, like sugar dusted citrusy hops and has a mild, lingering grapefruit rind bitterness. It's certainly not drinking like a heavy IPA...as I'd expected with a 9.4% abv beer. The beer has near perfect balance, which is also surprising, as the intense hops and booze tame the sweet maltiness...or vice versa. Great IPA that drinks very easily and definitely hits the spot. 639 charactersThePorterSorter, Mar 02, 2013

22oz bottle poured into snifter. 
Appearance-pours golden orange, very little white head, lacing sticking around longer then expected. 4.25
Aroma-grapefruit, orange, mango, pineapple, honeysuckle, fresh floral, brown sugar 4.5
Taste-not as strong citrus as aroma but still prevalent. Grapefruit, dried apricot, piney, mango, hint of maple, green apple. 4.5
Feel-medium to full bodied, coats mouth fully, great bitter aftertaste, feels like a Double. 4.75
Overall-One thing stone does right, their beer is bold and feels bold. It might not be the tastiest double out their but it holds it own. Where this beer really leads the pack is in the mouthfeel, its thick, hoppy, and bitter, the three things I want in a double.

Appearance: Pours a clear pale gold with a very substantial white head - about 2 inches with an aggressive pour. Good head retention. Leaves a very nice lacing.
Smell: Huge blast of pine and grapefruit. A little bit of tropical fruit sneaks in there with mango and papaya. There are floral and grassy notes as well, along with a honey sweetness. Slight alcohol presence. Very strong hop profile on this one.
Taste: Not quite as potent as the aroma, but still pretty damn impressive. Again, big citrus, floral, and pine flavors. Bittering hops hit right away and stay around through the finish. The honey flavor present in the aroma is here as well. Alcohol is definitely present in the finish - the only noticeable flaw. The flavor profile is quite similar to Hopslam, but with more bittering hops (and a bit more tropical fruit presence), and a bitmore noticeable alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Stays fairly crisp despite the big body. The bittering hops on the finish dry the palate nicely.
Overall: Phenomenal. The best way to describe it is Hopslam with more bittering hops. 1,132 charactersemyers, Mar 02, 2013

Clear gold with a slender, bubbly white head. Smells hoppy! Pine, pineapple, grapefruit, and a tangerine sweetness. A subtle hint of rubber. The flavor is oily, pulpy citrus, ripe fruit, and dry, resinous pine with a pale malt sweetness buried underneath. Definitely bitter, but smooth and not hampered by booziness, which allowed me to suck down my ten ounces pretty quickly. I love the idea and hope they send some more in the direction of NC sometime soon. Very good!

Smell- Huge hop blast before you even get your nose to the glass, the smell is incredible, huge cascade citrus, a little pine, somewhat candylike sweetness. not malty at all
Taste- amazing dry hop flavor up front, very citrusy and fruity, a pleasantly strong bitterness that is very intense but not crushing, malt is pretty laid back and does just enough to support the hops with a pleasant grainy flavor. warming alcohol comes through in the end.
mouthfeel- good carbonation
Overall- This beer is incredible, it drinks as easy as a single ipa, but packs a hop punch that is amazingly intense and yet not too bitter. 697 charactersmt24turner, Mar 01, 2013

The smell wasn't misleading! Huge mango, orange, pineapple, pine, pepper and mild sweet bread. So yeah- lots of fruity hop flavor. And my description doesn't do it justice. This goes down much smoother than you may expect for over 9% abv.

Big grapefruit aroma, even with your nose away from the glass. Nice toasted malt notes as well.
Toasted malt, alcohol, big citric hop notes. A very bright beer. As the flavors clear on the palate, you get a bit of an alcoholic burn on the tongue. Nice balance of hop and malt on the finish. Some pucker and astringency.
Medium to fuller bodied. Funny, a little hot. As much as you want this one fresh, I wonder if another month or 2 would calm this down.
Overall, really nice beer. Brilliant marketing, even if it puts pressure on your favorite liquor store to push this beer before it obviously past prime. 697 charactersOtherShoe2, Mar 01, 2013

A: Pours a clear light golden with a dense white head. Fairly slow moving visible carbonation. A spotting of lacing. 
S: Instantly hit with a blend of a variety of hops. Spiciness, floral, citrusy, earthy, nuggety smell. Mild malts in the background provide the Stone signature oomph. 
T: Very tasty, a complex blend of hops with a fairly decent hop backing. Certainly a bold and bitter beer. Is there alcohol in this? A sweet bready/crackery malt comes through as it warms. 
M: Medium body with a nice nectar like quality. Very easy drinking and quite a refreshing brew.

S: Huge citrisy hop profile. Grapefruit, orange zest, lemon, you name the citrus, it's included. Some resin in the midst of the nose and the malt is crisp and smooth but lets the big time hop profile take center stage.
T: Beautiful hop palate destruction time. Again the citrus hops hit first, the resiny pine hops come through second and the malt bill comes and cleans the stage up but leaves the delicious oils to coat.
M: Crisp, sharp, biting finish. Perfectly carbonated and the hop oils leave a beautiful coating that refuses to let me stop drinking until it's gone.

Identifies as a DIPA on the label. 9.4% ABV confirmed. Expectations are high given its reputation, but I'm not a big Stone fan. Still, I do enjoy some of their beers from time to time - which are often collaborations. Hm. 1 pint 6 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. 
Served straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
A good brief hiss as I opened it. No issues with beer surging out or anything. 
A: Pours a 2.5 finger head of beige colour, decent cream, nice thickness, and rather good (5+ minute) retention for the high ABV. Lacks the appealing froth I'd expect from the head of a good Imperial IPA. Light sticky lacing as the head recedes. Body colour is a surprisingly pale yellow-copper; it lacks the vibrance of other good beers in the style. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Overall, it's above average but there's nothing unique or special here. Transparent and translucent. 
Sm: A bit soapy, with assertive grapefruit but none of the grapefruit bite of inferior IIPAs. Floral and piney, with light nectary character. Sticky pale malts form the foundation and seem to be of good sweetness to balance the hops. Some oily hop notes. A pungent, pleasing aroma. Appealing if a bit too assertive. The soapiness bothers me, but hopefully it's just an aromatic flaw. A pleasant aroma of moderate strength. No yeast character or alcohol is detectable. 
T: Floral and nectary, with pleasant grapefruit throughout. Unfortunately, untamed bitterness strikes in the late second act and climax, joined by an unpleasant overly sweet malty character that unsuccessfully tries to hide it. Up front, it's refreshingly creamy just after the open - a great welcome to the refreshing pale malt body. Amplitude is relatively low, especially for the style. And light soapiness indicates this spent too long in primary. Little pine comes through - a missed opportunity. The intrusive bitterness really kills the balance, but it's not a severe issue. The beer is still pleasant throughout. It's got depth of flavour, but lacks complexity or subtlety. The finish feels weak and somewhat muted compared to the open and body. Structurally, then, it's a bit problematic. Some tame grassy character about the climax. Somewhat resiny in the second act. I don't get yeast character. There is a bit of alcohol presence, but it's by no means boozy or hot. All around an enjoyable beer in the style. 
Mf: Smooth and wet. Nicely nectary/oily. A touch overcarbonated - surprising for a beer so clearly intended to be consumed shortly after leaving the brewery. Palate presence is pretty good; I get all of the flavour easily. Suits the flavour profile well. 
Dr: This Imperial IPA misses the most important feature of the style - balance. The bitterness is not well hidden enough. It's somewhat refreshing, but the presence of alcohol in the flavour profile reduces drinkability. I'm not impressed with the choices of hops either; the floral character feels generic, grapefruit is too prominent, and there's little pine. Additionally, the soapy character is a clear indicator of a brewing issue. Though this is one of the better beers I've had that's brewed by Stone alone, I definitely don't think it's worth seeking out. The gimmicky marketing doesn't affect my score, but it's definitely a trend I hope to see fade. Many will love this beer and defend that love with a curious argument about types of Imperial IPAs. So be it. I wish I enjoyed this as much as those individuals do, but I look for balance in every beer - regardless of style - and Imperial IPAs do not get special treatment because of an ostensible regional take on the style. (And while we're on the subject, Alpine and Port are both West Coast breweries that reliably churn out very balanced Imperial IPAs). In any case, Stone didn't fall as far from the mark as I anticipated when beginning to review this. Drinkable but not without its flaws. I won't be buying this again or recommending it to friends.

Appearance is a golden/brassy blond, with smallish bubbles and little head. This might be due to the fact i bought a second growler to enjoy today following my first liter on the release day. The aroma is outstanding; floral, herbal hops with hints of tropical fruit lingering in the back. This is a fresh IPA to be sure. More tropical notes and some citrus across the palate, and a fine balance between bitterness and maltiness. The 9.4% is completely hidden until you've had a few pours! I love the fact you can detect the potent hop aromas before the glass is in your face. Solid, solid piece of brewing. 705 charactersdannydetox, Feb 28, 2013

4.76/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Took a little while to transfer my notes to the forums. Based on a bottle of 2.15.13 in a tulip.
A - Pours a clear golden body throughout, exactly what I would expect from Stone. Two fingers of head, which holds nicely.
S - Probably the most amazing part of this beer. The Smell is absolutely incredible, filling the room with strong hints of pine and citrus. It smells like cutting down a christmas tree when I was a kid. 
T&M- massive earthy hops come through immediately, and last through your next sip. The taste is exactly what you would expect given the initial nose of this beer. Really wakes up your palate.
O - I have never been disappointed in a Stone product, even those that have been backed by incredible hype. This beer follows that same trend. Overall, this is one of the better IPAs I have had. Hoping to receive another shipment to VA! 856 charactersjasoncheb, Feb 27, 2013

A- clear burnt orange copperish...just moved and am now noticing what terrible light my new beer drinking room has. half a fingers worth of white head that sticks around longer than most.
S- oh man! riper than ripe fruits. juicy tangerine, mango, orange, pineapple, papaya, passion fruit...just a full on cornucopia of ripe tropical fruits. a very faint bready sweetness in the background to round all those fruits out.
T- a strong grapefruity bitterness right in the front of the tongue. I'm getting more pine in the taste than in the aroma thats for sure. keeps opening up with a nice bitter florally finish. this is a masterfully crafted IPA!
m- very sticky, and resinous, but unbelievably smooth. this does not drink like an almost 10% brew at all. 
O- this beer isnt a palatte ruiner like its older brother ruination. this beer is a palette assassin. your palate is gonna be finished before it even knew what hit it. having just had tried the younger 8 days ago i have to say, at this point, i think i prefer this beer over PtY. 1,102 charactersedproctor, Feb 27, 2013

A: Clear copper with off-white head. Good retention.
S: Big on the pine, resin and flower hops. Mango, pineapple and a bit of grapefruit. A bit of caramel hidden behind all the hops. Boozy.
T: Much like the nose: Big on the pine and flowery hops. Pineapple, mango, and tangerines. Aftertaste is citrus peels (tangerines and grapefruit). Big, aggressive, and assertive. 
M: Medium-full bodied, fine carbonation, and a bit dry. Coats the whole mouth with a bitter hoppiness. 
O: Big hop bomb, exactly what I was expecting from stone. A bit unbalanced and a bit boozy but is played off well. If you're a fan of DIPAs, give this a shot. 646 charactersarfenhouse, Feb 27, 2013

T: A great blend of tropical and piney hop notes and caramel malt flavors. A smooth, almost buttery mouthfeel without becoming syrupy. Finish brings a boatload of pine hop resin. Really, really good. 410 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 27, 2013

Appearance: Beautiful golden color, crystal clear, the head disperses to the sides but remains in tact. Lacing shows a little bit of creaminess.
Smell: Lots of grapefruit and some honey in it. Aroma at just the right intensity. A little skunky, not bad or anything though.
Taste: So bitter, malt is in the background and has notes of honey. Very bitter taste and grapefruit characteristics. Medium finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, perfect amount of bubbles, leaves a crisp refreshing feeling.
Overall: Sometimes the bitter is a little overpowering, that's one comment I will make about the overall balance. However, this beer is filled with complexity as well as a crisp, clean finish. 800 charactersTherisse, Feb 26, 2013

Very, very sweet and fresh hops reminiscent of a lot of Lagunitas beers with none of the bitterness typically associated with Stone. Maybe my favorite Stone beer, along with Sublimely Self-Righteous. 394 charactersfalc0n2600, Feb 26, 2013

A - Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a finger of off-white head that has some real staying power.
S - Big earthy hops in the initial smell. Sharp pine and pineapple lead the assult.
T/M - Big earthy hops come thru in the taste just as the smell suggests. The malt profile is pretty carmel-ey, and a little smokey...? I love the hoppy resinous aftertatse that stays with me. Medium slick mouthfeel, good carbonation.
O - Stone does IPAs like Ferarri does sportscars! This one, like many others from Stone, doesn't dissapoint at all. A hoppy DIPA that hits all the right notes. Alcohol isn't noticable at all. Great hop profile that's not shy to stick around for a while.
Thanks again to Jeremy6566 for sending this one my way! Cheers! 867 charactersRizalini, Feb 20, 2013

Aroma is the first sign that this beer is going to be great. The Hops stand out. Fresh hoppy citrus smell...what fruit or citrus is a mystery to me.
Taste is very hop forward...hops...hops...mysterious fruit flavor , hops. As strange as it sounds that this is a good taste, I also feel as if I could clean my oven or scrub my shower with this stuff. A fresh , clean taste that lingers on the palate... amazing.
Medium bodied mouthfeel that leaves a resinous feeling ...and again, the fresh hops linger!
I am very impressed with this offering from Stone. Not many beers live up to the hype, but Enjoy By is Legit. If you see it on the shelves, scoop it up because it won't be there long. 815 charactersHoptimus-Prime, Feb 19, 2013

A - Light orange yellow with a small white head

MF - Light body with slight syruipiness to it. Light body with nice resin remaining in the tongue

A - Crazy clear beer. Like "the bottle looks like its filled with water" clear. Beautiful golden amber body with some rising carbonation. Two to three fingers worth of fluffy off white foam which settles down quickly leaving behind some serious lacing with retention that will outlast the beer. Even swirling this beer is sexy as tons of rapid carbonation floods the surface of the beer right below the head. I'm a sucker for unfiltered IPA's, but this is hands down the best looking filtered IPA I have ever seen. 
S - The hop bill is pretty insane and its very apparent. This is just a cluster fuck of hops varieties. Grapefruit, orange juice, pine, danky dank, peaches and a slight hint of savory onions. There really is a lot happening here, but the beauty of the beer is how damn fresh it is and each hop is in its glory here.
T - Despite an unbelievably complex and busy nose, the taste is actually rather straight forward. Bitter and juicy grapefruit, peaches, and a dash of pine. Very bitter finish with a light onion savoriness on the very tippy end. The bitterness does seem to wipe everything away and mute flavors out.
M - Thick and creamy with perfect carbonation. 
O - A pretty impressive and damn near perfect IPA with a wide array of hops on display. I love the idea behind the beer, I love how deadly serious Stone is about it, and I love that nose and flavor. I'll be salivating for each batch and I hope CT gets it again. I will say that I was a bit less impressed when having it on tap though. 1,657 charactersdavey101, Feb 16, 2013

Pours a light golden, clear body. Head is sticky and fluffy white goodness.
Aroma is hops, as one would expect. Grapefruit, some mango, pine, persimmon, floral. Not a whole lotta malt going on. Soft biscuit. For a dIPA the balance isn't there, but it's not a bad whiff
Taste is the aroma. Hops. Floral, citrus, some pine. A bit of spice and biscuit get trampled. For a dIPA this misses that mark. Sure, loads of hops, but no balance and it's really not that intense, as far as the feel goes. But, this is a beer meant to be imbibed fresh, so I take that into consideration.
As a result, the difference between this fresh beer and other non-fresh IPAs isn't all that great. Sure, it's a very nice beer. Which characteristics suffer with age, and to what extent? We'll never know...or will we? 827 charactersMebuzzard, Feb 10, 2013

A: pours a clear light gold with a half inch of white head that fades to a small pool
S: smells of pine, grapefruit, earthy hops, and tropical fruit. 
T: tastes of earthy hops, pine, citrus, a bit of tropical fruit, some alcohol and a slight sweetness to bring a bit of balance. very light caramel sweetness flavor. aftertaste is oily hops and pine resin and just a bit of sugary sweetness on the very back end
M: lighter side of medium in the mouth with slightly prickly carbonation. slightly drying at first but then quickly juicy
O: Very good beer. Heavily hopped and fantastic hop flavors. malt provides just a bit of balance but allows the hops to really shine. I wanted to get to this one sooner but tylenol and beers don't mix well. 757 charactersSHODriver, Feb 09, 2013

A - one of the few beers I feel like deserves a high appearance rating. Translucent honey color. Cotton white foam, initially a 2 inch head, reduces to a quarter inch crown that retains the entire time.
S - kind of disappointingly muted. Lemon peel, some tropical notes, but not big at all. Smells nice, but I wanted some more "in your face."
T - bitter lemon peel, citrus, mango, ends in a piney note, quick and bitter finish. Overall, very good. There are some onion/shallot type notes that are kind of hanging around, never noticed or identified this in an IPA before, not bad, just interesting. Some juicier mango tropical notes come out it warms up. A really outstanding tasting IPA.
M - pretty much perfect. Creamy, medium carb, just thick enough.
O - a really excellent IPA. A/A+. If there were out year round, I'd be hard pressed to drink any other IPA. 930 charactersBeerandboards, Feb 06, 2013

Kegged on 1.11.13, sampled 5 days later.
[A] One finger of bright white foamy head, moderate retention. The body is brightly clear and polished brassy orange in color. A minimal amount of lace slathers the glass. Very attractive.
[S] Starts off with juicy tropical fruits of orange, tangerine, and light papaya or mango. Then, summit-like qualities provide a faint but distinct aroma similar to onion grass and chives. Not digging it so much now personally, but my threshold for these aromas in IPAs is low. Begins at a '4.5' and drops a full point.
[T] Again, there is an initial burst of tropical hop character. A light melon flavor comes through on the back end. After the first few sips, the tropical blend all but disappears when the beer fully opens up. The beer is still pretty good, just not as impressive as it was just minutes ago. 
[M] Medium full body, smooth, semi thick body, the carbonation kicks in at the perfect moment. The strength is well concealed for a gravity of this height. [Sidenote: 2.15.13 was listed at 9.2% instead of the 9.4% listed on BA.]
[O] Started out with a bang, but transformed and dropped off quickly. I had pours from two separate keg and my experience was the same each time. 1,245 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Feb 03, 2013

A: It has a hazy yellow appearance with a ivory white head that lasts for the length of the beer.
S: Amazing. You can tell that the beer you are about to enjoy is hoppy from across the room. There are very strong citrus and pine resin notes to it.
T: Very hoppy but it has the caramel malts to back it up. The are pleasant notes of citrus, pine, caramel, toffee, and bitterness.
M: Perfect. The is a silky smooth texture mixed with the perfect amount of carbonation.
O: Get this beer at all costs. It is one of the best IPAs out there. 570 charactersjvillefan, Feb 03, 2013

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Fourth Batch 02.15.13 Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Bright yellowy orange color. Crystal clear with many medium sized carbonation bubbles that lead to small one finger head. Head is a tad bit off white and creamy in appearance. Lace is sticking just a bit and does an okay job down to the bottom.
Smell is wonderful!! Lots of citrus, orange, pink grapefruit. Some pineapple and even some mango. Pine sap as well. Some kind of sweet malt smells but no hint of earth or grass. This is about as close of a nose to Abrasive I have smelled. Quite nice.
Taste is very bright and fruity. Juicy I would like to say. Many of the tastes are as the nose pointed me. Sweet orange, and pineapple. The grapefruit is more on the bitter side of a yellow grapefruit. There is a big tongue lashing pine resin to it and sweet as well. I am not getting any of sources of the sweetness like huge malts. There is just a hint of the alcohol at the end.
Mouth is wonderful. Creamy feel with medium carbonation. Body is smooth and rich. Finish is quite long with just a smidge of alcohol burn. Fantastic mouth!!
Overall I must say this is fantastic IIPA. Stone has made a statement with this brew and that is to get an IPA out to distro and into my belly as quick as possible. They don't win if this is successful I do. And the beer is fantastic with huge hop profiles that scream fresh West Coast IIPA. Cheers to Greg and the crew! 1,417 charactersazdback, Feb 02, 2013

T - Grass, light citrus, grapefruit again.
D - Good carbonation with a light body.
O - Lots of grass, a touch of bitter, but pretty good.
Edit: 4.20.13 batch
More bready and sweet than the previous bottle. Sticky and chewy in the mouth. I prefer the previous batch. 454 charactersHuskyinPDX, Jan 31, 2013

crystal clear copper color with champagne like bubbles that form a long lasting tan head with great lace.
smell is caramel, pine, skunk (in a good way), sweet fruit, and, dare I say, beef jerky?. The warmer it gets, the better is smells. 
Taste is caramel perfectly balanced with piney hops, then some honey, and sweet fruit. Maybe a touch of dark chocolate in the finish? Alcohol is completely hidden within the flavors.
Mouth, when colder, is crispy and smooth. Prickly and medium bodied with a dry and warming finish. As it warms a bit, it gets less crispy, and more velvety.
Overall, a great IPA. Extremely easy to drink, and definitely worth the hype. A must try if you get the chance. 762 characterssearsclone, Jan 31, 2013

4.13/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a brandy snifter. Enjoy by 15 February 2013.
A: Pellucid gold, with sticky whiteish lacing clinging to the edges of the glass.
S: Disappointingly, considering the presumed hop profile, it's full of chives. Slight citrus (tangerines), but generally, blegh.
T: It's like you made a clementine popsicle (those ones you make as children out of orange juice concentrate) but then someone snuck in some hops and melted it then carbonated it and then bottled it. It's pretty damn tasty, deceptively strong, and surprisingly soft on the finish, not bitterly dry at all. The endtaste has all the tropical hops for which I'd hoped, papaya and grapefruit and oh my! Tasty.
M: Full, subtle, and nice.
O: I'm a little on the fence about this one. It's a pretty great DIPA, but it wasn't quite as good as I'd hoped. Recommended, certainly, but I'm not sure the hype is deserved? I'd love to try it fresh on-tap.
Hops (for 2012 version): Super-Galena for bittering. Simcoe, Delta, and Amarillo, then whirpool-hopped with Motueka, Citra, Cascade. Dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin and Galaxy. 1,113 charactersAgentMunky, Jan 30, 2013

Really fresh beer and so far my favorite stone beer.

Aroma is bright citrus, pine fresh hops. Not much malts. Overall not what i would expect from Stone descent but not mind blowing.
Taste is like the aroma not much malts noticed just bright hops fruity mango, tobacco notes with pine resin notes in the finish. whole thing seems light for Stone even hops are not over the top body even seems light, would of never guessed this one was more then 6%.
Mouthfeel is light for a double IPA carbonation is light side.

The aroma featured a lot of piney hops, and had some citrus notes as well. There was no real malt in the aroma. The flavors were basically the same, many bright hops all across the tongue, no balancing malt flavors, and a bitter citrus finish.
The body was good, even and clean, but was a bit thin for my preferences. Drinkability was good, if you're in the mood for a nice IPA, you won't go wrong with a couple of these. Overall, a nice example of the style, but one that's not particularly special or notable. I suspect the high ratings here are partially the result of hype over the marketing gimmick. Worth trying if you see a batch. 813 charactersbeertunes, Jan 29, 2013

T-Fresh hop taste, strong but not overwhelming with a background of citrus and a light malty finish
M-Smooth with a medium body and light carbonation

4.09/5  rDev -7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance - Pours a crystal clear, bright golden orange with a white, half finger head and sub-par retention. Fair, somewhat spotty lacing with good stick.
Smell - Aroma hits on ruby red grapefruit, touches of pineapple, peppery spice and pine. Faint astringency.
Taste - Big, bittersweet ruby red grapefruit character. Moderate pine resin. Hints of pepper. Malts aren't tasted so much as they are felt, though they definitely contribute to the sweetness.
Mouthfeel - Medium to full body. Moderate carbonation. Somewhat sticky, though smooth going down. 
Overall - I can't help but think Lagunitas when drinking this beer. Reminds me of Sucks, without the more definitive malt backbone. Definitely scratches the same itch. Great beer, but for the price, I'll stick with Sucks. 781 charactersTheSixthRing, Jan 28, 2013

Poured from a growler into a Stone tasting glass (one of my current favs), a clear, golden-orange liquid with a foamy white head that retained well and left some dots of lacing on the glass. An obvious hit of hops in the nose, citrus, pine, grass...fresh and good. More of the same in the taste, hop-dominant, notes of citrus, pine resin, fresh-cut grass, ammonia, biscuity malt base and toasted grains in the background. Medium body, fresh, but more oily than crisp--expected for a Stone beer. Very good overall.

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Aroma was potent right from lift off. A hop bouquet of citrus, mostly of sutle tangerine and maybe pineapple. Malts are sweet and bready.
Equally enticing is the appearance. Brilliant clarity in this autumn amber. A fine head sits on top which has a dense and solid body. Retention is good in that the head lingers and refreshs easily with a gentile swirl. Sticky lacing on the glass as the beer level drops (which is common when I drink) and gentil carbonation.
Taste is sweet and bitter. A very hoppy ale and is equally bitter, sweet malts counteract the bitters a tad.
Flows easy across the palette with minimal effort and finishes again sweet and bitter that lingers well into the aftertaste.
Everthing works for this beer, aroma appearance and taste. I applaud Stone for thier attempt to ensure fresh beer. I get tired of buying premium beer at premium prices only to have it stale or old. PUT THE DAMN DATE ON THE DAMN BOTTLE.

Appearance: Beautiful clear golden orange with foamy off white head. Nice lacing.
Smell: Ridiculous amounts of citrus and tropical fruit hops and a big whiff of dank. A touch of sweet pale malt aroma. Just fantastic.
Taste: A literal explosion of hops. Well, a figurative explosion. Grapefruit, orange, apricot, peach, pine, and sticky bud resin. Its all hops, but not all bitter. There's some balancing sweetness. Clean finish.
Mouthfeel: Avoids the overly full feel of many DIPAs. Carbonation gives a lively feel. Very dry on the end (the slightest bit too dry) with residual sticky hops resin.
Overall: I knew this would be good, but damn, its amazing. Have to go stock up on some more of these. 764 charactersrapidsequence, Jan 26, 2013

S: Hits the nose almost immediately. I could smell this all day long. Seriously. So fresh, so floral. I'm finding that the bitterness of the hops comes out over the course of the beer.
T: This is not as bitter as you might guess given the aroma. I think this is probably a good think. If this beer were as bitter as it is aromatic, it would be overwhelmingly. There is, however, a bitter aftertaste which seems to build progressively.
M: Smooth with a medium-to-full body. Goes down very easily.
O: This might just be my perfect beer. What more could you hope for from a classic West Coast IPA? It is not as balanced as PtE, but at that point we're comparing ridiculously good apples to ridiculously good oranges. 862 charactersWSGosset, Jan 26, 2013

The bouquet on this beer is just heavenly. Deliciously fresh citric hops hit the nose with a piney, almost peppery bite. This is much reminiscent of an Alpine style IPA. I've been waiting for Stone to wow me like this for some time now. This beer is 9.4%? It's hard to tell, as I smell all hops and very little malt character or alcohol. 
The taste has dominant orange and grapefruity hop twang. A light sweet balance from the malt is nice, though it's relatively clean and allows the hops to shine through. Moderate bitterness at the back, I don't really taste too much alcohol but there definitely is some warmth. The mouthfeel is nice, mostly clean with fine zesty carbonation, perhaps slightly syrupy though. 
The hop bitterness is now lingering excellently. This is a fantastic west coast IPA, and being so fresh is imperative. I've felt like Stone needed to keep up with some of the amazing IPA's from the likes of Alpine or Russian River, and this beer can do that. Hopefully this will be available from time to time as I will be sure to pick it up whenever I see it. Highly recommended. 1,211 charactersbennetj17, Jan 24, 2013

Enjoy By pours a golden amber color with excellent head retention and considerable sticky lacing all around. Have to say, this is a nice looking IPA from Stone. The nose is every bit as attractive, as I pick up considerabley dry citrus, white pepper and pine. There's a slight skunky aroma as well, along with some light soap. This beer has all the tell tale signs of a serious hop bomb. On the palate, this is just the way I like my IPA's. There's barely enough malt to handle the intense hoppy bitterness in this beer, and so the mouthfeel actually seems bit lean and thin. However, for this style of beer I think that's fine, though a touch more malt wouldn't have been such a bad thing. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this excellent beer, and the finish is long and bitter. Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and frankly I was surprised to find this is such a big beer (really do not get much sense of the 9.4% abv., though certainly you can tell it's up there a bit). 
An altogether excellent, impressive beer from the talented folks at Stone. Definitely a beer made with hopheads in mind.
There seems to be some variation from edition to edition (which one would expect). Just tried the Enjoy by 9/13 version, and while good, I thought it paled in comparison to the version I tried back in 1/13. So glad I just ordered a half pint of it at 16 tons. 1,438 charactersJohn_M, Jan 23, 2013

A: No head, no lacing, but lots of bubbles from the bottom of upon pour. Nice, light, yellow, and 100% clear. Right now it appears to be almost gone.
S: As soon as we cracked open the bottle, I smelled the grapefruit and citrus aromas from a few feet above. What you'd expect - but still great. 
T: What I've grown to love out of a good IPA. It's not too sweet and syrup-y the whole way through. It's not overwhelmingly bitter from start to finish, either. The finish has just enough bitterness to compliment the early grapefruit/citrus/sweetness. It's an adventure in every sip.
M: Thin but fitting. Clear beginning, middle, and end to each sip. Just enough carbonation.
O: Hopefully this keeps coming around the East Coast and I feel like this is a bold move on Stone's part in the efforts to get distributors/shops/bars to keep their beer fresh. Would love to buy this again, just maybe at half the price or a little above that.

Moderate pour yields a 1 and a 1/2 inch white head over a slightly hazy light golden body with some sticky lacing. Nose of pine, citrus, and tropical fruit.

Smells of big pine notes with some citrus as well.
Tastes of the big hop notes with a solid malt backbone. Hops lead off with an ever present tropical fruitiness laced with grapefruit. Pine notes hit on the backend as the bitterness makes its way through. Sweet notes lead off with the fruits that fades nicely into the hoppy bitterness making it feel fairly balanced in the end. Malts are quite bready and lays a solid foundation for all of the hoppy goodness.
Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation.
Overall, this is quite tasty and better than I expected. 660 charactersocelot2500, Jan 22, 2013

Pours two fingers of white head with a clear orangey gold body.
Immediate sweet peachy notes just jump out of the glass. Orange and some astringent grapefruitiness. Light pine under the fruit. Floral notes as well. Lovely smelling IPA. As it warmed a bready toasted character became more prevalent as did some caramel and the alcohol. 
Holy hops. Get more of the piney resinous thing going on in the taste. Grapefruit. My tongue was assaulted by a bone dryness and bitterness. It's not totally hops as there is some detectable bready malt but it's really about the hops. 
Great smooth body on this with mild carbonation.
I love a big ridiculous IPA like this every now and then. 709 charactersMattSweatshirt, Jan 22, 2013

Nose is simply a delight with a medley of tangerine, grapefruit, and pears. Palate offers a candied malt presence that is overtaken by the hop bitterness and fruity flavors - those that were noted in the aroma. Alcohol presence is completely masked. Light to medium bodied. Sinfully easy to drink.

Shared one of these yesterday at a tasting, sitting down with a bottle for a review tonight.
Pours a bright and clear gold color with a pretty nice white head. Nice looking beer.
Aromas are great, pineapple, pine and floral notes. A just a general fresh green resin smell. 
Taste is slightly sweet up front, sugar, cream, and hard candies. Finish is bitter, with some resin, green floral fresh hops, pineapple, white wine, and earthiness. Tastes good, but I like the smell a bit better.
Mouthfeel is smooth, full, with nice crisp carbonation.
Overall, a very nice fresh IPA. One of the better Stone beers I've had in awhile. 648 charactersflexabull, Jan 21, 2013

The beer is crystal clear and appears a radiant golden hue. The head measures in at approximately a half inch, leaving sparse lacing on the pint glass. The aroma brings tangy citrus and tropical fruit. Smells awesome. The flavor is also exquisite. A hop bomb with notes of pine and a bouquet of tropical fruit. Pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied and bit sticky on the palate. Highly drinkable with alcohol presence dangerously well hidden. Not only the best IPA I have had from Stone, but the best beer I have had from them overall. A world class IPA. Delicious. 650 charactersHuhzubendah, Jan 20, 2013

Great clarity. Amber/orange in this light. Soppy little foam cap. Quaint look.
Tropical fruits, citrus, and pine. Papaya, grapefruit, orange, and grated lemon. Biscuit malts are in attendance, as well.
Dank citrus and tropical fruit hops pour out grapefruit, lemon, and papaya. Resinous oils remind of sappy pine. Malts have a mellow pale sweetness. Bitterness is surprisingly mild. Just an excellent DIPA.
Drinks smooth, with a light bitter burn in the throat. Carbonation creams the beer a bit. Plus feel.

The smell, ohh that smell. The hops are singing sweet baby making love in here.
First impression of appearance is not a stunner , but first drink is an eyepopping mouthful of hoppy gymnastic sex. The balance is perfect, you could easily drink this as a sessionable if it was 6 or 7 ABV. Want to drink another , sadly I dont have one.

A - pale straw yellow with nice white lacing
S - pine scented aroma
T - citrus hoppy explosion with just the right amount of sweetness on the back. Very full flavor that coats the tong with pine needle and tannin-like forwardness. It is 'in your face' while still being balanced between the hops and sweetness. 
M - medium to full bodied without being syrupy. 
O - great beer. This is my favorite from Stone and holds up with the best of the seasonal double IPA's. 518 charactersChrisB, Jan 20, 2013

A- pours a crystal clear shade of orange with a two finger white head. Perfect. Exactly what I'm looking for in an IPA
S- tropical hops absolutely punch you in the face. So much citrus going on. Insane
T- not overly bitter. There's a little bit of sweetness, and tons of tropical fruit flavors as well. Very juicy, dank hops. Wonderful
M- medium bodied, not syrupy at all. Awesome

An absolutely gorgeous looking brew. Body is crystal clear with a mix of carbonation, rising through a gorgeous brassy bronze orange. As it settles more pinhead bubbles come slowly rising, with a big column of fire in the middle. Head is creamy topped with off white color, ballons to an easy three maybe two and a half fingers. Always sticks around, and leaves a good collar.
Hop front on this beer hits at fruity angles. Hints of giant juicy orange, and tropical mango. Sweetness is dialed down, but there's a leafy green chewy fresh hop sense coming with the beer and a great sense of depth that is all balanced nicely.
Palate is just a pure hop ride. Big hits at first of juicy orange, with the matching tropical notes. However the after taste hits with an incredible amount of dank earthy quality that belows out. Afterfinish coats your lips and palate all over. Sweetness is just about right without a lot of sugary or syrup tendencies. While the beer warms there's even herbal orange pekoe tea sense, that makes a great sweetness ever so slightly, and even pine needle like blasts on the palate. Big feel without a lot to ruin the flavor, or take away from the hop experience.
An absolutely wonderful hop running rollercoaster of a beer, that all manages to stay balanced. What a fun ride. 1,354 characterssmakawhat, Jan 19, 2013

A: Very transparent in appearance with a medium shade of amber, mostly hues of light orange. Very sparse white head leaving only a ring in the glass. Some spotted soap-like bubbles left on the glass but no lacing.
S: Huge hop aroma! Smells like fresh hop pellets in a bag. Some pine scent along with a tangerine scent, some light catty scent. I'd say overall the citrus-like tangerine is the strongest. Very pleasant to smell.
T: It has a mellow bitterness...kind of soft actually. It is similar to biting off a bit of orange rind. Very mellow pine flavor as well. Some grain flavor peeps in every now and then. No alcohol flavor at all.
M: The mouthfeel consists of a well carbonated beer with a medium bitterness, accompanied by moderate dryness and a medium mouthfeel that leans towards the lighter side of things.
O: Overall I did enjoy the beer. I was especially satisfied by the fresh hop aroma and fresh flavor. I would have liked a bit more complexity and more body to the beer, but that is always a personal preference. It was great to experience an extremely fresh beer from Stone, shipped this quickly to the East Coast. It gives a greater perspective on what changes take place in their beers during shipment and storage. I would drink it again, given the chance to. It was not my favorite DIPA, but but it was still very good. 1,362 charactersteromous, Jan 19, 2013

T: HOPS. Intensely bitter right up front. Unapologetically hoppy all the way through, with a searing tartness of citrus flesh. Piney and resinous hops start coming through that I missed on the smell - overall 100% hoppy with an excellent balance of citrus and piney hops.
M: Pleasantly carbonated, light, peppy. Hops cling like crazy in the aftertaste.

Pours a light to medium golden amber with a half finger white head that slowly dissipated to a thin film with a thick ring around the glass and light lacing. Aroma dominated by herbal, earthy and almost dank hops, a bit of sweet malt in the background. Taste follows aroma with very complex herbal and piney hops with a hint of citrus hops. Supported by solid sweet malt, orange and citrus rind, finishing with a moderate hop bitterness and residual herbal flavors from the fresh tasting hops. Does not overwhelm with hop bitterness, but delivers intense hop resins and esters. Medium bodied. Definitely delivers on what it promises: as fresh and intense a hop experience as possible without excessive bitterness. A hop lovers dream. I have to say the presentation of this really went over the hype boundary, even for Stone, but it does deliver. I was so intimidated by the instructions to drink quickly that I drank this the evening after it arrived in town. I do not regret that. 1,046 charactersLiquidAmber, Jan 19, 2013

a - brew poured a transparent orange with a finger or so of frothy classic ipa head that hung out and left chunky lacing. there was minimal but present visible carbonation swimming to the surface of the brew.
s - aw yeah, sticky sweaty citrusy hops. just the way i like it. i expected good things in the nose on this one after all it is a fresh stone ipa! i do pick up some of the onion smell that i have heard about as well, though not dominant.
t - soft hop assault. oniony citrusy hops. not as sticky and dank as the nose suggests, but there is some bittering on this one, but not the slap in the face i expected.
m - the first thing i noticed when i sipped the beer was the feel. very water like. there is carbonation for certain, but somewhat subtle making this one more of a hop juice than a beer, but it works.
o - overall, what would you expect? another solid ipa from stone. this time you don't have to worry about it being old though ;) i wish it was more like ruination 10th, that was a very special beer, but this is kinda like a lite version of that. softer and tamer and less dank. solid ipa, glad to have tried it...would definitely pick it up if i saw it on a shelf, but to trade for...might be happy with a one and done. 1,347 characterscosmicevan, Jan 19, 2013

Served in a Delirium Tremens glass.
A: Served a beautiful, glistening, gold color with tons of visible carbonation and about a 1.5 finger head that stuck around for a while.
S: The strong air freshening aroma of pine and fresh hops started to fill the room a mere few seconds after I popped the cap. There was also a nice pomegranate component along with some fresh clean linen. Simply awesome!
T: Refreshingly badass, with a sweet, fruity component and enough hops to satisfy even the most ardent hophead. To be honest though, this one finished fairly sweet and clean, without the usual pine pithiness I often get in an IPA this size.
M: Sure, there was a nice prickle to the carbonation, but this was not a boozy, bitter pill at all.... quite the contrary. The ABV was dangerously hidden.
O: One of the best IPAs I've had in the last couple of years and the best I've had so far in 2013. Also, for only $7.99/bomber, this was a real inexpensive treat! 984 charactersChaney, Jan 19, 2013

Pours a perfectly crystal-clear copper w/ a sudsy bright white head, lazy carbonation. A good-looking beer, appears refreshing and clean.
Aroma is resinous, piney, citrusy. Everything we love about West Coast IPAs. Maybe not quite as dank as I expected, but I prefer my IPAs not to smell too sticky and gooey. Smells clean and fresh, and I don't think it's just Stone's expert marketing playing tricks here.
Taste follows nose. Nicely bitter with lots of grapefruit and pine. Just a hint of alcohol, masked pretty well for a 9.4% brew.
Mouthfeel is clean, medium-bodied, slick. Just right.
Overall another solid DIPA from one of the masters of the craft. Well done, Stone. 766 charactersdraheim, Jan 18, 2013

Poured into a Duvel Tulip
Appearance: Pours an awe inspiring goldish amber with a 2 and a half finger tall thick, white foamy head that lasts forever. It leaves absolute curtains of lacing as it slowly recedes.
Aroma: Wow, what an absolute hop bomb! Big dank hops just positively leap out of the glass towards your nose as soon as you start to pour. Tropical hop notes up front; Pineapple, kiwi, suggestions of mango and papaya, and the typical grapefruit and pine needles. A soft and gentle malty sweetness provides some nice contrast to the nose. 
Taste: As soon as the beer touches your tongue, the hops absolutely explode on to your palate; notes of grapefruit, oily and resinous pine, mangoes, juicy kiwis, cantaloupe, lemon and fresh picked red berries. There is a nice, slightly bread-y maltiness to help balance out this incredible hop monster. Finishes Superbly dry and bitter. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, moderate to high carbonation. Very Drinkable for 9.4%. 
Overall: Wow, the closest beer that I have had to tasting like Pliny the Elder(gotta love the burnt plastic taste from the insane amount of drying hopping), while still maintaining it's own identity. It honestly reminds me of a more over the top Pliny with a stronger emphasis on the more tropical side of hops. The previous batch I had,"Enjoy By 2/15/13" tasted a bit less convoluted hop wise, but Stone really, really impressed me with this one. Still no Pliny killer/contender, but this is damn close. I'm definitely going to try to snag this FRESH as much as I possibly can! 1,582 charactersflayedandskinned, Jan 18, 2013

A : perfect clarity. tiny bit of head. gorgeous orange straw color.
S : Big sweet and piney west coast ipa nose
T : Pine hop character and huge bitterness up front. Orange citrus in the middle with nearly equal sweetness finishing up to really balance the hopiness well.
M : Great mouthfeel for a DIPA. Carbonation is right on if not a tad high but the body is perfect for the style.
O : Excellent DIPA and that is terrific across the board. Definitely not just another hopped up west coast double. 536 characterspearljam118, Jan 18, 2013
4.84/5  rDev +10%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Had on tap at Tj's in Paoli
A: Dark golden hue with a 1 inch head that lightly dissipates as you drink. Very clear almost opaque in color. 
S: The grassy notes of the beer are prevalent at the front of the nose followed by a lot of citrus notes following. Grapefruit and Pineapple are the most noticeable fruity notes that come through in the nose
T: Like the smell, the grassy notes are up front. This beer is very fresh and crisp and gives a very clear and delicious taste. The citrus/ fruity notes come through next with pineapple and grapefruit being the ones that come through most. The hop bitterness lingers on the back end and stays with you long after the sip in a perfect, flavorful way. 
M: The beer is very crisp and carbonated but not heavily so. It doesn't hinder the flavors of the beer and offers a very clean finish. It tingles the tongue and stays with you after the sip.
O: A great IPA. Very fresh and all the different flavors mix together really well and come through very prominently. 1,011 charactersbrowniewithnuts, Jan 18, 2013

After smelling this hop bomb, it's not surprising at all that this is brewed with 11 different hop varieties. Big pine and citrus hops, grass, herbal, grapefruit, and just the faintest hint of a malt backbone holding it all together. Probably one of the best smelling IPA's I've ever had.
And one of the tastiest, too. Big resinous, piney hops tangle with mango, grapefruit rind, lemon zest, grass, and some earthiness with a slightly sweet malt backbone that balances the beer seamlessly. Very slight alcohol warmth, and the 9.4%abv is hidden extremely well. Damn, this stuff is good! 
Mild carbonation prickles the tongue while the hops leave a lingering mild bitterness. Appropriately dry. 
This is my virgin voyage with the Enjoy By series, but hopefully not my last. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. Stone really knocked it out of the park with this one. 1,096 characterscjoc83, Jan 18, 2013

S: pine trees galore. Grapefruit zest, mild bitter orange. Tropical notes of mango, papaya and peaches.
T: very similar to the nose. Dank, ganga-like hops give way to slight alcohol that is hidden well by the hop blast. Tropical and citrus fruits as well as pine and grassy notes.
M: smooth, complex and layered. Mildly oily and resine from hops. Finishes quickly and leaves bitterness on palate for a noticeable period.
O: overall, very drinkable and very fresh DIPA. More intense hop blast compared to Pliny. 9.4 ABV is well hidden behind fruits and oily hop notes. One of the top DIPAs for the style. Could use a slight fine tuning to make it great. Definately worthy. 776 charactersdjjacobsen, Jan 17, 2013

T: Dank citrus rind, tangerine and blood orange, faint grapefruit and tropical fruit. Piney and resiny essence, again. Medium-high bitterness and dryness. Just a slight hint of a malty sweet presence, maybe caramel even. 'West Coast' finish, but not oppressively dry.

Just released today, the freshest possible IPA. The freshness is obvious in the nose. Pine, mango, grassy notes, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, tangerine and just a hint of caramel malty backbone. The taste is the same, almost exactly. Mango, papaya, pine, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, caramel, grassy, orange, cantaloupe and tangerine.

Pours a bright yellow with little head (fizzy yellow bear, anyone?), BIG hoppy aromas. Dank, resinous and light citrus. All of the aromas come through as flavor. Sticky sweetly bitter. Expected bitter aftertaste, but not overly so. This could go up against any of the top DIPA's out there, and defeat many of them. 370 charactersNickMunford, Jan 17, 2013

I've been very excited to try this beer and I'm really glad I got the opportunity to do so on draft. A phenomenal IPA for sure. I would definitely have this again. At the time of this review, this is #29 on the "Top Beers - American Double / Imperial IPA" list on beeradvocate, a well deserved spot.
Beer is amber to yellow / orange and clear with moderate to low carbonation and a white head, some lacing, moderate retention. Looks good.
Aroma is earthy, dank, sulfury, hoppy...that is all.
Beer is medium in body, thins out on the finish leaving just hops, just bitterness, earthy strong, chewy hop presence in the midpalate, a strong beer throughout, an in your face Stone hop experience. I love it. 781 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 16, 2013

Aggressive pour yields a clear golden copper color with a 2 inch cream head that lingers, eventually leaving sheets of lacing as it dissipates.
Lime, onion, and resin form the initial aroma. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, cannabis, and pine add complexity. Tangerines and fresh cut grass round things out. Hints of bready malt are subtle.
Bready, fairly sweet caramel malt forms the flavor backbone. Resin, grapefruit pith, tangerines, lime, and onion finish fairly piney and bitter. There's a minty character that surfaces in the aftertaste.
Body is on the full side, with moderate carbonation and significant alcohol warmth.
Huge hop complexity, with flavorful malt profile that is just a bit too sweet. 788 charactersbarczar, Jan 16, 2013

 The taste overall was just as good as it always is with Stone, lots of flavor and hops. I would say try it out but since you can't take this review as a good reason to pick up Stone's next special release. 450 charactersMisajet90, Jan 15, 2013

m - Medium body and moderate carbonation, with a huge bitter bite to it.

Its been a few years since Ive had Pliney the Younger, but that was the last beer I can remember that had such an aggressive nose-full of wonderful hop aroma. From a foot away you can smell fresh pine tree in a glass. 
The taste is equally epic. We had this alongside Pliney the Younger (wonderful things happen at GABF). I know its an unfair comparison, but wow was EB over-the top in hops and piney mouth feel by comparison. Just a huge beer for hopheads.

A = Golden amber, pretty clear, with medium-light carbonation and a thin head of light foam.
S = Even one day late, full of vibrant, fresh hops. Citrus, grapefruit, west coast hops.
T = Lots of hop flavor, though maybe not quite as much as the aroma would imply. Citrus, tropical fruit, a bit resinous. A decent amount of sweetness and malt to balance. Not particularly caramely.

4.47/5  rDev +1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This brew was served from the bottle (Enjoy By 12.21.12, Third Batch) at the Tap and Mallet Vertical Epic tasting event. It arrived in a tasting glass, showing a clean yellow golden. No head was noted, but spots of lacing were left dripping down the glass. Carbonation appeared average, and no haze or sediment was noted. The aroma was gritty as hell. The nose was filled with earthy hop bite, metallic and soured yeast, and sweet nectary hops of grapefruit and soap. With warmth came plastics and light booziness, mineral, and an enhancement of those paler, toastier malts. Peach sugars blended in as well, giving nice and syrupy depth to the vast array of hop varietals. Our first impression was that there was a huge hop variety through all the bitterness, but things were exquisitely juicy. The flavoring opened with dirt and grit of pine resin, mineral, booze, pale malts, and faint caramel sugariness. The middle came to a peak with softer pine, massive juiciness of citric flesh, more pale toast, and biting yeasty metallics. Citric hops washed through the finish, with juiciness of peaches, nectarines, apples, and flesh of grapefruit, mixing for an ultimate blend without any lingering or puckering extreme bitterness of hop. The aftertaste breathed of soap, pine, and grapefruit cleanliness, with spicy black pepper booze on the far back. The body was medium to full, and the carbonation was high. There was nice slurp, cream, smack, froth, and pop, with a slick coating. Pucker eventually came from the astringent, grapey dryness to the palate, in the absence of intense bittering from the gloriously juicy hops. The abv was fine, and the beer drank way easy.
Overall, the best thing about this brew was how everything was all about the hops. There was such a nice bite and grit to the opening act, with a beautifully balanced cleanliness of soap, pine, and massive citrus. Despite the variety, the depth of bitterness never really catches up with you, as the flavoring stays sweet, nectary, and insanely juicy throughout. This is one of the best Stone beers we’ve ever had. 2,088 charactersTheBrewo, Dec 23, 2012

Apperence: Beautuful golden amber just a slight haze that transforms to clear once the beer warms just a bit. About a fingure of marshmallow like fully and bubbly head. Terrific lacing down the glass as you drink it.
Smell: Amazing earthy hops, grass, pine, flowers, a little bit of citrus. The fresh hops are just a heavenly.
Taste: Hops,hops,hops!! Very well balanced between the bitter bite and mellow malts. 
There is pine and resin and then citrus fruits, mainly grape fruit just a little orange. Just a hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel: My only knock on this brew is it seems a little over carbonated and there is an oily, alcoholy finish.
Overall: The best IPA I've had this year, wish it was easier to get ahold of or it would be a regular in my fridge. 834 charactersafluentturtle, Dec 22, 2012

Honestly, if you closed your eyes and put your nose above the glass, you'd swear that you just crushed a double handful of Cascade; hop heaven!
Unless your conducting an empirical study on longevity, there is no reason whatsoever to delay gratification and enjoy this right now.
Is this brew all about freshness? - You bet it is! 735 charactersbarknee, Dec 22, 2012

S - prominent American-like hop aroma characterized by pine and tropical fruit, sweet malt hiding, any esters from the yeast are well hidden in the hop scent, no phenol detected
T - much like aroma, strong and bright American hop presence which hints of mango, pine and orange, but the hops are not so overpowering that the malt adequately supports the moderately aggressive bitterness which is notable on the finish
M - medium body, moderate carbonation, slight alcohol warmth
O - This is a wonderfully done, fresh tasting IPA. The hop blend used here is a bit different than other of Stone's offerings, which provides it distinction from their other offerings. It's a shame that this isn't offered regularly as it might make it into my fridge on a regular basis. 908 charactersscoobybrew, Dec 22, 2012

A - Perfectly clear amber pour with a hint of red. Slight head, yet surprising retention. Despite the thinner mouthfeel, this leave some decent wine-like legs and solid lacing.
S - Dank, wet, earthy, grassy hops. Lots of skunky dirty hop aroma, very little malt or sweetness on the nose. This just smells fresh and hoppy.
T - It pretty much follows the nose, but with a bit of candy-like malt to balance it out. This is definitely an aggressively hopped beer, but it's not as bitter and in-your-face as you'd expect. It has that dank, grassy, earthy hop profile from the nose, with a hint of what can be described as burnt rubber (in a good way).
M - Slightly overcarbonated for my tastes. It does a good job of coating the tongue and making its presence felt, it just is a little bit too champagne-like in its carbonation.
O - I wish this was a year-round release. It's a solid, earthy DIPA.. I was lucky enough to grab 4 bottles while I was up in the Bay Area, this is the 4th and bottle (to be had right before the end of the world). It doesn't taste quite as "fresh" as the first bottle I cracked, but it's still a fantastic beer. Yes, it's a little gimmicky, but I appreciate what Stone is trying to do with this beer. It's delicious. 1,274 charactersESPNman, Dec 21, 2012

4.48/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is the 12/21/12 batch enjoyed on 12/17/12. Served in a standard pint glass.
Appearance: The beer pours a mostly clear amber color with a finger of very fluffy off white head that fades to a nice layer on top of the pour and leaves some great lacing on the glass.
Smell: I'm getting a sweet hoppy note right off the bat, lots of citrus peel, but also pineapple and other sweet citrus fruit. There is a sweet malt note along with some pine needles as well.
Taste: Quite similar to the smell, but not as sweet. More grain sweetness than juicy citrus fruit. The hops are aggressive and remind me of citrus peel with some pine needles. There is enough malt to balance out the hops, and just a touch of alcohol. The finish is quite bitter.
Mouthfeel: The body is medium with fluffy, tingly carbonation and a dry finish. 
Overall: This is another winner by Stone. I'm really glad I got to try this and I'll pick up some more if they do a release in my neck of the woods. 973 charactersoline73, Dec 18, 2012
4.56/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75On 12/16, with 5 days to spare I was finally able to give this a shot. Most anticipated beer of 2012. Enjoyed during Pats-Niners. What a game.
While I was pouring into a Sierra Nevada balloon glass, the first thing I noticed was the powerful aroma. Extremely piney and Christmas tree-like. How appropriate. It's transparent gold in color, with a half inch of head that quickly reduces to a thin, somewhat bubbly foam.
Like the aroma, the pine flavor slams the taste buds and doesn't let up. There's also some grapefruit notes but it's very subtle. There's an excellent hop bite as well - like most well made, fresh DIPAs, I feel like I could chew on the hops - Founder's Harvest is another example of this phenomenon. Despite this, the hop presence is well balanced and lingers after every sip. Also of note is a higher than normal sweetness to the flavor - I didn't mind but it could be a turnoff to some.
What's not to like? All the elements of a great DIPA are here, and it's done to perfection. All this plus at 9.4% ABV, which is scarily well hidden.
I will always be on the lookout for this one. The Pat's may have lost, but I still consider myself a winner. 1,168 charactersCeltics76, Dec 17, 2012

A: Moderate pour yields 1/2 finger white head with fair to good retention. Crystal clear brass/copper liquid. Pretty and practically perfect.
S: Wow. Dank. Orange, tangerine, grapefruit. Allium definitely, pine too. Ever so faint esters. So lushly hoppy! Amazing. Not man-candy, but so good.
T: Bitterness right up front is strong but quickly countered by a robust yet lightly bready malt base with a kiss of sweetness. Savory hop and piney too. Great balance between malt and hop-heavy tending towards the hops.
M: One downside is slight cloying. Bracing hoppiness finishes on the savory side. Breathy alcohol is also a negative.
O: One of the best beers of 2012. A terrific IPA. Glad to get this from Des Moines. I'll definitely drink it when it gets to MI! A testament to the value of freshness in IPAs. 854 charactersdfillius, Dec 17, 2012

I had Batch 1 on tap and wasn't a huge fan--gave it a 3.75. I heard they tweaked the recipe a bit for this batch so I dove back in.
The body is a bright orange, fairly clear, with an ecru cap. The cap rises and falls slowly, leaving some clingy lace behind. A thin layer of powdered sugar like foam.
Musty tropical fruit. Papaya, mango, ruby red grapefruit, pineapple, and melon with a bit of an earthy must underneath. The malt bill is super clean---lightly toasted biscuits---and sits way underneath these hops.
Juicy tropical fruit rolls onto the palate. Pineapple and ruby red grapefruit with papaya and mango before a brief rush of bready malt. The finish is a wave of ruby red bitterness and some pine resin.
Medium body with spot on carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking. Long lingering bitterness.
I enjoyed this batch much more than the first. The initial batch seemed overly astringent and just had way too many varieties of hops lending a confusing assault on the palate. This batch is more more refined, and is akin to Ruination. A smooth DIPA with a big hop punch. 1,124 charactersColForbinBC, Dec 16, 2012

A - Body is amber honey colored. Crystal clear. a 1/2 inch of head forms but dissipates quickly.
S - Floral, bitter citrus, minimal pine/resin, as well as some pleasant tropical fruit aromas.
T - Incredibly balanced DIPA. The hops take center stage all the way through, but this isn't a nearly unpalatable bitterness-bomb like some i've had. Sweet, juicy citrus from the hops mix with the subtle caramel flavors of the malt up front. More grapefruity bitterness and some more earthy hop notes dominate the middle, but the finish has a nice snap of lemongrass and orange peel. Overall, though the flavors never seem out of balance. Smooth and lovely all the way through.
M - Medium bodied with incredible drinkability for a 9.4% beer. Very smooth and the finish is quite dry and clean.

A: Clear gold. A quarter inch of head dissipates quickly but leaves a ring around the glass the entire time. The lacing left on the glass is stunning! It hangs down almost exactly like the legs in a great glass of wine. 
S: HOPS! Plentiful hops, bountiful hops. The floral tones remind me of DFH 120 Minute. I know its only the psychological effect, but it smells fresh, yet still with an unbelievable blend of spicy and sweet. The piney hops overpower the nose but leave room for a trace or two of orange, but only just. Spectacular aroma!
T: When cold, the initial taste is hidden, only to explode into the same hop zest that dominates the smell. As its warms, the taste is simply awesome from the initial touch to the tongue to well after the last drop disappears. With the swallow, the orange sneaks in again but quickly is overpowered by the hops. The hoppy pine taste just clings to the tongue as if it wants you just as bad as you want that next sip. The alcohol is very well hidden. 
M: I always find myself able to use just one word for each mouthfeel. Here it is "light." Don't get me wrong though, it is a weightless light, the kind that washes away the hops, only to leave an additional heap right where the last sip left. It builds on itself as it cycles through the washing. If you let it sit to confirm its lightness, the acidic hops dig into the tongue to remind you the best is yet to come.
O: I was blown away by this beer. Arrogant Bastard finished my conversion to craft beer, Ruination led me down the path to hophead-hood, 10 Anniversary Ruination showed to me a hidden paradise, which was Enjoy By. If you at all have to opportunity to try this beer, do not hesitate. My last sip was a good 15 minutes ago and I can still taste those hops. I can leave you only with one word: Enjoy! 1,888 characterskingmaker, Dec 15, 2012

A: Poured a half finger off white head that settled to sparse islands of moderately sized bubbles. Color is a hazy orangey peach. Copious amounts lacing decorate the glass.
S: Explosive. Tangerine, apricot, lemon zest, molasses, fresh Christmas pine. 
T: Prepare to be gunned down from an arsenal of hop varieties. The flavor is fruity, spicy, grassy, and oozes with fresh hops. Black pepper, mango, cloves, fresh cut grass, pineapple and sweet toasty sweet malt leave you wanting more.
M: Coats your insides with hop resin like ornaments on the tree. Carbonation is very delicate and the ABV is nowhere to be found. Finishes wet and slick.
O: I am willing to become a fallen soldier, a casualty to the freshness this beer offers. This is really what matters when it comes to a great tasting IPA. 819 characterscooler4life, Dec 15, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is a review of the 12/21/12 batch, consumed righteously on the 12/12/12. This is written from my notes. Poured into a pint glass from a 22oz bomber.
The color starts as a slightly clear orange, but quickly melds into a golden amber tone with a decent amount of carbonation and head altogether. A ring remains at the top during the entire time. Lovable amounts of lacing stick to the glass, and the hop resin makes the beer appear shiny and colorful overall.
The smell is an unbelievably fresh aroma of hop bliss, with extremely floral notes, yet a zest resembling an earthy, well maintained orange grove. The hops aromas appear to stick to the nostrils and never let go, with the high alcohol taking a back seat here, but which nevertheless causes an intense sensation of both sweetness and spiciness. There's something extremely earthy about this smell that I can't quite put my finger on. Could it be the toffee like malts melding with the hop oil, or simply the fresh hops themselves? Either way, it's excellent.
There's a similar, fantastic experience that goes with the flavor as well. Definitely this beer has achieved the freshness that it claims to aim for. This is a plethora of hop freshness in ways that must be tasted to be believed. There's a strong hop zest, but fresh in the sense where it not only is explosive in flavor, but seems to almost melt on the tongue after every gulp. The hop oils are very lively here, and the malts are balanced in very well with them. Other than that, the alcohol finish may be a bit too much here, and it gets slightly thinned as it warms up too much, but the flavor is definitely beyond perfection here.
Remarkable stuff from Stone - I haven't had too many other hoppy beers this fresh before. The price tag is a bit high, but it's definitely an unforgettable experience of sorts for hop and citrus fanatics in beer. Highly recommended! 1,893 charactersmagictacosinus, Dec 14, 2012

A: Pours a nearly clear golden orange with a small white head that fades pretty quickly and leaves some lacing on the glass.
S: The nose is an immediate blast of tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, and apricots. Dank like a bag of cheeba and hop forward for sure. There's a bit of malt in there as well but it is one of the most fruit forward DIPAs I've ever smelled and I love it!
T: The taste is not so fruit forward and actually is balanced by a good hop bitterness. There are flavors of mango and apricot but there are also big flavors of pine and grapefruit. It's actually dank in the taste which I don't think I've ever experienced before...very interesting. The taste is good but it's not as impressive as the nose.
M: The feel is medium bodied with a nice amount of carbonation.
O: I like this and I hope they keep this series going. I would buy this all the time if it was available year round. 959 charactersGregSVT, Dec 14, 2012

12.21.12 bottle
Consumed 12/12/12
Appearance: Clear, light orange gold - pretty - slightly off-white, lively head - moderate size, fades to a wispy cap, leaves a few nice streaks of lacing 
Smell: Loads of citrus, with a ton of wet, dank pine - oily citrus, orange flesh, grapefruit rinds, and resiny pine - some tropical touches, like pineapple - hoppy, but not remarkably aggressive (especially given the brewery) - some pale malts in the background
Taste: Citrus and pine, who would have thought? - orange flesh, tangerine juice, grapefruit rind, with some sticky pine - some slight herbal elements (lightly leafy), light tropical elements (pineapple), and mint - wet and juicy - hoppy, but only a medium level of bitterness - pale, lightly grainy malts - very light touch of alcohol - could actually be a bit maltier (although it almost pains me to type that)
Mouthfeel: Medium body, smooth, oily, nicely carbonated
Overall: Enjoy.
The commitment to freshness inherent in this beer is quite charming. Oddly enough, perhaps the flaw here is that it's brewed by Stone... And I honestly prefer Stone's easy to get, year-round Ruination to this. On another note, I'm not sure if I believe the 9.4% ABV. This is absurdly easy to drink. 1,313 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 12, 2012

ours with a good white head that leaves thick lacing down the glass; good retention. Orange body with a brown hue, similar to DCT. 
Huge fruity aroma from the hops. Tropical fruits, mango, lots of sweetness from the malt here as well. Really a fan of the aroma on this one.
The flavor has some of that tropical fruitiness, with some pine to it as well. Very sweet - too much for my preference. Bitterness comes through at the lingers and lasts a while.
Heavier body from the malts, good level of carbonation, very minor alcohol presence.
Overall this is a good DIPA, too heavy on the sweet side for my preference. 641 characterszachary80, Dec 12, 2012

Bright, clear copper with a mediocre head that reduces to a frothy ring around the glass. 
Big mango and pineapple on first whiff. Pine and grapefruit as well. It even smells like its going to be sweet. Herbal grassiness beyond the fruit aromas. A whirl of it brings just enough caramel to remind me there are malts in it too.
As soon as it hit my tongue I thought it was going to be really sweet from all of the tropical fruit flavors, then it finishes smooth with a hint of bitterness and a warmth of alcohol. I know its intentional, but I actually wish for a bit more bitterness.
Smooth as can be and drinks like a pale ale. Excellent carbonation.
This beer is a sensory experience for sure. A must try, although if you dont have it already, you probably wont be trying it. I was lucky to get a share of this. Hope you get to try it too. 921 charactersphiberoptik, Dec 12, 2012

Batch: #3 (Enjoy By 12.21.12)
Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz bomber.
Pours a gorgeous translucent melted copper color with some awesome gold hues. Soooo bright and clear, pretty impressive. A delicious and perfect 1 inch white head forms. The head is soo dense and soapy as well. Amazing looking brew. If only it was slightly hazy to me it would’ve been perfect. (4.5)
Aroma is juicy. Citrus notes of grapefruit and some awesome orange rind blast the nose. Tropical notes a plenty with some nice tangerine and mango as well. Grain is definitely present. Some nice pale malt with some biscuit notes and some nice slight caramel notes can be perceived. (5.0)
Taste starts off with a perfect blast of citrus notes. Grapefruit, orange and tangerine starts things off, citrus west coast notes. Awesome bitterness follows with some grassy and herbal hop notes as well. There is soo much balance. Nice biscuit malt with some nice slight caramel hints in the back end that are balanced so well the juicy hop notes. I just had Alpine Nelson a couple hours before at a tasting and this brought back memories. So fresh and juicy. There is some mild piney resins in there as well and it finishes with some nice dankness complete with a dry nice bitter finish. As it warms more tropical notes come out and fill the palette with juicy and resinous goodness. (4.5)(5.0)
Overall this is a delicious brew. Great balanced brew! The hops are intense and resinous; citrusy and bitter. Grassy and fresh but there is some nice malt backbones that allow the beer to not overwhelm. Maybe my palate is used to big IPAs but this is so smooth and drinkable the 9.5 ABV is not even a player.

Pours a golden amber color with excellent clarity and a small white head. Decent lacing - something I've now always come to expect from Stone brews. Heavy pineapple on the nose, grapefruits, tangerines, slight lemon zest; floral hops, perfume fragrance, wet grass. Very nice - it has a "juicy" smell, the smell you'd expect from biting into a fruit. If that fruit was loaded with hop oil.
Taste is, of course, hoppy; slightly peppery, a little leafy, ashy, kind of dry. Heavy dose of malt and yeast; biscuity with some warming alcohol spice on the roof of the mouth and the back of the tongue. Over the course of the sip, the hop profile grows and expands, it starts taking on a very dank, resinous, and musty flavor and aroma. Interesting and very complex. Weedy overall, with some onion notes in the back that are kind of strange, but not necessarily off-putting, just a little strange. The malt sweetens things up a bit, and the yeast helps out too - bread, crackers on the end of the sip. As mentioned, the flavor follows right along with biting into a tropical fruit soaked in hop oil. Aftertaste is a bitter and spicy hop flavor. Thick body, sticky, wet, medium carbonation.
It's rare that I'm disappointed by Stone beers, and this one is no exception. Excellent IPA with a very complex profile - very tasty all around. In my opinion, probably the best Stone IPA I've tried. Too bad this one doesn't come to Michigan, because I'd always try to find the latest release. 1,562 characterstectactoe, Dec 10, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I enjoyed the 12 21 12 version here in chicago...
Appearance: Pours a crisp deep golden color, pretty transparent…some bubble action happening in the middle…off white head forms and lasts…does look a little watery…
Smell: Citra hops galore…orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple explosion…some sweetness and a touch of paleness…this is all hops… smells like the fresh orange juice I just did in my breville like an hour ago…this thing is fresh…it’s a mouth watering aroma…
Taste: Massive citrus hops…orange, grapefruit, pineapple, pine, earthiness…some bitterness, but it’s nice…some dryness, like a persimmon…there is some floral hop bitterness in the after taste…sweet, pale malt is present, but definitely overwhelmed by all the hops…does add a nice backbone though with good flavor…
Mouthfeel: Light to medium body…medium carbonation, nice fluff does form, leaving citrus bitterness all over my tongue…long lasting citrus hop flavor and bitterness in the after taste…smooth and refreshing, leaves my mouth watering for more, and I’ll ablidge…
Overall: Awesome! One of the best brews I’ve had in a long, long time…the taste is very fresh, crisp, light, full and awesome…enough hops to satisfy any hop head out there…citrus and pine hops galore, the malt does add some balance, but this is for the lovers… there is so much fresh zest to this, it lives up to the “drink by” concept…definitely head of the class in this ever expanding “west coast/american” pale ale and IPA genre…if you see this, buy it…then drink it… 1,597 charactersSerialHiker, Dec 08, 2012

Pours clear gold with a moderate foamy white head. Decent retention and lacing down the glass is solid.
Super dank aroma. Tons of pine and grapefruit with a little orange rind and some tropical fruits peeking in from time to time. Almost smell a little rye like spiciness although I don't think i tcontains any. Malt side smells like fresh baked bread and a little honey.
This one is potent in the hop department as most Stone beer are. Grapefruit citrus and tropical fruits up front. Malt profile is a bit doughy with some honey or molasses sweetness although still very much on the bitter side. Finishes with a huge dose of pine. I would've preferred a little more complexity in the finish as the profile lowered drinkability a bit, but still pretty tasty.
Mouthfeel is solid. On the light side of medium with appropriate carbonation. A little above the sweet spot ABV wise for a DIPA so alcohol is slightly present.
Very solid beer. Not sure it's all that much different than Ruination, but glad to see the freshness date stamped on the label and from a marketing angle, I love this beer. Taste is good if not excellent, but at only $5.49 a bomber, very good value. 1,182 charactersjmarsh123, Dec 06, 2012

Still have about three weeks left: “Enjoy By 12.21.12” is emblazoned right on the front of the bottle. I love the crusade for fresh beer, and this idea, especially – no way this beer will ever be picked up past its prime.
A: Superb: brilliantly translucent gold body with a foamy white head three fingers high. Retention is smooth and frothy; ropes of lacing all around.
S: Dank as hell: taut pine and spicy pepper with some notes of crisp citrus rind and juicy pineapple emanate as soon as I open the bottle. Strong and uplifting, this is one of the best hop aromas I can imagine. The malt character seems solid, as well, balancing the hops with sweet scents of pie crust, cherry, nougat, and honey.
T: A sharp, darkly bitter flavor is propelled across the palate to start, stinging with spicy rye and pepper, pine needles, and chili powder – a deep, lasting hoppiness that reminds you not of citrus, but of something richer. As it dries the palate, a soothing malt profile of soft white bread, cracker, and caramel mixes in to give the beer a chewy, rounded palate. And there’s a floral note to it all, too, herbal and almost soapy with tastes of lavender, tangerine, rose water, and sage; lofty notes of complexity. The aftertaste is, surprisingly, only a moderately dry, lemony hoppiness, still showing sweet, smooth malts.
M: Solid malt + just the right amount of drying hops = a rich, full-bodied DIPA. Hop bitterness dries in a light way for such a hoppy beer.
O: This beer represents a lot in the fresh beer campaign, and even with that going for it, it still rocks. It reminded me of Ruination at nearly every sip, but hey – who said greatness had to be totally original? This is great beer. 1,858 charactersBarryMFBurton, Dec 05, 2012

Faded golden hue with a big sticky white head. Pungent west coast ipa nose, grapefruit, prominent sweet citrus fruit, and pine. Got a faint underlying tobacco smell as well with very faint sweet malts.
Tastes like an amped up stone ipa with a slicker body, more alcohol, more tannins, and less acidity. This beer is good but nowhere near out of the ordinary with the so called "freshness" not playing a role to me, i've had plenty of brews that taste as fresh as this one well beyond the maturity of this brew. I think the high ratings of this beer really come from the marketing that stone did. On the distribution and retail end of things, stone doesn't do much in the way of out coded beer for the consumer so I guess this is their way of moving through beer quicker without complaints. If this enjoy by series ever gets stale i'm sure stone will never really come personally pull them off the shelves and eat the costs. 1,092 charactersjtierney89, Dec 05, 2012

Pours a clear golden color with a thinner white head. Fades out fairly quickly into some bubbled film and spotty lacing on the glass. 
Vibrant and pungent hoppy presence in the nose, driven by bitter grapefruit and resinous pine. Faint sweetness from caramel and fruit with a faint notion of a malt backbone. Light alcoholic punch. 
Crushing bitter hoppiness right up front with an absolute avalanche of grapefruit and sticky pine. The hops dominate the profile from nearly top to bottom, only momentarily allowing for a brief notion of toasted grain/caramel malted backbone. Finishes bitter and dry with grapefruit followed by a boozy warmth. 
Medium body, well carbonated, dry and sticky on the tongue. Stone makes some really tasty West coast style IPAs, but this one is easily the most expressive and flavorful without going completely off the rails. I'd drink this regularly if possible. 964 charactersxnicknj, Dec 04, 2012

Not being a fan of having my face devoured by lasers and then eaten by worms, I took the smart route and decided to crack this fucker open right away.
Smells like a fresh, strong IPA with big nodes of flowers and pines. Tastes equally fresh and hoppily strong, but the flavor is tame and a near total lack of burn belays its elevated ABV. Lots of double IPAs attempt to back up intense hops with thick, syrupy malt. Other, better doubles balance out the hops with sweeter malts and interesting yeast complexities. Here, the hops don't get too out of hand, but they're still lush and variegated enough to balance themselves, making it so all the malt needs to do is provide a decent bready backend. and that's what this one does, gorgeously. 838 charactersmynie, Dec 04, 2012

Poured into a snifter.
Appearance
Nice gold with 1-2 fingers of fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Excellent clarity and very low carbonation.
Nose
This smells ridiculously good! Pineapple juice, papaya, mango, tangerine, lemon juice and candy sugar.
Taste
Luckily all that tropical fruit is still accounted for. Pineapple juice, papaya and mango along with lemon juice and navel orange. A touch of booze quickly follows. Candy sugars and a thin layer of drizzle caramel. A light breadiness. It gets a little more resinous towards the finish with pine sap and florals as well as some grapefruit zest and tangerine.
Mouthfeel
Medium-full bodied, juicy, warming, crisp, dry and surprisingly clean.
Overall
This is easily one of the best Stone beers that I've had. Definitely better than the Ruination 10th Anniversary. Leaps and bounds beyond Lukcy 13asardt. Very tropical and balanced. This does not shred your taste buds like all that other garbage that they put out. Some booze is apparent but it's worth it. Seek this one out. 1,079 charactersjustintcoons, Dec 03, 2012

A: Lovely golden color with a thin lacing after a semi-aggressive pour.
 N: Sweetened hop juice. Aromatic pineapple and mango. Some spruce tips. Very tropical. Clementines and mandarin orange. Doesn’t have the nose shriveling bitterness, which I quite like. 
T: Bitter spruce extravaganza. Tons of pine and earth floor from the hops. A little sweetness and some mandarin orange. Some biscuit and malt. There’s more pineapple and grapefruit as this warms. 
M: Full mouthfeel with a lot of hop resin. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. 
O: I will be drinking this entire bottle and enjoying it all the way through. A complete beer. Has that very distinct Stone IPA quality about it (you'll know it when you taste it), but it's got some extra components. Get some. 823 charactersSarlacc83, Dec 03, 2012

Hill Farmstead wine glass
A: Pours a beautifully clear light orange color. Lots of carbonation. Forms a faint thin head of bright white that fades quickly.
S: Tons of bright fruity hop aromas that I smelled as soon as I popped the top. Mango. Papaya. Some grapefruit. Also some piney notes.
T: Hop bitterness on the tip of the tongue. Getting those delicious fruity hops that were on nose. Bitter grapefruit. Mango. Orange pith. It's a big hop bomb, but in the back of the palate there is some balancing malts. Dry crisp hoppy finish. Lingering hop flavors dance in your mouth. Not boozy but as first beer I sort of feel it. Tastes lighter than 9%.
M: Medium bodied. Nice bitter mouth coat. 755 charactersinlimbo77, Dec 03, 2012

The head is white and a bit soapy/frothy. Good lace sticks to the glass. Beer is a bright gold with a touch of brass in it.
Aroma is borderline perfection. So bright and fresh it hurts. Huge juicy citrus notes with a touch of green grass. A tropical note or two as well.
Tropical blast more apparent in the flavor vs. aroma. Again a blast of fresh citrus. Lots of tangerine and oily citrus from the peel. Just fantastic. Reminds me a touch of the pineapple Lifesavers.. (positive reference) Light cracker malt just to provide some balance, but this is about the fresh hops.
Light, refreshing and fresh body. Vibrant.

Pours a clear peach/yellow ale with a white foamy head and nice lacing.
Getting a lot of cirtus fruits with a dankness in the background. Pine, orange juice and a touch of malt. 
First taste reminds me a tad like Pliny. The fresh hops are present though there is a touch of orange in the finish. Grapefruit salivation. A little on the sweet side if you like your DIPA this way. As it warms, the malt backbone is present in the finish. Works well.
Pretty quick finish.
Overall I liked it. Maybe I'm spoiled by my proximity to Pliny, but this was just a likable (not loveable) beer to me. Nice take in the DIPA family, but probably the last time I'll purchase it. Plus I'll be dead in a couple weeks anyway. Onto my cellared Double Bastard. 965 characterskaseydad, Dec 01, 2012

Date: Bottled 11/16/12, drink by 12/21/12
Glass: Tulip
Stone's "Best By..." is a fairly standard west-coast DIPA with hints of pine resin and more pronounced maltiness than I find in typical expressions of the style. A decidedly solid and well-produced beer, as I would expect from Stone, but not something that seems to set itself apart from others in the style or even Stone's other offering. Glad I could try this, would get it again if I was in the area, but not something that's offering much new or breaking ground.
Pours a 1.5cm tall head of slightly off-white foam, composed of fine, small bubbles. Retention is average, and over its decline, the head leaves substantial lacing along the sides of the glass in assorted thick lines and shapes. Each sip also reveals excellent sheeting and cascading from the descending foam. Head eventually falls to a thick ring around the glass and a wispy island of foam atop the center of the body. Body is a light caramel brown color, transparent, with light bringing out very nice, bright, orange and yellow hues. Carbonation streams from the bottom of the class, visibly and aggressively.
Aroma of peach, mango, and grapefruit rind; typical for a west-coast IPA. In general, a very nice, assertive and clean hop aroma. Not dank or excessively heavy with hop scent: refined, if you will.
Surprising pine resin flavor upfront, considering that I didn't detect this in the aroma, along with the expected hop bitterness. Mid-palate of grapefruit, and milder pine resin, with plenty of generic hop bitterness atop an actually sweet, slighty bready, and noticeable malt body. Back of palate picks up continued hop bitterness with some bright mango and grapefruit flavor with a splash of spicy ethanol as well. Lingering flavor of grapefruit rind, generic hop bitterness, cracker-like malt and mild ethanol.
Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation that is medium to high. This results in a mouthfeel that is prickly at first, eventually fading to a pleasantly tingling feeling across the palate that melds well with the attendant bitterness and ethanol burn. Aftertaste is expectedly dry, from the substantial hopping and ethanol presence. There is also some substantial stickiness around the corners of the lips. 2,288 charactersfalloutsnow, Dec 01, 2012

This is a clear copper brew, shiny beneath a dense white head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is not what I expected, but it may be because this was served colder than normal. To say the hop aroma is strong would be an understatement. The biggest aroma is pine, but there's some grapefruit, floral, and lemon notes in there too. If there's a malt aroma, it's buried deep beneath all the hops, as it should be in my opinion. After a swirl, I get a solid biscuit aroma. The taste starts off coppery with white bread crust. The hop flavor is dominant as well: very vinous, earthy, and somewhat grassy. Bitterness comes smoothly, but it's unmistakably oppressive. There is some spiciness in the bitterness too, perhaps from Amarillo. Beer finishes coppery, earthy, and vinous. The taste delivers what the aroma promises. After all that, I thought: "what about the malt?" As in every good Triple IPA, this malt is just a stage for the hops. It's reminiscent of white bread and unseasoned oatmeal. The feel is balanced and finish dry. Although it's not malty, this is surprisingly balanced. This is a damn fine brew. Dare I say in line with Pliny! 1,319 charactersPhilousa, Nov 30, 2012

Smell: load of caramel, citrus, pine, and some floral hop bitterness was very easy to detect and extremely pleasant on the nose.
Taste: big caramel profile with a load of pineapple and lemon citrus, a strong but balanced bitterness, and a late floral component that really rounded this out nicely. Alcohol is mildly noticeable. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied. Lightly crisp from start to finish. Some dryness arrived late. Long lasting aftertaste here. 
Overall: a really well balanced DIPA that pushed the limits before breaking it. Easy to quaff despite the high alcohol content. Super fresh on draft and improved as it warmed. Great beer I hope they brew again. 749 charactersGavage, Nov 30, 2012

Pours a frothy, 2 finger white head with excellent retention. Beer is a clear orange-goldenrod. Lacing is thick, layered and stringy with great cling. Phenomenal in every aspect.
Nose is intense citrus, pine with a sappy hop presence and some cane sugar to finish things off. Nice and clean.
Opens citrus, pine, cane sugar and a light hoppiness. A slight astringency at the start that mellows into some sap hop bitterness. Middle is more citrus and grapefruit with a bitter finish and a hoppy, fruity aftertaste. Really balanced. 
Light bodied with ample carbonation. Lively but smooth in the mouth and warm and aggressive going down. Finish is slightly messy with a lingering aftertaste. Hides the ABV exceptionally well. 
This is just a very well crafted, all-around solid IIPA. Great look, clean nose, balanced flavor profile and an excellent feel. I'm glad I got the chance to try this one. 989 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 30, 2012

Enjoy by IPA looks pretty clean inside the bottle, no sediment. Once outside the liquid is an olympic gold medal color with much clarity. Surprisingly with a stealth pour I only mustered about a quarter inch of frothy foam up top that dissipated and left no cling, a rather lifeless looking beer. Enjoy by has a healthy musk to it. I get swarmed with citrus scents and some bitter pine backing. A nice malty backbone as well, the alcohol does not seep through. Smells more on the tropic fruit side with some bubblegum coming up with room temp. Taste is what you would expect with a IIPA, rich tropic fruit flavor, mango, orange, grapefruit, a smidgin of pine, a nice crystal malt presence. This tastes more like juice as it comes up to room temp. Not as bitter as most stone IPA'S go. Body is a healthy medium with a pleasant bitterness, but more of a juicy finish, No heat from the 9 plus percent. Carbonation is surprisingly low from the get go, so perhaps I had an off bottle. This was drinkable, but something that i have had a hundred times over in different forms. 1,113 charactersBARFLYB, Nov 30, 2012

Pours sparkling clear coppery gold with a half inch head of white. A partial skim coat with torn sheets of lacing for the duration of the glass.
Aromatics lead off with mild hints of pear, peach, pine, cracked garlic, and grapefruit. Dank and fruity but not very pungent. Surprisingly subdued for such a freshie.
Medium bodied with a crisp, tacky mouthfeel. 
Bright citrus, pine, and light malt start the palate. Very low, smooth bitterness and dry with plenty of dank resin and pine-spiked fruit. 
Finishes with lingering garlic, pine, and grapefruit. Slighty warming with hop aromas visiting again after each belch. 
Tasty IPA and I'd be very happy to be able to drink this on a regular basis. The nose is a bit lacking though given the freshness and pedigree of the beer and compared with other freshies that I've had out of So Cal. 
Pretty awesome though that I'm able to enjoy this beer just inside of two weeks old when I've never even been able to try a local bottled beer that fresh! 1,044 charactersbrewandbbq, Nov 30, 2012

A: Pours a perfectly clear amber color with a one finger of height pure white head forming on the pour. It dissipates to a frothy collar that leaves some sticky lace behind.
S: Some grapefruit, orange and lemon peel citrus. Sweet malts and just a touch of green onion in the periphery.
T: More green onion up front, but it doesn't hinder the overall flavor profile. Sweet malts, some citrus zest and sticky grapefruit. As the beer warms it definitely takes on more of a sauteed vidalia onion taste to it.
M: Clean and crisp with a light medium to light body. Medium carbonation level.
O: It was better when it was colder, but as it warmed the onion-like qualities became more pronounced. The alcohol was really hidden though and I would have guessed it was 7% or so. 851 charactersTreebs, Nov 30, 2012

A- Pours cristal clear golden orange/yellow. A one finger of a white head. Slight alcohol legs.
S- Holy hops! A massive citrus. Pineapple and lime and pinecone like you cant believe. All extenuated by a slightly sweet malt backbone. 
T- A sharp bitterness up front that fades quickly to a semisweet malt backbone. Hop flavors take over and dominate the beer. A ton of citrus notes, Pineapple, lemon, lime, grapefruit, papaya. A strong pinecone flavor. Not much of a malt backbone, this beer is hop forward obviously. Although this beer isn't thick or bold flavored, the alcohol presence is hidden quite well. 
M- A lighter body for 9.4. Not as bitter as other stone IPA's. Easy drinking and slightly warming.
O- This beer is genius! It shows off the potential of fresh beers. A unique flavor, especially unique to bottles. Get some! 902 charactersTwelveOunces, Nov 29, 2012

Thanks for the hookup Brian.
Pours a crystal clear medium amber color with a decent sized white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Citrus and pine fill the air as soon as I pop the cap on this one. Upon closer inspection my nostrils are delighted by hints of bread and caramel that have been devastated by an onslaught of hoppy goodness. Pepper and green onions mixed with grapefruit pine and resin round out the nose nicely. The flavor is a bit sweeter than I imagined based on the smell. Solid shot of caramel sweetness up front followed by a hint of alcohol and a smattering of pine citrus and onion. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice IPA, but I found the body a bit thicker than I normally expect and a hint more sweetness than I prefer. 819 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 29, 2012

5/5  rDev +13.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my review for the Enjoy By 12 21 12, on draught.
This beer is my favorite of the moment. Tremendously tasty. 
This pours a warm glowing-amber golden in color with thin foam & lacing that lingers around for the long haul. Great aroma, full of orange citrus and marmalade, some tangerine, a bit of pine. It’s pleasing & hoppy, big & vibrant, fresh smelling and full of gobs of hops.
Tastes amazing—the flavor is layers of hop heaven with a bitter bite at the end of each sip. There’s pine and citrus and tangerine and orange and grass and an underlying dankness which I just love. 
There’s enough of a malt profile to hold up to the hoppy assault with a light toasted biscuit note that emerges as it warms. Holds up as a sipper but its also an easy drinker and hides the ABV well. 798 characterselNopalero, Nov 28, 2012

Pours a clear bright gold with half a finger of off-white foam that dissipates quickly. A few spots of lacing left behind.
Aroma is beautiful, juicy, resinous pine and tropical citrus. Lots of floral hints as well as a bit of onion and garlic. Malt backing seems lighter and drier than a typical Stone beer. A hint of alcohol.
Flavor delievers the juicy hops no doubt, although there's a little more sweet malt than I was expecting from the nose. Very well balanced. Bitterness has a rounded sharpness and lingers on for days in the aftertaste. A decent amount of alcohol sneaks through in the aftertaste as well.
Medium bodied with medium-light carbonation. Overall dry. Right on for the DIPA style.
This beer stands on it's own, but it's certainly as close to a RR style IPA that I've tasted from Stone. Great stuff. 887 charactersbrotherloco, Nov 28, 2012

Color is a rich amber, with crystal clarity. Lacing leaves intricate rings and trails that cling and hold. Smell is powerful dank resiny pine. Mouthfeel is clean, crisp. Taste is really something. Big citrus, with a slight sweet-but-not-DIPA-syrup finish. Dangerously drinkable at 9.4%. A new favorite. I hope they continue to release it. 404 characters395er, Nov 28, 2012

Very clear, pale golden, average head, not much retention, decent lacing.
Resinous, oniony/cat pee, citrus, pine, and very faint malt presence. Smells fresh and gooey, but the onion and cat pee are unattractive attributes.
Citrus, pine, medium bitterness, and some malty sweetness poking through on the back end in a balancing role.
Good carbonation, medium body, with a drying and bitter finish.
The grain bill leaves a pretty clean slate upon which the hops can and do shine bright. To me it would be better if they had used some other hop varieties that don't impart the onion and cat piss. Still a pretty damned good dipa. 672 characterssprucetip, Nov 28, 2012

The nose offers very pine-resiny hops, in great abundance in fact. The taste: it's fair to call it a hop bomb, with massive grassy, piney flavor hops, and a fairly goodly amount of straight bittering hops. Some sweetness comes through, but the body is surprisingly light given the strength. The finish, bracingly dry. 
Good beer. Though I'd have soon had one half its strength that I could get in a six back and down in abundance. 544 charactersallengarvin, Nov 28, 2012

As many breweries avoid bottle dating, in fear of turning consumers away, Stone Brewing Company embraces it. In fact, the design of this "devastatingly" fresh IPA has only a 35 day window of consumption. Not that the beer won't be fantastic after that, but the supreme freshness of this beer captures all of those volatile hop compounds that are fast fleeting in even reasonably fresh examples. By the way, if you have an adverse reaction to the word "fresh" you may want to avoid the following review:
As with most IPA, the deep golden hues hinge on light amber and quickly shakes loose its arid, cottony white head. With the substantial hop oils, the beer retains a persistent foam stance and laces the glass sticky as the beer falls. 
Simcoe, citra, motueka, amarillo, super galena, delta, cascade... Oh, my! With seven examples of American hops at their disposal, the aromas cover the gamout of all things IPA: citrus, tropical fruit, acidic, herbal, candied, dank, catty, spicy, stemmy, pine, resinous. The mere scent of the beer makes the tongue sweat.
...and the flavors carry over from there. The upstart of thin honey and caramel is short before being pile-driven into the glass by the hoppy onslaught to come. A variety of grapefruit pulp and skins have an arsenal behind them that start with zesty tangerine, lemon, apricot, mango, and pineapple for a citrusy and tropical tag-team. As the beer tramples the middle palate, the fruit turns dry and the grassy notes of lemograss, freshly muddled lawn grass, cannabis, and earthy-catty notes emerge in the most sticky of tastes. Finishing with the bitter taste of pine resins and chlorophyll, the beer simply throws the malt present to the wayside and dries the palate and gullet to the bone.
Medium-light in body (yes, light(ish) for an imperial ale), because the malts are a shaddow of sweetness that merely gives the hops a candied impression and little else. Instead, the hops dry the beer from the early palate to the aftertaste with complete dominance. The textures are warm and fleeting and never waiver or water. There's the creamy powderyness from hops that saturate the soft tissues of the mouth with no appologies.
This IPA showcases all of the character of hops like few can. What starts as pungent aromas bridge seamlessly into subtle fruit taste, then to spicy earthy notes, and then as sharp resinous bitterness late. The beer is simply a show unto itself and is a must try for anyone who dares to call themselves HopHeads. 2,603 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 27, 2012

A- This beer pours a clear bright copper body with a thin white film of bubbles that last a bit. There is a strong carbonation of big bubbles gliding to the surface. 
S- The full fragrant aroma of cat pee hops is followed by some pineapple weed hops aromas. It is bright and full in the nose.
T- The green pungent woody herbal hops has some green pine resin flavor and a dry fruit cocktail hops flavor that starts to come through. There is a sweet malt flavor that is cut short by a nice dark green pungent hop bitterness in the finish that lingers. There is only a very gentle note of bitterness that lingers in the after taste. 
M- The medium mouthfeel has a cleaning fizz finish and no real alcohol heat is noticed. 
O- The big hop flavors have a nice complexity and good depth. I'm not a fan of cat pee hops but it subsides as other flavors/aromas outshine it. Very good at hiding the alcohol as this is very smooth to drink. 989 charactersrhoadsrage, Nov 27, 2012

O- I'm loving this brew! There's so much going on here and as it warms, i'm offered more and more aromas and flavors. Fresh out of the fridge, i'm adorned by floral, dank, earthy, spicy, hops. The taste is much the same with an added bonus of grapefruit bitterness and a slit alcohol twang that melds nicely. As it warms, citrus, fruit, and sweet malts become more apparent. Citrus and mango show up to the party with sweet bready malts as their entourage. All this comes together with an alcohol twang that melds perfectly with the rest of the flavors and leaves a tingling feeling at the back of the throat, spiciness lingers on my lips long after it's gone. If i had to compare it to anything i would say Drake's Aroma Coma. Both show light on a new evolution of west coast IPA's.

Pours a transparent golden orange color- not much head. Smell- PINEY goodness. Some citrus elements as well. This aroma is world class- I get some buttery sweetness (honey?) behind the pine aroma. Guessing Simcoe was a key dry hop used here. The citrus aroma is orange rind. Smells terrific. Taste- the fresh piney hops pop off my tongue, followed by a mildly sweet (not syrupy) honey backbone, finished by a lasting and delicious bitter piney finish. In my book, this is an absolutely delicious and world class Imperial IPA. Up there with the best on them. For the ABV, there is absolutely no hint of it being 9.4%, esp because the backbone doesn't have that bruising sweetness that you normally expect to achieve that ABV. The piney hops are delicious. Really think this is wonderful, significantly better than Ruination 10 in my book. 928 characterslnashsig, Nov 27, 2012

The pour is on the lighter side, a dull shade of darker golden. Near clear, looser off white head, stays nicely at the one inch mark, then very slowly goes to a thicker film and leaves ample fine spots and webs of lace.
Capital P Pungent hop loaded nose. Booming with grapefruit, tropical fruit, and some pine. Hopalicious...
Fruity, citric, flavorfull hop soaked goodness on the tongue and palate. More dense, pine, grapefruit, resin soaked hop notes. I'm also getting some minty, basil, herbal qualities. 
Hop Heads delight.
Another of Stone's interesting and worthy innovations/concepts. Great marketing. This one lives up to the hoppy hype. Glad I tracked down a few bottles and got to enjoy this obviously super fresh and quite tasty treat. 803 charactersBillolick, Nov 26, 2012

Appearance- The head builds to a half inch of bone white foam. The lace is much more impressive, almost a complete sheet. The body is an orange-gold with a steady flow of carbonation columns.
Smell- There is a dank, earthy herbal quality, almost peppery. The nose is also sweet. This is where the citrus comes into play, some pineapple and clementines.
Taste- Enjoy By is much sweeter on the palate. The pineapple and orange comes through first, followed by the herbal tastes and earthiness. The finish is a little soapy and has a nice tingly bitterness. This works so well: the citrus, the earthy twist, and the bitter snap.
Mouth feel- The body is a lighter - medium and is a little too carbonated for my taste. I would prefer if the body had a little more heft and wasn't so slick. 
Overall- Enjoy By is a great IPA. The flavors all hit the palate almost perfectly. And the combo of flavors make it easy to take another sip. Oh, and this beer is almost 10 percent ABV? Get out of here, because I can't taste it. 1,058 charactersPintofbrown, Nov 26, 2012

4.42/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is for the "12.21.12" edition. Bomber dated 11/16/12 poured into Duvel tulip: consumed & reviewed on 11/25.
This edition pours a strawberry-blonde color: inch of head that is snow white. Retention is moderate on this one: lacing is present, and plenty of clous left on the sides of the glass. This offers a lot on the nose: very dank, weedy aroma is what I get, with a bit of sweet malt in the mix (faint bread pudding). Taste offers more of the same: weedy, somewhat bitter on the back end. This is more balanced than I expected: a bit of a sweet finish to balance bitterness. I do get a bit of onion aftertaste, but the note does not detract from the rest of the flavors. The high abv (9.4%) is well hidden.
If you'd have blind folded me, I'd have thought this was the new batch of Lagunitas Sucks. Honestly, almost identical in my palate's memory. A bit pricey, but high quality. 889 charactersChiPool, Nov 25, 2012

Smell: pine resin, tropical fruits, chopped onion, herbal and dank hops. 
Taste: sticky pine resins up front, with a strong hop bitterness. Tropical fruits dance across the palate, everything from pineapple to peach to grapefruit and mango. Sweet honey malt character balances underneath everything. Superb. 
Feel: medium body, lots of carbonation, lingering aftertaste. 
Overall: One of the premier DIPAs out there. 520 characterscrob3888, Nov 25, 2012

Not a lot of malt backbone, but this is about hops. Drying hop bitterness in finish. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV. Great way to highlight the importance of drinking hoppy beers when they are fresh. 490 charactershomebrewhawk, Nov 25, 2012

Interesting marketing in this regard--absolutely in your face about when the beer will start to fade. In Boston, my favorite store had only two cases available. Both were kept in back for the "regulars". Good idea to produce just enough for us beer geeks.
Solid three finger head that settles slowly leaving plenty of chunky lace on the glass. The liquid is nearly clear with a neutral gold color.
Strong evergreen aroma with a bit of citrus; some white pepper...all from hops! I cannot detect any smells from the malts. Still, this is inviting.
Starts with a mild pale malt flavor. This is completely gone once I swallow--a complete hop bomb with an expected never-ending aftertaste. If you love your beer very bitter, you'll love this one. The body is relatively weak when compared to other DIPAs. The high carbonation adds to this effect. 909 characterssmcolw, Nov 25, 2012

I was unable to find the first batch around here a few months back, but was happy to see tons of this third batch around.
A- Pours a light golden color. This beer is very clear, and leaves about a half finger worth of white colored head. Some lacing along the sides of the glass is visible. 
S- A nice aromatic beer. Lots of mango, grapefruit, orange, and pine hops on the smell. 
T- This one is tasty. The hops shine through in the taste as expected. Pine dominates in the hop taste over anything else. Some citrus is in there too but not nearly as notable as the pine. 
M- Light to medium bodied, well carbonated, bitter, dry finish. This beer does not drink like 9.4%ABV, a very easy drinker. 
Another great IPA by Stone. It's up there with Ruination and Ruination 10th as one of my favorite IPAs from them. 923 charactersvic21234, Nov 24, 2012

Bright clean aroma of pineapple, resinous pine, mango and a hint of eucalyptus.
The taste was more fresh-cut grass than pine with a juicy bite of fresh grapefruit. Finished clean with a medicinal/eucalyptus note. The 9% alcohol was well hidden.
Medium bodied and crisp with a fairly sharp carbonation.

The beer pours a clear yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is full of orange with some resin and a bit of pineapple thrown in. The flavor is similar. The orange and pineapple notes really come through nicely, adding a nice juicy flavor. There is also some biscuit malt to keep the bitterness from being too high. The alcohol is also a bit noticeable but the beer is still easy to drink. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 481 charactersMora2000, Nov 24, 2012

A - pours a nice dark amber color with a nice off white head. Retained the head for a bit with some minimal lacing. Just based off appearance it was tempting
S - grapefruits, pine, marijuana. Smell was stronger than a normal IPA but wasn't as strong as Stone's Ruination. Subdued but still strong if that makes sense. 
T - FRESH!! Grapefruit, Pine, dry marijuana, hint of pineapple, then a nice malt middle before finishing bitter but not destroying my palate. 
M - coats the mouth nicely. Not too thin, not too sticky. Just resinous enough.
O - I loved it. I wish it was a year round release. I haven't drank the other 2 releases but this is easily one of my top 5 beers. My family doesn't drink craft beer and usually hates what I drink but my brother took a sip of mine and enjoyed this. Definitely buy a few bottles or trade for them. 903 charactersJohnnyramirez, Nov 24, 2012
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoy by 12/21/12.
A: Pours a very clear medium amber with a bit of red in there. Big foamy light tan head. Fades at a moderate pace, leaving behind decent foamy traces of lacing. Good retention.
S: Lots of pine and tropical fruit. Loaded with a garlicky, oniony, Summit-like aroma. Touch of resin. 
T: Grapefruit, pine and tropical fruit up front. A bit of sweet caramel in the middle and then turns into a strong garlic/onion taste along with a wave of bitterness. Carries into the aftertaste along with a very long and lingering resinous hoppy taste. 
M: Fairly full bodied, slick hop oils coat the mouth almost unlike any beer I've had. Tastes like pure garlic coating everything.
O: Pretty good DIPA but that garlic/onion overpowers the whole beer and really unbalances it. Extremely hoppy in general though it's not super bitter, just a nice strong and pleasant wave right after the middle of the taste. Tasty and drinkable enough to warrant a 4.5 here but not in the taste category. 994 charactersDope, Nov 24, 2012

22oz Bottle
Served in a Stone 14th Anniversary Pint Glass
A: This beer surprisingly lighter in color than anticipated. My memory might be slipping but this beer seems lighter than the 9/21/12 (first) batch. Nice 1-2 finger head with some lacing. No apparent alcohol legs from this 9.4% ABV beer.
S: A strong pine scent with some grapefruit aromas are the main scent components of the beer. There is no booze aroma present.
T: Right up front there are big sticky flavors of pine with grapefruit and some tropical fruit flavors mid palate. There is a nice malty backbone that plays well with the hops. There is a nice lingering bitterness for the finish. This is a really good DIPA.
M: This beer has a sticky sweet mouthfeel. The effervescence does a good job cutting the sweetness down, leaving you the craving for the next swig.
O: Of the two versions I have had (9/21/12 and 12/21/12) this one is the better of the two. If you like big West Coast DIPA’s I would say find (or trade for) it. Recommended. 1,028 charactersPsyko, Nov 24, 2012

A: A clear golden pour with a small head and minimal lacing.
S: Incredible tropical fruits and citrus - lots of mango, passionfruit and red ruby grapefruit as well as some pine needles.
T: Wow! Like the nose, the beer tastes tropical/citrusy with a nice malt backbone. Pine needles again make their presence known.
M: Medium-oily with a piny, dry long-lasting finish. Beer is a tad less than medium carbonated in my opinion. 
O: A SUPER DIPA in my opinion. Tastes better than Pliny and I hope Stone makes this a regular offering. Grab one while they last. 596 charactersHatzilla, Nov 24, 2012

4.8/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz. bottle that's poured into a large Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Liquid comes out a light golden yellow color with perfect clarity. Huge white foamy head that comes up big after a hard pour. , good lacing, but not great. Still there's a thin layer of the head that stays through the whole session which is cool.
The smell is awesome, almost perfect. Generous aromas of citrus, pine, and floral hops attack your nose right away with each sniff. And initial tickle from the bitterness then a nice sweet aroma, followed by a nice warming effect from the alcohol. A really nice straight forward/doesn't beat around the bush double IPA. Everything about each aspect is solid, and nothing is lacking. 
Taste actually kicks it up a notch. Bursts of fresh citrus and just about ripe tropical fruits. Some citrus peel/zest as well that blends with some nice pale/caramel malt sweetness. It's hoppy to start with out being overly bitter which is nice. It's tough to make a beer this hoppy without being a pallet wrecker, Stone knocks it out of the park with this super fresh DIPA.
Mouthfeel is so close to being perfect, but there's some slight room for improvement I guess. Medium bodied, with a great carbonation level. There's a great sweetness to bitterness ratio for a DIPA. NO bite from the alcohol either, for 9.4 you'd expect it, but it's actually well hidden. Starts sweet and has a nice bitter finish, not too dry and a little oily. The drinkability is absolutely ridiculous. I almost ran out of liquid for this review!
This is beyond the upper echelon of beers for the style, it's elite. Seek this beer out and consume it fresh, don't sit on it. Thanks Stone, when you consistently push quality product at such high distribution and amounts, then you deserve to be Arrogant Bastards! 1,794 charactersAndyAvalanche, Nov 24, 2012

Appearance - Golden to amber hue, with very little head, almost no retention.
Decent carbonation, and light amount of lacing left on the glass. Good so far.
Smell - Oh. My. God. Over the top fresh-hop smell. Wet hops, pine needles, and some muted herbal notes in the background. Some grapefruit and quince as well.
Taste - This beer is a monster! The grassy fresh hop notes are there, and melt into hints of Grapefruit (No shock), and apricot notes, with hints of lemon verbena and a little bit of white sage and bell pepper. A non-stop assault on the taste-buds that leaves me happy in the knowledge that I snagged more than one bottle. Pliny has some serious competition!
Mouthfeel - Full and resinous, with lighter carbonation than I expected from this one, but seriously, I'm not complaining about it, it's a damn good beer! Hangs around on the palate for quite a while after finishing the glass. YUM.
Overall - A well made trip to the land of fresh hops from stone. I was insanely impressed with this beer, and highly recommend you get your hands on some as soon as humanly possible! And, That being said, Enjoy it before the end of the world. HA!!! 1,211 charactersStuporJew, Nov 23, 2012

Nose is really nice with pine and tropical fruit. 
Taste is great. Leans more to the tropical side than most I have ever had. Good and resiny. Some grapefruit to finish it out. I am not up on my tropical fruits. I would guess guava or papaya.

Pours a light fizzy bubbly head of about 1/2 finger, that fades semi slowly, the decent head retention leads to some nice lacing as well. The beer is a crystal clear golden honey tan colored beer.
Nose is fantastic! Tons of fresh hops, lots of pine and resin, some tropical fruit passion fruit, guava, mango, papaya, even a little grapefruit. Fresh resinous musty wet hop aromas, etc etc. A very light malty base under that, maybe all pale malts, but just enough to prop up the hops.
Taste brings a decent bitterness. Again hops just explode, fresh tropical fruit galore, mango, papaya, guava, passion fruit and some musty resinous super fresh hop flavors. A little hop oil cuts in with more of the resin, plenty of pine and a bit of citrus too. A light fluffy malt base is there as well, again I think all pale malt or mostly so as there's no real contributing malt flavor, but a nice malt that brings a good base for the hops to float on and not destroy. It also has a mild sweetness that helps balance the fairly bitter hop profile. Finish is a bit drier, long lingering bitterness, more musty resinous fresh hops, little pine and lots more tropical fruit.
Mouth is med bodied, fluffy and nice carb, and a bit oily, with just a bit of warming alcohol.
Overall quite nice. Lots of great fresh hop additions, super fresh, resinous wet hop flavors, oily, just enough malt to prop it up. delicious. 1,487 charactersjlindros, Nov 23, 2012

Removed from the fridge and left out for 20 minutes or so before opening. 
Bottle finally tracked down with help. Thanks, Jason. This sold out in a few hours in every store I hit -- insane. 
A: Pours a clear, golden-peach body with a finger of off-white head. Great retention, leaving substantial sudsing down the sides as it falls into a thin collar. But not much in the way of lace during the drink. 
S: Grass and a touch of pine that borders on mint and onion (Nelson, I'm guessing) as well as a lesser citrus punch (pineapple, papaya, tangelo). 
T: Pine, grass, a little weed. Pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit rind. My personal preference would be to see the citrus dominating over the 'green' flavors, but it's tasty as it is. The exhalation produces wisps of onion. 
M: This is easily the best aspect of the beer. Pronounced bitterness, but it's not palate-wrecking because the oils clean up at the end of a sip (good carbonation). Despite the ABV, there is no heat. And the body is not syrupy / sugary like some higher-ABV DIPAs / TIPAs tend to be. You won't find any sugar burn on the back end. Very clean. They absolutely nailed this. 
O: I saw some comments saying that this batch was more Nelson-dominated than the first one, and I'd have to agree -- the tropical fruit punch aroma and flavor has been dialed back a bit. Just the same, it's a great DIPA. Worth seeking out, though I'm surprised it has gotten quite the hubbub it has. 1,484 charactersArbitrator, Nov 23, 2012

4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sooo looking forward to this one. Probably hyped it up too much. We'll see.
Big hoppy, citrus aroma. Not too sharp or overpowering. Like a quality standard IPA. Sometimes you can get some alcohol character from something of this strength but this one is nicely restrained.
Taste too is smooth but still big on bitterness and hop flavour. Very well integrated with the malt allowing for a big abv while not detracting from a fantastic fresh ho character.
Wow! One of the best double IPAs I've had. Certainly comes across as a big beer without smashing you in the face to let you know it. 589 charactersjoecast, Nov 23, 2012

The nose is comprised of BIG citrus and pine. Once the beer settles, hop resin breaks through. The mouthfeel is peculiar and affected more than I like by the flavor. Mouthfeel should accentuate the flavor, the flavor shouldn't molest the mouthfeel. When first pulled into the mouth, there's a pleasing fullness that quickly is overtaken by the harsh hop burn and sting of carbonation for which Stone is so famous/infamous. Strong, resiny pine flavor that is, oddly enough, balanced with the grain bill. I'm not sure how much grain it would require to balance this hop assault, but they've figured it out. Another disappointment for me. Stone is just not in my wheelhouse. 747 charactersDocJitsu, Nov 23, 2012

This one pours a light bodied, very clear bright orange gold in color with a soapy, off white one finger head. The clarity is great. The nose is very fresh, pungent. It has notes of light pine, slightly oniony Nelson, maybe some Simcoe, maybe some Centennial and has a light and clean malt bill. It's just really clean. The flavors too, very clean. The pine and onion are in proper ratios, favoring the light pine significantly. There is also a nice bitter citrus character. It drinks very, very light in body and is quite sessionable for both the style and abv because of this. This is a really nice DIPA. The price was certainly right on this. I like this idea, force feeding freshness is very effective. Well done Stone, well done. 764 charactersaasher, Nov 22, 2012

A-Pours a crystal clear watered gold color. Head is about an inch thick. It retains with commendable stamina. Head is off-white and leaves slithery lacing. Stone makes the prettiest beers.
S-Nose is a 5. Big and exotic. Dripping, dank, hempy hops. I think I smell some Nelson Sauvin here. A trident of citrus, herbs and grass. A hint of honey covered cracker malt. But this is a 100% hop showcase. This hop combo ranks among my all time favorites. Pineapple all over the place. Love it!
T-Rarely do I take a second to sit back and respect a beer's scrumptiousness. This is one of those times. This has got to have some Nelson Sauvin in here (my favorite hop). It starts off citrus then bends into pineapple. The pineapple becomes grass, which becomes marijuana, which becomes flower petals, which becomes fresh cut grass,which becomes sticky pine. I could easily continue.
M-Buzzing bubbles. The body feels lighter than a beer that is a hair behind 10%. Dry and aggressively bitter. Feels like liquid gold.
O/D-I have had some great hoppy beers by Stone. I have also had some subpar hoppy Stone brews. This one might be the best. It is reminiscent of Heady Topper and several Hill Farmstead brews I have tried. I swear that they have some Nelson Sauvin hops in there. Regardless of the applied hop varietals; this flavor is the in the same vein as my all time favorites. Hey Stone, GOOD JOB! 1,478 charactersVelvetExtract, Nov 22, 2012

Bottle to Parra Tulip
22oz
Enjoy by 12.21.12
Purchased from Party House Liquor, Chino Hills, CA
App- This was a very nice deep and bursting orange. The density was fairly light and had a bit of darker edges to it. You could say it was turning into an amber around the edges with some yellows smattered in. The head was a wonderful 2-1/2 finger dense and compact white. Huge amounts of lace and stick. Would say its up there with best I've seen.
Smell- There was a good amount of deep citrus in the glass with the aromas coming up with a bit of sweet creme, oranges, pine, resin and a backing malty note that was well integrated and not overpowering.
Taste- Well I read the forum about the flavors you never got and said Ive never gotten that garlic thing, well I do know. This was flavorful but the hops used in combination with certain malts gave me a good duality of flavors. Rich citrus and dense at times but creeping in was a light garlic and scallion flavor. Was a bit off to me, but the rest of the beer was pretty good to balance it out.
Mouth- This was a fairly dense medium body with a good amount of carbonation behind it. The residual flavors on this were the deep citrus and the garlic and onion flavors.
Drink- A tasty beer, but no where near what I was thinking. It was semi balanced and flavorful, but I thought this would be a 10th and 16th killer. The garlic and scallion just didnt work for me. 1,439 charactersFosterJM, Nov 22, 2012

Enjoy by pours a crystal clear star color with a fingers worth of head. Tons of citrus notes on the nose up front with some spicy on the back end. There is a touch of malt up front that explodes into citrus and biting bitter finish. The beer is super easy to drink. I really hope stone decides to full time with this beer rather then just certain regions because I want to drink this all the time. 456 charactersThedaver4220, Nov 22, 2012

Bottled on: 11.16.12
A: The beer pours a clear golden body with a thin white head that quickly fades and leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. By far the clearest IPA I have ever seen.
S: I am getting a strong piny hop scent with some sweetness from the grain. The hops are almost peppery to me.
T: The taste is very strong in hops and gives off a type of oniony pepper flavor. As it lingers, it mellows out a bit and turns sweet.
M: There is a slight amount of carbonation on the back of the throat and the tip of the tongue, but really not much else. Its a very thin bodied beer too.
O: By far one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Damn I wish they could make this fresh year round for me to get. 726 charactersgtermi, Nov 22, 2012

A: Slightly dirty gold with nearly white 1/2 finger head which retains well and leaves copious lacing despite the ABV.
S: This beer blasts away with resinous pine, grapefruit pith, honeysuckle, and pineapple hoppiness. The malt aroma is minimal. There is a bit of alcohol singe on the nostrils.
T: The flavor also favors the resiney qualities of hops with pine, a bit of lemongrassiness, and pineapple flavors with some solid grapefruit throughout. I think the dry hopping on this beer is superb, both in term sof aroma and flavor. THe maltiness provides counterpoint to the humongous hoppiness, but succumbs. The bitterness is moderate to high but it still drinks remarkably easily. The alcohol is very well hidden.
M: This has a bit more heft than I was expecting. The carbonation also seemed a bit high but it was still quite drinkable. I am glad I asked for a half-serving as I wonder how easily a pint would have gone down.
O: A very good DIPA from Stone. It parades all of the lush resinous hops qualities unabashedly. 1,112 charactersargock, Nov 22, 2012

Pours a nice gold with a solid 2 inch head. The lacing is decent.
Flowers and citrus start this off, booze, caramel and pine resin follow (and that's just the nose.)
The first thing I taste is grapefruit and pine. Pale malts, more pine and caramel follow. Alcohol heat is on the low end of noticable. The pine and citrus last forever in my mouth. Light, but not watery, the carbonation smooths out quickly.
Top notch double IPA! I hop (hahaha) they don't keep jacking up the price. Still, very worth trying if you love the hops! 705 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Nov 22, 2012
4.1/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22oz bomber into Globe glass.
A. Poured 1 finger of head. Great retention. Decent lacing. Color is a fairly pale orange, or what could be described as a very dark golden. Whatever you call it the color is considerably lighter than most DIPAs.
S. Pretty crisp citrus hop aroma up front fades into some piney hops, and a bit of biscuity malt. Not as in your face with the hop aroma as a lot of other DIPAs. If I had to put a word on it I would say it is restrained. 
T. Probably the easiest drinking DIPA I have had. Really smooth. Not a tremendous amount of hop flavor. Get some faded grapefruit, and a bit of other citrus hop flavor, a hint of some tropical fruitiness. Nice balance between hop and malt. Finishes on the sweeter side but overall well rounded. Has a nice biscuity malt flavor that really gives this beer a nice touch. 
M. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Finishes with a touch of sweetness.
O. Interesting beer. Not a lot of aroma or flavor, but extremely smooth. The drinkability of this almost makes up for the lack of depth in the aroma, and flavor. 1,087 characterssiradmiralnelson, Nov 22, 2012

A- With an aggressive pour Enjoy By 12/21/12 pours a deep gold color, brilliantly clear with 2 fingers of rocky, foamy white head that seems to linger awhile and leaves some mild lacing on the glass.
S- A super aromatic beer. Huge aromas coming off of this one of ripe pineapple and other rich and overly ripe tropical fruits. There is a nice underlying sweetness underneath the tropical fruits that compliments them well. Smells wonderful. 
T- Follows nose well. Super up front fresh hop bite that IPA lovers seek. Very tasty combination of the tropical fruits and bready, biscuity malts. 
M- Nice and creamy. Nice mouth coating texture that ensures the whole palate gets a taste. Medium amount of carbonation that suits the style well. Super refreshing.
O- After trying this nobody should question whether or not Stone brews a solid IPA or DIPA. This is one solid beer. Crisp and refreshing, what more could one want out of a beer? Seek this one out. 1,050 charactersrfbenavi80, Nov 22, 2012

A: Wow! Holy base malt! This one is super light. Sort of the color of a blonde ale of another light brew. This has a super thick 2+ inch white head that fades slowly. This beer is beyond filtered. This beer is perfectly clear like the waters of Bora Bora! Good.
S: Smells of fresh sweet grapefruit with some blended iced tea notes with a floral backbone. This is definitely an IPA. Good.
T: Starts off with a dry watery malt which ramps up to overcome your tongue with a citrus floral hop bite that lingers and slowly fades on the back into a dry watery light malt. Good.
M: Medium-light body with a carbonation mouthful. A dry bitter finish. Very good.
O: All in all, this is a good beer, but I have had plenty better DIPA's. Definitely try if you like Stone and find the concept interesting, but I find I will not be looking to hunt this one down again anytime soon. 991 characterssteve8robin, Nov 22, 2012

Third batch - 12.21.12
Bottled on 11.16.12
Served in a snifter
The liquid poured an exceedingly crystal clear, orangey-amber color and was topped by a small, bubbly, frothy, bright white head. I cannot remember the last time I saw a beer of this style so thoroughly filtered. The head quickly dissipated to a thin film. Drippy blocks of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was simply one of the best I have ever encountered in a double IPA. Super pungent, dank and resiny. Off the hook weed-like. Bright and floral. Fruity and semi-sweet. Lots of overripe nectaries, peaches and mango. This was truly a joy to smell.
The flavor profile was outstanding as well. It was super hoppy but lacked the bitterness and astringency found in similar examples. Amazingly well balanced. A touch of bready, pale malts appeared on the front end. Intense tropical fruit notes later took over. Peaches, nectaries and pineapple came through strong. Candied orange peel was also noticeable. The finish was crisp and only moderately bitter with notes of grapefruit rind. For a 9.6% ABV beer, the alcohol was exceptionally well hidden.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied for the style. A touch thinner then expected. The liquid contained a fine, zippy, tongue blanketing effervescence.
Stone's IPAs can be a bit too dry, pithy and bitter for my palate, but this beer was amazingly well balanced and ridiculously drinkable. All in all, Enjoy By IPA was one of the best double IPAs I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. This beer is so dank, hoppy and fruity that it left me begging for more. I would love to see Stone transition this into a regular offering. 1,724 charactersDamian, Nov 22, 2012

A - Pours a light golden blond with one finger snow white colored foam head. Lacing clings to sides of glass.
S - Mango, orange, tangerine, pine, pineapple and just tons of tropical citrus notes.
T - Waves of tropical citrus and stinging pine needles immediately appear on initial sip. Touch of alcohol heat and then a dryness finishes things off.
M - Medium bodied with a lingering dryness.
O - Hats off to Stone on this one. This a like a tropical party in your mouth with all the flavors of a world class IIPA. More of a dry finish than other IPA's but it just keeps you going back for the next sip. Worth seeking out. 681 characterspigc, Nov 22, 2012

A: Light golden color with tinges of orange. Great clarity. Creamy white head holds fast at a height of about two inches. Thin webs of lacing decorate the glass as the beer is consumed.
S: Christ this is one aromatic beer. The scent of it hits you as soon as the cap is popped. Kiwi, melon, passion fruit, bright citrus notes of pithy tangerine and clementine. Broken pine needles and a slight pine resin, faint mint. Malt base of dough and biscuit underneath all the hops. 
T: Broken pine needles, resin, and hop oils on the attack. Tangerine, pithy white grapefruit, lemon rind, mango. Bitterness is firm and even up front, but grows on the mid palate and into the finish, ending with a strong oily, resiny bite. Slight tropical esters and a well-hidden touch of peppery alcohol almost go unnoticed. Doughy malt base dries toward the finish into tastes of biscuit and a pleasant graininess. Finishes with a strong, bitter wallop of oily, resiny, planty hops that lingers on the palate for quite some time. 
M: Medium bodied. Creamy and very smooth with a moderate prickling carbonation that lifts it and makes it feel deceptively light and airy on the palate. 
O: Much praise goes out to Stone for this one. It's a great concept, and quite genius really: market an IPA solely on its freshness date. Making the "Enjoy By" date glaringly obvious not only ensures that the consumer gets the freshest possible beer off the shelf, but it also goads them into drinking it within that freshness date. Everyone gets the optimal drinking experience, and brewery and consumer alike are happy. The execution of this concept was no easy task either, but Stone seems to be handling it very well. Brewing different batches for different regions of the country and staggering the release dates seems to be the only logical way to go about it. Even a larger craft brewery like Stone has its limitations when it comes to brewing capacity, distribution, etc. Everything seems to be going off without a hitch though. I have yet to hear a complaint stemming from any of the previous releases. Of course all of this goes out the window if the beer itself sucks, but suck this beer does not. In fact, to top it all off, this may be the best new DIPA I've had all year. It's incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor, and it drinks like a dream. I didn't believe that it was 9.4% abv until I felt it. I'm calling in a favor and getting a ride from someone when I find this on tap. 2,553 charactersryan1788a5, Nov 22, 2012

Rocking the 12/21/12 batch. This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises mango, light pineapple, light leek, dank-ish greens, sweet caramel in the background, and a touch of grapefruit peel. Were it not for everything else coming together so well, that leek would've damaged this stuff in my [nose's] eyes. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, pine resin, sweet caramel, orange rind, and a hint of greens. The fruits that are so fleshy and bright in the smell come through overtly rindy on the tongue. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, fairly sticky finish. Overall, a damn solid IPA, one that seems to suffer from over-freshness (if you can believe that!): I think the hops might meld slightly better with a little bit of age on this stuff. Still, it's pretty tasty. 896 charactersTMoney2591, Nov 22, 2012

Appearance: Perfectly clear molten gold. It shines, it's interesting. Head is bright-white, bubbly, and loose. Drops to a small cap with some solid, but not crazy lacing. Moderate carbonation pulls from the bottom.
Smell: Citrus, pine resin, oily. Grapefruit. Tropical aromas as well. Tangerine and mango with some pineapple. Sweet citrusy hops. Tropical fruit punches up as the beer warms. Some pale, crackery malt mixes with the hops. Deep resinous pine. Grapefruit flesh. Fresh and juicy. Aggressive, but mellow for a Stone approach.
Taste: Tangerine. Loads of tangerine mixed with some pineapple and oily pine. Slick and resinous. Grapefruit flesh loaded with sweet pine needles. Pithy bitterness as well. Pale malts add a cracker-like snap. Minimal malt sweetness. A hint of aspirin on the back as well. As it warms the bitterness ramps up and smacks of oily pine resins with a faint hint of tangerine.
Mouthfeel: Slick, smooth, and easy drinking. Dry and bitter on the finish.
Overall: Mayan approved.
Another solid DIPA from Stone. Aggressive, but never overbearing. A nice change of profile for them as well. Worth checking out and getting back again. 1,198 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Nov 21, 2012

 I'm a hophead and prefer the DIPA style. This brew was so dank, earthy, and composty -- way beyond pine and grapefruit! I've never had anything like it. I desperately tried to get my hands on more of it, but no luck. 
 The hype is not hype. If you like hops, do yourself a big favor and try this one if you can find it. All I can do is hope that Stone is going to meet the market on this one and not just let the buzz flow.

Poured in to a tulip. Slightly hazy, golden colored body. 1 finger head. Good lacing.
Aroma was crazy amounts of hops. Super danky, tropical and citrusy. Some biscuity, malty backbone, but this is hops dominant. Extremely floral.
Flavor was hop dominant. Very delicious, resinous and danky. Loads of floral, tropical and citrus hop flavors up front. Good amount of maltyness in the middle with a slightly biscuity flavor. Finished with a lingering, resinous bitterness. Grapefruity, lemony and orangey in the finish. Slight signs of ABV with a bit of alcohol warmth.
Mouthfeel had a medium body, medium carb and a dry finish. Hops shined very brightly in the finish.
Overall this was amazing. Probably one of the best, more floral and pungent DIPA's I've had. Would be nice to see this one year-round. 821 charactersriored4v, Nov 13, 2012

All earth and citrus and hop profile that doesn't have the dimensions of a lot of the strong DIPA's out there. Has a puckering bite but not much else going on or lingering in the aftertaste.
Definitely highly drinkable for the 9% ABV which is great but the flavors don't really grab me or make this one memorable. This isn't a beer that will knock your socks off. It's a solid strong IPA but too similar to Stone's other releases to be anything special. 516 charactersLubricatedWisdom76, Nov 12, 2012

T&lt; I really enjoyed the hop profile on this one, kind of reminded me of pliny with citrus lemons and grapefruit that helped out on the bitterness factor but maintained a good balance between the sweetness from the malts. I also got grassy, earthy, hints of woody notes and a touch of mango fruit.

Enjoy By IPA pours a lighter gold color. It’s clear, and backlighting gives it a brighter, more yellow look. I like it. Doesn’t look there’s much caramel malt here. Awesome! An off-white head covers the top. It’s rather modest, rising to less than a finger in height. It doesn’t stick around long at all and leaves a lighter, spotty lacing behind. 
The nose is alright, but isn’t great. It’s not all that aromatic. Needs more strength. It does have a rather prominent toasted malt presence. Not my favorite thing. Smells sweet and a bit sugary. Hops are definitely noted and feature a diverse variety of scents – citric, piney, a little herbal, and definitely danky. Hops are certainly the focal point here. Doesn’t smell all that balanced. Alcohol is noticeable, but isn’t overwhelming. Smells pretty good. More strength would improve it. 
The flavor is easily a notch better. The malt base is very sugary and sweet. There is a bit of a toasted malt presence, but it’s more subtle than anticipated. I like that. I also like there’s no caramel malt! Hops the focal point and are very flavorful! Citric flavors of grapefruit and pineapple hit first. They’re followed by a mix of piney and herbal notes. Definitely dank and bitter. It definitely leans in the hop direction, but it’s a bit more balanced than you might expect. Alcohol is definitely there, but isn’t warming or hot. Finishes sweet, citric, herbal, and a little dry.
Enjoy By IPA has a body that’s on the lighter side of medium. Carbonation is mid-range, but isn’t buzzy. Feels soft and smooth. For nearly 10% abv, this stuff goes down rather easily. 
I really like the idea behind Enjoy By IPA, and the beer itself is really good, too. I don’t have many complaints. The hop flavor is a tad danky and herbal for me, but it is still good. In the line of Stone’s recent DIPA releases, this one falls in the middle. It’s a little better than 16th Anniversary, but it’s not really close to the Ruination 10th Anniversary Release. Easy recommendation nonetheless. 2,085 charactersprototypic, Nov 03, 2012

Pours a clear golden amber with a finger of white head. Pungent hop nose on this. Very heavy on the pine and citrus peel, light herbal notes, grass, and a decent floral quality. The flavor is a touch on the sweet side with some toffee and caramel sweetness. Good amount of tangerine, some grapefruit, and a strong pine bitterness on the finish. Alcohol isn’t present on the flavor, but certainly noticeable in terms of sobriety altering effects. Good, but wasn’t as good as Ruination 10th. 511 characterswomencantsail, Oct 24, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A-	Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass, it was crystal clear with a pale honey yellow body. A frothy white 2 finger head formed to the top, with decent lacing and pretty good retention.
S-	I wish I hadn’t read the reviews before tasting this… all I can think of is ONION! It’s a super hoppy assault on the nostrils with big hits of grapefruit and other citrus notes. Onion is certainly there but it really only sticks out if you think about it. Don’t get me wrong, it’s certainly not displeasing, but it does stand out.
T-	Daaamn! That is one fresh, hoppy, grapefruity, beer! Stand back malt and let the hops get to work. This beer is a must try (if you can get your hands on a fresh one!) for the hop head. It’s not a grapefruit bomb as some beers are, but the freshness of the hops is absurd. 
M-	This beer has an optimal bitterness in my opinion. It feels just right. The body seems to be a bit lighter than I had anticipated, but not enough to detract from my enjoyment of the beer. The oils from the hops are INTENSE here (as anticipated). The instant you taste this beer the hop oils coat your whole mouth and hold on for dear life. 
Overall, if you can get it TRY IT, but if you can’t you can always vote that they send their next batch to your area! I made sure to get mine as fresh as possible (bottled 5 days ago, hit my local beer store’s shelves 10 minutes before I got there) and drank it right away, if not for the novelty alone. 1,472 characterstdexterc, Oct 23, 2012

This is far and away the best Stone product I've ever had. The nose if full of incredibly ripe citrus. Grapefruit, orange, and even some pineapple and mango. 
Bitter as all hell with huge hop flavors similar to the nose. Dry, light malt profile makes a perfect platform for the hops. No alcohol presence for 9.4% abv. So incredibly fresh and powerful. Solid mouthfeel and caebonation. Just a wonderful beer tat I wish was available all the time. A heavy hitter, wow! 565 charactersBrew33, Oct 20, 2012

4.86/5  rDev +10.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This review will be for the version with the 11.09.12 date. We're going 22 ounces split multiple ways on a Sunday afternoon. On to the beer:
The pour yields a beer which is a lighter gold, looking most resemblent to the color of cider. A small head is formed on top, and a few spots of lace are left on the glass. I figuered that the nose would say hops, cuz this is Stone and it's an IPA, but I wasn't expecting this. HOPS!! Fruity, delectable hops. I haven't looked into the hop bill of this recipe, but I want to say New Zealand hops are the majority in this one. Big fruit salad notes, also big on canteloupe, pine, passionfruit, and mango. This could be good.
For a beer with 9.4%, this beer seems much lighter than that, yet retains all the good flavor of such a strong beer. The alcohol is hidden extremely well, and flavors similar in the nose are coming out in full force in the taste; passionfruit, orange, canteloupe, sweet varieties of tropical fruits. And for such a hoppy beer, it's not bitter at all. The beer's body is medium-full, with a very smooth texture and appealing finish. 
Where did this come from? And where was I in California when this was released? I was exteremly impressed with Stone on this creation. Time to set the clock when the next version will be released... 1,299 charactersDoubleJ, Oct 20, 2012
4.72/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522 oz. bottle poured into DFH signature glass. Big thanks to mrfong07 for sending this one. I can't seem to find a best by date.
A - Pours a surprisingly light straw color with two fingers of snow-white head. Perfectly clear opacity. The head dies after a few minutes, but leaves behind a great lacing.
S - This one has that pungent, almost rotten, grapefruit and hemp smell that I love. Citrus hops are in full effect. Riddled with tropical fruits. I love it. 
T - Follows the nose very closely. The citrus dominates form the start followed by floral hops. Intense tropical fruits and a garlicy twang come through in the middle. Slightly tart and acidic on the back end with a big piney hop finish. Hops linger long after each sip. Mmmm.
M - Standard. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation for the style. 
O - This is a fantastic DIPA that may not appeal to everyone, but suits my palate perfectly. It has all of the qualities I look for, especially the abrasive, dank, hoppiness. Big on the citrus, tropical fruits, and hops. Additionally it has that X-factor fresh hop flavor that I love, but can't put my finger on (garlic or onion? but in a very good way). I love the idea behind this beer and I wish it would be more widely available. I hope they keep up the Enjoy By ___ series and eventually release it to my market. Why should Ohio and Colorado get all the goodness? I put it right up there with the big boys (Pliny, Heady).

Pours out a nice bright and clear yellow/orange with a 1 finger white and fluffy head. 
The aroma is full of fresh hops: mango, peach, orange, papaya and grapefruit tropical fruit notes, fresh grassy and floral notes too. 
The taste is also intensely hoppy and fresh! A lot of the sweeter tropical fruit notes are up front: mango, peach, grapefruit, papaya, orange along with a nice amount of floral and grassy hop notes. There is a slight malt backbone, but not much. You can't taste or smell the alcohol at all.
The mouthfeel is pretty thin, but the mouthfeel is pretty creamy. Another great beer from Stone! I really like the idea behind this beer and pick it up if you still can! 746 charactersJohnnyMc, Oct 17, 2012

11.09.12
This is perhaps clearer than any IPA I've ever seen. The color is sort of an autumn orange with straw yellow highlights at the stem. One finger of bubbly white foam doesn't last long, leaving a soapy layer. Lace and bubbles hang across the glass.
I wouldn't have expected three days to do much damage, but the aroma isn't nearly as vibrant as when I sampled a bottle earlier in the week. While the first bottle had a wonderful, grapefruit and sugar beet aroma that was a perfect ratio of sweet citrus, the beer in my glass now has a fairly common grapefruit/pine combo and a light, biscuit/dough notion. To its credit, there nose is clean despite readily appreciable hop oils and resins. Alcohol is barely noticeable. At the risk of sounding cliche, you can smell the hops fade as you hold the glass.
The hops are a bit of a let down for the palate. Pine and prickly citrus are surprisingly one dimensional (though I hesitate to call it bland). The hops don't have the same zeal as the earlier bottle (or from the tap). Bitterness is moderately high. At least most of the flavor is still there. Thankfully, malts are sent to hiding; just some dusty biscuit and cracker notes. 
The body is trim, maybe even thin, considering the style. Carbonation is rather light. While I generally like low carbonation, in this case it makes for a weak feel overall. It doesn't help that alcohol slickness trumps the hop oils.
My overall impression is that Enjoy By is pretty much a gimmick. Purposefully making a product that deteriorates rapidly and pushing distribution to get it across the country? Sounds like Stone has quit being arrogant and gone to being obnoxious. Nevertheless, sometimes gimmicks can turn out alright, which is the case here. At the very least, Stone should be commended for making a DIPA that isn't a complete sugary booze bomb. 1,897 charactersRyan011235, Oct 15, 2012

Bomber
 I have very little to say about this beer except that it was nothing special. Average beer at most and that I have plenty of better options available year round.
A- pours a murky golden color with a thin head with almost no lacing.
S-musty? Pine and resin. Pineapple and gasoline. A mix of things that do not mix well together.
T-complete pine and resin simcoe bomb. I can't taste anything else.
M-for what it's worth this is a smooth beer. Easy going down, creamy and drinkable.
O-I am glad to have tried this but I guess I was expecting something a little better. The flavor was just nothing unique. If you are going to give a beer so much hype and it's own website it needs to deliver something unique. This reminded me of a slightly more piney weyerbacher double simcoe. 806 charactersbeerhan, Oct 13, 2012
4.04/5  rDev -8.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I gather this is the second release of the Enjoy By series. A set of beers specifically designed to be enjoyed within a month of production. I say 'set' and 'series' but the beers are all produced with the same recipe, as best as I can tell the only difference being the production date and the markets into which they are released. This is done to add a level of control over the distribution time-frame that is usually not as closely tended to. The reason for all of this attention to detail is the beer is heavily hopped in the first place and burst hopped in the second.
'What is Burst hopping' you say? Well it is the brewing practice of adding a large quantity of hops very late in the boil in order to accentuate the aromas and flavors present within the little luplin carriers. Instead of having hops at the beginning of the boil, say 60 to 90 minutes from the end, you add hops only near the last part of the boil, closer to 15 minutes before the finish, and then at the flame-out and whirlpool stages. This technique accentuates the flavors and aromas of the hops used while deriving bitterness at slightly lower levels. Stone combats this drop-off in overall bitterness by using a Super-Galena extract during the early stages of the boil.
Enough about the brewing and distribution, how about the beer? It pours (into my belled beer glass) A light gold and has a light-tan head that is not so thick as to belie a extra helping of proteins, which dissipates rather more quickly that I had hoped and leaves little lacing. 
The nose is big and complex and weighed-down with alcohol. There is a bit of melon-stink (I don't really like most melon), some really-bright citrus, brown-spices like nutmeg and allspice, and maybe a hint of bubblegum. There is more but I will revisit to get into the depths. It has a freaky-big nose, and I like it.
Tastes are well-balanced bitter and sweet with a little tangy hint. The bitterness is not lacking and the sweetness is not lingering. There is a bit of dried grass that presents as I taste this ale. I notice now it is in the nose as much as the flavor but the nose is so bright and fruity that it was obscured before. 
Mouthfeel is medium and the finish is a lingering, but not sweet, hop experience. It is not quite dry but attenuation is high enough not to leave a cloying experience in its wake.
There are definitely new sensations to be had in the nose, and the flavor is likewise deep and novel. This is a great beer for so many reasons: flavor, aroma, technique, and attention payed to distribution. I liked the 10 Anniversary Ruination better on a pure flavor/experiential basis but this is a great idea with so much potential that is cannot be overlooked as a harbinger of greatness-to-be (not that Stone has anything to prove, just that they have more to do).
There is a lot of beer in this beer, and that is a good thing. Flavors and aromas are abound.

Appearance - Light tan/golden yellow with a white 1/2 foamy head , nice sticky lacing.
Smell - Strong hops, very floral, pineapple, mango, lemon, orange, grapefruit, some dry hops mixed with cascade and cenntenial. Light malts, and some yeasty sweet sugar aroma at the end.
Taste - Very fresh piney hops at first sip. Loads of fruity greatness mixed with some spices and alcohol The cascade/pine flavor gives it that ruinination flavor There are some bitterness from the dry hops, and alot of citric flavor from the cenntenial and whatever hybrid hop combo they are using. Alcohol adds warmth in each sip, and yeasts add sweetness to mix with the fruity hops and counter the bitterness. 
Mouthfeel - Hops are strong, piney and bitter, nails tounge, drys it, bitters it then coats palate with hops, sugars and some light caramel malts. The finish is dry, bitter and warm.
Overall - Nice idea, great to know im drinking a very fresh beer. Loads of hops, nice balance of sweetness and bitter. From first drink along with the whole drink fresh as possible marketing that this beer has, makes me feel like this is a pliny clone. Its simular in flavor being so piney, though different still. Tasty and glad i scored a bottle, would like to try next batch to see if its the same beer or not. If you can locate this buy for sure. 1,384 characterswvsabbath, Oct 13, 2012

3.34/5  rDev -24.1%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Enjoy By 11.09.12. Poured in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass for sexiness. 
APPEARANCE
This is what those in the advertising business call "Sex Appeal". This beer just looks good. Crystal clear, yellow-orange-amber in color, resting under a slightly off-white head... Yeah, this is the kind of beer that makes mouths water. I love the look of a good IPA, and this beer has got that look. If this beer was a female, I would try my best to "holla". If this beer was a painting in an art gallery, I would stare at it intensely and occasionally nod my head so everyone around me knew how much I knew about art or whatever. If this beer was a Big Mac, it would be the one in the picture and not the one you get when you order it. If this beer was a... Ok, you get my point. 
SMELL
There are definitely some New Zealand hops in the nose. Notes of grapes, flowers, mango, citrus, earthiness, and a smidge of everyone's favorite "cat pee" fill my nostrils. There is a deep, dank smell that reminds me of a quaint but "lived-in" basement which adds a bit of charm without being unpleasant. There's even a bit of hop spice aroma to even things out. There is a good amount of sweet malt, but there's no mistaking it - this beer is all about the hops. 
TASTE
Follows the nose very closely. Once again, the first thing I notice is the deep, dank, resiny hop character. There is a bit more pine on the tongue than on the nose, which at first I feared would be the dominating character. As I sip, however, more of the citrus and tropical fruit comes out. The New Zealand hops make another appearance and bring some earthy grape notes with them. As far as bitterness goes, this beer is on the medium side. Sure, it's bitter, but it's not a tongue splitter (I rhymed!). There is almost no alcohol flavor whatsoever. This beer has a ridiculous amount of hop character, and there is a slight muddling of flavors which is a tad disappointing. Overall, this beer is pretty tasty but nothing I'll be craving.
MOUTHFEEL
The mouthfeel really is one of the highlights of this beer. The carbonation and body are both medium, and considering the ABV this beer is not a struggle to drink. The beer coats the mouth with hop resin - the kind that kind of makes you smack your tongue for no explicable reason. 
OVERALL
You may have noticed that a word I didn't use in this review was "bright". If you did notice this, I would say "Wow, you were really expecting me to say that word!". Anyway, many IPAs have a bright, refreshing crispness that fellas like me go nuts over. This beer, however, has a somewhat muddled flavor that makes me feel like it's more of an English IPA than an American IPA, which is crazy talk considering all the American hop flavors. That's not to say this beer is bad, because it's not at all! It's really an excellently balanced IPA, and it drinks more like 6% than 9.4% ABV. That being said, I'm drinking this beer as fresh as possible and it still has a layer of "meh". Is it worth buying? Yes, absolutely! Is it the IPA to end all IPAs? Not this time. Don't feel too bad if you missed out on this one (or if you drank it on 11.10.12 or something).

M: Easy drinking, light-medium bodied, nice and subtle carbonation, the 9.4% alcohol is hidden very well. Full of intense fresh hop flavor, yet smooth.
O: Definitely the best fresh hop IPA I have tasted to date and its a double IPA taboot.

A-The beer was a clear and had a pretty copper/amber color. I got about one finger of just off-white head that departed quickly. Not very much lacing.
S-Huge aroma here. Lots of pine, sage, and alcohol spice. There was also some lemon and a touch of floral tropical fruit. I also picked up an earthy, oniony note.
T-I picked up some caramel and butterscotch flavors at first, but after that, the taste mostly followed the smell in flavor (pine, lemon, and a resiny touch of onion) and volume (huge flavors here). Not as tropical as some, with a bitter hoppiness and a nice powerful finish. 
M-Not hugely carbonated, but there was a nice balanced feel here.
O-I wouldn't call this my favorite IIPA because I would have preferred a little more balance in the flavor profile, but if you want a big, bold, brash (i.e., Stone-type) beer, look no further. 908 charactersspoony, Oct 10, 2012

Citrus, lemon, pine hop aroma; gently sweet. Beautiful combination of tastes initially: light caramel and crystal malt flavors with a gentle hop bitterness; bitterness comes on more strongly at the finish and lingers along with a creeping alcohol heat. Clean dry finish. Medium body with a soft, light sugary feel.
Powerful and tasty with a fair complexity and generally good balance of flavors and scents. I wonder how this one might age despite Stone's claim to have brewed it "not to last". Indeed! I think it would still be a great beer if tried long past its bold 'enjoy by' date on the bottle...Overall 4.0/5.

The profile is extremely hop driven with aromas of citrus, hops, pine resin and lots of florida oranges. Good depth as well.
Full bodied with a really smooth feel. There is good depth with flavors of florida oranges, hops, and lots of pine resin notes as well.
This is a really good DIPA. The notes are big and it is a big beer. 401 charactersKDawg, Sep 24, 2012

2.5/5  rDev -43.2%look: 4 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Poured from a 22oz bottle on the "enjoy by" date of 9/21/12. 
A - The pour looks great...a beautiful light copper color with a nice white head. 
S - Not very good. Im getting some band-aid or medicine or onion smell that is not appealing AT ALL. I cant quite place what the smell is, but I dont like it. 
T- Similar to the smell. The best part is the finish, which tastes like actual hops instead of poison. Getting some biscuit in there as well. 
M - The best part of the beer. The tingle from the carbonation reminds me that I am, in actuality, drinking beer and not liquid Tylenol.
O - I was really looking forward to this and it is a huge letdown. I still have half a glass and the other half of the bomber to drink and I dont really even want it. Maybe they use Summit hops and Im getting the "oniony" thing that many people swear by? I dunno if that is the case because I really like Gubna, which supposedly is an "Onion bomb". Or maybe Stone made a mistake and should have called it "Enjoy by 9/20/12 ".... 1,018 charactersmychalg9, Sep 22, 2012
4.99/5  rDev +13.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Have had the 9/21/12, 11/09/2012, 12/21/2012, 4/1/2013 and 5/17/2013 iterations of this world-class DIPA, and they've all been near-flawless. While , from what I understand, the recipe has stayed mostly the same (though I'm sure some tweaks have been made with each batch), I would call out the 9/21, 12/21 and 5/17 as standouts. 
Appearance: If "DIPA orange" had a dictionary entry; Enjoy By would accompany the photo.
Smell: A citrus, pine, grapefruit, mango, lemon, orange explosion.
Taste: The quintessential west-coast double IPA. While buying bombers is fun, if you see this on tap, order as many rounds as you can imbibe. Taste is a citrus assault with a perfect, west-coast dry finish. The malt backbone is there, but there's little sugar to be had here -- the 11(!) hop varietals are the star of the show. 
Mouthfeel: Quite drinkable for a 9.4% DIPA, medium-body.
Overall: The “Enjoy By” conceit is not only a genius marketing plan — “this beer is brewed not to last!” as if it will turn into toxic sludge on its past-due date — it’s also a clarion call and challenge to brewers, distributors and retailers alike. To other brewers, the challenge is simple: let’s see you brew a beer this good, and also ensure that your enjoy by date is easy to find and not hidden behind a seemingly random code of letters and numbers or not present at all. To distributors and retailers it’s a little more difficult: do you have the stones (no pun intended) to do the right thing and remove a product from the shelves after its enjoy-by date and eat the loss? Given this beer’s extraordinary popularity, I can’t imagine there have been any bombers left come the sell-by date, although as Stone continues to perfect the logistics of this experiment it seems like a reasonable assumption that the beer will eventually become available more regularly and distributed in more locations, perhaps presenting a tough decision for shopkeepers in the near future. Either way, continuing to educate the consumer on the importance of beer freshness by bringing the issue front-and-center should only further enhance craft drinkers’ overall enjoyment
To wrap-up this already long-winded review, Stone is of course one of the world's foremost brewers of IPAs across the board in any style, and this beer fulfills the promise of the freshest, most enjoyable DIPA you could hope for and then some. A truly phenomenal, world-class beer. 2,444 charactersLarryK, Sep 20, 2012

A- Deep golden color, bright and slightly hazy at once. A fluffy white head, 1.5 finger, sticky lacing developes as the head fades to a film.
S- Oh, yeah..a citrus stand with flowery accents make up the aroma here. There's no mistaking some kind of earthy bitter green back there...scallion, collards, escarole???? 
T- Stong citrus, an unripened grapefruit that has but a touch of malt sweetness. Again, there's some bitter greenery back there, seemingly different than hop flavors. Anise, too, maybe?
M-Medium body and carbonation. Sticky and tart, a drop of oil as well. I knew I sipped this beer long after it "went down the right pipe". Smooth as silk at ABV 9.4% and well balanced.

Pours a slightly hazy dark golden.. nice white head and lacing.
The brew is a tropical fruitbowl... but has some other hoppiness going on.. Summit? a bit of onion like aromas that I would never had picked out had Inflatablechair (Fucking SAM!!) NOT made the suggestion... Smells fantastic.
Flavor is about what you would expect.. very hoppy... finishes remarkably dry given the ABV... just enough maltiness mid palate to really deliver the hops.
Body and carbonation are as expected.... Drinkability is great... I really enjoyed it.

A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a short dense off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is a very nice blend of fruity citrus, piney hops and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts with a burst of fruity citrus and caramel sweetness that is quickly followed by a strong floral hops bitterness. The malt character is hearty and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent hop bomb to drink for a long time. 784 charactersTheManiacalOne, Sep 16, 2012

I really looked forward to getting this one. Smell was amazing , is this really a Stone beer? If I didn't know better I would have thought I was drinking an Alpine.
Tasted very good, very Alpine like.
Hats off to Stone for a great beer and also for fighting the fight of freshness. Awesome marketing campaign. Other brewers , take note, your beer may be equal to or better than Stone, but I will reach for Stone every time because of the enjoy by date and the commitment for IPA lovers to get fresh beer. 609 charactersjrnyc, Sep 15, 2012

Pours a light, clear golden amber with a finger of white head that fades to a thin collar and dots of lace.

Flavor is more bitter than expected, strong malty body, sugar and chewy with resiny citrus bitterness in the finish. Medium thick and chewy, well carbonated.

Some things that come to mind: sweet grapefruit, tangerine, honeysuckle, peach, pineapple, papaya, kiwi, lavender. Very nice. Little to no malt contribution. Maybe just a bit of simple sweetness. The taste is chock full of hop flavor, and the bitterness is tuned just right for my palate. There's no bland bitterness to this beer. It's always complex and delicate hop flavor. Absolutely wonderful taste. Mouthfeel is light. Gentle carbonation. Long-lasting hop finish. No booziness. This is an excellent DIPA. I tried the first version and was less impressed, but perhaps, I didn't have a big enough pour or something. This beer is tasty. If you like hops, I can't recommend it highly enough.

Aromas are all hops here; citrus, pine, pineapple. Then I get the spicy, white grape, kiwi and stone fruit qualities. Finally there are some hints of onion and chive. This is truely a fruit salad of juicy hops. Malt is pretty much impossible to detect beyond a hint of pale malt sweetenss.
The tastes fall a little short from the pop that the aroma had. The hops flavors all listed above (tropical fruits, citrus and a bit of dankness) are there in some form but clash and seem to form a melange of green hop flavors. The pale malt sweetness is there to balance the abundance of hop flavor that is packed into the hop monster.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The finish is intially dry and lightly bitter but the resinous bitterness increases more as more as you work through the bottle.
Overall I really like this idea of offering freshly hopped beers with a drink by date and I really enjoyed this beer but the inflated price tag (due to the cost of bottling/shipping so fast, huge late hop bill and small hype due to limited distribution) make this a bit under-whelming. While no means a bad beer, it's actually a great beer, it's by no means the be all and end all of DIPAs. 1,318 charactersclaspada, Sep 05, 2012

I get a big, juicy aroma from 10-12 inches away. The head settles within a minute or two to a light covering, and after a few sips to a light ring, leaving the beer looking a bit too quiet, or too much like apple juice.
I smell grapefruit, green apple, mango, pineapple; subtle floral, sweet, and spice notes. Definitely mango and tropical fruit. 
Mild carbonation, very smooth feel in the mouth, medium body with lingering tingle of bitterness. The hops flavor is not as intensely fruity as it is on the nose; rather more spice and green flavors emerge with the bitterness. The beer has marvelous balance and perfect harmony of flavors. A nice peak of malty sweetness crests just as the hop bitterness begins to settle in, and they both exit smoothly and slowly, allowing each sip to be fully enjoyed for a full, happy moment. 922 charactersbeerpadawan, Sep 04, 2012

Head dissipates to a film of foam on the surface after a few minutes, leaving a lot of sticky lacing. Some carbonation visible, rising quickly, and allows for two fingers of head to be swirled up easily.
Nose is grapefruit, orange, papaya, dank herbal hops and some bright fresh pine. Really fragrant and fresh smelling. Unlike a lot of Stone IPA's, I don't notice much malt in the nose, which I think is a good thing as the hops really explode out of this one. 
Tropical fruits hit the tongue, mango and papaya, citrus in orange and grapefruit, then a lightly bitter hit of dank herbal and pine hop flavors. Just a touch of biscuit and caramel malt sweetness, but not as heavy handed as Stone's other IPA's. Finish is dry with long lingering sweeter tropical and citrus hop flavors and only moderately bitter. Really delicious beer.
Considering this is 9.4% abv, the light to medium body and clean carbonation is really surprising. Alcohol is completely hidden, with your taste buds getting all of the nice hop flavors. Really happy to have a had a chance to grab a bottle of this to get sent up here to Northern California and hoping the next batch will officially get sent here. 1,288 charactersnataku00, Sep 03, 2012

Appearance: Pour produced at least a two finger fluffy white head that settled down to a small head that never went away. Color is a bright golden to dingy orange.
Smell: Tons of floral and citrus aromas. Grapefruit rind, orange peel, pineapple and mango blend together with resiny, piney hops. Am also picking up on some caramel sweetness, too.
Taste: Up front the citrus notes dominate. I am tasting mango, pineapple, and some orange. This one is very fruit forward to me for a DIPA. There is some floral and grassy notes in the middle but does not dominate and the hoppiness is evident but very well integrated. Bitterness is present but so is some sweetness that evens everything out.
Mouthfeel: Surprisingly creamy to me?! The bitterness is there but not to the point that it makes me pucker. Carbonation is moderate and this beer has that drying affect on the palate.
Overall: One great DIPA! The entire experience was enjoyable because no one aspect dominated and it is bitter and hoppy while being sweet and tropical at the same time. Simply one of the best, IMO. 1,094 characterssleuthdog, Sep 02, 2012

A - Very light colored, clear DIPA. Solid 2 and 1/2' head, excellent lacing throughout, active in the glass and a small head remains throughout. Near perfect.
S - Pine resin, tons of white grapes and lemon citrus.
T - Not as good as the nose suggests but still good. All the same aspects I mentioned in the nose, but this is all about a white grape, almost dry white wine hoppy flavor. Very unique. Never had a DIPA flavor profile like this. Solid.
M - a little prickly finish from the hops, and not as bitter as it is dry. Malt almost non-existent. Really, this beer is like a white grape DIPA finishing as a dry white wine would. Not very sticky and resinous as you'd expect from a West Coast DIPA or a big Stone IPA.
O - Very unique brew. Mind-blowing? Not for me but very good. I can easily see how this unique profile could be mind-blowing for others though. I can appreciate this beer for sure.
Suggested. It's a hope lover's unique experience of what can also be done with hops... 1,019 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Sep 02, 2012

T - Oily with lots of tropical fruit rind: pineapple, grapefruit, mangos, and spicy resins. Caramel malt is present but very light and subdued. The spicy character comes through with some onion zest, and the alcohol level is very well hidden. A little bit of grassiness is also mixed in with the assertive spice. 
M - Medium body, smooth texture, and coats the mouth with a spicy layer of rindy resins.
O - As a lover of IPA's, this is a phenominal beer that once again shows Stone is more than capable of brewing great IPA's. The entire concept of this project is a great idea and I hope they continue brewing this particular beer or other big IPA's with the same idea. great job, Stone! 974 charactersjzeilinger, Sep 01, 2012

A: Pours a mostly clear, golden straw color. There is a just off-white head of one finger with fades to a thin cap with some larger bubbles. Nice curtains of lace.
S: A lot of West Coast style hops. Tropical flavors, mango, pineapple, citrus and grapefruit meld with resinous, earthy pine.
T: The tropical fruit flavors are here but more subdued than in the aroma. Just some citrus really. Fairly bitter with grass cutting, pine and herbal hop notes. A small amount of caramel provides a semblance of balance, but it is no match for the hops. Bitter hops and alcohol comprise the long, lingering finish.
M: Medium bodied and slightly oily. Alcohol heat is present along with mild but effervescent carbonation.
O: A great IPA, very much West-Coast style. Love the concept of the enjoy-by thing. 842 charactersWankelEngine, Aug 31, 2012

A: Pale orange with a neat clarity shows a light and lazy rise of spacious effervesce. The head is foamy, 2 fingers high, with a generous stay of execution. Splotchy random patches of lace adhere to the vessel. 
S: The nose is intriquing and complex with shows of sweet tropical fruitiness mixing with fresh wet citrus. Oranges, pineapple, mangos are the most notable with a complimentary hint of fresh coconut juice. Fresh pine hops come through along with fresh grapefruit juice mixing with some sweet caramel. A good amount of aromatic appeal and delivery makes this one a repeat sniffer. 
T: Flowery citrus and grapefruit hoppiness is wet, fresh and generous on the first sip. Warming citrus mixes with sweet caramel, piney-oranges with a flowery bitterness that lingers nicely after the swallow. While the tropcial fruitiness dominated the nose, it is the fresh wet citrusy hops that is the showcase for flavor. Light indications of starfruit, toasted coconut and some fresh wet grassiness rounds things out in an otherwise nicely balanced, harmonous flavor that was tropical, grassy, with some light fruity hints. 
M: Body is medium, warming citrus flowers are gently bittering with a quiet carbonation factor. 
O: Overall a great aromatic appeal and equally well flavor shows a soothing complexity of tropcial, citrusy, and grassy nature that blends oh so well together. Kudos for Stone for getting this straight out from the bright tank to our watering palates here on the east coast. The abv of 9.0% is complimentary and never inteferes with the flavor or aroma like most bigger beers do. The aromatic hops and flavor is well refined and focused, which certainly earns high regards here. 1,742 charactersbeerthulhu, Aug 31, 2012

Multiple pours into a Ruination pint.
*I will start by stating the hop aromas were impressive and overwhelmed the entire fill station. 
A: Look is a pale golden ale with good clarity and a firm stack of near white head. Nice retention noted. Lacing leaves just a sticky mess and dries up to a light etching along the glass.
S: A ménage of fruity tropicals. Peach, mango, white grape, gooseberry, and a hint of pine. No real malt character detectable in the nose. The aroma is stellar and just doesn’t quit.
T: Fruity as all get out! Gooseberry is pronounced with a nice mango and pineapple tropic mix. White grape is a bit more subdued in the flavor. I get a bit of danky floral and grass notes with a suggestion of green onion towards the end. Very hoppy albeit overall bitterness is moderate with little to no astringency. Peaks towards the back of the palate. Malt is secondary and imparts a dry saltine cracker base with just a touch of caramel sweetness to carry through the hops. Alcohol is quite well hidden. This tastes remarkably similar to some of my latest homebrewed IPA’s which is just the way I like ‘em. Seems to have a good influence of Citra and Nelson with some supporting characters most likely. 
M: Feel is remarkably light and smooth in texture with a big drying effect and crisp finish. Hop oils linger about wanting for the next sip.
D: Hats off to the Stone Pilot crew. One of the most satisfying growler purchases in a long time. Probably my favorite Stone offering thus far. 
A must try. 1,572 charactersNugganooch, Aug 30, 2012

I tasted this at work today, so I should have reviewed this first while it is still somewhat fresh in my mind.
A- An inviting golden tone to it, nice head cap and very decent lacing.
S- I always enjoy the smell of Stones! Something about that Escondido water! This was a very gripping piney/grassy scent with a nice citrus backbone... Grapefruit peels scream out to ya when you are nose deep in this and that citrus hop kick just makes you want to bury yourself in this outstanding DIPA.
T- Again the grapefruit peel, a lick of mandarin and very grassy/piny taste to it. A semi-dark malty flavor grabs ya in the beginning and drops you in the end, the taste is magnificent and hangs around leaving you wanting more, more and more. The bitterness is perfect. I can't describe it any other way since I am lacking the proper vocabulary to how content this beer left me.
MF- Nice medium body, great carbonation and wet to the lips then dry to the finish feel. You can really dig into this one. Scrumptious!
O- Stone never disappoints me. We have been selling out at work and have been very limited on this beer. I am very lucky and consider myself fortunate to try this fine crafted ale. GET YOUR HANDS ON IT IMMEDIATELY if you can. Price shouldn't be an issue here, just try it, you will not be disappointed. 1,347 charactersBlackwolf, Aug 29, 2012

A - Big white foam settles to a collar and a few wisps on top, leaving plenty of splotchy lacework. Transparent golden body.
S - Super dank, with tons of tropical fruits, white grapes, as well as a hint of onion and chive. A tad reminiscent of Alpine Toronado 25th thanks to the hefty dose of Nelson Sauvin hops, but with some mild herbal notes as well thanks to the Galaxy hops. Malt character is present but understated.
T - The taste is a bit more balanced, with sweet sugary malts supporting juicy tropical fruits, a touch of citrus, and a bit of spicy chive and dankness. Moderate-to-lower bitterness level.
M - Medium-full body, moderate carbonation, dry finish, and super juicy and resinous. Alcohol is also extremely well-hidden.
D - Wow! After a disappointing 16th Anniversary beer, Stone really stepped up their game here. Great hop profile and extremely drinkable for the ABV. I hope they make this again in the future. 996 charactersMasterSki, Aug 29, 2012

A: Pours a crystal clear medium golden yellow in color with some light to moderate amounts of visible carbonation. The beer has a finger tall off-white head that reduces to a thick film covering the entire surface if the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Strong aromas of pine hops with lighter amounts of citrus and grapefruit hops. Very light hints of alcohol and some caramel malt sweetness.
T: There is light caramel malt body for this beer that imparts a light amount of sweetness. There is a strong flavor of pine hops with some more moderate amounts of citrus and grapefruit hops. There is a moderate amount of bitterness that lingers. Very delicious.
M:Medium bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Slightly chewy.
O: Very enjoyable and easy to drink. This is probably the best beer that I have ever had from Stone and glad that I live in one of the three states getting this beer.

Stone Brewing co.
Escondido, Ca
Clear orange with a small ring of off-white, soapy head, eventually leaving irregular lines and webs of lace down the glass. Very pretty, as are all of Stone's IPAs.
Well balanced, but bold aroma of juicy citrus fruits, some earth (onion? but very mild), and a little bit of pine. A strong, obviously fresh aroma.
The flavor is similar to the aroma, as it's marvelously flavorful while being still balanced, refreshing, and drinkable. Big notes of citrus and white fruits combine with mild pine and moderate bitterness complete this IPA.
Medium body with crisp, high carbonation. Incredibly drinkable. Thirst quenching. 
A very nice, obviously fresh IPA. 699 charactersehammond1, Aug 27, 2012

A - Clear filtered IPA with darker orange hue. Fair head is slighty off white and has oddly large bubbles? 
S - People could smell this from across the house. Very nice piney hop smell, some grapefruit and citrus present but not as much as I would expect. A little booze in the nose too. 
T - Strong piney bitterness per the nose it opens up in the back of the palate with quite a depth of hoppy flavors. Most IPA's don't have this many types of hops, though I think the complexity takes away from the beer a little. Somewhat ruinous in that your palate just can't detect the hops on your 3rd sip like they can on the first.
M - Somewhat thin given the high booze to malty ratio. Goes down smooth but I'd like just a little more heft to it. 
O - Somewhat disappointing overall actually. Nice and fresh yes, but nothing that is instantly seared in your brain like an Alpine Duet or BP Sculpin or Surly Furious. Albeit I am spoiled by fresh So Cal IPA's all day, everyday but this wasn't something I would rush out to buy again. Its basically Ruination with a different hop bill late in the boil. 
Still, I gotta hand it to Stone for the concept here. The majors all tout bottle dating and such, but its high time attention is brought to skunky craft brews that have sat on store shelves too long... 1,427 charactersDijeriduster, Aug 27, 2012

A - Pours a beautiful golden orange with a 2 finger off white head.
S - (This was my favorite part) A HUGE waft of piney and citrusy hops hit you right away. There is a little bit of a biscuty malt smell, but mainly just lots of fresh hops. I always thought that the emphasis on drinking extremely fresh west coast IPAs was a little over exaggerated, but this is pretty awesome.
T - There is a huge hop presence and plenty of grapefruit and pine flavored hops hit you as soon as you take a sip, but I was shocked that this didn't really taste very bitter at all - considering how "big" of an IPA it was. IT went down dangerously easy and had an IPA flavor that I have never really experiences before.
M - Mouth feel was pretty typical for a west coast IPA. Medium body, pretty heavy carbonation.
O - I wish this beer was more widely distributed, but if you see it in your store... tackle it. Especially at $6.99 a bomber... 1,116 characterscnbrown313, Aug 27, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle being enjoyed nine days out from bottling. It was poured into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.
Stone's Enjoy By IPA pours a translucent tangerine, with some goldenrod highlights. Two plus fingers of frothy white foam cap the beer and show some decent staying power. Lacing reveals the head to be fairly sticky, but it doesn't absolutely coat the glass like the best do. The nose is absolutely fantastic. Waves of mango, pineapple, and gooseberry come through, with just a little bit of grapefruit thrown in for good measure. If the aroma was just a bit more pungent, it would be perfect. Each sip greets my palate with just a little bit of malt, some light caramel and bready notes. The hops are a little more unbalanced here, with lots of mango and white wine grape here, and just a little bit of the more citrusy flavors. The Nelson Sauvin hops actually get just a little overbearing at times. Still though, the flavor here is one instance where I wish scoring was in quarter point increments so I could give this beer its full due. The mouthfeel is superb, highlighted by an unbelievably light and lean body. I've had 6-7%ABV IPAs with heavier/chewier bodies than the one I find here. The carbonation, while lively, could stand to pop a little more. I love the idea behind Stone's Enjoy By IIPA, and this super fresh hop bomb lives up to its promise and then some. I'm just glad NJ was one of the markets to receive it. 1,430 charactersaxeman9182, Aug 27, 2012
4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer pours a clean, golden color with a thick, modest-in-size head. A steady stream of carbonation is visible pouring from the bottom of my tulip glass. Pretty standard for a DIPA... nothing to hint at any distinctive qualities.
The smell is where this beer starts to get interesting: awesomely complex for an IPA. Usually, even in "sweeter" IPAs, the hops really dominate the smell but in Stone's Enjoy By, there is a wonderful mix of citrus flavors fused with the Hops. Scent is thick; I can tell that this is going to be an intense beer flavor-wise. Easily one of the best smelling beers I've ever had.
The taste is complex. Right off the bat I get fruity notes; first sweet... some lemon, mango mix then bitter fruits... BIG grapefruit taste accompanied by orange rind. It is on the back end of the sip that you get hit by the hop flavor. While this doesn't pack the hop punch of Ruination (also by Stone), the sheer amount of juiciness and flavor in this beer MORE than makes up for the decreased bitterness (which I happen to love).
This beer continues to stand out in the mouthfeel. The thickness; dare I say "chewiness" reminds me of something like Founder's Double Trouble (to be reviewed in the near future) and that is a very, very good thing. Great fullness in the body of this beer which compliments the fruitiness that is on showcase. Maybe not the most drinkable beer in the world but beers this flavorful rarely are. A good amount of carbonation rounds this beer out.
For $6.99, I thought this was a great deal but maybe that was in light of my [unfortunate] trend towards buying more expensive bottles of beer lately. Bottom line, was easily one of the best beers I've ever tried and possibly my favorite. 1,731 charactersaquaphiliac, Aug 27, 2012

Bomber poured into a globe glass after a bit of warming from fridge temp. Pours a clear golden with a nice boil of carbonation from the base. Offers a nearly white cap which shows decent retention and light lace.
Nose of citrus, pine and a hint of shallot/onion but subtle in that regard. Not picking up on the tropical notes at all. Lightly bitter and subtle as the bitterness lingers through the finish.
Flavor tends back towards the citric hops in the mix. Quite light in the malt substance yet the ABV is deceptive nonetheless. Good taste but not earth shattering by any means. Decent feel with a moderate linger of the light malts and a good spritzy carb. level. Overal a bit mixed. Good but not worth the media nor the price. 1,037 charactersHalfFull, Aug 26, 2012

Appearance - Poured nearly 2 fingers of tight creamy eggshell head, body is a gorgeous glowing and just slightly hazy light yellow orange amber. Gorgeous intricate webbed lacing coats the glass at the end of the session.
Smell - OMG!! Huge grapefruit, pine, light tropical fruits, orange peel, rich oily hops!
Taste - Starts with huge oily grapefruit peels and pine, bright green sticky hops, green grass, floral hops, lavender...in the back and into the finish there are huge herbal hops, fresh cut green onion, chive, and even a hint of basil, finish is more of the same with dried grapefruit pith - just incredible!
Mouthfeel - Actully on the lighter side of medium, this feels light and bright with an almost silky smoothness in the mouth - carb is nearly medium but not harsh, carb begins smooth but then has some bright, nearly sharp edges near the back of the tongue. Finish is on the dry side with a few poine needles and hop oils in the mouth corners.
Overall - The complexity of hops here is beyond description - huge citrus flavors, but not sweet at all - also alot of floral and herbal hop flavors here too. DON'T let my mention of lavender, onion, chive and basil throw you - you have to taste this to believe it - it's like a perfect symphony of super fresh pungent bright green hop nuances, especially citrus, floral and herbal - and there is a slight sweetness here, but its seems completely natural, the level you might get from a slightly under-ripe yellow grapefruit. This is what hopslam would taste like without the honey. Your mouth will be alive after each sip, I'm going to purchase alot more of this! 1,676 charactersblackcompg, Aug 26, 2012

Pours a hazy golden orange color with tangerine edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. 
Dank and über fresh floral hop aroma with earthy pine needle and spicy, grassy hop notes countered by citrus and tropical fruit notes.  Really tropical with mango, papaya and pineapple along with orange peel, tangerine and curaçao.  Pale malts underneath with biscuit and grainy graham cracker. 
Chewy full body that's much heavier than anticipated.   Slightly hurts the drinkability.  Dry bitterness up front with dank, sticky hops that linger over sweeter notes and pale malt into a slightly dry finish.  Spicy hops, grass and earthy pine are slightly floral but countered by sweet fruit notes.  Not as tropical as nose suggests with some grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel.  Pale malt backbone is a bit stronger than I prefer with strong biscuit and graham cracker graininess toward the finish.  Also, there's a strong perfumy booziness that gives off some distracting sweetness toward finish.m ABV is decently masked for 9.4 but it's still a bit strong for me taking away from the hops.  Overall, this beer has some nice hop flavors but needs more tropical/citrus fruit sweetness, a  lighter body and less booze.  Decent but nothing out of the ordinary. 1,411 characterscorby112, Aug 26, 2012

A solid DIPA from Stone, but certainly not heads or tails above others, and tends to be more of the same and is a bit overly sweet. Personally, I prefer a finish that is a bit drier, and the finish on this brew is about as sweet and fruity as one can find, with the usual grapefruit rind bitterness. Frankly this brew is a bit unbalanced, and those that prefer sweeter characteristics in their DIPA's will certainly be all over this one. 951 characterschanokokoro, Aug 25, 2012

S: Piney, hoppy with a hint of tropical fruit.
T: Very hop forward, bit of malt, but the alcohol is well hidden.
M: Medium body, not much carb feel, dries quickly leaving a light stickiness.
O: Very tasty, easy to drink despite being the ABV. I'm interested to see what Stone does next with what I can only assume will become a regular thing. 429 charactersControlledBurn, Aug 25, 2012

S: Citrus, pine with a good shot of pineapple, the Nelson hops are apparent.
T: Big juicy hop flavour, unique tasting. Pineapple, kiwi, white grape. Mild malt flavour, something to certainly be drunk fresh.
M: Medium-bodied, creamy at times, resiny, crisp carbonation.
O: Quite an enjoyable DIPA; it didn't blow me away, though I was taken aback on the first sip. I haven't seen any bottles around here yet, hopefully they'll show up, so I have something to compare with the on-tap version. 576 charactersHalcyondays, Aug 25, 2012

Inhale deeply right after a fresh pour, and the hops will blow you away. Like a freshly-mowed field of hops. "Is there anything in here *besides* hops?" you'll wonder...
A touch more carbonation than I like, but I got over it.
The 9.4% really sneaks up on you...the alcohol is well concealed. I'm still not sure where it was hiding.
Overall, great beer, well worth the hunt. I'll be sad to see it disappear. 509 charactersTrackZero, Aug 25, 2012

Appearance: Brilliantly clear pale gold body capped by a big frothy head.
Smell: Holy nelson and galaxy. The NZ hops really shine here, and they smell fantastic. There's a ton of tropical fruit here, along with gooseberry, cat piss, onion and honeysuckle. It's faintly sweet, but malt is non-existent.
Palate: Spicy, fruity, oniony. A ton of floral and gooseberry hop notes. Bit of white grape and cardamom. The body is medium-light and booze is completely hidden. The finish has a clean, pleasant bitterness.
Overall: Best Stone beer ever? Probably. This is a great use of nelson. 600 characterslargadeer, Aug 25, 2012

Anyway... poured into glass, crystal clear brilliant gold appearance with soapy white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is pungent and fresh with tropical hoppy goodness along with some pine, sap, orange, apricot, and grass. Taste starts with moderate tropical fruits and caramel sweetness, followed by piny bitterness along with and herbal and syrupy component. No booziness here, nice balance. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy with medium carbonation. Overall, one of the better IPAs I have had from Stone. Super fresh and super delicious. 671 charactershomebrew311, Aug 25, 2012

Enjoy By 9.21.12
Huge plume of floral hops at the first crack of the cap, (4.5) the ale pours a brilliant golden copper with amazing clarity, frothy white head holds good retention and leaves great lacing on the glass. (4.5) Aromas are bold floral hops, grapefruit zest and pith, vegetative, pungent, biscuit. (4) Tastes are fresh, resiny, piny hops, pungent grapefruit, herbal, earthy, biscuity, some tropical notes, faint caramel, faint onion? (3) Mouth-feel is rather thin, moderate carbonation, resiny feel, finishes dry and bitter. Alcohol is non-existent. I couldn't believe it when I saw 9.4% on the bottle after I had drank 3/4 of the bottle! (4)Overall, I was super excited to try this one, especially as fresh as it is. I felt it could have used more of a malt backbone as the hops really stand out, although I know that's what the brewer was going for here. Still very well executed and worth the try - fresh of course.
Enjoy By 12.21.12
Seeing as I seem to have had a different experience with this batch compared to 9.21.12, I figured I'd add this to the review. This one will be abbreviated a bit even though I preferred this batch to the previous. (same recipe?) (4.5) Pours a brilliant amber, excellent clarity, the frothy, ivory, head leaves some lacing on the glass. (5) fresh hoppy floral bouquet of citric hops, pineapple, mango, Citra hops?, grapefruit, caramel malt, pine, did I mention fresh? (4.5) tastes are tropical fruits - juicy pineapple, mango, papaya, grapefruit pith, earthy pine, booze, white pepper, faint creamed honey. (3) Mouth-feel is resiny but smooth, thinner side of medium.
(4.5) Overall, this experience seemed to be better than the last Enjoy By IPA, but if they're the same recipe, then who knows. My palate isn't perfect. 1,959 charactersbarnzy78, Aug 25, 2012

I'm on the final few sips and I hope there is more at my shop tomorrow. I'm not an expert reviewer nor very familiar with DIPA. This is probably my 9th or 10th. I'm not really a big IPA fan...But this DIPA does the trick. Minimal malts, beautiful citrus, floral, and slight tropical fruit from the hops, and a bit of heat coming in but slapped around by the hops. My favorite DIPA and probably Top Five (of 400+) in my young beer drinking career.
Get it while it's fresh! Thanks Stone! 557 charactersSkitzIrish3, Aug 24, 2012

i want to compare this to pliny for some reason - maybe it's because both beers strive on how close to the bottle date you can get your hands on it - plus they both have green labels gloating that you better not age this behemoth.
it's not as pretty as pliny, but its as inviting of an appearance as the best of ipas.
cold, this ipa smells of a mango and orange marmalade version of a fresh pliny - so far very different. closer to RT, this may be the best smelling ipa of all time - this is coming from the guy that singly-handily consumed 6 ruinations on the sole purpose of smelling each freshly cracked bottle...
the taste isn't stone. they must have contracted this beer out - it cant be a stone beer. if it didn't hit me like a 9.4%, i would drink this all day long - in fact i'd take a vacation day just to do so. a bunch of green and orange tropical fruits come to mind, plus a basket of spring flowers take over - not descriptive enough, well too bad because this is what came to mind.
the mouthfeel is spot on - they filtered it and forced carbonated it so it could be as fresh as possible - plus i think bottle conditioning actually deteriorates the natural hop freshness - either way they naturally artificially carbonated this perfectly just so i can see a bottle on date of 081712 and drink it on 082212.
i'm going to spend most of thursday trying to get my hands on more bottles - seeing how i feel like i exhausted most of the stores that are suppose to carry it. great work mitch steele et al. ... 1,630 charactersMatt, Aug 23, 2012

This one was definitely the piney-est and grassiest of the three, and in a good, balanced way. Enjoy By's will always be a solid DIPA option, but I actually enjoyed the Wakatu Showers more, which was more citrusy. 360 charactersRollzroyce21, Aug 23, 2012

Bottle purchased from South Park location after being charged for a piece of glassware I didn't want and wasn't told I was buying. Rad. Snifter.
A: Orange with perfect transparency and two fingers of beige froth that linger for a few minutes, eventually receding in craters, caverns, and chasms. Lots of lacing.
S: Dank marijuana with a dash of onion. Lots of tangerine and orange. Grainy malt lingering beneath with a pretty strong Nelson hop presence, redolent of white grape and gooseberry. Evident honeydew and a little alcohol.
T: Juicy apricot and tangerine with lots of honeydew and cantaloupe. There's a firm Nelson presence with notes of white grape and gooseberry. Bitterness is at a moderate level and devoid of astringency. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Lots of hop flavor without a lot of bitterness. Light malt influence and a faint sweetness that wards off palate fatigue.
M: Lower medium body with upper medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky and dry.
Overall: This is nice. It's not only good but it also breaks away from the typical Stone house character, which I appreciate. Enjoyable and difficult to fault. 1,149 charactersHopHead84, Aug 22, 2012

Nice coloration, tinny amber tone. Good carbonation.
Smells like extremely dank hoppy citrusy goodness. I like very much. Let's do this.
Tastes like it smells. Extremely dank hops dominate, with a few citrus notes in the beginning. I can taste that citra and nelson sauvin goodness that seems to dominate the other hop varieties. Lemon zest and orange dominates midway through the taste, and the hops seem to linger in the background, but are very well kept under wraps until the swallow finishes, and then you can taste that dankiness after. As you drink it, the complexity heightens, and that lemony citrusy goodness comes through until you finish it, never really losing any momentum. Awesome.
Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. Nuff said.
Overall, I thought this would be more of a hop bomb like they advertised, but I certainly wasn't disappointed. Amazing beer by an amazing brewery. The novelty of the whole thing adds a great sexiness to the whole experience. I'm glad I could get more than one bottle of this, and look forward to sharing this with others. Good job, Stone.

4.92/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Stone continues it's roll. This innovative release program rewards those who keep it fresh,and move it quick. After all the videos and how too's I finally get my hands on a fresh specimen today. Having enjoyed, very much I may add, the Ruination Anniversary as a youngster, and thought the 16th was OK I really had no idea what I was about to fall into. This pours a pale copper, the cap is dense, white and recedes rather quickly. My first inclination that I'm into something special is when I bring my tulip to my nose. Seriously, the most intensly aromatic nose I have ever enjoyed from Stone. Very Alpine Nelson meets KRBC Citra nose, totally intoxifying. It just gets better as the flavors fall in line with the nose delivering sweet mango, tangerine, lemon, orange and white pepper notes. There is a beautiful bitter blast from the enormous hop bill, just enough malt to keep it all in balance, remember this is totally a west coast variation, so were talking hops, dry and fruity. The mouth is dry, clean and utterly refreshing, there is absolutely no detection of the 9+ abv lurking underneath the entire package. Gains complexity as it warms and never is hot. This would be Stones biggest seller by a land slide if made available year round. If you can find a fresh bottle now do what you have to, it's that good. 1,322 charactersOTB, Aug 22, 2012

A - Clear and golden in appearance. Huge frothy head, probably because it's the first pour from the keg. The lacing this leaves is fantastic.
S - Mostly pine and citrus. Some tropical fruit. I can definitely smell the Nelson hops they used for dry hopping. No alcohol or malt presence to speak of.
T - Nice level of bitterness. Citrus and pine again dominant in taste. There's a hint of tropical fruit as well. Some peach in there too. Big bitterness on the finish. Supposedly they added all the hops late in the process, but it's definitely still got a lingering bitterness. By the end of my first pour I had a long lingering bitterness. Great stuff. Making my mouth water, which not many IPAs can do at this point. This is truly a delicious IPA.
M - Really smooth. No alcohol presence. Nice level of carbonation, I'd say medium. Goes down really easily.
O - This doesn't disappoint. I wish Stone could've gotten Ruination 10 to me in less than over 2 months, because I can't really compare. This is definitely less malty IMO, with a great hop variety. They're the 2 best beers I've had from Stone. I don't think this can disappoint any hop head. I've had better IPAs, but this is definitely up there. 1,263 charactersnrs207, Aug 21, 2012
