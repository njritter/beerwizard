Lots of rust colored sediment sinks to the bottom of the glass.  Laces well.  Smells of straight bourbon!  Some vanilla and chocolate shine through, but this is a booze bomb.  Tons of oak and bourbon in the flavor, chocolate and vanilla follow, and the slightest trace of chili spice finishes it off.  Surprisingly not overly sweet.    The texture is incredible.  Rich and viscous, almost fudgey.  Slick and coating, lots of boozy warmth and the spices leave minimal heat presence.  Overall, this is good, but if you don't like oak and bourbon, you may want to refrain.  Cheers! 657 charactersLingenbrau, Feb 28, 2017

Smells like a ton of bourbon, load of raisens, generous amount of vanilla and no lack of mocha. Smells slightly tart... yikes. I expect this to be rich and sugary along the lines of bcbs.
Called that. Very bcbs reminiscent on taste and flavour aside from having a bitter more bitter chocolate and coffee. Still a very sweet beer though. The faint tartness on the nose is present in the flavour. I don't know if this is intentional or not but it's subtle. I'd prefer it not there but this is still outstanding in the presence of it.
Mouthfeel is great. Heavy, chewy and spicy from the alcohol.
Overall very, very good and I will buy in a heartbeat if I see it again. 781 charactersrypkr, Feb 09, 2017

Aroma is a hint of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, yeast, and surprisingly a good bit of rye - you can tell this one is going to be awesome.  Taste is chocolate, bourbon, and some coffee.  The bourbon does not overwhelm the palate and there is nice bitterness to balance this out.  I really enjoyed this!  It's pretty boozy so it is a slow sipper and perhaps not as smooth as some of the similar beers I tried.  A minor flaw that gives this some character. 553 charactersSMZBrew, Jan 18, 2017

L: Dark black -- no light penetrates this beer to any appreciable depth.  There is a slight reddish tinge where the beer meets the air.  No foam.  Another flat Lost Abbey -- this seems to be their signature style.  I don't know why that is so hard to get right.  Maybe the alcohol content won't permit secondary fermetiation -- or injection with CO2?  It definitely detracts from the beer show.
S: While cold-- bourbon, oak, vanilla.  Can definitely get coffee and coca == even when cold.  That is pretty amazing.  It must be loaded with coffee and coca
T: Bitterness of bourbon and coffee compete.  A bit of a pucker when cold -- but the flavor lasts and morphs during a single sip.  This is awesome.  Beer really rounds out as it warms with all coming into alignment and balance.  The flavor just lasts and lasts.
F:  Well balanced.  There is some tartness from the carbonation which is there but subtle and contributes to the mouth feel.  This is a beer for small fine bubbles.
O:  Nice balance of coffee and bourbon and coca.  Let this thing warm as the bitters are not well balanced when cold.  As it warms.  An incredible beer all in all.  It is hard to pull so many pieces together but LA somehow did it. 1,406 charactersmrmaps, Dec 18, 2016

Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Stout
Misc.: N/A
Never thought I was going to be able to try this one, but saw it at Craft Kitchen and picked it over Angel’s Share - Brandy Barrel Aged. Thought about just getting the 4-oz. version for $5, but went with the 9-oz. for $8 instead.
Poured an almost pitch black color with two fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Outstanding uneven foamy lacing. Outstanding retention. (Sight - 4.00)
Smelled boozy bourbon (which smoothed out later), cocoa, milk chocolate, oak, toffee, caramel, hints of butterscotch, coffee late, espresso and vanilla. (Smell - 4.50)
Tasted bourbon, vanilla, espresso, smooth milk chocolate, wet cocoa, coffee with creamer, toffee, hints of coconut, slight roastiness and some hazelnut. (Taste - 4.50)
Full body. Creamy-to-slick texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth warming finish. (Feel - 5.00)
This was just a fantastic beer and I still think I underrated it a tad. Incredible. (Overall - 4.50)

4.19/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout aged in bourbon barrels with coffee and chocolate added, available in 12.7 oz. bottles and on limited draft.
Poured from an 12.7oz. bottle to a snifter glass.
(Appearance) Pours a rich brown head of a creamy frothed head over a jet black body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and patchy. 4.25
(Smell) Smooth, rich chocolate, caramel bread and grains, subtle coffee bean with a light roast and moderate acidity, and a potent, yet clean and appealing bourbon presence. Potency is moderate. 4
(Taste) Nip of bourbon up front, quickly revealing a decadent malt body, a moderate roast malt and coffee bean profile with a mild cream sweetness finishing on a trailing moist chocolate cake finish. Quite enjoyable. 4.25
(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, mildly creamy, lightly sticky and residual, medium dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a medium frothiness and a moderately crisp finish. Body is medium/heavy for the style, shy of heavy overall. Alcohol presence is moderate, and there are no off characters. 4.25
(Overall) A very well done imperial stout with a lot of malty richness, complexity and viscosity, all of which are complimented nicely by a respectable nip of quality bourbon aging, doesn't distract a bit from the velvety richness of the chocolate. While I didn't get a lot of coffee character aside from the roasted bitterness and some acidity, I think this beer would do quite well even without it. A pricier small format, but very well done in the end. 4.25

Aroma is very nice and contains no surprises. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and coffee.
Terrific flavour. The advertised flavours are all there, all taste good and, most importantly, mesh perfectly. None overpowers. Bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, oak and marshmallow all come through in a lovely balance. Considering how strong the beer is, the alcohol is remarkably well-hidden. It is obviously strong, but there is almost no heat, just a bit in the finish. The body is thick and velvety. The low carbonation level works very nicely.
Excellent. Expensive but it lives up to the reviews, for sure. A first class barrel-aged stout. 688 charactersjrenihan, Nov 18, 2016

4.23/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Riding on the curtails of their famed Serpent Stout, this newer version of that same dark ale enjoys a similar bourbon barrel treatment but with a slather of cocoa and coffee flavors to accessorize, propel and round out the immensity of roasted grain that goes into the base beer.
Nearly pitch black through the center, its margins read slightly bronzed, the beer's plethora of roast signals all-things-dark to the nose. Dark roast coffee, dark chocolate and the burnt edges of grain are remiss of campfire, dark fruit and licorice-type spice with a pep of caramelized booze.  Burnt sweetness carries the early taste with molasses, sorghum and baker's chocolate leading the way.
Roasted marshmallow resonate on the middle palate with its carbonized sugars clinging to the tastebuds. Fresh espresso roast mingles with cocoa powder for a sharp and robust taste that links up beautifully with the roasted grain of the beer. Seared sweetness, caramel, vanilla and roasted coconut carries the load through a flavor of cranberry, oak and licorice that share spicy and piquant nuances through the finish.
Full on the palate, the beer's robust taste allows its body to read fuller than actual. However, its acrid roast and tannic, almost vinous taste dissects the lingering malt sweetness and renders the texture relaxed and pleasantly somber. Its a complex roast flavor that pushes into the "burnt" realm more than most, perhaps a detriment to the passing stout drinker. A long linger of smoked cocoa and burnt sugar extends well  past a spicy caramelized warmth and into the next awaiting sip. 1,590 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 01, 2016

BOTTLE: 12.7 fl oz. Brown glass. Branded black hood-and-wire cage over a (branded) cork. Awesome label art showing a bat-like demon.
Per the label and website: 13.50% ABV. "Imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels with coffee and cacao nibs added." "fresh Serpent’s Stout base aged in bourbon barrels with oodles of coffee and cacao nibs added shortly before packaging." "Barrel-Aged Strong Ale" Base beers are Older Viscosity and Serpent's Stout.
HEAD: Gorgeous creamy tan brown with a shiny rich complexion. Soft in appearance, evoking a supple dessert. Retention is about 4 minutes - not bad at 13.50% ABV. Leaves no lacing as it recedes.
BODY: Opaque ink black. Completely devoid of light, which is apt in a beer with a hellish theme.
Appears aptly carbonated. Not unique in appearance, but it approaches special with the head colour and consistency alone. In any case, it's right on the money in terms of style.
AROMA: Subtle vanilla signals the use of quality bourbon barrels, replete with hints of toasted coconut, subtle barrel sugars, and rich white oak. Fudge-like chocolate emanates from the glass, suggested a layered chocolatey brew with intricate notes of cacao nibs, chocolate malt, caramel, and baker's chocolate. It dips its toes in the Hershey's syrup camp of chocolatey aromas, but doesn't dive in (thankfully). I struggle to find any coffee bitterness in the dark malt sweetness-emphatic aroma., but I do pick up on a hint of roasted barley. As far as I can tell, the bourbon barrel character has melted seamlessly into the base beer, resultant in a pleasurable harmony of the two.
Aromatic intensity is moderate. Suggests a delicious albeit rich dessert beer, but I do find the absence of any coffee a bit disappointing. Hopefully the taste delivers on that front.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Boasts a lovely creamy softness to its mouthfeel, accentuating the smooth milk chocolate tones of the brew aptly. Full-bodied with adequate heft and weight on the palate, though it never feels too heavy or overbearing (in spite of venturing a bit into an almost syrupy viscosity). Carbonation is near ideal. It's a filling brew, but isn't that what we expect in a dessert imperial stout? Silky smooth, with a luscious wet feel on the palate.
The bourbon isn't quite as evocative as the aroma promised, but there is some subtle vanilla bouncing around along with rich white oak. The bourbon barrel character complements the base beer nicely, but there isn't quite that gestalt harmony of barrel and base you'd find in the very best paragons of the bourbon barrel aged imperial stout style. Still, the bourbon and base are on equal ground; the barrel never eclipses the base in any way.
Chocolate emerges easily as the dominant note, with plenty of depth of flavour coming from cacoa nibs and chocolate malts. Fudge is evoked, and perhaps chocolate syrupy also. True to its Older Viscosity and Serpent's Stout constituents, this brew boasts layered sweetness and plenty of complexity. But the chocolate goes unchallenged by any coffee presence whatsoever, which almost unseats the balance (adding cacao nibs to an already sweet base only works if you compensate somehow). Sure, there's a bit of coffee-like acidity on the back end, but I find no rich roasted grounds, java, or the like. There's a hint of roasted barley that does lend some balancing bitterness, but I wouldn't mind seeing expressive coffee added (or even peat).
Has the subtle dark fruit Belgian bend you'd expect in a Lost Abbey stout. I guess I'd go with plum and prune; I don't get any gooey fig or dates. Some raisin, sure. Nougat. Some harsher burnt sugars.
The 13.50% ABV isn't as noticeable as it could be; this drinks like it's maybe 11% - which is still a noticeable level of warmth. She's a sipper - as she should be.
Flavour duration is moderately high. Flavour intensity is moderately high (which is apt for the style).
No overt hop notes. No overt yeast notes.
As it comes to temperature, the texture skews a bit towards the rougher end near the finish.
OVERALL: Track #10 brings enjoyable bourbon barrel notes to two base beers that are already quite well-executed, and the result - while perhaps not in excess of the sum of its parts - is a treat of a dessert beer that nevertheless has room for improvement particularly in terms of coffee presence, depth of flavour, intricacy, and amplified bourbon barrel notes. I can't endorse it as one of Lost Abbey's best beers, if only because they make so many excellent ones. I'm glad I tried it once and I'd definitely recommend it to others (even at its high price). Tasty stuff.
Pair with chocolate covered cherries or pomegranate seeds.

4.26/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25For a top-tier, barrel-aged dark beer, a surprising amount of carbonation has survived. That's not to say that it looks overly carbonated, but it has a nice, creamy-looking ring of bubbles around the edge. The beer itself is, of course, opaque and jet black.
The smell is out of this world. Tons of barrel character without being overly oaky or too sweet... but there's definitely sweetness on the nose. Tons of chocolate and bourbon, backed up by vanilla, oak, and that hard-to-place sweet mustiness (for lack of a better word) that I sometimes get from the Lost Abbey barrel-aged beers.
The flavor is very similar to smell, but a bit lighter and less potent. All the same notes are there, just less intense.
The mouthfeel is probably the only downside here. It still has a good mouth-coating feel like other great BA beers, but it still comes across as lacking the full richness and viscosity that you get with its competition. It could be a solid competitor to BCBCS if it weren't for this one aspect.
I love this beer. I'd still take BCBCS over this one, but good luck getting a BCBCS! Track #10 is much easier to find, and it blows away KBS'16. Kudos to Lost Abbey. 1,170 charactersccg, Oct 16, 2016

Smells of lots of cocoa and coffee... some vanilla notes that I suspect are from the bourbon. Kind of boozy but in a good way. Taste is very similar, except the bourbon really comes out in the end.
The feel is very nice; thick and oily. Chewy finish with a wave of flavors that finish with a nice bourbon kiss. This is one that should get a lot more love from the barrel aged crowd. 496 charactersGreatStoutman, Sep 19, 2016

Well, here it is, and it's just as delicious as I expected it to be. 
It's a lot like kbs, no doubt, but with a fuller mouthfeel and a richer, more boozy flavor that I'm truly in love with. To be perfectly honest if this beer were at the same price point as kbs and as widely distributed it would kill. As it is now, it's an overpriced west coast curio that should never fall under anyone's radar given the chance to try it (isn't that how all of the lost abbey's beers are though? I remember drinking red poppy and saying "wow this is the best American made Flanders red ale I've ever tasted!!! But! Um! I... Could get a 4 pack of  rodenbach gran cru for the same price...). That being said, I'm really glad I got to try it, being as I'm in la right now and all (375 ml bottle 2016 btw) and I maintain that y'all west coast folks are spoiled as hell. Good thing I've got family here now.
Seriously though, other than the price and availability of kbs, I'd put this over it any day 1,149 charactersJack_Malts, Aug 12, 2016

Pours a dark as night brown color. Smell is of intense bourbon, chocolate, and coffee all intermingling with each other perfectly. Initial drink brings forth bourbon and dark chocolate characteristics. These flavors lead into a more subtle roasty coffee and milk chocolate flavor that finishes with a mild roastiness and lingering chocolate and oak flavor. This is awesome. I can see why it's so highly rated. Feel is semi thick but not overly viscous. Just right. Overall this is an outstanding beer that I will definitely buy multiple bottles of in the future. 604 charactersReema, Jul 22, 2016

The color is black as night with opaque clarity and quickly dissipating head that falls to a ring but revives when swirled. The smell is semi-raisiny with some mild wood in the aroma with mix of bourbon and mild coffee earthen scent with some slight dark cocoa but the bourbon is dominant. The feel is intense with rich toasted and boozy character with saturation of caramelized sugar and light tannic quality from barrel aging with a warming dry finish and moderately carbonated throughout.
The taste has a roast coffee mixed with bourbon and toasted malt quality with slight cocoa and mild alcoholic flavor from the bourbon with hint of vanilla and caramelized sugar with toast of char in the barrel adding slight hint of smoke with dark coffee/cocoa and subtle dried fruit flavor as it finishes sort of spicy from the alcohol in the taste with more woody essence. This is very good -lots of dark coffee and bourbon in the taste as drinkable as it can be for being a 13% barrel aged beer. The only drawback for me is the amount of alcohol in the taste -less drinkable than some other 13% stouts(serpent's even?) 1,186 charactersSlatetank, Jul 07, 2016

Bourbon is less strong on the tongue but still prominent. Coffee and semi-sweet chocolate.  Caramel, molasses, vanilla, and cream. Some dark notes of earth, smoke, and roasted malt. Just hints of alcohol.
Smooth, thick mouth feel. Moderate carbonation.  Nice sweetness with an underlying bitter counterbalance. Lingering bourbon, barrel, and chocolate. Alcoholic heat but not distracting.
Superb beer. Bourbon is strong and smooth.  Tremendous balance and depth of flavor. Sweet and bitter. 786 charactersleroybrown10, Jul 02, 2016

Aroma- booze, barrel, chocolate in that order.  
Taste-  boozy chocolate bourbon.  
Feel-  oily and a little too thin. That being said, very enjoyable. 
Overall-  this is very solid ba stout.  That being said its not a top 20  ba stout.  Worthy of top 250 status but not level of kbs or bcs 338 charactersjcflorian, Jun 20, 2016

4.46/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5My patience finally gave way. Originally purchased in March 2015. 
Deep black body that no light can penetrate.  Thick, foamy dark khaki colored head.  Dissipated to a thing ring around the edge and whispy bubbles in the center.  No lacing.  Surprising lack of legs given the high ABV. 
Sharp bourbon and oak in the nose.  Very obviously sweet. Getting a little bit of plum and raisin.  The coffee has unfortunately disappeared, which wasn't entirely unexpected. 
Lots of bourbon hits first. Way more than I was expecting.  Oak and vanilla/marshmallow in the second stage.  The finish on this beer is something that needs to be experienced.  It's just layers and layers of decadence.  Semisweet chocolate chips, bitter baker's chocolate, and fudge all combine in a beautiful symphony.  Dark fruits (figs, plums, raisins) are present as well, with the slightest hint of espresso bitterness towards the very end and the marshmallow returning with a vengeance.  The fudge lingers on the palate for what has to be a record or damn near one. 
Silky and oily, but a little thin. Low carbonation and a dry finish. 1,110 charactersepyon396, Jun 19, 2016

T: coffee, vanilla, alcohol, a little cinnamon, bourbon really shines through, finishes with chocolate and licorice
M:   nice viscosity even for a bourbon barrel beer makes it creamy it is still a touch thinner but nothing you can usually do when its barrel aged 
O: Very very good bourbon barrel stout with coffee the touch of cinnamon is nice without being overwhelming like in some beers. I don't know if it was worth as expensive as their beers are but it is definitely one of the better ones I have had. 746 charactersSomethingClever, May 07, 2016

A: The beer is jet black in color.  It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that died down rather quickly, leaving a minuscule collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of cocoa beans are present in the nose along with notes of cocoa and latter hints of dark chocolate. Notes of bourbon become noticeable as the beer warms.
T: Lots of flavors of dark chocolate and cocoa nibs are present in the taste along with some notes of bourbon, the latter of which becomes especially prominent as the beer warms up.
M: It feels full-bodied on the palate and has a low to moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer does a good job in hiding its alcohol—it tastes strong but you don't really get any of the alcohol in the taste.

I'm not sure what a cacao nib is, but this Track had a lot of them!  Slight bourbon aftertaste. Somewhat sharp and very tasty.

5-22-16 - Enjoyed in my backyard.  Poured from a caged and corked bottle that I picked up from the brewery in early April.   Poured into my Teku tall stemmed logo glass (that I also picked up at the brewery in early April).  One of my favorites from Tomme that's sort of available.  Coffee, bourbon, and cacao nibs in a glass.  So awesome.  Crank the Meat Loaf. 609 charactersGregaroo, Mar 29, 2016

 Another Track special from the Abbey. Really like the base beer to begin with so the bourbon, coffee and cocoa really step this up. The alcohol is masked with all these intense but well blended flavors, but the almost 14% really catches up to you after a few full sips. Luckily I snagged a bottle to age and see it anything changes with time, but this is great right now. Balanced with no one flavor overpowering. 462 charactersSHerninko, Mar 29, 2016

Vintage 2016 is etched into the side of the bottle.
poured into HF wine stem.
Appearance: A hard pour results in a black body with thick mocha brown cap that drops down to very minimal cap. A quick swirl brings back a thin cap. After each sip some booze legs are found on the side of the glass.
Smell: Sharp bourbon, dry oak, and chocolate dominate the nose. You get the biggest sniff of the coffee immediately after pouring into the glass, but the coffee seems to get lost rather quickly from the bourbon and chocolate notes. Also getting a hint of dark fruits.
Taste: This beer starts off sweet; bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, and dark fruits (mostly raisins). In the middle the beer goes through this transition of sweet to bittersweet; more along the lines of more bitter and less sweet. Lots of dry oak presence with bourbon adding sweetness in an attempt to balance the flavors. Molasses, light anise, powdered bakers cacao, and cold brew coffee that has an acidic, earthy, and nutty coffee bean characteristic about it. Finish is a lingering moderate bitterness with big oak notes to compliment. As this beer warms up, you really start tasting even more raisins and the coffee does not go away...its an interesting combo that I don't taste too often in a barrel aged stout.
Mouthfeel: full bodied beer with low carbonation. Very oily and chewy stout. Lightly dry finish. Huge robust flavors slamming out of this stout makes it feel even more massive than 13.5% ABV, but this beer is not boozy at all. Perhaps the moderately bitter finish masks the alcohol, but it is really hard to detect.
Overall: I am not a huge fan of Lost Abbey, but this is an excellent barrel aged stout. The coffee and cacao nibs are great adjuncts in the beer and Serpent Stout is a fantastic base beer for barrel aging. This beer is everything that it is advertised to be.  My biggest problem with this beer is the cost. 14.99 before tax for a 375ml bottle of beer. This is not much of a surprise with Lost Abbey as they have some pretty expensive bottle prices on most of their beers. Probably my favorite barrel aged high ABV offerings that Lost Abbey has to offer. 2,187 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Mar 24, 2016

A: Pours a thick, deep black with a ring of fine, dark brown head.  Good retention and some dots of lacing.  
S: Coffee, cream, and mild roast, integrated with bourbon. Light dark chocolate and mild sweetness comes through. 
T: Bourbon is a little more forward, along with spice, oak, some cream, cocoa, and a hint of dark dried fruit (blackcurrant).  Really delicious.  Finishes fairly dry for a beer this big and complex, which is a bit of a deviation from the typical. 
M: Full bodied with medium carbonation, a bit higher than expected (but not to the point of distraction).  Slightly creamy mouthfeel. 
O: A standout coffee BA stout from Lost Abbey.  Gives BCBCS a run for its money. 706 characterspmarlowe, Mar 23, 2016

Appearance: It poured an opaque pitch black with a thin less than half finger dark brown head that leaves nice stringy lacing.
Aroma: Strong bourbon and chocolate with some sweetness coming from hints of molasses, toffee and vanilla.
Taste: Very nice espresso coffee, crunchy coffee bean, dark bittersweet chocolate and bourbon notes.
Mouthfeel: Thick, full bodied with low carbonation and light alcohol warming.
Overall: This was really good. It was surprising that there wasn’t much coffee on the nose, but it definitely came out in the taste. A great sipper on a cool night. 722 characterskitch, Mar 14, 2016

Poured into a snifter.
A - Pours black with essentially no head but you do get a tan ring that does not go away.

T - Definite chocolate and coffee flavors.  The bourbon is present even before it hits your tongue, but this beer is not hot.
M - Rather thick mouth feel with very little carbonation.

The beer pours a nice jet black color, thick and viscous as it pours where a slim finger of taut head appears, khaki color, moderate retention and great lace. The aroma is very nice, smooth coffee roach, huge chocolate presence, thick and rich, with nice layered barrel character, bourbon, charred oak, light toffee, vanilla bean and some lingering stone fruits. It presents really well, big, bold, but balanced and inviting. The flavors follow the nose really nicely, really prominent coffee roast, thick and luscious chocolate, lightly bittersweet, assertive bourbon character, light chewy oak, a touch of acidity pops out at the back from the coffee and leaves some stone fruits and warm alcohol. The mouthfeel is good, lively carbonation, coating, full bodied though a bit thinner than expected but it has a nice texture and a very warm finish.
Verdict: A nice coffee stout from The Lost Abbey. I really enjoyed this in the original Box Set released and am glad to see it again. It's not quite as magical as I recall it being, but still an exceptional barrel aged stout, worthy of any and all praises. 1,212 characterskevanb, Mar 08, 2016

There is a ton of bourbon notes at 13.5% with prevalence of dark chocolate and caramel.

From a corked and caged 37,5cl bottle into a snifter
Imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels with coffee and cacao nibs added
APPEARANCE: A thick black pour yields a one finger, medium looking, slightly creamy, mocha head with good retention. Pitch black body with no carbonation evident. Head fades to a full wisp. A swirly wisp and ring remain until the end leaving traces of lacing down the glass. Good looking. 
SMELL: Bourbon, oak, pure chocolate and cacao nibs. Some definite coffee and sweet cream notes with hints of coconut and vanilla as well. Nice and medium in strength. 
TASTE: Bourbon, oak, pure chocolate and cacao nibs up front. Some more bourbon at the swallow with cacao, sweet vanilla cream, bitter coffee and pure chocolate, oak and bourbon lingering on the palate. Some burnt notes as well. Bold and interesting. 
PALATE: Medium body and slightly higher levels of carbonation. Lighter for sure, unfortunately, creamy enough, goes down fine and finishes mouth-coating. Some heat lingers. 
OVERALL: Good stuff. The feel is a little lighter and foamier than I'd hoped for the style, but the flavor and aroma fit the bill. Nice barrel component and good coffee character as well. The color on it is right up my alley as well. Thicken up the feel and you could have a real winner here, but for now this is a good brew as it is. Cheers ScottO! Have always wanted to try this one. 1,463 charactersJeffo, Feb 02, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Drank at the site of the old Stone brewery, the Lost Abbey brewery.  Pours out black, thin dark brown head on the top of it.  Aroma was massive coffee, then chocolate, then bourbon barrel and oak.  Very well done.
Holy crap, if the taste wasn't even better, almost flawless, this is the answer to beers like Mocha Wednesday and Black Tuesday.  Slightly less strong, but easier to drink while dropping all the flavors in those other two like they were blended to make this.  This is some pungent and dense ass coffee and chocolate going onto a great base beer.   Carbonation is right where it should be, allows a little creamer and vanilla to come into play downbottle.  Not hot, hides alcohol well, very well made beer. 720 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 14, 2016
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Corked and caged 375mL bottle from Justdoit1234 (thanks man!). No identifiable bottling information but I believe this is from the 2015 release. Served in a Burnt Hickory snifter. 
Pours jet black with a finger and a half mocha hued head. A full, fluffy collar remains and deposits some nice cunks of lace. 
The aroma may not break new ground but is spot on for what I want from this style. Caramel macchiato, bourbon, brown sugar, toast, chocolate and dark fruit are all mixed together in a welcoming nose that I linger to enjoy with each sip. 
As in the smell the flavors might not be new or unexpected but are utterly delicious. Rich blend of bourbon, caramel coffee, chocolate fudge, oak, vanilla, brown sugar and a subtle nip of alcohol. No surprises here other than how easily this 13.5% abv brute goes down. Outstanding. 
Creamy, full body with moderately soft carbonation. The decadent aftertaste has notes of bourbon soaked chocolate cake and caramel macchiato. 
Track 10 (Bat Out Of Hell) is dead on for what I want from a bourbon barrel aged imperial coffee stout. My personal favorite of anything I've tried from Lost Abbey. Well worth a try if you have the chance. 1,182 charactersThickNStout, Jan 14, 2016

Black as the night with a cinnamon-colored head. A mildly vigorous pour resulted in about a half-inch head that receded rather quickly. Huge chocolate and bourbon aroma.  Coffee is there, but not the star of the show.  Flavor is more chocolate and coffee with some light caramel and vanilla.  Mouthfeel is smooth and only lingers slightly. Overall a really nice barrel-aged adjunct stout. Definitely worth seeking out unless you're lucky enough to deal with someone generous enough to just surprise you with it.
Thanks again, Bart! 607 charactersKyleDavis, Nov 25, 2015

A: Complex mixture of chocolate, coffee, and complimentary malt roast, followed by some light bourbon, and some oaky character.

M: Medium bodied with light carbonation.  The beer coats the palate without being overly viscous, there’s a slight alcoholic warmth on the finish.

Subtle bourbon, oak notes with very little coffee remaining in the nose. Smells sweet and rich.
Taste still has a good bit of coffee with a little bitterness, like rich, dark chocolate.  Bourbon on the finish complements the malt without overwhelming.  Drinks wonderfully at one year.
Still very effervescent, like champagne. Thick and coats the mouth. Delicious. 497 characterstkdchampxi, Nov 17, 2015

Look: pours a viscous, super-dark brown, with a short-lived light brown head.
Smell: coffee, fudge, Kahlúa-esque alcohol. Powdery.
Taste: fusel alcohol, chocolate, dark cherry, mild coffee, oak, vanilla.
Feel: chewy, but perhaps a bit over-carbonated. Bitter and slightly dry.
Overall: a decent beer, but a bit of a chore to drink, and certainly not worth whatever I paid for it. 433 charactersneurobot01, Oct 15, 2015

A - Poured into a Lost Abbey Teku glass. Beer is very dark, oily black with a thin tan head that dissipates leaving lacing.  
S - Aromas of some booze, fudge, vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate and some bourbon notes. Smells heavenly. .
T - Taste is very similar to the nose...lots of fudge.  Super rich and viscous. Lots of nice bourbon vanilla, caramel. Very light alcohol presence.  
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated but very creamy.  
O - This beer really reminded me of Black Tuesday. Less boozy, obviously, but very similar flavors. Excellent beer. 605 charactersRAlmeida77, Sep 11, 2015

3.56/5  rDev -19.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75The beer is black with a small light brown head. The aroma has some fruity coffee and chocolate flavors with a fairly strong booze note. Mild roast, mild citrus, big hit of pepper. There’s a decent amount of flavor, but it lacks the richness that I’m looking for in really big stouts. The taste has a big toasty malt note but not as much accompanying sweetness as I’d like. Lots of peppery spice. Odd vegetal flavor. Big on coffee, though it’s a bit bland, possibly due to time. Only moderate sweetness. Medium bitter. Finishes drier than expected or appreciated. Booze and spice burn on the palate. Lighter mouthfeel than I’d prefer. 644 characterspopery, Aug 07, 2015

S - Huge coffee and dark chocolate nose. It settles down to a fair amount of bourbon and oak.
T - Wow!!! To me it follows the nose and extrapolates the nose.  Big dark chocolate and coffee taste at first. And afterwards an even bigger bourbon taste. 
F - Full bodied and low carbonation. Chewy feel on so smooth.
O - This is fantastic from beginning to end. 473 characterscvm4, Aug 02, 2015

Super pitch black syrupy thick long legs, no real head but swirling the beer makes some head attempt to appear. 
Nose loaded with chocolate, super dark choc, fudge, caramel mocha, toasted malts and big coffee cream, hint of booze, super dark complex, little earthy hop, reminds me of black Tuesday. Nice vanilla barrel, caramel candies cream, dark booze raisiny thing,  
Taste dark chocolate, smooth rich creamy fudge and creamy dark choc, cocoa, roasted malts with coffee and kahlua coffee liquor, rich fudge, mild booze warmth, thick chewy, caramel and nice vanilla barrel, mild toffee and nougat fudge. Mild bitter earthy hops, mild booze soaked raisin. Finish is drier, very little booze, more fudgey cocoa, coffee cream and roast. 
Mouth is full bod fudgey cocoa, chewy, a touch of hot booze, decent carb. 
Overall great. It's like a Black Tuesday with less booze, really nice and enjoyable. 920 charactersjlindros, Jun 20, 2015

Deep bourbon flavor to start, then a big rush the cacao chocolatey flavor.  Vanilla mixes in throughout, with a dry dark roast aftertaste.  Full bodied, mouth coating beer.  My teeth might change color after this.  Fairly well carbed too.  This beer is amazing.  Had on draft, would love to get a bottle of this and let it sit.  Had this after KBS and this more than holds its own. 632 charactershaazer, Jun 05, 2015

A: Pours damn near black with a very very thin short lived copper colored head that quickly faded into nothingness. No lace. 
S: Rich, sweet, and heavy smelling scents of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee beans, leather, and a touch of caramel. The bourbon is sweet and sticky but not hot smelling. I get just a hint of cinnamon as well.
T: Tons of bourbon, dark chocolate and creamy milk chocolate ice-cream comes through. The coffee flavor comes through in the finish and is roasted and slightly bitter. The finish and aftertaste are full of fresh, sweet, bourbon, leather, vanilla, and a touch of caramel and tobacco. The bourbon is still pretty strong and gives off a slight anise characteristic as well.
M: Thick and heavy body, chewy and sticky mouthfeel, low but tingly carbonation that fizzes up gently on my palate. The bourbon is not hot, but it has a lot of flavor that I thought might be better integrated into the chocolate and coffee if this had a little bit more age. 
O: I think a few months in the bottle might do this one some good – soften the flavors out a bit and round off some edges. Flavors were good, and the high abv is definitely hidden very well. Not my favorite stout but a rich and potent sipper. 1,260 charactersscottfrie, May 14, 2015

Aroma of dark toasted malt, milk and dark chocolate, bourbon, a hint of coffee. Flavor is well integrated dark toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. Nice chocolate covered coffee bean finish. There is a light booziness to it, but this stout is substantial enough to hide its intensity. Medium to heavy bodied with light creaminess, nice mouth feel. A very well balanced and complex barreled stout. Each of the ingredients is distinct, but all seem to integrate really well. One of the best coffee flavor support beers I've had, it's like it was designed to present fresh coffee flavors, although even those do not dominate. I'm quite impressed with this one. Nicely done. 803 charactersLiquidAmber, Apr 25, 2015

Poured beautifully into my teku, but from there I might as well have been drinking a bottle at 1/5 the price.  No nose to speak of, mouthfeel was crisp (not smooth), and there wasn't the depth of flavor I'd expect from this type of BA brew.  Love me some Serpent's Stout, but I'd rather have had 2x of them than this 375ml of meh. 396 charactersalwaysplayin, Apr 23, 2015

4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Not much carbonation or head from the pour but it comes out like motor oil. 
Smells like chocolate, oak, tobacco and a bit of soy sauce. 
Tastes chocolatey with good oak notes. Not particularly varying in flavors to my taste buds. Spicy boozy does quite a number on the flavor. 
It's hotter and more bourbon dominated than I like in my beers. But it's chewy and thick-bodied and so there's enough here to enjoy. 
All I'ma say is $18 though? For 375mL? When I can get similar beers anywhere from $9 a 750? An old and common lament but Lost Abbey prices are absurd. There are cheaper and still better options. 611 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 16, 2015

A- Dark brown, nearly black body, opaque with a one finger espresso coloured head, nice retention, no lacing.
S- Strong vegetal pepper aroma that becomes more coffee-like as it warms up but it never loses that vegetal character completely. A bit of bourbon, a fair amount of milk chocolate, cocoa, small amount of roasted malt.
F- Milk chocolate, cocoa, none of the vegetal aromas, espresso, bourbon, a slight amount of vanilla (but not very much). Solid flavour profile, a bit hot in terms of alcohol.
M- Medium bodied, good carbonation, more of a mix of slick and dry finish that is slightly boozy with a cocoa-heavy finish.
O- Solid barrel-aged coffee stout with a solid body, but it's no Sunday Morning or BCBCS. 766 charactersStevedore, Apr 13, 2015

A- Pitch black as the bat out of hell with a dark mocha tan cap to a finger; good retention. Webs and drizzle coat the glace with lacing.
S- Massive fudgey desserts and Bourbon bring the decadence level to the max. Huge chocolate inviting with coffee and heavy roast barley. Heavy rounded out oaky sweetness and peppery Bourbon.
T- The aroma transitions to the flavor smoothly with the same general theme; a huge brew. Added dark fruits like spicy fig to the mix of sweet oak, spicy peppery Bourbon, insane cocoa, medium to dark roast coffee, alcohol and big caramel.
MF- Massive thick bodied with medium carbonation adding to the decadence. Finishes fairly warm but for the ABV its not even close to a surprise or a flaw.
A big beer in all aspects that a beer can be big. Dessert-like cocoa is found throughout complimenting the whiskey and coffee notes added in with that. 945 characterscbutova, Apr 12, 2015

A: Pitch-black pour with the darkest head I've ever seen on a beer before. The head is exactly the same color as the body upon the initial pouring. What an odd effect, has to be seen to be understood. Head lightens up slightly and fizzes out at a moderate pace. Zero lacing, minimal retention. I gave it extra points for the midnight black head. 
S: Heavy, heavy, heavy roasted malt. Lots and lots of coffee and chocolate along for the ride. Get some dark fruits buried in there and there's even a touch of anise. Not really getting a huge bourbon presence but it's there, an oaky vanilla and caramel sweetness hovering above all the chocolate/coffee/roasty aromas. A little boozy sting when swirled.
T: Whoa. Strong but smooth bourbon up front. Heavy caramel with a light vanilla backing. Caramel segways into lots of sweet chocolate syrup with a coffee backing. Coffee flavors aren't in-your-face but provide a mildly bittersweet backing and balance to all of the sweet caramel and chocolate. Coffee stands out and shines a more towards the finish when the sweetness fades. Finishes off with a strong oaky bourbon caramel and boozy stinging aftertaste.
M: Heavy, viscous and stinging.
O: Very interesting and fun brew. It starts off all sweet and smooth and ends with sharp, stinging flavors. Polar opposites. Balance is spectacular, flavors are bold and well-defined. Everything is strong but nothing stands out as overpowering. Even the drinkability is surprisingly good for such a big, layered barrel-aged stout. Lots of complexity, lots of booze, lots of everything in this one. Most impressive Lost Abbey brew I've ever had. By a million miles. 1,690 charactersDope, Apr 06, 2015

No bitterness , but dark roast flavor of excellent java, cocoa balanced with bourbon and alcohol heat. 
Very enjoyable, but not an everyday sipper .  If cost is a burden , try Epic Brewing Big Bad Baptist at. $14 per bomber or coffee BCBS if you can find it 
Highly recommended. I stocked up on track 8 due to uniqueness of a cinnamon raisin Quad. I don't think I will get another of these, but await the next installment. 
I won't even talk about how pissed I was that both of my aged Agave Maria went bad, sour in a repugnant way. Oops, I mentioned it.  See review. 636 charactersJjski, Apr 05, 2015

A- pours jet black and thick as motor oil with a one-finger foamy dark tan-almost brown head that dissipates quickly, leaving just a trace of head behind 
S- big blast of bourbon on the nose adds aromas of oaky vanilla, quickly followed by dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, scorched caramel, toasted marshmallow & acetone.  The coffee addition adds a strong aroma of raw green pepper with underlying espresso.  As it sits longer, more oaky bourbon & chocolate aromas prevail
T- bourbon barrel flavors are prominent up front with spicy bourbon mixing with oak and vanilla, the addition of the cocoa nibs are noticed mid-palate, with a big bittersweet dark chocolate flavor, the coffee addition follows the nose in that it has a flavor of raw green pepper, followed by more of an espresso flavor.  The finish adds more bourbon with sweet caramel and alcohol 
M- medium viscous body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming, oily finish
O- taking an already great stout and adding cocoa, bourbon barrel & coffee?  This one is a winner, and drinks quite easily for the ABV 1,141 charactersTreyliff, Mar 29, 2015

A lot more taste on draft, plenty of spices, fresh chocolate, crushed red pepper. The body is heftier as well and the price is right so this is a good choice to have at a bar (I'm upping up my ratings)
====================================================
I was excited to find this at a store in Philadelphia. Barrel-aged Serpent Stout+coffee+cacao? Yes please! 
And yet this beer falls short of its hefty price tag and high expectations. Yes, there is coffee, good cacao taste, the astringent and piquant taste of the bourbon barrel and a bit of chili spice... and yet there is not much to get excited about here, besides the customary roastiness, chocolate and customary darkness of a stout this big.
 The body is thin, the taste is correct but underwhelming and short and  the price weights heavy (drinkability is good, though)
  The memory of this beer will be short-lived. 
I'll drink a Bourbon County Coffee any day, for ten dollars less. Or a Serpent Stout. 1,067 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Mar 29, 2015

A: Pours like a glass of dessert, all dark brown swirls and a nice mocha head that never fully disappears. 
S: Amazing nose, sweet bourbon notes of vanilla, toasted coconut and marshmallow, followed by the roast and cocoa. Some definite dark fruit (raisins, mostly) notes. Can't wait to taste.
T/M: First taste, excessively sweet, the coffee is hidden until the end, when it reminds me of the remnants of a mocha-laden espresso drink. Very prevalent hints of vanilla and chocolate, with just a touch alcohol burn to remind you that it's 12%. Perfect feel, thick and chewy as a beer like this should be. More alcohol burn as it warms.
O: A really excellent BA stout, though no question of its ABV, and for a beer with coffee it's somewhat lacking those flavors. All-in-all though, a very good beer. 850 charactersmarkgugs, Mar 27, 2015

This one pours a deep, dark, glossy-looking black, with a small, filmy quarter-inch head, and not a whole lot of lacing.
Smells super wonderful, tons of chocolate, rich, dark, and slightly sweet-smelling, with roasty coffee, and a big meaty bourbon character.
This is one of the best BA stouts I've ever had. Definitely flies under the radar. The chocolate is the star for me, really tasty, slightly sweet, but roasty bittersweet, with some cocoa powder and some nutty roasted coffee, and a lot of sweet bourbon. There's a little bit of caramel, but it's definitely not too sweet here, as the roasted, nearly charred malt character really balances out the sweet components.
This is thick bodied, with a creamy, full, and quite expressive mouthfeel. The carbonation is low, just there enough to keep this one very drinkable.
This is was amazing. I really want to get a bottle of it to try now. 940 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 23, 2015

The smell starts with a sweetness I didn't expect. It's almost like an after dinner drink. 
The taste is extremely rich, like biting into a rich brownie. Yet, it's not so sweet. Lots of semisweet chocolate. Chewy in terms of body with a light carbonation touch. The aftertaste is of dark malt and is long lasting. 462 characterssmcolw, Mar 21, 2015

Pours out really dark and oily. The smell is bold with coffee and bourbon notes. The taste is similar to the nose, coffee, dark chocolate bourbon. The feel is thick and leaves a coating for long lasting flavor. Overall it's a hell of a stout to say the least. Very impressive. 373 charactersKnapp85, Mar 20, 2015

It was a bit light on the tongue, but still substantial.   Taste shows good barrel and bourbon character, followed by chocolate, some coffee bitterness, and a bit of alcohol burn.  This easy a very good barrel aged coffee stout. Just a hair below bcbcs and tweak. 361 charactersOneEye78, Mar 14, 2015
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a 12.7 fl. oz. corked and caged bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Served in a snifter
Super oily and viscous, near pitch black appearance. The liquid was capped by a one-finger tall, super tight and creamy, saddle brown head. Streaky lacing stuck along the glass. The head slowly dropped to a bubbly mass that eventually transformed into a thick, frothy, lasting collar.
The aroma was super boozy. Bourbon and oak came through strong and contributed intense vanilla and woody notes. Loads of freshly ground coffee beans. Roasty and dry yet also quite sweet. Brown sugar was noticeable. Some dark chocolate as well. Almost a bit chocolate syrup-like. Hints of dark fruits also appeared. Booze soaked raisins were detectible and perhaps even some port. Chocolate fudge notes came out as the beer warned.
Bourbon notes dominated in the flavor profile. Super boozy. A bit hot initially. Dark chocolate came through strong on the front end. Coffee grounds were also apparent. Deep, dark and roasty with some dark fruits. Raisiny and slightly sweet. Touch of burnt sugar. Bitter, charred notes lingered in the dry, tannic finish. An intense boozy sting was noticeable on the swallow. The alcohol presence became quite overwhelming by the drink's end.
The liquid was amazingly creamy, slick and smooth on the palate. Full bodied but slightly short of viscous. The beer contained a fine, zippy carbonation that seemed a bit excessive initially but settled down with time.
Track #10 is a smack-you-in-the-face type of imperial stout. While I really enjoyed this, I wish that the alcohol was better integrated into the flavor profile. You definitely taste all 13.5% in this monster. 1,705 charactersDamian, Mar 13, 2015

A - Pours an oily, black color - opaque even when held to the light.  A short cap of dark, mocha foam falls quickly and leaves an uneven collar and sparse lacing on the glass.
S - Sweet, bourbony, boozy, molasses, cocoa, mild coffee and roastiness...has a smooth and almost creamy character to it.
T - Coffee really comes thru in the flavor taking the lead in the flavor profile.  Bitter, cocoa powder, creamy chocolate, boozy with a clean bourbon flavor, some dark fruits, traces of vanilla.
M - Thick and full bodied with a slick and oily feel on the tongue.  Low carbonation with just a hint of life to it, but works just about perfectly here.  Intense coffee roast and firm, warm bourbon on each sip.  Rounded out by a sweet, caramelly and vanilla-y note.
O - Nice BB imperial stout.  For me the coffee really makes this beer.  It plays really well against the bourbon.  This is quite smooth overall despite its intensity. 1,031 charactersportia99, Mar 10, 2015

M: a little bite that I want to say will fade with some time. It's not too thick, sits great in your mouth.

A-  Pours a very dark black with a thick 2-finger mocha head that has good retention receding to a thin layer and leaving thin lacing.
S-  Cocoa nibs, malted chocolate, very noticeable bourbon presence, light integrated coffee, smells a bit on the boozy side but that is mostly contributed to the bourbon smell.
T-  Smooth milk chocolate, integrated bourbon, light coffee.  Finishes with malted chocolate, milk chocolate, and light espresso.  Overall well integrated with just a bit on the bourbon side.
M-  Super smooth for 13.5%, a bit on the creamy side and pretty full bodied but the head makes it nicely drinkable.
O-  This was a great beer, I'd probably stock up on bottles if it wasn't so pricey.  My only complaint is that the coffee could be turned up a little bit more and the bourbon toned down slightly.  This is probably the most comparable beer I've had to Bourbon County Coffee, so if you like that beer this is definitely worth trying. 1,043 charactersjaasen64, Mar 02, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Holy hell this one is dark. Dark as a demon's ass! Brown head. Not much lacing. Almost leaves wine-esque legs along the glass. The first sniff is preposterously aromatic. Heavy, damp bourbon notes. Hershey's syrup with whiskey. Coffee aroma is also strong. Dark fruit and Port. Awesome nose. Intensity level is set on 'lethal'. Flavor coats the tongue. The coffee becomes perhaps the main contributor to the flavor. Oh but that bourbon refuses to pipe down, too. Fudgy, brownie, chocolate flavors. Reminiscent of Port wine. Rich, sweet, and darkly fruity. A sweet, Irish Whiskey experience dominates the aftertaste and lingers for several minutes. This is one huge, brazen, loaded beer. Soft carbonation. Drying alcohol. Oily body. Maybe the longest lasting, most potent aftertaste I have ever encountered. This did not come cheap but I don't regret the purchase. This is a barrel treated version of their Serpent's Stout. I was not overly enamored with the base beer a few years ago when I tried it. Perhaps I should check back in with that beer. 1,055 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 14, 2015

Smell – Intense malt, cacao, coffee, bourbon, oak, and vanilla.
Taste – Malt, with the perfect amount of bourbon (not overly done), vanilla, cacao, and coffee.
Mouthfeel – Lightly carbonated, noticeable alcohol from the bourbon (though not too much), silky, with a nice vanilla bourbon aftertaste.
Drinkability – This is a very good stout! 450 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, Feb 13, 2015

M: Pretty robust, actually.

4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4No bottle date
Look - Pours like motor oil, deep black with only the faintest reddish hue when held up to light.  Head is very effervescent and dissipates quickly.  Leaves a ring of bubbles around the surface with a smattering of bubble islands the color of coffee with cream.  No lacing.  4 paws.
Smell - Lots of coffee up front, with smoky, vinous undertones.  A bit of vanilla bourbon character comes through as the beer settles down.  In fact, it really takes over once the beer warms.  4.25 paws.
Taste - Lots of burnt coffee character, a bit astringent.  Dark, dusty chocolate present as well.  Slight vanilla, and hints of dark berries.  Boozy finish.  Chocolate prevails when held in mouth.  3.75 paws.
Feel - Luscious creamy viscosity, very smooth.  Tingle towards the back of the tongue.  4.75 paws.
Overall - I was very much looking forward to trying this beer, and wanted to like it more than I did.  I think this is the first Lost Abbey/Port barrel aged offering I've had that I haven't been completely delighted by.  I remember being underwhelmed by Serpent's Stout, so perhaps I'm just not a fan of the base beer.  This just came off too bitter and boozy.  Still a thoroughly enjoyable beer, just not entirely world-class imho.  4 paws. 1,256 charactersBowWowWowYippyYoIPA, Feb 09, 2015

Dark brownish black with a thin khaki head. 
Aromas of sweet bourbon and chocolate, some kind of nuttiness, caramel. Very rich.
Rich, layered tastes of bourbon, chocolate, toffee, peanut brittle. Kind of buttery. A little bit of coffee on the end. Lots of dessert-like notes but not too sweet.
Medium bodied, smooth, kind of viscous. A little light for an imperial stout but it works.

A: Pours jet black, no light passes through, with a rich brown head that settles and very lightly laces. 
S: Dark chocolate and sweet cocoa, smooth bourbon some coffee but not as much as I was expecting, molasses and dark sugar. 
T: Roasted malt, sweet cocoa, light coffee, again not as much as expected, a rich smooth bourbon hit, a little earthy, a touch of spice, and a bit of molasses. Hides its alcohol very well. I wouldn't have guessed it was 13.5%. 
M: Full body, moderate carbonation, very smooth. 
O: The coffee didn't come through as much as I was expecting, but I don't care. This beer was incredible. It's challenging for the best barrel aged stout I've ever had. 713 charactersRyanK252, Feb 07, 2015

A: Black, no light enters the beer, dark brown head, very little carbonation, head is creamy, very little lacing, looks world class!
A: Big coffee aromas, chocolate, roasted malts, noticeable alcohol on the end, bourbon, not getting any sweet aromas, all dark roasted chocolaty coffee aromas, smells outstanding.
T: Big coffee up front, chocolate, roasted malts, bitter, alcohol is very noticeable at 13.5%, finishes dry, world class.
M: Viscous, full bodied mouthfeel, like drinking oil, world class.
O: This is a world class beer, just like I like my stouts, coffee, chocolate, full bodied mouthfeel, the alcohol is a little hot but that may decrease with age, I must go back and buy more, a world class stout, very drinkable, smooth.

This is easily in the top 5 for the most difficult to remove corks. The brew appears black with a fine edge of brown clarity around the perimeter when held to the light. The cap is dark brown about a finger strong that fades leaving spotty lace.
Initially the aroma is super fudge-like smelling of brownie or chocolate cake batter. All milk chocolate, some roast and earthy char/coffee. As it warms up, some booze emerges along with caramel/vanilla oakiness. This smells so sweet, its hard to believe its beer...until you take a sip.
The taste is milk chocolate blending to a dark fruity rasiony alcohol aspect with complimenting bourbon, slight citrus coffee and neutral woodiness faintly in the aftertaste. Whereas the nose is out of control sweetness, its a pleasant reassurance that the flavor is not that sweet, though it is boozy and roasty. The aftertaste is bitter from a combination of strong coffee, roasted grain and subtle herbal hops.  As the beer warms up, it becomes a sort of smokey molasses monster and I like it a lot.
This is medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. An impressive rift on serpent stout. The belgian influence is still recognizable in this, though the alcohol is really ramped up and the chocolate is almost...almost too dominating. The coffee is still evident in this though it seems a bit faded yet still works. I really enjoyed this and certain would drink it again if the opportunity presented itself. 1,521 charactersstakem, Jan 09, 2015

When you taste it, you get a lot of pure dark chocolate that is both bitter and sweet. It also has a strong roasted malt presence and a light oak that adds some complexity. The vanilla is strong and adds a sweetness that balances out with some fresh coffee. The body is thick and creamy with a slight mild astringency in the finish from the coffee. 443 charactersjeonseh, Nov 18, 2013

The nose is awesome, with huge coffee and cocoa flavors. Boozy bourbon, roast and caramel notes lend support. Palate is fantastic. The coffee brings a nutty/earthy character that works fantastically with the bittersweet chocolate. There's a ton of bourbon and a decent amount of heat. Roasty, caramelized and rich. This may be the best of the box set beers. 420 characterslargadeer, Apr 08, 2013

Pours am opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is much the same with a coffee flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors that make it super easy to drink. 611 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 11, 2013

Pours a thin dark chocolate brown with a thin light tan/mocha head that fades to a thin collar and splotchy film. Aroma of vanilla, fresh roast coffee, cocoa, baker's chocolate, mocha, rubbing alcohol and maybe there is some beer underneath this somewhere. Flavor is thin and mocha coffee like, powdery and boozy. Bourbon, vanilla and milk chocolate predominant. Let's be honest, there isn't much here that tastes like beer, just an amalgamation of flavors that taste good in any context (ice cream, coffee, cake, raw, a hooker's abdomen), that EVISCERATE the base beer. 585 charactersyourefragile, Feb 23, 2013

This beer is nice, but if you are a coffee fan like starrdogg and Huhzubendah (Matt and Matt) are, you'd be in heaven with this one. 
Dark brown to black in color, this beer has a ring of white head and just the slightest amount of lacing. 
The smell reminds one of KBS or similar bourbon coffee stouts, but this is exceptional even on that scale. This is a fudgy coffee bourbon roasted treat. 
The taste is coffee, coffee coffee and the mellow bourbon soaked dark chocolate malt shines through. Did i mention coffee? Might be a little much for me, but tasty nonetheless. 
Solid feel, medium nothing offensive, A very nice beer. 742 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 25, 2013

This is one of the entries in their rock-themed Ultimate Box Set collection. This beer is their Serpent's Stout, aged in bourbon barrels, with coffee and cacao nibs added.
Score: 97
2012 vintage bottle served in a 4 oz taster glass at FOBAB 2012 (11/17/12). Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Jet black in color with thin layer of mocha head. Average lacing and retention. 3.5/5
Smell: Tons of coffee, then ample doses of chocolate. Molasses too. Faint vanilla. 4.5/5/5
Taste: Boat loads of coffee upfront and followed by cacao, milk chocolate and maple. Vanilla and bourbon comes through on the midpalate, followed by even more coffee in the finish. Has an aftertaste of "coffee breath." Truly divine! 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Just shy of full bodied. Low carbonation. Excellent balance between the coffee bitterness and bourbon sweetness. 4.5
Overall: Is it world class? Absolutely. I believe that this was one of the five best beers at FOBAB, which was absolutely stacked with great beer. This beer reminded me a lot of (a good bottle of) CBS. On the other hand, was it worth the $35 per bottle that each beer in the Lost Abbey Ultimate Box Set ultimately costs? Not when beers like Eclipse 18 and Chocolate Rain cost the same price for twice as much beer.
Recommendation: If you have the cash to spare, this is a must-try brew.
Pairings: Waffles and syrup.
Cost: $35 for a 375 ml bottle ($450 for all 13 beers in the Lost Abbey Ultimate Box Set). 1,535 charactersjegross2, Dec 17, 2012

Beer pours black with a thin off-white head. Smell is awesome - an excellent mix of coffee, oak and bourbon - it reminds me a lot of KBS. Flavor is very coffee-forward, but manages not to be too bitter because the oak balances out the flavors. Chocolate and bourbon come through on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice carbonation. This is one of the best coffee stouts I've had as the barrel aging manages to keep the coffee from completely overtaking the beer, but still gives it a phenomenal flavor. 553 charactersstarrdogg, Dec 10, 2012

The beer appears black with a thin beige cap. The aroma...wow! Coffee and roast - so fresh and wonderful. An instant 5 in the aroma category. Bourbon and oak come in after the delectable coffee, giving balance and complexity. The flavor does not disappoint. A remarkable beer. Bourbon is perhaps a bit overshadowed by coffee, but as a daily coffee drinker, I can't complain. Medium bodied with masterfully disguised alcohol content. Shockingly good. Just outstanding. My highest recommendation. 526 charactersHuhzubendah, Dec 10, 2012

Black as night; thick as hot cocoa. An incredibly dark, foamy head subsides to a graham cracker ring within a few seconds.
Almost acidic nose. The coffee in this is like torched espresso. Huge vanilla, vinous oak, chocolate syrup. A touch of dark cherry. Something harsh within.
Massive chocolate sweetness rounds out what seems like will be a continuation of the acrid nose. A touch of smoke, a lot of ethanol. Green oak, chocolate crumbles, vanilla bean. Just a touch too green in the oak. Sweet, balanced finish.
Flawless victory. Delicious. Not incredible, needs a little more depth. But a nice dessert treat. 659 charactersPhelps, Nov 22, 2012

A: Pours a dark black color with a very dark tan head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to a thick ring that leaves some splotchy lace.
S: Huge notes of fresh coffee bean, chocolate, roasted malts and espresso. There is a faint barrel smell in the background, but this is heavily dominated by the coffee and chocolate.
T: The taste follows the nose with a more roasted malt presence and touch more barrel. Vanilla espresso, freshly ground coffee beans, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Some light oak with just a kiss of bourbon. Booze is hidden extremely well.
M: Medium low carbonation with a heavy mouthfeel. Decadent and creamy.
O: While this beer was lacking the in your face bourbon barrel we've all come to love I think this limited barrel actually worked with this beer. It made the coffee and cocoa flavors the stars of the show. I'd love to try this again. 929 charactersTreebs, Nov 22, 2012

A - Thin tan foam settles to a thinner collar. Very dark brown body that is opaque from most angles.
S - Coffee, oak, whiskey, dark roast, dark chocolate, espresso, anise, and a touch of char. Very heavy on the wood, and perhaps a touch of alcohol, but on the whole quite excellent. Just leaps out of the glass.
T - The taste is a tad more balanced, with some light baker's chocolate, vanilla, nut, and caramel sweetness to offset the espresso, roast, and oak flavors. Alcohol is better disguised here, but might lack the intensity of the aroma bit.
M - Medium-full body, roasty, dry, charry, and tannic. Minimal alcohol heat, which is nice, but slightly evocative of drinking a cup of coffee when it comes to texture. Lower carbonation.
D - Awesome beer. I know this was a previous experiment that was co-opted into the box set, so there's no excuse not to make more of this one. Would happily attempt to take down a 375ml bottle on my own. 1,057 charactersMasterSki, Nov 22, 2012

The Lost Abbey
San Marcos, CA
Pitch black with only the thinnest layer of small brown bobbles atop. Thick and substantial looking, with very little visible carbonation. This leaves thin smatterings/ribbons of lace down the glass.
Huge amounts of fresh ground, roasted coffee beans. This is perhaps the most coffee-forward aroma I've ever found in a beer--like sticking your nose in a coffee grinder, along with big notes of chocolate, and very mild bourbon. Fantastic aroma; transformed.
Again, the layers of coffee and chocolate lead the way here. The coffee has nice, earthy, freshly roasted notes, along with dark chocolate. Low to moderate bitterness, and the alcohol is hidden extremely well, given this beer's magnitude. The bourbon barrel is only mildly present. This is a coffee stout, first and foremost.
Perhaps a touch thinner than traditional Serpent's Stout, but not by much. Full in body low carbonation. Creamy and decadent.
Superb. 967 charactersehammond1, Oct 23, 2012

a - Pours a dark brown, almsot black color, with one inch of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks pretty great.
s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, bourbon, cocoa and chocolate, light oak, and light dark fruits. Pretty nice, coffee seems to dominate the nose.
t - Tastes of sweet milk chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, oak, coffee, toasted malts, and light sweet dark fruits. Awesome taste; chocolate comes through heavily, and the bourbon and vanilla is awesome.
m - Medium to full bodied stout and low to moderate carbonation. Super smooth and creamy, and insanely easy to drink. Can't believe this one is 12.5% ABV; pretty perfect mouthfeel.
o - Overall a fantastic beer; one of the highlights of the day. A huge improvement on the normal Serpent Stout. Awesome taste with the sweet chocolate mixing wonderfully with vanilla and bourbon, and a perfect, smooth mouthfeel. Would love to have this one again sometime. 1,075 charactersmdfb79, Feb 11, 2012

Black as you can get on the pour, a minimal tan head. The chocolate and coffee really add something to this and take away a bit of the booziness. Lots of whiskey and vanilla notes are still present, however. A touch of dark fruit in the background. The whiskey still cuts through the flavor along with some vanilla. Heavy on the chocolate and coffee with notes of raisin and burnt sugar. 414 characterswomencantsail, Jan 24, 2012

A: Pours a deep mahogany to black with a medium brown head, spotty lacing.
S: Amazing, smells like the most decadent chocolate cake I've ever had with a splash of Kahlua.
T: Lots of luscious milk chocolate and brown sugar. Definite vanilla and bourbon notes. A smorgasbord of good classic Double Stout flavours. Delicious.
M: Full-bodied, creamy, not a trace of the 12.5%. Soft carbonation and soothing.

On tap at Strong Ale 2011.
A: Black with a big dark brown head.
S: Earthy, nutty coffee with caramel and dark chocolate. Bourbon blends wonderfully with coffee and cocoa. Malt is strongly roasted with a slight burnt note. Oak is pronounced and vanilla lingers in the background.
T: Dark chocolate meets earthy black coffee, caramel, and bourbon. The coffee is really strong, but it doesn't overwhelm the barrel notes. There's a nutty note with oak and a little vanilla. I get a light astringency on the back end. Alcohol is well hidden.
M: Full body with upper moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky with a lot of warming.
Overall: Very good. This was probably the best beer at the fest.
