Pours typical New England hazy orange juice with nice lacing. 
Aroma-  due to age the aroma is a little muted.  I bet this would smell amazing fresh.  
Taste-  still very good . The Columbus-mosaic combo works nicely together.  Dank with berry.  Spicy bite that hits you late.  Not bitter but spicy
Mouthfeel is creamy juicy.  Well done as always by trillium
My overall rating would be higher with fresher sample but it is a very good beer just the same 497 charactersjcflorian, Mar 17, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this one through a trade with my buddy Matty.  Lucky for me he spends a fair amount of time in Boston for work.  Really love the look of this beer, a murky orange than is hazy to the point that I can't see the other side of the glass. About an inch of head that lasted about a minute but, gave way to some nice lacing.  Very tropical citrus smell but DEFINITELY picking up that hint of green onion, not something you would expect but it's an interesting touch.  For a double dry hopped IPA this is super smooth. Tastes juicy with pineapple and grapefruit prominently featured with a hoppy and slight honey finish.  Very soft feel here with a comfortable amount of carbonation.  This is a phenomenal brew. I am an IPA guy for sure but that has very little to do with my review.  This beer looks beautiful, smells delightful and unique, and tastes delicious.  Fair warning Matt, next time you head to Boston you might be coming back with a case of this for me if it's available! 980 charactersGreyvtrayn, Mar 06, 2017

The taste followed suit with a huge fruity, hoppy, smooth juice bomb. And to top it off the look in the glass was hazy and very "orange juice" like. This was quite a treat. 289 charactersmjpolzin, Feb 11, 2017

Smell is tropical, although I wish I'd have let this warm a touch before diving in. Luckily, I have 3 more :) 
Edit: I left the can out on the counter for 5-10 minutes before opening and pouring- made a nice difference. 
Taste is NE IPA gold on double dry hopped steroids. 
Feel is equal parts smooth and crisp. Mucho Juicy-yo
Overall does not disappoint, which says a lot. #bigfan 476 charactersnuggetlover, Feb 08, 2017
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour is that typical hazy medium orange, trillium look. Extra frothy head with nice lacing. Tropical fruit forward in the aroma, virtually no malt presence. Mango, melon, pinneapple, honey, kiwi. Taste follows the nose well, getting hints of blueberry and tangerine from the mosaic, but not as mosiac forward as cutting tiles. The Columbus balances this out. Mouthfeel is pillowy and soft as usual. Fantastic beer, one of the more tropical fruit forward ones I've had from them. 478 charactersMateo2699, Feb 08, 2017

More juicy juice from the streets of Boston - lots of citrus on the nose, maybe a bit of something akin to white wine, too? Followed by more of the same on the sip, with suggestions of pale melon rind and even a hint of something green, crisp and vegetal around the edges... Medium-feel and weight with ample carbonation and a subtle bittering that coats the tongue on the finish. Solid... 454 charactersGreywulfken, Feb 06, 2017

This is great but regular Mechler Street, I feel, is just danker and juicier. I had high hopes that this would end up being my all time favorite, but it fell short. Nothing wrong with this brew at all. It is still better than most IPAs. Hell, most beers overall too. 290 charactersLloydDobler, Feb 05, 2017

Trillium made an extremely smart strategic decision to expand to Canton at the right time.  Their beers are as good as Treehouse (and more varied and experimental), yet I don't have to stand in the cold for an hour to pick up 5-6 beers.  That gets old.  I appreciate the short wait at Trillium, ability to pick up a case if I want to, cool atmosphere, solid customer service and awesome brews. 577 characterscrotharagain, Jan 31, 2017

A: The beer is a cloudy orange/gold color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of citrus and caramel that are quickly followed by a strong floral hops bitterness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA to drink for a long time. 774 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 31, 2016

smell is really good but i expected a lot more for a DDH IPA. upper case smells better.
taste is really good. loads of mango and pineapple with a slight bitterness at the finish. 
mouthfeel is amazing. perfect carbonation as expected.
overall, another reason why i love trillium. they have the perfect balance of juicy and hoppy. too much juicy makes the beer just like my morning orange juice. not really that good. 437 charactersjooler, Dec 12, 2016

Pours light gold with medium haze, minimal white head and good lacing, smells like orange blossoms, grapefruit zest with hint of peach and mango, borderline peppery dank at the end, tastes like orange/tangerine flesh with mild boozy peach and  mango that finishes with bitter peppery dank grapefruit pith, feel is medium light with creamy carbonation and a dry finish. This beer tastes like a eating a half grapefruit with sugar and weed sprinkled on top. 502 charactersChipChaight, Nov 24, 2016

The smell is obviously hoppy with notes of tropical fruits and subtle dank aromas. The taste is also quite hoppy, it's still very good for the style. The feel smooth and very drinkable. Overall It's awesome, I'd drink it anytime. 327 charactersKnapp85, Nov 24, 2016

Taste is also huge papaya, mango, and wet hops.  Medium bodied and carbonation with slight bitterness.  I cannot get over how much more I like this than Melcher Street.  The double dry hopping makes this a delightful juicy treat. Delicate and complex. This may be one of my favorite Trillium beers. 410 characterstigg924, Nov 23, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Among the most drinkable of the great NE hop bombs.  It's got much that one would expect in such an offering:   intense tropical fruit, hints of citrus, plenty of hop bitterness.  Sometimes--and that can be a great thing, to my mind--those combos can be overpowering.  WIth Dry Hopped Melcher St,  the combination is intensely flavorful and yet--and this, too, is great, in a different way--smooth and balanced.  Slightly maltier than Mettle, the other Trillium IPA I've had.  They're batting two for two.  I'm ready for more of their offerings. 545 charactersprofessorchow, Nov 14, 2016

Pours deep gold and hazy with a small amount of hop particles floating around in the beer before eventually sinking to the bottom. Tall white head that leaves some sticky lacing behind.
Pleasant aroma of orange citrus fruit and fresh hops. It really does smell like a clementine. Flavor is all hops and citrus fruit as well with just the slightest bit of malt in the background trying to provide some balance but failing. Soft in the finish and bitter. Easily the most drinkable of the Trillium beers I've had.  This one has its own character to it, which I've been struggling to find in their other offerings. 638 charactersJacobob10, Oct 25, 2016

Pours turbid gold with a fluffy white head. Minimal retention and lacing.
Bright oranges, pineapple, mango, and candied grapefruit in the nose. Pungent, floral, and tropical. Medium bodied with a crisp but somewhat silky mouthfeel. Tropical fruit aplenty on the palate. Pithy grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, and mango. Low bitterness and bone dry.
Finishes with lingering juicy hops and mildly warming,
Another great one from Trillium.  A hop bonanza and very crushable. 486 charactersbrewandbbq, Sep 20, 2016

Appearance: pours an incredibly vibrant and glowing orange color. One of the best looking Trillium beers out there, and that's saying a lot. This one really pops. Thin, off-white head on top, which leaves lots of sticky lacing.
Aroma: pours out of the can the second it's cracked. Loads of fruit. Mosaic hops bang, along with the Columbus.....woof, it's heavy on the fruit. 
Taste: did I say heavy on the fruit? Loads of citrus here, with orange (Columbus!!), tangerine, some mild spice notes from the Mosaic, some pineapple. Also, the flavors are extremely soft and smoothie-like.
Feel: soft, with mild to medium carbonation. Drinks smooth as silk, and finishes with very mild bitterness.
Overall: this is one of the best Trillium IPAs, which is a high task. 814 charactersTheElectricOne, Sep 03, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy pale yellow orange color with some clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Resiny pine, earthy, spicy, tropical, cantaloupe, melon, herbal, wheat, caramel, and breay.
Taste:  Awesome mosaic hop flavor.  A little onion/garlic flavor but you got a nice malt bill to back things up.  Slight chewy notes and light bitterness in the rear.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium bodied, a little chewy, light tingly bitterness, medium carbonation, and very delicious.
Overall:  Got to admit that I like both versions of this beer.  Super awesome and I look forward to the next batch.  Wowzah. 806 charactersFlounder57, Jun 08, 2016

Pours a decent creamy foamy almost 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, murky milkshake sunrise golden orange pale color.
Nose the very first instant I got some juicy citrus and tropical notes, but almost immediately following that big-bang time frame of instance it turned into pine resin sap, earthy pine forest floor and green onion vegetal mess, yeah there are some melon rind papaya and faint pineapple tropical notes, super green underripe melon rind, a little tangerine flesh, a little pith, but mostly the bad mosaic trouncing it.
Taste again first flash brings tropical citrus, some tangerine and orange juice, a little pith, etc, but then quickly back into pine sap forest floor, more mosaic slapping everything in the face with it's dick, just pissing all over the rest of the nice flavors. Mixed in the background is more melon rind, nice juicy but under ripe "green" melon, with more tropical notes a little papaya pineapple, etc. Thankfully the pine sap resin mosaic doesn't last too long as the hops turn spicy, some more citrus orange flesh and pith notes, big a big spicy chewy hop character. Also is a little malt but the malt even seems light, a touch creamy, but compared to the Summer St it's just lacking. Finish is a bit drier, tons more of that spicy chewy hop with some green onion in there.
Mouth is med to lighter bod, touch creamy, decent but lighter carb.
Overall, compare to the double dry hopped Summer st this could have been made by ABInbev for all I know. This was such a huge letdown, poor malt character, lower carb, but the worst was that crazy terrible mosaic character, which thankfully wasn't too bad in the flavor but definitely destroyed everything else. I really really REALLY don't understand how people like that!!! 1,961 charactersjlindros, May 26, 2016

Appearance - Pours a golden orange, darker in color than many others in Trillium's portfolio. It resembles a sunburst effect as it's almost radiant. The head large and composed of soapy, disjointed bubbles with really good retention and lacing.
Aroma - The aroma nearly jumps out of the glass as I draw closer to it as if it's begging to be released. Huge amounts of tropical fruits and pine resin fill the nose and it has a decidedly complex twist to it rather than just being a juice bomb. Wet and dank.
Taste - The flavor is all delicious hops of every variety. At first is the fresh hops that range from grapefruit, pineapple, peach, and mango. Next is that wet, dank pine note that contributes a nice kick to aforementioned fruits. It never comes across as one-dimensional and as it warms the play between the hop flavors is accentuated. There's no harsh hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is essentially perfect. It is substantial and has just enough carbonation to keep the flavors pumping. Smooth and creamy.
Closing Arguments - Overall this could be giving Scaled Way Up a run for its money as my favorite Trillium IPA. The hop characteristics are spot-on throughout and each sip is a joy. 1,228 charactersnhindian, May 18, 2016

As soon as I cracked open the bottle, I could smell citrus.  Pineapple, orange, mango.  This beer is not the best beer Trillium makes, but definitely a top 5.  Nice citrus up front with the taste.  I feel it is lacking a little after taste, but that is being picky.  Enjoy this one. Cheers! 351 charactersjtomacchio, May 07, 2016

I just don't think I can rate the look of this beer highly. Other than that, it was a great experience. I preferred this to most of the treehouse offerings, but not by a whole lot. I wish there was a little more bitterness on the back end, but no complaints. 287 charactersbcp5296d, Apr 19, 2016

This one pours a hazy golden yellow, with a big head, and lots of lacing.
Smells very sweet and hoppy, tons of tropical and citrus fruits, very classically Mosaic, with very little bitterness on the nose.
This is very delicious, but not my absolute favorite from Trillium, as Mosaic is not always my favorite hop. It's got a candied citrus, super heavy duty, with essentially no bitternes at all. I would prefer a bit more bitterness on the finish, but it's not there.
This is medium bodied, super juicy and creamy, with a normal level of carbonation.
Very tasty, but not upper tier Trillium. 648 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 11, 2016

Aroma is insane! Huge orange juice, fresh pineapple notes along with passionfruit, mango, melon, peach, apricot and tons and tons of juicy tropical and citrus notes. Smells so damn good.
Taste is also a massive amount of fresh pineapple, sweet oranges, mango, melon, passionfruit, nectarine, peach. Like a tropical fruit smoothie! Super intense and a nice dank and slightly piney finish to it as well. 
Medium bodied, slightly creamy mouthfeel, moderate bitterness and so easy to drink.
Just another amazing Trillium beer! These guys never seem to disappoint! 661 charactersJohnnyMc, Apr 02, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle. Served in a HF stemmed glass.
Pours a hazy and superbly cloudy darker yellow-lighter orange body, two finger white head, great retention, lots of lacing and a medium collar. Apropos for the so called NE-style IPA. Smells of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, citrus, grapefruit zest, a bit of peppery spice, minimal grainy cereal pale malt sweetness. The aroma is killer, and typical of Trillium's DDH lineup. Flavour is equally grapefruit-forward, absolutely juicy, a bit of lemon, mild-moderate bit of zesty bitterness on the finish. Really nicely done, with a mild grainy pale malt sweetness on the backend. A very nice expression of hops followed by a nice zesty bitterness on the finish. Wonderful. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, appropriately carbonated for the style, dangerously easy to drink, with a zesty bitterness on the finish (as mentioned before). Lots of depth and juiciness to this beer. Again, I don't understand why people go crazy over Treehouse when Trillium keeps churning these out at case limits. Sure, the large formats aren't as economical, but come on now. 1,103 charactersStevedore, Mar 31, 2016

S - Fresh tropical fruit aromas dominate the nose.  A huge pineapple aroma at first with lighter melon and peach notes also coming through.  Fresh and juicy.  
T - Fresh pineapple, melon and peach notes with a bit of a dank flavour coming through.  A big bitterness at first is restrained mid-palate the perfect honey sweetness compliment.  The finish is juicy and dry.  Fantastic.
M - Full of hop oils.  Medium body.  Light to moderate carbonation.  Dry finish. 616 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Mar 16, 2016

F: Moderate to heavy body (for an IPA) with ample carbonation; not quite a 'milkshake', but close for the style
O: Awesome. This was one of the most artfully crafted exhibitions of the Mosaic hop that I've come across. Absolutely beautiful. Columbus hops take a back seat to the star here, but overall if you're a Mosaic hop lover you need to try this beer. Across each category this really stacked up with the best. Well done. 765 charactersFireman_RK, Mar 05, 2016

Some peach and pineapple in the aroma. It tastes like what I would imagine a pineapple creamcicle would taste like, with just enough underlying bitterness. It feels a bit thin and stale. I've had it fresh and it's been great, but this bottle is feeling the age a little bit.
I will update my score upon having a fresher bottle, but the fact that this can't hold for just over a month is a shame.
Fresh can - updated rating - tastes like a melon dream. Not perfect, but terrific and something I'd drink all the time. Very little bitterness. 627 charactersSheppard, Nov 10, 2015

4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter.  It's pretty smeared but I'm pretty sure the label reads 09/24/15.
A- Pours a hazy dark amber, almost light brown color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of bubbly surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves large bubbly clots behind.
S- Very unique hop aroma.  Pretty sure there's some amarillo in there but there also might be some of those really earthy, dank hops like warrior or tomahawk, not sure.  Somewhat sweet smelling.  Edit: looked it up and it's actually mosaic and columbus.  Pretty sure the columbus is providing those earthy tones.  
T- Not quite as intense as the aroma, but this definitely has more of that herbal, woody hop profile. Medium-high bitterness.  The malty sweetness does a good job of balancing the big hop flavors.
M- A bit dry with a prickly feel from the hops.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the fuller side.
O- A different approach to the style and I really like it.  With this beer I've come to find that I really like Columbus hops.  This beer has great drinkability while still having a strong hop presence. 1,212 charactersImmortale25, Oct 18, 2015

Pretty filthy in the body with a murky copper body. Incredibly foamy head and excellent lacing swing things upward a bit. 3
Fresh cut pineapple hits immediately, but then it gets cat pissy, oniony, earthy and vegetal. 3.5
Yeah this is oniony. Light mango and pineapple but pretty subdued and perhaps even overshadowed by some resinous, earthy flavors. Garlicky finish. 3.75
Pretty damn bitter. Resinous and a tad spicy. Not what I usually get from Trillium. Drinks light and easy so there's that. 3.75

Pours a hazy orange body with a big frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave behind nice chunky retention and lacing that melds together. This is what a DIPA should look like. 
Aromas are HUGE and POTENT - HUGE citrus and raw fresh hop acids, bursting fruit to bring you into a temporary tropical paradise. Pineapple, grapefruit, peach, oranges, passionfruit..
Oh man, the tongue matches the aromas on the nose with delicious citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, and passionfruit with a fresh hoppy zing from the dry hopping on the follow through, with a light bitterness on the finish. Wow that's good. Medium body and carbonation. 
Overall a fantastic, world class beer and one of the best IPAs I've ever had. My favorite Trillium so far. 873 charactersgcamparone, Oct 05, 2015

Pumpkin colored, hazy, fizzy, with a bountiful foamy head that doesn't want to stay in my glass. S: This is the best smelling beer I've ever smelled - the only 5.00 I've ever given. Fruit, sex and fresh baked bread... words totally fail me (not in time to stop me from typing that it smells like sex, but still). T: Follows the nose, delightfully, with sharp pine notes, dank, sharply bitter and delicious. F: Like cream soda, medium body, smooth and with the ideal amount of carbonation. O: The regular Melcher Street was good but this is mind blowing. I'm torn between jamming my nose as far into the glass as it will go and taking a nap in it or sucking the whole bottle down as fast as I can. 736 characterspapposilenus, Oct 01, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from a bottle poured into a tulip. I just reviewed standard Melcher and had another bottle to compare to this one side by side.  The nose couldn't get much better than the standard, so new improvement on that score of my other review. The taste though - more bitterness on the ddh for the better. The tropical fruit, grapefruit, and slight peachiness are still there, but there is a huge dose of dankness and earthy bitterness that round out the flavor in a fantastic way. As with many trillium beers, the carbonation in the bottled offerings do the beer service. My standard Melcher review was a little lower because I thought it laid too heavy on the palette from the growler. But really, I'm splitting hairs here. This version is better, but all of there hoppy offerings are just head and shoulders above anything else out there. 841 characterssoze47, Sep 27, 2015

Pours far clearer than any Trillium brew I've had. Honestly, I was a little surprised. Light amber, tinted orange, body with a finger of fluffy white head. Nose is full of dank weediness, tropical fruits, and peach. Taste follows suit. A delicious beer with an inviting mouthfeel. Another Trillium home run. That part wasn't a surprise. 422 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Sep 26, 2015

The below notes generally hold true but ratings have changed. The beer has definitely improved after 15 days in the can but it no longer seems to be an improvement on regular Melcher. To be fair Melcher Street IPA is my favorite regular offering from Trillium so the bar is pretty high.
Original 9/24/15 review: L: 4.25 S:4.75 T:4.5 F:4.5 O:4.75 Rating: 4.6
32 oz. Growler, that was filled today, poured into a tulip.
Pours a cloudy Orange in color with almost 2 fingers of rocky off white head, retention isn't great and there is sporadic lacing. Great aroma, lots of bright citrus, peach, and dank pine. Taste is more pine forward than the aroma but citrus and peach are still present. Hops really dominate, there is a solid bitterness towards the finish. Medium-light body and medium carbonation create and almost creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great beer, wonderful nose, very tasty and immensely drinkable. The dry hopping has made a noticeable improvement upon this beer. Another great IPA from trillium. 1,034 charactersmnj21655, Sep 25, 2015
4.56/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours cloudy golden orange with a three finger head.  Smells really citrusy like sweet orange, almost an orange creamsicle with dank pine and and earthy notes.  Taste is smooth with and chalk full of hops.  Citrus is very present, but the hops hog the spotlight.  Really delicious, highly, highly drinkable.  Light and fluffy mouth feel, goes down dry, bitter and easy.  Overall, like all "Double Dry Hopped" showings from Trillium, DDH Melcher Street is fantastic. 465 charactersanteatr23, Sep 24, 2015

S: Gorgeous sweet pink grapefruit, tropical notes, apricot, tangerine.
T: Apricot, tangerine, finishing with a moderate bitterness and a bit of sweetness on a long-ish finish.  Some green hop character.
M: Medium body and soft, light carbonation.  Some hop residue.  
O: Tasty stuff.  Great hop flavor (Mosaic?).  I actually think I preferred Melcher St. (as well as Vicinity) to this. 560 characterspmarlowe, May 22, 2015

This is the best beer I ever had.  I am pretty sure I drank it super fresh, even though I got it shipped in a trade because I have never seen anything like it.  Straight orange juice.  The kind with extra pulp.  The most opaque IPA I've ever had and now that is all I want in an IPA.   I've only had this beer once, but it is the beer I crave the most.  Drinking this was a religious experience.  The only straight 5 I've ever given on this site.
Trillium please send me more. 494 charactersSlothB77, May 20, 2015

The flavor is also very hop forward. Big hop flavor, little citrus notes, grapefruit, orange peel, some very subtle earthy hop tones in the background. The bitterness lingers for a little. Overall a good beer, very hoppy, and a wonderful aroma to it. 476 charactersMesa512, May 18, 2015

Super pungent, bitter (in a good way), floral, citrusy, piney, fresh cut grass, fresh alpine air, God's body odor...every aroma a hop could possibly contribute to a beer. Flavor is so much damn fresh fruit. It's actually kinda ridiculous. Fantastic, crisp, refreshing finish. Way too easy to drink. Just massive hops while at the same time being a complete beer, not one-dimensional. Has the body and some malt to remind you that this is actually beer, not hop juice. No alcohol presence. I'm happy this is a 750ml but still not enough!
I glanced at the beers to the right under "other American IPA examples"...it's just not fair. None of those can compare to something like this. Like two totally different styles. I'm starting to think it's a difference between filtration and non-filtration. 886 charactersGatch, May 16, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a gorgeous bright hazy gold with a touch of orange, a big fluffy white head.
The aroma is jumps out of the glass of huge(!) Mosaic. Kumquat, papaya, white peach, orange zest, yellow grapefruit, mango, a dankness in the back.
The flavor follows with a theme of dankness supporting the hops. Behind it is white peach, nectarine, grapefruit, orange drink, orange flesh and pulp, then onto lots of grapefruit pith and some astringency. The beer is quite dry with a medium minus pithy bitterness.
The best beer I've had from Trillium, even beating Upper Case when I had it side by side. A top 3 IPA for me. 622 charactersdar482, May 07, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75First off, this beer looks absolutely fantastic. Some aren't a fan of cloudy beers, but I love it. It looks like orange juice. 
The smell is interesting, extremely piney like fresh mowed grass, yet also rather citrusy. A lot of grapefruit and tangerine on the nose with just a hint of orange peel. 
The taste is a juicy atom bomb. Soooo much juicy flavor packed into this one. A lot of grapefruit and orange, with a peppery, spicy finish. Every sip leaves me wanting more. 
There's some medium carbonation with a lingering pepper taste that clings to your tongue like a dingleberry. Very dry with the alcohol being quite well hidden. Again, very dry, yet very smooth. Just what I like in an IPA. 
Overall another fantastic offering from Trillium. These guys sure know how to brew a high quality IPA. 803 charactersScaryEd, May 02, 2015

It is beautiful to look at, nice and cloudy in a glass even when held up to the light.   The smell is danky and has a bit of onion.  Tastes nice and hoppy.  I can barely detect any malt flavor.  I love the carbonation.  To me this beer is perfect. 313 charactersSellmatt, May 02, 2015

T: pine, bready biscuity malts, orange and grapefruit are evident. pepper from the hops

Pours a dull, golden orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a dense, one inch, bright white head that eventually dissipates into a consistent 1/8th inch cap.  A band of lacing and some swaths coat the bowl as the brew recedes.  Great nose - candied citrus notes upfront with a faint earthy/herbal quality towards the back.  Taste starts out slightly floral at first, followed by rind and a kiss of tangerine towards the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of crisp and a tinge of acidity that prickles the back of the throat and lightly stimulates the salivary glands.  The standard version of this beer is very good but the dry-hopping adds a great additional dimension.  Top notch. 777 charactersJwale73, Jan 23, 2015

The dry hopping really comes through in a big way. The nuance and delicateness of the hops is extraordinary. The nose is mango, sticky weed and cut grass.  Flavors keep unfolding and unfolding after each sip. Pineapple, straw, mango, dank weed. The whole affair is dry, but the finish especially tucks the flavors back in for the next sip. 458 charactersjjdc, Jan 18, 2015

Holy hell this is an amazing beer! Seek this out immediately, Trillium is seriously one of the best IPA breweries out there, not a doubt in my mind. Incredibly drinkable and smooth for the amount of hops used here, tons of danky aroma and sweet tropical fruit on the palate. The bitterness sticks to the tongue just slightly on the way down but it's hardly a gripe as this beer is near perfection 433 charactersM_chav, Jan 14, 2015
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
Bottled 010315
Served in a pint glass
The beer poured a hazy, glowing yellow ochre color with honey-ish highlights and was topped by a tight, fluffy, eggshell colored crown. Sea foam-like in appearance. As the head slowly dropped to a resilient cap of froth, thick rings of lacing coated the glass. This was definitely some of the most intense lacing I have ever seen.
The aroma was amazingly punchy. Lemon and white grapefruit rind dominated. Crisp, dry, white wine-like notes also came through strong. Undertones of tropical fruits were apparent as well. Passionfruit was most noticeable. Super juicy with loads of clementine and straight-up orange juice. Citrusy and bright. Good amount of mango. As the beer warmed, dank, weed-like notes came out strong. This reminded me a lot of fresh bud.
The flavor profile was incredibly fruity and juicy. Loads of lemon and citrus. Intense orange peel and mango notes were apparent. A touch dank and musty. Quite marijuana-like. Notes of white wine were noticeable as well. A dry Chardonnay came to mind. Lots of lemony tartness on the back end. The beer finished crisp, dry, lemony and slightly peppery with loads of white grapefruit-like pithiness. Somewhat acidic and moderately bitter.
For a 7.2% ABV IPA, the mouthfeel was somewhat lighter bodied than anticipated. Creamy, fluffy, slick and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a bright, sprightly effercescence.
Trillium Brewing never disappoints with their hoppy offerings, and Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street IPA is simply another feather in their cap. If you are a fan of hoppy beers that are fruity, wine-y, lemony and dank, then this beer should be right up your alley. Of all the Trillium beers I have sampled, this very well might be their most interesting offering to date. 1,882 charactersDamian, Jan 13, 2015

3.82/5  rDev -14.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Poured into a Sam Adams glass, from a 750 bottle dated 1/3/15.
Look is a hazy yellow, with spectacular lacing and head retention.
Aroma is melon juicy and notably musty.  Surprising amount of damp closet, which I don't remember from my first bottle last week.  Weird.
The taste is a touch melony at first, but a hot, spicy, dank,vegetal finish dominates, much like a mesclun salad.  A film of onion is the bizarre cherry on top of the finish.
The feel is sticky yet dry.
This one is all over the map.  Quite an adventure, with complexity enough to last two bottles.  In the end, it's a bit harsh and not juicy enough for my taste, but a nice brew nonetheless. 664 charactersstonermouse, Jan 12, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Pours a hazy, deep orange color with a strong, doughy head that is off-white. Lots of stretched, cloudy lacing. Aroma is plenty enticing but honestly not as intense and overpowering as I was expecting. Aromatically, I feel as though this one didn't take to the double dry hopping as well as the other Trillium brews that have withstood the same treatment. Still, it's fairly potent. Scent is heavy on citrus and spicy hoppiness. Marijuana, melon and pineapple. Some pastry malt. Flavor is on point; more so than the nose. The hops rush over me quickly but also never become too dramatically bitter. Trillium usually doesn't torch the palate with unnecessary bitterness. This tastes like a tropical fruit purée with a dash of the dankness. Mango, melon, peach, tangerine, hop-spice and some greens. Just enough welcoming, soft malt to even things out. The body is slightly creamy. The carbonation is mellow. High drinkability. I haven't had the normal Melcher in a while but I am unsure if this one equals it. Hard to say if the Double Dry Hopping really enhanced this one all that much but it's still tasty. 1,116 charactersVelvetExtract, Jan 10, 2015

Appearance: Slight chill haze on a pale straw gold. Head is white, creamy, and fluffy. Drops to a small cap and collar that lasts for the duration. Sticky notches of lacing. Moderate carbonation.
Smell: Dank weed. Tons of weed. Grapefruit oil, pine sap, and tropical fruit. Pineapple dominates with some solid tangerine, peach, and mango as well. Slightly sweet pale malt base with some mild bready elements. A touch of undercooked biscuit dough. Slightly earthy as well. Soft yeast in the back. Dank nose increases as it warms. They weren't lying with the double dry hop appelation.
Taste: Weed. Follows the nose. Malts are very slightly sweet and offer a nice backbone that quickly gives way to a lingering bitterness. Pine sap. Grapefruit zest and oil. Green tree branches and wet tobacco leaves. A touch of mint as well. Tropical elements from the nose are a bit subdued on the tongue. Some pineapple jumps through with a hint of peach on the end. Very slight earthiness coupled with a touch of hop spiciness. Vestiges of alcohol on the back. Just so much weed.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Slightly creamy with a clean finish.
Overall: Contact high achieved.
It's a super dank Trillium pale ale. It's a nose assault and retro-olfaction is it's best friend. Do it up. 1,333 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 08, 2015
