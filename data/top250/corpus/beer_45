4.27/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, dated 06/21/17... be groovy or leave man - presumably there should be a comma in there. Served in a tulip.
Pours a profoundly opaque, turbid, dull mango colour with a finger of soft, creamy head. Retention is pretty good and leaves a silky cap and a solid curtain of lacing. If NEDIPA is officially a style now, this is officially pretty much what it had ought to look like.
Smells of peach and pineapple and soft, yeasty, doughy white bread.
Taste is full-on boozy, juicy tropical fruit basket with a surprisingly assertive biscuity malt presence. Leafy, bitter green herbs and raw hops, underripe melon, finishes with dank and juicy bitterness.
Feel is clean and crisp for a double, no more than medium bodied and brightly carbonated. 
Overall, another reasonably terrific Tree House offering. I found it uncharacteristically raw, harsh and boozy which may be owing to its having just been canned a few hours ago. I should be more patient. Nah. It was mighty damn fine just the way it was. 1,013 characterspapposilenus, Jun 22, 2017

L: Hazy Blood Orangey juicyness
Smell: I pick up lots of Citrus fruit along with tropical fruits
Taste: Juice Bomb! 
Feel: Full bodied IIPA, starts out with juice. Ends with light juicy goodness without any bitterness. 
Overall: My favorite TreeHouse brew so far! Along with Haze and Alter Ego! I knew it would be great since I had already tried Alter Ego. Waited patiently knowing I would eventually come across it without having to make the 200+ mile trip up to the brewery. I would like to thank BA for making this possible, without you guys it would be much much harder to locate brews such as this! 852 charactersBush33186, Jun 17, 2017

L: 2F head with good retention, leaves a good amount of white soapy lacing on glass as well as a cap and ring. Beer is a very hazy deep orange/bronze.
S: Pineapple, passionfruit, perhaps some melon and berry notes. Some bready malts and a whole lot of piney, earthy dankness.
T: Follows nose. It's a seriously juicy, seriously dank hop-bomb, with just enough malt to prevent anything from running away. Flavors are soft and very rounded. Very, very slightly bitter finish.
F: Medium bodied perhaps even a bit more. Very little in carbonation, so the dank runout just lasts and lasts. Superb construction and balance as the flavors all play nice with each other. 
O: Can actually see this being a problem for some, as you have to like the NE style to really get the most out of this beer, but it delivers it. 878 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jun 05, 2017

4.38/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Traded for this recently, as the beer had a date of 4/27 with "STILL GONNA" written above it and "SEND IT!" written below it. I love all of the other Tree House beers that I've had over the years and this one was no exception as it just kept getting better as it warmed up. It was one of those beers that didn't have anything outstanding in particular about it but when everything came together, the end result was a pint glass that didn't stay filled for very long!
Good pour to this had a dark and dank goldenrod hue to it with a very small amount of light seeping in around the edges. Lots of tropical fruit, pineapple, and citrus juice in the nose with all of those being present in the taste as well. Incredibly smooth with faint melon, mild fruit sweetness, and Mosaic hops all combining for a pleasing mouthfeel. Somewhat dry, faintly slick, and subtly bitter with Mosaic and melon in the aftertaste, this was deceptively easy to drink given the amount of alcohol present. Medium in body, the carbonation wasn't too powerful here as the flavors were allowed to mesh and linger before softly fading away after each sip.
If you love bombs of fruit that nearly taste like pure juice, this one's up your alley. There wasn't even much of any warming effect to be felt as the alcohol was in the background from start to finish. This was an awesome beer from the layers of thick lacing left on the side of my pint glass to the pulp and rind that could be felt through the liquid. Another solid offering from Tree House that proves why they're rated so highly! 1,561 charactersJerzDevl2000, Jun 04, 2017

The head is slightly off-white with good retention. The aroma isn't super prominent, but has tropical fruit presence. The taste is flush with huge tropical fruits as well- mango, guava, peach, orange, tangerine, with a hint of bitterness and resin on the finish. The feel is creamy and smooth, goes down very well with a hint of heat at the finish. Overall, an outstanding beer. The aroma left something to be desired, but the other categories more than make up for it. Treehouse living up to the hype once again! 614 charactersmattflippin, May 28, 2017

L- Thick soapy white colored head that stands 2 finger widths tall,with very good retention and bubbly lacing.Deep hazy colored body with low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.High amount of carbonation,and medium amount of sediment.
S- On the nose I get light dank pine,apricot,mango,grapefruit,mango,pineapple,and slight bready biscuit malt notes to balance it out.

4.55/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a murky, cloudy, completely-opaque dark-ish orange with two fingers of off-white head foaming on top. Great head retention, with tightly packed lacing left behind. Aroma is soaked to the core with hop notes, with a focus on citrus. Orange, tangerine, papaya, and lemon zest form a sort of Vitamin C nuke aroma. Flavor profile follows along, opening with orange and clementine, and then developing into a full armament of citrus notes - tangerine, papaya, peach, and apricot. Mouth feel starts out smooth and juice-like, but develops a sort of fizzy, graininess that is a little harsh as it warms on the tongue. Overall, flavor is an understatement here. Loads and loads of citrus qualities through both the aroma and flavor profile. It's a fun sipper of a beer, considering how easy it is to drink, and yet the breadth of hop notes it delivers. The clear dynamics in how the flavor profile ebbs and flows throughout the drinking experience is what sets it apart from other NE IPAs. Surprised to see this hits in at 8.2%, as it doesn't taste like it one bit. Wonderful. 
Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can. 1,118 charactersHarrison8, May 21, 2017

Was disappointed by this one.
Be honest. the cloudy look is not as attractive as a clear West Coast IPA.  As I understand it, one of the reasons for not filtering is to avoid losing some flavor from the filtration.  This is probably successful as the pine, citrus and tropical notes were very noticeable; however, the loss of crispness is not worth it, IMHO.  The other reason for not filtering is to alter mouth feel.  I say "alter" instead of "enhance" because I did not see the mouth feel as an improvement.
I give them credit for creativity, as this is something worth trying.  It does have some complexity with the fruity nose, bitter hoppy IPA taste and bitter finish, along with a mouth feel I would describe as a milky, wheatiness.  The 8.2% ABV was scarcely noticeable. Oddly, the pine and citrus nose and flavors were what I liked most about it while drinking it, but the lingering memory of it is of the creamy mouth feel that I don't really like.
Admittedly, IPA is not my favorite style, but I do like it sometimes because it pairs so well with certain foods like hamburgers and pizza.  This offering's reduced crispness makes it pair less well with those foods, though it might pair better with certain other foods like Mexican.
Overall, I thought it was good, but I have no need to go to the trouble of acquiring it again, as I can think of a number of other IPAs I liked better.  In fact, good IPAs that pair better with burgers than this one can be had at the corner brewery these days. 1,686 characterswmartin, May 08, 2017

A- Pours a hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well.

T- Great duality between citrusy hop flavor, assertive bitterness and sweet malt backing.  Incredibly drinkable for the ABV.  Notes of peach, mango and papaya.  Big peach aftertaste.
M- Somewhat sharp from the hops but with a soft feel.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the fuller side.
O- This one's a home run.  While not all of Tree House's offerings don't do it for me, this is something special. 667 charactersImmortale25, Apr 27, 2017

4.7/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very murky orange, with low head.
The smell is chock full of fruit, stone fruit, pineapple, mango.
The taste is perfect. Hop bitterness mingles perfectly with all the pinepple and mango, and the finish is quite floral and grassy.
Mouthfeel is soft and fluffy. When reviewing NE style IPAs, you kind of feel like a broken record when it comes to mouthfeel.
Doppeglganger is a another world class beer from Tree House. The taste is perfect, and the 8,2 ABV is nowhere to be found. 490 charactersJamFuel, Apr 19, 2017

Look is a orange, hazy, but not overly hazy colored brew with good lacing.  Poured a half inch thick head.
Smell is stone fruit, juice, and a touch of hops...a hint of pine which is nice 
Taste follows the nose.  Amazing beer.  One of my favorite beers ever, and top 3 tree house beers.  Stone fruit, mango, juicyness and hops.
Mouth feel is medium bodied with a slow aftertaste,  
Overall, excellent. I am glad I got two of them.  Definitely worth the hype. 496 charactersJay_P22, Apr 08, 2017

This one pours a pretty super hazy orange-ish yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing.
Smells like stone fruit, lemon, mango, grapefruit, and a bit of pine.
This is super juicy and tangy and tasty, like most of Tree House's beers. There's some candied lemon, orange creamsicle, apricots, peaches, and oranges- you get the idea- it's super fruity. There's not much in the way of malt character, though. It's about 99% juice, there's not a ton of bitterness.
This is medium bodied, creamy, like hop soup, with a good level of carbonation.
Tree House beers almost always taste good. They're not always my preferred kind of IPA, but you can't deny that they're tasty and well made. 716 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 03, 2017

L: Hazy, cloudy, dense golden yellow
S: Tons of juicy aromas bursting out the top. Apricot, orange, sweetness, everything you can expect in a dank juice bomb
T: taste just like it smells, amazing! All the flavors are present but still holds its own as a 8% IPA. Super juicy but super well balanced. A true TH. 
F: For me, this is just as important as taste. The feel is wholesome, complex, thick, you feel like you are drinking an IPA. Nothing worse than a juice bomb with a thin mouthfeel. I want beer, not coolaid. This however, is perfect. Nice and dense in the glass. 635 charactersCee_McDee, Mar 31, 2017

On the palate, the brew showcases juicy hop notes more than any other. It's wonderfully approachable, dare say I a touch watery. There is a slight dank kiss on the back end. Incredibly drinkable for a DIPA. Very soft feel, although not the best Tree House has mastered in that department.
This ranks up there with the best of the hoppy brews Tree House has produced. 462 charactersRoguer, Mar 31, 2017

Hazy as all hell which is typical for a Tree House IPA with a straw yellow color. A bright citrus nose that gets you ready for your first sip. The taste is juicy up front with a mild bitterness on the finish. Slightly heavier mouth feel than most of the Tree House beers that I've had but probably because of the higher ABV. Overall a great beer that I will seek again in the future. 425 charactersBradfordStuckey, Feb 19, 2017
4.66/5  rDev +2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A: darker pale malt with some caramel colors added to the base most Tree House beers have.  Standard frothy head.  Sticky lacing. Visible sediment in my glass
S: aromas of blueberry and mango mixed with guava.  
T: blueberry bomb mixed with mango.  Tropical fruit but for me the blueberry notes really stand out as different from the bright , green and Pride and Purpose I have had in the past day here.  It's not as acidic as the others and much more well balanced. So far , I have to think this is my favorite from Tree House.  As it warmed it showed more similarities to Green.  Smooth and rounded and not as dry \ acidic as bright w/ Citra.   
M: The base is smooth and creamy with light carbonation.  The base is easy to sip and more drinkable than some of the other hop bombs that leave a massive amount of acidity in your stomach.
O; Overall I definitely can enjoy this beer more so than the others that are great but not on the same level as this one.  Highly recommended. 984 charactersalpinebryant, Feb 19, 2017

A: Pours a hazy medium-light gold with two fingers of pillowy off white head which slowly deflates over several minutes, leaving behind sloppy lacing.  Excellent retention.
S: Gorgeous saturated tropical (mango, guava) and citrus (tangerine, orange creamsicle) hops, with a bit of toasty malt in the background.  
T: Delicious mix of tropical and citrus hop flavor.  Finishes with a mild bitterness/dryness which balances some of the fruity flavors.  Has a bit of an unpleasant yeasty bite, as well.
M: Soft, creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation and body.  
O: Very good beer, with great hop flavor and mouthfeel.  I’d actually prefer this to have a bit more sweetness on the palate to complement the tropical/citrus hop flavors.  And I don’t find this to be particularly “juicy”. 855 characterspmarlowe, Feb 06, 2017

4.25/5  rDev -7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25appearance-Orange amber in color and turbid. Pours a dense two inch head.
aroma- Very fruity with peach, oranges, and mango aromas.
taste- Again very fruity to start with peach and juicy citrus flavors. There is some grassy/onion quality as well, but the fruit aspect is more noticeable. Towards the middle there's a little bit of bitterness, but its mild. The finish has more peach/citrus/mango and a bready malt which helps cut the sweetness and add balance. As it warms up there's an annoying yeasty flavor that throws things off.
feel- Low/medium carbonation and a medium/full feel. Typical for a TH ipa with a soft creamy texture, and a semi clean finish.
overall-   This is absolutely a great dipa and great example of the "style". It hits most of the key points: juicy, soft, and big on flavor/aroma.  Wish there more the "dank" (ie. more pungency/bitterness) aspect as in the description, which I think add more flavor and balance. Only real issue I had was the occasional off flavor which I assume was the yeast.  Great stuff though and easily on par with their best dipas. 1,086 charactersCTbrew32, Jan 16, 2017

Pretty gnarly looking with the haze and all, but there is a bit of light that does come through and the head is pretty amazing. Super dank and extra juicy in the nose and on the palate. Suggestions of pineapple, papaya, evergreen, mint, green tea, and blonde tobacco throughout. Warmth is there with more fruitiness from the alcohol, very tropical. A bit of a toasty malt element in the middle quickly disappears as the hops are in control. 
The sacrifice in appearance does not out weight everything else this beer has to offer. Another winner from Tree House. 599 charactersJason, Jan 10, 2017

Tight bubbled white head with excellent lacing. I'm getting a nice amount of blueberry in the aroma, reminiscent of most fresh mosiac IPA's. Nice amount of kiwi, papaya and melon present as well. Interesting honey and nectarine comes out more as it warms. The taste is typical of most TreeHouse offerings, with a slight more cracker-like sweet malt profile. Still a juice bomb nonetheless, plenty of tropical fruit. Not much complexity with the hop profile. Mouthfeel is a little palate coating, and finishes dry that leaves you wanting more. Another solid TH IPA, they truly never disappoint. 665 charactersMateo2699, Jan 01, 2017

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank the day after I brought it home from the brewery out of a TEKU.
Look: Deep orange color with just about the fullest haze you've ever seen. About a finger of fluffy, rocky head.
Aroma: Can definitely tell that there is mosaic in this beer. A little blueberry and orange up front quickly transitions to a refreshing herbal aroma.
Flavor: Wow! big juicy creamsicle character up front. Lots of orange. Leaves almost no bitterness on the finish. 
Mouthfeel: perfect medium to full mouthfeel. You can definitely tell that the base of this beer is Julius.
Overall(style points): Julius is my favorite beer of all time so I had high hopes for this and it definitely delivered. It tastes exactly what you would expect a Julius with Mosaic would taste like. 99.5 Points! 771 charactersMikeyMcD86, Dec 23, 2016

Aroma is excellent - smells like you are standing in the brewery. Waited in line 90+ minutes to get 5 cans 600+/- people in line on 12/21/16 on a 37 degree day. It was my first time there. The number of different fruit characteristics in this is amazing two+ finger head and nice lacing on the glass.

Aroma is minty and herbal with hops slight citrus zest and fruity alcohol.
Taste is fruity and zesty with herbal to minty hops. There is a bit of a green yeast bite to this but its not distracting. There also appears to be a bit more malt sweetness than the other ipas ive had from this brewery. 
This is medium to fuller bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. Not bad but not great either, just a decent, easy drinking DIPA. 634 charactersstakem, Dec 21, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Happy Repeal Day!  Pours a hazy yellow orange color leaning slightly towards the red spectrum.  Smell is predominantly citrus with orange predominating but you also get hints of lemon and lime; very different than Alter Ego which is more tropical fruit.  Taste follows the smell with a sweet citrusy front end that once again has orange predominating.  There is definitely a little more  bitter resiny bite to this beer but it is still super balanced and falls on the juicy side as opposed to the  piney hop resin side of some of the other very TH variants (Very Green for instance).  This is actually the first very variant that I have enjoyed more than the original brew.  The feel on this beer is medium bodied, silky, and balanced.  This beer is very reminiscent of regular Haze in the citrus forward nature of the beer.  The aftertaste is where it stands out as the resiny bite of the hops lingers for longer than most of the regular treehouse brews.  Even though, the beer is extremely balanced and is not overly bitter.  I definitely enjoy this brew over regular Alter Ego as there is much more going on and the flavors pop a bit more (I find alter ego to be a bit muted).  Great brew, as always from Tree House! 1,219 charactersAmguerra305, Dec 06, 2016

L:  A murky medium golden orange color with a two finger white head.  Nice full lasting glass lacing.
S:  Loads of tropical fruit with mango, guava, peach and some citrus.  I get some sweetness on the nose too.
T:  The tropical fruits are the show here.  Mango, guava, papaya, pineapple, peach and some candied orange.  Sweetness is bready and cracker like with some slight candied fruit, but not as much as I expected.  Finish leads into some bitterness with some pine and floral flavors and the finish ends up bone dry.  Great beer.
F:  Full, coating, prickly, nice alcohol and perfect carbonation.  Dry finish that leaves you satisfied.
O:  This is very, very good beer that deserves all it's rave reviews.  I am so glad I finally got to try some of the Treehouse beers thanks to some great trades, I can only hope to have more.  Fantastic. 898 charactersKadonny, Nov 28, 2016

Filled: NOV 19 2016
Served in a Tree House teku
Outstanding appearance. The cloudy, dark yellow ochre body was topped by a super tight and creamy, two-finger tall, off-white crown. The head slowly dropped to a thin film. Copious amounts of sticky, craggily lacing stuck all along the glass.
The nose was fantastic. Super hoppy and fruity. Peach and nectarine notes dominated initially. Really punchy and fairly sweet. Big citrus presence too. Juicy orange notes came through big time. Some tangerine as well. Bit of dank, weed-like character.
The flavor profile was equally as amazing. Loads and loads of sweet peach, apricot and nectarine on the front end. Juicy orange and tangerine notes appeared in the center. Some mango too. Bit of orange zest on the finish. Just the slightest hint of bitterness for balance.
The mouthfeel was ridiculously creamy and smooth. Super soft and fluffy. The liquid contained a super fine, zippy effervescence that frothed up beautifully on the palate.
As much as I enjoyed Julius and King Julius, Doppleganger's intense dankness and punchy stone fruit notes impressed me even more. This beer definitely falls into my top three favorite hoppy Tree House releases. 1,312 charactersDamian, Nov 21, 2016

Aroma is really hoppy with an interesting citrusy and grassy/herbal profile. Taste follows, lots of grassy hops, peaches, medium to light bitterness on the finish with lingering pink grapefruit. Full bodied with smooth mouthfeel. Really nice one but I think I liked Alter Ego more. 326 charactersCiocanelu, Oct 29, 2016

Aroma:  papaya, mango, citrus of all kinds.
Taste:  clean, no grainy aftertaste.  mild bitterness, barely any at all.  a juice bomb.  citrus, papaya, mango, pineapple, grapefruit without the sharp bitterness.
Feel:  classic treehouse but a little less on the feel, probably since its a DIPA.  highly drinkable and with the ABV, dangerous.
My favorite DIPA by Treehouse. 430 characterskalosjakar, Oct 28, 2016

Look: A dark burnt orange with 1-2 fingers of thick white head. 
Nose: Lots of hops and then fruit. Citras and peach with a hint of pine in there. 
Taste:  The hops blend into the fruit. I taste more pine at the end along with grapefruit. 
Feel: Very smooth for a DIPA. I only had a hint of alcohol in there. 
Overall: A fantastic brew from Treehouse Brewing. Only my second beer from them and very impressed. 508 charactersKdouble, Oct 26, 2016

4.55/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to Pat for sharing this growler, it pours cloudy gold brown color with a foamy 1 finger head that faded slowly, leaving real nice spotty lacing.
Smells of pineapple, clementine, orange peel, lemon zest, caramel, toffee, tangerine, roasted grains, guava juice, sweet malt and tropical fruit.
Tastes like it smells with pungent citrus and floral hops allowing a complex blend of grapefruit juice, oranges, lemon, citrus hops, flowers, piney hops and a malty sweetness that includes caramel, graham cracker, buttered biscuit and tart grapefruit pith. Sharp bitter hops collide with a sweet maltiness that produces a wonderfully balanced IPA. The hops were fresh and intense and the malty/bready backbone made it really easy to dink, hiding the ABV and going down smooth. Another great beer by Tree House, I have not had a bad one from them yet. 850 charactersCHickman, Oct 16, 2016

Aroma is strong pineapple, vegetal notes, hoppy citrus oils. Flavor is bready, bitter, lots of hop oils, some tangerine, big pineapple notes. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy.
Definitely getting a big Julius/Alter Ego vibe from this (it's a double Alter Ego), there's a bit more body to fill you up and the hops have more lingering oils. Similar flavor profile to AE. 467 charactersBranfordBound, Oct 11, 2016

Pours a hazy straw yellow-light orange body, one finger white head, great retention, bits of lacing. Smells of tropical fruit, papaya, light grapefruit, minimal cereal graininess. It's pretty much what I expected from Treehouse on the nose. Smells great. However, the palate is a bit bothered by the booziness that comes on the finish; there of course is plenty of tropical fruit, mango, papaya, grapefruit, but the booziness comes through here even more than expected for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, perfectly carbonated, with a moderately bitter finish. Another solid offering from Treehouse; tasty as hell although a bit boozy, more so than you'd expect even for a DIPA. 727 charactersStevedore, Oct 09, 2016

They just do such a fantastic job with their beers.
Doppleganger is no exception - just terrific.   absolutely deserving of the 100 rating.  Its so hard to compare from beer to beer, but this is on par with all the other top notch NE IPAs - Heady, Focal, SOS etc.    I am so lucky to live in the NE and be able to take a short drive to land such spectacular beers. 413 charactersryno6616, Sep 21, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4Look: Opaque hazy burnt orange with a thick white head. 
Nose: All hops. Peach, tangerine, papaya, guava, lightly floral, with hints of pine. Vibrant. 
Taste: Bright, juicy hops. Ripe peach, tangerine, grapefruit, and papaya. Then a flash of malt and oats. Finish is piney bitter with more grapefruit. 
Feel: Resinous and full bodied. Grabs hold of and coats the palate. Lush. With that being said it smooth for 8.2%.
 Overall: Another great offering from Treehouse. A lush and thick ode to the hop that drinks like a dream. Like a hoppy cloud on the palate. I'd put haze and pride before this one but it's still killer stuff 629 charactersBergBeer, Sep 17, 2016

Smells of tropical fruit, mango, and a bit of pine. The flavor is very hop forward, juicy and piney. Very balanced with the malt. Feeling is a little above medium, just a little thick that the look gets you ready for. I can see why this beer is rated so highly. I will definitely seek this one out again! 383 charactersMeyers1023, Sep 12, 2016

I've had 80% of the beers they put out and this one is my favorite.  I know most people talk up Julius - Haze or Green but to me the difference is how smooth this one is and the depth of flavor here.  They are all excellent brews and major east coast hop/juice bombs but Dop is the best for those reasons.  One of the best I've had.  Superb 478 charactersnjcraftguy, Sep 01, 2016

The pour is a real milky and murky orange-yellow color under a modest and long lasting white foamy head.
The aroma is both subtle and enticing.  I pick up citrus, pine, grapefruit and white bread.  No alcohol for 8.2% ABV.
Beautiful silky and medium to bold body. Smooth and delicate.  
The taste is entirely well balanced with the same white bread sweetness merging quickly with the fruity, juicy, citrus, and pine finish.  The bitterness is fruit not biting and lingers just a short time. No booze. 597 characterspuboflyons, Aug 24, 2016

Hazy, near opaque.  Orange, tinted a bit rusty.  Off-white head settles slowly.  Good amount of sticky lacing.
Smells of deep late addition hops with tons of citrus and tropical fruits.  Pineapple, mango, orange zest, juice.
Flavors follow the aroma.  Touch of sweetness, citrus and tropical give way to a punch of earthy, resinous hoppy flavor.  No discernible alcohol in the taste.
Full side of medium body with moderate carbonation.  
Overall a great DIPA.  I prefer this to Haze.  Improves on the flavor profile of its little brother Alter Ego. 588 charactersjhavs, Aug 16, 2016

L - typical opaque Treehouse beer, darker than some. Fine bubbled head fades fast.
A - not as juicy in aroma as a Julius but orange  peel predominates. Clean smelling.  Can is a little older, that may detract from aroma
T- Holy treehouse.  This is 8.2%?  No discernible alcohol bite, just juicy, hoppy goodness. For a DIPA, this is so smooth, juicy hops rule, little malt character.  Somewhat bitter finish, but not unpleasantly so.  To ne honest ny only criticism could be that there is a sameness to Treehouse beers  - it makes an Alter Ego hard to distinguish from a doppelganger without drinking a lot of them.  But when they are all good it becomes a moot point.
M- Awesome, where Treehouse leaves all other New England IPA and DIPAs in the dust.  So pillowy soft on a full bodied way. I don't know how they do it.
O - 4.75, would be 4.85 if I could. Just a slight bitter touch away from 5.0 for mr 971 characterssandsonik, Aug 13, 2016

Taste is big oranges, tangerine, and grapefruit rind with a bit of malt.  Slightly bitter with dry bitter after taste and medium heavy body. Very juicy. Tastes like a dry hopped beer.   Can really taste similarities to Alter Ego and Julius here.  I do prefer Haze and Julius, but I think this is my third favorite Tree House beer behind only Haze and Julius.

Smells of pine, citrus. Tastes of citrus, bread, lingering well. Feels rich and creamy. Overall a great DIPA, not as overt as offerings from Alchemists but more refined and even. 271 charactersgustavmahler-09, Aug 07, 2016

L: Dark, burnt orange... completely opaque. Not much to look at straight on, but glows a glorious orange with light shined behind it. Gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing.
S: Deep dank and funky hops and pineapple 
T: I love the funk in this one... no one can accuse this one of being too fruity. Pineapple soaked hops, sweet orange and mango; slightly boozy hops on the finish.  
F: Medium and creamy, light carbonation and a good hop tingle.
O: I love it and I’ll drink all I can get… it's leaps and bounds above Alter Ego. 567 charactersjoezak5, Aug 07, 2016

4.56/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Canned 7/21. Consumed 7/30.
A: Pours a thick, dark, ‘flour-added’ opaque orange. Lack of transparency makes it sit in the glass like burnt orange grapefruit juice. Puffy, big, yellow-white head. Very thick lacing sticks to the sides of the glass. Alcohol legs for sure.
S: Orange. Sweet, sweet orange. Assortment of tropical fruit—peach, pineapple, tangerine. Sweet, bubblegum yeast. Bits of dank, catty notes as well, but this is mostly just a big navel orange bomb on the nose.
T: Can definitely taste the amp’d up Alter Ego dry hopping. Not as explosively citric as Alter Ego—probably because the citrus-forward base is being overshadowed—but the Mosaic flavor is really powerful. Dank, resinous, and very herbaceous. Almost diesel- and gasoline-like finish. Some pithy orange peel, but that ultra dank Mosaic lingers on the aftertaste. Plus, of course, an underlying sweet bready malt that makes it so splendidly Tree House.
M: Creamy, very much like Alter Ego. Perhaps even thicker and heavier—more milkshake-esque—than its little sibling. Noticeably more bitter on the finish than Alter Ego; almost reminds me of a creamier version of the finish on Bright. Bitterness, which is more herbal than piney, lingers for a while.
O: Another home run from Tree House. A dangerously drinkable citrus bomb that doesn't even hint at its ABV. If anything, Doppelganger may suffer from comparisons to Alter Ego, which, in my opinion, is even juicier and more explosively citric than its amped up sibling. Despite this, Doppelganger preserves the creamy, full mouthfeel of Alter Ego and increases the dank/earthy/bitter notes imparted by the extra Mosaic and Amarillo. Overall, a world-class DIPA. 1,710 charactersavas, Jul 31, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This exceeded my expectations, hence the high scores.
Turbid, deep hazy orange appearance.  Smell is full of tropical fruits, like they've been in a blender.  Mango, passionfruit, melon, orange citrus just beat up the taste buds.  Rich mouthfeel. And just like all Tree House beers, super easy to drink.
This is definitely one of the best Tree House beers I've had, which is a quite difficult to achieve because all their beers are exceptional.  It's up there with Julius and Alter Ego for me.  Get this when you can. 519 characterseifster82, Jul 29, 2016

4.49/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a tallboy into a shaker pint, the beer is a muddled, opaque, orange-tan coloring, with a foamy, low profile, dense, off-white head. Aromas of orange rind, grapefruit, melon, mango, apricot, wet grass, pine tassels, and moss. Very well balanced, with a slight edge to the fruity notes. Flavors are supersweet fruity notes forward, heavy on melon and mango, with the citrus notes becoming more of a highlight or accent. The end of the palate houses the dank and vegetal hops characteristics, rich in wet grass, pine pitch, and mossy notes. Very well balanced, but still leaning towards the fruity side, which is perfect. The body is big and smooth, with a slick coating that makes it insanely drinkable. The aftertaste is fruit salad, with a kick of dried grass and pepper spice. The finish is smooth, light, and slightly effervesced, with a bitter and dank linger. Great beer! 887 charactersGarthDanielson, Jul 26, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75First impressions of a 750mL growler that was filled the day prior (L: 4.5 S: 4 T: 4.5 F: 4.75 O: 4.5, total rating: 4.41): Pours a hazy orange in color with a white head. Aroma is subdued but just shy of dank with some melon, cantaloupe, and pine. At the very end of the glass I'm able to pick up some bready malts. Taste is typical Tree House, lots of melon and cantaloupe. I also get some other indistinct tropical fruits, maybe some papaya. This finishes fairly neutral with little bitterness and only hint of fruity sweetness. Great mouthfeel, very interesting. Smooth and shy of creamy, it is both full and very light on the palate at the same time. Overall a great beer that definitely grew on me. At first I was a bit underwhelmed but the muted aroma and the dominant melon/cantaloupe flavor combination that I get so often from Tree House but this beer won me over. As I continued to savor this over the course of a 750mL growler I found a bit more nuance. This was far too easy to drink for 8.2%.
Additional notes from a can consumed 5 weeks after packaging: aroma is much stronger, same notes as above. Taste has settled and is much smoother, same flavors as above but everything has come together and is more cohesive rather than being dispirate flavors. Overall a truly excellent beer. 1,299 charactersmnj21655, Jul 25, 2016

L: brownish-orange muck is not my idea for the color of a beer. Maybe it's because it's the color of the gunk that came out of my nose during last week's sinus infection, but I'm not loving the color. And it's crazy cloudy. I just can't get my head around it... I wonder what's in it that makes it look like that. If it was yeast, you'd think they'd settle over time. But I've had these sit a while then pour them then take apart the can and no sediment. Just curious...
S: dank and musty. Sort of like a wet bathing suit that sat in the corner a couple days too long. Not offensive, but definitely musty. And a hint of tropical fruit.
T: typical Tree House. I like this a little better because there's some background bitterness and it's not all tropical fruit forward. But I wonder if, aside from their brown ale and stouts, Tree House can get past the one-hit-wonderhood of this style of beer.
F: incredible. Like a cloud in my mouth. Light and fluffy.
O: ready for a change of pace from the Tree House IPAs, DIPAs. They're all different, yet only subtly so. 1,150 charactersGeeL, Jul 19, 2016

4/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Vibrant yet opaque dark orange with a very large, off-white, sea foam textured head that persists as a lumpy, fluffy whip cream blanket.
In aroma, when ultra fresh, I immediately get a hit of spent grain malt with that distinct Tree House hop attribute of nearly dank, but not full on cannabis. This is paired with fruity notes, almost like a roasted, spiced peach cobbler, which is well balanced with pine.
Taste is sweet pine, if that's a thing, almost like maple, with a wet grain nearing pie crust, and ripe stone fruits. Mushy, cooked spiced apple, comes forward, with bubblegum, and a little kick of alcohol.
Easy drinking for 8% and massively flavorful. Frothy yet spicy, soft yet a little prickly. 708 charactersSabtos, Jul 10, 2016

My fellow TH fans and I usually consume these beers the same day or within 2-3 days and handle them with the utmost care but agree that poured from a can consistently have better flavor.

Explosive hop flavor but so juicy with mango and papaya grapefruit. This was so enjoyable. Some dankness and resin on this bad boy really makes this stand out.

Nose is citrus, papaya, mango and cantaloupe. Juicy and deep almost like a fruit smoothie. Flavor is of melon, cantaloupe, citrus, papaya and mango. Heaps of tropical fruit flavor crush a subtle, resiny hop bitterness. Malt presence really dominates here as it usually does in Tree House IPAs. Finishes subtle and sweet. Soft with moderate carbonation on the palate. Super drinkable. 
These Tree House offerings are so good that its almost getting boring reviewing them. Taste and feel are almost always near perfect. And despite the 8.2% alcohol, these are truly sessionable beers as they never tire the palate and never overwhelm the senses. Just incredible! 735 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 27, 2016

This beer starts off more malty than their Julius.  The chew is decent for the body.  Good carbonation.  Less complex than Julius, but still beats the doors in of 99%+ of the other offerings available.  Long lasting black pepper hop finish and aftertaste. 424 characterssmcolw, Jun 25, 2016

A: Medium orange at its core with some gold around the edges - notably hazy and turbid, even for a Tree House beer - pours with a medium size, white head, fades to a few wisps, maintains a small collar and leaves streaks and spots of lacing
S: Fruit explosion - as with some other Tree House beers, this could be mistaken for a screwdriver or a tropical mixed drink - tangerine and orange flesh, juice - grapefruit zest - floral citrus - loads of tropical fruit, peach, mango, guava, pineapple - decidedly dank thanks to all that Mosaic - pine and tropical pine trees -  herbal and resinous hops, with a touch of grass - touch of earth - pale malts and some light sweetness, light hint of booze
T: The utterly magnificent aroma does not exactly translate to flavor, unfortunately - big citrus, with some tangerine, orange, and ruby red grapefruit - citrus juice, flesh, and some zest - floral citrus and a touch of spice - peach, pineapple, melon, mango - dank, resinous hops - some pine and pine sap - touch of earth, but mostly clean - neutral pale malts with some sweetness - booze is more apparent than expected
M: Medium body, medium-low carbonation, super smooth and fuzzy, some dryness in the finish
O: Wait, this isn't a Doppelbock?!
Alter Ego is easily in my top 3 favorite Tree House beers, and I had dreams that Doppelganger would be even better. The aroma is just as magical, but the additional ABV seems like a detriment. I still really enjoy Doppelganger, but it's not absolutely mind-blowing. Sorry Tree House, you just set the standard too high... 1,586 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 19, 2016

Look - orange, thin white head, nice lacing which will likely come through on the feel later
Smell - orange juice, zesty lemon, pineapple....strong orange
Taste - ripe oranges with some other citrus notes and some melon and honeydew
Feel - creamier than the body would present but really juicy too.  Very drinkable
Overall - excellent beer.  Heavy on the orange, but this one is certainly not overrated.  Great Tree House offering 477 charactersrabbott2, Jun 13, 2016

Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip.
a: Hazy orange with a finger thick dense white head which receded to thick uneven surface foam and dense lacing.
s; Intense pine resin and citrus.
t: Follows the nose but with more emphasis on the pine and dank, over a full bready malt base.  Dry finish.  higher ABV beautifully covered.
m: Medium plus, great creamy body and moderate to heavy carbonation tingle.
o: Yet another superior DIPA from Tree House, missed the first release of this some months ago but glad I was able to grab three a week ago Saturday.  Perhaps a bit more on the dank and resiny side than others of theirs, but it's all good. 706 charactersscotorum, Jun 12, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to JLindros for sharing. 
A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark orange hue, murky, decisively Tree House. Nice one finger head that fades to leave sticky lacing. 
S - Aromas of sticky dank hops, nice oily hops, resin, pine, citrus orange. Pretty much a mosaic bomb. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose with loads of pine, nice lighter citrus juice, fair amount of bitterness. There is a fair amount of booze lingering too.
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, bit sticky and boozy. 
O - Overall this was a solid beer, nice hop notes. Solid bitterness, wish there was a bit more citrus.

4.16/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Growler filled yesterday.
Nice fluffy creamy head fades at a med pace, super hazy murky orange juice color, great lacing.
Nose is also like a glass of orange juice, bright citrus, juicy orange, pith and little grapefruit, a little tropical note, a touch of pine resin, wait then huge pine sap forest floor onion coming after it warms thanks to mosaic. 
Taste starts with more juicy orange juice, nice citrus, little grapefruit pith, nice tropical guava mango juice not a ton, thankfully very little mosaic, little grassy earthy pine sap but not a ton, some good pith notes, but not as complex as I expected it to be. Mild booze warmth. Finish dry nice lingering pith and orange juice, little grassy pine sap, hint booze.
Mouth is med bod, decent carb, a touch creamy but not really.
Overall pretty good, but not as good as it could be, mosaic was big on the nose eventually but very little on taste, but still a little flat compared to others. 948 charactersjlindros, Jun 10, 2016

3.58/5  rDev -21.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to Bunuelian for this can. He mumbled something about “this beer sucks” when he handed it to me, so I guess we’ll see. 16 oz. can…& now, after spelling doppelganger wrong for all those years as a D&D Dungeon Master (if you know what that means, kudos, fellow geek). Canned 4/29/16.
The pour is what I understand is a northeast IPA thing: orange juice, no strainer.  The nose is intensely grassy, almost hefe-like, orange melon, swamp gas. Odd. Not sure if it’s appealing odd or just plain odd. 
Doppelganger: I remember wreaking havoc on General Gyff about 25 years ago with a well-placed ‘ganger during the Bree campaign. This? More odd. Certainly tropical with mango, citrus prominent, & a minor note of oranges. Behind the fruits is an unsubtle dankness of rotting milfoil that dulls the mirror brightness quite a bit. Moderate bitterness coupled with malt sweetness wraps up. Consistency of a smoothie (my daughter makes great smoothies). Dangerous, only because the alcohol content seems to be zero. 
A bit baffled now that I look at the ratings: this is routinely good & easily the least favorite of the offerings I’ve inhaled from Tree House. Ah well. They can’t all be masterpieces. 1,216 charactersmaximum12, May 29, 2016

The IPA and imperial IPA formula that Tree House is following is clearly a repeatable and exacting process. This is another brilliantly hued and deeply saturated orange peach colored beer with delicate head and fine, spidery lacing on the glass. Massively tropical, all the fruits you'd expect in a beer like this. Mango, pineapple, some kiwi, peach, grapefruit, and lots of nectarine. The bitterness really doesn't appear until the finish, and oh what a sublime experience that is. The mouthfeel is just so unbelievably soft you can forget you're drinking a beer at times. Unlike green and julius this beer does have a touch more pronounced alcohol, and the malt foundation is ever so slightly more caramel and sweet bread imbued. Absolutely amazing and well worth a wait in line with other eager Tree House fans. 915 charactersdd43, May 23, 2016

4.52/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5As every brewery in the sudsy landscape takes their turn at the imperial IPA style, many are content to play along, emulating what others have done. But there are others who won't rest easy until the style is completely reimagined, reinvented, redefined.
And that's how Tree House brewers are setting the bar with Doppelganger- a stronger, richer IPA with a turbid veil, with the unfiltered character to carry the visual weight of tapioca. Hazy amber-peach hues settle under a creamy, dense meringue of foam. Its tantalizing scents are chocked full of citrus and tropical fruit variety, nearly teeth-churning with its tangy, fruit-forward scent. 
Its taste is rife with fruit pungency- slightly over-ripened from common attributes of radiant red grapefruit and tangerine to the irresistible fruit punch taste of nectarine, pineapple, mango, apple, kiwi, apricot  and then those nearly tart notes of lemon and lime. All the while, the malty support that plays out underneath resembles the honey and caramel character of branch-ripened fruit sugars but with the softness of angel-food cake. 
Medium-full throughout, the beer trends deliberately dry and bitter. As the pulpiness of fruit relaxes, the rind and pith character pulls ahead, bringing with it the verbena herbal taste of fresh sod, leaf and stem. Herbal with tea, a sassafras bitterness emerges and links up with soft bristly pine needles. Still, the after-palate teases the brain with the notions that this may simply be an eight-percent sherbet. 1,509 charactersBEERchitect, May 11, 2016

Look: Slightly unappealing hazy orange color, but redeemed by a great head that lasted well with good lacing on the glass.
Smell: Fantastic, full of citrus fruits mainly grapefruit.
Taste: Like the smell but with lots of dank notes and more pineapple, pleasant hop bitterness at the finish.
Feel: Great mouth feel. Fine effervescence gives a very smooth yet refreshing feel.

The aroma is very tropical with loads of mango and sweet melon. I also get some orange and grapefruit. The back end is dank ass pine.
The taste has tons of grapefruit as well as some pineapple and mango. Finishes piney, bitter, and dank, like the last song at Woodstock.
The feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Fluffy, smooth, and creamy. There's a slight lingering bitterness at the end of each sip.
Overall, another fantastic blah blah blah from blah blah. At this point, I'd be more surprised to point out an IPA from Tree House that isn't amazing. 715 charactersScaryEd, May 06, 2016

Pours a characteristic Treehouse hazy deep orange body, a little darker than the typical Treehouse IPA but not much. Not quite as golden. Head is big, white, frothy, leaving heavy lacing and a good amount of retention. Looks fantastic. 
Aromas are bursting and tropical, heavy mango and pineapple, a little watermelon, passionfruit, grapefruit. The aroma reminds me of Haze with a bit more pineapple. 
Taste is tropical fruit fest as expected, tons of pineapple, mango, honeydew melon, more melony than citrusy, much like Haze, with an amazing creamyness, orange creamsicle on the follow through, very little bitterness on the finish. Creamy, full body but not filling, easy drinker. Medium-low carbonation.
Another Grand Slam from Treehouse. Most of their hoppy beers have the same characteristic tropical, creamy taste and aroma with slight variations. This is is more on the melony / stone fruit side. Awesome. 1,050 charactersgcamparone, Apr 30, 2016

4.52/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Look: Golden caramel. Not translucent; hazy. Small head with fine bubbles dissipating to a thin rim.
Smell: This beer is oranges. There is a slight 'fresh cut grass' smell to it.
Taste: A little maltier than others. Still getting a lot of citrus oranges. Slightly sweet, like caramel. Flavors seem to fade quickly though.
Feel: Pretty clean and not so much bite like Haze had upfront. Sweet but fading.
Overall: Great dipa. Really close to a sweet orange juice. 461 charactersdhitchcox, Apr 07, 2016

4.18/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25thanks to my brother for sharing this, enjoyed chilled in a willybecker from the can.
The color is very hazed, cloudy smoothie look with frothy white head and fine bead with lace rings that stick on the glass. The smell is fruity and lemony with citrus dominant aroma with slight fruity/dank herbal aroma with light alcohol in the back. The feel is fruity with semi-sweet and juicy quality mildly bitter hop balance with resinous texture and yeasty creaminess with low astringency.
 The taste is very good with both fruity and tangy tropical fruit and citrus flavors from the hops with juicy and moderate sweet quality in the malt with juicy and fruit in the tropical realm with an almost pineapple like flavor with sweetness yet also slightly bitter with a mostly dry finish. Overall I enjoyed how it was a fruity and juicy hop profile with tropical citrus and very mild alcohol  which makes a drinkable brew. There is a little more malt and mildly astringent aspect as it warms but this is a high quality strong IPA, thanks TIM! 1,032 charactersSlatetank, Apr 04, 2016

Doesn't quite reach the heights of Very Hazy, but that's an incredibly high bar to set. Tree House knocked it out of the park again. 368 charactersberto714, Mar 29, 2016

If you have had Alter Ego before, the smell is identical (okay... maybe slightly more pungent). The taste is great and is like a better Alter Ego (if there was such a thing). For this style beer, the mouth feel is spot on. Overall, I love Alter Ego so you can imagine how much I enjoyed this one! Cheers! 425 characterstregan_20, Mar 16, 2016

Looks like a drink I make for St. Paddy's day actually called the Dublin Peach, which has ginger ale, citrus juice and jameson in it. I didn't get much head or lacing on it. Awesome color blend though.
S: Spicy, herbal and floral citrusy, piney hop bomb. Hints of melon, papaya, orange slush, verbena leaf.
M: Raw, rough and a little scratchy, but soft nevertheless. I don't know if it's subliminal because of the dry-hopped appearance. 
T: Tons of tropical fruit, earthy, pulpy tangerine, grapefruit rinds. Dank as they come. Doughy malts are really tasty too. Low, fruity aftertaste. This beer reminds me A LOT of Lost Nation Mosaic. 703 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Mar 12, 2016

T: So very juicy and tropical. This reminds me of a rum drink you would order in the Caribbean. I basically taste everything you smell and I love it.
F: Perfect. Body is full and soft, carb is right on and there's just a tiny hint of booze but it helps enhance the flavors.

When I drank a freshly poured 750, I was treated to a wonderfully hoppy beer with that characteristic TH "juiciness".  I can't wait to go back for another. 290 charactersPrevelige, Feb 29, 2016

This beer looks fantasisic, smells even better, and tastes even better than that.  Orange haze for days and a tropical smell that just pulls you in.  The reason why I like Alter Ego and Doppelganger so much is the mouth feel and taste in comparison to Green and Julius and their big brothers.  It's all personal preference when it comes to Tree House and honestly odds are you aren't wrong in your decision.
Great beer from a great brewery.  Only Good Morning and February '16 Triple Shot do I enjoy more than this beer.  Must be on the bucket list for beer IMO.
P.S. - Please people when drinking Tree House IPAs please let them warm up 40+ mins before drinking.  I have always found that their beer is best FRESH and 40+ minutes after the pour and warming up in the glass of your choice.  Experiment and find out your favorite timing!  Everyone is different! 911 charactersBEEPOP, Feb 28, 2016

So my opinion of Doppelganger might be a bit deflated, but it still struck me as a very solid DIPA.  You can definitely taste Alter Ego in there, with just a little extra kick to amp things up.  It's tasty, but I prefer the aforementioned Julius, as well as Haze and Green over this one. 407 charactersLochnessmonster, Feb 20, 2016

A- Milky and deeply hop hazed out pale golden body into a few tulips. The white head has a creamy frothy texture rising to just about a finger. Fair head retention and spotty lacing decorating the glass.
S- Tropical fruits alter the time space continuum in a true scaled up alter Alter Ego. Passionfruit pulp and mango like a wrecking ball to the nostrils and it all just comes off as sticky and dank. Slight citrus, tangerine, and floral hops hint in the backdrop.
T- Juicy mango at levels that should, well not really, be illegal joined smoothly by bond ride melon. Naturally these two find harmony with dank sticky herbs, tangerine citrus pith, distinct passionfruit, peach and sure fire apricot. Leans towards the tropical profile most certainly. Pale grains provide slight sweetness.
MF- Creamy and puffy texture with plenty of substance in a medium overall body. Tropical hops a poppin due to the high end crisp carbonation. A fair bite to the medium bitterness.
For me the Doppelgänger edges out the King in a close duel. Not a surprise as I always preferred Alter Ego by a hair. Excellent juiciness here with mango, passionfruit, melon and dank herbs creating the palate equivalent of bliss. Keep em coming Tree House, I won't mind. 1,312 characterscbutova, Feb 13, 2016

Look: Hazy Orange/Yellow, poured with a generous 2+ finger head of creamy white.
Smell: Super Dank hoppiness and tons of citrus. The dankness filled the room enough for others to comment as it was poured.
Taste: Super dank 420, with crazy amount of orange citrus and bitter zest/pith. This beer I felt is their best non-stout offering.
Feel: Medium bodied, creaminess, and the alcohol was not really noticeable.
Overall: Probably my favorite TH beer and IMO the best DIPA being brewed. If you love super dank DIPAs this is the beer you need to get. 651 charactersMatthewHopHead, Feb 10, 2016

Aromas pop from the growler but even more so once it hit a glass.  Tropical. Mango, tangerine.  Amazingly juicy.

Bit of viscosity, light carbonation, goes down smooth.

F: Signature Tree House softness that is evenly carbonated and finishes slightly dry, but juice abounds
O: This is an incredible twist on Alter Ego. Like other reviewers I tried this side by side and Doppelganger enhances the juicy bitterness of AE, but incorporates the distinctive softness and refinement best exemplified by King Julius. This is a world class DIPA and polishes any discernible trace amounts of rawness exhibited by AE in an urbane fashion. Highly recommended. 739 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 06, 2016

The taste is a very creamy pale ale with a good blend of hops, malt and some hints of fruitness.  Not a lot of bitterness, the feel is quite full and creamy.  Overall a very good Tree House beer. 299 charactersmrn1ceguy, Feb 05, 2016

Appearance- Typical treehouse light orange with small head. 
Smell-identical to alter ego with very slight boost in the aroma. 
Taste-  great flavor.  Back end bitterness fantastic.  To me that is only difference from alter ego
Feel- perfect mouthfeel for style. 
Overall-  huge fan of alter ego.  Love the mosaic flavor in the dry hop.  To me this is a 10 percent improvement on alter ego.   If u like alter ego,  this will not disappoint 480 charactersjcflorian, Jan 30, 2016

L. Hazy orange with 1 finger white head. Light lacing.

T. Taste follows suite with a nice mango, passion fruit finish. A little heat that I don't notice with other TH offerings but nothing to complains about. 
F. Average carbonation and medium mouth feel. 378 charactersDopen993, Jan 27, 2016

Never said this about a beer, but too much aroma/late addition/dry hop hops.  Great beer to share, but when drinking a whole 16oz by myself, would take regular Alter Ego any day.  That said, this is still an amazing beer, but it just doesn't meet the deliciously-hoppy-yet-super-drinkableness that I have come to expect from TH 368 charactersabuono, Jan 26, 2016

L:  The Tree House signature. Cloudy, orange, juicy, pulpy goodness. It's come to the point where I expect beer to look like this, or I get turned off to it. Perfect fluffy head. Not even a fraction of a point to deduct...Tree House knows how to make the perfect looking IPA.
S:  Fresh hoppy juice. Beautiful aroma of tart citrus and dank resin.
T: Blown away here. Wasn't expecting as much, since Alter Ego isn't one of my favorites, but wow! The flavor profile reminds me more of Green than anything. Full of juicy fruit flavors backed by a bitter hoppy finish. Green quickly became my favorite beer because of how flavorfull it is. This is as close to that as I've tasted since, but with a much more pronounced bitterness.
F:  Fluffy and mouth coating. This one makes you want to pour and gulp several glasses because of how pleasant it is. 
O: Just incredible. Little else to say than if you have a chance, you need to try this one. If you're a fan of Green, you'll love this. A new favorite for sure in an ever growing list of near perfect beers from Tree House. 1,120 charactersTblaisdell, Jan 25, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The first perfect score i've given. But holy damn do I love this beer.
A: Pours a perfect hazy amber with good head and lacing all the way down the glass. 
S:  Smell of some amazing sweet fruits almost candied orange and tangerine. 
T: Follows the nose very well with a lot of fruits and its definately on the sweeter/juicier end especially compared to very green. But it also has the "dank" flavor that I love where you can really taste the hops and has the perfect aftertaste. My palate seems to love Mosaic hops. No bitterness or booze in it.
F: Spot on. Has the nice creamy feeling in your mouth and leaves that great aftertaste on your tongue.
O: This very slightly beats Trilliums Headroom beer as my new favorite. I would love to have them side by side. But bravo Treehouse, and hot damn. 
I still have a special place in my heart for Curiosity 22 with that great peach flavor, and Artaic with that great honey sweetness. 930 charactersGinjaSlice, Jan 24, 2016

Leaves a sticky, faintly orange-laced head. Color kinda reminds me of when you're making a mess trying to peel an orange and you're left with orangey stained fingers. 
S - initial impression is a kicked-up Alter Ego. Overripe juicy fruit, oranges, tangerine. Pungent dank hops, sugary sweet fruit. Update: drinking a month old can and it smells like fruit rollups! Awesome!
T - hit with an initial blast of potent cloying citrus. Brighter than AE. This beer has a little twang in the second act that exhibits slight dryness to suck up the sweet juice and leave you with a tangy bitter dankness. Grapefruit, mosaic breadiness. Exotic papaya, darker, richer superfruits. 
F - typical Tree House. Increased alcohol syrupifies the feel to give it a creamier consistency. Low carb, soft and entirely appealing to drink!
O - similar to King Julius, this is like Alter Ego at 115%. Everything amped up slightly, but done with tasteful balance, no aspects overwhelming the other.
So if Alter Ego is Devil Julius, then Doppelgänger is... Mega Supervillain Julius? 1,148 charactersagreenman19, Jan 22, 2016
