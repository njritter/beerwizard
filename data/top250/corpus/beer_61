L: 2F+ head with good retention, lots of soapy lacing and a cap and ring. Beer is a very hazy copper-orange.
S: Super-nice pineapple and citrus from the double hop. Light malt. Significant amount of dank earthiness.
T: Taste follows nose beautifully. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit. Light  malt backbone. Finish is herbal and earthy.
F: Medium bodied, lively carbonation. Makes it both poundable and savorable for the taste, so really you need two. Construction and balance top-notch.
O: Flavor-packed and you can drink it all day. 580 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jun 03, 2017

4.56/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque yellow with a hint of orange. A white head foams up with big bubbles, and to a finger in height upon a moderate pour. No lacing left behind with fair head retention. Aroma is orange, mango, tangerine, with a smack of papaya at the back. Flavor profile is less juicy, but with hops still abundant. Notes include orange, tangerine, and papaya with a little residual citrus sugar. Biscuit malts show themselves throughout the flavor profile. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a filling, smooth presence. Overall, citrus notes are big, with a firm malt base in the flavor profile making this a little more interesting to sip on compared with other big hop beers. 
Served in a 12oz snifter from a 16oz can. 716 charactersHarrison8, May 29, 2017

Just opening the can I could tell this wouldn't disappoint.  Hazy, turbid and bright yellow.  Flavors of juicy, tropical bitterness, with some dank, resinous notes that end abruptly in a smooth dry finish.  Smelled like a tropical bomb in a can!

A turbid yellow color as predicted with a fluffy white head that kept me company. I got a blast of the aroma just from opening the can: grapefruit, pineapple, resiny herbal notes, and a little grassiness. Juicy taste with more dank resiny notes. A slight hop burn - wonder what this would be like in another week. Pillowy soft feel and dry finish. 401 charactersBuck89, May 25, 2017

A: Pours light gold/orangish, completely opaque and OJ-like, with a finger of soapy head, some sparse lacing.  OK retention.
S: Fragrant pineapple, mango, sharp white grapefruit and lemon, with very soft floral notes.  Very nice.
T: Flavors lean more towards floral and herbal, still with some citrus undertones.  The flavors are somewhat muddled compared to the nose.  A long finish with mild but slightly harsh bitterness. 
M: Medium body, moderately high creaminess, and medium-high, sharp carbonation which undercuts the creaminess. 
O: Pretty good flavors, especially the nose, for a pale ale.  The taste doesn’t quite live up to the aroma, though. 682 characterspmarlowe, May 24, 2017

Taste: Brilliant, sweet tropical flavors like pineapple, mango, passionfruit greet you and followed by a hempy, earthy finish that is subtly bitter and lingers. 
Mouthfeel: Moderate carb and slightly dry, not as dry as Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point. 
Overall: My favorite IPA. This is such a great beer and the lower ABV allows all of the elements to shine. 426 charactersmnbuffalo, May 19, 2017

S: Big nose of tropical fruit, pineapple and lemon/lemon peel.
T: Tropical fruit is the dominant flavor - lots of juicy pineapple/pineapple juice. Also some citrus peel and a "green" taste as well - grassy or leafy, herbal. Finishes with a surprising bitterness that lingers on the top of the palate. 
M: Pulpy and thick; drinks more like a juice than a beer at times.

This may well be the haziest of the Trillium beers I've had. Nice golden juice color, although a little milky. Aerated pour produces a meek, half finger head that dissipates instantly to nothing. Yet another juice bomb from Trillium, both in the aroma and the taste. Tropical fruits are even more amped up this time and the lower ABV allows for them to really shine. I had the Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point (and regular Fort Point) yesterday and I can't discern too much of a difference between the GDH and this, despite this one being $5 (33%) more expensive per 4-pack -- stick with the galaxy version if you can.

Suggestions of grapefruit, faint lemon, and something mildly musky around the edges. Ample carbonation and smooth but crisp feel.

S: assertive, but not as intense as I expected with the dry hopping; tropical fruit with grapefruit rind;
T: follows the nose with a solid malt backbone; grapefruit rind bitterness builds from the middle through the moderately bitter finish;
M: medium bodied; moderate carbonation; very dry finish;
O: some surprises for me - aroma was less intense than I expected and the bitterness level was higher than with many New England APAs; I enjoyed it; 588 charactersHamdenHector, Feb 25, 2017
4.84/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A 16 oz. can date 2/15/17 poured into Teku glass.
Look- A cloudy deep yellow citrus. A very thick white head and lacing all the way down the glass.
Smell - Predominantly grapefruit with some orange juice and other citrus mixed. The hops come through blending nicely with the fruit aroma. 
Taste - Wow. Not like any pale ale I have previously had. More grapefruit than anything else, but there is some orange and maybe mango mixed in there. It all blends for a fantastic taste with the citrus. 
Feel - Extremely smooth with a juicy feel. The taste lingers regardless of the time between drinks.  
Overall - The best pale ale I have had. The smell and taste alone leave me wanting more. 689 charactersKdouble, Feb 25, 2017

A: Pours a super hazy, pale yellowish-orange in color with a foamy, 1/2 inch, paper white head with minimal retention. Thin, white lacing throughout.
S: Huge aromas of tropical fruit and citrus consisting of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, melons, and guava with mild hints of piney hops.
T: Starts off with big notes of grapefruit and bitter orange rind followed by tropical fruit notes of pineapple, melons, passionfruit, and guava. Somewhat juicy. Finishes with big notes of piney, resinous hops that leave a palate smacking, lingering bitterness.
F: Medium bodied. Somewhat juicy. Smooth and crisp with moderate carbonation.
O: Overall, this is a great Pale Ale. Love the haziness and juiciness, which is well balanced with hoppy bitterness. Very drinkable. Glad I had the opportunity to try this one and would definitely seek it out again. 916 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 19, 2017

Slight onion patch from the Columbus and animal-cracker backbone with peachy-mango ripeness perfection, with a peppery-tongue tingle finish leaving a seltzer-dry crispness feel competing with the beautiful fruit sweetness.  Not a soft pillowy finish, which is okay.
Snow, coldness, and ugly women keep the masses from Massachusetts.  Thank God.  This beer rocks!

I would never have known it was a Pale Ale if not for the can saying so.  Full taste of any of the top IPAs.   I Feel I don't give Trillium as much credit as maybe I should because I drink a ton of Tree House...but man, everything I have had from Trillium is spot on.   This and the DDH Congress Street have been my favorites.   Of course Pow Pow was incredible but that was a colab.
At any rate, you hop heads that only go for IPAs (like me) -  Get it. 493 charactersryno6616, Feb 02, 2017

Pours a huge fluffy frothy 2 finger head that fades at a med pace, sticky lacing, super murky milk shake tangerine color.
Nose loads of tangerine and citrus juice, clementine, a little pithy, faint grapefruit, maybe a touch of pineapple, some tropical notes with a little dankness, orange bubblegum and orange cream, getting a big pith, little papaya, some mango.
Taste brings loads more citrus and some dank tropical fruits, a hint of maybe pine but that gets drowned quickly by citrus, orange juice, a little rind, some pith, clementine, some grapefruit, some pineapple and papaya, some mango, fair bitterness, a little grassy earthy note, big creamy malt base too. Finish is dry, quite bitter, a little spicy earthy like hop, plenty more pith and a little rind, and big citrus.
Mouth is med bod, creamy, tingly carbonation.
Overall great beer, so much citrus, orange, pith, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, etc, tasty. 1,083 charactersjlindros, Jan 16, 2017

A: The beer is a cloudy orange/gold color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains strong floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with a nice strong burst of floral hops bitterness that is quickly followed by some fruity citrus and caramel sweetness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a long time. 798 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 31, 2016

Pours murky yellow with some light gold hues and a whipped but subdued head of white. Minor lacing and retention. Aromatics blast of with a large dose of tropical citrus. Orange juice spiked with grapefruit, mango, and peach. The body is medium at best but a good dose of suspended slurry lends a creamy, soft mouthfeel. The palate is bursting with zesty, pithy, and juicy hops. Orange, peach fuzz, grapefruit pulp, and mango. Zero malt with a low bitterness. A lengthy finish with plenty of juicy fruit. 
Great beer. Crushable and delicious. 569 charactersbrewandbbq, Dec 19, 2016

Pours a murky golden orange color with a small foamy white head.  Pure resin and orange aroma up front with some fresh grassy green notes, orange and grapefruit zest.  Tastes of juicy orange and grapefruit hops, resinous throughout, green and leafy, more resin on the finish with a  linger of citrus and grass.  Medium body and carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and finish.  Possible the best APA I've had, absolutely delicious 464 charactersTreyliff, Dec 16, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a super bright hazy/turbid pure OJ look!
Aroma starts off with a huge pineapple, mango and sweet orange and then goes into some fresh green hops, earthy dank notes and some citrus zest.
Taste is also very much dominated by pineapple and mango upfront, but then goes into pure OJ. The more it sits on my palate more of the green/fresh hop character comes out and it finishes with an orange/citrus and dank note. Super crushable!
Medium bodied, not as crisp as some Pales, fuller, creamy mouthfeel and a little more bitterness than some in the style.
Another winner! Prefer Mosaic FP to this, but this is still awesome! 631 charactersJohnnyMc, Dec 07, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Trillium Double Dry-Hopped Fort Point
A: Trillium's amped up version of their staple pale ale pours much hazier than a lot of their other offerings, though it is more of a hop detritus-laden Heady Topper-esque haze than  the fruit smoothie of many other NE IPAs; this is welcome, as some of those can border on the ridiculous. Two fingers of snow white head sits atop the cloudy golden orange liquid, and the retention is very good. Lacing is great. This is about as far as NE IPAs should go, in this reviewer's opinion. 5/5
A: As soon as the can cracks, waves of orange juice and other assorted citrus fruit (tangerine, clementine, mandarin, and lots of Ruby grapefruit), plus some mango, hit the nose. It is difficult not to smell this beer if one is in the same room. There is also a lot of pith and plenty of green hoppiness, grassy and a little pine. Dry, crackery malt is hidden under all of that, but it is possible to parse. Intense, complex, and infinitely appetizing. 5/5
T: The taste cannot quite live up to the ridiculous aroma, but to be fair, that is an absurdly hard act to follow. There is still a fair amount of fruit here, but it has become pithy and bitter, with some of the complexity drowned out by an overwhelming grassy, piney bitterness. Orange and light mango are present, but the other elements are hidden under the almost excessive dryness and green earthiness. It is still tasty, and the dryness and near-complete lack of sweetness are in line with the APA style. This is still very good, but it is imbalanced toward bitterness, which is disappointing after the stellar aroma. 4/5
M: As per usual for Trillium, the mouthfeel is very good, though this suffers slightly for its mild astringency. It is medium, with a typically soft carbonation. There is no stickiness, and the finish is very dry. It does go a little far with the bitterness, leaving a slightly unpleasant feel, but it is nothing too extreme or off-putting. 4.25/5
O: While there is a lot to like, this is really a tale of two beers: before it gets on the palate, it is wonderful, but the relative failure in the true application of the beer makes it just very good (it is Trillium, after all, and they rarely miss). The bitterness and overly-hopped character are just too much. Still, it is refreshing, tasty, and a very good example of a highly-hopped pale ale from one of the premier brewers of the style. Pair with NAILS's "You Will Never Be One of Us," equally intense but to a fault. 4/5 2,490 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Nov 03, 2016

Pours hazy pale orange with a half-inch off-white head that remains as a thick ring and leaves strands of lace. The smell is of tropical fruit, citrus and faint  pine. The taste follows with juicy pineapple and mango, bitter grapefruit and a hint of pine on the finish. Full texture with crisp carbonation.

The taste gives you hints of mango and grapefruit. Sweet on the front end with not too much bitterness on the back end. Feel is medium and not overly carbonated. Overall this is one of the better beers from trillium that I have tried so far. 321 charactersAmguerra305, Oct 08, 2016

A: Tangerine gold with some milky honey - super hazy, murky, and turbid, above average even for Trillium's standards - pours with a bright white head, fades to a small, frothy collar and a wispy cap
S: A juice bomb - potent but soft citrus, with juicy, fleshy tangerine and floral grapefruit - lightly dank, herbal, touch of grass - stone fruit, with ripe, juicy peach - straight-up hop pellets - lime - juicy tropical notes with some mango, pineapple, melon, passion fruit - lightly bready, lightly sweet malts at the base
T: Forget beer, this is a hop smoothie - lots of citrus, with some tangerine and orange - flesh and juice - lime zest and juice - herbal, resinous hops, decidedly green - peach and a solid array of tropical flavors, with mango, melon, and hints of passion fruit - low bitterness - touch of earth - soft, pale, mostly nonexistent malts
M: Medium body, very smooth, a touch chewy and fuzzy from the abundance of hops, not from malts, finishes with lingering hoppiness
O: How do you tweak an excellent beer? More hops!
Double Dry Hopped Fort Point is categorically different than Fort Point Pale Ale. Why? Because one is a beer, and one is basically a fruit smoothie. The bonus round of hops here is nice, but I actually prefer the remarkably refreshing and drinkable aspects of the original. DDHFP is an experience more than something I would want to drink every day. 1,412 charactersangrybabboon, Oct 06, 2016

4.02/5  rDev -11.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 416oz can, poured into a 12oz chalice. Enjoyed on 8.24.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a turbid and hazy orange color, a finger of white head with good retention and nice lace. The aroma is pleasant, green overripe hops, floral, citrusy and tropical with some mineral water and doughy malt, distinctive Trillium character. The flavors are again, super hoppy, overly so, a theme I am noticing with Trillium now, green, grassy, earthy, piney and herbaceous while some floral character and light fruitiness help to balance this a bit, while a bit of sweet malt comes out. The mouthfeel is good, medium body, lively carbonation, very coating with a soft but dry finish.
Verdict: A nice pale ale from Trillium, but I definitely prefer the Galaxy dry hopped version and even the base version to this beer. Perhaps a pound of two of hops too many for this beer, but this is still a nice pale ale, lots of flavor and still refreshing. 945 characterskevanb, Sep 24, 2016

Beer is a typical muddy NE Ipa. Nose is huge notes of citrus, papaya and a dank, at the same time resiny and fruity hop bitterness. Beer opens orange, grapefruit and grass. Light, citrus and fresh cut grass bitterness in the middle with orange rind and a light bark. More citrus and piney hop presence at the finish. Great balance. Feel is soft, dry and quenching. Couldn't ask for more here. 
It's amazing the amount of flavor Trillium is able to pack into a 6.6% offering. Excellent! 534 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 20, 2016

The hops come in mid-sip, grapefruit peel combined with earthy herbal notes.  Super dry finish with bitterness that fills the back of the mouth, in a good way.  Medium semi-soft feel.  This is one outstanding brew, maybe my favorite by Trillium so far. 485 charactersNolaHopHead, Aug 27, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -5.9%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Look: Turbid, nice white head with lacing
Smell: Tropical hops, pineapple, orange, slight spice/pine (as I smell it, it becomes increasingly hard to differentiate the smells and it becomes one overwhelming tropical smell)
Taste: Same as smell, but as I drink it, I just start tasting tropical hops.  Starts with a mild sweetness and ends with a pleasant bitterness
Feel: smooth feel, almost creamy like, light carbonation.
Overall: A great beer, but as I drink it, I get less complexity, which is a dissapointing... 515 characterslic217, Aug 24, 2016

A: Beer comes in a light gold color with about a finger of fluffy white head comprised of bubbles of tiny to medium size. Head slowly fades to a thin porous layer with a ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Spotty lacing sticks to the glass. Medium-plus haze--not quite as turbid as some of the other Trillium DDH offerings, but damn near close. The slightest hint of transparency gives it a really nice 'glowing' vibrancy.
S: Loads of orange (juice, little bit of zest), pineapple, mango, and peach. Subtler dose of some cooling (minty?) fresh hoppy thing behind that, something like fresh green herbs, but cleaner (and less earthy) than grass.
T: Big pop of tropical and citrus fruits up front. Loads of pineapple, mango, peach, and zesty orange. These are very quickly accompanied by a killer herbaceousness that reminds you just how much Citra is in this beer.. It's so purely hoppy that it almost dries out the mouth, offering a fresh, clean herbal note (maybe basil, pine, and grass) with something of a minty cooling effect? Nice wheaty malt character comes through mid-taste, and the finish is a wonderful fusion of peach, pithy citrus, and green herbs. A true delight of a flavor profile, and one of the best showcases of an incredible hop.
M: Really soft and pillowy on the mouth... Definitely one of the best feels of all the Trillium beers. Has that very full carbonation that is the brewery's signature on the Street and FP series, but it's not overpowering here (and works well to complement the medium-minus weight of this 6.6% "pale ale"). Perfect amount of bitterness is kinda like biting into the white pith of an orange. There's definitely some dryness on the finish of this too, which is very much desired for the style.
O: One of Trillium's best beers. Given all the hype around their special releases, it's the core offerings that I tend to enjoy most thoroughly. Between the Street series and the Fort Point variants alone, Trillium makes some of the best hoppy beers out there with startling consistency. DDHFPPA is a superb showcase of the complexities of the Citra hop and one of my favorite Citra-hopped IPAs (come on, it's 6.6%...) out there. Comparing it to some of my other favorites that I find similar (notably, DDH Pseudosue and Julius), I wish it had it had a bit more explosiveness on the nose and maybe a bit more weight on the body (though the carbonation does a good job accounting for the lightness). But those gripes aside, it's really hard to find flaws with this beer, and I would highly recommend it to any and all lovers of Citra. 2,621 charactersavas, Aug 22, 2016

It looks like pulp free orange juice. Very turbid/murky yellow orange with a foamy white cap. 
Aroma jumps out of the glass. Tons of tropical citrus and floral hops. If you threw a red grapfruit, a mango, and a handful of hops you just grabbed off the bine into a blender with a few flowers from a hibiscus it is what I would imagine it smelling like. 
The flavors are insane! Mango, papaya/cantelope/melon, spicy pineapple, and a boquet of flowers along with some slightly sweet, Club Cracker malts. There is a lot of crisp/zesty rind like bite along with a big punch of bitterness, but the bitterness never lingers. It closes out with a very grainy and fruity aftertaste. 
The body is so light and airy, while being almost chewy at the same time. Very, very soft and delicate. 
While this one might be Zombie Dust like and flirt with the IPA distiction at times, I feel in the end it really is a pale overall, and easily one of the best I have ever had. Better than Sue, Mo, and many others. I must try 1,073 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 19, 2016

I definitely get a sort of lime zest here in addition to what other reviews say.  Reminds me of DDH Sleeper except it has Citra/Galaxy with the Columbus instead of El Dorado with the Columbus.
Bless JC, Esther, and the fine folks at Trilliium and the capacity at new Canton facility.  It's like Alchemist and Tree House, but with so much variety and so much less drama/hassle (still need to work a little for it though - and that's OK with me).  My wife and I had dinner with JC and Esther at a 1-year anniversary dinner event thing, and they are such nice people and are doing everything right in my book.  You need to visit Trillium if you ever come to Boston area. 781 charactersDontWorryHaveaHomebrew, Aug 19, 2016

I know some people might appreciate that. I get lots of melon and grapefruit pith with some pineapple and mango. Great tropical vibe here, but its a little overpowered by the bitter hops. Still an excellent beer and well worth trading for. The mouth feel is medium and drinks bigger than 6.6%. Carbonation is spot on. Glad I got to try this. 436 charactersdanh53, May 06, 2016

L-hazy, golden or more of an orangish yellow, nice head
S-dank and tropical.  The hops popped out right away once the bottle was popped.  I could smell them from about 8 feet away.  Really refreshing
T-tropical bomb!  heavy pineapple, zesty lemon, and mango and then some layers of citrus, a little grapefruit, melon.  Heavy flavors linger for a long time.  Really enjoyable
F-juicy and light.  Not real creamy, but as expected for 6.6%.  As drinkable as water!
O-i have had this super fresh before and this one was a little older, but still a tremendous beer.  the fresh bottle was a little more potent on the taste, but not a whole lot different.  The juiciness and drinkability really did not change.  Love this! 773 charactersrabbott2, Apr 29, 2016

4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours an opaque tropicana orange juice color with a fluffy, two finger bright white head. Retention is excellent and there are many hanging chunks of lacing. Smell is tropical fruit, citrus and dankness. Mango, tangerine, and grapefruit are the brightest hop notes. Taste is the same with a fresh cut grass note as well. Feel is light side of medium, juicy, smooth and resinous. There is a slight prickliness from the bitterness on the finish. Overall just outstanding. Although it is certainly a hop bomb, I understand the designation as a pale ale. Trillium is really the best of the best. 601 charactersCNoj012, Apr 22, 2016

A:	
Pours a pulpy white peach color with a frothy little finger and a half cap of beige head that makes it look just a little bit more like juice as it settles to next to nothing.  Meh retention; some speckled lacing.  (4)	
S:	
Nectarines and lime zest.  Stone fruit, lemon and pez with a slight citrus tartness in the background, grapefruit, peach and grass clippings.  (4.5)	
T:	
Thick, dry hay-like hops with loads of grapefruit at the end.  Grassy, dusty hop bitterness at first with a little light citrus sweetness in the middle and a slightly resinous earthy bitterness that lingers in the finish.  (4.5)	
M:	
Softish carbonation, medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel, sticky grapefruit peel aftertaste.  (4.25)	
O:	
Very good IPA from Trillium that showcase Citra as well as I think you probably can.  
It looks pretty decent in the glass, but that is its weakest point.  The aroma is bright and fruity but also a little dusky with some herbal hop notes complimenting the tart pop that the rest of it has.  The flavor is similar, starting out pretty dry before getting increasingly juicy with a big wave of grapefruit that leaves an oil lasting bitter tingle in your mouth.  
Very enjoyable and as drinkable as could be hoped for on a beer this intensely hoppy.  (4.5) 1,318 charactersTheDoctor, Apr 19, 2016

Palate Contaminants: meat for dinner
Bottle number three from Trillium.
Appearance is typical Trillium: opaque medium amber, fruit-juice like, fine carbonation, and not much lacing in the glass.
Smell is dominant pineapple and nectarines. I'm not getting anything that I would ordinarily think of as hops. This smells the most like fruit juice of the Trilliums I've had so far.
Well, I gets hops on the taste. There's less pear than with Scaled Way Up, and there's some fresh cut lawn in there. Peaches, definitely. Then there's something I've only found in red wine, flint. Finally, there's more bitterness on the back end than the others I've tried thus far. Incidentally, a gulp of water seems to knock the bitterness back and leave just the fruit flavors.
The feel is par for Trillium: moderately carbonated and smooth. 849 charactersZythophile, Apr 16, 2016

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5In the same way that Tree House has this undeniable creaminess, Trillium has mastered this balanced smoothness that I have not seen so consistently from any other brewer. This essentially double citra APA is much better than Hill Farmstead's in my opinion. A beautiful yellow orange haze with 1.5 finger head. The aroma is rather strong of grapefruit and some other tropical fruits. The taste is somewhat more tame with oranges and more grapefruit. The feel is truly polished soft with minimal bitterness but in tact complexity. Might be favorite so far from Trillium. 568 charactersTrevor11, Apr 11, 2016

L: similar to MDHFPPA from last night as well as Congress St IPA, hazy orangeish, similar frothy head that settles down pretty quickly
S: yep, all that and more, the range of citrus you'd expect and again, pretty similar to the two from last night
T: more hoppy as you'd expect from MDHFPPA and Congress St, I liked it, while I initially thought the other two were a bit soft, I did grow to like that smoother less in your face style. Tonite's brew is more like what i'm used to, bigger mouth, stronger flavors that work for me.
F: wicked mouth coating, piney, slight bitter bite at the end, not too much, really good

Pours a typical Trillium bright, cloudy orange juice body with a big frothy white head that reduces to leave chunky lacing and retention. 
Tropical, grassy, raw hop aromas, mangos and clementine. On the tongue is citrus, grapefruit, orange, tangerine, pineapple, bursting fruits, finished by a light hop resinous bite. Medium body very drinkable. Low carbonation. 
As expected this is amazing, world class. 516 charactersgcamparone, Apr 06, 2016

Pours an opaque gold with a frothy white foam head. Smells like strong peaches, mangos, pineapple, guava, nectarine, orange citrus, grapefruit, with fresh pine and dank grass. Tastes like huge nectarines, mango, peach, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, guava, with dank pine and earthy grass. Feels medium bodied, creamy with low carbonation.

S - sticky candied pineapple and a dank breadiness. Juicy tropical fruit. 
T - fresh cut pineapple upfront, evolving into juice-like undertones of mango and citrusy grapefruit rind acidity. Finishes with an unbelievably fresh blast of grass, flowers and mint leaves. Refreshing. Classic dank Trillium sweetness and an amped up hoppiness on the finish. Leaves a drying, tart, malty dankness when all is said and done, courtesy of the dry hopping. 
F - light and refreshing, but tight and compact. Silky smooth. 
O - much better than the original Fort Point. Tons of flavor and complexity layered on thick for a juicy delicious new. 745 charactersagreenman19, Apr 02, 2016

Look: Nice and hazy, as most IPA's and pale aled from the North are. Hardly and head but a nice lacing is left on the glass. 
Smell: Smells very dank. A slight urea type smell comes through. Tones of citrus and a bit of berry also appear. 
Taste: Tastes amazing. Super dank and fruity/citrusy. There's a bit of an earthy/floral taste too. 
Feel: Smooth and light, as a pale ale should be. This is blurring the lines between a pale ale and an IPA. 
Overall: This is my first Trillium bottle out of the 12 that I got. I sampled this on draft at the Canton facility and it was pretty good but it's actually a bit better in the bottle. If this is what their pale tastes like, I could imagine how great their IPA's are. 772 charactersTHSmusicman, Mar 27, 2016

3.87/5  rDev -14.8%look: 3 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75I have no issue real with the "turbidity" of this beer, although I can't say it looks great. 
The tropical and citrus in the nose is amazing, and those flavors are dominant in the taste department as well. Yes, it's another Trillium "juice bomb." 
The mouthfeel has that fullness that we've come to expect, too.
My issue with this beer is that the malt bill is so weak that the finish is a bit too dry for my taste.  No backbone. If this were supposed to be an over-hopped wheat beer I could forgive this aspect, and I know that Trillium puts white wheat is many of their beers. If this delicious beer had a bit more sack, I'd be a raving fanboy. I get that the hops are the star and that you don't want anything to get in the way of that happy goodness, but throw in a little more 2-row, will ya?
Quite enjoyable nonetheless, but just misses the mark for me. 859 charactersandylipp, Mar 20, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated 12/5/15. Wish I had opened this a bit sooner but oh well. Pours a deep orange/amber with lots of haze and a nice frothy head. Smell isn't very strong, but I get pineapple, mango, citrus, and some herbal qualities. Taste is very tropical up front with some grapefruit rind and malty sweetness. This is maybe why I should've opened this a bit sooner. The malt really cuts through and takes away some of the hoppy flavor. No lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little on the thick side. Creamy, like most hoppy New England beers. Carbonation is a little low, but that could be because this was somewhat of a gusher. Overall, a very good APA, but not as great as I had hoped. Pier blew me away, but this...not so much. Wish I could've gotten it fresher. 763 charactersMisSigsFan, Jan 10, 2016

The nose is filled with an opulent aroma of tropical fruit, mangoes, pineapples, and some grapefruit citrus. That tropical fruit presents itself upfront, followed by some nice citrus grapefruit and lime. The mouthfeel on this beer is incredible, soft, inviting, lush. Regular FPPA is one of my favorite beers period, but oh hey, let's try to pack more flavor into this thing. An excellent pale ale. 491 charactersSheppard, Dec 13, 2015

Pours a hazy pale yellow with hints of gold and a finger of white head, good retention and lacing. Aroma is very hoppy. Lots of tropical fruit, mostly mango and a touch of pineapple with some slight herbal notes in the background. Great taste, very juicy and hoppy. Again mostly tropical fruits with mango most prominent. Herbal flavors are present in the finish with moderate bitterness. Good mouthfeel, medium-light plus body and moderate carbonation. Overall a great beer. Typical Trillium hazy and juiciness, very enjoyable. 605 charactersmnj21655, Dec 09, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I'll be brief and blunt, but helpful in my review.
This beer's nose is wonderful.  It smells of grapefruit and is very citrusy.  It's like you just threw 10 grapefruits in a blender and stuck your head in the blender to smell it after you mixed them.
It is very thick and cloudy.  You can't see through the glass at all.  In fact you can compare it to looking through the blender you just mixed the grapefruit in.  
The taste is mind-blowing.  If 95% of breweries did a pale ale like this, I would have to get a small loan to buy all the pale ales I could.  I wish there was a ancillary category for this style of beer it is so different from any other pale/ipa I have tasted other than a neighboring brewery to them.  I'm not sure what the mind set is in Massachusetts, but I like it.  
I shared this beer with 4 other people, and 2 of these people are not IPA or pale ale fans.  They were almost speechless because they had never tasted or smelled a beer like this before.  Everyone talked about the nose on it the whole time and how they couldn't believe how much aroma it had.  
Hope my real life review helped.  Cheers. 1,129 charactersDroopy487, Oct 30, 2015

Appearance: VIbrant orange and hazy, looking almost exactly like orange juice. A nice, puffy head on top, with long-lasting retention. Tons of sticky lacing throughout. Truly a beautiful brew.
Aroma: All tropical fruit and juiciness. Layer upon layer of citrus, with orange, grapefruit, and notes of lemon coming through. Soooooooooooooo pungent.
Taste: Incredible hop profile, with tons of juiciness and deliciousness. Base malt is evident, but balance is definitely way tipped in favor of hops. Which is awesome. This beer is delectable.
Feel: soft-medium body, with a nice crispness on this finish, to go with a lingering bitterness of grapefruit rind. 
Overall: One of the best pale ales (though its definitely bordering on, if not already an IPA) in the world. 802 charactersTheElectricOne, Oct 25, 2015

One of the most beautiful looking beers I've ever seen - a beautiful golden haze, there must be orange juice with pulp added, it's that thick looking
Aroma is all tropical fruit nothing else, I feel like I'm in the rainforest in IPA land, it's amazing!
Tastes smooth as a mother, tons of Passionfruit and butter!
Damn this is good, mouthfeel is great, a bit of a kick compared to FPPA

A - Very hazy pale yellow color that looks like it could be pure OJ. Brilliant white 2 finger head that fades very slowly and leaves a thin cap for the session. Terrific webbed lacing splattered around the glass. 
S - Oh my! The aroma is so juicy! The hops used in this have high citrus aroma like a glass of orange and grapefruit juice, with hints of mango and guava. There is also a bitter element to it. 
F - Like citrus and tropical hoped APAs? This will be one of your all time favorites! Makes me think if Zombie dust and grapefruit sculpin had a love child. I can't even describe all the citrus and tropical flavors along with the medium bitterness. 
M - Superb feel and perfect carbonation with a juicy, yet dry finish.

Pours a murky, hazy gold out of the bottle with a moderate head that lasts; there's no chance you're seeing through the other side of the glass. Dank, dank, dank, hoppy aroma bursts forth and and dominates the senses. Taste is earthy, citrus and pine. Unbelievably hoppy but not too imbalanced as there's enough malt to anchor the taste without being cloy. Heavy bitterness; I'm talking real bitter, like the guy who dumped his high school girlfriend only to see her become rich, gorgeous and move in next door. Clearly Trillium is at the top of their game and this is a prime example. 603 charactersManapuaMan, Aug 10, 2015

Smell is clean tropical fruits and puppies and dreams, taste somehow follows up with more punch and power than the nose, with a feel that is both silky and sneaky good. Clearly an IPA, clearly the best I've had, rivals the feeling I got when I had my first Cantillon. Well done Trillium, you guys are the best. 465 charactersmardolin, Aug 09, 2015

4.64/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle, approximately 3 weeks of age. Served in a snifter glass.
Pours an incredibly hazy, cloudy medium yellow body, two finger white head with perfect effervescence and retention. This is the pitch-perfect picture of a New England-style pale ale. Lots of rings of lacing. Smells of rich tropical fruit, mango, passion fruit, citrus, a mild pale malt backbone. Whoa. Hops galore. Flavour is an incredibly refreshing tropical fruit flavour, very much like the Juicy Fruit gum, except the flavour is certainly much more authentic. A bit of grass, grapefruit also complements the tropical fruits. Minimal caramel sweetness pokes its head out just enough to provide the requisite balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, fluffy, incredibly refreshing and drinkable. Not particularly bitter. A bit of grapefruit flavour on the finish that serves as a nice transition and change of pace from the tropical fruit flavours. Overall, this was a very impressive APA with a ton of tropical fruit and citrus hop character. Not only that, it is so crushable and leaves you wanting more. Absolutely worth going after. 1,106 charactersStevedore, Jul 22, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy pale-yellow color with a froth, big head.
Offers a fantastic nose of fresh cut grass, water melon and ripe orange. The hops create an intense aroma, gently balanced by bready malts. Creates a ridiculous juiciness, reminding me of fruit juice with lemon zest blending into luscious, sun bathed oranges. 
Has a medium carbonation, with a supersoft, slightly mineralic mouthfeel. This showcases the hops in the best way possible, as there are no distractions whatsoever, very refreshing on the palate.
Tastes of aqueous minerals, setting the bar for the beers incredibly soft, almost silk mouthfeel. Hops do hover above this foundation on from the very beginning, while turning a lot grassier, as the carbonation rushes through, also revealing a profound dankness with crisp lemon zest on top. The hops turn even more complex by revealing hints of ripe orange, prickly kiwi and water melon which perfectly add to the beers dankness. Finishes with a leaf inspired dryness, among which rock sugar sparkled malts turn visible for a short glance, which then get wrapped up by sour, slightly slick lemon and juicy orange.
The nose on this blows me away, revealing an amazing, crisp diversity, which is nothing but perfect. It showcases a wider variety of aromas, which all come together perfectly, leaving no desire unfullfilled. Aromas get beautifully converted into the taste, providing a fantastic mouthfeel with lemon and oranges, with an enjoyable intensity, while remaining refreshing and easy drinkable. 1,519 charactersaleigator, Jul 18, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Kevin for gifting me the bottle.
A- Turbid and severely hazy pale yellow pour from the 750ml bottle to a few glasses. Large, thick creamy white head makes it to a few fingers with great retention. Massive ring drops large webs and drizzled lace.
S- Mango nectar in the spotlight with fruits and floral tones beyond that. Orange peel and juice, tangerines, clementine, peach, dank herbs and slight melon. Clean yeast and grains.
T- Smooth and juicy flavor profile driven by the hops. Huge mango again leads off to a blast of hops with oranges, tangerine, apricot, cantaloupe, herbs, melon and citrus zest. A bit more reserved that I expected but suits the APA style.
MF- Smooth, crisp and fairly creamy overall consistency. Carbonation is medium to high and it all ends with a slight bitterness.
Tons of hops with the mango tropical fruits up front and a fruit basket with some herbs beyond that. Smooth and it doesn't quite reach hop juice levels staying an APA somehow. Not quite as good as PseudoSue for me but definitely in that ballpark. 1,053 characterscbutova, Jul 17, 2015

The bottles are still amazing, but the taste of this brew from the growler only 3 days after it was poured...probably the tastiest beer I have had to date.

This beer was hyped before I tried it (which was the reason I traded for it in the first place), and it still blew me away. The aroma hit me as I poured it, and I stopped to take in its essence for a good 30 seconds or so before I continued pouring....the best smelling hoppy beer in the history of the universe? Likely. Then I looked at it. God damn, what a juicy, beautiful looking beer...then the taste - my god...Ive never did a tasting double take, but I had to do it here.  Upon second sip, my first impression was confirmed. This is what flawless tastes like. Just a ridiculous offering from the hop masters at Trillium. Worth trading your first born for. 691 characterswingnutter, Jul 11, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle shared by Curran tonight, thanks man.
This one pours so turbid and hazy, looks like thick orange juice, with a one inch head, and tons of lacing. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that is unfiltered.
This smells awesome just a huge orange, mango, and grapefruit aroma, sweet but dank as well.
As expected, this is turbid and delicious. So so juicy and citrusy, so much grapefruit and orange, a bit of herbal grassiness, and absolutely no malt backbone that I can detect. This has to be one of the juiciest beers I've ever had.
This is fairly thick bodied, not quite milkshake-esque, but still pretty thick. The carbonation level is lower, I'd say.
Another perfectly awesome hop masterpiece from Trillium. 718 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jul 10, 2015

Like most Trillium beers, this has a very crisp mouthfeel, complemented nicely with its hoppy, dry finish. The mango component of both the aroma and the taste puts this beer in the upper echelon of beers! 313 charactersMA_hops, May 18, 2015

4.6/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75This pours an incredibly hazy, orange juice and 7-Up, punch color. Some are turned off by hazy-looking beer, but I love it. 
The smell is incredibly juicy with just a hint of freshly mowed grass for good measure. Not at all complex, but an absolutely lovely aroma. 
The taste is much like the nose, very, very juicy with some pine notes. Subtle, yet incredibly well balanced between the sweetness of the orange and bitterness of the piney hops. 
The carbonation is fairly high in this one, but not overly so. Ultimately It goes down nice and smooth just like a good pale ale should. 
Overall I am very impressed with this offering. It's subtle, it's not overly complex, but damn is it good. 694 charactersScaryEd, May 15, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25I love Trillium's takes on Fort Point. This one pours with the look of orange juice and as with all Trillium beers it is beautiful.  Smell is hoppy and danky but not overwhelming which for the price I wish it were.  Taste is like a slightly hoppier fort point, but again: light and not overwhelming.  Overall this is not my favorite take on Fort Point.  At $12 a bottle (compared to $8 for regular Fort Point or the superior Mosiac Fort Point) it is expensive for a beer that is on the lighter side from an aroma and taste standpoint.  Still very good so I can't rate it too low.  Worth having once but I would choose regular Fort Point at an $8 price over this slightly hoppier version at a $12 price point. I promise I'm not cheap, just value conscious. 755 charactersSellmatt, May 15, 2015

4.04/5  rDev -11%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Thanks to EnronCFO for the opportunity to try this one.  750ml bottle filled on 11.22.14.  Pours a hazy orange-gold with a dense, two inch, white head.  Head exhibits excellent retention but leaves thick, textured swaths of lacing as it recedes.  Nose expresses citrus, tropical pit fruit and perhaps a hint of Simcoe and/or Summit. Taste consistent with nose; however, tropical fruit qualities in the nose are quite diminished and there is a light Simcoe (cat pee) and/or Summit (oniony) presence on a light, biscuity malt backbone.  There's also a hint of an earthy/herbal  bitterness that lingers between quaffs  Mouthfeel on this beer is great - light in body with a creamy texture, an even carbonation and a slight citrus astringency.  Overall, a very drinkable APA.  Not too assertive, but just enough complexity to keep it both interesting and refreshing.
Note from the brewer: Hops profile is Columbus and mostly Citra. 928 charactersJwale73, Dec 07, 2014

The extra dry hopping muddies the beer and adds extra bitterness that's more akin to the bitterness from trub than it is from alpha acid. Can was 13 days old and hop profile was completely muted on the nose. Wish the malt profile had more character. Not bad just was left unfulfilled. 382 charactersjbertsch, Nov 26, 2014
4.74/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. This was bottled 3 days ago - on 11/22/14.
Appearance: Pours a bright honey/amber and leaves a couple fingers of slightly off white head, which slowly fade to a layer atop the beer. (4.5)
Smell: Big, vibrant citrus (esp. grapefruit), pineapple, a bit of piney resin, and more citrus. Really expressive, delicious aroma. (4.75)
Taste: Earthy, resinous notes, grapefruit juice, good amount of pine & spruce, orange, some pineapple. A huge amount of different flavors, all delicious. Very drinkable and smooth, even with all the flavor. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium to well carbonated with a medium, slightly creamy body. Very nice with the flavors. (4.75)
Overall: This is a delicious, hoppy brew. I love the amount of pine in the taste, and while the aroma is much fruitier, there is a bit more earthiness in the taste. Really well balanced with a terrific smell, wonderful taste and an awesome piney finish. (4.75) 970 charactersResuin, Nov 25, 2014

4.51/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a 32 fluid ounces growler purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
Served in a pint glass
The super cloudy, yellow ochre liquid was topped by a tight, fluffy, near three-finger tall head. The crown faded to a thin film. Minimal lacing. A few drippy streaks trickled down the glass.
The aroma was amazing. Super hoppy, fruity and juicy. Loads of tangerine and orange notes. Tropical fruits also came through strong. Mango and papaya were noticeable. Quite peachy. Touch of pine sap. There was an intensely dank, weed-like presence as well. All in all, remarkably intense and complex.
The flavor profile was also impressive, yet not quite at the same level as the aroma. Super hoppy and fruity, but more bitter than I anticipated. Orange peel dominated initially. Loads of pinesap. Like in the nose, the dank, weed-y hops were quite apparent. There was a strong peach flavor and subtle tropical fruitiness. White grapefruit came through strong on the finish. More pine resin appeared here as well. After every sip, the bitter pine and grapefruit notes lingered.
On the palate, the beer was lighter bodied, yet creamy, fluffy and smooth. Remarkably supple and slick.
Trillium's original Fort Point Pale Ale is an amazingly complex and intense version of the style, and the double dry hopped version pushes the envelope even further. While I really enjoyed this, I found it to be slightly more bitter and less drinkable than the original Fort Point. DDH almost seemed like a cross between Fort Point Pale Ale and their Congress Street IPA. 1,560 charactersDamian, Jun 10, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Double Dry Hopped Fort Point pours a glowing, hazy honey yellow with some orange hues mixed in. The foam is a couple fingers thick, creamy and slow to disappear. As it fades a netted pattern of lace clings to the glass.
The aroma is loaded with citrus. Tangerine, orange and lemon peel are all present. Some mango is also present.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is dry with mild carbonation. The flavor is much like the aroma, loaded with tangerine and orange citrus. The tropical fruit (mango, pineapple) is more pronounced in the flavor, than the aroma. There's some honey flavored sweetness and a touch of pale malt in the background trying desperately to balance out the bitterness. A little bit of pepper appears near the end. It finishes bitter with some pine hop notes. Once gone the the citrus and tropical fruit lingers on the palate.
This is a super tasty beer with tons of hops and a fair amount of bitterness. It's very easy to drink, but I found the body on the dry side. Very delicious! 1,008 charactersWanderingFool, Jun 08, 2014
4.84/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Teku from 32 oz Trillium growler
A - backlit bright orange with mousse-like head that holds firm and dissipates slowly
S - tropical fruit orgy. Over-ripe Mango and pineapple. Behind the fruit is a nice fresh dankness. Hard to believe this is a pale ale, best aroma I've experienced for the style. 
T - initial sip brings a ipa bitterness but that is only perception as the subsequent sips are light and refreshing. Light, clean, refreshing and crushable. Definitely a pale ale
M - light malt and great mouthfeel from the hops. No confusion this is a pale ale a shops dominate.
O - probably the best pale ale I've had. Incredibly drinkable with a aggressive dry hops that kick this phenomenal pale to another level. The nose is unforgettable and a must for any hophead. World class stuff. 806 charactersfatsnowman22, Jun 07, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 32oz growler picked up at the brewery on 5/30/14 into a Trillium glass. Not going to lie, I'm been looking forward to this ever since I saw that it was in the works. I'm a huge fan of Trillium and their Fort Point Pale Ale in particular.
A) Pours a hazy, bright golden orange with not much of a head. Thinking I should have poured a bit more aggressively, but I was being cautious. Absolutely beautiful.
S) How can you beat this? Juicy tropical hop aromas just bursting from this thing right as I opened the growler. Can't get enough of this. My nose is just glued to the glass.
T) Yeah, you get the same as the nose. Here you obviously get more of the tropical hoppiness as well as the pinyness you expect from an amazingly hoppy brew. Just enough malt to balance the brew.
M) Slightly bitter and leaves a great flavor on the back of the tongue. Very smooth.
O) Just about perfect. Again, I'm a huge fan of FFPA and this just turns the volume up to eleven. This is a must try. Hope they brew this again in the future. 1,037 charactershuddyball, Jun 01, 2014

S-Aroma is absolutely orgasmic. A concentrated, perfumey, plethora of tropical fruit hoppiness. Each sniff reminded me of passion fruit. Melons, pineapple, mango and a bouquet of citrus. I love the original Fort Point but this was legendary in the aroma.
T-Bright, tropical fruit juice to the Nth degree. A farmer's market of hoppy fruit flavors. I could name about a dozen different fruits it reminds me of but it essentially tastes like a blended medley of fruit juice. Delectable hoppiness. It finishes with a dry, crisp maltiness that gives off a crispy cracker flavor that does a good job of complementing the hoppiness.
M-Bitter and medium bodied. Very drinkable. The aftertaste lingers forever. A pleasant, smooth texture to the beer as well. I could put a hurting on a growler of this.
O/D-Unbelievable. The original Fort Point is also a beauty; one of my favorite local beers. This one adds just enough pop to make it one of the best beers I have had maybe ever. 1,113 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 22, 2014
4.29/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours some bubbly white head that dissipates quickly. The beer has a very hazy yellow color with hints of orange. The texture looks a bit similar to juice but still looks like beer. The beer smell is fairly hoppy and tropical. The primary smell is the grapefruit hoppy smell with grass notes similar to that after a nice rain. Some other tropical notes exist such as pineapple and a little bit of orange but the grass and grapefruit smell dominate the nose. The taste is a bit similar with a strong grapefruit taste and an undercurrent of orange. Additionally, there is a small and tiny bready malt taste. The hops are fairly strong. The taste is certainly very tropical. The beer is medium bodied but on the heavier side. The carbonation is biting. Overall,a pretty good and hoppy variation and certainly more tropical than the original fort point. 858 charactersHattedClassic, Mar 21, 2014
