S:  Smells of juicy citrusy hops with some herbal notes and a hint of stone fruit.
T:  Taste is light citrus with some herbal and earthy notes with that slight stone fruit.  Hints of malt sweetness as well as some oily hops.  Swallow is more juicy citrus and herbal earthy notes with some lingering stone fruit,
M:  The beer has a medium amount of body with a slick feel on the palate.  Carbonation is adequate and just slightly prickly.  The beer also has an oily hop finish that is fairly refreshing.
O:  Overall this is another well made beer from Tree House.  It has good flavors and complexity along with that classic hazy look you expect from a NE IPA.  It still isn't what I would consider earth shattering though. 858 charactersSHODriver, Jun 26, 2017

4.84/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Got this in a trade along with Haze. Hoping it lives up to the hype!
Look: beautiful opaque golden orange. Quarter inch of white foam. Heavy lace clinging to the glass.
Smell: a mild aroma, but incredibly smooth, tropical notes. Pineapple and tangerine really come through, with a bitter grapefruit in the finish that rides alongside a subtle hop bitterness.
Taste: Again, a subtle creaminess starts this off, but crescendos into an awesome citrus profile, dominated by tangerines and nectarines. Grapefruit again hits about midway, and a pretty strong hop bitterness stings the back of your mouth, but in the best way possible. 
Feel: creamy, mild carbonation, very refreshing. Perfect body weight, little to no residual finish.
What I loved the most about this beer was how subtly incredible it really was. All the components snuck up on me from a body that was so creamy and refreshing that I wish more IPAs stood out in this way. A real home run, I'm beginning to see the Tree House hype and why it exists so strongly. 1,024 charactersWickedBeer, Jun 20, 2017

Smell: Fruity citrus, with some tropical fruit bites
Taste: Delicious Juicy IPA. Light and soft on the palate but a beautiful juice flavor throughout.
Feel: Nice and lite, nice and flavorful. No bitterness

4.45/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to DustinGalvin for this 16 oz. can, one of 120 that he sent my way recently. Cool, Escheresque blue artwork dated 5/5/17. Dig. 
The pour is just like the cool kids like it, 50/50 pineapple & orange juice (I was not one of the cool kids; but you probably knew that, since I write long beer reviews in my basement watching Battlestar Galactica). To be a stereotype this smells like tropical fruit, peach ascendant, Standard good. 
Alter Ego mimics Julius like an annoying younger sister; wish I’d had these side by side, because it matches up closely to my memory & yes, I just peeked at my old review. Same burst of tropical fruit, same peachiness on top with a strong, lingering aftertaste of overripe oranges, papaya, harsh pine bark shavings. Bitterness comes late but sticks to the palate, & isn’t as aggressive as its base…but I love how it hangs around. The moderate bitterness is offset by the fact that it lingers & lingers & lingers. Not sure how the brewers do that, but I approve. No idea what is ‘pillowy’ about this: it’s tropical fruit with a knife’s edge of bitterness. This should come in bigger cans. 
Contrary to popular myth, not everything this brewery puts out is touched by virginal gods, but this one might have brushed a nipple or two. Fantastic beer. 1,299 charactersmaximum12, May 23, 2017

Smell is huge and tropical. Pineapple, citrus, mostly grapefruit. Level after level of fruity goodness just invades your nostrils.
The taste is... perfect. It's out of this world. All the citrus and pineapple are on the dancefloor here, with a bit if orange peel and a perfect bitterness, that only accentuates the fruit even more. Balance is unreal, as is layering of flavors.
Mouthfeel is divine, like having the tastiest pillow ever in your mouth. Soft, velvety and just perfect.
Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It is just superb. 594 charactersJamFuel, Apr 19, 2017

Drinking out or a one week old growler so I could be missing out on some flavors that's from different from the cans. It's still an easy drinking one that's more session than a 8%. Then again TH is great at hiding the alcohol. 348 charactersTola, Mar 03, 2017

S: tea and mint, nice base malt aromas and strangely different from what I might have expected.  Light citrus , some mango citrus rind and very light pineapple in the back but not as I miss get have been expecting.  Different and nice 
T: lots of rich slightly unripened mango and less ripe pineapple.  Very smooth and tropical all around.  The base beer is well rounded and not as fruity sweet as Julius from memory but different and very nice in its own way.  The flavors here are very different for an American IPA and one of a kind fro, those that Inhave extensively tried.    
M: thick chewy body for an American IPA and lighter carbonation 
O: overall a home rum triumph 745 charactersalpinebryant, Feb 24, 2017

Canned 12/15/16
A- pours a murky golden orange color with a big two-finger frothy and foamy white head that has great retention long after the pour, leaving some lacing behind
S- opens with a  big blast of citrus juice and fresh mint sprigs, followee by tropical notes of mango, guava & pineapple.  Earthy and herbal mosaic notes mixes with notes of black tea, just a hint of underlying sweet malt
T- tastes like a glass of fresh juice; orange juice, pineapple juice, muddled mint leaves, mango & passionfruit.  Beyond the juice, herbal/earthy notes compliment the fruity notes.  The finish is dry, with a linger of fresh citrus
M- medium body and carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a crisp finish
O- As expected, a juice bomb that has a drinkability that can't be beat.  This goes down way too easy 841 charactersTreyliff, Feb 02, 2017

Appear: A really hazy goldish orange. Pours with a finger of thick head with lots (and I mean lots) of lacing. 
Smell: Citrus explosion of orange, pineapple, and mango. A slight aroma of malt in there too.
Taste: The fruit taste is dominant with those mosaic hops adding the malt taste. I taste more of the orange and pineapple than anything else but I get a hint of lemon with it. Some other melons in there sticking with the fruit texture. A fantastic mix of fruit and hops.
Feel: Not much bitterness and the tropical notes hang around long after each drink. A little carbonation.
Overall: A fantastic fruity bomb with some juicy bitterness. An IPA that I could ever everyday. Reminds me of a Julius with a nice change. 779 charactersKdouble, Jan 29, 2017

Appear: light golden hazy goodness.  2fingers of nice dense bubble head off white egg shell.  
Nose: Citrus bomb as expected.  little floral.  citrus is grapefruit orange. a little dank. a little mango.  
Taste: follows the nose.  tasty there's a bitter and thinning note on the back end that I don't remember the first time I had this beer.  Taste is a little more bitter than I remember too.  nice malty backbone.  it's actually alot more dank on the palate pine herbal notes then on nose.  interesting. 
Mouth: nice creamy smooth but thins some on the swallow 
Over:  ANother solid brew from Tree House.  I like how it's not just a juice bomb.  I like the more bitter hop notes on the palate.  Solid brew. 773 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 19, 2017

Aroma is all hops, citrus rind/grapefruit, mango, orange, hints of pine, dankness. The Mosaic and Amarillo definitely led the aroma
Taste follows aroma citrus rind, grapefruit, orange, mango, pine, resinous towards the finish not as sweet as their flagship Julius and increased bitterness on the finish.
Can definitely tell there is a use of Mosaic and Amarillo hops.
Mouth feel is slick, moderate carbonation.

I may be crazy, but I believe their beers all smell quite similar - Ripe oranges first, followed by melon/mango.  This beer is more balanced than some of their other beers with the sweetness and bitterness; however, I prefer their sweeter offerings.  This one leaves the mouth a bit drier, but it's got a solid medium body with good carbonation.  I'd gladly drink this one again. 474 characterszizouandyuki, Dec 28, 2016

T- Citrus, tropical fruits, floral, piney, slightly dank, like the nose this make me think of a hop pellet in liquid form.
M- Smooth medium body.
O- A great IPA.  My favorite part of home brewing is opening up a fresh bag of hops and smelling it, and this reminds me of that.  Pure hop goodness! 515 characterslarryi86, Dec 23, 2016

The beer pours a nice copper color, hazy and turbid with a thick white head, great retention and lots of soapy lace. The aroma is very nice, lots of citrus peel and lightly bitter pine, earthy hop spice, sticky resin, wildflower and grassiness, loads of earthy and bitter hops burst from the glass with sweet cereal grains counterbalancing the nose. The flavors jump out as well, grassy and bitter piney hops, citrus peel, a bit of peachy stone fruit, light alcohol warmth with a sweet malt bill, cereal grains and a classic NE yeast flavor lingers. The mouthfeel is nice, coating medium body, active carbonation that's very smooth and gentle with a dry and warm finish.
Verdict: A nice IPA from Tree House, lots of flavor, a bit yeasty and a bit grassy and earthy for my preference, but quite refreshing and quenching. A bit boozy for not even 7% alcohol, but still a solid IPA. 996 characterskevanb, Dec 11, 2016

Did I eat too soon before sampling? was my growler not cleaned thoroughly enough? Did my can experience too much of a temperature fluctuation? Did it need to age a week more?  I don't know yet...I am no expert,  but Alter Ego is a good example of what I mean.  I first sampled AE in a growler, then from a can then from a growler again.  i was very satisfied with my first two experiences...but along came THE growler from the last time ... i was only going to reward myself with just a 5 oz sample but like THE batch of Double Shot 500, Cosmic Forces aligned...the whole bottle was gone before I knew it and it was perfect...I pictured myself in some kind of Roman beer cistern wearing robes and happy to be alive.  I appreciate the others makers and I am not a slave to convention or sheep-think but  I am hooked on what TH stands for and the results they get.  Pine, mango, citrus, straw dank or skank it does not matter. It was utterly delicious. 1,094 charactersMikee440, Dec 04, 2016

A: This Mosaic and Amarillo riff on flagship Julius pours, surprisingly, not completely opaque. Certainly it is very hazy, but light does get through, and it thankfully falls just shy of the muddy-swamp-water levels of murkiness. It is a pure, bright orange and is topped by a rocky, dense layer of bone white head. Retention is excellent, lasting for minutes, and lacing is very good. Carbonation seems moderate, where it should be. This is a perfect example of an NE IPA, which is surprising from Tree House and more expected of their Massachusetts counterpart Trillium. 5/5
A: Mosaic is certainly the dominant force here with pineapple, mango, and that distinctive blueberry note that can be found in very special beers featuring the hop. Sharp lemonade lies underneath, probably the contribution of the Amarillo. Lime and green strawberry are even further down, right next to a soft pithy and vegetal bitterness. The maltiness is mostly there for adding juice to the fruits, but it also adds a kiss of honey and a light breadiness. This is an amazing-smelling beer. 5/5
T: The taste follows the aroma almost to the letter but with a minor, creeping flaw: that Tree House flavor of awkward, unfinished yeastiness; here, it is luckily only mild, but it cannot be ignored. There is also a weird classic pink bubblegum note that Tree House also falls victim to in many offerings. Other than those two flaws, this is a Mosaic-fest. Pineapple, mango, and blueberry again reign supreme, with that green strawberry and lime evident in the middle of each sip. Juicy, lightly sweet lemonade is a latecomer but more than welcome all the same. Honeyed malt and doughy bread provide a wonderful backdrop, and the aftertaste is all grassy, spicy, vegetal bitterness and a little bit of grain. Alcohol is surprisingly noticeable at only 6.8%, another minor issue. Were it not for those flaws, this could be one of the best Mosaic-centric beers ever brewed. As is, it is merely very good. 4.5/5
M: The alcohol also rears its head here, to the slight detriment of Tree House's usually stellar mouthfeel. This is creamy, on the fuller side of medium, softly carbed, and a great combination of dry and sticky on the finish. Unfortunately, the alcohol is evident with a little fusel astringency and more heat than is acceptable in a beer this low in ABV. 4.25/5
O: Another day, another Tree House beer that is superior to the overrated Julius. These are obviously close (they are largely the same recipe after all) so maybe it is my personal preference for Mosaic over Citra, but this is preferable to Julius in almost every way. It is worth noting that when it was fresher, that unfinished flavor that I find intolerable was much more prominent; speculatively, perhaps these NE IPA brewers are releasing their cans too early? Maybe they need a little bit of conditioning to balance out, as this can today, from that same 9/28 batch that I found very underwhelming (I did not review it), is drinking very, very well. If Julius is The Beatles, this is Captain Beefheart, and as such, pair it with underrated, overlooked classic "Trout Mask Replica." 4.5/5 3,164 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Dec 02, 2016

I drive 5+ hrs round trip to come home with 8-12 beers depending on the day and it's so worth it. 297 charactersryno6616, Nov 17, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -4.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Not much to look at. Like the other TH cans I've had the nose is an intense bouquet of citrus that dominates everything else. I actually found the taste to be a bit subdued compared to other NE-style pale ales. A tad more hop presence than others as well, making it slightly better balanced overall. If you want a direct comparison, I'd say the nose is more subdued than Juilus but the taste is slightly more complex, with a similar mouthfeel and finish. 454 charactersswanfungus, Nov 03, 2016

4.41/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Alter Ego pours almost identical to its twin - Julius. It's an opaque orange, with a finger of white head. Head retention is modest, but not very strong. Lacing is tight, but thin. Perhaps my eyes are digging for any differences between this and Julius, but Alter Ego appears to be a shade more of a burnt orange. The aroma is much more subtle than Julius, which is to say it is almost subdued. Its riddled with notes of orange, and citrus with biscuit malts all muddled together. While nice, it doesn't scream hops, or juicy. A sip provides a very minimally dynamic flavor profile. It's citrus and orange hops and biscuit malts, with a twist of resin hop stick at the back of the throat right at the end. Alter Ego is a much more modest relative to Julius. The resin sticks in the back of the palette for a while, lingering long between sips. A hiccup gives a blast of orange and resin hops. Mouth feel certainly has some level of particulate abrasion to it. Otherwise, mouth feel is a bit strange. It's somewhere between medium and medium-thick, almost like it can't make up its mind between being a filling, one-and-done IPA, and an easy-sipping IPA made for drinking all day on the lake. Either way, it is easy to drink. It just isn't something to sip on out in the sun and heat. Overall, it's a great beer, although perhaps a bit overshadowed by its "twin" Julius. Its a great IPA with much more subtle qualities then its twin, which may be more approachable for some.

Smooth, fruity aroma.  Pineapple, mango, orange, and melon.   Very light biscuit-y malt.  
Big mix of citrus and tropical flavors.  Orange, pineapple, lemon, and mango.  Cantaloupe and honey dew.  Just light edges of sweet malt.  
Medium mouth feel with moderate carbonation.  Incredibly smooth with very low bitterness.  Lingering tropical notes in particular.
This is an amazing IPA.  Huge fruity hops with superbly blended flavors.  Juicy with only hints of bitterness.  My new favorite IPA. 628 charactersleroybrown10, Sep 24, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, dated 09/06/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic.
Pours thick and turbid, like apricot puree. An inch of creamy head fades quickly leaving a silky skim-coat of foam, a thick ring, and a solid coating of lacing.
Smells of peaches and bubble gum, bread roll and onions. Which, now that I read what I've written, sounds nasty. But it's not; I promise. Earthy, dank and fruity.
Taste upfront is pineapple, guava, nectarine and grapefruit pillowed in a soft, bready yeastiness. Dank weediness follows with some pie spice and pine. A quick, earthy finish.
Mouthfeel is soft and medium-bodied, juicy, and lightly carbonated.
As they say, the base beer is the same as Julius and sometimes I like Julius better and sometimes I like Alter Ego better - I don't know if it varies from canning to canning or if it's me. This time around the flavours don't seem to 'pop' as much as they have for me in the past but, you know what? it's still one of the greatest NEIPA's ever brewed. 990 characterspapposilenus, Sep 11, 2016

T - Very juicy on the front end, sweet, with just a little dank and bitterness on the finish.
M - Medium mouth feel and carbonation.

As cloudy as advertised, the aroma is juicy and a little dank and the flavor is out of this world.  
Mango, peaches, orange, creamsicle, and a little dank.  
My only knock on this is the flavor is so ramped up it's almost too intense.  Almost.  
This is, however, a fantastic IPA that I would drink any day of the week if I had access.. 448 charactersPerHops, Aug 27, 2016

Only really get notes of passion coming through individually. Taste follows the smell with a light sweetness on the front end balanced out by a tender bitterness on the back end. Feels rather luscious in your mouth with medium light carbonation. Overall an excellent ne IPA. Treehouse does it again! 381 charactersAmguerra305, Aug 26, 2016

4.18/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Canned on 6.14.16 and served in my TH tulip.  Pours a cloudy burnt orange with a dense, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head embedded with pinpricks and craters.  Great nose - citrus, pith, a trace of spice and an earthy/piney character.  Taste consistent with nose; however, more pith and less citrus forward with a suggestion of a light toasted malt bill.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with an even carbonation and an almost creamy texture with just a slight prickle.  Overall, really crushable and balanced; not my favorite from TH (they set the bar high), but this is extremely drinkable. 611 charactersJwale73, Aug 25, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -7%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Picked up some from the first run of the new, official can (Sexxxy as FFFFFFFFF). This beer looks amazing (orange haze) and the mouth feel is of course perfect, like most Tree House beers. The smell is definitely more dank than its counterpart, Julius, with some general tropical fruit in there too. The taste has some dank fruit with appropriate piney bitterness at the end. I've had this beer many times now and it still seems a bit muddy with flavor to me. While a very tasty beer, I like most of Tree House's other offerings more because their flavors appear more focused. This is a very, very nice IPA when compared to the rest of the world's beers, but if I'm to judge it against Tree House's selection, it is near the bottom. 732 charactersGabrielEVH, Aug 19, 2016

L: 3F head with very long retention, heavy lacing, cap, ring. Beer is a very hazy orange-bronze.
S: Very attractive blend of tropical and citrus like pineapple, orange, grapefruit, mango, peach, lime. Some piney dankness creeps in as well.
T: Citrus/tropical blend continues in the taste, with piney, dank, and grassy notes developing on the dry finish.
F: Light to medium body, light to medium carbonation, impeccable construction and good balance.
O: Probably should have tried Julius first as this is supposed to be a variant in the dry-hopping phase. In any case, I like it a lot. 731 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Aug 08, 2016

Looks again like a milkshake, like the other TH IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking.  I like the look.  Super cloudy, kind of cream colored.  Smell:  Just a vibrant blend of citrus fruit, piney, biting hops, a slight tropical mix, some melon, papaya.  Taste:  Fucking A, this one was amazing.  It took Julius and added layers of depth and complexity.  I was truly taken with this one.  Deep, complex hop flavors permeate your tongue, while the perfectly balanced malt counterbalances the hops and creates the perfect combination.  This one was straight up Heady-level perfection.  I wish I had a fridge full of this, I could drink this every single day.  Just stunning.  I could have never imagined so much flavor in a beer like this.  Feel:  spot on, medium-rich, effervescent, creamy.  Overall:  A stunner.  Go git you some. 911 charactersChcshammonde, Aug 07, 2016

Acquired at the brewery ten days ago.
Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip.
a: Cloudy orange with a finger thick white head which receded to even surface foam and dense patchy lacing.
s: Intense citrus and tropical fruits.
t: Follows the nose with a fairly heavy hop bite and some throat burn.  Dry finish.  Dankness soon develops along with some grassy notes.
m: Full, great body, "chewy" with lots of carbonation tingle.
o: Another excellent, rich IPA from TH.  They now have no less than fifteen brews in the BA top 250, which must be some kind of record, especially since thirteen of those are in the top sixty!  Alter Ego is supposed to be the alter ego to Julius, TH's original.  It's all that and a bag of hops. 776 charactersscotorum, Aug 01, 2016

Dark orange, opaque, with a large chunky head supported by tiny bubbles, receding to domed blanket leaving valleys of lace.
Violently aromatic hops bring in pungent, dank catty yet spicy notes quickly accompanied by orange marmalade. 
Taste is actually maltier than many other beers brewed in this style--for one of my first Tree House experiences, this is quite a surprise. Buttery biscuit and peppery flavors hit me first, with a perfumey melange coming in shortly after. Citrus pith and dank rotting fruit storm their way in, not unwelcome, with peppermint (!), green onion, and that strong malt presence of some robust grain, almost like rye.
Amarillo is showcased here in a way that is way different than I’ve had in most other beers, a very worthy highlight. A smooth, soft mouthfeel, and I can't believe I'm about to say this, is ultimately a disservice to the hops and malts working together here to create flavors I haven’t had in a beer. It's not that big of a hit, but for some reason that's how I felt about it. 1,054 charactersSabtos, Jul 10, 2016

A: Pours a completely opaque yet glowing dark/burnt orange. Ultra soft, pillowy head leaves medium+ lacing on the glass.
S: Assortment of tropical fruits accompanied by lots spicy citrus up front. Very sweet, almost candied citrus without much astringency. Tangerine, clementine. Tropical notes include ripe stone fruit and pineapple. Little bit of earthy herbaceousness underlies, but for the most part, it's a tropical fruit assault on the nose.
T: Grapefruit-dominated juiciness up front with supporting roles played by mango, orange, pineapple, and peach. Citric notes are kind of like biting into an orange, getting both the juice and the white flesh simultaneously. Fruitiness up front is followed by a light earthy/floral quality thanks to the Mosaic, which really differentiates it from the base beer (Julius). Signature Tree House bubblegum yeastiness underlies through the finish. Medium spicy citric bitterness lingers on the end.
M: Insanely silky smooth and creamy. No pucker effect from the intense citrus, and near-perfect, soft carbonation. Mouthfeel borders on full, which is crazy for a 6.8% beer. Definitely feels like a bigger beer than Julius, both due to the weight on the palate and the upped bitterness on the finish. It truly tastes like a tropical fruit smoothie.
O: Wow, just blown away by the balance and mouthfeel on this one. Fresh off a tasting of HF Double Citra, the smoothness and balance of Alter Ego's flavor profile is all the more impressive. It retains its juiciness while showcasing the dynamic nature of the hops included within. Up there with Focal Banger and DDH Congress as one of my favorite IPAs. 1,690 charactersavas, Jul 06, 2016

So far Julius and green have been overhyped letdowns and doppelgänger and alter ego have been the ones I've enjoyed. Alter ago sniffs like a generic IPA. When I taste it, I cant pick out any fruits or flavors.... but its SOOOOOOOOOOO smooth!!!!! Creamy smooth mouthfeel saves this ordinary IPA and transforms it into something really enjoyable. Cool brew- I'd get it again.

The bright yet color gives way to a wonderful citrus explosion on the nose.  My favorite and actually surprised impression is the taste.  There is an extra added element of sweet that adds another dimension to this beer.  Not a ton mind you, but it really keeps the bitterness at bay, bringing the taste really close to an orange/pineapple juice. 421 charactersgibgink, Jun 25, 2016

The beer had a murky orange appearance with a very thick, attractive orangepeel and hop aroma coming from the beer. In terms of taste, the beer had a great mixture of citrus and grapefruit flavors that allowed for a mostly sweet, but a slight sour taste to the beer. The mouthfeel adds a dimension of great carbonation and crispness to this beer. Overall, I found this beer to be quite good across all rating dimensions, especially in smell and taste. 536 charactersfitzy84, Jun 19, 2016

When I think of awesome NE IPAs, this is what I envision. An absolute beauty in the glass and the nose is amazing. I can't wait until they become more available so my 2 hour ride each way can gain me more than 5 cans! And believe me that that's not a knock in any way. I wish I could get a case to share with my fellow hop heads is all. 395 charactersJohnnieB71, Jun 17, 2016

S:  Lighter tropical fruits, oranges, etc.
T:  Not as creamy as the DIPAs but the taste is fantastic.  Orange, pineapple, whatever everyone else has said with a nice clean small amount of piney bitterness at the end.  Completely depends on the pallet but damn this is good.
F:  Great coating in the mouth but is lighter/more watery, even though it isn't, like Julius.
O:  Just a fantastic regular offering from TH.  
Out of all of the regulars of Haze, Green, Julius, and Alter Ego I prefer Ego then Haze/Julius followed by Green.

16 ounce can obtained in a trade. 
Look: Pours a very hazy, amber color that resembles ice tea. There is a nice lacing left on the glass and a half finger of head on the pour. 
Smell: Smells like dank dank dank juicy hops. Grapefruit, peach, pear, pine, orange, lemon. Super super dank and super juicy. 
Taste: Tastes like piney fruit juice. Papaya, orange, lemon, dankness, pine, peach, guava and a very faint crakery malt taste. 
Feel: Very smooth and light. It feels how an IPA should feel. 
Overall: This is exactly what I would expect from Treehouse and this is a great compliment to their already fantastic Julius. I will seek this out more often. 694 charactersTHSmusicman, May 21, 2016

Pours very hazy dirty orange with a massive dirty white 3 finger head. Aroma is loads of juicy citrus, grapefruit, lime, and tangerine. Flavor is bursting with juicy citrus notes of sweet tangerine, clementine, and tart grapefruit, lime. The hops don't leave much for the malt, but it is there in the background. Feel is very nice,  smooth and oily, excellent carbonation. This is the real deal for juicy IPAs. 492 charactersRi0, May 08, 2016

3.67/5  rDev -19.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75This beer in my opinion is way overrated. Take Julius, which is a very good yet one-dimensional IPA (in other words, it lacks complexity).  Dry hop it with 2-3 varieties of hops and you've made a murky tasting Julius, not a complex Julius. There is no defined hops flavor, just a bitter mediocre flavor that isn't that enjoyable to drink.  Still, all in all, an above average IPA, just nothing to get hyped up about. 416 charactersELS, May 04, 2016

Pours a hazy (typical) orange hued body with one finger white head, great retention, no lacing. Smells of oranges, tropical fruit, some grassiness, pale malt sweetness. Resin, pine hover in the background. Flavour is also hop-forward as the nose is, bursting with tropical fruit, oranges, minimal caramel in the background to keep things balanced; finishing off with resinous pine and grassiness on the finish. It's a bit dank, and wonderful. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, so easy to drink, with the pine seemingly coating the mouth in a nice bitter finish. Juicy stuff, for sure. 624 charactersStevedore, May 01, 2016

Really I don't think I can overstate how juicy this one is. Huge flavor. 299 charactersRothobinide, Apr 30, 2016
4.46/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5A - pours a hazy orange with glowing golden high lights and a bubbly off white head with good retention. 
S - the aroma is bursting through the glass. Juicy, sweet, tropical and herbal. Huge notes of orange pulp, pineapple, mango, guava, and melon with a generous sprinkle of pine. Some dank white onion as it warms but not displeasing. 
T - Dry with some very light notes of doughy malt up front followed by a juicy explosion of oranges. The juicy flavors follow mid-palate with notes of melon & pineapple with a solid pine flavor shooting right down the middle of the tongue. Finish is dry with a bright lingering piney bitterness. 
M - Medium bodied with a slightly watery edge but overall creamy texture and medium low carbonation. 
O - bright nose. Juicy flavors. This has got everything in spades. The extra dry hopping does add quite a bit over Julius. Great stuff. 876 charactersTeleweizen2, Apr 30, 2016

Nose is full of tart fruit.....melon, mango, pineapple, with a hint of citrus.  Taste has the same fruit notes.....moderate bitterness.....not as juicy as the nose.  Pick up an earthy taste on the back end.  Feel is full for the style with moderate to low carbonation.  Amazing.....but the earthy aftertaste puts it a slight notch below Julius. 439 characterslemmy187, Apr 30, 2016

Appearance - You know the drill by now; haze for days on this sucker. It has a more muddy look like pineapple juice and has the signature dense, rocky head. It looks nearly identical to straight Julius did.
Aroma - The nose is similar to Julius but definitely has a stronger Amarillo presence. It is distinct and adds a bit of flowery, spicy edge that plays nicely with the citrus undertones. It has an earthy grit to it as well which is quite enjoyable.
Taste - The flavors hold up much better on the palate in Alter Ego than in its little brother. It still suffers a little, but the hops drive the taste. It is significantly spicier than Julius and even takes on a West Coast feel with all of the Amarillo stuffed in here. Citrus, spice, and even a hint of blueberry are the main notes. Slightly bready.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. I'm not sure if it's because of the different dry hop schedule, but this doesn't feel as soft as Julius, Sap, or Haze. Still a nice texture though.
Closing Arguments - Overall, I enjoyed this beer but it is a tier lower than Haze. This concludes the 4 different TH beers I had from the last two releases, and I'd rank them as Haze, Alter Ego, Julius, and Sap. Haze was a fantastic beer and probably the only one I'd go out of my way to try again. 1,342 charactersnhindian, Apr 29, 2016

Sticky webs of lacing everywhere. Smell is amazing. Dank citrus, most notably grapefruit and orange intertwine wonderfully with mango and pineapple notes of Julius. Taste is the same. The dankness makes this a bit less of a juice bomb than Julius, but still amazing. Feel is pillowy soft and juicy with a little tickle of the tongue on the finish. Overall another world class beer by Tree House. I actually like this slightly more than Julius. Also of all the Treehouse beers I've had, this is the best one to drink straight from the can. 703 charactersCNoj012, Apr 25, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +6.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Second tree house offering for me, Green absolutely blew me away (my first). So I might make some references to green while drinking this. Let's see how this holds up.
Pour is an extremely murky dark orange hue. Very similar to green, but more darker orange in my opinion. Absolutely no light coming through this. Nice tight white bubbles head, awesome lacing.
Smells like a juice bomb, with a strong citrus scent. Tropical fruit like oranges, candied oranges and mango initially. Then I'm getting papaya, pineapples, marijuana, tangerines, bananas, grapes, melons.. Damn very fruity and citrusy.
Taste is a big punch of every fruit I listed with the smell. Definitely tangerine and pineapple. Nice hints of citrus like lemon zest and orange peel, very subtle sweet malt backbone. Slight hop bitterness, somewhat earthy and peppery. But the fruit definitely dominates.
Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Almost like a liquid fruit milkshake. Not much noticable carbonation. 
Amazing beer. In my opinion, more of a sweet malt profile than green. More earthy and peppery than green. But I honestly couldn't tell you which one is better, both are amazing and similar in many ways. 1,178 charactersMateo2699, Apr 11, 2016

4.55/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy dark orange in color with a a large, pillowy white head that exhibits good retention and leaves moderate amounts of sticky lacing.
Aroma is a burst of citrus upfront followed by lots of tropical fruit goodness. 
Taste follows the nose with a quick punch of tangerine followed quickly by mango and melon. Relatively balanced from a bitterness perspective; the juicy fruit flavors are the star with neither sweetness nor bitterness interfering. 
Mouthfeel is just where it should be, medium-ish body and solid carbonation yield a slightly chewer beer. 
Super drinkable, very smooth. I've only had a few of Tree House's core offerings but this is my favorite of the bunch; it has their typical hop juiciness that comes across to me as a mixture of mango and melon. I found both Haze and Green to have too much of the melon flavor which I didn't love but AE found that hallowed middle ground. 901 charactersmnj21655, Apr 10, 2016

Alter Ego is my favorite offering from Treehouse to date, but admittedly I have not tried any of their stouts or non-IPA offerings. Every aspect of this beer is outrageously good. Just go get some you knuckleheads! 292 charactersvegas_scumbag, Apr 07, 2016

This beer looks amazing, a dark yellow almost orange hazy beer with a nice head. The smell is very citrus fruity and juicy. The taste is more of the same, citrus fruity and juicy with some melon added in for good measure. Very hoppy and super smooth at the same time. Mouthfeel is great, very complex. Amazing beer overall. 450 charactersDirtyDawg10, Apr 07, 2016

Looks like a hazy huge bomb.  Nice 1 inch foamy head with little lacing.  
Smells like a juice bomb.  Citrus just playing with my nose.  I can't even pick out all the fruits - mango, oranges, pineapple.  Amazing nose. 
Tastes like a juicy fruit bomb with so many citrus smells.  It's ridiculous.  Absolutely love this style of IPA.  
Mouth feel is medium bodied with a great aftertaste.  I just lingers in your mouth.  
Overall I'm in love.  I think it's better than Julius.  Mosaic hops and dry hopped is the difference (I believe).  I'm so glad I made some great trades to get it.  Wish tree house made its way to Virginia.  They are doing God's work at that brewery. 801 charactersJay_P22, Apr 03, 2016

Hazy yellowish body with a small white cap. The aroma, like Julius, is otherworldly. Simply phenomenal. When I imagine an ideal IPA, it's these two. A cornucopia of fresh, juicy, resinous hops and tropical fruits. So quaffable as to be dangerous. Perfection. 331 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 31, 2016

What an incredible beer! I've been waiting to get my hands on this, and after a big dinner trade i was able to do so, as i live pretty far from TH.
This beer pour a b-e-a-utiful opaque copper orange that would make you swear you have mud in the can.
First impression is straight sex in a can, wet, delicious hoppy sex
The burps from this beer are better than 75% of the beers i have tasted.
I absolutely cannot wait to crack the Julius and haze i have waiting for this weekend.

I mean out of the standard line up I would go:

Actually I need to have full can of Alter Ego and Sap to really make that decision on the last three. Hopefully soon I can finalize that. 400 characterscultclassic89, Mar 28, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can shared by Curran this weekend, thanks man. Not all that different from regular Julius, but I think it's a bit better.
This one pours a hazy, turbid mess of a straw yellow/orangeish color, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like orange, pineapple, pine, marijuana, passionfruit, and melon. Smells honestly like a lot of Tree House IPAs tend to smell- but it does smell wonderful all the same.
This is just a touch more bitter than Julius, I'd guess from the addition of Amarillo, which tends to run a bit bitter for me. It's still super juicy, but with a nice bitterness underpinning everything- a big fruit basket of mango, pineapple, and melon, a bit of grapefruit rind on top of a pine needle bed. 
This is thick and chewy, classic NE feel here, with a normal level of carbonation for the style.
These Tree House IPAs are undeniably delicious, but it feels like a lot of them are pretty similar. That's really my only complaint, because I enjoy drinking them quite a bit. This one disappeared too quickly for me. 1,047 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 21, 2016

The haziness distinguishes this beer and the others like it at first glance, but it's just bs hipster facial hair. The juiciness is there in a big, beautiful way, but there's a graininess in my throat when I drink it that makes me hate the mid-fermentation hopping concept. If they would have let the yeast floc a little more before throwing the mosaic in, this would be a perfect IPA. 434 charactersbennyman12, Mar 18, 2016

My boss had brought me back a can and told me it was the best beer he's ever had. I obviously had my reservations, but after drinking it, I'm a believer. 
Pours unfiltered. Less orange than Julius, but smoother on the palate. Completely opaque. Creamy and silky finish. Citrusy without being overpowering. The perfect blend of citrus and hop. Not overly bitter but more than enough to satisfy any IPA lover. The only thing I don't like about the beer is it's not on tap in my kitchen. 100/100 620 characterswepeeler, Mar 10, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5appearance- Light yellow/orange color and hazy/turbid.  No visibility whatsoever.  Pours a thick/foamy two finger head.
aroma- Juicy orange, peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit. More or less smells like Julius.
taste- Similar to the nose with juicy orange and peach upfront. Towards the middle there's more pungent citrus grapefruit that helps balance the the juicy hops. Finishes off with a bready malt and sweet fruity hops.
feel- Medium carbonation, medium bodied, creamy upfront, and has very little bitterness overall. 
overall-  Definitely a great ipa, and while its not to different than Julius, the pungent citrus/grapefruit combo is definitely a nice addition to this beer.  Julius leans on the sweeter side, so its nice to have that balance in acidic/pungent hops that brings some bitterness and balance that I feel its needs.  Arguably better than the base, and a well made beer overall. 902 charactersCTbrew32, Mar 03, 2016

Orange yellow cloudy mess, in a good way. Not as ugly as Heady Topper. Two finger off white cloud, long lasting.  Sticky lacing.
Smells great if a little subdued. Fruity, piney, feint biscuits.
Phenomenal taste, fruity with a slight bitterness. Well balanced. Pineapple juice. May try a shot of rum in this bad boy.
Typical carbonation, nice coating in the mouth, sticky at the end.
Overall a great Northeastern IPA. Looking forward to tasting more from Tree House 496 charactersmusicsherlock, Mar 02, 2016

L: Dark, burnt orange… almost brown... completely opaque.  Not much to look at straight on, but glows a glorious orange with light shined behind it.  Gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing.
S: Deep, earthly hops and citrus… like any of the TH beers it could be an air freshener.  
T: Pineapple soaked hops, sweet orange rind; this one seems to blend the flavors better than Julius.
F: Very light, sweet and fruity without the prickly hops you get from Julius.
O: I love it and I’ll drink all I can get… Julius does slightly edge this out but just slightly.  I look forward to my Wed. afternoon can date at Tree House. 662 charactersjoezak5, Feb 28, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the 16 oz can dated 2/17/16 into a snifter glass. Comes out quite honey colored, lighter side of amber, very hazy with a decent head.
Smell is lovely, nice blend of hops here, quite sweet and fruity. Somewhat dank and resinous, too. Flavor starts with a pretty solid malt backbone, then middle is really great, stonefruit, peach, hints of tangerine. Finishes with a real leafy raw hoppiness, oily, resin. Body is pretty solid to back it up.
Overall another fantastic hoppy Tree House beer, but I definitely feel some of the others have been better. That's not to say this one isn't great, though. 610 charactersBranfordBound, Feb 23, 2016

T: Very nice flavor, light toast from the malt.  Slightly sweet and fruity, has a grapefruit flavor and a bit bitter, with a dry finish
F:  Typical of TH, very smooth, rich and full, and quite drinkable, however being a bit bitter there is an astringency which detracts from the smoothness.

Unlike many of its Tree House brethren, this baby pours a hazy liquid gold closer in look to apple juice than orange juice. I'm just coming out and saying it - the differences between Alter Ego, Juilius and Green are so slight and the beers far enough between sessions (for me at least) that it's tough for me to point out the differentiators. They're all fantastic beers so I really don't care which I have in hand, save for the ABV (lower the better since they all taste so big but feel so soft). World class, all of them. And they all seem to peak after a couple weeks in the fridge. 633 charactersManapuaMan, Feb 17, 2016

Lots of flavors in the hops - citrus, pine, tangerine, mint, a bit of chive/onion.  Moderate to assertive bitterness, but a good balance.  Full and rich mouthfeel, a bit chewy.

4.99/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Alter Ego pours a very opaque and orange.  The head is head is medium and white, with significant lasting time.  The appearance is very cloudy, and easily resembles a hazy and ghostly orange juice.  
S - Alter Ego blasts your nostrils with citrus and hops, and doesn't overpower.  Definitely hints of pineapple and tropical fruitiness here.  A treat to smell.
T - The hops and tropical fruitness immediately greets your tongue, with a smooth piney-taste midway through your taste.  The back-end of Alter Ego is mellow and not strong, but fades with a lingering trail of the forest.  Spectacular.
M - Alter Ego is very light in the mouth, with not much carbonation to note, if any at all.  Goes down smoothly and with ease and gives you a "full" feeling.
Alter Ego is a solid IPA.  I've tried many, from each coast and across the nation, with very few coming to the level of satisfaction that this entry from Treehouse provides.  A must if you manage to visit Monson, MA. 978 charactersStatonxyb, Jan 18, 2016

Cloudy, light amber in color, with a large white head. Good lacing as it goes down. Nice looking beer. Aroma seemed to leap from the cap upon opening, bursting with hops. Loaded with tropical and citrus (orange and grapefruit) fruits and quite a bit of pine as well. While I am not a master of picking out hop varieties in beers, I have homebrewed with Amarillo hops before and these were noticeable right away. Massive hop flavor, very fruity and juicy. Not much balance from the malt. A true hop showcase. Bitter mouthfeel without ever getting too dry. Overall, a pleasant IPA but probably just a notch below its base beer, Julius.
My last Tree House can... for now. Thank you, Ian! 719 charactersJacobob10, Jan 14, 2016

3.99/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4A- Pours a very hazy and very orange as it hits the glass. A huge head forms and retains a very long time with tremendous lacing. The pour is so orange and hazy that it could be mistaken for a glass of very pulpy orange juice.
S- Hello citrus and then pine hops bitterness! Right up front the hops smack you in the face with a very strong mango and grapefruit bitterness component. This morphs into almost a spicy scent in the middle of the smell, typical of strong amarillo-hopped beers. Lingering scent is of citrus, slowly melding into a pine scent.
T- The hops translate from the scent almost entirely, with maybe a very smell drop off. Strong, bitter hops greet the tongue first and start with a cedar to pine flavor before quickly moving toward the citrus fruit of the smell. The middle of the drink is mostly light, grapefruit bitterness with just a touch of the amarillo spice. The back end of the drink is when the hops start to fade a bit and there is a touch of grainy malt bill detectable. The lingering flavor in the mouth is a combo of mostly moderate, citrusy hops bitterness and light grainy malts.
M- On the palate, this beer is a little confusing as far as feel goes. There is a relatively low level of carbonation, low enough that I would say it is lacking for the style, but not low enough to detract from the beer too much. Other than the carbonation level of the beer, everything else is in line, with a nice, easy drinkability and smooth roll across the tongue.
Overall, this beer is a solid IPA. Nothing incredibly special, but the mosaic and amarillo dry hopping really turns this beer in a citrus and pine direction. 1,646 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 07, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a slightly hazy orange amber color with fairly good head retention and decent lacing.  The nose is fairly typical for TH IPA's and DIPA's, which is wonderful if you love this style of IPA/DIPA (and I do).  There is considerable grapefruit and orange citrus, with some underlying dank earth, tropical fruit and light pine.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with some nice light bitterness on the finish, but with some noticeable heat from alcohol as well.  Given the relatively low abv., I was surprised by the noticeable heat I got on the finish.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with a fairly full, citrus infused finish.   As is typical with TH IPA's and DIPA, the beer was soft and almost creamy on the palate (which is not something I  typically expect to find in an IPA, and is not something I'm sure I'm entirely in love with).
This is a very nice IPA, that's for sure.  However, I'm scratching my head a bit over some of the lofty score reviews and the 100 BA rating.  IMHO, this beer clearly doesn't merit that kind of score, but whatever.  This is a very nice IPA, and one I wish was more readily available where I lived (received a can from a friend). 1,196 charactersJohn_M, Jan 01, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Look - hazy orange, with a foamy white head. This one seems to foam a bit more than the other TH's beers I've had.
Smell - I smell pineapple first, followed by grapefruit then orange. 
Taste - similar to the nose, but the grapefruit comes across the strongest instead of the pineapple. Also, this is a little less bold than Julius,  but I really like it - it's a unique flavor.
Feel - medium bodied, medium carbonation, really works very well for this beer.
Overall, this is another great example of what Tree House can do. I'm sure as many of you have read, Tree House beers can be described as juicy, and this is no exception. Delicious! 643 charactersBillErickson, Dec 30, 2015

4.53/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5After having several people tell me that Alter Ego was superior to Julius, I made a point to seek it out and was helped by fellow BA carps4. Enjoyed on 12/17/15 out of a tallboy with a canning date of 12/11/15--can't really beat an IPA that hasn't even reached it's one-week birthday. Poured into an IPA-specific Speigelau glass.
Appearance (4.5) - I'm a little surprised that this one doesn't have the orange juice appearance that other Tree House beers do, especially given that it's basically Julius with a different dry hop recipe. I would say that it's due to how young it is, but I've had Julius this young and don't remember there being any translucency like this. Speaking of the translucency, back to the beer--as noted, it lacks the completely opaque element, but is still quite hazy, with the bottom of the glass allowing a little more light through than the top. The hue is a saturated tangerine orange at the top, and a lighter peachy color with a lemon-yellow highlight at the bottom. Atop the body sits a thick four-finger head with a smattering of medium-sized bubbles amidst the predominance of tighter bubbles. As I give it some time, the foam dissipates to a permanent half finger of suds on the surface of the liquid and some sticky lace adorning the sides of the glass.
Smell (4.5) - There is a Julius-like tropical fruitiness trying to make its presence known here, but the use of Amarillo in the altered dry hop is doing a hell of a job adding a deliciously pithy grapefruit to the fray. In fact, I might argue that there is just a bit too much grapefruit, but it's a hard argument to make for someone who loves that flavor profile so much. As noted, there are still the underlying elements of nectarine, orange and mango.
Taste (4.5) - Much like the aroma, the grapefruit pith is a distinguishing characteristic in the taste of this beer. Grapefruit zest and lightly fruity bitterness are both present in spades, pushing around the juicier notes of mango and orange. Underneath the hop bitterness there is a polite cracker element from the malt base, but it is definitely in the background. Interesting to me how it seems to come out more in this than in the Julius base beer--fascinating evidence of how a hop profile can impact the underlying grains.
Mouthfeel (4.75) - Medium bodied and with moderate carbonation that is just enough to give this one a pleasant, hearty feel while still remaining refreshing and juicy.
Overall (4.5), another fantastic entry from Tree House into the wide world of lupulin. Having been able to enjoy this one, Green and Julius all within a few days of each other, I still am of the opinion that Julius is tops, but I recognize that others may feel differently based on their own personal preferences. All three are very good and are different in subtle but noticeable ways. This one, to me, is for all you grapefruit lovers out there--tons of grapefruit juiciness and pith and without the use of any actual fruit.
Overall, (4.5) a delicious beer. I will say this, if you are looking for a juicy tropical fruit bomb along the lines of Julius, I'm not sure that Alter Ego is what you're looking for. However, I do think that this adds a nice bit of variety to Tree House's stellar hoppy beer portfolio. 3,267 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 28, 2015

A: Cloudy orange body, one-inch head of creamy eggshell foam. Good retention and lacing. Classic unfiltered appearance.
S: Wow. Just wow. Even better than Julius, with a greater tropical depth and juicy brightness. Truly phenomenal hop overload.
T: Follows the nose: juicy, fruity, complex, and incredible. Mango, orange, grapefruit, and lychee all combine in a kaleidoscope of hop goodness. Intensely hoppy without being astringent on the finish. Beautiful, beautiful beer.
M: Medium body, soft carbonation, moderate stickiness from the hops. Great.
O: As great as Julius undoubtedly is, this was the clear winner of the side-by-side. Another winner from Treehouse.

4.41/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured at 47°F from a can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
LOOK: Pours with 4 fingers worth of dense, off-white foam. At 45 seconds, the foam becomes rocky and spacious. At 1 minute the outer edges of the foam head have decreased in size by a finger leaving a plateau for a foam head and a moderate very thick lacing behind. At 4 and a half minutes, the outer edges of the foam head have dissipated to a half fingers worth and the center into a fingers worth. Honey orange in color with an extreme amount of cloudiness. Once the foam head finally settled, rising bubbles are subtle in quantity and small in size. Lacing is moderate in quantity and very thick.
SMELL: Strong aromas of grapefruit, oranges, and tangerines entangle with mild aromas of peaches, mangos, papayas, apricots, sweet bread, and hints of bitter and floral hops.
TASTE: Very strong orange, grapefruit, and tangerine flavors enter initially and are immediately followed by strong flavors of peaches, mangos, papayas, and apricots. Orange flavors grow stronger as mild sweet bread and floral hop flavors prance onto the palate. Mild bitter hop flavors enter lastly as all previous flavors persist, except for tangerine and grapefruit, which fade to mild.
FEEL: Somewhere between full-bodied and medium-bodied. Carbonation is moderate. Goes down smooth and creamy. Ends with a high amount of dryness.
NOTE: As beer warms, bitter hop flavors grow stronger. So drink cold unless you love the bitterness! Another fantastic IPA from Treehouse, but I personally preferred Julius more than this one. 1,558 charactersMyotus, Dec 20, 2015

4.56/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Extremely cloudy, peachy-orange brew, topped by a flat white head of good size, with fantastic retention. The brew is completely opaque, with only shadows visible behind the glass.
Very juicy aroma: star fruit, mandarin orange, peaches, dank sweetness, and a bit of grainy caramel. Waves of juicy, hoppy goodness.
The initial flavor hitting the palate carries a surprising amount of malt body at first, with a decent amount of caramel and brown sugar. The hops then come on quite nicely, almost restrained when compared to the aroma. Remarkably juicy when it hits, laced just at the edges with herbal notes. Pinning down the flavors is a little difficult: very light and juicy orange, pineapple, and mango, alongside a vegetal/fruity unidentifiable taste.
Very easy drinking brew, but nicely full in body, especially for the ABV. Lively, soft, and smooth. 858 charactersRoguer, Dec 10, 2015

Look: Decent head that dissipates fast. Color is hazy orange. Got that unfiltered look of the new East Coast IPAs.
Smell: Tropical bomb. I get some weed too.
Taste: A lot like the smell. It's like eating a pineapple and then some grapefruit. Finishes sweet but not too much. 
Feel: Perfect carbonation, full bodied, and small bite of bitterness at the end.
Overall: I'm really liking the IPAs coming out of the East Coast. This is one of the top IPAs on my list. Thanks @sims55bfb. 497 charactersKMachHops, Dec 09, 2015

I love Julius. Although I'm Team Green, Julius is definitely a 100, World-Class beer. And with Alter Ego, I had very high expectations. Tree House NEVER disappoints.
Pours a hazy, unfiltered, dark orange color. Beautiful. Nose is very orange juice, sweet tropical fruits and dank hops. Taste really follows with the nose. I can definitely taste the similarity to Julius, except it's kind of Julius' evil brother. Much more of a dank note, and hoppier tasting than Julius. Very nice stuff. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Not quite as creamy as Green, but so great for an IPA.

It smells cheesy with hops then opens up to be more fruity with rinds and pulp like orange zest. It tastes as zesty as it smells with fruity pulp and pith to rind-like bitterness of oranges. 
This is light in body with modest carbonation. A crushable IPA but I dont see why people get their nipples all up in a twist over this, yeah its good but its not perfection either. 534 charactersstakem, Dec 03, 2015

A: The beer is a bright orange/amber color, with a large foamy off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is an excellent blend of floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with a strong citrus flavor up front. Then a strong floral hops bitterness comes in. The malt character is hearty and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA to drink for a long time. The differences between this beer and Julius seem to be very subtle despite the dry hop being completely different. 932 charactersTheManiacalOne, Nov 30, 2015

Smell is a bit subdued, melon and stone fruit dominate.
Taste is  stone fruit, a bit of watermelon and a bit of dank resin
Feel is silky, a bit sweet and not very bitter. Huge flavors but very easy drinking.
Very very good beer, much like Julius,  I'd advise against drinking it less than a week old, I've experienced some big bubblegum flavors if too fresh, they dominate to the point where you can't taste anything else. 597 characterstrevorpost, Nov 30, 2015

4.03/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Light copperish gold. Hazy with a super creamy moderate off-white head. Leaves sheets of lacing with big sticky notches. Moderate carbonation on the pour. Solid retention leaves a small clumpy cap that covers the top for the duration.
Smell: Super juicy orange hits immediately. Throws some serious peach with a touch of pine resin and dirty flower petals. Pushes of grapefruit pith and zest. Deeply floral. Malts are slightly sweet with a touch of caramel malt with a bready pale malt push. Slightly dirty with green tree branch. Ever so slightly dank. Mango and pineapple ghost through the back as well. A little less juice aggression than is typical for Tree House beer.
Taste: Grapefruit juice with some peach, pineapple, and mango juice to spice it up. Big juicy ruby red grapefruit. A slight hop spice with a huge floral push. Dried flower petals, some dank herbal notes, and dirty green tree branch. Mosaic pushes hard through the back of each sip. Solidly tropical. Moderate bitterness. Malts offer a touch of balancing sweetness but can't quite balance the raw green sap of Mosaic. Warming ups the pineapple significantly. Lingering resin with an oily pine. Hints of mint, melon rind, and weed.
Mouthfeel: Ever so slightly creamy on the initial sip. Finishes surprisingly dry. Moderate carbonation. Slightly slick throughout.
Overall: Jekyll wins this round.
The alter ego loses a little punch. It might be the abundance of Mosaic (full disclosure, I don't care for Mosaic), but it loses the juicy character of Tree House. Oddly dry with some imbalance. Not their best showing, but it's still good by any metric. 1,638 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Nov 29, 2015

A hazy copper with a dense off white head with good retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose is, eh, hoppy. Honey, mango and gobs of tropical fruit are present. Very fruity, frothy. Doughy, grainy malt is present. Dominated by fruity and aromatic hops, bitterness is mild. Cooked peach. Messy. The palate opens hoppy with plenty of hop flavor, fruity and intense. Tropical fruit milkshake like with mango, a gritty sapota like sweetness, passionfruit and a definite cooked dough, mildly cereal like. They hop flavor had a mild yogurt like tartness as well, instead of a cleaner bitterness. Medium in body, mildly chewy, creamy carbonation. Solid though a little too messy for my liking. 733 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 28, 2015

A: Hazy, but not super cloudy - medium golden orange with honey around the edges - pours with a medium-small, bright white head, fades to wisps, leaves some nice streaks of lacing
S: Tropical fruit juice with a splash of IPA - stupidly, stupidly juicy - tons of citrus -  orange and tangerine juice - ruby red grapefruit zest and juice - floral citrus - tropical aromas, with juicy mango and pineapple - lightly dank, with some resinous and herbal qualities, but the emphasis here really is on citrus juice - some pale malts at the base
T: Waves and waves of juice - citrus juice - orange and an even bigger tangerine juice flavor - orange, tangerine, and ruby red grapefruit flesh - citrus zest and oil - some spicy citrus - dank, herbal and resinous - hints of pine, grass, and mint - tropical flavors, mango, melon, and pineapple - touches of bubblegum - light sweetness at the base with some pale malts and light crackers - mostly dry despite the juice explosion
M: Medium body, very smooth, low but adequate carbonation, herbal finish
O: The juice is loose
Of the three beers I had the pleasure of acquiring when I most recently visited Tree House (the other two being Green and Haze), I think this is my favorite. The sheer amount of juice is absurd. The general consensus is that Julius is even better, which is kind of scary. I will be hinting for that one.
Update, 5/9/16: I've now had Julius. And I'm drinking a can of this. Honestly, I like this more. Why? Mosaic's tropical pine tree signature character works bizarrely well here. While it may only be in the dry hop, it somehow cuts the fruity sweetness to create a beer that is truly magical. 1,681 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 28, 2015

Bottled on:	Illegible
A:	
Pours a cloudy, almost pulpy-looking tannish white peach color with a big fluffy beige head that drops to a film with some islands that is easily roused. Decent retention; lots of thin webs of lacing.  (4.25)	
S:	
Candied peaches.  Funky, dark green smells with some juicy fruits coming through, nectarines, apricots, pine boughs (barely there) some slight herbal body to the bitterness (it's not bitter, though).  (4.5)	
T:	
Lightly sweet, lightly bitter.  A varied set of IPA tastes, but it is predominately sweet and juicy with a similar flavor profile to the nose.  There is some cracker in the body and an alternating sweet and dryly bitter flavors.  (4.75)	
M:	
Fluffy and juice-like, light-medium body, light carbonation, dry finish.  (4.75)	
O:	
This is another tasty IPA from Tree House.  
It pours lovely and has the same pulpy, tropical juice look that I saw in Julius.  The aroma is a little punchier here than in its brother.  There is definitely more of a 'green'/'bitter' aroma here.  The flavor is quite fruity with lots of peach, guava, weed, and cracker malts.  It drinks like a champ and (like Julius) I could pound it like nobody's business.  
Would absolutely have again.  Worth seeking out. (4.5) 1,265 charactersTheDoctor, Nov 23, 2015

L: Bright, hazy yellow. Half finger of head. Great glass lacing.

T: Follows the nose. Lots of over ripe fruit (mostly papaya and mango). Very tropical and sweet with no bitterness. Similar to Julius but with papaya instead of orange.
F: Creamy, siky. Great feel and very easy to drink.
Overall this is similar to Julius, as expected, but with one fruit subbed for another. Great addition to the Tree House lot. 543 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Nov 22, 2015

Poured into a pint glass, cloudy/hazy orange.  Small, white head although I poured slowly.  Slight retention.
Looks like an IPA was crossed with a Wheat beer.
Smells amazing.  Besides the obvious citrus aroma, I smell papaya/mango or other exotic fruits I cant recognize.
The taste is interesting to me.  The HOPs are right up front but there is a balance to it.  Its not so potent you feel like you have your mouth attached to a lawnmower bag, as Ive experienced with so many other highly rated IPAs.
This stuff is delicious.  I think this is now my favorite IPA.  So often breweries forget some people want more than just the overpowering hop taste and this delivers.  Citrus, both orange and lemon.
Very light on the palate and goes down easy.  Highly drinkable.  Would be a great session beer with its flavor and manageable ABV. 881 characterskalosjakar, Nov 21, 2015

Pours a foamy 1.5 finger frothy white head with good retention. Beer is a cloudy orange. Lacing is thick and layered with excellent stick. Very good. Could use more clarity.
Nose is citrus, starfruit, papaya and mango. Nice malt backbone contributes even more juiciness. Nicely aromatic and very appetizing.  
Opens citrus, papaya and mango. A huge tropical fruit bouquet throughout. Juicy malt backbone displays starfruit, orange and more papaya and mango. Dry in the end. Some grass and a touch of bark to offset the sweetness. Juicy and fruity hop aftertaste. Outstanding.  
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and goes down soft, fluffy and with just enough bubbles. Dry finish with a lingering, filmy, dry aftertaste. Perfect.
I didn't think Julius could get better but Alter Ego takes things to an even higher level. I didn't know single IPAs could taste like this until I entered the realm of Tree House. These are must-have beers for sure. 1,047 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 16, 2015

Golden color, haze as to be expected from TH beers.  Small head, as I intentially poured soft from the can in order to fit into a pint glass.
Smell:
Tangerine and orange galore!  Great smelling brew.
Taste:
A more assertive Julius, with the tropical flavors up front and a bigger bitter finish.  The mosaic hops really shine through, a nice change up.
Feel:  
Nice for the style, bitterness hangs around a bit, not over-carbed so it begs for more sips.
Overall:
Alter ego indeed!  Another fantastic brew from TH. 522 charactersNewport_beerguy, Nov 15, 2015

S: A fantastic dank aroma with some mango, passion fruit, grapefruit and spearmint. I'm even getting a little coconut/tropical fruit smoothie/Hawaiian Tropic in here as well. 
T: A great blend of just crushed citrus hop goodness, light pine resin and smooth malt. Finish leaves just a trace of piney bitterness, but it's far from overwhelming. A little bit of grapefruit pith in there on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is medium and insanely smooth. I would drink the hell out of this if it was easier to get out here. Very glad I got to try this one. 705 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 11, 2015

4.18/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 750mL can into  a treehouse tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery 5 days ago. 
Pours a hazy orange body with a 2 finger white head that reduces to leave heavy lacing and a ring of retention. 
Aromas of citrus, lots of floral character, citrus rind, grapefruit, slightly grassy and herbal, grainy, somewhat resinous and creamy.
On the tongue is an initial orange-ish, tropical fruit citrusy flavor, grapefruit and citrus rind, floral flowery, grassy, leafy flavors, light mango, followed by a subtle bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-low carbonation with a medium body. 
Great IPA, but not my favorite from Treehouse. Still amazing though. 654 charactersgcamparone, Nov 05, 2015

Appearance: looks exactly like Julius, perhaps a smidgeon darker in color. Head is still puffy, off-white, and lingering, along with the signature New England haziness. 
Aroma: A little more muted than Julius, with a tad more cracker evident. Still, tons of citrus and hop aroma here. 
Taste: all fruit, with a little herbaceous bite on the finish. I got pomegranate (!), TONS of grapefruit and bitter rind, along with some young peach. Excellent throughout.
Feel: soft to medium bodied. Smooth and thick, just like its counterpart, Julius. Lingering sticky finish with tons of fruit that remains on the palate.
Overall: I didn't like it AS much as Julius, but I'm not sure I've liked any IPA as much as Julius, so whatever. Its a goddamn fantastic beer, and is worth the time to seek out. 835 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 04, 2015

A: hazy orange with a clean white head of just over a 1/2". Lace was thin and sticky
S: very si liar to Julius but not quite as explosive fruitiness. But the citrus, mango and a bit of pineapple are clear.
T: to my palate there is a much more complex hop character to Alter Ego. The fruit is there but a much better pine and grapefruit flavor is present and seems more developed than Julius.
M: good, was still like a bit more body.
O: this is a bit more complex than Julius and so a really nice alteration of the original as it is an improvement. 617 charactersDocrock, Oct 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours that same opaque orange juice like look as Julius.  Aroma has the same oranges and ripe mango/peaches as Julius but with even more awesome earthy dankness.  I also get a hint of onion and herbs which isn't a bad thing at all here.  Flavor spot on and similar to Julius again (obviously) but with more citrus and grapefruit pith.
Finish is crisp and sharp, as others have said.

Alter Ego is Julius with different hops. It's smells and tastes very different. Julius is incredibly fruity but it's more aggressive than this beer. Alter Ego is softer and sweeter but still very tropical tasting. The Mosaic hops surprisingly aren't very oniony, or herby. Super fruity. Each sip begs for more. Surprising by the alcohol content. It could easily sneak up on you. A great example of a hop bomb that tastes rather soft and doesn't blast away with bitterness. 560 charactersVelvetExtract, Oct 12, 2015

A: So hazy it's opaque. Orange in color. Creamy off white head settles to an inch in height. Sticky and wispy lacing.
S: Juiced oranges,mpineapple, fresh mango slices, kiwi, honeydew melon, perhaps passion fruit. Mildly leafy with whiffs of sweet bud. Doughy malts. Super pungent and tropical. 
T: Juicy tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, pineapple, honeydew melon, kiwi, sliced mango and cantalpoue. Sweet cannabis and soft earthy pine. Bitterness has a firm but gentle grip. Doughy malt underneath. Heady tropical finish. 
M: Medium bodied. Silky and full. Gentle hop astringency. Fine bubbled carbonation scrubs a bit.
O: Goddamn. They found a way to take Julius and make it even better. This is bar none one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Ridiculously vibrant and bursting with tropical hop aroma and flavor. One of the world's best in my book. 881 charactersryan1788a5, Oct 05, 2015

09 23 15
Served in a pint glass
The completely opaque, yellow ochre body was topped by a tight, foamy, inch tall crown. Typical appearance for a New England-style IPA. Excellent head retention. Drippy rings of lacing stuck along the glass.
The nose was solid but not as fragrant as I anticipated. Citrus notes dominated. Loads of orange and orange peel. Juicy. Hint of pine. There was a subtle, dry yeasty quality. Tropical notes were also detectible. Mango came forth as the beer warmed. Peach notes appeared as well. 
The flavor profile was also super juicy and citrusy. Again, orange notes dominated. Touch of peach. Orange peel appeared on the back end. The beer finished dry and moderately bitter with strong notes of grapefruit grind. Commendable, just not mind-blowing like so many other Tree House beers.
On the palate, the liquid was medium bodied and contained a fairly standard, moderate effervescent. Nowhere near as soft and frothy as a number of their other beers. With time, the carbonation settled and the liquid turned softer and and smoother. Somewhat creamy.
If this beer was made by almost any craft brewery, I would probably be quite impressed. However, coming from one that routinely produces some of the best hoppy beers in the world, it was somewhat disappointing. Both the aroma and the flavor profile seemed a bit one-note, and the mouthfeel lacked the suppleness typically found in their other offerings. This is worth a try for sure but definitely a far cry from their best work. 1,588 charactersDamian, Oct 03, 2015

Deep dank hops with citrus peel, pine, fruit and some earthiness in the finish. The pine lingers well past the swallow. Mouthfeel is full, semi-soft.

4.71/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a nice one-finger frothy white head that lasts nicely throughout. Delicious aromatics of mango, tangerine, floral, and sweet malts. The Mosaic and Amarillo hops really come through on the palate. I definitely could pick up that that Julius dry hop, which I understand the base beer is exactly the same, but the dry hop is altered tremendously with an added citrusy complexity. Impeccable beer! 428 charactersCuriousMonk, Sep 28, 2015

Full finger of fluffy white head that lingered leaving nice lacing. 4.5.  Smells of oranges, mangos, grapefruit or passion fruit and hops.  4.25.  Tastes citrus forward.  Lots of mosaic and Amarillo hops but it is also blended with the Julius hops.  Great because it toned down the back end bitterness of Julius.  Really smooth and drinkable.  Not sweet but not bitter.  Smooth.  4.5.  Mouth feel is thick and full for an American IPA.  Really nice.  4.5.  Excellent beer. 576 charactersuvachief, Sep 26, 2015

A - Pint can poured to a Tree House glass. Darkish orange and quite hazy. White head of about a finger is reduced to a thin ring+very slight cap. Some lace bits left behind.
S - Pretty absurd tropical hop blast. Tangerine, mango, grapefruit, papaya, earthy resin dank, and just a bit of sugar cookie malt for good measure. Damn nice and damn potent.
T - Just a bit of a step down here but still, magnifico. Just a killer mix of tropical and dank with just the right amount of biscuit malt back there. And actually pretty bitter, not just fruit juice pulp! 
M - Somewhat biggish feel for the style & ABV, no real alcohol noticeable but this could easily pass for a DIPA. Superb smoothness, great carbonation and bitterness level. 
O - Yeah, it's stupidly good. It packs quite a punch for a single IPA, loads of flavor without getting too fruity+sweet or too bitter. Really, where can IPAs go from here? 1,039 charactersChico1985, Sep 11, 2015

Murky orange-yellow pour, good white head, spotty lacing. Hoppy nose, citrus and pine. As expected. The taste was no surprise, fruity and citrusy hops, notes of pine resin and bubblegum, biscuity malts, bitter aftertaste, some vegetal and mineral elements. Medium body, a little chewier in the mouthfeel than I prefer my IPAs. I definitely preferred Julius to this, despite the beers being very similar. There was just something about this one that was a little off that I can't put my finger on. Still good overall, just nothing tremendous. 580 charactersRifugium, Sep 06, 2015
4.81/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a murky deep orange color with a two finger off-white head. Typical New England IPA appearance.
Aroma is much danker and has more grapefruit than it's counterpart Julius, which I really like. The Mosaic dry-hop accounts for that. Along with the herbaceous dank quality and grapefruit, there is peach, mango, papaya, and tangerine, all of which are very juicy. Some floral too. Extremely light bready malt and sweetness from the pale malts.
Just as the aroma indicated, the taste is much more dank. The herbaceous dank quality is there throughout. Lots of grapefruit come through, as well as light peach, juicy mango, papaya, passionfruit, and tangerine. Get some light breadiness and sugary sweetness from the malt. A grapefruit peel and light pine resin bitterness emerge on the finish to go along with the aforementioned juicy flavors.
Medium body. Very soft, smooth, and creamy. Very clean drinking beer.
I'm not sure if I like this or it's counterpart Julius more. I think this one wins by a hair because I love Mosaic hops and this one really shows off the dank, grapefruity quality that it can provide. So much vibrant, complex hop character, yet it is balanced perfectly. 1,188 charactersbrewskis, Sep 06, 2015

Fantastic blend of pine, citrus and malt. Nice resinous nose with plenty of citrus hops. Flavor is much of the same. Sweetness is 'fruit-like' instead of 'malt-like'.

4.23/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25My first thought on this beer is boring, followed by perfectly done.  It's reminiscent of the simpler IPAs of a few years ago, less so the more complex/exciting IPAs being put out now by Tree House and others.  Color is a hzay orange, but not cloudy.  Smell is smooth with a hop presence, but not overwhelming.  Taste is refreshing and slightly hoppy, but very simple.  Finish has a standard (but not overpowering) hop finish.  I prefer the sweeter/funner IPAs more, but this was very well done. 495 charactersmrn1ceguy, Sep 02, 2015

Julius' Alter Ego is the man/woman!! the aroma of this isn't over powering, but it not going to kick you in the vag/nuts like some super hop aroma beers, but it's still something I would love in candle scent for my flat. This isn't a tea bag you in the mouth IPA, this isn't super malty like some regular IPAs can be, but it's just a very well balanced IPA. I'm not a big IPA fan but this hit the spot for me. Being in Tampa, I'm used to the maltier IPAs, so this was a refreshing change. I love the look of this. Nice and hazy. It felt great as Julius danced on my tongue and slid down my throat with little burn. 622 charactersSonnysideup, Aug 29, 2015

Pours a murky brownish orange with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Citrus, oranges, resin, fruity malts. Taste is much better and hoppier than the nose. Medium body and moderate carbonation.
Overall a very good IPA, with a great taste. Would love to have it again. 357 charactersmdfb79, Aug 28, 2015

Take Julius, strip it of its characteristic Orange Creamsicle flavor, squirt some Eau de Lawson's IPA in there for the nose, add a dash more fistfuls of bitter hops, and mix it all together. 
The finished product is good, but it could be better, kind of like getting a cheeseburger that has no bacon on it. 321 charactersrodmanfor3, Aug 28, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4An awesome opportunity to get some of these beers.  Let's see how this one compares to Julius.  16 oz. can into a tulip.
A - I mean it looks like orange juice - the fresh squeezed kind that actually looks orange.  A bright, pillowy white head hangs around for quite a while.
N - Here's where TH kills it.  Now I'm not the biggest fan of Mosaic and Amarillo hops, but the bright, juicy aroma is outstanding.  I get peaches, apricots, a bunch of pine.  Very intense.
T - Where TH excels is at blending flavors together.  Even though this is loaded with hops, the hop flavors blend extremely well together reducing the bitterness.  It's a bit too piney for my tastes, but it's well-crafted.
M - Extremely smooth and frothy.  It's like drinking a capuccino and getting a foam mustache.  Not quite sure how they pull this off.
O - Not as good as Julius, but an amazingly well-crafted brew. 889 charactersCraftFan5, Aug 26, 2015

Smells like a blend of orange zest, tangerine and mango.  
Taste is full of mango with plenty of citrus.  Mild bitterness on the back to finish.  
Feel is the typical full and soft body you expect from tree house. 
Overall this is on par with Julius, the mosaic lends a lot of mango and tropical fruit to the citrus heavy Julius. 411 charactersCTFalcon, Aug 24, 2015

Smell - Incredible! Earthy Floral notes, like getting slapped in the face by sticky hops. A lot of orange and grapefruit citrus. The kind of beer you just want to keep smelling - so unique.
Taste - Citrus, especially grapefruit with a touch of pineapple that ends with a pleasant sweet/bitter hop finish.
Feel - Medium carbonation, not overly bitter a beer that can be crushed or sipped.
Overall - Outstanding! Selecting a favorite Tree House beer is like picking your favorite kid or pet. The aroma and slight bitter finish make this one hard to beat. 697 charactersMatthewHopHead, Aug 23, 2015

The look and the head are pretty much Julius, i.e opaque orange, nice thick white head, lacing on the glass, etc...  The smell is packed with fruit and citrus.  You get all of the juiciness of Julius to start, but then the flavor gives way to waves of bitter hops which in turn give way to more citrus, grapefruit aftertaste - very nice.  Nice silky mouthfeel. 411 charactersChinaskiWMA, Aug 22, 2015

     Pours identical to Julius.  Semi-cloudy orange with HUGE, fluffy white head.  Retention is moderate as it fades out in under a minute. Lots of sticky lacing hanging around
     The smell of this beer is out of this world!  Foremost, big citrusy orange rind blasts with underlying resiny dank.  Upon second whiff, I get some Super Bubble gum flavor.  Just a big sweet mix of dank and citrus.
    Taste follows the aroma profile. Sweet melon, followed by orange rind is followed by a fairly sharp hop bitterness bite.
    Feel is medium, almost chewy.  Not quite as pillowy as Julius, but still dances on the tongue and palate.  Finishes semi-dry
    Overall, I think I like this a bit more than the base beer, Julius.  Hard to believe because that beer is aweseome. 824 charactersJamesStreet, Aug 21, 2015
4.79/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is the real deal right here. Very similar to Julius, but it lacks a tad in mouthfeel.
A: A hazy, vibrant golden orange with a thin, white lacing.
S: The first thing that comes to mind upon cracking a can and pouring it into my snifter is dankness. Oh boy it's dank. Combined with an orange rind like citrus aroma and a hint of sugary like sweetness.
T: Very similar to the nose, the orange like citrus seems to explode in my mouth and there's more citrus notes present as well.
M: Medium carbonation, medium body, hops are prickly to the tongue, has a dryness to the finish and a little kick of bitterness. This is where it slightly differs from Julius.
O: Absolute treat....this is right up there for my personal favorite IPA's!! Bravo!! 743 charactersMA_hops, Aug 21, 2015

Appearance - Murky orange poor. Dank appearance
Smell - tropical citrus smells. I smell a lot of tangerine.
Taste - citrusy with tangerine. Light bitterness.
Overall - I have been fortunate to have Julius as regularly as possible for the last two years, and I think Alter Ego is comperable in terms of quality and taste. I sincerely hope this beer continues to appear on a regular basis! 435 characters311bulldog, Aug 20, 2015

Taste is intensely citrus with an incredibly smooth bitter finish.  Certainly citrus-filled, blast of mosaic, peppery.  Mouth feel has a slight tingle and refreshingly clear-finish that leaves a little bit of bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Overall, fantastic.  This is almost like a bite from a bouquet of tropical fruits and it leaves you feeling rejuvenated and still possesses that classic IPA dry hoppy bite.  Highly recommended. 541 charactersanteatr23, Aug 04, 2015

Alter Ego is a little sweeter and fruitier/citrusy than Julius and not as subtle of a beer.  Julius is almost like orange peel/zest while Alter Ego is a mix of that and the actual fruit flesh.  To me, it's just as drinkable.  The mouthfeel is crisper... honestly, the only place Julius has a clear heads up on Alter Ego is in the nose, which a little more muted in this beer. 437 charactersdomdomdomdom, Jul 25, 2015

A- Semi hazy golden yellow body with a large creamy white head. Good retention eventually leaving a large ring and plenty of lace webs.
S- Nectar of the fruits. Melon, cantaloupe, mango, stone fruit, tropical and a bit of the TH bubblegum sweets. Juice.
T- This beer might take nectar to a whole new level. Fairly sweet but it suits the intense nectar fruit hops. Juiced melon, cantaloupe, melon, apricot, pineapple, passionfruit, peach, mint, bubblegum. Juicy and mostly clean of malts and yeast. Some zesty citrus and floral hints.
MF- Creamy and frothy. Medium bodied with moderately high carbonation. Somewhat bitter but very smooth.
This beer might be second to Green for me. Juicy and somewhat sweet but it really does work. Bubblegum TH burps and every stone and tropical fruit you can imagine. Really brings nectar/juice/pulp to a new level and probably better than the original in my eyes. 927 characterscbutova, Jul 17, 2015

4.49/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16 oz can straight from the brewery. 
The pour is a murky, deep orange color with a finger of off-white head. Minimal retention, leaving a fair amount of splotchy lacing around the rim of the glass. 
The aroma is fruity and extremely sweet, yet slightly piney. It's like Orange Fruit Punch with grass clippings. Very citrusy, perhaps moreso than Julius. A lot of orange and tangerine up front with the piney hop bitterness lingering in the back. 
The taste is a lot more piney than the nose indicates, however it is still very citrus forward. I get some sweet, candied-orange flavors up front, followed by spicy pine and even a sticky sap-like flavor on the end. The aftertaste is a perfect balance of sweet and bitter. 
The mouth is well-carbonated, a bit sticky, and full-bodied. Drinks more like a DIPA than a regular IPA. 
Overall, another fantastic IPA offering from Tree House. Not as good as Julius or Haze, in my humble opinion, but it definitely holds its own. 988 charactersScaryEd, Jul 10, 2015

4.6/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L - a dark, brooding orange. Turbid and angry-looking. I can see the beginnings of Devil Julius!
S - rich, ripe piney orange. Dank. Mosaic breadiness. 
T - sweet, citrusy dank orange yumminess. Julius had loads of fresh fluffy fruits while AE takes those fruits and candies em' hard. Add some hoppy dank pine and you've got the makings of an evil twin. Throw in a touch of tangy spiciness while we're at it too!
F - soft and billowing. Fluffy and cloud-like. Smooth with low carb. Dangerously drinkable. 
O - an excellent beer, but one of Tree House's weakest the way I see it. Hilarious, I know, when I consider a 4.3/5 beer "weak"! Unfortunately loses out on the fresh juiciness that makes Julius great; however, it brings something new and different to the table.
EDIT: I feel like I have to go back and re-do this review. The beer has changed so much since I started drinking it. It went from a dank, crisp, hoppy bastardization of Julius to something positively dropping with sticky juice. There is almost no bitterness and it really does taste like a downturned Julius. Loads of overripe orange and peach. Vanilla creamsicle. Ripe is the name of the game. Overripe Julius. I gotta admit, I like it way more now. Bumped to 4.6 from 4.3. 1,246 charactersagreenman19, Jun 28, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Reviewed from notes. 
A - Poured into the custom Tree House wine glass a clear orange hue with a thin head that fades slowly to leave just a little lacing.
S - Aromas of very nice citrus, oranges, tangerines. Super citrusy. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, though not quite as bright. Still loads of citrus peel and juice, oranges, tangerine, still pretty bright. Lightly bitter.
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, crisp, clean.
O - Overall, this was a very clean IPA. A delicious little spin on Julius.

4.8/5  rDev +5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a dark orange color.
The aroma hits of that dank quality of Mosaic with dank herbal, but dominated by sweet orange juiciness, peach, a bit of crackery malt.
The flavor follows with lots of orange sweetness of candy (Skittles, Runts, hard candy), and fruit. Some peach and mango. There's a sweetness that hits up front and on the middle, but a really light malt. Then onto a grass character and then a lingering bitterness of dank quality, along with grapefruit pith and zest.
The beer does stand up to Julius, but the dank quality possibly takes a bit away from it. 586 charactersdar482, Jun 19, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. This is apparently Julius with Amarillo and Mosaic hops added somewhere.
Appearance - Hazy orange body. Big white head. Nice lacing and retention.
Smell - Mosaic is strong with its garlicky aroma. Orange hops. 
Taste - Well that's tasty. Orange. The mosaic isn't as strong, but cuts the sweet orange happiness. Orange flavor really comes through in the back end. Low bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Really drinkable. Creamy carbonation. Medium body.
Overall - Delicious. If this is just an alteration on Julius, maybe I didn't give Julius a fair shake. 586 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 11, 2015
