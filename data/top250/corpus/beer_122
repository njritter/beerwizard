Smells very good and tastes even better, with a clear but not overdone contribution from the bourbon barrel aging, good balance and complexity.

The nose is bourbon and dark malts. Sort of like what I wish my wife smelled like after work. Some caramel notes.
Taste is bourbon and dark malts. Sort of like what I wish my wife tasted like after work. A little oaky, touch of cake.

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours blacker than the midnight sky with a one finger, super fizzy chocolate milkshake colored head. Retention is low and there are sparse chunks of sticky lacing left on the glass.
Smell is very strong bourbon and sweet milk chocolate, along with some caramel, vanilla and oak.
Taste is the same. Starts off with a huge helping of sweet chocolate cake that transitions to the caramel and vanilla mid sip with a bourbon and oak finish. The bourbon flavor is huge, but somehow this beer is in no way boozy.
Feel is full side of medium, slick, oily and really coats the whole palate. Carbonation is right on the money.
Overall this beer is excellent. The body could be a little more thick, but the booze is so well hidden. The bourbon and chocolate also go together wonderfully. The bourbon adds complexity and cuts through the sweetness of the base beer. Fantastic! 878 charactersCNoj012, Mar 15, 2017

Some might argue the people are loud and flamboyant, they steal our women, the succer players melodramatically flop on the pitch. Listen - that's all part of the secret Italian ingredient - keep it cool, confident, arrogant and extravagant. Forza Italia." Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout, brewed with natural flavor and aged in Bourbon Barrels. Available in 22 oz. bottles and on limited annual release draft.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.
(Appearance) Pours a rich, dark chocolate head of a crisp frothy consistency over a jet black, moderately viscous body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and patchy. 4
(Smell) Chocolate wafers, light caramel malt body and a delicate roast with overtones of Bourbon notes and a touch of sharp alcohol heat. The aroma of the body is perceptibly light yet appealing. Potency is moderate. 3.75
(Taste) Velvety, nutty chocolate forward with smooth caramel and vanilla undertones, finishing on a smooth transition to a slick, strongly flavored back end of bourbon flavor and soft heat. Nicely flavored in all the right places- surprisingly light drinking with a deceptively high ABV. The bourbon is very well integrated into this beer. 4.25
(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, moderately oily, lightly chewy, smooth, medium dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a medium frothiness and a mildly crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, heavy overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to earthy roast bitterness and bourbon alcohol. Alcohol presence is moderate and there are no off characters. 4.5
(Overall) Integrating bourbon into an already thoroughly enjoyable Imperial Stout does help complicate (for the better) the drinkability of this otherwise highly drinkable and nicely balanced Imperial Stout, graduating it to a more graceful, slower sipping beer, expected of a quality Imperial Stout. The subtleties of this beer are widespread, with the focus remaining  equally on the chocolate and bourbon, this beer does not lose any of its focus. One of the prized annual releases in EvilTwin's lineup and worthy of seeking out whenever it comes into town. A marked and welcome improvement over Imperial Biscotti Break standard and certainly worth the extra couple of bucks. 4.25

I had heard the hype and was excited to try it.  I'm not going to say it disappointed me but it certainly did not live up to the hype. Again , not a bad brew but not worth the price point and not up to the talk.  Nice aroma and coffee/chocolate are there but kinda weak IMO. Being in Jersey maybe I'm spoiled by Kane's Porters/Stouts  - which are clearly superior - but this one didn't do it for me. 550 charactersnjcraftguy, Jun 15, 2016

Bourbon vanilla chocolate shake taste, with some more bourbon.  Flavors blend together seamlessly.  While boozy, this brew has a ton of flavor, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla finishes it off.  Medium slick feel.  This one lives up to the hype, well done. 378 charactersNolaHopHead, May 21, 2016

The taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate, accompanied by some nice bourbon heat. Unfortunately around mid-palate, there is a noticeable drop-off in the flavor profile. Subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found, but the overall complexity (or lack thereof) keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion. Although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess, it seems to finish a bit thin for the style. I will say I was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character, without feeling boozy or overwhelming. Overall, it's very very good, and I'd happily drink another. 741 charactersglass_house, Apr 26, 2016

Some chocolate comes through as well. Its very rich on the nose and flavor. The base tastes course and artificial to me, but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out. I get a little vanilla from the barrel and I really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer.  The bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel. Overall, its a very good beer with a few flaws. 602 charactersdanh53, Apr 03, 2016

Pours a viscous motor-oil black forming a thin sliver of dense head dark mocha head.  The head is finely dotted with thin bubbles, recedes exceedingly slowly, and has excellent retention, leaving moderate lacing.  The nose on this beer is bourbon through and through.  Chocolate notes are unmistakeable, along with a sweet-biscuit - almost cookie - element that is decidedly unique.  The palate follows the nose, opening with boozy bourbon, milk and dark chocolate, and an almost chocolate-chip-cookie-like flavor.  Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy - not quite on par with the best-of-the-best BB Imp Stouts, but solid.  If you had told me that this beer was a slightly more subtle and bourbon barrel aged part of the Southern Tier Blackwater series, I'd hardly be surprised - there's the faintest hint of artificial in the flavoring here: not enough to ruin what is otherwise a very good beer, but enough to be noticed.  Ultimately, the various elements of this beer come together to make a very well done Imp Stout.  Top of its class?  No.  Overpriced and overhyped?  Without a doubt.  But another solid brew from Evil Twin?  Most definitely. 1,184 charactersLAp, Feb 21, 2016

4.22/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4This beer looks appropriately awesome, pouring blacker than any beer ought to and with a gorgeous, chocolate brown head. As for taste and texture, there's nothing wrong with it; it certainly checks off all the boxes of what a BBA stout ought to be, so I can't call it a disappointment by any measure. That said, when you charge $25 a bottle, I expect a little something extra to set itself apart, and I can't say this fits that bill. If this were, say, $16 a bottle, I'd highly recommend it. As it stands, I'd still recommend it, but it's far from a must-have. 560 charactersSir_Whats-his-face, Feb 12, 2016

The nose is much above the base beer with lots of bourbon and nice roasted malts.  The taste is smooth a nice mild bourbon flavor mixing with the malts and other roasted flavors.  The mouth feel is perhaps a little thin from what a great great stout should be be. But I'll get it a break and say that it is better than average.  IMO this is way above the base beer and the barrel aging does great things to this beer. 488 characterssmanson56, Feb 02, 2016

Smell is phenomenal. On par with BCBS. Sweet and savory. Bourbon, figs, raisins, toffee, oak, brown sugar, dark fruit.
Wow, the taste does not disappoint. Rich and simultaneously sweet and savory. Sweet, rich finish, like salted caramel. Tons of bourbon and charred oak. Caramelized sugar.
Mouthfeel is also the quite satisfying. Smooth, rich, and silky. Not quite the chewiness of BCBS, or even the Evil Twin Jesus series, but close.
Overall: Wow. Just wow. This the best beer I've had in months. 665 charactersccg, Jan 20, 2016

The pour is a black denser than twilight in Mirkwood, if the whole forest were bubbling a bit. The aroma is a step back from the base, it’s hard to even make a single nose hair perk up. Mild vanilla, mild roast, mild mild. Pretty mild. 
Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel Aged is one of those beers that’s been downgraded through its contact with the barrel. Gone are the nice subtleties of the base beer - all I get off of this is weirdly earthy vanilla, roast mixed with a finger of black licorice dipped in smoked meat. And that hangar Rocky’s beaten on really sticks around. The mouthfeel is on, but half a bomber? Looking a bit daunting right now. 
I just glanced down several reviews - what the fuck? Did I get a re-capped beer? Because this isn’t in the same galaxy as what I’m seeing described. Dense, weird, clashing, with only a faint lick of barrel. Big disappointment, & not even on the right side of mediocre; not very good. 1,109 charactersmaximum12, Jan 16, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Thank you ThisWangsChung!
Preliminary: Fresh bottle. 
Look: Pours dark and tar-like. No head, no retention. This is ready for prime drinking. 
Smell: Has an odd saucy smell to it which reminds me of tamari (Japanese dark soy sauce). I I pick up savory meat, coffee, sea salt, dark chocolate, oak and light caramel.
Taste: Initial taste is dark chocolate, soy sauce, peat, wood, salted caramel, Tahitian vanilla and a light bourbon upbringing. As the beer warms up, there is certainly a lingering bourbon and wooden flavor. 
Feel: Medium. This definitely has an oily texture to it that lingers only because of the boozy bourbon characteristic that is added to the flavoring. 
Overall: An interesting variant of IBB. Oddly enough, a 1 year aged IBB tastes very similar to this. I know this, due to having a couple for Thanksgiving. The soy sauce/tamari + wooden flavor definitely develops with some time on your typical IBB (as it loses coffee flavor). 956 charactersXenoreactive, Jan 14, 2016

Bourbon and sherry on the nose - this is definitely an aged bottle, but in a good way
Milk chocolate, a bit of booze and a touch of umame / soy sauce.  Drying and ashy finish not my favorite
Medium body for the style, very drinkable
Overall a very nicely done stout.  Bourbon influence has faded, but a smooth sipper none the less.  One to drink fresh I suspect. 500 characterspagriley, Jan 13, 2016

Fuller body with strong notes of both wood smooth and well-balanced with different notes of chocolate, little bit of vanilla/bourbon sweetness and possible toffee and even prunes (some type of dark fruit).  Easy passing, mellow body makes this dangerous sipper and finishes dry with notes of roasted coffee and booze and overall just a wonderful beer. 461 charactersclayrock81, Jan 13, 2016
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Yeah yeah, this is a pretty awesome dessert beer. One of the best I guess. I'm a bit of an evil twin lover, so perhaps a bit biased.
 I remember having this on my birthday in 2014  and had the privilege to compare it to a 2013 goose island bcbs on tap. Safe to say this was a sure winner. Now that I think about it, this may have been older, or at least aged better than the bcbs. Full disclosure - I would have given it a perfect 5 at the time. It seems consistency is the issue here.
 This bottle I've got here seems a little rough around the edges, which makes sense because I picked it up the same day it hit my bottle shop. A bit of age could do wonders to this beer. Or maybe it was just a better batch the first time I had it? In any case, its still a world class imperial stout, probably only topped by double barrel jesus, which is a much more intense experience.
Dbj has a bit more of a savory and alcoholic character, where this has a pleasant nuttiness, a bit of berry tartness, plenty of spice and tannin from the barrel, and that oh-so-delightful vanilla. OH YEAH the fudge. Who could forget the fudge? And yeah, you can taste almond.
The scent is ever so slightly better than the taste, but with a bit of time, the flavor will balance itself more, and this beer will become next-level.
In conclusion, great job! Great beer! Let me have another! 1,364 charactersJack_Malts, Jan 13, 2016

It is not on the level of Bourbon Country or Parabola by a long shot. Typical stout appearance with almost no head. Aroma is mild bourbon and malts. Flavor is decent but I expect a heck of a lot from a bourbon barrel aged stout, especially one that costs $25. The few Evil Twin beers I've had have been underwhelming and overpriced. Save your money and buy something from Firestone Walker instead. Reminds me of when I had a 50/50 Eclipse, what a let down. 538 charactersArrogantB, Jan 10, 2016

A- pours motor oil thick and jet black with a small foamy khaki colored head that eventually disappears completely, leaving nothing behind 
S- initial impression is of fresh mocha fudge brownies; tons of dark chocolate, caramel, walnuts, brown sugar, coffee, hints of vanilla & hazelnut. Plenty of bourbon and oak on the nose as well, adding some spicy woodsy notes on the end 
T- bold dark chocolate fudge mixes with strong herbal coffee up front, quickly giving way to burnt caramel, toasted walnuts & heavy vanilla cream.  Bourbon kicks in mid-palate, providing some flavors of barrel juice and spicy wood. The biscotti part doesn't really kick in until the linger, leaving traces of hazelnut & sweet vanilla 
M- heavy body with low carbonation leads to an oily mouthfeel that coates the tongue and finishes slightly creamy
O- in true ET, this is another bold and savory stout, with plenty of barrel notes and a sweetness of mocha fudge that makes this a spectacular sipper 1,015 charactersTreyliff, Jan 03, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours completely pitch-black. However, it doesn't offer as much tan-colored head (hehe) as the non-barreled version. What little head there is tries to leave lacing on the glass, however.
Wowee! This is rich and dessert-like as they come. Though the coffee is a little faded, I'm nonetheless picking up tons of brown sugar, chocolate, molasses, and roasted malt. Additional qualities The bourbon quotient is subtle yet palpably there, offering subtle touches of oak, vanilla, and banana. Yeah...this aroma just works - not just from the intensity of the notes, but the way they all tie together. 
I get a little more bourbon qualitiy flavor-wise. There's also a little less sweetness than the nose suggested. It actually starts off with some brown sugar, chocolate, and roasted flavors - the bourbon doesn't appear until the beer's finish. Still, it brings large amounts of oak and vanilla when it appears. Some dark fruits round out the two flavors in the mid-taste. This one is very woody, though. It's not quite as desserty as the base beer, but I'd argue it's more nuanced and complex.
The oak tannins make this a surprisingly dry beer - and a semi-drinkable one, too. It's clear this thick, massive beer wasn't ruined by the barrel. The texture still has a fullness to it that many barrel-aged stouts lack, though it's not motor oil thick. In spite of the oaky qualities, there isn't a hint of 11.5% to be found anywhere. 
The flavor profile doesn't quite live up to the aroma (it's not a big step down, thankfully). Nonetheless, it's a top-notch barrel-aged imperial stout that holds its own with the BCBSes of the world. It's big and complex, while remaining dry and (relatively) drinkable. This one costs a lot of cheddar, but considering I had an even more expensive barrel-aged imperial stout before this that was a huge step down, I'd say it's worth it.

4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours pitch black, like black hole black color, with a small foamy brown head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded on the quick side leaving a layer around the ring of the glass as it hissed away and dissipated. Lacing was decent, sliding down slowly after each sip. Kind of what I expected from a barrel aged imperial stout.  
Smells of molasses, brown sugar, espresso, dark chocolate, burnt wood, cocoa powder, mocha, coffee beans, roasted malt/grains, Whopper's candy, oaky notes, red wine, vanilla and bourbon. The bourbon aging and addition basically negates some of the cookie sweetness, but pulls in maple syrup, toffee, light piney hops, peat moss, more vanilla like vanilla beans, and booze which seems more sweet than smoky. The alcohol is very light and just part of the complex malty nose which was equally as impressive and enjoyable as the base Imperial Biscotti Break nose from the addition of the bourbon accents.
Flavor picks up right where the aroma left off, with the bourbon jumping out with some minor heat that quickly settles down and let's the rest of the malt base show off. Tastes like it smells, with cocoa powder, espresso, dark chocolate, burnt wood, burnt coffee grinds, molasses, brown sugar, burnt grains, Whopper's candy and real sweet vanilla which seem's like a fresh, crisp Chips Ahoy! cookie. The additions of the vanilla, oak/barrel notes, bourbon and general merlot-like sweetness only make the base beer better for me, as the alcohol provides a little heat and kick as it releases maple syrup, roasted nuts, bread crust, white chocolate and then some dark fruit like raisin, plum or dates. Piney hops, peppery spices, tea leaf and other earthy notes surface at the end to add balance and bring out more rich espresso and cookie dough elements. Smoked grains peek through with more dark chocolate as it warms up, but the bourbon accents made it a different and in some ways better beer that was also like a dessert with the biscotti-like aftertaste. Main difference between this and the base beer is that this is like washing down that delicious biscotti with a glass of bourbon, so you now get the best of both worlds.
Mouthfeel is velvety smooth across the tongue considering this is a dense, chewy beer that is thick and heavy in every way possible. It's meaty and just like a meal in a bottle. The aftertaste is lightly bitter, and the booze is present yet pleasant throughout as it manages to make the 11.5% ABV part of the experience to warm you up rather then take your breath away like a shout of bourbon. A masterful balancing act and dance of all the flavors to make this brew this smooth at this stage of the maturity. I don't think this bottle is that old, so the booze would have mellowed if I aged it but it was near perfection at this stage and I loved it. This is up there with all the Bourbon County Brand Stouts, KBS and all the big boys.
As I said with the base beer, it had everything I look for in an imperial stout and it came through with each sip. Add in the bourbon barrel aging and again Jeppe deserves thanks for creating another masterpiece. I highly recommend this beer; even though it is very expensive, to me it was worth the price. 3,209 charactersCHickman, Dec 22, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522oz bottle poured into a snifter.
A: Black as black can be. The head is straight brown in color and settles after a time. It can be revived though. Small dots of lacing remain as it recedes. 
S: Wave of mocha. Coffee pops. Fudge sauce and double chocolate cake. Notes of smoke and char underneath. Very nutty. There's even a marshmallow/vanilla sort of impression. Rocky road ice cream flashes to mind. The barrel is apparent but it takes more of a supporting and complementary role, echoing the malt with some woody char and backing it with a whiff of bourbon. Mouth-watering all in all.
T: Dense and layered chocolate envelopes the palate right away. The coffee addition can't shake the chocolatey malts and ends up coming across as a super rich mocha flavor. Lightly smokey and acidic from the coffee. Chocolate covered almonds. Marshmallows and melted chocolate. The barrel strides step for step with all of this and complements perfectly with some wood and char, decadent bourbon ball candy, nougat, and sweet bourbon. Nuts, marshmallow, chocolate, and lingering woody barrel and bourbon take the finish.
M: Big and thick in body. Very gentle though, with an easy velvety and airy whipped texture. Slightly coating. Little carbonation, but it isn't needed. It's like a chocolate truffle melting slowly in the mouth. Warming bourbon character adds a soothing nature.
O: I'm alone at home, but I stood up and started to slow-clap. This beer is that good. All flavors meld together in a perfect harmony, as happens only in the truly great beers. It tickles all my personal beer G-spots too. In fact, if given the choice between this beer and sex, I'd pick this beer at least some of the time. 1,700 charactersryan1788a5, Dec 07, 2015

4.09/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small mohagony head, fading to a small lacing at the edge of the glass. The head yields huge bubbles, turning to decadent alcohol legs after swirling.
Smells of moldy bitter chocolate, tons of fudge, a whiff of caramel and tobacco, tied together by a huge amount of roasted malts and bourbon soaked wood bark. While the Bourbon doubtlessly has a hot sting to it, it is well entangled into the beers soothing, rich malt qualities, creating a nutella like creaminess, as for a subtle hazelnuts layer on top. 
Has a low carbonation, leaving the spotlight on the beers full body, revealing a stunning creaminess, creating a silk mouthfeel, despite the hot Bourbon burn during the finish. 
While it begins earthy, with a profound roastiness to it, the beer develops a pungent, bitter dark chocolate character, mellowed by whipped cream and marshmellows. This balanced impression helps toffee, fudge and wooden vanilla to come up, while a tongue numbing sharpness follows immediately, once matured, dry oak hits the tastebuds. Profound Bourbon punches at the back of the throat for a short glance, producing a dry peak, balanced by mellow toffee, molasses and fresh brewed espresso. Leaves the palate as silk as during its beginning, while finishing way sweeter, to tame the very prominent, spicy Bourbon. 
There is a bit of an ambivalence going on in this for me. The beer produces a fantastic, utmost smooth mouthfeel, finding its antagonist in the equally profound Bourbon, which almost creates a certain harshness, numbing my palate. The same is true for a nutella like sweetness on the one hand, and dark bitter chocolate on the other. This beer is extreme. I find it astonishing that it is still able to exhibit a convincing balance, resulting in a sipper you can wrap your head around the whole evening. 1,855 charactersaleigator, Nov 15, 2015

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a large brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains rich chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, bourbon and dark fruit.
T: The taste starts out with a rich milk chocolate flavor followed by bourbon, dark fruit and coffee flavors. Then a touch of alcohol sting comes in along with a hearty roasted malt character. The hops presence is very faint as expected. The after-taste is slightly bitter-sweet.
M: Crisp, smooth and viscous, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid big stout to sip on for a long time. 836 charactersTheManiacalOne, Oct 15, 2015

Thanks for holding this bottle for me Kimbozz. Probably like 8 months old; 2014 most likely.
A- Pitch black pour from the bomber into six glasses for Stoutfest IV. A nutty light brown, foamy head rises up to a finger with decent retention. Small-ish ring drops spotty lacing.
S- Rich and dessert forward like the original but with a medium Bourbon barrel influence. Toasted almonds, deep fudgey chocolate, slight cherry-truffle, deep roast coffee and the barrel. The wooden vessel leaves a peppery whiskey, light vanilla and deep toast wooden feel.
T- Chocolate, biscotti, Bourbon and big malts combine to make some sort of truffley dessert brew. The whiskey and barrel flavors really get strong at this juncture with hot Bourbon, caramel, vanilla sweets and old wood. Buttery toasted almonds, cherry dessert, deep bitter cocoa powder, charred barley, slight whiskey sour and fudge.
MF- Big body but actually somewhat thinner than I would imagine probably due to the massive ABV and the added barrel whiskey. Medium high carbonation and a slick frothy texture. Finishes rather warm.
The classic dessert-esque Biscotti Break flavor with large portion of whiskey at least in the flavor. To me the combination is very well done and it almost tops the original. 1,290 characterscbutova, Jul 20, 2015

4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Pours a pitch black with mocha colored head. Fluffy, milky, head that hangs around the edge of the glass.
Nose is big vanilla, heavy oak, sweet bourbon. Slight Chocolate. Not a whole lot past the oak and vanilla. 
Taste begins milky, vanilla, marshmallowy goodness. Some toasted coconut and creamy sweet chocolate take over. No noticeable bourbon burn until a sllight flash at the end. Oak and caramel and bourbon on the finish.  Finishes sweet but doesn't stay very sweet too long, just the right amount of time.
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Slightly sticky sweet. But just enough to leave the palate wanting more.
Overall an amazing beer. Absolutely amazing. 665 charactersBigRedDog, Jan 13, 2015

A  black right out of the bottle, a dark noisy head fizzes out quickly leaving no laced, I'm guessing this one picked up some booze in the barrel because shes got legs
S  heaps of barrel, vanilla, burnt marshmallow, some sweetened coffee,  nutella, booze, chocolate, smells like something I want to eat, smells like cake topping
T  somehow there's even more barrel, char, burnt malt, bourbon and booze, cream added to the sweet coffee, nutty but not nutella I was smelling, a little different from the nose but still awesome
M  not as thick as expect but far from thin, some heat not doubt but nothing crazy, a little oily on the palate but sticky on the lips, lots of char on the finish 
O  with a world class base beer this one had a great chance for success, a little boozy and perhaps it could use some cellar time to be out of this world but I'm stoked to be drinking this today
I really want one of these to age but what can you do? amazing base beer and the barrel just adds to the mix, this would be one of the best beers I've ever had after it mellows out, seek it out!! 1,171 characterswordemupg, Jan 04, 2015

A: pitch black, small sliver of tan head, little to no lacing 4.25
S: huge bourbon notes, scotch like peat, short bread, nutty, excellent 4.5
T: lots of barrel notes with oak and bourbony vanilla, vase beer flavors of chocolate and an almond like nutty character, very good but the barrel notes seem to mute instead of compliment the base beer 4.25
M/D: full bodied, a bit chewy, carbonation appropriate, ABV very well masked, drinkability is very good 4.5
O: excellent beer, to be honest I'm not sure I like it more than the regular IBB, cause like I said I feel at times the barrel notes mute some of the wonderful base beer characters. That being said I absolutely love regular IBB so that's not really a slight on this one at all 4.5 773 characterszac16125, Dec 21, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7522oz bottle with no visible freshness date poured into a Rastal Teku 2.0 stemmed glass (about 14oz decanted on first pour). I know this is relatively fresh since it showed up at my local liquor store about one week ago.
A- Although technically an Imperial Porter, the appearance is as menacing as the boldest Imperial Stout...thick, viscous, used motor-oil black with 1/2-finger worth of a mocha head with no retention. (4.75)*
S- The aroma is crazy and really embraces everything you smell when opening a tin of chocolate-dipped biscotti foodstuffs. Almond, Hazelnut, Vanilla, Chocolate, (slight) bourbon and alcohol are all represented. (5.0)
T- Milk Chocolate/Nutty/Vanilla sweetness consumes the palate with the same flavors as detected in the nose. These must have been wet barrels because sweet Bourbon is the next flavor to come to the fore. An oily, Dark Chocolate-covered Espresso Bean bitter finish leaves the palate dry and more than keeps the sweetness in check. The alcohol warmth rises well after the sip. The heat from the bourbon (and what I guess to be some almond and hazelnut extracts) might be distracting for some, but it just adds to the 'extreme' nature of this beer.  As it elevates to room temperature, the bourbon barrel comes out in spades...outrageous! (5.0)
M- This is a creamy, silky, full bodied and palate coating libation with spot-on carbonation. The flavor and alcohol warmth lingers which demands slow consumption and contemplation. (5.0)
O- With regards to the initial pour, IBB-BBA is one of the most unique beers I have ever experienced and squarely deserves recognition alongside with other BBA beers in the same class (BCBS, KBS, Backwoods Bastard, BBA Plead The 5th, BBA Narwhal, etc.)...they really nail the "Liquid Biscotti" character. Although I have never had the non-BBA version, the bourbon barrel character is definitely present and amplifies the intensity. 
*Unfortunately, the second pour was not as remarkable as the first as it seemed to lose that 'Liquid Biscotti' character and resembled more of a non-adjunct, BBA Imperial Stout. Couple that with the hefty price point (I've seen sell for upwards of $25/bottle), it makes it hard to justify the cost. However, if you have an excuse to celebrate with beer and a couple of extra dollars, this is one is worthy. (4.75) 2,327 charactersthreeviews, Dec 13, 2014

Jet black in appearance, mocha tan head. Roasted, chocolatey goodness oozing out of this bad boy. Big fan of the Regular Imperial Biscotti and this adds a welcomed amount of booziness from the barrels used. Not overly sweet for a relatively high ABV roasted malt backbone type of brew. Definitely worth seeking out, one to enjoy now and one to enjoy later. 433 charactersHesscabob, Dec 08, 2014

A: Pours a thick near black color with a finger of ruddy dark brown head that quickly faded into a faint bubbly collar.
S: Rich and decadent scents of toffee, caramel, and leather beneath dominating notes of sweet bourbon, buttery oak and greasy chocolate syrup. I get a hint of dark fruits and spice as well.
T: Rich and potent like the nose. I get huge flavors of chocolate brownie, chocolate syrup, sweet and buttery bourbon barrel, and brown sugar. I get a touch of candied fruits, vanilla, and roast in the finish. I get a touch of bitter coffee as well. The aftertaste is spicy and has lingering notes of chocolate and roast. The booze is very mellow and buttery with no trace of heat at all.
M: Very thick and chewy body, viscous mouthfeel, tight and velvety carbonation. There's a decent bitterness in the finish as well.
O: An underrated barrel aged stout. This drinks exceptionally well with potent flavors and a smooth and full mouthfeel. Delicious. 987 charactersscottfrie, Nov 02, 2014

Bourbon's more backseat flavor, notes of amaretto and oak. Vanilla? Maybe. Dialed back version of the Doughnut Break with a cookie twist. Robust but not a shock or punch to the mouth. Could stand to be more forward. Not worth $30, IMO. 
Stout, not a porter. Not particularly smooth, has a good edge to it. 382 characterspants678, Oct 31, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Nice and dark.
S - Massive, milky coffee notes up front. A modicum of nuttiness mid-palate followed by a hint of vanilla bean ice-cream to finish. Marzipan and maple as it warms.
T - Coffee-forward, following the nose. Bourbon is there, although I'd like more. Finishes fairly dry. Plain chocolate flavours grow as it warms.
M - Quite smooth, medium-full in body. 
O - This is certainly a very competent imperial stout. At $25 it certainly doesn't come cheap, and it is not clear to me that it's worth the mark-up over other highly-rated options. It is absolutely essential that you let this warm for its secrets to become unlocked should you choose to dabble. 668 charactersabeeronthebeach, Oct 25, 2014

This has been a huge want of mine for a long time. Now I got it. Theres nothing negative to say about this brew. Enough chitchat lets describe this brew for you!
First when you pop this top smoke comes out like a barrel of a smoking gun. Then when poured, it is jet black with a dense mocha head. The roasted malts coat the glass while I twirl it around. Very entertaining brew. 
Now forth with the aroma! Huge barrel notes with hints of the original Biscotti Break. Huge oak and vanilla notes that make love in your nostrils. The mixture is complete balance with the coffee and chocolate cookie crumble of IBB. This smells phenomenal! 
The flavor is just as the aroma details with more malt sweetness. Chocolatey cookie crumble, coffee roast and vanilla is just outstanding to the point I just  want to taste this beer forever. The bourbon notes comes together nicely toward the finish, bringing toasted oak to the drinker's taste buds. This brew finishes sweet, syrupy and bitter with a balanced dryness. Lingering bourbon and chocolate in the aftertaste. 
The feel on the palate medium bodied and smooth. The carbonation tickles the flavors on the palate just enough to make it interesting and not just cough syrup. 
Overall: Bam! This is my favorite variant of the IBB. well, i guess you cant go wrong with the base beer either. The flavors are well balanced, sweet and no booze detected (always a good thing). I am simply wowed by this offering on the depth of flavors coming out of it. No lines no gimmicks, this beer is Recommended! 1,560 charactersShroud0fdoom, Oct 19, 2014

4.36/5  rDev -2.7%Bottle in trade. Excited for this one. Pours thick, viscous pitch black with a little more than a finger of dark brown head that settles creamy espresso colored. Beautiful aroma of anise, roast, chocolate, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, caramel. Flavor is very sweet as expected, with a surprising amount of anise/licorice up front, chocolate covered raisins, some coffee roastiness, bourbon, molasses, light vanilla, and some definite oxidized metallic flavors. Bourbon is very smooth, and the booze here is extremely smooth. Huge body, beefed up even from the base version, with medium low carbonation. Everything about this is really nice, but the metallic note is more present than most any other beer I've tried, and that makes me sad because it does take away from the rich dessert flavor that is in here. Don't get me wrong, it's really good, but I would like to try this again some time, hopefully with a bottle that doesn't have these qualities. I think it would push up the score a good .4-.5 points and putting it in the truly world class category for me. 1,061 charactersBMMillsy, Oct 17, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%After having the original and bourbon versions they are both pretty tasty. Both sweet as can be to mask a high ABV. When it's out of the refrigerator you get a lot of the sweet flavors like some vanilla, chocolate, coffee like flavors. As it warms SOME bourbon comes out with some dark fruit flavors and a bit more of a booze flavor. This one goes down very easy but I wish I got a bit more from the barrel. I don't like bourbon by itself but I've come to appreciate it in my stouts and this one doesn't deliver as much as I'd like. I'd drink it again but not going to make my top 5 by any means. 596 charactersFlight317, Oct 02, 2014

3.8/5  rDev -15.2%Similar to the non barreled one, the smell is woody with a bit of coffee roast, only more coffee and chocolate this time. A hint of bready unlike the other, but just a hint. When I do a really aggressive pour to get some head, I get a milky garbage smell on the end of that woody smell. When the head is gone, so is that smell. Milky garbage?! WTF! Later it smooths out into an almost clean fruity smell along with a kind of malty sugar syrup Sugar Smacks cereal smell
Thinner than expected but a bit thicker than the non barreled one.
First taste is balanced between a the woody note from the aroma, a little bready something, a little chocolate, and a hint of nickel. Later it's more coffee and chocolate.
I get zero bourbon and no more wood than with the unbarreled one, which wasn't supposed to have any in the first place, and not a good wood but a weird green one. If there is supposed to be any of the namesake biscotti flavour in this, I'm not getting anything recognizable, though unlike the unbarreled version there's at least a hint of breadiness.
I almost never pour anything out, but given that this was a bummer and given that it had some really odd things about it and given that I was otherwise just bored with it, I just wasn't motivated to finish it and poured out about the last quarter of it. That's the absolute last result I expected from this beer of all beers. I've looked forward to this for so long.
I had heard wonderful things about this but it's really nothing special as imperials go. Disappointing. Had I not had any idea what to expect, I'd have said it was "OK ". It has some basic positives going on, but it is memorable more for its flaws. 1,679 charactersBrownNut, Sep 24, 2014

Appeared a thick, oily black color with a light brown head that disappeared quickly.
Smells of roasted malts, dark chocolate and alcohol.
Tastes like a melted Hershey's special dark.  One of the most chocolate dominant beers I have had.  Quite delicious and very rich.
Mouthfeel is thick and velvety.  A bit of heat on the backend.

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%22 oz bottle released in 2014 poured into Teku
Appearance: Pours dark black, as expected, with a nice finger of khaki head. The head collars after a few minutes.
Smell: Rich fudge, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, molasses. The fudge really stands out, this is like sticking your nose in freshly whipped brownie batter. This has less Bourbon and more chocolate on the nose than BCBS. Amazing smelling stuff.
Taste: Huge chocolate up front, followed by Bourbon, caramel, coffee and then some vanilla with rich roast on the finish. This really hides the booze well...drinks like it's under 10% for sure.
Mouthfeel: Not BCBS thick, but thicker than KBS. It's certainly not lacking in the mouthfeel dept.
Overall: I wasn't the biggest fan of the base beer, and I liked Doughnut Break the best, before this. However, when a beer is good, it needs to get credit. This is just an outstanding barrel aged Imperial Stout, and it tastes remarkably similar to BCBS, which I just had last night (2012). The only difference is, this beer was bottled about 6 months ago and drinks pretty smooth. Even at 6 months, Bourbon County was still pretty hot and needed about 2 years of age to get as smooth as this, imo. Although you can age Bourbon County for quite a while, this brew has to be given credit for its smoothness at a young age...although I don't believe it will age as gracefully as BCBS. Would definitely drink again, although I'd personally rather spend $25 on a 4 pack of BCBS and get 2x the awesome barrel aged stout for the same amount of cash. 1,545 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Sep 13, 2014

4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a very dark brown colour; tan head, bit listless. Lacing also a bit listless. Looks heavy, and a bit unnuanced somehow.
Smells hugely, hugely chocolatey. In the best possible way. Smells sweet, but rich and cocoa-heavy, with tinges around the edge of sugary rum, spiced brandy, currants, raisins, cinnamon. This is fucking magic in a glass. The best aroma I can remember getting from a beer in years. 
Taste doesn't quite reach the heights of the smell, but then what could? Rich, sticky and chocolatey there, with notes of brandied cherries, currants, port wine and just rich gooey chocolate fondant. Boozey upfront, has a mild cocoa-tinged roasted bitterness late, but just huge, rich, sticky chocolatey stout. Fantastic.
Bit sharp from alcohol upfront, but it doesn't last throughout. Gets more mellow just due to sheer density late. Very pleasant.
If there's ever been chocolate in a glass, this beer is it. But it's a rich, complex, interesting chocolate with loads of character. It would rate off the scale as a chocolate. In beer form it's phenomenal. 1,068 characterslaituegonflable, Aug 11, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 ounce bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark fudge, vanilla, toast, toffee, molasses, bourbon, oak, nuttiness, light dark fruits, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with good strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark fudge, molasses, vanilla, toast, toffee, bourbon, oak, nuttiness, light dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, roasted malt, dark fudge, vanilla, toast, toffee, molasses, bourbon, oak, nuttiness, light dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and perfect balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a nice roast bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, smooth, and luscious mouthfeel that is insane. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely world class barrel aged imperial coffee stout. All around insane complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An absolutely sublime offering. 1,655 characterssuperspak, Aug 02, 2014

The nose is full and rich with vanilla, coconut, lots of coconut, chocolate, caramel malt, oak, bourbon cream and some dark fruit.
The flavor is luscious creamy chocolate, coconut, vanilla, a mid palate of yet more chocolate and a fudge like finish. Throughout, there's a subtle bourbon creaminess that is never intrusive but simply amplifies the flavors.
The feel is thick, smooth and velvety; masking any and all alcohols yet never being too sweet.
Double Barrel Hunahpu and King Henry are the only two that may beat this out otherwise this is the new Gold Standard. 716 charactersKYGunner, Jul 28, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Joel for breaking this one out.
Viscous pour, thick brown-black, with a solid brown head that sank to a collar and held there, lacing the glass nicely. Lots of chocolate and dark malty goodness in the nose, notes of licorice, almond, vanilla, bourbon. Flavor profile started out much like the regular version of the beer, or the regular/imperial version, but quickly gave way to a huge wall of brownie batter, fudge soaked in bourbon--salivating--lesser notes of almond and vanilla, caramel. All things good and stouty. Robust mouthfeel, smooth and creamy, full body. Excellent overall. This could stand and hold its ground right alongside any BCBS variant, and other big boys of the style.
This was quite a surprise. I mean, all the other versions of this beer have been pretty good, but this was easily the best that I've tried, and I'd say most likely the best Evil Twin beer I've had to date. Must get more. 923 charactersRifugium, Jul 26, 2014

Shared a bottle with my brother Jim (I should say he shared a bottle with me.).
The aroma was heavenly, the taste was better (how is that possible?). 
Could almost taste a little butter on the Biscotti.

The smell is tangy with bourbon. More whiffs reveal licorice, oak, caramel, toffee and roasted grain to char like earth. Overall a pleasantly complex aroma with the bourbon being bold but not dominating.
The taste includes plenty of roast and some tangy bourbon forward alcohol. Mid-palate are flavors of oak, licorice, coffee and dark raisony alcohol. A touch of toasted coconut is present in the finish which is really nice.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is nice and I appreciate the opportunity to try it but I really believe I actually prefer the base beer more. 777 charactersstakem, Jul 14, 2014

4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz brown bomber purchased from Ales Unlimited in San Francisco, CA. Brought back to Australia where I cracked it open on a brewday with Sam and Chris.
Pours a lovely sinewy black, with a deep brown head of slightly frothy foam that settles out into a firm ring. Some patchy lace, but that's not what you're looking at in a beer this heavy. Body is thick and silky. Carbonation is powdery. Looks the business.
Nose is wonderful. All of the bleeding-edge oak-aged vanilla and bourbon characters you would expect, laced with a foundation of extreme sweetness and twists of tomato and cinnamon. It's really excellent. There is something of the sweet biscotti to it as well, possibly entirely suggested by the name—but the naming is genius either way. I either taste it because of the name, or the name brilliantly describes the characteristics. I don't care which, I still love it.
Taste is also really excellent. Sublime even. Smooth entry leaves silky vanilla and sweetness through the centre of the palate, with leavened, slightly bulbous tones of vanilla custard and butter biscuits. Roast is bittersweet, and always coated with those lovely bourbon vanilla characters, but it leaves a fragrant, slightly aromatic bitterness towards the back. Mostly, though, it's just sweet, luscious, vanilla-potent and gorgeous. A truly phenomenal oak-aged stout.
Feel is perfect. Smooth, glossy, rich and beautifully full. It accentuates the flavours and deepens their development.
Yep—no kidding, this is a truly phenomenal beer. This is beer at its highest peak. The richness, the smoothness, the complexity—they make this beer into something absolutely sublime. Truly, one of the best beers I've ever tasted. 1,711 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 12, 2014

S: 4.75 Smells sweet. Lots of chocolate, vanilla, and roasted nuts. The barrel is pretty strong, but a bit more restrained than BCBS. There’s also some dark fruit on the nose and a little bit of coffee in there too.
T: 4.5 Starts off rather sweet with similar characteristics as the nose. Big chocolate, nuts, vanilla, and bourbon. Unlike the nose, the roasted malt comes through more leaving a bit of bitterness at the end. The additives and the base beer are very well balanced. The biscotti flavor is very impressive, but the stout is done so well that the biscotti isn’t stealing the show. 
M: 4.75 The beer is pretty thick, but it looked like it would be thicker from the pour. In this case, I think it’s good thing because it’s a very rich beer and there’s so much going on. Having the mouthfeel on the (slightly) lighter side is nice.
O: 4.75 This is an excellent beer. There is so much flavor and a lot going on, but it’s very well balanced. The barrel and the added flavors compliment the base beer rather than dominate. 1,170 charactersTele, Jun 29, 2014
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pitch black (seriously like crude), a very thin collection of tan bubbles floating here and there. Aroma is quite the molasses bomb. Some chocolate blends in as well as some deeply roasted malt character. Taste is also incredbly dessert like. Something along the lines of roasted carrots along with the high levels of molasses. Bourban plays its rola in this beer but doesn't take over in any way, alcohol is not hot. The oak comes out the same, present but not obnoxious. Slick mouthfeel, heavy bodied but not syrupy. 518 charactersPhigg1102, Jun 28, 2014

Pours jet black with a deep tan quarter finger head. After a brief moment only a thin halo remains, leaving very little lace. 
Roasty, sweet, inviting aromas of chocolate, vanilla, almonds, bourbon and mild coffee. Quite nice. 
The taste has all of that Imperial Biscotti Break goodness but taken up a notch. Mild yet flavorful bourbon, creamed coffee, amaretto, rich chocolate, oaky vanilla, nutty, caramel, roasted grains and some alcohol. Good and sweet with a roasty coffee bitterness than keeps it in check. Really opens up nicely as it gets a bit warmer. Outstanding. 
Creamy, viscous and moderately heavy body with soft carbonation. Bourbony vanilla, mochacino and caramel linger on the tongue in the delicious aftertaste. 
This is the total package- earning/ delivering high marks in every catagory. The bourbon really elevates the base beer- and that's really saying something based on how good Imperial Biscotti Break already is. The barrel treatment adds a delicious bourbon glaze to the solid foundation of chocolate, coffee and amaretto. A hunt-worthy gem that, for me, more than lived up to that pesky thing we call hype. 1,242 charactersThickNStout, May 17, 2014

Bottle to Torst Glass
22oz
2013 release
Purchased at Cork & Barrel Liquor, Lawrence, KS
App- A huge thick and creamy crimson black pour. Similar to liquid chocolate and garnet mixed with a small 1" darker brown head with a puddle of bubbles. Once thats fades, its pure flat stout and sexiness.
Smell- Holy hell batman. (Is what I said about the base version) This is x5 of that with bourbon!!!! I wanna bath in the aroma. Very similar to BCBVS but with this time the vanilla and bourbon. Creamy, malty, rich and syrupy thick on the nose. Coffee is very mellow and only touches of bitter.
Taste- Okay so this is a bad ass beer. Its big, rich and creamy. The base version was pretty good and this really takes it up a notch. I like the bourbon notes to it, more vanilla. More chocolate, more everything. The richness of the base beer is there but the barrel doesnt overpower at all. I have a respect for the fine touches on this one. The barrel lends well to the graham cracker crust of the previous beer with more refinement.
Mouth- A very creamy and almost thick body. Not oily or that filling but a substantial body. The carbonation is straddling the line between and a low and medium body. A good residual grainy coffee and chcocolate flavor with a bit of cracker.
Drink- I could go into this big thing about the base vs. BA version. I will just OUT F N Standing. 1,391 charactersFosterJM, May 11, 2014

Aroma is huge dark chocolate, caramel, bourbon and vanilla. Rich and decadent, the aroma drips off this beer. Nutty and earthy on the swirl.
Taste is rich and complex. Warm bourbon, chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla. Both bitter and sweet. Simply delicious.
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, sticky. There's no mistaking, this is a big sipper of a dessert beer.
Overall this is among the better bourbon barrel stouts I've had. Great balance, decadent mouthfeel, excellent body. For some reason I wasn't particularly excited about this one, but I'll be grabbing more next time I see it. 732 charactersdraheim, May 06, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle stored in cellar at 45 degrees , poured into a Teku glass. Pours a beautiful, velvety jet black. A two finger mocha colored head quickly forms, then after a brief moment it slowly starts to sink into the darkness of the beer below it. Ultimately the creamy head disappears in its entirety, save for an elegant ring that forms around the glass. A beautiful beer.
From the moment the bottle was opened, a fiery explosion of vanilla and wild cherries made its way to my nose. It was closely followed by the warming aroma of bourbon and a sweet companion to it that reminds me of maple syrup. Worthy to note – I have not smelled the glass yet – this beer’s scent is so penetrating and far reaching that I’m picking these aromas out having the glass roughly a feet away . Upon smelling the beer in the glass milk chocolate and coffee ice cream flavors surface, making the vanilla and cherries even more appealing. Bourbon is still detected, as is maple syrup but these were not nearly as dominant as I expected them to be. A notably absent aroma is oak/wood. After the first few sips I can say that the taste is so well balanced and the alcohol is so well hidden that it’s almost unbelievable. A chocolaty and warming sensation is the first impression you get after tasting it, soon thereafter a soft and inviting vanilla flavor mixed with cherries takes over, ultimately leading you to a dessert like finish with characteristics of coconut, latte and maple syrup. A blend of spices can be felt in your palate – I would say nutmeg is definitely present.
Mouthfeel is as great as it gets – its rich, velvety and creamy allowing you to almost chew the flavors out of this beer. Almost no carbonation, as expected. 
Overall: Every sip is an experience – this beer is phenomenal. The only drawback (and hence my lower overall score) is its price. At $25.99 a bottle – this is a beer to be had in very special occasions if at all. I do consider it unique enough and worthy of its value (no regrets!) – however, I do consider other BBA to be worthy competitors at much lower price points (Parabola, BBPt5, BCBS). Bottom line - wow. Both on your palate and your wallet. 2,194 charactersHoppySeb, May 05, 2014

S: Light to moderate aromas of bourbon are present in the nose. These become a little stronger as the beer warms up. 
T: The taste has flavors of bourbon from the barrel aging along with notes of dark chocolate and bits of coffee and sweetness. Except for the bourbon, no alcohol is present in the taste. 
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: This is a well balanced barrel aged beer as the bourbon doesn't overpower the beer and you still can taste the flavors of the underlying stout. This would make for a really good dessert beer to sip and savor. 790 charactersmetter98, Apr 27, 2014

The beer has a finger tall dense foamy dark mocha head that slowly reduces to a large patch of thin film covering the majority of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate aromas of bourbon, vanilla, and oak over the top of light aromas of roasted malts and hints of milk chocolate.
T: Upfront there is a moderate flavor of roasted malts, coffee, and slightly sweet dark chocolate. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Minimal amounts of bitterness in the finish which does not linger.
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Hints of alcohol warming in the finish.
O: Very well balanced between the complementary flavors from the barrel aging and the base stout. Really enjoyable and hides the alcohol pretty well. Definitely one I'm glad I'm getting a chance to try a second time and makes a very nice dessert beer. 1,171 charactersdbrauneis, Apr 26, 2014

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a MadTree snifter. The pour is very black and viscous with about a finger of light brown head that quickly gets swallowed up by the rest of the beer. I get lots of rich malt and bourbon notes on the nose. They complement other aromas of dark chocolate, oak, and vanilla.
The beer has a full body, a slick, oily feel, and an exquisite flavor. Loads of sweet malt, milk chocolate, and toffee flavors greet you up front. I find that the oak notes from the barrel seem to arrive before the bourbon notes do, lending some vanilla and caramel-like flavors to the hodgepodge of sweetness before the bourbon does its thing. It charges in (like it does), but never gets out of control. It blends with all the sweet notes and provides alcohol warmth and boozy richness to the flavor, bringing to mind an after-dinner liqueur. A hint of dark fruit tinges the flavor (possibly also a hint of coconut) and joins the bourbon and chocolate on the finish. Not what I would call dangerously drinkable. It's more of a sipper. Oddly, the feel seems thin under all that sweetness, but it's still fairly creamy.
I was always under the impression that the standard Imperial Biscotti Break was a very sweet, coffee-flavored imperial stout. I found that beer to be quite well-balanced and not intensely sweet at all. Now THIS beer (the Bourbon barrel aged version), is very sweet indeed. I don't get any coffee out of it at all, but I do get loads of toffee, chocolate, and bourbon and those flavors play very nicely on my palate. I'm not going to drink this whole bottle in one night. I'm going to enjoy it over a few nights and evaluate it each time. I hope Evil Twin makes this stuff again (and again and again!). Definitely worth seeking out. Pick this up if you find it. 1,779 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Apr 24, 2014

S: Smells very strongly of both bourbon and oak. Nothing else comes across the nose.
T: Right off the bat the bourbon, then a some dark chocolate and espresso without just a hint of bitterness. It tastes wonderful. The bourbon is very strong, but not to the point where it tastes like I'm drinking bourbon. Although the bourbon flavor is there, neither the alcohol from it nor the beer stands out. It has just a hint of bitterness but it is very very light. I get the presence of oak in the beer but only via the bourbon flavor. It doesn't stand out by itself. It's hard to describe what makes this beer taste so good. The best way I can put it, is that every flavor seems to fit into place like puzzle pieces. 
M: The mouthfeel is perfect. Nice and creamy, full bodied, coats the mouth elegantly, and finishes clean. No harsh bitterness at any point. Everything right where it should be.
O: After taking the first sip I knew that I liked this beer. It is something I very highly recommend. I would buy it again. 1,105 charactersteromous, Apr 17, 2014

A-The beer is dark, but not quite black in color. The head is thin and very dark dark brown. Retention is minimal; just a few seconds before it fades to a collar. The beer shimmers in the light and doesn't reveal much carbonation.
S-The aroma is a bit hot and harsh at first, with lots of bourbon heat and fusel alcohol coming through. My schnoz soon adjusts and I sniff hot fudge, drip coffee, raspy oak, caramel, a touch of cream, vanilla, marshmallow, some raisin, and a bit of bitter almond. Complex, but hot.
T-The taste is similar to the smell: lots of bourbon barrel here. I get oak, vanilla, caramel, a touch of cream, some fudge, raisin, fig, as well as bitter coffee grounds and almond on the finish. 
M-The feel is thick and slightly syrupy on this older bottle (at least a year in my cellar). Carbonation is lower than average.
O-I had tasted this before and really loved it, but this full review left me a little less blown away. Don't get me wrong, this is a very, very good beer with layers of flavors, but I found it too hot and aggressive to compete with my favorite beers in this style, e.g., Uncle Jacobs. I guess I like my bourbon barrel stouts to have more smooth character and I think that the adjuncts here multiply the bitterness and harshness that the style typically possesses. Anyway, glad I finally pulled the trigger on drinking my bottle. 1,462 charactersspoony, Apr 11, 2014

A very dark brew, nearly jet black coming out of the bottle, but hits with dark black walnut body colors, and produces a half finger of very dark mocha brown head. It manages to stay even a little, bit but settles to a VERY dark thin collar, and whispy thin top. Very impressive looking beer, one of the darkest heads I've ever seen as well.
Nice bouquet. Fruit forward a bit, quite a good hint of soft molasses, reminds me a lot of bourbon county actually. Some mild soft acid and sourness but not off putting at all. Good soft roasting char as well, with some bitter tobacco leaf hanging out also. Very impressive.
Palate brings the good in spades. A light but silky and rich feeling mouth, but the acidity brings it down slightly in wetness. There's also just a tip of fizz on the tongue at first sip. Dark chocolate washes over with a small raspberry faint fruit which comes out neither sweet nor sour, but sort of neutral. The aftertaste is the most impressive, some chewy dough and cookie like aromas come out almost bakers chocolate. Dark chocolate cookie and fudge finish. Not even boozy warm, but with large milkshake like qualities. Sweetness comes out like glycerin after time, woah that's impressive.
This is real impressive, and extremely dangerous. This drinks so easily, and while not all the parts are perfect or laid out in a nice row, I am going to be missing this when I finish this bottle. Gone far too fast. 1,477 characterssmakawhat, Apr 09, 2014

Outshadowed by DBD and AB Mex Cake earlier in the night, was still quite nice.
Pours a DARK black, with a one inch mocha-colored head, and good lacing down the glass.
Smells include bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla.
The same decadent aromas translate to the taste. The bourbon is up front, but folded nicely into everything else. Tons of vanilla, burnt sugar, chocolate, coffee, hazelnuts, caramel. Decadently sweet.
Silky smooth mouthfeel, full body. Very drinkable despite the ABV.
Probably my favorite IBB variant, this was nice. 602 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 05, 2014

Aroma of plenty of bourbon, dark sweet malt with a hint of toastiness and vanilla. Flavor is dominated by bourbon and dark sweet toasted malt, hints of vanilla, chocolate and oak, nicely integrated. Finishes with bourbon and warming alcohol. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A nice bourbon barrel aged stout. The great Biscotti stout base is less complex than the original, or overwhelmed by the barrel influence, but it hardly matters. It is a great stout that supports the bourbon very well. The alcohol is well covered, but leaves a warming, boozy finish. I have greatly enjoyed all versions of this stout and love bourbon aged flavors, so this is a total pleasure. 788 charactersLiquidAmber, Mar 28, 2014

A: dark-roasted coffee black, tan/brown sustaining head; minimal lacing
S: chocolate and a light bourbon smell, some coffee taste
T/M: of course, once the beer got to temperature, it peaks with a fruity bitterness (think raspberry or blueberry) tickling the much more prevalent chocolate roasted/vanilla sweetness in the balanced taste. The barrel-aging is subdued in my opinion, and is noticeable mainly, yet lightly, in the end of the taste.
O: very solid, good flavored beer. Maybe a little on the sweet side for some, and not strong on the bourbon battle flavors, but that sits fine with me. The "special" nature of the beer accentuates more so that dominates this variation on the original. 840 characterscjgiant, Feb 13, 2014

Not the best I've had, but up there. Very pricey, better options for less money, but this would be one to buy & stock up on it money isn't a problem ( one bottle for me & that's it). ABV is felt more than tasted, they way I like it. This really makes me want to try stuff from Westbrook, they seem to be the real talent in play...

I had been holding on to the bottle for a few months, but I recently broke it out following a delicious homemade Italian dinner. The Bourbon Barrel-Aged Imperial Biscotti Break pours a deep dark brown/black with a thick brown head. The smell was amazing with dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, and some nuttiness. The taste includes a remarkably complex assortment of dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, hazelnuts, molasses, brown sugar, almonds, creamy vanilla, bourbon, oak, and some dry biscuity malts. The flavors really astounded me on this beer. The mouthfeel was also fantastic, as it was quite thick and creamy. I thought it was very reminiscent of regular BCBS, but I actually strongly prefer Evil Twin's rendition. I thought it had a bit more complexity with its nutty biscuity character. This was one of my favorite new beers that I tried over the past year. I will certainly be seeking this out in the future. 1,032 characterslmperialChad, Feb 05, 2014

a - Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with two inches of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks great.
s - Smells of bourbon, sweet chocolate, roasted malts, oak, caramel malts, dark chocolate, toasted malts, and light toffee. Awesome nose; lots of swete bourbon and chocolate up front. Love it.
t - Tastes of bourbon, sweet milk chocolate, roasted malts, toasted malts, coconut, oak, burnt malts, light dark chocolate, cream, light coffee, and caramel malts. A slight step up from the nose; really great. 
m - Medium to full body and moderate carbonation; body is somewhat thick. The tiniest bit of heat but not bad at all. Awesome.
o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer; I love the normal version and this is probably a little bit better. The bourbon is fantastic with this beer and it doesn't dominate it too much, though it is there up front. Top notch, hope I can pick up bottles of this sometime. 1,100 charactersmdfb79, Feb 03, 2014

A: Pitch-black pour with a tall and super dense dark brown head. Looks just perfect. Head fades slowly with great retention. Only real downside is that the lacing is minimal to none.
S: Great bourbon aroma. Thick caramel and toasted sugar. A bit of a butterscotch aroma. Mild chocolate and nuttiness but just barely, under the bourbon aroma. Light overtones of oak.
T: Huge sweet bourbon notes. Oh man, this comes together nicely. Loads of caramel, butterscotch, chocolate and vanilla all combine into some delicious syrupy concoction. Oakiness kicks in afterwards with a little bit of dryness to balance. A bit of nuttiness joins chocolate in the aftertaste with just a hint of oak still lingering behind. 
M: Big, heavy, syrupy sweet. Low carbonation contributes to the heaviness.
O: Yikes. One of the finest bourbon barrel stouts ever. Flavors are big and sweet. Complex and balanced. Heavy but not cloying (but borderline, very borderline). Little to no booziness despite 11.5% ABV and barrel aging (probably due to the huge sweetness). A serious brew with serious strengths. Well crafted and delicious.
My only real nitpickiness is that it is truly heavy and sweet, almost overly so. I enjoy this type of beer considerably, but I do admit that it taxes the drinkability factor a bit. 1,341 charactersDope, Feb 02, 2014

Pours a nice creamy mocha colored 1/2 finger rich thick head that fades at a med pace, little lacing with long legs, pitch black beer with no light getting through. 
Nose yeah that's bourbon, tons of bourbon over the top that just blankets the beer, some vanilla barrel notes too, then base beer with big dark choc and cocoa, nice caramel and toffee, buttery biscotti like, very nice vanilla bourbon oak. 
Taste is quite nice, big base beer, dark choc and cocoa, creamy milk semi sweet choc, rich and creamy, mild caramel and toffee with hint of nutty buttery biscotti. All that wrapped in a great barrel character, lots of vanilla and bourbon, oak, smooth vanilla. Hint of earthy bitter hops, and hint of warming booze, but both smoothed by nice barrel. Finish is long lingering cocoa dust, dark choc, vanilla barrel and mild bourbon, little booze sticky feel. 
Mouth is nice too, fairly thick and heavy, creamy rich, nice creamy, mild booze. 
Overall awesome, base beer is mostly intact with great bourbon and vanilla, very smooth, tasty. 1,072 charactersjlindros, Jan 26, 2014

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a very nice deep black hue with a half finger mocha head that fades rather quickly to leave nice lacing and nice thin blanket.
S - Aromas of bourbon, so much bourbon, with nice chocolate, vanilla, roast malts, light almonds, faint sweetness. Really pleasant.
T - Taste is really sweet vanilla, barrel, wood, caramel, bourbon richness, light nuttiness. Super rich and decadent, this is a great dessert beer and even with some light toffee. Alcohol is hidden to a certain degree.
M - Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, silky, light alcohol notes.
O - Overall this beer was very well executed, the bourbon adds a wonderful richness and roundness to the beer. Well done, worth the price. 743 charactersrudzud, Jan 24, 2014

Pours a dense pitch black. 2 finger dark, thick mocha colored head with great retention. Lacing is thick and layered with excellent stick. Huge, oily legs too. Quite the looker. 
Nose is chocolate, cocoa, fudge, brownie, vanilla, molasses and booze. A slight hazelnut sweetness too. Deep and robust. Outstanding.
Opens chocolate, roasted malt, cocoa powder, fudge and brownie. Molasses, hazelnut and a hint of booze and leather in the middle. Ends more molasses and fudge with a sweet, syrupy aftertaste. Huge sweetness with a booze presence that lingers smoothly in the background. Awesome!
Full bodied with low carbonation. Slick, chewy, and oily in the mouth and warm and hot going down. Messy finish with a lingering, filmy aftertaste. Fantastic and hides the ABVs very well. 
This is the one variant of Imperial Biscotti Break that I can confidently say is better than the original. An almost perfect beer. Definitely worth the price and well worth seeking out. 1,033 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 23, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from 22oz bottle into chilled Shaker pint glass. Deep dark color, solid 1-finger head with lots of tiny bubbles, which dissipated relatively quickly. Thick uniform lacing which receded in somewhat short order (i.e., not real sticky). On the nose, enchanting chocolate syrup/licorice scents dominate, with no obvious alcohol present. On the palate, first taste evokes caramel/coffee/dark chocolate sensation, followed by hints of vanilla, cinnamon, and more dark chocolate. Alcohol with bourbon character is present, but not overwhelming -- indeed, rather subtle and deliciously smooth touch. Reminds me of BCBS, but more full/chewy mouthfeel. Speaking of which...the mouthfeel on this is more satisfying than many stouts of similar ilk -- perhaps because the heat of the alcohol is so well balanced with charm of the flavor profile that all of the gustatory and olfactory senses are mesmerized simultaneously, paralyzed by the perception of an entire symphony orchestra of savor bombs exploding on the gums all at the same time. Somebody needs to bottle this shit up and sell it to the huddled masses...oh wait, that is exactly what Evil Twin has done. Fan-tab-u-fucking-licious!!! 1,188 charactersJohnParadee, Jan 20, 2014

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked up a bottle at Belmont Station a few weeks back. The beer was enjoyed at a gathering of friends at an BA impy stout tasting.
The beer pours a blackish brown color with very good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer looks great, but it smelled and tasted even better. On the nose, there is the textbook imperial biscotti break nose, but with considerable bourbon present as well. The chocolate, vanilla, light licorise, cherry and cookie dough blend perfectly with the bourbon aroma in this beer. On the palate... I thought some of the participants at the tasting were going to swoon when they got this beer. One of the most hedonistic beers I've ever tasted, the flavor profile replicates the nose, but the soft, creamy consistentcy blends the flavors togetther so, so well in this excellent beer. The bourbon is actually more noticeable on the nose than on the palate, but regardless, it makes for a seamless package on the palate with this delicious beer. Mouthfeel is full, soft, creamy, and very, very long with a chocolate and cookie dough kiss on the finish. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile... you can tell it's certainly up there, but it was far less intrusive than the abv. was in some of the eclipse and BCBS variants we sampled as well. 
An absolute tour de force by Evil Twin, this beer is amazing and absolutely delicious. This is a beer I will buy every time I see it on the shelf. Excellent stuff. 1,456 charactersJohn_M, Jan 09, 2014

Served in a snifter
The beer poured a dark brown/black. Thick but not super viscous. A dense, creamy, saddle brown crown topped the liquid and quickly dissolved to a lasting collar. Spotty streaks of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was outstanding. Rich, chocolate fudge-like notes leapt from the glass. Tons of fresh vanilla bean. Sweet and rich with indications of brown sugar. Loads of freshly brewed coffee and and bourbon came through as well. Strong dark fruit notes. Raisins and plums were most apparent. As the beer warmed, the vanilla notes really took over. Amazingly sweet and fragrant.
All in all, phenomenal.
The flavor profile was nearly as intense as the aroma. Roasted and caramel malts appeared on the front end. There was a rich, brown sugar-like sweetness as well. Tons of vanilla. Lots of dark roast coffee, dark fruits and powdered cocoa. Again, rich raisiny notes came through strong. Good amount of bourbon - just enough to keep from overwhelming all the other subtle flavors in the beer. The finish was roasty, oaky, and somewhat tannic and contained a welcomed amount of alcohol heat. With time, the beer became substantially boozier.
The beer was full bodied on the palate. Super creamy, frothy and slick. Almost oily. The liquid contained a fine, tongue blanketing effervescence.
I remember trying the original Imperial Biscotti Break last year and not being too impressed with it. Even though the bourbon barrel aging only played a moderate role in this beer, it seemed to contribute a lot of complexity and ton of vanilla notes. Despite the significantly higher price tag (I paid $25 for my bottle), this beer was well worth it. 1,764 charactersDamian, Jan 03, 2014

Color- Motor Oil Black
Head- Roughly 1.5 Fingers of espresso colored foam with rapid thinning
Aroma- Sweet Malt, Milk Chocolate, Caramel, Butter Scotch, with a faint Booze Backbone
Body- Full, Thick, Slick, Creamy, Goes down rather smoothly
Taste- Quite Similar to the Aroma.
Overall- The best BBA Imperial Stout I've enjoyed to date. As a comparison I personally rate this slightly higher than GI BCB Coffee Stout. I feel this beer blends the added element of Bourbon Booze a hint better than any other BBA offering out there. Definitely worth the $26 at the local bottle shop. Will eagerly seek out again next year if released. 658 charactersoldmankoch, Jan 01, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75With the perfection in succulence, decadence, sultry and smoothness of the standard Imperial Biscotti Break, here comes and even more elevated stout to rival the top spots on all the message boards. Simply put, they but more awesomeness into the Bourbon Barrel Aged version!
Opening with even darker hues, this barrel-infused stout is mocha and chocolate even to the eye. The dark ale allows for a patient rise of latte-tan foam to cap the beer confidently and with stubborn retention. The ale trails with a coat of lace, giving an unmistakable milkshake appearance.
Succulent aromas are a balanced medley of chocolate, coffee and sweet bourbon. If not for the bourbon, the beer's scent is straigh-up of coffeehouses. Bold sweetness of burnt caramel, roasted barley, toasted hazelnuts, vanilla and oak all swirl to captivate the olfactory senses.
Decadent cream flavors are dense and full. But its the taste of mocha and bourbon that leads the way. The blend of espresso, bittersweet chocolate and sweet bourbon play out from the initial sip 'til its long and savory finish. All the while, this lavish stout picks up even more wood caramelization, brown sugar, oak spice and vanilla sweetness early on the tongue, then provides a heavy whipping cream and bourbon-soaked middle palate before turning to burnt toast, brownie, fudge and smooth coffee bitterness to finish.
Like silk on the palate, the beer invades every nook and cranny of the mouth with a dense sheet of velvety sweetness. Bourbon warmth eases the dense texture as the dry roasted malt ushers in a malty-dry culmination in its deep aftertaste.
Its a sublime stout that nearly wins the battle with each and every flavor that's common to the style. But without actually taking that award, its balance and high level of perfection is highly acclaimed. To expect Stout to somehow be better is simply unreasonable. 1,879 charactersBEERchitect, Dec 27, 2013

Reviewed live. Expectations are extremely high; I loved imperial biscotti break. 11.5% ABV confirmed. 2013 vintage. Reviewed as an imperial stout because the label clearly identifies it as such. 
Served cold – straight from the fridge and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
Paired with biscotti.
A: No bubble show forms as it’s poured. 
Pours a half finger wide head of gorgeous khaki colour. Good thickness and creaminess. Smooth consistency. Soft complexion.
Body colour is an opaque dark solid black. No floating yeast particles are visible. 
Overall, it’s a very respectable appearance for the style. I’m really looking forward to trying it. 
Sm: Coffee/java/espresso, chocolate malt, dark malts, dark chocolate, light cream, caramel, cream, chocolate milk, and faint roasted barley. 
No alcohol, hop character, or yeast character comes through. 
T: Dark malts, caramel, chocolate malts, dark chocolate, luscious milk chocolate, vague light coffee/espresso, bourbon (great vanilla and oak), biscotti - sure, and light wood. 
Alcohol is buried. No yeast character or hop character. 
Extremely balanced. Build is gestalt, with few flaws. Great depth of flavour. Ideal duration and intensity of flavour. Fantastic complexity and subtlety. A nuanced and intricate brew. Incredibly tasty. 
Mf: Smooth, wet, and creamy. Great presence and body. Perfect weight on the palate. Very soft. Almost delicate. Feels custom-tailored to the flavour profile. 
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, or rough. 
Dr: I'd definitely get it again. Great stuff from Evil Twin - maybe his best work. Incredible execution. As McDonald's would say, I'm lovin' it. I'm very impressed. He's giving Mikkel a run for his money in classic Evil Twin fashion. Very drinkable stuff. I could easily kill a bottle of this alone.

M- Thick, fairly creamy, big.

S- Chocolate chip cookies and a bit of caramel and molasses, and just a little bourbon and oak. Smells like a chocolatey dessert.
T- Chocolate, sweet coffee, caramel and oak with some strong vanilla and alcohol rounding it all out. A pretty bold beer, but there are no harsh flavors.
M- Full bodied and smooth. Lower carbonation. A little burn from the alcohol, but it's not bad.
O- Really reminded me of GI Bourbon County at first, but not quite as much as I continued to drink. It's a little lighter on the barrel presence. If you are a fan of Bourbon County, you will like this though, as it is quite similar in flavor profile. Very expensive, but would buy again on occasion. Much better than the Imperial Biscotti Break Natale. 833 charactersTK5150, Dec 21, 2013

Crap tons of caramel and vanilla. Lots of barrel. Coco nibs galore. 
An overwhelming amount of healthy whiskey, just fantastic. Super dark dry roasted chocolate without burring the coffee flavors totally. Zero off-putting flavors; ie. anise. The whiskey flavors are some of the most amazing i've ever pulled out of a beer without artificially enhancing a beer... Carbonation is very low, prickly, and much appreciated. Zero over done sweetness, calm and relaxed bitter bite. Chewy, well blended, complex, smooth, sippin' beer. 
Hands-down one of the most overwhelming beers I've ever had. A smoking-hot delicious take on the regular IBB... Give me this beer over and over again. I Could drink this for the rest of my life.

Served in a snifter at about 60 degrees. Purchased the bottle for $45 at Grand Central
A: pours out a motor oil completely opaque black. Pours with a rather vigorous head that is milk chocolate in color and is comprised of very fine bubbles which begin to fizz away and dissipate rapidly. Leaves scattered lacing around the glass
S: the smell is very multidimensional. It begins with a deep sweetness like that of real maple syrup but just a little deeper. Then comes in the expected bourbon notes of woods and mainly booze. There is an underlying sweetness that is reminiscent of dr. Pepper. Pretty minimal on malt sweetness just because it is such a big beer
T: the first thing you get in the taste is the sweetness I had mentioned before. The bourbon comes in next where is is backed up pretty strongly by woody and slightly smoky flavors. There is a lingering taste in the mouth of bourbon, not necessarily bourbon of the highest quality but I would almost equate it to the aftertaste from a shot of Jameson.
M: this is where I feel this beer falls short. It's an overall slick mouthfeel with a bit of substance. I know with beers this high in ABV mouthfeel sometimes falls by the wayside but I've had plenty of imperial stouts with more substance to them than this. I would like a bit of a creamier and thicker mouthfeel. There is absolutely no alcohol burn which, I must admit, is nice.
O: it's a decent enough beer but, after all the hype I've heard surrounding the original biscotti break, I had much higher expectations. Would I pay $45 for this again? Not a chance in hell. Would I pay $15? Yes, and that's about as high as I would go. If you've got the pocketbook to buy a beer like this, pass it up and buy multiple $15 bottles instead, you'll be much happier. 1,874 charactersBigPlay1824, Dec 14, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Pours up a good amount of head which has some retention. The head is a very dark beige that is almost purplish while the body is an opaque, dark chocolate black. There are a few spots of lacing at the moment.
Lacing is minimal. 
Nose- Amazing. This is what I've come to expect from Evil Twin. The aroma almost overloads me. Starts off with faint hints of bourbon and oak plus coconut which transition into vanilla and caramel. Some toffee or even just a basic buttery note. Chocolate that builds into fudge brownie. Tootsie roll, even. Swirling shows a tiny amount of cherry. Coconut builds after a while. 
Taste- So much chocolate in the middle, it seems to radiate outward. Very deep chocolate that moves into espresso and light bourbon notes. This is incredibly sweet and incredibly rich. Light heavy cacao, dark chocolate note with some espresso at the top of the back of my throat. Slight notes of bourbon on the front but I think that this beer might be too big, too desert for noticeable barrel aging. Some heat and a little bit of fruity sweetness, some cherry. Very tasty but it seems to lack a little complexity. This isn't too much of a complaint because a beer this good doesn't need to have much to be thoroughly enjoyable. Slight oak kick back. Light raisins. I really need to drink Imperial Biscotti Break again to get a sense of the differences. As my memory serves me at the moment, they seem fairly similar. Seems to be getting hotter- perhaps the slight bourbon notes suggest heat. Really good beer, nevertheless. Some notes of caramel and toffee show up after a while. And there isn't a suggestion of heat- the heat is real. My cursory notes of the original seem to confirm that. 
Mouthfeel- Just a little bit less than heavy if that. Thick and rich. Practically meaty. I love it. I wish I could have this mouthfeel more often. Natale does not have it, not sure about regular Biscotti. 
Drinkability- I'm scared of how fast I might drink this. The Con: This is 24 bucks and it's 8 bucks more than the original and not much different. Enjoyable as all hell though. 
Overall- Really good beer that could be great if barrel aging had delivered more. I honestly think this beer is too big for it but it might be amazing in two years. Don't think I want to spend 24 more dollars to find out if that is true. Must try if your wallet allows it. 2,374 charactersartoolemomo, Dec 14, 2013

4.81/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Most I've ever spent on a bottle but so worth- pours a jet black into my tulip with less than a finger of mocha colored head, little retention or lacing.
Smell is delicious-smells like breakfast or desert I can't decide which. Maple, coffee, roasted malt, caramel. Lots of stuff going on but well blended and intoxicating.
Tastes ridiculously good- same stuff going on as the nose, a little more vanilla and a hint of bourbon. I wouldn't call it boozy but you know you're not drinking Guinness. Rich, complex, masterfully balanced. Perfect.
Mouthfeel is smooth rich full-bodied, slightly carbonated. This is a fucking amazing beer- so glad I got the last bottle at whole foods. This is not a balls to the wall huge dark beastly imperial stout. This is a cultured, refined, royal imperial stout. BAs- buy it if you can! 821 charactersHopdaemon39, Dec 09, 2013
4.06/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours out with a fudge brown colored liquid; even with a hard pour, not much head is raised and the bubbles quickly pop and fade; quite leggy, however, with streaks of mocha dots line the chalice
Smell: Dark chocolate, coffee, toasted almond, oak, vanilla and Bourbon
Taste: Very roasty, with chocolate and coffee flavors dominant, up front; in the middle, the Bourbon barrel adds another dimension, bringing vanilla and oak; the almond "Biscotti" arrives, after the swallow, bringing with it a sweeter edge that lingers into the finish; boozy and big
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation; warmth in the gullet
Overall: Of the three in this series that I have tried so far, I prefer the lighter bodied cherry version; this one is big and bold and will take some time to mellow out; a good beer but not worth anywhere near the price it commands at the bottle shop 897 charactersbrentk56, Dec 08, 2013
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2522oz bottle from the recent 2013 release, poured into a Darkness goblet last night, 12/7/2013.
Pours a oily black body, not super viscous appearing but is quite opaque. Minimal mocha head, not much retention nor lacing.
Nose is sweet milk chocolate, coffee that's somewhere between fresh and stale, baked almonds and a generous amount of barrel vanilla. Phenomenal. Not much of oak barrel in the nose. The vanilla is a winner here. 
Flavour profile is fairly nutty, with a nice bit of cocoa and coffee bitterness. It does resemble a piece of biscotti dipped in bourbon first and then dipped in dark chocolate. Quite a bit less vanilla flavours than in the nose. Overall profile is something that I haven't tasted in a lot of other barrel-aged stouts.. not necessarily better, but certainly different.
Decent body- medium-full bodied biased towards medium, enough carbonation to enjoy the beer. Sipper because of the flavours, but not because of any heat- its not hot at all.
Enjoyable, interesting BA stout. Its worth trying once especially if you're a fan of the regular IBB. 1,081 charactersStevedore, Dec 08, 2013

Pours dark. Yep. 
Smells dark and boozy. Lots of chocolate, coffee, bourbon and cologne. More burny than anything, and while it packs a mighty and enjoyable wallop there's no real defining trait that sets it apart from the approximately 35,000 other high ABV barrel-aged stouts that have recently flooded the market.
Tastes, very near the same. A nicely intense rush of several degrees of blackness. But, again, nothing you can really hang your hat on. It's still very enjoyable and very competently brewed, though. 726 charactersmynie, Dec 03, 2013

4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: ink poured into a snifter; center-pour barely produced a pinkie of mocha head which quickly slipped away; oily-looking sheen inside the glass
S: roasty dark malts calling out notes of chocolate syrup and cocoa over which wafted airs of oak wood and bourbon whiskey, bringing vanilla and caramel notes along with it
T: rich but mellow bittersweet chocolaty malt body; some hints at musky herbs and black coffee; smooth and airy bourbon caresses the palate with vanilla caramel and lighter notes of wood and whiskey
M: slick, sticky, smooth; wet up front, drying finish; not syrupy but full-bodied; bourbon vapors graze the roof of the mouth
O: another well-done bourbon barrel stout - it seems fair to say that if the base beer is any good, as far as stouts go at least, a bourbon-ization of it will only improve the ale - this is not as sweet or syrupy as a BCBS, for example, but a more subdued and drier interpretation of the style. Not a beer to be passed up on, and possibly soon to be a "whale" for those that crave such beers. 1,039 charactersGreywulfken, Dec 02, 2013

Appearance - Black with a nice khaki head. Reddish tinge at the edges. 
Smell - Light bourbon, but nice. Oak. Lots of chocolate. Coffee. 
Taste - Coffee is stronger. Lots of chocolate. Bourbon blends nicely. Bitter and roasty in the finish. 
Mouthfeel - Bitter and roasty. Medium body.
Overall - Really nice. The bourbon barrel, to its credit, doesn't mask the great flavors of the base. 430 charactersAlieniloquium, Nov 26, 2013

A. Poured dark black. A finger light amber head that slowly retreats to a uber thick fine bubble film. Very silky and stable film. Moderate viscosity. Excellent lacing. 
S. A mild fragrance of bourbon soaked oak, dark roasted malts, vanilla, biscotti (power of persuasion), and semi-sweet chocolate. 
T. Follows the nose nicely on a ridge of sweet and bitter. A balance of chocolate and bourbon. Actually a lot of minor notes: vanilla, toffee, tannins, cookies, marshmallows, roasted hazelnuts, and spices. The mellow hops come through in the end. 
M. Moderate viscosity and carbonation. Full bodied. Uber smooth.
O. I love ba stouts and this is at the top of my list. Super balanced. It has all the flavors of a ba stout that tastes like a biscotti but in no way overly sweet. This is surprisingly not sweet. I'm a fan. This is a must try. 930 charactersmacher0, Nov 23, 2013

S - Awesome light smokey sweet aromas, minimal vanilla, dark chocolate. Mellow but amazing aromas. Almost marshemllowey aromas tempering the nose.
T - Super chocolatey, raisin vanilla flavors. Relatively mild, broad type flavors. Can't totally explain. Aftertaste is almost as good as the smell.
M - full bodied, not incredibly thick. So SK carbonation, the bourbon makes KT seem more carbonated than it is, an idea sipper that isn't taxing to drink 559 charactersMacQ32, Nov 16, 2013
