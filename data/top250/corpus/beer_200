4.27/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance: hazy yellow, totally opaque; it reminds me of liquified pollen or lupulin. The head is a 1/2 finger of off-white with poor retention, which is what prevents this beer's appearance from scoring higher.  
Aroma: light sweet malt and pineapple / hops. A true reflection of the flavor.
Flavor: very good. The hops produce pineapple flavors but no other tropical fruits, pine etc. No alcohol heat or flavor. The malt is light and serves only to carry the hops. Very well balanced. No one flavor dominates. 
Mouthfeel: spot on. I could drink several, but this by no way means thin. Just right.
Overall: a fine effort. Parish has mastered the hops department. However, this isn't their best (Bloom). I would buy this beer repeatedly if available. I sought this beer based on its high reviews. "Disappointed" would be too strong a word to describe my opinion of this beer; it is very good, but not as good as its consensus score. Absolutely try it, though, if given the opportunity. 990 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Feb 25, 2017

*** THIS  IS WITH THE NEW YEAST***
Appear: Gorgeous dark orange hazy goodness.  awesome carbonation considering almost 60 days. had abt a fingers worth of head half of which is lingering.  
Nose: soon as I popped the cap got some nice citrus notes.  the biscuit malt note is bigger than alot of other IPA's I've had lately.  nice dankness earthy MJ smell the fruits are a little more subtle.  
Taste:  Citrus and tropical fruits but for this one there's alot of hop bitterness peppery piney.  the balance is nicely done though.  
Mouth:  nice mouthfeel medium.  slight booze note that goes with the hops on the after taste.  
Over:  so nicely balanced.  maybe even a little malt heavy which for so many IPAs especially ones trying to be hazy never happens.  I'm really digging this.  I"m gonna have to try and get more up here to D.C.  I'm really impressed with my home state boys. 958 charactersGumbo_gravy, Feb 24, 2017

L - Hazy, dark golden orange, like a low sunset
S - Tons of citrus, pine, funk, lingers for a bit.
T - Citrus / grapefruit, which morphs into resin, which morphs into a little bit of bite. Very layered.
F - Velvety and smooth, one could easily chug this beer though that would be a waste.
O - This was my first time tasting this beer, though I have heard about it for a couple of years. I do not particularly like IPAs on the reg, but this may change my mind about that if it doesn't kill my taste buds. I followed this with a HOPSlam and keep going back and forth on which one I like better. 607 charactersQnola1111, Feb 01, 2017

4.13/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412oz bottle, manifested on 11.15.16, poured into a Three Floyds Eye of the Beholder Pint Glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a nice golden blonde color, light haze, foamy, white head, two fingers tall with great retention and loads of soapy lace. The aroma is great, super resinous and piney, soappy, green and earthy with grassy and weedy hops, grapefruit peel, hop spice with a touch of cereal grains. Super bitter, super resinous, really intense west coast IPA. The flavors echo the nose, booming with hops, piney and super bitter, hop spice, sap, resinous everything, dank and grassy with a bit of citrus and rind character light cereal grains, but this is just booming with classic west coast hop intensity. The mouthfeel is good, coating medium body, bone dry, moderate carbonation and a very crisp finish.
Verdict: A very good DIPA from Parish, my first experience with them and certainly not my last. Super bitter, bursting with flavor and hoppy goodness. A great take on the classic west coast interpretation of this beer. 1,071 characterskevanb, Jan 14, 2017

Aroma is dank and vegetal. There is some citrus hiding somewhere, but mostly overwhelmed by the dank herbal notes. Taste is dank and herbal as well with lots of malt, ripe orange, grapefruit pith. Taste is messy and muddled. Does not taste fresh. Mouth feel isn't bad, but its a little flat. Much preferred other IPAs I received in the same box like Bloom and Crowd Control. Need to try another batch of this. 502 charactersdanh53, Dec 13, 2016

The aroma pops of resiny pine, mango, tangerine, ripe zesty grapefruit, a biscuity sweetness, papaya.
The flavor follows with mango, tangerine, sweet grapefruit, onto green herbs and piney bitterness. There's a creamy biscuity sweet malt that support the beer as it quickly transitions to wonderfully dry and elegantly bitter resiny finish. 403 charactersdar482, Dec 12, 2016

Very nice bronze color, see-through appearance with some sediment and a short but lasting head. Smell hit me when I popped open the 12 oz. bottle but it really explodes once poured. Citrus smorgasbord on the nose! A little dank and floral but its all about the orange and grapefruit here. Taste follows nose with pineapple and stone-fruit in the mix. Soft up front and ending dry, the sip is very balanced in flavor and feel. This is a world class DIPA that is most definitely worthy of the hype. 548 charactersbarsonthetrak, Nov 27, 2016

Flavor is fairly resiny throughout, the dominant note. Malt sweetness is light and accents the fairly bitter, grassy finish well. Notes of grapefruit and muddled tropical fruit are less intense than in the aroma. Tasty, but I was hoping for more fruity hop flavoring. 381 charactersbarczar, Sep 14, 2016

Nose is fantastic with tropical, juicy fruit and herbal hop aromas. Malt is solidly there with biscuit and wet grain.
Hoppy little booger, with both hop flavor and bitterness being show stoppers. The way it flows from front to back is awesome with a malty middle and dry finish despite some sweetness popping in for a visit. Malts are honeyed white bread and the hops seem to pull from all over the globe with old world leafyness mingling with tropical flavors and even some piney NW hops. Mouthfeel is supurb, as it finishes clean and really feels smooth all the way. 731 characterstwiggamortis420, Sep 09, 2016

Taste: a thick chewy malt note hits right upfront followed in the middle by a good amount of grapefruit peel bitterness orange tangerine followed by some tropical fruit notes mango a big sweet candied peach (peach rings) more malt sweetness finishes with some more bitterness to balance out the sweetness you get throughout and a bitter green note lingers in the finish.
Feel: thick and chewy full bodied.
Overall: This is a big beer super thick and chewy a big malt backbone that is balanced out quite well with the bitterness. Still slightly more on the sweet side then bitter. The 97 rating is appropriate for this beer it's world class! 727 charactersMasonz223, Aug 13, 2016

Even a month later the juicy factor holds up fairly well.  I know it doesn't pour the prettiest, but it presents very similar to many of the other unfiltered East Coast DIPA's; cloudy and slightly orange.  While the malts come out more after a month, Ghost still has a great taste and slight juicy feel to it.  Not astringent.  Everyone should try this beer at least oh, say, four times a month. 465 charactersmcvick, Jun 18, 2016

4.31/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25If American hops have commonly carried the mere suggestions of citrus and tropical fruit flavors, then these newer, sexier, juicier hops don't simply suggest fruit, but they nearly overwhelm with them!
Ghost In The Machine is one of these- starting with a muddled haze that saturates with golden and light amber hues. Crowned with a creamy lather of white foam, the aromas tease the senses with the radiant juiciness of red grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, mango and passionfruit. Herbal and grassy, the scent soon carries over to an early palate sweetness of caramel, honey and poundcake.
As the taste develops, the ale slowly trends to a drying finish, laying down a trail of tantilizing citrus, tropical and orchard fruit in its wake. Kiwi, papaya, melon, lemon, lime, apple and apricot complete the fruit-forward portrayal as the beer's hopcentric grassiness begins to rise. Fresh grass clippings, freshly shaven pine and hints of basil and mint pull from the hop's chlorophyl and create a smooth bitterness to out-duel the malt sweetness late.
Medium-full on the palate, the ale's charming roundness of cream-sickle seems to retain its maltiness well to offer a firm counterpart to the hops. Both ride off into the finish with a gentle hop grip in the throat that slimly outlasts the candied malt. 1,309 charactersBEERchitect, May 11, 2016

4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to NolaHopHead for the trade on this one. Pours a deep orange-gold with one finger of creamy off-white head that holds a dense collar with patches of oily lacing. Hazy. Turbid. Beautiful. I can appreciate a nice clear IPA, but I have to admit, there's something about these murky masterpieces that really butters my biscuit.
So much going on in the nose. A wide array of fruits--mango, grapefruit, lemon, and nectarine are most prominent. There's also a substantial dankness of earthy grass with fleeting hints of onion, garlic, and cat piss. It's an olfactory smorgasboard, and it works beautifully for me.
Taste follows the aroma closely. Notes of sweet tropical fruits and bitter citrus peel intermingle with herbal grassy pine and garlic. I've had a couple IPA's where this onion/garlic profile completely ruined it for me. Not the case here. It's faint and strictly an accent that never steps to the forefront. The malt profile is relatively unnoticeable, and comes across as very light, slightly biscuity with just a touch of caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, with lower carbonation that makes for a silky, slightly creamy feel. The bitterness is there, but not overdone, and it finishes with a pleasant juicy feel.
With the raging flood of IPA's on shelves these days, it's rare that one is able to truly wow me. This one did. Get it if you can. 1,373 charactersglass_house, Apr 29, 2016

Smell is pretty tropical and dank. Tropical notes include plenty mango and orange. Some papaya and pineapple. Some kind of malty sweetness creeps through. Floral as well, some danky marijuana scent.
Taste is initially that malty sweetness, plenty juice and tangerine and mango flavors. Some tart and citrusy flavors come through at the end, along with the hoppy dank you get in the nose
Excellent brew, lives up to the hype of those hazy NE beers everyone is ISO. 546 charactersMateo2699, Mar 27, 2016

Full strength aroma, very complex, I get sweet grapefruit, mango, orange zest, neutral sweet, weed, and merest hints of floral and herbal bitter.  Fucking delicious aroma.
Add a finish that has some more herbal bitter and a touch of pine to all the flavors of the aroma and you have this baby's taste profile nailed.  Bright, clean flavors add up to a delicious taste that has a perfect semi-juicy end.
Light drinking full bodied low carb excellent finish delicious linger perfection here.  This is the feel for big IPA's that frames the hops sooooo well!.
Holy shit is this good.  Gone are the days that the best beers from Louisiana were the meh beers of Abita and Tin Roof.  This. Beer. Rocks.  Highest recommendation. 854 characterscavedave, Mar 13, 2016

4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Based on the look, smell, and previous ratings I thought this would be a home run instead it's just another good IPA that depends on the batch?
Looks great.  Not that much lacing.  But a great orange color.
The smell is a strong citrus blast to the face.
The taste was good initially but you get a strong alcohol aftertaste in the back end.  As it warms up you can get a slight garlic/onion taste but it wasn't as bad as the Trillium Artaic I had was.  Flavors come and go in an instant with this beer.
Feel was watery.  Easily the worst part of this beer was the mouth feel.
Overall this beer was really good BUT there are others out there in the northeast that blow this away. 679 charactersBEEPOP, Mar 12, 2016

Taste: Very very well balanced. Taste alot of mango, orange, grapefruit, and very tropical/juicy. Very slight dank, more juicy and refreshing.
Feel: Medium bodied perfect carbonation
Overall, wow. Kept up with the hype of Heady Topper and many NE hops, and like many others say, this definitely compares to it. Such a smooth and refreshing beer, and a top 5 IPA of all time in my opinion. 546 charactersmroden2699, Mar 12, 2016

Taste:  Follows suit with the smell!  Tons of onion and garlic up front, followed by some dank orange juice.  Reminds me of Gubna!

Pours a seriously murky and cloudy bright orange. Looks like orange juice. One finger off white head. Beautiful looking in he glass. Aroma combines notes of mosaic and citra. Orange, grapefruit, pine, dankness, and some stone fruit. Taste starts with a big pop of bitterness with waves of dankness and huge orange and pine from the mosaic. Very dank finish. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and the malt bill provides a nice amount of sweetness to mix with the dank. Tastes very much like the mosaic forward Dipas from Cellarmaker. A great double IPA worth seeking out. 662 charactersspark3148857, Mar 10, 2016

L = Copper, orange color.  Deep haze, barely transparent, thick foamy white head that settles into thin foamy cap.  Some lacing clings as you swirl or sip.

Manifested on 01/13/16
Served in a snifter
Hazy, golden amber appearance. The beer was capped by a creamy, inch tall mass of bright white foam that fell to a thin, bubbly cap. Later, the head morphed into a frothy collar. Tiny droplets of lacing trickled all along the glass.
The nose was hoppy but pretty straightforward. Citrus notes were apparent. Slightly floral. Touch of malty sweetness. As the beer sat, the aroma opened up more. Peach and apricot came forth. Really zesty and bright. Fresh orange notes were also quite apparent.
The flavor profile was much more punchy and intense. Loads of citrus. Juicy orange and orange peel notes dominated. Crisp and zesty. The beer was anchored by a fairly sweet yet unobtrusive malty backbone. Just enough sweetness to balance out the hoppy bitterness. Subtle peach notes. Touch of honey. Slightly tart and lemony in the center. The beer finished with notes of ruby red grapefruit, pine sap and some rind-like pithy bitterness. All in all, fantastically flavorful and well balanced.
Outstanding mouthfeel. The beer was super creamy and smooth. Fuller bodied for the style. The liquid frothed up on the palate and turned pillowy soft. Amazingly supple.
Ghost In The Machine is a fantastically flavorful and immensely drinkable double IPA that straddles the territory between Northeast and West Coast styles. Nice to see a brewery from a region typically not known for their hoppy beers doing something like this so well. 1,534 charactersDamian, Feb 14, 2016

L - bright hazy orange with off white head that dissipates fast into moderate lacing
S - Orange and mango fruit punch, with a touch of passion fruit and candied citrus rind.
T - Less citrus burst than the nose would suggest, but still lots of mandarin oranges, a touch of honey sweetness with a firm bitter finish that is drying and a touch astringent
F - medium full bodied but lightened up a touch from a slightly prickly carb.  Improved with a few swirls to knock the carb down
Overall a stunning beer - sneaky alcohol is well hidden, hops are fragrant and tropical, and malts balance perfectly - top tier DIPA that deserves your attention! 684 characterspagriley, Aug 23, 2015

Great hazy/cloudy look in the glass, an awesome aroma that hits you from the moment you open the bottle, and the taste is muy bueno. Citrusy, juicy, great mouthful, and great finish. Very close to Batch 4 from March, often described as hoppy Sunny D. Drank it by side with fresh Zombie Dust, and would hate to have to choose which one to have as my third pour.  Much better (for me) than Batch 5 484 characterslsutailgater, Aug 23, 2015

4.95/5  rDev +11%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from very fresh 12oz bottle into Spiegleu IPA glass. Bottled on date was 8-7-15.
Look: Lighter golden, slightly hazy.
Aroma: Piney, fruity, resinous. Hints of mango and or pineapple.
Taste: Very pleasantly tropical, slightly bitter. Think yellow tropical fruits.
Feel: Crisp and refreshing for a DIPA. Very easy to drink. Nice moderate body. Finished ever so slightly dry.
Overall: definitely my current favorite DIPA even *gasp* above Heady Topper though I've admittedly never had that one quite as fresh.
Bonus: The label art is sick too. 553 charactersnoladom, Aug 13, 2015
4.71/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Had at The Bulldog on Magazine St 08/10/15- the very first pour from the first keg of the year!!!!! Such a damn fine beer- very well balanced. Copper to gold color with a slightly hazy character and thick white head that settles to a thin lacing. Smell is resinous pine layered thick over some tropical fruit notes, simply perfect. Taste reminiscent of smell with hops and an added fruit kick that can best be described as reminiscent of pineapple- does a very nice job of taming the hops. Mouthfeel is slick and clean, finishes dry with a minimal linger. Overall, there aren't many beers I'll actively seek out- this is an exception, and for good reason. I've had more than my fair share of SE regional brews, and this is my vote for the best. 744 charactersRobby6308, Aug 10, 2015

A - Lighter orange gold with a 2 1.5 finger white head. Fades slowly and leaves behind delicate webbed lacing.
S - Big hop aromas with floral, tropical notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and bitter pine. It is very aromatic and kinda green and fruity. 
T - Big bitter hop profile from the hops. Plenty of grapefruit, with a sweeter pineapple part. Piney, juicy and bitter grapefruit finish. 
M - Great mouthfeel on this. It is slick and I find it to be dry. 
O - I am impressed with this IIPA. It lived up to the bitterness claims. 582 charactersRi0, May 31, 2015

A:  Bronzed golden pour, with minimal head that dissipates quickly with weak lacing.  Quite hazy and attractive.
S:  Lychee, grapefruit, pear, pine...a hop lover's wet dream.  Slight sweet malt in the background with next to no yeast character.
T:  Not sure how to really describe it.  Follows aromas, minus lychee and plus mango.  Almost like drinking candy, in a good way.  Sweet malt background sets the stage for quite a play.  Finishes heavily (but pleasantly) bitter, leaving a bit of a hop-slick feel.
M:  Slick, smooth, refreshing.  Not too carbonated.
O:  For a non-hophead in most cases, this was pretty damn good!   It had me at the smell. 741 charactersMeganomiidae, May 28, 2015

Smell:  Watered down orange juice, hops and pine, earthiness-ism.  Maybe some yeast?  Whatever that smell is, I like it.
Taste:  Wow!  Mmmmmm...That's good. 
Feel:  It fits well.  At the very, very end, there is an ending of extremely thin, silky, creamy-ish lather.
Overall - This beer nails it.  There are so many beers along the same lines these days, but this one does a jig.  Maybe it's the water.  This is an awesome Imp IPA, good stuff out of Louisiana. 642 charactersmabermud, May 23, 2015

Pours a deep, murky, golden orange with a significant frothy off white head. Settles into a film on top with a 1/4" ring around glass. 
 Smells fairly sweet with tropical fruits and pine resin along side a strong malt base. Also flowery. Kind of reminds me of a Boston Lager. Very deep, rich wort aroma. Like sticking your head in the kettle of a lager mash. One of the better smelling DIPAs I can recall. Something unique there. Very nice. 
Taste matches aromas. Sweet bready malts and fruits up front. Mango, orange, and peaches to me. Very bitter on the back end with pine. 
Feel is nice. Average carbonation and body. Lots of slick oils. 
Not for the faint of heart. It is a hop bomb. It has some great flavors and decent balance, but the hops win in the end. Great beer 807 charactersWesMantooth, Apr 18, 2015

Mouthfeel is medium, and Parish Ghost in the Machine finishes semi-dry and surprisingly drinkable for an 8.5% alcohol ale.

A:  poured into a tulip to a nice golden orange with a finger and a half of dense off white head that retains well and leaves decent lacing
S:  smells of juicy tropical fruit, caramel sweetness and pine resin
T:  taste is resinous pine, tropical fruits, citrus rind, and caramel sweetness.  swallow is a nice piney hop kick with more tropical fruits and a slight lingering sweetness
M:  this beer has a moderate amount of weight on the palate with slightly pricking carbonation.  the finish on the beer is oily and refreshing
O:  This is a great DIPA.  the complexity of flavors and hop presence are rock solid and the beer is very well made.  Definitely one to try if you like hops.  Very nice balance and the hops while prevalent aren't excessively abrasive. 784 charactersSHODriver, Feb 25, 2015

Appearance:  Pours a hazy golden with 1 finger of white head
Smell:  Piney and citrus hops 
Taste:  Really hits on the juicy, citrus notes with slight malt in the finish
Mouthfeel:  Medium but all the hop flavor gives a juicy component.
Overall:  I've had at least 4 different batches of this now.  Its very consistent.  An incredible beer from a state that is not known for DIPA.  This stands up to some of the best around the country.  There is great balance while maintaining an assaulting amount of hop flavor.  No alcohol presence. 603 charactersTuck_leepulin, Dec 07, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.5%Latest batch bottled on 11/20/2014.  Even better than I remember.  Pours a somewhere on the lighter side between golden and copper, with a 1-finger head that dissipates fairly quickly.  The aroma is intoxicating.  I could just live in there for a while.  Lots of tropical fruits, pine, and even some floral notes.  Mouthfeel is medium with just the right amount of carbonation.  Taste matches up with the aroma - lots of citrus.  Definitely a hop bomb, with just enough malt to balance it out.  I would rate this one up there with just about any DIPA currently being brewed. 574 charactersdouglasbarbin, Nov 26, 2014

Bright hoppy aroma of grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, orange and mango.  Light malt, almost wheat-like.  
Grapefruit on first sip.  Bold and juicy.  Orange.  Just a bit of bitter pine around the edges.  Light, sweet malt.  Doughy.  Slight chalkiness.  
Medium body with medium carbonation.  A bit oily with moderate bitterness.  Big grapefruit aftertaste.
Really first class DIPA.  Just the right amount of bitterness and very juicy. Malt is light but provides just enough balance. 665 charactersleroybrown10, Oct 31, 2014

Mouthfeel:  Lively carbonation.  Oily in a good way.

Getting one from the last pack in the store, it comes and goes out immediately. Thanks so much for the Beer Sommelier from Stein’s in New Orleans for not letting me go home without proving this local beauty, although they were running out of it.
Nice amber golden color with a thick thin head with short retention.
Delicious tropical aroma with notes of peaches, passion fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, American yeast, pine and mango. I could just smell it forever. On a second thought, no way, got to sip it now.
Hoppy forward flavor with notes of pine cones, grapefruit, tea bags, resin, toasted malts and spices. Dry aftertaste with a long lasting bitterness. Alcohol of 8.5% abv is well disguised.
Outstanding Double IPA from Louisiana. Superbly balanced for the style, not being overly sweet/malty with bold tropical and pine flavors and an aroma to die for. 936 charactersFLima, Sep 24, 2014

Pours a clear gold with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink. 606 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jun 04, 2014

Pours a hazy dark orange, with a one inch fizzy head and a little bit of lacing.
Smells grapefruity and piney, with a little bit of orange and honey.
The taste is pretty similar. Fairly bitter, from the grapefruit and the pine. Mostly dry, except for a little bit of honey sweetness from the malt. The hop flavor is really nice, but not overpowering.
Medium bodied, crisp dry mouthfeel, well carbonated.
A nice little surprise, have never heard of this one before. 513 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 17, 2014

Look - Pours a hazy orange amber with a sizable foamy head that retains well and leaves lots of spotty lacing.
Smell - Aroma is some grapefruit but primarily piney hoppy. Nice hop forward aroma.
Taste - Rich malt body with a piney, resiny, and then juicy fruit hop overlay. Smooth, nice variety of hops chosen here.
Mouthfeel - Heavy-medium bodied with prickly carbonation. Some malt warmth. Rests piney bitter. Quite the hop juice.

A - Perfect, exactly what I want a DIPA to look like. Hazy orange, not a clear beer.
S - The smell, my god I could live in this glass all day. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had, probably cause this is one of the freshest DIPAs I've ever had. 
T - The taste is almost as good. Very bitter upfront with a wave of grapefruit and tropical fruits following. Damn this is good. Can't taste the alcohol whatsoever. 
M - Medium body, similar to the upper tier DIPA's
O - Overall, the best beer brewed in the state by far and goes into my Top 5 DIPA list. As good as Heady? No, but can hang with it and on par with the DJs and Abrasives of the world. Better than Pliny, imo. So happy we can get this in Louisiana and a beer to call our own. 786 charactersdav3290, Feb 28, 2014
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Been anxiously awaiting this beer for nearly a year, since talking to the owner of Parish Brewing about it. It finally made its debut in mid-February, and the question remained: would it live up to the hype, or would it be just another double IPA?
Appearance: On 2/24/2014, I poured a bottle dated 2/19/2014 into a snifter glass, and it was a nice golden color with a hint of amber to it. The two fingered head quickly disappated and some lacing was apparent. The color is along the lines of what I expect in this type of beer: leaning toward a golden hue without being too amber or copper.
Smell: For me, aroma is one of the biggest measuring sticks for a beer of this style. If you call your beer a double IPA, it should pack a punch of hops on the nose. This one doesn't pack a punch; it's a full on assault of hops. Dank and juicy pine and citrus aromas jump out of the glass from the moment the beer is poured until the last sip. That's actually the most impressive part about this beer. Many of this style have a nice initial aroma that fades away as it's consumed. The aroma of this one is exactly what I want in a beer of this style.
Taste: The dank hops come through with more pine and citrus flavor, and a touch of malt presence is noticeable. However, this one is all hops. As it warms, more complex tropical fruits and even floral notes are evident. 
Mouthfeel: This is a medium bodied beer that allows the hop forward flavors to shine through. It's easy to drink for a beer that's 8.5% ABV. It's exactly what I want in this type of beer: not overly malted or heavy, and allows the hops to come to the forefront.
Overall: It's hard to say how this beer could be better. A wonderful interpretation of the style and a hop lover's dream. The hop aroma and flavor is overstated, just as it should be. This one compares favorably to the best DIPAs in the country, and it's hard to say that there is a better one in the Southeast US. This is likely the beer that puts Louisiana on the map for hopheads across the country. I'm unsure of future plans with this, as far as how often it will be brewed, but with the initial success of it, I have to believe it will be brewed on the regular.
Well done Parish, well done. 2,227 charactersTheAleRunner, Feb 26, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me preface this review by saying that hunting this beer down (it wasn't easy)was worth the effort.
Poured from 750 ml bottle into the Parish tulip.
A- Pours a beautiful clear golden amber with a two finger snow white head that recedes at a medium pace. Little to no lacing is left behind.
S- Imagine Mike Tyson in the 4th round. He is just here to get paid and you know you are not going to win. Mike is getting restless and decides to deliver a finishing blow with a right hook but his glove is made of hops. Yea... it's kinda like that. Lots of hops. Piney, with citrus and resin. Can't wait to dive in.
T- Very crisp but with the bite of the hops that leaves you wanting more. Same as the smell and almost mouth puckering in a good way.
M- Good carbonation. Medium body that has a tingling sensation that last even after the previous sip is gone.
O- Probably the best DIPA I have had. I really can't find anything wrong with Ghost In the Machine. It was really fresh and I hope that this gets 're-released again and again. Thank you Parish for giving Louisiana a DIPA to be proud of. 1,096 characterstbryan5, Feb 26, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Parish Brewing tulip
Appearance: Beautiful clear golden color, nice foamy white head that recedes to a stark white outer lacing.
Smell - Initial delicate floral and citrus hop aromas gradually give way to a piney resinous aroma with a hint of malt sweetness.
Taste - The hoppiness in this beer is up front and in your face. The beer is dominated by the presence of pine, citrus, and resinous hop flavors. The malt backbone provides just enough body and sweetness to keep this balanced. Finishes somewhat sweet with a slight grapefruit and pine ligering bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium body, medium/high carbonation. The carbonation level in this beer push those hop aromas and make them really pop. Lingering malt sweetness keeps this from being overly bitter and astringent on the pallet.
Overall - WOW! Parish Brewing Company went all out with Ghost in the Machine and aimed for the top tier of DIPAs and landed pretty damn close. Ghost in the Machine is a agressively hopped DIPA that reminds me more and more of Stone RuinTen with every sip. At 8% ABV and 150 IBU GitM is still a wonderfully balanced and drinkable DIPA that will leave the hop heads begging for more. This is a wonderful beer from Parish Brewing company and something that should make all Louisana craft fans proud and eager to see the next incarnation of this DIPA. 1,363 charactersVictory4LSU, Feb 24, 2014

No bottle on date but is from first batch back in late Feb 
A - poured a cloudy orange-amber color with a slight finger-sized cream-colored head. Not overly bubbly with a minimal lace that dissipates rather quickly. 
S - this is where this beer shines. I could get stuck with my nose in the glass and not worry about getting out! Piney hops hit you first in conjunction with that dank, resiny smell. Then, bam, citrus smacks you in the nose in the form of ripened grapefruit rinds. I also get a slight bit of floral aroma as well. Also a slight maltiness sneaks in there as well. 
T - bitterness comes through from the earliest part of the sip and lingers nicely until the end. That resiny hoppy bite follows from the nose and comes to the forefront a little more than the citrus part. Alcohol taste is hidden nicely. Hardly notice the 8.5%. 
M - light-medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is on the lower side of medium. Not overly bitter. The hoppy bitterness and the malt dance nicely together throughout the entire sip. Right when you think the bitterness is getting too far ahead of itself, the malt sweetness just sucks it away before you really notice any imbalance. 
O - after drinking this as much as I have at the Parish taproom and out of the bottle, I figured a proper review was due. Andrew, y'all really hit this one out the park, dude. Awesome balance and the hop profile really gives you a taste of each category. Easily, the best beer brewed in Louisiana! 1,498 charactersJamesStreet, Feb 22, 2014

A: Pours a nice hazy orange with two fingers of frothy white head that fades to a pretty splotchy lace.
S: Dank would sum it up. Tropical fruit galore and a wave of hops. Nice peach, mango, and bitter grapefruit come to mind. Also a beautiful piney aroma mixed with some sweet malt and hints of caramel. 
T: Gorgeously bitter bite up front is balanced with citrus fruit; grapefruit, orange, peach all hit the tongue. Pine and earth come through too and this is just a great tasting DIPA.
M: Medium bodied with fairly high bitterness that just begs you to come back for more. Well balanced hops and malt.
O: A hophead's dream and easily the best Louisiana beer ever made. First tried on tap in a plastic cup and loved it. Even better out of the bottle. Parish, please, please make this a standard, year-round beer. And please ditch the 750's for 12 oz bottles! 928 charactersMikecap, Feb 22, 2014
