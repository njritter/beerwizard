S: Fairly mellow, but some pretty nice hints of pink grapefruit, orange sherbet, powdery malt and a little mango. 
T: Just unbelievably clean. A perfect melding of light pine, mango, light malt backbone, mild kiwi and just a touch of grapefruit pith on the finish. Carbonation is feathery and just barely there. With probably any other beer it wouldn't be enough, but it's perfect in here. Love this one. 470 charactersnotchucknorris, May 03, 2017

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hazy golden yellow, medium head. Dry fruit aroma, apricot, a bit of pineapple with classic HF floral nose on it. Smells like walking through a flower patch after a summer rain. Tons of peach & pineapple upfront, mid palate brings mango and kiwi, some very faint honeysuckle and hibiscus way at the end, finishes with perfect amount of bitter hop and pineapple again. Just a wonderfully delicate citrus hop beer, like "juice" but still beer unlike some of these lactose sugar "juice bombs" out there. A standard for IPAs. A rare perfect 5 beer in my book. 554 charactersajm5108, Mar 31, 2017

Pours avery hazy orange, completely opaque.
Smell is tropical and a bit dank. Mango, with hints of pine and vanilla.
Taste is very balanced, starts off pretty soft with mango, pineapple and vanilla, then gets augmented by a nice hop hit. Rounds out very nicely, and the finish is long.
Mouthtfeel is pillowy and mouth covering, really nice.
Another reallt great beer from HF, well rounded and balanced. 442 charactersJamFuel, Mar 14, 2017

A modest bright white head that left fairly quickly but left the glass with some sturdy, splotchy laces. The nose was bright: sweet grapefruit, grassiness, mango, and a bit of blueberry. I noticed the grapefruit on the palate first. Not bracingly bitter but not "soft" either. The mid-palate was more earthy with pine, berries, grass, and dry bready malt. The finish was clean with a rising bitterness that framed the taste for me. Nice and light-feeling on the palate despite it's massive flavor, but not at all thin. A fantastic beer. 626 charactersBuck89, Mar 12, 2017

The nose is very fruity with citrus playing lead. The flavor follows the nose, definitely a juice bomb with the slightest amount of bitterness and malt. The feel is medium, decent carbonation, and a quick finish. This one has been on my list for a while and glad to finally be having it. A northeast IPA done to perfection. 417 charactersMeyers1023, Feb 13, 2017

Smells of dried orange peel, passionfruit, bright lemon pulp and lots of wet grass. This gets pleasantly accompanied by some water melon and wet hay, complimented by sugared bread crust. Produces a refreshing crispness, including a whiff of sweet ice bonbon atop of hand made lemonade - very nice on the nose.
Has a fantastic smooth mouthfeel, incredibly soft on the palate with a light body, producing a nice hop bite during the finish.
Tastes of lemon, white bread dough and a hop profile which turns frutier within each second. The hops bring kiwi, wet grass more lime and a mellow, sweet maltiness to the palate. The sweetness gets washed away during the finish by a late herbal dryness which inherits a powerful, slowly evolving lemon dryness, which stays on the tongue surprisingly long.
Very nice, supersmooth, light and crisp with a hoppy fruit profile, pleasantly accentuated by the malts, while turning utmost dry in the end. Very eventful and perfectly crafted, another impressive, thoughtfully balanced beer from this brewery, with a nice herbal addition. 1,137 charactersaleigator, Oct 28, 2016
3.5/5  rDev -21.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Currently #95 in the Top 250.
On-draught @ The Ginger Man NYC. $9/13oz.
HEAD: 2cm high. Gorgeously frothy with a wonderfully soft even consistency and a nice complexion. Smooth and creamy, leaving coating lacing on the sides of the glass as it recedes - which takes about 5 minutes (not bad).
BODY: Chill haze and nontransparent indicate a lack of filtration (which I guess the hip kids attribute to the so-called "East coast style" - though I make no such regional distinctions). Translucent but not very vibrant, coming in at a drab orange colour. No yeast or sediment is visible but I'd be reticent to call it clean looking given how hazy it is.
Well-carbonated judging by appearance. Not unique or special looking, but the unfiltered body does catch the eye a bit.
AROMA: Fresh citrus pulp is present, bending more towards classic orange instead of hip new world hop tangerine (to its benefit). Hill Farmstead's mastery as the Simcoe whisperer is paid testament here, with subtle oniony notes working their way in without rendering it in any way off-putting. Pale malts keep it balanced.
Those after oily, resinous, overtly floral, herbal, or dank hop aromatics needn't apply; this is up-the-middle citrus and onion.
Aromatic intensity is light; I had to search for what I found.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Yogurty creamsicle sherbert notes take me by surprise, showing this IPA does have a new world hop bend after all. The citrus pulp is there (though it lacks the expressiveness and depth you'd expect in a world class citra-hopped IPA), as is the subtle Simcoe onion, but the yogurt dominates, bringing cool tanginess to the table to balance out that citric acidity. I get a blip of lime in the late second act.
Creamy, smooth, wet, medium-bodied, somewhat refreshing, of fair softness, and cool.  Carbonation approaches perfection. There's a nice harmony of texture and taste, with the cool creamy vibe of the texture feeding into the yogurt tones nicely.
Bitterness/sweetness balance is good, leaning towards the malts. Some drinkers may crave more oily pungency and bitter grapefruit, and for them imbalanced expressions of the style from Green Flash, Stone, and the like will appease. For drinkers who value balance, this is a refreshing change of pace.
Depth of flavour and complexity could be improved, to nitpick. Flavour duration and intensity are merely average.
OVERALL: A well-brewed IPA, but I don't know that I'd count it amongst the top 100 beers worldwide. Certainly not the finest brew even just in Hill Farmstead's oeuvre, but more than worthwhile and I'd certainly order it again (even at its high price). Drinkable enjoyable fare with a balanced flavour and a nice uncommon hop profile.

Palate Contaminants: none
Appearance is a thick, opaque gold. It only lets a little light through.
The smell is great. It's sweet red grapefruit, peaches, and sweet plums. It's so nice and balanced.
The taste is a little bitter at first, with the hops showing some fresh peat. Then the sweet and savory elements take over. Pears are the main fruit, with white grapefruit (in a change from the nose) following up. There's a mellow malt flavor that's almost like what one gets with rice candy, or maybe it's fresh wheat. Subdued, yet flavorful; not sharp, yet fresh.
The feel is the weakest thing about it. The carbonation comes out with a swish around the mouth, but it's not prickly. The aftertaste isn't quite as well balanced as the rest. It's mostly unsweetened white grapefruit. Still, this is a great one. 844 charactersZythophile, Oct 22, 2016

A standard IPA with grapefruit, a little lemon and some piney notes.

I could smell this beer the moment it arrived. Classic grapefruit, with some pine and lemon. Taste is similar, along with a little breadiness. Decently bitter finish. Feel is just a touch thin, but wonderfully smooth and creamy. Amazing IPA, one to seek out--though like other HF beers I've had, it is more restrained and sophisticated than punch you in the mouth. 477 charactersBeers-es, Sep 02, 2016

A - Pours a hazy straw color with a small white head.

T - Flavor is similar to nose, with orange and especially pineapple notes coming thru. Finish is mild, not particularly bitter.
M - Medium mouth feel and carbonation.
O - Drank this after Harlan, and it was definitely another rung or 2 up the IPA flavor ladder.  Like every HF beer I've tasted, the balance of flavors is really impressive.  Great beer. 527 charactersspacecake9, Jul 30, 2016

Look is a nice hazy yellow with a good lacing that sticks.  
Smells like citrus and hops.  It's mellow but really inviting.
Taste follows the nose.  Such a well put together IPA.  Citrus, hops, balanced...so good.
Feel is medium bodied and hangs in the front of the mouth.
Overall a great IPA.  Love this.  I have four more Hill Farmstead beers to try.  I am a fan, that's for sure. 496 charactersJay_P22, Jul 17, 2016

Golden yellow and hazy. The aroma is of citrus and some light bready malt. Aroma is solid, but doesn't explode out of the glass. Taste is juicy and smooth with very little bitterness. As with most HF beers, the mouthfeel is soft and incredible. Nothing harsh or overwhelming about this beer at all. Just a solid, well crafted, tasty brew! 445 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 16, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Great offering from Hill Farmstead, Susan is a nice hazy orange with 2 to 3 inch head. I smell a lot of orange citrus and the taste is the same. High acidic oranges. Has soft mouthfeel and complexity of hop bitterness that emerges initially then resonates in the back end due to the trifecta of hops. Although I did feel Edward was simpler, I think that Edward edges out Susan in drinkability. To me, Susan lacked a little balance. 431 charactersTrevor11, Apr 05, 2016

4.25 A:  Well hazed light orange color.  Came with a short white head.  Good retention and lots of lattice like lacing.
4.0 S:  Resiny and grapefruit hops to start.  Then big tropical fruit - pineapple heavy - mango, and orange.  Neutral bready malts.
4.25 T:  Mild-moderate bitterness.  Light caramel and extra bready.  Sugary hops, tropical fruits per above, resin, grapefruit.
4.0 M:  Medium body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Creamy and super smooth.

Look was hazy light yellow-orange color, smell was subtle not much citrus, taste enjoyable with lingering aftertaste on back of flavor, Feel lightly carbonated light to medium mouth feel.  Overall a solid beer, as I said earlier need to give it a try on its own.
Had another- a significantly different beer than the first, not sure of the reason for the change but this thing was great, citrus, grapefruit and pineapple abound!! 554 charactersdgmirelli, Mar 01, 2016

Big aroma of dank hops, some tropical fruit, grapefruit, hints of resin. Really inviting. Taste is similar to the aroma, cracker malts first, then big hop notes until the end. Resin, fruit, herbal. Finishes a bit dry with some grapefruit pith. Overall a really great IPA from the masters at Hill Farmstead. 507 charactersBranfordBound, Feb 19, 2016

L:Signature NE IPA cloudy appearance.  Thick frothy white head, very cloud like and silky in texture.  Leaves a nice head.  Color is a brilliant orange.
S: Very citrusy with notes of tropical fruit and sweet malt, maybe a touch of floral hops found in German beers
T: Once again, tropical citrus flavors, a little peppery and floral notes, also a touch of honey and mango.  Aftertaste brings home a subtle hop bitterness, with just enough bite
F: Untouchable, like drinking liquid clouds.  Very frothy, full mouthfeel.  Creamy with a medium carbonation and a bite from the bitterness.  So balanced
O: Glad I finally got to try this, one of my favorite beers to date. 684 charactersedward_boumil, Jan 25, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5The only down side of this beer was the look, very cloudy, I think that is a flaw for this style.   The nose was almost prefect, it was like smelling hops fresh on the bine. Tropical fruits dominated, but there was a good biscuit smell from the malt.  The taste was even better than the nose, piney, then black pepper spice, then mango, and then there was a real hop bitterness.  The hop overload(in a good way) was then washed away by the residual sugars from the malt.  The mouthfeel was a bit too heavy, but I am not sure how you can carry that much flavor with anything lighter.  Overall a great beer, seek it out and you won't be disappointed. 648 charactersorsulacp, Dec 29, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5On tap at BBD's in Rocky Point, NY; pours hazy yellow gold color with a big foamy 2 finger snow white head that stuck around forever and left incredible lacing and a foamy iceberg floating on top that swirled around after each sip.
Smell and flavor are both top notch, pretty close to perfect with fresh citrus fruit/citrus hops, grapefruit and lemon zest, grassy notes, piney hops and a malty, graham cracker background to make it balanced and masterfully constructed. Real mild bitterness, it was a pleasure to take down each sip, which was simple and yet complex all at once. 
Incredibly easy to drink, an outstanding IPA as it was so tasty and refreshing at the same time that it seemed like a session IPA. Seek this out, it's that damn good.
4/15/2016-Had this again on tap at the Lark in East Northport, NY, and it was fantastic. Very fresh and hoppy smelling, but not over the top; extremely tasty with the perfect amount of bitterness and a ton of hoppy citris notes to completely hide the ABV and flow down effortlessly. Even better the 2nd time around. 1,065 charactersCHickman, Oct 13, 2015

Hazy orange color with a 1f white head. Some lacing. active rising carbonation.
Orange color leads to a citrus aroma of...oranges, as well as grapefruit and pine oil . Lots of citrus and some pale-ish malts.
Mostly malt forward flavor with citrus hop taste also. Piney.
Smooth feel with good carbonation. Hop tang, not too bitter.
Tasty and drinkable.,  quite refreshing as well. Not dank. 429 charactersNiceTaps, Oct 05, 2015

The color is mildly hazed amber with thick white head with fine bead. The smell is good with a nice mix of herbal and slight tropical hop aromas with a nice amount of citrus. The feel is great with a nice balanced bitterness level and dry finish with perfectly level carbonation. 378 charactersSlatetank, Sep 29, 2015

Great interplay of tropical fruit, citrus, bitterness, minerality. Avoids anything resinous or piney, with any plant notes being more herbal, grass and leaves. 295 charactersKurmaraja, Sep 25, 2015

T: Sticky fruits and sweet buns, herbs and a faint mineral tang. Hops up front overlaying a lightly sweet malty body, easy bitterness lingers long after the last sip. F: Creamy, chewy, absolutely perfect amount of carbonation. O: Probably as great as any beer at this abv range I've ever met.

I honestly don't feel that I have the sophistication that others have when reviewing beers because I almost 69 and age makes a difference.  I just know what I know and this is amazingly fun, tasty, complex but not so anything overpowers anything of the ingredients.  Love it.

4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Freshly poured at the Hill Farmstead brewery in VT. The appearance was almost like a grapefruit juice, but not as hazy, with a thick, one-finger head. The smell was amazing with lots of citrus aromas coupled with some pine and grapefruit in there. The taste on the palate was of sticky-hop flavors, with layers of citrus and somewhat herbal. It starts with sweetness that ends with a decent amount of crisp bitterness. Overall, this is a great offering from Hill Farmstead and a good rendition of an American IPA utilizing New Zealand hops. If you haven't already, definitely check out not only this beer but the brewery as well; awesome place, cheers! 652 characterstregan_20, Sep 21, 2015

Creamy top one finger tall bright white head, very thin bubbles in the head almost nitro looking.  Great apricot yellow and orange colored body, with a very opaque character and a nice lemon glow very shiny.
Palate has wonderful  soft tropical hop notes, slightly floral.  The hop fruit character comes off more jammy actually but also surprisingly light as well.  Very impressive.
Palate has a great chewy malt character  and touch of biscuit at first, then the mid palate really opens with citrus rind and tropical fruit.  Light mix of creamy body and almost session like easieness in mouthfeel, but not quite that light or wet which comes out more impressive.
Excellent IPA in the Farmstead cannon. 789 characterssmakawhat, Aug 08, 2015

Pours a slightly hazy orange-ish color with exceptional lacing.  The Riwaka hops must be what I'm smelling as it's unique (but pleasant) to the nose - a juicy IPA no doubt.  This is really a fantastic American IPA and provided a wonderful drinking experience overall.  Balanced and delicate fruitiness throughout, subtle dryness on the end. 395 charactersbowzer4birdie, Aug 02, 2015

Pours hazy yellow.  Smells a little grassy and very dry.  Nice balance, but a little underwhelming.
Tastes, at first, like it smells: fruit, grass, then intense, bitter dryness. But it really grows on me as it warms, with the malt aftertaste taking on a bursty fruit complexity.  Very tasty and pretty unique. 454 charactersmynie, Jul 24, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this beer twice on tap, but never from HF directly, so take that with a grain of salt.  First time was around 7/24/15 at Armsby Abbey in Worcester, MA and then again on 8/10/15 at Torst in Brooklyn.  Both times were pretty consistent in every way, but FWIW, a lot of people that tried it at Torst have agreed that it was much less hazy than they remembered and not nearly as flavorful.  It certainly didn't taste off in any way to me, and was still a way above average IPA, but not as amazing as I would have expected from HF (again, having never been to the brewery).  I will add that the Edward I had at AA was one of the best beers of the year for me hands down, but Susan just didn't hit that level (though I get the sense that it should and would have if up to quality it normally is/used to be...
Anyway, the beer was still great, so Shaun please don't stop sending barrels down to NYC again like following the RnH incident.  Instead, we need some more HF love, especially from the Ancestral series... 1,012 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Jul 24, 2015

They were both on tap when I went to the brewery and, perhaps due to me being from the West Coast and it's bit more a stark contrast to what I can get there, Abner is what filled most of my growlers with.
I got more than a couple of Susan though, and that's the beer that has really stuck with me. I can still almost taste the Abner (it's been almost half a year), but Susan is the beer that will have me making the trek back to Vermont.
It's exceptional. 534 charactersobiwan_k3n00bi, Jul 23, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Hazy orange body, short white head, and extensive lacing.
S - Huge orange and grapefruit nose, citrus hop esters galore, along with big pine complements.  If juicy IPAs are your thing, this is exactly how you want your IPA to smell.  As it warms, some of the Citra and Simcoe dankness comes forward, but it is never off-putting.
T - The nose, but more restrained, with a more subtle juice element pairing with definite resin and pine elements.  The middle introduces the malt backbone.  Most IPAs that deliver huge hop fronts close superbly bitter, but while there is a definite bitter turn, here it is more balanced, keeping the fruitiness and bright notes throughout.  Which is one neat trick.
M - Very bright and carbonated.  The close has some subtle drying, but nothing out of character for an IPA.
O - This straight ahead IPA is big and fun, delicious and bright.  Susan is a top notch IPA, and it is a testament to the careful craft of this beer that it manages it all without falling for any of the major traps that trip up even the better brewers working with these hops and profiles. 1,101 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 17, 2015

Aromas are pretty muted for me, but there is some citrus hops in the form of tropical fruit, mango maybe?, and pale malts. 
Excellent tasting, even if a little bit on the flat side. Orange, peach, and slight pineapple flavors. Kind of ripe and a little bit funky with a hint of spice (rye like). Balanced nicely with the malts. Average to below average bitterness. 
The body is silky smooth. A little crisp in the carbonation unless I am mistaking it for a farmhouse type yeast pitch. 
An excellent IPA. Not world class for me though. I think I may score it a little higher as a pale, but a very good beer either way. I think it reminds me of Pseudo Sue. 807 charactersWesMantooth, Jun 26, 2015

A: Hazy, medium orange with golden honey - pours with a dense, bright white head, fades to a nearly solid cap, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: Bright, fresh citrus, with gigantic floral notes - orange, grapefruit, and ruby red grapefruit flesh - nice tropical aromas, big mango and pineapple - straight-up hops, hop cones, hop pellets - very, very floral
T: It's a Hill Farmstead IPA; very hoppy with an immaculately clean malt base - juicy, fleshy, ripe orange, tangerine, grapefruit - very, very floral - some hints of pine, straight-up hop resin - very nice tropical notes, with mango and pineapple - some stone fruit, peach - tropical fruit juice - medium level of bitterness - clean pale malt base, fresh and refreshing
M: Medium body, very smooth, finishes lightly dry
O: Possibly the quintessential Hill Farmstead IPA
Hill Farmstead makes awesome pale ales. Their APAs, IPAs, and DIPAs have many similarities. It's like a spectrum. And Susan is right in the middle. Very hoppy, but not aggressively so, super clean, and stupidly easy to drink. Awesome stuff. 1,137 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 06, 2015
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Hazy yellow hold. Looks like almost every other Hill Farmstead pale ale. Head is white, fluffy, and dense. Drops to a few clumps of a cap with a small creamy collar. Sheets and splotches of lacing. 
Smell: Pine and some tropical notes. Touches of tangerine. Hill Farmstead yeast and water add a very soft earthiness. Malt backbone is ever so slightly bready with some pale malt sweetness as well. Lots of pine sap and grapefruit. Bitter. Floral. Woody. Slightly sweet. Warming adds a little bit of mango and peach. Some hop spiciness as well. 
Taste: Bitter pine. Loaded with tropical fruit. Mango, peach, tangerine, it's all there. Malt backbone is slightly sweet with some bread dough. Pale malts add a little bit of sweetness. Bitter. Tons of pine needle. Grapefruit pith and oil. Juicy. Super floral. Bitter and sweet. A hint of lime in the back. Some leafy hops as well. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate to almost light carbonation. A touch of astringency. Juicy initial sip.
Overall: A classy lady.
It's obviously good. This hop profile is better than most. 1,087 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jun 06, 2015

A= Hazy and yellow, large bubble foam.  Foam receded and laced the outside of the glass with a small island in the middle.
S= Citrus and pine aroma are notable.
T= Get mostly the citrus flavor at first taste, the pine and earthy notes come through in the end.  Some malt and perceivable sweetness.  Crisp and balanced.
M= Nice level of carbonation, refreshing and easy to drink.
O= Seems to be on par with most of Hill Farmstead IPA's.  Not their best, but much better than a typical IPA. 528 charactersjhavs, Jun 01, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Purchased at the brewery last weekend 5/16.  Poured from the 750ml growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed snifter.
a: Cloudy gold with an uneven bubbly surface foam wnich receded to a small patch of surface foam and extensive spotty lacing.
s: Moderate citrus.  Notes strangely similar to RAID bug killer emerge a bit later.
t: A flavor initially closer to pear than citrus, medium hop bite, slight lingering bitterness on a very dry finish.  Later citrus and pine come to dominate the flavor.
m: Light to medium, good body and carbonation tingle.
o: An eminently drinkable IPA, except for the weird aroma that develops.
UPDATE 7/12/15: Opened a 68 oz. growler tonight and had a couple of glasses.  No odd aromas or flavors, just a great balance of citrus/piney hops and bready malt, highly drinkable and refreshing on a hot summer's day.  Appearance also improved, with an inch thick white head which took some time to dissipate.  Also very good body, almost like a different beer from the one I had from the 750 ml.  Raising my ratings accordingly to  a: 4.5, s: 4.0, m: 4.25. 1,083 charactersscotorum, May 26, 2015

Poured a typically hazy orange/tangerine with a 1/2 inch of white head with minimal lacing.
Tons of grapefruit and ripe sweet mango on the nose, with a little welcome bit of biscuity sweetness. 
The sip is velvety smooth and soft, tiny champagne bubbles delivering a citrus juice bomb of a brew. A slightly sweet malt base hides any residual bitterness. The finish is appropriately dry. Hill Farmstead is in a different class when it comes to IPAs. 493 charactersElmCityBeer, Mar 31, 2015

S - a bit tight upon first few sniffs but a few good swirls and some time to warm it opens up nicely. Notes of sweet orange peel, zippy lime, grapefruit pulp, and hints of unripe mango. An undercurrent of earthy pine and peppery spice add depth to the nose.
T - simple malt profile of crusty bread. Lime zest is the dominate flavor with strong grapefruit rind bitterness plays off notes of pine needles intensifying the bitterness. some tropical fruit undertones of papaya and mango. Finish is crisp and dry with just a hint of lingering bitterness.
M - soft and pillowy texture. Medium carbonation.
O - solid ipa. Love the mouthfeel on this one. Really make the difference. 816 charactersTeleweizen2, Oct 27, 2014

Appearance is light golden and hazy in body with a thick white frothy head that reduces slowly to leave thick lacing.
Very floral on the nose, lots of pine , citrus and caramel too. 
On the tongue is sweet malt, citrus, floral, earthy notes. Some onion-ish notes, slight bitterness on the finish.
Medium body, low carbonation. 
Very nice. Not my favorite HF IPA but delicious nonetheless. 455 charactersgcamparone, Sep 23, 2014

Pours a murky hazy bright golden yellow/orange, with a 1.5 inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells like orange zest, pine, grapefruit, orange juice, pineapple. Juicy as all hell.
This one tastes amazing. The bitterness level is understated, and perfect, just there right at the back, lingering the whole time, reminding you it's an IPA, but on top of that, there's a whole of citrus and tropical fruity goodness, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. There's really nothing malt-wise in this one.
Susan is light and sprightly, with a very crisp mouthfeel, and a moderate amount of carbonation.
A most excellent IPA, it's crazy how drinkable and easy this one is. 751 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 16, 2014

Appearance: It has a beautiful deep golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves some nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of citrus, mango, peaches, floral undertones, some pine resins and sweet bready/buiscuity malts. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has citrus, mango, peaches (more prevalent here), bitter pine resins, some floral hops and bready/buiscuity malts. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low/med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. Fantastic IPA!

Hazy orange, ring of white head with some lace. Smell is hoppy lots of fruit, nectarine, fuzzy peach and apricot, just a little bit of sugar cookie/crackery malt on the tail end. Taste is a juicy mix of nectarine and peach, touches of grapefruit, moderate bitterness throughout, some restrained malt flavours underlying, dry finish. Lightly carbonated, medium full body. Just awesome an incredible top tier IPA, incredibly drinkable. 485 characterspeensteen, Sep 04, 2014

4.14/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Another shout out to Ineedabeerhere. Pours a dull orange hue with a hazy clarity and a frothy, textured, bright white head. Nose expresses tangerines, simcoe hops and a hint of grain. Taste follows nose - a little less bright than suggested by the nose with the addition of a light, slightly lingering medicinal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a slight acidity and a carbonation that falls just short of crisp. Overall, very good, but closer to an APA than an IPA in my opinion. 503 charactersJwale73, Jul 24, 2014

S-Unbelievably potent hop character. Huge tropical Citra notes and I bet the Riwaka isn't dragging ass either. The Simcoe also brings forth more of the abrasive hop aromatics of biting grapefruit and pine. There's some oniony character here and I'm all aboard with it. 
T-Pure, unadulterated hop extract. The trio of hops gives me a lot to describe. Melon, guava and mango along with some green onion and moss. Peach and pine. Tropical and bright but also dank and bitter. Just a trickle of sweetness before the bitterness burns it away.
M-Long, lingering bitterness.mmedium bodied. Resiny. Chewy hop feel. Moderate carbonation.
O-Easily one of the better beers I have ever had. Need more! The variance of the hop flavors is exquisite. Yeah, another Hill Farmstead beer that easily lives up to its godly status; I should stop being surprised...I've had enough of them to know by now. 1,041 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 08, 2014

Hazy, orange-yellow pour, with a small cap of foamy white head, which settled down from about an inch out of the tap; good retention and moderate lacing. Fresh citrusy hop aroma, lemony, pine needles, all things hoppy and good. An assertive twinge of citrus greeted the palate, lemon and grapefruit pith, lighter tropical and floral notes, with a light, crackery malt base. Light-medium mouthfeel, lower bitterness, moderate carb. Super drinkable, super good. 579 charactersRifugium, Jul 04, 2014

A - Hazy, dank, grapefruit orange, rugged froth cap, lacing for the entire time. Gentle dance of carbonation on the perimeter.
S - Mango, passion fruit, calla lily. A hint orange rime. Tropical all the way.
T - Mirrors the nose, lots of tropical fruit, with a fine malt dance. Not bitter in the least. A striking balance. At 6% there ins nothing to hide here. Fantastic body. Sorry Susan
M - Medium bodied, fabulous coating across the palate. No big sweep of oil, and a rich finish.
Does not finish bone dry. Delightful.
O - This IPA is just about perfect, bucks the trend of over the top hop monsters.
Achieves a delicate dance and a long backwards glance. This is worth every effort to taste.

But I digress...) enjoyed from a bulbous hill farmstead wine glass.
a -'brew pours a cloudy crisp orange yellow with a darker core. Really nice lush foamy head hangs out and the n coats the glass with lace as the head dissolves and the beer is consumed.
s - nose is soft citric. Fresh fruit. Crisp.
t - taste is also fairly spot on. Fresh fruit with a wonderful fruity hop. Bright citric notes but all extremely we'll balanced.
m - has that wonderful hf mouth feel. Easy drinking and perfectly medium bodied.
o - overall what can you say about Susan that you cannot say about hill farmstead on general. It is a quality product. Hill farmstead sets a new bar in beer creation. Everything in the right place. Recipes are carefully crafted and it shows. This is a phenomenal IPA. Psyched to have 64oz of is for myself. 1,145 characterscosmicevan, Apr 06, 2014

Great malt-hop balance in the aroma, a focus on citrusy hops, with hints of pine. The malt aroma is cracker like, slightly bready. The taste is focused more on piney hop character with notes of citrus and berries. Again a cracker-like malt profile, balance is towards the hops in the taste. Rich, smooth mouthfeel, with a medium body and moderate carbonation levels. Edwards sister beer indeed. 478 charactersPhigg1102, Mar 28, 2014

This is a wonderfully soft and drinkable pale ale. It's a hazy golden pale yellow with a tight, pure white head. Nice hoppy aroma, mostly tropical in nature, with some citrus. The taste is just perfect...no harshness or bitterness to speak of. Excellent moutfeel. Good to the last drop. I could drink this all day. 394 charactersFFreak, Mar 17, 2014

Appearance - Hazy golden yellow. Small white head. Wispy surface.
Smell - Tons of simcoe. Deeper whiff reveals mango and tropical fruits. I don't love simcoe, but this smells great.
Taste - All hops. Simcoey grapefruit at first. Grainy cracker malt. Switches dramatically to citra-like hop flavors in the finish. Tastes like mangoes in the end.
Mouthfeel - Light. Well carbonated and a touch of bitterness.
Overall - It takes a lot for a simcoe IPA to win me over, but this did. 542 charactersAlieniloquium, Feb 02, 2014

A totally cloudy orange body with good lacing. Smell hints at hops but the flavor is more malt forward than hoppy which is a little disappointing. Flavor of orange and mineral aftertaste round things out. Clean finish with minimal lingering. While good, with the pedigree that HF has built up, this one falls short unfortunately. 375 characterspapat444, Dec 25, 2013

Appearence is a medium amber, hazy liquid with very nice head, very nice lacing, good lacing retention.
Aromas are deep and strong. Sweetness, tropical fruit, only a hint of floral, mild bready malts in the far background.
Taste is perfect. Absolutely delicious, mouth begging for more sips. Coats your mouth with tropical fruit, tiny bubbles, some stickiness but not too sweet.
Finishes very nice with mild bitterness in the aftertaste.
Overall, another disturbingly terrific beer from Shaun. Susan rivals Double Sunshine IMO. 620 charactersBoldRulerVT, Dec 07, 2013

Hop notes big and slow from the pour, brightening a cool winter's day. 
Color is a burnished orange. A large, fluffy, tan head sits for a bit and never fully dies.
Big citrus hops to the nose as mentioned. Some orange and rind and herb. Not much else but brilliance. 
Smooth and fruity sweet up front with a quick juicy hop bite followed by some chalk, malt and notes of spice. A bit of candy sweetness dallies on the tongue. 
Medium bodied and easy on the palate, but with plenty of flavor. Glad I got the 2L of this sweet nectar. 553 charactersstephens101, Nov 30, 2013

This was my 200th "tour" of a brewery and may have been my favorite. You must go just to have the privilege of driving up the dirt roads in the middle of nowwherseville and waiting in line while they bring you 4 generous samples off the taps for $5...I thought heaven would require more effort to get to. 
One of my four was Susan which blew my mind so became one of my growler picks. The scene is very cool there...a group in front of me from Jersey on their second trip through line...a couple behind me from Georgia and NY...a guy in the parking lot from Rhode Island. This is not an easy ride - these folks all travelled several hours just to fill some growlers that the bottle tag says should be consumed within a week and all had been there before. Once you taste it, you will know why - Susan is the best beer I have ever tasted. My rating here is based on the 750ml growler and I'm now trying to figure out how I get back up there without being late for Thanksgiving dinner.
The citrus from the NZ hops is so delicious and unlike a lot of bigger IPA's, the alcohol is absent. Phenomenal...I need to learn how they brew something this good 1,258 characterstpmurray, Nov 27, 2013

A - Poured a cloudy orange colour with good carbonation. Two fingers of soapy white head. Really good lace rings and a film of retention.
S - Zippy hops. Orange, grass, passionfruit. Lotsa citrus.
T - Nice tropical character, floral, citrus, orange, mango, peach, honey. Quite juicy and fruity, mild malt character. Complexity of hop flavours is really nice. 
M - Good carbonation, medium body, nice bitterness.
O/D - This was a good IPA. The Riwaka worked really well with Citra and Simcoe. I really enjoyed this one. The depth of hop flavours was really pleasant. Well done. 646 charactersbylerteck, Nov 25, 2013

Very hazy pale orange with an off-white head with great retention and lace. Doesn't really get under a finger.
Definitely a noticeable scent upon pouring, tropical citrus earthiness and light toasty malts. Strength does seem to fade after some time.
Taste is great, tangerine, lemon, mango, pine dank hops with a toasted biscuit finish. Tropical earthy goodness to start, bready goodness on the finish, can't ask for much more out of an IPA. Good amount of bitterness to it but very drinkable, probably perfect amount of malt backbone. 
Mouthfeel is very smooth yet well-carbonated. Feels a bit bigger than the listed ABV via heftiness and bitterness but that's really not a flaw here.
Very good, and maybe my fav. IPA from Hill Farmstead so far. Though I liked the 'softer' flavors of Society & Solitude #5 alot, I enjoyed the amped up bitterness on this one more, it still remains pretty balanced and drinkable. 1,012 charactersChico1985, Nov 11, 2013

Poured from growler into pint glass. 1/4" head dissipates within a minute. Color is a unfiltered pale straw-amber. Thank you to breweries who have stopped filtering out the deliciousness.
Swirling the glass and shoving nose in glass reveals grapefruits and apricots and tremendous sweetness, straw and something papaya-like. Doh. Just splashed myself in the face.
Rolling around a big swig over the tongue and bringing in air over the tongue for about fifteen seconds: Flavor is tremendously well-balanced, some initial sweetness, passionfruit, and papaya, but not sugary, ever-so-slight bitterness, after-taste is floral and complex. Fruit flavors are quite bright, definite beyond the basic grapefruit tastes in the standard IPA.
Just can't get over how delicious, balanced, and sublime this is. Hits all the pleasure centers in my brain. And my descriptions just aren't doing this beer justice. Sorry, fellas. Wish this was available everywhere.
I'd move to Greensborough just to be able to drink this on a regular basis. 1,053 charactersBrewedEgo, Oct 19, 2013

Appearance: Well we're off to a good start. Nice light yellow/orange color. Looks like mostly pale malt in this guy. Good lacing. A nice ring of head hangs around.
Aroma: Huge citrus; Very much a bitter orange juice type quality. Some tropical fruit as well with hints of pine and resin. The citrus jumps out of the glass more than any beer I've ever had. Not one thing I would change in terms of aroma.
Taste: Follows the nose. Medium bitterness for the style with huge citrus and some stonefruit I did not pick up in the nose plus the previously mentioned pine/resin. Slight hints of biscuity malt pop through at times but malt definitely takes a backseat in this one. Finishes dry and citrusy; Light to medium bodied for the style. Exceptional, exceptional stuff.
Mouthfeel: While certainly not a session beer in terms of alcohol %, this beer has all the qualities of a beer I could drink for hours. Moderate bitterness, light to medium bodied, well-carbed, finishes dry and resets the palette easily. Three glasses went down in what was seemingly a blink of an eye.
Overall: In the right mood, there's no doubt in my mind this would get a 5/5. Likely the best single IPA (under 7.2 or so) I've ever had with only Alpine Nelson putting up a real serious fight. While I tend to dislike all the hype and hysteria that surrounds Hill Farmstead, there's no denying the beer is phenomenal. 1,433 charactersjacewg, Oct 18, 2013

The aroma is just rolls of tangerine, bright grapefruit, tropical fruits and mango. It's hugely vibrant and citrusy. There's a bit of malt in there.
The flavor is just an explosion of grapefruit baseline. Spicy and grassy in the front. The middle offers a sweet passionfruit, apricot, peach, mango, onto a bit of bubble gum. The back end dries out with light bitterness. A bit of floral and spicy herbal bitterness.
This beer really blows my mind about how well crafted an IPA can be. The hops just do not stop on this one. 574 charactersdar482, Oct 09, 2013

Cloudy and hazy body with about a finger width head. Almost looks like a combination of orange and mango juice.
Tastes of citrus: orange and lemon and hops. A nice sweetness on the end from the malts. Nicely balanced.
Not a lot of carbonation, and by the end their wasn't much left coming out of the growler. Really lets the hops and malts shine.

Susan is a deep, golden apricot in color with a rich cream white head that leaves good lacing. A carefully crafted hop blend is the highlight here - those lovely NZ hops bring their tropical medley including kiwi, mango, and passionfruit with the others bringing citrus highlights of tangerine and grapefruit. Juicy and fresh, riding a light, subtly sweet pale malt base with a touch of honey. Pleasant on the palate - moderate in body with a soft light-moderate carbonation. A balanced bitterness with a touch of citrus oil accents the finish and provides a dry, drinkable close. A top-tier IPA that pulls in all the best characteristics of a great hop blend and sets them against a thoughtful malt base.. 819 charactersblackie, Oct 04, 2013

T- The flavor opens mostly with citrus, specifically tangerine and grapefruit. The middle is buttery smooth with the caramel/butterscotch malt body. It finishes with a floral/grassy, mildly bitter hop bite.
M- The mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. Frighteningly smooth and buttery, reminiscent of Abner. Just the right amount of carbonation and a dry finish.

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This brew was poured from a refillable 750mL Hill Farmstead bottle, filled at the brewery growler-style, into our Founders snifters. It glows the color of butternut squash, offering up a two and a half finger tall head of soapy, chunky, white bubbles, showing excellent retention. Cratered honeycomb lacing is left all around the glass. A murky haze cuts clarity and remains throughout, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be light. The aroma is wonderfully bright and fresh, giving notes of raw honeys, grapefruit and nectary sweet hops, mineral-laden water and clay, granular white sugar, apricot and nectarine fruitiness, thyme and oregano leafiness, sunscreen soapiness, envelope adhesive, and chalky pale malts. Our first impression is that the flavoring is just as juicy and sweetly hoppy as you would expect, helping to bolster and balance residual bitterness through the finish. As we sip, sour Starburst candy fruitiness, pale and lightly wheaty malts, white chalk and blackboard slate, mineral clay, white grape skins, biting citric rind, and a blend of grassy, nectary, grapefruity, and soapy hops start things off. Moving through the peak is continued freshness of grassy and soapy hops, fresh squeezed grapefruit juiciness, peach and tangerine flesh, booze and orange peel bitterness, green twigs, moderate metallic bite, and light rubbers. The end washes with bitterness of lemon and grapefruit rind, soapy citric and lavender oils, cotton, graphite, manila, white sugar and honey sweetness, residual bitterness of raw barley and lightly toasted pale malts, vegetal metallics, and honeysuckle. The aftertaste breathes of crusted wax, walnut oils, herbal hop bite, well water, resinous tree sap, green olive oiliness, lemon and grapefruity juiciness, sesame seed, dried pale malts, baker’s yeast, fresh grassy hoppiness, creamy milkiness, robust metallics, and denim. The body is medium, and the carbonation is medium. Each sip gives soft slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop. Following an initial foamy coating, the mouth dries with lightly puckering astringency and chalkiness. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks easily.
Overall, the best thing about this beer is its flavoring. This was actually a hard decision for us, as at first pop of the bottle we were initially thinking that the aroma couldn’t possibly be trumped. We were proved wrong. This is mainly due to the evolution with each, as they were exposed to heat. The flavoring calmed and became more even, while the aroma simply lost vigor. Keep in mind we are being exquisitely critical here, and both are actually sensational. This beer is wildly juicy from the hops, and happily “down-home”, with the typical Hill Farmstead well-water inclusions, which truly make each beer unique and continually incredible. 2,815 charactersTheBrewo, Sep 20, 2013

Pours a nice clear copper body, with that impressive Hill Farmstead white head that rises to 2cm, and has great retention. Lacing is decent, but that head is really something.
Nose is really, really pungent. So much tropical fruit here. Citrus, grapefruit, mango, pineapple. This is incredibly strong and delicious.
The flavour on this beer is awesome. At the beginning, there's a lot of tangerine, grapefruit, citrus that transitions into a nice piney bitterness. The malt is there just enough to adequately balance out all the hops in this beer- caramel, toffee, but especially toffee. But this is probably the hoppiest tasting IPAs I've ever had. Then it transitions into this awesome bitterness, even more bitter than Abner or Ephraim which are DIPAs. Crazy.
Mouthfeel is that incredible creamy carbonated Hill Farmstead trademark. I really cannot say enough about these. Incredible. It's gotta be that Hill Farmstead well water.
This is the best single IPA I've ever had. Jai Alai is great, but it just doesn't have that Hill Farmstead creamy full bodied IPA mouthfeel. This is incredible and I have to thank Doug for being so generous in sharing growlers of Hill Farmstead with me. 1,291 charactersStevedore, Sep 07, 2013

Pours light and carbonated. Contains the signature HF glow, which I surmise is caused by highly addictive drugs. Very beautiful brew.
Smells huge! Wow. Packs a punch for a single IPA. Smells bigger than most IIPAs I've had in the past, including Abner. Its citrusy (grapefruit) and piney. 
Taste is not as big as the smell, but it is fantastic. The beer is pretty damn bitter with resin lingering on the tongue. I actually think the 'single' aspect to this IPA is what accentuates the hops. There is no where for them to hide, so you get a little bit of a smack in the face. Again, a lot of grapefruit with a piney bitterness on the back end. 
Mouthfeel... Well, it's HF, so pretty much perfect. Super creamy and full bodied. Also very carbonated, but in a unique way. It's almost like the carbonation is more evenly distributed than most beers. Carbonation is never harsh with HF. The head is always big but extra fluffy. Water? Yeast? Maybe it's magic.
Overall, on the single ipa curve, this one takes the cake so far. I honestly can't think of anything better. Furious is ok, two hearted is good, blind pig is great, but this is fantastic. Cheers to Susan! 1,248 characterslunarbrew, Sep 07, 2013

Pours a murky light orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight tropical aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great citrus and tropical aromas and flavors that make it super easy to drink. 614 charactersUCLABrewN84, Aug 19, 2013

A: Typical color you'd expect here, the lighting blows in my office where I'm writing this however its a nice burnt orange w/ a tinges of yellow. A fair amount of lacing but not as much as some of the other HF beers I've had.
S: Very nice smell, perfectly balanced - lots of citrus, hops, mango, pineapple.
T: Pretty much knew what was coming - love the taste of this, kind of disappointed I didn't get a 2L of this vs. the SS#7 as it definitely beats it out as my favorite. Lots of tropical fruit on the tongue here with almost a perfect finish, no harshness or even hoppiness - the fruit just fades gradually. Hell, even my burps taste good.
M: Susan feels great in my mouth. 
O: This is a fantastic little concoction from Hill Farmstead, I certainly agree with the previous review that this has become one of my favorites and I definitely prefer it over some of the all time favorites of most like Edward. 1,028 charactersBeRanger, Aug 17, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes from two growler fills from 8/8 and 8/9. Made the drive to Hill from Burlington, Vt. two days in a row and waited 2 hours and 3 hours respectively for Susan. Served in a Citizen Cider snifter.
A: Very hazy orange, very pleasant.
S: Hoppy citrus beaming out of the glass. Extremely inviting, this is the kind of aroma that makes you excited to taste.
T: Susan's taste is, to me, absolutely spot on. The citrus hops, specifically mango and tangerine for me, hit you immediately and last throughout the tasting. The alcohol is present, yet not overbearing. It's not JUST hoppy either, it's a hell of a robust beer. 
M: Thick, carbonated, and perfect.
O: As a quasi-local, I've had my share of Hill's beers over the past few years. And, while I would never discount Shaun Hill's ability to make absolutely world-class beers, I had never quite fell in love with any of the things I had tried. Edward is fantastic, sure, but I could never bring myself to drive all the way to the Northeast Kingdom for a growler of Ed. Susan changed that. To me, Susan is THE perfect IPA. The balance is there, the tropical citrus is there, and the drinkability and refreshment is there. Susan is the epitome of Hill's skill, in my opinion. I fell in love with Susan so madly that I had to return the very next day and wait for over 3 hours for another 2 Liters of this, in my opinion, perfect Vermont single IPA. If you find yourself fortunate enough to find Susan anywhere, you'd be a fool not to give her a try. This my personal pick for the "best beer I've ever had." 1,573 charactersBTVflatlander, Aug 13, 2013

4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Purchased at the brewery on 8-8-13, from a 750ml growler poured into a The Alchemist pint glass.
AP: Nice inviting colour on this one, reminds me of orange or peach marmalade. Fluffy 1.5" head that dwindles down to 1/4". Almost no lacing on the sides when you tilt the glass, so excellent head retention.
AR: A pine and citrus explosion of aromas on the first whiff. Green fresh pine more like the needles than the bark/sap. Citrus is grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine. Light toasty crackery grains in the background. 
T: I swear the malt base to this has a buttery roll taste to it, like the croissants I bought recently at my local supermarket. I like that as it gives it more depth than just being light grains and crackers playing solely second fiddle to the hops. All the citrus aromas are in the taste as well, very well balanced both among themselves and with the malts. On the taste I get a little more tropical fruit like pineapple and papaya. A nice soft bitter citrus rind finish that lingers for a while. The fruity hops flavours don't come across as what I'd call 'juicy' though. 
M: Fairly carbonated, slightly creamy on the palate, finish isn't too dry or puckering, pretty much a clean finish. 
OV: A very good beer for certain, just not quite World Class to me. It's very good, but it didn't blow me away. Now, that's not a bad thing and I'm not disappointed in any way. If I could get my hands on a beer like this whenever I wanted then it would be in my regular rotation to drink. I'm glad I got this and tried it. 1,537 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Aug 10, 2013

Appearance: Pours a light, hazy amber and leaves a finger or two of white medium-density head, which lingers around a bit.
Smell: Lemon peel, juicy citrus, mild peppercorn, some light spices. Smells very refreshing and has a nice, mild aroma.
Taste: Matches the aroma right on. Lemon peel, peppercorn, citrus. Quite juicy. Finishes with some mild, earthy pine. Very light and well balanced.
Mouth-feel: Well carbonated with a light to medium body. Very, very smooth, alcohol is completely hidden.
Overall: A very well balanced, light, delicious IPA. I could definitely drink a lot of this. Citrus is the dominant hop flavor but there are some nice other flavors weaved in. 786 charactersResuin, Jul 11, 2013
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Brought back a full-size growler of this one over the weekend and extremely glad I did. Also drank a 750ml the night before with a different set of people. Notes from July 7th.
A- Light golden-orange colored body poured into 5 pint glasses with just enough room for a one finger head sticking out the top of the glass. The cap has a nice creamy texture to it and retains very well. Lots of lacing webs.
S- A massive mango-citrus-IPA feel almost like a pulp/puree of extremely fresh fruits. Just has a great juicy feel like the best of the "West Coast" IPAs. Peach and orange zest really come to mind too.
T- Everything really works out nicely here. Juicy citrus, orange, mango, passion fruit, peach, tropical hop profile. The hop flavor is very big but not over the top like some new beers tend to be, the flavors are easily distinguished but come together into one great mix. Slight freshly cracked grain and yeast bread in there beyond this. Earthy and pine hop flavors come into play eventually as well.
MF- Creamy and a resinous, oily IPA feel. Moderately thick body with a medium carbonation that accentuates the hop flavor nicely. Clean bitterness round it all out.
West Coast flavors produced beautifully on the Eastern side of the USA. Between Heady and Hill Farmstead I think the coastal styles of IPA has truly been abolished because they are just as good over here. The best new IPA I have tried in quite some time. 1,431 characterscbutova, Jul 10, 2013

Poured into a small 8oz tasting glass at the brewery.
Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice white head. There are some nice bright orange hues to the brew as well. The head is nice and sticky and soapy like most of the higher quality IPAs.
Aroma starts off with citrus fruits, amazing tropical fruit notes. Bright and fresh citrus fruit juice with a nice herbal and grassy backbone is present. There are notes of orange and tangerines and some mild grapefruit and nice dry overall hoppy bitterness. These HF brews although seem balanced are all about the hops. The bready malt is there but it isn’t.
Flavor is the same story. Grassy and herbal with nice pine notes. I forget this is a single IPA ‘cuz it is a hop-heads dream. Clean yet dank and piney with tons of citrus notes that are very present but not overwhelming. They just keep making you come back for more. There are some mild tropical fruit notes of mango and papaya but the citrus notes take the lead. Yummy, drinkable and deceiving because it seems like a DIPA. Mouthfeel is great crisp, clean, dry and bitter.
HF IPAs are taking the craft beer scene by storm. I think this one deserves the hype as a strong single IPA that is drinkable and well crafted. 1,254 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jul 04, 2013

Pours a slightly cloudy golden amber color. The nose is full of citrus peel bitterness and grassy hops. The flavor is even nicer than the nose. I'm getting citrus peel hop bitterness along with a grassy note here as well. There is just enough light malt behind the hops, gives the beer a pleasant bread like characteristic.. The finish is bitter with a slightly fruity note. The carbonation is smooth with a dry finish. 459 charactersoline73, Feb 15, 2013

A: Peach orange, gorgeous fluffy white 2 fingers of head, a bit cloudy. Killer lacing.
S: Citrus fruit, earthy hops. Peachy.
T: More pine in the flavor than the fruity and earthy hops I got in the nose. Very hoppy, but not overly so. You'd guess this a DIPA based on taste though.
D: Very high. A couple of glasses of this will go down smoothly. Not too strong, alcohol well hidden.
M: Medium body, medium carb.
O: Really great beer. For all of HF's awesome hoppiness, their single IPA's typically take a backseat to Edward and all the DIPA's. Not Susan - she's in that same class. 631 characterscbeer88, Feb 09, 2013

Filled 1/19/13 (drank at 2 weeks)
A: Pours out the typical HF hazy bright yellow orange color. Still some carbonation after nearly two weeks, I love it! Bright white head with tight tiny bubbles. Leaves some sticky lacing bits on the glass.
S: On the nose, got lots of citrus fruits. Really light on the malt bill. Citrus and some pine notes.
T: Taste follows the nose. Really awesome fruity, citrus and pine IPA. Low on the malt bill, but still some what balance on the palate. Not overly bitter, but you do get that hit right up front on the touch. The finish is dry with some lingering hoppy flavors.
M: Medium bodied. 638 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 04, 2013

Susan pours a medium bodied very cloudy tangerine orange I'm color with a great one finger, bright white and soapy head. The nose is bright and citrusy with a slightly earthy and grassy, mellow hop character. The flavors are very well rounded. There is a lot of citrus up front followed by a spicy bready malt aspect. It finishes with a soapy grassy note that interesting and a little yeasty. It drinks light and soapy and an off dry. I really like it. For an IPA it is very unique. The three hop varietals work very well together. Hats off to Sean Hill. This one worked. 664 charactersaasher, Feb 02, 2013
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Thank you, Eric.
A uniformly cloudy orange (Shaun needs to filter his IPAs some, methinks) with a dense, fluffy, white cap that leaves a gorgeous amount of lacing, this is a great looking IPA. The nose is rather excellent. Bright and fruity, this has a blend of citrus ( blend of orange and grapefruit, close to a white grapefruit, in fact) and the classic Simcoe floral and fruity aromas standing out (mango is noticeable). Moderately juicy, this beer also has a touch of honey to it. Not particularly dank or resiny, this is rather delicate.
The palate opens with a blend of mango, grapefruit, a little lemon and a rather floral pine nose. This really is a potpourri of hop goodness. Bitterness is moderate and is gentle, lacking in the pungency and resiny character that my favorites have, but instead, having an almost-as-enjoyable gently fruity bitterness that is the HFS signature (to me, at least). Malt? What malt? Maybe some pale malt, along with a touch of honey, but really, there isn't much here. The mouthfeel is soft and gentle, with a prodding bitterness and a suffuse fruity hop flavor that fully coats the palate. Initially, it does seems a little watery, but the creamy carbonation does pair rather well with the rest of the flavors here. Lingering flavors on the finish are mango, citrus and some floral character. Excellent stuff. 1,352 charactersDefenCorps, Feb 01, 2013

The taste is again very heavy on the citrus, but with a strong malt backbone; lots of herbal notes, too. It's a little thick, but well carbonated. Reminds me a lot of Edward, but more amped up. A good beer. 368 charactersgory4d, Jan 28, 2013

Served in a cervoise
Cloudy, dark mustard yellow in appearance. The liquid was topped by a small, eggshell colored crop of froth that fell to a clingy film. Lacy looking patches of foam trickled down the glass.
The aroma was amazingly skunky and dank. Super weed-like. Piney and resiny. Tropical fruit notes were apparent. Definitely some mango and pineapple. Slightly citrusy.
Citrus notes dominated the flavor profile. Lots of tangerine and orange peel. Touch of lemon. Some pine and resin as well. Semi-bitter notes of white grapefruit came through on the finish.
The mouthfeel was creamy and frothy yet thinner bodied for the style. The liquid contained a lively, spritzy effervescence.
Susan is a very solid IPA but definitely not one of Hill Farmstead's better offerings. Even though this beer is all about hops, I cannot help but think that a touch more malts could help improve the mouthfeel and round out the flavor profile. 979 charactersDamian, Jan 23, 2013

Pretty much standard appearance for an HF IPA. Bursting with citrus on the nose, especially grapefruit and a bit of lemon. Some floral and pine notes mixed in as well. 
Nice juicy citrus flavors on the palate with notes of grapefruit and orange. A bit tropical as well. Finishes with some piney character and a pleasant bitterness. Thinner in the body than expected but that is likely because I'm more familiar with some of HF stronger DIPAs. 
Overall, a real winner of an IPA as expected. It's nice to be able to get this much citrusy and piney hop flavor without committing to a heavy hitting Double IPA. 716 charactersKinsman, Jan 20, 2013

Pours a hazed golden copper with a dense fluffy white head. Nose has heavy with resiny tropical fruits and earthy pine. Flavor is a little sweeter, with grapefruit rind, pineapple, mango and peach and a dry earthy pine and grassy finish. Medium thick body, soft carbonation and a sticky, bitter finish. Great balance of hops as the Simcoe pine plays nicely with the leafy NZ hop tropical fruitiness. The Riwaka single hop was a little more "exceptional" and a better showcase for that hop, but Susan's subtlety and balance make this much easier to drink.
The smell and overall scores are more of a 4.75 but I refuse to use the new quarter intervals in scores since I never had access to them the previous 6 years of reviewing. Just...whatever. 788 charactersyourefragile, Jan 12, 2013

Pours a very hazy opaque dark almost muddy orange. Two fingers of off white head. Lost of web by lace.
Bright citrus aroma, with some floral hops and touches of pine and sweet bread malts.
Taste is high citrus, ,old grapefruit, some sweet orange, spice, somewhat resinous.
Has a great feel, somewhat light bodies, good mild crisp carbonation, some slickness.

A-this is a magnificent beer to behold. Glad I am enjoying it in the day so I can see its vibrant copper color beautiful fluffy 1/2" head and beautiful lacing and consistent visible micro-carbonation. This a like a Van Gogh or Matisse, gorgeous.
S-Hints of orange and grapefruit with a backbone of piney resin. Kind of like an Ephraim-lite.
T-wonderful citrus burst, best example of grapefruit I have had in a perfect way. There is a pine based with mango and pineapple all over the place.
M-my mouth was watering thru the entire experience. Beautiful bit of tingle on the tongue, great level of carbonation, and reminiscent of OJ with a bit of pulp. Quite pleasing.
O-I love White Raja and really enjoy Fat Head and Flower Power, Blind Pig, and Zombie Dust. With that all said, this brew killed it in a way that none of those beers was able to. The best part is that the flavor lingers in the back of your throat. I would love to have regular access to this beauty. 1,035 charactersunclejazz, Jan 02, 2013

The beer pours a really lovely copper honey color, hues of gold and light amber, very cloudy complexion. A nice finger and a half of white soapy heady appears and has good retention, lots of film atop the beer after the head has completely receded and wonderful soapy lacing survives the entire session. The aroma is spectacular, bright and vibrant notes of grapefruit and pineapple, floral notes of a fresh bouquet of wildflowers are very dominant as well, light earthy pine is there as well with a healthy amount of pale cereal malt. I could stick my nose in this beer forever, the balance is wonderful and the brightness is really special. The flavors are nice but fall a bit flat compared to the nose, grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine are all present with the same kick of fresh wildflower and lemongrass, the earthiness take over at the finish with bitter dirty pine and grassy weeds and some stronger sweeter malt than the nose suggested. Susan is full bodied, lower on the spectrum of carbonation but still lively and appropriate for the style and has a nice dry bitter finish that leaves a bit of a cottonmouth sensation behind.
Verdict: A really wonderful IPA from Hill Farmstead and another triumph in their hoppy arsenal. The aroma is really something to behold, a truly delightful beer to savor and enjoy. 1,380 characterskevanb, Dec 31, 2012

A- Susan pours a gorgeous mango orange fill with highly anticipate hazy color. A creamy white head of foam rises only to slowly subside leaving lacing everywhere. It's a sticky as possible it can be towards the edges
S- A plethora of citrus and tropical fruit tones burst out of the glass. Some sweet malt is present along with a pepper like presence. Susan is very lively and floral and that is exactly how I like ipas. Even a slight pine scent at the end just to round it off
T- an onslaught of tropical fruit, pineapple, and lemon zest wax my taste buds in the form of a green mountain avalanche. While the hoppiness is out of this world, a sweet malt undertone coates the palate with some of the aforementioned pepper tone. This is the real deal for an India pale ales taste profile. Hoppy as can be with emphasis on citrus and bitter characteristics as well
M- carbonation, smoothness, coating flavor that has the perfect feel. Sticky on the palate and delicious aftertaste
O- so it is now a fact for me. For ipas only, Susan passes Flower power as the best ipa I have ever had. The riwaka hops combined with simcoe and citra (and topped off with shaun's brewing style) created a citric hop bomb of mouth watering flavor. I really enjoyed this and wish I had easier access to it 1,419 characterslovindahops, Dec 30, 2012

The taste is divine: crisp and tight. Fruity, juicy, and oh so beautifully smooth. It just dances in the mouth and down the throat. 
I'm in love. Never had a regular IPA be such a blast. This is real love guys. 457 charactersPatrickbrusil, Dec 25, 2012

A - Pours a hazy, fruity juicy looking, pale dirty orange color - almost looks like thin grapefruit juice. A thick two fingers of fluffy and a bit rocky off white foam with good staying power and shape retention. Lingers for a couple of minutes and falls slowly to the surface leaving a small mountain of foam in the middle of the glass and lots of sticky webs of lacing on the sides of the glass.
S - Lots of hoppy good aromas here. I get a big hit of pine up front surrounded by dense grapefruity citrus aromas. Quite resiny and sticky smelling beer...a sharp Riwaka spiciness and a fair amount of sweaty-ness in the hops also. Malt...maybe a touch can be found under all of the fresh hops, but it is a bit of a stretch - hints of sugary sweetness is really all I can pick up here. Great smelling IPA.
T - A bit of sweetness at the base that quickly is overtaken by a mid-level bitterness that is crisp and has a nice linger to it on the tongue. Resiny pine makes the biggest impression on my palate, followed by the sweaty sticky hop flavors. Citrus is well integrated as well although it is lost a bit behind the pine aspects. Rounded out by the herbal and spicy southern hemisphere hop flavors. The pungency of the hop aroma led me to expect a bit more intensity in the hop flavor. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of hop flavor here, but it is surprisingly tame on the palate. It doesn't hit the tongue like a sledgehammer of hops like I expected it would. instead it is rather smooth and a bit gentle allowing a lot of hop complexity to come thru.
M - Carbonation is a bit on the lower side of medium, giving a light tingle on the tongue. Body is also a touch lighter than medium. Sticky body with a wealth of hops complexity - citrus, pine, spice, herbal...great mix.
O - Overall, a very good American IPA. One of the better examples of the style using New Zealand hops. I find that the NZ hops on their own are interesting but just a little bit "off" for me. This has a mix of American and NZ hops that works quite well...super complexity in the hop profile with a wealth of different flavors that play off of each other without any one hop really dominating. Glad to have been able to try this one. 2,360 charactersportia99, Dec 20, 2012

Score: 87
Two week old 2L growler. Served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead snifter and enjoyed on 09/19/12.
Appearance: Pours a translucent sunset yellow color with three fingers of white foamy head. Really good lacing and excellent retention. Leaks a lot of streaky head along the side of the glass. 4.5/5
Smell: Orange, pine, sweet malt, citra pellets, grapefruit and a faint wood aroma. 4/5
Taste: There's lots of sweet tropical fruit and malt, but none of the necessary bitterness for an IPA. Oranges, grapefruit and mango. The citra hopping is clear. There's a faint bitter pine in the finish that needs to be more prominent. Tastes a lot like hoppy, unfermented wort -- somewhat underattenuated quite frankly. Not bad, but not that good either. Gets sweeter/maltier as it approached room temperature. 3.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full-medium bodied with decent carbonation. Super dry, almost cotton-mouthing. Bitter on the finish, sweet on the pull. 3.5/5
Overall: Missing the necessary bitter kick. This is a rare miss for Shawn Hill in my worthless opinion.
Recommendation: If you have to skip any Hill Farmstead IPA, make it this one.
Pairings: Thai food.
Cost: $25 for a 2L growler (including the cost of the growler). 1,286 charactersjegross2, Dec 15, 2012

Thanks so much for sending this to me, baconsausage!
Cloudy, hazy, murky dark orange, but nearly a light brown because of all the residual sediment. This leaves the glass very messy with sheets of sticky irregular lacing all the way down. Gorgeous IPA, and unique in it's incredible lack of clarity. Is that due to a wheat addition?
Stinging citrus notes abound in this IPA--lots of grapefruit flesh and zest, juicy orange and mango, and a bit of pine sap. There's a touch of a sweet malt character underlying the fruit, but this is simply, yet outrageously citrus-forward.
The flavor is similar to the aroma, with huge amounts of grapefruit and pineapple making up the abundance of the flavors' notes, along with an assertive, yet complementary earthy bitterness that lingers on the back end. Extraordinary.
Medium bodied with moderate to high, yet slightly creamy, carbonation. Marvelously drinkable.
An exceptional IPA. In the upper echelon of IPAs and my favorite from Hill Farmstead. 1,002 charactersehammond1, Dec 11, 2012

Thanks! I think this is the second batch.
A: Hazy yellow orange with two fingers of mountainous sea foam. Very cloudy. Great retention and lots of lacing.
S: Bright, fresh fruit redolence: tangerine, spicy grapefruit, orange flesh, mango, and papaya. There's a little sweet malt beneath the layers of hop fragrance, imparting a touch of breadiness.
T: The excellent aroma carries through to the flavor. Waves of fruit hit my palate, and each sip leaves me wanting another. Notes of tangerine, orange, and grapefruit blend with a light tropical fruit presence. Bitterness is at a moderate level and it's very smooth and gentle, lacking any astringency whatever. Smooth bitter fruity hop finish.
M: Medium body with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth and sticky.
Overall: A nice IPA. Smooth and highly drinkable with an excellent aroma. 860 charactersHopHead84, Dec 10, 2012

A: thick orangey honey color with small white head completely opaque with nothing going through 
S: wow it smells like a tropical fruit paradise there is some hops and maybe a bit of pine fresh too 
T:I don't know where to start there are so many delicious flavors lots strong of melon, orange, and other tropical fruits, there is a piney resiny flavor too, but the hop bitterness is still there in the finish and the fruit comes our more as the beer warms 
M:great smooth oily resiny feel to it there is some light carbonation for a bite but it goes down really smooth the crispness is there but goes away as the beer warms up
O: this is a good looking wonderful smelling great tasting ipa with a decent mouthfeel made from 3 of my favorite hops I can honestly say this is not only the best ipa I've had from hill farmstead so far but it's one of the best ipas I've ever had quality stuff for sure get it if you can 964 charactersPinknuggets, Dec 06, 2012

Big tropical fruit presence. I get mostly mango, but a little pineapple as well. Slight peppery spiciness in the background and not a lot of malt.
Lots of tropical fruit including massive mango up front. Just a little bit grainy towards the middle, but almost all hops. Finishes with a grapefruit pith explosion with a little floral character along with other citrus. I love the transition from tropical fruits to grapefruit at the end. Great hop combo.
Medium bodied and very oily. A shade over medium carbonation. As always HF nails mouthfeel.
Haven't looked up exactly what riwaka is, but I will now. There are some great flavors and it complements the known deliciousness of the citra/simcoe combo. Once again Hill Farmstead nails an IPA. 870 charactersjmarsh123, Dec 03, 2012

Huge creamy head, sticks around for a while, tons of thick fluffy lacing, layered, super hazy carrot orange red color. 
Nose great, the riwaka really stands out, great fruity like tropical but grassy and floral at the same time, light almost lemony citrus with guava and light passion fruit, touch of grapefruit, etc etc, fluffy malts underneath.
Mmmmm, again riwaka, very tasty, light tropical fruit, guava and passion fruit, light grassy floral, light jack fruit like too, light bitter rind, light lemony, little tangerine light hop oil, touch resin. All that with a nice light malt base to balance. Finish is nice, dry and balanced, lingering long hop with grassy and floral citrus tropical fruit goodness.
Mouth is med bodied, light oily feel, nice carb. 
Overall very nice, nice hop profile, again the delicious riwaka taking the show with the nice other tropical fruit hops in there as well. 923 charactersjlindros, Dec 03, 2012

Once again, I'm in complete "ahhg" from my favorite New England brewer. Shaun is definitely the man, whether it's low octane APA's or high octane IPA's, Stouts or what ever. He's got the formula. This time around we're digging on an IPA that is just fantastic from start to finish. And maintains a good shelf life to boot. 
The look of this liquid gem is nothing short of amazing. It fits the bill for all the qualities one looks for in appearance in the style. Pours a cloudy looking orange with a big huge soapy head that won't quit. Damn.. 
The lacing on my glass could be mistaken for soap suds it's that thick. Absolutely no sediment too speak of in suspension or on the bottom. No noticeable carbonation but massive head never the less. This beer looks hot and may be giving me wood...
Aroma is big time grape fruit, orange peel, apricot (which I needed to actually smell before I could include it in the review), peach and pineapple. Simply put this is citrus utopia.
Taste is in your face white grapefruit, clementine, lemon peel, and a huge play on pine hops. The big sweetness of the peach is a nice addition and in my mind gets the credit for the balancing act. The big malt backbone adds a nice creamy feel that's rare for the style (brewers take notice). Is this really only 6.2 %?!!
The body is medium and the beer goes down extremely smooth for so much flavor and hops. The aftertaste is perfectly bitter and dry and not over done. I really like this and could drink it on a regular basis. Maybe a desert island beer...
What can I say. Shaun is dead on with so many beers and this one's no exception. Riwaka hops equall grapefruit, hell ya! This beer is soo drinkable on all levels. Man I love living in New England.
Cheers!!! 1,823 characters05Harley, Dec 02, 2012
4.08/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a growler friends had filled for me 24 hours before this review. Susan pours a hazy honey yellow with a touch of amber mixed in. A moderate creamy head on top slowly fades away leaving behind a nice netted pattern of lace on the glass. I scored appearance a little high because just looking at this beer makes me anticipate the first sip.
The aroma is lemon citrus, a little grapefruit, tropical fruit and a touch of pine. It's a pleasant aroma, but not especially strong.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft and creamy with a mild carbonated fizz. The flavor begins with tropical fruit and orange/grapefruit citrus and some lemon peel. Sweet malt is found in the background and helps balance out the hoppy bitterness. In the middle there's a spicy hint of pepper. It finishes grassy, dry and moderately bitter. Once gone the orange citrus and bitterness lingers on the palate.
Another winning IPA from Hill Farmstead. It's not a hop monster, but has plenty of hop flavor. Not super 'green' as other hoppy beers. 1,035 charactersWanderingFool, Dec 02, 2012

Citrusy grapefruit aroma, slightly grassy and pungent with resinous hops. 
Taste is also citrus forward, mainly grapefruit that is slightly sweet, a light pale malt presence towards the middle, generally very light and smooth in feel. Light to medium bitterness, it finishes clean and mellow. Very drinkable, but somewhat one dimensional taste-wise. Enjoyed the light body and easy drinkability most of all.

Finishing the day with this after several sours. Another huuuugely fragrant and flavorful IPA from the talented brewers at HF. Beautiful, cloudy, golden color with a massive frothy, sticky, white head with tons of lace and pillows of foam lingering on top. Explosion of floral and fruity hops. NZ hops are unique so the Riwaka stand out but all three are easily discernible. Glad I got to try a beer with the elusive Riwaka. Sticky resin, pine, cedar, earth, wood, a few varieties of citrus...very complex but all hops at the same time. Like all of their beers it's way too smooth and easy to drink. Seriously. Such a creamy, full body. Every mouthful brings a smile. The flavors are so big and the hops are so intense. This beer is transcendent. I can't believe it's this good.

A - White foam settles to some wisps, a collar, and spotty lacework. Murky peach flesh-colored body. Fairly pale, as seems to be usual for these Hill Farmstead IPAs.
S - Lots of tropical fruits and citrus zest, with perhaps a touch of dank and onion. The Riwaka is fairly apparent. Fairly neutral malt backdrop; this one is all about the hops.
T - Zesty citrus, a bit of lemon peel, some mild herbal and dank notes, and juicy tropical fruits. Again, malt doesn't impart much else beyond some faint and nebulous sugary notes. High bitterness that is somewhat surprising for Hill Farmstead.
M - Smooth, medium body, medium-low carbonation, dry and crisp finish. No perceivable alcohol.
D - Another fine IPA from Shaun E. Hill. It's very easy to drink and has a really broad hop bouquet that covers all the bases. I could use perhaps a touch more malt sweetness to offset the high bitterness, but otherwise this is quite good. 986 charactersMasterSki, Dec 01, 2012

Slightly cloudy, golden body below the creamy head. Good lace, though not as sticky as other HF IPAs. Aroma like WHOA! Smells like I hollowed out a grapefruit and stuck my head inside. Fresh hops and citrus galore.
Unfortunately, the taste reminds me why I generally dislike Single IPAs: too much hop bite for my palate. Lacks the fruity magic from the nose, and the (very few) Single IPAs I enjoy possess this in spades.

Beer pours a hazy golden-orange with a moderate white head - looks like most other HF IPAs. Smell is a very nice citrus-forward aroma with a bit of grassiness, impressive, but I'm not sure it's quite up to the level of some of the best hoppy HF beers, it's not overpowering like I usually expect from these guys. Flavor takes it up a notch - this blend of hops, likely due to the Riwaka, gives it a pretty unique flavor profile, it's very citrusy up front and has a flavor I can't quite put my finger on (likely the Riwaka hop, which I haven't had much of). Finish is orange peel-y bitter. The beer isn't as big and hoppy as most of the HF IPAs are, particularly in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is another great beer from Hill Farmstead, but I think the fact that it's a single IPA instead of a DIPA keeps it from being a smash hit, as the flavor doesn't get as big as I'd hoped. That said, another well done, hoppy beer from HF. 1,027 charactersstarrdogg, Nov 30, 2012

A- A bright orangey mango color with a healthy white head. It's pretty murky and hazy, but still has a nice glow to it. It almost looks like some fruit juice of sorts.
S- Sweet hops and pineapple. Scents of mango and tangerine are also present. The smell is not terribly piney, but still has incredible depth. Not terribly strong, but what I'd expect from an IPA.
T- Extremely smooth at first, with a very nice blend of goodness that follows. A nice balance of citrus and sweet fruitiness. I get lots of tangerine and pineapple, with hints of hop pine. Finishes with a crisp dry hoppy finish, and a lemon hoppy aftertaste.
M- As always, spot on. Higher carbonation, but suits the style.
O- Overall, another solid IPA from Hill Farmstead. I definitely can see that this utilizes some of their different hop varieties, as it is a very interesting blend of sweet hoppiness with some bold dry flavor. It's a little dry to rank too high up on my list, but I would never complain about drinking this. 1,058 charactersGfunk720, Nov 29, 2012

Pours a cloudy murky light yellow golden color with a decent sized bone white head that slowly fades to a smattering of lace. That aroma is intoxicating, literally! Wiked old school citrus of grapefruit, orange, and lemon with pine with hints of resin. If there's malt in there I can't smell it, but shit I don't miss it, I've got a hop chubby. The flavor does hold some light bready malt but the citrus hop flavor is the dominatrix to my taste buds. Grapefruit, tropical fruits, tangerines, pine, resin its all there and it all melds together wonderfully. Smooth never harsh bitterness provides balance to the little malt I can find. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a smooth resinous mouthfeel. It doesn't look like much in the glass, but that's a damn fine beer right there. 844 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 27, 2012
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Growler thanks to Gosox8787, poured into a Hill Farmstead stem.
Pour: Complete hazy deep orange body. Perhaps the haziest Hill Farmstead IPA/DIPA I've had yet. Really nice white, fluffy, thick head. Head hangs around for quite a while, and provides really nice sticky lacing. Another beautiful beer.
Smell: Comes right out of the gate with juicy mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. A really nice citrus zest as well. Some pepper. A light bready malt comes in, but finishes with obvious pineapple.
Taste: Follows the nose on point. A ton of grapefruit and mangos. A really nice white pepper comes in from the citra. Sweetness is nice, but not too big, a little heavier than biscuity. A light resin comes in and it finishes with clean citrus juiciness.
Mouthfeel: Astonishingly juicy. More so than Abner in my opinion. Not quite S&S#5 level, but a more medium body than it. Bitterness is more of a supplement than really there. Fantastic.
Overall: Another absolute winner from Shaun Hill. Love the combo of these hops. Maybe could've done without Simcoe, but that's really nitpicking as much as I can. 1,102 characterscfrances33, Nov 26, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52L growler filled at the brewery exactly a week ago and kept refrigerated since being filled. Poured into HF glass.
A- Pours a hazy fairly opaque yellowish slightly brownish with about two fingers of foamy slightly fluffy thick head that coats the glass with thick lacing and has excellent retention slowly receding to a thing foamy layer. Nice carbonation of consistently rising carbonation bubbles.
S- Lots of grapefruit, pine, hops, and some pineapple fruitiness. Definitely well above average aroma strength, the grapefruit hits you right away which is balanced nicely with a pineapple fruit.
T- Fairly strong presence of dry grapefruit balanced with piney hops following with some lightly juicy pineapple, a faint hint of sweet malts, and a slightly bitter finish. Lingering aftertaste of grapefruit and pine. Fairly strong hop presence that lends a lot of flavor. Nice balance between all the hop varietals, I can definitely distinguish the Citra, Riwaka, and a little bit of the Simcoe hops coming out.
M- Medium bodied, goes down very easily, nice carbonation, slightly dry with a juicy finish. The awesome retention of the head adds a little bit of creaminess.
O- This is another phenomenal IPA from HF, possibly one of their best. At the brewery we did a tasting between this, Abner, and SS5 and we thought although all of them were great Susan beat out the other two slightly. I could easily drink this all the time and it's one of the best IPAs I've had. I definitely recommend trying it if you get the chance especially if you like IPAs with a strong grapefruit presence. 1,589 charactersjaasen64, Nov 24, 2012
4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My homebrew buddy picked up a 22oz growler of this at the Brewery a week ago.
Pours a cloudy orange/honey, thin creamy white head lasts the whole brew. Leaves some webbing.
The smell is remarkable, super tropical, mango, apricots and peaches come to mind. Maybe papaya, a little bit of piney notes too. 
Taste follows nose, lots of kiwi, pineapple, some grapefruit, lemon grass, also some herbal and piney notes. Very sweet citrus tropical fruits. Maybe some clementines. Pretty bitter but also has a nice honey/pie crust malt backbone thats barely present. Pretty complex and quite flavorful. Definitely a lot of citra in here. 
Nice smooth sipper, rich creamy full bodied mouthfeel, high carbonation. Medium "drink-ability".
O An Awesome brew, really hope I get to try more hill farmstead, dont find many IPAs like this these days. 838 charactersBigCheese, Nov 24, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from 750 ML swing top into an oversized wine glass...maybe a brandy glass? 
A- Great goldish and orangeish color. Pretty solid fluffy white head
S- Smell is amazing, citrus, floral hops, one of the best smells for a single IPA. Definitely top tier IPA without a doubt. Smell is similar to that of sculpin, maine beer co lunch or RR Blind Pig.
T- Taste is perfect, very herbal and citrusy, but great IPA notes, great balance of hops and malt, perfectly balanced and very refreshing. 
M- Smooth mouthfeel, very full and not lacking anything. 
O- The best single IPA I think I have had to date. Very fresh and I the drinkability is amazing. 649 charactersomniscientcause, Nov 23, 2012
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Tyler for this one. 22oz. growler into a Lawson's pint glass. 
Pours a .5 finger white, creamy head with good retention. Beer is a cloudy, murky papaya and pale orange. Lacing is patchy and thick with great cling. Real pretty beer considering its unfiltered. 
Nose is clean and simple. Grapefruit, hop resin, citrus sweetness, and a mellow grassiness. Moderately aromatic. Nice. 
Opens citrus, pine, and cane sugar. Some papaya and other tropical fruits provide a nice malt backbone against a mellow hop bitterness. Finishes citrus and resin with a light sappy hop aftertaste. Really refreshing. 
Light bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Slick, smooth and slightly lively in the mouth. Goes down quenching. Slightly messy finish with a moderately dry, sticky aftertaste. Awesome!
This is pretty in line with the rest of the HF pale ale offerings... namely incredibly balanced and drinkable. Really just a well crafted ipa in every sense that showcases each of the hop varities infused into it. 1,014 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 22, 2012

4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Need to thank Dr. H for this treat. Poured from 750 growler into my 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very cloudy orange yellow, with a two inch sticky off white head, leaves loads of lacing behind. Smell is heavenly mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and pineapple. Taste is all of that, with a grapefruit finish. Body is thinner than I expected, not overly carbonated, not dry, and very drinkable. This another treasure from one of the great users of citra hops. Vermont can brew IPAs. 478 charactersSawDog505, Nov 21, 2012

4.96/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Was fortunate enough to have Susan back when it debuted in NYC at at the Blind Tiger last November, along with a handful of other HF rarities. The scene was absolute chaos, with the entire place packed floor-to-ceiling and people ordering as many as four 12-ounce pours at a time for themselves; I’ve never seen anything quite like it. I was fortunate enough to score a seat at the bar about 10 minutes before keg-tapping, and got my hands on one of the first pours of Susan ever in Manhattan. Glad I got it when I did, because the sixtel kicked in 30 minutes. 
Bursting with all of the wonderful citrus flavor and aroma of many of my favorite IPAs, I quickly realized what Susan reminded me of more than anything else — Zombie Dust. Citra is the star of the Susan show, but it’s also a showcase for Riwaka and Simcoe. To date, Susan is one of the few beers I’ve had that has given Zombie Dust a true run for its money. Absolutely one of the finest IPAs I've ever drank. 979 charactersLarryK, Nov 19, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Susan: several tastings compiled to one review. On draft sample (1st sample I tried at 12:30pm w/ clean palate) into HF sampling glass, 750 &lt; 8hrs old into wide mouth wine glass, 750 24hrs old kept chilled into HF stemware.
A: Pours a cloudy light orange with frothy white head measuring perhaps 2 fingers (maybe 1.5). Lots of lacing and a remaining layer of head throughout the experience. Typically awesome HF look on this one. Looks like Edward and maybe the Riwaka and Simcoe single hop APAs they've done recently. Approaching but not quite as dark as S&S4.
S: A blast of tropical fruits, sweet orange/tangerine, lemon zest(?), slight whiff of pale malt, more candy-like tropical fruit. I don't know what passionfruit smells like, but this might be it. Pineapple, definitely getting pineapple now. Slight flowery scent over the tropihop fruit back. Unreal nose! 5+
T: Taste doesn't have quite as much of the tropical punch that the aroma does, but still more than 99% of hoppy beers out there. Orange, citrus, lemon zest again and some grapefruit the finish has Riwaka written all over it. Awesomely subtle and lingering bitterness, but not palate wrecking by any stretch.
M: Soft, FLUFFY (Fluffhead?), gorgeous mouth feel with great drinkability. Just enough sweetness from the malts weaving with the creeping bitterness. Not cloying at all. Not "dry" per se. I want another sip.
O: I could drink this beer everyday. The aroma is the best part, but the others elements are just behind. I love this beer. Get some. 1,526 charactersjraras, Nov 19, 2012

4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Presentation: 750 mL growler filled fresh from the brewery yesterday and kept chilled since then. Poured into a pint glass.
Appearance: Pours a really agressive, creamy three finger head with great retention. Cloudy yellow/orange in color (a lot like Edward and some of their other single hop offerings). 
Aroma: Tons of tropical fruit and ctirus notes upfront. Pineapple and mango notes really stand out. I am getting a touch of the Simcoe hop note in there as well that really tempers the tropical fruit notes.
Taste: The Citra and Riwaka hops offer some really great tropical notes. Lots of pineapple and mango with some orange zest and grapefruit. Not as sweet as the aroma suggests. Some pretty agressive grapefruit and bitter hop notes. As it warms more, the aggressive grapefruit bitterness builds nicely. Easy drinking and refreshing.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a nice creaminess. Really nice, bright carbonation.
Overall, a really nice, fresh IPA with a nice tropical background. Really nicely balanced with a more bitter finish than I expected. Not only refreshing but this grew on me as I drank it. I think I still prefer Edward to this but it is definitely a really nice beer. 1,195 charactersGosox8787, Nov 18, 2012
