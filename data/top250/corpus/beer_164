Could I drink more than a couple glasses? Probably not. Would I like to drink this any other time before the end of the day? Probably not. Is this one of the best porters I've had period? For sure. Its sweetness is both simultaneously appealing and differentiating but puts it in my personal category of a night cap-beer. Beautiful black body with a puffy, two-notch head that dissipates and leaves a nice trail of lacing. Aroma is out of this world - coconut, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, brownie and fudge. It literally perfumes the air around the bottle top. Taste is coconut, fudge, bitter chocolate, coffee, smoke, char and brownie. Smooth to a level that's hard to top. Outrageous. Finishes with a nicely sweet and slightly bitter aftertaste. World class. 850 charactersManapuaMan, May 11, 2017

The aroma is intense coconut, a little coffee and a sweet rich dark chocolate. I could dig my nose in this all day,incredible nose.
The flavor is quite a bit more nuanced, there is a great brown sugar and molasses flavor. It's got a great dark rich malty and chocolatey sweetness giving way to a blast of coconut. The coffee blends well and stays blended in the flavor. 
It's an outstanding beer, I'll be seeking it out again for sure. 491 charactersScott17Taylor, Apr 23, 2017

Black in the glass with a finger's tan head.  Lovely but short-lived tan lacing.
Aroma is strong coconut, then the coffee and caramel.  
Coconut again dominates on the first sip, coffee, toffee, fig.  Sweet tasting initially, drier with nut and malt notes as it warms.  
Smooth and full bodied, consistent carbonation.
Love to get this year round. 393 charactersReef, Apr 16, 2017

Appearance is jet black with amber around the edges. The tan head is a beautiful one finger thick with decent retention, especially around the edges of the glass.
Smell is straight coconut with lightly roasted coffee, butter, toffee, and some caramel malt. It reminds me of cutting open a coconut for a mixed drink on the beach, absolutely awesome.
Taste still has a ton of coconut, but there is more chocolate and roasted coffee than in the aroma. The flavors work together in complete harmony. I'm getting some lactose as well as the caramel malt. Bitterness is fairly low for the style with moderate sweetness that is perfectly executed.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly watery yet slightly chewy (extremely smooth). Carbonation is fairly low, bit there a nice transition through the finish. Very good feel, but I'm curious how an imperial version would taste.
Overall this is the best coconut beer that I have had and a really good Porter all the way around, so much more coconut comes through. Tons of flavor but not too heavy to drink at the beach, perfect execution. I highly appreciate trying this beer. 1,246 charactersthatche2, Apr 15, 2017

Wow, smell just pops with coconut and coffee--these attributes are so prominent, but there's also a little buttery toffee.
Taste is closer to caramel popcorn, with toffee, mocha coffee, and softly toasted coconut.
Soft, frothy, medium bodied, and wet.
A total indulgence that somehow is not too sweet. 383 charactersSabtos, Mar 18, 2017

I sure hope that this one is good as well. I am fan of what Funky Buddha, I must go and visit the brewery. Poured the beer rather vigorously, it produced a one and half finger medium tan head. The head is creamy and foamy with okay retention. The color of the beer is motor oil and opaque. I do see some carbonation but most of it is hiding within. 
It smells like an almond joy candy bar. Milk chocolate, medium roasted coffee, coconut, roasted malt, citrus, grass, and some fruity notes. 
The coffee note is pronounced at first sip, I get some milk chocolate, toffee, grass, and some fruity notes on the back end. 
A full body porter but medium body with some carbonation and a full finish. 
This beer is super tasty. It smells likes an Almond Joy. The only complaint I have about it is the beer is not balance. Now just here me out, when I was drink the beer I can get coffee on the front, then coconut, and then chocolate. When I tried the Maple Bacon Porter, the flavors melded together seamlessly. Yes, this is a very good beer and I enjoyed drinking it. 1,160 characterscolts9016, Mar 13, 2017

Oh my, wonderfully sweet notes of vanilla, chocolate, coconut, and coffee greet the nose with a gentle embrace.
The coconut while apparent in aroma comes out a bit more subtle in flavor but adds a bit of complexity to the delicious notes of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla.
Full-bodied, low carbonation, sweet, creamy, warm, and soothing.
Overall, there's not much to say other than this beer is phenomenal. Get your hands on this. 560 characterslarryarms847, Mar 11, 2017

Smell is a robust array of aromas - coffee, coconut, chocolate cake, marshmallows, and sweat creamer. Its like a coconut chocolate cake. The coconut is there and there is tons of it, but it doesn't take on that sun tan lotion aroma that it often does in lesser beers.
Taste follows the nose with strong coconut notes giving way to coffee notes followed by milk chocolate, more coconut, caramel, sweat creamer, marshmallow and a hint of coca cola. Beer is super sweet - bordering on cloying to my palate. Some roasted malts come through on the back end, but no bitterness. For what it is supposed to be, its really well done. But boy is this a sweet beer. 
Feel is remarkably light and almost thin. Medium carbonation but slightly prickly in the mouth. Smooth and somehow kind of refreshing? It really is a perfect winter beer for a warmer climate. 
Overall this is a beer unto itself. But its Funky Buddha so you have to expect a super sweet beer.  The most impressive part of this for me was how well done the coconut was in here - not artificial or sun tan lotion-y at all. Well done beer. 1,266 charactersFBarber, Jan 31, 2017

S: Coconut, cocoa and coffee
T:  Coconut is up front. There is coffee but no bitterness from the coffee.  Hints of cocoa, marshmallows and a tiny bit of peanut.  As it warms there is a slight cinnamon taste.
MF: Very full and creamy.  Thick but not heavy.  Dessert like but not sweet.  
O:  It would be easy to chalk this beer up as just another coconut porter.  However, there is so much more to this beer.  It is incredibly well made.  There are a multitude of elements that compete for your attention but none overtake the beer.  A great example of what can be done with an adjunct porter. 663 charactersSammyJaxxxx, Jan 02, 2017

on tap @ World of Beer, Lady Lake, FL on 12/26/2016
$9 / snifter
Wow, over the past few days I've tasted what might be the perfect trifecta of dessert beers, and all from Funky Buddha! I started with their "Strawberry Shortcake", moved forward to their cocoa-flavored "Nib Smuggler", and finished with "Last Snow". Of course this wasn't exactly by accident, they're all released towards the end of the year.
"Last Snow" delivers a bold aroma of coconut over fresh coffee, and that follows into the flavor. If that was all that there was it would still be fantastic in and of itself, but there's also a dusting of winter spices beyond that that puts it over the edge and into greatness. Additionally, even with coffee (which can be acidic) and spice (which can be overdone, and bitter) it remains balanced - it's not acidic or bitter, nor is it sweet - although clearly, as I've called it a dessert beer, there is some sweetness there. Of the three beers I mentioned though, I'd say that this one is the one that crosses over into being more of a regular, everyday drinkable beer (except for the coconut, which is gonzo!). 
If you can find it don't pass it by, and I'd suggest it's also well worth seeking out. 1,245 charactersNeroFiddled, Dec 27, 2016

Thick creamy khaki colored head,consisting of small to large bubbles.Good head retention.Dark black in color,with no light coming through the glass.Light carbonation.
On the nose I get a ton of coconut ,toffee,hazelnut,sweet malts,and coffee.
The palate follows the nose.Tons of coconut,with some hazelnut,sweet malts,and toffee.
The body is medium heavy,with a wet finish.A little bit of carbonation fizzle.
This is a very good porter...I usually hate coconut beer,but it wasn't overpowering,and was well blended with the other flavors. 588 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Dec 23, 2016

Smells of coconut, brown sugar, toffee, woody notes, molasses, coffee grinds, sweet malt and more coconut. The coconut aroma is ridiculously great to inhale, this is a real treat.
Tastes of very strong coconut up front, with brown sugar, coffee grinds, syrup, sweet malt, caramel, lightly toasted grains and molasses. Sweet but delicious at the same time, with the coconut continuing to be the star of the show. A great tasting porter, it has nutty notes and some chocolate kick in right before the sweetness starts to fade and the brew flows down smoothly. Flows down easy, it was a pleasure to drink and improved as it warmed up. My new favorite porter.
5/6/2017: Cracked open one bottled 02/02/17 and again it pours pitch black color with a tan head which was 2 fingers thick and packed with tiny bubbles, fading slowly and leaving good lacing and rings as it went down. Drank the whole bottle myself and both pours had the same appearance, which was better than the first time I had it - raised the "Look" score from 4 to 4.25. It smells perfect again with strong coconut, molasses, coffee grinds, sweet malt, brown sugar, toffee, woody notes, more coconut and then like icing that you get on donuts. The coconut is great to inhale and makes this beer so special.
Tastes just as good as the first time with very strong coconut up front, then coffee grinds, syrup, metallic notes, sweet malt, heavy cream, toasted coconut (like on coconut shrimp), caramel, toasted grains, cocoa powder, vanilla bean and molasses. Sweet but not cloying and wonderfully complex and delicious. Flowed down easy again, in fact too easy as I wanted to sip it but it went down like coconut water. So damn good that I'm raising the "Taste" score from 4.5 to 4.75.
Overall I had this rated 5 for a total "Rating" of 4.69, but the better "Look" and "Taste" scores pushed it up to 4.81. A fantastic brew and by far my favorite from Funky Buddha. I could drink this every week if I could get it that often. Seek it out!! 2,097 charactersCHickman, Dec 04, 2016

Look: black body with light reddish ring around the edges. Very light khaki, frothy head
Smell: The nose wafted throughout the room and really packs a punch. Heavy coconut with slightly more subdued chocolate and coffee accents. Could enjoy this smell all-day
Taste: Rich, decadent, sweet and creamy chocolate/coconut. Coffee provides a nutty flavor. This is liquid Almond Joy
Feel: Not thick but a full, buttery smooth texture
Overall: Dessert-like qualities that satisfy a sweet tooth - the perfect beer after dinner or for a nightcap. 583 charactersDatdubj1988, Dec 03, 2016

Smell is phenomenal, like roasted coconuts almost like an almond joy minus the sweetness.
Taste is much the same though the coffee comes through a bit more here. The flavor is slightly less than the smell would suggest.
Feel is near perfect for a porter imo but a tad on the thin side.
Overall fantastic offering from FB! Props @Davidjkeeney for hooking this one up! 522 charactersBeantownBrews, Nov 16, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25"Last Snow Coconut & Coffee Porter is an ode to that special time in Florida where the needle dips just south of 75 - even for the briefest of moments. This rich, creamy porter is layered with coconut and freshly-roasted coffee for a taste that recalls a winter wonderland - even if, in our state, that's just a state of mind." Brewed in the style of an American Porter with  coconut, coffee and natural flavor added. Available in 22 oz. bottles and seasonal draft.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle to a snifter glass.
(Appearance) Pours a creamy foam head of a cinnamon tan complexion over a very dark brown, near black body. Retention is very good and lacing is light and spotty. 4.25
(Smell) Aromatic nose with rich, toasted coconut cream aroma forward, lightly roasted coffee bean, subtle chocolate, and rich vanilla cream undertones. Very dessert-like, but nicely balanced and highly complex. Potency is moderate. 4.25
(Taste) The flavor comes through as richly as the aroma, with rich, velvety coconut milk sweetness forward, a touch of lactose and vanilla, before merging to a rich, gently roasted coffee finish, complete with cinnamon spice, for a very rounded and complex, but very well executed flavor. 4.5
(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, silky, lightly oily, medium dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a medium frothiness and a lightly crisp finish. Body is medium+ for the style, medium/heavy overall. Balance is nearly even sweet to earthy and toasty bitterness. Alcohol presence is light and there are no off characters. 4
(Overall) Last Snow is really quite an incredible tasting beer with a lot of velvety coconut cream flavor and texture- it is becoming a pleasant surprise to see coconut making an appearance in more American Porters lately, and this one does a great job at showcasing its flavor potential. The coffee makes for a nice, rich finish and compliments the beer and style nicely. Perhaps the biggest gripe is that this beer drinks a little less quickly than a porter traditionally does- this beer inches closer to a stout than other examples, but considering the quality of this beer overall, it isn't much of an issue. Worth seeking out, great first exposure for me from this brewery. 4.25

Appearance was dark almost pitch black with a small head.  
Smell was incredible.  Coconut was very strong, possibly a roasted coconut.  Slight chocolate mixed in.  
Taste was exactly as the smell.  Huge coconut blast upfront with slight chocolate. Coconut is close to over powering in my belief.  
Mouthfeel was as expected.  Mild bodied somewhat light.  
Overall this is an incredible flavor blast of a Porter.   If the coconut was somehow scaled back slightly but keeping the other great attributes this would personally be a much better beer. 575 characterssorthcj, Nov 11, 2016

Build for cooler weather, snowy evenings and the need for a nightcap by the fire, their winter warmer starts with a bold porter base and layers it with copious amounts of coconut and chocolate.
Expectedly dark brown and with a rich swirl of latte froth, the beer's dessert-like scent is full of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, coconut and chocolate. With a pep of coffee and nuttiness, the taste opens sultry with decadent sweetness, redolent with Mounds candies.
The sweetness of the porter slathers the middle palate with booze-soaked sugars, lightly seared and boldly toasted, the richness of bittersweet chocolate, toffee, caramel, vanilla and nougat saturates the tastebuds with the satisfaction of German chocolate, walnut brownie and shaved, toasted, candied coconut. A nutty finish brings elements of nutty columbian coffee and a kiss of rum to the finish.
Rich, decadent and lavishly full in body, the beer's imperialized strength is met with lingering sweetness and creaminess in body. Balanced with peppery booze, its rum-like influence is front and center in finish. A long undercurrent of chocolate and coconut trail into a deep and satisfying aftertaste. 1,280 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 01, 2016

4.3/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4L- Looks great. Dark brown to black color with a creamy brown head. 
S- Explosive toasted coconut with bits of chocolate and coffee. 
T- Aggressive flavors, even a bit too aggressive in my opinion. Lots of coconut and dark chocolate. A bit of coffee and a milk chocolate background. I'd like it quite a bit more if they dialed the coconut down from a 10 to an 8, and a little more milk chocolate than bittersweet. I solo'd a bottle, but I'm not sure I could do that on a regular basis without flavor fatigue. 
F- The feel is fine. I know it's a porter, but I still want a bit more creaminess and/or thickness. It still has a smooth, decently full mouthfeel and a good carbonation level. 
O- It's a good brew that I could see myself grabbing every once in a while. I definitely enjoyed the aroma, it's worth it just for that. I would need a little more balance in the flavors to make it a regular though. 907 charactersZoomslowik, Oct 11, 2016

Wow! The coconut is not a gimmick; it comes soaring through on the nose, accompanied by vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and toast.
Flavor follows: nice notes of chocolate, roast, and coffee, with vanilla shot throughout and a huge wave of coconut that builds, shines, but never quite overwhelms.
This is like a flavored iced coffee. It's unbelievably drinkable.
Body is smooth but still full.

4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: Beer comes in a dark brown color with about a finger and half of light mocha head that sticks around for a while. Decent lacing on the glass. Not particularly thick or sludgey, but quite appealing in appearance.
S: INSANE amounts of toasted coconut bursting out of the glass. Rich, sweet, freshly toasted coconut. Nothing artificial about it. Underlying this is a smooth coffee note. Again, nothing bitter or off-putting; just a clean, subtle, coffee flavor that supports the overwhelming amount of coffee. Not much malt sweetness or roastiness, and not a hint of alcohol.
T: Follows the nose up front. Again, just ridiculous amounts of toasted coconut smacks the palate. Coffee comes in a bit stronger than on the nose, with a mildly peppery bitterness. Hints of milk chocolate come in on the aftertaste and linger with the coconut flavor for long after the sip, coating the mouth with rich, potent flavors reminiscent of a much bigger beer.
M: Extremely smooth and drinkable. Medium-light mouthfeel with an effervescent carbonation of tiny bubbles. Glides across the tongue without much weight, yet leaves a mouth-coating flavor that isn't indicative of its ABV. It's not particularly creamy, and during the middle of the taste (between the initial punch of flavor and the lingering aftertase), it feels a tinge watery. This isn't necessarily unexpected given the ABV, but it's the only area in which I'd really dock this beer.
O: Wow. This is by far the best porter I've had and perhaps the best non-imperial stout/porter I've ever had as well. The intensity of aroma and flavor on this is simply unbelievable given the ABV on this. I'm lucky to have tried this fresh (only a few weeks after bottling), but I imagine this will drink well for months to come. The smooth, almost decadent coconut flavors are so delicious, and the coffee/chocolate notes provide perfect complements to prevent this from being a one-note wonder. If the mouthfeel were a bit thicker and the carbonation a bit smoother, this would be pretty close to perfect for the style. As it stands, it's not far off! 2,091 charactersavas, Oct 07, 2016

Pour: dark brown. Leads with a big nose: coconut, whipping cream, sweet hazelnut. When you put them together, you get equal parts drool & anticipation. 
Last Snow: did you know August is the only month there has never been snow reported in MN? OK, it might have been July, but still. Lovely coconut up front before the coffee/roast kicks in, with a shot of hazelnut creamer. Sweet cream, bitterness, distant chocolate come mid-palate. Coconut, roast coat everything they touch, & this is disappearing rapidly. 
Amazingly tasty & well balanced, as the multiple additions don’t overwhelm the base beer, but caress it with gentle lovingness. Excellent brew. 815 charactersmaximum12, Aug 07, 2016

Taste: fresh medium roast coffee middle of the mouth coconut a hint of cinnamon milk chocolate finishes with a slight dark chocolate and more coconut 
Feel: medium body very creamy a bit waterd down the body is a bit of a let down.
Overall: the smell is awesome but the taste is a bit of a let down still really good. The bottles is not the freshest so I'll have to re review this when I get a fresh bottle. 502 charactersMasonz223, Jul 31, 2016

3.62/5  rDev -18.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.522oz bottle, most recent release, poured into a Funk Buddha oversized snifter glass. Enjoyed on 7.7.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a nice jet black color, cola brown hues, opaque, but not overly viscous. A thick, khaki head, about two fingers high appears with good retention yielding plenty of soapy lace. The aroma is fantastic, huge coffee profile, rich, dark chocolate, toasted coconut, mild roast, nicely balanced, rich without being cloying or too decadent, just really inviting and approachable. The flavors are unfortunately disappointing. The booming coffee in the nose is very tame on the tongue, and very bitter, dry, overly roasty with only a tiny smidge of toasted coconut, though it feels a bit artificial. The chocolate character is decent, more bittersweet than smooth and rich with a strong grainy finish that is rather bland. The mouthfeel is another weak spot, a bit thin, lighter body, lively carbonation that struggles to coat the tongue and finishes softly with a light dry bite. 
Verdict: A decent adjunct porter from Funky Buddha, certainly not in the same league as some of their stronger beers. The flavoring of this beer just reads a bit artificial and isn't as impactful as the aroma leads on, and at 6.4%, I wasn't expecting a monster body, but I was still surprised at how little texture and backbone this beer had. While I'm sure it will please some, there are a number of better similarly built porters that I would go for first. 1,482 characterskevanb, Jul 10, 2016

A - oily dark brown, minimal tan head

T - Just like the nose, huge coconut, but terribly artificial tasting - not necessarily awful, just very artificial. 
M - Thin to medium 
O - Not a bad beer by any means but tastes more like a novelty than anything remotely world class. 414 charactersjtirpak22, Jun 08, 2016

Looks wise is like the rest but doesn't coat the glass due to the more watery in nature feel.  Taste wise it was good as there was zero bitterness on the tongue but the feel was watery and light, guessing you can't really go deeper into the feel unless you change a lot.
This beer is an A+ if you only based it on the smell which is coconut heaven.  Probably one of the best smelling beers I've had the luxury to try.  But the rest of the beer is a disappointment to the hype I was getting from it.
I would try this beer only if I was sharing it with 3+ other people. 623 charactersBEEPOP, May 15, 2016

L-very dark brown, with a light tan head, pretty minimal lacing
S-toasted coconut is very present with the smell along with a hint of coffee and milk chocolate
T-the coffee really comes out in the taste with a pretty evenly well done balance with smooth milk chocolate and the toasted coconut
F-pretty thin. very drinkable
O-a really nice unique beer, which is expected from FBB.  A little overrated IMO, but certainly a fantastic beer. 485 charactersrabbott2, Apr 11, 2016
4.63/5  rDev +4%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Found this at a bottle shop in Talahassee in a Houston to Orlando road trip. Funky Buddha and Cigar City was pretty much all I was ISO. Let's see what the hypes about.
Pour is a black, very dark brown pour. Noticable red hue in the light. Not very motor oil thick at all, definitely more on the thin side like a typical porter. Big khaki colored bubbles, not thin bubbles at all. Very sticky lacing.
Wow, aroma is noticed as soon as I cracked the bottle. Straight burnt coconut. Plenty of coffee and cream. Smells like a Starbucks. Nice caramel as well. Cookies straight out the oven. This is probably the sweetest aroma of any beer I've ever had. Amazing.
Taste is more coffee foward. Hints of coconut, dark chocolate. Some lingering bitterness. Pretty rich and creamy. 
Mouthfeel is thin as expected with the pour, but doesn't make a difference with the taste. Moderate carbonation.
Overall one of the richest most sweetest aromas in a beer I've ever had. If the taste matched it 100% it would be flawless. But it's okay, still very rich, coconut-robust and coffee bitterness is still great. 1,098 charactersMateo2699, Apr 11, 2016
4.35/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25My first Funky Buddha beer, and pretty apt considering it was snowing this weekend. This weather sucks. This is a coconut and coffee porter.
Appearance - Pours a dark brown with a tan head. A large, billowing head envelops the rim of the glass before slowly bubbling away.
Aroma - The aroma is straight coconut, similar in vein to Oskar Blue's Death by Coconut, almost eerily so. Underneath the coconut is a touch of coffee and a good amount of caramel. As it warms, more chocolate notes come through that couple nicely with the coffee.
Taste - The taste is a bit more heavy on the coffee, which helps to balance all of the coconut. It is very potent and the caramel flavor makes it taste like a liquid Samoa cookie. This is a decadent, rich beer and serves as a nice warmer in this cold snap of weather. 
Mouthfeel - Last Snow's mouthfeel is medium-bodied with low carbonation. A study backbone but not overly thick. 
Closing Arguments - Overall, this probably moves to the top of the list for my favorite coconut-flavored beers. If you are looking for coconut, look no further. I wish there was more coffee flavor, but what is there is quite nice. 1,154 charactersnhindian, Apr 11, 2016

At least I saved this libation for the right occasion. 
Coconut brown with eggplant on the horizons. 
Pleasantly straight forward in aroma and taste. Sweet coconut milk with some chocolatey, coffee malt. In fact, remind me of a milk stout with its smoothness and sweetness. Surprising sour, woody, and resiny. I've only had a few other coconut flavored beers, but their flavor seemed synthetic. Nothing sham about the robust coconut flavor here. It has just enough coffee roast on the back to not be cloying. Otherwise, it's very slick and smooth feeling with a big body. 764 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Apr 04, 2016

S: all of the added flavors are having a party on the nose. Unbelievable. Not too sweet on the nose.
T: artificial flavors, and weak artificial flavors at that. However, they are strong enough to cloud out the characteristics of the porter. One of the greatest smell-to-taste disappointments I've ever had. 
F: watery.

Look: Nearly pitch black, retaining faint caramel highlights in the light. Has a thin ring of white lacing that soon lapses into nothing.
Smell: Toasted coconut, sweet milk chocolate, coffee, and caramel.
Feel: Full bodied, thick, creamy, and smooth with a little carbonation.
Taste: Toasted coconut, milk chocolate, and caramel make up the taste of this. Very sweet, but has a lingering bitterness throughout.
Overall: This has been my most anticipated beer since I started last year, and my brother managed to score a bottle for us. Wow, this is just like a liquid Almond Joy candy bar. Tons of sweet flavors, but has a lingering bitterness through it, I guess to remind the drinker its a beer. 801 charactersBonkinishwa, Mar 23, 2016

Smells insane. Tons of sweet, flaky toasted coconut, and candy bar chocolate and roasted malts. 
That coconut really owns the flavors, but for as domiant as it is, it does not taste artificial or too overbearing. There is a nice balance with the bittersweet chocolate. The coffee notes are pretty subdued and the malts don't fight through cofonut and chocolate as much as I would like to see, but it still is a great tasting beer. 
You would never guess that this is only 6.5%. What a great body. Silky and creamy with a nice heft. 
Outstanding brew. The best flavored porter I have come across. 672 charactersWesMantooth, Mar 20, 2016

The coconut also dominates the taste, but the coffee, caramel, chocolate, and sweetness help balance it out.  Drinks much heavier than a 6.5% beer.  Excellent porter.  First offering from FB.....will definitely seek out more. 327 characterslemmy187, Mar 12, 2016

Tons of chocolate, roasted coffee, and coconut on the nose. Taste follows the smell. Huge coconut at the start that turns into chocolate roasted coffee and all comes together perfectly at the end. Deliciously lingers on the tongue, cheeks and in the nasal cavity. Actually tastes like a liquid Mounds or Almond Joy bar. This will be the best coconut beer you've ever had even if you hate coffee. The hype is well deserved. First thing I told my friend was "This blows away Death By Coconut." (a stellar beer in its own right). Funky Buddha nailed it with Last Snow. 661 charactersToastedB, Feb 18, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Funky Buddha tulip glass. Acquired in a trade.
Pours a deep brown body with cherry highlights with a light brown 2 finger head that reduces to leave spotty lacing and a ring of foam. Not thick and inky, very porter-like. 
Aromas are mind-blowingly inviting! This is one of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Rich coconut, light coffee, and chocolate. Mostly coconut though. Tons of coconut. 
On the tongue there's more.. you guessed it, coconut, light coffee, milk chocolate, almond joy, and maybe some vanilla. Again, mostly coconut but not in a bad way, very delectable. Finish is subtly bitter, probably from the coffee. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but I can't knock it because it's a porter. Sip demanding. Medium carbonation. 
Awesome beer. Surpassed my expectations. If you like coconut, you'll like this. 852 charactersgcamparone, Feb 06, 2016

From a bomber into a snifter
Porter with coconut, coffee and natural flavors 
APPEARANCE: Clear brown pour yields a three finger, medium looking, creamy, light tan head with great retention. Clear bistre brown body with a bit of carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a full cap and coats the sides of the glass with lacing as it recedes. Splotchy wisp remains and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: You can actually smell some coconut off the pour. Coffee is there for sure, sweet vanilla cream, milk chocolate and lots of coconut on the nose. Plenty of coconut and the coffee adds a touch of roast to the profile. Pretty nice.  
TASTE: Coconut up front, with sweet vanilla and some roasted coffee notes as well. The coconut is definitely dominant at this stage, with more of it through the middle into the swallow. A bold and lingering finish of coconut, milk chocolate, vanilla, some coffee bitterness, a touch of roasted grain and caramel sweetness. Lots of coconut lingers on the palate. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes a touch dry. Good stuff here as well. 
OVERALL: Nice all around. Really enjoyed this, and the coconut character was really nice. The coffee was actually a little outplayed here, or perhaps it’s faded over time. In any case, this was more enjoyable and had a better, less watery mouth-feel than the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter bomber I had a while back. Would very much like to drink this again at some point. Recommended. 1,602 charactersJeffo, Jan 27, 2016

4.48/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Received this in trade with BA CosmicFarmer. I enjoyed a small pour of it at a bottle share I attended earlier in the year and loved it--I needed to get a bottle to see if I was just feeling the effects of the share or if it was really as good as I remember. Poured out of a 22 oz brown bomber into a large brandy snifter.
Appearance (4.25) - Pours a rather thin-looking cola color (thinner than I remembered) that looks a much darker mahogany hue after it accumulates in the glass. When held up to the light, those cola highlights are visible around the edges. Atop the body sits a finger or slightly less of sepia colored head that hangs around for a minute or so before fading away to some intermittent film across the surface of the glass and no lacing to speak of.
Smell (5.0) - Instantly, that rich, sweet-smelling coconut aroma invades my olfactory, so rich that it gets close to being too much. Notes of sweet coconut candy, dark chocolate, cocoa butter and veins of caramelly sweetness all coming through. In many ways, it smells like someone made a candy bar beer, but oddly doesn't come off as too sweet, which is something I can't quite explain. I will say that towards the end of the bottle, that intoxicating aroma almost becomes overwhelming.
Taste (4.25) - Honestly, the taste of this beer is very good, but I've docked it a little bit because it's so muted in comparison to the intoxicating smell. Many of the same elements are present: coconut is right up front and the dominant profile, and it's less sweet that the aroma suggested. The sweetness comes through more in the form of notes of white and milk chocolate, caramel and some hints of vanilla. Honestly, I don't get a lot of the coffee from the smell or the taste--it's completely drowned out by the coconut and chocolate flavors.
Feel  (4.25) - Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation and a lingering almost oily feeling on the tongue that I often get with coconut beers.
Overall (4.5), this has been a case study in first impressions and the subjective nature of taste. Having this beer again, in larger quantities and with a less palate burnout at play than I did seven months ago really allowed me to identify what made me love the beer and which parts fell a little short. My mind fell in love with the unbelievable aroma the first time and that masked the other parts of the beer which, while still good, did not live up to the smell. It's still the most coconut beer I think I've ever had, although I believe that part of that comes from the fact that coconut can be a delicate and tough-to-master flavor. It's one of those flavors where eating natural, fresh coconut can somehow taste less like coconut to the brain than something like a coconut-infused dessert. The sugar seems to bring out the flavor similar to how salt brings out flavor in a savory dish. But all that aside, it's one of the best-smelling beers I've ever enjoyed and that alone is enough to make it worthy of its high ranking, imho. 2,998 charactersLambicPentameter, Jan 06, 2016

The nose is complex so much that it hard for me to tell what I am actually getting. Maybe coconut maybe vanilla. The taste follows the nose for me very complex with no one flavor coming through. I'd have to say the coconut may be the most prevalent flavor but with the other tastes it hard to pull a lot out of this. This is a good porter but not what I had expected from the ratings. 430 characterssmanson56, Jan 02, 2016

Aromas of coffee and coconut dominate.  Am getting cocoa when cold and vanilla when warm.
Taste follows the nose with coffee and coconut, cocoa, malt, sugar, and a mildly bitter finish.
Mouthful is medium to light and a bit creamy with a semi dry lingering finish.
A very very enjoyable beer that is exactly as described between coffee and coconut flavors.  The nose is great along with a exceptional body.  Seek this out. 497 charactersSlack, Dec 31, 2015

Smell: so much coconut. Dark chocolate. Literally just like a mounds bar. Hint of fresh ground coffee.
Taste: richer taste than smell. Not as much coconut; more of the roasted cocoa. Slight bitter after taste.
Feel: quite the bite on the tongue. Not what I expect with a dark beer like this. Lingers for a few seconds and leaves a minor coating.
Overall: as a huge fan of coconut I would buy candles of this beer. It is someplace between a macaroon and mounds bar. Really not a fan of the mouth feel though, especially by the end of the glass. 654 charactersdhitchcox, Dec 20, 2015

Pours dark brown, like black tea, with about two fingers of pale khaki head. The thick froth eventually fades to a broad collar that deposits a few smallish clouds of lace. 
The nose is amazing. Vibrant coconut, coffee, caramel and chocolate. I can't get enough of this fantastic coconut and coffee combination. 
Flavors are a delightful mixture of rich toasted coconut, caramel macchiato, milk chocolate, vaguely nutty, a little roast and a faint almost floral bitterness. Almost no perceptible alcohol. Delicious and very easy to drink. 
Fairly light bodied but incredibly smooth and creamy feel with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet with abundant coconut, coffee and caramel. That coconut lingers on the palate for quite a long time. 
After hearing about it for a couple years it is a pleasure to finally try Last Snow. This delivers a world class experience on every level. A truly outstanding porter that I will dream of until we meet again. 1,156 charactersThickNStout, Nov 12, 2015

A – Pours a dark brown with 1” of head that settles pretty quickly.
S – Very strong aroma of coffee and coconut.  This will grab your attention from across the room. Outstanding!
T – A little sweet initially, then flavors of coffee, vanilla, maple syrup and coconut, with a bitter coffee finish.
M – Medium mouth finish, medium low carbonation.
O – This is an outstanding blend of flavors.  Maybe the best coffee flavor I’ve ever had in a beer. This is my new favorite Porter. 531 charactersspacecake9, Nov 11, 2015

4.48/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Look:  This appears cola colored pouring out of the glass and dark brown when sitting in my favorite 15.5 oz brandy snifter.  Initially, the pour creates a tan creamy head, but it quickly dies down to a broken and light film over the top, with a thin halo.  Twirling the glass leaves behind a fine melting curtain.
Smell:  This beer has a spectacular aroma.  I initially smelled maple syrup, but as the beer sits the coconut begins to stand out and dominate.  Nice light coconut aroma.    
Taste:  The coconut is light and feathery, not overpowering, just right.  Medium to dark specialty grains are up first.  The coconut taste is throughout, but becomes more prominent near the back end.  The finish is nice and long.  The sweet coconut peaks near the back end, then slowly fades away.  The aftertaste is superb.  There is a nice coconut taste left in my mouth for me to enjoy.  For me, the coffee adds a nice touch, but is minimal, almost non-existent.  
Feel:  Medium body that is somewhat creamy.  Not too thin, not too thick.  Below medium carbonation.
Overall -  This is a very nice porter.  Easy drinking here.  Superbly blended and crafted.  I like this beer better than the MBCP. 1,190 charactersmabermud, Nov 06, 2015

4.37/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle received in a recent trade.
Pours black and glossy, with a small head, and a good amount of lacing.
The sweet shredded coconut flavor just leaps out the bottle and the glass here. As I sip a bit more, the aroma balances out, with nice roasty coffee, caramel, and still a ton of coconut.
This hits the exact right notes in the flavor that it meant to hit. It's a big coconut bomb, sweet and toasty, with some caramel, chocolate, and bitter roasted coffee. The bitterness of the coffee helps balance out the sweetness of the coconut. It's a flavor/adjunct bomb, just like you expect from South Florida.
This is medium bodied, a little thin, but it is only a 6% porter, so I'll cut it a bit of slack. It's not quite as creamy and silky as I'd hoped, but the flavor makes up for it.
This is a really tasty dessert beer, hits everything it set out to do, flavor-wise. If it was a bit more substantial in the body, it would be near perfect. Cheers Funky Buddha! 967 charactersGreesyFizeek, Oct 28, 2015

Not super thick, but hey it's not supposed to be since it's a porter.  The two finger tan head dissipates to a ring around the glass and doesn't leave much lacing.

Very smooth medium body mouth feel. Carbonation is just what you'd expect.
Nice acidity on side of tongue. dark chocolate, roast coffee - very much like a  good Italian Espresso. As it warms I get a nice subtle coffee on the mid palate. Coconut comes out as it warms. Mouthfeel is nicer also.
Great beer. 501 charactersKATCanada, Oct 24, 2015

pours a chestnut brown w some riby highlights when held to the light. Nose is pretty awesome...like chocolate vanilla caramel w a hint of coconut. so balanced that even I don't mind the coconut. coconut comes out more on the flavor, but still tasty. caramel glazed vanilla coconut porter...nutty, nice. if I liked coconut more this would be heaven but even I like it as is. great beer. 432 charactersimonhiatus, Sep 27, 2015

Compact head of frothy foam. Khaki in color. Light streaks of lacing. Pitch-black liquid with the slightest of carbonation visible. Looks tasty. 5
What a rich nose. Bursting with aroma. Smells like maple and cinnamon first. Then some sweet, pungent coconut. So much rich sweetness. There's a woodsy quality too that again suggests sweet maple syrup. Does this have maple syrup? The aroma here is intoxicating but almost too sweet for my liking. 4.25
Coconut is at the forefront with the flavor accompanied by dark roast coffee. Still tasting some oak and maple syrup but in a much lighter way. Strangely, I'm getting some strong curry flavor from this beer, think coconut and curry spice. Interesting. There's also a floral hop flavor that works its way into the mix and tempers some of the sweeter elements. 3.75
Given the nose, I was expecting a thick rich body but didn't get one. It's light and bubbly initially before the carbonation fades to the background a bit. Sweetness is present but not overdone, helped by a floral hop presence. It does have a sticky feel in the mouth and comes off as dessert-like when all is said and done. 4
Am I the only one that finds this to be a lot like a Thai curry dish? Indra Kunindra minus the spice and lime? This beer is fun to drink and very unique but I think the Florida locals might have generated some undeserved hype for this beer. 1,425 charactersONovoMexicano, Sep 20, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Had on draft and out of a growler.
A: Pours a deep chocolate with a thick tan head that maintains well and laces beautifully throughout. 
S: Smells like coffee, chocolate and toasted coconut, all well-balanced and working in near-perfect unison. 
T: Taste is a delicious blend of coffe, toast, chocolate and toasted coconut, reminiscent of any one of a dozen  amazing coconut and chocolate desserts. Toasted coconut lingers pleasantly on the palate after each pull and for a while after finishing this beer.
M: A typical heft for an American porter, medium carbonation helps those amazing flavors dance around.
O: If you don't like coconut flavor this isn't the beer for you, but this is a fantastic-tasting beer that I could drink for dessert over and over. Manageable alcohol, delicious flavors, heady aromas and a nice body make this one of the most enjoyable porters I've had. Time to stock up! 903 charactersFBGordon, Sep 15, 2015

Dark brown to an almost black body; aggressively poured to 2 fingers worth of head which dissipated slowly to 1/2 finger.  Nice light tan color with tons of tiny bubbles.
Aromas of a melted Almond Joy bar in a cup of strong latte.  Coconut, chocolate, roasted almonds, roasted malts and of course the coffee.  Mouth watering!
First sip...The nose does not lie!  Coconut, chocolate, slightly bitter coffee.  Bittersweet finish.
Feel is nice and full, plenty of bitter and sweet light amount of carbonation, low abv.
Overall this is a delicious beer!  I should have bought 2 bottles!  This beer goes down nice and easy; sweetness is tempered really well from the black coffee addition.  This is a great beer no doubt. 822 charactersjhartley, Sep 11, 2015

LOOK: Pours with a finger's worth of brown foam that shrinks down into a quarter's worth of khaki foam after 35 seconds. Black in color with a ruby tint. Beer is too black to see any rising bubbles. Lacing is high and thin.
SMELL: Strong aromas of hazelnut coffee beautifully dance with subtle coconut and  sweet chocolate.
TASTE: Strong hazelnut coffee flavors enter initially. Mild flavors of coconut enter next along with hints of sweet chocolate. Mild bitterness from the roasted malts come in to finish off this amazing symphony as all previous flavors persist.
FEEL: Light-bodied (lame, but it's a porter) with subtle carbonation. Goes down incredibly smooth and finishes with a hint of dryness.
NOTE: Another incredible brew from Funky Buddha. They have not disappointed me so far. My only complaint is that the bitterness from the roasted malts, although mild, keep this beer from being even more tasty. 956 charactersMyotus, Sep 08, 2015

This beer smells amazing, right after you open it the room seems to fill with coconut aroma. As other people said biggest taste here is coconut. Not overly sweet, the coffee helps to cut down on the coconut sweetness. Still though coconut is easily the dominat flavor. Only real thing about this beer that brings it down a bit is the mouthfeel. It is a bit thin without a ton of body to back it up. 444 charactersBobloblawlawblog11, Sep 04, 2015

Really nice feel for a porter - medium-high carbonation but also finishes with a nice smoothness. Really nice mouthfeel. Overall I think it's worth the hype for this one, really enjoyed it. 439 characterscostanzo_mike, Sep 04, 2015

When I had this on tap in February at the brewery release, I thought it was phenomenal. I've had it now on three subsequent occasions on draft at three different establishments in Orlando. Each time it failed to live up to my initial impression. Pours dark brown with a half finger head that hangs around. Aroma is the highlight of the beer. Coconut, vanilla, and coffee jump out of the glass, especially the coconut. I expected more coconut on the taste. It's definitely there, but not in a big way. The coffee taste is not deep bitter roast, but more like coffee that's been diluted with artificial creamer. There is a chemical or mineral flavor that seems off. The mouth feel is light to medium with prickly carb. It's not a bad beer. It's sweet and tasty in places, especially when the coconut shines through. I remember it having more body and maybe more chocolate before. The coffee was stronger and the vanilla creamer flavor wasn't as prominent. Don't go out of your way to trade for it. 1,024 charactersdanh53, Sep 03, 2015
4.64/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Look: Dark, like any other porter. Good amount of carbonation/head retention.
Smell: AMAZING. Saying I could smell toasted coconut is an understatement! So much coconut. Ahaha. Also get lots of sweet coffee....Wow, this is one of the best smelling beers I have had in a while.
Taste: Big coconut, chocolate, and coffee flavors up front. These flavors blend so well together. The flavors inexplicably elicit thoughts of a winter wonderland hahaha...spot on. As the beer warmed I also got some maple-like flavors. Tasty!
Feel: Slight prickly feeling from the carbonation which I am not a fan of, but overall good mouth feel.
Overall: Really good beer that I will definitely try to seek out again. I really wish Funky Buddha was in CA...they churn out some of my favorite porters/stouts. 785 characterssittinggc, Sep 03, 2015

L - pours thin dark brown.  Settles to black in the glass with almost no head and lacing.  Slight mocha ring
S - Coffee and coconut for sure - a bit overly chemical smelling - like it is one of those shots of flavor they put into your starbucks
T - same as the smell - strong bold flavors of coffee and coconut with hints of vanilla, and a touch of slightly plastic / fake sweetness.  Becomes cloying quite quickly as you move through a full glass.
F - thin.  Completely lacking body.  Really lets the beer down.  Improves as it warms, but still not enough backbone to support the flavors
Overall, a very interesting beer, but lacking body and the flavors and aroma are just a bit too fake for me to be truly satisfied with this beer.  This is the epitome of a beer that seems amazing in a 2 ounce pour, but really is one dimensional and a bit sickly after you get to know it more though a full glass. 944 characterspagriley, Sep 03, 2015

Part of me loves the coconut/coffee blast, the other part of me thinks it tastes like those instant Cappochino drinks you get at 7-11. The problem with this porter is its so flavorful. you don't taste the beer, just the additives. I bought another bomber so I'll try this again in a week or so and see if my opinion changes 3.75. 10-2015 Update opened another one. pretty much the same. everyone else around me enjoyed it. maybe its just me 3.75. 5-2016 update well after cellaring one all winter, I believe it has improved.  I know it says "consume fresh" but I think overall the taste has mellowed out quite nicely and I can taste the base Porter.  The smell has definitely improved.

Smell is heavenly. Roasted coffee grounds and espresso quickly assault the senses. Vanilla and coconut dance in the background adding a nice sweetness. Absolutely astounding.
Taste follows up the nose. Nice roasted coffee beans and coconut are the first things I notice. A nice vanilla, chocolate and coconut latte sweetness coats the tongue after that leaving behind a slightly sweet, slightly bitter coffee after taste.
Nice medium body. Just enough of a presence but still nice, light and surprisingly sessionable.
Overall the nose made me immediately fall in love with this beer. The flavor is right on as well. But there are only a few beers where the smell brings a smile and giggle in anticipation of what is to come. 785 charactersBigRedDog, Aug 29, 2015

If you ever hear that Bath and Body Works is rolling out a Last Snow-scented candle, buy their stock immediately, because Funky Buddha is sitting on a goldmine in licensed merchandising potential. 499 charactersdarktronica, Aug 23, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Opened the bottle and immediately received a wisp of the aroma of coconut and the sweet smell of vanilla. 
This bottle is a couple of months old – probably five from the spring 2015 release of last snow.  The coconut, vanilla and coffee still had staying power.
Visually it fits the beer profile for an American Porter although slightly thinner on the pour than I have seen of other porters.  Once in the glass it is beautiful to behold.  Pours thin buts sits stoutly in the glass exhibiting a malty,  dark 
character which does not allow you to see through the glass.  Looking overtop the coloring is black, dark brown with ruby highlights.   The aroma prefaces the complexity of this beer with coffee, toffee, and light chocolate, sweet vanilla and coconut flavors.    This beer is complex and emanates these aromas so take your time with it.  Smell it and look it at to indulge your senses.  Mouthfeel is thin but makes up for it with the complexity of the flavors matching the aroma.   Moderately sweet balanced with a slightly bitter coffee flavor.  Sharp in taste, just slightly dry with a bready finish and coconut taste that lingers on the back of the tongue.  What an outstanding balance and contrast of flavors at the same time (sweet vanilla against the coffee, dry to malty flavoring, bready against the cocoanut fruit finish).  My notes read that the coffee could have been slightly stronger.  Someone will have to send me a bottle to validate that.  Wait, further in my notes the coffee flavor seemed to become more pronounced as the beer warmed.  6.4 % ABV is deceiving for this beer as it is a very smooth and easy beer to drink. 1,648 charactersAlequine, Aug 22, 2015

Found it on display at the local Whole Foods in downtown Miami. Clerk told me someone said they were coming to buy the whole display because of its limited availability so I figured it was time to try one. 
A little thinned out for a porter. The notes of coconut and coffee are dead on tho. Smell is straight delicious coffee.
Finishes a little carmel, and almost like a black coffee with a little sediment. Coconut on the aftertaste reminds you of its quality. 
Delicious. Is it a world class porter? Questionable. Is it a delicious beer. Affirmative. 651 charactersFrancisSmooth, Aug 19, 2015

A tad thinner mouthfeel that I would ideally like, possibly from the low carb? Either way a delicious brew! 256 charactersSDRedDevil, Aug 19, 2015

Last Snow's nose is chock full of coconut, coffee, and a little sweetness. Pouring it into the glass was like pouring a carbonated coffee; it had a little translucency around the edges of the pour, and wasn't too thick. I welcome the porter consistency over the commonplace inky stout darkness. I was really excited to get to tasting. It has a very nostalgic flavor for me of coconut cookies dipped into a sweet cup of café con leche as a kid. This was my diabetic grandfather's breakfast of choice. The sweet tooth that man had was unparalleled. To have a beer bring me back to a moment with him earns some props. I'll be looking out for the release of this beer in the future, don't miss an opportunity to try it yourself. 790 charactersOne1Asterisk, Jul 19, 2015

This was a pretty outstanding take on a coffee porter. Big coffee nose. Nice coffee flavor. Though I personally love good coffee I don't always tend to like it in my beer as often times I feel it comes off burnt and acidic. Not so here. Very well done. These guys really make a nice porter. 360 charactersZaximus, Jul 17, 2015

A- pours a dark brown, nearly opaque color, with a small creamy khaki colored head that retains for a while, eventually settling to just a thin film on top and rang around the edge 
S- As soon as I opened the bottle, all I could saw was 'wow.'  This is quite possibly the best smelling beer to date.  I immediately get a huge whiff of toasted coconut & melted caramel, quickly followed by dark chocolate and fresh coffee.  There is a toasted aspect that gives an aroma of toasted almonds, also picking up notes of sweet vanilla whipping cream.  Many reviews stated that this smells like a liquid Almond Joy, and that's spot on
T- big blast of sweetness up front with lots of caramel, vanilla & toffee.  The coconut quickly follows and is more prominent than most beers that use this ingredient.  Milk chocolate and coffee flow underneath, providing a nice balance to the other ingredients.  Nutty and earthy tones as it nears the finish with more herbal coffee on the linger
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a silky finish 
O- I've had a few beers that have tried to capture the essence of coconut & chocolate, but none have packed in this much flavor, and at 6.5%.  I don't want to finish the beers because I can't stop smelling it 1,311 charactersTreyliff, May 13, 2015

4.46/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever tried. The nose can best be described as a pour of liquid Almond Joy. A very strong coconut, chocolate, and coffee burst. 
I was hoping for a fuller body, but I suppose that as a porter, it delivered true to style. 
The flavor is good but a bit thin for my taste. 
I wish the taste could match the nose. 357 charactersrodmanfor3, May 10, 2015

A - Dark black coffee with a 2 finger cream colored head. Fades into a thick collar and leaves behind spots and splotches of lacing. 
S - A wonderful aroma of steeping Italian espresso with freshly cut open coconut. Dark chocolates mingle with the roasted malts. 
F - Starts off with the roasted malts and quickly moves into a coffee, espresso flavor. After it settles the sweet coconut drenched in dark chocolate (mounds bar!) comes in to entice the palate. 
M - Smooth and creamy with a rich feel and excellent carbonation.
O - This is in my amazing zone because of how much I love coffee, and coconut covered in dark chocolate. 667 charactersRi0, Apr 26, 2015

4.37/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25This is the best smelling beer I have ever come across... it's a massive coconut bomb with a coffee note taking the back seat, but still present. I find myself wishing it was more viscous and with a higher ABV, it is quite thin and would be the absolute perfect beer if it were heavier. For the style though, it is among the best I've had.  
Summary: 
Look: Medium to dark brown, slightly transparent, caramel head
Nose: Oh my god this is the best thing I have ever smelled in life.
Taste: Man, I wish this tasted as good as it smelled...
Feel: This is flat out too thin.
Good beer. If they did the same thing they did with "Wide Awake It's Morning" (the imperial version of MBCP) for this, it would be a world stopper. 721 characterstclipse, Apr 09, 2015

Taste: Amazing roasty coffee and coconut flavors mix well with nutty dry porter flavors and smooth out with a touch of vanilla-ish flavor. Decadent!

Smells of ground coffee, coconut and mousse au chocolate big times. The coffee is especially well pronounced, while standing against the sweeter aromas of the beer, it reveals earth, toffee and hazelnuts. The nose offers a unique blend, which turns out to be less sweet than expected, with a well balanced infusion of bitter coffee, accentuated by roasted coconuts.
Has a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied beer.
Tastes of bitter coffee beans, accompanied by a metallic carbonation, increasing the tastes bitterness, while providing a vivid creaminess. Coconut and Nutella add a lot of character to the beer, which doesn't turn dessert-like at any point, due to the distinct coffee presence. It implements an earthy toffee flavor very effective though, which turns a tad metallic during the finish, reminding me of cold coffee. 
Easy drinking beer, which got a decent complexity to it, turning out a bit too thin and metallic during the finish. Also the bitterness is a bit too harsh, compared to the weaker implemented sweeter flavors of the beer, initially promising a decent balance. The beers interaction between coffee, bitter chocolate and slightly wooden coconuts is very enjoyable though, while the brew remains recognizable as a Porter. 1,340 charactersaleigator, Apr 07, 2015

Smell is incredible! nothing like it, huge coconut-coffee- faint chocolate is one of the best noses on a beer that I can remember - totally unique!
Slight bitterness from the coffee stands out - medium body. perfect hints of chocolate and coconut again - one of the few beers that is able to bring the coconut flavor out that I've ever tasted.  
Soft and smooth finish, very drinkable.  
This is well done, very well balanced brew - not over powering in any one taste-lots of depth and spice. 563 charactersM_chav, Mar 26, 2015

If you love coconut, this beer is a must try beer. Super rich and authentic coconut flavor is just oozing from the aroma and flavor profile of this beer. Not smelling or tasting much coffee in this porter. Lots of milk chocolate and vanilla flavor and aroma. Medium bodied porter with very creamy, decadent mouthfeel, and near perfect carbonation levels. Funky Buddha Last Snow proves to me that no one else can do such great porters that are brewed with adjuncts. I thought Maple Bacon Coffee porter was excellent porter, well Last Snow is even better!  Funky Budda definitely "upped the annie" with this adjunct porter! 677 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Mar 13, 2015

S: Delicious coconut, light roastiness, a bit of vanilla.  A bit of a rubbery smell.  
T: Light roast and malt, a bit of coconut and vanilla.  Pretty watery.
M: Thin, with medium-light carbonation.  
O: The coconut is nice on the nose, but overall this is pretty one dimensional, and the taste is decidedly watery.  The base is too thin to stand up to the coconut flavor.  And unfortunately, the coffee seems to have completely faded. 565 characterspmarlowe, Mar 11, 2015

A – Coca cola brown on pour with a quarter finger of head that leaves a clingy light brown lacing on the glass.  
S – Liquid mounds. Coconut, milk chocolate, cream and coffee. Absurdly good smell.  
T – Same as the smell. Coconut in force with a nice backing of milk chocolate. Coffee flavors roll through right after with a light cream taste. Touch of the coffee bitterness at the end. Sweet but not cloying. 
M – Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Lightly slick on the palate. Leaves a bit of sweetness. 
O – Awesome. Delicious. Heaven in a glass. I love coconut and coffee so this one resonates with me. I have had many chances to drink this and love it each time. So glad its bottled now. 770 charactersGallowsThief, Mar 10, 2015

Type:  22oz. Bomber
Glass:  Fiddlehead Teku
Vintage:  End 2014 (?)
Pours a light black w/ brown hues, like cola, w/ a 1/2 finger off white head that leaves light lacing.  Aromas of caramel, coconut, coffee, and some spices, mainly cinnamon.  This literally smells like coffee poured over a fresh cinnamon bun, amazing!  The flavor opens w/ coffee and quickly moves into light caramel malt sweetness, and closes w/ spices, coconut water, and enough hop bitterness to balance.  Medium bodied and lush w/ appropriate carbonation.  This one goes down in a flash!  Do not share!
Overall, hands down the best beer I have had the pleasure of drinking so far in 2015.  The aroma on this one is just mind boggling!  Funky Buddha brought the funk like George Clinton on this one. 788 charactersmikeyv35, Mar 02, 2015

4.39/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a  deep, dark brown, more amber when light catching the beer's edges, and is topped by a thin tan head that retreats quickly to the glass's edges before fading completely. The nose wreaks strongly of coconuts upfront followed by coffee and some chocolate as it warms. The taste reminds me most of samoas, but I can definitely see the "liquid mounds bars" description. As expected, coconut dominates the flavor profile, but the taste does transition to burnt toffee, caramel sweetness and bitter coffee in the finish. Although it's a porter, I'd anticipated more body to match the beer's heavy flavors. The carbonation is low (better than mbcp) as is the bitterness and like magic, every flavor seems to be distinct and noticeable (except for the subtle cocoa buttery richness emblematic of white chocolate). The roasted malt in the finish is all that remains of the beer's fleeting porter base. I'll admit, this is an exceptional beer, which I would definitely recommend to others, but slightly prefer mbcp 1,021 charactersThePorterSorter, Mar 01, 2015

It's still an enjoyable beer, but if the coconut was more natural, like three hour tour, this could be a great beer.  Instead, its a fun experiment to say you tried. 221 charactersmrn1ceguy, Feb 28, 2015

There's a coffee shop in Central Florida that makes a coconut mocha almond latte called the "Coco Mocha Joy" and this literally smells just like that.  It's one of the best smelling beers I've had.  The taste isn't far off from the smell.  Last Snow is a great smelling, great tasting porter.  Just wish that it was a little bit thicker and stayed on the tongue longer.  A lot of brewers make really unbalanced coffee beers, but I feel like this one is spot on.  Well done, Funky!  Now I need to find some MBCP :D. 555 charactersajwalls257, Feb 25, 2015

4.73/5  rDev +6.3%1L growler courtesy of buddhabelly. Served into a HF wine glass at 40F.
reviewed with the old scoring system.
A: 4.75. dark brown body  with 1.5" mocha head that is smooth and full. Fine carbonation with minor lacing on the glass.  Gentle swirling reinvigorates about half of the head.
S: 4.75 Coconut. Cracking the growler, you can smell this 4-5 feet away easily. Amazing rich chocolate, coffee and caramel notes. No hint of hops or malt. One of the bet smelling beers I've ever had the privilege to taste.
T: 4.75 Just like the smell. Wafting tones of roasted coffee, fresh coconut and chocolate. Clean with no lingering aftertaste aside from coconut...which is fantastic. Like a liquid Mounds candy bar. Slightly acidic, but otherwise amazingly well balanced.
M: 4.50 A touch heavy. Slightly oily, but still pleasant. Carbonation is correct, but the nature of adjuncts in this beer will always leave a bit or a rough finish.
O: 4.75 One of the most interesting beers I've tried, but Funky Buddha aspires to just that. Glad my wife was here to share as more than a glass may be too much flavor, but this is definitely worth seeking out. 1,146 charactersF2brewers, Aug 24, 2014

Pours a dark beer. Forms very little foam, some bubbles. Smell is a bit faint and hard to catch. Taste is amazing. Has vanilla, coconut, chocolate, and is overall sweet. It is a syrupy beer, and makes you very sticky. Definitively worth trying it. 269 charactersJulioH, Jun 21, 2014

Thanks DirtyDawwg and GavinMBrown!The nose on this beer is absolutely wonderful.  Just puts a smile on my face knowing what I'm getting with each sip.  The beer was smooth and had a great coconut taste but wasn't overpowering on the coconut, roasted coffee, or vanilla. Crisp, a nice bit of bitter and if anything, perhaps a little thin on the mouth.

A- Dark brown body that is almost black, 1.5 finger offwhite head with good retention, and a medium collar remains even after significant time has passed. Occasional rings of lacing.
S- I can smell the coffee as soon as the bartender passed the glasses over the bar to me. This is a very coffee forward beer, with a lot of coconut character that made me wish Proprietor's had this much coconut. There is a maple syrup-like sweet character that evidently must be from the white chocolate and caramel combination. Very aromatic.
F- Incredibly complex and interesting. Espresso, coconut, maple syrup character that's presumably the white chocolate and caramel combination- it's sweet and tempered by the espresso bitterness. Some slight roast malt presence. No smokiness. The coconut is very strong in this and complements the other adjuncts very well. 
M- Medium bodied for a porter; good carbonation. The coffee remains a bit stronger than I'd like in terms of drinkability, but I really don't mind that much. Finish is a nice sweet maple syrup-like finish that's tempered by cold black coffee bitterness.
O- Hell of a porter. Very complex, drinkable and interesting. Highly recommend getting a growler of this if you can. They weren't filling growlers of this to go, but if they were, I'd take a couple along with me on my vacation. 1,431 charactersStevedore, May 22, 2014

M - Smooth and Crémful
Overall - The BEST porter i have ever experienced. This amazing porter leaves you satisfied but always wanting more. This is however a special release Funky Buddha does so if you catch wind of a release you better jump on it because the kegs go fast usually within hours. This beer is definitely a world class porter that every porter lover should experience. 705 charactersTheFunkyBuddhaAdvocate, May 12, 2014

Served in a stemmed glass
Pitch black appearance. The liquid was topped by an inch-tall, tight, frothy, caramel colored crown. Drippy streaks of lacing coated the glass.
The nose was absolutely amazing. While many refer to this beer as a coconut bomb, I thought it smelled like french toast in a glass. Tons of maple syrup. Intense vanilla notes. Slightly bready. Perhaps a hint of coffee. The porter-like characteristics came through as well. Coffee and roast were noticeable.
The flavor profile was very similar to the nose. French toast notes dominated. Loads of maple syrup. Some vanilla. French roast coffee and dark chocolate came through in the center. The beer finished with a moderate dose of roasted malts and a kiss of hops.
The beer was super slick and creamy on the palate and contained a fine, zippy effervescence. Fuller bodied for the style. The carbonation lessened with time.
Funky Buddha makes a number of wildly creative, intensely flavored beers, and Last Snow is definitely one of their best. If you want the ultimate breakfast porter, look no further. 1,120 charactersDamian, May 08, 2014

Pours a dark mocha colored thick creamy almost 1 finger head, fades at a med pace with lots of lacing, pitch black beer. 
Nose is so much coconut, just pure awesome coconut, fresh toasted coconut and coconut oil too, little maple note and toasted barrel, vanilla oak. Little dark choc and cocoa, almond joy, so much coconut, then coffee so much fresh coffee and nice nutty and coconut coffee, caramel machiato and cappuccino, and cocoa, fresh roasted roasted coffee beans. 
Taste is more of the same awesomeness! Tons of coconut too start, great coconut oil and fresh coconut flesh toasted. Into creamy dark choc, bakers and hot cocoa, vanilla barrel, etc, into fresh coffee, freshly roasted coffee beans, freshly brewed coconut earthy nutty coffee, toasted coffee, etc. Little caramel and maple notes, with almond joy goodness, and coconut milk creamy taste. Nice dark choc, coffee, and great coconut lingering forever on the finish, long coconut and cocoa, vanilla, little bitterness, just great. 
Mouth is a bit thin, but creamy and coconut milk, decent carb, just a bit thin.
Overall phenomenal! Very hard to get any better than this. Again another Funky Buddha grand slam! I really need to get down there and hit them up for some special beers when I can. Got another coming soon so I can't wait for that. This is quickly becoming top 5 breweries for me. 1,529 charactersjlindros, Apr 26, 2014

M - Mouthfeel is not as creamy as I'd like, slightly thin.
O - Overall this beer smelled and tasted incredible. Mind shatteringly good. So so so much coconut. Just awesome. 735 charactersrudzud, Apr 26, 2014

4.99/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5poured from a 32 oz growler into a snifter
A- Coffee black, fair amount of lacing, not much head.
S - pungent fresh coffee roast, coconut, roasted malts. The "fresh coffee" smell is the strongest, but unlike other coffee based stouts in that they don't smell like the roast itself, just the finished product. Really unique in that sense that it smells like a quality ground roast and hits you right in the nose.
T- SMOOTH, coconut heavy but not overpowering. Balances perfectly with chocolate, coffee and toffee notes. Very sweet on the finish
M - lightly carbonated, just right for its ABV (many porters 5-6 % abv tend to be thin.). This is just right. About as good of a consistency and viscosity as you can get for the style.
O - WOW...I waited several hours in line for this growler, and I actually ordered a glass of this while i waited, however I'm convinced they did NOT give me this and gave me the OP porter or something else. Shame on you bartender! I was underwhelmed by the hype when i had what I thought was Last Snow but what i'm drinking now is a totally different beer. Without a doubt one of the best porters, if not the best, i've ever had. Well worth the hype and fortunate to have been able to try this 1,227 charactersSwedgin_Wu, Apr 22, 2014

S- holy shit. Coconut, fresh roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla. 
T- that roast up front from the coffee, middle of the mouth you get the coconut and white chocolate, and finishes with a nice vanilla and leaves that coffee bean taste in the after taste
M- full body, creamy
O- wow what an amazing beer. This might be one of my all time favorite beers ever. The flavors are amazing and exactly what they wanted it to be, and exactly what I wanted it to be Lol just awesome stuff! Cheers! 579 charactersTheosTheories, Apr 18, 2014

The aroma hits of a signature intensity of Funky Buddha. Tons of coconut flakes, light roasted malt, chocolate.
The flavor follows with a straight Almond joy flavor. It tastes of simply eating coconut, then onto some chocolate flavor and a light roasted malt porter quality.
The mouthfeel is medium minus.
A fun brew, but simply that, at best. 391 charactersdar482, Mar 24, 2014

S-I must preface this by saying I am always searching for a beer with awesome coconut flavor. This one is essentially the Holy Grail of coconut beer. The aroma is just riddled and packed with coconut flesh. There is also a bunch of coffee, sweet chocolate and vanilla. But the coconut is unbelievable.
T-Again, the coconut is delectable. I have never had a beer with anywhere near as much coconut flavor as this one. Chunks of decadent coconut flesh. I feel like I should be picking it out my teeth. Coffee, chocolate, burnt caramel and vanilla extract.
M-Creamy. Kind of hard to describe the feel because I literally gulped this down in an instant. I couldn't help myself.
O/D-Okay, okay, now I see why the Funky Buddha has such a following. This was the best coconut beer i have ever had and was also one of the best beers I ever remember trying. 884 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

4.38/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at Mellow Mushroom in Brandon. Served in a fluted pilsner glass.
A: Dark brown and nearly opaque. Low visible carbonation and only a thin tan foamy head by the time it's at my table.
S: Huge coconut first, followed by chocolate, coffee, sweet vanilla, and roasted malts. Wow - very nice nose.
T: Follows the nose. Coconut domination. Mounds Bar and chocolate with a swig of coffee afterwards, then a bite of toasted macaroon cookies. Roasted malts and more coconut, with some silky vanilla flavor. Just a touch of roast and hop bitterness to balance at the end prevents this from being a sweet bomb. Coconut flavor stays in the hang.
M: Body is a little thin for a porter, especially from Funky Buddha. Not flat, but the carbonation level is fairly low. Alcohol quite well-hidden.
O: Very good. Very coconutty. But the other flavors are quite present, and I never felt like the coconut overstayed its welcome. My biggest gripe was the mouthfeel - really wished it was a bit thicker.
NOTE: The bottled version (at least the bottle I opened) has quite a bit more roasty character to the malt bill than the draft version. 1,156 charactersmacrosmatic, Jan 13, 2014

A: A pretty nice looking porter. Moderate pour yields a one finger cream colored head that slowly recedes, leaving several soapy looking bubbles on top of the glass. Beer is jet black. Nice lacing left behind as I make my way through the pour. 
S: How did they manage to cram so much coconut aroma into this beer? Nose is an intense amount of coconut up front. The pungency of coconut is insane, no other coconut beer I've experienced comes anywhere close. Other aromas include vanilla and the advertised white chocolate. Incredibly appealing nose. It smells as much like a confectioner's treat as beer.
T: Wow, the pungency of coconut on the nose carries over to the palate. Just a remarkable amount of coconut, a real brewing feat. Flavors are toasted coconut, white chocolate, and some backing roast. I know there is caramel in here, but I can't decide whether I'm tasting caramel or the toast of the coconut. Great either way.
M: In some ways, there is so much flavor packed into this beer that it seems like it should be carried by a thicker body. However, this is a porter after all, so the light to medium body is more appropriate than if this were billed as a stout. Moderate carbonation. 
O: This is one of the most interesting dessert type beers I've had. I'm amazed how much coconut aroma and flavor they were able to impart. Fantastic beer for those with a sweet tooth. 1,447 charactersdbc5, Aug 16, 2013

A- Pours a light brown that appears a pitch black in the glass with a half finger of mocha brown head that recedes at a fairly average pace. Nice carbonation with good consistency. Leaves spotty lacing.
S- Very sweet coconut balanced with very sweet caramel, some vanilla. Very rich, ultra sweet, very aromatic, all while retaining a decent balance. One of e sweetest/richest beers I've smelled.
T- Very sweet caramel, some coconut, a tiny bit of vanilla, balanced malts, a hint of bitterness, finishes with more coconut and rich caramel. Very nice for a 6.5% porter, maybe a tiny bit too sweet.
M- Medium bodied, decent carbonation, smooth, maybe a little bit too thin.
O- This was a very nice porter that was very rich and sweet but retained a decent balance between the coconut and caramel. Definitely worth checking out especially if you have a sweet tooth. 959 charactersjaasen64, Aug 08, 2013

A: Pours a thick, lightless black with a cappuccino head that foams up before settling into a whisper. Nice legs. 
N: Tons of coconut and white chocolate. Some coffee and Dutch cocoa. Maple syrup, burnt brown sugar, and butterscotch. It takes awhile to get underneath the dominant flavors of the adjuncts, but it’s worth the wait.
T: Really well-balanced. Moderate to heavy sweetness. with a solid roasted malt/coffee base and some bitterness to balance it out. 
M: Moderate body with a pleasant level of carbonation. Exactly what I want in a porter. 
O: Easily the best porter I’ve had, and one I’m thinking about a couple hours afterwards as I transcribe my notes. The base beer comes through and the white chocolate and coconut are used to push it over the edge instead of as masking agents. High kudos from me. 857 charactersSarlacc83, Jul 29, 2013

A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light tan head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of sheer surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves small clots behind.
S- Fuck yeah!  Smells like a Mounds bar but with a shot of espresso thrown in to really bring the whole profile together and perk up the senses.  Nothing short of incredible.
T- Taste mirrors the aroma with lots of coconut, dark roast coffee and some caramel for good measure.  Drinkability is through the roof on this.  Mild bitterness provides great balance.

M- Slightly creamy with medium carbonation and a full body.

This beer is getting my first written review because it left such a lasting impression on me
Appearance- the beer was such a dark brown almost pure black. not much head but tons of lacing as I drank it
Aroma- rich hints of caramel, vanilla, and coconut, and chocolate on the nose
Flavor- explosion of coconut richness. the toasted coconut just really was the highlight of the beer. the chocolate hints along with vanilla gave the beer just the right amount of sweetness.
Mouth feel- Wish it was a stout because porters are a bit thin for me but this one just worked so well.
Overall- One of the best beers I have ever had. The highlight of hunahpu day for me. this is one beer that I cannot wait to have again when i visit funky buddha this summer. Apart from huna this was the only beer that day that i went back and purchased a second one because I could not get over what I had just tasted 958 characterscubanbeerguy, Apr 23, 2013

A- Pours dark brown, nearly black, even in a snifter I'd been drinking out of all day it produced a nice finger of creamy tan head with good retention and spotty lacing.
S- Smells ridiculously good. There's a ton of rich dark chocolate, but what really puts this over the top is the coconut, almond and vanilla aroma, this aspect of the aroma is huge and smells delicious. There's also some cocoa powder aroma. It smells like a dessert.
T- At first there's a lot of bitter roasted grain and coffee, followed by a sweet flavor of coconut, almond, chocolate and caramel, it really tastes like an awesome dessert. As has been commented before, I can't believe how much flavor they've packed into a relatively low-ABV beer.
M- Medium-bodied, smooth and creamy. There was nothing wrong with this but it could stand to be a bit more full.
O- A great beer, one of the highlights of Hunahpu Day. It tastes and smells delicious and is fun to sip at, although I could probably demolish a large amount of this very easily. 1,067 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 12, 2013

Pours a dark, dark brown, almost black. Light tan head.
Smell is outrageously big chocolate and coconut, caramel, vanilla, honey sweetness. As a friend said: "Like a mounds bar." Simply phenomenal.
Taste is hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, coconut, vanilla. Really complex and large flavor, very surprising how much flavor is in a 6.5% porter.
Mouthfeel is light, very carbonated. A little thin. 
Overall, a truly exceptional beer. Ridiculously flavorful, and a standout beer from an event filled with amazing beers. 591 charactersrodkin, Mar 09, 2013

A - Pours pitch black with a small half finger tall tan head leaving spotty lace down parts of the glass.
S - Smells of strong coconut, fresh coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla and dark roast. A very intoxicating nose.
T - Starts off with a huge fresh shaved coconut flavor that never really fades away. Hints of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, dark roast and a touch of toffee. Finish is sweet, mostly coconut and chocolate, not lingering on the palate for very long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Smooth feel from start to finish with tons of flavor. Goes a touch thin toward the end of the glass.
O - An excellent porter, spot on for the description. The flavors work extremely well together and make it incredibly easy to drink. Second best Funky Buddha beer I have had, only behind the Maple Bacon. 882 charactersorangesol, Feb 22, 2013

Appearance - Dark in here, but it pours black with a nice head. Khaki head. Collar of foam.
Smell - Coffee and coconut in equal portions. Something sweet resembling chocolate. Maybe that's the white chocolate. Vanilla?
Taste - Very intense coffee. Much more intense than the nose. Coconut also secondary. Coffee lends a bitterness that is eased by vanilla and chocolate. Lingering vanilla flavor in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Bitterness makes it less drinkable than its more popular sister beer, but still great flavor for the body.
Overall - Tough not to compare it to Maple Bacon, but it's not up to that level. Maple makes the difference. Coconut is the highlight of this beer. 730 charactersAlieniloquium, Jan 23, 2013

The nose carries heavy, heavy chocolate along with a touch of underlying roast. Mild coconut in the background. Then more chocolate. Hersey-syrup-type chocolate. A bit cloying as it warms a bit. Flavor is more heavy chocolate with some underlying coconut character. Some roasted malt beneath. This is a hard one to score as there really isn’t much underlying beer; it’s really heavy chocolate, though not what you’d get from chocolate malt. I can’t knock the nose too much, as it was really wonderful, but have taken that into account in my overall score. 671 charactersThorpe429, Dec 15, 2012

The body sits an ink black with just a faint bit of brown around the bottom edge when held up to the light. The cap was a khaki color, creamy, and never truly receded. Thick, creamy sip marks line the inside of the glass.
Notes of coconut, creamy white chocolate, and coffee beans. It smells like a mounds bar in a glass.
Super creamy white chocolate hits the palate first, before a wave of sweet, toasted coconut. The coffee bean flavor comes out in the finish, creating an interesting turn on the palate from sweet coconut to acrid coffee beans. They didn't transition all that well. The coffee and dark roast finish is somewhat short lived.
Full body, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is on point. 
The transition from coconut to coffee is a little sharp and the finish doesn't linger all that much. However, this wins points for creativity. The combo of white chocolate and coconut is fantastic. This is a must try for anyone out there. 973 charactersColForbinBC, Nov 01, 2012

Big thanks to Preismj for sharing this bottle!
My first foray into Funky Buddha after hearing an awful lot o' chatter. This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a half-finger of dark tan foam. The nose comprises sweet cocoa, coconut, coffee, light molasses, and a kiss of almond. The end result is Christmas happiness in a glass. Up my nose. Something like that. The taste thankfully brings in more of the same, along with a toastier coconut component and the addition of some nutty toffee, completing the image of holiday frivolity made manifest in deliciousness. Oh yeah. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a downright damn-good beer, one I wish I had many, many more bottles of for future enjoyment. This beer was the highlight of an evening that had more than its fair share of strong contenders. Damn. Get some! 924 charactersTMoney2591, Oct 16, 2012

The rich Dunkin Donuts iced coffee nose and taste is uncanny but still a bit contrived for me. Could simply be not even a beer if it were given to me blind. Delicious. Tangy lactic palate.

Pitch black with a one finger light beige head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing left behind. 
Sweet malt aroma with a nice balance of silky chocolate, coconut and subtle roast. The chocolate presence is really strong with hints of milk and dark cocoa as well as some lactic cream. There's also a good bit of coconut/coconut milk in the nose that makes this beer smell kind of like a candy bar. It's slightly in danger of smelling artificial but there's a nice roasted malt presence underneath. Hints of robust coffee, toast, oatmeal and toffee round things out and make it feel more like a beer than a milkshake. 
Medium bodied with a nice balance of sweet chocolate, coconut and roasted malt notes. Very sweet up front with lots of silky chocolate and lactic cream. The chooclate is so prominent that it almost tastes like a syrup was added. This is nicely complimented by a coconut milk presence that lingers over the roasted notes Ito a sweet and slightly dry finish. There's a nice roasted malt presence underneath that cuts some of the sweetness and makes it tastes more like a porter. Some robust coffee bean flavor along with dark chocolate, oatmeal, caramel and toffee. Still really sweet but just enough roast to keep it from becoming overwhelming and one dimensional. Another really nice beer from Funky Buddha. 1,398 characterscorby112, Aug 26, 2012

Dark brown pour with a thin thread of tan cover.
Slightly acrid big bean roast. Huge coffee notes, coconut, sugar, and dark chocolate bark.
Wow...if this beer set out to be a bitter dark chocolate coconut bomb along the vein of a Mounds bar, then mission accomplished. Coffee takes a back seat through much of the taste, with only a coffee breath inducing finish to return the favor. Aftertaste lingers for a LONG while.
From somewhat cold out of the fridge to near room temperature, this beer holds its flavor profile tremendously well. Like no other beer to date and one that is simply unique.

The beer pours and looks very pretty, it is brown with tints of red on the edges, with a healthy head and plen of lacing too. 
The smell is amazing, there is just a ton of toasted coconut and coffee/espresso too that is just slightly roasty, more on the sweet side but not in a cloying way at all. Some chocolate too. 
The taste is also amazing, with more roast than the smell but just as much sweet coconut and some nice chocolate that hits later in the taste, it almost feels like drinking an almond joy but in a good way again. Espresso too.
The beer is a little thinner than id like but overall good with a nice roast at the finish.

*From notes
A: Things start well, as this certainly looks good. Dark leather brown with a creamy quarter finger head. A dense and thick collar follows.
S: Coconut coffee. Pretty awesome stuff, to be honest. It's slightly green to a point, yet it's elegant and really well put together.
T: Minty up front, yet it quickly evolves into fresh coconut, which attacks the mid. Some charred cocoa, grass, and a touch of coffee round out the finish. Like a liquid Mounds bar.
M: Bummer. Undercarbonated and a bit thin. Something cleary is wrong with the way these FB kegs were filled or tapped.
O: Maybe my favorite Funky Buddha offering of the night, sans SNACK ATTACK! This is very elegant, and a beer that I could have multiples of without getting sick of it's schtick. Easily recommended, a really solid offering from South Florida. 879 charactersRhettroactive, Jun 21, 2012

Beer is black with a thin tan head of small bubbles, decent retention, no lacing, no carbonation to speak of, looks fine.
Aroma is mostly coffee and some coconut, mild roast, a little malt.

The aroma smells like like opening a bag of shaved coconut and sticking your nose in. Coconut oil seems to remind me a little of sun tan lotion for some reason. The coconut dominated too much for me, but at least it was a pretty good coconut flavor.
In the taste I get a little more roasted flavor that really helps cut through the coconut. I still get a pretty bold coconut oil presence to it though. It was very interesting, but again the bold coconut just makes it seem too one dimensional for me to call it great.
The mouthfeel was thin and carbonation was low. Again, as with most of their beers I got to try it just feels way too thin for the style.
Overall, it was a pretty cool and interesting beer, but the coconut just dominated way too much for me. I was really wowed by Three Hour Tour a while back, this one just didn't compare that favorably for me as far as coconut in beer goes. 1,069 charactersbillab914, Jun 14, 2012

a - Pours a very dark brown, almost black color, with less than an inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident.
s - Smells absolutely amazing; like an almond joy candybar. Tons of sweet coconut, vanilla, sweet chocolate, roasted malts, milk chocolate. If you like coconut it's awesome.
t - Tastes of roasted malts, coconuts, sweet chocolate, bitter chocolate, light vanilla. A major step down from the nose. Very roasty but not as strong in the other areas. Still quite good, but nowhere near the nose.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Pretty easy to drink.
o - Overall a pretty cool beer here with a fantastic nose, though I'm sensing a theme aside. MBCP and all its variants aside, I've found most FB beers (this, No Crusts, Pina Colada) to have wonderful, interesting smells, and good, but not great tastes. Seems to me what Short's shoots for, but normally misses. This is still a very good beer and they are nailing the noses on their beers. If you like Almond Joy/Mounds candybars, this is a must try. Would love to have it again. 1,117 charactersmdfb79, Jun 13, 2012

Last snow is another very brown looking beer that verges on black, well maybe it's black, either way it's dark. A nice firm skim of foam on top that looks bright tan in color. No suds on the sides of this one. The suds become nothing after a bit. This one is all about the smell. It's rather tasty too, but the smell is killer. Scents include almond, coconut, coffee, vanilla and faint roast. They meld nice and are bright. BANG! Taste is even a impressive with flavors coming off baltic in a sense as the taste is rather large. Tastes bigger than it is alcohol wise. Big hits of almond and coconut, they are they main two. The coffee is roasted and bold with semi espresso tastes with vanilla. A small malty hit all around. The feel is a nice medium with adaquate carb that is not overkill. This is a killer lower ABV'ed porter with character, get on it quick. 917 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 09, 2012

The beer pours a dark brown color with fairly good head retention and light lacing. The nose on this beer is just great, as I picked up considerable coffee, vanilla and light coconut. On the palate... yowsza!!! This is just delicious. The beer is moderately sweet, but with a boatload of coconut to go along with the coffee and vanilla. Yummm!!! Mouthfeel is light to medium, but with a long, rich, sweet and light creamy finish. Alcohol is completely unnoticeable.
Couple of thoughts about this beer. Obviously, it's a fine beer, but I was amazed by the amount of flavor it delivered considering the (relatively) low alcohol. Also, drinkability was just off the charts; I could drink this all day. This beer really pushes the envelope (as did all the FB beers I've tried), and was just so much fun to drink. Kudos to the brewer for making such an ususual, yet still very fine beer. 920 charactersJohn_M, Jun 07, 2012

Before the beer event got to my nose, I was excited as notes of Mounds candy bars began popping into my head. Full dark chocolate and coconut nose with notes of dark roasted espresso. Taste brings bitter dark roast espresso before "mellowing" into dark dark chocolate and coconut, maybe a hint of vanilla dark berries. Fuller side of medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Fantastic beer that smells sooo good, the taste almost cant live up to the hype without actually eating a Mounds bar. 548 charactersrfgetz, Jun 07, 2012

Poured a deep, rich brown color with a small & quickly receding head that left spotty lacing. A bit syrupy looking. The aroma was incredible. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Roasty coffee and coconut in the forefront, with rich chocolate in the background. I'm surprised I got that much from the aroma because it wasn't long before I took a sip...and wow. The coconut, chocolate and coffee all come together to form some kind of amazing tropical chocolate milk beer that I've never tasted anything similar to. Someone here compared it to a mounds bar, and that's about right...only this is like a gourmet mounds beer. The mouthfeel is rich though I wish it were a bit thicker...I feel I would have enjoyed it even more.
I have also had the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter on tap and I feel this beer is better. I can't wait to have more...unfortunately there won't be many opportunities for it up here in PA but I'll enjoy it while it's here for Beer Week!

Poured black with no head. Usually there is something, but nothing. The aroma was one of the best of any beer I have ever had. Lots of coconut, caramel, and coffee. The coffee was extremely fresh and the coconut was pungent. It smelled, and subsequently tasted like a mounds bar with coffee, except much better than any mounds bar or coffee I have had. The only complaint I would have is that It could have used a bit more of a heavy mouthfeel. Otherwise, it is astounding what this brewery could pack into 6.5%.

Yes, yes, this was the best of the bunch for sure. Dark brown-black body with a thin cap of tan head; retained as a small ringlet and left a bit of lacing. Aroma: think macaroon cappuccino. This is another great example of me liking in a beer what I do not like otherwise. Specifically coconut. And coffee. Taste was an overwhelming surge of rich coffee, sweet like a sugary cappuccino, laced with chewy chocolate, vanilla, and lesser notes of coconut, and even a bit of cinnamon and mint. Great. Full body, creamy smooth mouthfeel, tasted great cooler and warmer. Could probably pass for a stout, as full-bodied as it was. Very nice. Want more.
I'll put this one down as my favorite Funky Buddha beer. 750 charactersRifugium, Jun 03, 2012

A - Pours a rich chocolate brown with a small head that leaves some small residue of lacing on the glass. Looks great in the glass.
S - Rich coconut wafting from the glass entices you for what is to come. Some secondary coffee and roasted malts with a bit of chocolate, but the coconut steals the show here.
T - Some might say that the coconut makes it too sweet, but I found it to be spectacular. Wonderful flavor of coconut, chocolate, and coffee all blended together perfectly in a glass. Could not ask for more to be honest.
M - Very nice, rich enough for a porter. I could drink this all night long. Tremendous.
For me, the star of the show today. Great event, if the Maple Bacon Coffee is better than this, it must be mind blowing.

Pours very dark brown, with a small whitish foam that settles quickly. Not particularly inviting.
The smell on the other hand is incredible. The aroma pops, just like Wide Awake and No Crusts. A lot of toasted coconut, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of lime/mint in the background. Delicious and inviting, almost like a Mounds bar crossed with a Andes mint.
The taste is close but doesn't quite match incredible nose, but it's still damn good. Again, a lot of coconut, roasted malts and coffee, milk chocolate.
Mouthfeel is pretty light, I would have liked more body to match the creamy, lush flavors.

M - Slightly light in body, even for the listed 6.5% - somewhere on the lighter side of medium in any case. Lower carbonation, and a fairly clean finish.
D - Another very enjoyable brew from Funky Buddha. A bit more heft would make this world-class. I would have no problem drinking a bomber of this on my own. Hopefully the recipes translate when they get their production facility up and running. 899 charactersMasterSki, Apr 23, 2012

Another amazing Funky Buddha beer, these guys easily stole the show this year. 382 charactersjsanford, Apr 22, 2012

Appearance: A translucent dark brown pour produces half an inch of eggshell colored head that quickly recedes to a collar - not unexpected for a beer with this many adjuncts. Could stand to be a shade or two darker, but who cares.
Smell: Fucking wow, this is outrageously aromatic. Sweet, buttery coconut is by far the dominant quality here at first, but with a bit of swishing and swirling (and spilling) the coffee comes out, along with some cocoa-like dark malt that pairs well with the potency of the coconut.
Palate: In contrast to the aroma, this tastes much more coffee-forward and rather dry. Coconut is present, but it's dialed back a bit; the sheer intensity of coconut on the nose gives an illusion of sweetness that is surprisingly absent from the palate. There's a sturdy backbone of dark malt flavors, with moderate roasted bitterness coming from both malt and coffee. The body is unfortunately rather thin; it's the only real flaw of the beer, but it's not an insubstantial one. I may be unfairly comparing this to Minneapolis Town Hall's Three Hour Tour, which brings a lot of the same flavors with a much heftier mouthfeel due to the liberal use of lactose.
Overall: My first beer from Funky Buddha and I now understand why these guys are so damn hyped right now. Excellent stuff. 1,349 characterslargadeer, Apr 16, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5My brother won a 22oz bottle of this from Ryan's Funky Buddha trivia contest on the forums. Shared with him and some great BAs at the end of tonight's tasting.
Un-labeled, unmarked brown bomber with a silver cap. Brown pour like most porters, minimal head or lace. But honestly, none of that matters when you can smell this beauty from across the room.
Heaps of fresh coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and coffee blend in perfect harmony to create one of the best aromas I've ever smelled. Traces of mint in the background. Each of us was hesitant to drink our respective pours because the aroma was so damn good. It's difficult to convey just how incredible this scent actually was, but I'll say this: I would not hesitate to purchase this scent as an air freshener for every room in my apartment.
Ratings over-inflation really deprives this beer of its glory, though I'll readily admit my guilt in this regard. Last Snow is one of the few beers absolutely deserving of a 5.0 in the aroma category. I saved the final ounce of mine for many hours after the bottle kicked just so I could continue sniffing it. Only other beer I've done that with was 2010 Chocolate Rain.
Taste holds a stronger malty character, backed up by coffee and vanilla. Coconut is here too but more subtle. A touch sweet in the middle, yet finishes with a strong surge of coffee and lingering coffee bitterness. A great flavor profile -- no doubt -- but it's overshadowed by this beer's impeccable aroma.
Only real flaw is its lack of body. Toss in a few oats to thicken this brew up and you'll get more arbitrary beer geek points from reviewers like me. But more importantly, please start brewing this on a commercial scale! Ryan & crew have ridiculous talent at brewing, and it's a shame that very few people have had a chance to enjoy the fruits of their labor.
Between EBF and tonight, I'm counting my blessings. Not nearly enough BAs have gotten to try these Funky Buddha masterpieces, and I'm glad I got to share two of them with friends this evening. Can't wait for them to expand! 2,062 charactersbrystmar, Apr 15, 2012

Smell is unbelievable with notes of coffee, cocoanut, chocolate, dark brown sugar, vanilla and malt.
Taste is exactly the same. Malt, coffee, cocoanut, vanilla, chocolate, dark brown sugar for some sweetness. This like a Mounds candy bar infused with coffee and put in a glass. OMFG.
Full-bodied, light effervescence and smoooth as silk. Nice coating of the tongue and palate. A hint of root beer shows briefly on the aftertaste. This is dessert for adults. I dare you not to love this beer. 684 charactersPorterLambic, Mar 14, 2012

A - Pours darker brown, cream-colored head, thin ring on top.
S - Amazing nose, to say the least. Coconut, coffee beans, chocolate, light roast, expresso, burnt sugars, and vanilla. You just want to hold this up to your nose and breath...yes, that good.
T - Not quite as good as the nose, yet still excellent. Coconut, expresso, roasted coffee beans, vanilla. For 6.5%, it drinks very cream-like, which is really cool. The milk chocolate notes are quite as evident on the palate, yet still very good. Finish is toasted coconut and chocolate roast.
M - Medium body, rich and smooth, light carbonation, creamy finish.
O - One of my favorites on-tap at Hunahpu's Day. I was left thinking, "what the hell just happened there." Definitely a standout on any tap list, and truthfully, one of the top beers there. 840 charactersSean9689, Mar 13, 2012

4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Funky Buddha, super psyched to find this on the menu.
Beer pours a near-black with a fluffy tan head. The smell on this one is ridiculous, coconut, chocolate and coffee come together just perfectly. The taste is almost as impressive and follows the aroma. The balance is wonderful, as the coconut and coffee stand out at first and the chocolate shows up in the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, but that's often a common complaint I have with porters. It certainly doesn't detract from the beer at all. Overall this beer is unique and fantastic, just the kind of thing Funky Buddha is known for. It's also very drinkable for such a crazy sounding beer- I instantly ordered another. 715 charactersstarrdogg, Mar 10, 2012
4.32/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had during Brewvival 2012! Served from tap into a Brewvival sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained good lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, coconut, and chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, vanilla, coffee, roasted malt, white chocolate, and a hint of coconut. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a very good brew. When I saw this one come up on the board at Funky Buddha's booth, I kind of batted my eyes at it thinking it was a Winter Warmer based on the name. But WOW! I'm glad I went back and had a go at it. This thing was insane as far as the flavors and aromas coming off of it. I don't know how they got the white chocolate flavor to stick in the flavor, but definite kudos to that one. A definite must try if you get the opportunity, which I hope to get again in the future. 977 charactersthagr81us, Feb 29, 2012

4.79/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this beer the night it was released. Actually, I had a few of them.
The summary is simple. Imagine an andes mint, coffee, and an american porter. Taste is awesome, smell is great. Poured into a snifter with a little bit of head. Left a little bit of lacing as I drank through the glass.
Smell was great and it matched what the beer tasted like perfectly.
Light and smooth mouthfeel. Very balanced with the right amount of carbonation.
Great beer, which I could have gotten a growler to go. Check it out when you can. 524 charactersjcreegan, Nov 22, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Arrives at the bar with a mocha head that sits atop the snifter of black liquid and leaves strands of lace here and there
Smell: Coffee and coconut with a vague chocolate element
Taste: The coffee and coconut flavors dominate the opening, with undertones of white chocolate developing by mid-palate; the bitterness of the coffee seems supplemented by the hops as it balances out some of the sweetness in the brew through the finish, though coconut elements can continue to be discerned in the aftertaste
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with low to moderate carbonation; just a tad flabby
Overall: Very interesting flavor combination (of course, that's what Funky Buddha is known for); while I have a minor quibble with the mouthfeel, this is an outstanding beer 776 charactersbrentk56, Nov 18, 2011
