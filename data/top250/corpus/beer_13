A solid beer I'd def drink again - smooth and juicy like most Treehouse brews.  I had Very Green the day before and preferred it over JM. 249 charactersnjcraftguy, May 02, 2017

4.08/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Amazing aroma fills the air as soon as I pour the beer. You don't have to hold it up to your nose to smell it. There's lots of fruit to be sure, but it has the same vegetal, stinging, flavor that I don't care for in Green. Its like an orange, hop juice smoothie. I guess this is what a lot of people look for in IPAs, but its not my preference. I get pineapple, peach, lemon, stawberry, kiwi, but just too much vegetable flavor to make this world class. It is good. The mouth feel is full, but a little yeasty and messy. Carbonation is low. I'm glad I got to try this, but I wouldn't trade for it again. 603 charactersdanh53, Apr 26, 2017

Mango predominates along with notes of melon, lemon, pineapple, and little hint of passion fruit at the end.  The name is fitting as this is a fruit explosion.  Unfortunately this particular beer is a tad past its prime and you can tell the taste has fallen off (the smell is still there).  It has none of the nuance and complexities of the smell or other Treehouse brews.  I wish I could of tried it fresh as I imagine it would have followed the smell when really fresh.  It is medium bodied and feels thick like most treehouse brews.  Overall this is a great beer that really shows you how complex an IPA can get. 693 charactersAmguerra305, Nov 23, 2016

A: This beer pours in such an absurd way that it makes one wonder, "Have turbid NE IPAs gone too far?" It brings new definition to the phrase "completely opaque," letting literally no light through (which makes it impossible to take a good picture of the beer). This is beyond hazy, beyond turbid, beyond murky. This is muddy. The head is nice, however, towering at over three fingers and taking forever to sink to a manageable level, leaving behind a Scrubbing Bubbles commercial in its wake. The turbidity is honestly just too much, even for the style. 4.25/5
A: Wow. This is ridiculously fruity. It is pungent with all varieties of tropical fruit, from the NE IPA typical mango, orange, papaya, pineapple, passion fruit, and grapefruit, to surprising strawberry, cherry, and lime. Nothing else gets through in the nose other than intense juiciness and pungent pith. Absurd. 4.75/5
T: What a shame. This beer suffers worse than any other Tree House beer from the mealy, yeasty, unfinished flavor. It is accompanied by the equally unappealing "like chewing on a hop,"-flavor, which may sound appealing, but if you have ever done it, you know that it is not at all an advisable move. It is also very vegetal. There IS juicy fruit there, and a lot of it is dominated by the more interesting cherry, strawberry, papaya, mango, and passion fruit, but it is swept aside by these odd flavors that have no business in a beer brewed by a "top tier," professional brewery; these are flavors that you can and do find in beers from homebrewers just getting on their feet. There is sweet, sugar cookie malt, and unlike many other NE IPAs, it does not quite blend with the hops; they are almost separate entities. Bitterness is pithy and a little less than moderate, drying the palate out, but leaving behind a Brussels sprout -like bitterness that seems drastically out of place. Juiciness is there in the aftertaste, trying and failing to compete with all the greenery and awkwardness. 2.75/5
M: Viscosity and medium and creamy, and it initially feels quite nice on the palate. Carbonation is low and pleasantly soft. Unfortunately, this also turns, with stickiness and a weird hop-burn that numbs the tastebuds, like eating peppercorn. It is not to a truly repulsive degree, but it is distracting and makes the beer a chore. 3.75/5
O: This beer was extraordinarily disappointing given the aroma, the name, the brewery, and the completely out-of-control hype. This is easily the weakest Tree House beer I have had (though overall they really do not seem to be either a consistent or particularly incredible brewery when compared to some of their NE peers), and it comes off as completely unfinished. How this is rated so highly and trades so ridiculously, I will never know. Julius, Very Green, Green, and even the relatively weak Alter Ego, Doppelganger, and In Perpetuity are all superior beers, not to mention almost everything from their neighbors at Trillium and their other NE kindred spirits. Ultimately, it is an okay beer, but "okay" is not good enough for this brewery, this price, this following, or this climate in the world of beer. Do not believe the hype. I do not want to come off like I have an axe to grind with Tree House because I actually hold them in fairly high regard (Single, Double, and Triple Shot, not to mention Good Morning are all incredible beers); I further really wanted to love this beer: I just could not do it: it just is not that good. Pair with the aptly titled and similarly disappointing "In the Unlikely Event" by The Fall of Troy. 3.25/5 3,676 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 25, 2016

4.83/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This rare offering from Tree House is absolutely superb. It has that great New England Orange Juice like, opaque haze. The aroma is truly the best part of this brew with loads and loads of pineapple and other tropical fruits. The taste is not as overwhelmingly amazing as the smell but it is still very much reminiscent of eating pineapple, oranges, and mango all at the same time. Very pillowy mouthfeel with a sparky sweetness and minimal bitterness that keeps me coming back for more Tree House. This may very well be a blend of their foundation brews, but who knows except the beer gods that blessed the brewers in MA. 622 charactersTrevor11, Oct 17, 2016
4.76/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75finally get to try this.   big pour into a snifter.   pours dark orangeish but so opaque it's almost like looking at straight pulpy mash. the outer portions seem to glow cause toward the middle of the glass the color gets darker.   nose bursts with papaya, mango, orange, pineapple, melon.   taste up front is soft tropical melons and 
tangerine followed quickly by intense  pineapple 
and orange.   seems to be many other tropical 
flavors as well and you could probably make a 
case for just about any flavor floating around in 
there.   mouthfeel is typical treehouse style so 
no complaints there. mouthfeel almost seems softer for some reason than other treehouse offerings.  finishes bitter with nice splash of pineapple at the end.   overall this beer is fantastic.   not quite as bitter as green and not quite as smooth as doppleganger.  for some reason those two come to mind so maybe this is kind of like a split between them? treehouse does everything well and this is no 
exception.  glad I got a can cause I may never get another. 1,043 characterszshaft, Oct 16, 2016

4.1/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Thickly opaque solid orange, verging on Orange Julius but not quite. It almost looks and behaves like a Tired Hands Milkshake, but again just not quite as thick or unusually tan, but more vibrant. Juice Machine is topped with a thick, off-white head that leaves behind of layer of lace every few levels.
OMG. This is my unsophisticated response at first sniff. It's just so fruitjuicy and smoothie-like, but I must clarify...only at first. I get pineapple, strawberry-banana, kiwi, lime, and vanilla cream. Then, not too long after, something spicy and perfumey takes hold and doesn't let go, with a touch of grass and oats. White pepper and nectarine pop in as well.
Spicy yeast, not Belgian but very present, comes forward in strong waves on the tongue. Flavor is not as fruity as the aroma suggests it might be, although it is reminiscent of triple sec. Something bitter runs along the backbone throughout--green stem, root of romaine, and lemon rind, brightened slightly by lemon zest.
Feel is tingly, nearing stingingly spicy, not as thick as it looks, with a medium body. It doesn't feature a dry finish but I think here that's a good thing, as it might put this over the top into tongue shredding territory.
This showcases such a complex and unique combination of spice flavors that I can't quite put my finger on it. I guess in the end, that simply makes this a true Hop Cocktail. I'm surprised I've never used or seen that phrase before, but it accurately applies here. 1,482 charactersSabtos, Oct 02, 2016

Tropical, floral notes burst when I opened can. Not just orange and citrus but tons of mango, pineapple and papaya in there as well.  The taste really follows the nose closely. Drinking a puree juice (same appearance: deep purée haze).  Aftertaste is feathery and silky smooth.
This is definitely among top DIPAs I've ever had. The only other TH DIPA I would choose over it would be King Julius. 447 characterseifster82, Sep 27, 2016

Overall, a bit too hyped for my liking. 359 charactersrodmanfor3, Sep 26, 2016

A: Pours out a dark burnt orange. It looks turbid from the moment it leaves the can, and it sits in the glass without any opacity. It looks very similar to Green; thick, almost milkshake-esque. About a finger and half of the fluffiest white head sticks around for a while, leaving strands of lacing on the glass and alcohol legs for days.
S: Juicy, sticky, sweet peach, mango, pineapple. That signature Tree House ‘juicy fruit’ bubblegum note (maybe yeast?) is there in spades, almost to the degree that I get it in Green. There’s an underlying earthiness to the aroma that I can't quite pin down... It's a bit piney and a bit herbal, but definitely doesn't overwhelm the sweet, fruit-forward notes.
T: Pretty big fruit bomb up front, but not to the degree of some other Tree House DIPAs. Starts off very reminiscent of Julius; zesty orange, fleshy mango, and juicy peach. Middle of the mouth, it transitions to a vegetal, piney herbaceousness. It lingers on this note for a while before the tropical fruitiness kicks back in and finishes with notes of pink grapefruit juice and melon.
M: Like most Tree House DIPAs, this one is as creamy as they come. Rich, luscious, smoothie-like weight on the tongue. Sweet bready malt is definitely there, but more than in King Julius or Very Hazy, the scale is weighted heavier on the side of bitter than sweet. Bitterness is medium to medium plus overall, and there’s definitely some dryness on the finish to complement the fresh-squeezed fruit juice up front. 
O: Total misnomer (or fake-out from Tree House!) IMO! This is definitely not the juiciest Tree House beer I’ve had, maybe not even in the top 5. But it very well might be one of the most complex. Whereas many of their beers (*cough* King Julius *cough*) offer extreme takes on a single style, Juice Machine seems to straddle the chasm between these styles. They describe it as a blend of King Julius’s malt bill with Very Green’s hop schedule, and I can definitely understand that. It has that sweet malt character that somehow seems to bring a sticky sweetness to the hops in addition to flavor/aroma profile that includes both tropical fruits and a herbal, piney dankness. Of all their DIPAs that I’ve had the chance to try, I’d probably rank this last on the ‘juice bomb’ spectrum, but that’s definitely not a bad thing! It's a superbly complex explosion of dank/juicy/bitter flavors with a creamy mouthfeel on par with the best of the best. 2,509 charactersavas, Sep 21, 2016

Again, like any NE Ipa, doesn't look like much. Nose is orange, cantaloupe, mango and pineapple. Juicy, smooth fruity and sweet. Delicious! Beer opens citrus, papaya and mango. Tropical fruit all around. Some pineapple and pear towards the middle with a light, boozy, pulpy sweetness at the finish. Outstanding! Feel is soft and smooth with low carbonation. Goes down really easy with a dry bite at the end. Perfect!
Unbelievably good but this isn't Tree House's best IIPA... which is saying a lot! 569 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 20, 2016

Huge thanks to my friend Sean for grabbing me a few cans of this.
Review #1250
Outrageously turbid, dark yellow ochre appearance. The liquid was capped by a tight and creamy, two-finger tall, eggshell colored crown. Outstanding retention. The head stuck around for a while and slowly fell to a frothy film. Drippy rings of lacing stuck all along the glass.
The nose was terrific. Amazingly hoppy and fruity. Juicy to the next level. Loads of topical fruits. Overripe mango and papaya dominated. Super sweet. As the beer sat, a yeasty quality came forth. Slightly chalky. Later, juicy orange notes appeared. The citrus would eventually take over.
The flavor profile was also outstanding but much more citrusy than the nose. Orange notes dominated. Quite juicy. Bit of grapefruit too. Some tropical fruits appeared in the center. Mango was most noticeable. More white grapefruit on the back end and in the finish. Slightly bitter and rind-like. Really nicely balanced.
The mouthfeel was amazingly creamy, slick and smooth. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a moderate, spritzy carbonation that frothed up nicely on the palate.
As its name suggests, Juice Marker is a super juicy and fruit-forward double IPA. That said, this beer did not strike me as being far superior to Tree House's other (slightly) more easy to acquire hoppy beers. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to try this but probably would not go to great lengths to seek it out again. 1,536 charactersDamian, Sep 20, 2016
4.75/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Wow what an amazing beer! Pour a very hazy, dull orange color.  A thin layer of foam.  The smell blows me away I am picking up predominant pineapple, followed by orange, and then some faint grassy notes.  Just an absolute tropical fruit bowl.  The taste closely follows and has got to be one of the most delicate tasting beers I've had.  Great orange, mango, pineapple, and peach notes.  After a few seconds, I get the resiny bitter flavors, but not at all astringent.  For 8.2%, scary drinkable and no trace of alcohol burn.  Definitely going to trade for this one again! 572 charactersCooper925, Sep 20, 2016

this beer is one of the haziest if not THE haziest I've seen. opaque orange.
smells like tree house. their beers have this distinctive fresh hop smell that just makes my body ready to consume their delicious beer.
taste was awesome. some fruit- melon, pineapple, citrus, and just a bit of bitterness to balance it out. Julius/Green hybrid taste wise.
feel was my favorite part (maybe, its hard to pick favorites with this beer). I was practically chewing on it. Awesome, thick, creamy, oaty goodness. 
Would cut off a pinky toe for more. awesome beer. 565 charactersJkolls, Sep 20, 2016
3.99/5  rDev -15.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75This offering by TH looks way too think. I think light went in maybe 1/16". And it's a weird shade of orange, sort of orangish brown. And it sort of glows. In fact, I poured some out of the growler into a brown 12-oz bottle to save for a friend. I open the fridge, and this one stands out more than any of the others. It literally glows. The smell is unique: lots of typical TH tropical fruit smells, but a little spice note too. It's more complex. The taste needs some getting used to. There's so much going on that my tastebuds needed several sips to adjust. It had many layers of complexity, but I'm not sure they were smooth. I kind of feel like the hype around this one is the limited release of it. Mouthfeel was unique: low carbonation is the norm for TH, there were a lot of resins, and an astringency that stung at first. Overall, I'll trade this one if I come across another one. 889 charactersGeeL, Sep 20, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Typical Treehouse look: orange, turbid, and a pillowy two finger head.
Aroma- Orange, pineapple, and mango.
Taste- Again, similar to the nose with a ton of juicy hops. Seen comparisons to this being a mixture of green and julius and I'd say thats spot on.  It has the sweet peachyness of julius while also having the acidic tangerine and pineapple you'd get from Galaxy hops in green.  Very nice mixture of flavors, and a bready malt that adds a solid balance to the finish.
Feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, soft, and a relatively thick texture.
Overall- I've had this beer before. I haven't technically, but its nothing new. Typical TH look, familiar aroma and taste, and the typical TH feel.  Which is all great and this really is a great beer, but its not as unique as anticipated. Definitely would advise against waiting in line for this for two hours for one growler like I did.  Glad I got to try it, and as mentioned its a great beer, but it doesn't stand out for their core lineup. 1,013 charactersCTbrew32, Sep 18, 2016

Insane beer.  Is it better than Very Hazy imo?  MAYBE.  But this is a must trade beer.  Looks great, smells better.  Tastes like ... insanity.  I cant describe it.  It's a mouthfeel of fruit initially with a great bitterness at the end. Feel is like any special release DIPA from TH.
Overall is this the best DIPA from TH?  I don't know.  But I would say KingJJJ and Very Hazy are right there with this.

The lightness and perfect body is what makes this one stand out. Super juicy. Amazing.  Feeling bad that I keep on giving these Tree House IPAs 5s, but I feel they are really in a class by themselves.  Hands down better than 99.99% of all other beers I have had. Well worth seeking out.  Happy I drove and got a six. 599 characterstigg924, Sep 17, 2016

Very cool can design. Probably my favorite from Treehouse. 
Pours a dark golden opaque haze as expected. 1.5 finger head with moderate lacing.
Nose explodes with peach and pineapple. I could live in this glass. 
Taste follows the nose initially and moves to dank resinous hop flavors and a perfect bitterness. Alcohol is perfectly disguised. 
Full velvety mouthfeel. Drinks so so smooth.

Arguably the most incredible DIPA I have ever had.  Actually there is no argument.  The juiciness is overwhelming with tropical flavors, with a slight hint of bitterness that is just the perfect amount to balance.  Mouth feel is creamy and full, consistent with all other TH offerings.  Better than the King and Doppelganger.  Not enough can be said of how good this beer is! 392 charactersIPAs4bourbon, Sep 16, 2016

Green is more of a juice bomb for me, and Alter Ego is more of a crispy hop bullet while Julius is just mellowness at its best; Juice Machine comes across to me close to a Second Fiddle - not as juicy and definitely on the stronger side - but a frigging great beer nonetheless. 389 charactershopley, Feb 22, 2016

Look: Classic Orange/yellow haze
Smell: Juicy Citrus
Taste: Spectacular juice bomb with a great hop balance. A lot of citrus and tropical fruit. If you like the more juicier IPA/DIPA's it's all that.
Feel: medium bodied, became creamier and smoother after about 10 days in the growler. The alcohol was barely noticeable.
Overall: IMO one of TH best beers, just wish it was a regular rotation but the amount of hops to Mack this one is probably insane. 536 charactersMatthewHopHead, Feb 10, 2016

Smell is unbelieveable, honestly how can an ipa smell like a fruit explosion. Mostly pineapple but lower hints of orange, citrus,  and finish of mango. Taste makes me question if there are even hops in this beer, a banquet of fruit that makes me want to let it linger on my tongue for as long as I can keep myself from drinking it. Feel is extremely smooth which really helps with the part mentioned before. Easily the best beer that has past my lips to date. Gonna be really hard to top this one.(Can was a month old so review may be off. Also drank side by side with a fresh cycle crank and a tree house green canned last week) 713 charactersBeer_Nye, Feb 05, 2016

Like Orange Juice at the last bits of the container type of look.  White foamy head that gives way to excellent lacing.  Aroma is very tropical when poured cold, but as it warms the pine comes to the front.  The taste follows.  Slightly bitter when cold, but very tropical and juicy, with a small amount of pine. As it warms that tropical aspect remains but the pine comes through a bit stronger on the finish.  I wish I had more, definitely one of my favorites. 541 charactersMLDucky, Jan 27, 2016

A= Deep haze, looks like orange juice that was left in the fridge too long and got a bit of fizz going.  Thin white head settles to a thin cap, lacing is clingy and sticky.
S= Big aroma of citrus juice.  Orange and grapefruit, some tropical flavors and deep resinous and dank background.
T= Just like the aroma, lots of juice, light bitterness, not much noticeable malt characteristics.  Big full flavor hoppy "juice bomb".
M= Moderate carbonation, medium body. 
O= Similar to TH's other big juicy hoppy offerings.  Full on haze and full blast hop flavors and aroma. 602 charactersjhavs, Jan 21, 2016

5/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Luckily was not working this day when TH dropped Juice Machine. Poured into a TH teku and had instant aromas of citrus fruit. The appearance was a hazy orange color (somewhat like OJ). The taste was amazing! It followed suit with the aromas. Strong Pineapple and mango upfront, with each sip having loads of tropical notes. As the beer breathes and comes closer to room temperature, the complexity really kicks up a notch. The mouthfeel was silky smooth. Overall, this has now become one of my favorite Treehouse offerings, up there with King Julius and Very Green. I REALLY hope they release this one again! Cheers! 616 characterstregan_20, Jan 19, 2016

L - hazy and murky, most ever in an IPA that I've had, and by far.  Looked like pulpy orange juice
S - heavy grapefruit, tangerine, and orange.  A lot going on here so also some melon, peach, white wine, and mango after the main overpowering smells.
T - really really nice.  Very unique and incredibly complex.  Mostly citrusy fruits, but there's also a lot of melon and breadiness on top of what i can only call a juicy, citrusy punch in the mouth
F - creamy....oh so creamy.  very unique feel for an ipa, and my goodness it is drinkable.  Crazy combo
O - Creamy juice bomb is the best way to describe this.  This was such a unique beer on every level from hazy look to super complex smell and taste to thick and creamy, but drinkable beer.  Great addition to the treehouse list I've had the luxury to enjoy.  Not many IPAs out there better than this 897 charactersrabbott2, Jan 19, 2016

T - Overly ripe peach up front with a touch of grass in the middle that is immediately washed away by melon. Surprising resinous bite on the finish
F - Noticeably dry, but not hard to drink. No alcohol presence and a creamy body.
O - Worthy of the name "Juice Machine"? Maybe not as I think the other offerings (Julius, Green, Haze, Alt Ego), are bigger juice bombs.  This is still a solid offering, but maybe not worth the asking price. 569 charactersThrewRedButter, Jan 19, 2016

But this one is so perfect, the nose and tastes of peach, orange, tropical funk, melon... so crisp and refreshing, nuanced, and smooth--esp for a DIPA-- they set the bar so high and then continue to leap over it....

Well done!!!!
L - Pours an absolutely gorgeous blood orange head. Think Green, but with a more aggressive darkness to it. A light, fluffy head tops it all off. Silky and soft. I want to rub my face in it. You can see where it sinks in some places while the rest of the bubbly structure holds strong. It's trying its very best to retain itself!
S - Aromas of deep, dark ripe orange and tangerine. Has a slightly bready character to it, showing juice isn't all it can do! Heaps of tropical fruit, pineapple, melon, mango!
T - Monstrous blast of bright peach and mango up front. Tons of juice. Fresh-cut pineapple. Flavor balance is otherworldly. Full of rich fruit flavor that assails the taste buds from every angle. Lemon lime and papaya. Galaxy hops give it that crackery undertone. So well-done. Firm, but gentle bitterness pervades and leaves a lingering spicy touch on the tongue and lips when all is said and done. 8.2% ABV, you say? Hah. King Julius had more burn than this. 
F - The moment my upper lip hit this beer, I knew it was something special. Hop juice. It has a light, yet incredibly dense feel. Like all the little beer particles are shoving past each other, trying to get to the front of the "DRINK ME" line. Liquid Jesus. Expands as it creeps throughout the mouth, saturating every last corner. This beer fills me up in more ways than you can imagine. 
O - Positively stunning beer from Tree House. Haven't had this since EBF 2014 and thought I would never see it again. Different incarnation, still an awesome beer. 
It's as if Julius and Green had a baby, then that baby grew up to be a fine young man who is not only more sexually experienced than his parents, but also taller. 1,787 charactersOompaMentor, Jan 16, 2016

Pours an orange-juice color super hazy body with a pretty big foamy white head that reduces slowly to leave lacing and a little retention. 
Aromas are quite juicy (hence the name), oranges and grapefruit dominate, citrus and guava, bursting tropical fruit. 
On the tongue is big bursting tropical fruit, lots of guava, pineapple, tangerine, watermelon, graperuit, .. all of them. This is so juicy it's awesome. Very very light bitterness on the finish.. the hops aren't bitter, just flavorful. Mouthfeel is medium with pretty low carbonation. So juicy like. 
Loved this beer, as the name implies this is just a tropical fruit bomb. Nothing bitter about this beer, just juicy. 766 charactersgcamparone, Jan 13, 2016

T: Immediately getting tropical fruits similar to Green, but with an enhanced bitterness/dankness and very crisp finish
F: Very even mouthfeel with a generous amount of carbonation that lingers on the tongue
O: Overall this is an awesome DIPA from Tree House and certainly deserves its place among their best hoppy offerings. On the other hand and echoing a few other BAs' reviews, it really feels like this is simply a mashup of their other beers poured into a can and relabeled. Given that Juice Machine is essentially KJ's malt bill and Very Green's hop schedule that may come across as an obvious comment, but the point I'm trying to make is that this beer lacked a distinct identity to me among Tree House's beers. At the end of the day this is an incredible beer. However, I didn't feel I could rate the beer on its own merit, but rather had to do so through the lens of the beers it emulates. It's like listening to a greatest hits album. Are you ever disappointed that Forty Licks by the Rolling Stones is playing? Definitely not, but it doesn't exactly push their music into new boundaries. 
Feel free to disagree - however, just know this:  if I were ever stuck on a desert island and only had Juice Machine to drink, I'd die a very happy man. Cheers. 1,494 charactersFireman_RK, Jan 11, 2016

L. Medium orange color, full of haze. 2 finger head with lots of nice sticky lacing. 
S. Tropical fruits galore. Tons of mango, peach, passion, pineapple and a bit of grapefruit. No real pine smell to speak of. 
T. Follows the nose completely. Super fruit forward and all tropical, not much citrus. Finishes very smooth with no alcohol or bitterness.

5/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: turbid and cloudy as fuck. Looks a lot like organic cold pressed orange juice. It's just an opaque murky beer concoction and it looks super cool. Nice white pillowy head with all kinds of bubbles rising to the top.
Aroma: juicy juice. I don't feel like writing out all the fruit scents I detect so I'll just describe the main players: sweet orange juice and passion fruit and of course a little over-ripe pineapple action.
Taste: Overwhelming fruit blend starting with pineapple juice. This thing bursts with actual sweet fruit juice flavors. Not sweet in the malty sense because I get very very little malt characteristics. I actually taste no malts or grains to speak of. Then I guess there is a slight herbaceous note. But its hard to deny or ignore the fruit blends in this thing. The aftertaste is as jamba juice or juice it up smoothies. I was chugging this shit like its gatorade.
Mouthfeel: silky, soft and velvety. Its about a sort of creamy medium plus but dangerously drinkable. I drank 3 cans one day and 3 cans the next day.
Overall: This thing doesn't taste like beer. Its a juice bomb explosions and that is what makes it so unique at least for me. It's one of the best beer experiences of my life. Certainly in the top 3. 1,253 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Jan 10, 2016

Turbid dark amber pour. Off white 2 finger head. Tropical fruit nose, with flavors of pineapple, passion fruit, and prickly pear. Moderate bitterness for a DIPA. Light mouthfeel, and scary drinkable. In fact, too easy to gulp. 
Juice Machine is a perfect name for this one, because it delivers the juice flavors! 412 charactersIeatlambfries, Jan 08, 2016

I've been a big fan of TrH for a while, but don't get the hype on this one. It's basically Julius (a decent, but definitely overrated, too, IPA) with more alcohol. Citrus, yes, lots of it, but basically yeasted carbonated light mandarin juice. Uneventful, forgettable for a TrH beer. Good, but not great. 360 charactersmythaeus, Jan 06, 2016

I'm a big Tree House fanboy, love everything they do and brave the crowds on a regular basis, but this one just doesn't live up to the hype.
Color is amazing, orange juice. Mouth feel is very nice and the feel sneaks up on you as it goes down easy for a DIPA. But....I prefer Haze or Green to be honest. This beer does not approach JJJulius or Very Green which is what I was expecting after all the hype.
Solid, but I've had 50 IPA/DIPAs better than this 497 charactersNichols33, Jan 06, 2016

Looks great, feel is that delicate thickness everyone has come to expect from new style IPA. 
The smell and taste of this beer is where I believe people are buying into TH hype. While there is a solid tropical vibe, it has a ton of green onion dankness that I can't get past. The second can has less of it, but it's definitely still there. Julius destroys this. 
Not a bad beer, but this isn't a top 20 IPA and not something I would seek out. 536 charactersBltByKrmn, Jan 03, 2016

Pours a solid orange color with  with a soft 2 finger head. Strong Pineapple and mango upfront, each sip just slams tropical notes. Very Julius like composure with a higher level hop kick.

Smell- OMG wtf !! Is this beer ? As soon I cracked the can I was hit in the face with massive amounts of tropical fruits : Pineapple, Orange, Mango, Tangerines, Grapefruit....is this serious right now ? 
Taste- Well it lives up to the name...as soon as it hits your palate your hit with big tropical fruit goodness, no real big pop of bitterness to speak of with just a slight bit on the back end. Just enough malt to stand up to a beautiful blend of tropical hops without interfering. Wow this epic.
Feel- the smoothest beer that has ever rolled off the tongue, Perfect carbonation, creamy milkshake feeling. I'm just about at a lost for words. 
Overall- TH always seems to out do themselves, always striving to make great beer and in a situation like this you know they'll try to top a beer like King Julius and Juice Machine which I'm not sure how...but I'm sure the folks at TH wouldn't stop until they do. Which is why I won't hesitate to get in the car and drive 165 miles for a couple of cans and growler fills of greatness. Cheers to TH and everyone who had the privilege to enjoy this. 1,218 charactersAJ721, Dec 31, 2015

4.49/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Real glad i made it before they sold out.  pours hazy orange with a light head.  Aroma hits you in the face immediately with tropical fruit, heavy on orange, and hops.  taste is a blast of fruit most notably mango, orange, and pineapple with a bitter grapefruit on the back end. 278 charactersscxcrunner, Dec 31, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This brewery can do no wrong.  Easily top brewery in USA right now.  
Look-mirror image of Julius,  Tropicana in a glass, light head with great lacing. 
Smell-  smell more Green than Julius, due to the hops used here.  Less citrus, more piney.  Still smells great tho
Taste-  great taste but imo below Julius, king Julius and alter ego.  Still that being said, an easy top 50 beer .    Tangerine flavor comes in late
Feel-  little sharper on the tongue with back end bitterness.  At the same time the mouthfeel is perfect
Overall-  a great beer.  My 4th fav Tree House IPA ,  which does not prevent this beer from still being elite in every way 649 charactersjcflorian, Dec 31, 2015
4.98/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5L - Pours an absolutely gorgeous blood orange head. Think Green, but with a more aggressive darkness to it. A light, fluffy head tops it all off. Silky and soft. I want to rub my face in it. You can see where it sinks in some places while the rest of the bubbly structure holds strong. It's trying its very best to retain itself!
S - Aromas of deep, dark ripe orange and tangerine. Has a slightly bready character to it, showing juice isn't all it can do! Heaps of tropical fruit, pineapple, melon, mango!
T - Monstrous blast of bright peach and mango up front. Tons of juice. Fresh-cut pineapple. Flavor balance is otherworldly. Full of rich fruit flavor that assails the taste buds from every angle. Lemon lime and papaya. Galaxy hops give it that crackery undertone. So well-done. Firm, but gentle bitterness pervades and leaves a lingering spicy touch on the tongue and lips when all is said and done. 8.2% ABV, you say? Hah. King Julius had more burn than this. 
F - The moment my upper lip hit this beer, I knew it was something special. Hop juice. It has a light, yet incredibly dense feel. Like all the little beer particles are shoving past each other, trying to get to the front of the "DRINK ME" line. Liquid Jesus. Expands as it creeps throughout the mouth, saturating every last corner. This beer fills me up in more ways than you can imagine. 
O - Positively stunning beer from Tree House. Haven't had this since EBF 2014 and thought I would never see it again. Different incarnation, still an awesome beer. 
It's as if Julius and Green had a baby, then that baby grew up to be a fine young man who is not only more sexually experienced than his parents, but also taller. 1,690 charactersagreenman19, Dec 31, 2015

Smooth as silk and does not drink like 8.2%. Another juice bomb by this incredible brewery. New England is Beer heaven. 192 charactersbrewmeister1984, Dec 31, 2015

I wondering how they fit all the juicy, citrus flavor into this DIPA. This beer was canned about six hours ago so I'm going with that fact that it can't get any fresher. Another in a long line of hits from Tree House 293 charactersJohnnyB, Dec 31, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Canned today (12/30/15); poured into a Tree House tumbler. The look on this is insane. I know that turbid sh*t isn't for everyone, but for me, the Hunter, it's akin to Simona Halep playing tennis pre-surgery. Good God! Can I get a witness? Amen. Fantastic head retention and lace beyond reproach. Masterful. The nose gives exponential doses of tropical mayhem that isn't overwhelming, or cluttered. The scent demands your attention, and it delivers in spades. The taste follows with all that juicy goodness in layers. Each sip gives a different interpretation of citrus, pineapple, young mango, fresh pear, rainbow, Starburst, lemon, grapefruit. It finishes dry, and it envelops the taste buds with a faint grainy cracker taste. It's not seamless, but I won't let that ruin the experience. There's a tug and pull on the end that suggests it could be tweaked to mere perfection moving forward. I have no doubt that the masters at Tree House will continue to perfect this offering. F*ck! Tree House figured something out with hops, and I'm glad they did. This beer is on another level -- above the penthouse. I truly hope they offer it year-round because I think I may like it more than Julius. I just had a beergasm. Murder She Wrote.
Murrrrrrrrrder She Wrote. Larrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrge. 1,282 charactersTheIPAHunter, Dec 30, 2015
4.92/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This beer lives up to the name. Pours a typical hazy opaque orange, similar look to Green. Smell is very tropical. Taste is pretty similar to Very Green, in a good way. Heavy tropical fruit, definitely get the galaxy hops in this. Smooth, light carbonation. Overall, a phenomenal beer. 285 charactersProp28WasBetter, Dec 30, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Im not one to get too crazy with descriptions, everyone's nose and taste buds are different. It definitely has a lot of characteristics of Green. The first glass I poured had a carbonation feel to it. Left a grapefruit, bitter finish that went really well with the initial taste of tropical fruit. Tree House honestly can't miss, I've never had a beer from them that I havent loved and they really have ruined me because I try other beers and they never can compare. Another great batch from them. 497 charactersJeff_Sandman, Dec 30, 2015
4.45/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful tangerine color with a big thick finger and a half of head with layers and layers of beautiful lacing on the teku.  Deep, deep aromas that remind me of Green, with a taste that is also very similar to Green.  Almost impossible to detect any alcohol which shocks me being 8.2 ABV.  There's a snappy crispness to this beer and a flavor that really drops off the palate and doesn't linger, in a seltzer-y kind of way.  Because of this, I don't think the name Juice Machine is totally appropriate - I'd say for my palate Haze and Julius are juicier than this.  I prefer the more round-flavored gushers over the crisp stuff but overall enjoyed it.  As someone who gets to Treehouse weekly, I don't know if I'd run back for this one, especially at $4.50 a can, but I do like getting a chance to try their seldom-made stuff and glad I got to try this one.  I'd still take Haze any day over this.  I think a 4.4 is where this would lie for me. 945 charactersVincentChase, Dec 30, 2015
