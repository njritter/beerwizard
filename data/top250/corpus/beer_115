A: Fairly aggressive pour yields barely a film of a white head. Body is a murky bright orange almost tan in color.
S: Lots of sharp pineapple and papaya, a little mango very juicy smelling.
T: Follows the nose fairly closely with a little bitterness on the end.
M: Medium bodied with a touch of creaminess slightly lower than average carbonation. 
O: This is a good beer lots of nice fruity hops still has a little of a bitter bite to it. Great beer I think the alcohol sneaks out a little in the finish but otherwise very good. 589 charactersSomethingClever, Jun 08, 2017

Huge fruity aroma - pineapple, peach, tangerine, berries, and a touch of resin. The taste followed closely. Grapefruit, followed by a medley of fruit flavors with a slight dank undercurrent. A dry, biscuity malt presence. Soft on the palate and dry on the finish. Just awesome. 390 charactersBuck89, May 29, 2017

Appearance- A super thick orange/pineapple color with about a finger of thick fluffy white head. The head fast with slight sticky clear lacing down the glass. 
Smell- A big time mix of citrus and tropical fruits- pineapple, mango, apricot, and grapefruit. All of these mix and explode as I start to pour. 
Taste- The fruit blend is even sweeter for drinking. The citrus notes blend well with just a touch of malty goodness to add an IPA bitterness. A slight aftertaste more citrus as I sipped. 
Mouthfeel- Soft fluffy feel with very smooth carbonation. 
Overall- Another classic offering from Trillium. A sweet fruit monster with excellent carbonation and nice bitterness. I only had one of these and was craving a second one. 778 charactersKdouble, May 21, 2017

I look left to right at my wife’s west coast IPA back to this mango puree & I don’t get it. Perhaps it’s my advancing age, or how my rods & cones are interacting with the Viagra. The nose brings lemon, tropical fruits, & a touch of herbs. 
Congress Street: can I go here to yell at stupid congress people who act like morons? If so, I’d drink this beer every day. Unlike most of the new style IPAs, bitterness is front & center here, a west coast IPA in an orange juice Halloween costume. Big bitterness is accented by a large helping of pine, lemon grass, papaya, mango, & dried, dead Valentine’s Day flowers. Grainy, sharp, & so easy to drink. 
Not what comes to mind when I think of a NE IPA, this slathers on the bitterness. Excellent beer. 844 charactersmaximum12, May 17, 2017

Pours a rich apricot color, very cloudy, beautiful silky pillowed 2 finger head, okay lacing.
Aroma is crisp with citrus notes and something vaguely like pineapple mixed with apricot behind it.  Others describe pineapple, melon and pine but that is not what I'm getting from it.
Taste is more mellow than the aroma.  So crisp and fresh tasting -- others have mentioned wildflowers and I don't think that is far off.  Malt is certainly present but it plays a background role to the fragile hop flavor.  This is really well done in terms of flavor profile.  Very subtle, fresh and satisfying.  Low bitterness and a lemony tingle finishes off the aftertaste.
Feel is light yet smooth and creamy.  Carbonation is low -- I do think this would play better if there was more of a seltzer feel behind it, but that's not much to knock it on.
Having tried the DDH version first I was absolutely blown away by that.  I put it on par with their Pow Pow coolaboration.  Thisversion is so much more subtle , forcing me to come back down to think about what makes a standard IPA  (or even the newish hazy IPA of the northeast) so good.  By Hazy IPA standards this is superior because it blends so very well together instead of feeling like any one component (sweet backbone, sweetish hops, thin malt profile) outweighs another.  This beer is a total winner in that category in my book.  I am so glad I have 3 left :) 1,443 charactersdigboy, Apr 27, 2017

L -- Of the Trillium beers I've tried so far, this one is the prettiest: lightly aerated pour produces a lovely three-finger white head over a hazy orange brew. Great, pillowy retention and good lacing. 
S -- Pineapple, sweet flowers, mild sulfur, mango, weed, and citrus
T -- Biscuity malts cede the stage to the fabulous palate of hops on display here. The canonical New England IPA
F -- Great mouthfeel. Dry finish with moderate carbonation. 
O -- Easily one of the best IPAs I've had. As is par for the course, the biggest downside is the high price

4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Deep apricot hazy hue. Small amount of head that barely clings to the glass befor settling into a stark white ring. Overripe mango over a whisp of hop vapor. The tropical notes really overpower the nose and its wonderful that they do. The flavor follow the nose with precision, but the hops become more assertive kicking of the back of the throat late. Creamy and gently carbonated, yet somehow crisp and dry. Simply an amazing world class flagship deserving of its continued praise. Congress Street will stand the test of time. 528 charactersdogleg_left, Apr 26, 2017

Look- Pours a hazy straw color leaving a generous two fingers of creamy white foam. It slowly settles revealing some thick lacing. A very bright and iridescent pale yellow and a sight to behold. They don't get any better than this!
Smell- Grapefruit, orange zest, passion fruit and guava. 
Taste- Succulent fruit including grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, guava and a little pineapple. A slight bit of floral taste comes out in the finish. 
Feel- Thin but creamy smooth with a bitter and slightly acidic finish. 
Overall- My first beer from Trillium and I can now say I understand the love for this brewery. It's a beautiful looking beer that delivers on all levels. This work of art is a masterpiece! I can't say much more than that as the beer speaks for itself. 897 charactersPrager62, Mar 05, 2017

The orange stands out the most but there is a healthy dose of grapefruit pith and pine. This goes for both the scent and taste. The beer is like a glass of o.j. with grapefruit pith. There is a really nice bitter finish. Very good, hazy IPA. 324 charactersFriedSlug, Feb 20, 2017

Feels smooth and creamy. Great ipa that's surprisingly balanced for a tropical hop bomb. 359 charactersDrederickTatum, Feb 04, 2017

Aromas of orange, melon, pineapple, and mango...nice and juicy. Flavors are citrus and tropical fruit forward, juicy and slightly acidic, with a heavy dose of orange, mango, melon, grapefruit, and pineapple. Subtle grassy bitterness in the backbone to balance perfectly. Smooth, mid-bodied feel, with an acidic edge towards the end. Completely fruit juice aftertaste, sweet and juicy, with a solid linger past the crisp, clean finish. Great beer. 583 charactersGarthDanielson, Dec 16, 2016

To have an IPA take me back with such a well balanced citrus / pine bittersweet punch in such a sophisticated frenzy at this point (after having well over 500+ IPAs) was breathtaking.  Consistent throughout the beer, smooth and well crafted body, terrific finish that leaves behind a crisp memory of the citrus and sweetness. 352 charactersgopens44, Nov 16, 2016

A: This Trillium IPA, the flagship entry in the venerated Street series, pours like most of their other offerings: it toes the line between the absurd murky haze of Tree House and the slight haziness of The Alchemist. It is a bright orange, and while it is not possible to see through the beer even at its thinnest, it does allow light to shine through. Hop and yeast particulate abounds, tossed around by the active carbonation, like a beer snow globe. The head is about two fingers and is pure white. Retention is excellent, eventually resulting in a solid finger of dense foam that will not recede anymore. Lacing is similarly awesome. Some will find the particulate off-putting, and it is uglier than the typical haze, but otherwise this is a beautiful beer. 4.75/5
A: Strong aromas of mango, peach, and apricot dominate the nose. Guava lies underneath alongside a piney dankness and pithy grapefruit. Lastly, a light, crackery malt presence rounds it out. Strangely for Trillium, there is a crisp and clean cut finish to the aroma. Lots of enticing and strong scents, but it lacks the complexity of other Trillium beers. 4.5/5
T: The taste follows the aroma to the letter, bringing mostly apricot and peach up front, ripe mango and guava in the middle, and finally bitter grapefruit, resinous and earthy pine, and crackery malt at the very end. Moderate bitterness creeps in about halfway through and takes over completely by the end, leaving a very dry feel in its wake. The beer never really approaches sweet, but there is a citrus juiciness that connects the whole beer together until finally succumbing to the bitter dryness. Again, this is great, but it cannot quite reach the heights of some others from this brewery. 4.5/5
M: As expected, the signature Trillium  feel is in full force. Thick, creamy, medium full liquid washes over the tongue with a pleasant, active, soft prickle pushing it along. It is remarkably refreshing with its dry finish, never-sticky feel, and the moderate bitterness does not linger too long. There is no alcohol evident at all. It feels wonderful to drink. 5/5
O: Trillium loves their Galaxy hops, as evidenced by their position in most beers that they make and their two flagships, Fort Point and this. Galaxy is a great hop, but its moderately strong bitterness and slightly one-dimensional fruit flavor make it a better accent hop than a star, in my opinion. The flavors here are great, but it is missing an X-factor to really push it into that elite level. Of course, it is a Trillium "Street," and any other brewery would be more than happy to have this as part of their lineup, but some other Streets are more appealing to take a drive down. Pair with Fiona Apple's only slight miss "Extraordinary Machine." 4.25/5 2,791 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Nov 12, 2016

S: Peach and apricot keep coming to mind, along with some citrus - predominantly lemon and lemon zest - but it's not a terribly strong nose.
T: Sweetness underneath is followed by hops - stone fruits (peaches and apricot), grapefruit peel and lingering lemony bitterness. Nice taste overall. 
M: Slightly "sharp" carbonation; call it medium in heft.
O: Very good. Not as good as the Fort Point (Galaxy Dry-Hopped) beer we had from Trillium the same night, but still a world-class beer. 562 charactersKendo, Nov 03, 2016

O: A great showcase of Galaxy hops. The fundamental feel of the brew isn't too different from Fort Point as they share a similar malt bill and bittering hop (Columbus), but whereas the fruity elements in Fort Point presented themselves in a bright and light (as if they'd fly away any minute) manner, the same elements are better grounded and feel more substantial on the palate here. Slightly sweeter finish than Fort Point, but not at all unpleasant. 724 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, light pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol for 7.2%. Overall this is an insane IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the modest bitterness. A highly amazing offering. 1,824 characterssuperspak, Oct 16, 2016

The aroma starts with loads of fresh pineapple and sweet orange and then goes into melon, grapefruit, peach and a hint of pine. Very bright and juicy smelling.
First sip tastes like they combined fresh squeezed orange juice, grapefruit juice and pineapple juice into a smoothie! Lots of tangerine and orange peel, tons of pineapple, bittersweet grapefruit, pine, hints of mango, some peach. Tropical and juicy. A bit of a bready malt backbone.

Pours like orange juice with a fluffy white head that remains as a cap and ring on top and leaves thick curtains of lace. The smell is a subdued blend of citrus, tropical fruit and pine. The taste follows with bitter grapefruit, peach, mango, orange and a subtle malt presence. Full texture with low carbonation. Impressive.

Frothy white head that settles to a ring quickly. Aroma is a big burst of tropical fruit. Getting plenty mangos upfront, backdoor with burst of bananas, pineapple, papaya, and cantaloupe. Subtle sweet malt, and earthy hops come out as it warms. Following the nose well, the taste has the same tropical fruit. Hints of citrus zest, some sweet malt. Mouthfeel isn't overly thick or palate coating, but a little resinous with the hops. Overall a very well balanced, nothing is too overpowering, and very refreshing. 584 charactersMateo2699, Oct 01, 2016

Appearance: beautiful deep hazy orange. Not obnoxious gross ass bathwater haze. But glowing orange in the light. Roughly one finger of white fluffy head. 
Aroma: WOW. Opened the can and immediately hit with bursts of mango, orange, and some pineapple. INTENSE. Unfortunately the aroma died relatively fast, but when it was a live it was a solid 3 fire emojis. 
Taste: Followed the nose exactly. Just a bit of bitterness. Nothing assertive. Really nice compliment. Bitterness was rind or pith. Excellent.
Feel: As full bodied as a beer can be without becoming chewy. Really nice to have some substance and body. Couldn't drink something this full bodied all the time, but it complimented the aroma and taste quite nicely. 
Overall: Really really impressed by this beer. The only thing holding it back from being ranked any higher is that the aroma died relatively fast. Still some subtle nose as I continued to drink, but it would have been nice to experience it longer. Definitely lived up to the hype. Stoked I got to try this one.

Hazy bright orange appearance.  Tropical citrus fruits, pineapple, mango, melon are all there on nose and taste.  The feel is really special.  It's got a super smooth welcoming feel.  I know it's a bizzare way to describe it but every sip was great as it went down.  Even after having Juice Machine (from Tree House), this held it's own very well. 410 characterseifster82, Sep 27, 2016

3.54/5  rDev -21%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3.25The beer is a light yellow with intense haze. Good thick white head but poor retention and little lacing.
The nose is wonderful. I thought I died and went to hop heaven. Beautiful lemony sweet citus with a little bit of earthy grass. I wanted to chug this beer right away based on the smell.
And then the taste... bwah bwah bwah. The flavor is lacking. Light citrus and pine but pretty watered down. It lingers like a glass of water with lemon with some bittering hops.
The mouth feel is sharp. Too much carbonation to enjoy the malt or the hops. Its like I was drinking a trapist ale. 588 charactersTheBeerCarl, Sep 24, 2016

Peachy mud. Nose is clementine, white peach and cane sugar. Actually pretty mellow but the flavors are there. Beer opens light, soft citrus, white peach and honeydew. Some subtle notes of pine try to provide some balance but this beer is a NE IPA through and through. Finishes with a touch of spice and more citrus and peach. Near perfect. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Goes down super smooth and quenching. Incredibly drinkable. 
This is Trillium's best base IPA, single or double. The balance is great and the soft, juicy flavors are perfect for dry-hopping. 627 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 22, 2016

The smell comes of in a green onion, pineapple, pine needle, and citrus zest kind of way.
The taste is a little more carbonated than most Trillium beers. I pick up on clementine, peach and a white wine kind of taste. The hops are dank and are beautifully accentuated by the biscuit malt character.
Mouth Feel is slightly carbonated with a pillow texture on the tongue. Goes down very nicely. Type of beer that you have to drink at least two.
My Overall opinion is that his beer is world class. Not like the othert beers from Trillium that are hop juice bombs. This is a Dank hop bomb that will battle with the Best.   This is a Must Try 721 charactersBeergasm1, Sep 08, 2016

The cap ascends quickly to a few fingers high dying slowly to thick pillows and a ring around the sides.
S- Bright citrus fruits merge with tropical and stone fruit varietals all from the hops in a nose with plenty of strength. Grapefruit and clementine are very distinct and the forerunners with melon, passionfruit, tangerine, lime and pineapple in the backdrop. Just about 100% a hop show.
T- For whatever reason the biggest difference between here and the aroma is a shift in the dominant flavors with honeydew and just general melon juice greatness bursting out the gate alongside the grapefruit, clementine and peach. Other notable things from the hops are pinepple, dank herbs, floral tones, pine, tangerine, orange, lime and spiciness. Just a light touch of sweetness, cereal grains, bread and yeast hints to form the shrine for the hops.
MF- Creamy and silky with some chewiness and frothy texture to the body. The carbonation is spot on and a at a high level driving out subtleties from the hops. Finishes with a clean moderate bitterness.
Like the millionth great hop forward brew I have tried from Trillium thus far and what is becoming a MA staple. This is not my first time with this hoppy beauty and certainly not the last. For fans of fruity IPAs with both citrus and tropical notes balancing each other out. Juicy but still reserved enough to not be a full on nectar. 1,506 characterscbutova, Sep 03, 2016

This smells minty to herbal almost cheesy with hops. Some pine resins to the point of almost being smokey which is weird.
The taste is aggressively bitter with pine resin, less fruit and more herbal/dank. As more sips are taken, it gets a bit like grapefruit juice.
This is medium to lighter in body with modest carbonation. Overall not a bad brew and im glad to try it but it seems like these trillium brews are super volatile and best consumed within a week of them being packaged. 610 charactersstakem, Sep 02, 2016

The nose is an amazing combination of citrus, tropical fruit, and pine. The flavor starts off like the nose would suggest, tons of orange, pineapple, peach, and melon, with some pine but balanced very well by a malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium, maybe a little thick feeling because of the medium to low carbonation. This beer has lived up to the hype for me! The smell has so much going on just as the taste does. All the flavors meld well together but each standout! 550 charactersMeyers1023, Aug 12, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bracingly bright and gripping with bitterness, Congress Street avoids many pitfalls that even great IPA fall into, which is great succulence in aroma and flavor but lacking the bitter balance that the style deserves.
Trillium's flagship IPA kicks off with a turbid haze that's suggestive of orange juice with extra pulp. A creamy and fluid white froth billows on top while an aromatic display of pink grapefruit, clementine, kumquat, lemon and lime team up with passionfruit, pineapple, honeydew and gooseberry for a fragrance and initial taste that's straight out of sherbet dessert.
As the flavor unfold on the middle palate, its juicy, tangy and teeth-churning fruitiness unleashes the full breadth of citrus, tropical, orchard and berry fruits for a medley similar to hawaiian fruit punch. Herbal late, the beer's premiere taste of fresh grass clippings, muddled pine needles, citrus peels, and chive.
Bitter, dry and fantastically refreshing, the IPA's juicy upstart dives deep into a gripping bitterness in the throat that's long, smooth and unwavering. Lightly peppery, the aftertaste is accompanied by citrus and grass deep into the next sip. 1,153 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 09, 2016

L: Very nice hazy orange-gold. 3F head, very good retention, leaves lacing and cap.
S: Nice use of Galaxy and Columbus hops, you get orange, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, and berry, along with dank pineyness. 
T: Junior fruitbomb, I would say. Lots of the aforementioned fruits along with light barley and wheat malts to balance the minor amount of bitterness. Just nicely done.
F: Light to medium body, light to medium carbonation. Good balance and construction. Higher ABV leads to quicker drying, but no heat. Very drinkable despite being kinda high for an IPA.
O: Excellent base IPA for an excellent company. 654 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 13, 2016

The pours an expectedly turbid and cloudy golden color, bright and soft, with plenty of haze that has a nice, foamy, white head, about a finger or so high, good retention and large swatches of lace. The aroma is really nice, very tropical, lots of pineapple, mango, grapefruit peel, a bit of valencia orange, light pine, mild grassiness with some mineral water and soft, sweet grain. The flavors don't really burst out, but they are quite delicious, tropical fruits, lots of pineapple, papaya and passionfruit with some floral character, a bit dank that brings out some pine, mild bitterness up front, cereal grains and a typical yeasty sweetness come across nicely, sturdy malt character with a nice lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is good, full bodied, chewy, thick and it coats the tongue super well and finishes easily enough with a dry and bitter kick.
Verdict: A great IPA from Trillium, bright and delicate flavors, tempered bitterness, soft and sweet malt character really adds to this one for me. This is probably one of the more balanced IPAs I've had from Trillium, not too aggressive on the hop front, no one flavor really pushing this beer, but instead, a more restrained, complex experience that is really easy to drink. A perfect staple IPA, one that I wish was local to me. 1,370 characterskevanb, Jul 09, 2016

This pours a very milky looking pale yellow under a modest white head.  Translucent.
Big aroma of pine, citrus, and melons lead the way with a little toasted pale malt character underneath.
Medium to full body.
The taste has to same brief encounter with toasted bread and biscuit but then the hops emerge and take things over to the bitter end.  More melon in the taste than the other esters I got. Delightful. 465 characterspuboflyons, Jul 02, 2016

Smell- faint tropical fruit, pineapple citrus 
Taste- Subtle fruit , biscuit malt mid pallet and pine late
Feel-  Little light for an ipa of this strength.    Creamy but light at same time.
Overall- I liked this beer. Solid Trillium offering.  However after having Double DH Congress a week prior, this is a big step down. 371 charactersjcflorian, Jun 23, 2016

A: Super hazy pale yelow pineapple juice. Decent head retention. Very thick and dense appearance.
S: Citrus and pineapple explosion complemented by a slightly bready contribution from the signature Trillium backbone. Very complex aromatically... Certainly not easy to describe.
T: Tropical fruit galore with a substantial bready malt balance. Orange, tangerine, peach, and pineapple. I may be biased after sampling the DDH variant, but I felt that the hop profile could've been a bit more powerful relative to the malt.
M: Classic Trillium 'house' mouthfeel. Medium/high carbonation, dry finish with medium-low bitterness.
O: The archetypal Triliium IPA. Excellent balance between the Galaxy hops and the malt backbone. Would prefer slightly softer mouthfeel, but the intensity of the aroma/taste carries this beer into my top 5 IPAs. 852 charactersavas, Jun 10, 2016

A: The beer is a cloudy dark gold color with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains strong fruity citrus and floral hops along with caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with a strong fruity citrus flavor. Then a strong grassy hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good IPA to drink for a long time. 766 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jun 04, 2016

Absolutely magnificent and aromatic on the nose, bursting with fruits not that much unlike the DDH version. Lemon, orange, starburst, passionfruit, mango, and a hint of spicy yeast in background.
Taste is toned down, which is the largest difference between this and the DDH version, but it is still a divine combination of green mango, papaya, light peach, tangerine, and faint wheat malt.
Congress Street has a somewhat thin mouthfeel, but is crisp and tangy, and not very bitter at all. Juicy frooot all the way!!! 589 charactersSabtos, May 29, 2016
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer poured a pale hazy yellow color with a thick creamy head and some nice lacing. The smell was fantastic. Tropical citrus with plenty of orange, some pineapple and grapefruit. Unfortunately the flavor didn't live up to the smell. Don't get me wrong, I really liked this beer. The flavor though was mostly grapefruit and I just wish it had a bit more of the pineapple and orange. Overall this was a great beer. I will definitely get this one again. 455 charactersDirtyDawg10, May 29, 2016

No flaws, and no suggestions for improvement, so I'm going with a perfect score for this one. 384 charactersrobroc, May 22, 2016

Served: 14 May 2016
Appearance: Pours a beautiful hazy yellow with a pearl head that doesn't stick around too long, though I suspect that the alcohol content and glassware choice could have had something to do with it. The beer almost looks like egg drop soup- it seems like if you look close enough, you can see the swirls of stuff moving around in there.
Smell: Huge tropical fruit notes: grapefruit, pomelo, lemon, mandarin, passion fruit, guava, and mango.
Taste: Very much like the nose- it's definitely a juice bomb. Finishes off-sweet, which was nice. Amazing what flavors Trillium can whip up from just using hops. It's insane. Alcohol is perfectly masked.
Mouthfeel: High body with medium carbonation. Very drinkable.
Overall: Another incredible Trillium beer and very easily one of the best IPAs I've had. Highly recommended. 881 charactersBeric, May 17, 2016

A- Congress St pours a light orange body with faint white lacing on the edges of the glass. Hazy and full of a New England IPA hop glow. This is truly my definition of an IPA appearance. Even web like lacing stabs the edges
S- prickly ruby red grapefruit scent that's pungent with those flavors. A tropical blend followed by complete bitter themes. As expected, New England hop profile at the forefront. 
T- stinging grapefruit attacks the front end of the palate. Sweet and bitter melon, cantaloupe, and a dry pineapple follow up with the faintest hint of malt on the end. Can't emphasize enough the forefront of galaxy hops in display.
M- an attack of tropical lacing flavors coating your mouth like a layer of paint. I keep circling back to stinging flavors but that's the experience 
O- again, the east coast continues to destroy the west coast. While this isn't the best galaxy hop forward brew I've ever had, it's certainly on the front lines. My first Trillium brew ends up being epic. Great stuff 1,057 characterslovindahops, May 08, 2016

This beer is good but nothing to get exited about.  The smell is citrus which is good, but not enough of it. Maybe the dry hopped version is even better.  The taste is bitter with a little citrus but mostly a combination of two hops that have a murky taste that doesn't showcase any specific flavors. Yet, it tastes pretty good.  It goes down pretty well but a little acidic towards the end.  Overall a good beer but not a beer that I would chase after. 535 charactersELS, May 08, 2016
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Consumed 5/6/16
A: Tangerine-gold with pale orange at the core and honey around the edges - hazy and opaque, as one would expect from a Trillium IPA - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a few wisps and a frothy collar, leaves streaks of lacing
S: Magnificent citrus - I've had this beer a number of times, and I still can't come up with a smart way to describe the nose on Congress - loads and loads of citrus, with some fresh-squeezed orange juice, slices of tangerines, and some ruby red grapefruit - the citrusy sweetness is balanced out by a dank herbal character - resinous and lightly leafy hops, but it's mostly juice - peach, mango, melon, pineapple, and something berry-like - some soft, pale malts at the base, touch of biscuit
T: Very citrusy, as the aroma suggests, with orange, tangerine, and ruby red grapefruit juice, flesh, and pulp - juicy, ripe peaches and apricots - waves of tropical flavors next, with some melon, mango, and pineapple - dark, herbal, resinous hops - pine - medium level of bitterness that lingers just a little bit - pale malts and grains at the base, touch of bread
M: Medium body, low carbonation, more smooth than crisp, almost finishes a bit watery, under-attenuated
O: No, this does not taste like orange juice left out in the sun
Congress Street is consistently lovely, and I have yet to find another "street" that really compares. The double-dry hopped versions of Congress Street barely even improve on a product that will already clean your sinuses. 1,515 charactersangrybabboon, May 07, 2016

Appearance - Compared to the other Trillium IPAs I've had so far, Congress Street is noticeably darker in appearance, taking on an orangish hue in contrast to the light yellow of the others. It still retains the signature head composition of the others, however, with a soap bubble texture, fragmented and disjoint, but with very nice lacing around the sides.
Aroma - The nose is tons of citrus and pineapple, with a subtle berry note, like a fruit smoothie.It's slightly piney as well, but the star of the show here is the fruit aroma all day.
Taste - Congress Street lets the hops dominate the flavor, but unfortunately the Galaxy hops struggle to really turn the engine. While the taste is quite good - especially with the tropical fruits, especially pineapple and mango, orange rind, and "green" notes - it almost paradoxically seems one-dimensional at times. It may be a result of the mouthfeel, and by no means is it not a joy to drink, but compared to the complexity of the other Trillium IPAs, Congress Street struggles to clear the bar.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, bordering light, with low carbonation. This is where the bottom seems to fall out on this beer, as it seems thin and unsupportive of the big hops weighing down on it. 
Closing Arguments - It may seem like my words are harsh, but this is still a very good beer, but below the other offerings I've had from Trillium. With a beefier texture, it'd be that much more though. 1,483 charactersnhindian, May 04, 2016

The smell is very bright and very tropical and sweet (think pineapple). Taste follows the smell, with the addition of caramel sweetness, that's borderline cloying. The feel is spectacular aside from the sweetness. Overall this is a world-class IPA, no doubt, however I wish it were a tad less sweet.

Continuing Trillium adventures. Good ride so far.
Appearance is like an opaque pineapple juice.
Smell is very peachy, with some pear. It's as juicy as any I can recall. There's also a bit of coconut.
Taste balance is more toward bitterness than sweetness, compared to their other offerings. However, the fruit flavor is still there. Peach and pear were on the nose, and those are the main two on the tongue, too. And apricots. There are a lot of stone fruit flavors in here, but they're not so strong. There's also a muted lemon zest flavor. It's a bit tea-ish.
Feel is probably the most carbonated of the five Trillium expressions I've knocked back thus far. 710 charactersZythophile, Apr 23, 2016

Nonetheless, I truly beg to differ. I think that Trillium really holds its own against all of them [Tree House is still the best though]. Congress is a deep, hazy orange with two finger soapy head. It smells of citrus especially grapefruit. The taste is also heavily grapefruit but not overly bitter by the balanced chewy softness of the mouthfeel and possibly the fact that some of the hop profiles faded after opening 2 months after bottling. All things considered, Trillium's Congress Street is something that should NOT be overlooked. 680 charactersTrevor11, Apr 08, 2016

Anyway, another winner from Trillium. Not their best though..that title (so far) belongs to DDH Sleeper Street. I see this one getting lost in the shuffle with me going forward. 473 charactersCeltics76, Apr 02, 2016

Pours a turbid dark gold color with a dense creamy off-white head that doesn't want to go away. Smells like overripe peach and mango, some pineapple and melon, guava, orange citrus, with dank earthy grass and pine. Tastes like peach and clementine, mango, melon, pineapple, passionfruit, guava, some bitter pine and dank grass, with a mild lingering biscuit note. Feels medium-full, thick and creamy with low carbonation. Overall a really great and well made IPA. 492 charactersStoutElk_92, Mar 10, 2016

S: Very fruity.  Peach, mango, lemon, papaya, and orange all wrapped up.  Also the smell of sweet honey.  Very fragrant
T: Sort of a repeat of the nose.  Highly fruity, with some sweetness.  Also has a peppery and minty quality as well.  Very fresh.  Finishes with a dry finish, though not incredibly bitter.
F: Full body, yet very silky and fluffy as well.  Effervecent quality.  Some drying bitter qualities which lend astringency, though it is very mild.  Feels like drinking a fresh tropical milkshake.

L. Hazy orange with two finger head and moderate lacing.

T. Light flavors all around that come together in a balance of west and east. Becomes more New England in style once it warms up, but pine is definitely noticeable.

4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5L -- A ridiculously hazy peach color. Frothy white head that sticks around for a bit and falls to a ring. The lacing sticks around for ages and falls down all sides. 
S -- Holy smokes -- tons of citrus, tropical fruit, pine, pineapple. They say melon, which never really smells like much to me unless it's super ripe, but I do notice the same sort of "freshness" scent that comes from less-than-perfectly-ripe melon. I wouldn't have known what to call it unless I'd read the description on the page. 
T -- Zingy pineapple, melon, a little pine, a minute touch of dank. Later on, some unripe peach comes through. The pine also becomes more predominant, but it's mellowed by the tropical notes. 
F -- There's a strong zip to it, definitely like the acidic twang that comes with really good orange juice. It's easy drinking, but the zing makes you want to take it slow and enjoy it -- a good thing, in my mind. 
O -- This is a great beer. The more I drink it, the more flavors I get and the more they tend to mesh together well. There's a ton of hop flavor in here, but the bitterness isn't overwhelming, and there's enough balance to make this downright delightful. 1,167 charactersfrozyn, Feb 17, 2016
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2522oz bottle dates 2/10/16.
Pours murky and turbid gold. Dense, whipped head of stark white. A solid skim coat on the surface with a myriad of tattered lacework for the duration. 
Aromatics are pungent and floral. Awash with tropical fruit and dankness. Peach fuzz, melon pulp, pineapple pith, grapefruit oil and tangerine zest.  Phenolic undertones follow though. 
Creamy and silky mouthfeel with a medium bodied. The oat-like silkiness is nice but takes away some of the crispness.
Ripe, juicy fruit starts the palate. Grapefruit, white peach, mango, and melons. Zero malt and very dry.
Finishes with lingering tropical, dank hops and a smooth but firm bitterness.
Great beer and super fresh. 699 charactersbrewandbbq, Feb 16, 2016

4.69/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The beer pours a hazy almost fruit juice like color and consistency with a 1/4" head of white foam.
The smell is initially sweet and fruity followed by assertive but not overpowering hops.
Taste of sweetened grapefruit balanced out with floral and only slightly bitter hops.
I thought the beer had a perfect amount of carbonation which gave is a mimosa like mouthfeel.
Without a doubt a great beer and overy drinkable considering the 7.2% ABV. 443 charactersneedMIbeer, Feb 07, 2016

S: Starts with citrus and pineapple that goes into mango and peach. Slight floral in the background.
T: Follows nose. Starts with pineapple and citrus then goes into a bitter that mixed with fruit that is easily distinguishable. The bitter plays on the pineapple and some mango until the fruits take over and the drink eventually ends a tad sweet of fruit.
F: Medium to full body mouth feel that lingers of the citrus fruit. Very nice.
O: This is a great offering from Trillium. The smell is nice with a big hit of citrus and tropical fruit and the taste follows an interesting path of citrus and tropical fruit that goes into bitter that echoes the previous fruit flavors. The mouth feel only further enhances these flavors. Amazing. 823 charactersDamasen, Feb 05, 2016

Appearance was more than hazy, it was murky, swampy, and orange, guess this is what NE IPA's are supposed to look like? Aroma is citrus, hops, citrus, and citrus. Flavor is pineapple, orange juice, grapefruit and surprisingly not really bitter. This was fantastic and now I get why NE IPA's are the thing now. If I lived near Boston I would drink this every chance I got. 427 charactersArrogantB, Jan 16, 2016

Pours a beautiful hazy orange with very small lacing head. The smell also impresses, floral, peach and mango. The malt doesn't make it too sweet, or too juicy and the hops don't make it too bitter. It really is a nice balance, which I suppose is what a good IPA is going for. Finishes bitter and dry, makes you look at your glass and go hop bitterness and dryness from... orange juice? Mouth feel is medium-high carbonation, thinner on the body than others have experienced for me.
Very enjoyable to drink IPA. 608 charactersbeantown_hopster, Jan 14, 2016

A: Pours a glowing dark golden color with a lively one finger bone white head. A good amount of lace down the glass with each sip. 
S: Smells fantastic. Lots of fruit notes pop out right away. Mango, melon a little bit of peach candy rings, kiwi and green papaya. Some caramel and a light bit of herbaceous hops. You really get something new everytime you get close to the glass.
T: I think what impresses me the most about Trillium's beers is how clean they are. This is no different. Opens with mango, peach and some caramel. The middle brings just a tickle of piney hop bitterness, which falls off into a finish of dried mango, earthy malt and a light but lingering herbal hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is on point. Just a fantastic beer from Trillium. Can't wait to try more from them. 926 charactersnotchucknorris, Dec 02, 2015

Taste - moderate bitterness upfront that is immediately followed by an explosion of tropical fruit. Decent malt bill that sees the beer through on the back end. Finish is lingering hops and bitterness.
Feel: medium bodied, very pleasant feel on the tongue, the beer offers that soft carbonation that makes the beer smooth but still have a bit of bite to it.
Very fantastic beer overall, wish I could buy this all the time! This one will not disappoint, another amazing offering from Trillium! 655 characterslokizan, Nov 28, 2015

Laces the glass nicely all the way down.  Aroma is incredible to the point I keep smelling the empty bottle it's that good.  All you smell is delicious hops, dank, flower, citrus hints attack the nostrils with veracity.  Taste was very good but a little disappointed cause the smell was so good.  Immediately get the hop forward taste I love with citrus Grapfruit, mango and the a good bitter resin grass finish.  Mouthfeel was refreshing but a little light.  Overall it's a great IPA, worthy of its #12 ranking! 613 charactersRJQ3, Nov 27, 2015

Pouring a mildly hazed orange with a dense, off white head with excellent retention, this looks great. The nose is a riot of hop juice. Peach, Satsuma mandarins, grapefruit, baked oranges, a mild caramel. Incredibly floral and fragrant, there's a lot of honey here. The palate opens with a big, fruity hop sweetness with a blend of orange, peach, nectarines, pineapple, papaya, just a riot of hops. Leafy hops, mildly gritty, mildly chewy. Bitterness is mild to moderate though more herbal than a clean hop oil. Malt is mild, a little caramel and done honey. Brilliant hop flavor, though the mild chewy, gritty character is less than perfect. Medium in body though driven by hop character. Creamy carbonation. Drying, fruity, bitter finish. A little messy, a little flabby.  In some ways, the feel and the texture really reminds me of Heady Topper. Very very good, despite all my criticisms. 946 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 25, 2015

This beer achieves a perfect balance of complexity verses cleanliness and flavor without bitterness.  Congress Street has a great citrus floral flavor with a clean smooth finish.  This ranks as one of my favorites along with Lawson's sip o sunshine and Nightshift Santilli. 313 charactersMarkhdougherty, Nov 24, 2015

S= Rich and strong tropical hop aroma prevails over everything else, makes you want to take a sip.
T= Tropical, pine, and lemon zest hop flavors.  Bit of inviting earthy dankness, easy finishing bitterness balances everything out.  Awesome flavor.
M= Medium body with moderate carbonation. 
O= Great explosion of hop aromas and flavors.  Layers of both work great with the malt structure.  Truly an excellent beer. 620 charactersjhavs, Oct 20, 2015

Murky gold pour with a plump head that lingers. Taste of melon, mango, pineapple, apricot and orange. Huge hop kick as expected; but there's also a nuanced cascade of citrus flavors with a very light malt backbone that doesn't detract from the fruit. Soft mouthfeel but the acidity is there on account of all the citrus. Light bitterness closes the proceedings. 466 charactersManapuaMan, Oct 12, 2015

Appeared hazy dark yellow with two finger white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is strong with floral, citrus and pine notes. It is a well-balanced, intensely hop-forward brew from Trillium. The flavor matches the aroma verbatim on the palate. A very solid, flavorful IPA with decent amount of hops for those hopheads out there. The bitter floral finish makes me wanting more... I polished the 750mL by myself haha (don't judge, I was thirsty). Overall an excellent IPA coming out of Boston and would love to try their Double Dry Hopped version of this as well.

Pours orange-gold in color with a finger of frothy white head the fades to just a thin coating. Tropical aroma: citrus, mango, pineapple. Taste is heavy on the citrus, namely grapefruit, with a malt backbone that supports a solid bitterness with a semi-dry finish; alcohol is well masked. Overall this a very good IPA, not a hop bomb but well balanced for an IPA. 413 charactersmnj21655, Sep 16, 2015

Look: Straw color, very murky, and a nice thick head of tiny bubbles.
Smell: Citrus, straw, a little tropical fruit, and a touch of malty sweetness.
Taste: Similar to the nose with bitter hops and grapefruit.
Feel: Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation.
Overall: a very good IPA, Trillium is one of the top beer makers out there IMO. Not this brewery's best showing. 418 charactersMatthewHopHead, Sep 15, 2015

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip
Look - A gorgeous golden honey orange color. Completely cloudy/hazy with a fluffy/frothy/pillowy white head. Beautiful glass lacing. Very easy on the eyes! 
Smell - A bouquet of tropical fruits. Pineapple, mangos, grapefruit along with some underlining piney dankness. Could have smelled it all night long.
Taste - A wonderful blend of fresh pineapple and fresh grapefruit juice! With hints of mangos and pine to go along with the ride. Middle to back of the palate you get a perfect amount of bitterness just to keep it interesting that beautifully rolls and falls off the tongue. 
Feel - Just when you thought that this beer couldn't get any better, after you swallow you are left with this creamy/velvety mouthfeel that is so enticing that you just cant help but to take another sip.
Overall - My first experience with Trillium. Let me tell you, the hype is most certainly real folks. There is a reason why people from all over seek out their beers. But now the question is.......Can it get any better? Will my senses ever experience such bliss again?? 1,097 charactersTonyjenlasc, Sep 15, 2015

Fruity aromas like mango, orange, and papaya meet more of a green hoppy spice.  Tastes of unripe fruit, creamy tangerines, and light scalliony dankness.  Pretty light and soft in the mouth.  Nice, if nothing special. I’d love to try the Double Dry Hopped variety. 336 characterswedge, Aug 31, 2015

Pours a golden orange hazy body with a nice frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave a little retention and some lacing. 
Aromas of grapefruit, citrus, fresh raw hops, tons of tropical fruits. On the tongue it's an even bigger fruit medley of pineapple, grapefruit, citrus, with a slightly bitter zing on the finish. Creamy, soft consistency, medium carbonation and body. Very nice, very well done. 
Another great IPA from Trillium I love these guys. 550 charactersgcamparone, Aug 18, 2015

Rarely, and I mean this honestly, do I give out 5's. This beer, however, is just so beautiful that it is the first IPA I've ever had to receive  5 in the looks department. Super dense cloudiness, gold with hint of orange, and a fluffy white head. 
Great tropical fruit aroma here, too, really inviting. Great tasting IPA, too, easily jumping up there in terms of the world-class IPAs that I've had. Just spectacular, super juicy with tons of tropical fruit. 
Finishes a bit heavy and slick, but a pleasure to drink. Worth the wait. 610 charactersBranfordBound, Aug 17, 2015

Taste is hoppy with essentially no initial bitterness. The finish is yeasty and dry with lingering moderate bitterness. Very flavorful. Fresh and bright hoppiness. Easy to drink.

The color is golden with thick haze and thick white lasting head with full lace stickage and fine bead. The smell is slightly fruity and tropical with mildly floral with juicy sweet and tangerine odor and hint of spice with slight yeast ester adding to the tropical citrus quality. The feel has a mild tangy and resinous quality with medium carbonation and mild malt with slight alcohol and spicy dry finish.
The taste has tangy citrus hops and light grassy taste with mild tropical taste with lingering spice and peppery balanced by malt with yeast drying yet semi-dry finish with hardly any alcohol as it finishes. The taste is great -a very good American style IPA as refreshing as is possible for the abv, so drinkable and full of hoppy goodness. 844 charactersSlatetank, Jul 20, 2015

Smells flowery forward with wet grass in it, tied together by bready malts. Very dank, hop forward nose, featuring a nice hop balance, also revealing luscious, dried orange rind.
Has a medium carbonation, with a soft, smooth mouthfeel to it.
Tastes of orange peel wrapped up bread, accompanied by wet grass and a leafy, slightly herbal hoppiness. Utmost grassy with just the right amount of orange and lime, finishing with a sparkly, bitter dryness, still exhibiting the orange as well as the brews dankness.
Drinks amazingly easy, while providing a steamlined, focused hop presence, with a good amount of bitterness to it. 691 charactersaleigator, Jul 15, 2015

This is my first time having it (drank the DDH version a few weeks ago) and there was just something weird about it.
Super cloudy, beautiful golden-yellow. Typical Trillium gorgeous looks. Very sticky, resiny, bitter, strong hop flavor. Smooth, easy drinking. Tropical fruit is heavy but something is missing or overpowering or maybe the balance is just off with this brew/batch. 492 charactersGatch, May 31, 2015

Smell is amazing. Dank pine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange peel all burst out of the glass. Taste is the same with a nice nectarine juiciness as well. Feel is light and very soft and juicy with just the right amount of bitterness. Overall just fantastic. This is my favorite beer by Trillium and absolutely world class. 516 charactersCNoj012, May 30, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Yet another hazy, orange juice appearance with a creamy white head. I enjoy the hazy beers but Trillium sure doesn't offer much in the way of variety in how their beers look, that's for sure. But you know what? I love it. 
Anyway, the aroma is a subtle balance of pine, orange, pineapple, and what seems to be pepper? I can't quite tell. Anyway, it's beautiful.
The taste is creamy and citrusy, with the piney hop resin coming in full throttle at the end. Definitely a far more subtle tasting IPA than I expected, considering the hype. But this is not a bad thing by any means. I expected something more akin to a typical "hop bomb", but got a beer far more balanced and creamy. Love it. 
The carbonation is moderate with the alcohol being well hidden. This beer has a very thick, creamy feel to it that I can always appreciate.
Overall, one of the best IPA's I've ever had. An absolutely fantastic offering from Trillium, who continue to blow my mind every time I go to Boston for a visit. 994 charactersScaryEd, May 15, 2015
3.91/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75750ml bottle served in a tulip at 47 degrees.  Bottled 050515.  Pours a dull orange-gold with a murky clarity and a rocky, two inch, bright white head.  Head eventually settles into a thick dollop of foam with delicate swaths of lacing revealed as the beer recedes.  Nose expresses sugary citrus nose, a grassy quality and a kiss of spice.  Taste comes off a bit dull - earthy hops upfront followed by a light citrus character and a mild medicinal quality that lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a consistent, even carbonation and a mild acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands.  Overall, a decent IPA but not my favorite Trillium offering.  It all comes off a bit dull. 711 charactersJwale73, May 14, 2015

S: Very hoppy, pine, some mango like citrus. Extremely fresh as it was bottled on 5/8/15.
T: Similar to nose. Immediately you can detect the powerful punch of the hops, which fades into a light citrus quality with a bit of pine. The hops are in your face throughout the sip.
M: Medium carbonation, hops are prickly to the tongue, slight bitterness/dryness aftertaste.

Pours a very, very milky/cloudy pale orange to yellow. Looks like a glass of pale orange juice. Big white, fluffy head leaves a decent amount of lacing and a thin ring and film on top.
Smells very good, but nothing overwhelming. Very citrusy with a bit of a champagne or white wine like sourness. Slightly pungent hop oil. Light malts.
When it comes to the drinking of it part, things get more interesting. It is a blast of zesty orange, pineapple, grapefruit, and some lemongrass in that order. Then some green grape sweet and sour, and closes with a piney/herbal bite, but not real bitter. Alcohol is a non-factor.
The body is pretty solid, but easy drinking. Definitely a crisp, almost champagne like carbonation middle to end. 
I am kind of all over the place with this one. I always try to rate as close to style as possible to be fair, but this one screams Double/ Imperial IPA to me.  Getting harder these days. All of the kick ass ipas are drinking like imperials. This one is like a Dirt Wolf on steroids. The flavors are crazy good, but I am not a big fan of the carbonation/sparkly feel. I guess in the end, it is all about what it tastes like. 1,227 charactersWesMantooth, Apr 19, 2015

A:  Pale sunshine yellow with 3 finger fluffy white head that lasts forever and sits like a marshmallow cap. Significant lacing. 
S:  Bright ctirus, grapefruit, lemon, orange peel, and dank hops. 
T:  Fairly citrus forward with some underlying earthy and floral hops. 
M:  Medium body with a dry bitter finish.  Very easy drinking and almost crushable. 
O:  Another nice IPA from Trillium. Just wish I could get these regularly in my neck of the woods. 511 charactersrichj1970, Mar 27, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Aroma - BIG aroma of orange citrus and some resiny and oniony hop flavors as well.  Very inviting.
Appearance - Hazy yellow with thick white rocky head.
Flavor - Matches the aroma--resiny, oniony, and some orange or lemon citrus.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and fairly heavily carbonated.
Overall - I like the full-bodied feel with the juiciness but the resiny and oniony flavors aren't doing it for me.  Overall, still a great IPA worth seeking. 444 charactersadnauseam007, Mar 17, 2015

Bottled:  10/18/2014
Type:  750ml. Bottle
Glass:  Fiddlehead Wheat Glass
Pours a hazy golden in color w/ a massive multiple finger white head that laces the hell out of the glass.  Aromas of big grapefruit, white wine, weed, and cat piss.  The flavor opens w/ some grapefruit and malt sweetness, transitioning into mild pine, and closes w/ white wine and herbal hop bite.  Medium bodied and lush as Trillium really nails this aspect with their brews.  The finish on this is pretty juicy.  Due to the great depth of flavor, absence of bitterness, and juicy finish this can be crushed in great volume.
Overall, Wow!  This is a go to IPA that you could drink everyday.  If I were a Bruins fan, which I am NOT, I would want to drink this at every game. I am going to have to start sneaking this into Penguin games at the Consol Energy Center, making sure to pour it into a cup so my buddies don't realize it's from Boston. 938 charactersmikeyv35, Mar 02, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Fresh bottle from trade. BIG thanks! Pours murky yellow golden with a one finger fluffyish white head. Looks a little flat on the pour. Aroma of pineapple juice, oranges, lots of tropical citrus here. Flavor is very sweet pineapple juice and orange zest, lightly bitter, twinge of lemongrass. Mouthfeel is fuller and smooth, but this is way on the flat side with nearly no carbonation. Everything is there flavor wise, but this really seems like it might be a bad batch or bottling given the low carbonation, and that really takes away from what seems to otherwise be a delicious treat. Hope to try it again and up the score, though it's good as is. 649 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 01, 2015

S: As with many hoppy trillium beers, you can smell the fruity/bitter goodness right when you crack into it.  Oranges or grapefruit scent is everywhere. 
T: the grapefruit/orange notes, but a piney, earthy backbone is certainly present from the light malts. There are some earthy hop notes as well.  
For a hoppy bear, the finish is quick.  
M: Like grapefruit juice. Full-bodied for the style. Carbonation is average for the style. 
O: Can't believe I've never reviewed this one.  Exceptional beer. I usually don't go gaga over hoppy IPAs, but this juicy beer distinguishes itself in a crowded field of great New England IPAs. 700 characterssnowmageddon, Feb 28, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle dated 1/31 into a tulip.....slightly older than I wanted to drink this one, but not too far out. I've had this beer the day of release before, and the overall experience wasn't all that different
Appearance: a thick, hazy orangish color with a billowy head and solid lacing throughout consumption. Looks like carbonated fresh grapefruit juice.
Aroma: Lots of pineapple and orange. Like most of Trillium's IPAs and DIPAs, the smell is incredibly potent and fresh-smelling.
Taste: Juicy, and sweet at first, tasting like clementine and pineapple, but finishing slightly bitter and resinous. Sweetness comes back to the palate between sips though.
Feel: crisp, but thick and juicy feeling. Incredibly smooth.
Overall: A very, very good, tropical-tasting IPA. The "Street" series from Trillium continues to come through with absolutely knock-down delicious IPAs. 884 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 14, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Another great IPA from Trillium. An unfiltered cloudy straw pour from a fresh growler with a bubbly thin head. A big piney hop nose. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, and pine, with a touch of tropical fruit....really good stuff. A bit of the ganja as well.... Ya mon! Nice bitterness throughout, with plenty on the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp yet creamy; a pleasure to drink. Like all of the street series IPAs from them, this is another well crafted beer by Trillium. A bit pricey at $23 for a growler, but worth the splurge. One I will remember as my Pats were winning #4 while I was having it. 597 characterstheIPAman, Feb 08, 2015

Great tropical aromas wafting out--I'm getting mango the most here I think.  Smells fruity but not overly sweet
Taste follows the nose.  I'm loving this beer.  Incredibly smooth for a hop bomb, no alcohol taste whatsoever for a higher ABV IPA.  Enough malt backbone to keep it balanced but the hops shine through.
Medium body, nice and creamy
I'm very impressed by this beer.  Been hearing good things about Trillium for a while and this was a great introduction.  Looking forward to trying others from here! 640 charactersTbub18, Jan 24, 2015

Julius was my previous benchmark for an IPA, but this is in the same league. Seek it out. 384 charactersjjdc, Jan 17, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle got in a recent IP trade, thanks Isaac.
This one pours essentially like orange juice, so orange and bright, basically opaque, with a half inch fizzy head, and tons of really nice looking lacing.
Smells pungently hoppy, like sticking your face into a bag of hops. Orange, peach, and mango puree, so fruity and nice.
The taste follows the aroma. It's a classic New England IPA- insane fruity hop flavor with minimal hop bitterness. This is dank as they come- tastes a bit like orange juice-soaked weed. There's very little bitterness, with the malt providing only a candied sweetness to the hop flavors.
This is medium bodied, with a crisp, juicy mouthfeel, and moderate level of carbonation.
This is a superb example of the new sort of IPA coming out of New England. It's on the level of the best from Vermont. 821 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 15, 2015

A: Pours a light straw color, opaque, with three fingers of pillowy head.  Generous, intricate lacing and superb retention.
S: White grapefruit and orange, a light bready malt, a soft almost creamy note.  
T: A bit of grassiness (maybe it’s pine), some light maltiness, and finishing with a light, fuzzy bitterness on the palate.  
M: Light carbonation and medium-light body.  Has that soft, farmhouse-y feel.
O: A nice effort.  Very easy drinking, though a bit lighter on the flavors (approaching pale ale territory) rather than your typical big, flavorful IPA. 613 characterspmarlowe, Jan 04, 2015

A: Gross.  I mean this might be the ugliest beer I've ever seen.  Kind of a milky orange color that was completely opaque.  Reminds me of the way Sixpoint RAD looked.  Lacing was pretty though.  I scored it a 2 on appearance just as a courtesy to the fine folks at Trillium, who obviously know what they're doing.  As my brother said: "it looks like what 'your' sour beers taste like."
N: Bright, fruity, piney hops.  A wonderful aroma.  Better close your eyes before sniffing this one, or your senses might get confused.
T: Meh.  I could tell it was a well-crafted beer, but it's just not my favorite combination of hops.  Not sure what kind are in there, but one of them gave me the jibblies.  Huge bitterness that stuck around for a while.
M: This is where the beer really shined.  A full, coating mouthfeel from a somewhat low ABV IPA, which really impressed me.
O: 4 - I rarely give such disparate ratings to the categories for an IPA.  IMHO, IPAs and stouts are either well-made or they're not, and the categories are usually not more than a point away from each other.  Those kinds of ratings are usually reserved for sours.  This one was unique.  The nose and mouth almost fooled me into believing it was a world class beer, which most people obviously think it is. 1,374 charactersCraftFan5, Dec 30, 2014

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful hazy golden-yellow brew, topped with a sizable snow white, fluffy head. Great retention and very nice lacing.
Very fruit-forward hop aroma: light citrus (lemon, orange, ruby red grapefruit pulp) and tropical fruit (mango, pineapple, starfruit), herbal and slightly dank. Just a bit of sweet pale malt grains wafting in the background.
Flavor is what you'd expect from that hop profile: sweet and juicy. Emphasis is on the tropical fruit (again with starfruit and mango), with just a hint of grapefruit juice and peel in the flavor profile, and a dank, sticky sweetness.  Pale malt biscuit and sweetness throughout, but the sharp hops cut through it all: sharply on the front, dank and lingering on the back-end.
Very lively brew, smooth and silky, with an oily retention. Bitterness and hop oils linger for a while; relatively short, dry finish to the bulk of the flavor, with only the hop oils remaining. Very drinkable, with a medium overall feel, somewhere between a beer you can gulp and a beer you have to sip.
An excellent brew overall, which beautifully showcases the modern, fruity hop profiles that have come to dominate the boutique brews on the market. Drinks like a DIPA as far as the hop blast, but the balance and ABV are single-IPA territory. 1,271 charactersRoguer, Nov 20, 2014

Pours a very hazy light orange color with 3 fingers of fluffy white head.  Great retention and lacing.  The most unique haze I've seen in an IPA.
Smell is strong with grapefruit and orange rind and a little pine.
The taste is very citrusy (grapefruit and pineapple juice) with a dry pine bitterness on the finish.
Very creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish on the tongue.  It makes my mouth water and crave the next sip.
Overall - this is a great IPA and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to try it.  The uniqueness of the look and flavor has convinced me to enter my first review. 648 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Nov 18, 2014

Location: Trillium Brewing
Draught/Bottle: 750ml Brown bottle
Glassware: Snifter
Appearance: Dark yellow to orange in color fading to clear near its edges. Solid two finger white carbonation head with fantastic retention, over two minutes. Dissipates to a carbonation ring that never leaves. Some murky haze but the beer allows in a lot of light and it is not impossible to see through. 
Aroma: This IPA starts off with a mellowed spruce hoppiness that leads us into a range of citrus fruit. Pineapple, tangerine, and mango fruit juices give this a very early morning breakfast feel. The malt presence is slight but can be found in the lightly buttery and bread crust qualities. 
Taste: Dank fruit flavors give this beer a stronger presence then the aroma credits it for. Strong mango and tangerine flavors move into a moderate low to moderate hop bitterness that can't quite be categorized as pine but closer to spruce. Similar crusty buttery pale malt flavors can be found in the finish. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied as the fruits more to the dank, but not resinous, bitter and momentarily dry. The dryness doesn't last and isn't that strong to begin with but leads you to crave that next sip. Medium carbonation but it doesn't quite succeed in cutting through those strong dank flavors.

4.75/5  rDev +6%A - Golden yellow, cloudy, completely opaque in appearance.  Much lighter color than most IPAs but the opaque OJ like appearance along with the fluffy, frothy inch plus head that laces perfectly hints at the explosive flavors to follow
S - Extremely powerful nose, dank pineapple, grapefruit, licorice, orange rind, bitters and hints of tropical fruit combine for a very unique experience.
T - Juicy dank bitter hops, more bitter than the nose let on but all of the flavors mentioned above were present and blended beautifully. 
M - light juicy carbonation, light mouthfeel in term of the consistency, explosive, popping hops that linger into a long finish.
O - This brew is a fine example of just how far IPAs have come over the years.  This is so different than any of the other IPAs I've had it could be in it's own category.  The range of flavors and hops out there make for some creative brews and this one is one of my all time favorite beers.  Trillium is as good as it gets. 986 charactersHopDeezy, Nov 08, 2014

Smell:  Subtle wafts of tropical fruit, with papaya, pineapple and a whiff of mango
Taste:  A touch of shortbread in the malt and then the tropical fruit takes over, just as in the aroma; papaya and pineapple forward with a touch of mango and orange pith; the finish is fruity and not overly bitter
Mouthfeel:  Medium body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  With the high ratings here, I thought this might be an off the charts IPA and, while it is excellent, I cannot bring myself to score it in the 4.5 range; I actually prefer the Fort Point Pale ale to this beer; still, it is quite good and I am glad to have tried it

A: Pours hazy golden yellow with greenish tinge.  Pretty foamy head for an IPA, well-retained.  (3/3)
S: Strong pineapple and grapefruit with a certain sweetness.  A little bit of unnameable floral something, too.  (11/12)
T: Marijuana comes to play with the pineapple and grapefruit.  The more acidic fruits take over, and the hang is significant. (17/20)

Lots of tropical fruit on the nose with hints of pine resin. Fruity on the tongue with great bitterness and just enough malt to balance it out nicely. Medium bodied with good carbonation. 
Overall, this is as close to a textbook IPA as I have ever had! Well balanced and expertly crafted, outstanding work Trilium Brewing. 441 charactersJohnG190, Oct 08, 2014
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%Poured an darker orange color with a 3F head in a Speigelgau glass. Some lacing.
I could smell the aroma without putting my nose to the glass. At first, a strong non-grapefruit citrus, more like orange rind. Some dank-earthiness, which transitioned to a piney aroma with warming.
The mouth feel was exceptionally carbonated, tangy, and bitter.
The taste was mostly non-grapefruit citrus- more like an orange, or citrus rind.
The beer has one of the best finishes I have tasted in an America IPA: hops galore, not off-putting, manageable hoppiness, and a deep bitterness. This is not a Stone finish- it's the same magnitude, but not in-your-face hoppy bitterness.
This beer is a sipper, unlike some IPAs which are easier to drink. Similar to a high ABV beer, one savors the taste, and it's enjoyable to take ones time drinking this beer.
It's not a West coast style IPA. The citrus is different than a West Coast IPA, and the hoppy bitterness is more piquant. 
Outstanding beer. 984 charactersbrureview, Oct 07, 2014

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%From 10/02/14 Notes. 22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. Picked up at the brewery 2 weeks ago.
Pours a hazy orange-amber color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Oranges, citrus hops, tropical fruits, juicy fruity malts, and light pine hops. Taste is very good, lightly bitter Medium body and low carbonation, easy to drink.
Overall tihs is really good; I would put this ahead of Sunshower as my favorite IPA from them, and would put it up there with their New England Red and Lineage Rye as one of their best beers so far. Lots of tropical and citrus notes and easy to drink, would buy this all the time if I could. 644 charactersmdfb79, Oct 03, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%Purchased a case that was bottled the day before at the brewery.
Appearance is light and hazy - it looks a lot like pineapple juice in a glass.
Smell is light and fruity. Lots of juice and tropical fruit.
Tastes is pineapple forward for lack of a better term. Very fruity, very juicy with lots of other tropical fruit present, but the pineapple in Congress St. stands out the most for me.
Mouth is also light and nicely carbonated.
Overall this is one of my favorite IPAs. It's the most pineapple tasting IPA I've ever had - and I consider that a good thing. It's a little pricey if you drink it all the time, but worth every penny. 
Trillium is producing some amazing beers, and they don't get nearly the hype they deserve. If you find ANY bottle of Trillium Beer, including this one, do yourself a favor and buy it on the spot. You will not be disappointed! 865 charactersRichKent, Sep 30, 2014

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy pale yellow color with slight vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Nice lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Tropical, grassy, pungent, floral, grassy, herbal, pilsner malts, and pale malts.
Taste:  Same as above.   Mild tingly bitterness in the rear.

Before I even pour, a blast of hoppy goodness hits my nose.  Pinapple and orange juice shoot out of the glass as I pour it.  Wow.
The pour is absolutely perfect.  Nice thin, white head.  Great lacing.  Hazy, greenish-orange.  Looks like fresh squeezed grapefruit juice.
Just incredible flavor.  Clean fruits, orange and lemon with a touch of biting pine.  Finishes flowery yet sweet.  Spectacular.
Mouthfeel is sticky, and all of the nice flavors stick around.  Certainly leaves a dry film on my tongue as I work through the growler.
This is a total palate-crusher.  But it is truly wonderful.  I wasn't prepared for there to be a place a mile from my workplace putting out a beer like this.  I was ready to trash this brew.  But alas, it was all and more than I expected.  Kudos, I will grab this whenever available. 867 charactersstonermouse, Sep 24, 2014

Nose is intense and bright.  Citrus, tropical fruit, a little candy, pineapple, and soft earthy pine.  The malt is present, but in the backdrop.

A: Super cloudy light orange pour. So cloudy it basically looks like a witbier. Enormous, frothy and tall light tan head. Head retention is top-notch and there is heavy spiderweb-like lacing everywhere. 
S: Oh wow, the aroma on this is absolutely incredible as soon as I start pouring it. It smells like sweet oranges and tangerines from a distance of about 10 feet. Upon closer inspection I get more tropical aspect, like pineapple and even mango. A touch of spicy pine maybe trying to break through. Wonderful aroma. If we still had ratings for each element of the brew, this would get a 5. 
T: Taste is right in line with the aroma. Very hoppy from the get go. Loaded with tropical fruit and bitter citrus. A hint of spicy pine combines with a nice big citrus peel bitter bomb in the finish. No real sign of malt that I can discern. Maybe a hint of crisp cracker malt. Long lingering grainy, bitter aftertaste. Can practically feel gritty hop sediment and hop oils floating around. 
M: Medium bodied, bitter, crisp and SUPER dry.
O: Big, bold, west-coast style IPA. Super fresh, super crisp, super bitter. Great citrus and tropical fruit. Seriously delicious and one of the very best IPAs I've ever had. Dryness is astounding which does detract from the drinkability a bit, but at the same time it really lets the hoppiness shine. 1,366 charactersDope, Sep 15, 2014

Fabulous beer--- have to go on memory as I brought this to a barbecue last night
Nose and Taste the same, funky dank hops...
Crisp and clean- enough malt to balance but sits in the background...
A great beer if your a hop-head, and a huge surprise for me since it was an extra (of course it was a HF/Lawson's DS trade) 348 charactersReady4aHeady, Aug 31, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%purchased same day as bottled on!!
poured a light golden hazy orange with a lingering inch/2 inch head
nose was hoppy with a  "typical" Trillium malt  backbone
taste was tasty, hoppy, grapefruit a bit of orange, the "typical" malt is there as well,  with a bit of bitterness towards the end
mouthfeel was medium to light,creamy, nothing overpowering.... carbonation was nice.
Overall: I quite enjoyed this IPA  the "typical" malt I referred to is one that I taste in a few of Trillium's brews,  not sure if its the malts they use or the hops can't quite put my finger on it but it is distinctive; earthy funk maybe? I guess I'll just have to keep drinking them to figure it out!.....Cheers 694 charactersShaymus, Aug 29, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Opaque yellow pour with a magnificent white rocky head that stands at two fingers and stays put, textbook lacing in teku.
Aroma is sweet tropical fruits, pineapple and pine needles come to mind, however this is a subtle nose that can hardly be considered aggressive in the hop department, especially with all the horn blowing about double dry hopping.
Taste is reminiscent of sweet pineapple juice and pine, very pleasant but mild and slightly underwhelming.
Mouthfeel is medium, and soft on the palate. No strong bitterness which may or may not be good depending on your taste.
This is a fine IPA but I was expecting a bit more pop, especially for a $12 bottle.This is worth trying but I wouldn't go out of my way given the rarity and price point.I was glad to have tried it once. 785 charactersHendry, Aug 29, 2014

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%750ml bottle dated 8/16/2014, poured into a Lawson's snifter 8/27/2014, at 40F.
A- Beautiful hazy dark yellow body with a three finger white head that's thicker than custard with appropriate retention time; lots of lacing. Its an almost stereotypical New England appearance. [4.25]
S- Strong and powerful floral, citrus and pine notes. Very clean in terms of the hops, even a bit oily, but at the same time there is a sweet caramel backbone that is just enough to balance out the hop aromas. Well-balanced, but very intensely hop forward. [4.5]
F- Bitter floral notes up front, a strong citrus and tropical fruit presence in the middle aspect that also brings out the sweet caramel which lingers all the way through to the end. The bitter floral notes up front also carries through to the end. A robust, flavourful IPA with a nice cohort of hops on the palate that appropriately balances the malt. [4.25]
M- Medium bodied, well carbonated, creamy and quite resinous but without being particularly dry or sticky. Strikes the right balance I have come to prefer from IPAs. Bitter floral finish keeps me wanting more. [4.5]
O- Excellent IPA that follows the emerging tradition of hop-forward pale ales coming out of New England. I would have liked a bit less malt sweetness as that would make it closer to some of the others from the region, but as it stands, this is pretty damn good. [4.25]

For me, this is the best IPA in Massachusetts. 299 charactersSheppard, Aug 24, 2014

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%750 mL bottle purchased at Trillium. Poured into a HF wine glass at 39F
Reviewed using the old scoring system.
A: 4.25 Thick blocky white head 1.5" thick.  Cloudy to murky straw colored body with fine carbonation. Head regenerates with gentle swirling. Fine lacing remains on the glass.
S: 4.50 Sticky dank hops with notes of pine and resin. Tropical mango and citrus fruit in the nose. Malt is muted, but thos is west coast IPA all the way. Hints of fresh squeezed OJ.
T: 4.25 Again, tropical fruit and citrus. Think mango, pineapple and papaya. Pine notes in the nose are more or less absent in the taste. Malt backbone is barely present, but that is suitable for this style. A touch of earthy dryness on the finish, but this is bursting with juicy flavor up front.
M: 4.00 Surprisngly light given the heavy handed hop presence. Good carbonation balances the richness and even at 7+ % this is very drinkable. Coats the mouth with a slight stickiness, but not overly so and the muted malts prevent overt sweetness.
O: 4.50 This is a lovely east coast version of an IPA. Aside from the 750 mL serving size, this is great.  Delicious hops up front with fruitiness and rich body. Highly recommended. 1,203 charactersF2brewers, Aug 23, 2014

Bottled 12/23/14. Unbelievable IPA. Smell is perfect, juicy hops on the nose. Taste follows with juicyness followed by piney hops. Great mouthfeel. This holds up to the big VT/ME IPA's for sure. 244 charactersNewport_beerguy, Aug 18, 2014

Nose hits you from a distance with a big hop punch. Nose is a bit messy, lots of sugars and malt that aren't really tight but a huge citrus punch blasts the nose. Taste is the same, malt is very sporadic and unrefined, doesn't get too sweet but you can tell this is big. Hops really drown out any other flavor, full citrus blast with a hint of tea and a fairly light bitterness for the hop punch. Well carbonated and semi dry finish. Interesting beer, straight up citrus hop heads dream. 562 characterscpetrone84, Jun 18, 2014

Loads of tiny bubbles in this beer and it comes through in the mouthfeel. Not sure what yeast is used, but it really brightens this beer up. Loads of carb almost like a bretted saison. Citrus rind bitterness on the tongue and a big fruity and juicy nose. This is really a fantastic and also different IPA. I'd choose this over a lot of the heavy hitters out there because of that. Easy to drink and quite tasty. 470 charactersPHBoiler, Jun 02, 2014

Appearance: Hazy dark gold. Settles out a bit as it warms. Super creamy and fluffy white head. Sticky sheets and notches of lacing. Solid head retention for the duration. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Definitely tropical. Mango and peach with a nice layer of juicy grapefruit thrown in for good measure. Sweet and fruity. Malts are on the lighter side, with a mild toasted edge and some bready characteristics. Light, slightly earthy yeast with some mild fruity esters. Some citrus rind and lime. A touch pithy with some lingering bitterness. Well balanced, true to the East coast style. Some pale malt sweetness. A bit of juicy fruit. Big bitterness sits on the back. Some pine layered with all the tropical fruit. 
Taste: A nice balance of tropical fruit, mainly peach and mango, with some underlying floral and citrus notes. Solidly but not bracingly bitter. A touch of mildly earthy yeast. Clean profile overall with a solid sweetness from the pale malts. A bit of powdery yeast as well. Some biscuit dough. Mild lingering bitterness. Some grapefruit as well. Pushes deeper citrus leaning toward lime with some good floral elements. Fruity hops push a vague sweetness. Woody green branches. 
Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth, almost creamy. Drinks so easy. Moderate carbonation. Clean.
Overall: Crush it, bring it back, and repeat.
Not playing the hop smash game. This is a straight drinking "east coast" IPA with a bit more hop presence.  frills, just a beer for drinking. 1,538 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Apr 23, 2014

3.97/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4A - Pours a super-cloudy golden orange. Almost opaque. Nice head forms after a vigorous pour. The retention is decent, and the lacing is nice. All around an excellent looking beer.
S - Blast of tropical hops and some sweetness. Some of the newer IPAs that I've had lately are beginning to go overboard with the blatant tropical hop flavors and aromas. For me, this is one of them.
T - Follows the nose. The flavor is good, but not particularly interesting to me. It tastes like hops. I like hops, but I need something more. Additional points came off this one because of the back-end bitterness. I found this sensation to be quite similar to Stumpy Duck, which I believe suffered too much from the same one-two punch. Big hop bouquet up front, detached bitterness on the back end.
M - Not really memorable. I wanted a bit more body.
O - Good, but not memorable for me. It's a beautiful beer to look at, but it certainly didn't leave me wanting another. 956 charactersAndrew041180, Apr 14, 2014

Pours a ridiculously murky hazy almost cartoony solid color, orangey carrot golden yellow, with a light fizzy head that barely covers the beer but at least sticks around for a while in the smallness of itself. But, I've had plenty of amazing IPAs that weren't the best lookers. 
Nose really is great, starting with pure mango juice, like mango puree, some guava and a bit papaya, even a hint of a musty passion fruit note, mild citrusy orange and tangerine, it has the smell of one of those awesome Dole Mango Orange + other tropical fruit style juices, like all the fresh squeezed fruit out the wazoo. A hint of a mild juicy malt base as well, a bit of pith and hint rind, quite nice.
Taste brings lots of hops, as expected, fruits and fresh tropical fruit flavors mostly, a little grapefruit pith punches through at first, then quickly into the mango and papaya, little passion fruit resin and mild musty dank fresh hop resin, with a little orange juice and grapefruit juice, and even pineapple, it seem to have it all. This is pretty much a big glass of tropical and citrus fruit juice. The pithy little rind bitterness starts to really come through, with touch of bready slightly sweet malt, and decent creamy malt, nice creamy feel that really fills out to help deliver the hops everywhere. Finish is more pith and rind, quite bitter, with more tropical fruits and plenty of them lingering, but fairly dry finish, and the faintest hint of booze late. Hops bring just a touch of a minty note and apple skin like chracter super late on the bitterness.
Mouth is med to fuller bod, fairly creamy and rich, it has the feel of actual pureed mango with lots of pulp (but no real chunks just thick), nice carb esp for a growler, and the faintest hint of booze late.
Overall awesome! I can really see where they get their reputation now. This rivals Julius and many of the Hill IPAs. So much tropical fruit, juicy, nice malt base, and great mouth feel. It really was like drinking fresh pureed smoothie of tropical fruits. 2,217 charactersjlindros, Apr 05, 2014

Appearance: Pours a hazy amber/gold and leaves 2 fingers of slightly off-white, sticky head which lingers around for a while before settling down to a layer atop the beer, with plenty of lacing.
Smell: Big juicy citrus, mango, tropical fruits, resin, pine, some floral hops. Huge hop presence - really nice.
Taste: Definitely still plenty of citrus and tropical fruits, which play really nicely. There is a bit more earthyness to the taste, but the delicious citrus hops still dominate, and it's really juicy! This is almost all hops and is done really well. Astonishingly delicious.
Mouth-feel: Medium to well carbonated with a medium, slightly sticky body. Finishes supremely smooth.
Overall: Wow, this IPA is delicious. Big flavor upfront and then finishes smooth. The hop flavors shine in this one more than in maybe any other beer I've had. Not only keep your eyes open for this one, but seek it out. 1,012 charactersResuin, Mar 25, 2014

L: Pours and incredible yellow orange color. This is definitely the best looking IPA that I've ever laid my eyes upon. There's a small  white head that fades into a small ring around my glass. Forreal though, this beer looks amazing. So juicy looking.
S: Smells like heaven. Not sure what this is hopped with, but it smells like Galaxy hops. Upon further research I am indeed correct. Absolutely massive notes of peach and citrus invade my nose like a Spanish conquistador. Not sure I smell much else, but what I smell is legendary. 
T: The taste, of course, follows the nose to a "T." Huge citrus and peach flavors come through like no other beer that I've had. Dare I say that this may taste one dimensional?! However, the one dimension that I taste is magnificent. I can taste a bit of yeast, but the mango and orange and pineapple is great. There are few American IPAs that I've had that can even contend with how great this is.
F: Medium mouthfeel and the 7.2 percent is non existent. However, I only think I could do 1 750 of this because if I had more in a sitting then I simply would not enjoy it as much as I should.
Overall: This beer is awesome. RECOMMENDATION: Get this in the bottle. I had this a year ago in growler form and while great, it was not this great. There's something about 32oz. screw top growlers that make the carbonation lower than it should be. If you see this in bottles, buy as much as you can. This is my second favorite American IPA of all time and I don't really see anything unseating this. 1,563 charactersRichD, Mar 17, 2014

Attractive spruce and grapefruit aromas. Smells fresh and prickly. 
Starts off with a wonderful pale malt base. The strong pepper hop kicks in at the swallow. The grapefruit even comes through in the taste. Long, long bitter aftertaste. Full bodied and lowly carbonated. Overall, this is a very bitter beer. 450 characterssmcolw, Jan 12, 2014

Served in a pint glass
The super hazy, yellow ochre colored beer was topped by a tight, creamy, one-finger crop of off-white foam. Solid retention. Streaks of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was bursting with hops. Incredibly dank, weed-like hop notes dominated. Amazingly fruity and semi-sweet. Tons of peach and nectarine notes. Lots of orange zest as well. There was also a noticeable tropical fruit presence. Hints of mango were detectible.
The flavor profile was really solid as well but, compared to the nose, it was definitely more dry and pithy. A pale malt backbone anchored the beer on the front end before the hops took over. Super intense citrus notes. Loads of bitter orange peel and juicy tangerine notes. Good dose of peach and apricot. Some earthy hops came through as well. The finish was crisp, dry and bitter and contained a strong grapefruit rind-like pithiness. The bitterness lingered on my palate long after each sip.
The mouthfeel was surprisingly light and highly effervescent for the style. Once the liquid settled, it turned creamy, supple and smooth.
Congress Street IPA is another fantastic offering from my favorite Boston brewery. Although this beer was definitely not as complex or as drinkable as their stellar Fort Point Pale Ale, it was super tasty and enjoyable nonetheless. 1,407 charactersDamian, Jan 10, 2014
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.532oz growler poured into a Trillium pint glass. Growler filled today, 1/9/14.
Pours a cloudy golden-orange with a frothy but disappointingly thin one-finger white head. Head retention is fairly poor, lingering for only half a minute or so before vanishing completely. On the plus side, lacing is thick and plentiful, and a persistent collar and film sit atop the beer long after the head itself has vanished. On the whole, looks good but not great.
In the nose, though...oh man, this stuff is rich! Grapefruit, peach, tangerine, orange rind, and floral hops mingle potently with subtler notes of tropical fruit--notably pineapple and mango--and a light, sweet bready malt note. Beautiful, inviting, complex.
Taste follows the nose almost to the letter, and that is by no means a bad thing. Fruit-forward on the front of the palate, with lemon zest, grapefruit, bitter orange rind as well as a sweeter tangerine note, and floral hops all leading the charge. Mid-palate the focus shifts to pine oil and light bready malt, while on the back of the palate a bitter citric oil note joins the lingering pine. An almost rye-like spiciness is present on the very back of the palate and into the finish. Finishes dry and fairly clean, the aforementioned slight lingering pine oil and rye spice notwithstanding.
Medium-bodied while feeling lush and slick. Zippy carbonation balances a fairly creamy and resinous mouthful. Alarmingly drinkable, I could finish this whole growler easily if I wasn't being gently coerced into sharing it. 
On the whole, this was everything I'd heard it was and more. Trillium has just leapt to the very top of my regional radar on the strength of the four beers I've had from them so far, and I can't wait to try more of their offerings in the future. 1,776 charactersLjudsignal, Jan 10, 2014

The aroma is very hop forward. Citrus, lemon, pineapple, tropical notes.
The flavor follows with that citrus and tropical flavor and then onto a lingering piney bitterness. This is more substantial than Fort Port. There's a bit of a bready malt backbone, but dominated by fruit hoppy notes.
A very clean and easy drinking IPA. Incredible beer. 412 charactersdar482, Dec 31, 2013

The beer pours a very nice and creamy white that lasts a bit but dissipates quicker than what I would have liked. The head does not dissipate completely and still leaves a film after it has dissipated from the middle. The beer itself is a very clear orange amber.
The beer has a nice citrus and sweet smell to it. The orange rind and citrus hops dominate the smell but is lightly balanced with sweet malts.
The taste is similar to the smell but hoppier and with different types of hops. The hops taste is closer to a grapefruit rind with hints of citrus and a slight sweet malty backbone. Despite all the hops, the beer still seems to have a hint of sweetness to balance out the flowery hops.
The beer is very smooth and medium bodied but feels lighter. The carbonation is biting. The IPA has a surprisingly clean feel to it with some light carbonation.
Overall, an extremely impressive IPA and one to be proud of. I would say that this IPA should rank among the best and will as soon as the brewery grows a little bit more. 1,070 charactersHattedClassic, Dec 17, 2013

A - Poured into a tulip glass. Beautiful looking pour which leaves a light orange color with a one finger head that dissipates fairly soon with a nice lace.
S - Very fruit forward! Grapefruits, peaches, oranges. Very inviting.
T - Awesome. Follows the nose. Fruit forward taste followed by some bready biscuit details and finishes fairly dry but not overly bitter. Hops are somewhat muted for me but it rounds out really nicely.
M - Really a pleasure here. Crisp, clean and smooth. Almost perfect.
O - Wow, this is fantastic. One of the best IPAs out there. Blends together so so well. Trillium is flying under the radar right now and they are consistently pumping out excellent offerings. 733 charactersrjp217, Nov 20, 2013

A - Poured into a standard pint glass a wonderful slightly hazy hidden hue with s dense, creamy white one finger head that fades slowly to leave a creamy sudsy blanket.
S - Aromas of nice citrus and grapefruit rind, not much malts at all this is all aromatic hops.
T - Taste is very fun, almost a combo of floral hops and tangerine/Clementine citrus notes. Just delicious, great grapefruit notes, light light biscuit finish. This is primarily citrus oil, wonderful bitter finish that while not oppressive is still prominent. Very good.
M - Mouthfeel is just what I'd want from a higher ABV ipa, crisp and clean with enough carbonation that makes this jump off the tongue.
O - Overall this beer is freaking excellent. Very well executed. Exceptional. 779 charactersrudzud, Oct 30, 2013

A - Pours a cloudy orange cold 2 fingers of really some thick white head with thick lacing.
S - Big juicy hop aroma, lots of white grape, mango, and some nice dankness, a little rye.
T - You get those big juicy fruit flavors front and on the end, but a nice pine dankness in the middle, fresh bread malt, and some spicy rye and peppery on the end.
M - No trace of the 7.2, more on the full side, love the lush feeling of this beer though.
O - Outstanding IPA, lots of fresh flavor in it, with just a touch of rye and spice bite. Great work Trillium! 574 charactersOmnium, Oct 18, 2013

Well-hopped flavor is bright and and substantial, citrusy hop bitterness mingles with tangy wine-like notes, thick but drinkable body of ale. Has a bit of rye like spice on the edges. Finishes smooth with lingering tang from the hops. Serious dose of juicy hops finishes off this tasty american ipa. 469 charactersneophilus, Oct 15, 2013
4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25A-Pours murky and milky. So much haze! The head is a mushroom cap of doughy and froth. The head is damn persistent as well. This looks like it'll be right in my wheelhouse, the murkier the better.
S-A liquified orgy of tropical hop aromatics. One of the most pineapple-stressed aromas I have sniffed. You name the exotic fruit, it's here. Then, behind that there is a healthy dose of herby/piney/earthy hops. A really satisfying, malty totem of sweet popover dough.
T- Trop-hop explosion again. It's all there, trust me.
M-Drinks with sinister ease. Great bitterness with purpose. Slight creamy feel. A bit resiny.
O/D-Another Trillium gem. I must say that the aroma is a tad bit more delectable than the flavor but either way, this is a show pony. Bring this beer back, Trillium! Very reminiscent of their Fort Point Pale Ale with a bit more brawn but a tad less finesse. 876 charactersVelvetExtract, Oct 15, 2013

A: Hazy deep gold, with two fingers of billowing white head that linger for a long time. Just the perfect image of what an IPA is supposed to look like.
S: Wow. HUGE tropical notes. Pineapple and mango really pop. Grapefruit citrus notes follow. This creamy, malt character lingers. Perfect. 
T: Huge, juicy citrus just abounds. Tropical fruits and this wave of peach just wash over my palate. Creamy, bready malt and the perfect twinge of bitterness. I love Galaxy hops.
M: Creamy, smooth and nicely carbonated. Just a hint more body and this would be my dream beer.
O: This is just spectacular. Fort Point Pale Ale put Trillium on my radar. That beer is excellent. This beer is another level. It's just phenomenal. Easily the best single IPA I've ever had. Sits behind Ephraim, Double Galaxy and maybe Abner as my favorite hoppy beer of all-time. I though Julius was good, this is even better. Massachusetts is making waves with their IPAs. An absolute must try. 1,004 charactersvonnegut21, Oct 11, 2013
