4.9/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bomber poured into a snifter. No bottle date or abv but it looks like it's a 2016 vintage from the artwork.
Pour is complete perfection. Totally dark with a milk chocolate colored two finger head that slows goes down. Really nice lacing and the head lingers even after 5 minutes of pouring it. Incredible. 
Smell is ridiculous also. Roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, hickory spice. Blown away.
Taste is unsurprisingly amazing. Huge chocolate and molasses, roasted malt, creamy vanilla, oak / wood, and a lovely bitter coffee bean flavor. I'm really struggling not giving this a perfect score in the taste category. 
Feel is perfect in my opinion. Thick with very little carbonation. The creamy head makes for an amazing mouthfeel.
Overall this is easily my favorite Russian Imperial Stout I've ever had. Honestly may be the best beer I've ever had. This is a flawless beer to me and an immaculate example of a RIS. 934 charactersaoampm, May 01, 2017

A truly dangerous beer, given that the high ABV really creeps up on you. This is such a drinkable stout, where the roasty malts and pleasantly solid amount of hopping comes together and makes this really 'more-ish'....as in, you won't struggle to take it down despite the powerful, amped up elements on display. 
Raisin sweet lick on the back end melds with bakers' chocolate and cherry. A delight. 606 charactersBarnoloid, Mar 19, 2017

Tasted great, might be one of the best non barrel aged stouts I've had. Alcohol wasn't too strong and had a nice balance, lots of different flavor notes.

750ml waxed/capped 2016 bottle shared at @mr-jj's house, supplied by him through whatever means of acquisition he has. Thanks man!
Pours a very dark brown, with a very small brown head, not a lot of carbonation. Looks good, but not particularly special. Smell is rich coffee and chocolate, I swear some bourbon, vanilla flavors.
Taste is anise, balanced coffee and sweet, soft chocolate and vanilla. Extremely well balanced, excellent beer.
Mouthfeel is very dry, amazing for such a strong bomb. Overall, this is an excellent beer. We tasted this alongside 7 barrel aged beers, and this goes a long way to prove that you can make an incredible, flavorful booze-bomb stout without barrels. I'm sad it's gone, I'm happy I got to try it. 748 characterssnaotheus, Dec 30, 2016

A: Pours jet black in color, embodying the name with its appearance. Small 1/2 inch khaki head with minimal retention. Thick, khaki colored lacing throughout.
S: Aromas consist of coffee, caramel, vanilla, cocoa, molasses, toasted malts, and toasted marshmallows.
T: Taste matches the aromas very well. Strong notes of coffee, toasted malts, cocoa, vanilla, and dark chocolate fudge. Milder notes of dark fruits and caramel. Mild lingering hop bitterness.
F: Full bodied. Thick and very creamy. Silky smooth. Mildly carbonated at a perfect level.
O: Overall, an awesome RIS. This is an extremely well balanced beer. The complexity that comes with balancing all of these flavor profiles is impressive. Surly did a great job with this batch. Can't wait to try some more of the vintages. One of my favorite RIS's. 829 charactersBeerGuy8315, Dec 27, 2016

Smell is really sharp, rich, dark roasted malt, with chocolate syrup, brown sugar, sweet roasted nuts, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate. Vanilla liqueur makes an appearance, with a hint of cedar and a lot of earthy yet bright piney hops.
Taste is dark chocolate, maple sweetness, blueberry-esque coffee, and vanilla! That wonderful fruity coffee just pops throughout. A slightly bittering nip of cacao runs along the background.
Feel is really smooth, slick and wet with a moderate yet substantial body. This is very well made and nearing liqueur territory, with a semi-dry finish to assist in cutting the sweetness. Darkness is still overall sweet, and slightly tart with all of its acidic and slightly fruity coffee.
2015 vintage

2016 vintage update: damn, this Cerberus version is no slouch either. Having it more fresh, it's certainly more hoppy and a little spicier, but all around is the same delicious, sultry dark beer with lots of bright flavors to contrast the dark lusciousness. 1,146 charactersSabtos, Dec 23, 2016

4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Absolutely jet black under a promontory rise of dark sandstone froth.  
Wet rye bread, dark rum, molasses, canned fruit cocktail, and chocolate brownie batter aroma.
Densely dark chocolately as it initially assaults the tongue.  Scrapings of char and espresso.  Quells some with a broader glazed donut notion fills the mouth.  Spiciness hits and it's like biting into a rye loaf, and equally as mouth filling.  Fruitiness washes in with burnt peaches, grilled pineapples, bruised pears, blackberries, and blueberries.  Backing notes of molasses and, vanilla give it a Caribbean dark rum aura, complete with vapors of heat.  Rides out with touches of burnt fruit alcohol sourness and chocolate chip cookie dough batter.
It's thick as fuck.  Crazy big.  But somehow still never over sweet, over big, or over boozy.
I just needed to join the choir here.  So many Whales don't deliver in full.  I was glad to finally track down a bottle (and then was less pleased to drop $20 for it).   
But I'd do again, and again, and again. 1,023 characterscokes, Dec 09, 2016

Appearance:  A one mocha head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a pitch black color with no vision of anything. 
Smell:  Milk chocolate, roasted, toffee, caramel, molasses, toasted, dark fruits, and nice subtle warm alcohol.
Taste:  Very tasty, nice flavor, so smooth, some soy, light bitterness, and very enjoyable.  Definitely a sipper.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium bodied, light bodied, silky, creamy, medium carbonation, slight warm booze, and light light bitterness.  
Overall:  Pretty solid RIS.  Holding onto the other 2 bottles for several years down the road. 625 charactersFlounder57, Nov 28, 2016

Creates a small pale Caramel colored head that recedes quickly but leaves some lacing. Smell is dried cherries. Hint of chocolate. The taste is hard to pick apart at first. But once it warms up, You get the cherry, chocolate and raisin. The feel is unlike any other beer 342 charactersChizzlethespeez, Nov 25, 2016

(it could've just been a bad pour on my part) Mouthfeel was substantial and slick, although not crazy slick. Dark fruits, bit of coffee, some cherry... a lot going on. And it morphed often as it warmed.mThere was something new every few minutes. Super complex. Loved it. I'm normally a BA guy, but this beer is proof that BA can be overrated. This beer is brilliant as is. 480 charactersracerdave, Nov 19, 2016

4.92/5  rDev +11.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5First time this beer came to Iowa in bombers(or at all).  I got this by accident since there is a frenzy for this.
Poured into my normal glass and got a great light tan head and nose that shows it's colors.  Chocolate, booze, malt.  The color is very dark brown and "clear".
Taste is true to form.  Lots of flavor with dark chocolate, some oakiness, hints of cherries and not overly bitter.  I found this to be a very balanced stout.  Not quite as thick and high gravity as others but i don't care because the taste is what really counts.  
The mouth feel is perfect.  Just enough carbonation and plenty of lingering taste.  I suggest drinking this at about 50F,  This is a top shelf stout.  No wonder about 2000 people stand in line at the brewery for this.  I walked right up to the register and forked over the cash.  Then my kids bought me 2 more so I ended up with three bottles to relish.  One of the best. 915 charactersdaledeee, Nov 11, 2016

I highly recommend this for those that love pure Russian Imperials. There is none better than this one. Rating is based on the style. 443 charactersDetlef90, Nov 08, 2016

Appearance: poured a pitched black color with a beautiful rich brown head. 
Aroma: almost mainly rich malted milk chocolate. 
Flavor: very sweet and chocolatey-like. Could almost compare it to drinking chocolate milk but with a more roast character. It was slightly hoppy at the finish, leaving a somewhat annoying bitter aftertaste. The flavors are one dimensional, really not much more I could taste.
Mouthfeel: very thick and creamy. Full-bodied and rich. 
Overall: everything was above par but the flavors could be way better. Not something I would ever buy again for $20. 595 charactersBenish, Oct 27, 2016

4.52/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I always enjoy going to Darkness Eve at Stub & Herbs not for the darkness itself, but for all the other rare beers they would get (BCBCS, for example, and the unexpected free bottles of KBS last year). Nonetheless, I'm cracking this 2016 bottle to honor Todd Haug who recently stepped down as brewmaster at Surly.
A - Pours into my B&B XL snifter with a deep motor oil color and sexy tan head with oily-looking bubbles and lacing in the glass. Some of the foam glued itself to the side of the snifter, and it won't budge. Intimidating for sure!
S - A multitude of fudgey chocolates, anise, a hint of dark fruits (dates?), caramel sweetness and hops on the nose. 
T - Follows the nose. Very good. It is a bit on the sweeter side and is definitely a dessert beer, but the nice fudge/anise combo makes for an excellent dessert. The earthy hops make an appearance here as well. I imagine that this stuff could be aged for years! Marshmallow candy aftertaste that can only be described as utter decadence.
M - Sweet but not cloying, thick but not sludge-like. Lower carb which is appropriate for the style. Alcohol is there but it is kept in check by the sweetness.
O - I think this batch is great. While I admit to passing over this beer for others simply because it is produced in my area, it is world class and would hold its own against any other RIS produced today. It is quite unique and definitely deserves the following it has achieved over the years. Thanks Todd (the axe man) and Omar for making it happen - let's see where the future takes this operation. 1,566 charactersgregy55902, Oct 25, 2016

L: Beautiful dark with a slight reddish tint.  Poured into a large snifter yielding about a 1 inch tan head that dissipates over a couple of minutes.
S: Strong, sweet raisin, juicy dates.  
T: Everything promised by the smell enhanced!  Raisin/date, coffee.  Great taste left on the tongue. Complex sweet dates and roasted coffee blended perfectly.  After it warms up - more prevalent nutty taste.  After taste is pleasant.  Alcohol is there, but hiding behind the curtain - careful with this one - it sneaked up on me quickly.
F: Chewy, smooth. Perfect carbonation.
O:  Perfect Russian Imperial Stout.  Up the same level with Bell's Expedition Stout and Old Rasputin.  Amazing complexity.  Can't wait to see how this cellars and develops! 774 charactersSchimms, Oct 24, 2016

A: 1/4 head on gentle pour.

Appearance: It was pretty much pitch black with a half finger beige head that dissipated fairly quickly, leaving sparse lacing.
Aroma: Chocolate, vanilla, roast and hints of dark fruit.
Taste: Dark fruit, plum, prune, chocolate, roast, vanilla and caramel.
Mouthfeel: Rich, creamy, full bodied with light carbonation.
Overall: This was really good. Really nice aromas and great flavours. It’s a sipper, but the dark fruit, chocolate and caramel works well. 571 characterskitch, Aug 02, 2016

Taste was also quad like, all that dark fruit booze.  Take Dark Lord, thin it out, swap sweetness for bitterness and rotting dark fruit, you get Darkness.  Roasting of the malt no doubt contributes to the bitterness here, but things like coffee and chocolate malt are just obscured to the max here.

There are things to like about this beer. 
But, is it possible that your ratings are have been bamboozled by the alcohol?
While Darkness has all the smells and initial sensory attack of a barrel-aged very strong stout, it loses me when the alcohol hits me in the face. (I kept this plugged for 4 days and it was not as bad on the 4th, but my buds remember an extreme event.) 
Fortunately, someone gave me two bottles and I will keep the second for, say, 2018 and will be glad to revisit this review then.
Until then, beware of purveyors who play to our lesser instincts. 586 charactersBeginner2, May 06, 2016

I get aromas of dark chocolate, roast, fig, and piney hops. 
Delicious, dark fruit, chocolate, and a pleasant hop bitterness. The dark fruit dominates with the chocolate comin throw mid palate. The hops play really nice. Just an incredible beer.
The mouthfeel is fairly thick with a nice warming as it goes down.
Overall, this is a very good, not worth $20 but good. 419 charactersScott17Taylor, Apr 28, 2016

Aroma is multi faceted with lots of complexity; I seem to get a different angle with each smell. Initially I get lots of dark chocolate roast, citrus oil and pine resin. This immediately begins morphing into prune, toffee, tobacco, smoke and ash, spices (nutmeg and vanilla), blackstrap molasses, espresso, even a touch of almond. It's amazing- all of these really heavy duty aromas taking turns with each other, yet the sum of the parts never overwhelms. If there is a constant throughout, it's the bitter dark chocolate.
And on the palate it's smooth, rich, and surprisingly tightly knit. Again, an amazingly harmonious blend of flavors for such a powerful beer. Toffee and dark fruits provide a solid platform from where the other elements nimbly move about. The spices play an incredible role as a conductor, too, seemingly present whenever I get the chocolate, espresso, nuts, citrus peel. Bitterness and alcohol are exactly where necessity deems them to be, keeping the whole thing sharp and exciting, but even not coming close to stealing the show. Great jumping crawdaddies!: power and finesse going hand in hand. This is a freakin' masterpiece of a beer, and I must admit that it bests my greatest expectations. 1,382 charactersTongoRad, Apr 12, 2016

T: pretty darn sweet with huge chocolate, vanilla, raisin, licorice, plum, excellent complexity. 
M: Rich & thick. Sweet finish, lasts and lasts. Really pleasant. Very little boozy feel.

I still remember finding the '11 version at 11:30 pm at an Uptown bar of that year and wondering if it could get any better.  
This is the non-b/a/ '14 edition (not the one available in bottles which is aged in rye whisky barrels), on tap at the Lyndale tap, into a snifter with a thin khaki head that subsides after a minute.  Nose is a little elusive, but a lot there and it works well for me...suprisingly juicy, with cherries, and some leather, and some dark chocolate and espresso.  Great waves and layers of flavors on the tongue, especially as it warms.  The end is really great...ties everything together with a earthy and grassy hoppy kick...sticky and very substantial but also a lively mouthful. 
Also had the 2015 non-b/a, but I preferred the 2014. 919 charactersTaybeh, Mar 24, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Pours a dark brown, nearly black color with a large, thick, dark brown head. One of the darker heads I've ever seen. Good retention, with moderate lacing. 
Licorice, chocolate, and roasted malts.
Big, huge roasted chocolate notes that literally seem to melt on the tongue. Quite a terrific sensation. Licorice and dark fruits start to creep in as it warms. Cherry, prune, raisins. Definitely some bite from the alcohol. A chewy, viscous dark fruitiness coats the tongue following each sip. A good touch of bitterness on the back end. Very complex yet balanced.
Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. The definition of a sipper. A good amount of bite from the alcohol renders this difficult to chug. The chocolate flavors work well with the beer's thick, chewy mouthfeel. Creamy, and goes down smooth. In looking at some other reviews, they comment on alcohol not coming through, which I disagree with. I feel alcohol makes itself known here.
Another excellent brew by my favorite home state brewing company. If you are a RIS fan, this is an absolute must-have. 1,077 charactersmajorbase2, Mar 23, 2016

4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A Surly gem.  Reviewing the 2011 vintage.  Poured into a snifter.  Pours thick, viscous looking, light brown head is there, though not excessive.  Smells incredible... toffee, caramel, chocolate, some dark fruit notes.  Taste --  one of the best stouts I've ever had.  After also trying the 2015 vintage, it's plain to see how well this one ages.  Smooth toffee flavors, chocolate there too, and the dark fruit flavors shine and set this beer apart from other stouts (and from more recent vintages).  Mouthfeel was smooth, a little sticky, dessert-like.  Just a terrific overall stout, up there with the best of them. 617 charactersScooter1027, Mar 07, 2016

Sweet Bakers chocolate, dark chocolate, roasty, and surprisingly big fruity notes.
Fudge, sweet and bitter chocolates, vanilla, roasted malt, but a little heavy on the fruit.
Medium-heavy bodied, low carbonation, unfortunately thin.
Overall, while in appearance this pours thick and rich, it leans heavy on fruitiness rather than the roasty goodness I usually look for in a stout. Additionally, the mouthfeel is where this totally falls off, thinness does not match the appearance profile. Okay, but not world-class. 613 characterslarryarms847, Mar 04, 2016

A: Pours a moderately thick, pitch black body. Faint, light-brown head that sticks around. 
S: Big anise, licorice, cocoa powder. Some vanilla, cinnamon, cherry juice. Even a little bit of brownie batter and sweet chocolate. 
T: Huge chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, raisin, licorice. 
M: Rich, but not super thick. Great balance throughout, with a nice sweet finish that makes you wanna go right for another sip. 
O: My first Darkness was last year's, which was uniquely barrel-aged. Without having the base beer first, I had an unusual first impression (and it wasn't that good). Getting back to basics this year, I was lucky to secure a (regular) Darkness, and it's way better than last year's partially BA version. This one is rich, dynamic, and delicious. It has a huge drinkable quality to it. Reminds me a ton of Dark Lord with the slick sweetness it carries. With BA Imperial Stouts getting all the spotlight recently, it's refreshing to get such a tasty Imperial Stout that can stand on its own. 
Recommendation: Any beer that has it's own day is a must have. 1,206 charactersSparty1224, Feb 29, 2016

Both poured in surly tulip shaped snifters glasses purchased from the brewery. One taster did not know which was which. 2014 cellared in our basement cellar with temps that range between 50-65 degrees seasonally throughout the year. Poured at cellar temperature. 
Visual:
Both inky black in color. Thin lacy head on the 2014. The 2015 had better head retention - medium with fair amount of lacing. Both were a creamy tan color. 
Smell:
2014 lots of dark fruits, cherry, raisin, dark chocolate overlay. Toffee and caramel. 
2015 malty, coffee notes. Bourbon vanilla
Taste/mouthfeel:
2014 starts how it smells with the chocolate covered cherries. Develops in the mouth and more of a mocha. Booziness and coffee notes come out more as the beer warms. Lingering (long) mocha, chocolate finish. Big body and chewy mouthfeel. 
2015: caramel and vanilla hit the palate first. Roasted malts, a slightly bitter dark chocolate hit next. Body is more medium. Does not have the booziness feel like the 2014 (is that from cellaring? Will compare next year). Medium to long finish with the vanilla coffee notes. 
Overall:
2014 is a fantastic example of a big bold boozy Russian imperial stout. Hard to find any fault in it. 4.75/5. 
2015 is a good beer in its own right but next to the 2014 falls slightly short. Palate significantly different without the fruity flavors. Don't know how much added complexity is due to a year in the cellar, but for drinking now about 4.25/5
We have a 2015 bourbon barrel aged darkness too that we have not yet opened. Excited to see what notes the bourbon barrel adds to the beer. 1,649 charactersKbierle, Jan 01, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the brewery. Pours classic RIS: opaque black with a dark tan head. Smell is amazing, with a rich combo of chocolate and coffee, and tons of cherries and other ripe, dark fruit I can't quite place. Taste is complex progression of what's on the nose, and is just super delicious. Many layers of flavor. Fairly sweet, but with an offsetting bitterness that is nearly perfect for the style. A huge, rich beer that is masterfully constructed. One of the best RIS beers I've ever had. 488 charactersBeers-es, Dec 14, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52013 bottle from notes from yesterday's share.
This beer was probably the most gorgeous pour of our share, with a thick and pitch black pour that turned into a small to average sized head quickly. The head was a chocolatey brown in color with good retention and very good lacing. When I took a sniff of the beer, the hops were definitely still in there. Upfront, the hops very still mildly bitter and melded with the dark and burnt malts. The back half of the scent was mostly semi-sweet, fudgey chocolate. When the first sip hits the tongue, the same flavor arc that happened in the scent starts, with a mild hop bitterness that transitions into a sweet, chocolate flavor in the middle of the drink. On the back half of the drink, the primary flavor is a chocolate-hops combo platter with a touch of dark fruits. The mouthfeel of this one is thick and smooth with a certain amount of creaminess. The carbonation is very low and the alcohol is very well hidden.
Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. In this case, ~2 years in the bottle has turned it from a hoppy stout into a delicious mix of hoppy and chocolate flavors. 1,122 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 13, 2015

This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a black color with a dark tan head. The head took its time as it dissipated. Light lacing ran around the glass.
The smell had a smooth dark chocolate, vanilla, dark dried fruit, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate and molasses.
The taste was mainly sweet with an ample amount of the dark chocolate showing some roasty and bitter edges. The aftertaste was mainly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors of the aroma. Nice quick finish.
The mouthfeel was about heavy on the body as the ABV made a big effort in affording my tongue the price of admittance. No joke with this one. Malts lay down the gamut and produce a decent stickiness.
Overall, one of the heaviest feeling beers I've ever had. I wonder if this thins out with age, hopefully my trader will get me another. Extremely good. 852 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 23, 2015

Definitely worth the hype! Rich dark flavors of chocolate, coffee and raisins. Hits with a little crispness, goes down smooth and velvety, finishes with a lingering flavor of a 12% ABV beer! I can't wait to try the BA version!
The 2015 offering is 12% ABV 287 charactersUmdrunner, Nov 11, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured on-tap into tulip.
A: Pours a thick black with 1/2 inch dark mocha head with good retention and lacing.
S: Smooth dark chocolate, vanilla, dark dried fruit, sweet bourbon, and a hint of cream.
T: Dark chocolate milk, bourbon, dark cherry, vanilla, heavy cream, raisin and other dark dried fruit, molasses, and bitter coffee and chocolate finish.  The more I get into this, the more I appreciate the hop elements (citrus, bitter note, etc).
M: Velvety smooth, creamy, and sweet.  Bitter note becomes apparent in the mid-palate and stronger in the finish.  Moderately heavy body.  Drinks lighter than the hefty ABV would suggest.  Amazing balance of super heavy malt notes and yet the hops shine through (although still playing second fiddle).
D: Definitely an exceptional brew...well done Surly!  Outstanding for style and lives up to the hype (which isn't always easy to do...especially since I've been waiting a few years to try this one).  One of the best beers I've had with excellent complexity and drinkability. 1,023 charactersmwilbur, Nov 10, 2015

Comes in a silky black color, with a dirty-white head. Definitely lives up to its name. 
Taste is marvelous, and besides subtle tones of roasted coffee beans, it also includes plum, raisins and cranberries. Despite being an incredibly dark beer, it's surprisingly fruity - without ever becoming unbalanced. The feel is delightfully thick, while never being combative.
All-in-all, a most fantastic beer, and well worth its reputation. 489 charactersWer34truh, Nov 08, 2015

There was just a bit of a beige head that didn’t leave much lacing. The aroma was good. Complex and a lot going on. Molasses, dark fruit, chocolate, bready, a touch of alcohol. Some faint hops in there too. The taste was very good. Similar characteristics to the nose, with some raisins, licorice. Limited sweetness with some bitterness in the finish. Full mouthfeel. Very Nice! 459 charactersBoto, Nov 04, 2015

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a dark oily black with a fat two finger mocha head that fades to leave a creamy blanket and light lacing.
S - Aromas of hickory, licorice, roast malts, chocolate, vanilla, very light dark fruit.
T - Taste is similar to the to the nose, hickory, licorice, anise, roasty almost charred malts. Fair amount of sweetness, both in malt and in dark fruit juice. Raisins and prunes. The finish has just a little bit of hop bitterness on the finish, but still, once the licorice and char is gone all you're left with on the tongue is sweet dark fruits.
M - Mouthfeel is slick and a bit oily. Bit smooth and syrupy too. Alcohol is hidden very nicely though.
O - Overall, this beer was a rather standard RIS. I can see why when it first came out the beer was great, however, 8 years later there are loads of russian imperial stouts on the market. For the money, I'd go with nearly any readily available RIS.

4.22/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Based on a google search of the label artist, this must be a 2013 bottle.  Thanks to Dominique for including this in his predraft box. The only good thing to be associated with that league this whole year as far as I'm concerned...
Pours that beautiful obilisk-black that gets us all a titter in a good big stout. Finger or so of brown head settles relatively early into a thin film with disparate colonies of soapy bubbles. Surprisingly little lacing.
The nose fluctuates depending on how far from the glass I am. Sitting a ways back I get an undeniable hit of fresh hand made bread dough as it's rising. Yeasty dark grains. In passing past the glass there can be hints of dark fruit with sweet plums and prunes and boozy black cherries. But stick your nose intentionally into the abyss and you get blackstrap molasses and sin. 
Initially sweeter than I would have expected. And not a bittersweet, no, this is more fructose and juice. The finish carries this through to its logical conclusion of candy sweet peaks. Far from one note, though layers of chocolate and cold pressed coffee  give way to the aforementioned sweet peaks balanced by the coffee's bitter close.
Initially, the alcohol overwhelms a bit, but as the glass warms it mellows in to a nice complementary role. Fine carbonation steps aside and lets the smoothe if a bit... thin. Not thin thin, but medium where I was looking for thick and chewy as toffee... anyway, sweet and smoothe and incredible. This is my assessment. Too bad so sad this is the only bottle I've got. 
Thank you @domvan for sending it along!! 1,582 characterskemoarps, Nov 02, 2015
3.99/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4Look: opaque black with creamy tan head that retains well	
Smell: At first I thought is smelled kind of soapy, then I realized it smelled almost exactly like drying paint. This sounds unpleasant but the aroma was ok. The resemblance to drying paint was somewhat distracting	. 
Taste: What was most noticeable was the alcohol, which is on the same level as a wine. Powerful and spicy. There was some roastiness but it tended to be overpowered by the drying paint again. At some point I realized this was kind of a resinous hop aroma, but again the resemblance to drying paint was distracting	
Feel: Very full bodied, thick, syrupy mouthfeel with perfect fine carbonation. This might have been my favorite part of the beer.	
Overall: Well, I had high expectations for my first Darkness. Honestly it was OK until I realized it smelled exactly like drying paint, at which point it became a somewhat less pleasurable experience. Still, it is worth a try, and who knows, maybe my palate was messed up from something I ate. 1,017 charactersmaedhros09, Nov 01, 2015

A. Poured black and thicker than most. A nice amber, fine bubble head had excellent retention. This is a great looking beer. Spotty laces remain on the glass.
S. Typical RIS smell, dominated by char. Other notes of dark malts, roasted coffee, oats, hops, and a little heat.
T. The taste is much more balance than the nose. The char from the nose does not dominate at all. The malts and coffee blend very well with the hop bite. A little milky notes at the end. 
M. Very smooth, silky, high carbonation, FULL body.
O. One of the best non-barrel aged stouts being brewed - very well crafted. I enjoyed this during a share and this stood out. The taste was amazing and it was a very attractive beer. I certainly recommend this, and I would likely reach out to find another one. 801 charactersmacher0, Aug 18, 2015

Been wanting to try this for quite a while… Very nice stout, poured very thick and black with nice brown lacing.  Nice deep chocolate nose and a very nice chocolate and burnt toffee flavor.

F: Very creamy with medium carbonation and a full body. O: An excellent desert beer that improves and develops with age. 403 characterspat61, Aug 12, 2015

Pours a motor oil black color, with a dark brown, stable head, with lots of bubbles in it. Leaves back a viscous film after swirling, revealing the beers thickness. It is actually that viscous, that it leaves spots of lacing on the glass after taking a sip.
Offers sweet aromas of molasses, toffee and caramel on top. This gets balanced by coffeeish earth, charred coal, dried fruits and warming chocolate dipped alcohol. This gets hold together by even more charred malts and toasty bakers chocolate.
Offers the most silk mouthfeel. Incredibly smooth, soft on the palate, with a diverse, fuller body. Low carbonated, with rich roasty flavors to it. 
Tastes of dark, roasty malts, accompanied by sweet toffee and smooth chocolate. Turns then sweeter, due to caramel and molasses, with a good amount of roast shining through. Provides boozy, earthy coffee, wrapped up by sweet liquor pralines, resulting in a very sweet finish, driven by milk chocolate and smooth cream.
Has a very sweet but gently balanced appearance, preventing the beer from becoming cloyingly sweet. As for its depth, roasted coffee adds a lot of character to the beer, competing with smooth chocolate and sweet fudge. 1,206 charactersaleigator, Jun 05, 2015

First off, if there is any imperial stout out there that shows barrel aging is not not necessary to make a damn good beer this is it. This was medium bodied and the nose was pretty bourbon heavy. The beer had noticeable bourbon to it but did not match the amount I got on the nose. I have to say, this was incredibly smooth and had so much complexity that I could care less if it was barrel aged or not. One sip, I tasted bourbon, chocolate, and maple syrup, while another sip I tasted coconut and raisins. This beer does have a good amount of hype but for someone who is not one to seek out imperial stouts, I was impressed. 713 charactersblockdude, May 17, 2015

This was on draft and lacked the nice bourbon oak taste that I remember. Still, was pretty darn good. More of the chocolate and raisin flavor came through. And hell, at $6 a glass, that was one awesome deal. 320 characterskkleu357, May 11, 2015

A- pours motor oil thick jet black in color with a thick and creamy dark tan head that retains long after the pour, leaving some lacing behind 
S- tons of dark & tart cherry aroma up front that smells like the filling of a cherry pie.  Underneath the cherry notes are complex layers of chocolate malt that add aromas of dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, brown sugar pie crust, even a hint of cinnamon. Just a hint of oxidation 
T- the dark cherry flavors up front follow the nose and add a light tartness, complex flavors of dark chocolate malt, molasses, burnt brown sugar, coffee, fig, date & raisin.  More black cherry on the finish with lingers of dark fruit and molasses 
M- thick and heavy body with low carbonation leads to a thick and chewy mouthfeel that continues into a creamy velvety finish 
O- a supper that is loaded with dark fruit flavors and aromas, perfect mouthfeel makes it a pleasure to drink 958 charactersTreyliff, May 10, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: pours brown and leaves a small espresso colored head, in the glass it looks like glossy motor oil.
Aroma: Huge rush of chocolate, followed closely with roasted coffee, and tart cherry. 
When there is a head I can detect vanilla as well.
Taste: Instantly hit with that roasted coffee, that is quickly balanced by chocolate, then this beer turns and hits you with some tart cherry and chocolate only. The finish hits you with char first and then molds into an awesome blend of tart cherry, roasted coffee, chocolate, and a good amount of vanilla. All the flavors mold together wonderfully and every flavor complements other flavors. This is probably the best tasting non barrel aged imperial stouts I have had so far.
Mouthfeel: Medium-thick feel; a little sticky which actually works with this beer quite well, very smooth and drinkable. The flavor lingers a little but it is slightly muted leaving you craving for more.
Overall: This is an excellent imperial stout and Surly has executed it very well. This is definitely a new favorite for me and I need more! 1,075 charactersKnowYourCraft, Apr 13, 2015

Opaque black body with a resilient tan cap that leaves webbing all over the little glass. Aroma features roasted malt, coffee, raisin, unsweet chocolate, dried cherries, and a surprising bit of soy and citrus. Taste is roasty malt and dried fruit sweetness, coffee and cocoa bitterness. On the lower end of the full body spectrum, thick and creamy texture, soft but appropriate carbonation, warming boozy finish. 501 charactersSierraFlight, Mar 02, 2015

Pours a small but tight head, dissipates pretty quickly.  Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, a little coffee.  Big, rich taste, malty but not as roasty as many other RIP's.  Chocolate very prevalent, pretty sweet for the style.  Good body but maybe a little thinner feel than I expected.
This is a great beer and grab it if you have the chance.  Looking forward to the BA 2014 version. 425 charactersstortore, Jan 04, 2015

L: Poured like liquid silk. Pitch black, no light penetration. Mocha brown head dissipates and then reappears with each sip. The beer is very reflective - you can see yourself in it.
S: Raisins. Dark chocolate. Brown sugar. Dates. Fig. Smells like bourbon even though it's not barrel aged. Dark cherries.
T: As my friend who drank it with me put it, "Rich and sweet and right down the middle. There's no smoke and mirrors here."
F: Like liquid Robert Patrick. If you could drink the liquid T-1000 from Terminator 2, it would feel like this beer. Feels like wine without the dryness or tack. Glides over the tongue. Thin in the best way.
O: A real treat. It's not my favorite Russian Imperial, but it's really damn good - and a very unique experience to drink. I'll look to get a younger bottle and drink it without aging to compare. Highly recommended. 923 charactersMichaelNeelsen, Jan 04, 2015

A:  Pours pitch black with no light penetration at all.  Geneerous 3 finger dense mocha head that lasted forever and left 360 degree lacing.
S:  Roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, molasses, and vanilla.  Maybe a bit of tobacco and oak.
T:  Toasted bread, dark chocolate, caramel, and raisins.  Maple sryup sweetness.  Alcohol is apparent just at the end.
M:  Full bodied with a nice creamy texture.  Fairly highly carbonated for an imperial stout.  
O:  Truly wonderful stout.  Nice complexity of flavors and aromas.  Something I need to trade for again. 618 charactersrichj1970, Dec 22, 2014

Smell- Roasted malts, caramel molasses, coffee, milk chocolate, Raisens.
Taste- Unbelievably complex yet super smooth, roasted malts, toast, raisins, plums, milk chocolate, coffee, pink peppercorns. so much sweetness but balanced by the toasted grain taste of the malts and some fruity spiciness.
Feel- Full bodied but not quite oily. perfectly creamy.
Overall- one of the best stouts, if not the best, that i've tried. 555 charactersSteveB24, Dec 14, 2014

A- Another pitch black bodied beer, also pours viscous and also has a dark khaki colored head. Lacing is lining all sides of the snifter. 4.5
S- Heavy oak flavors, dark chocolate, caramel. Tobacco is strong. 4.5
T- The barrel qualities remain but are very mellow and don't take over the beer. Still get oak and tobacco, but they aren't overshadowing the smooth dark malts. 4.5
M- This is exceptionally smooth, viscous and drinkable. No heat and a thick, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  Slightly bitter on the finish. 4.5
Fantastic effing beer. Love that the bourbon and barrels don't run away with the beer. 616 charactersONovoMexicano, Nov 02, 2014

Many Russian Imperial Stouts, which I love, can be somewhat rough in taste: super roasty and with strong alcohol burn. But this is elegant with hints of coffee, dark fruit, and maple syrup. None of these jump up. The tastes are superbly integrated and I can't taste the alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. 
The hype surrounding this made me prepared to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised that this was even better than I'd heard. Pretty rare. 547 charactersQbdoo, Nov 02, 2014

A 4.75 - opaque and jet black with a tall, frothy light brown head that hangs around awhile leaving sticky lacing as it slowly dissipates
S 4.75 - huge roasty nose with plenty of dark chocolate, raisin, and fruity esters
T 5 - dark chocolate slathers the palate with cherry, raisin, coffee, roasted barley, oat, faint pine all melded together perfectly
M 5 - full bodied, sticky and sweet, velvety smooth and creamy, exceptionally balanced finish makes it incredibly easy to drink; it is boozy but not overly
O 4.75 - always has been a favorite beer of mine. Apparently they're now barrel aging it starting in 2014, but in my opinion it doesn't need to be. It's phenomenal the way it is. Maybe they should keep both options open. 840 charactersbarnzy78, Nov 01, 2014

Pitch black pour with a gorgeous two finger caramel-colored head with great retention and decent lacing.  The nose is dark and roasty with hints of cocoa, dark fruits, espresso, licorice, and a subtle vinous character.  The taste is earthy and vinous and pretty much mirrors the nose. Hints of cocoa, espresso, licorice, dark chocolate, black pepper, dark fruits, leather, tobacco, port wine, and smoke. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. Overall, definitely didn't live up to the hype.

5/5  rDev +13.1%A dark motor oil beast of a beer! wow! I really liked this beer. Poured a deep, dark, molasses black. Has a roasted, traditional stout aroma. The taste is just awesome. Dark fruit, molasses and coffee make this masterpiece a must seek, must find, must have beer. 2013 version acquired at Darkness Day, this beer lived up to the hype. I have had many good stouts and this one as of now is the best.

On a '13 bottle, the beer has a really wonderful complexity for a non-barrel aged stout. Chocolate, dark fruit, umami, woody and earthy hops. A good transitioning of flavor that makes it quite different from other imperial stouts because of its substantial, but restrained hopping.
Mouthfeel is medium plus.
(2012 vintage) 
The beer in the front has roasted malt, chocolate, and slight coffee flavors. The mouthfeel throughout is actually only medium plus, without being as full as other imperial stouts. The beer also begins with a heavy amount of sweetness. On the finish, there is a heavy hoppiness. It's a bittering that is still tannic, earthy, and drying. 826 charactersdar482, Aug 11, 2014

A - Appearance is dark as night with minimal light being able to penetrate. 1/4 inch khaki to tan foam head appeared. Solid lacing with this beer.
S - Dark fruits are extremely prevalent in this with, oak, cocoa, bourbon barrels, and floral aromas coming through as it warmed. 
T - Taste wasn't honestly as good as I was expecting there was slightly too much floral hoppiness and dark fruit for an RIS for my tastes. Although I drank this on a night of BCBCS, Prairie Bomb!, Abraxas, and 1 other massive stout. There is chocolate and coffee not he tongue mixing in with the hops but for some reason this beer just wasn't drinking up to the hype for me. 
M - Mouthfeel was smooth, thick, with a decent amount of carbonation. May have to re-visit
O - I thought it was an amazing stout don't get me wrong, but for me the flavor was not what I was expecting and will have to give this one another go in the future.
2013 bottle - Re-review
Taste and flavors were all much the same. I have dipped further into craft since the first time I had this.
The dark fruits, raisins, figs, and plums really cut through and blend well with the chocolate notes that come through on this beer
Quite the treat once you appreciate this beer for what it is. 1,324 charactersdrmcleod10, Aug 08, 2014

A- Poured from a 750 ml bottle. Near black with a soft dark caramel head. Some light coming through. Decent legs
S- Aroma is quite intense. 2010 significantly stronger than 2013. Malty as hell, caramelized sugars, and generous amounts of dark cherries. A mix of other dark fruits and a hint of vinous notes.
T- Bold. Dark fruits again, maybe even some raspberries. Lots of sweetness of an RIS. Lots of malty goodness. Not getting the hop character the label speaks of, but very solid none the less.
M- Thick, chewy, and coating. Sweet without cloying. Alcohol present, but welcoming.
O- Terrific. The side by side proves age does this beer well. No signs of oxidation. Flavors only get taken up a notch. 800 charactersBosoxfan20, Jul 13, 2014

While waiting in line to purchase my allottment of DL, a kind DLD go'er shared some Darkness. From what I remember, strong roasted, chocolate malts power through the nose and the taste had more body than most RIS' I've had prior. Delicious and I will try to seek out again for better review. 345 charactersHesscabob, Jun 20, 2014

A: Black as night, this beer shows no light through when held to the full moon. A thick finger of tan, mocha head made of tight nit bubbles that sustains for a full moon cycle. When the bubbles do fall a residual lacing is left on the full finger of the snifter glass looking like a spider web with only a dusting on top of the darkness.
S: Sweet caramel and toffee overpower the senses on first sniff. As it opens up the chocolate notes come through with cocoa, milk chocolate and hints of tobacco and vanilla. No hop aroma detected, but there is a subtle fruity easter quality that may be coming from the yeast or some kind of candy sugar.
T: Big malty sweetness hits first followed by a charred, roasty and cocoa punch. Big caramel sweetness with raisins and prunes and toffee. The chocolate balances well with the caramel flavor, milk chocolate, bakers chocolate and dark chocolate flavored. A hint of smoke and tar like flavor that comes through adding to the complexity. The balance is on the malt side with a medium hop bitterness that sneaks through in the finish, earthy with pine. Vanilla is there but low and must be the result of the malt complexity.
M: Big thick creamy body that slides slowly down the esophagus trying to hold on. Carbonation is low and there is a slight astringency but nothing that keeps the drinkability from being affected. Alcohol warming is apparent and hits in the chest.
O: Bold and full of complexity, this huge RIS lives up to the reputation. The sweetness isn't nearly as intense as Dark Lord and the hop character comes through slightly (even after a year in cold storage). 1,645 charactersguityler83, Jun 09, 2014

A - Deep black with a sturdy head. Clings nicely to the glass. The inside of the cap was oddly bubbled and spotted. Not sure why.
S - Dark chocolate, molasses and brown sugar. Inviting.
T - Moderately sweet with a dark chocolate lead followed closely by brown sugar and raisins. No significant bitterness or roastiness. Smooth and balanced.
M - Creamy and smooth with a low, well behaved carbonation.
O - A little sweet for me but tasty and worth a try. 491 charactersGJ40, May 26, 2014

Moderate caramel head dissipated to thin layer of bubbles. The beer is very thick and viscous. The nose has complex scents of molasses, chocolate, roasted malts, licorice, and lingering vanilla. The taste follows the nose very well with pronounced dark chocolate, malt, and vanilla flavors accented by oak. Slight coffee bitterness, and even some hop flavors come through toward the end.

Taste is just as complex. Sweet with the whole list of types. Toffee, molasses, a little vanilla. A bit of coffee and chocolate as well. 
Mouth feel is rich and coating. Smooth and sweet. 
Overall an excellent stout. Just a hint of alcohol taste which is good. Smooth and complex. 507 charactersdexterk1, May 10, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This is simply an incredible Imperial Stout. In my opinion, when stored correctly, these continue to improve with age and grow in depth. 
Appearance: This is motor oil black, when swirled in my tulip glass leaves a very appetizing orange residue that slowly runs flows down the glass; very little head from the bottle, more from a tap. 
Smell: This is a mixed bouquet of chocolate, coffee, licorice; just a very rich aroma. 
Taste: I must say this is one of the smoothest Imperial's I've tried. There is zero bite, initial favors are chocolates, but the flavor keeps going, after taste turns to coffee/licorice. Very interesting. 
Mouthfeel: This is a thick chewy imperial, again feels smooth and viscous. 
Overall: This is definitely an extremely well crafted beer. I would highly recommend this to any beer connoisseur. 826 charactersCarb-Overlord, Apr 26, 2014

Pours a dark, abyss depths-like black. 2 inch head mocha head, good lacing in the glass.
Smells like dark roasted malt, some dark fruits, chocolate, and espresso.
The taste is similar. One of the biggest expressions of dark fruits- raisins, plums, dark tart cherries- I've had in a sout. The roasted malt and chocolate keep the dark fruit flavor from being too cloying. Some espresso bean flavors as well.
Thick, syrupy mouthfeel, sweet start, bitter finish. No alcohol presence, despite the imperial ABV.
Amazing stuff, really glad I finally got to try it. 634 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 16, 2014

Pours black as pitch with a huge two finger medium tan head. Excellent retention and plenty of lacing. Tons of dark fruit notes, dark chocolate, and boozy alcohol on the nose. Opens with dark chocolate, bold black cherries, and plum and prune notes. Molasses and raisins midpalate. Finishes with some dark roast coffee, boozy alcohol, piney hops, resin, and continued mixed dark fruit notes. Smooth and silky huge, full body with somewhat syrupy on the finish. Low to low/moderate carbonation. I've found every vintage of Darkness to be excellent and the 2013 vintage is no different. One of the better brews to be found in the style. 753 characterschanokokoro, Apr 14, 2014

Poured from a wax-topped bomber into a snifter, the beer is jet black, almost oily, with a thin, filmy, frothy half-inch head that settles into a filmy surface coating. Nose of black strap molasses, licorice, coffee, baker's chocolate, woody notes, and hints of vanilla. Flavors of rich, heavy molasses and smooth dark chocolate forward. Perfectly balanced. Oaky highlights, with vanilla notes, too. Roasted characteristics throughout, with coffee bitterness in and out of the palate, also. Very layered palate and deep throughout. Velvety smooth body, with a chocolate bitter and roasted aftertaste. Wow! The finish is slick, smooth, and fairly heavy on the linger of rich and heavy. Great beer!

4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Super-rich, heavy, thick, viscous, oily-looking; this is looking like one big beer. It's as black as darkness itself. The beer raises up a heavy medium-brown head that looks like it may be almost as thick as the liquid. It takes lots of time to recede and ends up a chunky patch resting on top and, while not clinging to the sides, is still maintained at half a finger for the entirety. Patching is almost beastly.
Every bit as robust and rich as I'd hoped it would be, this beer just pours out so much deliciousness it's scary. Working off a deep roast with just the right note of char to it, coffee grounds and chocolate come through. It's not enough just to say chocolate, though; there's every note in here from cocoa powder to nibs to baker's chocolate to creamy milk chocolate. Not to go too far, it's accompanied by some very ripe sweet/tart currant notes as well as contributions worthy of the especially rich, near-perfect Doppelbocks in thick molasses and almost anise-like notes, just for added depth. This is truly one of the best aromas one could smell from an RIS.
The taste follows suit; again, it's all about richness, depth and complexity. Robust malts contribute their drying char along with coffee grounds and the chocolate, which holds almost all the same complexity as in the nose with the exception that the milk chocolate and sweeter notes come out more strongly. Molasses and anise make their appearances as char kicks into the finish, some leafy hops as well as a boozy note running alongside.
Rich, thick, full-bodied with an appropriate heaviness, this beer hits the mark. It has just enough alcoholic heat to warm without thinning with a viscosity coating the tongue. The finish is semi-dry, some leafy hops and ultra-smooth chocolate easing the finish to linger beautifully. 1,803 charactersBrenden, Mar 26, 2014

So much happening on the nose - lots of dark chocolate, vanilla and stone fruit with hints of roasted malt and smoke. Outstanding aroma!  Palate follows the nose, dark chocolate, vanilla, cherries, and dark fruity notes. The malt and smoky notes are even more apparent on the tongue. Body is ridiculously smooth with a medium body and light carbonation. Overall, if there are any faults in this stout I can't discern them. This is not only the best non-BA stout I've had, it's the finest example of a Russian Imperial Stout I've had, period! 599 charactersJohnG190, Mar 17, 2014

I just can't do these beers anymore. It is just a big diabetes bomb of sugar and alcohol. Seriously lacking in complexity and character to round out the malt and add balance. 451 charactersdgilks, Feb 24, 2014

A few months later I had the opportunity to try 2010 and 2011 Darkness at a Rare Beer Fest. For me, the two year old 2011 was the best beer I have had to date at a rating of 4.9 and the 2010 might have just been slightly over the hill at 4.6. 399 charactersJosh012012, Feb 24, 2014

Aromas is really nice. Booze soaked raisins and chocolate malt are forward. More dark fruit of prunes and fig aromas come in near the mid section. Semi sweet malty finish.
Taste is great and follows the nose. Lots of booze soaked dark fruit flavors of loads of dates some figs and some raisins. Semi sweet at the start and midsection but is cut with a rich roasted chocolate flavor that helps balance the sweetness if the malt.
Mouthfeel is great. Super thick, sweet stickiness and light carbonation. Everything I want in a good imperial stout. 673 charactersFcolle2, Feb 24, 2014

A- This is the darkest beer that I have ever had. Coffee colored pinky sized head with good retention down to a large sized lacing ring with big legs.

A- Pours black, as expected. A nice finger's worth of khaki colored head sticks around awhile before slowly fading to the side. Some lacing is noted along the sides of the glass as well. 
S- Chocolate and dark malts are heavy on the aroma, along with an overall sweet character. 
T- Very nice RIS. Starts off with dark malts before giving way to tons of sweet chocolate notes. There is still some hop presence at the backend even after going on 3 years old, though the malts dominate this one I'd say. 
M- Thick and chewy, easy drinking for a RIS, good carbonation. 
This is a great beer for sure. I tend to prefer BA stouts but this is a great sipping one as well. Drinks heavy and thick. 762 charactersvic21234, Feb 05, 2014

The beer doesn't pour as dark as I expected; for something called "Darkness," I figured this would be pitch black, but it's more like a very deep brown. There's a decent amount of carbonation, so you get more head than some other comparable stouts.
The smell is pretty great; complex with berry hints, definitely different than what I'm used to. 
Now to the taste: Awesome! Also not at all what I was expecting. There's a lot going on here, with the berry nose also being present in the taste. There's no coffee that I can taste here, but there's a hint of hops; not as much as something like Goose Island's Nightstalker, but enough to make it interesting. Very sweet, reminds me a little of the BCBS Backyard Rye from this year.
Consider me impressed. There's enough flavor here that I'd have bet you this one was barrel-aged. Smooth, and extremely tasty. Probably the best non-BA stout I've ever had. I'm surprised to say this, but this one really lives up to the hype. 
Awesome job from Surly; I hope this one isn't too hard to get next year.
Edit: 2013 rating was 4.8 (4.25 look, 4.75 smell, 5 taste, 4.5 feel, 4.75 overall), numbers have been changed above to reflect my latest experience with the beer (2015), and my "expanded" palate, and the fact that Darkness is easily my favorite non-BA stout. 1,515 charactersSeanBond, Jan 27, 2014

A - Dark, like black with a beautiful 2.5 finger caramel colored head. Nice retention with a thick collar and good amounts of tan lacing. 
S - Earthy hops with pleasant dark fruits, lots of milk and bitter chocolate, roasty malts and some molasses and brown sugars to sweeten it.
T - This is one delicious RIS with hefty amounts of bitter and milk chocolate, earthy hops, caramel, brown sugar, molasses. The roasted malts are a real treat and there is a pleasant dark fruit flavor that blends well with it all. 
M - Thick, viscous and creamy with a velvety smoothness to it. The carbonation is spot on for the style. 
O - I can't think of a better RIS that I have had. This is an incredible beer, but the price may keep me from obtaining more than one a year. 812 charactersRi0, Jan 26, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75750ml bottle, 2013 vintage, purchased at Binny's Grand in Chicago (much to my surprise) and poured into a 2012 Darkness tulip. I've heard rumors that the batch sent to Chicago was different than the batch released at Darkness Day in 2013, but I have nothing to substantiate this, that being said, this bottle was quite different than the draft offering I had at Northdown Cafe not a few weeks earlier.
The beer pours a super deep jet black color, wonderful opacity and just a touch of cola brown color when hit by the light. A thick, taut, caramel colored head rises from the beer, not instantaneously, taking its time to thicken and settle before receding slowly and gracefully leaves a few nice spots of lace behind. The aroma is roasty, dark brunt grain with some toasted coffee bean before a rush of chocolate, also a touch charred gives way to a plethora of fruit flavors, cherry, plum, prune and fig, with a bit of brown sugar and raisin as well as some molasses and toffee. The flavors however, are on point, loads of rich chocolate, bittersweet that brings out the fruit flavors impeccably well, huge amounts of cherry and plum with some backing raisin and licorice that leads to a rich malt and brown sugar sweet finish, but boy does the roast get cut down on the tongue. I'm used to this beer exerting some bitterness and hoppyness, especially when this fresh, but this bottle is so rounded and smooth. The body on this bottle is perfection, incredibly rich, soft, smooth, velvety, all of the synonyms for those words apply. It coats the mouth so gently and eloquently that it's almost unnoticed while asserting itself so well. The finish is wonderfully creamy, soft and has a perfect level of warming as it goes down.
Verdict: I always thought of Darkness as a rather unique and inventive take on the style as it was assertively bitter and always had a distinctive piney hop flavor to me, however this bottle changes everything. It's incredibly rich, smooth and balanced. The complexity is astounding and this is deserving of all accolades. Perhaps there is some truth to the notion that the recent distribution was slightly different than the release day batch, but whatever was in my bottle was superb and I want more. 2,233 characterskevanb, Jan 24, 2014

Did not have the menacing pour I anticipated - dark, brown light showing through. Sits black in the glass with a dark mocha head. Sticks to the glass but not overly retentive, minimal alcohol legs.
Aroma of heavy roast, dark chocolate, some vanilla coffee. Some dark fruits as well, but not very distinctive. Nice, but not very vibrant.
Taste is huge. Big chocolate, heavy roast, some vanilla and dark cherry - slight molasses. Decently bitter but cut with a nice sweetness. Full, smooth well rounded body.
Very good RIS - not the best I have had, but certainly something worth getting a few bottles of. 612 characterstimc100, Jan 23, 2014

Appearance: Pours out a deep, dark brown that appears black in the glass. About 3/4" of dark tan head forms, which has pretty good retention and very nice lacing. Pretty good start to this beer.
Smell: Smells pretty roasty, but not overly so, with light coffee bitterness and stronger dark and milk chocolate sweetness intermingling.
Taste: Roast bitterness and milk chocolate sweetness all the way. Good balance of the two. Lingering bitterness from the roast. Not the most complex beer, but what is there is very solid. 
Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is just under full, with an excellent level of carbonation. Overall, a very good non barrel aged stout. It gives up a bit of complexity but is very well put together, and has an excellent sweet/bitter balance. Definitely a recommend. 803 characterszhanson88, Jan 15, 2014

Thanks to Bru for the Christmas present.
Appearance: lives up to it's name. Nice pillowy caramel head fades quickly to a surrounded light film.
Smell: Oh boy! Chocolate, coffee, sweetness.
Taste: The complexity! Rather fantastic, hence the perfect rating. The dried tart cherries and raisins are there and blend with that coffee, chocolatey (don't you red-underline me!) treat that we anticipated (see smell).
Mouthfeel: As you would expect from an RIS. Moderate carbonation. Dangerously smooth finish.
Overall: A wonderful treat. Wish this wasn't such a rare gem. Not my favorite style, but enjoyed this beer with the best of them. 667 characterstconboy, Jan 11, 2014

Appearance - Dark brown colour with a small size frothy light brown head. I can't make out the amount of carbonation showing and there is some great lacing. The head lasted for around 5 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oats
Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and vanilla. There is also some coffee, roasted/toasted nuts, and some oats.
Overall - Really smooth and enjoyable to drink. A great balance of flavours and something that I would drink a lot if it was regularly available to me. 634 charactersspinrsx, Jan 02, 2014

A-A gentle pour produces about a finger of medium brown foam. The retention is so-so and in less than a minute I am left with a patchy cap. The cap hangs around for a bit before dissipating to a collar. The beer underneath is pretty nearly black and opaque with a little bit of sheen.
S-The aroma is sweet and complex with suggestions of molasses and a warming background of alcohol. I detect some dark fruit, a touch of licorice-like spice, and nice roasted flavors. There is dark, semi-sweet chocolate, as well. The heavy-roasted bitterness is well integrated into the sweetness and the result is inviting.
T-Ultra-rich and creamy with a taste that includes many of the same flavors I smelled. Dark berry fruit, lightly bitter semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, and a little kick of spice. The alcohol is rolled in really well and gives a bit of fruity sweetness and warmth. Complexity is off the charts. Each sip reveals a new flavor.
M-The body is moderate to full and the carbonation is average for the style.
O-This is a great beer. What I especially enjoyed is how the roasted flavors managed to meld and balance the sweetness and fruit flavors. Unlike many RISs, this brew is not a complete char bomb or a soy sauce bomb, but a great balance between the two styles. The flavors are intense and complex. Perhaps the best non-barrel stout I've ever had. 1,411 charactersspoony, Jan 01, 2014

A - 2 fingers of medium tan foam over a body of pitch black; not much lacing, but beautiful nonetheless

Release: 2013-Brewcifer
Appearance: Black as a starless night with a finger thick chocolate milk foam. The head seemed to melt down leaving a film of foam surrounded by a solid ring around the glass. 
Smell: Heavy on the raisin and (for me) fresh dates followed by milk chocolate and strong coffee. The alcohol makes it's presence known as well.
Taste: Roasted malts are up front with the dark fruits following close while the chocolate and coffee bring up the rear. A very flavorful RIS which I would definitely put in my top 3. While I could smell the alcohol in the aroma, its hidden well on the palate.
Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth with a sticky finish. Roasted bitterness is there in the right quantity.
Overall: A delicious surprise in my last trade with Pintofbrown. Pretty damn amazing RIS which I feel the hype is deserved. Cheers! 865 charactersdarthvohn, Dec 26, 2013

2013 stole the show, hands down. The grade is reflective of that one. 
Great color and head on both beers.
Aroma on the 2013 was much more powerful in terms of coffee, chocolate and hops. 2012 was sweeter smelling with a lot of dark fruit. 
Flavor was much of the same differentiating factors. 2013 was balanced, hoppy, smooth and delicious. 2012 had a weird metallic 'twang' to it with every sip, and was just way too fruity and sweet with no hops or coffee/chocolate to add a little bitterness. 
Overall, I was very disappointed with the results. While I am now glad I traded away my older bottles, I was expecting something a little more 'badass' in terms of a vintage showdown. Oh well, maybe my bottle just didn't age properly. Either way, the fresh bottle was outstanding and on par with my favorite RIS...Stone RIS. 869 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Dec 12, 2013

I don't know. its rather straightforward as they go, excellent no doubt, but it reminds me of a great many other stouts like this out there on the market. rich creamy dark brown pour, sudsy mocha head, dense but not thick, attractive. the nose is muted dark roasted barley and unsweetened bakers chocolate. no alcohol at all, extremely impressive. the flavor, and I love this feature in this style, is all about the grain. I taste a few layers of varying roasted barley and chocolate malt, but no coffee, no vanilla, no bourbon barrel, no oak, none of that stuff. I do taste some dried cherry type notes in the finish, and as it warms even more fruit comes out, but this is a no frills example of the style, and I appreciate it for that. perhaps most impressive is that its massive alcoholic content is entirely absent from the smell and taste, its just not there. a real creeper, something to look out for when drinking darkness. I loved it with chocolate cookies, and could imagine a million other food pairings for it. expert quality stuff, but not different enough from some of the others for me to rate it off the charts. great beer though, they all are from surly.
edit: some age makes this epic, just cracked a 2011, and was amazed how much more mature and integrated and evolved the beer was from the fresh version, it really is one of the best in the game, with a chocolate and raisin complex coming to the fore. improving a few scores to reflect that. 1,666 charactersStonedTrippin, Dec 09, 2013

A- This stout is black as night with half a finger of head. Tan mocha-ish colored head with small, tight bubbles dissipating slowly. Alcohol legs present.
S- Dark chocolate, mocha espresso, hints of vanilla, dark fruits. A very nice smelling beer.
T- Chocolatey up front, getting a lot of coffee in there as well. A slight roastiness and coconut flavor on the palate. Do not taste the alcohol on this one.
M- Very smooth and silky. Creamy on the palate. Chocolate soaked raisins coat the mouth pretty well.
O- Surly comes through once again with a fantastic stout that lives up to the hype. 615 charactersHammdesigns, Dec 07, 2013

Poured into an unlabeled snifter to begin the tasting. Also just recently had a 10oz pour in a Darkness glass at the Surly Tap Room yesterday, 11/29/2013.
Pours a very dark black body, thick and viscous with an impressive 3-4cm mocha head that retains quite well for any imperial stout. Eventually it recedes into a thick-ish brown film on top of the beer. Not much lacing to speak of.
Now this was a pretty hoppy beer with good dark fruits, lots of milk chocolate, roasty malts and some molasses-like sweetness in the nose. Smells excellent.
The taste is awesome. One of the best Imperial Stout flavour profiles I've had. Tons and tons of roast malt sweetness and flavours- chocolate, black coffee, chocolate-covered raspberries. There's a nice earthy presence too.
Mouthfeel is great. Thick bodied, creamy and smooth, well carbonated and resinous. So easy to drink, so flavourful on the back-end. Not a lot of booziness here either. 
Going to call this one one of the better RIS's out there. Definitely beats Dark Lord in terms of one-day brewery-only release event beers. 1,163 charactersStevedore, Dec 01, 2013

Smells chocolatey with roast and coffee beans, some dark fruit, and cherries.
Taste is akin to the smell but much more full. Dark fruits and cherries are quite prominent and complement the strong chocolate taste. Coffee and roasted malts present as well. Bitter with a good hop bite, but the hops don't take over at all. Sweet but not cloying. Perfectly balanced. Alcohol is almost undetectable.
Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and silky. Medium-to-full body. Dry sticky finish. Extremely drinkable.
This is incredibly tasty and overall is very drinkable. Dark fruits and cherried are very present and it is overall sweet, but is balanced well. This isn't the roastiest stout, but it is one of my all time favorites. 887 charactersMCain04, Nov 29, 2013

The appearance was black but not as thick as I thought it would of been. It also had a off white head about 1/4 inch.
It smelled smokey with a hint of Chocolate and it had an alcohol smell as well.
It has kind of a bitter smokey taste, not as sweet as the 2012 that I had in the past. It coated my mouth and it was very good to drink.
Over all It was a great beer, I can not wait to try this 2013 with a couple years on it, hopefully it will get a little sweeter. 501 characterscwehr13, Nov 27, 2013

A - The body appears thinner than I expected; the glass is not "stained" as I move the zombie molasses around the glass. Opaque black with a small, warm tan head that lasts.
S - Hmmm... rum raisin, some slight char/smoke, bakers' chocolate, and coffee... All of the somewhat usual suspects, but it seems a bit fruitier for an RIS, which I like.
T - First off, this reminds me of Black Albert a lot due to the dark fruitiness I am picking up. The taste follows the noise quite well, but the char flavor lingers on the tounge for a bit longer. Not overly sweet, and the alcohol is well hidden, but then again, this is not even hitting 11%... I'm used to having 14-15% stouts lately, so this is a nice change of pace.
M - Not overly heavy or syrupy, which is quite pleasant. Too many sought after stouts get overly thick and syrupy. Don't get me wrong, I generally like that in my stouts, but in moderation.
O - A great stout, and I'm glad I was able to trade for it. Thank you to whoever traded this to me back in the last part of 2011.
***I had CBS on Canada Day '13, and now I've had Darkness as my 666th beer... I am a beer nerd. 1,174 charactersZombiesAteMyDog, Nov 24, 2013

Shared with friends before Black Crowes concert.  I don't rate many beers but this one deserves praise.  Appearance is dark and chewy, difficult to say from Styrofoam cup.  Smells awesome, chocolate, raisins, hot spicy rum.  This tastes great and the best RIS I have ever had.  Can't wait to try the second bottle after it ages. 441 charactersBrianStu22, Nov 23, 2013

A-Pours thick and black. The body even looks dark falling out of the bottle in a well-lit room. A stocky, tan head rises from the DARKNESS! Slithering lacing stains the glassware. 
S-I can now see why this beer is such a legend, I'm not necessarily saying that I am absolutely smitten by it but it's definitely very unique and admittedly quite intoxicating. It's unlike many big Stouts I have sniffed. The label states there are cherry notes and I am detecting them for sure. There is also a relevant hoppiness. The standard chocolate, espresso, roast and the like pop up too but it's the unique qualities that make this one so neat.
T-The flavor is even better. I recently had Kate The Great (may she rest in peace) by Portsmouth and while the beers have their blatant differences, there are some general similarities; this is probably why both are so highly regarded. Darkness has a whimsical, dark fruit fruity/cherry note that dances and weaves between the other flavors. The hops don't really give you much descriptive flavor but they add a bitterness that is more complex than general roast bitterness. Standing pat twitch the unique flavors is a great Russian Imperial Stout. Some char, chocolate, coffee and the like.
M-Not elite in the feel. Could stand a bit more thickness of body. It does have a nice creamy aspect to it. A little hot but I'm not surprised, nor do I frown up heat from a big beer. Tingly bubbles.
O/D-I was really happy to try Darkness, any geek should be. I found myself having a distant respect for the beer rather than a full fledged lust for it. It's well crafted, unique and yummy but it didn't click with me like others have. I still really enjoyed this brew and would love to try an older vintage. 1,751 charactersVelvetExtract, Nov 21, 2013

S- The aroma is so deep and complex. A touch of sweetness with some chocolate to it, but it quickly goes into coffee grounds, smoke, and licorice.
T- Really,really good. Sweet up front. Milk chocolate is quickly overtaken by coffee, smoke, and licorice. Really complex. Sweet undertones, provide a base for complex flavors.
M- Full body, actually fairly silky clean consistency to it. Low carbonation, just enough to keep it going.
I know I am buying into the hype, but this is a really, really good beer. Definitely a must try. 603 charactersjsprain1, Nov 19, 2013

We were able to find ours in a hole-in-the-wall liquor store in St. Paul. Only sold one per customer. Feeling lucky that we could enjoy this delicious beer--if you're lucky enough to find it, you should definitely pick it up!

Appearance: Pitch black body sits below tan foam.
Aroma: Alcohol warmth, toffee, dark malt.
Taste: Starts with light grassy bitterness mixed with sweet dark malt and currants. The bitterness never gets intense and the malt really shines here. There's actually nothing harsh about the flavor which is odd coming from Surly but genius in that it makes for an unbelievably smooth flavor. Effortless finish and hint of caramel liqueur on the back end. Aftertaste of dark malt and hops. I was expecting a lot of chocolate and coffee flavor but the real standout seems to be a deep caramel character alongside the roasted malt. Robust and yet subtly restrained flavor all around.
Mouthfeel: Full in body, nearing the point of syrup. Super smooth with good drinkability for the style.
Final Thoughts: Had all but given up trying to get a bottle of Darkness. Pricy at $25 a bomber but worth it for a once a year release. Great example of the style. Would I drink it again? Yes. 988 charactersJamesMN, Nov 02, 2013

Really can't imagine a better RIS. I don't even think barrel aging would do this any benefit. It's just perfect the way it is. Only thing I could maybe point out is the sweetness, but compared to Dark Lord this is easy drinking in that regard. Smooth. Chocolate, toffee, roasty, smooth smooth smooth. I aged mine until it was over a year old. The abv at 10% is hardly noticeable. Well done Surly! 450 charactersJonnyBeers, Nov 01, 2013

Liquid comes out midnight black, can't see through it anywhere on the glass and it doesn't even seem to get lighter. During the pour there's some lighter brown edges on the stream. Coffee with cream colored head that erupts up to the top of the glass. Mostly small bubbles but a few larger ones at the top that blub up. Head stays around a long time and there's TREMENDOUS lacing here, stuff clings to the glass for life. Great looking beer, sets the standard, looks like what many wish they did. 
Oh wow, does this smell great. Take the absolute best individual parts of an imperial chocolate stout, coffee stout, hoppy stout, a fruity stout and mesh them all into one absolutely perfectly and this would be your result. Could be the slightest bit stronger, but still would rate it a 4.9999 out of 5 based on how well balanced everything is. Everything works here, huge malt backbone with both dark and sweet fudgy chocolate, black roasted coffee, some earthy dark fruits, and some floral hops. Great balance, perfect smell.
Taste is even better than the aromas if that's at all possible. Starts off sweet with more milky than bitter chocolate, but both present, coffee also isn't as strong. Then there are some nice dark dehydrated fruit flavors like fig and plum, but not overbearing. Plenty of bitter hoppy flavors there of pine and sweet clementine citrus (kind of like a chocolate orange, but actually tastes good). Hops provide a nice fresh flavor too, I'm impressed with how well the hops lasted in this one. There's also an almost minty vanilla flavor at the end. Not the burning vanilla you get from barrel aged stouts though.
Mouthfeel is, you guessed it, perfect. Full bodied because the flavor lingers for awhile, but it tastes so good you wished it would last even longer. This beer is perfectly smooth, with a nice carbonation level and no bite from the alcohol or carbonation, slightly tickles the tongue though. Starts sweet with a nice clean, fresh bitter finish. Crazy drinkable, any stout lover or beer lover could finish off a bottle no problem. A sipper, but dangerous enough to drink faster than you might intend. Thanks N-Dawg for bringing this one to me! This beer really has all the perfect qualities one would want in a beer and blends them together. 2,364 charactersAndyAvalanche, Oct 26, 2013

A - the name says it all. It is dark. Black as night with two fingers worth of dark tan foam. Leaves lots of thick lacing.
S - one word sums it up. Chocolate. But it is not that simple. All kinds of chocolate. Chocolate sauce, cocoa powder. Milk and dark. Underneath the sea of chocolate are soft notes of city roast coffee and dried dark fruit.
T - silky sweet and bitter chocolate mix. Roasty coffee around the edges. Ripe juicy dried fruit in the center. Earthy hop on the backend. Chocolatey finish.
M - creamy and slick but with a slightly watery note. medium-full bodied. High carb.
O - a great russian imperial. Definitly something i would like to get my hands on again. 691 charactersTeleweizen2, Sep 04, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Darkness, I believe this is a 2013, been in a fridge most of the time since I received it. Served at that fridge's temp, 55F.
Pours black and viscous. Very good sized brown head. Leaves great lacing.
Aroma is sweet, light alcohol, lots of roast.
Flavor follows the aroma and is amazing.
Mouthfeel is full, with a lower carbonation level, perfect for the style of beer. Alcohol is barely present.
Overall this is one of my favorite imperial stouts, despite being a little too much on the sweet size. 503 characterszachary80, Aug 12, 2013

4.15/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Lined up against a few other world class stouts at Great Taste of the Midwest 2013, this was good but it wasn't as good as I hoped it would be nor was it on par with a few other heavy hitting stouts that I tried that day.
The taste was a typical imperial stout type of taste (fruit, malts, chocolate, roastiness) but the hops and roasted malts overpowered things for me a little bit. I could see this being very good with some age on it but the 2012 vintage with almost a year on it was a little too harsh for me.
EDIT-Just split a bottle of the 2013 with a friend. There was a nice sweetness to this beer and it was more flavorful than I remembered. I have noticed that my palette can chance from time to time and I am sure when I first had this beer at GTMW, I had sampled way too many beers that day to give it a fair score. 829 charactersmjpolzin, Aug 12, 2013

Pours black with a two finger billowy head. 
Smell is dominated by chocolate malts. Ashy and chocolate. 
Taste is sweet milk chocolate up front, roasty coffee and vanilla on the tail. 
A much lighter body than I was expecting, very smooth and not just a sipper. Very good. 339 charactersSmurf2055, Aug 08, 2013

A lives up to the name, black with a deep edge, massive three fingers of dark mocha foam stick around long enough to leave a a few well spaced thick rings, looks decent 
S shocking how well the hops stand out against all this dark malt, grapefruit, tangerine and a little pine, sweet chocolate fudge smells so rich, Hershey's syrup, molasses, and a little coffee but not much, just a hint of plum and the booze is well hidden 
T much like the nose but a little sweeter and the chocolates a little darker, coffees a little burnt and the hops are still strong, crazy strong, they must have used a shitload of the green stuff making this bad boy
M rich thick and creamy from the bubbles, a little sticky on the lips and I really have no idea where the booze is hiding 
O hopped to hell and rich fudge make a great combo, pretty much zero booze and my glass is already empty at this point 
Its always a great thing when a beer lives up to the hype and this one did exactly that. I wasn't expecting the high levels of hops but I loved it, for a fresh big stout the booze is nearly invisible. This one could age for years but great fresh if you like a hop bomb 1,267 characterswordemupg, Jun 13, 2013

A- Pours a dark brown that appears a jet black in the glass with a thin mocha brown head that has about average head and recedes to a flat top. Spotty lacing that slides back into glass.
S- Cocoa powder, light bakers chocolate, some faint hop, decent aroma strength.
T- Cocoa powder, light baker's dark chocolate, light hops hiding in background that I would assume is more pronounced in fresher bottles. Finishes with rich dark chocolate cocoa powder that lingers as a nice aftertaste.
M- Smooth, very drinkable, nice carbonation that doesn't dominate too much, medium bodied.
O- This was a great stout that I really enjoyed drinking however I'm not sure if I'd say its one of my favorites. The overall flavor could have been richer instead of the cocoa powder taste. I would love to compare a fresh version of this. 942 charactersjaasen64, May 25, 2013

Big hop aroma with plenty of roasty notes to go along with a bit of sweet molasses. Flavor is very much molasses with unexpextedly strong hop flavor. Wow the balance here is excellent. Cherry and fig mixed with bittersweet chocolate coming in. Medium mouthfeel with thickness that goes with the impy. Relatively easy drinking for the style.

A - motor oil black. Black the whole way through, even at the edges.. The thickness of the beer is obvious from its appearance. Small to medium amount of dense tan head. 
S - aggressive chocolate, milk and dark. Coffee. Maybe molasses, some anise/black licorice. Dense and roasty.
T - wow. powerful. It tastes like someone made a great stout and then distilled it down to an extract. Really really rich. Up front there is a bunch of sweet dark chocolate, black coffee, sweet molasses. Roasted malts. The ABV is completely imperceptible.
M - this really is the perfect mouthfeel for a stout. Pretty thick, but not overly so. Light carbonation, smooth. One of the best I've encountered in this category.
O - quite simply an outstanding stout. Just an unbelievable amount of flavor. If there is a demerit, its that its so intense it is almost fatiguing. I split the beer with a friend, and we agreed it would almost be difficult to finish a bomber on your own, just due to the fact that it almost overwhelms you with the flavor profile. This is a must try for any stout lover. Easily the best non-barrel aged stout I've ever had, and one of the best stouts I've ever had period.
Excellent beer. 1,209 charactersBeerandboards, Apr 23, 2013

4.13/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Originally reviewed a bottle of the 2010 only a few months after it had beer released. I found the beer excellent and scored it a 4.43. We compared that bottle to a 2009 vinatage and found that the hops had faded quickly and it had become much sweeter and less appealing. Thanks for those bottles rpstevens and oakbluff. I thought I'd re-review a newer vintage now that I've been around a little longer. 
From a 750ml bottle into a snifter
Vintage: 2012
Red Wax
Note: We drank a 2012 and a 2008 back to back. The scores are for the 2012 with comparisons to the 2008. 
APPEARANCE: A dark pour yields a 1+ finger, thicker looking tan head with good retention. Head slowly fades to a good cap and coats the sides of the glass. Black body with higher levels of carbonation evident. A splotchy wisp remains until the end and leaves some good lacing down the glass. A good looking beer for sure. The '08 looked exactly the same. 
SMELL: Roasted aromas and lots of pure, dark chocolate too. Quite hoppy for sure, with lots of citrus and floral notes as well. This is definitely a bold and hoppy stout on the nose. The '08 smelt a bit stale in comparison, so perhaps some oxidization is starting to play a roll. Caramel, leather and soy sauce show up as well. 
TASTE: Very nice stuff. Roasted and chocolate flavors with caramel and toffee sweetness at the swallow. Lots of bitterness at the fninsh, with plenty of hops as well. Citrus, floral notes and some bitter, dark chocolate linger on the palate, balancing the toffee and caramel sweetness. Bold and flavorful for sure. Good stuff. The '08 didn't have the oxidized staleness that I'd expected from the nose, but the hops had pretty much disappeared. Sweet caramel and toffee with leather and soy sauce. A touch of dark chocolate, but it's mostly sweet and soy flavors. 
PALATE: Full body and medium levels of carbonation. Very creamy and full with enough weight for sure, goes down smooth and finishes rather sticky. Full, heavy, and creamy. Great feel. Like chocolate milk. The '08 is much the same, though perhaps a touch lighter. Still, this is a full, heavy, dominating mouthfeel. 
OVERALL: Perhaps not as impressive as when I was just getting into craft beer, but this brew is definitely a top class example of the style. Fresh, Surly Darkness shows great balance between the sweet, syrupy malt base and the big hop profile. The 2012 was great. As it ages, however, the hops fade and the sweet toffee and soy sauce become too dominating for my palate. As such, the 2008 just wasn't all that enjoyable any more. In fact, we did a 2011-2008 vertical a couple years ago and only the relatively fresh 2011 was enjoyable while the others were simply too sweet. I would call this a top class stout, but wouldn't bother with it after the 6 month mark. Anyways, thanks to SliverX for the 2012, and to whomever sent that 2008 a couple years back.
EDIT: Had a chance to drink some of the 2007 and it to be less sweet and cloying than all the other vintages of this beer. The hops had faded, yes, but the sweet flavor was balanced by some alcohol qualities that made it much more palatable than the other vintages. Probably the best of vintage of this beer, but Darkness is still better as fresh as possible. 3,258 charactersJeffo, Apr 11, 2013

There is a nice retention with a good lacing as well. The smell of the beer is of dark berries with deep roasted malts chocolate and subtle vanilla and soy. The taste is the beer is really nice, bold roasted malts, some smoke and bit of dark chocolate, there is a touch of saltiness in there too. The mouthfeel is silky smooth with a creamy body and subtle carbonation. Overall it's excellent. I had been curious how it would compare to Dark Lord and this is much better in my opinion. 563 charactersKnapp85, Apr 11, 2013

This edition was strong on the nose and palate, I remember wincing on the first sip. Deep bitter cocoa and molasses with hints of vanilla and clove. It went down smooth and I was sad that my 2 oz pour was only. Rich coffee flavors with layers of toffee mirrored by sweet caramel and a tar-like drip...not perfect, but close enough. 489 charactersFLBeertender, Apr 06, 2013

A: 4.75 - black, no clarity (wouldn't it be ironic if there was any? ), soft vertical bubbles and substantial legs, one finger frothy tan head that resolves into subtle glass lacing;
S: 5 - chocolate, coffee, vanilla beans, some dark raisin/fruits in the background to boot
T: 5- minimal hop bitterness on the front of the tongue that quickly dissipates into rich and substantial dark chocolate and coffee flavors, vanilla bean and minor molasses sweetness on the back of the tongue
M: 5 - incredible smooth, silky mouthfeel, thickly coats the mouth and lingers for days; this is the epitome of mouthfeel for RIS 
O: 5 - I never though that I would try this beer considering that it is only released one day/year in Brooklyn Center, MN with very limited local distribution but thank goodness for the CBC 2013 in Washington D.C.; like all of Surly beers, this one lives up to the extreme hype and is overall the most complex RIS that I have ever tried; I have never tried Dark Lord or Marshal Zhukov but I cannot imagine it being better than this 1,171 charactersMNishCT77, Mar 29, 2013

A - 4.25 - Pours dark brown, opaque black in glass. Substantial tan head that endures. 
S - 4.5 - Wonderful malty, chocolatey, fruity nose. Like chocolate covered cherries. Also smells like some kind of candy bar element that is complementary to chocolate, whether sweet biscuit or caramel or something related, I can't place. There's a lot more going on here. It's not barrel aged but still there's a barrel liquor aroma going on. Reminds me of the nose of a scotch or a cognac just in terms of the complexity.
T - 4.0 - Powdery chocolate, mocha, cocoa, chocolate syrup. Sweet, mild, and particularly round in that respect. But alongside that round chocolate is something more pointy and bitter, which also leaves a dry finish and slightly raw tongue alongside the sweet and sticky chocolate aftertaste. Presumably it's hops given the tongue abrasion. Unexpected and interesting, that. Overall the taste is substantially less complex than the nose. The alcohol is more prevalent than in many of its ABV peers, but I'm a fan of more booze.
M - 4.0 - Creamy, yet not as thick as I've come to expect from RISs. I'd call it medium, maybe a bit north of there, though there is some stickiness in the end.
O - 4.25 - Good. The nose is fantastic and so I suppose there's just some disappointment when the body does not exactly follow suit. There's a round sweetness and a woody dry bitterness, which make an interesting pair, but it wants something more to elevate it, and a stiffer backbone to offset some of the sweetness. Still, it is somewhat unique. Probably not enough that I'd trade for it again, however. The hunt continues. 1,682 charactersBrownNut, Mar 25, 2013

*sigh* Another overhyped beer.
Looked like a stout should: dark brown-black pour, with a small tan head that sank to a ringlet and left some splashes of lace on the glass. Aroma was typical as far as stouts go, dark roasty malts, some cocoa bitterness, with notes of herbal hops and anise. Same story on the palate, dark malts, dark chocolate, herbal hops, light woody notes, and a touch of dark fruits and licorice; slightly lingering resiny bitterness in the aftertaste. Good, but not very full in flavor like a good stout should be. I'm not really understanding the hype over this beer...you get about the same effect as you would from a Storm King, and I can get that off the shelf any day of the week. Not full-bodied, but on the heavier side of medium. A decent stout, but pretty standard overall. 818 charactersRifugium, Mar 24, 2013

My good friend works at a liquor store in the Twin Cities, so naturally he had a 2012 "Werewolf" bottle aging in the basement for the entire winter. We spontaneously decided to crack it open after what had already been a long night of drinking beforehand, so I apologize if anything seems biased and I obviously didn't take any notes. I drank the beer. I loved the beer. The wax around the cap that looks like blood was pretty cool, but a bit of a pain to cut through. Onwards!
Poured into a 12oz mug at basement room temperature (~65-70F)
A: Flawless black opaque with below average amounts of lacing. This is not an especially carbonated beer. I definitely enjoyed it's appearance though, you will not be able to shine light through this one, and the head has that awesome darkened "chocolate" appearance which you see on other heavy stouts and especially cream sugar stouts like Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat, etc.
S: Dark, earthy, chocolate, mocha, toffee, lots of toffee at the end too. Not much hop aroma that I remember (note: remember)
T: The complete, utter lack of alcohol taste is the most notable thing about this beer. It is 10.30ABV and yet it DOES NOT taste or burn like booze whatsoever. Deep, chocolately coffee notes and a sickly sweet fruitiness (prunes? raisin? some kind of dark fruit) intermingle with caramel, vanilla, they packed almost every usable stout every flavor into this RIS and with success. My ONLY gripe, is that it is a little too sweet for me. I would prefer the creaminess to be upped a little bit and the sweetness toned down, as it's slightly too "fruity" and sweet. The beer IS hopped, despite what I'm about to say, but to me the finish has a tiny itty bitty microscopic bitter note at the beginning and end, but I'd say it's safe to say it's almost pretty much hop-free to my worn out taste buds.
M: It's a tiny bit thinner than you'd think it is, and not very carbonated. But the MASSIVE body makes up for it completely. The aftertaste is addictive, you will want another sip!
In short, the best RIS I've ever tried. Tastes better than most stouts at half the ABV I've tried! 2,168 charactersdptaylor, Mar 07, 2013

A-This beer pours black with brown-ish/rudy highlights when held up to the light. The foam is huge and has amazing retention and lacing for a beer like this. 
S-The aroma is huge with notes of mocha at first, yet VERY complex with toffee, chocolate, some earthy leather, some mild roastiness, woodsy, dark stone fruits, and man that sweet mocha really sticks out like no other RIS I've had. Truly an amazing aroma, (one of the most complex).
T-The flavor is just as impressive and complex with the mocha standing in the front lines. Fresh toffee follows along with prunes and sweet camamel. There is that earthiness woody-like note in the flavor as well as a mild earthy hop flavor note. Very impressive indeed. 
M-The beer has such a slick, creamy sweetness but the bitterness level is just perfect to keep it from being cloying. Huge body and a long sweet, mocha like finish. 
O- This beer that is called Darkness is most likely the best RIS I've ever had. I am once again so pleased to have had a chance to try this great beer. Thanks again Sarah-Jane 1,246 charactershoplover82, Mar 02, 2013

Pours a midnight black color, only the very edges show some dark brown hints; thick, dark, and opaque. The head is a deep tan color, comprised of very fine bubbles and appears to be creamy as hell. It hangs around for a while before it complete vanishes, and it's pretty hard to bring any of it back by just swirling the glass. No real lacing left behind.
Right out of the gate, the aroma is super sweet. Dark currants and fruits, black licorice, toasted brown sugar, and bits of bittersweet chocolate. Some small, extra hints of vanilla reside in the back as well. Not much coffee on the nose (though there is a little bit) - the sweet fruits, sugar, and chocolate kind of steal the show. Booze is apparent, but masked well enough from the barricade of other flavors. 
Many other people are calling out a big hop profile in the aroma, but I'm just not getting it. Some very faint char/ashiness that may be from the hop, but I'm grasping at straws, here. I'm just not picking up a big hop character on the nose (barely any at all, actually). This aroma reminds me quite a bit of Dark Lard, but lighter on the brown sugar and not quite as sweet.
A similar thing could be said about the taste. Darkness hits you with a sweetness first and foremost, just like Dark Lord did, but it's a little more tamed in this one. Sugary, burnt caramels, bittersweet cocoa, syrupy molasses, licorice - quite a lot going on here. There were actually a few sips that would remind me of the syrup used in fountain machines to make cola. Less dark fruit on the palate than in the aroma, but some currants and dates are there, sugar coated and sweet as hell. 
I'm finally picking up a touch of hops, but still nowhere near enough to combat the sheer malty sweet intensity of this beer. The coffee comes out a little over halfway through and ride well into the aftertaste, leaving a nice roasted coffee bean flavor in my mouth. The sweet brown sugar also hangs in the aftertaste, probably for a little too long. Thick, heavy mouth, though not incredibly creamy or chewy, with lower end carbonation. Lacquers the mouth with a sticky, syrupy coating.
This is a damn fine brew, and I enjoyed it a little bit more than Dark Lord. But unfortunately it suffers from the same flaw of still being a bit too sweet. Darkness does a little bit better of a job taming the sweetness than Dark Lord, however. Lots of different flavors and aromas going on here, and this is a nicely crafted RIS - but the relentless sweetness (in my opinion) is holding it back from being "top of the list" for me.
EDIT: 7/19/2013
2012 Vintage shared thanks to Kevin R... Thanks! I liked this one even a bit more than the 2011 that Mike cracked with me earlier this year. Sweetness was evident, yet more controlled. Hoppier, with a better balance of ashy bitterness. More roasty, more drinkable, and even more enjoyable, even though I already like it in the first place. Great brew. 2,993 characterstectactoe, Feb 20, 2013

A Very nice dark brown body that is topped off with a mocha head. 
S Lots of chocolate both dark and milk with some smoke. 
T Some more smoke with more chocolate and some slight hops and coffee. Very tasty. 
M Very thick and creamy. 
Overall this is an excellent RIS that I'm glad I got the opportunity to try. The 2011 was my favorite of the 3 with the 10 having a bit too much smoke and the 12 having more hops then what I prefer in a RIS. 544 charactersbeerandcycling88, Feb 11, 2013

2012 Werewolf bottle
Appearance: Dark, thick and heavy. Pours slower than normal and has a great chocolate head.
Smell: Malt, cherries, chocolate, and toffee. 
Taste: Pungent and robust. Immediate taste off coffee and bittersweet fruit. Very rich and tasted better slightly warmer near the end. Absolutely awesome.
Mouthfeel: Thick and heavy, goes down smooth and leaves a chocolate aftertaste.
Overall: Incredible, one of my favorites for a reason. You can obviously taste the alcohol content but it is covered up by flavors both intense and subtle. Definitely a sipper, and one to be sought after. 796 charactersMNmurray, Jan 28, 2013

Appearance: black as night with a big head that lasts a while
Smell: dark chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, dark fruits, cherries, and raisins.
Taste: rich full flavor of chocolate, coffee, molasses, cherries, licorice. Very complex.
Mouthfeel: smooth, creamy, heavy body. Amazing.
Overall: This beer is amazing fresh and I certainly have some in my cellar for aging, can't wait to see how these develop. If this got the barrel aged treatment it might just be the best in beer in the world. 545 charactersmnphish, Jan 27, 2013

A: Motor oil black with a lingering espresso head. Perfect stout appearance. 
S: Bitter chocolate, alcohol, and dark roasted malts. A slight hop presence as well. 
T: Sweet chocolate bombarded my palate and the roasted malts took over. Alcohol is there along with a very light coffee taste. 
M: Thick, creamy, and smooth. Booze heat as it goes down. 
O: A very good RIS, just isn't quite on par with some of the others that I've tried recently. I'd like to give a fresh one a try in the future. 568 charactersmfavoino, Jan 26, 2013

A: Pours a dark cola color with a small tan head.
S: First off comes a sweet citric hoppiness. The hop notes mix with dark chocolate and roasted grain. It's actually smelling quite sweet, which I wasn't expecting.
T: Light charred bread, sweet milk chocolate, a bit of sticky pine resin and grapefruit hoppiness, cocoa, sugary grain.
M: Thick-bodied, low carbonation.
O: An enjoyable beer, although it was a bit sweeter than I was expecting, and a bit sweeter than I would have liked. 526 charactersEtan, Jan 11, 2013

Glass: Oversized wine glass 
From: My cousin Sam 
Price: N/A 
Misc.: 2012 batch (Werewolf); Original art on bottle by Brent Schoonover; Beautiful bottle, but red wax (I think) on the bottle neck was tough to get off.
Poured a black color with 2-3 fingers of thick, frothy, khaki tan head. Healthy layer of the khaki tan lacing on the side all the way down. Good retention on the top, some parts heavy and bubbly, others a bit thinner.
Smelled a big whiff of alcohol first. Once the dust cleared, I got dark cherry, plum, dark red wine (sherry?), raisin, toffee, caramel and chocolate. Surprisingly just a back whiff of coffee or coffee beans. Not too strong. 
Tasted better and stronger than the smell. Also unlike the smell, the alcohol was hidden. I got toffee, dark cherry and chocolate, mostly, but so smooth. Also sherry (I think), blackberries, caramel and light coffee notes. Very, very good.
Medium body (surprisingly). Sticky-to-slick texture. Average-to-soft (below average) carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish.
A very, very good Russian Imperial Stout. Really hit the spot. Would love to try a few more of these bottles again. 1,168 charactersBucannonXC5, Jan 07, 2013

2011 Zombie bottle
Pours very black, dark as night with an eager finger of light brown head. Stringy and spotted lacing.
The nose has a ton of anise and bitter chocolate. If I take a huge whiff, the abv comes through slightly. Cocoa and licorice.
The flavors are heavy on bakers chocolate and anise. The is some sweetness involved but the dry roasty flavors take over. Roasty, dark, slightly sweet, and full of anise. Solid for the style but I had hoped for more.
The mouthfeel is sticky and rich, mixed with those dry bakers chocolate flavors. Sweet, roasty and dry. This is the best part of this beer.
Overall, I expected much more going into this because I have had many off the shelve beers that are just as good, if not better. Too much hype behind this one. Solid top tier stout but not near the best or even near it. 841 charactersChugginOil, Dec 28, 2012

The Bruery tulip
A: Pours pitch black. Finger light tan head. Big lacing. Some ABV feet.
S: Smells of sweet soy sauce. Dark dark chocolate. Cocoa puffs. Some alcohol.
T: Dark chocolate bitterness up front. Some of that cocoa puffs. Dark roast coffee. Some of that blueberry sweetness. Some alcohol burn. It's a really nice brew.
M: Full bodied. Not crazy vicous. 386 charactersinlimbo77, Dec 27, 2012

Appearance: Surly’s most exclusive beer pours a midnight black. No light gets through this beer at all. The head is a massive three fingers, and is a great-looking khaki color. As it descends, the head leaves swaths of lacing intricate lacing. Alcohol legs are present, but that is to be expected at 10.3% ABV. Really, it just looks like an especially dark Russian imperial stout, but the crazy lacing and head really push it over the top.
Aroma: Huge, roasty coffee aromas flow out of the glass from across the room. They are followed quickly by dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and a fantastic creaminess. Amidst all the organized chaos, a molasses sweetness runs under the entire aroma. The alcohol just barely comes in at the tail end. This beer smells crazy good and enormous.
Taste: Follows the nose, except with huge chocolate notes taking the forefront completely. The roasty coffee comes in as an aftertaste, but cannot quite fight off the dominating milk, dark, and baker’s chocolates, and the burnt sugar sweetness that comes with it. Thankfully, hops come in at the very end and do their best to balance the taste. They cannot quite do it, but the effort is very much appreciated. The alcohol makes its presence known along with some dark fruits at the tail end of the taste. A little more balance would be great, but as it is, this beer is off-the-charts amazing.
Mouthfeel: This beer is silky smooth on the palate, and has a great, minimalist syrupy character that makes it a joy to drink. Unfortunately, the carbonation is extremely minimal. It would really benefit the beer to be a tad fizzier, which would help separate out all the complexity going on here. The alcohol also provides a very calculated warmth that remains exactly in the realm of pleasantness. The carbonation, though…
Overall: This beer was everything I could have hoped it would be. After the first two categories, I thought this might be my first perfect 20/20. Unfortunately, it was not to be due to the slightly imbalanced taste and the almost complete absence of carbonation. Still, this is worth the hype. I cannot wait to try the bottle I currently have aging in the cellar. Things can only go up from here, as I assume it will level out the sweetness. 19/20 2,279 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Dec 23, 2012

Pours a sludge black color with a giant brown head that turned a nice tan color. Looks great.
Aromas come off as slight smokey, with hints of charred malts, molasses, bakers chocolate, and black coffee.
Taste is very similar to the nose. Slightly smokey up front, with notes of charred malts, brown sugar, molasses, and other dark chocolate. It's a sweet base, but restrained well. Finish has a nice earthy hop bitterness, and a touch of alcohol.
Mouthfeel is smooth, with plenty of body, viscous, and thick.
Overall, a superb beer. Lived up to my expectations, and might have even surpassed them a bit. Another excellent offering from Surly. 774 charactersflexabull, Dec 08, 2012

A: The beer is a deep black color, with a large light brown head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains roasted malts, dark fruit, licorice, chocolate, coffee and a touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out with a very hearty roasted malt character that is quickly followed by strong and sweet flavors of chocolate, coffee, licorice and dark fruit. There is no hint of the 10.30% ABV. The hops presence is very mild as you would expect but there’s enough to provide a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp, very smooth and quite viscous, heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, not only is it an excellent stout to drink for as long as you can handle it, it seems to have held up quite well for over 3 years. 1,068 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 06, 2012

That wouldn't been a good way to start. Once I finally got the top popped, the beer klugged out of the opening like motor oil. It's nearly black as coal and just as opaque. Except for the bottom edge of the glass, which when enough light does pass through, glints of cola brown are noted. The Irish coffee (not the cocktail--actual coffee in Ireland) foam-colored head is a stubborn, sticky, foamy one that certainly contributes to the sexiness of the beer. The nose is nice, but, surprisingly, not strong. Chocolate liqueur, lactose, mild smoky notes, and ripe banana are all present. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Creamy, smooth, viscous, and delightful. It never really dries up either, not even on the finish. I love the flavor of this one! Milk chocolate out of the gate. Alcohol shows up about midway and keeps things warm even after the finish. But the alcohol doesn't take away from the beer. If anything it helps temper the sweetness. This is reminiscent of the chocolate bourbon balls my Grandma used to make around Christmas time, only quite a bit less boozy. My Grandma could get a little carried away on the bourbon in her recipe. Dark ripe fruit, somewhere between a sweet cheery and a date, emerges late. It amazes me that more aroma doesn't blast out of this thing given the big flavor. This is a really nice Imperial Stout. One of the best that I've ever had. 1,467 charactersDocJitsu, Dec 02, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +10.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was looking for something to drink tonight, and it suddenly occurred to me that I have never reviewed a Surly beer. Which is odd enough, since I am sure I spend more money on Surly than I do on any other brewery. And on top of that, I haven't cracked a bottle of 2012 Darkness yet -- and didn't even sample it on Darkness Day. So...
...2012 Darkness it is! I chilled one down, then cut through the thick red wax, and popped the cap. I have Darkness tulips, but prefer the wider, deeper (and laser-etched) Duvel glass, so I poured vigorously into the Duvel.
It's black. Light does not penetrate this beer. The room seems dimmer, now that I have poured it. And I don't know why I'm always surprised by this, but Darkness produces rather large bubbles. The head is on the thin side, with the afore-mentioned big bubbles, but lasts a long time, and leaves little to no lacing.
Good Lord, this smells fantastic. If there's a hoppier RIS, I have never encountered it. There are tropical fruits, stone fruits, crazy levels of dark chocolate, orange, grapefruit...I just keep burying my nose in this glass.
But enough of that. This needs to be tasted. And wow. I expect this to be sweet, but it really isn't. It has all of the flavors promised by the nose, and more. It finishes with such a satisfying resin and bitterness. It's so soft, yet not sticky.
I'd like to end by offering a wholly subjective ranking of 2007-2012 Darkness, each of which I have had multiple times, and each of which I have had this past year. My order of preference is: 2007, 2009, 2012, 2010, 2011, 2008. Capsule reviews: 2007 was sublime. 2011 did not age well -- think soy sauce. 2008 was too sweet. 2009 was great fresh, as well as every year since. 2010 was super-drinkable fresh, and is still good, and 2012 is too young to know where it's headed. 1,828 charactersDaveAnderson, Nov 25, 2012

Darkness 2011 – Zombie print
750ml with a Goblet style glass
*Aged for one year 
Thanks Allen!
A: Pours a nice lush viscosity albeit thinner than I was anticipating. Sits dark black and obsidian like in the glass with just the slightest dark almond edge. Lighter than expected as well. First pour was relatively calm in terms of head. Others yielded a good half finger of sand paper froth that settles out to just a crown within a few minutes. Nice receding legs and dots of cling upon the glass.
S: Smells of sweetened chocolate syrup, think Hershey’s, mixed with a deep perfume of dark fruits and berries. Roasted cocoa nibs, dampened wood, and some black strap molasses. An amazingly complex blend of roasts.
T: Darkness is a sweet RIS with an expressive array of deep rich roasted malt flavors. Bitter dark chocolates, dark fruits - plum, dark berries, and toffee. I get some secondary notes of dark molasses, earthy wood, and a distinct meaty soy component. This beer has a nice peppering bitterness throughout and some warming alcohol heat. Really sweet yet remarkably balanced and drinkable for that fact. Alcohol seems quite restrained here. Hops really cut through that heavy sweetness allowing for the next sip. Delicious stuff!
M: Moderately heavy feel with a smooth consistency that leaves this one slick and creamy across the tongue. A bit syrupy at first bit with a nice drying lift from the carbonation. Finishes on the wetter side. 
D: A big bold RIS full of complex roast character that is just simply delicious. Drinks much on the sweeter side and should be approached almost as a dessert beer. Remarkably crafted though with enough hop bitterness and drying lift to keep this one rather quaffable. A really badass brew all around. I will be looking to try this one fresh but think this is drinking quite well right now and should stand up well for another 6-12 months with no issues. 
I am very happy to have such a solid trader. Do want! 1,981 charactersNugganooch, Nov 12, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This year, I was lucky enough to get the hook-up: my very own bottle of Darkness. Huge thanks to the one, the only, the bearded, the recently deceased backfat for this rare opportunity.
2012 batch, brewed pretty recently; the werewolf bottle art might be the most badass bottle art I’ve ever seen.
A: Deep, thick body in a midnight black hue, propelling a head of pure brown cream up to two fingers. The head compresses to a thick, bubbly retention, like the foam you get when pour chocolate milk too fast (only darker, shining wet in the light). Layers of sandy lacing everywhere, encircling the glass in a ring of tan color.
S: There’s a very aromatic nose on this, and with spectacular complexity. Tons and tons of fruit scents waft up a profile of bright cherry and raisin, which turn out to be the main aromas of this nose. Never had a Russian imperial stout smell like this before, but I love it! Toffee cascades over aromas of icing, sugar cookie, Hershey’s chocolate syrup (dead-on), and coffee with cream for the secondary layer, filling out every available portion of the nose with complexity. The nose rounds out in a cloud of vanilla, spicy bourbon, and whipped cream. Just astounding.
T: Bittersweet palate, emphasis on the bitter, though rich, dark flavors reach out at every turn. First tastes consist of toasty chocolate malt, cocoa powder, and toffee, but soon after, it’s an absolute bitter-fest – lemon rind, char, tart raspberry, acidic coffee, astringent alcohol, and pine, absolutely tongue-smacking in the hop taste. The astringency is almost overwhelming at times. The cherry and white raisin from the nose come in next, enveloping the palate in a genuine sweetness that overcomes the overly-present bitters; add the accompanying chocolate sauce taste that comes after and you have yourself a chocolate-covered strawberry. Finishes very bright – cherry puree is strong here – and with only a momentary, roasty notion that you just drank a 10% ABV stout. What a ride.
M: I’ve heard this year’s batch is hot, but I only got a touch of fire on the way down. Apart from that, it’s all smoothness, enough to even seem like a porter in strength – insanely drinkable.
O: Beer like this don’t come around to often; this is a stout the likes of which I don’t think I’ll find anywhere else. To be honest, it was hard to get acclimated to the Darkness at first (probably because of the hop presence), but I truly enjoyed every sip. This is worthy of a full day of celebration, for sure. 2,533 charactersBarryMFBurton, Nov 05, 2012

Pours oil black with two fingers of deep khaki head. Small pods lacing. 
Nose is pretty good but seems fairly subdued. Cocoa, roast malts and burnt sugar. 
Taste is a sweet blend of chocolate, soy sauce, coffee, cherry pits, rum soaked fig/dates and a dollop of alcohol heat. A fantastic blend. 
Excellent heavy tongue-coating feel with light carbonation. Lingering sweet finish. 
This is a great imperial stout. I think it might be too sweet to really be a Russian imperial but it's freakin good. Highly recommended and I'd definately like to get more sometime. 630 charactersThickNStout, Nov 03, 2012

10.3% ABV, 2010 Vampire design.
A - The thick pile of bubbles which rests on the beer displays an oily rainbow color swirling on it's surface. Coincidentally, it coincides with the thick, syrupy used oil-looking beer fills the snifter for a pitch-black darkness light cannot penetrate. Even with the high alcohol level, the head maintains its stature for quite some time, slowly lowering to leave a smattering of light bubbles on the snifter.
S - Sticky burnt molasses, lightly charred oak, and bitter dark chocolate are conjured up from a thick malt bill which incorporates more subdued notes of cold coffee, roasted malt, and cocoa. Hops provide just a miniscule drop of citrus and earthiness into the mix with an old, dusty basement sense pulling through. Even with two years on it, this beer still has some warming alcohol perception on the nose.
T - Darkness' rich malt level isn't surprising in flavor but what is, is the lack of bold roasted, almost burnt notes that the aroma exhibits. The taste compounds are much sweeter and subtler with smooth Hershey milk chocolate, a touch of black licorice, and soft molasses finishing out the back end. Dry cocoa and seemingly absent hops balance the malt sweetness' flavor as does just a hint of alcohol.
M - To describe this beer as full bodied would be quite the understatement. Smooth as black velvet (don't sue me Alanna Myles!) Darkness is almost creamy feeling with a rich, throat-coating finish that carefully teeters on the verge of sweetness and balance. All this while maintaining warming, soothing alcohol and an insatiable draw.
O - I recall Darkness having one of the hoppiest aromas of any Russian Imperial Stout I've encountered while being sweeter than all get-out. Suffice it to say, age has done this beer an incredible favor; rounding out some of the rougher edges for an insanely crave-able, lustful, sinfully delicious stout. For every bottle you hoped would age well and failed, Darkness makes up for, rewarding your patience with big dividends. This chocolaty, roasted malt-rich brew exceeds expectations of greatness and completely satisfies. 2,169 charactersBeerFMAndy, Oct 30, 2012

A: Pours as dark as ANY beer I've seen...dense and black and opaque with a cap of brown.
S: Dark roast character with intense notes of dark fruits and chocolate, with hints of coffee as well...burnt caramel, dark raisins, cherry pit, fudge, hints of molasses.
T: Right in line with the nose, dark and sweet malty notes with plenty of roasted backbone, deep dark pitted fruits, brown sugar and molasses, dark cherries, semi-acrid coffee, brownie batter. Still a bit of alcohol on the finish.
MF: Fuller mouthfeel, sticky and viscous. A tiny complaint, but it could be 'bigger'.
O: This is a very good-to-great beer. I can see why this one gets the attention it does, and I'm so glad to have tried it. Excellent stout in a world that's full of options.

S: interesting aroma which consisted of a little roastiness, chocolate malts, but with earthy hops coming through. I was able to sniff of caramel sweetness, molasses, and hints of brown sugar.
T: like the aroma chocolate malts were there upfront on the palate alongside some roastiness, pretty good earthy grassy hop profile which added a little bitterness to the flavor. Caramel molasses accents, and a touch of brown sugar.
M: the brew was medium to full in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, roasty, chocolatey, mild hoppy, silky, and slightly bitter finish.
O: I honestly was not really digging this beer and it has been on my gots list for some time now. This is one of those that just has too much hype IMO. 908 charactersGobzilla, Oct 14, 2012

Vintage 2011 (Zombie)
poured into snifter glass.
Appearance: black bodied beer with 1 finger of medium brown head. Decent lacing sticking on the side of the snifter.
Smell: Big malt profile with a decent amount of hops to balance. Big roast, caramel, molasses, and a hint of tobacco from the malts. Hops are pine. 
Taste: Brown sugar, caramel, toffee, chocolate, creamy nougat, and molasses. Mild roast and dark fruits. Cherries, tobacco, leather, and black licorice. Hops start to take over about midpalate. Then bakers cocoa, bitter cherries, and piney hops really linger for a while into the the aftertaste. Eventually the pine takes over the entire aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: medium almost full bodied beer. Moderate carbonation. Creamy and slightly chewy beer; almost syrupy, but its got a perfect carbonation level that keep the beer from getting very syrupy! This beer has no hint of alcohol and it drinks like it only 8%; soooo smooth. Rediculious mouthfeel on this beer. Its mouthfeel is perfect! Best attribute of this beer!
Overall: Really interesting RIS. It really throws out alot of big flavors and has alot of complexity in the malt profile of this beer. I appreciate that this beer is fairely different and unique from many other RIS in its respective beer style "family". I prefer less hops in my big stouts and this one is over run by piney hops on the back end of this beer. The hops distract too much from the malt profile in my opinion. The mouthfeel is simply amazing especially for a non-barrel aged beer. 1,642 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Oct 11, 2012

A massive mocha head erupts with infinite retention and bit webby, sticky lace. Aroma isn’t all the massive or even pleasant: salty olives, brine, lots of wood. As it warms the only thing that comes through is oxidized red apple slices. The taste is dry oak, spicy oak, slightly hot alcohol, sweet molasses and prunes. Palate is very soft, not too syrupy, ending somewhat chalky and powdery. Comes across as very basic and mediocre. How this is in the Top 100 and Midnight Sun Berserker is not baffles me.

Dark fruits - dates, raisins, figs, brown sugar, slight leather presence, black licorice, tons of roasted malts and a hop profile that is unmatched when it comes to unbarreled imperial stouts. 
Bitter toffee, faint alcohol presence, harsh chocolate, burnt almonds, caramel cake, molasses, overripe cherry, such a classic flavor profile. 
The mouthfeel is slick and viscous, oily, still highly drinkable given the style. Sugary.
Drink up, pussies. This one is best fresh. 623 charactersyamar68, Sep 23, 2012
3.73/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I have resisted the Darkness for too long. I've had a long, unproductive and otherwise kind of crappy day, so I figure I need to do a little sumpin' sumpin' for myself on a day like this. Review is from notes taken on 9/21/2012 and poured from the bottle (2009 mummy) to a snifter.
Appearance: Pour looks a little thick and viscous on the pour, definitely warrants some "glugs," but I feel that I've seen thicker, most notably Hunahpu, but that's THE exceptional beer; body is of course black and opaque; starts with a 1/2 finger dark, creamy tan head that fades to a loose, incomplete head with a full swath of lacing dripping slowly down the sides of the glass.
Smell: Upon cracking this, there is a strong, smoky, soy sauce blast in the nose; it eventually settles a little bit and there is some pretty big and roasty maltiness there with a touch of burnt coffee, possibly espresso; I would swear there is a touch of vanilla lying about in there, as well as a touch of sweet, yet slightly tart, cherries; just a touch of alcohol lingers, but it seems really well blended in the nose.
Taste: You know, it's good, but I'm really not blown away like I was hoping to be. I'm actually reminded a little bit of 2010 DL -- big, smoky and almost salty/soy sauce (not in a bad way); bit of a buttery sweetness hanging out in the back and there is some slick, syrupy semi-sweet chocolate; touch of roastiness. I have to wonder if it's past its prime?
Mouthfeel: Body is indeed thick and heavy, but it's fairly slick and leaves just a little bit of grit on the teeth; thick, but loose and slightly sticky coating is left all over the roof of the mouth; belly does register some warmth.
Overall: I would be willing to try it again if it comes in to my possession, but it will be drank immediately instead of giving it the opportunity to age and develop. Sometimes cellaring works well and you get a whole new product, and sometimes, you get disappointed. Sipper, with big alcohol, may be tough to get through the whole bottle on my own, but I'll figure out how to make do. 2,068 charactersbamadog, Sep 22, 2012

This pours dark. And by dark I mean black. No light penetrates with a dark mocha head. Really a great looking stout. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Swirling the glass viscous motor oil appearance.
Smell is of dark fruits some roasted grain. Light Licorice. A little caramel sweetness as it warms.
Waves of flavors on this one. Tastes of Sweet malts. Burnt sweet cherries. Light licorice and I am thankful it's not too strong, just enough. Dark chocolate fruit notes on the finish. Slight chocolate cake batter. A nice residual sweetness on the finish. Alcohol is well hidden.
Nice creamy mouth feel. Is full without being too heavy.
Overall an impressive imperial stout. I can't think of a non-barrel aged imperial stout with more going on that this. 794 charactersPowderhornphil, Sep 08, 2012

Big thanks to Masterski for getting me this rarity. 
Poured from a bomber and split with my wife.
Appearance: Pours a thick body, kind of almost plops in with a thin ting that grows thicker as the pour intensifies.
Smell: Alcohol soaked nuts, raisins and figs. Whiffs of cocoa and chunks of chocolate but much more on the sugary, dark fruits side.
Taste: Raisins, figs, nougat, discreet chocolate and a tinge of black licorice. A bit of coffee as it warms but this resembles a barleywine almost. Not exactly what i'm looking for flavor-wise.
Mouthfeel: Boozy a bit, slight;y bitter and you eventually get in a groove but this doesn't feel like the strong RIS i'm looking for.
Overall: Have to say i'm a bit disappointed by this one. Compared to DL, this one is not as good. Flavors were good but for me, not worth the hype IMO. I'll take a DL instead. 885 characterspapat444, Sep 06, 2012

4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 42011 vintage. Shared the bottle with angrybabboon. 
Appearance: Pours a dark dark brown with some dark red notes. Sits close to black in the glass. Head is the color of fresh espresso crema. Chunky and rocky and creamy. Decent retention. Chunky cap. 
Smell: Huge dark fruit. Plums and bing cherries. Big roasted compliment. Leather and touches of char. Chocolate malts and cocoa powder. Lingering booze. Dry-dusted chocolate coffee beans. So much leather. Burnt and roasty. Booze soaked plums. Layers of chocolate. 
Taste: Leather and cocoa. Huge hits of roasted malt. Burnt malts. Char. Raisins and ripe cherries. Loads of burnt malts. Milk chocolate sweetness layered in the back. Almost brownie like chocolate in the back. Nicely sweet. Alcohol runs through the back. As it warms the leather and burnt malts take the forefront. Hints of vanilla and caramel. Dutch cocoa. Bitter dryness
Mouthfeel: Full body, but a little thinner than I expected. Mild carbonation. Slight astringency. 
Overall: Solid, very solid. Great flavor, but the body ultimately falls a little short given the intense malts of the beer. I've tried it at beer fests and in a blind stout tasting. It comes out just over the middle of the pack. Incredible flavor. 1,240 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Aug 19, 2012

Note: 2011 vintage (zombie)
Consumed 8/19/12
Appearance: Dark, dark brown with some around the edges - big, tan head, keeps a nice cap, some streaks of lacing - looks like an RIS should
Smell: Dark, roasty, and burnt - cooked, toasted, roasted, and charred malts - milk chocolate and some dark chocolate - molasses, with a lot of sweetness - sweet, dark fruits - interesting, but not remarkably complex
Taste: More sweetness than darkness - molasses, brown sugar, and a ton of port-like boozy sweetness - dark fruits, milk chocolate, and some sweet coffee - roasty and burnt, but the dark fruit/port/sugary sweetness really overpowers - (2012 bottle) smoke and tobacco in abundance
Mouthfeel: Full, smooth, creamy, some boozy stickiness, but it works because it is nicely carbonated
Overall: Good, but too sweet to be legendary
I am very happy that I finally had a chance to sit down with a glass of this. I've had it at BA fests and at an epic stout tasting, and I always thought it was too sweet. And apparently I was not imagining it. It's just too sweet. But if you're into that, I guess this would be epic.
Update: 2012 bottle
Slightly better than I remember. It's still overly sweet, but it's quite tasty overall. There is more smoke and tobacco than I remember. Maybe it's just more interesting than the first bottle. Scores upgraded slightly (taste and overall bumped up .25).
Update: 2015 bottle
Maybe it's just because I was actually at 2015 Darkness Day, but this tastes special. I wouldn't describe this batch as overly sweet. Very rich and chocolatey, with some depth and some leather, with a rich, velvety mouthfeel. I'm bumping taste, feel, and overall all up .25. 1,754 charactersangrybabboon, Aug 19, 2012

A- looks thick and creamy with a nice thick mocha head, looks promising
S- as soon as I cracked the cap the huge dark fruits fill the room, I know this is going to be good. Right up front huge dark fruits. Some roastyness lots of richness and malty sweetness
T- this guy is huge on taste. Dark fruits upfront, slight roastyness followed by some sweetness. Fantastic chocolate. This one really delivers, packs a wallop
M- mouthfeel on this one is perfect, huge rich and creamy, couldn't be more spot on. Coats the mouth with huge flavor.
O- I really wasn't expecting to this guy be this good. There's a lot of hype surrounding this guy and I can now see why. The dark fruit is huge, actually reminds me of mission street 2011 anny if you can believe it.0 I really hope to make darkness day one day.

A - The pour is fittingly black with at least a finger of thick brown head. The lacing really coats the glass nicely with a creamy head that seemingly lasts forever.
S - Very sweet aromas of dark fruits, berries, figs all covered in chocolate with a little bit of caramel and coffee to round it out. 
T - Deep, dark, delicious chocolate just dominates the taste. Overall it is sweet, but not overly sweet as sometimes experienced with big Russian Imperial Stouts.
M -Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied, smooth with creamy medium carbonation. 
O - A great non-barrel aged stout. There were times that I noticed barrel like qualities. Overall another great brew from Surly. 686 charactersSkiBum22, Jul 15, 2012

A - Poured ink black. Half a finger of medium brown head with good retention. 
S - Roasted malts, smoke and a noticeable hop presence up front. A big semi-sweet chocolate aroma and a touch of licorice round out the nose.
T - Extremely robust flavour up front. Starts out with huge roast and semi-sweet chocolate flavours with a touch of smoke. Some sweet molasses and a fairly prominent hop profile enter in the middle. The finish is full of sweet chocolate and has a lingering bitterness. The ABV is very well hidden. The perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. 
M - Full body. Thick and viscous. Light carbonation. 700 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jul 08, 2012

Thanks, stig!

This is a truly beautiful beer. The beer is black throughout with a 2-finger, dark brown head that actually has some significant staying power. The beer is somewhat thick in body, shiny, and leaves the glass messy with a sheen and spattering of lace.
A somewhat atypical aroma for a big stout, as there's some defined pine-like hop notes, along with dark chocolate, dark fruits, and strong roast. This is hoppier than most any other big stout, though it all works together nicely.
Dark roast and dark chocolate dominate the flavor, along with bit of pine-like hop character. Moderate level of bitterness and this most certainly hides its alcohol well.
Full bodied with moderate carbonation and somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Incredibly nice. A terrifically constructed beer.
A somewhat hoppy, though balanced big stout. It's probably not worth the sticker price, all things considered, but always a fun bottle to share no matter the time or place. 1,015 charactersehammond1, Jun 19, 2012

pours a jet-black tone while yielding a strong, creamy mocha-colored head. outstanding retention and lacing. nose offers lots of roasted malt and chocolate, with secondary notes of anise and coffee. very nice.
wow, flavor is right behind the aroma, backing it up with huge, bold characteristics of roasted malt, chocolate, anise, coffee, and a hint of dark fruits. maybe even a twang of smoke in the background. deliciously complex. medium-full mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.
overall this a superb RIS, no doubt about it. very, very well done. just wish it were easier to get a hold of.

Pour is black. Small but thick, frosty white head.
Smells is very full bodied, yet still has hints of bitterness. Thick leathery roasty malt comes to mind, as well as a good bit of dark chocolate.
The taste is complex as hell. Thick roasted tries to come out, but the bitterness (reminiscent of coffee and extremely bitter dark chocolate) just takes over. Theres also subtle sweet dark fruits that really separate this from other RISs. Theres a creaminess as well that really balances out what could be a deep roasty, leathery, super sweet bomb. Its got a nice balance, and it feels nice. Almost like nitro. 689 charactersVncentLIFE, Jun 07, 2012

Look: Very dark pretty much black body with a 1/4 tan head and ok retention and some spotty lacing
Smell: The nose for me really doesn't work. It is a combination of chocolate dark fruits a touch of vanilla sweetness and piney hops
Taste: Again just not a fan of the taste. It starts of slightly sweet with some chocolate caramel and vanilla and finishes with a piney bitterness that just does not work for me
Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium to mild carbonation and bitter
Overall: This beer reminds me more of a cda than a RIS. The flavors are all over the place and just do not mix well for me. Definitely not worth seeking out 681 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jun 05, 2012

A - Pitch black body that shows show red tints when the glass gets low enough. Perfect dark khaki two finger high head. Moderate lacing and retention. Damn near perfect. 4.5/5
S - Amazingly decadent burnt dark fruits, almost quad like but backed up with some amazing stout aromas. Cocoa powder, vanilla, and coffee beans. 4.0/5
T - Rich and smooth milk chocolate, fruity red wine notes, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, coffee and some light licorice. Very smooth with all of these flavors blending together perfectly. Aftertaste is a bit bitter. 4.5/5
M - No alcohol present, even at room temperature. Medium to heavy bodied with some lively carbonation. Somewhat syrupy and coating. 4.0/5
O - This is the best RIS and certainly the best non barrel aged stout I have tried. Thats probably due to my love of quads and dark fruits which this stout has on full display. For me there has always been three icons of the big waxed stout world. Abyss, Darklord, and Darkness. The Abyss is roasty and tobaco rich, Darklord is an overtly sweet vanilla bomb, and Darkness is strong on the dark fruits. This is just about perfect for me. 4.5/5 (4.45 score)

750 ml red waxed bottle into a Founders 15th anny glass. Served at cellar temperature.
A - Pours a pitch black body. Two fingers of light mocha foam from the pour settles into a one finger lasting cap that looks like the head of a latte. Swirling creates a thick wall of lacing that cascades down leaving behind strings of foam. Absurd retention level. 5.0/5
S - Dark fruits, brightly roasted malt, espresso beans, and vanilla. Powdery chocolate and molasses. Sweet and savory. 4.0/5
T - Rich dark chocolate and sweet milk chocolate, roast and char, espresso, molasses, and some piney hops. Long and harsh finish that's bitter and boozy. The aftertaste is just phenomenal though. Vanilla rich fudge and dark fruit. 4.0/5
M - For being only 10% abv this beer feels MUCH larger. Thick and syrupy, very coating and rich. Perfect dessert beer. 4.5/5
O - Still a phenomenal beer (that I'd chose over Abyss and Darklord) but I'm afraid I'm just not a huge fan of this beer when its on the fresher side. The hops are present and I just wish the pine and citric notes would take a back seat to the rich chocolate and dark fruits. 4.0/5 2,512 charactersdavey101, Jun 04, 2012

A: Pours black in color with a nice two finger tan head on top. The head lasts for a little while leaving a foam cap on top. Thin lacing forms all around the glass. 
S: Tons of dark fruit on the aroma, cherry and plum dominate. There is some chocolate and cocoa mixed in as well. Exactly what I am looking for. 
T: This beer tastes great, more dark fruit (cherry, plum, raisin) mixed with chocolate and minimal roast coming forward. There is a touch of honey and caramel. 
M: Medium to full bodied, extremely smooth with moderate carbonation. 
O: Very impressed, probably my favorite non BA stout. It drinks so easy that it would get me in trouble if I had a lot of it. Definitely a beer I will try to get more of. 814 charactersmdaschaf, Jun 01, 2012

A: Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a nice dark brown head that fades to a ring and leaves some lacing on the glass.

T: The taste is really great. There are big flavors of honey, chocolate, dark fruits, earthy hops, and a touch of citrus on the finish. 
M: The feel is on the fuller side of medium with a great creamy finish.
O: The age has toned down the hops a bit and let the other flavors really come forward. We drank this side by side with a 2011 and the newer bottle was a bit on the harsher side as far as the hops but the flavor was still really good. 724 charactersGregSVT, May 22, 2012

M: Thick and heavy. Low carbonation. 
O: Interesting RIS. Very fruity, almost over-the-top compared to most. You don't even get any roasted malt until the second half of the taste. It is very tasty and I enjoyed it, but I tend to feel that the root of a great RIS is a major roasted malt aspect, and this one is more of a minority. Otherwise it is a complex, balanced and flavorful beer so I have to give it credit where credit is due. If you're a fan of sweet, fruity RISes, this one is for you. 1,071 charactersDope, May 12, 2012

Black. Pretty viscous. A little oily. Nice fluffy khaki head with pretty good retention and spotty lacing. 
Pretty nice nose with sweet toasted brown sugar and mild dark fruit. 
Flavor follows the nose. Pretty sweet. Notes of brown sugar, molasses, dark malt and brownie-like chocolate. 
Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied, smooth with creamy medium carbonation. 
Overall it's a good beer but a little bit of a disappointment. I for some reason was hoping for a bit more, and more depth. Good flavor and characteristic but leaves a little more to be desired. 572 charactersMrVonzipper, May 04, 2012

Appearance: Nice pour with persistent fluffy dark tan head. Colored the glass nicely with a faint yellow sheen, but didn't leave any notable lacing.
Nose: Very vinous, loaded with dark fruitiness, black currants, cherry, raisin. Bump because it's a clean fermentation, big alcohol is not evident.
Flavor: Fruity, not nearly enough roastiness, reminiscent of very high cacao content chocolate bar.
Mouthfeel: Way too watery for an imperial anything.
Overall: Tonight's tasting pitted Darkness and Dark Lord against half a dozen competitors and found these two wax topped whale beers sadly lacking. Instead of standing in line at Darkness day, skip the line and grab a Furious or Bender to enjoy great Surly brews, and an Oskar Blues Ten FIDY for an awesome RIS in a can. 840 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Apr 29, 2012

A - Deep brown, almost black in color. Had a nice off white head that sat on top throughout.
S - Smells of cocoa, vanilla, and slight caramel. Has a strong hop, pine presence that comes through in the nose. Get a hint of the alcohol coming through as well
T - Taste at first is sweet caramel with a hint of chocolate. It is almost like a milky way at first. As the beer continues there is a stronger vanilla flavor that comes through. Near the finish we get a hint of bitter hops that reminds us that this is a surly beer 
MF - No carbonation at all. There is a slight stickiness to it and it had a medium body that is not too thick or thin.
O - Solid RIS from Surly. Has a good balance between the sweeter flavors, cocoa, and hops on the backend. Nice to get if I ever get a chance to make it out to Darkness Day 892 charactersjeonseh, Apr 28, 2012

Poured from 2011 to Duvel tulip the beer arrives a deep dark black color with a finger's worth of tannish head, good retention and lacing. Looks thick. The nose is a very enjoyable roast mixed with dark fruits and sweet caramel tones. Smells great! The flavor follows suit with an impressive smooth creaminess. The roast and sweetness found in the nose are more pronounced and coupled with hints of bakers chocolate and dark fruits. Sweet but not overly so. Mildly bitter and hides the alcohol very well. Finishes smooth and creamy with a lingering roast and hint of the dark fruit, perhaps a touch dry. Overall, this is a fantastic brew! What a treat! 682 charactershopfacebrew, Apr 23, 2012

Taste: Sweet and roasty. This beer is extremely smooth considering how new it is. Some dark chocolate and dark fruit notes. The finish is sweet and roasty with a slight bitterness. Just a hint of alcohol warmth.
Mouthfeel: Thick body with extremely smooth carbonation and just a touch of dryness in the finish.
Overall: This beer lives up to it's hype. Better than I remember when I had the 2010 version. I'll definitely have another some time. 789 charactersoline73, Apr 21, 2012

2011 Zombie Vintage
Big thanks to haveanother1 for sending this one over in a trade
A: Pours a somewhat viscous jet black, with only the slightest browning around the edges, and 1 fingers width of dark mocha colored head which dissipates down at a fairly slow rate to a thin film.  Leaves a small amount of patchy lacing.  
S: The aroma is so sweet, with tons of dark fruit including raisin, plum, and red grape.  Other aromas noted are a significant bourbon character, a touch of black licorice, some anise,  and booze.  I get almost none of the  roasted/chocolate/coffee aromas that are present in  most RIS, but still, just an awesome aroma. 
T: Unlike the nose, the flavors noted on the first sip are roasted malt, coffee and bitter bakers chocolate.  The dark fruits are there as well, with fig and raisin.  I also detect notes of vanilla, anise, milk chocolate that's reminiscent of a chocolate milkshake, a balancing booze character, and a touch of hop bitterness.  There is a lot going on in the palate profile, and really well balanced which prevents any one characteristic (ie the sweetness) from becoming cloying.  
M/D: Smooth, full bodied but not as thick as some of the other big RIS's.  Carbonation is not terribly high, but heavier than some.  A somewhat chewy and sticky mouthfeel which coats the palate nicely.  Very nice mouthfeel but could be thicker.  Still way above average, plus it gets even smoother as it warms and the carbonation subsides.  Drinkability is actually very good for such a big beer, and the ABV is very well contained. 
O: Overall, really a great beer.  Well worth the wait, and worth the hype.  Not sure when I will get ahold of another one of these, but when I do I'll be sure to enjoy the hell out of it.   1,822 characterszac16125, Apr 12, 2012

Mummy pic, so I'm guessing 2009.
A: Very thick pour, black with a tan head, only a thin ring of retention but leaves some nice lace.
S: Black strap molasses, bakers chocolate and bourbon. Nice, but not as much aroma as one might expect.
T: Black strap molasses, bakers chocolate, espresso, salted licorice, piny resin from the new-school hopping (a bit dank), tobacco, caramelized raisins, sponge toffee. Seriously bitter, but not at all harsh. Nice alcohol warmth. It seems like it spent some time in a bourbon barrel. I really like the malts here, plenty of chocolate, a good amount of black and a restrained amount of roasted barley... it's like they brewed it for me.
M: Full, thick, creamy body has some roasted acidity.
D/O: One heck of brew. 785 charactersDerek, Mar 26, 2012

Review #666
The beer poured near pitch black and super oily. A two-finger, super tight, creamy and bubbly head of saddle brown froth topped the liquid. Impressive retention. Sheets of patchy lacing coated the glass.
The aroma was astounding. Super deep, dark and sweet. Tons of roasted malts and brown sugar notes. Loads of vanilla. Slightly boozy. It was difficult believing that this beer was not Bourbon barrel aged. Good amount of powdered cocoa. Some dark fruit sweetness was also noticeable. Touch of anise. Freshly brewed coffee notes came through as well.
The taste was just as amazing as the nose. A boatload of roasted malts appeared on the front end. As in the aroma, there was a distinct, boozy, Bourbon-like sweetness. Brown sugar and vanilla notes were nearly overwhelming. Tons of rich, smooth, dark chocolate. Good dose of molasses. Some dark fruit notes. A bit of anise. The finish was moderately boozy and slightly roasty, with a hint of char. A fair amount of citrusy hops came through as well (just enough to balance out the sweetness). Espresso notes were also noticeable.
The beer was silky smooth. Slick, creamy and plush with a fine, moderate effervescence. Nearly full bodied for style. After each sip, the liquid left a sticky film on my lips. The only thing preventing me from giving the mouthfeel a "5" was that the beer could have been a bit more viscous.
Simply put Darkness is an outstanding beer. It really won me over with its consistency across all categories. You would be hard pressed to find a more well rounded version of the style. 1,703 charactersDamian, Mar 25, 2012

A: Dark charcoal with mocha head lacing.
S: This is one aromatic beer that has bourbon booze character with madagascar chocolate malts, red berries, strawberry jam, semi sweet cocoa nibs and light Colombian perk coffee.
T: Starts of smooth, bourbon burnt sugar followed up by a luscious strawberry puree (that means stop reading and go and buy it!) soft 60 percent dark cocoa, nice sappy malts. This beer had multilayered range that begs for more. (In fact I bought 2 more)
M: Very Creamy and silky smooth. Medium carbonation gets cut by the milky nature of this behemoth. The bourbon carries nicely and the oaked nature is outstanding. Not overbearing like other brews.
O: A delicious, delicious stout! I drank 3 for the review, ok 2 then before I left I got another one to ponder on talking beer shop with Thomas. I can't wait to get my hands on this in bottle. Sadly I have to order online, no one stocks it in DC!! DAMN IT!!!. 
This stout comes in number 3 all time. SOrry Old Ras..you got knocked down again! 1,071 characterschallenja, Mar 21, 2012

It pours black with a pretty significant brown head and nice lacing. The smell isn't quite what I expected, there is very little roast or coffee and instead the aroma is more sweet and chocolate with a little bit of alcohol. The taste is also much sweeter than I was hoping for. Chocolate is the primary flavor here and there even seems to be a hint of dark fruit. For my palate though, it's just a little too sweet and could've used some more roast to balance it out a little. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, not as full as your average RIS, but very smooth. I was really hoping that my second experience with Surly Darkness would be more impressive than the first, but this beer and I just aren't on the same page. It's not a bad beer, but I really don't understand why everyone goes crazy over it, it's too sweet and doesn't have a whole lot else going on. 975 charactersstarrdogg, Mar 17, 2012

Pours with a nice short off white head that recedes to a small ring around the edge of the glass. Very very dark beer. No lacing. Aroma is a bit fruitier than I would have expected. Some roast and cocoa. Flavor goes fruitiness, coffee, then cocoa. There is a mild smokiness as well. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I would have expected for this beer. Was looking for a bit more body. Good carbonation though. Not too sweet, not too bitter, very enjoyable beer. Lived up to the hype for me. 503 charactersAgold, Mar 15, 2012

A real nice dark cocoa brown head is presented, falls slowly. Manages to leave a real nice whispy puck and collar while finishing. Body color gives a slightly good oily sheen, but nothing filimy, and the body color is nearly jet black (I'll go walnut black)
Nose hits with mild char, faint milk chocolate, incredibly soft bodied and silky smelling, like whipped up mocha. Unfortunately there's something also medicinal on this as well.
Taste goes to sweetened coffee, and warming hot cocoa. A very noticeable taste of confectioners sugar, maybe even some maple. It's nicely balanced though between all these palate flavors, maybe even some faint hop bitter on the finish. Palate matches the sense of smelling velvet and rich silk. But incredibly sweet tasting though and mostly just "noticeably sweet" which makes it a bit one dimensional.
Overall though, it reminds me too much of CBS on tap but nowhere as impressive, and has that noticeable sugar sweetness which gets to me a bit. It's an impressive beer, but I just don't enjoy drinking this at all compared to others I've had. 1,148 characterssmakawhat, Mar 14, 2012
4.53/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 Run on-tap at a Surly event at Churchkey in DC.
A: The pour is fittingly black with at least a finger of thick brown head. The lacing really coats the glass nicely with a creamy head that seemingly lasts forever.
S: The aroma starts continues the wonderful experience that is Surly Darkness. Roast mixes with the chocolate and molasses in amounts that you'd expect from a good RIS. A slight booze character ties is all together.
T: Deep, dark, delicious chocolate just dominates the taste. Overall it is sweet, but not cloyingly so as sometimes experience with big Russian Imperial Stouts. The roast really helps out here. It is subtle but as the beer warms and the booze sticks out its head, the roast lends a nice balance.
MF: Darkness rests really thick on the palate, yet still boasts a nice amount of carbonation. The finish is not as dry as I had anticipated, but a warming alcohol sensation is noted. This is just so drinkable it's on a different level compared to other big stouts.
O: This rare Surly offering blows me away each time I have it. Really stands alone without the help of barrel aging. A must try for big beer lovers anywhere. 1,157 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 13, 2012

2011 vintage
shared and pured into snifter
Color: Deep, dark, and black. a beautiful tan head of 1 1/2 finger head forms at the end of your pour. Light lacing and some good head retention are left behind in the glass.
Nose: Big time roasted malts... like so big in your face roasted malts. A delightful hop aroma arises from this beer along with hints of espresso and mild chocolate.
Palate: Boom! Out of the gate you get bitter coffee along with the perfect compliment to it sweet mild chocolate. As the beer makes it down your tongue you get many different aspects of this beer: roasted malts, hops and a tad of warmth from the abv. The drinkablity of this beer is just sublime, the carbonation is just right and this full bodied beer just goes down easy.
Finish: Near perfect Russian Imperial Stout. Quite layered with a long finish. you can taste this beer well after you have taken down your sip. A nice bitterness come through here along with a gentle sweetness to chase it away. Just good.

2011 Vintage:
Pours a dark black, coal colored body. Tan head, not much besides some pools of bubbles.
Milk chocolate, sweet plums, slight whiskey barrel, even though this isn't BA.
Sweet milk chocolate, espresso bean and some oakiness. Smooth and creamy. Light hopping, some woodiness. Dark fruit sweetness.
This is an awesome, smooth, delicious stout. I can't believe this isn't barrel aged. 
2010 Vintage:
Black body, with a small, tan head that leaves a pool of bubbles.
Aromas of dark chocolate, chicory and espresso beans. Some boozy, warming aromas.
Dark chocolate, bitter and sweet. Woody bitterness and espresso. Warming booziness, with some whiskey like tones.
Not quite as smooth, but a great stout.
The fresher vintage was a little better to me, but this is just a great stout. Do not miss this one! 946 characterslitheum94, Feb 29, 2012

A: As the beer pours, it has a black-brown colour. It has a strong coffee coloured head that develops quite nicely and has great retention. Leaves nice chunky lace as well.
S: Quite hoppy, with clear aromas of coffee and cocoa. The hops aroma has elements of middle eastern herbs. Upon a swirl, the beer gives off a very sweet aroma, filled with dark fruits and vanilla.
T: There is an initial sweetness that tells you a lot of the final gravity of the beer (it IS a heavy beer). A lot of molasses and dark fruits, like dates and plums. Aside from that the taste is just BIG and complex. Alcohol became too prominent after the beer warmed up to room temperature.
M: Beer is heavy and very smooth. It has a certain oilyness that works wonderfully. Carbonation is silky smooth.
O: I was expecting better, but this is nonetheless a brilliant beer. 871 charactersGary779, Feb 28, 2012

2011 Zombie Vintage
Thanks to futura123 for hooking me up with this one, it was one of my first wants after joining BA! 
Appearance: Well, what do you expect from a beer called Darkness? Pitch black in the glass, with only the faintest deep red edges visible when held to the light. A rough pour yields a massive coffee coloured head that lasts stunningly well for such a big beer and even leaves some thick lacing on the upper reaches of the glass as it recedes. 
Smell: Wow, this is way hoppier than I expected! A stunning mixture of rich cocoa, black coffee and grassy hops make up the initial sniff. Further inspection reveals an unexpected sweetness, dark fruits, molasses, roasted malt, light char, liquorice and a touch of vanilla. As the beer approaches room temperature a hint of the 10,3% is noted. 
Taste: Absolutely delicious! The initial flavour is sweet with notes of molasses, dark fruits and liquorice. This quickly fades into cocoa, strong coffee, roasted malt, light char, more molasses and finally to a lingering bitter coffee and grassy hop finish. 
The 10,3% is almost perfectly covered and is only there to remind you not to gulp! 
Mouthfeel: Perfect! Full, slightly sticky body with a low level of super smooth carbonation. The finish is lingering with a light dryness. 
Overall: This is a stunning big stout, I cannot thank William enough for sending this bottle my way! I am going to have to try and get a bottle of each future release! 1,546 charactersThehuntmaster, Feb 16, 2012

Friend refurbished an old office and turned it into a man cave. Copper clad bar, recliners, two draft taps, and a flat screen TV. What better way to break it in than with a tasting. So I decided to grab a 22oz bottle from my stash of blind beers and cart it along with some other tasty for the event.
Eight participants total in this tasting and after a couple bottles we decided we should taste the blind beer before our palettes were too fatigued. Beer poured jet black with nice creamy dark tan head. Aroma is chocolate and malt with a slight fusel tinge. This is an imperial stout, no doubt about it. Pass the bottle around and everyone takes a pour. The aroma on this beer is great, I could sniff it all night long. Flavor is velvety chocolate deliciousness. I immediately start thinking its a bottle of Stone 12th Anni. I would have went with Darkness, but no wax on the bottle. Mouth feel is smooth and viscous in body and little to no hop acidity in the back of my mouth. Everyone unanimously enjoyed this beer.
The reveal: Darkness 2011! A want and a very tasty treat. I'm glad I was able to share it with a bunch of friends as I would have been under the table trying to drink that on my own. Not that I wouldn't have tried. Taking the wax off was a slick move and a great way to throw me off the trail. 1,391 charactersneorunner, Feb 14, 2012

Body is pitch black with a viscous appearance and a deep brown head that is darker than many other beers' body; minimal retention and moderate lacing, though not surprising. Aroma is of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, faint roasted malt, date, raisin, and a touch of plum. Very well balanced. Tastes of vanilla, dark cherries, milk chocolate, caramel, cane sugar, and slight roasted malts. Surprisingly smooth and complex. Mouthfeel is thick in texture, but it goes down smoothly with a creamy finish that thinly coats the mouth. Overall, a great RIS. It has a lot going on flavor-wise, but does well to balance them into a single, cohesive offering. This was the highlight of the tasting. 816 characterseclipse54, Feb 06, 2012

Bottles to Westvletren 12 (small) chalice
From notes. This lengthy review comes as a result of a tasting in Utrecht (December 2011) where we compared the 2008 (Devil), 2009 (Mummy), 2010 (Vampire), and 2011 (Zombie) all in a row. Only one missing is 2007, but let's be honest - no one has any of those left. A real treat to try all of these vintages at once - thanks to Jeffo and doopiedoopiedoo for their generosity!
We started with the youngest vintage and worked our way back. My favorite of the vintages was 2010, so that's what my review above is based on - I didn't want to get into complicated weighted averging and what not. My notes below were quite simple because we blazed through these four beers rather quickly.
Zombie - Vintage 2011
A: Dark burgundy. Faint (off white) fingernail head on vigorous pour.
S: Cocoa, espresso, and burnt dark malt.
T: Molasses, dark chocolate, fig, and oak. 
M: Medium-full bodied with minimal carbonation.
O: Quite young and needs some age.
Vampire - Vintage 2010
A: Opaque black. Half (tan) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Sweet booze with a wonderful balance of currants, fig, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and charred dark malt.
T: Brilliant, smooth, rich, and complex. Dark cherry, robust oakness, and sweet chocolate. Nice! 
M: Full bodied with hidden (low) carbonation.
O: Just how a RIS should drink - dark, strong, bold, and smooth!
Mummy - Vintage 2009
A: Dark brown. 1.5+ (mocha) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Fresh garden of veggies - green pepper, squash, and . Very boozy as well. Not too inviting.
T: Tastes better than it smells. Deep, dark fruit, cinnamon, semi-sweet chocolate, and very roasted dark malt.
M: Full bodied with medium carbonation.
O: Seems a bit off to me, but I'm not sure how this is supposed to hold up with age. I would assume alright, but maybe it has fallen off already.
Devil - Vintage 2008
A: The coolest label of them all! Opaque brown. Barely a single (off-mocha) fingernail head on gentle pour.
S: Caramel, dark chocolate, and oak. Hint of green pepper, but it may just be lingering from the 2009 pour.
T: Wow! Sweet caramel, molasses, brandy, and dark chocolate. Nice and robust; very well-balanced.
M: Full bodied with soft (perfect) carbonation.
O: Nice and smooth - seems to have done fine with age, so I think the 2009 vintage is just off. Tasty brew for sure! 2,395 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 31, 2012

2010 vintage poured into a snifter
Looked black as night with a short layer of light brown head. About what I'd expect, though I have to admit that, for some reason, it looked more sinister than most stouts as it sat in my glass. The smell was fruity and fudgey, think brandy soaked cherries and rich dark chocolate. Almost thought of a Black Forest cake. Slightly astringent though and not as sugary sweet as that analogy would lead on. No hops to speak of. The taste was incredible. Lots of the aforementioned chocolate and dark cherries, but also a noticeable brown sugar/caramel component and a smooth coffee flavor. Not a very sweet beer, but not bitter or tart either, just right. Barely noticeable hops, but that was perfect. Just enough to add some balance. Feel was velvety smooth and thick like motor oil, just like a stout this big should be.
I was, overall, very impressed and can definitely say that the hype around this beer is well founded. I don't think I'll be getting my hands on another bottle any time soon, but if I ever do, I hope it will be as enjoyable as this one was. 1,242 characterskbanks13, Jan 30, 2012

A- Just what you'd expect from a RIS. Very dark and little head/retention
S- Meh. This smells licorice-y with some dark fruits in the background. Also picking up some roasty notes 
T- First thing that comes to mind is "Licorice Juice." I'm not digging this at all. I was glad to have guys in my group who enjoyed this as I didn't have to pour mine down the drain. 
M- Decent carbonination with some chewiness which I like but the flavor makes this impossible to enjoy. 
O- Was this beer too aged? Maybe, I'm sure there are plenty of people that will enjoy this beer, I'm just not one of them. I want to try a fresh bottle to see differences 687 characterspschul4, Jan 28, 2012

Pours a nice 1 finger milk chocolate head, body is pitch black. Head retention was good and lacing was very good. 
Smell is of rich chocolate cake batter, roasted coffee, charred oak, and slight alcohol. As soon as I opened bottle, aromas went directly in my nose. There is also some oxidation, prunes, but no hops.
Taste is charred oak, burnt chocolate malt, slightly bitter coffee, and chalky bakers chocolate. There is slight soy sauce/oxidation and prunes but chocolaty sweetness helps hide it. Hops really arent detected here. Alcohol is slightly present but for 10 percent, its very smooth
Mouthfeel is nice and rich, almost chewy. Carbonation is on the higher side but it helps to keep the body from becoming too syrupy. Small head of foam adds some nice texture to the beer.
Overall this beer was pretty good. Been waiting acouple years to try this beer and glad I finally got my hands on it. As a big vampire fan was really stoked to get this vintage but at around 18 bucks a bottle, dont know if I'd trade for it again. Tasty stout though, glad I received it in a BIF 1,109 charactersangelmonster, Jan 25, 2012
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Bangers and Lace in Chicago. Poured into a snifter.
A- Pours pretty damn dark, black with a finger of creamy coffee colored head, eventually settles down to a thin collar, good lacing.
S- Sweet aroma, lots of fruit, chocolate, not as much smoke or burnt malt as I expected, rounded out by sweet booze.
T- Very sweet overall. Has a decadent center of raisins, cherries and slightly spicy, warm alcohol. Finishes with a more pronounced charred malt with coffee and melted dark chocolate, lingering sweetness. Hop bitterness provides a nice base but is totally outclassed by the big, sweet malts on this beer.
M- Full-bodied, creamy, chewy, rich, coats the palate with a slightly syrupy, thick feel.
O- An impressive, forbidding beer with huge flavors. Definitely among the best of the Russian Imperial Stouts. 822 charactersWillCarrera, Jan 24, 2012

split with DC - sick zombie painted bottle, red wax. been waiting a while to crack this one. poured into a tulip, pitch black and heavy, nice khaki head sits on top and does fall until disturbed. the aroma is of a soft sweet milk chocolate, sweet molasses, roasted malt and is warming. the taste is just absolutely on point, follows the nose with some dark chocolates that are just take over by the molasses and sugars but not cloying also don't get any fruit and maybe a molecule of coffee bean. as sweet as this is i am really enjoying it, i feel like it is clean and not messy although sweet is usually not my thing this is a great tasting RIS. the body is full and slick. creamy and soothing on the palate. i could easily drink the whole bottle. overall i am very happy i got to try and share this. very well made and fresh this beer drinks like is has been aged for a year. the only knock for me is there is just not a "wow" factor which is completely fine. i did not find it overly sweet as i have heard throughout. i most likely will not be seeking this again unless it just falls into place. nonetheless a great RIS.

Pours dark black with a dark brown thin head that lasts nicely throughout. Aromatics of chocolate, figs, raisin, dark tart which is exactly what the flavor suggests. Flavor also picks up notes of coffee. Sticky mouthfeel. Puckering smooth RIS! 338 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 17, 2012

First taste was heavenly - tons of chocolate, fruit. I thought chocolate covered figs. Sticky sweetness overtook everything as I worked through each glass, however, and detracted quite a bit from the overall experience. Have some bottles aging in hopes that the sweetness gets a bit subdued. "Did you expect it to be that sweet" was the most common thing I overheard at DD this year. 507 charactersstealth, Jan 12, 2012

Thanks to my boy JR for sharing this bottle with me.
2011 vintage
Poured pitch black with 2 fingers of dark tan head. Pretty solid retention that slowly receded to a thin bubbly film... no lacing.
Very sweet aromas of dark fruits, berries, figs all covered in chocolate with a little bit of caramel and coffee to round it out. Smells heavenly. The aroma literally explodes out of the glass as it is being poured.
Taste follows the nose. Sweet sweet chocolate covered fruits and figs. Very slight coffee taste, perfectly roasted malt, and a little bit of caramel. Delicious and decadent.
Full bodied with a minimal amount of carbonation. Not extremely thick but it coats every inch of my mouth with each sip. Top notch mouthfeel.
This was an amazing stout. I loved every bit of it. This beer was just a power house without being over the top with anything. If this beer was a linebacker, it would be Brian Urlacher. Just a bad mother fucker and knows it but doesn't have to go around telling everyone how good he is. Top notch for sure. Big thanks again to JR for sharing this bottle. 1,242 charactersdcloeren, Jan 12, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had the 2011 vintage of Darkness in a nonic pint. 
Appearance- There is one-finger of smooth and dense, brown sugar - colored head. The retention is is really decent. It really does not want to die. Of course, the body is completely black.
Smell- The dark fruits are blasting out of the glass! This is a sweet nose, but it is anchored by the grassy and biting hops and slight alcohol burn. Roast also comes through after a little while. So much going on, and all of it fantastic. 
Taste- The drink goes even deeper than the nose hinted at. The front of the drink is slightly sweet with milk chocolate and the dark fruits, like currants. The middle of the drink has a little bit of roastiness and the sweet alcohol taste. Thankfully, it is not overpowering.
The finish is very chocolatey and incredibly hoppy. It is not what you would usually expect from an RIS, but it compliments the beer so well, it makes you wonder why every RIS does not finish like this. 
Mouth feel- This one has pretty decent coating, still a little watery. However, The body is pretty big and chewy, so it makes up for it.
Overall- The taste of this RIS is even better than the smell. And the hoppy character adds a nice little spin to the style. I would love to try this one aged for a year or two! 1,282 charactersPintofbrown, Jan 08, 2012

poured cold and black from the bottle to a 10oz surly darkness snifter with a full finger, small bubbled, frothy, mocha head leaving spotty, receding lace after each sip.
aroma of espresso, candied figs and dark fruits.
semi-sweet baking chocolate, creamy cappuccino, ripe dark fruits and a hint of smoke in the wayback. at the FFF XV party, i had this one on tap and i recall a fairly evident hops profile that i'm not getting from the bottle (?)
big bodied, medium carbonation, creamy smooth, hot.

Poured into a snifter this beer was a deep black with no light coming through at all. Only about half a finger of a deep brown head. Some slight alcohol legs on the glass. Really getting strong roast presence in the aroma with some anise, chocolate, and molasses in the smell. The taste on this one is great. I was actually surprised to get some hop bitterness on this over year old bottle still to add some balance I don't always get in these big stouts. Again hints of caramel, breakfast blend type coffee, chocolate malt, and dark molasses in the taste. This beer was nice and smooth with a solid level of carbonation that made it fairly easy to drink for such a big beer. This is a great beer from Surly and one that I will continue to seek out. 837 characterssmokeypeat, Jan 02, 2012

2011 vintage poured into a Surly Darkness snifter.
A: Pours a deep black with about one and one half fingers of mocha head. The foam settles nicely on the top of this beer, leaving a thin film of bubbles. Some decent lacing as it drinks.
S: Smells of raisins, plums, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, caramel, and a touch of vanilla. There is also an underlying earthiness to this beer.
T: The taste follows the nose really closely. I get the raisins, plums, chocolate, and caramel notes.
M: Full bodied beer. This beer is a seriously creamy. It has great mothfeel, but the finish is a bit cloying. There is a stickiness that lingers for a bit after drinking.
O: In all honesty, I'm not super impressed. There just seems to be something missing, and I can't put my finger on it. I sincerely remember last years version being better. I'm looking forward to seeing how this beer develops over time. 967 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jan 02, 2012

Black. Void of light. Pours with a dark brown finger of head. Smells of char, roast, chocolate and an intense coffee. Tastes more chocolaty. Still some charred notes and roasted notes. Slight hops on the finish. Body is full, creamy and luscious. Finish is so clean and smooth it's scary. 407 charactersEgadBananas, Jan 01, 2012

A: Beautiful inky black with one of the most dense heads I have ever seen. Lace is a timeline of pure savoring bliss.
S: Bitterness over dark fruit. Light pipe tobacco, alcohol, candi sugar, tamarind.
T: Yes. This is what beer is all about. While it drinks like an aged port it holds up the beer end with dark malt profile. So complex in flavor, I am sure a million descriptors are necessary. Raisin, rum, merlot grape, currant, leather, charcoal, dates and figs, coffee-like bitter, pumpernickel, sherry, a little hazelnut or pecan, molasses, cherry tobacco...I keep finding new elements here as the beer warms and airs out. 
M: Rich and lucious. Syrupiness isn't overbearing and carbonation is so tight that this is a physical pleasure to the palate as much as it is a (taste) sensory one.
D: Overall, easily the best of the style I've ever had. One of the best beers I have ever had. One of only a handful of brews I have ever had a guttural moan involuntarily emerge from my lips upon nearly every delicious sip. I don't give 5's easily, Surly has earned them. 1,185 charactersForWhatAlesYou, Dec 24, 2011

This review will be a combo of my two favorite years.
A: Single fingered head that exhibited solid retention that slowly reduced to a thin film leaving some lacing in its wake. As the name suggests, this brew is completely black.
S: The 10' still had a slight hop profile while the 09' was full of toffee and raison scents. Molasses follows on both and was fairly potent.
T: Similar to the scent, the 10' had some bitterness from the hops and was balanced well by the sweet molasses that followed. The 09' was sweet, not too sweet for a 6 or so ounce tasting, but I would definitely struggle drinking a whole bottle. As the scent indicated the flavor was primarily comprised of toffee and dark fruits. The alcohol was not detectable in any vintage.
M: Medium/heavy bodied, nice and creamy, well carbonated.
O: A fantastic brew from my home state brewery. I suggest others do a vert if they can, was surprising how much this brew changed over time. 1,107 characterstjkinate, Dec 22, 2011

T: Wonderful taste. Mild sweetness with notes of chocolate and anise.
M: A little bit thinner than I expected. Medium carbonation.

**This review largely reflects the 2011 Darkness, but I did try the 2012 Darkness as well and found it more hop-forward
A: Pours a two finger beautiful tan colour head of excellent cream, thickness, and retention (considering the ABV). Colour is a solid black. 
Sm: Brilliant mix of cream, coffee, chocolate, and nuts. A light strength aroma. 
T: Heavy (yet subtle) chocolate, coffee, and wonderful cream lacing. Rich and complex. The alcohol does come through unfortunately, which jabs into the otherwise well-executed balance. It's surprisingly hop-forward for the style. Dark malt and caramel heavy. It's quite well built, though I don't think its ABV is warranted. It'd be better at a lower ABV so the flavours could come out. I do quite enjoy it otherwise. 
Mf: Smooth, creamy, and wet, but too thick. More dryness and coarseness would be ideal; it feels more like a porter than a stout as is. 
Dr: Hard to drink due to the ABV (and more importantly, how obvious it makes itself), but the mouthfeel makes it slide down easily. I like its subtlety. It's pricey and hard to find, but I do like it. I don't know that it's worth seeking out like some other Russian imperial stouts.

2012 vintage bottle:
Aroma brings resins and pine, hitting the hops hard. Chocolate malts, dark malts.
Chewy with a chocolate/dark malt emphatic taste. Balance isn't terrific, but it's more hoppy than one would expect of a 4 year old imperial stout. Has some piney resins to counter the malts, but it isn't quite dialed in.
I do like it, and it's an enjoyable imperial stout, but it isn't amongst the tippy top beers in the style.

So with massive thanks to Jeffo and Doopiedoopiedoo I was able to taste the Surly Darkness, and not only that! They had assembled the 2011, 2010, 2009 and the 2008 version of it!!! What a fantastic surprise this was and still is to me.
So the scores above represent the highest score I gave for each separate beer. Below I will review them a all, one by one. 
We started with the 2011th version
A4 - The deepest red with a small beige head.
S4.5 - Oak, sweet, liquor, chocolate, vanilla and dark cherries.
T5 - Oak wood, chocolate sweetness and booze (so great).
M4.5 - Low to medium carbonation and what a full body.
O4.5 - A very solid RIS, what a balance!
Than the 2010 version was opened
A4.5 - Pitch black and a little beige foam ring.
S5 - Strong Chocolate and liquor smell. (so nice)
T5 - Chocolate, dark cherries and again some booze.
M5 - A soft carbonation and a light bitterness, it fits the style perfect.
O4.5 - What a great taste, unbelievable good.
Version 2009
A4.5 - A beige brown head on a pitch black beer.
S4 - A slight sour smell mixed with chocolate liquor. 
T5 - Chocolate, raisins and a bit to much wood, still perfect though.
M5 - A soft carbonation and so full in body.
O4.5 - The balance is just a tiny bit off, but who's complaining.
And last, but certainly not the least; version 2008
A4.5 - Again a beige brown head on a pitch black beer.
S4.5 - A sweet liquor chocolate.
T5 - Ginger bread, sweet vanilla liquor - excellent.
M5 - A soft carbonation that is so perfect for this type of beer.
O4.5 - Excellent brew, no doubt about it.
Again, thanks guys for searing this with me. 1,697 charactersMar02x, Dec 13, 2011

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a half finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, alcohol, and subtle vanilla. The flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, sweet alcohol, dark fruit, subtle vanilla, slight smoke, and very subtle molasses. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were quite complex and inviting. The booze was still present after all this time, but it was quite nice with the other notes in the flavor. I was really glad I got the chance to finally tick this one officially as I have only had very small samples in the past. A definite must try for any beer fan. 916 charactersthagr81us, Dec 10, 2011

I won't stick to the formt of beer reviews but still get my point acrdoss. It was very sweet at first but the finish semmed a bit more roasty, wich reallu balanced it out for me, Iam srill not sure of i like dthis beer or not after a fw 'buzzed" minutes to think abut it, I would give it B as a score. NOt bad but not anything to kill yorself tryin gto get. O'Malley! 524 charactersantoines15, Dec 08, 2011

A) Pours a jet black, light is not getting through this. Thin head, medium lacing.
S) Chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla and a bit of bourbon, very nice....
T) The semi-sweet chocolate in the dominant taste here, supplemented by the hint of bourbon and vanilla. What is intriguing is that the coffee notes are very muted. What makes this enjoyable is that it is not a sugar bomb like other highly rated RIS's....well balanced.
M) Lightly carbonated and smooth.
O) Well deserved of its rating this is deceptively drinkable! 571 charactersjimmy82063, Dec 07, 2011

A-Black as night with a thick tan head that laces and lingers throughout.
S-Malt bomb. Sweet raisins and molasses are the most noted flavors.
T-Sweet with heavy malt bill. Stout meets Quad.
M-Alcohol well hidden. Nice medium body that isn't too heavy or oily like some RIS.
D-These are not meant for slamming but drinkability is good for the style-maybe I could have 2 if in the right mood.
O-Not a huge RIS fan, but this one has very good taste while also being drinkable. Enjoy having this on tap, but not likely to buy too many $18 bottles of this or any other RIS. 619 charactersdeebo, Dec 05, 2011

Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter.
Aroma: Rich molasses, fudge brownie, and dry, roasty dark chocolate. A very mild herbal hop note chimes in. Also picking up some anise.
Appearance: Dark tan, 1 finger sudsy head. One of the most substantial collars of foam that I've seen on an imperial stout. Not a requirement, but definitely a nice touch! Leaves sudsy lacing behind. Oh--and the body of the beer matches the name--pitch black!
Flavor: Rich chocolate, molasses, and fruity grape notes up front. Fig and dark, candied fruits. A touch of smoke. More grape. A balanced bitterness at the end. 
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and chewy. Nice, fine, silky medium-high carbonation.
Overall: A delicious RIS--don't get me wrong--but fell just a tad bit shy in the complexity department. A solid 4, maybe even 4.5. Not sure how well this one was treated over the past year (shipping/storage conditions), which may have had an impact. Looking forward to trying another 2010 in the future, and also 2011! 1,094 charactersmdvatab, Dec 04, 2011

a- deep dark ruby brown with no light shining through. little khaki head quickly rises and falls
s- lots of roasted coffee and cocoa. hints of hops are there at the end as well
t- incredibly complex and delicious. coffee and chocolate with roasted malt and a light hop finish. really, really tasty
m- thick and coating on the mouth. very little carbonation is right on for the style. 
overall, a great complex imperial stout. im not certain it was worth the effort it took to get my hands on it, but it is certainly very good. glad I have a couple to age and see how good this can get. 734 characterscrewfan16, Dec 03, 2011

4.03/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Vintage 2011. Poured into a snifter. Well it's name is Darkness and its initial appearance is just that. Deep reaches of space black. Highlight are black with some black shadows. Head is a beautiful two fingers and cocoa colored and smooth and silky in appearance. Lace is sticky and spotted leopard pattern. Beautiful!!
Smell is at first a bit mellow but comes on with great dark roasted flavors of coffee and some silky milk chocolate. Maybe just a bit of char or wood and some tart cherries and maybe just a hint of alcohol.
Taste is much like the smell. The cherries come out more towards the front in the taste than in the nose. The dark roasted flavors of coffee, molasses, chocolate and charred wood are next. It finishes with some alcohol warmness. 
Mouth is velvety with creamy carbonation. Body is full to heavy and the finish is long and wet. 
Overall I enjoyed this. I have been looking forward to this day for quite some time. I received a bottle of 2010 earlier this year but waited until today to try the 2011 I received from TIMMYJ21 a month or two ago. I expected the world from this but it didn't quite match up. Still really excellent and solid Russian Imperial Stout. Very proud to have this as my 250th review. 1,235 charactersazdback, Dec 01, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage bottle. This one was allowed to warm a bit before being poured into my Brooklyn Brewery tulip.
Surly Darkness pours as pitch black as I'd expect. The cake-like caramel foam slowly builds itself up to nearly four fingers in height, threatening to spill out of the glass without ever actually doing so. Head retention is very good, but lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is pungent, and very enticing. The malt side of things is definitely tilted more towards dark chocolate, but is not without a bit of a coffee presence as well. There's also a fairly noticeable citrus aroma from the hops that fades in nicely behind the malts. As with the nose, rich dark chocolate forms the oundation for the flavor profile. A mild coffee flavor, as well as candied orange slices from the hops, also make their way here from the aroma. There's also a subtle minty note at the back end of each sip that really adds to the beer. The body is impressively rich and creamy, it drinks like it's 13-14% instead of just over 10%. At the same time, the carbonation is absolutely perfect. It's bubbly enough to allow the hops to be as prominent as I'm guessing they're intended to be, but it still lets the full bodied maltiness take center stage. I've been looking forward to trying Surly Darkness for a long while, and this is one beer that definitely lives up to the height. It's one of the best non barrel aged imperial stouts I've ever had. 1,433 charactersaxeman9182, Dec 01, 2011

Ar- chocolate, cherries, oak, molasses, figs/dates some other dark fruits
T- chocolate, raisins, dates, molasses, and coffee on the end. really gets awesome as it warms, the alcohol comes through as it warms too but not in a bad way.
M- thick bodied, alcohol warms your mouth after holding it for a while. good carbonation for this style.

4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4*review #500 for me!*
750mL bottle served into a snifter
*2010 vintage*
This thing isn't as black as one might think given the name "Darkness." It's Dr. Pepper-brown in color. A half finger of camel foam forms, settling quickly to a wisp of a ring. Lacing happens in Morse code-like dots and dashes. 
This beer, at this stage in its life, is a sweetness bomb on par with Dark Lord. Tons of sweet chocolate and truckloads of raisin provide the base for the beer. It's really, really raisiny. There's also this wild raspberry aroma here... not like the actual fruit but like the raspberry filling in a piece of Russel Stover's assorted chocolates. A little bit of smoke -- not roasty so much as ashy -- fills out some of the edges of the beer.
Holy dessert. Good God. Caramel sauce (not caramel malt but caramel sauce), browned pie crust, brown sugar, Starbucks Frappachino, more caramel, fudge, hazelnut, hot chocolate. This is such a sweet beer. Ghosts of the hop presence that this beer used to have results in some delicious Grand Marinier/orange reduction flavors. The finish has a slight & lingering hop bitterness. 
Oh, this mouthfeel is so appropriate given the sweetness of the flavor profile. This is thick stuff that feels weighty when swishing it around your moth, but not overwhelmingly, syrupy thick. You can actually feel some carbonation (which would make this a good option for pairing with rich desserts) too. It's nice and silky on the swallow.
Overall, I am not blown away by Darkness. Perhaps I would enjoy this beer more when fresh (considering how much I love fresh Goose Island Night Stalker)? What's here though, one year after this 2010 vintage was released, is a pretty delicious beer. It's not that complex; it's pretty much just sweetness. But it's a full-flavored, rich beer that is working pretty well for me right now as a celebratory beer. 1,877 charactersReaper16, Dec 01, 2011

A- A solid black wall o' stout. A brown head sits on top and isn't showing signs of leaving. Thick, spiderweb-like lacing all the way down the snifter.
S- Semi-sweet chocolate and rich spices. Good roasty malts come through as well as a slight whiff of alcohol.
T- Chocolate milk on steroids. Deliciously malty with a subtle hop spiciness. Dark fruits (black cherry?) bring up the rear. A sweetness comparable to molasses.
MF- Wow. About the same consistency as chocolate milk, too. Super creamy, low carbonation. Feels great. Did I say how creamy this is?
O/D- Really, really enjoying this. Alcohol is hidden much better in the taste than in the smell, making this drinkable with a subtle reminder. A real treat, I want this everyday. 761 charactersfdkayti, Nov 30, 2011

Very deep black in glass, maybe a hint of red around the edges. The head sat on the glass and stayed there, with lots of lacing as you drink. What a great aroma! Spice and citrus from the hops are detectable with chocolate and toasted, roasted malt. Luckily, it tastes as good as it smells, like a mixture and milk and dark chocolate and some roast graininess. Bitter on the back of the throat the way a good cup of coffee is. Roll this one around in the mouth and you get a smooth almost creamy texture without a lot of carbonation. 
Overall, a very good RIS. I'd like to sample it in a year and see how well it's aged. 701 charactersbschinelli, Nov 29, 2011

A - Standard RIS affair here. Deepest brown/black coloring. The head stands out a bit here, especially for the small sampling size. Good retention of a light khaki head. Tons of bubbles cling to the edges for the duration of this drink. 
S - Definitely hoppy, but more so this exhibits a great blend of spices, milk chocolate bar, and lesser roasted notes. 
T - More of the same. Nice balance. Dark and milk chocolate sweetness at the front lead into subtle bitter hops with just a touch of espresso. 
M - Great dryness for the style with nice lingering finish and aftertaste. Oddly, it seems much less carbonated than it looked like it would be. Velvety-smooth with a medium-heavy body. Need a 4.75 rating here. 
D - The hops aren't a bomb here, which I like. It's far more balanced than I expected and already well-developed. My sample wasn't nearly enough. 1,067 charactersAuracom, Nov 27, 2011

A: Black as night. Pours a generous amount of dark tan head with the retention of a champ. Coats my glass with plenty of lace.
S: Dark, roasted malts; chocolate; booze; molasses; some toffee notes too.
T: Smooth and resilient start to finish. Tons of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate at every turn. Hints of dark fruits in the middle, then boozy warmth as you swallow. On the sweeter side of the spectrum, but not as sweet as Dark Lord. This isn't a super complex stout like DL or Black Tuesday; instead, Surly focuses on one flavor profile and nails it. Reminds me of Zhukov.
M/D: Its full, smooth body pairs well with the soft carbonation, delivering creamy deliciousness to my palate. I could drink this baby all night long.

A little citrus becomes apparent as the beer layers on the mid-palate, as does some faint cocoa. Burnt chocolate flavors come through a few sips into the beer. A little cherry halfway through the glass too. Finishes with sweet raisin, very dark unsweetened chocolate and a little charcoal. Absolutely delicious! 4.75/5
Mouthfeel:Full-bodied and viscous. A little oily and chewy. Has a very sweet and slightly sticky finish. Despite all the sugary-sweet descriptors, the beer does not overwhelm the palate with sweetness. 10.3% ABV is absolutely hidden. 4.75/5
Overall: An instant classic! Delicious, well rounded and delivering on the hype. It's a little sweet, but nowhere near Dark Lord sweet.
Recommendation: An absolutely great beer that must be tried by everyone.
Pairings: My Neurosis burger at Kuma's Corner went GREAT with this one. Hamburgers, steak and caramelized onions are the food pairing to beat.
Cost: $10 for a pint, $20 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle. 1,715 charactersjegross2, Nov 27, 2011

750 mL bottle, 2011 zombie, poured into a Tulip glass
A- Black as night with a small tan head that just sits there, great lacing.
S- Sweet chocolate, dark fruits, hint of cherries, some roasted malts, and a touch of hops, overall very sweet smelling.
T- Starts out sweet milk chocolate, getting hint of roasted malts, dark fruits, hint of hops, cherries in the finish, and just a touch of alcohol, but does not seem like 10.3%. Well balanced and a nice level of complexity
M- Smooth, creamy, full body.
O- This is a great beer I am very happy that I sought this one out. This is an easy drinking, sweet stout. I would love to get another to see what aging would do it. 704 characterslarryi86, Nov 27, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42011 version, on tap:
Pours a really opaque dark color with a light brown head with great retention and lacing.
Aroma is of dark malts, mollasses, some coffee, vanilla and chocolate.
Taste somehow follows the aroma with a very "dark malt" profile, with dark fruits, vanilla, coffee and bitter chocolate.
Body is heavy with a silky and smooth mouthfeel at first, with mild tart and astringent dark malt notes later on. Aftertaste is a little hop bitter.
Overall a very good RIS from surly. Not the most complex beer within the style but a great beer nonetheless. 566 characterspaulozanello, Nov 27, 2011

3.88/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 vintage, cellared since release. Poured into my Delirium Tremens snifter, Darkness is dark, thick, with a dark tan head leaving lots of lace. 
Smell is on the sweet, malty side. 
Taste is fairly sweet malt, chocolate, modest roast, nice hop bitterness as well as still some spicy, herbal hop flavor. Obviously way dialed down compared to how it is fresh, better integration by now. 
Mouthfeel is pretty silky, on the thick side. 
Drinkability is fine. It's a well made RIS. Certainly not worth any great expense or hassle to acquire though. I traded mine with a local for some limited release HOTD, dollar for dollar, which was fair. 642 charactersccrida, Nov 26, 2011

Very dark brown-- looks black until backlit, then deep reddish hues make a triumphant and glorious appearance. 
Wow, this is MUCH better than the bottles we opened up about this time last year of the 2010 vintage! I think I have notes from that review in which I would have given it a C- at best! This is quite different indeed;
Notes of chocolate malt turn into fudge/brownie batter as the beer warms... Some caramel malt provide a little depth and sweetness up front. A touch of anise creeps up in the dry boozy finish.
Feel is thick and viscous, oily and creamy, firm and full. 
Overall-- this is a quite an enjoyable little beer to sip with turkey in my belly and football on tv. Niiice. 747 charactersAleWatcher, Nov 24, 2011

After all of the arguing about which is better between dark lord and darkness, I was expecting it to look thicker. Black in color, but thin. Nice nose, lots of malt, roasts and chocolate. Taste was sweet, coffee, loads of chocolate jumped out at me. Bitter taste as well. Mouthfeel was thin. It coated the mouth, but it was very thin. Also, the flavors really didn't linger. Overall, this was a very tasty beer that I would drink again in a heartbeat, however IMO there is absolutely no debate on which is better between this and DL. 633 characters1Adam12, Nov 24, 2011

I was lucky enough to have one on draft @ FFF 15 anniversay party as well as to score one at Map Room in Chicago.
I am new to the Imperial Russian Stout Game, but I know what I like. Big coffee notes up front, kinda like a double brewed slightly sweetend cup of joe. Then that mocha sneaks up on you. These flavors do a great job of hinding the alcohol, especially when you let it warm up to room temp. I love looking at the rim this beer leaves behind in the glass, it reminds you of what was once there.
It's such a complex beer, but any fan of the the Russian Imperial can truely appreciate the craft that went into Darkness. 649 charactersiceboi15, Nov 23, 2011

A: Black as night. A three quarter finger dark brown head appears and just as quickly fades to a quarter finger head. Decent lacing down the sides. Good.
S: Dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, and an assertive hop profile in the bouquet. Has a barleywine-esque quality. Lingering in the background is a very pleasing dark fruit scent. Expands and softens as it warms. Chocolate and dark fruit become more apparent and the hops take a step back. Nice.
T: Lots of chocolate and some light coffee roast. Sweet and creamy. Warm dark fruit on the mid and finish. An assertive hop presence for the style, but it never dominates. Would be interested to see where this went with a year of age on it. A little bit of heat, but not offensive. This tastes infinitely better as it warms up...the fruits start to come foward, the hops take a step back. Wow, this is damn fine.
M: Really excellent. Carbonation is perfect. Darkness is a full and viscous beer, coating the sides of my palate with its creamy, fruity deliciousness. Flavors are very well balanced. If I have one nit, it's that the hops stick out a little too much for the style. But I imagine that would settle with some age. It's a minor complaint, though, when faced with the wonderful integration of flavors that is Surly Darkness.
O: The smell on this was misleading...I was expecting a dry-ish, hoppy stout. Instead I got a full-flavored, chocolatey, fruity beast of a brew. Good for me. It's complex, creamy, and smooth. One of my favorite qualities in an imperial stout is the ability to bring dark fruit into the flavor profile and Darkness is one of the best I have found in that regard. I think this beer could only benefit from 6-12 months in the cellar, but it certainly drinks quite well now. Excellent job, Surly. 1,852 characterssiege06nd, Nov 20, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a 16oz Tulip Glass. After a year of waiting, I was finally able to get my hands on a bottle of Darkness.
Appearance - True to it's name, it pours a pitch black color with the brownest and one of the fluffiest heads I have ever seen. Head is about 3 fingers thick and leaves behind alot of lacing.
Smell - Very rich chocolate smell with butterscotch, rum and toffee. Very healthy burnt malt smell adds more to the aroma along with a slight coffee smell. I don't think I've ever enjoyed the smell of a beer this much!
Taste - I've had beers with chocolate before, but this is by far the most chocolatest beer I've ever had! Rich flavorful chocolate mixed in with very strong caramel and scotch/rum flavors. The burnt malts are also very noticeable which helps add more to the flavor. Amazingly enough, the alcohol taste is masked so well that you can't even tell there is any in here!
Mouthfeel - Body is very thick and heavy, but it's also a very smooth beer to drink. The fact there's virtually no carbonation in this beer also helps it out alot.
Overall - Holy crap, I loved this beer! It was worth being put on the second tier waiting list in order to purchase it. It's a shame this isn't a year round beer because I know this would be a huge seller. Those who are looking for the one of the best Imperial Stouts around need look no further. With it's rich flavor and smoothness, Darkness is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts around! 1,458 charactersNuclearDolphin, Nov 19, 2011

07 - this tasted like a different beer entirely from the others. Very dark and viscous, small hint of roast and bitterness in the nose, with a unanticipated smoothness betweeen all the flavors. A very accomplished balance of flavors.
08 - this was my second favorite of the night. Still a hop presence, with more of a chocolate sweetness which lent its hand to a taste of bitterness. The roast was present, just not over the top.
09 - my favorite bottle. Hop presence grew, this one had more of a spice to it, still present was the chocolate and malt sweetness, with a slight hint of roast.
10 - my favorite. I am a hop head at heart. This one had an aazing hop presence considering its age. A little sweeter than the older vintages, but not over sweet. Has obtained a great balance. Roast not as present.
11 - sampled this beer after having it multiple times over the weekend. Very tasty, I am waiting to have a bottle with just a bit of age on it. Tasted a little too sweet at such a young age, but the complexity of the beer was present. Made me extremely happpy I have several put away to enjoy later. 1,310 charactersbiglobo8971, Nov 17, 2011

Appearance: Midnight black on color. Pours a rather aggressive, two finger, dark brown head. Pretty good retention.
Aroma: The citrusy, juicy hops take the forefront on the aroma. After the initial hop burst, roasted coffee and chocolate fudge notes take hold. Some underlying caramel and only a touch of booze. A lot going on here.
Taste: Chocolate fudge, caramel and dark fruit notes take hold upfront. The hop notes are much lighter here than in the aroma, but provide a nice bitterness and some juiciness. Some light coffee is there as well. Really complex and tasty. Nice balance of roast and sweetness. Nicely balanced.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy with a nice level of carbonation. Very smooth.
Overall, a really exceptional RIS with great balance and complex malt tones. The combination of the dark fruit, chocolate fudge and coffee makes for a great stout. One of the best, if not the best, non barrel aged stouts around. Tons of flavor, well balanced and not too boozy. 1,142 charactersGosox8787, Nov 15, 2011

A - very dark. plenty of head. looked oily and fantastic
S - lots of chocolate, some coffee. Definitely some bourbon, no alcohol smell.
T - delicious. makes you want more. not overly complex. wish it had more flavor actually. perhaps it is too cold.
M - thick but not too viscous and moderately carbonated.
O - Very very good. Liked it a lot but did not think it was as complex/fun to drink as others in the same field (parabola, etc.)
UPDATE - Group review from second tasting.
Darkness – on tap at the Map Room. 10oz poured into a snifter. (thanks to the bartender for pouring us more like 12-14oz ☺)
A – Black motor oil. Love the look. Very excited. Head grabs the side of the glass with a death grip.
S – Subtle smokiness taps me first. Hmm maybe not smoky, but a roasted smell. Almost like a cherry or Maplewood. This is followed by cocoa. Really nice smell.
T – It’s like eating chocolate in front of the fireplace. After chocolate comes a touch of alcohol followed by the roasted woody taste you’d expect from the smell. It ends sweet, chocolaty. Like eating chocolate. Yum.
M – So thick. Coats the mouth beautifully. Decent amount of carbonation. Chewy, almost syrupy.
O – This is very well balanced. Really really good. I’m not one who loves indulging in straight chocolate, but this hits the spot for me. 1,405 charactersdlello2, Nov 15, 2011

Pours black and dense, with a big, thick, coffee-colored head. Looks like old engine oil.
Smell is a little bit hoppy, heavy on the fruits and chocolate. Cherries and plums and raisins and chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Like a box of designer chocolates.
My favorite non-barrel-aged stouts have incredibly rich and varied flavor. This has exactly that. Sweet, but balanced by hops that tend to fade with age, making this 2-year-old bottle a lot more malt-forward. Chocolate, cherries. Rich. Raisins, plums, figs. All these different deep fruity flavors. Fantastic.
Feel is so thick and chewy, but with carbonation that's almost foamy.
A fantastic imperial stout. Really sweet and rich, but balanced enough for me. And all the elements work together so so well. 861 characterszeledonia, Nov 14, 2011

4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I tried Darkness for the first time last night. I managed to score one bottle from the 2011 batch at my local liquor store. I had never understood what drove people to literally camp out in the Surly parking lot the night before the annual "Day of Darkness" release event to make sure they got a bottle, especially given the $17.99 price tag. Now I know. I found Darkness exceptional. The beer was deep brown to black in color, with a small, brown, frothy head. The initial taste clearly identified the beer as a stout. However, a deep, complex, malty sweetness quickly took over. There is a lot going on in this beer! I discovered new characteristics and levels of taste with each sip (chocolate, caramel, cream, coffee, smoke, vanilla). I am not a big stout drinker, but this beer really got my attention. I think it is one of those beers that transcends style. I am not sure I liked it enough to sleep in the Surly parking lot. Short of that, however, I will go out of my way to find more bottles in the future. 1,014 charactersflip69, Nov 14, 2011

A: Lives up to the moniker, this is a very dark beer, practically black with a tan head that bubbles up to about an inch and falls back away to a light cap that doesn't want to disappear. Lot of small spots of lacing are left behind as it recedes. 
S: Surprising amount of hops in here, a bit of a citrus note, then a huge chocolate, almost hot cocoa aroma hits the nose. Underneath the chocolate is a fair amount of roasted barley, coffee, and a touch of molasses. I also get some over ripe cherries and plums in there. 
T: Huge chocolate notes, caramel, toffee, and a ton of dark fruits as well, think plums and cherries that are almost passed their prime. A lot of coffee in here as well. Nice bitterness on the finish to round out a lot of sweetness in the beer. A touch of booze finds its way in here as well. A fair amount of hop resins linger for quite a while. Long lingering finish reminiscent of sweet red wine, and dark fruits. Really a fine stout. 
M: Nice body, perfect amount of viscosity and enough carbonation to make it velvety and rich, without being over carbonated. Quite sticky on the lips. Just about perfect. 
O: A really nice stout, easily one of the most enjoyable beers I've had in some time. I would like a little bit more of roasted barley/coffee note though, that would set it over the top. I like the amount of dark fruit and hops in here. I don't know what this will do with age, but thankfully I have a bottle to sit on for a while, however, it is about perfect right now. 
Thanks Levi! 1,596 characterspokesbeerdude, Nov 12, 2011

This looks and smells . . . amazing! I don't even want to drink it. Perfectly toasted-to-lightly-burnt malts; let me be clear, this is the finest iteration of this characteristic I have ever encountered. Obvious bit of coffee/cocoa to go along and a small encounter of mingling dark berries/cherries. 
But holy crap, this is unbelievable! Best mouthfeel ever. Perfect blend of velvet and viscous. Unbelievably creamy. I don't think the style could get better than this. Tastes like . . . wow. Just perfected; sweet, dark, whipped butter, licorice, malt . . . ohhh the malt. The malt. 
I've got nothing left to say. I was lucky to get this from a friend in Minnesota. Haven't had better, can't really imagine better either. The only drawback might be the drinkability. I don't think I could have more than a bomber, maybe less . . . but that's not what I want from this style anyhow. I'll say it again: amazing! 926 charactersCheezyBlaster, Nov 09, 2011

The smell is dark fruit, licorice, alcohol and a note of wet leather.
The taste is has notes of coffee, dark fruit and licorice. There is a deep sweetness and a warming sense from the alcohol in this beer. 
Mouthfeel is light-medium weight, but coating and and leaves a warming aftertaste.
Overall this beer is pretty good. I saw it at a local bottle shop and never having vertured to "Darkness Day" at the brewery, I thought I'd find out what the hype was all about. I was not disappointed. 609 charactersslyke, Nov 08, 2011

This is a beautiful stout, looks thick and black as it is poured with some espresso-like crema for head with ultra tight bead. The aromas of brownie batter and baker's cocoa's semi-bitter/semi-sweet scents with mild dark fruit from the yeast which is plummy. The stout has a light sweet hop odor with more berry tinge with the dark toasted malt nose as it is swirled. The feel is rich, viscous, sweet fruit and little drying as it is moved around the mouth. The mellow spiciness of this gives some complexity and the texture is generally creamy with a pretty mild alcohol influence. 
 Darkness has a taste of bitter cocoa which is familiar for Russian imperial because it has a lightly bitter nutty taste up front with some astringent coffee-like dark mallt elements and raisiny dried fruit aspect. There is a earthy woody and almost light anise taste which comes forward as it warms with mild burnt malt quality as it finishes. This is an extremely drinkable beer for the abv, I found myself having to regulate my gulps and respect the big stout for what it is. I enjoyed how easy it goes down with an almost burnt marshmallow-like caramel essence that bring out a bit of concentrated dark sugar flavor. I was extremely appreciative to Brad for sharing this with us a stout worth savoring 1,383 charactersSlatetank, Nov 06, 2011
3.86/5  rDev -12.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 Version, Gold Wax and a fucking VAMPIRE on the front.
I really do think the appearance of the actual beer is amazing, but I love that label art. The beer itself pulls a pitch black into the glass and lets NO light through. Darkness is right. Head retention is decent, leaves a perfect lacing behind.
Smell is booze, licorice, faint coffee, booze, roast, a light milk chocolate, and booze.
Taste is heavy handed on the licorice with chocolate and booze providing backup. I can't say it's not good, but I just don't get as much out of this as I thought I would. Definitely thankful to get a bottle either way though. There may have been hops here at one point which would make everything that much more interesting, but they're gone now for sure.
Overall a good beer but not as great as expected. Maybe it's meant to be had fresh at which point I'll alter the review but for now the only thing legendary about this beer is the label. 940 charactersNashvillain, Nov 06, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from 750 ml bottle into a Surly Darkness chalice glass. 2011 bottle with a great looking zombie label. BRAAIIINS! 
Appearance: Pours very dark and black with only a slight tint of dark brown. Decent three finger deep tan head that settles into a thin patchy layer. Decent amount of lacing on the glass. 
Smell: Very rich and darkly sweet. Dark roasted caramel malts with toffee. Big aroma of dark chocolate. A pretty bold presence of dark fruits with raisins and dark cherries. Has some notes of coffee and oak chips lingering around. Also some hints of grassy hops underneath the sweetness. Smells great. 
Taste: Just as dark and tasty as the smell leads. Big taste of dark chocolate with dark toasted caramel and toffee malts. Solid presence of coffee and a strong kick of dark fruit sweetness from raisins and dark cherries. Has a hint of oak chips. Finishes with a solid presence of grassy hops adding some balance to the sweetness. Everything comes together perfectly. This is quite delicious. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very roasty, thick, and creamy. A little heat is felt but this is pretty smooth. 
Overall: An incredible Russian Imperial Stout. Very robust, complex, and tasty. A perfect blend of sweetness and bitterness. Well worth the hype. This is heaven.... or better yet hell in a bottle. :) 1,354 charactersMattyG85, Nov 06, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a Sam Adams pint. 2011 version.
A: Pours a nearly opaque, very dark brown color with one finger of dark khaki head. Good retention and lace. I swear the last drops from the bottle were blood red, but maybe that was my imagination....
S: Vinous, heady chocolate and dark fruits. Very rich.
T: Leads with smooth, semi-sweet chocolate. Also some sweet dark fruit. It's a tad too boozy, not a major flaw, but aging would be a plus. Long, lingering finish has a bit of coffee bitterness. As the beer warms, the coffee starts to emerge mid sip. The sweetness is just right-- far from cloying but always present.
M: Nice and full, quite smooth, creamy and downright sensual.
O: Enjoyed this very much. Wish I had another bottle to age for a year, but very grateful to Kevin for hunting this down and bringing one back from Minny. Will need to make the trip myself next year just for the second bottle.
Notes:
1. The red wax (?) ornament on the cap is a bear to remove. But it does look pretty.
2. Had intended to enjoy this on International Stout Day, but changed my mind. However, having this on Guy Fawkes Day somehow works as well. 1,161 charactersAmericanGothic, Nov 06, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A long time coming on this one, fortunate to get 2 bottles from Four Firkins. One is being saved for a rainy day in 2013, the other to drink post-haste.
The pour is darker than a Spinal Tap album cover, with a substantial, sticky ocean-scum head that just goes and goes. 
Smell...ooh la la, a lot going on here, but raisins, cherries, malt, and oats come to the fore. Goddamn.
If anything, the taste runs to the excessive, so much malt, fruit, boozy backdrop. Absolutely delicious. Why not a 5.0 for taste? Because it's almost too much, completely hit over the head with flavor.
Mouthfeel is perfect a thick, glossy sludge of a beer that doesn't coat the tongue too badly.
Awesome beer. Totally awesome. Glad I was able to get my hands on it. 747 characterslurpy1, Nov 03, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42011 Darkness (Zombie label) poured from tap into a standard clear pint glass at The Bulldog Northeast in Minneapolis.
Appearance: As the name suggests, this beer pours a deep opaque brown color (looks black), darkness indeed. Pours with a one finger tan foam head that receded quickly and left some nice sticky lacing.
Smell: Sweet and malty with caramel and toffee notes mixed with coffee and cream. Some slight earthy wet grass hops aroma underneath.
Taste: Exceptionally smooth and sweet. Dark roasted malts provide a good sweet coffee and cream flavor, with some good caramel and slight toffee notes. A slight earthy hops flavor is detected. Also flavors of dark fruits, like black cherries and prunes, mixed with a little black licorice. Very flavorful and complex. Flavors opened up a bit as it warmed in the glass. 
Mouth Feel: Medium to full bodied and a creamy carbonation that works well with the style (would love to try this one with a creamy nitro tap).
Overall: An outstanding Porter! I can see what all the hype is about and why this is such a sought after brew. It is perfection for a stout. At 10.3% ABV it's definitely a sipping beer, and a great choice for a good fall or winter warmer. Will look for this again in the future, in bottle or on tap...any way I can get it! 1,295 charactersChopperSmith, Nov 01, 2011

2010 vintage with the vampire artwork.
Pours an opaque black with a 3 inch puffy dark khaki head that settles to a dense small cap. A latticework of lace lines the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, cocoa powder, and an alcohol aroma. Taste is of dark roasted malt, slightly sour dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate, and some roasted coffee bean flavors. A mild roasty bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip. There is a bit of a soy sauce quality in both the smell and taste but it's not at all unpleasant. This beer has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a very good RIS that deserves its status as a highly acclaimed beer. I am very happy I finally was able to snag one of these. 826 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 31, 2011

S - Very bready, pumpernickel like. Slight hunt of burnt toast. Good amount of chocolate coming in.
T - Alot of chocolate, followed by roast and lactose sweetness. Sweetness could be confused with dark Karo syrup.
M - Very creamy and cloying. No agressiveness to break up the sweetness.
O - Great brew. Stands up to its competition of Darklord and Sexual Chocolate, but does not destroy them. 492 charactersRocPorterFanatic, Oct 30, 2011

2010 Edition
A: Pours a deel brown red, in the glass it is black as night. A very deep brown fluffy head perches on top. The head is thick and creamy. 
S: The smell is bready in a way that makes me think that an English yeast strain was used. Dark chocolate, dominates the nose. Sweet, but not overpoweringly so. 
T: Sweet, malty, and delicious. There is a lot of dark chocolate, and a touch of bitterness in the finish that balances it out. This has got the feel like they just effortlessly made it one day. Tasty.
M: Thick and creamy, carbonation is just right.
O: Overall this is an excellent example of the style. Dark and rich with nice residual sweetness, and a robust dark chocolate component. 753 charactersBeejay, Oct 30, 2011

Awesome huge head, thick frothy and creamy, dark head, forms layers as I pour between glasses, pitch black thick beer with nice legs, tons of lacing. essentially the perfect head.
Nose brings lots of chocolate, bakers, dark, cocoa nibs, bit of roast and coffee, lots of vanilla, bit of caramel, lots of dark malts bit of bitter roast and earthy hops.
Taste starts a bit of soy sauce, lots of bitter roasted malts, coffee, syrupy, big and heavy, roasty, some light oats, slightly briny, lots of vanilla, caramel, molasses, slight booze, bitter astringent roasted malts and bit of earthy hop. Slight charred roasted malt. Finishes quite bitter, astringent, sticky and syrupy, syrupy malts, soy sauce and a bit of earthy hop bitterness.
Mouth is big bodied but not quite as big as I expected, a bit syrupy, decent carb for the style.
Overall good, but not quite what I expected. Too much bitter briny roasty astringent soy sauce flavors, big and heavy as it should, but not quite as drinkable. Reminds me of fresh Dark Lord, but this has a year of aging on it. I'll let the rest age more and hopefully the soy sauce and briny qualities settle down. 1,253 charactersjlindros, Oct 29, 2011
4.43/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage on-tap, poured into a tulip.
A- deep, opaque black with a tan, one-half finger head.
S- raisins, dark chocolate, plums, and a hint of espresso.
T- dried fruit is present from the start and remains to the finish. Dark chocolate and a faint espresso come in at the middle with the chocolate remaining through the finish.
M- Viscous, short of a motor oil-feel, but thick nonetheless. A slight carbonation presence accompanies the thickness.
O- awesome. Previous years have gotten much better with age, though. I had the privilege of doing a side-by-side of 2010 and 2011 before Darkness Day and the 2010 blew the 2011 out of the water, IMO. 655 charactersUngertaker, Oct 27, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served on tap at the Republic. First time having it fresh and on tap. 
A - pours black as night with a nice 1.5 finger chocolate mo ha head that retreats quickly. 
S - The nose is pretty faint on it, but what I get is a lot of chocolate with some toffee and vanilla in the mix. It smells pretty hoppy as well with some. It the malts. 
T - starts off with a lot of sweet milk chocolate and some vanilla upfront. These fade to some cola like flavors and some oakiness (I know this wasn't barrel aged but it tastes like something is in there). There is also some bitter candied fruits and spicy tobacco. Ends with a blast of bright, citrus hops that are muddled with dark chocolate and toffee booziness. This is still a little rough around the edges, but I like it that way as you can pick out more of the flavors and make this a bit more complex. 
M - mouthfeel is a little watery yet full bodied and a little chewy. 
D - I was pumped to see this one on tap as I haven't come close to trying it on tap before. This is more complex than I remembered it being last year but like I said it seems a bit rough now. I think time will do this one well and help calm this one down a bit. Definitely worth seeking out if you like big, complex stouts. 1,244 charactersbirchstick, Oct 26, 2011

Aroma- Tons of espresso, malt, and booze hit the nose. Strong and appropriate! Very complexed though... Alot of the aromas I couldn't pick out. No cherries like the Bourbon, Oaked version. 
Appearance- Received with a .5 finger head that was dark brown. Died very quickly. Has a deep opaque and jet black color body. Light lacing is left on the sides of the glass with dark brown suds. 
Flavor- Sweet taste! Roasty and has a ton flavor as well. The hop flavor is higher in this one and can tell the grains and malts make a light chocolate taste come around at the finish. Not much booze but still evident. 
Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Light Carbonation, Nice texture (from how viscous it is), and leaves sweetness and light booze. A bit lighter than the other version but perfect! 
Overall Impression- As it did warm up a bit for me, I should have waited longer for my first tasting of this... The Bourbon Oaked Darkness kicked this ones ass! Too bad it was only on-cask the day of the event. The darkness with still awesome and had a great amount of richness and booze to it, but not as powerful as their bourbon, oaked cask. I'm excited to see what this bottle does in a year or so!! 1,397 charactersDCon, Oct 25, 2011

 The nose is very nice, smell is smooth if that makes sense.
 first sip is awesome, just as u would expect from these pro's. Nice, smooth not overpowering ; cocoa, plum a little booziness, definitely not a bad or overpowering booze taste.
Mouthfeel is very good, smoothly flowing over the tastebuds.

The beer pours a a deep dark black with a very dark frothy head, nothing see through about this beer. The smell is of coffe, chocolate roast, and some hops.

Pours black with a nice brownish head. Looks really nice. The smell is dark chocolate, coffee, molasses. Yum. The taste is very dark roasted coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. There is a source of bitterness here (hops?) that provide a nice balance. Over time, this beer gets a bit sweeter as they fade a touch. Really comes together nicely. The body is big and smooth, with lower carbonation - mouthfeel is dead on. A really delicious beer. No alcohol, good balance and yet decadent. One of the best few of the hyped yearly released stouts. 592 charactersseeswo, Oct 23, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +12%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52008 Vintage poured into a snifter.
Pours an absolutely beautiful jet black with a nice 2/3 finger tan lace. The head quickly dissipated to a nice lacing. In a perfect world the head would have stayed around a little bit longer, but oh well. The smell was a combination of toasted coffee, alcohol and bourbon. This combination jumped out of the bottle as soon as I opened. A wonderful smelling beer that certainly got my anticipation up for the actual tasting. A great tasting beer that was exactly what the smell said it would be. 
I have held on to this beer for over 3 years and I finally decided 'what the hell' and opened it. This is probably one of the top 3 or 4 beers that I have had the pleasure of trying. 717 characterscbros, Oct 21, 2011

2010 Vintage
Much appreciation to PDXHops for the chance to try this critter
Scorched brown whilst being poured; not quite crimson brown. Pitch black in the glass. Massive two and a half finger head of layered shades of brown foam; it's like sedimentary layers, or something. The head eventually drops to a big patch of tightly grouped bubbles. I was planning on using my trusty E&J for the appearance score, since it usually holds better lace than the snifter. It isn't necessary here; there is a copious amount of lace for the style, starting where the head crested and crackling its way down. 
Honestly, I don't think Darkness could look any better.
The aroma is gargantuan. Simply all-encompassing and intense. Layers of dark, burnt sugars and malts are blanketed by vinous and dark fruit notes. Tangy, roasted notions meander about, as well. Aromatic tones of port, prune, molasses, burnt chocolate and cocoa. This certainly smells on the sweet order of the RIS style. As it starts to warm, burnt chocolate emerges as the predominant factor in terms of sweetness. Subtle hints of toffee and, to a lesser extent, caramel.
One sip in and I'm ready to draw the conclusion that Darkness succeeds because it is bold and sweet, but remains free of the disgustingly sugar-addled sweetness to which some imperial stouts fall victim.
Burnt and roasted chocolate flavors wash over the tongue and, before they can subside, are joined by a rather sturdy hoppiness. The hops seem earthy and add a modest kick and subtle bitterness; really rounds out the flavors without going overboard. In all actuality, the hops provide a welcomed dry counterpoint to the otherwise sweet flavor profile. I mean, when you're cranking a bunch of burnt sugars a la chocolate and molasses, and a large spot of prune and dark fruits, what's wrong with some balance, huh? Heck, there even seems to be a dusting of cocoa and the most faintest notion of coffee beans on the finish.
The feel finds as much attention given it as does the flavor profile. For sure, this is full bodied and reasonably viscous but it stands aback of the sludgy and plodding. The feel is smooth, though simultaneously accented by modest, puffy carbonation that further tames over time. The finish boasts hefty residuals that linger long.
Ultimately, Darkness is pushing my threshold for sweetness in Imperial Stouts. That said, this is how you do sweet without it becoming a problem. My personal preferences for dry, roasty and ashy stouts aside, this is a well-constructed and really good.
And another thing. It sure is nice to see a proper vampire on the label. Old dude is a fairly menacing looking sort. Now, he's no Nosferatu; that's one supremely creepy vampire. But an angry, red countenance and vapid, white eyes? Yeah, that's a proper vampire. None of that team glitter and team other guy bullshit. 2,927 charactersRyan011235, Oct 19, 2011

A- Thick, syrupy totally opaque pour. Three finger dense foamy milk chocolate colored head. Very slowly recedes to finger width cap. Lacing is remarkable.
S- Roasted coffee, figs, bakers chocolate, molasses, brown sugar and subtle vanilla. 
T- Milk chocolate, bitter roasted coffee, vanilla and molasses. Slight woody notes. Very smooth, very balanced.
M- This is a meal... And the light carbonation make it feel even heavier. It's silky, smooth and creamy. Probably the best feeling stout I've had yet.
O- This is supposed to be up there in stouts and does not disappoint. The tastes meld together in perfect harmony, it feels remarkable and the alcohol is invisible. The people that can attend darkness day are lucky sob's!
Thanks for this experience! 824 characterskorguy123, Oct 03, 2011

A: Pours very dark, nearly black. A forceful pour yields two fingers worth of dark mocha colored head. Retention is strong. Leaves a little bit of lace. Very imposing appearance. No light getting through whatsoever.
S: Deep, rich scents. Dark fruit. Raisins, figs, plum, and red grapes. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Intense aromas.
T: Big and bold. Milk chocolate. Sweet coffee and cream. Lovely roasted flavors. Over-ripe fruits. Hops come through late and balance all the sweet flavors with a little bitterness. No discernible heat despite the abv. Quite complex.
M: Full bodied. Viscous and coating. Smooth as silk. Perfect.
O: Tremendous. Age was very kind to this one. I had high expectations and the were met, if not exceeded. This is an amazing beer that I would recommend trying at least once.

2008 vintage poured into a sniffer, another BIG thanks to Dajtai007 for sharing this one. 
Appearance: Just as the name describes, Darkness, it pours a pitch black inky looking beer with a dark brown head about a centimeter thick that fades into a ring around the glass. 
Aroma: Dark chocolate, vanilla, spicy notes, licorice and dark fruits, wonderful aroma, complex and not jumbled together.
Taste: Just like the aroma wonderfully complex, dark chocolate, dark fruit, prunes, molassas, coffee and roasted grains. 
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth with minimal carbonation and a thick body, a sipper, yet still easy and pleasant to drink. 
Overall: Time has done very good things to this beer. After trying this one and the 2009 vintage, I'm not going to touch my 2010 for at least 2 years. 800 charactersjamescain, Sep 14, 2011

A-Darkness, nothing else but a faint tan head. 
S-Very roasty and incredibly dark cocoa. 
T-A little smokey, malty. Hints of dark chocolate, very dry. Not at all sweet. This one reminded me of IST a little bit with this one taste surrounding it that I am yet to figure out what it is. 
M-I love the feel of a thick stout. This one is pretty close to perfect. Slight carbonation and nice and chewy. I dock it a little because I sampled this in the summer and it was a little too rich for the time.
O-I feel that this beer was just a little too dry and roasty. Out of the bigger stouts out there I feel that this one could use some more time to age before trying again. I would love to try it again but not fresh. 778 charactersbeerhan, Sep 04, 2011

Bottle to Snifter
22oz cap/wax
2010- Vampire
@Woodshop Classix
App- This poured to mix a mix of a RIS and a quad. A darker brown but with some red/amber highlights around the edges. A big puffy one finger khaki head formed and receded with a lot of dotty cling and some streaks.
Smell- Right up front this was a sweeter smelling RIS. A big copious amount of malt was there and then went into a bit of roasty notes with touches of dark chocolate and a lot of dark fruits to continue the RIS/Quad feel.
Taste- This tasted to me like one of those chocolate covered raspberry circles around easter. A dark fruit laden stout with a paired roast note on the backend of the flavor profile. A bit of dark chocolate rounded out the edges.
Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonated. Again a nice mix of the RIS/Quad flavors with residual flavors coming from the roast notes and a bit of the dark chocolate/orange/raspberry notes.
Drink- I was really impressed with this beer. It had a lot going on in the glass but wasn't overdone just a bit young. I feel I opened this one a bit young but I needed to bring something to Woodshop to compete with everyone else. I will try to land another older bottle. 1,217 charactersFosterJM, Aug 31, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Been saving this one for a while now and tonight is the big night! Big thanks to Doodler for trading this one to me. 2010 vintage into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip. 
A: Poured pitch black with about 3 fingers of dark-tan head (likely from the shaking the bottle went through as I attempted to remove the wax) and dissipated to about a finger after a few minutes. Lots o foamy lacing down the sides of the glass. 
S: Intense smells of coffee and dark chocolate immediately hit the nose, followed by molasses, vanilla, licorice and dark fruit. Of course a little alcohol burn in the nostrils as well. Very complex. 
T: Lots of powerfully sweet chocolate flavor up front, mixed with sweet candied dark fruit and thick, gooey molasses. Some bitterness comes through in the mid-palate, coffee and really dark chocolate. Hops comes through in the finish in the form of bitterness and subtle fruity sweetness. Very complex, but its sweetness boarders on cloying at times. 
M: Thick, full bodied and sticky. Very subtle carbonation. 
O: A great imperial stout, but probably towards the bottom of my "hard to get imperial stouts" list. At treat nonetheless. 1,151 charactersMrDanno96, Aug 11, 2011

A: Boy, this one lives up to its name. Completely opaque with no hints of brown even around the edges. Thick, two fingers of mocha head with a couple of white spots mixed in. Lots of large bubble and texture. A fair amount of lacing.
S: Big nose of chocolate, roasted malts, brown sugar or toffee, doughy. This is one of the sweeter smelling RIS's that I can remember and I love it.
T: Chocolate, slight vanilla, roasted malts, has a pretty sweet taste in here as well that I had originally though was brown sugar or toffee, but seeing a couple of other folks list molasses, I can certainly see that. No alcohol presence. Again, this is certainly on the sweeter side for an RIS..like it.
M: Perfect. Thick, creamy and smooth. No alcohol burn and coats the mouth with a terrific aftertaste. Leaves the lips very sticky.
O: Darkness is damn near the perfect RIS. Insanely drinkable with no alcohol presence in nose, taste or mouthfeel. Surly, as usual, has brewed a masterpiece for the style. 1,039 characterstitosupertramp, Aug 07, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 vintage poured into Dogfish Head signature glass.
Shared this one with Titosupertramp. A little back story...This one was given to me by a BA who I have never met. I started a thread on here about looking for beer spots to go on vacation. I got a BM from a BA that I had never (and still haven't) met, and never talked to. He left this at a local bottle shop for me out of sheer generosity and beer advocacy. Hoard not and share the wealth, basically. Anyways, a huge thanks to him for the chance to try this, and what a way to spend an afternoon. Not quite 'Darkness at the break of noon' as Robert Zimmerman sung, but only a couple of hours later.
A- Black. Black as Satan's soul. Darkness isn't just a clever name. Not even a tinge of red or brown on the edges. Just plain black. 
S- Lots of dark chocolate. A bit of bourbon and oak. Not enough to confuse it with a barrel aged beer, but a nice touch. Some dark fruit.
T- Lots of dark chocolate. Roasted malts. Again a bit of an oak presence, but only slightly. Some dark fruit. Very clean. The alcohol only starts to really come into play as the beer warms near room temperature. Fantastic flavors, without too much of any one piece, or anything that doesn't belong.
M- Huge, coating the mouth. Sticky, lingering. It took a glass of water to clear the palate of this to move onto the next beer. For a stout of this size, that is a compliment.
O- I have been disappointed in the past by beers with this amount of hype (Dark Lord, I'm looking at you), but this was exceptional in every way. What a treat to be able to try, and one of the best stouts that I've ever come across. Just outstanding at every level. 1,673 charactersfsvan, Aug 07, 2011

A - Dark(ness). Pretty sure I'm the only one to make that comment. Small finger of head that stuck around for a bit leaving small bubbles around the edges
S - Bitter chocolate, roasty.
T - A ton of chocolate, malty, molasses, some bitterness to it. Very sweet. Some other typical imp stout flavors (dark fruits etc). No alcohol taste to speak of. Sweetness got to me a bit after 12 oz. Reminds me a lot of Ten Fidy, but sweeter.
M - Thick. Leaves a coating on your mouth.

A- Out pours a thick blackish liquid. The head is a dark Khaki color, and laces the glass quite well. 
S- Rich roasted malts, dark chocolate, and alcohol are the first things that hit my nose. I get some nice hoppy notes, as well as some dark fruit and raisins.
T- An initial sweetness hits my tongue, followed by notes of chocolate and roasted malt. The beer is thick and creamy, with plenty of flavor. There is a nice hoppy profile on the back end, suits the beer very well. 
M- Pretty much perfect for what I like in the style. Thick and oily, without going overboard. The flavor is complex, while melding very well.
O- I had some pretty high expectations for this beer after cellaring it for the last couple years. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. An excellent RIS to say the least.

Taste - Full flavored with a complex malty flavor to it. Sweet fruits, chocolate with a coffee character. The closer the beer got to room temperature the better this beer got.
Mouthfeel - Medium to full body and low carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.

A- Dark as all heck. Swirling the glass leaves a brown coating, like brownie batter. This stuff is thick. 
S- Lots of dark roast, heavy char. Lots of sweet fruit, as well. Potent aromatics. 
T- I hear a lot of people call this one hoppy but I didn't really pick up on much. Lots of coffee and bitter chocolate, though. A wisp of smoke, and a bit of plum. This one is really all about the bitter, earthy chocolate, though. Like chewing on cacao nibs. 
M- Not as thick as it looks- which is a good thing- I am impressed at the balance the body of this beer has. It is well thought out and simply works. Great, complex flavors that don't fight for space on the tongue. 
O- Very good- a little goes a long way, but the flavors are spot-on. I very much enjoyed this one. Lives up to my expectations. 853 charactersShogoKawada, Jul 25, 2011

A- Pours an oily pitch black with a 3 finger mocha head that fizzled down to about a half finger head. Sticky lacing left on glass throughout consumption.
S- Dark chocolate, coffee and malts. Somewhat of a hoppy smell to it also.
T- Similar to the nose, dark chocolate, coffee and malts hit you up front. There's a sweetness to this that balances everything out. Alcohol is not detectable at all.
M: Medium bodied. Smooth as liquid velvet. 
O: This right here is one of the best RIS that I've tasted. Smooth and not too sweet. This is beer that should be served to royalty. Can't wait to try this again. 652 charactersDevi0us, Jul 25, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this at a stout night (9 July, 2011) with friends. It was Ivan, Abyss, Darkness, and Dark Lord, in that order. We had pretzels and water and some Goose Island Summertime in between rounds. Everything I had was out of a 6 oz snifter.
This pours a thick-looking black with a dark, short head that left some lace on the way down, something I was not expecting at all. On the nose I could tell that this was going to be a bitter affair, with big quantities of roasted barley and pine hops, which probably have begun to fade but still have a presence. There was also some molasses and bitter chocolate. In the mouth all of these flavors meld into something amazing. There is no disconnect. From the lowest notes of molasses and barley to the highest bits of chocolate, there are no gaps. The body was huge, not syrupy but towards a milkshake, with some warmth emerging as it warms up. The finish is ultra long, the bitter notes sticking around a bit longer than the sweet molasses.
Overall, this was probably my favorite beer of the night. Everything just blended together pretty nicely into one of my favorite stouts. I'm pretty sure I'll get to revisit all of the others at some point, but this is probably the only chance I had with Darkness. It was an amazing one. 1,269 charactersEricCioe, Jul 21, 2011

A: Extremely oily black pour. Im really surprised by the mocha head that quickly forms, and climbs to the top of the glass. Some activity from carbonation, head dissipates into nothing.
S: Wood, smoke, caramelized sugar, milk chocolate... burnt aromas, maybe a bit over charred. Some underlying hops here as well.
T: Initial chocolate and charred malt dumps right into some serious dark fruit. Deep purple, dark red flavors...the core of this beer is sweetened dark fruits and weird piney hoppage. Secondaries include licorice and roasted coffee. Pretty good, somewhat complex... unfortunately as I feared, too sweet.
M: Carbonated heavy cream
O: A worthy stout, though it doesn't measure up to its own impressive looking bottle art. 751 characterszoolzoo, Jun 30, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Blaine for sharing his 2010 bottle during our recent tasting at Willard's. The brew pours a visibly viscous bowling-ball black and is capped with a patchy brown-mocha head that recedes to an encircling wisp; the glass is marked with both legs and lace. The nose has a fair amount of hoppiness; while it is not intensely bitter, it shows a lot of specific hop character, centered in the herbal and lemon-citric range. After a bit the hop impact wanes and suggestions of brutally roasted coffee, 90% cocoa dark chocolate, and something akin to smoked date compote are noted; it is good but not mind-blowing. The flavor kicks it a notch higher in my estimation, with rich sweetness leading the way in the form of suggestions of dark chocolate, dates macerated in port, fig newtons, dark bread and prunes. There are elements at play to temper the sweetness, including hints of meaty smoke, some earthy and herbal hop character, and a fair dose of heavily roasted espresso. The feel is slick and creamy and works quite well. Overall, not world-class, but quite good, nearly exceptional. 1,095 charactersktrillionaire, Jun 29, 2011

S - Hops jump out right away with a little bit of chocolate mixed in.
T - Not quite as hoppy as Night Stalker (the RIS with the strongest hops I've had and can compare to). Some toffee followed by milk chocolate candy defines the taste of this beer. Everything seems pretty well balanced. 
M - Creamy and thick. Very enjoyable. 
O - No one flavor is very strong but it all melds together pretty nicely. I think I expected something sweeter with stronger favors but I certainly can't say this beer disappointed. Its a great RIS and look forward to having again. 634 charactersTStron, Jun 27, 2011

#100 review
A- Pitch black color, beautiful 2 to three fingers mocha frothy head, dissipates really slowly, sticks to the sides like crazy, excellent carbonation, beautiful lacing, one of the best looking RIS I’ve had.
S- Wow big sweet aromas upfront, slight roastiness but the sweetness overpowers, dark fruits upfront, almost quad like, chocolate, cherries, raisins, really sweet aroma.
T- Big complex beer, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, cherries, raisins, molasses, really sweet with some bitterness, slight coffee taste but its hidden. 
M- Big mouthfeel, excellent carbonation, sticky and smooth, gets thicker as it warms up.
O- I’ve had this bottle sitting in my cellar for a while waiting for the right occasion to drink it, had it for the first time on tap at Mackenizies during MN craft beer week and was blown away. It’s safe to say I was not let down from the bottled version. Amazing stout, so rich and complex, one of the best RIS I’ve had, cannot wait to compare the 08 and 09 to this version. 1,091 charactersChriscrundwell12, Jun 18, 2011

Went to Darkness Day 2009. I had the 2008 on draft before and thought it was pretty good, so I wasn't expecting anything less.
A- Not black, but brown with amber highlights...not very dark and not at all reminiscent of an imperial stout
S- wonderful piney hops. Wow does this ever smell good. It's so piney.
T- Unbalanced, cloyingly sweet mess. Where's the roasty chocolate flavors? What's with this nutty caramel taste domination? It hides its ABV well.
M- Over-carbonated big time, thin bodied and fizzy, not at all viscous.
O- Don't waste your time and money. This is an unbalanced imperial brown ale. What's with the hype? Surly does make some good beers (Abrasive and Wet), but this is not one of them. 767 characterscpz28, Jun 17, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I traded this beer with Sean (claaarck13) and his wife Amber for some westy beer. We had a great time in Belgium when we met in may 2011.
I poured out this bottles during a beertasting at my cousin Peter's place. There were a lot of starting beer geeks who could not believe that there are so many good beers in the world.
Poured out in a wineglass this was one of the highlights of the day. Very soft taste and dito smell. Soft taste but also full of taste, chocolate, dark candy lakritz. This beer made the participants quiet.
Thanks for this beer Sean! 558 charactersBrabander, Jun 13, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Finally decided to open this bottle. 2008 vintage, poured into my Bruery tulip.
Surprise, surprise! Black, with a nice 2-finger tan head that retreats to a thin cap. Pour appears to be medium-bodied for an imperial stout.
Aroma... is odd. I'm not totally on board with it. Lots of malt there, looots of malt. There's a bit of a toasted character, some berry fruitiness, but malt dominates this beer, making it almost one-dimensional. I don't really care for this smell, other imperial stouts are vastly superior (IMO) in this department.
Taste, on the other hand, is really great. It's not often that you'll get such disparity between taste and smell. I'm glad for this. Malty, with slight bitterness on the back end. I am getting blackberry and cherry notes, roasted marshmallow, and a bit of toast here. Chocolate is barely a whisper, and coffee is almost non-existent. Very interesting take on the style, I've never had an imperial stout like this before.
Mouthfeel is outstanding, simply great. It's full-bodied, but doesn't quite reach thick. Perfect, medium level of carbonation. Silky, smooth, and creamy. Easily one of the best mouthfeels I've ever experienced.
Overall, this is quite good. I do wish that I had the opportunity to try this fresh, as I am guessing the hops add a lot to this beer, particularly with respect to the nose. As it is, it's still quite a nice and unusual stout. Recommended. 1,414 charactersdavod23, Jun 09, 2011

A- pours an ink-black with a chocolate, mocha like head that starts at about half the cup and shrinks down to a solid two inches. This is one of the best looking beers I have ever seen.
S- dark chocolate and coffee, and some oakiness and earthiness as well.
T/M- whoa, the dark chocolate definitely comes through, but is nuanced with licorice, winter fruits, raisins. A slight suggestion of smoke as well, perhaps in the form of some tobacco like qualities. The taste is incredibly complex. It's a little hot, but nothing too boozy. The mouthfeel is medium to thick, not as thick as I would prefer but still nice.
O- this really is one of the best RIS beers I have ever had, and maybe the best I've had period. I have seen the darkness, and it was indeed enlightening. 887 charactersTschnab, Jun 07, 2011

pours a jet-black tone while yielding a strong, creamy mocha-colored head. outstanding retention and lacing, evident even in the tasting cup.
nose offers lots of roasted malt and chocolate, with secondary notes of anise and coffee. very nice.
wow, flavor is right behind the aroma, backing it up with huge, bold characteristics of roasted malt, chocolate, anise, coffee, and a hint of smoke. delicious.
medium-full mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.
overall this a superb RIS, no doubt about it. very, very well done. just wish it were easier to get a hold of. 679 charactersperrymarcus, Jun 07, 2011

from a bottle, not on tap
Bottle number 10 thanks to johnbjaeger
A - Well, after wrestling with a nicely waxed bottle to remove the cap, I poured it into my pint glass to get a dark brown, almost black color with a few inches of a nice frothy tan foam that had no intention of going anywhere. It did leave some nice lacing and it slowly went down
S - Really nice roasted malt aroma with hints of tobacco, chocolate and smooke. None of those overpower the other and just blend nicely.
T - Nice smooth taste, rum, raisins and other dark fruit, a slight smokey quality along with chocolate, molasses, vanilla and roasted malts. The smokiness seems to come back around in the finish just after pushing away a nice sweetness.
M - Really creamy mouthfeel with a low carbonation but just a bit of a tingle on the tongue. The whole experience seems to disappear quickly and is slightly dry and makes you want more.
D - I could easily put this bottle away in a matter of minutes. I find it to be very enjoyable and I can't wait to see what it is and seek out more.

The pour is viscous, jet black color, thin tan head. The aroma is full of chocolate, booze, coffee and oak. The flavor is like the nose, and it is very smooth for such a big beer. The beer is thick, and the big abv is not noticeable. A great beer, that I am very glad to have tried. 388 charactersbonkers, May 29, 2011

-very dark in color with a golden brown head. the head is stuck around for quite awhile which was nice as i am a sucker for a caramel colored head
-1st 2 things...big time molasses and this isn't bourbon aged? because it sure smells that way. as it warms, there is some vanilla and dark fruits in there too
-again the molasses is very strong. there is also a big time burnt sugar taste. i also get some fig and prune notes, along with a bit of vanilla and butterscotch. maybe the smallest hint of chocolate too
-nice and thick like i like em, but not suuuper think. it was nice and silky smooth, and it wasn't really hot at all
-i had tried a pour of the '09 vintage last year at Boonville Beerfest and I really wasn't very impressed at all. this on the other hand was very tasty. although, i would argue with anyone that wanted to call this an old ale due to its flavor profile, but still very good nonetheless 999 charactersjuhl31, May 25, 2011

A: Super dark with a really awesome khaki head retention probably 1.5 fingers worth and it stuck around.
S: HOPS! Chocolate, toffee? Yeah this is my favorite for sure!
T: First sip is malt and chocolate then the bitter hops set in, wonderful balance. This beer is just outstanding. As it warms the flavors develop and the taste becomes more in depth leaving the consumer with more malts, chocolate well rounded hoppy finish and maybe the toffee I smelled in the beginning. 
O: This is an all time favorite of mine and one of the first beers I had that changed my view of beer. 784 charactersAlpar, May 23, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is one imperial that definitely stands out from the others in the hop profile.
Appearance-- The color was a jet black with a head that was always slightly there and had nice carbonation.
Smell- The smell is what sets this beer apart from other RIS's- i smell beatiful hops in a nice floral way. I have never had a RIS that smells like a mellow IPA up front- never smelled so much hoppiness in a RIS- Awesome!
Taste- All i can say is less sweetness than Darklord but tons of chocolate. I liked that it was very balanced and not too sweet- very smooth!
Mouthfeel- This is really creamy - chocolate milk like.
Drinkablility--- I could drink a bunch of this. You would never know this is almost 11 percent- really easy to drink and very enjoyable. 753 charactersRampage1, May 17, 2011

This was sublime.
Aroma was complex and enjoyable. Rich dark malts with sweetness, roast and a nice layer of hops.
Poured like syrup. Pitch black. Very dark head of black and brown.
Flavor was remarkable. Deep dark fruits. A subdued hop presence but still noticeable.
Incredibly smooth and rich without excess. Like velvet on the tongue. Just enough carbonation to contribute without being noticeable.
This was one helluva' beer. Savored well. 457 charactersgarymuchow, May 16, 2011

A: Very dark brown pour that has light coming through on the pour. I hesitate saying black because it just isnt quite black but close...Healthy tan head with large and small bubbles and spotty lacing.
S: sweet malts, chocolate and cocoa mixing with a sweet brown sugar smell. Definitely some crystal malts in here to flavor and round out the malt profile. Aroma is right up my alley with the sweetness I enjoy in an imperial stout. 
T: Taste is greatly rounded. I picked up a lot of chocolate and crystal malt flavors with cocoa and brown sugar flavors. There is a lot of sweetness in here and I am really enjoying it. Flavors start of strong and sweet, very closely following the flavors I find in a good barleywine. Caramelized sugars also bring out some berry and marshmallow flavors. Medium bodied for the style, some may say light but at 10.3 this really comes through without any heat at all. 
Light carbonation and overall a very good Impy stout. I can see why this one gets the hype, just hope that they continue to produce it in numbers as large as they have been in order to quell all the profiteers. 1,165 charactersalpinebryant, May 14, 2011

4.21/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from the 2010 release with the Vampire on the label.
Glad I jumped the gun on this brew as it is not what you would expect for a popular limited release RIS. This brew poured a extremly black color with the formation of a dark brown colored head. The head stuck around and graced the glass with lace, which I love. The aroma was not extremly powerfull but carried notes of a sweet malt and dark fruits. The taste was extremely interesting as I said above it is not what you would think. Most limited RIS have a extremely thick body with overly powerfull roast flavor, this brew did not. The brew carried a medium style body with a bit more carbonation then is usual with this style. Flavors jumped off the brew as balanced roast/sweet malt/Darkfruits. I was taken back as I was prepared to have my taste buds thrown back by the usual unbalanced nature of RIS. This brew was elegant and is incredibly deserving of its popularity. Will be looking for more bottles of next years release. 992 charactersBZero007, May 11, 2011

A: Pours a jet black and a half finger of a dark brown head. Darker than any head I've seen come out of a RIS before. The beer has a pretty strong viscosity as you move it around in the glass. 
S: Deep roasted grain smell along with dark fruits and molasses. 
T: Sweet molasses is prevalent throughout. Hops at the end keep the sweetness in check. Some dark fruit flavors but less so than the nose indicated it might. Lots of rich dark malt flavors without the burnt taste so many RISs have.
M: Thick and creamy with very little carbonation on the tongue. I'd argue one of the best feels of any RIS I've had.
O: To me, this is currently one of the top 3 non-barrel aged RIS/Double Stouts I've had the opportunity to try. Can't wait to trade for next year's version and try it all over again. 917 charactersgregshead, May 09, 2011

A: pours black with two fingers of dark tan head which maintains well and leaves good lacing.
S: roasted malts with lots of dark fruit, molasses, and bitter coffee aromas. A very nice mix of sweet and roasted/bitter.
T: very similar to the aromas. Dark fruits, molasses, sweet chocolate, and dark, roasted slightly bitter coffee. On the sweeter side, but with enough roasted malts for balance. Very slight alcohol burn for the gravity.
M: thick body with low carb, this beer isn't quite creamy but is a tad oily instead.
O: Overall, a good beer. Not worth the hype or trading your cellar for, but still good. It's a bit sweeter than I prefer, but not cloyingly so. 689 charactersn2185, May 08, 2011

T: More coffee notes than the aroma, caramel backbone, dry fruit (figs), present alcohol that is crips, with some lingering apple core earthy bitterness.

2010 on-tap at Kuma's Corner in Chicago. Served in a tulip.
A- Black as night. There is a 1 finger dark brown head with some thick lacing.
S- Chocolate, coffee beans, brown sugar and some carmel malt upfront with some dark fruit such as cherries, fig and plums in the background. 
T- Chocolate fudge hits the palate first with espresso beans, vanilla, brown sugar, wood and some dark fruit sweetness. So many layers but no heat of alcohol detected. Absolutely delicious.
M- Low carbonation and full bodied, but is incredibly smooth, creamy and has a silk-like mouthfeel that makes it incredibly drinkable for such a big beer.
O- I was trying my hardest to drink this as slow as possible and savor every sip since it would be a while for me to enjoy this again. I've had the chance to have the '10 on-tap and an '09 bottle and gave the '10 a slight advantage. Amazing brew and wouldn't expect anything else from Surly. 935 charactersiadler, May 03, 2011

Vintage: 2010 (vampire)
Pours jet black with a large three-finger foamy mahogany head...impressive. Big curdled yogurt-like bubbles on top retain for a long time too. Lace is decent and spotty.
When I opened the bottle I thought I smelt spoiled milk and got nervous, but that scent is now completely gone. Deep milk chocolate is the dominant aroma with toasted malts behind it. The toasting is very mellow and not nearly to the point of charred or anything like that. Light fruit lingers behind everything, with only a bit of dark fruit present at all. I like it, but expected more.
Boy is this beer sweet, almost cloyingly so. It tastes like sugar water on first sip, with some lemon or citrus notes at the start. The taste is light and summery almost at the start, and I enjoyed it after a couple sips considerably more than I did at the start. The lightness eventually moves to a once again mellow toastiness; light coffee notes that weren't present in the nose come out here. Abv is hidden completely, and isn't noticeable even as a warmer.
Mouthfeel is fluid and sticky, but thinner than you would think. Definitely not a thick, syrupy beer. Carbonation isn't really present in spite of the large head. Drinkability is tough to gauge - the start and finish don't really go together well, and it feels like a jolt to the system with each sip, but the beer is definitely tasty and well crafted. I thought the hiding of the abv was well done, as booze added to the sweetness present would have been unpleasant. Overall I wasn't blown away, and I much prefer Surly's IPAs, but this was a more than solid offering from a very impressive brewery. 1,725 charactersveinless, May 01, 2011

A -- An immensely dark brew, black as sin with no light showing pours into a full four finger deep brown head and recedes slowly into a hefty froth with heavy tight bubbled lacing.
S -- Smoke and earth, countered by sweet, roasty malt and dark fruits. Hints of tobacco, brown sugar, and molasses.
T -- Hugely smoky, espresso and tobacco are heady in the front, backed by molasses and spiced rum soaked prunes with tones of black cherry and charred babies. Yes, babies. Notes of anise and clove. Finishes on the bitter end with a linger that really sticks around and a very mild alcohol burn.
M -- Definitely a big beer, heavy in body and on the palate. It has retained an excellent low - to - moderate carbonation in the cellar. Slightly creamy. A little sticky which I would expect from the style and slightly resinous.
D -- Excellent brew. I've had other vintages in the past and they stack up equivalently but this is the first time I've thought about reviewing it, and I'm glad I did. Happy 100 to me! 1,111 charactersCPeterson, Apr 29, 2011

2010 (vampire)
This long time want graciously provided to me by bauermj. Poured into my new Darkness glass that was sent by Beeruser in perfect timing. 
Appearance
The beer flows forth languidly, boasting its full body and robust color. The collection in the glass is dense and blackened. An undertone of burnt red, much like the color of the wax that crowns this bottle, gives the beer warmth and character. The head is a yellowed khaki with a frothy and soft pretense. Creeping rings of lace adorn the glass in short order, fueled by the ever-present ring of foam. 
Smell
Darkness carries with it aromas of soy sauce and tobacco that are uniquely its own. Rich molasses and brown sugar lay a sweetened backdrop to licorice, steak sauce and freshly laid mulch. The bouquet is indeed full of darkness but encompasses the realm of caramelized and aged sugars and sweets. A consideration of the final glass of the bottle yields strong aromas of prunes and hints of chocolate covered raisins. 
Taste
The soy sauce and molasses flavors are the dominant ones. They grip the sides of the tongue with a sharp, rum soaked fruitcake flavor that is bracketed by sweet pipe tobacco. There is a milky creaminess that tries to push through but the denser molasses and anise flavors suppress it for the most part. As the glass warms, caramel and a faint citrusy hopping come out. A fleeting hint of smoke pops out just at the end, and only after this beer warms to room temperature. 
Mouthfeel
The best part of this beer is the way it slides over the palate, offering little resistance. It feels frictionless. Its very low and fluffy soft carbonation furthers the effects of the full body. There is a little bit of stickiness left on the lips, but this is a sweet beer, that should be expected. Some alcohol warmth and an oily, licorice flavored coating is left behind for a long finish and aftertaste. 
Overall
This is a great stout. It’s large in stature and silky smooth and thick. It is, however, quite sweet and wrought with tobacco and soy sauce notes that get in the way of its roastiness. So, all things considered, this did not live up to what I expected from it. 2,338 charactersMbpBugeye, Apr 24, 2011

Finish is dry. Very nice, smooth beer. 329 characterstrappistlover, Apr 23, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 vintage (vampire)
A-Impenetrably black with a 1/2 inch of foamy cola colored head. Leaves plenty of lacing.
S-Milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. About what I'd expect from your average imperial stout.
T/M-Very soft and rich, with well balanced flavors of milk chocolate, condensed milk sweetness, caramel, lightly roasted malts. The back end is slightly hoppy, but it serves to cut the sweetness, not providing too much to the flavor profile. There's a sharp, soy saucey flavor mid-palate that is gone no more than a moment after it presents itself. The finish is full and sustained, with a drying quality on the back of the throat.
O-Much simpler than I expected, but a very successful beer. It reveals itself slowly, and has a residual effect, building flavors upon flavors the longer you drink. Highly reccomended. 830 charactersDaveHS, Apr 18, 2011

2008 Vintage (I'll get to the 2009 eventually, Jamie. I swear!)
Darkness lives up to its name. It's pitch black. Onyx. No light cutting through at all. A mocha colored crown tops it off and rises to nearly two fingers in depth. It's surprisingly slow to dissipate. Lacing is sticky, and thicker than expected. Very impressive.
The nose is nothing short of exceptional. Roasted and chocolate malts are easily the centerpiece. Bittersweet, dark chocolate notes are strong throughout, and smell delicious. Coffee is definitely in the mix, but is a secondary component. It's complementary, but works perfectly in that role. A hint of dark fruit is noted. Definitely subtle. Alcohol is pretty well buried. I'm not getting much at all. 
The flavor is explosive! The malt base is rock solid and features a delicious mix of roasted and chocolate malts. Bittersweet, dark chocolate fudge resonates throughout, and is delicious! The malts are easily the focal point. Secondary flavors of espresso/roasted coffee, molasses, anise, and very light dark fruit all creep in and add a ton of depth, complexity, and character. After roughly two and a half years, it should come as no surprise that the hops have faded. But, there are some remnants. I suspect this is a rather hoppy Stout fresh. Alcohol is noted, but has integrated well over time. It's not warm or hot at all. Finishes bittersweet and malty with a light dark fruit flavor. 
Darkness has a body that's full...but only barely. Carbonation is light, and it is definitely svelte and smooth. It's not the most impressive I've ever had, but it is excellent. For a big stout, it goes down far too easy. A 750 is simply not enough.
I've patiently held on to this bottle of Darkness for quite some time. It's tough to tell exactly how it's evolved since I didn't try it fresh, but it is incredibly impressive beer after two and a half years in the bottle. The only slight knock I have is that dark fruit is just a little too strong in flavor. That holds it back a little, but that's nitpicking to the extreme. Darkness is incredible! Thanks a ton, Jamie! Looking forward to the 2009 bottle. 2,182 charactersprototypic, Apr 09, 2011

2010 Vintage (Vampire)
A - A beer has never been so aptly named until this beer. It flows out, viscous and sucking in all light, and only yields a bit of color when it builds its giant, 2-finger head, dark mocha in color. Retention is great, lasting about halfway through the glass, and even when it fades, it leaves behind a magnitude of bubbles. The lacing is fantastic as well, draping a curtain of lace over the glass. Easily one of the better looking Russian Imperial Stouts.
S - On first smell, this reminds me a lot of Oak Aged Yeti in the fact that it has a good amount of wood and oak and hops, as well as some chocolate, dark fruits, alcohol, and perhaps a slight vanilla? 
T - The taste is much more subtle than initially expected, bringing smooth tastes of wood, bitter chocolate, and almost rum-soaked fruits. Slightly roasty but overall everything comes together nicely. There's a noticeable hop taste as well. Finish is long and full of chocolate and a bit of alcohol. 
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with low carbonation. Given the big head, I was expecting more carbonation, but as it is now it has an appropriate amount. It's very smooth and the head adds some creaminess. 
D - Drinkability is moderately high. The feel and taste are good, but was looking for something a little more given how talked up this beer is. I'd like to see a bit more complexity, but its a solid beer overall. 1,523 charactersnhindian, Apr 08, 2011

O: I have just begun reviewing after many years of sampling and consuming beer, but this is currently my favorite beer I have the chance to experience. Received in beer trade from Great example of Imperial Stout and wowed me from first drink. 756 charactersmrseano, Mar 29, 2011
4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 vintage.
This is a seriously black beer. Like buried underground black. Probably the best head retention I've ever seen on a stout, and pretty good lace as well.
Aroma of sweet heady hops in the background and chocolate cookies dominating. The smell of this beer makes me hungry. A little char, vanilla and caramel sweetness.
Perfect interplay of hop bitterness, black/roasted malt bitterness, and cookie dough sweetness. Notes of tobacco, tart purple fruit, molasses, and milk chocolate come and go in no particular progression. This does not exactly have the typical profile of an RIS. It goes beyond, and I wish it had more contemporaries/imitators. Siberian Night and Marshal Zhukov's come to mind.
Very creamy, chewy and smooth, this is what all RISs should feel like.
I was always told this was a hoppy RIS. Maybe when it's fresh, but not the case here. Good thing, because more bitterness would have ruined it for me. 934 characters7ways, Mar 28, 2011

Darkness; that is the mood with MSU out of the tournament in the 1st round after 2 final fours.
Opaque viscous black pour. A thinner layer of tan head that did retain fairly well.
Very vinuous aroma. Quite a bit of fruit and some light herbal and citrus hops. Roast malt, some molasses and cocoa.
There's the initial smack of some dark red fruits, but that fades quickly into roasted malt, chocolates, molasses. Finishes with some anise and coffee and cocoa. Still some piney hop action and bitters through that finish. Actually finishes quite clean for all the unfermented I'm sure is in this.
This is really near a 4.5. As it warmed more flavors popped even more, so I bumped it up.
Thick and coating. A velvety carbonation almost creamy. Warming but the alcohol is well within check. Goes down better than some others of this status.
Certainly worth trying and the age probably did good by me as I'm not big into the overly hoppy Imperial Stouts. 991 charactersBung, Mar 19, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4poured at cellar temp into a glencairn, received in trade from AdamU726.
A - almost opaque, very black with brown hints. very nice fluffy head formed thin and hung around a bit leaving tiny amount of lacing and a ring.
S - plenty of roast, dark chocolate, some hints of molasses, vanilla, slight sour cherry, coffee. odd tartness that isn't funk, but a bit acidic?
T - quite complex IS. stuff keeps developing as it warms, but mostly dark chocolate up from, little overbrewed coffee and vanilla following, with that slightest hint of sour dark fruit that cuts through the dark roasty notes nicely. became more sweet as it warmed but was still in balance with the chocolate and roast.
M - very nice. medium-full bodied for style, but great residual coating in mouth and appropriate carbonation.
D - quite drinkable. not too sweet or cloying, not too roasty, alcohol well blended. definitely recommended. with the body being so full but overall a little sweet this should age very nicely. 991 charactersjhimstedt, Mar 15, 2011
3.58/5  rDev -19%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5A huge thanks to Aw Yeh for splitting this beer with me. Our first beer of the night as we set out to relive childhood memories and complete A Link to the Past in one night.
Appearance - Well the first challenge was actually sawing through the quarter inch thick black wax. Poured into a Great Lakes Christmas Ale snifter. A delicious chocolaty foam head foams up immediately as it rises to the brim of the glass. The beer itself is pitch black; no way any light is shining through this one.
Smell - Rich in its chocolate malt profile. Slight hints of coffee as well. Light barley and hops are present in the background. Smells slightly sour due to fruit scents.
Taste - A very complex taste. I didn't know where to begin when trying to identify it. A slightly bitter swallow filled with chocolate and slight ethanol. The aftertaste is a very sweet chocolate and dark fruit that could even have some honey in it as well. A slight sweet bourbon note as well. I don't get many hints of coffee in this, but when I do; it is very faint. Slight spices linger on my tongue at the finish. The taste is almost unplesant at times though, due to how complex it is. I don't feel as if the flavors blend together very well at times.
Mouthfeel / Drinkability - A little hard to swallow at times because of the ABV, but it is definitely a tasty beer. There is no mistaking that this is a Russian Imperial Stout. Filled with hints of dark fruit, honey, spices and chocolate. 1,463 charactersJesse13713, Mar 12, 2011

Thanks to whoever brought this to the Inaugural "Imminent Liquidation Bottle Share" Event. 2009 bottle poured into a taster glass.
A - Pours deep black with a small half finger tall tan head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving light lacing down the glass.
S - Some sweet chocolate, a light does of hops, dark roasted malt, earthy wood, lactose sweetness, and some light smoke. It has good overall balance. Not the best I have smelled but far from the worst.
T - Lots of dark roast up front giving way slowly to a mix of light hop bitterness, sweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee, light smoke, and some astringent wood helping to dry the pallet after consumption. Finish is dry with some lingering roast. Not exactly what I was expecting. I may have to get a bottle of this for myself and revisit this one.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. A bit too thin in the feel for my liking with some lingering dark roast in the finish.
D - Drinkability was not too bad. Well this was a bit of a letdown. I am not sure if it was just this bottle or what but I expected a lot more. I will have to get a bottle for myself to make sure.

3.05/5  rDev -31%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5Vintage 2009, black wax. Poured into a tasting glass, courtesy of an anonymous BA at Imminent Liquidation. Thanks for the opportunity!
A: Darkness is no understatement - pitch jet black with a very minimal mocha colored head. Quick dissipation, not bad.
S: Nice aromatics, some lactose, sweet notes of milk chocolate, roasted caramel malt elements. Well balanced, nothing dominating or show stealing. All in all, it's still a nice display of flavors.
T: Holy hell, this is not as inviting as the aroma. Really sweet milkiness up-front that is palate coating and sticky. It won't go away. I can't get any other flavors to compete with this taste left in my mouth. Some overly sweet chocolate notes try to break through but it's not enough. Where's the roast? The malt base? SOMETHING! Nothing. Disappointing.
M: Pretty thin for the style, definitely does not have the creaminess or full-bodied mouth feel I am looking for. The carbonation is on the lower end, which helps this from becoming a complete mess.
I'm not quite sure if it was just this vintage or if something went wrong in this bottle but it tasted soured, but I don't think there were any reports of infection, so I'm just assuming this was how it was meant to be. I'd gladly taste another vintage to see what the heck was going on here. Thanks again though to whoever brought the bottle, not your fault, but just a let down for a beer I've almost traded a lot for -- or even dropped some $$ for on the 'bay. 1,475 charactersShanePB, Mar 08, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thankyou to shir0045 for this one. 2010 Vampire bottle with black wax a dabs of golden wax on the outside.
Poured into a snifter.Pours jet black with a gorgeous creamy thick light brown heading.Great lacing and retention.
Smell underneath the heavy roasted malty goodness is chocolate,sugar coated fruits,and a touch of smoke.
Taste is outstanding.Chocolate is extremely big here. Quick hot liquor barges in to make it's presence felt but the belgian candy sugars smooth it all out for a nice finish. In the end a very sappy like pine hop oil coats the palate and burnt malts linger for a while afterwards.
Mouth is full bodied and so damn soft in the mouth.Extremely velvety smooth texture here probably the best a mouthfeel you can get.No chewiness whatsover perfect balance.
This beer is a work of art. Absolutely delicious. 832 charactersTheFightfan1, Mar 06, 2011

A - Pours as black as expected. A really nice creamy, mocha color head forms and has excellent retention. REALLY nice lacing. Really a very nice looking appearance.
S - Sweet milk chocolate right up front; appears more of a milk chocolate than a dark chocolate. The roasted malt notes are much more subdued than I would have expected. There s a really nice earthiness in the aroma which I can only assume is from some grassy hops.
T - Wow, the dark roasted malts really come out here; almost burnt in a way. Lots of dark fruits coming through under the roastiness with some molasses flavors as well. Earthy, grassy hops come out too which is really refreshing for such a big beer. The chocolate in the nose comes out on the palate very sweet and milky. Slightest soy dauce flavor in the end which I find interesting. VERY complex and delicious.
M - Very creamy and smooth. Rich and full bodied. Slightest carbination on the end of the palate.
D - Extremely well balanced beer for everything going on in it. Was a absolute pleasure to drink and hope to get my hands on more than 1 bottle next year. 1,190 charactersKAP1356, Mar 03, 2011

A: Black Body with tan foamy head, and nice sticky lacing, a beautiful start. 
S: Pretty standard sweet chocolate tinged stout with an addition of grassy hops on top and small roast. Some dark fruits and dried dark fruit aromas too. Good.
T: Much more complex than the smell. Dark charred malt, soy sauce, chocolate, hop esters and grass, milk lactose sweetness. huge malt character but the hops are a great compliment. Port wine sweetness that I enjoy. Nice.
M: Very smooth, outstandingly so. Roasty finish to a full bodied stout.
D: Excellent beer that I see the draw of. 647 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 01, 2011

A- AS BLACK AS THE INSIDE OF A COFFIN ON A MOONLESS NIGHT. FOR REAL THIS BEER MAKES CHARLIE MURPHY LOOK LIKE AN ALBINO.
S- Hoping for the complexities to really show. I get a lot of malts and a faint hint of dried fruits maybe a figs or prunes.
T- Lot of malts and again the flavor of figs. I wouldn't consider it bad, just nothing amazing. 
M- Very thick. Like drinking a milkshake. This was the best aspect of the beer.
D- The darkness is very delicious and dark just want to say i think very highly of surly beer because the come thru time and time again with soild and wounderful tasting product. 798 charactersiLovehops23, Feb 27, 2011

2010 Vintage.
A - Pours a dark dark brown almost black color that lets no light through. A vigorous pour generates a tan 2 inch head that is very dense and thick and has some medium sized bubbles mixed around.
S - Aroma statts off sweet with some burnt caramel notes. Slight raisin and prunes are also present. There is some boozy heat and sweetness as well mixed in with the caramel. Slight vanilla hints mixed in with some spicy cinnamon on the nose. 
T & M - Wow. I can see how this beer is so beloved. Starts off with some sharp alcoholic sweetness that isn't too overwhelming or intense but just right. There are hints of burnt caramel and some slight raisin notes. All these flavors are well represented and crafted but not too intense or overwhelming. Seems pretty balanced for such a big beer. In the middle of this sweetness there are some slight bitter chocolate hints and espresso notes. The coffee hints give this a nice roasted middle and slightly dry finish. There is a nice sweet after taste though that is mildly sticky but not sickeningly. The beer is smooth and oily and goes down easily but surprisingly and in my opinion the body isn't too heavy. It is near perfection in terms of mouthfeel with good carbonation as well.
D - Although this beer gets a lot of press here on BA I feel that it is deserving. It is quite big in ABV and complexity of flavors but at the same time not overly sweet. Quite approachable and repeatable. 1,497 charactersJoEBoBpr, Feb 22, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From Notes: 12-26-10
Appearance: Jet black body lies beneath a tan lacing that covers the class. Very thin tan head.
Smell: Caramel, roasty malts with sweetness and not a great amount of alcohol present. 
Taste: Alcohol coating comes first and is followed by roasty flavors with a caramel creamy finish. 
Mouthfeel: Alcohol has a pleasant amount of coating that cuts well into the robust flavors from the caramel to roasted flavors.
Drinkability: Small amounts of alcohol and the mixture of sweetness to a roast like malt create a solid, genuine sense of acceptable drinkability. 584 charactersbrewdub17, Feb 21, 2011

Pours black with a creamy brown head, it looks rich. Lots of lacings on the sides of the glass as I swirl it. Smells of roasted dark chocolate, sweet, but not overly. Tons of roasted malt, then creamy chocolate, dark cherry favor, and some traces of hops on the finish. The mouth is creamy as this beer is very well balanced. The flavor hides the alcohol perfectly. I would drink this beer again (it is a sipper) due to it's well balanced flavor. Not too dry, bitter or too sweet, this was an excellent RIS. 521 charactersSiepJones, Feb 20, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Finally got a chance to try this beer. Split with good friends, this beer pours a deep dark brown near-black color with a dark brown head, very leggy in the glass on the sides. First whiff and I'm surprisingly hit with hops - bright and piney up front, giving way to nice molasses and deeply roasted barely aromas. Nice. Hops again right up front, pretty unique for a stout, but as the beer warms and you get used to it, this fades in favor of the more familiar stout-y flavors. Lots of deep tones of raisin, coffee, chocolate, leather, a nice subtle char and light smoky flavor in the finish. Great variety coming through. I think my favorite part may be the rich chewy mouthfeel that is somehow at the same time velvety smooth. I wish I had another to age - I bet it develops quite well and the hops die off a bit, but fresh it is certainly damn good and a really unique tasting stout. Very cool. 898 characterstwelvsies, Feb 20, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Ryan? for sharing this 2009 version at the PtY release. From notes.
Appearance - Poured into a small plastic cup, room temperature, though with a dark viscosity and over a finger of nice tan head. 
Smell - Heavy roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa/chocolate, smoke, coffee, dark fruits such as raisins, figs, and prunes. Smells great.
Taste - Initial flavor is roasted, burnt molasses and malt. The cocoa comes through next, along with the dark fruits. I was comparing this to Dark Lord, which I had the prior night, and at least year to year (the DL was 09) this was damn good and better. A smoky character is the last flavor I taste.
Mouthfeel - Full bodied, creamy, lower carbonation.
Drinkability - For the half a glass I got, relatively so. It was a bit "too" warm for me once I was done, but if it had been a tad colder I think I would have enjoyed it that much more. I have one of these sitting in my cellar and can't wait to open it. Very good beer! 969 charactersSpdKilz, Feb 19, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On draft ~ poured into a snifter.
Appearance- Pours damn near jet black with a thick tan head. Great head retention with a bit of lace left behind.
Smell- Chocolate, dark fruits, caramel, a little roast.
Taste- Sweet milk chocolate starts things off, leading into some toffee, caramel and a hint of molasses. Dark fruit presence, from the Belgian sugar, with notes of cherry and plum. A little roast and hops on the finish, the lingering taste is chocolate with some light roasted malt. The roast doesn't come near the "burnt" point, making this incredibly smooth and drinkable.
Mouthfeel- Full body with ample carbonation, very good.
Overall- Great beer, the abv's go virtually unnoticed. Great balance and depth to this one. It truly is a world class Imperial Stout. 773 charactersJLeege, Feb 18, 2011

smell was not very strong but i got lots of hops black licorice 
taste was better then the nose - i picked up the same things lots of hops and black licorice AND lots of chocolate
mouthfeel is perfect - full body but not heavy with good carbonation that gives it a creamy and oh so velvety smooth feel

A: Pours fairly dark and leaves a 2 finger coffee head. As this slowly fades to a thin layer, it leaves thick lacing on the glass. This remains present through the glass
S: Initially I am hit with chocolate, but this is short lived. A quick hit of roasted malt is overtaken with smoke and tobacco. Hops follow behind, which surprised me given it's now about 4 months old. There is also some dark fruit and small hint of alcohol
T: First reaction was sweet and smokey. Definite soy sauce presence (first beer I've really picked up on that flavor). Minor notes of chocolate and tobacco. Also some dark fruit. Finishes dry with sweet soy sauce
M: Full bodied. Light, but sharp carbonation. Dark fruit and roasted malt aftertaste
D: Considering the hype, this one falls short for me. The sweetness is slightly overbearing and there's no balance. The alcohol is hidden which is a plus. Won't seek out again 951 charactersBrez07, Feb 15, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +12%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Dark, rich mocha color - cannot see through the glass. Thick 2-3 finger head. Looks tasty!
S - Smells of caramel, chocolate and some bitterness with the hops. Smell is smoother than other Imperials....
T - Can I say Heaven without being too cliche? Taste is smooth, hints of citrus with the hops, but not overpowering. Lots of dark chocolate and malts. A little bitter, but perfect amount. 
M - Carbonation was typical - creamy and smooth. Goes down easy. 
D - Split the bottle with my husband and some neighbors - let's just say I would have licked the bottom of the glass if I could have. Overall a delicious beer that was worth the price (I paid a bit over retail...eek!) and the wait! By far one of the best I have tried! 729 charactersMamaMeier, Feb 14, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -8.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a snifter. 2010 vintage.
5.0 A: Pours black. About three fingers of thick, mostly creamy, secondarily frothy medium-brown-colored head. Very good retention and lacing covering most of the glass.
4.5 S: Mighty chocolaty is my first impression. This has a great mixture of roasty and sweet aromas with the sweet being moderately stronger. Hops are readily apparent in the form of herbal and citrus. Sweet caramel, a touch of smoke, and some toastiness to cap it off. Very nice.
4.0 T: Taste is pretty good, though somewhat disappointing based on the nose. This isn't nearly as sweet as the nose suggests. Rather, hop bitterness is apparent and hop flavor is nearly as strong as the malts. Hop flavor comes in the form of citrusy orange, herbalness, and a touch of spiciness. Malts contribute milk chocolate, caramel, molasses, anise, a touch of smoke and fruitiness in the form of plum, prune, and parsimmon. The malts aren't big and powerful like I like, but this is still pretty tasty. 
3.5 M: Heavier medium body. Not the thick, rich imperial stout I was looking for. Moderate carbonation is a bit "dead" leaving the beer limp and heavy on the touch. However, this has a good creaminess to it and it otherwise smooth.
3.5 D: Gave this a 3.5 because the taste was a borderline 3.5. This is easily the best hoppy imperial stout out there, but I'm not that big of a fan of that approach to stouts. I like big malty flavors and low hop contribution. Still, this is a pretty tasty and I think this will be damn good once the hops have time to fade. 1,561 charactersDavoleBomb, Feb 13, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Major thanks to GatorBeerNerd for this 2010 vintage bottle, poured into an oversized snifter. A huge mousselike initial head shrinks to a thick skim that sticks around for a while. A fair amount of lacing is left behind.
Intense roast in the nose, plenty of burnt and chocolate malts. The blackberry and alcohol combo lends a liqueur quality rather than a boozy presence. Thickish body with very modest carbonation and a slick feel. It's a surprisingly smooth drinker in spite of the impressive lingering bitterness (this must have been a hop monster fresh). Loads of roast and dark chocolate flavor and a nice dose of juicy citrus. Very warming but never boozy; sherry up front, blackberry liqueur or perhaps port in the finish. 
Overall impression: A badass stout, definitely worth seeking out. 798 charactersPDXHops, Feb 09, 2011

Pours inky black with some frothed thinner light brown head with swirls of lacing and film around the glass. 
Slight sweetness in the nose with cherry and raisins, charred malt creates roasted warmth, hint of alcohol. 
Smack of dark fruit sweetness with cherry and raisin. Roasted malts with chocolate and molasses. Syrupy and rich and a slight char from the malty backbone. Little hop flair with pleasant juiciness and cherry fruit. Finishes with alcohol warmth and some lingering dry sweetness. 
Full syrupy body, lower carbonation, sticky and chewy. Drinks really smooth and easy with a delicious silky body. Darkness creates a nice mix of fruit and chocolate tempered by alcohol heat and slight hop bitterness. 787 charactersxnicknj, Feb 06, 2011

It smells of deep, dark roasted malt and that's about it. The coffee is subtle, the rest of it was expected. I hoped this beer was the equivalent to Darklord but I was wrong. It is coffee, sweet, chocolate and roast. This is cloyingly sweet. The balance is questionable at best. God, I wanted so much more. It is very smooth though and drinks like a champ. It's drinkable, yet too sweet. The complexities aren't there. 544 charactersaasher, Jan 29, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5It poured a delicious black and had a pretty steady head on it. The taste was amazing, it had a nice fig, roast, and chocolate. The mouthfeel was quite thin but it did not take away anything from the beer. After being poured it smells of a really sweet dark chocolate w/ a slight fig and raisin. Overall for being 10.3% ABV, it is easily drinkable, almost way too easy. Darkness was probably one of the most amazing stouts I have tasted so far. I am amazed at how good the fig taste goes with the dark chocolate and roast. I wish I had a Fig Newton to try with it. 564 charactersPaulStoneAnchor, Jan 29, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Today is my 28th birthday! So in honor, I am going to do an epic Darkness tasting with some friends. 2008 / 2009 / 2010 vintages! I have been waiting so long to try these. Let's hope I'm not disappointed:
2008
A: Super dark with a small tan head that fades quickly to a small bubbly lace atop the brew. Good.
S: Smells of some awesome cocoa and vanilla upfront blended with some great boozy chocolate quickly followed by licorice and some great earthy qualities. Very good.
T: Awesome flavors! Some nice chocolate raisin upfront blended with some great boozy vanilla and quickly followed by cocoa in the middle. Some nice espresso flavors on the backend. Amazing!
M: Super thick with a great carbonation. A nice creamy finish. Very good!
D: Once you get past the booziness, this goes down. Good.
2009
A: Follows suit with the '08. Very dark with a small tan head that fades to more of a bubbly lace than the '08. Good.
S:Very mild scents on this one. The '08 smelled to great, but this is hard to find strong scents. Some earthy chocolate blended in. Ok.
T: Not as boozy as the '08. It's kind of like a watery hop on the backend. Some mild chocolate vanilla and cocoa upfront with some great creaminess in the middle. Good.
M: A watery thickness with a little more carbonation than the '08. A watery creamy finish. Good.
D: Goes down a little easier than the '08 with the better blend of booze, but the watery taste makes it slightly odd. Can't put my finger on it. Decent.
2010
A: The best looking one of the 3 years. A 1 inch dark mocha colored head that fades at decent pace but never really goes away completely. Very good.
S:Some creamy sweet chocolate upfront with some earthiness in the middle. Not much on the backend. Good.
T: Kind of a soapy chocolate with some faint vanilla in the middle. The worst of the bunch IMO. Decent.
M: A medium body with a decent carbonation. Kind of a dry finish. Decent
D: Goes down good.
All in all, so glad I got to try these. '08 was definitely my favorite. It was so BIG and intense and boozy blended with the strongest flavors. If you hunt one of these IMO, try to go for the '08. The '09 would be my second, and the '10 would be my last. Continue brewing great beer Surly. 2,222 characterssteve8robin, Jan 29, 2011
3.6/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5The 2010 Vampire
Poured into 3 ounce tasting glasses. Poured a very viscous black. Gave it a violent pour and it lead to a very faint, mocca head. It smelled immediately of cinnamon and raisins. The taste didnt hold any cinnamon but the raisins continued to shine, almost tasted like burnt raisins. Very sweet. The sweetness continued to shine and amplify with every sip. The barreling didn't really come through with this one for me, expected more oak. Mouthfeel is okay, very carbonated. I think a year of cellaring will make this one into a hell of a beast. Drinkability was nice, but again a little less carbonation and I could have drank a lot more. Looking forward to tasting some older vintages. 702 charactersvissai, Jan 28, 2011

Darkness is Spreading!! Black and unholy. Iniquitous roastiness, some vile smoke, depraved chocolate, nefarious hop bitterness, a corrupt nuttiness. It fills me with wickedness, my glass shudders from the weight of the moment. Omar, you are a sick man..Exceptionally drinkable. The year has been kind to this beer. 373 charactersdragonWhale, Jan 19, 2011
3.24/5  rDev -26.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 32010 Vintage
Appearance: Pours oily, dark, and menacing with a fat cocoa colored head which fades into a thin cap. Looks awesome.
Aroma: Boozy, hoppy, sweet, mildly roasty. Alcoholic esters. Dark fruit and baker's chocolate. Not tremendously appealing to be honest.
Taste: Dark dried fruit, alcohol, faint roast. Sweet and hoppy, significant but not overpowering bitterness. Smoothness mid palate. Dark chocolate. 
Mouthfeel: Nice and rich without being heavy. Good amount of medium but not prickly carbonation.
Drinkability: My 1/3 of a bottle is a good amount. Not
loving it, but not difficult to drink by any means. 623 charactersMrFootstones, Jan 15, 2011

3.73/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Ah, Surly Darkness. Second time around. Wasn't really a big fan of the '08 and '09, but trying to keep an open mind. Served this chilled, in a sniter, from a 750 ml bottle. I allowed this to warm a bit before sampling.
Appearance: Darkness pours out a deep dark black hole black. This is one black beer! You could hold a flash light to this thing and not see through it. The name fits it perfectly. A rather gentle pour yields about three quarters of an inch of coffee brown head. Head lasts for a bit. Head slowly faded into a thickish gob of foam. A rather generous amount of webby lace was left behind.
Smell: A beast of a brew. Alcohol hammers the nose first and just about clears the sinuses. Slight hints of chocolate, cofee, and molasses. Dark fruit- Prune? maybe some fig and raisin. Some hops are noticeable. Smells like it is sweet.
Taste: Here we go. Taste somewhat mimics the smell. Alcohol seems a bit more subdued. Again, a bit hoppy. Chocolate is there, coffee isn't. Hints of raisin and prune. Somewhat sweet. Finishes with more alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is chewy and thick. Full bodied with lower carbonation. 
Drinkability: Notthe most drinkable beer I've ever had. Alcohol and sweetness are a bit much. Give me a Kate over this any day! 1,265 charactersjaxon53, Jan 09, 2011

A. Poured a very thick 2 finger dark tan head. Very thick head. Excellent retention. Very thick lacing left. Color is all black. Head last forever. This is what the an Imperial Stout should look like. 
S. Chocolate, roasted malt, some coffee. I pick up some dark fruit, interestingly enough. Not overpowering and very balanced. Not as big a smell as I was expecting. 
T. Wow. This beer is delicous. Super balanced and very easy to put down. Has quite a bit of chocolate flavor. Some coffee, but just enough to add flavor and complexity. Maybe one of the smoothest Imperial Stouts I have had so far. 
M. Full bodied. Really nice mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Finishes with a lingering sweetness. 
D. Extremely drinkable. This is an excellent beer. Super smooth and very flavorful at the same time. Had a nice chocolate flavor for me that I really like. I was expecting a lot and I was not disappointed. 965 characterssiradmiralnelson, Jan 08, 2011

A.
A nice dark black stout. The bar wasn't too lit so I couldn't hold it up to the light to see if brown/red hues coming through but it was still a nice looking beer. About 1 fingers worth of brown head. 
S.
not as strong as I thought it would be. I was expecting some deep coffee and chocolate notes but I was pretty surprised. I get some dark fruits, like prunes, deep roasted malts and a little hop aroma. I was hoping for something a little stronger, more prevalent. 
T.
a little disappointing here. Perhaps I just had too high expectations for a one day release beer? A very deep roasty beer, some dark fruit (mainly prune) taste to it. It was fairly sweet as well. Perhaps subtle chocolate notes in there. A little bitterness towards the end then kinda drys out the mouth a little.
M.
definitely full bodied. Good amount of carbonation. A slight slick feel but relatively smooth going down. As said previously, a slight dry aftertaste as well but enjoyable on the mouth.
D.
I wouldn't give this too high. Just an above average RIS for me honestly. Combine it with the price, availability, the hype and the overall flavor, I doubt I'd be seeking this out again. I have a bottle of 2010 at home and I'll probably let that age for a year or so and see what a difference cellaring the beer does. 1,346 characterscetherid, Jan 07, 2011

Poured a stunning thick black with a thin tan head into a Darkness glass. This brew smells of vanilla, hops, and even licorice or good and plenty. The hops really add a nice element to this RIS. The beer is thick and wonderful, pretty sweet but the hops add such a nice element. Has a nice tingle to it, this one was my fav of the tasting.

decided to pop open my first 2011 bottle for the giant game. pried open the waxed cap and filled my 2010 surly snifter. poured a silky shiny black with a generous frothy mocha frappacino like head that hung out for a while after it built like a guiness. the head was milky and chunky and bubbled away slowly, but was there for the duration. looks awesome. much like last year, i get a bit of a hoppy vanilla. some roastiness, but milked over. the hops give it an almost charred smell. BAM - there's that flavor. what a fricken beer. i forgot how much i love this beer. a bit on the sweeter side than i had remembered, but the hopping gives the roastiness some balls. really enjoyable.

removed the wax, decapped and filled my new darkness snifter. brew poured a deep dark ominous, yet slightly watery black. as the beer settled in my glass it embodied the name of the beer. a finger and a half of off white-acino looking head appeared on the surface. as the head dissipated it left thick foamy lacing on the glass. inviting and menacing! wonderful black malt with a solid amount of roast and a great hop to balance things out. some bitter coffee and chocolate notes on the nose as well. nice hoppy stout (actually kind of reminds me of hoppy stout from greenport harbor). a bit of char. really just a phenomenal beer. big bold and roasty with a slight amount of char on the feel. overall, one of my favorite stouts. great year after year. 2,021 characterscosmicevan, Jan 06, 2011

Pours thick and viscous, black. Three fingers of thick, dark tan head slowly forms and recedes even slower, leaving a lot of lacing behind...
Aroma is very rich and deep. Roasted malts on top of a dark fruit sweetness. Semi-sweet, slightly bitter bakers chocolate add richness that is cut by some roasted, coffee bitterness and a little bit of smoke. Beer has layers of underlying sweetness, prunes and/or figs. Complex, but subtle and delicious...
Sweet, but not too much so. Dark fruits, mildly bitter, intense chocolate flavors when you lick your lips. Smoky and dry in the finish. Complex, rich, delicious. This beer kicks the crap out of bottled Dark Lord any day...
Full bodied, thick but not painfully so. Incredibly smooth and flavorful, all meld together perfectly... 861 charactershawks10, Jan 05, 2011

This had been one of my top wants. I'm glad I was able to knock this off my list. I wish I could say I was blown away. Unfortunately the Darkness didn't lead up to the hype that I was expecting. 
A- Pours jet black as a normal head would dark brown with a small head. 
S- I expected more layers from this. I was hoping for the complexities to really show. I get a lot of malts and a faint hint of dried fruits maybe a prunes???
T- Lot of malts and again the flavor of prunes. I wouldn't consider it bad, just nothing amazing. 
M- Very thick. Like drinking a milkshake. This was the best aspect of the beer.
D- Overall this is a great beer. I might just stick with the Old Raspy and not have to worry about the trade. Darkness is a great representation of a RIS. The hype train has grabbed on and won't let go. 910 charactersPatchmaster, Jan 02, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This beer has been easily in my top 5 wants for a couple of years. I was finally able to land not one but 2 bottles from a great trader. This bottle is the 2010 version. The beer was served cold and will be allowed to warm up. First impressions really came up short but I reminded myself the beer is far too cold. So here is hoping my patience is rewarded. In the end my patience was rewarded. The beer has a lot of hype to live up too. My verdict this beer easily stands up to at least 85% of the hype. 
Appearance: I am a sucker for beer that pours a straight black. An occasional ruby highlight manages to penetrate but not for long. The head of the beer s a dark burnt tan coloration. The head resolved into a thin ring of burnt tan foam. Lacing rings my glass as the beer is consumed.
Smell: After waiting for 20 minutes for the beer to warm up the beer started to shine. Darkly roasted and lightly charred aromas start to rise out of the glass. Dark fruits figs, prunes and dates combine with a flash of citrus, citrus zest, tiny amounts of smoke and yes even a suggestion of candied pine cones. Well played!
Taste: The flavor has dark roasted and a bit burnt on the malt. A bit of powdery cocoa lots and lots of dark fruits stewed together definitely figs and date. The citrus cuts across the flavor pleasingly. Brown sugar and molasses wrap around a brief pine cone flavor. The char of the malt keeps the malty nature of this beer in check. 
Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is full. In spite of the full body the beer wears a wonder bra. The mouth feel is no where near as thick as I was hoping for. Made me wonder where all the curves went. Light carbonation breaks the body up a bit. Dam near a perfect beer! I love the roasted and fruit notes. Alcohol is present in all layers of the beers experience but for me only tends to accentuate the beers strong points. 1,891 charactersnlmartin, Jan 01, 2011

Huge thanks to thehand for sharing a 2008,'09, & '10 vertical, recently.
This will be a review of the 2010 bottle.
This one pours thick and black, as expected, from it's name. It has a very nice head of milk chocolate colored foam, about a finger thick, that just stays and stays. The lacing is almost non-existant, surprisingly (but it still looks damn-near perfect).
Tons of chocolate and roastiness dominate. Very mild hints of coffee. Light traces of hops. Mild touches of smoke and some dark fruit sweetness.
It begins with some dark fruit sweetness and a good deal of chocolate. An almost lacto-like sweetness appears and then sinks away again. Then comes a hint of smoke/char, which brings on the big, dry, roastiness, which mostly dominates the flavor profile. The finish has a good hint of hop bitterness to it.
Overall a fairly well balanced stout. I like it.
This is nicely full-bodied, but not thick, like I'd hoped for. It has a mild-to-medium level of carbonation, which works for it, as far as smoothness goes. It lacks a good deal of creaminess though, which I was certainly hoping for.
This is more silky than chewy.
Okay, for 10.30%abv, this is dangerously smooth and drinkable. This is where Darkness shines for me. I'd love to have 4 to 6 bottles that could be consumed over the course of an evening. 1,403 characterscoldmeat23, Dec 30, 2010

4.28/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been fortunate enough so far to have acquired two bottles of the 2010 Vampire vintage through trades. I'm an Eagles fan, so when DeSean Jackson decided to stick a dagger in the Giants' hearts, I knew it was time for this Surly beast.
The appearance is absolutely hands-down amazing. Dark, huge tan head, brilliant lacing that clings to the glass. The only huge stout that's looked better has been Deschutes' Abyss. Which I suppose is fitting, because those are dark too.
After looking at it for what seemed like hours (and was really seconds) I gave it a sniff. Not that impressive. Chocolate and coffee malts came through, but despite the big head this didn't have a big nose. Its taste was also subdued. Not to say I didn't love it, because it was exactly how it should taste, but it didn't blow me away like the appearance.
Surly's Russian Imperial Stout still fills the mouth well with its full-body, and honestly I've always been scared of Russians and vampires, but I'd still return to this one - especiallyi f it were off the shelf and didn't require trading. 
I'd also love to see how it ages. Probably upside down or in a coffin or something. 1,160 charactersafksports, Dec 29, 2010

Taste, reminiscient of dark lord, but a little thinner. Sweet, dark sugar. This really is right up the alley of a traditional RIS, sweet, not super thick, no coffee, chocolate seemed to be on the lacking side for any kind of stout. Boozy, didn't pick up any vanilla, lots of wood, probably oak, oak was all over this. 
Was comparable to tenfidy also. Not my favorite RIS, but definitely solid. But I'd rather have coffee bender, abrasive, furious or wet. This would be no big deal if it was in a can. 600 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Dec 27, 2010

Poured pitch black with a nice 2 finger head. A great looking beer. 
The smell of this beer is of dark fruit and molasses.
The taste is of smooth dark late but not overbearing. I thought it would be a little fuller than it was. Still great just not what I expected. 
The mouthfeel was awesome. This beer does not taste like a 10.3% beer at all. It is without a doubt one of the easiest beers to drink (of this style) that I have ever had.

A - Black, with a little brown showing at the edges. Billowing beige head of 2 fingers is retained well and leaves elaborate lacing on the inside of the glass. Very unusual for an RIS, but it looks great.
S - Strong, assertive nose features fresh coffee beans, dark fruits, and molasses. A subtle hint of dark chocolate as well. I'd like a candle with this scent. Only Dark Lord and BCBCS smell better.
T - Everything from the nose, in delicate balance. A bit of anise in the aftertaste. Very very tasty.
M and D - Smooth, medium to full body, with decent carbonation, maybe a touch more than is usual for the style. A little syrupy but not cloying, this is one to sip and savor. Excellent brew. 872 charactersAJacob81, Dec 22, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 42010 Vintage.
Poured opaque black (like all big stouts) with moderate tan head. Nose is unexpectedly full of citrus hops (I knew this was hoppy, but damn). Citrus hops overlay the chocolate/roasted malts underneath. Flavor is big, with serious citrus and pine hops rushing over a big sweet stout base. Carbonation is a bit high on this guy, with corresponding thinness of body. Easy drinker, though, due to the carbonation.
This was a bit of a let-down for me... I was looking for a life-changing event, but this was not it. Struck me as more of a black IPA, which is good. The carbonation made the really nice and robust flavor difficult to access, it kind of diluted the flavor or washed it away too quickly. As it warmed, the beer really has a unique and wonderful flavor, but some of the details are a bit off, in my opinion. 831 charactersLordAdmNelson, Dec 22, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422oz into 6oz tasting glass. 2010 release. Thanks to afksports.
Dark - unable to tell if it is deep brown or black but the head is a fair tan; no lacing.
Cocoa nib in the front, full roasted malt takes over. 
Flavor is a robust roasted malt which becomes very sweet; the finish is perfect bit I wish there was more complexity in the initial flavor. This isn't a slight so much as enhanced expectation based on reputation. This is certainly an above average RIS.
The mouthfeel is perfect. The carbonation, weight of the brew, taste and viscosity are all well matched.
I would certainly drink, and would drink it over damn near all the off the shelf options to which i have frequent access.

2009 release
A: Pours very dark and rich, with a nice head that seems solid enough to eat at first but recedes quickly. Gorgeous lacing as it slowly recedes. Doesn't appear to be as thick as I was expecting, but that's not a bad thing. 
S: Very strong smell of roasted molasses, overwhelming any other flavors. 
T: Dark chocolate, roasted malt, and molasses. Very warm, with the alcohol following all the way down. Once you get past the initial powerful hit, you pick up some brown sugar and a sweet, full-bodied fruitiness. The molasses and malt definitely overpowers everything else. It would have been interesting to try this both fresh, and with another year in the bottle. 
M: A bit thinner than I was expecting, but still a slky, viscous feel that sits quite well. 
D: It's unfortunately a bit hard to rate this beer as objectively as I would like (my earlier find this evening is clouding my judgment). It is quite good, although a little bit more harsh than I would like. Another year in the bottle would have been interesting. It doesn't quite measure up to the hype, but don't get me wrong. I'd drink it again at the drop of a proverbial (or literal) hat. 1,225 charactersmjyoung, Dec 19, 2010

A: Pours jet black with a thin, dense, dark brown head that faded into a bubbly collar and left a web of thin lacing down the glass.
S: Big roasted notes of dark malts and molasses. There is a fair amount of alcohol vapor. I pick up sweet notes of dark fruits as well. 
T: Very sweet and sugary with big notes of molasses, brown sugar, and chocolate covered berries. There is a sweet fruitiness to this beer that I just can't tack down. Finish is syrupy and sweet and the aftertaste is lightly roasted and bitter. 
M: Alcohol adds some warm viscosity to the mouth. Body is full and thick, but not as thick as possible. Goes down sweet and smooth and is even a little spritzy in the finish. 
D: Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing beer and deserves a very high score. It's one of the better RIS I've had, but I was actually expecting a little more given all the hype around it. I would drink this as often as I could if I was able to, but I think even something like Ten FIDY in a four pack off the shelf is pretty damn comparable. 1,177 charactersscottfrie, Dec 19, 2010

A - pours a pitch black, much like the namesake with a 1 finger pillowy head.
S - roasty and dry nose with espresso and bitter chocolate. Some hops as well.
T - very roasty, surprisingly much drier than I expected. Nice floral hops as well - fairly unexpected.
M - For such a sought after beer, its a little thin. It lacks a bit of complexity, but I did enjoy the dryness.
D - It's a big beer, but fairly drinkable. This isn't necessarily a dessert beer as it isn't cloyingly sweet, could actually pair with a sweet bbq. 602 charactersteamizm, Dec 14, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 version
Appearance: It's weakest, which doesn't say much as I've still given it a 5. Near Jet-Black and one of the darkest brews I've ever seen. It's rich and frothy mocha head teases you to take a drink, no begs you. Slight lace retention, though unimpressive. If there is a weak point in this beer, lace retention would be it. However, I feel it's not a very important aspect.
Smell: Devastatingly powerful. One whiff knocks you onto your hills. Deep, milk chocolate and espresso welcomes the nostrils with undertones of vanilla, cherry and hops.
Taste: Strong hints of chocolate, coffee and slight vanilla notes. A very warming beer invites you to a wonderland of flavor. Sweet and roasty chocolate. If Willy Wonka Brewed beer, this would be it.
Mouthfeel. Thick, strong, syrupy, full. These are are appropriate adjectives.
Drinkability: The scariest thing about this beer isn't the vampire on the label, it's the drinkability of this beer. At 10.x% ABV, this titan of flavor and smoothness' scariest attribute is how quickly you can down it. Without realizing it, I drank half the bottle in only a few gulps.
I've never given a perfect score to any beer, not even an A+. I've always waited for that one beer that would destroy every sense of reality that I had to give out such an honor... but here it is... Surly Darkness.... and it does not disappoint. 1,369 charactersBmuncy, Dec 10, 2010

Pours a not quite jet black, viscous brew, a creamy finger and a half of mocha head which sticks around for the duration. Nice.
Nose initially reveals a nice roast, chocolate, coffee character blended with a fresh leafy hop kick, beautifully integrated. Then rich mocha, hints of smooth espresso (not the acrid stuff from Starbucks!), dark chocolate and milk chocolate, cocoa powder, clean earthy roasted malts, hint of molasses, vanilla. The mouthfeel on this is standout, so smooth and creamy without ever being syrupy, aided by just the right hop bite and dryness. Not too sweet, just so fine. Alcohol so well hidden. Perhaps not the most complex of the big beers but this is perhaps the most balanced, drinkable of the big RIS's I've had - which is a real talent. Thanks a ton Eric! 883 charactersritzkiss, Dec 08, 2010

Jet black viscous pour with a mocha head that stays the course. Smooth aroma of chocolate and coffee with light vanilla. Relatively simple flavour has chocolate and medium coffee roast along with hints of smoke. While the flavour is very pleasant, there are a few things that really stand out for me in this brew. Firstly, its incredibly balanced. Secondly, the mouthfeel is exceptional - full and smooth. Finally, for its weight it might just be the most drinkable imperial I've come across. 549 charactersbobsy, Dec 08, 2010

The smell was different. I picked up an olive, wine, plum like smells.
The taste was that of a thick, and powerful potion, with a middling bitter at the end. It was good, but not one to drink in mass quantities. It's one that I'll try again at the next release. 407 charactersTCMike, Dec 05, 2010

S- Milk chocolate and roasted malts dominate.
T-Chocolate and roast blend but not what I expected from this very hyped beer. I was left wanting, it is a decent stout but nothing exceptional. 
M-Medium full bodied, would have preferred a more viscous fluid to chew on.

The beer pours pitch black into a tulip with a big creamy looking tan head that sits atop the beer retaining itself very nicely. The aroma is very chocolatey initially with big roasty aromas lingering in the background with dark fruit and a bit of charred kind of smoke characteristics. The taste follows the smell pretty well. Really enjoyable roasty flavors with chocolate undertones. The beer is slightly sweet with a bit of hoppy bitterness in the finish. All around very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is very thick and chewy. Light carbonation and a robust body make it great. Definitely an great one but at a big 10.3 this one hides the alcohol very well, but still ends up being a sipper. 781 charactersBendurgin, Nov 29, 2010

There is an overwhelming aroma of chocolate. A bit of hop aroma is noticed, but it is quite secondary.
The taste starts out sweet and chocolatey. The roasted flavor is relatively mild here. Most bitterness that is detected is in the finish and I would attribute it to a hoppy bitterness.
The mouthfeel is full and smooth. This is a thick brew. The carbonation is appropriately smooth, and not prickly.
This is a really big, kind of sweet stout. A very good offering. 639 charactersandrewinski1, Nov 29, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 vintage poured into snifter
Appearance - Pours like used motor oil; rich, dark and creamy. A semi-hard pour yields a nice cinnamon colored head which thins as you drink. 
Smell - Notes of hops just as the bottle was cracked, once poured chocolate creamy stouty goodness fills the nose, little bit of coffee scent
Taste - chocolate and roasted flavors up front that lead to a very nice lingering finish, tiny bit of smoke flavor and some hops. The sweetness is always there but not too much. 
Mouth - very full in body, perfectly carbonated, extremely velvety smooth, slides right down...
Drinkability - simply amazing, want to keep on putting it down which is dangerous with the ~10% abv... 700 charactersSurlyMe, Nov 29, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Kind of dumb luck this happened to be review 100. I've had the '08, '09 and '10 versions. Review for '10 release.
A - Pours a rich viscous black with a deep tan head. The head is amazing, thick with tiny bubbles. No brown around the edges. Black
S - This vintage is probably my least favorite overall and it starts with the nose. I get roast and chocolate. Some sweeter fruit notes as it warms. No hops which I miss from '08.
T - Coffee, chocolate and some bitterness in the back, probably from the chocolate malts. As it warms the sugars start to coat your tongue and the fig and molasses come out. Hints of alcohol as it warms going down
M - Rich and viscous, much like it looks and tastes...very full bodied.
D - This is a sipper to be sure. There are a lot of flavors going on here and a 10%+ be carefull. This is very good, a bit sweet.
Overall I'd have to say this is not my favorit vintage but still very good. I miss the hops that the '08 version had. Again, a good beer, one I'll keep going back for 1,014 charactersboomer31, Nov 27, 2010

A: Quite dark. Distinguished itself in a heavy lineup. Thick and lo-carb of course, but produces a fair finger thickness tan head that slowly dissipates into a tightly knit ring.
S: Malt extract and stout reduction. Some volatile acids apparent, but not in an offensive way. Nothing exceptional, but smells delicious.
T: Malt extract again here, with a lightly burnt roast edge. Chocolate not as pronounced as expected, and there is a light sharpness from acidity and/or hops that keeps this fairly 'fresh.'
M: Lighter than anticipated. Not significantly heftier than alot of normal production stouts, which isn't a bad thing. Not palate fatiguing. Full bodied.
D: For a big beer, I could see this getting dangerous. Good enough to want more. Goes down almost too easily.
An excellent brew that I'd gladly trade for again. Worth seeking out. 921 charactersoregone, Nov 25, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Cafe 28 the other day. This was the 2010 Darkness and was vastly superior, I thought, to the bottled version I had some years back.
The beer pours a blackish brown color with an impressive looking, coffee colored, long lasting head. Head retention is very good in this beer, and there is considerable sicky lacing all around. The nose is equally attractive in this beer, showcasing dark chocolage, light coffee, vanilla, cherry and light licorise. The flavor profile replicates the nose, but if anything, is even more impressive. There is some nice, light hoppy bitterness in the finish, which really blends well with the licorise, cherry and vanilla. Also, the dark chocolate really comes through on the palate, making is a very delicious, easy to drink beer. Mouthfeel is full, with a very long finish. The beer is fairly soft on the palate, but comes across as very potent as well. This was a beer that seemed to improve and become ever more delicious as it warmed in the glass. Drinkability was pretty good, though you can certainly tell that the abv. was up there in this beer.
Very imperssive and an absolute treat to have on draft. Yummm.... 1,160 charactersJohn_M, Nov 24, 2010

2010 bottle poured into a snifter appears black in color with some lighter brown coloration around the edges. A dark creamy brown head appears and retains fairly well. As it slowly recedes, it leaves a spotty amount of lace along the glass.
The aroma of this brew includes a pleasant blend of citrus hops that are a little herbal with chocolate and a sweet grainy scent. A minor indication of some yeast character is present but is faint in comparison to the chocolate maltiness and hops.
The taste of this brew includes citrus hops that have a bit of herbal quality as well. Quite a solid base of chocolate that is more of a bitter dark chocolate than milky sweet. The hops provide a bit of mineral touch that is earthy with a light indication of yeast.
This is a super smooth brew with a creamy full feel that is lightly carbonated. A pleasant alcohol warmth hits the back of the throat but not with the intensity you would expect from something with more than 10% abv. Once this brew warms it has some coffee bean quality that is also citrusy. This is a must try stout, awesome to try right now. 1,176 charactersstakem, Nov 22, 2010

Has an aroma of roast, candy sugar, and cherry. Has a roasty caramel taste with some cherry notes throughout and a nice velvety chocolate finish. Gentle bitter hit. Creamy mouthfeel. For this hoplover, this beer is pefect to drink now as the gentle bitters add a bit to the complexity. As it ages the hops will fade and with the beer already being mellow, not sure how much aging will add. 499 characterschalsk, Nov 22, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Darkness snifter at Cafe 28 in Mpls. Beautiful 1 inch head of bubbly tan that left only a bit of lacing down the glass.
The aroma is milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla, and only a bit of tart cheeries.
The taste is a perfect reflection of the aroma. Despite the 10% ABV, this is not hot in the least.
This is oily and smooth with medium carbonation. Despite the smoothness, it's a little dry on the finish, which I think is a good thing. It doesn't linger too long, which entices you for another sip.
This is the perfect dessert drink. Was the perfect accompaniment to the molten chocolate cake I had at Cafe 28. 629 charactersBuckeyeOne, Nov 20, 2010

Appearance -- Pours jet black without one iota of highlight and one finger of mocha head that soon falls to a dirty halo. Wide bands of tan lace.
Smell -- Well-roasted malts in the forefront, nearly to the point of smelling burnt, along with dark chocolate, cherry bonbon, and faint woodsmoke. Lovely.
Taste -- Deep roasted malt, molasses, prune, cherry bonbon, coffee with cream, char, and a hint of woodsmoke. Hops are quite assertive, lending a cool herbal flavor to the finish. Lingering flavors of chocolate cherry, herbal hops and char.
Mouthfeel -- Full-bodied, though not terribly viscous, with gentler carbonation. Quite smooth. The mouthfeel on this is exceptional.
Drinkablity -- Wow, this RIS is pretty damn good. Quite possibly the best of the Midwest (sorry, Dark Lord). Rich and with great depth of flavor, but not sticky, cloying or out of balance. Hops are great, the mouthfeel is even better. Seek this out on tap. 992 charactersyeahnatenelson, Nov 19, 2010
4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Sheffield's. 
Pours black as night with nary a head to be seen. 
Smells of chocolate, coffee, figs & cherries. 
Initially tastes chocolatey, malty, creamy, with molasses and dark fruit sweetness. The heavy carbonation lends a hint of spiciness then you're hit with a hoppy and relatively smooth finish. As it warms other fruits show up - cherries most notably. It lacks the complexity and heaviness of a lot of imperial stouts. 
For such a dark, thick beer, the mouthfeel is surprisingly light and fizzy - an altogether pleasant experience. 
Highly, dangerously, drinkable. Goes down smoothly. 608 charactersreadbaron, Nov 18, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served in a snifter at The Barley House.
Who'd've thought that one of my personal whales would beach itself 'round here? Hey, I'm not gonna argue. Its pour verifies its name, as nothing but straight darkness sits in the glass, a finger-thick tan chapeau sitting jauntily on top. The nose comprises raisins, rum, blackened oats, figs, chocolate-covered strawberries, roasted malts, light molasses, and a very slight fusel scent streaming from the base. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, figs, oak, brown sugar, light orange flesh, and a touch of Belgian yeastiness. Honestly, the last two were a bit surprising, but definitely can't be considered detracting, as they add a refreshing complexity to a usually brutish style. The body is pretty hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a chewy feel. Overall, I was not at all disappointed by this, though the one thing I would note is that it's a tad lighter and fizzier than I expected. But this was a minor issue at best, smothered by the overall tastiness. 1,056 charactersTMoney2591, Nov 17, 2010

I was so happy that this beer actually found its way to Illinois. This beer is as advertised...Darkness is spreading in my glass. It is adorned by a finger of sandy brown foam with some nice lacing on the glass as it goes down. The smell is of a weaker bourbon, there is a citrus hop aroma, a bit of caramel and what seems to me to be the essence of Belgian yeast. The flavor is bourbon, brown sugar, caramel, hints of vanilla and clove as well to help with the nice complexity of this beer. I found the mouthfeel to be a little too carbonated for me, but that didn't mean it wasn't good. The drinkability is really good. Though it may be high in ABV you really can't tell too much on the palate. It's a really well made beer and I hope to get it again someday. 826 charactersVdubb86, Nov 17, 2010

(A)- Pours thick and pitch black. Produced a minimal tan head, but pretty decent retention. Subtle lacing. 
(S)- Malty and rich. Has a heavy brown sugar/toffee sweetness wit hints of coffee and dark chocolate aspects. Some woody dry notes. 
(T)- Very similar to the smell. Good malts and richness. The same sweet aspects in the smell, yet has an underlying spicy herbal woody notes. As it warms, some nice licorice flavors start showing themselves.
(M)- A good carbonation level and balance. Surprisingly, a bit thinner than I expected it to be; and not quite as rich or heavily roasted. Because of this, it is actually smoother; more balanced, and easier on the palate in my opinion. 
(D)- A solid RIS for sure. It was really nice to see that it was not overly rich, sweet, or viscous as I was expecting; rather, it is far more sessionable because of that. If I could, I would do a whole bottle of this on my own if I felt like it. The drinkability and mouthfeel are where this beer truly shines. In terms of flavor, however, it might need some more time to age. 1,126 characterssweemzander, Nov 16, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had in a snifter out of the only keg I think I'll see in Chicago. Enjoyed this brew with sweemzander.
Poured pitch black with a quarter inch of brown head on it.
The smell was nice, sweet, chocolatey. There were hints of hops but they didn't really stand out.
The taste was also sweet, dark roasted chocolate malt, had a bit of nut and licorice in there towards the back and finished with the essence of hops. As it warmed, the taste grew heavier on the bitterness and had a raisin taste to it within the last few sips.
This beer was well carbonated and just right. No harshness on the tongue.
This was a really nice beer. I wish I could have tried some of the past years to put it up against but I'll take what I can get in trying the 2010 version. It was a great tasting brew and I think it lives up to the hype. 819 characterscjacobsen, Nov 16, 2010

First note I liked this version better on tap than from the bottle, maybe that will change with aging.
Appearance- Dark black with a rich thick chocolaty head that lasts for minutes and leaves a beautiful latticework on the glass.
Aroma- Rich and mysterious with notes of Dark Chocolate and a light dusting of hoppiness.
Taste- Concentrated and complex. It is a stout that requires some thought and serious contemplation. Perhaps a bit sweet and not as bitter as it could be, but it really is a taste that brings you back wanting to figure it out more and more. It aint the 08 darkness but it is much better than 09.
Mouthfeel- Thick and full. It meets a good standard of attenuation for what I want in an RIS.
Drinkability- I could drink a bomber by myself with a cigar and a rooftop. But yeah it is an RIS so don't count on an easy pint.
IMHO better than the 09 & 10 Dark Lord, 09 Darkness, 09 Black Tuesday, and 10 KTG, but I'm a midwest homer so take it with a pinch. 1,036 characterscadaugherty, Nov 15, 2010

Pours pitch black with no light penetration what so ever. Average sized dark brown head.
Damn this beer smells good! and strong! As others have noted it is very sweet, roasted, fruity, chocolaty, smokey and generally dark and damn strong.
The taste is the same thing. It is almost overwhelming. The flavour is good, sweet chocolate, strong coffee, toffee, caramel and fig flavours abound. Overall, the beer is much too sweet. I think that is the major problem.
Feels nice and smooth on the tongue, coats your mouth nicely, the alcohol is also extremely well masked. 
The aroma and taste go right into your head and assault your temples. I had a headache halfway through. I really wanted to like this beer more than I did... It is also way to expensive; I would not buy it again. 880 charactersEwaldEichstaett, Nov 15, 2010

4.36/5  rDev -1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap in a 8 oz. stange at Hopleaf.
Appearance: Darkness is what it says on the bottle, and darkness is what is inside. It pours a midnight blackcolor with just a hint of slightly off-black molasses in the very tip of the glass. Darkness indeed. A creamy dark tan coffee head mellows in its creaminess, then recedes, reforming with every swirl and leaving some unexpected lace on the glass.
Smell: Dark roasted and chocolate malt are packed into the aroma, with espresso and vanilla providing support. Some unidentifiable spiciness is present, along with some pine hops.
Taste: Of course this starts out with a huge roasted and chocolate malt profile, which is very well put together. The bitterness up front seems to be due to the coffee and roasted malt, with the balance shifting between sweet and bitter. There are some dark fruit complexities in the middle - cherry, fig, and raisin. Of course Surly keeps it hopped up a little bit as well, adding even further complexity. But it still finishes a bit sweet, with a touch of alcohol to remind you it is a 10% ABV.
Mouthfeel: Very full body, obviously, with a nice creamy feel. Leaves my lips a bit sticky.
Drinkability: Definitely a well-crafted stout and one I could enjoy frequently, were it available more regularly. Well worth seeking out. 1,310 charactersKickInTheChalice, Nov 12, 2010

Color: 55° SRM
2010 vintage, poured into a generic 10-12 oz tulip at Acadia Cafe, Minneapolis, on 11/11/2010; a few weeks after the release.
Appearance 5/5
Jet black with a dark mocha colored head that is very slow to settle and leaves a fantastic lacing. Perfect.
Aroma 3.5/5
Sweet smelling from malts but with a strong herbal hop aroma followed by hints of dark fruit, even cherries, but no tartness. Weak, however.
Taste 4/5
Yes, there's roast, and there are a lot of hops too, and all of it rides on an excellent base of dark fruit. Begins with a strong raisin-y character, much like a well aged barleywine, but not as strong, and soon the huge hoppiness appears to contrast the initial rich sweetness; plenty of roast joins in towards the finish: the finish is remarkably clean, and astringent to some degree, and the aftertaste is all hoppy and burnt accompanied by some alcohol warming, that is not felt anywhere else. Later, towards the end of the drink, I noticed a lighter sweetness and citrus. Really?!! All of a sudden it's a "Black Barleywine" or what?
Mouthfeel 5/5
Medium to big bodied, silky and coating, with low carbonation. Perfect, again!
Drinkability 4.5/5
Very drinkable, perhaps a little too much!
Other
A very good beer but not worth the hype and effort. But then, which other RIS's are as good? This one sure is outstanding. 1,771 characterstewaris, Nov 11, 2010
4.29/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had this on-tap last night at Small Bar...quite the nice surprise on a Tuesday afternoon when I heard from a friend they were tapping it that evening. If anyone was wondering, no I was not one of the two guys on their laptop surfing BA while at the bar...on to the review.
A: Black in color, with some brown around the edges when held up to a light. Nice 1.5 finger cappuccino colored head that had moderate retention and excellent lacing.
S: The smell was definitely the worst aspect of this beer in my opinion. The smell was not intense whatsoever. There was some faint citrus hoppiness, particularly orange as well as a little bit of alcohol at the finish. The malts were to me, undetectable on the nose, which I found to be a disappointment
T: Lots of milk chocolate up front mixed in with some caramel. With that being said, the beer is not very sweet as some RISs are. There were some nice toasted malt flavors in the middle and a smidgeon of coffee. At the finish, there was a medium-high level of hoppy bitterness for a stout. Overall, there was a nice balance between the malt and hops.
M: Great, thick viscosity, and a nice aftertaste in this beer. The carbonation was a little higher than in some of my favorite stouts, but it worked well in this beer.
D: Overall my first 8 ounce snifter was much, much more drinkable than my second snifter. This wasn't due to fullness or inebriation, but rather I feel the dry hoppiness at the finish caused it to become much more of a slow, sipper over time. With that being said, I felt this was an excellent beer and was very drinkable. I would equate it somewhat to a Goose Island Nightstalker, though not quite as hoppy...more like a blend of Nightstalker and Darklord. The beer has wonderful balance. I would love to try it out of the bottle sometime. 1,809 charactersglazeman, Nov 10, 2010

Pours a pure black color with a large creamy brown head. The aroma was amazing; huge dark fruits, sweet molasses, caramel, chocolates and rich coffee. Sweet plums especially in the amazing nose. The flavor was amazing as well; initial dark fruits give way to a fizzy and bitter hops. The core of this beer though is a rich chocolate, roasted malt and super decadent coffee mix.The flavor is more than just balanced, you can detect tons of hops, tons of fruit and tons of sweetness. The mouthfeel is very creamy and full. The beer leaves a sludgy leg running down the glass. Amazing. One of the best things I've ever drank. Re-rate: had the 2009 edition at the massive Imperial Stout tasting in Boise. Just as good, rich fruits and aggressive flavors. Still, one of my favorites. 909 charactersDouglas88, Nov 10, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4For my 1000th review, I had to choose whether to go with something extremely rare or something nostalgic. Since my last few milestone reviews were Belle Vue Sélection Lambic, Kaggen! Stormaktsporter Rauch, and Cantillon Loerik, I figured it was time for a change of pace, so I picked the first beer for which I traveled to a release party.
This review is an aggregate of all four bottled vintages. Thanks to hoppymeal, northernbrews, and hophobo for supplying vintages '07, '08, and '09 respectively.
(And no, I've never had '06, nor would it be appropriate for this review as it was growler/tap only.)
A - All vintages of Darkness are essentially reference quality Imperial Stout when it comes to appearance. Pours yield a few fingers of dark tan/mocha foam over top of a pitch black body that reveals a sheen of brown at the top of the glass when held up to the light. The head slowly dissipates leaving behind a thin cap and splotchy fingers of lacework. Earlier vintages have slightly worse retention, but all look quite excellent and sufficiently evil.
S - On the other hand, the aroma varies markedly by vintage. The most hop-forward at this stage is '09, with some floral, earthy, leafy, and slightly citrus hop character still present after a year. You can tell '07 was similar when it was bottled as it also features some faded herbal hop notes. The '10 is far more understated in this area, with a floral character that is roughly as potent as the three-year old '07 vintage. Whatever hops were present in '08 are long gone (and they were there, as I remember them when I had it fresh on-tap). Malt character always features sweet dark fruits, figs & prunes, and baker's chocolate, but roast character ranges from fairly intense in '07 to almost non-existent in '08.
T - The taste mirrors the aroma fairly accurately, but there are a few unusual disconnects. '07 features present but well-attenuated hop and char bitterness, as well as dark chocolate and dark roast coffee. '08 tastes largely of cherry cordials, milk chocolate, and dates. '09, even with its still-present hop aroma, is surprisingly high in caramel, molasses, and dark fruits. There is some fairly potent roast character but this is sweeter than I remembered. '10 is most similar to (aged) '07 with roast espresso notes, earthy and herbal bitterness in the finish, and understated sweetness.
M - All vintages are quite similar in this regard. A smooth, creamy, medium-full body that is big enough for the circa 10% alcohol, soft medium-low carbonation, and some light warming alcohol after a few ounces.
D - This is a definitely a sipper, particularly with the sweeter vintages. The 750ml bottles are probably best shared 3-4 ways, and the sugar levels can reach critical after having much more. I find this more drinkable than Dark Lord, but significantly less so than something like Ol' Jack Frost.
It's quite interesting to chart the (d)evolution of the beer and the cautionary tale it can teach about transitioning from small-batch brewing to large-scale production. I'm actually fairly confident the malt bill hasn't changed significantly over the years - what DOES seem to change is the timing and size of hop additions. I wish I'd taken notes on fresh pours of each vintage on-tap, but I do remember that while '08 and '09 both smelled brutally hoppy when first tapped, the hop character vanished from '08 in only a few months. On the plus side, the cloying nature that the '08 displayed after a few months is largely gone, and while certainly sweeter it's actually quite pleasant.
The score is representative solely of the bottles as they tasted circa October 2010. 3,660 charactersMasterSki, Nov 09, 2010
4.16/5  rDev -5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5First off a huge thanks to squirpy7 for hooking me up with a brew that was proving to be more illusive than it should be.
2010 vintage:
A: Poured into my pint glass, this brew pours as dark as the vampire's soul with a dark tan, unrelenting, pillow like cloud of a head that leaves the best lacing I've seen in a stout. Without that lacing, this would be a 4.0.
S: The aroma is lacking complexity and strength right now. Chocolate and roasted malt is present. This stout has a nice hop twist to it. Not pinny, but dark fruit like. Alcohol is present in the nose as the beer warms.
T: The flavor is dominate chocolate and liquorish. The roastedness is masked by a malty sweetness, and just like I expected dark fruit tones from a mix of hops and malt. Alcohol pokes its way through as the beer warms, but is not offensive at all. 
Mf: Mouthfeel is just above good. It can improve with more creaminess and carbonation. It still is smooth and uninhibits this brew's power. Viscous and syrupy. 
D: At 10.3%, and in a 750ml, this brew is quite drinkable. 
Overall, Darkness is a good stout. It's like a mini-Dark Lord. Almost like Surly brewed Dark Lord's younger cousin. This is definitely one to age. It stands out from the other big stouts on the top 100. It lacks notes of espresso with a heavy chocolate base that I've come to love. It can improve with a year in a bourbon barrel; this stout tastes like it was made for it. This thing has a hop bill that makes it unique. Next bottle I trade for will definitely spend 2 years in the cellar. 1,547 charactersTKEbeerman, Nov 08, 2010

S: Not too much of a smell. Some chocolate milk, malts, and brown sugar.
T: Probably the least cloyingly sweet imperial stout I've had. Gets a lot of flavor in, but finishes dry with a little bit of chocolate. Molasses, brown sugar and dark malts.
M: Smooth, not too creamy, kind of syrupy thick.
D: Can barely taste the alcohol. Had a couple of these at Pizza Lucé after 2 years of attempting to be around MN when it was released. 501 characterslhaqq, Nov 08, 2010
4.46/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A bit light and hoppy with the opening aroma. Pours about what you'd expect from a RIS, thick and black with a small tan head. Tastes as Surly describes, but a bit less flavorful than one might expect from such a prestigious and rare brew; it's fantastic but no Dark Lord. The palate is a bit thinner than the pour suggests, not the thick motor oil feel we expect from RIS's, but good none-the-less. Overall it's among the top of it's style, but might not be worth the hype, and for the price I think i'd rather have a couple Goose Island Nightstalker's. 554 charactersDocSkalski, Nov 07, 2010

I love the new vampire bottle design!
A: Pours as dark as the name itself, with about a fingers worth of head that is only a couple of shades lighter than the brew itself.
S: Sweet and fruity (figs?), candy-like, with molasses, and charred-wood. Awesome!
T: Sweet molasses upfront, which blends in perfectly to a chewy chocolate body, and finishes with a mild dark cocoa bitterness. 
M: Not boozy at all, with a honey-like texture, and dark glass lacing. Despite the high octane, this one is remarkable creamy and smooth.
D: There is no bourbon, coffee, barrel-aging, or any other gimmicks in this brew. This is just good old-fashioned brewing. Extremely memorable! 795 charactersChaney, Nov 06, 2010

A - Absolutely pitch-black with a creamy mocha-colored head. Retention is amazing, and the head re-forms itself with every swirl. Sticky lacing is left on the glass as the head (finally) recedes. Beautiful!
S - Dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, molasses and dark dried fruits (figs and prunes).
T - More dark malt, coffee, chocolate, molasses and fruit. Quite sweet but somehow never gets cloyingly so. So smooth tasting, there's no bitterness at all, despite such dark flavors. Just a delicious beer!
M - Thick and creamy with medium-low "prickly" carbonation. Slightly sticky, but still oh-so smooth.
D - While this is certainly a sipper, it's one I could drink all day. I don't know how they make such a sweet, high-alcohol beer this drinkable, I just know I enjoyed the heck out it. 863 charactersjsanford, Nov 03, 2010

S: Sweet malt and dark fruitiness. No coffee or chocolate notes. 
T: Dark and deep. Sweet, like dark figs. Some hoppiness on the finish. This beer is like a sweeter version of The Abyss.

4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Blue Nile.
Used motor oil color and consistency. Cocoa powder brown head that is quite thick and has staying power.
Rich malt and stronger than usual hop presence for the style. Chocolate, lightly smokey with a bit of coffee. The hops are mostly grassy with just a touch of citrus.
Delicious rich chocolate malt with notes of coffee and smoke. Light vanilla presence and generously hopped. The hops are lightly citric and also add some grassy notes. Big and robust flavor all around. The sweetness is up there a ways, but it's not too much in my opinion.
Velvety feeling and full bodied. Just slithers down the palate.
I could have one of these every day for the rest of my life and die a happy man. This is surely a top notch RIS and one that I will consume as much as possible. Worth all of the hype. 821 charactersjera1350, Oct 31, 2010
3.83/5  rDev -13.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Vintage 2009 bottle I picked up last year and have been saving for either something special or whenever October rolled around again.
Appearance: Black like night. Thin foamy tan head. 
Smell: Sweet, very very sweet. Raisins and Alcohol, I was expecting some chocolate but there isn't any.
Taste: The taste is quite close to the smell, dark and fruity, a bit hoppy. The hoppiness really lingers which I wasn't expecting.
Mouthfeel: Amazing, very very mellow. Theres a bit of zip on the tip of the tongue from the hops, very low carbonation, but really well balanced. Leaves you with the feeling of having a tablespoon of syrup in your mouth.
Drinkability: I think one bottle will be enough for me. The abv doesn't really weigh it down while drinking it, but the sweetness is a bit too much. 
I enjoyed the 2009, but I'd like to see how it has changed in 2010. If the sweetness dropped down a bit I would love it. 917 characterssmm, Oct 31, 2010

T: Roasted malty liquid goodness, chocolate is quite present, with a slight coffee follow-up, and a subtle sweet finish. 
M: Quite thick moderate carbonation, love it.
D: Highly drinkable, @ 10.3%, it was masked extremely well. It is a big beer, very filling, with a lot of substance.

3.81/5  rDev -13.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42010 bottle drank into my Darkness tulip...A dark as midnight night with a huge dark tan head. The head is amazing as it literally arises from beneath the beer foaming up a full four fingers. The head is two colors, dark tan on the bottom with a lighter color on the top. The retention and lacing are amazing...The aroma is muted from the 09 version in terms of the hops as they do not show through. Very malty, lots of sweet milk chocolate with a hint of grass on the back. Not what I was expected, but still pretty decent...The taste thankfully brings out more of the hops as this has a grassy hop backbone from start to finish. A lot of the sweetness is gone, only a little is left but as it warms the hops disappear too. This turns into a really boring beer, so disappointing. 
The 09 version is so much better than this, the 10 is just a big let down. 857 charactersjrallen34, Oct 30, 2010

Appearance: 5.0 - Bottle rocks, and pours direct from the 57 degree cellar, thick into my snifter. Head of about 1 inch and some lacing after it settles. Dark, ominous and a thin head. 
Smell: 4.5 - Loads of caramel and hot damn I would say crushed blueberries on the nose, and a some of the alcohol coming through. Some hops, but not nere what the '09 had. 
Taste: 4.5 - Hits with a sweet chocolaty and caramel note, then the hops and alcohol come calling. Ends with a smokey malt and toasted grain finish. This finish keep s going...like a fine wine...Love this. 
Mouthfeel: 5.0 - This eer hits it for me with the mouthfeel, light and airy almost, but still coats and leaves a finish that keep going and going. This is perfection.
drinkability: 5.0 - Not an over the top alcy bomb, and just has a finish that keeps you wanting more and more. Bravo Omar and Todd!! 1,077 charactersPenguin3200, Oct 27, 2010

4.33/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42009 edition
Pours jet black with about an inch of dark brown creamy head. Beer looks very "alive" so to speak and is about as nice as you can expect a RIS to look.
Nose is pleasant with mostly notes of chocolate. Not what I would call a strong smell (in contrast I found the taste much stronger and distinct) but still a very pleasant one with minimal sense of alcohol.
Taste makes me think of chocolate milk.... to me that seems like the overpowering note, which I enjoyed immensely. Coffee there too and a few slight underlying flavors that my palate isn't good enough to identify with certainty. The longer I drink it the more the sweetness of the beer starts to take front stage, but never to the point of being overpowering.
Keeping with the chocolate milk theme, the mouthfeel is fantastic. As creamy of a RIS as i've ever had and fantasticly easy to drink for such a high abv.
In total a great beer that I think probably benefited a good deal from cellaring a year. I had this a day after having a 09 dark lord and its amazing just how different two huge beers made in the same general style can be. Glad I finally got a hold of this one, but unless I move to minnesota for some reason, I don't anticipate going through the trouble of obtaining it again. 1,267 charactersmechamifune, Oct 25, 2010

A - Dark to say the least. Hard pour brings about a khaki head about an inch thick. No lacing really at all.
S - Kind of sweet like a milk stout. Sugary and a bit sweet. Tones of candy and a bit dark fruit. A bit earthy.
T - Wow! Roast but sugary and sweet. Chocolate and a bit coffee. I can't get past the sweetness though.
M - Syrup and thick. Creamy and velvety. A bit carbonated.
D - Even though its thick I can't stop drinking it. Very enjoyable. The sweetness suprises me. Good work, Surly! 615 charactersjoshuaseresse, Oct 24, 2010

2009 DARKNESS
I made my way through the chophouse, the spider web, the grim reaper, and the bloody black roses to my beer fridge. I took the bottle in hand, scurried to the bar and quickly placed it down. There was a strange energy surrounding the bottle. As I got closer to it I felt more and more empty inside. The mummy on the front had me begging Zapps to stay close and protect me. I grabbed Jlynn's heavy duty bottle opener of the orange dish. Stabbing at the bottle cutting through the wax left me out of breath. Finally I reached the cap and quickly pried it open before I was thrown backwards by an unkown force. Looking up at the bottle I could see spirits escaping which reminded me of the micronized Ghostbusters ghost trap. I broke out my proton pack and quickly secured them in the containment unit. Cautiously making my way back to the bottle I secured some tulips. I poured the thick sludge into my tulip and noticed a low carbonation level and the consistency of a Transylvanian Moat. A tan almost brown head jumped out of the moat like vampires of the night hunting for their prey. Finding myself in a trance like state I quickly looked away. I finally gathered the courage to take a sniff with my eyes closed. Roasted bat malts, plum witches dances around my noise hairs. After two years of lifting weights in my beer fridge the hops are still going strong. I picked up this evil liquid and took a sip. Feeling slightly possesed I could sense tons of different malts. The most impressive fruit profile of any stout I've ever had. So many flavors coming through. Despite the robust chocolaty coffee notes, the fruit dominated. What an interesting demon. Very low carbonation despite the exorcism. The demons sucked the bubbles out. As with any massive 10.3 ABV stout this one is a sipper. It's not meant to be chugged like a coors light. The drinkability is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is smooth as a witches broom handle. Unless I go to MN on darkness Day or trade another precious KTG this will probably be my only Darkness. What an impressive brewery. Very glad I got to try this one. Happy Halloween. 2,456 charactersDNICE555, Oct 18, 2010

A: Black body with a thin, but present, brown head. Nice enough for me.
S: Hugely oaky, very sweet, and boozy. Good, but not quite as transcendent as I might have hoped.
T: Sweet, boozy, and very, very tasty. Maybe a bit of hop bitterness, but the emphasis here is on the chocolatey malts and fruity alcohol. Again, it's very, very good, but not great.
M: Full bodied with lots of alcohol burn. I wouldn't want it to be any other way.
D: Somehow, I can't get enough of drinking this beer - even though it doesn't live up to my hopes. 
Notes: What a beer to act as the capstone to a truly epic 
afternoon/evening/night of beer wonderment. While I stand by my assessment of it, I will definitely rereview whenever I get a crack at a bottle that I can take my time with (and can be more sober for). Huge thanks to the Matt for pulling ths crazy beer out of nowhere. Awesome.

The nose is lackluster - strong to be sure, but not pleasant. Tons and tons of malt with a plum character. Not really appealing.
The taste is much of the same. Loaded with roasty caramel malt and a charateristic that makes me think of plums. This isn't bad, per se, but definitely not tasty to me. When I try a beer of Darkness' acclaim, I expect some nice complexities and layers. I got none of that. This thing honestly tasted like a thicker, cloying version of Old Rasputin to me.
Mouthfeel was nice and thick and creamy. Sticky.
All in all, massive disappointment. even though this bottle was from the most recent vintage, I didn't get any of the hops that others are mentioning. I wish I had, since it might have balanced this mess out. I don't imagine I'll be trying this one again. Took me almost 5 hours to finish the bottle, and I was sick to my gut afterwards.

a - Both pour a dark brown with one inch of brown head and light carbonation. 09 seemed a little bit more carbonated.
s - 2008 vintage smells of hops, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts, coffee, and dark fruit. I thought the 09 vintage had more vanilla to it, and a tiny bit of alcohol. Both smelled great.
t - Tastes of roasted malts, dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, and coffee. Very enjoyable. I thought the 2008 vintage was slightly better and did not have as much coffee.
m - Medium to full body, more towards full, and low carbonation. Very creamy and smooth; mouthfeel is great.
d - I've been looking forward to this beer for quite a while and it did not disappoint. It had a complex, balanced smell I enjoyed a lot and a great mouthfeel. It was also hoppier than I expected. I think I enjoyed the 08 a little bit more than the 09, but both were great. Can't wait to have this one again. 997 charactersmdfb79, Sep 28, 2010

4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Opening up something special for my 30th birthday tonight. Mummy vintage poured from a 22oz bottle into my Portsmouth tulip. It poured black in color with a huge, active, mocha colored head taking up nearly half of the glass. The head faded after a bit but it left some decent lacing on the glass as I drank it. 
The aroma has a sweeter, fruitier flavor to it then the typical imperial stout. It almost has a chocolate covered cherry and molasses flavor to it. The roasted, bitter, coffee flavors are more in the background, but they are there. Alcohol is present as well but it doesn't feel out of place. 
The taste is similar to the nose with the sweeter chocolate, cherry, molasses, alcohol flavors being the most present. The roasty and bitter flavors are pretty mild in it. It finishes on the dry side with a moderate dark chocolate bitterness coming through. It's definitely different then any other imperial stout I've had, but it's also very good.
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side but not as thick as say Dark Lord. Carbonation is moderate for the style. Drinkability is good, I really liked the flavors it had. It really has a chocolate covered , booze soaked, cherry flavor to it that I really enjoyed. Very drinkable and delicious beer overall. 1,262 charactersbillab914, Sep 15, 2010

The taste followed the nose for the most part. There was a little brown sugar and licorice that was not really evident in the nose. This was pretty sweet but done in a good way.
This brew was thick and viscous with just enough carbonation to keep it pleasant.
I drank the whole bottle by myself without any problems and could have drank another if I had more. 532 charactersBigTomZ, Sep 07, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage. Thanks to Masterski.
Darkness. More than a word, it is often a chill. Associations come, for everyone a little different, but desolation is a recurring theme. The idea of emptinesss, or if there is something there, it's a nothing, a black hole, or a Presence that one does not wish to take mental hold of. So this. A monumental claim, to present oneself as a nonreality, an idea, a fearsome specter that holds the power to strike loathing into the hearts of men, for it is the Other. The Opposite. The Abssence. It does not truly exist, for it is the absence of something, the absence of The Light that creates it, and nothing else. So then this. It is not Darkness, not The Darknesss, and has little right to stake such a claim. It is, in fact, merely a quite dark brown beneath a soap-bubble and cream tan head... A head that leaves tiny spots on the glass after a swirl. It is a beautiful beer, but shows at once that it is merely a mockery, merely a distant shadow, of what it esteems itself to be.
And then of course, one must dive in to see what this Thing may hold, perhaps looks were decieving... and it hits you. There's no burnt rubber, or tar, or used oil, or the stench of something rotting, or breathing, or hissssing in the darkness, nothing to cast fear into your heart that this is a Monster to be reckoned with... Instead, it is the old standby, the familiar, the lovely grapefruit, the resin, some earthiness, perhaps from a graveyard, but could be just from a garden. That's the thing with this one... There are some soy sauce notes, some roasted grain, some few notes to remind you that this is, indeed, an imperial stout... But it is far from the normal, and also far from the Standard of true Darknesss in liquid form, for which there are two, in my estimation... Dark Lord 2007 and the original, the fresh Mikkeller Black.
And then it just gets relatively boring.... Big sweetness up front but with a huge, Dipa worthy hop profile, even lasting into the finish with grapefruit bitternesss. The underlying malt profiles are that of an excellent RIS, a sticky sweetness with a heavy chocolatey profile and some roasted grain in the finish combining with the hops to form a solid bitter finish and with a syrupy sweetnesss on the middle of the tongue. Blah, blah, blah. We've heard thisss all before. Oh sure, it'ss good... but really? How could you claim to be the abssence of Light itssself, and then be thisss.... Norrrrmality....
Ssss...

Two finger beige head. Pitch black body. Great retention that leaves nice lacing behind.
Smells of tootsie rolls. Dark fruits (plumbs and raisins). Nose reminds me quite a bit of Chokolat by Southern Tier.
Taste is similar. Tootsie rolls, sugar, plumbs, prunes, brown sugar, a touch of dark chocolate, subtle black berries and raspberries, candied dark fruits, and a hint of roastiness/smokiness on the back end. Too much fake sugary like flavor for me.
Thick and full bodied. Low carbonation. Quite smooth, and luscious. Perfect RIS mouthfeel.
A bit cloying, but the alcohol is well hidden. One bottle wasn't exactly easy to put down. Really similar to Chokolat which is much easier to trade for. It also gets a bit better after it warms. 820 charactersbillshmeinke, Aug 22, 2010

Split amongst friends at a tasting. Review from notes.
Pours jet black with a pinky fingers worth of tan head. Smells are chocolate, roasted malts, a lo of cocoa, dark fruits and booze! Tater are much like the nose, chocolate, cocoa, malt and booze and goddamn good! Mouthfeel is sticky and chewy, perfect. We could have easily split another bottle this was so good.

3.67/5  rDev -17%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3 | feel: 5 |  overall: 2.52008 Vintage. 750ml black and gold waxed and capped brown bottle. 55 degrees. Not my 1000th review but my 1000th beer tried!
It pours a thick black with a voluptuous tan head. The head is sandier and not as dark as most Russian Imperial Stouts. It holds like a marvel for a 2 year aged brew of this strength. It refuses to recede but as it does it coats my snifter with thick lacing.
The smell is absolutely wonderful. I was at a brewery today smelling the fest wort, and this one has a lot of that fresh wort smell, that honey-oatmeal like malt sugar smell. Also in there is chocolate, coffee, slight roastiness, rum, and that classic stout smell with a bit of fruitiness. There are raisins and dark cherries in it as well as some caramel and a slight nuttiness. The sweetness can be smelled though there is also a cutting bitterness and sharpness sin the smell. The alcohol is present merely as an addition to the complexity of this brew.
This one is pretty intense in the mouth, a sweeter, fruitier RIS. It smacks you initially with some caramel covered cherries and raisins, then another wave of vinous raisin/grape, and finally a bitter coffee/chocolate finish. The alcohol flashes itself, though not completely, it is a palate exhauster form start to finish.
Though a bit cloying, the mouthfeel is pretty epic for the style, it is smooth and thick with a present but not overbearing alcoholic burn. This is the "liqueur" beer as it holds a bit more sweetness and complexity tan your average Russian imperial stout.
Overall if they were to tone down the sweetness on this one it would reach epic levels of enjoyability, the nose is right on. 1,651 characterscrossovert, Aug 18, 2010

Shared this beer with some friends during our epic imperial stout tasting with Surly Darkness, Darklord, Kate the Great, Abyss, Sexual Chocolate, Cigar City 110K OT Batch2, Speedway stout, Stormaktsporter regular and Kaggen! in the line-up.
Look: Beautiful. Dark as hell. Very nice thick tan head.
Smell: Beautiful aroma as well. This is so complex, it is impossible to describe everything, coffee, dark fruits, tobacco, alcohol, toffee, chocolate. WOW! In terms of smell equal in quality to the Kaggen!. 
Taste: Well, what shall I say, this is really the first beer I ever had I wished I would not have tasted after smelling it. What an enormous disappointing taste. Sweet toffee, molasses, chocolate and sugars. Overpowering sweet. Incredible unbalanced and dull.
Mouhtfeel: Mouthfeel is great again. Thick, dense on palate.
Overall: In terms of taste, completely overrated. Nobody from our 6 people group could finish the glass. Look, smell and mouthfeel close to perfect though. The brewers should contact the Narke brewery for a course in tasty, balanced RIS brewing! The worst one of the evening. Hopeless and hopless 1,142 charactersrvdoorn, Aug 03, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #400. Never thought I'd get here so quickly. I needed a good beer to celebrate this milestone, and I also needed a good buddy to drink it with. So, I brought this to Paul's in hopes that we could toast his new bachelor pad with a great beer. Batch from 2009, opened at about 9 months of age.
Poured into a snifter, this is a dark beer. The kind of beer that would make an appearance in a new Tim Burton film complete with a Danny Elfman soundtrack and really good claymation. Maybe it should have its own music video? The beer is thick, opaque, and has a tan head that leaves great lacing.
Smell is roasted malt driven, giving great chocolate and coffee notes. Some hops do surface, adding a earthy twist. There's even some vanilla, brown sugar, raisin, and dare I say blackstrap molasses in the mix. Just shy of perfect, it's a nice take and doesn't smell that evil after all.
Taste is absolutely one-of-a-kind. This is a great beer, perhaps deserving more respect than some others that get talked about more. It tastes like velvet feels - just so smooth, luxurious, and sexy that you just want to drape yourself in it from head to toe. Tons of well roasted malt give the impressions of really smooth cocoa powder and dark roast coffee. A sweetness exudes that never becomes cloying or makes drinking a 12oz snifter feel like a chore. Raisins and brown sugar become prevalent as it warms, perhaps the raisins were even soaked in a combination of Kahlua, Baily's and Canadian Maple Cream liquor. There's so many levels, each pleasant and just nothing like the sugar and soy sauce bomb I expected based on other massive American RIS's with evil sounding names. Some alcohol is there, but it's blanketed in flavor and just helps to remind me that, no, this isn't a dream. Yes, it's real. Even a touch of hoppiness at the end feels natural. This is a world class beer!
Mouthfeel is also perfect. It's thick and viscous, but not slick, syrupy, or oily. It's sugar doesn't add to the stickiness either. The carbonation is perfect, and the aftertaste isn't totally clean, but it's not stinging, alcohol-laden, or unpleasant in any way. Like George Costanza's track suit in a glass.
This was a great choice for #400. It was a perfect beer to share with a friend. As I write more and more of these reviews, one thing is becoming apparent to me. Beer is a wonderful thing, but the most important thing in keeping a diary like this is being able to remember the good times you had sharing the beers you're documenting. That's when the power of this fascinating beverage is at it's peak. 2,588 charactersjampics2, Jul 28, 2010

One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Dark brown opaque body, no visible carbonation. Big complex nose, there is a lot going on here, I picked up chocolate and cherry up front, a bit of coffee and caramel balanced against a stone fruit and bitter on the back end hop bill. Taste mirrors nose, pretty damn smooth, I picked up a milk chocolate cordial cherry taste with some bitterness on back end, not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is medium, smooth, a bit sticky. Didn't want to hoard the bottle, what I had was damn good, looking forward to having this again. 646 charactersjdense, Jul 28, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An absolute pleaseure to finally have the opportunity to enjoy this beer. Absolute chocolatey notes with licorice and char blend beautifully in this molassas-rich Imperial Stout.
An very viscous pour of oily black liquid falls from the bottle- this is going to be one full beer. Completely opaque, the beer lathers into a thick, lightly browned, dense foam stance that seemingly never waivers. Both lacing and legging have a convincing say in the coatings left behind on the glass.
Robust aromas of both semi-sweet chocolate morsels and dry cocoa powder lead the way with a heafty sidekick of burnt cherries, licorice, rum, and fruitcake. Mouthwatering and seductive, the aromas are near flawlessness.
The chocolate-heavy tone continues in flavor, similar to fresh baked brownies and Hershey syrups. Background fruity notes of cherries, grapes, currants, and dates are accompanied by deep roasted coffee, char, and roasted marshmallows creaminess. Molassas sweetness brings these flavors together seamlessly while giving a soothing taste to the aggressive roast.
Full, viscous, creamy, and oily in mouthfeel, the beer has a slow transition from early thickness to a late sweet, warming, and bitter finish (bitterness is in form of both char and hops). This beer is obviously intended for after dinner compliments or in place of dinner alltogether.
A special thanks goes out to Shango42 for the unique opportunity to finally enjoy this beer. He gets my right arm if he ever requests it. 1,490 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 27, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Review number 999!!! Since most everyone saves Darkness for review 666, I thought I'd flip the script a little...
Major, major thanks to mikesgroove for sending this one my way. 2009 black wax-sealed 750ml bottle into a Unibroue tulip.
Black coffee body nears utter darkness on the pour--but not quite. Still, this beer is an absolute beauty in the glass. A towering, cascading, rich head of burnt custard brown foam slowly retreats to a fat cap of mottled bubbles, draping thick webs of lace along the inside of the tulip. Quite simply, the aroma is to die for. One part floral & earthy hops, 2 parts espresso, 5 parts black strap molasses, and 10 parts dark chocolate. Complexity is off the charts, as the background notes of citrus, gingerbread, plum, black cherry, and licorice could easily stand on their own and shun other Imperial Stouts.
Darkness hits the tongue with a powerful blend of roasted chocolate malts, sweet caramel and molasses, and tons of dark fruit (black cherry syrup, mandarin orange, and fig). Sweet, bordering on cloying, but the earthy hops, bitter chocolate and coffee close the deal and save the finish from becoming too sugary. Alcohol is all but a brief burn on the way going down...very well-hidden. Chewy, thick mouthfeel that coats the palate, yet has enough carbonation to keep the body from weighing and wearing down the tastebuds. All in all, a delectable, delicious brew from the good folks at Surly. There's a reason this beer is in the top 50. As if there was ever any doubt, consider the Darkness hype worthy. 1,554 characterswagenvolks, Jul 27, 2010
4/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color stout with a large deep dirty brown color head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt and black chocolate with some light liquorice and dry coffee notes is quite enjoyable. Taste is also a heavy mix between some roasted malt with light bitter notes with rich black chocolate notes and very subtle notes of liquorice and dry fruits. Sweetness is very well balanced and not nearly as cloying as Dark Lord. Body is full with good carbonation and warming notes are perceptible though nothing too heavy. Well done and still retaining some balance even though it is an extreme beer. 631 charactersPhyl21ca, Jul 12, 2010
4/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to scoobydank for this awesome bottle as part of the BA Vets BIF.
Jet black with a decent sized head. very tight and confined bubbles. Heavy dried fruit aroma. Very "india ink" like smell to it. Fruity and very malty flavors dominate. Again dried fruit, very plum like. Raisen quality to the flavor. Sticky sweetness and a trace of toffee. Lacks some of the heavy roasted notes and the strong hop bite I am used to in a RIS. Sticky and creamy mouthfeel. A damn good RIS. I like mine a bit more astringent overall flavor wise. Still damn enjoyable and well worth trying.
Oh my wife just commented the label would make a great tattoo. 641 characterslackenhauser, Jul 10, 2010

A - wow, pours a pretty black, with a small tan head. The head coats the tulip glass nicely. 
S - smells sweet, with some chocolate bitterness. You also can smell a nice burst of hops. Malt smell is very present too.
T - starts off like thick molases. Some brown sugar sweetness hits you, and then some roastiness comes in for the fun. A sudden burst of hops finishes the taste.
M - very creamy, and sticky. The carbonation level could be a little higher though. 
D - a very drinkable beer. It's flavorful without being overpowering, so I can keep drinking it. The abv is well hidden too. 
O - this is a great beer. A hoppier imperial stout that has a lot more flavors to balance this beer out, well done. Should be seeked out for stout fans. 805 charactersabecall98, Jul 08, 2010

Pours a pitch black motor oil color with with a thin caramel color head.
Scents of dark molasses, dried black cherries, and cafe mocha, There's even more going on here but I'll just say that it's damn nice.
Echos the nose however it is a touch sweeter than I would have expected. Perfect blending of the flavors though likely increased by the age. Wonderful.
Viscous and smooth with a perfect carbonation that whisks the beer across the palate and conveys the flavors perfectly.
This is one hell of a RIS which I have to say is one of the few hyped beers that actually live up to its rep. Fantastic RIS I wish I could obtain more easily. Great part was everyone sharing it all agreed that it was a fantastic beer. 730 charactersUA8, Jul 02, 2010

Taste is fairly sweet but it's also got the nice roasty coffee flavor along with some nice light carbonation makes it really smooth. Lots of dark fruit, really complex.

A- Pours a heavy motor oil black color. One finger light brown head that shows a little bit retention before dying down. Light lacing on the sides of the glass as I drink this gem down. 
S- Interesting enough this beer has a nice hop profile in the front end. Piney and citrus both which shine. Darker toasted malts with this as well brings forth a light burnt aroma. Nice bittersweet chocolate aroma with a hint of coffee in the ending. The hops still though throw me off but not in a bad way. Interesting and make my mouth water when I sniff the glass. 
T- First thing I notice off the bat is hops and more hops...both piney and citrusy. Nice roasted malts in the front after the hops. Almost a perfect roasted burnt taste. Bittersweet chocolate notes with a fudge like charater to it. Bready flavors with a coffee taste that lingers around. The alcohol in this is settle and sometimes hard to miss. Overall, great flavors!
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is great for the beer and style. Hops and light burnt malts are left on the palate with some coffee notes and light chocolate in the aftertaste. Flavors are bright and clean. Beer blended very well but flavors pop out individually. Not very drying on the palate at all.
D- This beer is worth all the praise. I would love to make it out to Darkness Day this year. I am glad I have a extra bottle in the cellar and got to try this one out. This beer is going to become one of my favorite. 1,582 charactersalleykatking, Jun 22, 2010

I had this after DL and I have to say they are two different beasts, but i was fairly underwhelmed by this one. 
A: Pours just as black as I have seen, with a foamy khaki tan head. 
S: Way more hops than i was expecting out of an RIS. Earthy hops, with hints of dark fruits behind it. It smells alot more like black IPA than an RIS.
T: Right along with the smell. No surprises here. The earthy hops lead the way and kind of took away from what otherwise was a great RIS. Dark chocolates, and dark fruits follow, but i can't get over that much hops in my RIS.
M: Full bodied, thick. 
D: Didn't really love this one, I don't think i could finish a bottle off myself. 788 charactersBS68280, Jun 20, 2010

A: A thick jet black that yields no light. A really cool brownish orange head rises above the black liquid and leaves full glass lacing. Wonderful looking beer.
S: Roasted malts with big aroma of chocolate, dark fruits and a nice amount of earthy hops. A bit of sweetness is picked up too.
T: Roasted flavors that slide right into huge chocolate flavors. I picked up milk chocolate and fudge flavors much more so than any dark chocolate flavors. Some dark fruit flavors come in with some plum, cherry and fig coupled with the earthy pine hops. The hops get subdued by the deep caramel malt sweetness that finishes out the beer. No bitterness and the sweetness really holds in the mouth. Very complex beer.
M: Full, coating, sweet, thick with minimal alcohol heat. 
D: Medium. I really had enough after finishing the 750. The sweetness started to wear on me a bit.
Overall an amazing beer that is deserving of the hype, but I found it a bit sweeter than I would have liked. Next time I'm trying it fresh. I love the hops and hopefully they will shine a bit more. Still a super complex beer that I was super happy to try. Thanks NuBrewm! 1,297 charactersKadonny, Jun 14, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This offering pours a deep dark black leaving a thick tan head in it's wake. Wow the smell is super strong I haven't even put my nose to the glass and i can smell the strength of this beer.
Nose is malty, roasted nuts, coffee, very herbal deep pitted dark fruits, super sweet smelling tons of aromatics. The taste is syrupy, cherries, sweet prunes, dark pitted fruits, raisins coffee, super malty with a minimal hops presence but just enough to balance that maltiness. 
I'd pair this beer with dessert or game meat like venison as the sweetness with really play with the savor aspect of the beer. If choosing dessert I'd go with something black forest cake that the bitterness would play well with this sweet beer! 716 charactersFranchise, Jun 10, 2010

A: Oily black darkness fills the glass. One finger of chocolate-mocha head that retains fairly well. Not as thick as I might expect, but still very full looking.
S: Dark fruits, maybe cherry and fig, on top of an overwhelming chocolate and malt sweetness. Fairly complex, but not too many scents I can pull out and name.
T: Dark chocolate, roasted malts, and a sweetness that lingers around on the palette. Some coffee and raisin flavors. A little soy actually plays in, although not necessarily in a bad way.
M: Fairly thick and creamy. Moderate to low carbonation. Rich and full in body.
D: Rich, sweet, and filling. This was a great beer, but I'm glad I had friends to share this with. Would love another to add to the cellar. 935 characterskirkpjr, Jun 07, 2010

Type: 750ml. Bottle
Vintage: 2009
Glassware: Usual Portsmouth Tulip
Poured a nice charcoal black w/ a 1/2 finger light brown creamy head w/ minimal lacing. Nose was fantastic, w/ aromas of chocolate malts, light coffee, black licorice, slight smokiness, and a touch of earthy peat. Taste was excellent as well, w/ notes of dark chocolate, vanilla bean/marshmallow, and a finish of substantial hop bitterness. This brew contained a flavor in the middle that took me awhile to pinpoint, eventually I realized it was burnt toffee mixed w/ star anise. Mouthfeel was pretty viscous and oddly pillowy at the same time. The only negative on this brew for me was the sweetness, that got to me after only a 12oz. glass. To be honest, it kind of sadened me because it overshadowed the amazing complexity of this fine brew.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, but could only handle drinking a 4-8oz. pour. The next time I crack one of these bad boys open, it will be w/ other BA friends. 1,000 charactersmikeyv35, May 27, 2010

A- Body is a thick, dark, almost black hue. Pours with a small foamy off white head which dissolves to a thin collar and leaves traces of lacing behind in the glass.
S-Earthy hops, a hint of alcohol, a hint of cocoa and roasted malt, and anise. Decent balance and slightly mild.
T- There is a faint herbal/earthy hop accent initially with a mild roasted malt backbone. Chocolate and anise flavors come rushing through for the finish and are more prominent than the initial flavors. Mild impressions of the initial flavor linger.
M- low carbonation with a syrupy medium to heavy weight body that is slightly thin.
D- Overall- I REALLY like this beer. Its very good overall. The '08 and the '09 were very similar in overall profiles so I didn't comment on individual differences because I noticed few, if any. I'd still like to try this beer fresh when the hoppy notes tend to really shine. ABV was pretty well hidden here as well. 1,002 charactersPittBeerGirl, May 26, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes from an epic tasting with BCBCS. Thanks to Chico1985 and whoever traded it to him. Certainly one of the coolest (painted!) bottles ever.
A- If this beer was not pitch black I think another name would be appropriate. A light tan/beige head builds up and retains fairly well. It leaves thick lacing made up of fine bubbles. A nice ring and random cloud float on the beer.
Before smell and taste, it is worth mentioning that this was one of the most complex beers I have ever had.
S- Extremely roast malt up front. A cherry/dark fruit scent blends into the nose nicely. Molasses comes in pretty strong. I also get hints of pine, cocoa, dark fruits, earthy hops, caramel and even some citrus. A tiny bit of alcohol as well. The aroma itself has nice strength. There was also something I couldnt quite identify but it reminded me of my homebrew, maybe overly roasty?
T- A great balance of a ton of flavors. Very roasty malt with dark chocolate up front with molasses. Cherries and dark fruit make the main flavor of this one like a chocolate covered cherry. A tiny hint of alcohol hits the tongue but doesn't even come close to affecting the great flavor. A lot of earthy, grassy and pine hops round out the stout flavors. Sweets come into play but it doesn't bother me. The caramel malt shines its head later on and makes this one taste a lot like a Barelywine RIS. Very complex and balanced well. It never got old after an hour of sipping on it.
MF- Very creamy but not hugely thick, reminds me of KtG in a way. A very nice amount of warmth on the palate for a big RIS. Low carbonation but that is desired in this style. Roast caramel coats the palate. Needs more straight up thickness but the creaminess saves from being way off.
DB- Obviously rare and probably decently expensive. For how many flavors and the great time I had drinking this I would say it's worth it. Very complex Barleywine-like RIS with a great balance of a many different flavors. 1,975 characterscbutova, May 22, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 bottle split between myself, cbutova and atremains. This has been one of my most anticipated beers. Also my first offering from Surly. Received in a trade from cdflem, much thanks!
Before getting onto the real appearance I will say this is my favorite bottle design ever. So awesome. The beer itself, is, yes, dark. You could say the glass is filled with...darkness. Charlie Murphy territory is indeed tread upon. The head is very thick, coffee brown, retains decently, leaves some nice lacing.
Strange scent at first, hard to pin down exactly what I'm smelling but I realize, cherries. Definitely dark chocolate and cherries. Lots of roasted malt and caramel. Smells very sweet and rich.
Taste I get much of the above, chocolate-covered cherries are the first thing that come to mind. Though this has some age on it now (7-8 months?) there is still a boatload of hops, getting more fruit notes there. A bit of booze. This is a very strange beer, almost brandy-esque. The hops and sweetness seem to take over the stoutness too much for my taste, especially towards the end. Almost feels like a chocolate barleywine.
Mouthfeel is more creamy than thick, almost in a KtG way but not near that level. A little too hoppy, dangerously close to IPA-ness. Booze is noticeable but not a problem.
I'm glad I split this because the sweetness may have killed it over time. Definitely not what I expected, I liked it but if it were a little more stout and a little less barleywine-tasting this I would've liked it more, still I love the chocolate/cherry here. A stout like no other. 1,580 charactersChico1985, May 21, 2010
3.73/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52009 Bottle I think
Tall dark tan head with really decent retention. Probably one of the best looking stouts I've seen.
Sweeter fruit flavors, not so much dark fruit but lighter fruits. There is a very slight roasted note lingering in the background of the smell that comes through a bit more in the taste.
Aside from the sweet fruits and roasted malt there is a very slight tartness on the back of the tongue and some port like qualities.
Thinner body but it's not bad. The carbonation was in the middle of all the stouts we sampled. 538 charactersmullenite, May 16, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 2009 vintage 750 ml bottle into a Dogfish Head signature glass. 
Appearance: Right off the bat, I can tell that this is one of the thicker stouts I've ever poured. Immediately, the beer pours a viscous, compact motor-oil black that just sludges its way out of the bottle. Atop the beer is a bubbly two-finger head that loses its height quickly, but still retains a slight presence on top of the beer for awhile. 
Smell: This is a stout? At first sniff, it seems not. The first thing you get out of the nose, at least in this 2009 vintage, is an immense and glorious whiff of hops. These are not just piny hops, however, as you would normally expect in a stout, but a whole array of piny, sugary, and even citric hops. It's tempting to just enjoy the beautiful scent of caramel-coated hops and forget about the rest of the scent, but there is even more to be found. 
While the hops are blatantly the most prominent and intriguing facets of the smell, there is a delightful backdrop of syrupy, gooey dark malts lurking somewhere in the background. This dark malt is so good that if it were the only scent in the nose, I would consider awarding the perfect score. All in all, an absolutely breathtaking nose. 
Taste: If the nose had somehow left you skeptical as to the quality of Darkness, the taste puts all doubts to rest. Again, the hops are the first thing I'll discuss, not because they are necessarily the mot obvious taste, but because they form the feature that make this beer like no other RIS. As in the nose, there is a wonderful citric and resinous pine sap taste that is quite unexpected but extremely welcomed by a hophead. 
Enough about the hops, though. The impressive malt backbone deserves some attention of its own. Just in case you thought this was a black IPA (or whatever the hell they're called now), the malt reminds you that, yes, you're drinking an imperial stout, and a world-class one at that. The fudge-like malts are prototypical of an imperial stout, but still delicious all the same. Without typing too much, I think the taste of the malts can be summarized as a rum-soaked chocolate cake. 
Mouthfeel: Upon first sip, I had reservation about awarding this the perfect score, but now I know that Darkness is well-deserving. Despite the appearance, this is not an exceptionally thick stout, though I will admit it is thicker than average. Where this beer stands out, however, is the silkiness of the mouthfeel. The flavors all tied together so beautifully that I'm certain this is one of the smoother RIS's that I've had. 
Drinkability: For starters, there is absolutely no trace of alcohol in this beer, and for that, I applaud the brewers at Surly Brewing Company. Nevertheless, I've taken a good hour and a half to get through this bottle, which is the only thing keeping me from giving it the perfect score. 
Surly Darkness is a magnificent beer without a shadow of a doubt. It is an immensely bold and extremely complex stout, but what sets it apart for me is the uniqueness of the flavors. I can comfortably say that this is without a doubt completely unlike any RIS I've ever had. The way the hops are incorporated into the massive malt-profile is truly a work of art, and for that I take my hat off to the brewers at Surly. 3,281 characterszoso493, May 10, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42-3 oz taste poured into a tulip glass
A - Dark, yes. Darkness? Meh. Not much head to speak of; moderate lacing.
S - Dark chocolate and coffee beans
T - Right off the bat, I'm tasting raisins and loads of espresso. Midway through, the piny hops kick in and prove to be a perfect complement to the dark chocolate finish. These tastes blend together unbelievably well and create an extremely memorable RIS - this lives up to the hype, indeed.
M - Black velvet, with the perfect level of carbonation for the style.
D - I'd drink a bottle by myself right now if I could (admittedly, I might have a change of heart halfway through...). This is extremely well-balanced for my palate, as the hops more than offset the sweetness from the malts and chocolate.
I've been looking forward to trying this for a long time, and I was still blown away. I easily prefer this to Dark Lord, and if it weren't for BCBCS, I'd say this is the best stout I've had. I'll be driving to Minnesota this fall, without a doubt. 1,004 charactersklikger, May 06, 2010

appearance - very dark, light brown head
smell - citrus hops, much more hoppy than anticipated. caramel sweetness and coffee.
taste - very rich/dense. there are two big flavors: hops and sweetness. interesting thats these two flavors come at the same time rather than one following the other. keeps it very balanced. other flavors would include coffee and cocoa.
mouth - syrupy and creamy. very heavy
overall - great beer. This is VERY different than DL, much more hoppy and less intensive sweetness. Its somewhere inbetween DL and DORIS. Very drinkable though! 599 characterslevifunk, May 05, 2010
3.9/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5~ 2008 Vintage ~
Pour - super dense, rich and thick like motor oil as it drains into a glass leaving a relatively thin velvet-y head. I got a kick out of how viscous this stuff was and the "legs" it left inside the glass as it poured. Damn, this is not for the faint of heart. Be warned. 
Aroma - big bready, malty, chocolatey, licorice-y, caramel-y and overall molasess-y. Some alcohol heat comes through in the nose as well. This just smells like it could cause cavities or cause a person's blood sugar to spike. 
Taste - MALTY MALT MALT! Wow, this is like drinking malt extract with licorice and brown sugar mixed in. This is borderline cloying its so sweet and dense. I guess you need a literal ton of malt to brew a beer of this magnitude and it certainly does taste that way. Some flavors that I thought were oxidization were just caramel malt and alcohol heat. Even after 18 months in the cellar this is still hot. Brown bread dough soaked in rum and then mixed into a potent stout should sum things up nicely. If you like malty brews this is going to please you, if you want more than strong and dark you might be a bit let down. I need to have some of this fresh to see what those hops (85 IBUs!!!) might do for this brew. 
Overall - sweet, very sweet. This is a malt lover's dream and a little more one-sided than I had hoped. It almost reminded me of a super-strong Baltic Porter as it had some licorice and anise notes that were very similar. In the end I'd say it lived up to the hype when it comes to the strength and complexity but was not as drinkable as I had hoped. 
Would I buy more of it? - I was fortunate it enough to receive this bottle from a very generous beer loving friend in the Midwest. If I lived within a few hours of Surly I'd certainly make the pilgrimage each year just for the fun of it. 1,830 charactersindiapaleale, May 04, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review#666. Thanks goes out to Kbutler for the bottle, one that has been on my radar for a bit. I enjoyed this with friends at The Compound poured into appropriate glasses.
Brown/black liquid shoe polish coming out of the bottle, deep space black when condensed in the glass. The name does not lie. Darkness builds a fort of dark tan, bordering on mocha brown, head on top that's kinda bubbly and not terribly together, there are nice streaks of lace on the way down. Muddled spray paint lace notches.
This has a good amount of everything that's associated with the style. First off a big bag of chocolate(bittersweet) pieces nessled in with espresso scents. A dark fruit component with some berries mixed in with a roasted malt base that does not quit. Some molasses and some bittering hops close this out.
I was worried about Darkness being to hoppy, I heard the 08' was bordering on Storm King territory which is not my bag. I get a nice amount of hops with some grapefruit and slight pine, but it's not at a killer level. The hops are actually under a sea of roasted malts(and many others) giving off chocolate, black coffee and oats from the farm. A nice amount of sweetness with brown suga & some licorice in the middle. Some molasses and blackberry finished off with a mix of everything above. 
This is a thick stout, but not as thick as other heavy hitters. I would say it's full bodied but not very syrupy and gooey. It goes down smooth with a mix of sweet and bitter from the hopping. It does not coat the mouth for long but makes a lasting impression aftertaste wise. Hey wait, this is approaching 11%, I would not have guessed it if it was not printed on the bottle, expertly cloaked, but not 100% out of the picture.
Well Darkness exceeded my expectations and I had a smile on my face the whole time. I usually take my sweet time with big rizzes, but this was drank with the quickness, probably because it's not a overly gooey RIS. I wish I had more and can see why alot of people on this site hoard this beer, one that is not all that incredibly rare at this point, it's just damn fine stuff that demands some respect. 2,137 charactersBARFLYB, May 02, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Aroma: Very rich dark fruits fill the nose with some sweet chocolate. A trace of alcohol spice rounds out the fruit and sweetness, though the alcohol isn't as prevelant as expected. No hop aroma. 
Appearance: Black as midnight death. Head pours a billowy bread crust brown, though fairly quickly fades to a ring at the edge of the glass with some light lace.
Flavor: Initial plum sweetness quickly transitions to chocolate with an orange peel twang. Molasses lingers lightly in the middle but gives way to more chocolate, though this time it comes off as dark and bitter as the alcohol spice kicks in. Finish is drying from the alcohol, but not hot. Plum stickiness retains well in the end on the lips and back of the throat.
Mouthfeel: Full body with light carbonation. Most of the body is defined by the dark fruit character in the beer, creating the feeling of light molasses and sticky dried fruit. Alcohol bites the back if the throat with light burn in the finish. 
Overall: The aroma and flavor of this beer provide an exclusive look into the complexities of dark fruit and sweet chocolate created by a well crafted Russian Imperial Stout. The alcohol provides a nice warming and spicy presence and the orange peel was a surprising twist. While I describe the beer as full bodied, I would expect this style to hold more of a chewy character. Instead you're presented with sticky sweetness that somewhat artificially fills the palate. By the end of my review the head had completely disappeared as well.       1,524 charactersDanOLeary, Apr 24, 2010
4.19/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Reviewed from my notes from last night. Shared with friends
Pours a super deep black. Motor oil looking. Pretty thick. Very thin head but dissapated to nothing. No real lacing.
Aroma of dark fruits and tons of caramel/burnt sugars. Very malty and sweet smelling. Smells great
The taste is as it smells but the dark fruits are the main players in the flavor. Lots of sweet malt. Gets to be a little too much after a while.
Mouthfeel is super heavy. Light carb. A little too heavy for me.
Overall a very tasty beer in small amounts but I couldn't drink alot at all. Very heavy and very malty. But I am glad I finally got to taste this beer. 643 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Apr 23, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured this 750 mL brown bottle into a Duvel glass. Wax was dark chrome. The body was the color of darkness. The huge tan head was creamy and dense, it fought back. 
Smell was grainy and fruity. There was a bright, clean, fresh aroma. I did not detect coffee or chocolate, which I expected. Well hidden alcohol.
Taste was cherries, and stone fruits. A bit lactic/milky. Rich. Lightly bready. Muted hops. Sweet, but not too much. Again I did not pick up chocolate or coffee, however, this is one of the easiest drinking RISs I've ever had. Very well hidden alcohol. 
Mouthfeel was luxurious. Rich and silky smooth. Overall I would describe this beer as ripe fruit wrapped in velvet. Dangerously drinkable. 707 charactersCresant, Apr 23, 2010

Tastes extremely hoppy with all sorts of nice stout goodness hiding behind the initial blast of hops. Chocolate, espresso, oatmeal, roasted malts, dark fruits. You can tell there is a completely different beer hiding under everything. Hop flavor was similar to furious, which to me is a good thing. Finished thick and oily, nice and creamy. alcohol goes unnoticed. I can only imagine what this will turn into as the hops drop back and everything else comes forward. One of the most complex beers I've ever tried. 594 characterspepsican, Apr 19, 2010

Big aromas on the nose: hops, chocolate, roast, coffee and licorice. The first taste brings a suggestion of hops, followed quickly by warming alcohol.

3.93/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Drove over an hour into Chicago where thanks to the Craft Brewers convention there was a firkin being tapped that i was able to partake in.
Got my tulip for $7 which i thought very reasonable, and the head was just under a finger but tightly packed and coffee colored. black body under.
This is a sweet one through and through, there is just a small hint of roast and alcohol trying to hold the sweetness in check. It's not cloying, don't get me wrong, just absolutly on the sweet end of the spectrum. I got alot of milk chocolate, with a pretty syrupy sensation, not only on the mouth feel but the flavor as well, which was not really detrimental but just differant. 
This was medium heavy thickness, but honestly thinner then i was expecting for such a stout.
The finish was a bit thin and had me sipping it every 3 seconds, i would never guess this was over 10%, no way, way to drinkable. i could have 40oz of this easily. 
Glad i made the trip to enjoy this beer with some of my too seldom seen friends in the city. 1,024 charactersChadQuest, Apr 10, 2010

A: Looks great. Black with a 1/2" thick dark brown head.
S: Sweet and roasty. 
T: Very smooth; the alcohol is very well hidden. Quite sweet. Based on some of the other reviews on here, I expected it to be hoppy, but my pour wasn't hoppy at all. 
M: Not as thick as most RIS I've had.
D: Very smooth. You would never guess that this is over 10% ABV! Very drinkable; although, I suspect the sweetness would get to you after awhile.

A: Couple fingers of head, dark black color with coffee colored lacing/head. Not too carbonated except at the top of the beer; no bubbling in the body of the brew.
S: Strong! I could smell it from five feet away; it is a wonderfully sweet aroma of chocolate, coffee, licorice, and barley that is balanced by oats. The oat and barley are dominant and there is a mellow alcohol melded in.
T: Super sweet and malty with licorice, chocolate, and barley on the palate. This is balanced by the oats and bitter coffee on the finish. The alcohol is super smooth and pleasant, and this beer reminds me of a better, sweeter, and more drinkable version of GI's BCS.
M/D: It just sits in your mouth and you never want to swallow. Super smooth, creamy and drinkable.
This is the new best beer I've ever had... by a decent margin. 866 charactersjt31914, Apr 05, 2010

A- Midnight black in color. A solid 1' 1/2" dark brown head that has pretty decent retention. Nice lacing.
S- Big molasses and booze. Malts and a slight hint of hops.
T- Very sweet molasses and dark chocolate. Some dried fruits, mainly prunes. The alcohol takes the spotlight and kind of drowns out the other flavors. There is a bit of earthly hops.
M- Kind of thin, almost oily. I would have def preferred a little more thickness.

A- pitch black and oily that's for sure with a finger of coffee colored creamy head. The cap vanishes into the deep after a bit. Deep ruby glow when brightly lite from behind. 
S- dark brown sugar and bakers chocolate. Pumpernickel bread. Dark berries and some spice. Deep roasted malts and maybe some molasses. 
T- there is a lot going on in the dark. Tons of dark roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Brown sugar and blackberries. There some grapefruit in there too and it really picks up the fruit aspect, balances out the peppery roast, and brightens up the dark malty sweetness. Maple pepper bacon? No, but there is a very mild savory quality and it really works for me. Touch of heat. 
M- thick and chewy, oil and syrup. Coats the mouth so completely but has just the right amount of carb to cut the soup. The slightest linger, I almost want a bit more. 
D- with such a complex flavor profile and abv I wouldn't say its a session beer but damn if this is not easy going. 1,049 charactersoglmcdgl, Apr 05, 2010

2009 vintage
Split with Andy during our epic beer tasting. Poured into my pint glass the beer is a the true definition of a blackhole. A waterfall of cascading bubbles rain down over nearly half the glass. The thick dark mocha head rises to a full three fingers before receding to leave a emense lace ring.
The aroma is very sweet with loads of citrus fruit and pine. The usual RIS suspects are present as well. Dark chocolate, coffee, roast malt and hints of campfire. I actually get a touch of peanut butter too.
The flavor is a huge blast of choclate covered grapefruit. I like hoppy stouts but this is insane. Once past the hops you get a fair amount coffee, molasses, roasted malt and a hint of smoke. 
Full thick body. Very used motor oil like. Light if any carbonation.
Overall a hop bomb RIS. The drinkability suffers for me with the two opposing flavors. I would love to try one with some age on it. Maybe mellow out those hops a bit.
EDIT: 
After having this on cask at GTMW (one of hte first samples I grabbed) I'm bumping my scores up for this. It was truly sublime with some age on it. 1,237 charactersbeerwolf77, Mar 31, 2010

3.71/5  rDev -16.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 Vintage
Appearance- Not quite black but a dark brown during the pour, appears dark black in the glass. A large brown head with excellant retention. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass.
Smell- A large hoppy nose. Resiny and citrus fruit mostly. A little dark malt in the background. Smells more like a DIPA than a RIS.
Taste- Again this is dominated by the hops. Sticky and fruity. Bitterness is high even with several months on this bottle. Malt is a secondary player giving some roasted and chocolate notes. Alcohol does not really play a major role in the taste.
Mouthfeel- Not as big and thick as other RIS's. Still has good carbonation and texture.
Drinkability- With each passing year it seems Darkness becomes less of a style dominator. More of a Black IPA at this point. Hope Surly goes back to the 2007 recipe for 2010. I would take an Old Rasputin or Storm King over this. 909 charactersmorimech, Mar 26, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750 ml of Darkness is coming my way! I knew one day I would be able to get a bottle of my own, but I didn't expect it so soon. I got this in a trade back in November. From a 2009 Vintage, on to the beer:
The cap has been taken off, so there is no turning back. It is black as black can be, no amount of lighting is gonna get through. The espresso colored head on top has a finger's worth of thickness and retention, and it has good retention. Thing rings of lacing cling to the glass. It's a very resiny smelling imperial stout. There's a lot of it. Some of the pure hoppiness still exists, and among other aromas are molasses, unsweetened chocolate
Unlike other imperial stouts, Darkness is plenty hoppy. Not resiny like the smell, just hop juice. Yeah, hop juice. Sweet tropical juice, orange, some citrus tang. Quite honestly, it resembles more of a yummy DIPA than a stout. But around its edges are yummy notes of chocolate fudge. More and more malty imperial stout hit the taste buds are more beer is consumed. The alcohol is buried extremely well, and it's not thick or viscous, rolls off the tongue with ease...creamy. Mmmm. It's leaving some tasty hoppy-sweet nectar as it dries around my lips. 
I'm not as huge of a fan of hoppy imperial stouts as others geeks, but I do like Darkness and its hoppy profile. Needless to say, I'm very happy to have called a bottle of it my own. 1,389 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 25, 2010

Incredibly sweet, cloying beer. I had trouble finishing my sample. It was like drinking molasses and hoppy wort. I did not think this beer was worthy of its praise to begin with. Now I have no doubt that this beer is pure hype.
2008 vintage.
Darkness poured out black with a nice head produced from its big hopping addition for an imperial stout. Reminds me of Stone's RIS.
It's still hoppy after a year plus in this bottle. Seems to have faded them into an earthy smell. Light sweetness and dark malts blend into the aroma.
This beer has a lot of balance going for it. Light hops, chocolate, roasted barley, and balanced sweetness make it very easy to drink at this age. There's moderate carbonation to it as well.
This beer still reminds me of a well aged Stone RIS though. 794 charactersBearsOnAcid, Mar 24, 2010

The beer is sweet and has a definite chocolate bitter / semisweet flavor to it. There is a nice maltiness to the beer that is really nice.

T- Huge malty beer, dark chocolate, figs, plums, black licorice, some peppery alcohol, vanilla, almonds, some red wine like flavors, and spicy bitter hops. This is one of the most complex tasting beers I have ever had. Fantastic tasting beer.

A - Ok, I can definitely see why it's called Darkness. That's all you see, if it's something to be seen at all. Maybe your eyes aren't worthy of seeing it. But damn, it's pitch black and nothing shows up around the edges, even in light. Tan head that refuses to go away. No lace. 4.5
S - Well now this is most surprising. It's not your typical sweet and fruity RIS, yet it's not an overly hopped and bitter one either. I pick up a touch of earthiness from the hops, followed by a blend of dark chocolate, spiced rum, prunes, coffee beans, and cream. Maybe a hint of vanilla too? Well, whatever this is, it's causing a nasal addiction and I very nearly snorted this up my nose. 5.0
T - This is a BIG beer. But you can hardly taste the alcohol. The chocolate is the most prominent aspect of the flavor. Bitterness is definitely there but is well blended with the malts, which obviously include chocolate malt and roasted barley. Lots of toastiness and roastiness. Caramel sweetness is in the background, letting everything else shine. I'm kind of at a loss to describe this baby. 5.0
M - Not as thick and viscous as it looks. It's rich and robust, yet drinks like a beer should. Nice and delicate carbonation. 5.0
D - Yes. Indeed. 4.5 1,285 charactersDmanGTR, Mar 08, 2010

2009 Vintage acquired in trade, but I can't remember with whom. If you see this and we did the trade, shoot me a BM and I'll edit accordingly.
I've been fortunate to try the '07 and '08 Darkness and am now sampling the '09.
Well, this is one is a disappointment. '07 is plain and simply, the tits and '08 is like a bowel movement after having the spiciest indian food you've ever eaten.
Appearance is good, pitch black with a two finger head that wuickly fades to small bubbles.
Smell is dark fruits with a nice hoppy backbone.
Taste is again good, not great. The hop bite is there first, followed closely by the not-as-overpowing sweetness that plagued the '08 edition.
Mouthfeel is the best part of the '09 edition. Silky smooth all they way down into my belly.
The overpowering sweetness really hurts the drinkability of this brew.
In short, Darkness and I have a love hate relationship, much like the re-launch of Doctor Who. '07 is Tennant, the 10th Doctor, arguably the best. '08 is Eccleston, the 9th Doctor, far too cheeky for its own good, and the '09 is Matt Smith, the 11th Doctor, there's promise, but right now it has some pretty big shoes to fill to be the best. 1,199 charactersCedromar, Mar 07, 2010

A - Pours a totally opaque pitch black -no light gets thru at all. Two fingers of dense cappuccino head with good staying power. Head has great styaing power which is amazing considering the high level of alcohol in this one.
S - Cocoa, baker's chocolate, a bit of pruny fruitiness, a tiny amount of molasses, a bit hoppy - smells a bit green.
T - Incredibly smooth. Tons of chocolate - (dark, milk,bittersweet), dark fruits, some sugary sweetness, dark roasted malts, molasses, some hop presence.
M - Silky smooth...a close second to the BA Blackout. Carbonation is low and fits nicely...very full bodied. A bit oily and coats the mouth completely.
D - Excellent imperial stout. Alcohol really isn't noticeable which is scary. Loving this stout...definitely lives up to its reputation. Excellent - highly recommended. 951 charactersportia99, Mar 07, 2010

A- Pours a deep black, dare I say Darkness. Deep tan to mocha 1-finger head leaving spotty lacing.
S-Very sweet smelling. Molasses and chocolate. Very different from the 2008 I sampled fresh last year, which was quite hoppy.
T-Mmmm mmm mmm. This is a fine one. Very sweet with subtle soy sauce notes (it's pretty young at this point, but I'm still getting some.) Some bitter roasted malts and definitely a fair amount of sweet molasses-like flavor. The sweetness gives way to a decent hop profile for a stout of this magnitude.
MF- Nice and creamy with subtle carbonation and very full-bodied. Really well done on the mouthfeel. The sweetness doesn't leave a cloying flavor/feeling.
D- Like I said with the mouthfeel, nice and sweet, but doesn't become cloying at all. Alcohol is completely masked and I could have probably finished the bomber no problem (but I split it with a friend because you can't just crush Darkness alone.) 1,024 charactersmbudner, Mar 06, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes taken at Greg's epic Wall St. tasting - thats how we do baby!
A - Pitch black, with a medium tan that recedes rather quickly - especially for the style. 
S - SUPER hoppy, to the point of being one dimensional. If I'm going to drink a RIS I want to know thats what I'm drinking. If my RIS is going to be hoppy, I desire a balance. 
T - Very hoppy despite the age. Indeed, overly hop forward. A bit smoky underneath with lots of roasted malts and some cherries. An interesting approach no doubt, but not what I personally desire. If I'm going to have 600 calories in my glass, I want to taste every one of them! Nonetheless, very glad I tried it and one I will seek out again.
M - Somewhere between medium and full bodied. 
D - Again, an interesting and innovative approach to the style. As of now the jury is still out, so I must seek this out again. 874 charactersNYCWheatFanSC, Mar 05, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 Darkness poured into a tulip whiskey snifter
A: Dark tan head, frothy at first. Deep reddish purple color, very close to black.
S: Dried dark fruit and molasses. Maybe prune or black cherry. Smells sweet. Many complex smells that are hard to pin down.
T: Dark fruit with a bit of malt. Very sweet. Dark cherry or plum. No trace if hops until they punch through in the finish. The hop oils linger on the tongue after you swallow. Wouldn't be Surly without the hops, makes this beer even better. Hints of alcohol, not a surprise at this ABV. Multiple layers of complex flavors from start to finish.
M: Thick and chewy. Very fine carbonation bubbles.
D: Good drinkability for a beer this strong. Not an everyday beer but a very enjoyable experience, especially in cold weather.
Definitely worth the time and trouble to seek out this limited beer. Glad I picked up mutiple bottles when I did.
Another great unique beer from Surly. 937 characterscamp0474, Mar 01, 2010

A: Dark, dark purple, pretty much black. Reddish tan head. Some sticky lacing. 
S: Lots of dark, dried fruits. Molasses. Too much going on for me to comprehend.
T: Tons of dark, rich fruit. Very sweet up front. Malty sweetness. Dates, dark cherries? No sign of hops, then it comes out of nowhere and attacks the tongue in the finish. I can pretty much feel the residual hop oils after I swallow. There is a lot going on in this RIS.
M: Full bodied for sure. Thick, chewy and smooth. Carbonation is odd, but in a good way. Little "micro bubbles."
D: Great for a cold night. For how rich it is, it has great drinkability. It defiantly sneaks up on you though. 
*2010 Vintage*
A: Black as can be. Moderate dark brown, bubbly head. Decent lacing. 4.5
S: Rich dark chocolate. Dark fruits, cherries, molasses, vanilla. Some roasted malt and a hint of citrus hops. A little bit of alcohol in the background too. 4.5
T: Sweet roasted malts. Dark bittersweet chocolate and dark fruits. More vanilla and thick molasses. Its sweet for sure, but not overly sweet. The roasted malt and hops balance it out very well. Some citrus, pine hops and bitter roasted coffee come on near the finish. Doesn't seem as hoppy as last year's and not as sweet. Still just as good. 4.5
M: Fuller body, not quite as thick as I thought it would be. Low carbonation. 4
D: Very good drinkability. There is a touch of booziness, but it still goes down fairly easy. Good balance, tasty. 4.5 1,517 charactersherman77, Feb 28, 2010

S: huge chocolate raisins has some bright bitterness coming though. lots of roastiness with deep dark fruit tones. has some citrus faint lemon oragne
T: Really like the citrus of the hops contrasting with the large roasted malt. chocolate orange light raspberry truffle type flavor. after each sip i take i want another and another. once it starts to warm a little coffee comes out with some darker more bitter chocolate. i keep thinking of a chocolate covered strawberry with a dab of bitterness. really really tasty. 
M: Get a nice slick mouth feel that completely covers. really nice carbonation that blows up if you leave it in your mouth to long. It makes you drink it. after swallowing a couple times the bitterness comes through and dries my mouth out making me want to have another sip even more.
D: 10.3% isnt exactly the biggest beer but this beer just disappears after every sip. super super smooth and lucious. bitterness compliments the big malts really well. i could down this whole bottle in 30 minutes 1,098 characterschefmikeanderson, Feb 24, 2010

A- nice dark pour with thin 1 finger layer of tan head. 
S- lots of dark fruit, sweet caramel and roast malts
T- Nice balance of sweet and roasty, hints of chocolate in the finish, some fig and raisin up front. Pretty smooth beer not too much roughness for such a young bottle. 
M- Good mouthfeel, not to thick but still plenty of body to this beer. 
D- LIke most RIS its more of a sipper. but i could easily finish a whole bottle of this tasty beer.

A: I love the label art. Moderate pour yields one finger of dark brown head with great retention and a pretty, Guinness-esque cascade. Tight foam with superb retention. Opaque black liquid. This beer looks ideal and sets the bar high for others.
S: Coffee, cherry, citrus hop, earthy oakiness and some ethyl alcohol at the end.
T: Lots of flavor in here. Coffee, chocolate, strong vanilla, some estery alcohol, raisin, peach, plum. The alcohol is thankfully restrained. This beer tastes very sweet, like candy but is definitely not cloying. Very near perfect.
M: Very smooth, silky even. Some warmth never turns to heat. Perfect.
D: Way high. One of the best RISs I've had. I liked better than Abyss and Oak Aged Yeti. Where's the alcohol? I'd track this down again and I'm glad I bought another bottle to share with friends and family in CA. 990 charactersdfillius, Feb 24, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes that I found laying around. Thanks to Maximum12 for this from Secret Santa 09. Poured from a bottle into my Darkness tulip. The beer pours pitch black with a thick mocha head. The head faded pretty quickly and left some oily lacing on the sides of the glass.
The smell is very complex inviting. Licorice, dark roasted espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla sweetness leads to some dark fruits (cherries and raisins mostly). The dark fruits are fleeting and they lead to a blast of citrus hops, very strange for a beer like this.
The taste mirrors the smell, lots of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and that incredible citrus hop finish. Between the acrid roasted coffee and dark chocolate and the hoppy profile there is are fleeting notes of vanilla and cherry sweetness. An interesting flavor combination for sure.
The beer is thick, more carbonated than expected and has a nice dry finish from the hop profile. The alcohol is definitely present, but adds to the flavors more than it takes away. After one glass the alcohol becomes more apparent for sure, reminding me that this is a heavy-hitter. The flavors make this a beer I wish was more readily available, I would like to drink this more often. 1,234 charactersrpstevens, Feb 22, 2010

4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got from TATTORSA, thanks again! Poured from a 22oz cool looking bottle into my Corsedonk snifter. Vintage, I believe...2009. Red wax sealed. Started drinking at about 44 degrees. Figured I'd crack this one today for my B-day.
Pours a very dark, thick black with about a late building head...dark brown...and about a fingers worth. Head slowly dissapates and leaves great thick frothy lacing.
Aroma is wonderful. Lots of chocolate, maltiness, smokey coffee, and inviting bitters. Wow, the aroma is making my mouth water.
MMM. Excelent RIS. Like a DIPA meets RIS. Again, heavy chocolate flavors...followed by DIPA type sweet hops. Some sweet dark fruits are noticable, dark sugars, coffee, possibly even licorice?...finishing with a great tangy yet sweet flavor that sits on your tongue for quite some time.
What a wonderful RIS...I'll say it again. Thick, yet creamy and smooth. Very little carbonation which is ideal for this beer. Alcohol is well hidden at times, and very warming at other times which I found intriguing. 1,027 charactersShadesOfGray, Feb 16, 2010

A-an aggressive pour produces huge espresso colored head that is extremely thick and creamy. the retention is very good and it completely coats the glass as it slowly works down the glass. the beer is just one shade from pitch black and lets a hint of a red hue through with a maglite shined on it. very attractive beer!
S-the nose is average in strength. there is a light aroma of chocolate, molasses and tobacco that is taken over by the smell of sweet dark fruits. there is some dark cherries and raisins. the end brings a fair amount of hops, it actually has quite a hop profile. mostly citrusy hops
T/M-this is extremely thick, creamy, and chewy, very good feel. the body is quite full as it rolls down the throat. the taste is quite nice and bold. it brings dark chocolate up front, the dark cherry and raisins come in to complement the chocolate, some citrus hops and light bitterness fade in at the finish. 
D-this is extremely drinkable and very tasty. great feel and so creamy. it has bold flavors in the taste and really shows no presence of alcohol.

Review of the 2008 and 2009 side by side
2008
A-pours jet black liquid with dark tan colored head
S-the nose is nice, molasses up front, notes of dark chocolate, caramel and toffee undertones. the back has some fruity sweetness, raisins and cherries with notes of booze. still a faint citrus hop note, can't be but seems to be.
T-the taste is quite sweet, not a ton of roasted malts happening here. a good bit of molasses, notes of anise and dark chocolate. lots of sweetness in the back, cherries, plums, touch of raisin. hops aren't really present here.
M-full body, just a little thin, but so smooth and creamy, low carbonation but tight to hold the body. silky on the throat.
D-quite sweet but ever so smooth. one of the best feels on beer you can imagine. booze is gone, just present in nose, none in the taste.
2009 is pretty much the same with more hop profile in the taste. hasn't really evolved in a year. 2,056 characterscpetrone84, Feb 08, 2010

Superb drinking experience...mouthcoating, masaaging the palate with a strikingbalance of full rich dark cocoa, chocolate, smooth malt and yet a lightness on the palate that makes you take sip after sip and want more, perhaps due to the euphoria of a near perfect beer. Many tahnks to tizzod for the beer trade. 516 characterskenito799, Feb 07, 2010
3.91/5  rDev -11.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 409' Mummy vintage into my go-to stout approved snifter
Dark pour with a beautiful cinnamon colored fluffy head: nice
Smells perplexing with an initial whiff of powdery cocoa, currant, and a hefty dose of vegetative hops. There is a prevalent scent that I cannot wrap my senses around. It's alternately pleasantly sweet and sickening so. My beak hovers over the glass in a vain attempt to understand.
The initial taste matches the nose quite well. Sweetness is kept in check by a medley of light chocolate, currant, and a dark fruit/berry medley - plums? Leafy plantlike hops add a nice finishing shot. Served right out of the cellar at 55, this was quite appealing. As the beer warms, it becomes more muddled. Sweetness begins to overpower this beer and it's more difficult to separate the enjoyable initial layers. Borders on cloying.
Initially, on the tongue, this beer is a bit oily, but once it hits the back of the throat it's a stouty milkshake, almost chewy. 
The drinkability on this beer decreases as it warms. While not overpowering, the alcohol creeps in as the bottle dwindles. 1,094 charactersBarrytheBear, Feb 03, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2008, split two ways with Boothbeer into wine glasses. 750mL red waxed bottle with a great looking demonic character holding a skull. Not the typical Surly artwork, but impressive.
A- Pitch black at center with ruby to brown highlights when held to light. Latte colored head with large bubbles that reverse gravitate into a thick and creamy collar. Intricate lacing is formed as the heavy foam dissipates. No signs of carbonation are visible through this murky sludge.
S- Restrained licorice, dark fruits, a medley of boxed chocolates, and heat from the alcohol. Underneath these different aromas is a persistent sugary sweetness. While complex, this is lacking in intensity; I expected more.
T- Up front- intense sweetness accompanied by various dark fruits: prunes, dates, plums, and figs. There is a gradual progression that leads to a combination of roasted barley and dark fruits. At the end there is a only the roasted aftertaste balanced by a sugary sweetness- a combination reminiscent of molasses. Leaves a good amount of sugary residue on the mouth and lips. Moderate alcohol burn. Intense... more than made up for my disappointment with the aroma.
M- Very viscous and milky with little carbonation. The consistency reminds me of a warm glass of Ovaltine. If there was one aspect of this beer that I would equate with the name "Darkness", it would be the mouthfeel.
D- This is a sipper, but not because of the alcohol. The sweetness and viscosity make this one to be consumed in limited quantities. 
Notes: Drank this side-by-side with the '09, but did not review that vintage. The intensity of the dark fruits and sugary sweetness in the '08 separated that year from the '09. Additionally, the '09 had a hop bitterness than was not present in the '08. 1,776 charactersPecorasc, Feb 02, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 Vintage and 2009 Vintage
Got 08 in a trade from Maltzilla. Thanks to pecorasc for opening the 09 for our 08-09 vertical. Poured into wine glass. Very cool looking 750ml bottle. Bright red wax for 08 and burgundy wax for 09.
A:Pours thick and super dark. Lots of bubbles around the edges. Light tan head. Really good head retention. The 08 reduces to a film, but that stays there till the last sip. The 09 does not have any film on top. 
S: 08-Lots of dark fruit. Raisins and hint of prunes. 
09-Much less dark fruit. I get some earthy tones in the 09 that have obviously faded in the 08. 
T: 08-Wow. Not what I expected at all. Lots of dark fruit and sweetness. Then you get hit with a roasty finish. No coffee flavors, and just a hint of chocolate. Tons of raisins, prunes, and dates. Picking up molases and licorice as well. Might have a hint of soy though. Not what I expected, but still a great beer with very unique flavor. 
 09- I like this just a little better than the 08. Very different flavors. Get more alcohol and more complexity. Still get dark fruit, but I pick up more roasty, chocolaty flavors.
M: Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with just a little carbonation. Super creamy. Almost a 5.
D: very good drinkability. Alcohol lets you know its there, but doesnt hit you in the face. It is well masked. 
Overall great beer, but I like the 09 a little better. The only score I would change would be to give the 08 a 4.0 for taste (A- overall). Very different flavors, but both good in their own way. Really enjoyed trying these side by side. 1,560 charactersboothbeer, Jan 31, 2010

'09 bottle...
Thick on the pour.. dark dark brown head.. the brew is of course black... swirls give nice dark legs... great retention
Nose has tidal waves of dark malts ... fairly abundant hops that mesh well with dark chocolate and French Roast.. Honestly, no complaints.
The bitterness from the hops is apparent and combines with some drying dark malts and moves into nice RIS characteristics.. fudgey brownies.. grassy and mild citrus hops are pretty much there throughout the flavor.. coffee remnants that have a bit of dark malt bite... dry finish has some citrus hops and drying cocoa and bits of coffee....
Body is pretty dialed in.. carbonation seems maybe a bit high.. but it may be too warm at this point.. 
Reminds me alot of the 110K.. but the hops seemed more aromatic and somehow balanced.... pretty damn good beer.
Thanks again Jake!!
I wish I had taken better notes.... This is the 2nd bottle of the '09 I've had.. the '08 seemed a bit muddy the couple of times I tried it before, but it also seemed like it needed some time to find the stride.

4.08/5  rDev -7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Served on tap at darkness day 2009 at Hell's Kitchen in downtown Minneapolis. Have procrastinated a long time on reviewing this beer.
When I ordered it, I was presented with a 10oz goblet of very dark brown beer, with a luxurious looking half inch of head. The smell is right away of toasted malt with dark chocolate, can't quite put my finger on some of the other flavors, but very complex. I was surprised when I tasted it, very thick and syrupy. I taste toasted malt right away, much like the smell. After that passes, I get an explosion of other flavors, chocolate, expresso, I might even taste some fig in there. It took me a few sips to get a grasp for all that was going on. Good taste, but a lot of toasted malt and a bit of alchohol taste are going on. I was not a big fan of the mouthfeel of this one. I'm all for thick imperial stouts, but somehow this one was much more syrupy than I liked, it felt a little to sticky sweet in my mouth. The drinkability is good enough. Some alchohol presense, and a bit syrupy, but it can't be all bad as I still had two and considered a third. Good beer, didn't live up to my expectations though. 1,144 characterspdoran10, Jan 23, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle coutersy of NYCWheatFanSC. Pours like what you would exept from a big imperial stout. Thick black liquid pours from the bottle in a "gulb gulb" fashion. A very aggresive pour creates a large frothy head that is a very dark brown. Nice lacing appears as this massive brew settles down a bit. 
Smells way different than any RIS I've ever smelled. Big juicy citrusy hops are the first thing to reach my nose. Very intriguing. They interact much better than expected with dark bakers chocolate, and sweet dark fruity malts. Just a light roasty lurks in the background.
The first sips reveal dark roasted malts, quickly followed by a big citrus hops. The hops have tropical notes to them mango, peach, and alot of orange is coming through. It's almost like a big black IPA in terms of the hoppiness. It has a nice roasty finish that leaves me wanting another sip. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style smooth and creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation. There's not a hint of alcohol in this if not for a slight warming sensation I wouldn't know if it was there at all. I don't think I'll have a problem finishing this bottle at all. Very imteresting and complex beer. Glad I had the chance to try it. 1,212 charactersscifan, Jan 23, 2010

Thanks go out to my Grandparents for this one. They managed to secure me two bottles of this release. Awesome.
Chipped off the wax and poured this into a tulip glass. Served at cellar temperature. Extremely dark body. No light getting through this one. Complete darkness. Above the body a thin tan head clings mostly to the sides of the glass, leaving spider-webbed lacing. Looks beautiful and sinister at the same time.
Aroma contains lots of earthy, grassy hops mixed with chocolate malts and anise. Hints of sticky sweet molasses. Probably one of the hoppier RIS aromas I've had the pleasure to nose.
The flavor on this heavy stout is a mix of sweet malts and grassy, sometimes peppery, hops. The hops are more aggressive than many RISs, but complement the sweetness quite well, making this a very drinkable RIS. Diving into the flavor more one can pick out a good helping of chocolate malt and molasses. Anise is present as well, giving a sweet and spiced level of complexity to the beer. What is really surprising, however, is how well the alcohol is hidden. Besides some warming and a little bit of a kick once in awhile, it is almost unnoticeable. Overall, the flavor is a good mix of hops and a ton of dark/chocolate malt.
Mouthfeel is super smooth. Thick and velvety. Almost milkshake like. Low carbonation and warming alcohol. This beer's body is dead on for a RIS.
Drinkability is quite high. Especially for a beer of 10.3% ABV. Currently splitting this bottle with another BA and it is disappearing pretty quickly. So smooth and the well hidden alcohol. This beer is a sipper, but a quick sipper.
Overall, a truly exceptional RIS. One of the best beers I've ever had and a great example of the style. I'm really glad I have another one in the cellar and I'm excited to see how it ages. Great job Surly! 1,833 characterssisuspeed, Jan 21, 2010
4.61/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.509 vintage, poured into a wide-mouthed snifter revealing black body with a dense and thick milk chocolate head. Looks like a milkshake at the top. Strong lacing. As far as RIS's go, this is tops. Smells hoppier than I've ever had an RIS smell, especially in terms of floral notes. Underneath that there are meaty, roasted raw chocolate notes. All good smells.
Tastes sweet, malty and boozy. Nice thick roasted and chocolaty malt character with some vanilla to it. Quite bitter as well, which works well with the sweetness to cut through it and add gains in drinkability. Very smooth for its harshness. Carbonation is small and and tingly to a tongue-numbing point. I mean that in the best way. Quite warming. Heavy-bodied, but oh so smooth. For its sweetness, I find it quite drinkable.
This is a top-notch RIS. 813 charactersabuliarose, Jan 21, 2010

A: A gentle pour yields a .5 finger fine chocolate head with good retention. Quite carbonated for an RIS. Beer is a nice motor oil black though not quite as thick. Lacing is spider-web like. Doesn't get any better than this...
S: Nose is citrus hops which makes me a little confuzzled... from an RIS? Chocolate, roasted malts are present but pushed far into the background. Grapefruit is present as well as cocoa. 
T: Opens slighlty hoppy, chocolate, prunes, citrus, grapefruit, soy sauce, and surprisingly, not boozy at all. Hop character fades at the end, giving way to a more traditional RIS profile. Finish is a bit of roasted coffee bean sourness even though the coffee is absent from the rest of the experience. 
M: Medium bodied, coarse, carbonated, and not as oily or viscous as I expected. The feel works well here to integrate the flavors though. Finish is a bit sticky and sweet with a lingering hoppiness that dissipates rather quickly. 
D: I don't know how but the hop character works amazingly well for this beer. Very well balanced and perfectly executed, this one was the highlight of the night for me. What keeps it from being a 5 for me here is that I feel like I gotta be ready for this one. However, there's no doubt the hype is deserving of this beer here. 1,401 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 17, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Surly Darkness (2009) pours up quite viscous with barely enough effervescence to create a small, but uniformed camel-dark tan head that completely covers the nearly opaque bistre-garnet black body. The head retention is surprisingly good considering the alcohol. The aroma is expectately rich & complex with an array of roasted malts, burnt caramel, buttery toffee, dark chocolate & espresso notes combined with a light fruitiness reminiscent of cordial cherries, burnt rum-soaked raisins & blackened plums which layers nicely with the alcohol and slightly herbal hops to create an orchestra for the olfaction. The intense flavor starts off bold & rich with a blast of burnt caramel followed by a fruity, bittersweet dark chocolate/cocoa nib character that dominates the middle until the bitter roasted barley & earthy hops take over like Casey Jones driving a freight train straight to hell! Hint of Akvavit and/or Heering Cherry liqueur in the cheek warming finish. This heavy, full-bodied Imperial Stout shows some finesse, but becomes a bit chewy & syrupy towards bottles end. Surly Darkness is a frightful monster that will have mega-swillers running for their lives!

Vintage 2008. 500th Review!
Poured into a snifter. Wow, this is dense. Glugs out of the bottle thick and slow. This is the blackest beer I have ever seen. Held up to the light, nothing is coming through, not even at the edges. Oh man, what is this going to do to my stomach? Big warm chocolatey scents burst out of this beer. Wow! Slight sour note on the finish. Little soy sauce. 
The body is my favorite part of this beer. I want to wrap myself up in this and go to sleep. This is the smoothest, creamiest beer. Carbonation is present, but it is overwhelmed by such a buttery creamy mouth. Man. The flavor reminds me of a melted chocolate bar in a drink. Seriously. This is pure chocolate. Mild tartness on the back end, but it is sweet and creamy. Bitterness is low. Slight smokiness in the aftertaste. Geez. This is good. Drinkability is very high as the alcohol makes itself a ghost in the flavor. I'm feeling its presence a bit, but I can't detect it in the flavor. 
In all honesty, I didn't think I was going to like this beer. Even though it is so highly rated, I thought I would find it too much. It showed me a thing or two... 1,252 charactersOnenote81, Jan 14, 2010

(which was a bit different from when I had it on tap, not as good IMO, but still awesome.) 2008 vintage. Pours a syrupy black into a tulip. Thin tan head. This one is dark! Smells of some ripe dark fruits and then the chocolate. Lots of chocolate. Taste is similar- lots of deep bitter chocolate with some light coffee aromas too. The winner here is the mouthfeel, though! A super-creamy delight. As close to a beer milkshake as you can get. This is outstanding. The alcohol is well hidden behind all the chocolate goodness, so it makes it very drinkable. 621 charactersDrDogbeer, Jan 12, 2010

1st beer of 2010, here we go...
Opaque, tar, jet fuel, take your pick. this beer earns it's name, both thick and black sporting a large mocha head that maintains despite the high abv.
THis is what I call COMPLEX! 
THe nose presents a wonderful chocolate and roasted malt base. Ground coffee vanilla beans, some smoke, dark fruits and citrus hops also come to play. honestly if I were blindfolded I would guess that this was a DIPA of Barley wine. sweeter scent than expected.
The taste mirrors the nose making for the most interesting RIS I've ever had. the hoppiness really adds an interesting element to the chocolate/cofee/roasted malt vertabrae. the alcohol content is well masked and although this brew finishes dry, it is suprisingly sweeter than i could have guessed(all for the better IMHO)
The body is slightly thinner than expected but still enough body to satisfy. the CO2 runs on the lower side of things and makes for a slick and smooth overall feel.
One of the most interesting and unique (and pleasurable) beer experiences i've encountered. If you can get your hands on it, savor every drop! i want more! more I say! 1,192 charactersbonsreeb85, Jan 12, 2010

2009 Vintage
A: The pour is viscous, black, and wonderful. It fills the glass with a fluffy mocha colored head on top of the thick liquid below.
S: Generally with an RIS (or any stout, really) you don't expect citrus and pine hops to be the primary aroma, but that's just what we have here. The malt and other traditional RIS aromas don't come through quite as much as I would have liked. Still, the malt and chocolate and coffee do come through at times.
T: The hoppiness is still present on the tongue, but not quite as intensely. A good roasted malt background with some hints of coffee and chocolate. Perhaps a bit of dark fruits as well, which go interestingly with the hoppiness.
M: The body is nice and full and the beer feels quite creamy on the tongue. The carbonation is at a moderate level.
D: D: The booze is hidden very well by the myriad of flavors that are present. I wish, however, that this was more RIS like and not basically a black DIPA. 1,057 characterswomencantsail, Jan 05, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #100
Served from a 750ml bottle (2009), obtained via trade with Bulkman (a very generous trader and BA, thanks man!), into my two Darkness snifters (graciously picked up at Surly by kbutler1, thanks man!)at cellar temperature (12/25/09). I have been waiting some time to try this and I must say that it did not disappoint in the slightest. 
A: Pours a very thick motor oil black with a one finger mocha colored head with great retention and lacing. Exceptional looking Imperial Stout with a head that would just not go away at all.
S: WOW! What a unique and complex aroma we have here. First roasted chocolate malts jumped out along with some dark fruits, including blueberry, some molasses as well in addition to some smokiness and coffee. Perhaps a hint of piney hops in there too. Not exactly sure what I was expecting from the aroma, but this one truly blew me away with its complexity and depth.
T: And i thought the smell was unique and complex. The tastes brings about a whole new meaning to complex. Everything from roasted chocolate malt, dark fruits, blueberry, smoke, caramel, molasses, coffee, bitter dark chocolate, currant, toffee, licorice and vanilla. Truly amazed at the depth of flavor in this Imperial Stout. The finish has a slight bitterness brought on by some piney hops. 
M: Velvety thick and creamy with an appropriately low and creamy carbonation. A slight hint of alcohol in the finish, but really only when it is fairly warm.
D: Very drinkable for such a rich and full-flavored beer, but heaviness of the flavors, even though they are exceptional, will weigh you down at some point. The 10.3% abv. seems to be about as hidden as it possibly could while providing just a hint of warming as the beer is allowed to breathe.
Overall this is has got to be one the best and most unique Imperial Stouts out there. Not one particular flavor or tone dominates another allowing for exceptional complexity and uniqueness. Thanks again to Chuck for being so generous and helpful in allowing this experience to take place. And let's not forget Kevin for providing the Darkness snifters to fully round out this experience. A Must Try. 2,161 charactersLunch, Jan 04, 2010

But the flavor - after the requisite toasty/roasty/chocolate and coffee notes - surprised me with hints of cherry and old pipes (tobacco). I was impressed. This is a fabulous addition to the family of American Imperial Stouts of the first order. 356 charactersdedrinker, Jan 02, 2010

First review of 2010
Compliments of BuckeyeNation
Served in a crystal snifter glass
Pours a deep chestnut color with a two finger head of frothy and firm light brown foam. Bubbles cascade briefly as it rises up to a peak and settles slowly down, leaving a sheet around the inside of the glass.
Complex nose of dark chocolate, espresso, molasses, currant and subtle hops.
I'm struck first by the velvety and luscious mouthfeel, creamy and smooth and rich. This leads into the rich and complex flavors of cocoa and vanilla, a little milky upfront, morphing quickly to bitter espresso and molasses, charred bark and tart cherry. Finishes slightly dry, a bitter and puckery tartness lingers, punctuated by piney hops that underscore all the other flavors moving around. The alcohol strength is well hidden, but a slight warmth does move up the cheeks.
Tremendous beer, very flavorful and very drinkable despite its strength and depth of flavor. Many many thanks to BuckeyeNation for sending this my way purely as a gift, happy new year my friend. 1,059 charactersfar333, Jan 01, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Dansting for this one! 22oz bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown with a finger of tan head. Big piney hop aroma with some chocolate malt. Hits you right off with a blast of resiny hops. On the lighter side of full bodied. Not a lot of roasted barley, more on the black patent side. Fairly dry with a drying finish of hops and dark malt.Pretty drinkable for the ABV. It would be interesting to see how this ages.
More like a black DIPA (did I just make a new style?) than a RIS, but who really cares about conforming to style. This is a very interesting beer and fun to drink on a purely hedonistic level. 626 charactershomebrewhawk, Jan 01, 2010

S: Massive hop aroma similar to a strong American DIPA. Slight chocolate/coffee aroma in the background.
T: Molasses, chocolate, coffee, caramel, and roasted malts. Very complex flavor that is well balanced by the hop bitterness. I seem to be getting new flavors in every sip as the beer warms up. Alcohol is well hidden, but still warming. Absolutely amazing.
M: Thick, rich, and very sticky.
D: One of the best beers I have ever tried. Alcohol does sneak up on you though. 557 charactersmuttyd, Jan 01, 2010

Smells most delicios kinda chocolaty almost like the black death coffee we get at work. Taste has so much going on it is hard to nail it down every sip is something new from caramel to dark fruits to slight piney hops. Mouthfeel was nice smooth with a little bite I liked it, it was rough around the edges. As for drinkability man oh man all night if I could and didn't have to work in the morning. Well hidden 10 percent deffinatly a beer worth tracking down on tap. 564 charactersicefisherman, Dec 30, 2009
4.71/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First of all, a big thank you to BuckeyeNation for the stellar trade and hand delivery of this beauty.
With a fairly aggressive pour the precious contents produced more thick, dark mocha foam than impenetrably black liquid. The head lingered for quite some time, as I admired it and inspected other aspects. Though there was nothing that so much as resembled a highlight, I did detect prodigious quantities of tiny bubbles cascading upwards along the inside edge of the glass and joining the loitering frothy top. Thick lacing was left behind by the initial froth, but there was little later on. 
I found the nose roasty and smoky, mainly, with some fruity hops evident, upon early inspection. Later there were hints of licorice, relatively low levels of alcy heat, and a burst of black patent before some caramel malty sweetness that added some depth I was hoping for. It continued to grow richer and more complex. I was planning to up the score a notch, but, later yet, that blast of black patent seemed to hand on and overpower some of the other influences, and the score landed where it did. But it was a tough call.
The taste did not immediately lend itself, descriptively, to a plethora of elements. But, wow! Rich caramel malty sweetness, and strong roasty and coffee influences lead. A touch of hoppy and possibly roasty bitterness works its way in, as does vague licorice notes and vanilla. Barely noticeable alcohol. Extraordinarily rich and smooth. I struggled with the decision, and have decided to score it a 5, something I rarely do. 
Well but not over carbonated, with alcy warming that stops a bit short of burn. Thick, chewy, and viscous. Luxurious texture, and finishes clean. The just barely too strong warming keeps this from being a 5.
As good as any, joins a few other in setting the bar. Wicked smooth, rich, and complex. Just plain decadent. Wow. Yum. ...Thanks again to BuckeyeNation for making this experience possible. 1,950 characterssprucetip, Dec 29, 2009

pour is not quite jet black but very dark cola, almost black, with a cocoa head. little to zero retention and lacing
so much going on, bourbon, cherry, molasses, light floral hops, sweet roasted malts, vanilla, and a bit of booze
even more in the flavor. this was quite complex with a mixture of so many flavors. again, herry, molasses, light floral hops, bitter citrus hops, sweet and bitter charcoal roasted malts, vanilla, a bit of booze, dark fruit, and a touch of brown sugar. mind blowing.
thick! the glass has a slick glaze in it. its almost enough to chew on. 
this may be the best imp stout i have ever had. i want to drink the shit out of it but its 10.30 ABV (which is hidden well) and a 750ml bottle. it would be trouble, but "trouble loves me".

The nose is aggressive green, piney, and grassy hops with light citrus notes. Beneath the hop onslaught I find a fairly standard RIS, with a moderate roasted quality and notes of dark chocolate.
The flavor is pine resin hops with an upper moderate level of bitterness. I detect chocolate and a light roast, as well as some astringency. The hops are very aggressive, and they seem to clash with the traditional RIS flavors at every turn. This is a return to the hoppiness of the 2007 vintage, but the hops seem to clash here, where they melded nicely in the older vintage. What I have before me is a rather strange beer that isn't particularly drinkable or enjoyable, apart from the hoppy novelty factor. 829 charactersHopHead84, Dec 21, 2009

22oz bottle served in a standard pint glass.

Roasted malt, chocolate and earthy hops.
Chocolatey taste upfront with lots of roasted coffee bean character and a good dose of hoppy bitterness mixed in.

Black liquid with a huge cocoa colored head that took a while to settle and left cool looking lace.
Chocolate and sweet roasted malt fill my nostrils, faint and I mean faint bit of hops.
Taste is sweet roasted malt and sweet chocolate, a light touch of bitterness on the finish but any real hoppy flavors have long since faded.
Creamy, thick and rich brew that went down fairly easy considering the high abv. 996 charactersJoeyBeerBelly, Dec 18, 2009

Pours a deep dark midnight black with a cocoa coffee colored head. The head dissipates slowly into the night leaving lacing along the snifter.
The smell is of dried fruits, hops, roasted malts, cocoa, butterscotch and many other things I cannot identify. Very complex and pleasant.
Taste is like no other RIS I have ever tried. Chocolate, coffee, butterscotch, raisins, roasted malts, etc. As it warms a tobacco flavor becomes present. Very interesting taste that changes with the temperature.
Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, maybe a little chewy. Definitely a thick full body. Very nice on a cool winter's night.
Drinkability is good, very smooth and pleasant to slowly sip on. 696 characterspmccallum86, Dec 16, 2009

Poured black and thick with a big head. The head was probably three inches on my first pour and as the brew was drank down it had little lacing. I think the lacing was due to the glass it was in which had been in the dishwasher.
Smell was a bit underwhelming. Earthy hops and roasted coffee with sweet chocolate. I was hoping for something that just jumped out of the glass at me but it wasn't happening for some reason.
Taste was unlike any RIS I have ever had. Opened up with lots of earthy hops which moved into sweet chocolate and roasted coffee. As the beer warmed I could taste a bit of alcohol but not much.
Mouthfeel was alright. I'd say light to medium body for an RIS. Wasn't bad but wasn't great.
Drinkability was good. Not something I could drink pitcher after pitcher of but it was solid. I had no problem finishing the 22oz on my own. 
Overall, I would say this one was a great beer but didn't live up to the hype. Maybe it's better on tap? Not saying it's a bad beer but it's not mind blowingly good or anything. I enjoyed it though. Thanks Brad! 1,164 charactersauroracrisis, Dec 10, 2009

Just the fact that i waited three and a half hours to get it makes it taste even better. It pours thick in the glass with little head at first then forms a thin layer that emits a lovely aroma of dark fruit, sweet malt and a little hops. The taste is bold and full of strong malt with raisins and a linger of chocolate. It is a very nice beer for a cold winter night just after a long day of snow boarding. 495 charactersbrewanddrink, Dec 08, 2009

The nose on this is amazing. A nice combination of smeet malt, molasses, chocolate, raisins, coffee, and hops makes for a great aroma. 
The flavor is just as amazing. The malt takes center stage and the beer is wonderfully sweet and somewhat hoppy at the same time. 
As high as the alcohol is, it is amazing at how well it is hidden. Full bodied, rich, creamy, and nicely carbonated. Nicely drinkable for such a big beer. I wouldn't change a thing. 686 charactershardy008, Dec 05, 2009
3.67/5  rDev -17%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Chilled bottle, 2009 vintage, into a glass. Shared at a tasting. Received in a generous trade from KeefD. Thanks, Keith! 
I was a little concerned about this beer being awful, since largadeer compared it to Dark Lord, which I can't stand. I expected a drainpour. 
A: Pours a perfectly pitch black in the glass, letting no light through, even at the edges. The bottle is well-chilled, and a vigorous pour yields no head, but as it warms, swirling and agitation produce a nice, frothy mocha-colored head that rises to a finger in thickness. Sadly, it falls quickly into a light collar and a swirl of bubbles on the brew. No lacing. 
S: Barry (bring) made a comment that this smells like stir-fry and sesame oil, and as the beer warmed, I saw great hints of that. It also had a strong burnt (not roasted, but burnt) malt flavor that imparted elements of smoke and a light ashiness. Chocolate was also quite strong. There were no hops in the nose. 
T: The beer goes through oscillations as it warms. When cold, it is mostly charred and smoky. At a little higher temperature, it is burnt and acrid, with a little citrus in the finish. Slightly higher, and it develops a soy sauce / stir fry profile. As it approaches room temperature, the flavors meld into a nicer combination. Yes, there's a soy sauce / sesame oil flavor to it. Yes, there's still an acrid / burnt ash flavor in there. It's also strongly sweet, with chocolate, molasses, and a dark fruit variety (currants? Maybe figs). There is an underlying hop bitterness throughout, and it's more apparent in the finish where it manifests as a citrus burst and some earth. At room temperature, these seemingly clashing flavors merge into a pretty enjoyable profile. It's not the best imperial stout I've had, but it's quite well crafted. I have to say, though: no one in the room understood why people kept saying this beer is very hoppy; this bottle was not. 
M: Full body with a velvety feel from its low carbonation. It's slightly warming, but there is no real booze to it. 
D: As I said above, it's not the best imperial stout I've had, but I think it's solid. I expected it to be awful, and it turned out to exceed my expectations. I seemed to be the only one at the tasting who enjoyed it even this much, which surprised me. Normally I'm the Negative Nancy at these tastings. 2,337 charactersArbitrator, Dec 03, 2009

The beer is black. It's Darkness. The head is a dark brown but it dies to just a lace around the glass.
The aroma is very hoppy with only a hint of dark flavor in the back. Doesn't really live up to the Darkness title, as it it more bright and hoppy. Pine and citrusy orange peel come through with DIPA strength.
The flavor is mostly hoppy, with a syrupy, dark chocolate flavor hiding in there. There is a burnt, bitter finish from both the hops and the roast. Fruity hop flavors come through as orange and cranberry, reminding me of a chocolate covered fruits. There is a bit of a garlicy flavor as well from the overboard of hops.
The mouthfeel is thick, resiny, and oily. Slightly chalky finish. Slight warming feeling from the alcohol. This beer is hurt by the overboard of hops for the drinkability. Overall it seemed like there was too much going on, but I'd like to see how this tastes with some age on it when those hops calm down. 1,017 charactersjeffthecheff, Nov 30, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%Saved this one for my 35th B-day.
Took it out of the fridge a half-hour prior to opening.
Poured in a Duvel tulip.
A: Thick jet black body with a khaki-carmel-frap-looking head. The pour yields a "slow-burn" head which takes time to accumulate. Minimal lacing.
S: Hoppy, but not necessarily like an IPA. Not floral or citrusy. It's more oily and piney...Like I opened up an old chest in the attic.
T: Amazing. Drying coffee up front, sticky-sweet caramel, and finishing with a hoppy, bold tobacco. The taste of this cannot be overstated. So many RI Stouts come up dry and short. Soft and simple. Or they overdo the sweetness. Darkness has a sourness that powers through the chocolate cloying effect. This is a chocolate stout that is fleeting. It plays hide-and-seek all over the tongue.
M: Phenomenally robust. Fully festive. Hoppy as hell to balance the sticky sweetness. My lips are adhered to themselves and my mouth coated, yet the hops scream for another sip.
D: Sip it and you will be rewarded by it's hidden, sweet, dark fruits that become more brilliant as the darkness comes to pass into the dawn of inebriation!
This beer lives up to the hype. 1,160 characterssurlyseth, Nov 25, 2009

Pours black with a 2 finger tan/light brown head.
I'm caught off guard with huge citrus and floral aromas - is this a stout or an IPA? There are also background aromas of coffee, chocolate, licorice, toffee, and caramel.
Taste is very odd, but in a good way. This beer has qualities of both an Imperial IPA and a Russian Imperial Stout. There is grapefruit mixed with chocolate, lemon with coffee, orange with caramel. These are very odd combinations together, but they surprisingly work well together.
Mouthfeel is thick and coats very well.
Overall this is a very different stout than I'm used to because the floral and citrus notes are in the forefront right now with the stout flavors in the back. I'm going to give my 2nd bottle a year in the cellar and see how it develops. 847 charactersbmanning, Nov 23, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Serving glass: Poured from magnificent 750ml bottle into Snifter.
Appearance: Exceedingly dark brown that might as well be black with a thick mocha head that mostly recedes, but only after several minutes.
Smell: Very fruity aroma for a RIS, with a strong citrus hop bitterness. Some floral notes (roses?) are apparent as well as something akin to raw meat. The roasted aroma is quite low, with just a slight touch of chocolate.
Taste: Same as the aroma, it is very fruity, both due to the malts (plum, figs) and the hops (citrus). The citrus is especially off-putting, but in a good "wow I didn't realize that could work" way. Also notice some rich molasses, licorice and chocolate, with a nice mild bitterness at the end.
Feel: Low carbonation, full chewy body that is exceptionally smooth.
Drinkability: I really can't tell this is over 10% at all. Despite how thick it is, it is very easy to drink. Overall, not a typical RIS at all considering the lower roasted character and the citrus hops, but quite exceptional. 1,025 charactersbsp77, Nov 22, 2009

D - Potent, but delicious. A good contemplative sipper. 601 characterstrbergman, Nov 22, 2009

The pour was gloppy at first without bubbles, but then a rush of carbonation appeared and formed a large charred oak head that cascaded to the top of the glass. Rich, dark foam has good retention and leaves a good amount of lace as well. Hard to find a finer looking brew. The aroma is a heady mixture of sweet roasted malts and some sticky hoppy accents. Heavy herbal notes, soy, anise, licorice and earthy hops. French roast coffee with five sugar cubes.
Tastes of sweet grapes, prune, bit of chocolate, and plenty of roasty and herbal elements. Earthy, sticky, cookielike, and doughy finish. Full bodied, a bit chewy, silky, medium carbonation. I had heard the 2009 was a return to "hoppy goodness," but I actually prefer the 2008 version without so many herbal flavors in it. 818 charactersvacax, Nov 22, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage - Bottle and Tap (Little to no Difference)
Appearance:
Pours out nearly black with a beautifully creamy, short dirty brown head that leaves a huge amount of lacing, almost a sheet.
Smell:
Sweet and very heavily roasted caramel is almost completely masked by something very odd in a Russian Imperial Stout, HOPS. It almost made me put the glass back down as was a bit afraid, but I persevered and continued on. The brew is also heavily scented with alcohol. (The rating is as high as it is as the hops intervention actually grew on me as I continued through the glass).
Taste:
Huge beer. Syrupy sweet of roasted caramel, chocolate and alcohol with a very big presence of hops typical of nearly all Surly beers. Finishes slightly bitter. Unique, but good balance.
Mouthfeel:
Buttercream smoothness with a very light carbonation. One of the heaviest beers I've gotten to try. Awesome.
Drinkability:
Really strong beer, 10.30% will floor nearly anyone. I loved the experience of this beer and recommend it to anyone that can get their hands on this rarity. Split the bottle though because you really get burnt out by the end of a glass. (We split our bottle 3 ways and that was about perfect)
Comment:
Have only heard rumors of this one up until this year where my lovely wife con-ed a friend out of one of his bottles (Sorry AJ). If I had more than one of these, I would have aged it. Maybe with next year's release...
Surly is a local brewery that is known for its hop packing. I was less than thrilled with in my first experience (Furious for a non-IPA fan) but even that grew on me with it's complexity. Very solid brewery. 1,643 charactersCRichardsMN, Nov 22, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Enjoyed this one over a long sunday. Received from fbm115 and reviewed from notes. this was the 09 bottle
A: Syrupy black, with no light able to get through that had an espresso like frothy head about half an inch thick that sat atop. The head retention was great and the walls were covered with spider webbing.
S: Heavy milk chocolate aroma up front followed by a far amount of roastiness, then a super burst of citrus hops which caught me by surprise.
T: Again it starts out with the sweet chocolate then leads into a bitter roastiness and a bitter hoppy finish. Some nices mocha notes were present as well and much of the coffee and espresso flavor came out as it warmed. My main criticism was the lemon hoppiness which felt odd
M: Big bold flavors, with plenty of body to spare. It did get slightly heavy at times, but there was no booziness and lots of creaminess to rectify that.
D: I remember asking myself while I was drinking this, is this an A beer? I was able to finish the bomber myself over the course of the day, but wish that I had someone to share it with at times. I also was not super keen on the amount of hoppiness in this stout. Something I would surely have 1,184 charactersmikey711, Nov 18, 2009
4.21/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Steve (fbm115) for the opportunity to try this. I've been waiting to mark it off my list. It doesn't disappoint.
This is a good looking brew: dark with amber edges, and a light fluffy brown head that graces the surface as softly as silk. The smell is, well, different; different, that is, in terms of imperial stouts. The big standout here is HOPS! Hops in a major way. They mix interestingly (not badly, but not necessarily well either) with your typical RIS characteristics: dark, roasted malts, with a dark fruit sweetness (cherries), chocolate, and alcohol. The hops add a citrusy "flair" that is, as before, interesting.
The taste is as interesting as the smell, but better. It takes a little getting used to, but all the complexity of a good RIS is here. It's sweet and majorly chocolatey, with a just a little roastiness. There are hints of caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. overall, very sweet. To throw excessive amounts of hops in the beer almost seems stupid at this point, but it somehow pulls it off. there is a citrus hop flavor up front that is immediately subdued by the more traditional stout flavors mentioned above. The hops do remain present throughout, though, and are most notable in the oily mouthfeel and the bordering-on-hop-bitterness finish and aftertaste. I taste DIPA, and I taste RIS. This is a beer experiencing an identity crisis, something that perhaps a little maturation could help. overall, its very intriguing and very interesting; on top of that, its actually pretty damn good. 
The mouthfeel is silky smooth and extraordinarily well-carbonated. nice and thick as well. 1,622 charactersjdklks, Nov 18, 2009

A: Pours black with a tan head that doesn't want to go away. The foam sticks to every part of the glass it touches. One cannot see through this beer. This is Darkness.
S: Roasty as the fires of hell. Coffee, molasses, chocolate, licorice, and slight boozines dominate the aroma, followed by some slight hop notes.
T: At first, the malt comes with a blast of chocolate, espresso, caramel, molasses, and anise. Dried dark fruit and caramel are in the center. It finishes dry with a slightly bitter hop profile. Simply the best release of this beer to date.
M: Full bodied and viscous, this beer has it all. Body, flavor, and a mind of it's own.
D: If it weren't so limited and so strong, I would drink this all night. The best Russian Imperial Stout I have ever tasted. I can't wait to see what they taste like in a few years. 902 charactersWYVYRN527, Nov 17, 2009
4.21/5  rDev -4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Sparklepants for this awesome brew. 
The appearance of this one is superb. Super high SRM, like pushing the limits on this one, dark as night. The head is caramel colored and sticks around for some fun. Great small bubbles, head foam is dense. The legs on this one are beautiful, alcohol residue as well as heavy lacing. Great look on an epic brew. 
The smell is hoppy, interesting. Molasses and licorice, with HUGE roasted grains. Some ABV is present, also some burnt coffee smells as well. What is going on with the hop character in the smell? I am not liking it, gives off a citrus-grapefruit characteristic that kind of clashes with these darker fruit smells. Toffee and caramel, sweet dark candy is very present as well. 
The taste is good, but not blended very well. There are very strong characteristics of roasted and black malts. There are also roasted coffee flavors as well, but not coming from actual coffee, most likely coming off of the malt. This coffee malt gives it an earthy flavor as well. Black licorice and a lot of the ABV are noticed. The ABV is nice because it brings out the roasted malts more and also some chocolate. Why are hops coming through so strong?!? Citrus bitterness is such a strong characteristic in this one that it stands out from everything else. I went to the Surly website and they say that they 'add a touch of hops to make it tastier'. NO! It makes it a totally confused RIS. Chocolate is strong in the brew as well as caramel and toffee. I cannot believe the hops in this, really misunderstanding the direction the brewers wanted to go with this one. Starts on such a good direction and the hops throw a wrench in the clogs. Weird. 
The mouthfeel is great and creamy. Lots of hot ABV flavors help you out as well as the roasted malts. Perfect carbonation, really great. 
The drinkability is really good for a few bumps in the road. This is still a really good beer but. . . overrated. Maybe it is just me and how I like my RIS', but this much hops in a RIS? Sure you add them for bitter aspects, but if they dry hopped this with a bunch of hops then they are very brave in doing so. I think that the hops bring the beer down and distract from the other great flavors in this beer. 
Thanks again to Sparklepants for sending me this. Knocked out another 'big RIS' that I have always wanted to try.

4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 bottle signed by Omar and Todd. (thanks for the hook up supercolter!) Poured into a tulip glass
A: Pitch black body. Massive dark brown-khaki head. Lasted for a few minutes before crashing into a thin, frothy skim. Rather dense lacing up and down the glass. 
S: So many things are going on here. Molasses, chocolate, coffee, citrus hop bitterness, caramel. With each inhale the molasses seems to grow more dominating. If that was toned down just a bit everything else would come together flawlessly.
T: Sweet milk chocolate, brown sugar and molasses are prevalent up front. Slight undertones of coffee and dark chocolate. Lively bitterness throughout. Some fig and raisin like fruityness.
M: Surprisingly thin at first. Not exactly "watery" though. But it didn't have the weight and consistency I was expecting though. No booze burn. As the beer warmed more heft was apparent.
D: I originally poured this into two glasses to share with the lady, but I stole what was left of her half after I finished mine. The sweetness, in the end, killed me as it wasn't as easy to get through the last few ounces as it was with the first dozen or so
All in all a top notch stout that shows you can do big bold flavors without making it a flammable bourbon barrel aged brew. Reminds me of an amped up Victory Storm King Stout. 1,323 characterscallmemickey, Nov 14, 2009

A: Black. More opaque than me. Nice brown two finger head with beautiful lace. Needs more texture and longevity though.
S: Very strong of Molasses, some cooked sugar, but no roast. Also no hops, just carmelized malt. Phenominal.
T: Tastes. Black. No roast though. Smooth, dark, sweet. Cooked sugar again, more molasses. Dark Chocolate, no Alcohol.
M: Creamy. Perfect carbonation. Super smooth.

4.17/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 4This is an excellent RIS that is deserving of high praise, however, I'm not sure it is on the same level as the oft-compared Dark Lord. Just to make sure, I tried a little DL later in the evening (my friend was kind enough to open a bottle). Nope, no comparison, DL reigns supreme.
I tried the Surly giant on tap last night at the 3rd annual Bavarian Lodge Darkness night. Pours "almost" black, not nearly as viscous as expected. Has a pleasant, hoppy, chocolate aroma. Tastes of coffee, dark fruit such as cherry, maybe a little raspberry and a definite hop character. 
This is very dry. Almost too dry. It left a chalky after-taste on the tongue. I heard that Omar felt this year's batch was more dry than last year's. While I cannot comment on the year-to-year comparison, I have to wonder if the recipe or process was a little off in this year's batch. I didn't feel like it should be so dry.
In all, this was a great pour that I was happy (hoppy?) to try, but alas, this is more akin to North Coast's Old Rasputin RIS than the might Three Floyds' DL.
Would I drink it again? Yes, I sure hope so. 1,104 charactersPrinceDarren, Nov 13, 2009

A-Pours black with a massive two finger bubbly sandy colored head. The head has great staying power and rests at about half its initial layer. Tons of lace is left in between each sip. This beer is truly great looking.
S-Completely different than what I was expecting. From its appearance I thought it would be a roasted malt monster. Instead it has a huge citrus hop profile that is more akin to a good IPA. There is some roast malt and some earthiness to be found, but it stays in the background. Coffee aromas did come out after it had been sitting in the glass for a decent period of time.
T-Citrus hops and chocolate are both very strong at the start. It has some sweetness and acidic citrus zing midway through each sip. The citrus flavors return on the finish. The aftertaste is all dark malts with chocolate and roasted malt flavors. 
M-A lot lighter in the body than I expected. It is very smooth from the massive head and has a nice carbonation level.
D-This is an extremely drinkable beer that completely veers from the traditional roasted malt/vanilla RIS. Well worth seeking out.
I really enjoyed this beer. I would love to try one with some age to see what happens as the hops fade. 1,332 charactersmjl21, Nov 13, 2009

The smell was dark fruit, sweet malt, and a light chocolate. 
Delicious. Very sweet malt with a hint of dark berries, a little currant. There are touches of chocolate and dark roast coffee, but both are minimal. 
Mouthfeel is creamy, but not too thick. Finish is dry and slightly bitter in a chocolate or coffee kind of way. 
The alcohol was detectable, but not 10% detectable. This is a sipper, but damn tastey. 
This is one of the better RISs out there, no doubt. 584 charactersVonerichs, Nov 12, 2009

Dark black in color, though as the beer dropped I noticed some light shining through the edges revealing a maroon reddish hue to the beer. 
S: Plums, prunes, raisins, figs, and shit like that. Sweet and slightly alcoholic. 
T: Very sweet malt on the front receding to a wonderful array of dark fruit and dry cocoa. Maybe a little coffee and some dark roasted malts, but these are not center stage. 
M: Thickish, but not cloying or oppressive. Low carbonation. 
D: Very good. Not the best RIS I've ever had, but I can see what the fuss is about. A very good, high quality beer that tastes great and drinks easily. 735 charactersFlorida9, Nov 12, 2009

T: A huge, rich, complex flavor, sweet then dry, very long and complex. Bitter herbs, then bitter cocoa, then creamy coffee, then sweet tea.
M: Chewy but not thick, hefty but not cloying
D: Very satisfying, a tiny bit boozy as it warms. I would have to be in a special mood to get through 22oz of this... perhaps in my library, in front of a roaring fire, my pipe and slippers at hand, my faithful hound dozing by the hearth. 641 charactersMaction, Nov 09, 2009
3.61/5  rDev -18.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.522oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2009 vintage. Thanks to bmanning for sharing this bottle with me. I had a hard time with this review. This beer was much, much different than I expected (or indeed expect from any RIS). Although I can see why some BA's love it so much, I would be very put off if other breweries try to replicate the style of this beer. It really seemed like a DIPA that used roasted malts and a longer than usual boil to simply be darker than usual, but still remain essentially an IPA like drinking experience. It wasn't different enough from expectations to give it bad scores exactly, but I did not find it a great example of an RIS.
A = Dark mahogany, coppery tan medium sized head with a mix of foam, small bubbles and a few large bubbles. Decent retention.
S = Strong, strong citrus smells of grapefruit rind and lemons, hiding under that is some burnt coffee, very light smels of roasted coffee beans and cocoa powder, after a good swish I pick up uncooked bread dough. Even with those other scents though, the entire experience is one of floral "C" hops with everything else playing second fiddle. It seems like it must have been heavily dry hopped or something. Rather than simply using hops for their bittering properties and letting bitterness from hops meld with forceful malt flavors such as coffee, chocolate, tobacco, etc., this beer seems to simply be all about hops smells and flavors.
T = The tastes of this just continue the jarring mental disconnect I get between what this beer looks like, what I look for in an RIS and what I am in fact getting. There is just a crazy mix of flavors, though, it's like drinking a mocha coffee drink that has been randallized using Pacific NW piney/citrusy hops varietals, bringing flowers, grapefruit, lemons zest, light resiny pine. Hidden behind all this are more of the flavors I would expect to stand out more. There is definitely the coffee and chocolate notes one often finds and also some dark fruits. All in all it is kind of like a black IPA on steroids rather than a strong bitter stout.
M = Medium-heavy full body, decent carbonation to keep the beer interesting and flowing in the mouth, good mouthcoating.
D = This just wasn't all that drinkable for me. I enjoy both sweet imperial stouts and bitter imperial stouts. I really do not particularly care for extremely strong C hops flavors clouding up the issue though. I drank my glass, but really did not particularly want another one. I may see about trying this again if it has been aged some, but I do not think I will seek out a fresh bottle. 2,587 charactersTraquairlover, Nov 08, 2009

A: The name of the beer pretty much says it all
S: hoppy earthiness sits atop a syrupy sweet malt backbone with roasted notes along with dark cherries. There is a lot going on here, and I must say it all seems to be working
T: The sweetness was the first thing I noticed in the taste as the dark fruitiness comes out along with rich dark chocolate. All of this is balanced by piney and bitter hops which provide for a deep earthy flavor. Everything is in balance. Simply delicious. 
M: chewy viscous texture that is velvety in the mouth while leaving a stickiness 
D: I wish I could drink a lot more of this, this beer is ridiculously drinkable for its high abv. The sweetness is nicely balanced with the hoppy profile and it makes for an incredibly complex RIS. Can't wait to get my hands on a few bottles of this! 857 charactershomebrew311, Nov 08, 2009

A - Pitch black with a smallish tan head with lacing
S - Roasty, fruity, possibly some coffee
T - I couldn't be caught more off guard by the flavor. It is super sweet, almost like unfermented wort. There are wort like malt flavors, roasty, coffee. These are followed by a huge hop bouquet. Almost IPA like in its hop quality
M - Medium-high carbonation and medium-high in body.
D - I wouldn't be able to drink much of this. Decent beer, not my cup of tea. 499 charactersMartin2D, Nov 08, 2009

Poured into the appropriate Surly Darkness snifter creating a dark brown 2'' frothy head. Slow to recede, leaving a solid cap and lights thin lace streaks. The brew is black, no light penetration.
Aroma is big with dark fruits, chocolate, molasses, malted milk balls, slight booziness. Some mild spicie aroma coming forward and a touch of grassy hops and floral orange peel cascade aroma in the background. 
Mouthfeel as usual is slick and creamy with just a touch of carbonation to balance. 
Taste is decadent as always. Seems as though there is a bit less hop flavor this year, which is totally fine, but hops still do exist in flavor, just not as strongly as 2008.
Molasses, a touch of vanilla beans, dark roasted grains and bittersweet b akers chocolate. Some syrupy flavors in there too, with just a touch of burnt oak. 
As always an exception brew, not only local but nationally a great beer that must be tried...if you can get your hands on it. 1,057 charactersBuebie, Nov 07, 2009

Found it on tap at 3 Squares in Maple Grove, MN (and ended up getting the last glass from the last keg).
S: The scent had strong coffee and sweet malt. Out of the bottle it had a very strong hop scent, but on tap this was extremely muted. I actually prefer the lower key hops.
A: Dark brown to black body with a big rocky loose head. This head was much less obvious because they poured it into a pint glass at the bar while I had poured it into a tulip at home. It still had a head that stuck around for a very long time and covered extremely well.
T: The booze seemed to be more concealed on tap which I appreciated, and the hops was much less noticeable. Their was still a distinctive fruit sweetness about the beer, along with coffee notes. Again, there was little to no chocolate character. I prefer the taste of the tap over the bottle.
M: The mouthfeel took a bit of a step back on the tap. It may have been because I was getting the final glass from the keg and they needed to wait for it to settle. The body went from a medium in the bottle, up to a med-heavy on the tap. The carbonation went from low, to borderline flat. It still had considerable head, so it wasn't actually flat.
D: The drinkability of this RIS remains extremely high. It is a great beer, but it will catch up with you in a hurry.
O: I prefer the taste because of the lower hop character (compared to the bottle), but I would still like to see more chocolate character. This remains a treat, and I felt very lucky that I managed to get this on tap to compare. Great beer, can't wait for 2010. 1,624 charactersdpnelson1978, Nov 07, 2009
4.01/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the Darkness release part at Sheffields in Chicago.
A - In a heavy glass chalice, looked thick like oil in the dark bar. A small tan head which was barely present by the time I got to mine. Nice lacing throughout the course of the drink, very attractive beer.
S - I think this is the strangest smelling stout I've ever smelled. I half thought I had the wrong beer for a while. Get some deep coffee and chocolate, with some undertones of vanilla and a touch of raisins. The strange part of all of it was the distince hops smell on the end of the nose. Very odd.
T - Is this really an RIS? It's either a really interesting take on one or it's just not. Don't get any of the classic stoutish taste on this. Very creamy and chocolatey with a nice splash of vanilla in the middle. Faint IPA-ish taste at the end due to the hops, how very different. I like it, but not at all what I was expecting.
M - Smooth and creamy, leaves the mouth cleanly with a mild hoppy bite at the end. Full bodied, but not heavy like I would expect a heavy stout to be.
D - Can't believe it's 10%+. Way too easy to drink, sessionable stout. Even those who have a hard time drinking stouts could get this one down with no problem. 1,217 charactersAgentZero, Nov 05, 2009

A- Poured into a tulip. Pours a really deep brown color with a dark khaki head. 
S- Smells really caramel-ly at first. Also, dark fruit(raisin, cherries?), toffee, a piney, earthy hop smell and a bit of ethanol.
T- The dark fruit is the first thing I taste followed by the chocolate, roasted malt and finishes with a sweet and bitter hop taste as well as a bit of sweet alcohol.
M- Really smooth and creamy, yet pretty well carbonated. Thick body.
D- It's pretty easy drinking considering the ABV, although very much a sipper. The alcohol got to me after awhile. The taste really lingers on your palate for awhile after drinking it. Overall a great, unique beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. 785 characterssamie85, Nov 05, 2009

Acquired at "D-Day,"coming in at about number 780-790 in line arriving at 10:00AM (just barely made the 800 person cutoff point).
Appearance: Poured into the go-to DFH snifter. Pours like syrupy molasses, forming a nice 1" dark tan head that has some stickage. No light escapes from this beer, much as the name suggests. 
Smell: Smells of a rich chocolate dessert. Chocolate malt, dark Belgian chocolate, a little coffee, and a nice hoppy bitterness underlying it all. Vanilla, molasses, and some alcohol lingering in the "darkness." 
Taste: A chocolate fountain's worth of sweet chocolate with loads of molasses intermingling. Devil's food cake with real fudge melted down and drizzled on top. Some floral hops evident up from, with some bitterness coming in a bit in the middle to prevent the sweetness from becoming overwhelming. The bitterness transitions nicely to finish with the sweet bitterness of the roasted malts. A marked smokiness emerges a little as it warms.
Mouthfeel: Viscous. It feels almost uncarbonated as it goes down. Silky smooth velvet, achieving all the taste of a rich dessert meant to be eaten with a fork, though somehow sliding down without a clench of the jaw. 
Drinkability: The combination of tasty flavours and citrusy hop resins make the alcohol almost unbeknownst to the consumer. 1,334 charactersdarklordlager, Nov 03, 2009

Scent of bitter juicy hops, chocolate, oatmeal, roasted malts, and Candi Sugar. Grassy, lightly floral, and a bit spicy with a hint of alcohol, the hop profile here is great, better than it is in most IPAs.
Taste of bitter dry hops, chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruit and Candi Sugar. Not quite as juicy as last year, but this is still one of the best Imperial Stouts available, and the strong hoppiness is a great change of pace.
Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth with a small bite of carbonation. 589 characterspaco1029384756, Nov 01, 2009

Poured into Darkness Snifter
Pours a deep motor oil black. Nice 1+ finger of dark tan head.
Decent retention with some splattered lace and a few rings.
Aroma: Big fresh earthy hop profile. Chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, very big and robust. I love how the hop profile is so defined with this beer.
Taste: Again, the fresh earthy hops stick right out here. Backed by a big chocolate roasted malt backbone. Nice coffee notes. Very great beer.
Mouthfeel: It is slight bitter from the hops, but very smooth. Very big, full body with a nice amount of carbonation. Ends fairly clean, but very slight sticky from the hops. 
Overall, a damn great beer. I love this RIS and glad I have more. If you like hoppy RISs this is the beer for you. I am very impressed with this years batch. 812 charactersmothman, Nov 01, 2009

A - Pours an almost pitch black stream that settles like tar in the glass. Not much of a head, just a thin sheet of mocha head that lasts forever.
S - smells pretty sweet, but not as bad as fresh Dark Lord. A small bit of roasted malts, chocolate, and a touch of dark fruit rounds it out.
T - Roasted chocolaty malts with a hint of prunes. Definitely less sweet than the smell, but any bit of hops is pretty much gone. Aftertaste of cigars and coffee.
M/D - This is thick and frothy beer. A great mouthfeel, but it is way to thick to be extremely drinkable. One bottle is going to take me a while to finish, but I'm enjoying every sip. 744 charactersxpimptastikx, Oct 31, 2009

A pitch black oil slick in a glass. The head and retention are both amazing. It looks like melted coffee ice cream and is leaving the stickiest lacing I've ever seen.
The nose is full of burnt sugar, dark fruits soaked in simple syrup, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, piney hops, a little alcohol. Think sticky and sweet.
The first sip is tooth destroyingly sweet. Liquid bitter chocolate, coffee beans, burnt malts, syrupy dried figs and prunes. I'm not picking up on the alcohol, but I know it's there because I'm starting to feel it. I can taste the hops more as it warms, but it's also getting stickier and cloying.
Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a low level of carbonation.
I'm really hoping the syrupy sweetness really mellows out in the cellar because otherwise this will turn into a sugary mess. I'm still happy to have tried this year's vintage. 1,081 charactersbeertooth, Oct 30, 2009
3.96/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750 ml bottle into guinness pint glass. 2009 vintage
the bottle pours a kind of stealth head: at first it seems to be making no head, so then I pour a bit harder, and we get a bit of progress; then the whole thing explodes with this slow moving, creeping foam. I think at the most it was three fingers, it retains well enough. the colour of the foam is a solid tan colour, and the texture is very creamy. the body is indeed dark, but some light does get through the bottom. the nose is simply malts with bitter hops, quite hoppy actually. the taste is quite like the nose: a very hoppy RIS with a huge malty keel. aside from the hops, it is pretty standard tasting for my palate. a bit of something sweet, like cherries, on the aftertaste. the feel is good, pretty thick, but not as much as dark lord. 802 characterserz316, Oct 30, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52007 vintage.
A: Pitch black with decent pale beige head that leaves a lot of creamy lacings.
S: Wonderful aromas of roasted malts, dry coffee notes, rich fruity notes (plums, cherries, figs) and hints of spicy hops. Very balanced and very impressive.
T: The taste is nothing but fantastic - really balanced and spot on. Everything is where it's supposed to be. The flavors are very complex - sweetness from the malts, salt licorice and a bitter finish. Powerful roasted malty aromas and notes of luscious dark fruits, a hint of molasses, tannins, coffee, wood and leafy hops. The finish is somewhat dry and bitter with notes of licorice, leafy hops and malts.
M: Full-bodied with a fat and creamy malty mouthfeel. Gentle carbonation.
D: Almost unbelievably good. Very balanced. The composition is like a symphony - carefully orchestrated with everything at its proper place. 880 charactersricke, Oct 29, 2009
4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5After coming up empty glassed at 3 locations I scoured the forums and got another tap serving (had one at Darkness day in a plastic cup) of 2009 Darkness
A: The Bartender poured it marvelously, big 6 cm coffee colored head that slowly faded into Darkness...okay, a little cliche. The usual strapping black body was present too. I couldn't complain about the glassware, a brand new Darkness snifter glass that I used to own until I broke it.
S: Smoked chocolate, sweetness, alcohol masked in the nose.
T: Palate boner - delicious dark chocolate, roasted espresso beans, big citrusy hops. Seemingly much more balanced than the '08, though I question the evolution of beer geek palates. Oddly enough this serving fared better than what I had at Darkness Day. The complexity increases as it warmed and is good incentive to cup the snifter with my warm palms.
M: Thick and moderately creamy. It can keep up with the big boys without being oatmeal.
D: Oh man, deliciousness. I am tempted to find an excuse to drink another serving tomorrow, pending it's availability. It's more than just hype with the beer, a real pleasurable experience.

4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served from tap into a snifter:
Appearance and Smell:Served nice looking black with a very inviting looking frothy brown head which had nice retention and gripped the glass nicely. Smelled of burned sweet chocolate, and caramel with a bit of floral scent.
Taste and Mouthfeel:Tasted of very roasty dark chocolate and creamy caramel with what almost seems like burned vanlla hiding inside this. Really had a sweet silky feel to it, very unique. Alot of citrus like hop pressence on the end of this thing with just a touch of ABV showing its head really kept this brew interesting to the senses. A very well crafted brew with plenty of complexity which really touched on many different levels.
Drinkability:I really liked this brew, ALOT more character to this than I even expected. I'll definitely be visiting this again. 823 charactersblackenmn, Oct 28, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52007: Bottle #483. Poured into a tulip glass a dark black/brown color with a slight tan collared head. Roasted aroma with dark chocolate. Very slightly sweet start with a very strong bitter chocolate roasted aftertaste. Some booze is evident. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. The most roasted flavor out of the 07-10 iterations. I would call the 07 the "roasty,dry version"
2008: Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass the usualy brown/black color with a nice tan head, way more carbonated than the 07 vintage. Roasty, dark chocolate aroma. Extremely sweet compared to 07 version which in my opinion isn't very sweet at all. Starts with a sweet start with flavors of molasses and brown sugar and stays sweet the entire time. Some bitterness in the middle. It's actually pretty decent IF you like sweet stouts, it not, then you probably won't like this years. 
I would call the 08 the "sweet version"
2009: Had this on tap at Hell's Kitchen for the release party. Served in a small goblet.
Extremely dark color with dark tan head, just like a RIS should look. Had a more subdued smell than I was expecting but picked up notes of coffee and sweetness. The flovor profile starts sweet but has a huge hoppy bitterness to it that is unlike most RIS's. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very drinkable and smooth. I have several bottles of this and can't wait to see what it's like with some aging! 
I would call the 09 the "hoppy version"
2010: Less hoppy than the 09 version and better balanced. The appearance is not much different than the other years with the classic brown/black with a dark tan head. Aroma is more balanced than previous years with a both roasted, chocolate notes along with some hop bitterness. The flavor profile is pretty balance with a sweet start that is rounded out with roast notes and dark chocolate. Lingering bitterness. Medium/heavy mouthfeel.
I would call the 10 the "balanced version" 1,893 characterskbutler1, Oct 27, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle #211. 2007 release. Necrosis black that crowds the sides and bowl of the glass so completely that light doesn't stand a chance in hell. Nothing is visible except... Darkness. The coffee colored cap looks as though it won't fade completely until sometime tomorrow, and there's a surprising amount of lace that can only be described as eye candy. I'm well aware that glassware shouldn't be taken into account when assigning an appearance score, but Darkness in a Darkness snifter is perfection.
Believe it or not, the hops can still be appreciated in the nose after almost a year. I guess that means they were added with a heavy hand back in '07. They're far from numero uno, though. As expected, ridiculously roasted malt is a rompin' and a stompin' all over the joint. Dark chocolate is at least twice as strong as black coffee. I've smelled better, but the nose is good. Damn good.
Believe the hype. My first impression is that Darkness tastes like no other RIS. I'm not sure I'll be able to explain why that is... but it is. My second impression is that a tremendous amount of green hop flavor and bitterness has survived. This stuff just might give Old Crustacean a run for its money when fresh.
Even though the malt backbone is massive, this beast isn't anywhere near as thick and syrupy as Dark Lord (which might make it more drinkable). Some of the bitterness could also be coming from barley that has been fire-roasted to within an inch of its life. The result is a flavor profile that includes chocolate liquor, blackstrap molasses and large splashes of Sambuca and espresso.
If Darkness was limited to those flavors, it would still be exceptional beer. The fact that candied citrus peel and resiny pine sap are added to the mix puts it over the top for this hophead. I can see how some might not like the emphasis on the little green cones, but then this is Surly... what the hell did you expect?
With each eager gulp, I am making Darkness prove every one of the final three scores. Believe me, it more than lives up to the challenge of a critical palate, especially since the flavors become even better integrated as the beer picks up a few degrees. The alcohol provides warmth (not heat) and plenty of power. This is massive beer for massive beer lovers.
My first inclination was to give the mouthfeel a less than perfect score. However, as the middle portion of the bottle approaches, it will not be denied. The melted ice cream-like viscosity that was almost there initially is now there in spades. Carbonation is on the generous side, but it's so soft and so well-buried that it adds just the right amount of energy and lift.
Darkness is a masterful creation from a masterful brewer. I allowed a few doubts to creep in prior to cracking the crown, but I doubt no more. In an amazingly short period of time, Surly has entered the upper echelon of craft breweries with such all-out masterpieces as Furious, Bender and CynicAle. Darkness is simply the shiny, juicy cherry on top. A huge thanks to feloniousmonk, the consummate BA, for the best extra in the history of extras.

Appearance: Pour Jet black with brown head into a plastic cup.
Smell: Dark chocolate and piney almost simecoe hops, hint of licorice.
Taste: Opens with rich dark malts that last till the very end. There is a piney/ licorice that comes into the flavor profile with hints of vanilla from the middle to the end leaving dark malty and barely hoppy aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth, with absolutely no cabonation
Drinkability: Would definitely have this again regardless of its popularity. I would recommend this to those who like a dark malt and roasted brew with subtle hints of black licorice and vanilla. 767 characterscapra12, Oct 26, 2009

Pours opaque with a shallow foamy dark brown head that fades slowly leaving stringy patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is timid. Some hints of dark chocolate, cherry and roasted malt. The taste has a nice complexity to it. A slight bitterness of dark chocolate and hops along with the roasted malt and a hint of cherry. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied and smooth with a tanginess from the alcohol. The texture coats some but is not super dense or oily. It cleans up quicker than i anticipated that it would. A really nice drinker, the 10.3% ABV is well integrated. 667 charactersjjayjaye, Oct 26, 2009

I don't remember exactly what I said, but here are my general thoughts. I had the '08 a few months ago and wasn't necessarily liking it a whole lot. Thought it had a lot going for it but in the end was just too sweet. The '09 is a completely different beast though. Big and very hoppy, with the sweetness merely adding complexity rather than dominating.

4.68/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 vintage bottle split three ways in tulip glasses. It was nice and viscous coming out of the bottle. A small tan head rose form each pour then settled to a thin lace but a simple swirl of the glass would bring it back. The body of the brew was a midnight black with light maroon highlights.
The first aroma I got was a slight oxidation which was to be expected with the age. Then I got some wonderful aromas of molasses, brown sugar and some slight dark fruits.
 The brew was towards the sweet side again I would expect it was from the age but it really made for an enjoyable sipping experience. Again I got the molasses, a hint of vanilla and dark fruits. I must say the roasted malts were showing up more as sweet chocolate than a roasted coffee note, Which added a bit uniqueness to the flavor. The brew was thick and viscous in your mouth with a slight carbonation for the tongue. Just the way I like a stout.
A great stout I would stand in line for it. The glass went down dam easy. I didn't get any hint of the alcohol seeing it was a 10%brew. I would gladly drink it again. big thanks to Packforever1976 for hooking me up 1,134 charactersjoepais, Oct 17, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Feeling a little down in the dumps tonight after watching the Phillies cough up game 2 to the Dodgers in the NLCS. What better way to put a smile back on my face then to pull out this gem which has been nestled away in the cellar since Darkness Day 2008.
First off, huges props to maximum12 for passing this my way, and passing it along as an extra. Bet on your good deed being returned; however, I will be swimming upstream for some time to repay the world famous, earth shaking, legendary trading maximum12.
Pours nearly black with little light being able to pierce this lovely mixture. Not a big head.
The smell and taste largely follow each other. Big presence of bitter chocolate, a bit of smoke, dark roasty toasty malts and a huge hit of sweet fruit. I seemed to pick up a nice cherry undertone on the fruit profile. Sweet but after reading some of the ratings, I was actually expecting it to be even sweeter. I think it is divine and the other Phillies fans drowning their sorrow with me all enjoyed it as well.
Very luxurious mouthfeel, slightly slick and oily. Very pleasant.
The drinkability is also very good, but I am not sure that you can do much more than sharing a bottle with friends. Sweet profile makes you enjoy your fill, but it is more of a treat rather than something that you can drink a lot of during one session.
All in all, a great experience and I look forward to hopefully trying this one again. It is really good and thanks to Corey once again for his generous inclusion. I'll get you back, you wait. 1,536 charactersBeerisheaven, Oct 17, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep dark blood red burgundy brown that almost black and completely opaque with a thick frothy 2.5 finger dark chocolate coffee colored head that has excellent retention, lasting throughout and leaving large chunks of soapy lacing.
Roasted malt aroma with sweet bitter dark chocolate and hints of molasses, honey, burnt toast, caramel, oatmeal, coffee bean, toffee, licorice and sweet alcohol. Possibly the best aroma I've experienced yet.
Thick chewy viscous mouthfeel with some slight carbonation and a huge roasty malt flavor. Soooo smooth with a full viscous mouthfeel. The ABV is so well masked that it's almost undetectable. Slightly dry finish with some slight alcohol warmth. Extremely quaffable with awesome raosted malt profile. Lots of sweet bitter dark chocolate, coffee bean, toffee, molasses, honey and caramel sweetness that balances out the deep roasty and burnt toast characteristics. Very subtle hops in the finish as well as some slight alcohol warmth. 
This is one of the most complex, flavorful and drinkable Imperial Stouts I've ever had and possibly one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of sampling. All I can say is WOW. Highly recommended. 1,187 characterscorby112, Oct 14, 2009

Pours an opaque pitch black color with a one finger dark brown head. Retention of the head is much better around the outsides, as it shrinks in the middle but stays clinging to the glass. Nice lacing also.
The nose is dark coffee, roasted malts, bitter hops, toffee caramel and vanilla, bitter chocolate, dark dried fruits...and so much more. Extremely complex and it's a treat to drink this in.
The taste is just as good as the nose leads on. Dark roasted malts, sweet and bitter chocolate, bitter earthy hops, dried dark fruits, sweet caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee...the combinations of flavors seem endless and they just keep coming. I'm not kidding when I say I get a different taste with every sip.
Mouthfeel is thick, rich and creamy. Has an appropriate carbonation level. Had a significant bitter aftertaste.
Drinkability is amazing. This is a great brew and one I can't wait to have again. I can't wait for Darkness Day to purchase my limit in bottles. I would love to see how this is a couple years down the road, maybe even one day do a vertical. Surly does it again, but was there ever any doubt? 1,255 charactersMistofminn, Oct 07, 2009

Very nice sweet taste, milk chocolate and caramel. Slighty bitter and dry with some noticable hops. Lingering alcohol in the aftertaste in the form of mild bourbon.

A: Pitch black, not a hint of light shines through. Huge two fingers of mocha head appear, retains nicely, and leaves great spotty lace.
A: Super sweet. Big molasses, raisin, fig, bittersweet chocolate, and cherry. Great chocolaty and roasty malt flavor is put in balance by the earthy hops.
T: Magnificantly complex. The molasses, dried fruit, chocolate, and cherry are great. But I am really diggin the sweetness of the malt. The earthiness gives it a balance that is supurb. The perfect amount of hops give it a smooth dry finish.
M: Super viscous, velvety smooth. I can't say anything more. Just perfect.
D and overall impression: Drinkability is great. This one is about a year old, and the flavors have melded perfectly. Would really like to compare this to a fresh bottle, but couldn't wait to pop it open. Just a great example of the style. Skal. 991 charactersGtreid, Sep 26, 2009

A- Imagine the contents of an oil drum being poured into your glass. Dark as night, absolutely no visibility. Produced two fingers width of cocoa colored head. Reduced to a ring. Minimal lacing left on the glass.
S- It's there, just not distinct enough...too neutral and restrained, especially for a beast like this. Getting some sweetness from chocolate malts with an underlying scent of oats. A bit of alcohol is also detectable.
T- Took a while to get used to, but once I let it warm up to room temperature, this beer was spot on. Upfront there was a nice amount of bitter chocolates. From there a rich chocolate flavor comes forth with an undeniable sweetness that builds and lasts to the very end. Did notice a hint of charred character as well.
M- This is what I'm talking about. Absolutely perfect. This beer has what I call the double V's...viscosity and velvety smoothness (yea, I just made that up). Slick and oily. I really can't complain here.
D- The sweetness brings it down a little bit, but by no means was it overwhelming. Did not notice the alcohol whatsoever.
Overall, really happy with this one. Definitely didn't disappoint. The mouthfeel was spot on and the taste was close behind. Highly recommended. 1,409 charactersrhinos00, Sep 23, 2009

A - Black, thick, and oily. Fairly small tan head.
S - Roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate, with a hint of dark fruits.
T - Really excellent: roasted malts, coffee, cherries, raisins, other dark fruits, molasses, and chocolate. Complexity is high. Pretty sweet overall so it may not be for everyone, but it is most definitely for me.
M - Sweet and syrupy with low carbonation, which some people think is a bad thing, but I like this in extreme RISes.
D - Well, the consistency is similar to oil, but the fact that it's so tasty increases the drinkability quite a bit. 688 charactersnickd717, Sep 10, 2009

I think I had this one built up in my head to be something more than it was. It was still a great brew to try.

Split several ways with some friends at FFF's. 
Poured a enough to make a nice review, but not pass out.
A - Jet black, coffee/cream colored head, sticky lacing along the side of the snifter. Pretty much similar to all other top-notch examples of this style.
S - Sweet chocolate, molasses, raisins. Smells so good I would like to eat this beer instead of drink. One whiff and I'm ready to dig in to my dessert! Nothing overly complex, but damn good nonetheless. 
T - Chocolate cake with chocolate cream filling topped with chocolate sprinkles and chocolate syrup. In other words, lots of chocolate here! No real alcohol burn present and when compared to Dark Lord, almost zero (I realize DL is 13% though). Very sweet, no real hops/bitterness at all. It's like drinking chocolate syrup (in a good way).
M - A little more thin then what I was expecting but oh-so smooth. It just covers your mouth in sweet goodness! 
D - Very easy to drink for the style. I will revisit in another six months or so to see how it's coming along. All in all, a great RIS, worthy of the rating and hype. 1,141 charactersSean9689, Aug 05, 2009

Pours a very dark brown, nearly black in color. Very nice mocha colored head and frothiness around the edges.
Smell is slight hops, and some mediciny alcohol as well. Taste is very smooth and full. The taste is much better than the smell. More of the piney hops in the flavor. I was expecting a more full mouthfeel. 
This is the creamiest, smoothest mouthfeel that I have encompassed. Very interested to see what some more time will do to this. Glad I got the chance to try it. Interested to see where this goes. 540 charactersFtownThrowDown, Aug 02, 2009

A-Bold dense blackness. Dark tan head. Lots of lacing.
S-Chocolate sweetness, dark scotch-like malts, caramel, toffee. Absolutely delicious on the senses.
T-1st sip...speechless. So smooth, so sweet, so perfect. Dark chocolate and toffee, scotch-like malt with very light coffee notes. Wonderfully full body. The balance for this high octane, big stout is unparalleled. The alcohal is definitely present because it warms going down, but it is not overpowering. Some late hops make an appearance but it just continues to balance and compliment the brew. I've simply never had a better beer.

it looks like there's a frappacino on my beer. There are seriously four fingers of thick, soapy light chocolate brown head. It had a jet black body, no light getting through on the first pour. Sheets that stick for days on the glass. This looks nothing short of fantastic. Deep dark chocolate aromas hit like a freight train and little notes of grapefruit and cherry join in. Tons of hoppy character: citrus and pine are obvious. A hint of alcohol is there, but not much. Essentially, this smells like a double imperial ipa stout.A strong malt backbone of chocolate goodness supports a ton of fruity citrus bitter. Alcohol is not obvious in the least. Notes of cherry and plum. There are no words for this mouthfeel. Well, that's a lie, there are: its like a mouth full of cream. Light, fluffy; but yet thick and velvety. Carbonated to a d. Its wonderful just to keep in your mouth. it would be guttonous to drink a gallon of this. But if I could get a gallon of this, I would drink a gallon of this. Still, it has
tons of flavor and the ABV will get to you.
This beer is just full of soul. No demonic connotation implied, but this thing has character. If you can get your hands on it, do so. 1,208 charactersschroederm, Jul 18, 2009

Aroma of sweet malt and some bitter hops as well. Rather indistinct aroma actually. Flavor is very sweet and malty, but not the roasted malt that I'm used to in imperial stouts.

I would like to try this again though. 432 charactersLilBeerDoctor, Jul 11, 2009

A: Poured into a Surly snifter. Looks seriously black and thick straight from the bottle. It is black. Did I mention how black it is? The truly noteworthy thing about it's appearance, however, its the mile high head and shimmery lace. 
S: Immediately I smelled the hops. Slightly citrus, grassy hops, followed by some serious sweetness. There was certainly some chocolate syrup smells at points, and hints of caramel too.
T: The notes in the taste were harder to pinpoint. Sweetness was the dominating flavor, and milk chocolate was present at well. Bitterness was subdued largely by the sweetness, but there were notes of burnt toffee and a slight nuttiness, dates perhaps as well. 
M: Rich and velvety. Certainly thick, and perhaps a tough cloying. Spot on for the style. 
D: How drinkable can an RIS ever be? It is a huge beer. You'd be foolish to go for more than a few glasses, if not for the alcohol, then certainly for the sweetness. But this is certainly drinkable for the style. 
Overall, great great beer. I wish some of the subtle flavors had been a little more prominent, but overall it packs a punch both in flavor and ABV. 1,312 characterszjungleist, Jun 22, 2009
3.93/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4taken from notes. served 2 9oz pours at two brothers "for the love of hops." plastic cups both times. moderately priced at 6$ each.
A- this one pours a viscous black colored body with a very small coffee colored head which lasts only a second. it might be the plastic cups, but none of the beers served that day left any decent lacing to speak of. this one was no exception. 
S- dark roasted malts and a lot of sweetness. sweeter than most stouts. reminds me of raisins and plums. some coffee/hops at the end. milk chocolate throughout. 
T- the taste was as sweet as the smell. kind of off putting to be honest. lots of chocolate and raisins. more hops at the end than the average stout. that was kind of cool.
M- thick and full bodied. chewy and palate coating. a nice low level of carbonation really works in this one's favor. 
D- easy enough to drink but i dont think i could have had more than two without wanting to switch to something else. nice to see this one on tap again in this area. it had been a while. not the greatest stout of the fest, but nothing to pass on either 1,086 charactersjwinship83, Jun 18, 2009

Looks black with a deep tan head. Some lacing present. Beer is opaque, looks an amber brown color barely around the edges.
Tastes of chocolate, coffee and toffee, with earthy hops and dark fruits in the background.
Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Low carbonation, and full bodied.

Been cellaring it for a while, but tonight is the night, for feeling alright, we'll be making love the whole night through. 2008 Vintage. Please read the following review with Vincent Price's voice in your head. 
Darkness falls into the glass, a blood letting ooze coats the side of the glass and your vision like the very dense breath of Satan himself. Thick, deep, dark, black, likes the eyes of the souless worms that feast on your flesh.
The foulest stench from the darkest depths of hades invade your brain. Chocolates, coffee, roasted breadiness with earthy hoppiness and fruits dried by the foul breath from the hounds of hell. 
With every thickening taste a demonic possesion overcomes your body and soul. A ghastly haunting of malted chocolates, dried dark fruits, milky, with hops creeping up on you all the more like the bleak december, wroughting ghosts on the floor....
This beer fills me with fantastic terrors I never knew before. I hope it raps and taps on my chamber door, forever more... 1,059 charactersMurchmac, Jun 14, 2009

Pours a thick syrupy dark brown/black with 2 fingers of thick mocha tan head into a large snifter. Great retention and lacing. Smells of citrus hops, dark fruits, chocolate, anise, roasted malt, and leather. Tastes of pineapple, chocolate, and dark fruits like plums, figs, and raisins, cocoa powder, caramel, vanilla, roasted malt, leather, and anise with a hint of coffee and herbal in the finish. Full body with low carbonation. Thick and syrupy, sweet with lots of dark fruit and chocolate flavors. Smooth and creamy with a nice bitterness but not too potent. Pretty unique even amongst the other big Russian Imperial Stouts. Very drinkable and a great sipping treat. 706 charactersHopDerek, May 28, 2009

A- pours dark as motor oil black. Head formation is about 1 cm in size and well retained. Mocha in color. 
S- dominated by a bittersweet chocolate and just a hair of noble hops. Very light on the roasted smoked or coffee scents
T- starts off reletively light with only a light malt hit. Builds with some bitter background and only a hint of hops. wow that finishes sweet, with a load of caramel, toffee and vanilla flavors. I really taste the hops in the aftertaste. 
M- extremely thick and creamy. Very sticky and clingng. A feel of molasses. 
D- I could only have one of these at a time. Very potent and a flavor profile so intense that having another would be wasted.
Truly a RIS. Up there with dl or speedway stout. 743 characterskatan, May 28, 2009

A - Gorgeous black with a healthy tan head. Bottle is fantastic with the double dip wax and devil holding the skull upside down (don't know which year)
S - Chocolate, coffee, and leather. Faint touch of smoke. 
T - Truly fantastic. This was the BEST Russian Imp Stout I have head. Coffee, Chocolate, Tobacco, and Roasted notes. This just got more complex as it lingers warmer and warmer. Hops present yet compliments the flavors.
M - Not as thick as the Dark Lord, but much more of a flavor blast. Really a gem. Lingers worth the different notes.
O - Simply amazing. The most balanced and complete beer I have had. Thanks to Gregc for opening this. It was fantastic. 735 characterssoccerman7, May 23, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 475cl bottle shared by illidurit. Pitch black with a thick, dense tan head. The aroma is a burst of tropical pineapple hoppiness. There is some underlying chocolate malt as well, but the pineapple runs the show. The flavor has some bittersweet chocolate countered by tons of fruity mango and pineapple, finishing dry and hopy, but with a very smooth and restrained bitterness. Full and decadently smooth texture, but not overly thick or sticky. This is just an amazing stout. Awesome chocolate covered tropical fruit synergy. 524 charactersbulletrain76, May 11, 2009

Thick tan head and a smidge of sticky lacing. Obviously very dark brown.
Aroma is more hoppy then the other RIS.. Sweet as well.
I enjoyed the balance of this beer. Very sweet, but also very hop heavy. Quite a bit of fruit. More of a candy sweet vs. a coffee. Like a dark chocolate. Molasses and dark caramel.
Very thick and almost totally sticky. Fully bodied.
One to savor and enjoy slowly. You couldn't kill a bottle of this if you tried. 660 charactersReagan1984, May 03, 2009

A: Very dark with a dark head to go along with it.
S: Roasted malt and the sweetness of dried fruits. Some molasses and brown sugar to go with dried cherries mixed with some espresso.
T: Similar to the nose, with more of the espresso/dark cherry tarnish.
M: Some alcohol, but a good, warming amount. Very full bodied.
D: Excellent beer, though not quite as drinkable as Dark Lord. Very, very deserving of its high place of honor. I cannot wait for this summer to get out to Minnesota and sample all the Surly I can find. 602 charactersThorpe429, Apr 29, 2009

Pours a sickly thick black impenetrable darkness with a large and in charge tan ice cream head that lingers forever and leaves great lacing.
Nose is chock full o roasted malt. Some chocolate makes its presence known along with some hops. Smells like this is going to be quite roasty and bitter. I don't smell the same hop power i got out of the 2007 batch, but its still there.
Wow. A fantastic imperial stout once again. Roasted malt is defenitely the dominant presence out of the gate. Wow. Roasted malt continues as some chocolate flavors begin to emerge. Both continue as some very dark sweet flavors begin to rise toward the finish. Some good crisp hoppiness mixes right in without being too strong or rivaling the roasted malt action. The finish has a nice crisp bitter lick, but also keeps the sweet thick chocolatey flavor going, along with the constant roasted malt, both of which linger on in the aftertaste.
The mouthfeel is not for the faint of heart. Im pretty sure i can feel my arteries clogging right now. This bitch is nearly milkshake status. which is...awesome. the carbonation is where it should be.
Drinkability is pretty damn good considering the nature of this beast and the abv. Nothing amazing in this category, but certainly above average.
Overall an amazing imperial stout from Surly. Im not sure which batch I like better, but they both are killer beers. If you like big thick monsterous viscous collosal ultra galactic beast stouts, this will be right up your alley. Thanks again to Aaron for hookin a brotha up with this oft desired brew. 1,656 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Apr 28, 2009

Red Waxed Cap/Gold Wax
2008 Vintage
Poured into a chalice a deep black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, which leaves some nice oil slicks and some sticky lacing behind. The nose is sweet, malty, lots of chocolate/toffee, some roastyness, vanilla. The taste is pretty sweet, malty, very nice touch of chocolate/toffe, with some slight roasty note. Medium body, the ABV is hidden pretty well with this one. Very drinkable, this is an awesome brew, glad to finally get a chance to try it. 559 charactersWasatch, Apr 21, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 vintage, courtesy of DbHog (an awesome trader). Beer #5 in the "Motha of all Stout Tastings." Pours two shades shy of black with rubye highlights around the edges. Half inch mocha-colored cap embedded with ringlets - generous head recedes into a swirl. Glass was coated with delicate strands of lacing during the tasting. Nose is hoppy - enough said. Taste is really interesting and was difficult to tease out - a full malt bill mixed with citric acid, artificial sweetener, grapefruit and some booze towards the back. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slightly viscous. A complex and interesting beer, but a bit off-style in my opinion. 639 charactersJwale73, Apr 19, 2009

Between the style and the name of the beer, you obviously knew it would be dark, but man, this thing is black as black gets with a pleasant brown cap. The aroma is unique. Sweet and dark with more than a tad of fruitiness.
The taste follows suit. It's sweeter than I expected, but it works. Mouthfeel is great: smooth and goes down easy.
Delicious beer and it's not hard for one to become two. The sweetness holds me back a bit, but still a damn good beer. 512 charactersLarrytown, Apr 17, 2009

Many enjoyable hours sharing beers on Darkness Day with many wonderful people waiting the opportunity to buy this beer.
I've broken into my very limited supply twice, once to do a combined tasting, put on with BRDC, for a sampling group done in a bookstore with a fireplace, (thanks Jeff and Kim). We had a collection to be envied, Darkness, Dark Lord, Abyss, Expedition, Stone Imperial, Alesmith Speedway, Peche Mortel, Founders Breakfast, Ten Fidy and others. Darkness and Dark Lord were the consensus favorites. I was somewhat surprised, as Expedition and Stone are my favorites, but I liked the Darkness and Dark Lord even better.
Today I am sitting alone, savoring an entire bottle of Darkness as I type, (decadent and selfish, I know; I beg your forgiveness).
This beer is something special, even in the company of special beers. When we had the sampling, I was standing next to another home brewer, and the two of us were intrigued by the malt profile. It is unique and different from any other Imperial I've tried. My guess is higher Lovibond crystal malts and other rich malts were used, (?Special B), rather than depending on only the traditional roasted malts.
This beer was brewed by an artist and a master, no surprise as its from Surly. Just so you know my judgements, I think Furious is the best IPA, and I've had and love Masala and Sculpin.
On to reviewing:
Sampled in my favorite tulip. I have Darkness 2008. The label depicts a pagan diety or demon, (depending on your perceptions), presumably enjoying Darkness drunk from the skull of an enemy.
Appearance - rich, dark, opaque brown. The head is a rich deep creamy tan with small bubbles, large and persistent with a vigorous pour. Lacing is lovely.
Aroma and nose - enticing, rich, dark chocolate, roasted caramel malts. The hops are both obvious and subtle, enticing you to decide what they are, or just to shut up and enjoy.
Taste - follows the nose - rich, cholatey, (is that a word?), caramel. Enchanting, enjoyable, enticing, exquisite, exceptional.
Mouthfeel - rich, (a word that recurs in this review and when you enjoy this ale), creamy, marvelous carbonation - small bubbles like a bottle or cask conditioned ale, (although I saw no yeast in the bottom of the bottle).
Drinkability - a concept I've always found odd. It is wonderfully drinkable for its style. Warming, inviting on this cold, dreary, snowing day, (yeah I know, its April - I live in Wisconsin).
Its big drawback, like Dark Lord's is that you can buy it once a year in one place only, in limited quantities. Expedition and Stone Imperial should get additional points because they too are works of art, much more readily available and reasonably priced.
Having said that, I treasure the opportunity to try Darkness. If you should get the chance, judge it on its own merits, and savor the moment. Skol. 2,877 charactersStoutsnIPAs, Apr 05, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thank You Jeff!!!! The epitome of what a BA should be, you keep raising the bar.
Served in a Darkness snifter, also included in the trade.
The beers name describes the color perfectly. It just doesn't get any more dark. Huge thick mocha milkshake head, both in texture and color. Head will outlast the beer. I'm sure I'll be washing the sticky lacing off of the glass when the Heels' game is over.
Wonderful aroma. Rich roasted charred smell is what stands out first. On further review I get rich over-ripe dark fruits, and a unique rum aroma.
I've never tasted any other RIS like it. Rich dark roasted malts give a coffee flavor. Fresh ripe dark fruits. Blackberries. Huge hoppiness for the style. A bit of alcohol warmth. Flavor coats the mouth and last forever.
The mouthfeel is thinner than other big RISs, but imo that's a good thing. It's still thick, syrupy and smooth.
Great beer. I'm priviledged and grateful that I had the chance to try it. 950 characterswcudwight, Mar 28, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a Maudite Snifter yeilded an extremely dark liquid that has a beautiful head that was stubborn and stuck around for a while.
Lots of hops. Next to Smuttynose Imperial stout this is probably the most hoppy RIS I have ever had. Pine and grapefruit dominate the hop character with Chocolate and a hint of coffee dominating the Malt aspect, with some cherries in the mix as well.
Chocolate, dark berries, prune and coffee. A very hoppy beer with some bitterness coming from both the hops and the roasted character. Alcohol is hidden very well but still contributes a warming character. 
Next to Darklord this is the most viscous mouthfeel I have ever experienced.
A fantastic RIS that I will seek out again in the future. I would be curious to see how age mellows the hops and changes this brew. 803 charactersalovesupreme, Mar 26, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Silky black appearance, semi-viscous. Nice 1/2 inch deep tan foam, holds a minute leaving some decent lace. Smell is quite hoppy, with mix of roasted malt. Almost reminiscent of Stone 11th. 
The first sip feels very smooth, with a subtle chewiness. The grassy hops are strong in the flavor also, with the bitterness creeping in slowly. This is not much of a typical RIS, as the burnt roast is downplayed by the heavy hand of IPA-like hops. The malt tastes quite sweet and chocolatey. With hops being the focus, perhaps I should have drank this thing fresher? 
This beer did not live up to the hype. There is something missing in the balance here. I don't mind a really hoppy stout, but the overt sweetness was too much. There needs to be more of a dry roasted character, and beyond that some more complexity. Again, this was alot like the Stone 11th Anniversary, althogh I would say that was balanced more perfectly than this. Worth a try, but otherwise overrated... 968 charactersbennetj17, Mar 24, 2009

Appearance is well, I don't think it can get much better. Blacker than coffee, nice head and a bit of lacing. Smell and Taste are pretty similar. Lots of dark fruit, fig is most prominent, but side notes of cherries, raisins and plums. Taste is a bit more pronounced and a bit of the hops come through on the back end. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy- like drinking a cappucino. Drinkability is really good for the style. 527 characterssupercolter, Mar 19, 2009

2008 with a bitchin' label... pours just lighter than black with a light tan head which lingers and leaves an abundance of spotty lacing. pine-like hops hit the nose first but soon turn to sinus numbing citrus peel... secondary scents of chocolate, malt powder, nutty/coffee, grass and leafy green hops.
the palate is quite sweet... almost to cloying but the power of the hops make it a bit easier to enjoy. the flavor shares the characters of the aroma but also has some woodiness and a distinct savory note. there is a long lingering aftertaste of malted chocolate malted milk with pine needles in it. medium to medium/full bodied with a creamy almost oily mouth feel. pine-like and leafy hops keep it really easy to drink and bring it back from the brink of sticky...8/4/7/4/17/4.0 893 charactershellbilly, Mar 14, 2009

Pours black with a fucking sexy three finger head off a very aggressive pour. lacing is some of the best i have seen. period. they called it the darkness for a reason. light couldn't get through this if it was held at gun point. 
smell is complex. surprisingly hoppy. slight sweetness. this smells completely unique. like no ris that i have ever had.

4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to NOBama for this one! 2008 vintage, the coolest looking bottle I have seen that wasn't Gratitude. 
Pour is just perfect, black and thick as used motor oil with a thick tan head. Not a highlight in sight. 
Scent is of strong sweet molasses over chocolate and an earthy aroma. Dark fruit is present as well. 
Taste is incredibly sweet. Lactose, molasses, bitter chocolate. It's like nestle quick that wasn't stirred enough, and that's a good thing. This reminds me more of a milk stout than your typical ris. 
Mouth is full and creamy, as thick as it looks. Low carbonation. Just perfect. 
I know I may never have this again, but damn I hope I do. Well worthy of it's status and hype. Amazing beer. If this is the crappy vintage, I don't think I could handle a good one

Appearance: Motor oil black, decent head and lacing.
Smell: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruits - particularly prune juice, grape juice, and plum, dark rum, espresso, molasses, licorice, vanilla, and hops.
Taste: Slightly too sweet, lots of roasted malt of course, prune, grape, and plum juice, espresso, molasses, dark chocolate, dark rum, licorice, vanilla, tobacco juice, and hops.
Mouthfeel: It is a big beer, but not the thick oily syrup that is Dark Lord. Very well carbonated.

4.79/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I got this bottle in a trade with incutrav. Thanks Travis!
This pours from the 750ML waxed bottle, close to room temp, as dark as dark can be. Pitch black and no highlights of any kind when I held the glass up to a light. I poured it rather vigorously and am rewarded with about a one finger head of tan foam. Head retention was good and there was some lacing.
The smell has all sorts of things going on. Lots of sweetness on the nose with big caramel, big notes of sherry and roasted malt, and lots of chocolate with some vanilla, maybe a touch of some dark fruits like raisin and plum. This is a great "smeller"; one of the best I've encountered to date.
The taste...can it live up to what I just experienced with the smell? We shall see.
First sip and I'll be...danged. No dryness here at all. Lots of caramel malt sweetness starts the session off followed by lots of milk chocolate, a touch of dark chocolate that adds just the right amount of bitterness, and big sherry notes along with that roasted malt goodness. The vanilla shows up mostly near the finish as does the dark fruitiness which gives me a light bit of tartness that's a plus for this RIS...man, this is one hell of a complex brew bordering on the over the top in complexity but there is nothing in the flavour that I can say detracts or is overused. It's just outstanding, plain and simple, and the abv is *very* well hidden.
It definitely has a fullish mouthfeel and the carbonation is lightly but rightly done. Silky smooth.
Drinkability? 1 at a sitting would be all that I can handle but that *1* is turning out to be a disappearing act that most magicians would drool over. I kid you not!
Big thanks again to Travis for giving me the chance to try my first Surly in a bottle. What a treat! 1,769 charactersBitterbill, Mar 01, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to stoutsnipas, his brother, and myself for this one.
Notes come from both a blind tasting and a later personal tasting.
Poured into a snifter, the pitch black brew, thick but not truly "motor oil" produces by some reverse cascade a frothy, nice looking cocoa colored head that lasts reasonably well for the ABV, and creates sticky lacing on its way down. 
The rich aroma has predominant cocoa notes, but also roasted malt and smoky notes, coffee, some acidity, butterscotch, molasses, licorice, mint.
Creamy as it gets, and amazingly drinkable, with little alcohol to be noticed other than the chocolate liquor notes. Some butterscotch, caramel, mint, licorice, herbal hops, but still predominantly sweet despite some hop and roasted grain bites. 
Goes down incredibly easy, and I have to say it was well worthwhile standing in that freezing line. Believe the hype. 874 charactersbrdc, Mar 01, 2009
4.14/5  rDev -6.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Black black black with a medium brown head that is small and only stays as a little fuzz. Laces medium well. Smells like mangos, chocolate syrup, and molasses. Bright, complex, and fun. Silky smooth body, sweet, stale coffee, and cocoa. A little heavy and sweet on the tongue, and the flavors fail to challenge me or stand out from others of this style. Overall this is an enjoyable beer, but it lacks that special something that makes it stand out from the rest. It's smoothness is pleasant, but is not what I look for in an imperial stout. 541 characterswaughbrew, Mar 01, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I tried this on tap at Winterfest 2008, in a 4 ounce snifter.
Pours black as night with little carbonation and 1/2 a finger of head. The beer smells amazing and complex, with notes of roasted grain, coffee, chocolate, pine and hops.
I always find it hard to describe the taste of a good RIS, as there is so much character in them. Both sweet and bitter chocolates hit my palate along with subtle smoke flavors, dark grains, molasses, and a bit of hops and alcohol to finish it off. 
Darkness seems to coat your mouth and throat with on the way down, and the mouthfeel is viscous and smooth. It would certainly be hard to polish off a lot of darkness in one short sitting, but when put into perspective of ones expectations for imperial stouts, this is an easy drinker. I only wish that I could have taken a little more time to enjoy darkness, but alas there were many fine beverages to sample at winterfest. 910 charactersuser0317, Feb 27, 2009
3.29/5  rDev -25.6%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3400th review! 2008 Edition. Poured from a 750ml wax dipped bottle into a pint glass. Cool label. and wax job. Was pitch black in color even against a light. Amazing lacing. It had a large brown head that ever so slowly settled into a constant thick foam.
The aroma was surprisingly sweet. It wasn't the dark fruit sweet that you find (and I don't like) in most RIS's. Rather it was more like an amped up milk stout. Also heavy on liquid dark chocolate aroma. Some hops hidden way in the back but overwhelmed by the sweetness. So glad it wasn't dark fruit aroma but the aroma could have used some more hops to offset the sweetness. The taste was very similar to the taste. Completely unexpected to be so sweet. Almost cloying at first and then completely cloying by middle. Slight bitter at the end but not nearly enough to offset it. Alcohol is felt by warm stomach but completely hidden in the taste. That is an area where most (I'm looking at you Dark Lord) RIS's fail. They are too dominated by alcohol where this one hides it perfectly. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Good carbonation. Too sweet of an aftertaste.
Overall, a disappointment especially when factoring what I traded to get it. For me, it was WAY too sweet. Even after it really warmed up, it was still off the chart. It's only 4 months old so can't be over-aged and can't imagine further aging would cut the sweetness any more. No real hop presence as-is and that would fade over time. Really disappointed in this one. Love all the Surly's that I've had but this one is a miss for me. Still can't get over that it's because of being too sweet - like sugar water. If you'd said too raisiny or too much alcohol I'd have believed that but not this. May try another batch in the future but probably one and done for me unless a unique circumstance applies. 1,822 charactersTexIndy, Feb 17, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours at EBF into a plastic sampling glass after a long wait in line. Hopefully it's worth the effort. Color is a beautiful thick dark, black. Wonderful thick, frothy, milkshake-like head.
The aroma starts with a piney hoppiness, followed by an all spice note, then leads into dark chocolate, come bitter cocoa, coffee and a strong roasted basement brings it all together. A warm alcohol presence heightens the flavor and invites more drinking.
The taste has a front palate of sweet malty chocolate cake, then moves to solid finish of hops and peppery spice from the alcohol.
The body is rather light for the depth and strength of the beer, and with a nice carbonation that creates a continuous agitation of flavors this has an overall soft and inviting feel. Well balanced and pleasing. The alcohol warmth slows down the drinking a bit but the flavors are so nice and the body so soft that this is definitely a keeper...if i could ever get another glass. 955 charactersNoLiberty, Feb 08, 2009
4.16/5  rDev -5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I love this beer. Talking about the 2008 edition. This is a simple review from a simple man.
The appearance is jet black as night inky tar pit. Wow.
Smell is nice but and mellow.
Taste is just divine, I give it a 4 because I feel the sweetness comes a little strong.
The mouthfeel is smooth thick goodness. A heavy beer to say the least.
Drinkability is a 4 instead of 5 because in my mind it is not intended as an all-nighter. This is a finishing beer. Like a fine port. The strong willed can put down a bottle and will feel the part. But for me it is a wonderful strong ale that is complex in all aspects. 607 characterspoopypine, Feb 05, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this at a stout event courtesy of brdc and company, much thanks to them.
Poured from a bottle into a flute. It pours a very thick deep brown that is opaque when held to the light, except at the edges. A 1-2 inch mocha colored head forms and is short-lived with minimal lacing.
The aroma is assertive and complex with sweet components of caramel and molasses and something that seemed to me like cotton candy/corn syrup. The usual chocolate culprit is also present as is a later coffee note. Very unique and very good.
The taste also highlighted a sweet caramel taste which includes molasses and chocolate. The bitter coffee and hoppy components were not as intense to me but still present and a nice balance.
The mouthfeel seem to have a medium carbonation and significant thickness that was quite smooth. There was a sticky finish that lingered with some of the bitter tastes.
Overall, this is an extremely drinkable beer and one of my favorites from the night. I will continue my search for me and hope to make it to the Darkness event next time. This was at the top with Dark Lord at our event. 1,106 charactersSykDoc, Feb 03, 2009
4.11/5  rDev -7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4There are few years that get as much hype. Pours a midnight black color with some decent viscosity. Very dark with a chestnut brown colored head. Good retention and lacing through the whole tasting.
Nose to the floor, the aroma has a mostly sweetness to it. The malt comes out with some stronger coffee and roast aromas. Some stronger astringency notes that gives a harshness to it. Some coffee and lactic/milky notes as well. The lactic may be a bit much and giving that sweeter aroma. Some lighter honey notes with a mild spiciness. The yeasty notes are noticeable as well. Some prunes and cherries really come out but mix with a odd hoppy earthiness to it. Some fusel notes as well.
The taste is similar. Very sweet upfront if not more so than the nose. This hides some of the nice astringent roast flavors that come out. Though as it warms, the roast does come out. The coffee aspect backs off but there as the lactic/milky side comes out. Almost like a oatmeal thing but too sweet. Some bitter dark chocolate notes that balance nicely. The hops are really noticeable and lend more of an earthy and citrus mix. Really distracts from the beer. Would have liked more bitters to help with the sweetness. Noticeable yeasty notes and alcohol, but not necessarily fusels. Nice sherry and cherry/fig notes as well. Some peppery notes. A little bit of butyric on the backend as well. Overall good but super sweet.
The body is a bonus. Very thick and chewy. A lot of depth overall with a creamy texture. So do you buy the hype? Not really. The sweetness is a huge distraction and the finishing hops are too strong. But one thing I will give this beer though, it will age nicely. See you in a few years. 1,700 charactersOxymoron, Jan 31, 2009
4.73/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 Three months old - Pours a beautiful pitch black that is completely opaque. A heavy two inch dark tan/caramel head proudly crowns this masterpiece. The large head very slowly and reluctantly recedes. Smells of chocolate, coffee, licorice, alcohol and hops complete the nose. Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee grinds, raisins, tobacco and "licorice...yeah black licorice" add to the amazing complexity. One of many amazing aspects of this beer is the mouthfeel which I can only describe as complete milkshake. An intense hop presence separates this puppy from the other top RIS's in the world. It does not get any better than this. Big, bold, beautiful...if this beer doesn't make your pecker hard, you are likely gay and need to go back to wine. 749 charactersATLbeerDog, Jan 25, 2009

Nose of soy sauce, and all of the hops that I have been told that are in this beer. The flavor is different to say the least. It starts of with some maple, then slips into a big date or fig finish. I get all the hops in the finish as well. Full body but it seems to be easily drinkable. Gosh...believe the hype. 359 characterstjthresh, Jan 23, 2009
4.16/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Darkness, bottle courtesy of a ratebeer trade, and split at my 1-year Anniversary Tasting with a few friends. My portion poured into a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a thick, pitch-black, dark beer, oily, heavy, glug glug glug into the glass. The head is light cocoa, tan, with great retention - it's swiss cheese like, bubbly, sticky, foamy in places, meringue-like in others. The lacing is three-dimensional in places, sticky, strewn all over the sides of the tulip. Just a great looking beer.
Aroma: Huge, pungent cocoa and soy, with plenty of hops, too - citrusy, lightly grassy, which would be overpowering in any brew other than this one. Hints of coconut, too. There are lots of sweet, nondescript malty notes, though plenty of solid roasted, toasted notes as well. This beer's least enjoyable aspect - it's not doing a lot for me.
Taste: Oh wow. What a fantastic taste. Tons of residual sweetness with every roasted and toasted malty note imaginable - butterscotch, caramel, toffee on the light end, coffee, cocoa, toast, molasses, deep brown sugar on the darker end - and only a kiss of soy sauce. A few dark fruits notes, raisin being most prominent, round out the malty sweetness. Anise is prominent as well and melds well with a somehow prominent amount of hop bitterness and citrusy, leafy hop notes, orange-zest like in places, slightly minty in others. It's very complex and well-rounded, and only loses the half-point due to the overwhelming amount of residual sugars - it's just slightly too sweet.
Mouthfeel: Thick and somewhat even, though there is a fair amount of unevenness here. What is here is creamy and milky, however, a good fit for the tasting notes here. It leaves a bit of a syrupy, sticky feel in the mouth too. However, this one improves drastically as it warms, evenening out as the carbonation dies. Creamy and mellow.
Drinkability: This is a good beer ... it's just not quite as good as I thought it would be, and though I try not to take off points for expectations, I may have in a few spots here. There's plenty of good here - it's big, it's bold, it's complex, it's pleasantly well-hopped, and the alcohol's well-hidden. On the other hand, the alcohol's pretty high, the aroma is a little lackluster, and it's pretty crazy sweet. The verdict: it's a winner. Is it worth $16? Probably. Would I try it again? Yes. If you get the chance to trade for it, should you? Definitely. 2,412 charactersCrellMoset, Jan 19, 2009

3.01/5  rDev -31.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Dark and beautiful with a creamy tan head and very solid retention. Sticky chunks of lacing down the glass. Smell is interesting. Creamy dark chocolate with a touch of roast, along with an evident hop presence underneath. It brings forth a spicy scent. Pretty rich of molasses. Taste is just over-the-top sweet for my liking. Again, big time molasses and in an overwhelming fashion. Some dark fruits as well. A slight hint of roast and definite hops again attempt to find balance but just help to forget about the sweet for a second. In the mouth it's creamy and smooth, not too bad by any means. Sadly, this is not one that I enjoyed so much. I'm just glad it wasn't wasted, as I shared it with a couple people. Maybe after a year or more, this one would lose some of its sweetness and find a bit more balance. Cheers to Bill for sending yet another Surly brew my way! 869 charactersncvbc, Jan 17, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml wax topped bottle into an oversized Duvel tulip glass. Thanks go to bulldogp04 for the trade. I had previously had samples of the '07 batch both from the bottle and keg (@ EBF '08) and was anxiously waiting to see what this latest batch brings to the table. 
An aggressive pour into the glass yields an inky black that more than lives up to its namesake. This thing is just is an absolute impenetrable pitch dark with 2 fingers of fantastic looking thick and creamy burnt mocha colored head. This simmers down into a thin yet sturdy layer of retention that fires up magnificently when swirled, just absolutely COATING the sides of the glass with frothy swathes of lacing. This is just beautiful looking in my glass. The first thought that crosses my mind as I initially sniff this, is how exceedingly fresh, floral, and hoppy this aroma is. Fortunately, this is just the beginning of a most excellent bouquet, as the aroma's hop profile gives way to some powerful Stout qualities. Baker's chocolate, roast, smoke, coffee, molasses, dark fruits, and finally some light heat. Damn, there is a ton packed into this nose! 
The taste is large and in charge on the palette, with a beefy mix of smoky and sticky tasting blackstrap molasses, chocolate covered cherries, brown sugar, roasted malts and coffee that blend into a firmer feeling hop bitterness in the backend. I will say that as this warms and sits and the carbonation lowers, the hop profile lessens as well, leaving behind a sweet, tangy, warm, and slightly bitter viscous mess that I'm just loving every minute of! The mouthfeel is huge and chewy feeling (definitely up there with Dark Lord and Expedition Stout on the thickness scale) with a massive creamy body up front that works itself into a more prickly feel in the middle, before it slides into a oily and viscous feel in the back. The ABV that is present in the body is hefty and warming but it never gets boozy or stinging at all. As a matter of fact, it feels just right considering the huge amount of flavors that are at work here. 
This beer kind of gives new meaning to the phrase "demon in a bottle", as this beastly beer possessed my soul from the get go and didn't let go until the last drop was drained from the glass. Powerful feeling and complex, this is up there in rarified top RIS status for me. I will say that this definitely came off as much sweeter than other top picks in the style but I didn't mind at all. There was enough bitterness to keep it in check, plus I really liked how this aspect differentiated it from some of the other top Imperial Stouts out there. This was awesome stuff that I'm really happy to have finally been able to sit down and enjoy a full bottle of it. 2,722 charactersKegatron, Jan 15, 2009
4.36/5  rDev -1.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Cheer to Buebie, thanks Brian!
Pours a brown tinged mahogany with 2+ fingers of fluffy mocha colored head. Superior head retention & lacing
S: Hints of cherry & oak, plus cocoa powder
T: Dark fruit & chocolate & a touch of licorice up front, plus charred grains on the edge of the throat. Rich dark chocolate & dryness dominate as this warms, along with grainy bitterness on the roof of the mouth. Finishes dry with cocoa powder, a touch of vanilla, cherry, raisins & just a hint of Bourbon 
MF: Slick, oily, sticky with low, near nil carbonation
Drinks a might bit, slow, the dryness & complexity slow me down some. Still, a very good RIS indeed. Well done Surly! 669 charactersrusspowell, Jan 14, 2009
2.86/5  rDev -35.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2I received bottles from beerbeagle, Viggo and scoobydank. Thanks for this, guys! Split it with johnmichaelsen last night.
A: Jet black with an inch-thick dark brown head. Looks very impressive with some lacing.
S: Spicy hops right out of the gate, spicy enough to make me think of a papad (matpe bean flour and black pepper roasted together). Definitely pine-like in hop character. Dark bitter chocolate in the back with a LOT of roasted malt aroma, roasted and acridly bitter. The hops lend a unique twist to this beer but there isn't enough of a backbone to pull this off.
T: Opens up WAY too sweet, artificially so (is this beer approved for phenylketonurics?), malted milk balls. Hops come through with a piney bitterness but not enough to balance the sweetness. At the risk of belaboring a point, this beer is all too sweet, lacking in any real complexity. In addition, there's a rather strange acrid malt bitterness that just does not work
M: Light in body, almost too light. Carbonation is good but the finish is too sweet for my liking.
D: Poor, I'm having a hard time finishing this. In fact,I couldn't finish the 8-10oz I poured for myself. 
Notes: I really wanted to like this beer but it's an imperial stout in the vein of the sweeter ones - DWF WWS, Dark Horizon (both beers being superior) and in some respects, the Mikkeller Black. If you like these beers, you'll go apeshit over this but honestly, I'm not really a fan. 1,441 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 10, 2009

A- as you would expect pitch black with a medium tan head, not the dark brown dark lord or abyss head though.
S- very similiar to dark lord with less sweetness, lot of smells here, sweet raisins, chocolate, roasted coffee, and some hop aroma as well. seems like its right where it needs to be a good balance.
T- I loved this, just like the smell it has the balance is exceptional. Starts out a little sweet then hits you with chocolate and coffee and finishes with a little hop bitterness. My favorite RIS so far!!!
M- Thinner than expected, but i have had dark lord very recently so this is expected. 
D- I could drink this everyday as the huge variety of smells and flavors are all a little subdued but work flawlessly together.
Great beer and i am thrilled to have had the opportunity to try, now we just need a barrel aged version!! 967 charactersJWD, Jan 09, 2009

A: Black as a stout will be, with a fairly light tan head. Very bubbly and sticky. 
S: Quite an incredible scent. Big, doughy malts... I get something almost like fresh gingerbread batter. Some chocolate in there.
T: A nice, big, roasted malt... it's quite sweet and chocolatey. Again, I get some hints of gingerbread from it, which is quite nice. On the finish, a little hint of licorice comes out. It takes a little while and some warmth to come out, but it's nice.
M + D: Very rich and sticky... big molasses like consistency. To date, I don't believe I've come across something quite this thick. It can get quite sweet after a while, but it's certainly a very good flavour and aroma. Quite pleased with this one, and it moves away from a trend of a couple weaker offerings. 842 charactersProteus93, Jan 06, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Giving this a try from the bottle thanks to the generosity of Mully. 
Glugs a viscous black from the bottle. Giving this the usual vigorous pour I give to RIS's, a dark tan head mushroom clouds into a massive, pillowy and slowly dissipating dark tan head. Great scent - west coast fruity hops and berry, mixed with molasses, raisin, and leather. Flavor is a bit of a surprise, very mild and fruity. A dash of coffee opens up to the aforementioned berry and citrus, surrounded by milk chocolate, prickly spice, and a splash of grapefruit before bittering away from the tastebuds. Concludes like I took a swig of hot cocoa and chased it with an IPA. No bad thing, might have to try that. 
Thick as anticipated but not as monstrous as others. I'm actually a little disappointed in this aspect, a little thin for my liking, i think it could cling to the tongue a bit more. Sorta skim chocolate milk-esque, which I don't have fond memories of. Still, the lighter mouthfeel results in a pretty quaffable concoction, though it gets a bit cloying at warmer temps. 
I had this at the EBF last Feb and recall thinking it similar to Stone RIS (a solid compliment). Not at all the case from the bottle a couple months earlier. I'd like to try this straight from the source at release as I think the hops truly make this beer. Not quite as complex as I'd hoped but still top notch. 1,371 charactersgrandq, Jan 05, 2009

a - pours deep dark and black, amazingly dense tan head that lasts forever and leaves great lacing, nice reverse cascade of bubbles with every drink, beautiful looking beer
s - very "bright" aroma with lots of citrusy hops apparent in the nose along with more traditional RIS aromas of dark, bittersweet chocolate and dark fruits
t - very complex on the palate with lots of dark, bittersweet chocolate, coffee and deeply roasted malt mixed with citrus and hoppy bitterness on the finish, the alcohol is remarkably masked, fairly sweet, but much less so than many big imperial stouts such as Dark Lord, faintly reminiscent of Stone IRS in its hoppyness and balance
m - medium-to-full bodied with moderate carbonation, not the viscous mess that many big imperial stouts become, this is one area where Darkness really excels, enough body to satisfy as an imperial stout, but not overly thick
d - an intense stout no doubt, but subtle and relatively drinkable at the same time, much more drinkable than many of the top tier imperial stouts such as Dark Lord and Abyss, fairly easy on the palate while bringing a whole lot of flavor, and the alcohol is well-masked
Overall, a stellar imperial stout and another very fine effort from Surly. Well worth seeking this one out if nothing else than for its uniqueness amongst its peers in the imperial stout category. 1,456 charactersWeisGuy, Jan 03, 2009

2008 vintage.
Thanks Greggy for the chance to taste this wonderful beer.
Sorry Surly Darkness....but Three Floyd's Dark Lord has you beat...just barely though.
A - Wonderful. Dark black with bitter dark chocolate covered cherry look. Fantastic. Swirl the glass...where the beer meets the top of the glass, a wonderful red color can be noticed. Incredible.
S - Fresh. Raisins. Molasses. Black Cherries. Chocolate. There is so many things going on in this beer, who can describe them all.
T - I think this beer needs to sit for about 1 year....that is why I have my own bottle cellaring under the stairs waiting for next November to roll around. Fruit. Strong Alcohol taste. Cherries. Chocolate. Much better when served at room temperature. Fantastic brew.
M - Thick. Filling. Creamy. I want this beer to last all night but...Dang it doesn't.
D - High Alcohol. Available once a year only in Minnesota...low point but only slightly.
One of my top five beers to date. Fantastic. Almost perfection in a bottle. Close. Will re-review next November. 1,116 charactersschellsbeer, Jan 03, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 bottling
Appearance: Pours a viscous black with chocolate edges and a creamy mocha head; sheets of lace remain in the chalice once the foam has subsided
Smell: Coffee, dark chocolate, berry fruit and a hint of cigar smoke; the citrus hops are mysterious, sometimes making their presence felt and other times indiscernable
Taste: Milk chocolate and Cuban coffee up front, with a developing berry element arriving shortly thereafter; by mid-palate, however, there is a building citrus hop flavor that becomes relentless after a while; after the swallow, the Cuban coffee returns and mixes with dark chocolate; plenty of citrus on the finish as well; the cigar flavors re-appearing in the aftertaste
Mouthfeel: By far, the thickest beer I have ever tasted, with moderate carbonation; a bit of warmth in the gullet after the swallow 
Drinkability: New Year's eve, and it is time to break out this special occasion beer; for me, it lived up to the hype; unlike other hoppy stouts where the bitter flavors battle with the malt, in this beer, the blending of the contrasting flavors is unique 1,095 charactersbrentk56, Jan 01, 2009
4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A big thanks to trader imperialking for allowing me to get this bottle without offering up an appendage I may some day need. 
Been patiently aging it for 2 months and my fucking patience is dead. A special visit from far-away friends and fellow BAs OlieIPA and Aimstatus is the final straw. Darkness dies tonight!
It pours black. Really, it does. Poured hard to create a big, frothy, chunky ass light brown head. Chunks of lace. Not wisps; chunks. The head is an alien landscape of spider webs.
Sniff has ... HOPS! Are you kidding me? Oh blessed day to find a big strong kick ass stout with HOPS! And I haven't had a hop all damn day. Awesome. I hope the mouth picks up what the nose is putting down. OK, the hops aren't smelling super strong, I'm just excited that they are there at all. A slight piney scent that makes me happy.
The taste is quite simply the most unique flavor I have ever encountered in a beer. I taste peanut butter and jelly. Slight chocolate flavor and the pine is there also. Mint chocolate chip ice cream flavors. Tons of flavors. Way damn complex. Sorry - this is friggin good! Reminds me of a Stone XI, only betterer and betterer. 
I love to shit on the overhyped beers, but I have nothing bad to say here. This is truly awesome and I hope someday down the road I can have it again. I would drink it fresh to preserve as much of the hop flavor as possible, which collides superbly with the traditional stout flavors.
Smooth texture, but the bitterness keeps it from being silky.
Overall: absolutely awesome 1,540 charactersPatronWizard, Dec 28, 2008
4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I tried, I really did.
After waiting so long, I wanted this night to be perfect and I gave it my doggone best. Waited months to share this with someone who would appreciate it. Bought some nice cheeses that I thought would work well, even spent time and energy to carefully align them on a cheese board so that Darkness would realize that I like to keep things clean and presentable.
I wanted to set up a nice play list, I wanted this to be memorable, I wanted this to be special....
But this demon beer wouldn't have any of it. It spent hours upon hours over the past few months coaxing at me... and when I finally open it the anarchist was let loose:
Computer shuts down, there goes my play list. So I scramble to open up the lap top and try to get hypemachine or Pandora going, figuring that at least that would offer a nice musical background... but this goddamn beer somehow ruined my internet connection. The cheese wasn't right and the room was uncomfortably hot... as if Lucifer here brought the brimstone from the depths of hell with him. What in holy heaven was going on, why after so much time did Darkness feel the need to treat me with so little respect.
Then I took a deep breath, focused, closed my eyes and it all came together. You don't control the Darkness... you don't "create" an environment that works. He dictates his own situation. This beer decides the temperature, it will let you know what music your listening too. It will tell you if and when you should have some damn cheese. Darkness doesn't want Martha Stewart... It won't be manipulated onto a christmas platter with bells and whistles... IT demands YOU to respect IT.
So I gave in. Screw the computer... we went with Comcast Music Channel 814. And you know what... almost as if great change in direction.. channel 814 had Vampire Weekend: Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa playing, too fitting. I prepared myself to completely let go of the situation, finally popped the cap off, jumped in the back seat and let Darkness do some driving:
From the back seat I just can't see thru Darkness. I tilted my head in every conceivable direction to try and see thru this black hole of a monster, but no shot. It is not worth the effort. He has such a big frothy and thick dark tan head. I suppose that is what happens when you spend your days in fire, brimstone and constant heat.
I can smell him easily from back here and you can tell he has lived a bit of life this one. Once a raging alcoholic, he seems to have simmered down a bit (or at least drink a better bourbon). The aromas of chocolate and vanilla come first, but as he jets down this dark highway towards hell I more and more get dark fruits; cherries, raisins, prunes. 
He stops the car, turns around and demands me to bow down and kiss his feet. At this point, as Loser by Beck is now blasting from channel 814... I don't think twice. He tastes like chocolate and a homemade dark cherry/blackberry jam. You would think that he would be big, strong, over-the-top... but under all the upside down skulls and long swaying black robes there is a true sweet side to him. Maybe the year or so that he spent on earth softened him up a bit, but as I find myself on my hands and knees kissing the feet of this "monster", I can't help but to relax a bit. Maybe it's all a farce. Maybe, just maybe, when push comes to shove... he is a nice man. As the ride goes on the chocolate and coffee kind of succeed to the sweetness and dark fruit.
The tank starts to empty and I realize I am going to miss this ride. It was a ride that served a purpose, it showed me that with age, bumps and bruises... people, beer, even demon gods can change. They can open up and become even more complex then they originally were, showing more character and personality. I step out almost wanting to get back in, but now is no longer my time.

4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Found this on tap at Cafe Twenty-Eight. Outstanding find this holiday season.
Poured into a Darkness chalice. Almost pitch black with a very little bit of light getting in on the corners. The head was a tan color and clung to the glass as the beer disappeared.
Aroma is of dark molasses with a slight coffee roastiness.
Flavor is a molasses sweet nose breaking through to a coffee roastiness and slight hop bitterness. Notes of chocolate, figs, with slight hints of fermented fruits like raisins and plums.
Overall an incredible version of the style of RIS! 561 charactersahalloin, Dec 28, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 750 mL bottle split with a friend
A: Pours a very thick, viscous black liquid with a fluffy, dense tan coffee colored head. Amazing retention, the head hangs around for the entire glass with sticky rings of lacing.
S: Dense, complex aroma, but not as strong as expected. Very sweet, dark fruit like raspberries, boysenberries and raisins, etc. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, faint citrus, light hops and alcohol all also come through.
T: First thing that hits me is the strong sweetness, that is slightly bitter. Dark, ripe fruits that persist through the finish, raspberry, blackberry, etc but they fade a little as the beer warms up. Then thisa much richer malty, chocolaty and creamy flavor. A light hop bitterness but most of the bitterness is more coffee and dark fruit flavored. Alcohol is very present, but not abrasive, just a friendly warming. 
M: A very thick, creamy beer with very light carbonation keeps this from being too full bodied or chewy. After it warms up the finish is slightly fruity and chocolaty sweet
D: Every sip seems to tilt the flavors back and forth between slightly bitter fruitiness and sweeter malt/chocolate. Finish has a slight medicinal taste but overall the alcohol blends very nicely into the beer. An amazing RIS no doubt, but (while not the same beer) I still prefer something like The Abyss for example over this. 1,360 charactersyourefragile, Dec 24, 2008
3.33/5  rDev -24.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3750 ml wax-top bottle. Pitch black liquid. Thich tan head that lasts for quite some time, and surrenders some great looking patchwork of lace.
Loads of citrusy hops up front, big and juicy. Ripe fruit, chocolate, and alcohol come out in the nose. Interesting combo.
What sticks out to me up front is the amount of sweetness, a bit cloying for me. SOme chocolate comes in, but gets overtaken by a huge blast of citrusy hops. SOme warming from the alcohol.
Maybe a bit thin. Lower carbonation. Intesesting, but not my taste. Too much sweetness, with too much hop flavor. 571 charactersBierguy5, Dec 21, 2008
4.88/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours out a really dark black with no light coming through. One finger of small dark brown suds.
Raisin bread smell. Very doughy with hints of fruits, mango and pepper.
Taste is like sweet mango with sugar malts and raisin bread with just a hint of chocolate and a tinge of coffe aftertaste.
This is a well balanced and very refined drink.
Mouthfeel is wonderful and leaves just a tad of sugar behind. Love how it goes from sweet to salty then coffee bitter to dry sugar. This is a great RIS.
Drinkability is so high here because you cannot taste any alcohol or feel any in the back of the throat. 597 characterspeabody, Dec 20, 2008
2.99/5  rDev -32.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 32008 bottling. This was the beer I wanted very badly to love, but it just didn't work out between us :-(
Assets:
-creamy and dark brown, with a dark brown head and great retention; very inviting
-excellent creamy carbonation
-mouthfeel is heavy but still quite drinkable
Negative factors:
-bizarre sweetness that just doesn't work, like a double foreign export stout
-weird hop use, citrus rind-y like Simcoe; just doesn't work
-I was expecting way more bitterness
-muted nose
-drinkability suffers from the "off" flavors (no actual defects)
My numbers seem critical even to me, but since 2.0 is "not impressed" and I'm definetely not impressed, i gave it a 2.5. I'm not down on Surly at all; I love their other offerings. 725 charactersrayjay, Dec 20, 2008
3.58/5  rDev -19%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Finally tryiing some of this. Dark nearly black with a slight bricking quality. A pillowing rocky head of mocha has very good length, sponge like in appearance.
Full of citrusy hops leading in the orange rind category. Too citrusy for my liking in an RIS. Big chocolate with caramel and toffee and loads of dark fruits, black licorice and mollasses. 
Good very tasty beer yet very out of whack and almost cloyingly sweet with an odd hop flavor to citrusy for the style in my opinion. Chocolate covered hops, fudge and cocoa. Hops are juicy and resiny with that orange peel sense. Blackberry, juicy plum, mollasses, black currant, bitter finish but overpowered by the cloying amounts of residual sugar. 
Don't really like the huge hops and the out of whackiness. I will save my other bottles a few years and try again once the hops surrender some. 849 charactersmcallister, Dec 18, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this on tap 3 times in Chicago, IL this winter so far at Hopleaf, Sheffield's and Local Option. Each time was served in a snifter or stemmed tulip.
A: DARK black with head ranging from khaki colored to copper brown to almost chocolate milkshake looking. Lots of lacing left on the glass on this one.
S: Smells of chocolate, coffee, toffee, dark fruits or raisins, maybe some slight blackberry or raspberry in there too. Lots of different smells in there.
T: Tastes even better than it smells! but still has the chocolate, coffee, toffee, dark fruits/raisins, molasses, maybe some slight blackberry or raspberry. So many flavors, it's like you could focus on one and love it, then focus on another and it's like you are drinking different beers, but all the flavors are great.
M: Super creamy, sticky (seriously some spilled over and my fingers were sticking to the glass like I had eaten cotton candy), syrupy. Low carbonation.
D: Unbelievably drinkable. You can barely tell that the alcohol is in there and what is there goes so well with the rest of the beer it makes you want even more. I was crushed when I ordered another and they came back with just a couple ounces because the keg was dry.
This is EASILY my favorite beer that I have ever drank up to this point. I get giddy when I go somewhere and see it on the beer list. I hope they bottle more of this and ship it to Chicago next year. I have to give this all 5's until I can find something that proves me wrong. 1,483 charactersdukedevil0, Dec 17, 2008

The apperance was dark black everywhere - not even a hint of color at the edges. Thin layer of dark black rich head of tight bubbles.
Nose is a very complex combination of malt, spice and pepper.
Taste is lots of fruit and sweet malts, even some milky creaminess to it. Aftertaste of more dark cherries and chocolate.
Mouthfeel is amazing. Milky slick coating with a slight alcohol hint.
This badboy just went on my "wants" list. Yum. 560 charactersLoRezDave, Dec 15, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52008 bottle.
A-Pours nice and thick. Black in color, with a small brown head.
S-Upon first smell I get a little bit of American citrus and piney hops. I then get a lot of chocolate, and dark fruits. Kind of like chocolate covered cherries/blackberries/figs/plums. A very nice nose.
T-Big chocolate. Milk chocolate as well as dark chocolate lead the way. Then the fruits rush in and i get the chocolate covered fruits taste which was great. I got little to no hoppiness on the palate which was a little disappointing, and not what i was expecting. In the finish i tasted robitussin...that medicinal cherry taste. It became more prevalent the more i drank, but doesnt hurt the beer too much. This was one VERY SWEET beer, which I am not usually a fan of, but the flavors mostly made up for that downfall.
M-Full bodied, nice and thick. coated the mouth very well. Silky smooth with low carbonation.
D-Good. The medicinal taste at the end without the hop balance took away from the drinkability some. No trace of alcohol helped.
Overall, this is one of my favorite beers. A little too sweet to drink a full bottle by yourself, but great to split with a friend. A great dessert beer. 1,185 charactersTK5150, Dec 15, 2008

Black, nearly opaque, with dark brown edges. A fluffy brown cap appeared after the pour, producing sticky, clumpy lace all the way down the glass. Great aroma, a combination of floral and citrus hops (mostly grapefruit and orange) with roast and burnt malts. Notes of cocoa and dark chocolate, biscuit, and anise wafted in and out. Solid bitterness, more grapefruit hop character, with lots of chocolate, caramel, and toffee. Quite sweet overall. Plenty of dark malts gave it a moderate roast flavour. Full bodied, kind of on the heavy side, with lowish carbonation, very fine bubbles, creamy texture, alcohol warmth, and just a bit sticky. Super delicious and much more balanced than I was expecting. 784 charactersDrJay, Dec 13, 2008

A: While pouring this beer quite aggressively into my glass, it appeared to boast all the qualities of a good looking stout: Viscous, black, and a huge frothy tan colored head. This beer left a large quantity of lacing around my snifter glass as well, even after I had guzzled down it's delicious contents. 
S: The initial whiff is quite shocking, a very hoppy-like aroma mixed in a powdery chocolate/cocoa characteristic. This mix of piney and bitter hops, along with the dark sweetness, reminded more of an American Double rather than a RIS. 
T: Unique....unique...unique! An extremely sweet tasting stout, but settled down by the ample amount of hops used in this beer. I pick up chocolate, pines, vanilla bean, maple, gingersnaps (yes, I said gingersnaps), caramel, peanut butter, and so much more. 
M: Full-body with almost no indication of carbonation. The flavors cling somewhat to the palate, but not to the point where the hop bitterness becomes a bit overwhelming. 
D: I actually don't pick up any of the alcohol content, and the flavor is quite interesting (in a good way), therefore making for a good time....anytime. 
Overall: I was actually expecting this beer to be overhyped, but it definitely lived up to the world class standards presented here on BA. Not your typical RIS, to say the least, and displays a multi-faceted array of flavors that my palate got excited over. If I had to sum up this beer in a few words, it would be: Unique, smooth, and yummy! A smile beer and a must try. Cheers! 1,623 charactersOlieIPA, Dec 13, 2008
2.44/5  rDev -44.8%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 |  overall: 1.5Thanks to mynie for the opportunity to try the infamous Darkness, 2008 750ml bottle, decided to have this one fresh as opposed to letting it age for a bit since I heard it's rather hoppy for a RIS.
Pours a dark brown/black color, some light being able to show ruby colors near the edge, very large tan head that fades slowly to leave some good lacing.
Smell is as anticipated, surprisingly (for a RIS once again) hoppy at first, some malt and smoke in the background, not quite to style but not unpleasant.
Taste takes the normal route and ditches the hoppiness that might have been expected after the aroma, instead it is cloyingly sweet, lots of chocolate and vanilla, also seems like there's other sugars that are added to make it much sweeter than it should be, very syrupy and sticky but not overly viscous.
An interesting take on the RIS, but I think I'd stick with Kate and Dark Lord for the top picks, I'd even reach for an Old Rasputin first. Glad I got to try it, but it doesn't even come close to the hype it has, maybe if it didn't taste like someone added a few cups of sugar to it it wouldn't have been as much of a chore to drink even a glass of it. Maybe a different vintage will change my mind down the road.
Edit (3/6/10): Remove Kate from top pick, 2010 was just as much of a cloyingly syrupy sweet mess. 1,328 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Dec 12, 2008

750ml bottle topped with bronze wax. 2008 vintage. sampled nov 28/08.

aroma is great. big hops up front - orange, grapefruit, pine. big bready malt base. biscuit. cracker. light alcohol. anise. dark and bittersweet chocolate. light coffee. big floral character too.
taste is great. just under medium bitterness level. milk and dark chocolate. anise. big caramel and toffee sweetness. bread and biscuit. the citrusy hops are still there, but a bit more subdued than in the aroma. light alcohol. bit of smoke. some dark fruit too.
mouthfeel is great. silky smooth medium-low carbonation level. large body.

I finally got a chance to taste the nectar known as the Darkness. There is so much hype around this beer, you can imagine my extreme joy when I walked into this bar and saw this on tap. Since I can't get it in PA - this was a pleasant surprise.
Of course, as the name says, it pours a dark brown, basically black beer. Had a nice tan head and the lacing on the glass was great. The smell was crisp and sweet, woodsy and smoky. There was a twinge of alcohol in the nose as well.
the taste is simply WOW. very malty, very sweet and you can absolutely taste the alcohol (which is 10%+). there is the roasted malt taste and the earthy and woodsy tastes as well. Mouthfeel was surprising nice with a bit of a sharp alcohol taste. 791 charactersHophead101, Dec 09, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I've had this twice on tap now, and I still find it a bit curious, especially when compared to FFF Dark Lord. Dark Lord has a huge, huge viscous mouthfeel, somewhat like Bell's Expedition Stout. Darkness is not as thick or heavy, but it has a very looong, rich mouthfeel. You just can't gulp it. Each sip just keeps on going and going. As a homebrewer, I think that Dark Lord's weight is due to the heavy use of oats, crystal malt, and a high mash temperature. But as to what makes Darkness have such a long mouthfeel, I'm genuinely flummoxed. 543 charactersgoethean, Dec 07, 2008
3.66/5  rDev -17.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Pours pitch black into a Darkness snifter. One finger, dark tan head lasts a good while, with spotty lacing. Nose is an interesting mix of chocolate, earth, plum, raisin and piney hops. Surprisingly sweet and fruity on the palate. A bit of chocolate and vanilla, and pine from the hops, but the overall flavor is dominated by an almost cloying, sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is very nice, creamy and soft. ABV is nearly invisible. The sweetness makes one glass enough for me.
If this were available for $6.99 at BevMo, I'd say it were a tasty, unique beer. But considering the acclaim and rarity, I think it strays too far from the style. 637 characters0110x011, Dec 07, 2008

4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this on tap at the Local Option, served in a Maudite glass. The beer was dark brown/black color with dark tan froth on top. Lots of wet lacing on the glass. The smell alone tells me this beer isn't over hyped, it smells insanely good. Rich and sweet, no burnt or roasted aromas, maybe some hops citrus but not as much as I'd have expected after hearing how hoppy this beer was last year. The taste is also nearly perfect. Huge malt sweetness, a little bitterness but not much, some citrus flavors too, I can't recall ever tasting a RIS quite like this. The body is substantial while not being as thick as Dark Lord, just about right for the flavors. Absolutely drinkable, the &gt;10% ABV isn't noticeable from the taste. Worth the effort to find, this is great stuff.
1/02/09 edit:
I had this in bottle form, side-by-side against Sexual Chocolate, Dark Lord, and Kate the Great. In this contest Darkness came out the favorite for all 3 drinkers. The citrus flavors were the deciding factor, it seemed like this was a RIS with DIPA genes. I'll plan to attend future Darkness days to get as many bottles as I can. 1,118 charactersTurdFurgison, Dec 03, 2008

Thick, black, sticky. Got some on the outside of the glass, was sticking like syrup. 
Sweet, spicy, fruity (in a good way) smell. Lots of dark fruit, dark sweetness. More sweet than spicy. Very inviting on the nose. 
Did I mention sweet? Alcohol barely noticed. Smooth, velvety, perfect on the tongue. Is there a better mouthfeel than this beer? Hops are there too, for sure. Dark fruits work with the molasses type sweetness. Almost cloying in 2008, less so 2009 (and other years I've heard)
I really like this beer. First impression was it's too sweet, subsequent tastings I started to appreciate the sweetness more, didn't notice it as much. It is what it is. A sweet, flavorful monster of a beer, liquid velvet, and quite the feather in surly's cap.
2009: less sweet, more hops. 
2010: May be my favorite of the last 3 years. Flavors all seem in the right place. 933 characterscaskstrength, Nov 30, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 Vintage.
Appearance: Pours an inky black body with a large, frothy, light tan head.
Smell: Roasty, burnt malt nose with strong notes of dark chocolate liqueur, coffee, smoky creosote, and pine needles.
Taste: Roasty, dark, chocolaty maltiness displays both depth and richness. A few spoonfuls of frothed cream pairs with a flavor of strong coffee. Bracing amount of sweetness present. Vinous fruity character. Touch of creosote. Strong pine and citrus hoppiness though not unreasonably so. The bitterness makes a decent attempt, but, for me, it doesn't ever even begin to overtake the malt sweetness. Darkness finishes with a strapping roastiness and more unyielding sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Decidedly full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.
Drinkability: Excellent melding of full flavors wrapped up in a dense, creamy body. I wasn't disappointed. Nice work, Surly. 890 charactersChainGangGuy, Nov 29, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4750 ml bottle acquired at this years darkness day, poured into tulip glass
Appearance: Darkness. Opaque. Beautiful two finger tan head. This is exactly how a RIS should look.
Smell: Wooo. Almost makes me fall back in my seat. Such an array of aromas I don't know where to start. Roasted malt, chocolate, slight coffee, then strong sweetness of fruits ranging everywhere from orange/lemon to strawberry jam and cherries. Amazing.
Taste: This may be the drink of the devil but it tastes like it's straight out of heaven. Dark chocolate, orange, and dark cherries are the first three things that hit me but there is soo much more going on here. Earthy tones and what I have to imagine are hop flavors hit after the initial sweet and roasted flavor. This has got to be the hoppiest imperial stout I've ever had and that's a good thing, a very good thing. The combination of malt sweetness and hop bitterness in this beer make the flavors so complex that each sip is an experience. Outstanding.
Mouthfeel: Perfect. Coats my mouth with the beer but not to the point where it's hard to swallow. The mouthfeel increases the enjoyment of this beer tenfold because it helps the flavors stay in your mouth that much longer. This is also exactly how a RIS should feel.
Drinkability: Surprising. I've had a good amount of imperial stouts and it's one of my favorite styles, but even my favorites test me when it comes to drinkability. I usually want to have more than one or two but can't bring myself to do it. With Darkness though, I could literally drink this all night until I stumble to bed. Very impressive.
Overall: The very best RIS I have ever had. Do whatever you can to get your hands on this miraculous beer. I love Surly. 1,727 charactersoptiontwo, Nov 29, 2008

S. Smell was definitely on point. Vanilla, Chocolate dominate this with a faint hops and booze smell.
T. Taste like some tasty boozed up pudding. Just like the smell, Vanilla and chocolate lead the way. Dark fruit, caramel sweetness, hops and booze hit on the finish. Sweet and tasty.

D. If I had access to this regularly, you'd have to peel my ass of the bar floor in a darkness induced coma. drinks smooth hit with a bang.

Aroma of citrus hops , dark chocolate and sweet caramel.
This beer is sweet. A lot of dark candy sugar tastes. Molasses, raisins, caramel, and figs. The sweetness comes at the expense of darker flavors I enjoy (coffee, chocolate & bitterness). Hops are their, but somewhat subdued.

Poured into Corsendonk tulip glass. Jet black and very viscous, almost oily in appearance. Thick frothy coffee colored head that slowly retreats into a nice thin lace. Stickage all up and dpown the glass - awesome looking brew and dark indeed.
This is the strangest, but great, brew I have ever had. Part DIPA, porter and mostly RIMP...
Since it is a RIMP, you would expect roasted malts and chocolate in the nose. While its there, initially the brew smells like a west coast DIPA. Sweet floral hops pervade the nose - ripe tropical citrus friut and berries. This is followed by chocolate and vanilla notes. The nose is quite complex.
Tastes a smoothing sweet malt base. Vanilla and oak are very present with coffee and chocolate undertow. Of course the hops - in the back and really balance out the brew quite nicely. It changes however as it warms - reminding me of a porter in some sense. Very complex brew with lots going on. Mouthfeel is wet and velvety with meduim to low carbonation. The only thing I could say about this brew that might be considered negative - is its very sweet. This might be off-putting to some but not to me.
I still can't wrap my head around this brew - quite unique but simply fantastic!! 1,359 charactersphattysbox, Nov 24, 2008

T/M: Deliciously creamy and full bodied. Great imperial stout flavors. Really like how the dark fruit flavors worked in here; it was very unique for the style. Everything was exceptionally well balanced, with nothing dominating or overpowering.
D: I could drink a lot of ton of this. Yet, I can barely get my hands on it, so it's gets a knock.
This was delicious, complex, and unique. Up there with the best of them. 728 charactersabfraser, Nov 24, 2008

A: Thick, black stout with a big tan head.
S: Dark roasted malts, coffee, and lots of fruit.
T: Again, dark roasted malts, lots of hops, and very sweet fruit flavor going on here. As abfraser said while we were drinking this, it's like a fruitcake stout. Very interesting and unusual taste.
M: Pretty thick and smooth, sticky from all the sugar.
D: Gotta ding Darkness on the drinkability front. I strained to drink a third of this bottle, but pushed myself and got it done. Not sure why it's not offered in smaller bottles. Pretty ridiculous. 594 characterswaltonc, Nov 23, 2008

S - Milk chocolate, slight soy sauce, hints of smoke and roasty malts.
T - Similar to aroma. Milk chocolate, dark fruits, hint of soy sauce and licorice, some smoke and roasted malts.
M - Very creamy but slightly thin. The mouthfeel reminded me of a creamy porter.
D - The lighter body made this one too easy to drink, even at 10%+ ABV. Tasty. 445 charactersbrewcrew76, Nov 23, 2008
4.33/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap at Stub and Herb's. Notes via text.
Served in a pint.
Pours dark and pretty thick like last years. The smell is a bit sweeter and the hops and smoke seems less than last years. The taste is much sweeter and creamier. Hops are still at a good level but not quite a potent as before which is probably an improvement. The smoky/meaty character is much lower but still in the back. I liked the stronger smoke =. The body is much creamier and smoother than from the bottle last year. Above average drinkability but not as good drinkable at Ktg. Very good. 559 characterspwoods, Nov 21, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Unlike the similarly cultish Dark Lord, the Darkness is at least obtainable. Surprisingly, we have been supping it locally for a few weeks now; I was worried it would have disappeared the first tapping night. 
Anyway, to the beverage. Exceptionally dark, black as night, tho tempered by a tinge of burnt umber. The head is relatively thin with slight foaminess and is dark brown. 
The aroma is arresting; a warm, complex but balanced combination of hop, espresso roast, dark chocolate, malt.
The smoothness is shocking: no hard edges or strong statements, but a gorgeous, luxurious, rich but subtle concoction. Not overly sweet like perhaps the Goose Island Bourbon Stout inclines to. The espresso bite reigns it in there. You don't want to pour this over ice cream; you want to savour and sip it.
This has a complex flavour profile that would put many much more expensive wines to shame, yet we are drinking for a fraction of the cost. 940 charactersAylwinForbes, Nov 21, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Sampled on tap at the Grumpy Bulldog in Naperville. Was pretty surprised to see this on the beer menu here but very very happy that is was.
Served in a pint glass.
A: Black. One and a half inch, thick, coffee and chocolate colored head. While Darkness has Dark Lord beat in terms of head retention and lacing, both of which are very nice and rather surprising to see in a beer this size, Dark Lord wins out for sheer viscosity. I could swirl beer in the glass and could still see though it afterwards, still remains as one of the better looking imperial stouts out there today.
S: Again fantastic. Hops are a very big part of this beer but not so much so that they overpower everything else. This beer is still able to muscle across some incredibly creamy aromas that mixes wonderfully together with the sweet, chocolaty, dark fruitiness of the beer.
T/MF: This is where things get interesting. Super sweet and creamy, at once bitter, at once sweet, perfectly balanced. There are times when I want to imagine that there is bourbon and coffee in this beer but on taking another sip it just doesn't taste that way. It's like some combination of boozy chocolate and coffee and cream mixed with candied, almost over-ripe fruits covered in brown sugar and caramel. Put this way the beer sounds revolting, overly sweet and perhaps undrinkable, but an underlying bitterness keeps things from becoming a cloyingly sweet, sugary mess. Mouthfeel helps out here as well, not really all that thick, at least compared to some of the jacked up imperial stouts out there. Incredibly smooth, velvety almost, though could stand to be a little fuller, chewier, to be more specific.
D: I could drink this until my body forced me to stop. The beer was gone before I really even felt like I got to know it. The balance that this beer displays makes drinking it so easy that you almost forget about how complex it is, a beer to pay attention to, seek out, and always try again. Fantastic. 1,971 charactersbluemoonswoon, Nov 20, 2008

A-Deep black with a medium tan head that receded to a thin ring that left decent lace.
S-Chocolate malt with hints of licorice and a bit of coffee. Mild spicy hops notes. A light bit of soy in the background.
T-Chocolate and light coffee up front. Rich, roasty malt with a smoky character. An odd flavour persists in the back that I just can't put my finger on. 
M-Full bodied, smooth and quite slick. Nice lingering bitterness.
D-Complex and big bodied but compared to last years version I was a bit let down. I was hoping for the fresh hop/massive dark roasty malt bomb and this is not it. What happened? Nothing about this years offering really excited me. Good...but lacking. 756 charactersDeuane, Nov 20, 2008

Shared with friends.
Pours almost completely black and opaque, but has some very small ruby edges. A thin layer of light brown head forms on top and quickly dissipates. The head has poor retention, but left a little bit of lacing behind.
The nose is pretty nice. It seems fairly hoppy actually. Kind of citrusy, herbal, and spicey. Some roasty malts, and a bit of fruit as well are available on the nose. 
The taste is ok, but a bit of a let down for this cowboy. A bit of hops, and some flavors I'm having trouble putting my finger on. It seemed kind of earthy to me, fruity, and a bit woody. It was really interesting. I was getting some molases as well. I was going to give it a 4 for taste, but I'm going to bump it to 4.5 since I think they've achieved something really new here. So many RIS's have the exact same flavor profile, but this at least has something new to offer and I really appreciate that. 
The mouth is full bodied, and fairly creamy. It was lightly carbonated.
Drinkability is moderate to high. It was tasty, and the booziness was masked and incorporated well enough. Overall, I'm pretty pleased but slightly disappointed. 1,199 charactersGoliath, Nov 18, 2008

10z glass was pitch black with a dark khaki head, which left a nice amount of stick and kept a thin lace.
Smell was very malty, with sweet chocolate aromas, some molasses and caramel, and dark fruit. Taste was also quite sweet, with chocolate and roasted malt flavors, lots of caramel and chocolate sweetness. Good amount of dark fruit, too, like maybe figs and plums. I found it to be maybe a tad too sweet, which took away from the drinkability for me. It was rich and full bodied, chewy and creamy. Overall a very good, very tasty beer. Glad I got to try this on tap. 609 charactersnumber1bum, Nov 18, 2008
4.03/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Onyx with a 1/2" tan head. Really nice look to this brew. Looks like a big RIS.
S - Smoke, fruit (grapefruit and peach, maybe?), and roast. Some coffee. The candi sugar starts to become VERY prevalent.
T - Though it opens very well, with flavors of vanilla and coffee, it starts almost too tart and too sweet, as if the candi sugar is dragging an otherwise great beer down. The warming gives you an idea of why the Belgian sugar is used in this brew. It's extremely unique and forward, but it could definitely use some mellowing.
M - The creaminess here is something most other brews would beg for.
D - The alcohol is there, of course, but it doesn't feel like a 10.3% beer. It's a really nice beer and worth every penny, but I believe this vintage just seemed too young to really appreciate right off the bat. I have a bottle that I'll be cellaring, and I'm quite sure this review will improve after I enjoy that. 922 charactersbainard, Nov 18, 2008

S - Light Soy quality, milk chocolate and something smoky and savory, thick and meaty, to the back end. 
T - Perfect. It can't do better. Thick, wonderful, smoky malt, loaded with milk chocolate but held in balance to an almost clean finish. Wow.
M - Creamy, heavy, coating, carb and balance pretty near perfect. Lip smacking good.

A - As the name implies, this RIS boasts a pitch black body with an attractive milky tan head that receded into a bubbly ring of patchy retention that left lots of lace around the glass. 
S - Lots of milk chocolate malty goodness with hints of black licorice and mild coffee. There also a bit of smoked meat in the backend, giving the aroma an almost gamey (ie. foul... as in chicken) character. It's a bit subdued, but it's still quite odd. 
T - Dark fruit and chocolate up front, with a bit of a smoked character resembling meat or gravy. Some coffee and licorice notes are also present. 
M - Full bodied, thick and rich with a slick, oily texture and minimal carbonation. Alcohol presence is pretty mild for a RIS. Finish is moderately bitter on the palate.
D - Complex RIS with an interesting flavor profile. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this style. I tend to gravitate more toward oatmeal and coffee stouts, personally. I found this one to be slightly over-rated. 1,039 charactersffejherb, Nov 17, 2008

A: The stout is admirably dark, a pitch black monster that has an off-white head that doesn't linger for long.
S: The stout is bold, thick and syrupy with an ancho chile smokiness. The thick malts reveal chocolate and caramel over time.
T: Chocolate nuttiness leads off the ale, dark and thick with a graham cracker-like finish. The ancho chile flavor is present, giving the stout a buffalo wing-like taste. Syrupy flavors are intense, sweet with a near-cloying presence. Coffee and cocoa see the stout away and they may be the best features of the bottle.
M: Syrupy, the stout borders on cloying at times. The cocoa powder is nice but it doesn't last long enough to make a difference.
D: To paraphrase, did I really shave me legs for this? I am underwhelmed and ranked this one behind the Coronado bourbon RIS, Dark Hollow and Full Sail Black Gold. Don't believe the hype! 941 charactersakorsak, Nov 17, 2008

Thanks to Hophead22 and scoobydank for this one! Shared this with jac5084 and nittanybeerfan last night.
A: Pours like sludge into the glass as it fills and creates a hearty head with a rather aggressive pour. Not the darkest beer I have seen, but there is only minor brown around the edges. Complete opaque though.
S: Smells like a damn DIPA! Actually, smells very similar to Stone XI Anniversary. I think it had my nose scratching its head. Tons of floral, cascade? hops in the nose then to the roast and coffee.
T: As Emeril would say...BAM! This is complete complexity with so many vast flavors. Tons of sweet, dark fruits come bursting through with nice raspberry, cherry, and raisin notes. After that, coffee, chocolate and cocoa hit you in the face. The hops are not bittering, but they are fresh and extremely flavorful.
M/D: Exceptionally creamy mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation. Doesn't go down like used oil like Darklord.
Overall, this is a fantastic RIS. One of the best without a doubt!

Updated review based on 2010 vintage. In short, the 2010 vintage is great, but does not have the complexities that the 2008 had. It is incredibly milky, thick, and smooth, but does not have the toffee or hop elements the 2008 had. Great, but not as good as the 2008. 1,309 characterstreyrab, Nov 15, 2008

I have to agree with Beachbum1975. The beer I tried was not well-balanced. Too sweet with an almost dried malt extract (carmelized) nose and taste. Good mouthfeel and color was incredibly deep copper black.
I can't see the beer I tried aging well because there wasn't enough bitter hop counterbalance.
After everything I read I really expected this beer to be a lot more than what I had on tap. 
In contrast, I had Black Albert the next day on tap and it was everything I hoped for. 521 characterswisrarebeer, Nov 15, 2008

T Holy cow. I like to refer to a beer like this as a sock-knocker-offer. Just an amazing blend of caramel, sweet chocolate, dark cherries, plums, vanilla, burnt malts, roast, just the right amount of oats to produce a perfect creamy texture. There's just so much here and it all mixes together in an oblivion of perfection. 
This beer is one of a kind, its so big and bold and flavor, yet so soft on the palate that I nearly shed a tear of sheer joy

4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to treyrab for including me on this tasting. 2008 Vintage.
Holy crap is really all I can say about this beer.
A: Pours like a thick used 5W-30 blend. The beer, when poured slightly aggressively pours extremely smoothly and then develops a nice 1cm head. The head slowly dissipates to a thin film and laces beautifully all the way down the class.
S: If you were blindfolded, you would think that you were about to dip into an imperial IPA from the smell of this. Rich in hops with an evidence of balance with malts, you can really feel the bitterness in this. I would have liked to have smelled a little bit more chocolate and fruits in it, though. That's the only thing that keeps this from being a 5 on smell.
T: WOW complexity. Dark fruits come right up to the front of the flavor. Immediately following the fruits are the chocolate roasted and caramel malts. Finishes with a nice creamy taste. The cream really rounds out this beer. I think there may be some oats in there to add to the creamy texture. Surprisingly, there is not even a hint of booze, despite the nearly 11% ABV.
M: There's still a little carbonation in this beer which puts it in front of Dark Lord for me. Way lighter in texture than it looks, and it slides beautifully down the palate. 
D: The 11% is the only thing that keeps this from being a 5. I can't see myself finishing a whole one of these, not that I wouldn't want to! 1,413 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Nov 15, 2008

On draft @ bavarian lodge
Nochange in ratings it's great, much more hops, very dry, much like last years - but a very drinkable stout.
On draft at the Binny's South Loop tap area. Almost gone...
Deep dark, oily black with a slight tan head, looks like it could be a Belgian Strong Dark or Stout.
Deep malt nose with some hoppiness.
Taste as deep malt with chocolate notes, not overdone, but zingy with a nice hop bite to offset the sweetness of the malt.
Full but not heavy, well balanced with low but fine carbonation.
Very drinkable for this style, nothing overpowers or is out of balance, but I perfectly balanced stout. Wish they delivered their cans to Chicagoland, maybe some day. 702 charactersrobbyc1, Nov 14, 2008

750 ml multi-color wax dipped bottle poured into a snifter. 2008 vintage. Served at about 50 degrees.
Pours a complete onyx black with a powerful two finger dark brown head that remains for quite sometime. After a good five minutes or so and lots of clingy spiderweb lacing on the sides of the glass, a creamy layer of goodness rests atop the black hole underneath. Smell...whoa hops. Sticky pine, bitter pink grapefruit, and raw gritty earth up front in the nose. Underneath all those hops is the dark stuff. Coffee grinds, sweet molasses, and heavy roasted malts add to the complex aroma. So much going on in the nostrils, time for a sip. Taste begins with burnt caramel, candy sugar, and smokey dark chocolate. Some booze, figs, and oily hops midway. Not nearly as much hop flavor on the tongue than were in the smell, but they're still there. Finishes with a gooey brownie batter, raspberries, and spruce. Do I dare say there's too much going on for the taste buds to function? Perhaps. Big, bold, and chewy feel with a full body and subtle carbonation. The one problem I find with the mouthfeel is the powerful bittering hop sting. Overall the 10% abv is hidden quite well, but Darkness is still a sipper. Needless to say, this is a super complex, big ass beer and definitely one of a kind. Good? Of course. Exceptional? That may be a stretch. Surly continues to produce some crazy beers, what's next??? Thanks again Dan. 1,606 charactersBeerTruth, Nov 13, 2008

This marks my first review of the 2008 Darkness, but in time there will be more reviews added, once there has been a year or so of cellaring done. Great, ominous label. Drank this on 11/10/2008 with soundbarrier, newtonty and a couple other non-BA friends. Served at the recommended 55 degrees.
Pours jet black with a surprisingly high viscosity when poured into my large tulip glass. Medium tan ¼ inch head after a semi-aggressive pour and leaves a nice, dark brown halo throughout the drink.
Floral and earthy hops all VERY evident in the nose. Smells of red and black cherries, alcohol, light chocolate, possibly light vanilla and a huge sweetness mixed with other dark fruits like figs. My initial thought is VERY sweet, too sweet and unbalanced. BIG hops presence, (much like Victory's Storm King), but even stronger! I am a hop head and I had a hard time getting through the overall sweetness so I didn't really taste any of the expected RIS attributes like: coffee, smoke, bitterness, dryness, char, chocolate, etc. 
Please don't fill up my inbox with nasty beermails! Maybe I got a bottle from the bottom of a barrel, you never know... For what it's worth, I LOVE Surly's other offerings, but if you were lucky enough to acquire or trade a couple of the 08's, drink one now if you want to make a comparison after aging it for some time, but I can't say it enough - this one definitely needs some time to mature and balance out.

Pours a black coffee brown with a maple/peanut butter-colored head (1 finger) that comes and goes, leaving sparse bubbles in the middle of the glass. Very viscous...sparse to decent lacing but solid trails up and down the glass.
One word...bountiful. Hearty malt candy sweetness with salty roasted peanuts and extremely deep caramel and chocolate malt. Alcohol wraps up in the thickness of it all. Is there enough room for hops? A cool bitterness of grass and slight pine detected. Aroma mellows slightly after pouring and with time.
This, for all its depth and complexity, is much drier on the palate than on the nose. Grass hop profile comes about with slight pine in the back. Salty peanut brittle forward malt taste. I know the sweetness...I know there's alcohol, but it's quite contained. Bittersweet chocolate emerges and strengthens with warmth. Absolutely love the dryness of this.
After a while the alcohol gets a little warm but it works in Beautiful Chemistry with the dry, chocolate coffee texture along with solid hop wilderness. Slowly slides down the palate in its extreme viscosity. Finish is slow and sultry. In spots there's slight emptiness but the holes get filled in right quick.
Oh, it's a sipper alright, but a damn fine one at that. One of the ultimate examples of balance in overabundance and utter depth. One of the best! 1,484 charactersIBUnit63, Nov 10, 2008

A- Black with a low caramel head which is very thick, has some good lacing as well.
S- Fruity hops with some malt but very much in the background.
T- Starts with a bit of hop then a big hop hit, then a hint of vanilla. I can find some caramel and lots of underlying levels are there and get a hint of them but the hops are distracting. 
M- Thick and smooth with some activity in my mouth, very nice really.
D- Easy if you like the hops pretty balanced but there is so much more in this beer that I just can't quite get to because of the hops. If you can find this you should have at least two, maybe not in the same night but at some point.
____
This is for the 2008 version that came out in October.
A- Black no light getting through this one, tan head with wonderful lacing.
S- Wow just a wonderful nose full of malts just so nice.
T- Nice malty some hops in there that really work well together, hints of caramel but very good.
M- Good thickness very smooth, work great with the flavors.
D- Very drinkable and very dangerous because of it.
This is my second review of this beer its much better then the first version put out. They have really improved the taste, hence why its only getting a 4 for taste if they can improve this much in this short of time they can improve much more. 1,396 charactersbeckje01, Nov 10, 2008
4.45/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Review #400 so let's make it Darkness. Bottles courtesy of a couple of super generous traders in Surly country poured into a snifter.
Not surprising, it's dark...pours jet black with hints of mahogany as it comes out of the bottle. The head is tan and three fingers high before receding to an inch-thick cap that lingers throughout with tons of lacing.
While not typical of the style, I found the aroma fascinating. The first smell was of floral hops, especially pine, along with some citrus. As it warmed, some of the dark malts and chocolate came out, but still with a heavy hop presence. It smells damn near like a DIPA. Crazy.
The taste steers back toward an RIS, but not all the way there. The initial taste is a quick citrus hop kick that tingles the tongue before the dark roasted malts and bakers chocolate melt the tingling away to a thick malty coating. The finish is a tad dry with a slight hop bitterness as well. The sweetness of dark fruits comes out much more as it warms, but again this is probably the hoppiest tasting RIS I'be had.
The mouthfeel is truly exceptional. Very, very creamy but with the perfect amount of carbonation to help the flavors pop.
Well, this may not be the best RIS I've had, but it is probably the most original. I'd heard it was hoppy, but I just had no idea. Big thanks again to Brian and Brent for opportunity to try this gem. 1,376 charactersgford217, Nov 08, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at the Bavarian Lodge on 11/05/08.
Appeared pitch black in color with a thin tan head. It sank down to a thin skim but could be revived with a bit of a swirl. Not much lace left behind however.
Aroma was a lot more mild than I would have expected compared to some other RIS but there was plenty of chocolate, molasses, coffee, a sugary sweetness, and a surprising hop presence. 
The taste had a huge molasses, candi sugar, and chocolate sweetness at the beginning then towards the middle it begin to dry up a bit and some coffee flavors came out but before they could really set themselves down a big citrusy and piney hop presence broke through and mingled with all the other flavors, leaving a pleasant hoppy and milk chocolate linger.
Mouthfeel was thick, full, and viscous. Very creamy and velevety. Just the way I like them. 
The thing that surprised me most about this one besides the hops was just how drinkable it was. I could easily have had four more glasses of this stuff with no problems at all. I'm glad I had the chance to try it, I can only hope it's a beer that eventually gets some distribution. 1,128 charactersroadhouse, Nov 06, 2008
4.45/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had this one on tap at the 2008 Illinois release party at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle. 
A= This stout poured a very dark brown/black color with a beautiful 3/4" creamy brown head. Retention was good, and the head eventually left some spotty lacing on the glass. 
S= Naturally this was served a bit too cold, so it took a while for the aromas to open up. Eventually I found a complex yet somewhat subdued profile of chocolate, dark ripe fruits, some roasted malts, sherry, and a surprisingly large hop presence. 
T= From front to back, this was one complex and satisfying beer. The huge sweet malt base started this one off in a good way with a heady blend of flavors such as dark fruits (cherries, raisins), treacle, brown sugar, and molasses. The middle was completely dominated by a surprising hop bitterness that seemed out of character in this beer, yet worked well with the other flavors. Following on the heels of the hops was a bitter one-two punch of dark chocolate and roasted coffee notes. The finish dried a bit and left a pleasant alcohol spiciness on my tongue and warmth in my belly. Each sip begged the next to follow. 
MF= This is a big full-bodied brew. Mouth feel was viscous without being syrupy. Carbonation was adequate to carry the heavy load, yet soft and creamy on the tongue. 
D= Though I cannot say that this has toppled my favorite beers in this style, it was a real joy to drink. I found this beer to be all about the matchup of complexity vs. subtlety. It was sweet without being cloying, bitter without being too dry, high alcohol but not too hot or astringent. A great beer and one I will gladly drink again! 1,647 charactersspointon, Nov 06, 2008

Aroma is mainly awful, smells mainly of socks and super citrusy hops, no malt complexity. Flavor, however, is different and quite complex. Fully flavored with an incredible malt complexity. Sweet dark fruits, with layers of chocolate, roast and coffee character. Nice mouth feel. Very nice Imperial Stout. 406 charactersCrosling, Nov 06, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Release night at the Bavarian Lodge. 11oz pour arrives a deep jet black with an inch of creamy head and some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas start with deeply roasted dark malts colliding with chocolate cream. Mellow coffee moves into some dark fruits and hops.
First sip brings a big roasty dark maltiness upfront with notes of sweet milk chocolate, roasted coffee and some dark fruit edges. There's a smooth creaminess here as it flows down. The hops kick in on the finish and become quite noticeable with a good bitterness. The malts win in the end though, leaving a sweet aftertaste and a slight stickiness on the palate. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mellow carbonation. Not nearly as thick as many imperial stout's at this ABV, but that makes it somewhat more drinkable as well. While this isn't my favorite RIS, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and the fact that it's quite hoppy as well. Glad I got a chance to sample this on tap. 945 charactersorbitalr0x, Nov 06, 2008

4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thick, black, oily, viscous, this beer truly deserves its name. A dense, mocha-colored vibrant head adds considerable life and beauty to the appearance of this beer, which is absolutely exceptional.
Seductively aromatic. I imagine that if the finest velvet had an aroma it could well be this beer. Nutty, chocolaty, with dried fruits (notably cherry) and rich creamy notes. Amazingly complex and well-balanced, even for a russian imperial stout.
Exquisite and luxurious. Rich malted notes contrast wonderfully with the mild hop bitterness coming through. While fruitier than most imperial stouts it is not pointedly so, like Bell's Expedition Stout for example. Raisins, sherry, cream, cinnamon, the flavors come in waves and continue to reveal themselves. 
The body is extraordinarily well-rounded and deep. Thick, smooth, and sumptuous the mouthfeel is truly exemplary. A long, lasting, and richly clinging finish is a fine finish to this highly drinkable stout. While I don't doubt that there are betters beers and that I have many comparably favored beers left to discover I have yet to come across a beer this refined and enjoyable. 1,140 charactersDuffman, Nov 06, 2008

S: Nice roasty malt notes with a slight hops aroma. just a touch of coffee.
T: Great roasty malt flavor with creamy dark chocolate taste. Sweeter then anticipated but very good. It also has a nice coffee flavor.
MF/D: Very thick with a low carb on it. Low alcohol taste, not much of an alcohol presence for the 10.3% ABV. As hearty and thick as this beer is I would not call it a sipper, you could drink this beer like it was 5% ABV.
One of the best beers that has ever crossed my lips. I wish they would brew this year round. 653 characterstuo, Nov 06, 2008

S- On the nose I get immense notes of chocolate, coffee, cream, some nice dark fruit, a bit of sweet graham cracker, as well as a nice hoppiness.
T- Starts out with a luxurious thick smooth creamy chocolate with a great hop presence but it is extremely well balanced. I also get notes of coffee, cream, butterscotch, and graham cracker. The finish seems to go on and on with some residual sweetness.
M- By far the thickest feeling beer I have ever had. NO carbonation and ultra thick.
D- This is of course high alcohol but for a Russian Impy, this goes down WAY to smooth. Very drinkable for what it is. 739 charactersGreggy, Nov 05, 2008

A-Deep brown head with low retention. Deep black and opaque beer. Moderate lacing.
S-Complex. A deep maltiness, roasted. Some dark-fruitiness esters. Also some alcoholic tones.
T-Instantly dark fruits greeted by a lingering alcoholic warmth and flavor. The fruitiness, though dark, tastes light on the palate. Deep chocolatiness comes throughn, with some roasty and coffee-like malts. Bitterness is dwarfed by the monstrous malt, but present.
M-An automatic warmth with this high ABV brew. Thick and full bodied, but velvety in my mouth. Low carbonation. A persistent lingering warmth makes this brew ideal for a cool fall evening.
D-Drinkability on a beer like this is difficult. It's easy to drink, and I'll have another in the future, but I'd be hard-pressed to drink a couple pours of this in a sitting. It's an enjoyable beer all-around, and I'll certainly keep my eyes open for this on-tap while it lasts. 981 charactersCHSLBrew, Nov 05, 2008

One of, if not the most hoppy Imperial Stouts I've had (which for me is not a bad thing). I would even go as far to call this a dark IPA! Had a light alcohol finish. Nice smooth and easy drinking body.

4.95/5  rDev +12%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I waited in line for 5 hours for a few bottles of this years release. I had never tried it before but had heard lots of great things about it. I'm a big fan of the other Surly products so I had to try this one. I questioned if it could really live up to the hype, but had to find out for myself.
 Appearance: The appearance is as black as black can be. The only bit of color it has it the dark tan head. 
 Smell: The first bit of aroma I smelled was all hops. I expected roasted malt but was hit with hops first. Wonderful, delicious hops. Upon my second whiff...the dry roasted dark malt characteristic I expected of a stout came through the hops. Next was hints of vanilla and maybe some cherry.
 Taste: At first the taste was much more subtle than I expected. I was expecting it to be either really dry or really sweet. I found it to be a nice balance between the two. The sweet malt had hints of dark cherry and chocolate. If finished with a sharp dry hop finish. The alcohol taste was not overpowering at all.
 Mouthfeel: I think the mouthfeel of this beer maybe the most unique I have ever experienced. It was truly thick and creamy. Had relatively low carbonation, which was perfect. It did seem to have a very slight chalkiness to it when swallowing ,but was not noticeable enough to be a negative.
 Drinkability: This is definitely the most drinkable RIS I have ever had. The smooth, creamy mouthfeel was like velvet. The alcohol was not overpowering, maybe even understated (hard to believe with 10+ ABV). 
 This beer is Great. No doubt about it. It has some very complex characteristics. With each sip you get a different taste. Cherry, vanilla, chocolate, coffee...and hops. 1,692 charactersgratefulstu, Nov 03, 2008

2008 release
APPEARANCE: Pours deep black with a small, dark tan head. It drops to a medium collar with a few bubbles swimming around the surface.
SMELL: Definitely an aggressive, citrusy hop character. Behind it is what you'd expect from a stout like this - deep roastiness and some dark chocolate. The hops really take the forefront and try to block everything else out. Any alcohol smell is minimal.
TASTE: Hits up front with a tremendous sweetness. Big on chocolate with some licorice behind. In a mirror of the aroma, the hops are now the ones trying to squeeze through but just don't make it. The finish does end with a lingering bitterness however.
MOUTHFEEL: Thick and chewy and only slightly slick. Carbonation is medium to low. Pretty much on point.
DRINKABILITY: By far the most striking thing about the beer is how easy it goes down. The alcohol is near undetectable, and at such a high ABV, dangerous. I had no problem finishing my glass.
What a treat for my 250th review! I'm glad I was able to enjoy this with 2 other BAs who can appreciate this beer just as much. 1,183 charactersjmalex, Nov 02, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4When reviewing beers of this magnitude, I try to ignore the hype behind them as much as possible. However, often they deserve their hype and Darkness definitely earned all of its hype.
A- Pours a very rich, viscous black. A thick fluffy head cascades down to a ring of foam around the glass. The name certainly suits the beer.
S- Wow! There is so much more hoppiness than I would have ever expected in a RIS. Sweet citrusy aromas of grapefuit and orange are accented by mild pine. Malty caramel notes hit the nose after the initial kick of the hops. A slight alcoholic scent and mild vanilla notes are also present.
T- This beer is extremely complex. Its slightly sweeter than I would have anticipated. The sweetess is noted in a citrusy aspect and is partially from the alcohol. Orange and a sweet creamy flavor bring out the best of the "stout part" and the "IPA part" of this beer. A mild pine flavor is noted without overpowering the other subtleties of the beer. Notes of bourbon, molasses, and vanilla are found in the heavy malty backbone of this wonderful beer. A slightly roasty caramelized sugar flavor is noted in the aftertaste.
M- One of the thickest stouts I've ever had. Its almost syrupy, while maintaining a good level of carbonation. The finish is sweet an lingering, yet has a nice crispness as well.
D- You need to sip on this one, but it is all things dark combined in this absolutely incredible brew. 1,427 charactersJoeMayo, Nov 02, 2008

Pours pitch black with a small head, it would be more but the sever poured very gently. Leaves a good tan lacing all the way down the glass. It smells sweet, and of roasted and burnt malts, maybe even a little maple syrup. Taste is out the window, this thing taste too good to describe. It taste like it looks and smells, great. Chewy and smooth, it warms you as soon as it crosses your lips. This beer is a must for anyone who lives or is in the twin cities area, amazing, purely amazing. 651 charactersFatduck, Nov 01, 2008
4.66/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle art looks like a D&D handbook from 1983. Maybe a zine from some kids who really, really like the old Heavy Metal books. Not to say that this kind of stuff affects my review, but already this RIS takes a distant fourth behind Kate, Abyss, and Dark Lord (which at least looks like a Magic: The Gathering card). 
Pours brilliantly into a long-stemmed chalice, though. Perfectly opaque blackness (like the soul of a really evil dude) with an amazingly large and retentive head.
I was told that this was the hopheaviest of all American RISes, and even with the glass two and a half feet away from my face right now I can smell some firm, dry hops. Closer to my face, the beer smells strong and gigantically raw. Maybe this should have been left to age for a few months? (I *will* try another in early 09, and update if necessary.) Anyhow, there's an alcohol burn in there, nodes of thick red wine, tons of ultrasweet malt. Espressoish, fresh cacao, with some hints of vanilla. Really nice, lots of complexity, but the alcohol strength is just a wee bit overwhelming and it'll probably only get better with age.
Tastes perfect. Just perfect. The hoppiness is what jumps out at you, since it's so unexpected. It does such a great job of complimenting the beer's huge sweetness that it almost seems to be a part of a the sweentess. Can this be? Can black be a part of white? Can love be a part of hate? Of course. I guess. 
The overall effect is less like a traditional Impy stout and more like some kind of combination of deliciously harsh alcohol and a mocha cappuccino with like ten shots of espresso in it. 
You know what it's like? It's like Big League Chew. It doens't taste anything like the gum, no, but it's similar to it in that it just tastes too good that you don't let yourself enjoy it properly. I always swallow Big League Chew, since it tastes so good for some weird reason I want to swallow, and then I get a stomach ache. No stomach ache, here, but it's been like 7 sips and I still am slurping it down, unable by the force of this strange compulsion to hold this in my mouth long enough to savor it. I want to consume it. I want to pound this like chocolate milk. 
The body is creamy, thick and fizzy. Never quite come across a body like this in a bottled beer. Delicious. Tastes like something that could be healthy. I--if I didn't know this had alcohol in it I could almost see myself giving it to a kid. 2,430 charactersmynie, Oct 29, 2008

This brew pours into my official Darkness Snifter...a huge black body with a massive tan head. The head has amazing retention. But what does this beast smell like?
The smell is very sweet, boozy, and a slight woody smell. It is very very intriguing! It is very rich and complex and not at all hoppy IMO
I'm almost am afraid to try this. I'd hate for it to be a let down but also for it to ruin my guts! Fuck it...lets try it!!! Wow, my god. Its rich and sweet but not boozy. Its incrediably smooth! I cant believe its that drinkable! Holy hell! I must try more! It has a very nice cherry, plum, and slight vanilla flavor! Man this is good!
Its very drinkable and very dangerious! If possible I would drink this all the time! Now I only wonder what my 07 taste like??? 903 charactersiconoklaztor, Oct 29, 2008
3.2/5  rDev -27.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Going to the 2008 Darkness release last weekend I went on a mission to taste one of the best beers I would have had to date. That definitely happened, but unfortunately it wasn't Darkness. After finally being let in the brewery at 12pm, we were able to get our Darkness quickly- a kudos to all at Surly for making this process very easy, enjoyable, and fun. You can tell they actually care about their customers. After getting my bottles, there was plenty of more fun to be had, and Surly was offering a wide variety of other styles to be tasted, including a Coffee Bender and T-Bag Furious. The latter was without a doubt, one of the most interesting, great tasting beers I have had to date. My only complaint is that I couldn't take 6 bottles of this wonderful brew home so I could properly review it! Anyway, after I got back home I could not wait to taste one of my Darkness bottles, and admittedly my expectations were high especially after tasting many great inventive flavors of theirs. So I pulled out 2 Darkness Snifter Glasses and poured them generously with Darkness for my Dad and myself. And here's what I thought...
Appearance- As you would expect from its namesake, out of the bottle came a viscous, jet black stream, almost as if they were to make chocolate milk using exclusively 90% pure cocoa dark chocolate. However it was not as thick as the "motor oil" a reporter on T.V. had described it. This then supported a beautiful, coffee colored head that had a creaminess I really enjoy. All in all it was extremely inviting.
Smell- The smell definitely served to build on the impressions from the pour, and to me this was the best part of the beer. I got an awesome aroma with a heavy mix of chocolate, coffee, Dark molasses, and cherries. There was an interesting level of hops aroma too that I wasn't expecting. Everything came together great and let you know that, "Hey, I'm a BIG beer."
Taste- As I brought the glass to my lips I took a generous sip and whoooa... I was getting a great coffee, dark chocolate, toasted malt, and even substantial hops flavor, when it came on slow but started to get louder and stronger until... SWWEEET!!! In rushed a tidal-wave of molasses, maraschino cherry, and syrupy flavors that seemed to overtake everything. The more bitter flavors previously described were still present, trying to fight back, but to me were simply no match for the sweetness army that was launching wave after wave of attack on my taste buds. This became stronger as i continued to drink, until by the end of my glass I could only describe this beer as sweet. It seemed as though the Devil was actually a very sweet man indeed. However do not be fooled! The ABV is hidden remarkably well and sneaks up on you. My dad and I split the bottle and both of us could definitely feel its strength.
Mouthfeel & Drinkability- Although the mouthfeel lends itself to the beer as a whole (smooth and silky) I can't say this is an extremely "drinkable" beer. This is considering if you define drinkable as a beer you could have one after another of while still really enjoying it, which I do. The multitude of ingredients, flavors, and really -sweetness-, would keep most from consuming more than one 750ml bottle by themselves. And to be totally fair I don't think it's really supposed to. I think I would actually enjoy this beer more if it had been released in a 12oz bottle, enough to experience it's great complexity, but not be overpowered by it.
In the end this is a beer that everyone should have the chance to try. It definitely pushes the envelope of beer, at least for me, but can be very overpowering. Surly makes some wonderfully inventive and downright delicious beer, but this is not one of my faves. 3,736 charactersStoutSlayer, Oct 28, 2008
3.03/5  rDev -31.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Had a pint of this on the Friday night (10/24/08) before the actual bottle release at Stub & Herbs. After gorging on Surly Coffee Bender all night, I didn't really enjoy my glass of Darkness. Hoping this was just due to the fact that Coffee Bender is gods gift to man and any beer following it, probably isn't going to be that great. So I tried it the night of the release with my buddy after sleeping off the buzz from the morning and afternoon festivities. Drank from my brand spanking new Darkness snifter.
2008 Edition.
Appearance- Glugs a jet black hue that allows zero light to permeate any part of the beer. Fairly decent one finger dark brownish tan head forms leaving a small creamy cap and collar with loads of sticky lacing. Thickest beer I've seen since Dark Lord.
Smell- Tons of well roasted malt give a burnt perception that lends to the copious amounts of coffee and bakers chocolate that jump out of the glass. Tinges of light alder smoke and dark fruits (prunes, raisins and even dark cherries) are detectable as the hoppyness of this Imperial Stout is taken to a whole new level. A definite sweetness in the form of dark toffee and caramel and even some murky black molasses. So much going on in here I think you can pretty much smell whatever you want.
Taste- Ohhh... The aforementioned sweetness in the nose really starts out strong. The burnt coffee and baker's chocolate are muted a bit but still present. Corn Syrup, caramel and dark brown sugar give way to a more earthy molasses before my tongue is destroyed by the hops. Full of raw pine and lemon grass that produces a very herbal hop bitterness that tries to cut the sweetness. Fail. Dark cherries and perhaps even a touch of vanilla finishes the beer along with a very cloying sweetness. The alcohol is covered super well though.
Mouthfeel- Very thick and viscous with nice smooth creamy feel. The carbonation is light and prickly and very nice.
Drinkability- Overall I can definitely see the reason why people love this brew. It's very unique and I haven't tasted anything like this before but it's just not for me. I don't mind a little sweetness in a nice big brew but I think Darkness is just plain cloying and hard to drink. This is all very disappointing too because the nose is pretty inviting and I've been waiting quite some time to sample this. Not Surly's best beer but glad to have to opportunity to try anyways! 2,405 charactersyounger35, Oct 27, 2008
4.88/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 release.
Like Travloh, I couldn't wait. My friends and I waited in line for this and the reward needed to be immediate! Drank it tonight as an after-dinner sipper.
I let the bottle warm up a bit from the fridge cut open that wax, and served it in goblets.
A: A wonderful example of an RIS. It poured well and left a caramel covered head that soon settled. It was pitch black, I held it up to a light and squinted and could see nothing. The foam left no rings as it was drunk, it slowly settled back into the beer.
S: The first thing we smelled as we opened it was a strong, sweet molasses smell, combined with a fruit note. It was overpowering the other smells, but as we let it breathe, I got the chocolate smell as well. The only reason it's a 4.5 is because the sweet smell was overpowering for quite a while.
T: Great. This was aggressive, but very well balanced. The dark coffee/chocolate flavors of the malt, highlighted by a sweet molasses/fruit taste. Hops were present but well integrated into the flavor. A LOT of flavor profiles I can't even begin to describe, but I can say, it's a lot more complex, and dare I say better than the Bourbon County Stouts and Old Rasputins I've had recently in preparation.
M: Very smooth. GD Yeti was very thick and oily feeling to me, and while Darkness felt substantial, it was very smooth to drink. The best sensation of all is the warmth you feel in your throat and chest after drinking, the similar feeling I get after drinking a liquor like scotch. Very nice warmer on the coldest day of the year so far in Minnesota.
VERY smooth to drink, which leads me to...
D: I can see why people are warned on Surly's site. The ABV creeps up on you. The beer is so enjoyable, and the flavors mask the alcohol so well, that you can sip for quite a while.
I was worried I wouldn't make the cut, but was #617. I was worried the beer was overhyped, but it's not. This is incredible. I wish I had sprung for the 6 bottles instead of the 4 I bought, but hopefully someone else got the chance to enjoy it.
Cheers to whoever the lucky party is! 2,090 charactersaccordselux, Oct 27, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42008 release.
Pours a VERY thick black color into a Darkness glass. Nice, thick and creamy chocolate milk head springs to life that fades rather quickly but leaves some lovely sheets of lacing. A quick swirl of the glass sees the return of dark tan foam. This brew is so dark, light cannot be seen through it, even at the edges. Darkness is right.
Aroma is unbelievable. Dark chocolate, booze, cherries, coffee, burnt caramel. Roasty, toasty, and inviting on this cold Minnesota night.
Taste is unlike any RIS I've ever had. Incredibly sweet, plenty of chocolate, and the biggest hop presence of any beer of this style I've yet to come across. The hop bitterness is surprising for this style, but a welcome treat for this hop-head. Cherry flavor shows up. It's almost like a liquid, boozy Cherry Mash candy bar mixed with bright citrus hop oils and bitter roasted coffee beans, although the coffee flavors are not as prevalent as I expected. 
Mouthfeel is thick and creamy like no other. It almost has a melted chocolate milkshake consistency, smooth, silky, heartwarming.
The high ABV makes itself known in the nose but is well hidden on the tongue. It can also be felt in the head as the bottle slowly fills the glass and then makes it's way into my happy belly. Despite the high ABV, it's highly drinkable and dangerously so. 
I don't know if it's just the hype or if it's because I'm proud of the best (IMO) brewery in my state, but this is quite possibly the best RIS ever made, or at least better than any that's come across these lips. I'm just going to have to be patient with the aging of another bottle until next year, as it will be hard to keep myself from drinking more. 
Surly, you've made us proud. And it was well worth the wait. 1,752 charactersKeefD, Oct 27, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was able to make it a little over 24 hours without doing it. On this cold October night I just cannot resist. I must. Halloween approaches and the dark bottle with satan on the label beckons...I give in to sin...
 I slice the wax top and pop the top. The first thing I get with a hearty whiff of the cap is chocolate. Rich, dark, sweet smelling. The pour into the Darkness snifter reveals the nectar of the devil. Temptation. Pure temptation. Black like night.
 That chocolate is of course ever present in the nose, but an orchestra of smells accompanies it. Coffee, brown sugar, cherries, cocoa. Someone call an exorcist, I am nearly possessed.
 The semi aggressive pour produces that delayed storm in the black liquid. The bubbles awaken and energize, and send a frothy head upward that seems to come out of nowhere. It keeps pushing upward to the lip of the glass and halts. Its dark, of course, but it has a yellowish twinge to it, too. As it ever so slowly recedes it leaves its tracks on the sides of the glass. Lacing on steroids, it would seem.
 The first swallow and my conversion is complete. "Gimme Shelter" by the Rolling Stones plays in the background as my descent into madness hits full stride. Chocolate, cappuccino, sweet bread, cupcakes with frosting. What I imagine a cuban cigar would taste like, only better. The stuff the devil offers you in Hell's waiting room. The second sip reveals more. A tangyness on the tongue, almost makes it numb. Then the alcohol kicks in to remind you this is still beer. I am under the spell of Darkness...
 Why did I stand in line and pay $100 for 6 of these? One sip tells me that I would have paid $200. I wish I had 6 more. 
 This stuff is so good it truly is sinful. All Hail Darkness... 1,752 characterstravloh, Oct 27, 2008

A: Black wih a beautiful fluffy white head that fades and clings to the glass all the way down.
S: Chocolate, and coffee, you get the roasted malts of a stout with some cherries, but a really nice hop fruity spiciness
T/M: Mouthfeel is wonderful, smooth and creamy. The thing about Darkness is that for a RIS, everything is so clean, so crisp, so drinkable, yet loaded with flavor. Starts off with the dark chocolate fading to cherry liquor, and a nice dose of hop spiciness comes through right at the end, just enough so you know it's there and balances the beer perfectly 634 charactersejquin, Oct 26, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 bottle #445. Shared with two other BA's recently. Poured into a Samilchlaus glass...off the charts black black pour with a snickers nougat colored head. And a little one that reduced to a shiny film atop the dark liquid. A somewhat winey aroma with a dash of chocolate pudding.
I was surprised to taste that the hops 'still' had so much flavor. Thick and viscous in body, sticky hop and plumy chocolate. The bitter hops and bitter chocolate played so nicely together. The image of chocolate raisins dipped in hop lava kept racing through my brain as I slowly enjoyed this. My mouth filled with fumes of phenol and lovely hops. Definitely full bodied and full figured yet not cloying at all. Sticky, resinous hoppy finish that seemed to never end. Crazy drinkable...I could have enjoyed all of the 750mLs myself in 1 setting. 829 charactersRustyDiamond, Oct 22, 2008
4.12/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle Number 172, 2nd RB Tucson Tasting, Sampled September 2008
This beer pours with a frothy, thick textured, light brown colored head and is quite pitch black in color. The aroma has notes of chocolate and cocoa up front, but quickly gets to notes of dark roast and lightly acidic coffee. It has a lightly smoky aroma to it that is almost peat like at times and there is a roast plum fruitiness to it. This does not have as sweet / rich a malt base character to the aroma as I expected. This has a nice grain character that takes on umami laden notes that are a touch like teriyaki, but there is also some subtle licorice and mint notes. The roast character is definitely dominant in the nose, but there is other stuff going on that makes this quite the intriguing beer to be smelling.
As this beer first hits my tongue it feels very thick, chewy and is more sweet than the aroma suggested, but it is still roast malt dominated. There are flavors of coffee, bitter cocoa and burnt grain bitterness that lingers on in the finish with the amply bitter hop notes. Concentrated umami notes in the flavor of rich malt character and some notes that are picked up of a rich, savory, almost salty-smoke character as well as some flavors of burnt, dried plum.
This is subtle complex and it really grew on me as I worked my way through the beer; there is definitely lots of things going on in this beer and it is one of the better Imperial Stouts I have had in a while. 1,464 charactersGueuzedude, Oct 14, 2008
2.29/5  rDev -48.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 1Appearance: 2007 vintage, bottle #263, and what an awesome bottle it is; great packaging here. The beer itself has a pitch black body with two fingers of thick brown froth. Rings of lace cling to the rim of the glass as the head slowly falls. Off to a good start.
Smell: Smoky, meaty, a bit burnt actually. Make that burnt sugar. Citrusy hops are still noticeable despite the age of the bottle, almost a year at this point. This must have been a beast when it was fresh. There's an undercurrent of molasses that's fairly pleasant, but this is somewhat rough on the whole.
Taste & mouthfeel: Molasses, charcoal, pervasive roasty bitterness. There's a spiciness that appears mid-sip, bringing to mind anise or fennel. Thick as hell; this is like drinking a pint of whole milk. Whole milk that someone tossed a piece of charcoal into, that is. The finish is charred and extremely hoppy for the style, with a lingering, somewhat acrid aftertaste that sticks to the tongue even after you've brushed your teeth and gargled with mouthwash. This is certainly complex, but I can't say that I'd ever want to drink it again.
Drinkability: Interesting stuff, but finishing an entire glass is a chore.
Notes: My least favorite beer from Surly so far, I'm sorry to say. It's unique, and possibly even worth trying given the chance, but it's not worth all the hoopla. 1,356 characterslargadeer, Oct 01, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I just recieved this one in a trade today, and was pretty excited to try/and review this very hyped brew from Surly Brewing Company.
This is a 2007 vintage that has been cellared/aged for one year since its original release on halloween of last year. Served at about 60 degree fahrenheit ambiant temperature. Slightly chilled in my trusty fridge and given time to settle so that the yeast has redistributed itself to the brown glass bottle floor.
P=5: The Blood red and black ink double wax dipped 750ml (Nice, those extra ounces come in handy, and I often wish more breweries would bottle in 750ml bombers as opposed to 22oz [660ml] bombers) bomber bottle is very cool looking indeed. Sturdy brown glass with a bitchin' label with the surly logo and a grim reaper on it. The bottle states that this is bottle # 264 although there is no further information about the beer stated except for the bottle size (750ml)
A=5: With a hard pour into a 20oz Imperial Pint Glass this beer is a real beauty to behold. Ink black with no light penetration and a massive espresso coloured head of foam that lasts and lasts with excellent retention, sheeting, and lacing
S=5: When I cracked the top off of this the smell instantly penetrated my nasal cavity. Deep rosated malts, dark russian rye bread, chocolate, dark black unsweetened coffee, condensed milk, earthy green hops, and a melange of other 'dark' flavors
T=4.5: The taste is awesome and smooth as hell. A great blend of green earthy hops, fresh russian rye bread, chocolate syrup/chocolate milk, toffee, with a bit of coffee, vanilla, sweet condensed milk and caramel thrown in for good measure. The yeast is a nice one here with some very English buttery undertones and the front palate and back palate combine nicely to make this a real cigar sipper of a brew. The burnt coffee, and dark fruit/currant flavors really build up when this one warms up to room temperature. I am now beginning to see that the hype is justified. However, the taste profile is not quite Courage 83' or 2004 Dark Lord. Perhaps it's a bit better, fresh, on tap, or on cask, or maybe even from a can [one can wish]. However, this is near perfect for a russian imperial stout. Alcohol is muted and melded, but it makes itself known in the intense, acrid dry finish. Kind of like day old cold pressed espresso discards
M=5: The mouthfeel is extremely satisfying. Thick, chewy, and coating with an exponential warmth about it as well. However it is not quite the beast in the mouth that dark lord is. It could be a bit thicker with more mid body depth, if I am to be completely honest. Still, thick and rich, this is the epitome of a great imperial stout
D=5: This is where this one really shines. This is a big RIS for sure, but the flavors are melded together very well and in the end the drinkability is really excellent for a 10%+ abv brew. Th e fantastic aroma, interesting flavor profile, and satisfying mouthfeel really all pull together to make this a greatly drinkable RIS.
O=4.9: Overall this is pretty much a 4.9 brew. It is one inch away from a 5 in either taste or mouthfeel and it really fires on all cylinders. I can't wait to try this fresh, as even though I did not sample the 2007 batch fresh in the bottle, on tap, or on cask, I can tell that the hop flavors have been somewhat muted and mellowed, and the mouthfeel may have thinned a bit as well. I can see this being a 5 under the right circumstances, and I may have to take the flight over to MN this halloween to find out for myself. 
PC: Surly is probably my favorite new brewery (I only discovered them earlier this year). They make interesting limited seasonals like this (as well as One, Two, etc), Great regular seasonals (such as Cynic, Fest, Bitter Brewer, etc), and killer year round brews (such as furious and bender). I look forward to trying more of their beer be it in cans, bottles, on tap, or on cask. I also look forward to trying the Smoke and some of their more obscure tap/cask only products. Whilst hardly life changing, or the best beer that I have ever had, this is an incredibly solid product, and considering that this brewery has only been open for a few years they really have quite the winner here. I look forward to toasting them on many occasions in the future. In the meantime a BIG thanks to Akorsak for hooking me up with this beauty. The check (or the cable car) will be in the mail this week.
This brew really reminded me why I love Russian Imperial Stouts so much...Probably my all time #3 Imperial Stout after 2004 Dark Lord and 1983 Courage Russian Imperial 4,596 charactersfrancisweizen, Sep 24, 2008
4.29/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4One of the triumpherant of Imperial Stouts highly rated enough to appear in the BA top 10. Sampled at the recent Tampa BA gathering, thansk to whoever brought it.
Pours jet black with a light hocolate-colored head. A small ring of foam clings to the sides of the glass. Has a very perfumy aroma. Roast malt, chocolate, alcohol, coffee, and dark fruit (cherry) all evident. Has a thick and viscous mouthfeel. Flavor has a blend of cocoa, raisins, and black coffee and roast. I find the roast to be a bit overpowering, as it leaves a tang and slight harshness on the palate.
Overall, certainly a very good RIS, but I found Dark Lord superior to this one. 654 charactersmarksto, Sep 21, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A fantastic beer, which may be worth the hype (I only say may, because the hype is so crazy right now).
Pours a dark black (yes there is such a thing as dark black), with a miniscule brown head. Smell is of vanilla, chocolate, hints of coffee (but not overpowering), malt sweetness and milk.
Taste is a concentrated version of the smell. The mouthfeel is thick and the beer definitely coates the glass well.
Recommended. 423 charactersjwolfie70, Sep 18, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5THIS IS FOR THE '07 VERSION. I WOULD NOT GIVE A PERFECT SCORE TO THE '08, AND I HAVEN'T TRIED THE '09 YET.
How do you review a beer like this? With so many positive reviews, anything you say is going to seem like "piling on", or "following the herd." That being said, this is one of the two or three finest beers I've ever had.
Pours quite black, even when held to the light. Large dark tan foam head (surpisingly large given the ABV). Aggressive chocolate, vanilla, and roasted aromes with a shocking amount of piney hoppiness.
Taste is more chocolate, crazy vanilla, dark fruit/plums?/raisins?/figs?/berries?. Maybe a slight bit of burnt coffee. Also, a balancing amount of earthy hops. This surprised me more than anything else. Sensationally flavorful, rich thick mouthfeel, absolutely sublime. 801 charactersOverlord, Aug 23, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review is from the February 2007 issue of Beeradvocate Magazine.
Only 12 barrels were made, and we've been blessed with a 1/2 gallon, sent directly from the brewery on ice packs. Kickass! 
Aptly named, this is one hell of a black brew. Its dark crown is rich, creamy, tightly formed, and coffee colored. Looks like a freshly frothed coffee. Blackberries, strong sherry, velvety dark chocolate, perfume of soft dried fruits. Thick, viscous, chewy, round, smooth and creamy. Semi-spicy alcohol is caught in the center, surrounded by char and smoke, and grasped by a &#64257; st of sweetness. Malty sweet, but not cloying; molasses, dark brown sugar, charred raisins, juicy, ripe black cherries in a sharp, dark berry middle, and an exotically acrid dark-roasted coffee bite. Hop bitterness rises from the depths, along the sides of the tongue, stabbing at the palate here and there with some leafy and oily notes. Smoky-char linger in the &#64257; nish, with a residual, deep, dark sweetness. Alcohol creeps, lurks and eventually strikes a warming blow to the skull.

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5so this beer is really just a punch in the face. has a strong hop character, whihc is generally what I hear it referred to as why it stands out in the crowd. I disagree but for a slightly different reason. it has a hop character but for an RIS i would definitely not call it dominant (at this age it might have mellowed though its not that old, 2008) but it does have, which is unusual for most RIS's is that it has a solid fruit character which is very solid and very complex. it hits you on the tonuge and doesnt let go.

This is my favorite Surly product - hands down! OMG... this is a brew that will exceed expectations and have you wanting more.
A = A fairly dark and syrupy complexion with blonde hued foamy head that can be refreshed over and over again.
S = A complex blending of deep roasted malts and wonderful citrus and spice components. The citrus is more of blood orange and tangerine which works well with the dark chocolate texture.
T = Wow... pure velvet smoothness with chocolate, coffee, and a hint of toffee sweetness.
M = A viscous warmer with high ABV, smooth and rich without the "palate shock" tendancies present with some of the other big dark brews on the market.
D = Amazing simply for what it is. Psychologically, you'll want as much as you can get of this highly prized and limited production masterpiece. 
An "A+" rating from the Beerking! 905 charactersBeerking721, Jul 24, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thank you Carlos for opening this one (after so many previous attempts at making this tasting happen!).
Great pour with a great, lasting head on this beauty.
Delicious grapefruit/citrus bitterness is still a large component of this beer, despite the bottle having some age on it. I've had hoppy imperial stouts before (Rogue, Victory, etc), but none that came off so citrusy....an interesting choice and one that I find to work extremely well. Great roast character with complementing dark chocolate and a lingering bitterness. Light alcohol presence on the end. Some dark fruits seem to be present as well - specifically raisins.
Huge body with medium to low carbonation - very suitable. Rich and nicely coating.
Excellent beer. Very unique (and this is not an easy thing to be in the RIS category) with the delicious citric hop presence. I'd take a keg of this ;) 869 charactersrallison, Jul 23, 2008
4.18/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Floydster for helping me out with a bottle of this rare beer. Split this bottle last night with a few good friends (Joey, Ryan, Tony +1). The bottle number had mostly rubbed off during shipping, I think there is a 1 and a 6. 2007 release.
Not the darkest stout I've seen but the beauty was in the inch+ of head, the excellent retention and lacing. Soapy spider legs on the sides of the glass (Surly pint glass of course!)
The beer has an impressive roasted aroma, not overdone which I like, and also has a pronounced bitterness. The bitterness is both in a roasted/smokey type and also the citrus hops which are fading into the background. As the beer warmed up there was more caramel, cocoa, and chocolate.
The taste was a little more complex than the aroma (probably because this one has been sitting for a few months already). First I get the roasted malts, dark fruits (dates, raisins), some brown sugar; then I start getting more heavily roasted flavors in the form of burnt malts. There is some coffee and chocolate near the finish and anise in the aftertaste. The hops come in near the end with some earthiness and a bit of citrus bitterness.
The mouthfeel of this beast was probably what impressed me the most, really smooth and silky. The beer just felt graceful on the palate. For such a high abv. stout monster, this beer really drinks well.
I hope to get a fresh bottle of this at the next release because I think that I might have missed some of the hop essence that makes this beer grand. 1,522 charactersseaoflament, Jul 20, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle #230. Pours black with a good size dark tan, light brown head that recedes slowly, with just a bit of lacing. Aroma is very citrusy and hoppy, oranges and tangerines, like a citrusy cotton candy. Some roasty, smoky and chocolatey notes as well, these are in the background but work extremely well with the hoppiness in the foreground. Taste is very similar to the aroma with the citrusy hops being the main player, but a very nice roasty and at times, rich chocolatey maltiness in the background. The flavors work very well together and alternate back and forth. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, very soft and full feeling, creamy carbonation is soft on the tongue, some light tingling and a bit of dryness towards the end from the hoppiness. Really, an outstanding and unique beer. I've had hoppy imperial stouts before, but this particular combination works very well together. Tastes as though it will continue to age very well, though it is extremely drinkable at present. 988 charactershoppymeal, Jun 26, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What can I say really about this whole situation. I was lucky enough to acquire this bottle through a very fair trade from a good friend. When I see how much these things go for and the hype surrounding it, it is hard for me to justify it sometimes. I have found several instances where these beers are just complete letdowns. This here was not the case. It was absolutely wonderful and I really think it is worth its reputation. That being said, I new this would be the only bottle I would get so I saved it for a very special occasion and split it with a good friend at Barley's last night for my 30th Birthday. I figured it would be a fitting place, fitting time, and fitting company to open such a rare and sought after treat. Served in multiple sampling glasses at various temperatures up to room temp, this was definitely a wonderful experience. Bottle # 295.
Appearance - So we finally get to pour this one out. Opened the double dipped, wax topped cap and pour out this black as night liquid. Deep dark notes of black, to which no light could penetrate dropped into the glass with each tip. A mushrooming head of tan foam then came up over the top, reaching a height of at least two fingers before starting to break up into a rocky and cratered field. Even at its lowest mark it still carried about a fingers depth of lace with it and the side glass webbing was extremely nice. Overall this was a monster looking beer, however I cannot say it was a five, only because I have seen Dark Lord and the Abyss offer me a slightly fuller poor.
Smell - The aroma was to die for, literally. Everyone of these big RIS are much different then the one before, and everyone one is so unique, but I think once you take a whiff of this one it becomes very clear that this is in a whole different category. Gone are you rum soaked dark fruit and bourbon barrel, oak infused aromas, this was an entirely different beast. Rich and very sweet cocoa aromas are bringing themselves up to greet you first, with a gentle nudge of alcohol underneath. Wonderfully rich coffee then comes in to deliver the next blow. It was more of a roasted coffee bean aroma to be honest, like when you first open up that drawer at starbucks. A veritable assault of floral hops then comes out of nowhere. Grapefruit and pineapple hints mixing in with molasses and vanilla, what was this. As it warmed that sweet and creamy chocolate and coffee just really stole the show, with drops of vanilla just making this one drip with sweetness.
Taste - Now, we dive in to get a taste of what this wonderful liquid could be hiding. The first thing you notice is uber sweet chocolate and coffee. Just that wonderful taste that you want to have in a big stout, but the second that you get used to it, it gets cut like a knife, infused with grapefruit and orange peel. Puckering the lips as fresh grass and lemon hints seal it up and dry the mouth instantly before falling down the back of your through and opening up the scarred taste buds to welcome rush of vanilla. Beautifully complex, the rich notes of smoke and molasses intermingle and marry a wonderful peat like darkness that just sits there for a second before it too passes, getting whisked away and leaving behind only the faintest hint of grapefruit like bitterness soaked in vanilla and coffee. A wonderful voyage of unexpected tastes and bright surprises, wit ha virtually hidden alcohol content that makes it oh so smooth.
Mouthfeel - An speaking of smooth, wow, this was one smooth stout. A little bit less full then the rest of the big boys, but again this was a different type of monster, something entirely different then you milk shake like consistency you would typically associate with the style. This had a light, more carbonated feel to it. A much drier beer, especially in the finish, the flavors exploded out of it more then soaked in and sat there. As it warmed up it really did get a good deal thicker, but still stuck to its roots, setting it apart from the heard.
Drinkability - As for an almost 11% ABV Russian Imperial Stout, this was something I could have drank all night long. It was just tremendous in its complexity with a unrivaled smoothness. The alcohol was nowhere to be found, and the dry, hoppy finish only encouraged me to go back and try it again, and again, and again. It was a sad moment when this bottle was finished, as I really wanted just a little bit more. It was like beer crack for me, really just that good.
Overall I would have to say this really lived up to the hype for me. It was a phenominal beer, much different then anything I had before it, and was a nice breath of fresh air in the category. I was impressed by the floral hoppiness that was brought into this, especially in the finish as it really hid the alcohol well and let you have a nice, and not super filling experience out of it. Overall would I like another bottle, absolutely! Would I travel to Minnesota to get it, if the wife would let me, in a heartbeat! 4,992 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 13, 2008

Poured into a short glass and allowed to warm slightly. Deep and rich in appearance, black as can be. Beige head with sturdiness and a lacing that lingered throughout the glass.
Aromas of strong coffee flavors intertwined with bittersweet cocoa goodness - fantastic balance of the two. Hints of some heat )good Rum), dark molasses, and warm spices play in concert. 
Thick and robust on the palate. Absolutely splended in the mouth. Chocolate, coffee and spice in full form, working and playing off one another. Plemty of hops action to add an unsuspecting balance to those who are not ready. Savoring this brew in the mouth brings out additional noted of dark fruits covered in high quality chocolate. Fantastic staying power with these flavors.
Full bodied in every conceivable way. Big, but not in an annoying way. 
IMHO, this is the quintessential Russian Imperial Stout. The balance and variances make this one for the ages. One not only to seek out and savor, but one to celebrate.
I am honored to have been fortunate to had the opportunity.
Thanks, bro. 1,146 charactersgoindownsouth, Jun 11, 2008

Pours dark black with a short lived tan head. Smell is chocolately, some faint cake like sweetness and some really roasty sharp, bitter hops in the nose. Some dryness. Taste is dry, roasty, and very hoppy for the style, and a bit more than I'd like. Somewhat of a meaty, roasty flavor too. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Very good, for sure, with no hint of the ABV, but not my favorite Imperial Stout. 567 charactersJDV, Jun 09, 2008

2nd bottle of Darkness, compliments of RustyDiamond. Bottle 445. Poured black with a thin head that sticks around. Smells of chocolate pudding, roasted cocoa nibs, and with winey notes at the end. The taste was still a bit hot, but with nice long cocoa liquor tastes. Long chocolatey taste with some bitter hop presence. Mouthfeel was super smooth and creamy. A pleasure and I enjoyed it more the second time around. 
***Original Review***
This beer was a treat compliments of Cashew70 at the Brick Store Pub. I had already had Kate the Great, Dark Lord, Speedway, the Abyss, and Ten Fidy among others and I was interested in how this stacked up. I'd previously enjoyed some of Surly's other beers on tap and had high expectations. Definitely a solid beer, but given how unbelievably difficult it is to obtain, I probably won't go to quite those lengths to procure some more, but I'm extremely glad I had a chance to taste it. Like the other great Russian Imperial Stouts, this one pours black as night with a tan head that sticks around. Maybe not quite as thick and rich looking a fresh Ten Fidy on tap, but very nice. The first aromas are of burntt roasted grains, followed by chocolate, coffee, and a nice dark but fresh fruitiness reminiscent of plums. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer is well integrated. The taste is also surprisingly fruity with more of that nice plumminess, big flavors of roasted grains and chocolatey malt, and a tad of soy sauce flavor, as well as a bit of fresh cream. The mouthfeel is not as massive as Dark Lord, or as thick, nor is it as creamy as Ten Fidy, in fact, there is a bit of slickness to to the mouth here. A very good, complex RIS. Not as massive as DL nor as creamy and luscious as Ten Fidy on tap, or as assertive as Speedway, nor as complex as Kate the Great. Stylistically, I would put his somewhere between the winey chameleon-like complexity of Kate the Great, and the massive onslaught of Dark Lord. Forr me it probably takes 4th place behind KTG, DL, and Ten Fidy on tap., but at this level I really think it's probably all about the direction one likes to see a beer go and one's personal taste. 2,169 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jun 03, 2008

This is one I had been chasing for quite sometime. A big thanks goes out to rate beerian ibrew2or3 for sharing this one.
A: First and foremost its one bad ass looking bottle. Pours a deep dark black hue with a nice bubbly one finger head on my pour. There were spots of lacing noted.
S: Nice hoppy aromas right from the start. There were hints of roasted malts and chocolate along with bitter coffee. It had a somewhat green aroma beneath the roast. The ABV makes itself known in the nose as well.
T: This is a hoppy ass stout. Tons of bitter hops noted as soon as it hit my tongue. Beautifully roasted chocolaty malt does come thru as does a hint of vanilla, a nice dose of smoke, and a touch of dark fruit. A slight alcohol burn lingers after each gulp. That being said it don't ever really come together though.
M: Full in body, rich and somewhat syrupy.
D: The beer is sort of sharp on the tongue. I could of had more than my 1/6 of the bottle but this is one to be shared.
Overall: It's a good beer but overall I was a bit let down. I thank ibrew for the chance to try. Would love to get a bottle of my own to age for a bit.

Appearance - pours black and inky, very viscous. It carries a thin mocha head that manages to throw some stray lacing around.
Aroma - sweet at first, darkly roasted malts, and a smoky, meaty aroma. More malt comes through as it settles.
Taste - the malts are chewy and sweet out of the gate, lots of dark fruit and fairly well masked abv heat. Loads of chocolate syrup and espresso fill the mouth after the swallow. Great balancing with the hop/char bitterness. Long finish lets you taste it for a minute or two after it's gone.
Mouthfeel - very smooth, heavy and clingy. 5.0
Drinkability - awfully strong, but a stunning beer and an ideal sipper. 745 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, May 02, 2008

Poured a very dark black color with large bubbling tan head. Very pretty monster indeed.
Smell was rather subtle for surly. Smokey with some dark chocolate, coffee notes. Faint hint of the hoppy character so well played by Surly Brewing.
Taste was a little richer than the aroma with a faint sweet maltiness at the beginning followed by a roasty coffee flavor. Very nice balance on this beer. 
Mouth feel was oily but at the same time there was a creamy lingering feel. Very nice carbonation for my preference on this style. Can't wait for next years. 619 charactersgenog, Apr 29, 2008

4.03/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Cashew70 earns my undying respect for bringing a bottle of this to the now legendary Spring '08 Brick Store tasting. We did a side by side with a 2007 Dark Lord. Never thought I'd get to do that. Thanks, Cashew! 
Pours a very dark black-brown, with a small head comprised of fat bubbles. Sinister to be sure, but nothing we haven't seen before. It absolutely does not stick to the glass like ye ole DL.
Smells surprisingly... hoppy. You have to wait till this warms up a little, but Darkness has a definite hop edge of pine that fights through the strong burnt, charred grain, chocolate and coffee denseness. Oh yes, there's alcohol and some sweet molasses / sugar lurking there too. Darkness certainly smells like a winner, but the only unusual thing here is the level of hops present.
Ahh, now we're talking! Super roasty, and the big (for a RIS) citrus hop bite equates to a bold, brash, wild beer with a lotta punch. The hops are dirty and rough, and it's altogether boozy and heavy. This is the kind of stuff Klingons would drink out of corroded metal canisters while stranded in deep space.
Mouthfeel is slick, heavy and lowly carbonated. Finishes hoppy, roast-bitter and oily sweet. It lacks the cake-batter thickness of it's nemesis from Munster, but it's good even so.
Drinkability? Well, pretty low. This is good, but quite honestly, does not live up to the (unfair) hype. Darkness is quite solid, but there are a lot of great Imperial Stouts coming out of the US and this one is certainly not worth the insane premium it commands. If you have a bottle, count yourself lucky and share with friends. They'll owe you!
Oh yeah, was it better than Dark Lord? No. Dark Lord still holds the tarnished, sickly crown for this sort of thing. 1,748 characterskkipple, Apr 10, 2008

I admit I was a little worried about this beer. Is it over hyped, does it live up to expectations, will this be underwhelming, etc????
Thankfully, this beer meets and exceeds all the hype I've heard. Wow - Poured this into my goblet and it's black with faint dark brown highlights at the edges of your glass if you hold it up to the light. There's a light tan head that's a finger high but dissipates quickly. There's plenty of lacing. 
The aroma is very sweet, malty, and hoppy - all sorts of complexity. I smell and taste chocolate, licorice, malty goodness (roasted) some caramel, coffee, creamy, and dark fruit-ey, - and definitely hops but not in a hop-bomb sort of way.
The mouthfeel - it's a little less syrupy than I'd expect from the aroma, but the body is still medium and full. It's very balanced on the finish - leaving a minor warmth letting you focus on the complexities of flavors.
I truly am impressed. This is one of the great ones, worthy of it's ranking here. Now, I have to go find more!!!! It will be very interesting to see how it cellars. 1,098 charactersbgramer, Apr 04, 2008

Still waiting. This is the best beer I've ever had, period. Exclamation point. Semaphore. Whatever. 
I had my first shortly after its Halloween release, & had the pleasure of consuming three of them that early November night. I've had several since, the latest at Firkin Fest & two short pours at the Acadia Cafe grand re-opening this past Friday. 
Darkness pours black as the heart of Charon with, always, a beautiful but not overwhelming head. Smells like...Darkness. Nothing smells like it. Or tastes like it. Chocolate & beer & malt & all sorts of Russian goodness. After our last my wife commented that she might not brush her teeth for a few days to retain that lingering feel of pure heaven on the back of the tongue. 
Drinkability is ridiculously off the scale for a beer this strong & dark. It is, however, definitely a sipper. I could put away one an hour for, oh, maybe half a day, but that'd be my limit. 
Amazing. I can't wait for my next - I'm hoping there'll be a Darkness pour at the upcoming Happy Gnome dinner in mid-April. That, & my wife and I will be arm-wrestling to see who watches the kids for the anticipated Halloween 2008 release. 1,238 charactersmaximum12, Mar 31, 2008

A - Completely opaque pitch black color. Smooth dark brown head retains at a half inch, its darker around the edge of the glass. Thin sheets of lacing.
S - Dark roasted coffee with sharp piny hops. Dark fruits, cream and light vanilla playin in the background.
T - An oily slick bitterness with a sweet dark roasted maltiness starts out the taste. Dark malts get even darker while a sweet cream contrasts simultaneously. Lots going on here and I probably only skimmed the surface... I need more. 
M - Thick consistency with a good amount of carbonation.
D - Excellent balance of sharp hoppiness and deep roasted maltiness make for a very unique and flavorful experience. More please. 725 charactersumustdrink, Mar 18, 2008

Appearance is black with a thick tan head and continuous bubbly lace. Smells big and hoppy - pine and citrus. Big sweet malt flavor with a little less hop overtone than expected from the smell. Aftertaste is malty with hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel is very syruppy coating your tongue and keeping the sweet maltiness around. Overall, I am not sure. I enjoyed it, but I don't know how much more than a 3 oz pour I would want. Interesting, but needs to age maybe to mellow out. I would love to try it again in 6 months. 622 characterswalshclimb, Mar 16, 2008

A: Solid black with no light penetrating. Dark tan head with some small lacing.
S: Hoppy nose? RIS? Citrus hops right up front on the nose then roast.
T: Bitter, roasted malt in the beginning. Mystery flavor in the middle that no one's able to put their finger on. Its there for only a brief moment but oh, so good. Its kind of a caramel-y burnt sugar, but that's not it exactly. There's a definite boozy appearance but appropriate for the style
M: Heavy bodied, slightly syrupy with a decent amount of carbonation.
D: This ran the RIS gauntlet against aged Stone, aged Avery Czar, and Siberian Night. While an excellent & distinctive RIS, I think much of the hype comes from the limited availability. Don't get me wrong, its REALLY good, but it wasn't the favorite of the night. 904 charactersAvryle, Mar 16, 2008

A: pours viscous, heavy, with a coffee colored head that appears out of nowhere, frothy and attractive, lacing everywhere
S: buttery/nutty creaminess, next alcohol (as it warms) but starts out as banana and strawberry, malt in the middle and back with hops
T: creaminess upfront, hop bitterness in the back, intense roasted malt in the middle, intense dark chocolate, the creaminess rides subtly above everything
M: THICK, lively but subtle carbonation, smooth, terrific
D: intense, but oh so drinkable, definitely worth it 644 characterspheggeseth, Mar 07, 2008

S:I pick up a burnt bacon type smell, which i love. A nice hop nose, but not over powering. Very light coffee bean. Just a tiny hint of a fruity raspberry comes peeking in.
T:A big time smokey coffee pops out right away. Which apparently is where I got the burnt bacon from. A sweet chocolate covered raspberry with just a touch of toffee. The hops pops out and stick around throuhg out the whole sip. 
M:Thick round and fat for a nice warming feeling. Very little carbonation makes it very easy.
D:Great rIS. Very smooth and complex. It seems like the taste comes in layers adding to the complexity. I could easily drink multiple(unfrotunately and fortunately franksandbeans has my other bottle) 814 charactersScoobydank, Mar 04, 2008

A delicious and decadent imperial stout, and yet surprisingly un-complex for the style. Malty, with molasses and chocolate notes. It was utterly lacking in that soy sauce-like quality that can detract from even the best imperial stouts, which made it smooth and drinkable and yet would have to be regarded as a by-product of that lack of complexity. Not the cascade of intensity I associate with the style, but a great beer nonetheless. 555 charactersFlyer, Feb 27, 2008
4.51/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle #194. Thanks to hero27 for the trade.
A monsterous three inch head jumps to the top of the glass with its soft carmel colored thick bubbles. Fades very slowly leaving considerable lace behind. Body is the standard jet black beauty. Nose is shockingly hoppy up front for a big stout with hints of spicey soft malt in the backround. Enters the mouth thick and almost syrupy with a powdery coco feel. A nice balance of grassy mineral based hops quickly kicks in to even out and almost take over the flavor profile. This creates a thick milk chocolate like feel that sits on the back of the tongue followed by a long even bitter hop feel. Although this is more hoppy than what I would usually like in a stout, it is unique and very welcome. Very nicely drinkable. Alchol is well hidden. A great and worthy stout. 816 charactersSPLITGRIN, Feb 21, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Lisalucy and Flyer for obtaining and sharing this bottle with me. This is an impressive beer.
It pours a black color with reddish and purple elements and a thinner-than-expected beige head.
Aroma is malty and surprisingly hoppy with a dominant smoky-molasses aroma. There is also a minimal chocolate smell; like hot chocolate powder. Flavor is a full roasty smokiness on the tip of the tongue and somewhat chocolatey across the top of my tongue. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; and it feels like it would coat the back of a spoon.
This beer was much more drinkable than I expected and other comparable beers like Dark Lord. In all honesty, it tasted to me a lot like a less roasty and more approachable Leinenkugel Big Eddy RIS. Quite good, but I can't say I would stand in line 5 hours for it. 811 charactersBeerBelcher, Feb 09, 2008
4/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at 2007 GABF. Poured by Omar himself.
The beer poured a deep coal black with a nice dark brown head.
The aroma of the beer was full of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and ash. Some tobacco in the aroma as well.
The flavor of the beer was focussed on roasty malts to the point of being slightly ashen. Mid-palate could've used a little more molasses/dark fruit sweetness. The hops seemed slightly citrusy and pretty up front. The finish had a faint tobacco note as well.
The mouthfeel was full, but was not too heavy. It finished pretty dry for a RIS. The carbonation seemed dialed in well. 
This beer is good, but overhyped IMO. There are much better imperial stouts out there that eclipse Darkness in both complexity and drinkability. KtG, DL, and BCS are few that come out ahead IMO. 801 charactersSacoDeToro, Feb 06, 2008

Thanks for sharing this one, drseamus.
I'm not sure this one "poured". It more like gulped from the bottle. Tan head.
The hops surprised me. I don't recall ever smelling a RIS that hoppy. Other tasters commented that it was a Surly smell. But it smells like a Double IPA
A nice malt bitterness sets up the caramel and chocolate. Nice bitter bite.
Dandy mouthfeel. A little dance on the tongue but not too much carbonation.
This is a very nice RIS. It didn't "win the night" when lined up against a few other beers in this category. I'll admit to expecting...more. 577 charactersLittleBreeze, Jan 31, 2008

Pitch black color with a thick espresso brown head. Nice lacing and retention. 
Wow, this stuff has more nose than most bourbon aged stouts. Sweet profile of caramel, black and chocolate malts. Lots of dark fruit with molasses, coffee, and fudge.
Rich burnt and roasted malts with lots of chocolate and coffee. Keeping the sweetness in balance are big earthy floral hops and bitter molasses. 
Thick and chewy yet silky smooth over the palate. Perfect body and carbonation for the flavor profile.
Doesn't get much better than this. Near perfect. Could drink this one all night. 711 charactersrye726, Jan 29, 2008

S: Very citrusy hop aroma is the most prominent aroma. Some roasted malt in the background but not really any chocolate or coffee.
T: Strong roasted bitterness is right up front followed by a quick burst of sweetness, possibly caramel. It fades into a decent chocolate and then bitter aftertaste. Hop presence isn't as strong as it was in the aroma.
M: Thick and heavy. Perfect for a RIS.
D: The hop aroma is out of style for this beer, but is interesting none the less. A bit more chocolate would have been nice but I'll see what happens with age. 619 charactersdrseamus, Jan 27, 2008

A: Pours black with no light getting through. Dark tan head with some lacing.
S: The first thing that strikes you is how hoppy this smells for an IRS. Citrus is very present. After than you get some of the roasted elements.
T:Bitter from the roasted malt at first. There is something at the middle we could not figure out. It lasts about half a second and it is wonderful. We classified it as burnt sugar (Caramel) but I do not know if that accurately depicts what is going on there. There is also a slight alcohol taste but within tolerances for the ABV.
M: Thick body that is slightly syrupy with a good amount of carbonation.
D: Very drinkable for the ABV. This beer was sampled VS some other RIS including Stone, Avery Czar, and Siberian Night and while it is a great beer I do not know if it is worth all of the hype. People at the tasting favored the Stone RIS with a year on it and I favored another with a few more years on it. The super limited availability I am sure has something to do with this. Great beer no doubt just don't mortgage your house to get it. That being said if you can get it reasonably definitely do so. 1,193 charactersaerozeppl, Jan 27, 2008
4.88/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My 2nd bottle from Darkness Day at the Surly brewery, #207.
This pours black as the ace of spades with a nice tan head. It couldn't be any more tempting. Nice lacing on the glass when drinking too.
Smells like dark chocolate and coffee with a slight whiff of hops.
The darkness is all I could want in an imperial stout. The taste is thick with chocolate, rising with a slight bite of hops, and then finishing with a subtle hint of bitter coffee. Mouth feel very well mixed between the smoothness of a stout and the bite of a hoppy beer.
The last bottle was consumed in an imperial stout tasting with some friends; that included: Darkness, Abyss, Speedway Stout, Poseidon, Sam Smith, Rogue, Yeti, Bourbon County, and Old Rasputin. The darkness was my favorite with the Abyss a close second. What really sets the Darkness apart is its unique hop flavors (like other surly beers) and how smoothly integrated all the flavors are making an outstanding beer.
I can't wait for next year! (not to mention all the other great beers from Surly in between) 1,050 charactersgonzogambler, Jan 26, 2008
4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750 ml bottle with both red and black wax covering the cap, acquired in a trade with LeonTrotsky, one of the lucky people in Minnesota to get some of these, thanks a lot for giving me the chance to try this brew, review #475, 2007 vintage
Bottle #35, ironically drank while watching a pretty bad movie called "Darkness," took me about two hours to get through this bottle by myself, but I gave my roommate and girlfriend each about two ounces, took me a while as this is the first beer I have drank in a few weeks and I did not want it to hit me too hard, rather enjoy its distinct taste, less than six hundred were made in this first batch of bottling
Poured into my Dofish Head snifter with a pure black color and a very impressive 3/4 inch foamy mocha head that stuck around for four to five minutes, was not as thick as I would have liked but still not a thin or weak stout by any means, good retention and left sticky light brown lacing along my entire glass, appearance was nice because of the super dark color and creamy texture
Smell was pretty much perfect, dark chocolate, milk, floral hoppiness, several different varieties of fruit including citrus and berries, coffee, sweet cream, oak, wide variety of malty aromas, and a small amount of oatmeal and grains
Taste was great, the first instant of the first sip seemed like it was an india pale ale, it was such a hop bomb right off the bat that I could not believe it was a Russian imperial stout, it reminded more of Stone's 11th Anniversary with its color and taste, this was probably because I was drinking it too cold at first, the dryness of this beer was astonishing though nevertheless, once the hoppy character wore off after a few seconds, I got a lot of burned chocolate and espresso tastes, as it warmed more sweetness came to the surface that consisted of caramel, creaminess, milk chocolate, and some dark fruit, the hoppiness stayed there the whole time though, nice spiciness throughout and crazily smooth, strong oak tastes throughout to go along with the burnt tastes caused by the hoppiness and dark chocolate malt, this beer was very complex and had a lot of different things going on as it continued to get warmer and warmer, by the end it was so easy to drink, and the hops and malt were balanced out so well, very enjoyable overall
Body was thick but I expected it to be even more so, not comparable to Dark Lord in this sense, but that is not a bad thing, great mouthfeel with a perfect amount of carbonation, leaves a nice sensation on the tongue, taste lasted several minutes
Could have drank three bottles of this if I had all day to sit, and drink expensive and rare beer, very very drinkable, alcohol is hidden well and could definitely sneak up on you if you are not careful, over ten percent alcohol is strong stuff regardless, not too filling on the stomach because it is not overly sweet or strong tasting, goes down very easily because of its unparalleled smoothness
Very different from other highly rated imperial stouts I have tasted from this site, where Dark Lord is super thick and syrupy, and Kate the Great is sweet and warming, Darkness is soothing and surprisingly dry, making all of these beers very different overall, one thing they all have in common is that they are sippers or dessert beers that take a good amount of time to get through, and that they pack a serious punch as far as ABV goes, I cannot say any of these three are better than one another because they differ so much
This deserves all the hype that it has gotten and I feel honored to try a beer like this, especially after seeing how much it has sold in online auctions recently, I never would have been able to afford if it was not for this generous trader, awesome RIS that is very unique because of its in your face hoppiness, glad Surly bottled this masterpiece, I have not tasted a bad beer from them yet, Darkness was amazing and I hope to get some of next year's batch if it is available in bottles again, highly recommended if anybody wants to give up a bottle, fantastic drinking experience 4,082 charactersFloydster, Jan 14, 2008
3.96/5  rDev -10.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Bottle #27 consumed from my Darkness tulip.
A: Delicious. It pours jet black with a creamy brown head, exactly the way a stout should look
S: Sweet dark chocolate and fruity hops with a hint of coffee. It actually smells kind of like dark chocolate covered raspberries.
T: The taste is like the smell, but the hops are much more intense. It has a sort of harsh bitterness to it.
M: Scrumtrulecent. Thick but not cloying. Like the appearance, it is how a stout should feel in ones own mouth.
D: It took me quite a while to finish the glass and I didn't want another one. Good thing I was sharing the bottle; I wouldn't have enjoyed finishing it myself
I had Darkness on tap several times this year and enjoyed it much more. Maybe it was just my imagination but the hop bitterness from the bottle was much harsher (not in an enjoyable way) than on tap. The friend I shared it with has a bottle she is aging for at least a year and I think that bottle will be much tastier. It could use a good year in the bottle. 1,012 charactersLeonTrotsky, Jan 08, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this on tap several times while it was available, but I opened bottle #107 to ring in the New Year. 
Pour was very black, and it may have been the wax or some other influence, but I think there was just a hint of a reddish hue on the edges of the brew. Rich, tiny, mocha bubbles covered the surface and stuck around for a while. Beautiful.
The smell is incredible. Sweet, hoppy, chocolate. Maybe a hint of citrus - not centennials or cascades I'm sure, but some pine and another exceptional aroma that I can't quite place, but DAMN!.
The taste is really where I am really blown away every time. Hops, chocolate, marshmallowy creaminess. It's like this beer has some sort of beer MSG in it making it tastier than anything ever made. The bottle version, I noticed, had a little more of an alcohol accent to it, but that might also be because I served it at the appropriate temperature, whereas the bar served it freezing cold. On-tap I was totally unable to detect any alcohol presence whatsoever. I had this next to a Flying Dog Imperial Porter one night, and the hop difference was astounding. 
I'm serious about the marshmallowy creaminess. It coats your mouth, and the hops add just enough chewiness to it that it lingers both in the lining of your mouth and the glass. My glass was brown for twenty minutes after I had finished my glass.
In an effort to expose my family to good beer, I opened this for them, and was hoping that they would hate it. Totally selfish, I wanted the whole bottle. I could drink the entire thing easily. Get it. Drink it. 1,563 characterszealot, Jan 05, 2008

This is it. The grand master of all beers, let alone stouts. Never before have I been so thoroughly satisfied with a goblet of beer.
It pours jet black with a scrumptious brown head. The aroma it exudes is chocolate, coffee and even some citrus notes.
The mouthfeel is smooth, coating goodness. I can taste a little bit of that citrus coming through the dark, chocolate overcoat. Some soy as well. You should probably sip this beer to get full enjoyment but I'll bet you dollars to donuts that you finish it ahead of schedule. Only Founders' Breakfast Stout can hold a candle, albeit a dimming one, to this R.I.S.
I was fortunate to have three helpings of this sex in a snifter before it went dry in Chicago. I'm counting down the days until October 2008, when this comes back. 827 charactersrudylaw, Dec 29, 2007
4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Clark St. Ale House. Pours black with a little bit of clarity and two fingers of fluffy white head and massive lacing.
The aroma is strongly coffeeish with a background of coffee and some suggestion of citric hops.
The flavor profile opens with coffeeish malts with sweetness quickly fading to a stronger coffee flavor, but without the chalky astringency that tends to plague drier imps like Nogne Ø and Old Rasputin. The finish is strong citric hops; alcohol is detectable only as warmth.
The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than some other stouts, but still relatively chewy and strongly carbonated. 
This is only the second hoppy imperial stout I've ever had, and the other one (Storm King) isn't even in the same league. Drinkability is out of control, assuming you like hoppy stouts in the first place. 817 characterskajerm, Dec 26, 2007

Bottle # 185.
Consumed out of the "official" 12oz Darkness glass...
Pours a dark, burnt chestnut...nearly black. Tannish brown head sits atop the dark liquid.
Aroma of dark chocolate, fig, and heavily roasted malts..molasses, caramel, and brown sugar flavors take control with the first sip...it's worth noting that there's a suprisingly strong resiny hop profile, since it's not something most people pay attention to in an imperial stout.
Expectantly huge body...coating, velvety smooth mouthfeel. Each sip I take seems to be more satisfying than the last..it's really hard to find any faults in this beer.
Somehow..(for a Russian Imperial Stout from a brewery only a couple years old) Darkness seems refined..almost like it has been perfected over decades. An absolute delicacy in the world of craft beer. 862 charactershero27, Dec 26, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a goblet at Chef Paul's Barvarian Lodge in Lisle, IL.
The beer is very dark but clear, with about 1/3" tan head. Lacing was left all along the glass as the beer went down. The smell is filled with piney and citrusy hops, but it also contains some caramel and toasty smells. Very light roastiness - less than I expected. If you close your eyes and imagine the smell of their IPA "Furious" - you'll smell it. It smells like a similar mixture of hops.
The taste is filled with great hop flavor. Again nice pine and citrus hops provide a bitter bite. Also some raisin and date flavors.
The mouthfeel is nice and full. This beer is extremely drinkable for a Russian Imperial Stout. It is not too sweet - in fact it is loaded with bitterness (this keg is probably young) and quite a treat for a hop lover. The alcohol is very well hidden. I had barrel-aged darkness at the Great Taste of the Midwest - and was not that impressed. This is much better. 957 characterswestweasel, Dec 26, 2007

A- "Blacker than the Blackest Black- times infinity", as one of my favorite sayings goes. A thick foam head with tenacious lacing as the beer goes down.
S- A roasted chocolatey, hop filled nose. 
T- It has an amazing, deep flavor. Chocolate, Toast, and a big hop taste that comes quickly and fades back. There was something of a bite like a warm coke(I like warm coke), I thought. Amazingly smooth, as well.
M- Thick! A medium to heavy viscosity in the mouth, and no bad aftertaste to speak of.
D- Highly drinkable. It's a sipper, but you keep on sipping. I can see myself having a few glasses.
My first review- be kind. ;) 705 charactersLordsloth, Dec 19, 2007

Poured into Darkness glasses bought at Darkness Day. Pours a great brown/tan head with a great lacing and great retention. Black in color letting no light in whatsoever. Smell is hoppy with a good coffee background. The first smell when putting glass to nose was chocolate, then the hoppy/roasty flavor balanced out. The mouthfeel was unbelievably smooth and full bodied. Overall, I loved it. Was a great experience from sitting in the cold to drinking it. 468 charactersErdinger2003, Dec 17, 2007

A: Served a pure pitch black. Espresso coffee black with a coffee crema colored head that leaves a TON of lace. Looks like something you'd find in a junkyard engine oil pan.
S: Huge nose of coffee and fresh, green, and piney hops. Bitter dark chocolate and burnt black malt.
T: Coffee, cherry, chocolate, toasted bread, dark fruit, roasted malt, and brown sugar/molassas. Sweet and tart fruit and incredible fresh green hops. Wow!
M: Looks and feels like thick oily syrup, but the mouthfeel is much more nuanced than that. Starts spicy and peppery and finishes full and creamy.
D: The alcohol is practically non-existant and the aromas and flavors compliment each other expertly. This is a wonderful beer! 837 charactersGbVDave, Dec 14, 2007
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on tap @ Chef Pauls Bavarian Lodge.
Deep midnight black in appearance. Extremely thick dense brown head. Mega sticky lacing that hung around the entire time. Laid back mild aromas of chocolate, malt, and a hint of piney hops. Taste of rich chocolate, sweet roasted malt, coffee, some burnt toast, and a touch of smoke. Every sip starts off very chocolaty and semi sweet, then finishes piney and ever so slightly bitter. NICE! Mouth feel is thick, extremely creamy, and sticky. This is the thickest brew I have ever experienced. Overall drinkability was incredible. Did not detect the high ABV whatsoever. A fantastic flavorful blend of chocolate and piney hops. A real gem to make out to the Chicagoland Burbs. Well done Surly Brewing Company! This RIS lives up to the hype. Highly recommended! 805 charactersDavidEddie, Dec 14, 2007
4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Like the cover of a Spinal Tap record, it cannot be any blacker. Dense brown head that suspends liquid within it and lingers for the long haul. 
Smell: Very rich character. Coffee and chocolate, rich malt and a decent hint of hops. 
Taste: Chocolaty roast malt. Blasts of sweetness settle to a ripple with a great hop balance. There is so much under the surface that begins to reveal itself, and then disappears back into the Darkness. A Complex and challenging brew. 
Mouthfeel: Rich, full body with a smooth oily finish. Very satisfying. 
Drinkability: Extremely drinkable for such a big brew. Tasty from start to finish. 639 charactersSargeC, Nov 26, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Blue Nile, and followed up at Stub & Herbs following day. Presented in both cases in a goblet (Blue Nile being a really nice Surly goblet). Great looking beer- black as night as expected with a chocolate milk head. Nose is heaven- spicy roasty chocolate. Taste- waves of flavours- all the usual suspects in a great imperial stout- dark roasted coffee, dark and milk chocolate, hazlenuts; plus a wallop of hop bitterness. The hops were really well done, and I think Im lucky to have tried this fresh while the hops are still battling out with the malts. Adds a really nice dimension to the beer. The pineyness of the hops plays well with the decadent desert of the malts. Very smooth mouthfeel and absolutely no booze heat. Damn fine. If I didnt have these at the start of my drinking day, I could have had many but stopped at two. I cant think of any other imperial stouts that Ive enjoyed more. Im very happy I could time my trip to Minni and get my lips on this sucker. well done Surly- you never let me down. 1,033 charactersoakbluff, Nov 24, 2007

A- This beer has a jet black body with a milkshake head of thick coco colored foam that last and last. Is slips down the side of the glass after each sip. 
S- This beer has a nice pine hop bitterness with a dark black roasted smooth quality. 
T- This beer has a creamy black bitter malt flavor with a dark raisin sweetness to it. There is a note of cream flavor that has a bit of a chocolate malt note to it. The finish is a nice green herbal pine finish that has a bitterness of hops under black malt that lingers after each sip. 
M- This beer has a full mouthfeel with a creamy texture and a smooth finish that doesn't really have any alcohol heat. 
D-This beer is big and smooth. The hops really hold there own against the dark black malt making this a great beer for the cold months. 827 charactersrhoadsrage, Nov 21, 2007

Pours opaque black, thin red is visible on the edges, very thick dark tan head, lots of thick lacing on the glass, great retention, really sticks. Smell is awesome, pine and molasses, very rich, brown sugar, chocolate, toffee, roast, sweet fruits, some dates, very complex. Taste is similar, burnt dates/raisins, brown sugar/molasses, milk chocolate, some pine and floral hops, coffee and cream, very rich sugary goodness, nice bitterness in the finish, alcohol is very well hidden. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, nice body, low carbonation, super smooth and drinkable. At first I wasn't sure what to think, but I can imagine this is exactly what RIS's tasted like when they were developed at the turn of the century. Fantastic stout, worth seeking out, and insanely drinkable, considering I had 3 pints!
2008 bottle: Day 2 of epic DrJay visit tasting, courtesy of grub.
Found this years to be a bit sweeter, not as much roast as the 07. Maybe a little less smooth. But still enjoyable! 1,179 charactersViggo, Nov 19, 2007

A-Poured the blackest beer I have ever seen,no light could shine thru this.1" of caramel colored head reduces to thick ring around edge of goblet.
S-First smell is soft hops,then a earthy plum and raisin smell with a chocolate and fruit background.
T-Similar to the smell,plum\raisin and a soft fruit\chocolate taste with no bitterness or hint of hops.
M-Velvety smooth over the palate with a nice touch of carbonation.
D-I've heard so much about this beer that I started to believe that it was to good to be true.I was wrong.This is a great beer that given the opportunity to try this you can not pass this up.This is a very drinkable beer but becareful at 9.5% it can sneak up on you. 726 characterstwbrewer, Nov 14, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Local Option, Maproom, and Hopleaf...first pour at Maproom was brimming with foam, at Hopleaf it was gushing from the glass like a muddy volcano. Jet black with a huge cap of lacy tan foam. Over time it forms sheets of webby lacing. 
Fruity hop in the nose, Amarillo maybe, tangerine or mango, even juicyfruit gum a little. Hops are aggressive, at 80 IBU's, but the aroma is definitely clean and measured. 
Initial burst of fruity/spicy hops are steamrolled by a dense charred chocolate, that lingers for a long time, underscored by earthy, bitter hops. Cocoa blends with a lightly astringent roast in the finish that suggests a quality blend of exotic coffee. Not overbearing, it hides the abv well. 
A viscous and velvety mouthfeel, with somewhat low-level carbonation, that still manages to be effervescent. After three, i've reached my limit, but that's a testament to an easily drinkable RIS. Really fantastic, i'm glad Surly has landed in Chicago... 968 charactersemerge077, Nov 13, 2007

A - This baby is thick,dark and black, who would have thunk it? Slight brown head that quickly disapates. Pretty much what you would think this beer to look like.
S - Holy Shit!!! This is the best smelling RIS I have ever run across. A slight fruit hop scent with a very distinct dark fruit scent. Plum with raisins and a big dark cherry scent. There is also a bit of dark chocolate in there. Wow!
T - Sweet malty goodness, but not too sweet. Flavors of dark chocolate and vanilla. Nice dark cherry and plum flavors here too. Some coffee in there too. Not too bitter or drying. Slight alchohol warmth but amazingly well hidden. Perfectly balanced.
M - Thick and creamy. Heavy but not sticky. Just perfect.
D - Even with the big flavors and high alcohol it is amazingly drinkable.
Overall, this is the best beer I have every had. Better than Westy, Dark Lord, KBS, you name it. I can think of no way to improve it. Man I wish this was easier to obtain. Hopefully the taps at Hopleaf last a while. 1,040 charactersMonsone, Nov 13, 2007
4.53/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Stub and Herb's into a Goblet....unfortunately the waitress was spilling it all over the floor as she brought it to me.
Appearance: Black, very black. Beautiful brown, persistent head. Quite seductive. I really didn't want to drink it because it looked so lovely, but at the same time it beckons me.
Smell: Not a whole lot at first. I feel that this was due to the fact that the beer was inappropriately, overchilled. Once it warms up, it smells of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. It actually has a distinctive hoppy smell for a stout.
Taste: Smooth, clean and rich are the first things that come to mind. Hints of chocolate, but has rich coffee flavors as well. A little sweet w/ a hint of molassess, but not too much. I am actually suprised by the hoppiness of this brew. It has a beautiful bitterness that is not too overpowering and balances out the flavors nicely.
Mouthfeel: Rich, creamy and smooth. Like liquid velvet. The everlasting head is smooth on my lips with every drink. Perfect mouthfeel for this style of beer.
Drinkability: This is perhaps the most suprising thing about this beer. It is one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I have ever had. It is so smooth and balanced, you would never know that it has such a high alcohol content. Just like the description says, I could drink this all night long. In fact I really want more of this one. I hope that some day they will release this in cans, so I can enjoy this one at home nightly. 1,478 charactersbrewdoc75, Nov 08, 2007

Smell: All I could really smell was the hops in this beer. Might be my cold acting up or because this was on tap so I couldn't stick my nose in it while I poured it.
Taste: Made a good impression on me. A nice hop blast followed by bitter chocolate and a little bit of smoky flavor. Not harshly bitter to my tastes. No alcohol to be detected by my senses.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth.
Drinkability: For an imperial this goes down extremely easy. If I wasn't trying multiple beers at the Gnome, I would have had another.
Finally I have tasted the Darkness from Surly. It is an excellent beer even though I don't typically seek out imperial stouts. The only thing to make this better was if it was canned for home consumption. I'm not sleeping in the parking lot for a growler! 897 charactersMdog, Nov 03, 2007
4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Inky black. Big thick crop of dark brown foam on top. Great staying power too. Spotty patches of brown lace coat the glass as I drink. The aroma is thick with raw, resinous hops. (Very similar to the way Alpha Klaus smelled the very first time I had it years ago.) Also chocolate notes and roasted malts and heavily roasted coffee bean. The flavor exhibits great complexity and depth. Baker's chocolate. Black licorice and hop oils mingle nicely. Intense coffee flavors and mocha/java notes. Fruit nuances are dark in nature....black berry and boysenberry come to mind. And there's a huge bitterness. A big double punch of roasted bitterness and hop bitterness....love this raw ass bitterness. And throughout, there's a nice charred edge to round everything off. The body is medium-full to full. Somewhere in that range. This doesn't have that "motor oil" viscosity, but it really doesn't need it. This is damn impressive the way it is. It's lightly carbonated and the alcohol really isn't that noticeable. It seems to blend in with the bitterness and is hidden to an extent in that capacity. There's a nice oily/greasy feel after drinking which I find appealing. The taste lingers long after I'm done. This is very drinkable. Growler would be no problem. 1,255 charactersBighuge, Nov 02, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Served in a tulip glass, this pours an opaque jet black color, with a small brownish head and scattered lacing on the glass. The smell is fruity and chocolaty. The taste is intense, with a peaty earthiness, a fruity plum flavor, a hint of grapefruit hoppiness, and a toasty maltiness. The flavors burst forth, yet this exceptional brew is smooth and balanced. The alcohol content is 9.5%, yet it doesn't feature in the taste. For me, the style makes this a "one and done" beer, due to the intensity of the flavors and the high alcohol content. That said, if any Russian Imperial Stout could tempt me into a second glass, it would be this one. An exceptional effort from the brewers at Surly. 691 charactersedbeered, Nov 01, 2007
4.76/5  rDev +7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've been luke warm on Imperials in the past, I was floored tonight.
Served from tap into belgian stem-ware, don't recall which. Inky black, while the lighting at the Blue Nile wasn't exactly bright, I am confident there was no light coming through that beer. A light tan head which eventually diminished. 
I didn't get a lot from the aroma, there was some malt there, and if my vocabulary was better or I was a more experienced reviewer, I might have something, but I kept trying for it and it never did become pronounced, but it may well have been overwhelmed by the intense flavors because I dove in pretty quickly.
Sweet, malty thickness, like a good 90% dark chocolate and a finish like a really well prepared espresso, bitterness lingering forever, essentially until I couldn't resist another sip. 
Mouthfeel that sticky syrupy sweetness that never cloys, it dissipates into a lovely alcohol warmth and the aforementioned espresso.
I usually have an Imperial and I am done with the style but I just couldn't resist a second and was not disappointed. 
I seriously have never enjoyed an Imperial more than this. 1,121 charactersPitmonkey, Oct 31, 2007

I think what Surly is doing is very ballsy. Brewing big beers and canning them. The only other example I can think of that comes close to this is Oskar Blues Ten Fity. I tried this at GABF so it was on draft and from what I heard their not canning this one.
But to get to the point; Darkness is off the charts! Pours a jet black, opaque hue, with a thick tan head. 
The roasty, toasty, coffee, caramel and slight whiskey aromas jump out at you. 
Strong coffee, roasty malt and toffee flavors. Slight whiskey character, but very subtle.
So drinkable! Just so damn, drinkable! This may be the best russian I've tried since Stone or North Coast.
If you can get your hands on this beer, try it! You won't be dissappointed. 792 charactersBillyB, Oct 21, 2007

A deep, dark pour. Close to Abyss in total darkness. Small, but dense off brown head, nice chunking action. A bit creamy. 
Aroma is full of cocao and coffee. Some anise and dark plum or prune. Not overpowering in the nose, makes mouth water.
Taste focuses more on the chocolate side rather than coffee. A rich cocao powder taste, yet is smooth. Dark chocolate, some coffee and anise, roasted malt and some caramel. Hints of toasted bread in the back.
Drinks very well, alcohol isn't detected. Nice feel. Great beer. 547 charactersMebuzzard, Oct 17, 2007

Taste is more of an initial fruity hop feel with a sweet taste of fruity hops and carmel. Mouthfeel is extremely thick and chewy that coats my throat all the way down.

Fore is chocolate, dark fruits (blueberry/cherry) and malt sweetness just before the finish. The finish holds dark chocolate, cooked dark fruits, cocoa powder, burnt malt and toasted/burnt grains.

4.88/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Cafe 28. First off, I have to say my intents were to go in and slam this beer. Id had enough with Imperial Stouts in the Top 50 (this may seem hypocritical considering my past endeavors to further a certain example of the style). My injurious intents would soon be quickly assuaged by a single glass of beer...A friend and I headed to Cafe 28, where I had called ahead to ensure the presence of Darkness and to get reservations. They anticipated my arrival with a table and a couple pours. 
The beer came to the table in a narrow chalice and it carried a luxurious finger of the most elegantly soapy, soft creamy dark-oak head. It was almost mahogany itself, gently sliding around on the top with large laces following the beer down the glass. The black gold itself absorb all light and possibly other objects with gravity, with just the slighest blood red corners. Beautiful. I put the chalice to my nose and was blown away by a bold, unique aroma. Its a tough one to finger, because it was so original and something Id not experienced. There were lots of reduced plums, raisins, dark cherry syrup, Ecuadorian estate chocolates and toasted wheat kernels. It was rather piquant and electrifying, with a real warming phenolic nose, but it wasnt boozy or chemical-like, instead a real refined almost sherry or perfume signature. Whatever it was, it was like no aroma Id wafted. Unfortunately, the pour was a little on the cold side, so the aromatics were slightly restrained and my the time the beer reached warmer climes, my olfactories had been saturated. 
On the tongue, the texture was immediately astounding. It was so thick and creamy, yet not sticky. Sweet, but not cloying. Smooth and drinkable, yet not watery. Warm and glowing, but not too hot. Hoppy, but was not dry and parching. Some amazing alchemical processes had occurred hear. Brewing magic under the hand of a wizard had formulated a brew so prefect and desirable I couldnt believe I was drinking it. I kept muttering, "best beer ever" and "damn near perfect." The flavor cascaded with everything and Imperial Stout drinker looks for. Mounds of freshly brewed Blue Mountains dark roast, Dagoba fair-trade dark chocolate, charred oak barrel edges, Italian cherry skins, Tahitian vanilla beans, drops of fresh organic farm cream and Italian espresso and then the dark fruits really came in. Moist rainier cherries, dried succulent wild bog cranberries, fresh raspberries from the stem, a hint of musky Thimbleberries, a cacophony of Bilberry syrup and Blueberry reduction, with a hint of sour cherries and final bit of pomegranate arils. On top of this, an electric wave of bright hops. 
Again, the character of the hops so unique as to be something I have a tough time likening it to. It had a real shining lime zest and gin quality. High, thin and mercurial. These bold citrus oils danced over the brewing cauldron of darker flavors, complementing and intertwining magically. Then, the longest draw of a smack I could imagine. It kept going and morphing, with roads of Marcona almonds, toasted earth, light goat cheese rind and ground oak dust. From the sauna floor rose juniper branches and hints of sea oats. The real phenomenal effect of this beer was the ethereal combination of every desirable effect. Each aspect played off of every other one in near perfect harmonic balance. The aroma was different from the flavor and the hops had great interplay and the texture was just plain perfect. It reminded me much of the great singular and touchable quality of Westy 12, with all the individualisms and character of the worlds most perfect Imperial Stout. This is the solar center paradigm shift of Imperial Stouts for me. 3,724 charactersCharlesDarwin, Feb 07, 2007

A: Into the extra large Riedel snifter it goes. A full inch of the darkest, thickest foam blooms out of no where creating a firm and solid lid to the brew. The body seems thin compared to the thick head, but boy is it dark. Its like a black hole, no light gets thru.
S: Interestingly enough, the first thing I smell is cascade hops. The rest of the aromas are almost oily in nature...plums, chocolate brownies, espresso drip, chestnuts and robust brown sugar.
T: Again the first thing that hits me are the cascade hops, full and juicy. The tip of the tongue experiences milk chocolate, some sappy pine and an interesting dynamic between grapefruit and molasses. Actually I think most of the sweetness is in the realm of butterscotch. Espresso moves in allowing roasted characteristics to blossum. Then these hops pop back up! Is this the hoppiest (read: not bitterest) imperial stout on the market? Boy this beer warms wellthe hops really become pronounced while the chocolate comes forth full and creamy. Finishes with buttery burnt cashews, spicy pine and bitter bakers cocoa. A heavy dose of roasted barley coast this one to fruition.
M: Full, thick and chewy. 
D: Delicious and quite original. Definitely stands out from the crowd. Its up there for the best imperial stouts but Im not quite sure its thee best. Not as luxurious as some of the others but jam packed with flavor. Delicious beer. Thanks again to JeffKrenner and his mystery source.

A chance to sample this next to the coveted Dark Lord from Three Floyds proves that Surly Darkness is an Imperial Stout worthy in the company of the best available. Roasty chocolate cocoa and hops leave this beer a bit more drinkable than the boozy monster previously mentioned. It is a different animal but quite tasty as well. A berry tart attribute orange hops parallel the espresso and dark malts. Full bodied rich and beautiful, this beer is everything I hope for from a RIS.

Appears a black with a dark maple brown hue. A dark tan, soapy head fades out into a gentle cap and leaves spotty lacing around the glass.
Smell is of hoppy pine, and oakiness up front followed by molasses, caramel, and cocoa. Sort of reminds me of Storm King with the hoppiness up front.
Taste is of cocoa, sugar, molasses, and plentiful of citrusy hops.
Mouthfeel is syrupy, lingering of chocolate, bitter, and mildly astringent. 472 charactersweeare138, Jan 10, 2007
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After a few servings of this fantastic brew, I finally sit down to reviewing.
Into a tulip glass, pours the darkest of midnight black, a thick, creamy tan head settling atop a Guiness-esqe cascade in reverse, bubbles look like they're going upward (though its dark in here, could have been seeing things). The head settles down after some time and drinking, and the darkness creeps through, but a good swirl brings the head back to life, and lots of lace is left on the glass.
Aroma is amazing, perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter, rich and thick of chocolates and espresso, sweet molasses and licorice. I can't imagine it being any better. The taste is similarly flawless, an understated study in the perfection of balanced parts creating a seamless whole. Even though this seems like the hoppiest Impy Stout I've ever tried, in both nose and taste, it isn't skewed toward the the leaf, as an equally potent yet counterbalanced sweet malting with dark fruits and chocolates and such combine into a beautiful whole. And its thick, very thick, one of the thickest, viscous brews I've had, and its just a fantastic beer to drink. And now I ask myself, dear God, why don't they brew this year round, bottle it in pure gold, for only the truest of beer lovers to drink and cherish.
Overall, I don't think I'm ready to give a 5. I almost did, but held back partially because and in spite of the fact that Surly is just over two years old, ie, it gets props for such fine-crafted beer so early, and if this one returns, I'd imagine it'd get even better (ie, the supposed bourbon barreled version). Only time will tell. So, drinkablility gets the blow because its potent, and, well, I couldn't very well knock it anywhere else.
EDIT: So, I was at Cafe 28 today, very delicious brunch. Anyway, they still have Darkness on tap, and I had given this beer a 4.95, but after having it one last time (maybe), I've noticed that on tap, its even thicker, creamier, smellier, tastier, and wantier than ever. So, with out further adieu, 5. 2,034 charactersobjectivemonkey, Jan 02, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Picked up this dark, inviting growler at the brewery on the 23rd. Glad I got there early enough to get one of these, because this is a terrific RIS! 
Decants a dark inky black with dark brown highlights. Topped by a very dense, glass-crawling, light cocoa brown head. Complex aroma of resinous hops, rich stewed fruits, sweet smoked meats, roasted barley, licorice, tobacco, and sugary espresso. Roasted bitterness up front. Followed by sweetish raisins, figs, coffee/chocolate liqueur, sweet smoked meatiness, molasses, and dark coffee. I really like the way the smoky/meaty flavors work with the sweeter, richer fruits and chocolate. Bittersweet finish of numbing hop resin bitterness and mocha chocolate syrup.
Amazingly thick and viscous mouthfeel and as full-bodied of a beer as I have ever had! Velvety smooth on the palate and dangerously drinkable. Complex and outstanding. Not just the best RIS made in MN (ha!) but one of the best I've had period. 963 charactersalexgash, Dec 28, 2006
4.43/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours out completely black into its very own Darkness glass. Dark brown head that lasts throughout and leaves about an inch of lacing at the top; pretty amazing for such a big stout. Smell is predominantly hoppy. Filled with aromas of citrus with hints of coffee and cocoa hidden almost entirely behind the hops. Taste has citrus hops dominating, and there isn't much of a roasty flavor until the finish. Carbonation was medium and mouthfeel is incredibly thick, but very nice. A joy to drink, but this is more of a sipper. 
On a side note, I've had IPA's that aren't nearly as hoppy as this, and wouldn't mind getting to see the malty side of this beer that is hidden behind the hops. A very awesome beer, that would probably be better if the malt was allowed to shine a bit more. Great job Surly, this one is worth seeking out. 832 charactersbadbeer, Dec 27, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5When I was drinking and thinking about this beer, two things occured to me:
1) Man there's a lot of hop flavor, is this really a RIS?
2) RIS? Who the bleep cares, this beer rocks!
Got a 8 oz. goblet at Cafe 28 with dessert. While the chocolate cake was pretty good, this beer stole the show. It's a hoppy SOB, there's no doubt and that only builds as it warms. At first there's more malt, big delicious chocolate and coffee. Reminds me of chocolate covered coffee beans. 
Then the hops get you. Big citrus fruit flavor ranging from the acidic rind to more mellow, flowery tastes. I've never experienced this much hop flavor in a stout, this rocks. I just wish somehow I could get some more delicious malt flavor out of it. Whatever, this beer was great. I want more. 774 characterstempest, Dec 27, 2006
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Cafe Twenty Eight. Served in its very own Darkness goblet, which I hope is a sign it will be returning year after year. It arrived at my table as black as black can be. The head is thick, and brown. It never fully goes away, and leaves a half inch of foam in the bottom of the glass when all of the beer is gone. The aroma is of chocolate, vanilla, graham cracker, plums and other dark fruits. The taste is a perfect balance of roasted malt, chocolate, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, silky and nicely carbonated. I really like how it is so full bodied without being overly chewy and sticky. Overall, this is one of teh best beers I have ever had. I am sure I could not drink more than one or two of these at a time, but I could drink one a night for eternity and be very happy. 807 charactersKarlHungus, Dec 11, 2006
4.18/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This poured so dark there was no penetrable light. There was a ring of golden head reminding me much of motor oil.
Smelt of chocolate and coffee.
Tasted alot like hoppy dark chocolate. Oddly it was salty when I licked the brew off my lips. There was a noticeable alcohol after taste.
It was thick and smooth with mild carbonation.
This was a bit much for me, but I thought it was nice for the style. 403 charactersWonderWoman, Dec 10, 2006
4.46/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Simply the most viscous and flavorful RIS I've ever had.
A wonderful piney hop blast in the aroma and great looks; deep black with a tan head that leaves a thick ring of lace with each sip. A whiff of fudge complicates the aroma and is a precursor of the decadent fudge-like instensity of chocolate flavors to come. Hops and instense chocolate flavors mix exceptionally well as they mingle with subtle bits of anise and a streak of blackstrap molasses.
I love how thick this stout is up front and then how it finishes somewhat dry. The viscosity, bold flavors and alcoholic kick affects the drinkability of this stout, but it is a drink to be savored and served as my dessert at Cafe Twenty-Eight. 699 charactersmarcobrau, Nov 30, 2006

I cracked a smile and started laughing as soon as it got close to my nose, surely love at first scent. Darkness also has a deep rainbow of flavors to back up its out of the ordering aroma and a mouthfeel thats open to one more before we go. 343 charactersdoubleshovels, Nov 29, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Special thanks to the SurlyMan for arranging to set aside a growler for a displaced Minnesotan. Then, my hat's off to feloniousmonk for getting said growler out to the east coast. Much obliged, gents!
First off, this one is about as dark as they come. It poured relatively flat, but then a copper and tan head crept out of the darkness to create a short creamy head. this fell after five minutes or so and left a slight collar. The bubbles that struggle up from the bottom along the sides of my tulip look like they're running in slow motion. Beautiful!
Smells of caramel and maple syrup that's effortlessly faded into grapefruit rind, pine hops. Seriously, I can barely detect the seam. In between the two comes little hints of classy dark chocolate. Nice.
The hops come through in the flavor much stronger than anticipated. They really steal the show up front with a dry sour hop snap that reminded me a bit of orange or grapefruit, but it's really in a class of its own. This is also accompanied by a glassy corn syrup sweetness. As the pine goes, it is replaced with a creamy, ever-so-slightly charred barley that reminds me of marshmallows roasted over a campfire and chocolate chip bran muffins. Finishes with a slight sting that feels more like citrus, with only a trace of a sharp lime sting. As the sting fades, I'm left with a nice espresso and a touch of smoke. Holy dynamics, Batman! 
The body is medium to heavy bodied, but the viscosity traps in tons of little bubbles making this one feel like pudding. It also coats my mouth a little.
This is a very well done beer. Great for the style, and fantastically intricate. A sipper for sure, but I don't think I'd want too many of these on any given night. I'm glad I have help with this growler. Thanks again Omar and Al! 1,786 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Nov 29, 2006
4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this on tap at the Blue Nile...I had it after a furious and some food so my palate was really saturated with flavors already. This brew is almost pitch black and has a really thick brownish head. This beer has so many complex smells and tastes that it is almost like an enigma. Espresso, coco-chocolate, dark fruits, balanced by a nice hoppiness. This has to be one of the best tasting beers I've ever had! This beer has the THICKEST and creamiest mouthfeel I have ever encountered in a beer, I'm serious. Its so thick that its almost like chocolate pudding. This is definitely not a session beer, but is best savored after a good meal. I really wish this wasn't a seasonal beer and was brewed all year round. Surly PLEASE give us more. 740 charactersRobertDwight, Nov 28, 2006
4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had this on tap at the Muddy Pig and the Happy Gnome on successive weekends. The name was indeed fitting. It was a dark black coffee color. The aroma was all chocolate and plums. The taste was well balanced between the fruity hops and toasted malts. 
This beer is a great example of the type. It has a great flavor and nice mouthfeel. I highly recommend this beer. Be careful though, it kicks like a mule with its high abv. 428 charactersbrendankeenan, Nov 27, 2006
4.73/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Darkness on tap at the Blue Nile...
Darkness is a fitting name for this incredible RIS. Deep black in color, as if it were a black hole, light goes in but does escape. 
The cocoa brown foam settles quietly and thickly at the top of the glass. The head does not recede through the duration of my tasting...instead it sticks along the top of the beer and sides of the glass....amazing.
Smells sticky-sweet...stinging aromas of cocoa and coffee. Cherry and molasses round out the mix. Throw in some hops and you're in scent heaven...I could also smell this stuff all day.
The first sip is still the best...tremendous malt flavor. Giant hop blast. Roasted chocolate. Very thick mouthfeel, but not overpowering. The fruity cherry flavor and sweet rum/molasses is complimented by the warming alcohol. 
I could probably drink a few of these- but I'd need to be careful- that 9.5% could sneak up quickly.
Delicious! An Imperial Stout at it's finest and yet another fantastic offering from Surly. 1,003 charactersMeLikeBeer, Nov 26, 2006
4.27/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dark, very dark and opaque to the eye as it is poured from the tap. Develops a dark tan head, tight, uniform, and very pleasing to the eye. The head along with the lace ("the stickiest of the icky") rings the glass and never seems to let go. The hops are definitely here in the nose, but are blanketed by notes of fruit (ripening plums, Concorde grapes) and a mildly-pungent yeast. Just a touch of lactic sourness on first sip, alongside hop bitterness, notes of green apple and iodine. A rich, smooth, oatmeal stout-like quality pervades the mouthfeel, and carbonation is appropriate for the style. The yeast character remains consistent as this warms, and there are both vegetal and medicinal qualities here as well. Very well realized: the alcohol is boozy and warming yet unobtrusive, and the hops are biting yet not overly assertive, and are woven intricately into the aromatics. Malty and full-bodied yet by no means sweet in the cloying sense. Near the end of the glass (and as near to actual room temperature as I can get without busting out my handy thermometer) I'm getting cocoa, vanilla, and a touch of sour cherry. Final thoughts: while the alcohol is stated to be 9.5% ABV, it is extremely well hidden here and Darkness drinks a little bit "lighter" than a beer going nose to nose with 10%. A very complex brew and definitely a sipper: if I get the chance to do so, I'd like to try this neck and neck with the Le Coq from Belgium some day, as it brings to mind some fond memories and notes of comparison to that brew. Reviewed at Blue Nile. 1,554 charactersChaz, Nov 08, 2006
4.58/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Holds true to the name, I could see no red or brown highlights, but then again, it is rather dim in the Blue Nile. Foamy coco colored head sat right on top at about 1 to a half centimeter or so the whole time. Rich creamy aroma, chocolaty with some dark cherries and espresso. As to be expected from Surly, a healthy dose of hops as well, earthy and grassy almost. Up front the flavor is quite fruity, dark cherries, raisins, plums, maybe even some grapes. Like Tavernjef said, almost tropical like. Then the malt fades in, silky smooth and sticky as molasses or melted dark chocolate. A couple of times I could taste espresso so well I could swear it was infused, but it was never so strong as to convince me. Enough hops were there to balance this monster the whole time too. I didn't really even notice alcohol the whole time, except for the occasional belly warming. Awesome beer. Dangerously drinkable.
To answer feloniousmonk's question at the end of his review (see below) I was thinking probably some Black Sabbath? 1,026 charactersdfried, Nov 03, 2006
4.78/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My Darkness sits in a Duvel tulip glass, the roasty brown espresso-tinged head filling the top, and the actual beer as black as the darkest night, saturated with sin. Tannish lace stays long on the glass. This bleak cast may scare away the timid, those less ready to tango with the Stygian side, but the nose entices me in, and am undaunted as I step into the dark.
A blast of coffee hits first, married with copious cocoa, bitter and sweet stand side by side, neither in dominance. Hints of dark rum, molasses, black pepper and anise are mixed in this aroma of this heady brew, and it only gets richer the more you drink it in the nose. Sweeter elements eventually take charge, but it's still a deep, almost spicy blend.
To taste: Massive mouthfeel, thick, gooey, and absolutely delicious. Chocolate is in full force, but matched once more with earthier aspects, the coffee, the spice, the slick black strap. Incredibly pervasive on the palate, this stout commands every inch of the senses, sending tasty tendrils up in each crack in the cavern of the mouth. Plenty of hops at play (80 IBUs), bobbing just below the malt.
Sip, gulp, swallow, and the parade of flavors begins again, dancing along the tongue, like some malefic ballet. Dark fruit sensations rise up and leave the mind searching for the connection. Dark cherries, berries, raspberry? ....but completely covered in a shell of chocolate. The lip smacks, the tongue scrapes up remnants of this rich elixir, not to miss a drop of deliciousness. 
To state "full-bodied" would be an act of redundancy. This is huge, long, and out of the ordinary. Ends smooth and dryly, a pleasing finish, still loaded with flavor, never dying away completely. 
Puts many a RIS to shame, though I'd love to sit down and do a comparison among others. To the great credit of Darkness, the alcohol content does not really stick out until nearing glasses end, and the less attractive aspect is that the beautiful dark, rich flavor leaves you craving more, ...although you probably shouldn't. (It's 9.5%, give or take.)
I entered the heart of Darkness, and peered into the abyss...found it satisfactory to my soul, and I believe I will take this midnight ride again and again...in moderation...
and to think, there is a bourbon barrel version on it's way...oh, sweet mercy!
Hey, Todd, which metal album should have been thundering in the background while I drink this?
And thank you for brewing this beer, to my knowledge the only Russian Imperial Stout from a Minnesota brewery, outside of the brewpubs. 2,549 charactersfeloniousmonk, Oct 30, 2006
4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On-tap at the Blue Nile: Dark pruney brown. Thickly puffed and creamy milk chocolate browned topping that stays for a good stint. After a time, a sandy skim is remaining with a firm collaring and thinnly placed sheets of lace coats the glass with immense sticking power. 
Aroma is a lofty yet mild with an array of sweet dark fruity skins and juices of plum, pineapple, banana, and fig, all mixing with a dollup of chocolate cake and frosting. Ethanolic heat gets in the way as it sits and becomes the everstanding presense after a while, but stay fairly tropical and cocoa covered.
Taste is a brigade of sweet, dark flavors; at first, as this Imp. Stout changes its way some as it goes. But this has a tropical, yet dark, sweet front side that has a good slice of dullish pineapple, some slimming banana, dried plums and figs, and a scant of spicey molasses. Then chocolate comes in and covers it all up with one creamy cake filling smoothness and slight bitterness. The palate is soothed over with a delightful stand of bold chocolate tone in a fluff of dark cocoa bitterness. Slight hints to the spice and fruits lingering in the corners. A mighty nice taster of a stout. The front part starts bright and tropical, but fades as it warms. This was served pretty darned chilly for an Impy, but patience pays off by letting it sit about 10, 15 minutes.
Feel is smoothly silken and thickly set in a grand tone of wonderfully delightful chocolate malt and brief, slippery Doppelbock dark fruityness. Firm and strong with only a slight hint to higher ABV type warmth that's not really evident in any fashion other then the aroma. It reminded my of a chocolate silk pie. Kinda fluffy with that certain texture thats melting and coating. Quite nice. The finish is lengthy in chocolate tone and blended well in dark set bitterness.
Surly have done themselves well with this treat. A true winter sipper that can be easily enjoyed fully and with more in mind once the glass has emptied. 
Beware: Darkness has set across the Land of Minnesota Beerdom. Close the door and lock it behind you. It's time for drinkin' some Darkness! 2,123 characterstavernjef, Oct 27, 2006

This was a smooth and easily drinkable beer I hope to get my hands on this one again 385 charactersryantupy, Oct 08, 2006
