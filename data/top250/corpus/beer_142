A: Pours a super hazy, pale orange in color with a one inch, frothy paper white head with fair retention. Thick white lacing throughout.
S: Big aromas of citrus and tropical fruits including grapefruit, orange, melons, peach, passionfruit, and guava.
T: Huge juice bomb!! Starts off with big notes of grapefruit, orange rind, and melons followed by light notes of peach, passionfruit, and pineapple. Finishes with a nice lingering piney, resinous hop bitterness.
F: Medium bodied, velvety smooth, pillowy mouthfeel with light carbonation. Slight dryness on the finish.
O: Overall, this is an amazing DIPA. Super juicy, but well balanced with the perfect level of hop bitterness. Artfully crafted. Wish I could drink this every day! 786 charactersBeerGuy8315, May 02, 2017

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Canned 04/10/17, pours cloudy gold orange color which looks like grapefruit juice that has a 1-2 finger foamy white head that was full of bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving good spotty lacing as it went down. Had a second can this evening and the lacing retention was much better.
Smells so fresh and juicy, it's like putting a hop cone in one nostril with a slice of orange peel in the other nostril. Super aromatics and quite fruity, there's lots of citrus here including pineapple, grapefruit, papaya, orange peel, tangerine, melon and any citrus hop adjective you can think of. I also got earthy notes like fresh cut grass, tea leaf, weed, musty old fruit similar to rotting apples, floral hops and some pine cone/piney hops. Trailing biscuit and toasted grains bring some wheat bread toast to the party and add balance for a terrific nose.
Tastes like fruit juice, all things citrus up front. Plenty of citrus hops with grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, mango, tangerine, orange juice, Orangina soda, and then peppery spices like coriander, white pepper and cinnamon mixed with light caramel, red grapefruit pith, sour green apple and zesty piney hops. The malt backbone is tame with biscuit, buttered wheat bread and toasted grains adding the malty balance, but this is basically a hop bomb that is bitter yet mellow and well balanced at the same time. The citrus complexities keep bringing everything together for an overall great flavor.
Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and yet carries some prickly, fizzy carbonation that allows the bitterness to seem average while completely masking the 9.3% ABV. An impressive feat to make such a strong beer flow down so effortlessly, this was medium bodied, complex and extremely east to drink. Another great DIPA by Trillium, I really enjoyed this brew. 1,800 charactersCHickman, Apr 19, 2017

4.04/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The beer looks like a standard New England IPA. Light yellow color with the cloudiness you expect. There was very little head, however. What head was there was white and dissipated quickly.
The smell is wonderful. Heavy notes of orange and pineapple with some floral characteristics and a light grassiness. No heat on the nose. Just wonderful for a double IPA.
The flavor falls a bit flat. Very little complexity.  Light orange pith with piney finish. Not a lot of heat up front but after the pine goes away, your mouth is just left with the alcohol burns.
The body is nice and full with a decent compliment of carbonation. There could be a bit more carbonation bite though.
I find that I don't share the common view of Trillium. Every beer I have from them has one great quality and one not great quality. Is usually a fight between nose and flavor. This time the nose was great and the flavor didn't follow. They do good beer but its not worth the price. 960 charactersTheBeerCarl, Apr 18, 2017

Pours a hazy, dull orange with a 1/8th inch off-white head that dissipates towards the edges forming a creamy slick across the surface.  The beer was served a bit cold so I was only able to get subdued notes of citrus, biscuit malts and an earthy quality.  Taste follows nose - citrus was a bit more evident in the flavor profile.  There were also some earthy/herbal qualities expressed towards the finish.  Mouthfeel was light-medium in body with a bright carbonation.  Overall, solid but a disappointing.  I've ben wanting to try this beer for a while; however, it wasn't particularly distinctive. 618 charactersJwale73, Apr 16, 2017

Great looking beer, hazy orange, with a really nice, fluffy head.
The smell is pure, unadultarated tropical juice. Passionfruit and pineapple dominate, and the end of the sniff is sweet.
The taste is as tropical as the nose, massive pineapple and passionfruit waves crash on your tongue. The fruityness is follwed by a tremendously balanced hop bitterness, and just a hint of booze. The lingering hoppy finish is spectacular.
Mouthfeel is everything I read about and hoped for. Soft and airy, but with good body and perfect carbonation.
My first hoppy Trillium, and wow, what a tropical delight. Great balance, just the right amount of warming booze. Superb. 740 charactersJamFuel, Mar 22, 2017

Aroma smacks you in the face with pineapple, orange, apricot, a bit of nectarine and passion fruit. Smells absolutely amazing. The taste is OJ with pineapple, various fruitiness. Bitter is barely there, but it sticks around. Citrus sticks around for a bit on the tongue, the barely there bitterness is there with it. Crisp and nicely carbonated. The body mostly dry and a bit of hop oil coats your taste buds. 9.3%? I would of guessed more like 6-7% if I didn't read the can. Stupid good for that ABV, this is coming from someone who likes lower ABV and sessions. Just an incredible beer, would buy it all the time if I could. 662 charactersNedry, Mar 03, 2017

Aroma is bursting with pineapple and apricots. Wonderfully thick mouth feel with medium to low carbonation. Palate has plenty of fruit upfront and some sweetness which mellows into a dry and very long bitterness. Hides the 9.3% incredibly well. Beautiful beer and one of my favourites from Trillium (all be it I haven't had many). 354 charactersNarkee, Feb 23, 2017

I am a big fan of Mettle so when a buddy offered me one of these I was all over it and it did not let me down.   Super tasty/juicy - not boozy at all just full of flavor and super smooth. Won't blow you away on the first sip but its such a well done and balanced brew you'll appreciate it more with each mouth full.  Outstanding beer. 454 charactersnjcraftguy, Feb 10, 2017

4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Bottom of can says 01/19/17.
A- Pours a murky medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of sheer surface foam.
S- Very big melon note off this one as well as some apricot and peach.
T- The flavor is more resinous and has some pine quality to it but still pretty fruity as well.  More citrus rather than stone fruit though with some orange and grapefruit-y tartness.  Bitterness is more pronounced than you usually get with these NE IPAs.
M- Soft in the body but with a moderate sharpness from the hops.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- The ABV is expertly concealed and the flavor profile is cohesive, but it's a bit dry for my tastes.  A great beer but not outstanding within the Trillium portfolio for me. 875 charactersImmortale25, Feb 05, 2017

Appear:  light golden hazy goodness. nice pillowy fingers worth of head dissipating relatively quickly leaves a pillowy blanket of clouds on the side of the glass when rocked.  
Nose: it's slight.  Not an overwhelming nose at all.  Some sweet grapefruit little cara cara orange lil dankness. not a big nose at all.  slight floral note
Taste: Balanced.  There's a nice tropical fruit oranges grapefruit mango that folds nicely into a herbal dank hop bitterness.  
Mouth: pillowy. nice medium light medium.  really tasty feeling.  The 9.3%  is completely hidden.  
Over:  One of the best offerings I've had from Trill.  I really like this beer.  I will seek it out in the future.  See the notes above but this an awesome NE stlye DIPA. 815 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 29, 2017

Smell-Dank hops, grapefruit, faint tropical notes.
Taste-Very grapefruity, not as funky in taste as in the smell, tropical notes follow the citrus and just the slightest but of bitterness in the finish. Booze is incredibly well hidden.
Feel- Very light for this much alcohol, nicely carbonated, slightly creamy.
Overall-Very pleasant, deserves serious props for hiding the ABV as well as it does. 476 charactersSteveB24, Jan 22, 2017

4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.516oz can.
Pours murky gold.with an inch of white fluff. Retention and lacing is minimal.
Aromatics are pungently hoppy, abound with juicy citrus. Candied grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, and peach. On the chewier side of medium bodied with a resinous, tacky mouthfeel. Buckets of tropical fruit on the palate. Heavier on the grapefruit with zesty citrus packing a whallop. Finishes long with plenty of dank, fruity hops and a firm bitterness.
This is the Trillium that has more of everything that all their hop-forward beers are known for. Killer. 550 charactersbrewandbbq, Jan 22, 2017

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5If we're being honest, I was getting a little bored of Trillium's offerings towards the end of last year. Like many here, I found my palate was less and less wowed with each hop bomb as they all blend into that dominantly hazy, tropical and vinous taste before finishing dry. I wasn't complaining, but I wasn't wowed. This last month, however, has been like a new leaf. Pow Pow, DDH Congress/Stillings, Pinot Gris Dialed In... and now this huge return. I must say expectations were massive going in here. After a seven month wait, I knew the Trill boys must have really honed this one in. And fucking hell did they. 
Pours a murky golden orange. Mango juice. Smell doesn't spring out of the glass like Scaled Up or their DDH offerings but the citrus and alcohol presence let's you know this guy isn't mucking about. The second you sip this, you can feel the Lupulin presence tickle your gums and cheeks for ten seconds. They obviously went wayyyy overboard on the hop additions, and I for one am NOT complaining.
Tastes like underripe peach, Meyer lemon, dried apricot, green apple skin, and lots and lots of hop pellets. Resinous, sticky, mealy. Full bodied is an understatement, but it maintains a very nice and bright carbonation. Doesn't hide the 9.3% whatsoever but jeez this is hard to put down. So glad I have another 100+ ounces in the fridge to enjoy as it evolves over the next few weeks. More of this please! 1,421 charactersbarsonthetrak, Jan 21, 2017
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From a growler.  Pours hazy, orange-yellow in color, with 1/4inch head.  Taste is big pineapple, mango, and light orange rind.  Heavy bodied, juicy with slight bitterness, medium-low carbonation.  Reminds me a lot of Tree House's Very Green.  An amazing, dank, juicy sipper.  I think I prefer regular Mettle more, but this is in my top five Trillium IPAs.  Well worth seeking out. 380 characterstigg924, Jan 21, 2017

T: Sludge. Fleshy grapefruit. Canned pineapple. Honey marmalade. White pepper. Some astringency toward the back.
M: Chewy. Frothy. Medium-bodied. Light carbonation. Slightly boozy. Sweet, fruity finish.
O: Despite the fact that we approached these brews in terms of ascending intensity, Heavy Mettle was still a lot more than I could handle; I literally froze after my first sip trying to make sense of all the flavors at play. A villainously complex hop-forward DIPA that will amaze and satisfy all genera of hopheads, I'm sure--I just like mine to be a little more well-rounded when it comes to flavor. 730 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

I could not even imagine how fantastic an IPA, a double IPA at that, could taste! My co-worker Chris told me about Trillium when I was leaving PA to visit MASS for work training. I am glad he did!

It sat in the fridge for like 2 months. my 1500th unique beer on untapp'd was in sight and I decided to make it special, so I had Heavy Mettle and drank it all myself. I'm glad I did. Its easily one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. I put it right up there with Hill Farmstead Double Galaxy or Double Citra, Other Half Green Diamonds, Tired Hands Milkshake. Its a PINEAPPLE JUICE BOMB. Its dank in the best way! If pirates drank beer instead of rum, this would be their beer. its AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm in love! Mouthfeel is great. Its easy to drink. Its balanced and has great flavor. 5 BIG ASS STARS. Trillium, Can I have a job at your brewery and learn how you make such great beer (I'm serious. I want to learn from the best. PM me). This rocks my world. People say how TH makes great IPA's, but TH has NOTHING on this brew-NOTHING! FANTASTIC! 932 charactersTheRossness, Aug 19, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to SadMachine for this bottle, as I try to ferret out the appeal of this newish brewery. 750ML bottle split with my wife. And I dig the labels - reminds me of 1776 Boston for some reason. 
The pour is watery orange juice run through CO2. The aroma is a non-dainty face slap of tropical fruit with lots of Florida oranges. Hard to understand that much fruit without a Renaissance Festival style fruit stomp during the boil. 
Heavy Mettle - can confirm this is good. The orange, mango, & peach that catapult out of the glass is simply ridiculous. Bitter citrus rides the mid-palate along with a sweet, candied backbone moving into a clean, Invisible Man-style finish. Almost nothing lingers on the palate until the next loving sip. Juicy - which I usually don’t use as a complement, but I do here. No apparent alcohol, which makes it easy to slug as Tang. 
My second Trillium & now I begin to see the hype, which I didn’t the first go-round. Drinkable, fruity as a strawberry gelato, & with enough bitterness to let me know I’m not drinking Fanta. Excellent brew. 1,077 charactersmaximum12, Jul 30, 2016

Nose is bursting with tropical fruit aromas.  Mango, pineapple, peach and tangerine.  A touch of honey-like sweetness in the background.
A juicy tropical fruit profile with notes of pineapple, tangerine and mango with a sharp bitterness.  A slight honey-like sweetness adds some balance.  The vintage Trillium yeast profile really shines in this beer.  
Fully body.  Chewy and oily.  A perfect mouth feel. 486 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jul 18, 2016

3.87/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 3.75750ml bottle, dated 6.15.16, poured into a Trillium snifter glass. 
The beer pours a pale golden straw color, hazy and cloudy, a finger or so of soapy white head, moderate retention with large patches of soapy lace. The aroma is pretty intense, spicy, green, earthy, piney, light citrus and fruit, just dominantly resinous with a really big cereal grain backbone, really sturdy malt bill. The flavors are equally as demanding, lightly fruity hops, dominantly spicy and earthy, a touch floral but mostly grassy and resinous with a stale cracker malt backbone that isn't my favorite profile, but is also a good counterbalance to how all the hops. The mouthfeel is great, coating, medium body that is so smooth yet lively, crisp with a quenching finish that is lightly dry.
Verdict: A pretty solid DIPA, but I actually prefer Mettle to Heavy Mettle. Aside from Vicinity, I've found that many of the "Yeast Coast" IPAs tend to get overly aggressive and unbalanced after a certain ABV, usually around 8%. I am really starting to find myself enjoying the more delicate, balanced and complex IPAs that come in a lighter package. Sometimes less is more, and this one might be a bit too much. 1,185 characterskevanb, Jul 16, 2016

Consumed 7/6/16
A: Tangerine gold - so stupidly turbid, beyond hazy and more like a soup - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a wispy cap but retains a medium collar, leaves some nice spots and streaks of lacing
S: Like opening a bag of hop pellets - straight-up hop juice, hop resin, and leafy hops - waves of citrus, with tangerine, orange, and grapefruit flesh, juice - some pine resin and pine needles in addition to the leafy cones - decidedly dank, even more resin and some spicy herbal aromas - peach and stone fruit - tropical with some rich pineapple, mango, guava, passion fruit - some pale malts at the base
T: An assault of hops - big, sticky citrus with some orange and grapefruit flesh and oil - herbal and vaguely spicy, leafy hops - resinous hops and resinous pine, with a touch of pine needles, hint of grass - more citrusy/leafy in the taste than expected, with fewer tropical notes compared to the aroma - some fleshy peach, pineapple, and passion fruit - more straight-up grapefruit in the finish - some dry, pale, crackery malts at the base with a touch of booze
M: On the full side of medium, smooth and a bit fuzzy like many Trillium IPAs, lightly oily but it actually finishes dry and mostly clean, with some booze
O: It's like that Metallica shirt with the knife coming out of the toilet... except with hops
Heavy Mettle is so brutal it could be on Metalocalypse. It builds on a few things that Mettle does right and just makes everything substantially better with an absurd amount of hops. 1,574 charactersangrybabboon, Jul 06, 2016

Aroma is pine dankness upfront with citrus on back end
Delicious tasting offering that taste exactly what it smells like.  Dankness and late citrus.  Booze hits late too.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy for an Imperial
Overall-  another great IPA from Trillium.   I enjoyed Mettle 6 months ago in Boston.  I liked this a little bit better. 378 charactersjcflorian, Jul 04, 2016

Aroma of pineapple, grapefruit, citrus.
Taste:  mild bitterness up front, the citrus is pungent, the first sip made my mouth pucker, as if tarty.
A bit of alcohol in the taste although its very cold, im going to let it warm up.  So far the taste is the least appealing aspect of this beer.
Feel:  on the thin side for a 9.3% but thats great.  I dislike the thick DIPAs. Dry finish. 430 characterskalosjakar, Jul 03, 2016

Pours a nice fluffy creamy 1 finger head with thick froth in the middle, fades at a med pace with nice soapy lacing, milk shake murky pale straw tangerine orange color.
Nose explodes with citrus and fruit, big tangerine and orange peel, some grapefruit pith, juicy peach and nectarine flesh, with a little fruity bubblegum, touch of melon rind and maybe a hint of grape must, clementine, tangelo, and lots of nice citrus juice, and maybe even a faint mango and tropical pineapple thing, with a hint of creamy juicy malt underneath.
Taste brings a touch of piney note, with dank resin, a bit earthy, not too bad, quickly into citrus rind, a big rind and sweet orange peel, tangerine clementine citrus again, some juice and plenty of rind, with some pith as well, into some mild peachy nectarine like stone fruit, some grapefruit as well, and again faint mango and pineapple like tropical notes,back into some orange fruit juice packets that you rip apart when peeling the fruit. A mild soft creamy sweet-ish malt underneath, creamy wheat, almost chewy. Finish is dry, a little creamy wheat still, plenty more bitter grapefruit pith, orange rind, and mild tropical notes.
Mouth is med to fuller bod, a hint of booze on the back end, creamy wheat, carb is a bit on the lighter side.
Overall pretty nice, not their best but def a good one. Glad to see so many good ones from them as they really seemed to have ramped up their game, and finally getting to the good hops (non mosaic). 1,498 charactersjlindros, Jun 30, 2016

3.84/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4bottle dated 6/15/16. pale milky yellow color with a dense white head, nice retention and a bit of lacing. 
thought the nose on this was a little weak, theres a hint of pineapple, grassyness & alcohol. maybe Im crazy but honestly I thought the smell of the fort point ales popped way more than this, which shouldnt be the case considering this one is in the higher range of abv. 
nice fruity hops up front, and a solid bitterness on the finish - but the alcohol is apparent, especially as the beer warms, which definitely hurts the flavor profile. the combination of astringent alcohol, bitter pine and a mineraly finish is pretty brutal. feel is slightly thinner and less creamy than the other trillium ales ive had.
overall, given that this beer is only 9.3% its pretty disappointing that the alcohol is so apparent. maybe im being overly critical, maybe my palate is shot, maybe im crazy idk. I first tried this beer about a week ago and decided not to write a review because I wasnt impressed and I thought the booze was more predominant than any of the flavors I expected to experience. for me this didnt live up to the hype at all, and it was definitely my least favorite from trillium. but like I said I had two bottles dated the 15th so both were consumed within 2 weeks...makes me kind of sad because I havent tried a trillium beer yet that wasnt at the very least excellent, and I think this one is pretty poor. 1,424 charactersHyptochrons, Jun 29, 2016

A: Pours a super cloudy pale orange. Enormous frothy light tan head. Amazing head retention with thick walls of lacing. Basically perfect.
S: Huge citrus aroma with a mixture of tropical fruits. Oranges, grapefruits and pineapple primarily I'd say. Very pungent. Even get some melons in there.
T: Very similar to the aroma. Big sharp citrus and tropical fruits. Huge herbal spiciness. Nice wave of bitterness on the back end with a long drying citrus peel finish.
M: Medium-heavy with a very soft, dry mouthfeel.
O: Great DIPA. Huge hoppiness without too much bitterness. Dry crisp and refreshing. A perfectly amped-up version of their normal IPA lineup. Juicy as hell. 709 charactersDope, Jun 26, 2016

Pours a super hazy, freshly squeezed orange juice orange color with a big white head that reduces slowly to leave good lacing and retention. One of the haziest, nicest looking Trillium's I've ever seen!
Aromas are juicy, tropical, fruity, orange creamsicle, pineapple juice, grapefruit. Taste matches the nose with plenty of orange creamsicle, citrus, tons of tropical fruits, light bitterness on the finish. Easy drinker, the ABV is not apparent at all, medium body and carbonation. 
One of the best Trillium's I've ever had. Most orange-creamy one I've had. 656 charactersgcamparone, Jun 26, 2016

Huge flavors and unlike most TBC beers the alcohol is hidden extremely well in this.  Reminds me a lot of TH beers like Doppelganger if there was a comparison but better with this current batch.  I could wax poetic about how good this beer is but IMO this going forward will be the beer that all other TBC beers will be judged by.
So mad at myself for only buying 1 when I drove up for the Upper Case release.  I would put this beer on my bucket list as it is a must drink with this current batch.
Great job Trillium!
UPDATE:  Was just a really good batch that day.  The 6/15 batch was good but not god like like the late May batch was. 698 charactersBEEPOP, May 21, 2016

Appearance: pours a super murky and hazy orange-pink color, with a huge, lingering white head. The head sticks around for a few minutes, leaving sticky, spotted lacing. Beautiful looking beer....the epitome of a Trillium ale.
Aroma: hop aroma pours out of the bottle the second the cap comes off. Layers upon layers of citrus, grapefruit, and a fair amount of bitterness come out. Doesn't smell boozy, but there is a little sweetness on the scent too.
Taste: super duper hoppy and fresh tasting. It does have that raw hop flavor that comes through in a lot of Trillium beers. Packs a ton of grapefruit and pineapple in there, with a little bit of fruity sweetness in addition to the bitterness and hop flavor. It's not my favorite Trillium IPA, but it's pretty damn good.
Feel: very thick and full-bodied, it puts the "heavy" in Heavy Mettle. This is super thick and sticky.
Overall: this was another excellent DIPA from Trillium. Seek it out, and wrap yourself in hops. 1,022 charactersTheElectricOne, May 21, 2016

S:  Tropical frutiness.  Unlike the appearance there is just enough of a bitter undertone for me to know I'm not smelling a juice.
T:  Less tropical and juicy than some other Trillium offerings I've had.  The hope flavor is nice here and there is a balance between the bitterness and fruit notes.
F:  Theres a certain thickness to this that I don't usually get in IPAs.  Not on the level of a stout, but it has substance. 
O:  For most breweries this is where I'd say they've really stepped up their game and this is fantastic.  This is a Trillium IPA though, and while great, it isn't quite on the level of some of their other beers, even some of those in regular rotation.  Basically, if you're like me and Trillium is on your commute home, its worth picking up a bottle or two, but not worth going out of your way for.  If you don't have regular access to the brewery and you have a chance to get one of these, be it through trade or whatever, do it. 1,157 charactersPierre_Pressure, May 21, 2016

Accordingly, I'd probably disregard everything I'm about to say, because I'm too emotional to be taken seriously. This beer is possessed of towering, stupid fruit, y'all; a hazy, luminous monster, crowding the glass at the juice zoo. Hot-house orange nectar sweet meets hot-boxing-your-friends'-mom's-station-wagon bitter, and has a fight, a dumb fight, over which one is best and they both win.
Some things I thought of while drinking Heavy Mettle
- the youtube clip of the scene in Spider Man where Randy Savage goes 'BONE SAW IS READY' over and over and over, but, like, as a hop profile.
- being beaten up by a gang of enormous, delicious clementines.
- If the drum fill from 'In The Air Tonight' by Phil Collins were a beer.
- (Which is basically the same as) If former Celtic Kevin Garnett were a beer. 
- Why, if it possible to make this beer, more people aren't doing it.
This is the beer I drank to say goodbye to Prince. This is the beer I'd ask for if I knew the world was going to end. I'll serve this beer at my wedding if I have one and it is available. This beer is my child. My juicy, explosive child. 1,137 charactersHankSingle, May 16, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Bottled 5/3/2016. You dudes remember Mettle? Meet its kicked-up older brother.
Appearance - The appearance is super hazy, like freshly-squeezed pineapple juice. Of all the hazy Trillium IPAs I've had, this very well may be the haziest. With that added opacity comes a darker shade of orange as well compared to Mettle. 
Aroma - Whereas the nose on Mettle was a playful combination between fruity and piney, Heavy Mettle is pretty much all fruit, especially the peach. The Galaxy hops are the star here and shine beyond even the Amarillo.
Taste - The flavor aggressive and toes the boundary between smooth tropical flavors and a somewhat harsher hop bite. At first the peach and grapefruit dominate, but as the beer sits, there is a noticeable vegetal quality in the finish, like when you taste your gravity sample of a homebrewed IPA. Just that raw hop bitterness flavor. It comes and goes though, so it isn't overpowering - moreso a lingering feeling. Tons of hop flavor through and through though.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is moderately heavy-bodied with good carbonation. Bucking the trend from the other Trillium IPAs I've had recently, this one has a really substantial body to it and good carbonation to really drive the flavors. Perfectly textured.
Closing Arguments - Overall, this may be in the running for favorite IPA from these guys, but honestly it's a very tight race. A definite step up from Mettle, but a whole different animal for sure. 1,459 charactersnhindian, May 15, 2016

Overall another great offering from Trillium.  A lot of unique fruits coming through on this.  Some melon and mango and maybe somethine guava perhaps?  A definite citrus presence exists as well.  Super potent and dank and certainly follows through with the flavors.  Juicy hop bomb and a fantastic Trillium release.  Would love to have this again! 405 charactersrabbott2, May 14, 2016

4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 64 oz growler into a tulip glass with about a fingers worth of head which settles down into a soft glaze on top. Appearance is so cloudy, hazy, and thick with a nice orange juice colored hue. The nose on this beer pops out as soon as the cap is twisted like a dank cloud! Hints of sappy pine, summer fruit like ripe nectarines and peaches jump out along with some ripe melon.  The nose may be the best part of this beer, and that's not to slight the taste portion, it just really catapults into your nose like not many others. 
Tart citrus and peach jump out across the palette, with a thin mouthfeel, though medium bodied. You can really discern the booze factor on this one, though the initial pour may have been from a growler not totally refrigerated after pick up. Either way, its so drinkable and smooth, you almost forget its over 9%, and that can sneak up on you quick! Overall this beer is extremely pleasant, from look and nose to taste. While I still hold Vicinity in highest regard, this was one HELL of a beer! 1,038 charactersSolebird23, May 13, 2016

4.93/5  rDev +10%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Grabbed a growler. Three days old.
A- heavy mettle pours a patented New England fluorescent orange with golden hues and a frothy white head of foam. As I always desire from a great IPA/DIPA, the brew glows in the glass and literally displays the Galaxy and Amarillo hop glow in used to seeing
S- orange juice in a glass! A burst of freshly squeezed juice is bundled with pineapple, tangerine, and guava. While congress st was predominantly grape fruit, HM is the fresh tropical flavors that I love. Not bitter, just sweet and mouth watering
T- nailed it. My first juice nuclear bomb. I was hoping the Galaxy and Amarillo would dominate and bundle into a juice smoothie on roids. While not overwhelming thick, the tropical flavors have no bitterness and just an unbelievable taste. What a combination of flavor that can be very hard to find. 
M- carbonated and flavor piercing, heavy mettle feels fantastic. Not enough can be said about the feel and mouth watering experience this causes. Most drinkable 9.3% brew ever
O- maybe tree house juice machine could battle this but not even Julius can compare. This tropical profile is the literal depiction of a juice bomb. Trillium literally created a profile that is not easy to duplicate. One of the best DIPAS that I've ever had in terms of a tropical brew 1,308 characterslovindahops, May 11, 2016

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque golden orange color with a small white head. Leaves some nice cobweb lacing. 
The aroma is pretty tropical, with notes of mangoes and pineapple. Also get a slight green pepper aroma. Mild amounts of citrus. 
If Mettle is a juice bomb, then this is a juice apocalypse. Sweet orange juice, grapefruit, mangoes, honeydew melon, and peaches are all thrown into a blender. A blender made out of pineapples. There's also a touch of bitter pine on the finish. Has a decent caramel malt backbone that's subtle but present. 
The feel is medium bodied with moderate-at-best carbonation. Very creamy and smooth, and the alcohol is nicely hidden. No lingering bitterness to speak of. 
Overall, an excellent DIPA that does everything Mettle does, but better. It's fairly well balanced and despite being the juiciest thing since Beyonce's ass, it's not overly sweet. Just a great, great beer. 898 charactersScaryEd, May 06, 2016

Looks a heck of a lot like orange juice. Love the aroma but find it a bit lacking in intensity. I get citrus mostly in the form of tangerine but there is some grapefruit there as well; I also get supporting notes of tropical fruits with mango most prominent. There is a hint of alcohol as the beer warms. Taste mirrors the aroma but the flavors are far more subtle. Nectarine, peach, mango, grapefruit, and subtle alcohol notes. Good mouthfeel, medium body, fairly soft mouthfeel. Overall a very good beer. I really enjoy this brew, it's very enjoyable but I found the aromas and flavors to be a bit subdued. 706 charactersmnj21655, May 04, 2016

S: Sort of a muddled malty and slightly fruity smell going on. Lots of honey and caramel malt, kiwi, light mango and orange. Nothing really pops here. It smells good, but a touch heavy.
T: Follows the smell pretty well. Lots of smooth and slightly bready malt with a rough pine backing. Caramel, light cantaloupe and a finish of honey and pine. Probably my least favorite of the Trilliums I've tried, but that's far from saying it's a bad beer. 545 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 17, 2015

S- mangoes, passion fruit.  basically trop fruit city. smells awesome but doesn't necessarily pop with as much intensity as it could.
T-fruit for days.  orange sherbet.  candied mango from trail mix.  mellon.  grapefruit flesh, peel and pith.  herbaceous and piney dankness follows the fruit and brings a soft but firm bitterness.  the fruit pops back up after only a second of absence, and joins the green aspects seamlessly.  they both linger for days as one overall flavor.
F- medium soft cream.  some heat but nothing to suggest 9.3  
O- fantastic stuff.  i don't usually fuck with +9% ipas but when theyre done right, theyre done right.  intense fruit couple with the right amout of green dankness.  the hops never clashed, and it never got sweet.  bomb shit 924 charactersmeson13, Nov 12, 2015

Appearance:  A two finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a pale yellow orange color with great clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Tropical, candied stone fruit, citrus, resiny pine, herbal, spicy, and floral hops followed by caramel and toasted malts.  Some alcohol in there too.
Taste:  Awesome hop flavor with balancing malt bill, light to medium bitterness, and light boozy alcohol.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium to full bodied, light to medium bitterness, a little boozy alcohol, and medium carbonation. 
Overall:  This beer eluded me for some time.  Not anymore and happy to have enjoyed it.  Looking forward to the next batch. 790 charactersFlounder57, Nov 07, 2015

S: Grapefruit pith, tropical citrus, dank/sticky hops, orange, mango and peach.
T: Immediately I detected a grapefruit like bitterness, but it quickly fades into a sweet orange like citrus. Very intriguing.
M: Medium carbonation, slight bitterness, dry and hoppy finish. 
O: The alcohol is hidden very well. Reminds me of a Hill Farmstead "Abner" a little bit. Pretty complex taste wise. Many different citrus/tropical notes can be detected and the fact that I can detect both grapefruit like  bitterness and sugar like sweetness in one sip is pretty amazing. 645 charactersMA_hops, Nov 07, 2015

Nose is a slap of resinous pine and lemon peel. Super dank characteristics that you don't see too often in Trillium pales. Tastes of ripe lime zest, some dried tropical fruits, and more of that resinous pine, almost leaves the lips a little sticky. Pretty dry, almost too dry but I'd rather that than it being overly sweet. Another quality offering but far from their best work, I'll take DDH anything over this in a heartbeat. 563 charactersVetsPackage, Nov 06, 2015

So many DIPAs tend toward heavy body and over- / unbalanced hop bitterness and you don't want more than 1 glass. This beer is nectar. Lovely, cloudy pale color with complex nose and light but lively feel on the palate. Finish is surprisingly delicate for strong IPA but flavorful and balanced. This is an exceptionally masterful ale from an exceptional brewery. Cheers Trillium! 470 charactersRichard46, Feb 06, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A: My idea of the perfect looking Ipa. Super cloudy pale yellow with a nice big white head on pour and amazing lacing. Leaves a trace all the way down the glass as you drink it.
S: Has a very fruity smell on the nose. I smell some orange,mango, and some pineapple. Maybe a little pine background and what i descirbe as dank. Only reason its not a 5 is the smell is on the weaker side
T: Taste reminds me a lot of heady. Tons of delicious fruits up front just like the nose. A little dank in there. Balanced by a nice bitter bite. Super easy to drink cant taste any alcohol. Only reason this isnt a 5 is because it doesnt have the best after taste. Heady still wins this category.
M: My idea of the perfect mouth feel of an ipa. It has the somewhat thicker amazing creamy feeling to it. But its still very easy to drink and very refreshing. Perfect amount of stickyness on the finish.
O: This is easily one of my top 3 ipas. Trillium has some amazing stuff, and the moutfeel of there beers is the best. 1,002 charactersGinjaSlice, Jan 21, 2015
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle shared by Curran tonight.
Pours a bright, radiant orange, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
This smells so bright, pungent, and aromatic- orange, peach, grapefruit, and mango, with a bit of weed and stuff.
This is one of the brightest and most delicious IPAs I've ever had. It's so juicy and sunny. So much citrus and tropical fruits- orange, pineapple, and mango galore, with a little bit of dankness on the back end. There's a small amount of bitterness on the back end, with very little malt character, a little bit of pale cracker on the end.
This is pretty thick bodied, with a creamy and pulpy mouthfeel, really just thick and nice, a good aspect of the 9.3% ABV. The other good aspect of the ABV here is that the alcohol is not noticeable at all- there's no booziness, whatsoever.
I like to say that certain beers are "next level," but I feel like this might be the most next of level of all the things that are next level. 960 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 21, 2015

Pours super cloudy bright yellow, hideous color, with a beautiful fluffy white head that sticks around forever. Sticks all over the glass. I have it a higher score than it might deserve thank a to the head and he fact that the overall wasn't high enough with the score I think the look of this thing deserves. Aroma of pineapple and grapefruit, a bit of pine tree, some sweet honey notes, but mostly just the tropical piney hops going on here. Flavor is nearly indistinguishable from pineapple grapefruit juice, in a good way. Lightly sweet malts but in a way that completely highlights the hop flavors with some light tropical sweetness to go along. Bitter up front and all the way through but in a way that is very smooth, supported by the interestingly creamy mouthfeel. Despite that creaminess, this is insanely light and drinkable with basically zero alcohol flavor. Dropped this way too quickly. Good stuff and definitely unique. 1,002 charactersBMMillsy, Jan 17, 2015

Very hazy yellow-orange, billowy head with good retention and lacing.
Smells like freshly cut pineapple, including the skin. Not the most aromatic IPA I've run into, but nice.
Very fruity.  Peaches, lighter notes of pineapple.
A bit low on carbonation, but clean with a long fruity linger and minimal bitterness.
TBH, I've been a bit disappointed with most Trillium IPAs, finding them to have something of a vegetal off-flavor, particularly as they warm.  This one, however, has none of that and is pure deliciousness.  I don't know if it's just a matter of being fresher, or being kept nice and cold by being shipped through Polar Vortex 2015, but this is legit. 686 characterskscaldef, Jan 13, 2015

S - Tropical fruit, passion fruit, mango, notes of citrusy bitterness on the nose, overall somewhat sweet smelling and delicious 
T - Taste follows the nose here with a huge blast of tropical fruits mango pineapple. Finish is more tropical fruits passionfruit and a nice piney bite.
M - mouthfeel is medium bodied surprisingly thick for a DIPA and perfectly smooth

I'm surprised how cloudy and murky this golden liquid is. The head is a foamy, chunky pale white bit that persists well and leaves a good deal of lace behind. 4.25
Bright floral nose, notes of pine and citrus. Tropical fruit emerges as well. Sweet, pungent and resinous. 4.25
Starts off lemony and acidic, almost has me thinking it's a sour, but then it veers into maltier territory and sweeter, tropical fruit flavors. 4.25
Creamy, spicy from the hops, and dry and bitter at the finish. It's a bit hot but ultimately smooth and drinkable.  4

Absolutely beautiful pour.  Pineapple juice color with a bit of haze that makes it appear to glow.  Decent, thin head.
Aroma is a blast of sweet tropical fruits.  I was actually pouring mai tais for guests as I was drinking this, and this beer smells a bit like the beer version of a mai tai.
Great, complex flavor.  Pineapple and mango dominate.  The relatively dense mouthfeel really brings out these flavors, and makes them sort of chewy.  There is a slight onion and boozy bite near the finish, which I didn't really care for, but it didn't spoil the experience.  That goes away quick and it finishes a bit sticky and sweet.
Very nice offering once again from Trillium. 738 charactersstonermouse, Jan 02, 2015

A: Pours a light pale/pineapple juice-like color, with a half finger of bright white head.  Very good retention and some streaks of lacing.  
S: Citrus (grapefruit, orange), dankness, rose petal, tangerine, a little light malt for backbone.  
T: Citrus, pineapple, dankness, some light malt notes (rye bread), with mild pithy bitterness on a long finish.  
M: Medium body and carbonation.  Feels soft, and alcohol is extremely well hidden.

Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft with mild carbonation. The flavor begins dank with notes of mango, grapefruit, and pine. Some malty sweetness appears in the middle. It finishes with a hint of peppery spice. Once gone the dankness and grapefruit lingers. This is one easy drinking delicious beer. 443 charactersWanderingFool, Jan 01, 2015

3.72/5  rDev -17%Really big tropical fruit nose with pineapple and mango.  Nice orange body with a big fluffy white head.  The taste is fruity on the front end.  You get juicy mango and some sweetness of citrus.  The finish is caramelized pineapple and booze.  The booziness intensifies as this warms.  The flavor is a bit disjointed for me, and the alcohol burn on the end got to me.  Nice scent and opening flavors, but the finish is harsh for such a large bottle of beer. 457 charactersPHBoiler, Sep 26, 2014

081814
Served in a snifter
The cloudy, glowing, peach colored liquid was topped by an inch-tall, creamy and bubbly, bone white crown. Solid head retention. Thick, streaky lacing coated the glass and lasted until the beer was finished. With time, the chill haze eased up and the liquid turned a bit more transparent.
Citrus notes dominated in the aroma. Candy coated oranges came through strong. Lots of tropical fruits as well. Hefty dose of mango. Bit of guava. Really bright, fruity and intense. Slightly dank and weed-like. Some peach and apricot notes were also apparent. As the beer warmed, papaya and apricot notes really came forth.
The flavor profile was also super hoppy and citrusy. Juicy with fresh orange notes. Some orange peel came through as well. Loads of peaches and apricots. There was a subtle tropical fruit presence. Touch of mango. The beer finished with notes of pine sap, ruby red grapefruit and a faint, rind-like bitterness. A hint of alcohol was detectible initially but it soon dissipated. All in all, immensely flavorful and remarkably well balanced.
The mouthfeel was slick, rich, creamy and supple. A super fine and frothy effervescence gave the liquid a fluffy, tongue-blanketing quality.
As much as I loved this beer, it lacked some of the intensely bright, tropical aromatics and flavors that Mettle had the first time I sampled it on tap. Nevertheless, this is an outstanding double IPA that reminded me a lot of Heady Topper. 1,548 charactersDamian, Aug 30, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%750ml bottle dated 8/16/2014. Poured into a Lawson's snifter 8/28/2014 at 40F.
A- Dark hazy peach-coloured body, three finger thick, frothy cappucino-like offwhite head with very good hang time. Wispy lacing covers the glass. Altogether, the head is a real winner here. [4.5]
S- Pine-forward aromas mix in with sweet caramel. Smells fairly resinous. There is also a blast of tropical fruit, mango and some pineapple. For the most part though, pine and caramel are the predominant contributors. [4]
F- Delicious tropical fruit hops up front. Sweet mango, pineapple juice-like flavours, which start to mix in with some sweet caramel and tapioca making for a substantial malt backbone which never quite overcome the hops, which is just the way I like it. More tropical fruit and a bitter pine kick on the backend. Very smooth and well-integrated between the hops and the malts. [4.5]
M- Medium bodied, smooth and silky whilst striking the balance between dry and resinous, very much like Congress Street does. Finish is a pine and caramel smoothness that isn't altogether too bitter to keep you from continuing to drink it. Very easy to drink, disturbingly so for a 9.3% DIPA- it goes down like a 6% IPA. [4.75]
O- I came into this one expecting a good DIPA, thinking that this brewery's hoppy offerings can't be as good as that of Tree House or Alchemist, but you know what, this is excellent stuff. As I mentioned in my review of Congress Street, there's just something in the water in New England that makes the mouthfeel with just the right amount of softness that just enables me to gobble down the hops. Still, it could use more vibrant burst of hop aromas on the nose; that would make the beer that much better. I look forward to trying other Trillium offerings. [4.5]

4.75/5  rDev +6%A - 1.5 inches of dense, white head.  Great lacing. OK head retention.  Hazy, deep golden-orange body.
S - Intense citrus (grapefruit and lemon).  Some grass.  Pineapple/peach/mango.
M - At first a got a lot of fruit (pineapple, peach, and mango) with very little citrus.  Just enough bitterness to balance everything out.  As it warmed, I got a lot more bitterness and green onion.
M - A lot smoother than I anticipated from the smell and abv.  Low-medium carb. with a pretty clean finish.
O - Really drinkable and delicious double IPA though I found it most enjoyable 5-10 minutes out of the frig.  One of Trillium's best. 628 charactersAirBob, Aug 28, 2014

Pours a murky yellow (just how I like it) with a thock, white crown. Blobs and globs of lace. The nose is magnificent. Puréed fruit juice hops. Zesty, tropical fruit hops, passion fruit some moss and a tad if green onion. Chunks of mango. Very impressive. The hoppiness is incredibly intense. Starts with a huge passion fruit zap along with melon and mango. Guava. I believe they used Galaxy hops and they shine! Hints of grass and moss. Citrus and nectarine. Dry, pale malt. Fruit juice elixir. Hops are stunningly intense. Flavor lasts for days. Surprisingly not ridiculously bitter. Hop-oil feel. No booze. Sneakily drinkable. Trillium is vaulting into legendary status and this may be their best one yet. What a brilliant, modern Imperial IPA.

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%I think Mettle is one of the finest Imperial IPAs released in the last 3 years.  However, Heavy Mettle - while good - isn't on the same plane.
The beer is lacking for the same smooth IPA taste that Mettle does, but still goes down well.  Trillium has turned out some phenomenal beers - let's hope they continue. 312 charactersChazari99, Aug 21, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6%Bottled yesterday......
A - Hazy orange color with some excellent lace retention
S - Amazing citrus explosion. Grapefruits, oranges, mangos, limes. Just overpowering and juicy as anything
T - Follows the nose to a T. The galaxy hops shine here. They dominate this brew. You get the slightest grassy finish on the palate. The ABV flys under the radar. I could crush this brew but it's meant to be enjoyed slowly :-)
M - Medium body, medium carb, slightly bitter on the palate
O - As close to a perfect 5 as you can get. The only thing holding it back is maybe the slightest lack of balance as it's a huge citrus bomb. That's what I enjoy but in the context of a perfect DIPA, that's what I found to be missing. Whatever, it's incredibly exceptional. 753 charactersrjp217, Aug 20, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +4.9%Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a willibecher. This was bottled yesterday, picked up from the brewery an hour ago.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy, near-opaque honey/amber and leaves a full, two-finger white head, that lingers for a long time, leaving full lacing down the glass. (4.5)
Smell: Big mango and citrus hops, grapefruit juice, citrus rinds, a bit of grass. Super hop forward, refreshing, big aroma. (4.75)
Taste: Matches the smell pretty well. Starts with big bitter hop flavors, moves to juicy citrus + tropical hops flavors. Some malts in there to round it out. Really big flavor. For such a big IPA, the finish is wonderfully smooth. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium to high carbonation with a medium to heavy, creamy body. Quite a presence in the mouth. Finishes smooooth. (4.75)
Overall: This is a wonderful, big IPA. Really well crafted to give huge, smooth flavor. It's not syrupy or high in alcohol taste like some of the 9%+ IPA's out there. Definitely not for the new-to-IPA's drinkers. Tons of hops in here. (4.75) 1,030 charactersResuin, Aug 19, 2014
