Poured into my usual  wide mouthed tasting glass. What a pour!  An orange copper color with a nice white lacing across the top. Not really a head. No leftover residue on the glass. It's like a pine tree up one nostril and an orange tree up the other and a pineapple shoved down your throat.  In a good way.  To graphic?  Very well balanced with all of the scents and tastes you should expect from an imperial IPA. I feel it's best temperature is chilled, but not to cold (45-50). It's one of my top tastings and that's  with 25 years of experience in the beer business. A proud offering. 677 characterswaterski, Mar 21, 2017

Pours very clear copper. Bright white head good lacing and retention. Citrus rind, mango, piney aromatics. Fantastic hop flavor. Bright refreshing and not too strong on the bitterness. 
This is really good and best of all very drinkable. Both this and head hunter are top notch fresh.
Also, this is very similar to dirt wolf. 344 charactersJimmys, Mar 11, 2017

Taste: upfront you get that sweet bready malt middle of the mouth you get some citrus fruit orange rind tangerine grapefruit zest in the finish you get a nice sweet candied peach but you also get a nice pine needle and floral hop biterness to balance out the sweetness.
Feel: medium body moderate carbonation. The 9% abv isn't noticeable at all.
Overall: In a craft beer world were NE IPA'S are king this beer holds its own. This is a great west coast IPA. The malt and Hops complement each other beautifully. Yes I still think NE IPA'S are better but if you ever want to know what a west coast IPA is supposed to be then try this. You won't be disappointed. 744 charactersMasonz223, Mar 09, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle dated 1/30/17 from prager62.  The beer pours a very clear, amber color with a small white head.  The head dissipated leaving nice lacing that coats the glass.  
The smell knocks you back with intense citrus hops.  There is grapefruit, orange, and some nice pine resin in the back.  As it warms some peach begins to come through.  
The taste follows nicely with tons of grapefruit and orange and a pine resin that's just enough without being overpowering.  There is a little sweetness that appears as it warms.  
The mouthfeel is smooth, medium carbonation, and slightly oily.  
Overall a really great DIPA that nicely balances citrus and resin.  I understand the love for this beer. 707 charactersjvgoor3786, Mar 07, 2017

This beer pours beautifully clean golden orange with a foamy sudsy bone white head that leaves a good ring and sticks well.  In your face with dank pine and citrus the second the cap pops off the top of the bottle.  You can smell that this is gonna be resinous and sticky!  The flavor burst with that same citrus and pine, and a good amount of sweetness to keep the wonderful bitterness just in check.  Feel definitely has that sticky richness to it.  Nice carbonation, good medium full body, and bitter as hell.  Overall, this is my kind of DIPA, and wish it were more readily available and accessible out here.  Cheers! 633 charactersLingenbrau, Mar 03, 2017

4.26/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my pint glasses, this beer is a clear, medium golden/copper color with lots of streams of little bubbles fairly rapidly and continuously rising to the beer's surface.  Has a creamy looking, slightly tan/off-white head that's well over an inch thick when first poured that settles to a thick, creamy surface layer of foam with very good retention, a thick ring of foam lining the inside of the glass, and good lacing.  Aromas of slightly toasted caramel malts that gives way to big citrus, cantaloupe, and piney hop aromas.  The taste is pretty much the same, with some slightly toasted caramel malt sweetness along with the aforementioned big hip flavors of citrus, cantaloupe, and piney hops with a decent bitterness.  Good balance overall here.  Has a slightly crisp, mainly smooth and frothy, medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  Has a very clean and slightly dry finish.  A good beer all around.

Pours clear golden orange with light head and tremendous lacing
Aroma is citrus up front,  biscuit malt in the background.  You smell the citrus 10 ft away from the glass.  
Taste is perfect sweet hoppy IPA blend.  Very well done fat heads
Not typical creamy juicy mouthfeel I typically prefer in an IPA.  But solid and appropriate for style.  
My first ever fat heads beer and I have to say very impressive.   I look forward to trying more in the not too distant future 526 charactersjcflorian, Feb 25, 2017

Flavor is full of resin flavor; sticky hoppy flavor with hints of fruit and a hint of a toasty backbone. Feel is smooth, sticky and medium-full bodied with a medium carb level. Nice to revisit after the NE IPA craze. 331 charactersstephenjmoore, Feb 18, 2017

Taste was excellent, a little pine not to bitter followed by citra and a hint of orange. 
Feels pretty smooth went down easy and i could drink several, and still enjoy every sip as much as the first. 
Overall an excellent beer! Fat Heads does it again, if its your style you might even prefer it to the world class Head Hunter IPA. 461 charactersLeoherrmann9, Feb 15, 2017

Has an innocent enough appearance, its yellow, plenty of clarity, white head 3/4".   The aroma pops huge, grapefruit and tropical.  Taste is a super dry malt, light affair, with massive impact from a plethora of hop varieties and quantity.  Just wow.  Not even that heavy of a bitterness either.  
This is a world class hoppy beer, hides alcohol well too without the use of any sticky caramel like malts. 492 charactersrodbeermunch, Sep 16, 2016

4.06/5  rDev -8.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Received a growler of this last week. 
A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice crystal clear copper hue with a one finger white head that fades slowly to leave thin wisps and really no lacing at all.
S - Aromas of very light malts light fruity hops, faint sweetness, nice citrus peel and flesh. Very juicy hops. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose. Fair amount of pine bitterness, very light sweeter malts, the citrus is a bit more astringent than juicy (like the nose). The bitterness lingers quite heavily. Hardly any alcohol presence. Really missing the citrus and 'juiciness' that the nose had though, as without it the beer just tastes, well, like a generic aggressively bitter DIPA.
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, alcohol is hidden very, very nicely. Creeps up on you.
O - Overall this beer confused me a bit. It's one I've wanted to try for probably 5 years now, but, what I'm drinking isn't really what my mind's eye envisioned. The nose was pretty solid, but, the flavours just didn't jive as most of the juicy citrus simply was lost to the malts and aggressive bitterness. I would certainly like to revisit this, perhaps in a bottle, to see if that changes things.

Appearance: pours a orangy-amber body, with a super sudsy and lingering head. Leaves tons and tons and tons of lacing. Mostly translucent, perhaps a little bit of haze in there.
Aroma: grapefruit and citrus mostly, little bit of sweetness. Juicy hops dominate.
Taste: following the aroma, it's mostly citrus and juicy hops, though there is a little bit more sweetness than I'd prefer, though this is a heavy DIPA so that's to be expected....flavor-wise, I got grapefruit, orange, and some pineapple. Lots of bitterness on the finish too.
Feel: full-bodied and creamy, with a super smooth finish.
Overall: a really good, super-hoppy IIPA! 713 charactersTheElectricOne, May 10, 2016

Taste is an incredible mix of juicy hops with loads of tropical flavours, some light residual sugar notes and some floral finish with almost no bitterness. Body is full with good carbonation. Wish I could have access to this beer on a regular basis. 388 charactersPhyl21ca, May 09, 2016

A clear light copper with a dense, white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pungent and dank with pine, weed, grapefruit pith, orange juice. Malt character is minimal. The palate opens bitter and pungent with pine, grapefruit, weed, resiny and dank with a pronounced bitterness. Minimal sweetness is present.  The mid palate has more oily bitterness and pungency. Butter and oily on the finish, this is a light bodied DIPA that's delicious. Recommended. 493 charactersDefenCorps, Apr 17, 2016

Foamy white head with a fair amount of lacing left behind. Juicy citrus, resin, and tropical hops with a dab of honey. Really powerful aroma. Yum! Pine and resin hop notes right off the bat in the flavor. Super juicy, incredible citrus and tropical hops behind. Nice and balanced and leaning on the sweet side. Mouth feel is full and filling. Slightly harsh carbonation on the back end, but otherwise great. Overall, a juicy, hoppy IPA that doesn't singe the tongue with bitter hops. Leans a little sweet and is easy to drink. Might be a bit dangerous with that combo at 9%, so be aware!
Served in a 12oz snifter. 683 charactersHarrison8, Apr 01, 2016

(L) It has a clear amber hue with a slightly off white one inch thick head. 
(A) The aroma is pleasantly fruity and piney.
(T) There’s some citrusy caramel malt back bone, and lots of pine, grapefruit, tropical fruit, dankness, all very well balanced. Normally I would think 100 IBU is too bitter for me. Well, the 100 IBU is all there but it is a very pleasant dank “topnotch IPA” kind of bitterness.
(F) Despite the IBU it’s smooth and crisp and I did not notice the high alcohol level. It is very juicy and easy to drink too fast. It is a top notch Imperial IPA in my opinion. 646 charactersThomas_Wikman, Mar 30, 2016

Smell is mango, marijuana, papaya, tangerine, pine pitch, and some grapefruit. 
Mouthfeel is large for the style, moderate carbonation which is perfect in this case, maybe a little dry, and excellent drinkability. 
Overall this is one of the most dank beers I have ever had and as a former pot head I know dank. Thanks @WesMantooth for this amazing overall DIPA. 583 charactersSawDog505, Mar 28, 2016

Smell: I get some tropical fruit and citrus initially, some earthy dankness, and with a swirl some malt sweetness and possibly alcohol. 
Taste: citrus, slight tropical notes, and a stronger malt base than expected. There's some resinous notes prevalent in the second half. 
Feel: Medium mouthfeel, with good carbonation, and a slight bitterness in the finish. The mouth isn't as drying as I would expect. 
Overall: I received this as an extra, and I would say I would take it as an extra, but not request it. The hop profile isn't as juicy as I would prefer, but is a nice double that covers the alcohol well. 762 charactersCfred371, Mar 28, 2016

4.12/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Crisp clear amber body bordering on having an orange-itude to it. Small tight white head recedes to it's corners and colonies fate. 
Nose is rich and juicy. Tropical fruits meet with juicy citrus and a bounciness that is almost reminiscient of bubblegum.  I get that in a lot of big multiple-IPAs and I've never been 100% on where it comes from. Huh. 
These same trappings of juicy sweet fruits dance blithely over a brutally bitter core of primarily pine but a sprinkle of citrus pith. These two bitter cornerstones intermingle through the finish growing and dancing in and out of one another through the last lingering aftertastes. 
Tiny pricks of carbonation are abundant helping to usher in the sweet prelude and mask the bitter seriousness held underneath. Medium light body but clean and crisp. 
Another fantastic Ohio brew from the ever-generous @WesMantooth and his BIF #3 box. Thank you!! 901 characterskemoarps, Mar 27, 2016

S - bright juicy tropical fruits up front. Heavy on the guava and mango. Some light pine in the back. 
T - dank pine up front, but not the dreary morbid kinda dankness. More of a cheerful fresh resin punch. Sweet bubblegum and citrusy caramel. An absolute TON of hops. Hits hard from every direction. Monster pine notes, but also lots of balancing juice. The 100 IBU hides itself quite nicely until the very end, leaving a puckering bitter lasting impression. Hot damn. 
F - definitely feeling the high alcohol. Low on carb and high on viscosity, but somehow isn't syrupy. Well done. Fluffy and smooth. So pleasant. 
O - this beer has it all! Juice, hops, flavor out the wazoo. Many different stages and all of them are awesome! 856 charactersagreenman19, Mar 21, 2016

Feels crisp and refreshing.  
Overall - might be one of my favorite imperial IPAs I have had. I wish it could find this in the DC area as I would buy it often.  Great offering for beer geeks who love a hoppy citrus offering but still balanced and complete.  Have 2 left and can't wait to drink them. 589 charactersJay_P22, Mar 19, 2016

Taste was very hoppy/piney with the slightest sweetness. Taste stays with the pallet for a lil bit. This is everything I want in a DIPA. Fabulous. Hard pressed to find a better aroma/flavor combo. 295 characterssenglish7, Mar 18, 2016

        Smells like a smattering of both citrus and pine hops, with a solid malt backbone. Not really picking up on the higher ABV on this alone.
        I taste a very pleasing blend of the hops mentioned above, with even a small floral hop note arriving mid-palate. All in all, I'm getting a general "tropical" profile going on that is rather enjoyable and easy-drinking. The higher ABV is very well-masked by the hops.
       The mouthfeel I'm getting is medium-light with mild carbonation.
       I'll choose to give Hop JuJu Imperial IPA - Fat Head's Brewery & Saloon an overall 4.75. I've had my eye on this brew for a while and am glad to have finally experienced how great it truly is. Definitely give this a go! 933 charactersCaveworm, Mar 11, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into IPA glass - nice foamy white head, solid retention, darker amber color with near crystal clear clarity.  Minimal lacing.
Nose is big huge DIPA - rather typical but spot on hitting lots of, if not all, the notes.  Tropical, juicy, citrusy, piney, oniony...
Flavor follows and is a great mix of just huge crushing hops.  I like this - I love this really.  It's not one note, it's not a mishmash.  It's huge and delicious.  Its closest analog to me is Stone's Enjoy By.  Both are spectacular and hit pretty much exactly the same notes.  
Feel is big, brash, drying, and lingers long on the bitter as the juice fades away.  Would definitely love to have more. 670 charactersoldn00b, Mar 09, 2016

smell - tropical fruit, maybe mango, grapefruit scents.  piney and resin.  Smells strong!

feel - medium body and carbonation
Overall - yummy beer but I think the best part about is the smell. 327 charactersdrdiesel9483, Mar 04, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Fat Head's Hop Juju is a beer I have been waiting to try for a while now. It won Gold at the Great American Beer Festival in 2013 AND in 2015 for the Imperial India Pale Ale category, which was one of, if not the most crowded category in the entire competition. This 12 oz bottle was bottled on 2/12/16.
The pour is a copper amber color, with excellent clarity and a large, two finger thick tan head that compacts tight, and slowly recedes with time. The lacing is incredible on this. Very sticky...
The aroma is filled with tropical juice notes, and hints at pineapple, honey dew melon, passion fruit, ripe strawberry, white peach and sage. There is even a little garlic after it warms a bit.
The balance of this beer is impressive. There is a bitter, resinous finish which coats the mouth with hop oils, and that helps keep the honey-like fruity malt flavor in check. There are a ton of flavors here that work well together, with hints of tropical fruits, honey, pine, melon. The carbonation is perfect, (slightly sharp, more effervescent but not like a Belgian ale) helping to keep this heavy hitter moving along across the palate, and making this beer dangerously drinkable.
I'm very impressed by Fat Heads right now. They really created something that rivals the best IPA's in the world. The beer is drinkable, well-balanced, delicious, and insanely aromatic. I can't even imagine what could be possible with a food pairing for this beer. 1,447 charactersMusicaleMike, Mar 03, 2016

When I first opened the bottle I was blown away by the aroma. It is super tropical with almost a candy scent to it. I poured it into my treehouse tulip and the appearance is absolutely beautiful, deep gold with a finger white head and good lacing. The taste follows the nose with tropical fruits and just a hint of pine resin on the back end. Mouthfeel is slick and oily like a dipa should be. Overall this beer is simply outstanding and ranks right up there with any of the great ipas out there. I wish we could get this regularly here where I live. Very well done! 676 charactersCTpilgrim, Mar 03, 2016

A: Big danky piney, citrusy, tropical hops upfront, light malt sweetness and a bit of alcohol 
A: light orange/yellow color, totally clear with a white head of bubbles that has decent retention. Lots of lacing in the glass.
T: Lots of piney/citrusy/tropical hops upfront, moderately light malt sweetness with a surprisingly juicy finish. There is a moderately light hop bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Bit of alcoholic warmth is noticeable on the finish
O: The hops are always the star when it comes to DIPAs and Fat Heads doesn’t disappoint. This was one of the first IPAs that have a juicy finish. While I now tend to drink beers with less piney hops, this one is still pretty tasty! 724 charactersPhil-Fresh, Mar 01, 2016

The resin comes to the front in the taste, but it doesn't linger unforgivingly on the palate like a 100+ IBU beer can. I've heard people compare this to Pliny (in terms of characteristics), and they're not wrong, but the two beers are more like cousins rather than siblings. The hop profile doesn't strike my personal tastes as squarely as they could, but I get the love for this beer. Well done, Fat Head's! 513 charactersemalc, Feb 27, 2016

Thanks to @RayOhioFelton for this one.
Pours a golden hue with minimal to moderate head.  Not much lacing.
The nose is like a punch in the face.  But a punch in the face from the fist of God after she has been harvesting hops from her garden. 
A trinity of Juicy Citrus and Tropical flavors explode in your mouth like the second coming.  Or the first.  You wonder where the bitterness is hiding behind those 100 IBUs.  It never appears.
Thick mouthfeel, but not like the honey thickness we find in the East Coast cans.  Minimal carbing.  
A delicious smack to the taste buds.  Go get some. 641 charactersTertullian007, Feb 24, 2016

Pours a light caramel-brown body, two finger offwhite head with great retention and splotches of lacing. Smells simply wonderful, with a major grapefruit and citrus overload wafting out of the glass. A dry caramel sweetness, mild grainy cereal. Flavour follows, with a hunk of grapefruit, some lemon zest backed up by caramel sweetness that is nevertheless a bit dry and not enough to balance out the juiciness. Which I'm never going to complain about. It finishes with a zesty bitterness balanced by the sweet caramel. Nicely done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, good carbonation, finishes slightly dry, substantial body with a bitter zest and sweet caramel combination. Overall, a very tasty double IPA with a lot of grapefruit aromatic hops. Wonderful. 819 charactersStevedore, Feb 23, 2016

Nice, deep, clear dark orange color but doesn't pour much of a head or leave much lace. This one smells like a papaya pooped hop nuggets onto a mango. Huge dank hop and tropical fruit notes. So pulpy! Notes of pine resin, grass and tree sap with a heavy dose of cane sugar, mango and papaya towards the end. This one's almost all malt with a light sprinkle of sappy hop bitterness throughout. Really quenching and easy to drink and the ABV is hidden very well. Dry finish on the palate really brings out the hop bitterness that squeezes the palate. 
I'm really impressed by Hop Juju. Thought this one would be good with all the accolades and it really came through as a winner! 756 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 21, 2016

The aroma is piney, fruity and dank all at once.  It's like a pine tree had a beautiful baby with a mango tree.  Taste?  Man, this is good.  Like the smell, this delivers a swirling bouquet of fruit, pine and an underlying dankness.  There's a bitter aftertaste and finish but the way these flavors are all balanced is remarkable.  For an IPA, it's a bit on the fuller bodied side and carbonation is medium to low.

It's not the pure West Coast style IPA that Head Hunter is so I don't know that  it's totally fair to compare them, but this one would easily be my favorite.  In fact, I'd say this is right up there with any of the more well-known, higher profile IPAs from the West Coast and Northeast.  Explosion of smell and taste.  Only knock on this is that it isn't brewed more often... 1,139 charactersSHDoyle, Feb 20, 2016

Pours a dull amber with a full white head.  Small amounts of lacing coat the glass.
Aromas of grapefruit, pine sap, tropical fruits, come through the nose.  
Amazingly balanced hop profile.  Super dank, up front with a great juicy resin finish.   
Full bodied DIPA, clean, crisp, and perfectly carbonated.  
Great West Coast DIPA brewed in the Midwest.  Can't get enough. 437 charactersbrian44556, Feb 20, 2016

Nose is floral hops, orange blossom honey, fresh grapefruit, juicy fruit gum, crusty bread.
Taste is full, nutty, bitter, meaty, with honey and bubblegum and dry-roasted almond and green grape.  It has a long, mild, pleasantly bitter/sweet aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is creamy, with mild carbonation and some oil slickness.  Incredibly drinkable.
Overall, this is full of flavor, and delicate for being an imperial IPA.  It's a must-try if you can find it. 548 charactersdorianmarley, Feb 20, 2016

Smell is amazing, one of the most pungent, fruity, dank beers I have ever put the sniffer to.   Taste is just as good, this beer is no joke. If this beer doesn't rank in your top 10 for IPA's of all time then you should stick to coors light. 328 charactersSultan-of-Suds, Feb 20, 2016

Brilliant beverage that is quite fleeting during its annual release unfortunately! 282 charactersJascrutch, Feb 18, 2016

Pours a clear honey gold, white head is a quarter inch thick and retains well.  
Smells of bready malts, honey, and pronounced piney and grassy hops.  The hops are very fresh and intense.  
Tastes of honey and biscuit malts with fresh hops over top.  The hops run the gamut of flavors; citrus, pine, passion fruit, and grassy bitter.  
Body is full with stinging carbonation.  
Excellent DIPA, one of the best I've had for sure.  Up there with Dirt Wolf and Sculpin.  Must-try for fans of the style. 511 charactersCylinsier, Feb 18, 2016

Has a really nice finish that's really well balanced for 100 IBU's. Leaves a great resiny hoppy aftertaste.  Overall this is fantastic. 369 charactersStevem68, Feb 12, 2016

3.99/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25Clear sparkling perfect amber, with a very large and active frothy head that retains for a while, but does dies off to nothing.
Dank peach on the nose, vanilla orange cream, fiery pine, hints of biscuit grapefruit and lemon zest. Regardless of what your own personal experience brings, this is one of the most powerful bouquets of aromas you will find in a beer.
Peach and orange candy lead the flavor parade, and quickly recede to pine with some diametrically opposed notes of allium and starburst. Citrus and tropical fruits, pine and earth, all present, all powerful, and none overtaking the other. Bitterness is sharp, forceful and right on the edge of abrasive, woody and dry, yet somehow refreshing. It is powerful, but it goes well with this beer, and it wouldn't be Hop Juju without it. As it warms I even get some floral notes, maybe rose, and some alcohol heat.
Effervescent yet somehow hefty on the palate, finishing semi-dry.
This beer easily hits all the notes it lists on the bottle, with gusto. It has nothing to hide, and pretends to be nothing it isn't.
Most recently enjoyed 2/16/17, out of a six day old bottle. 1,135 charactersSabtos, Dec 17, 2015

The beer pours a golden amber color with great head retention and considerable lacing.  The nose is impressive, as you pick up a huge aroma of tropical fruit, dank weed and pine.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, and while this is certainly an impressive DIPA from Fat Heads, once again the noticeable booziness, coupled with the tropical fruit and pine, is just a bit off putting.  Frankly, it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small glass of this beer, for all that it's an impressive hop bomb with great drying bitterness on the finish otherwise.  
Maybe it's a style thing, but good as they are, I always find myself having a hard time enjoying these Fat Head DIPA's.  Be that as it may, undeniably, this is an impressive DIPA from FH. 810 charactersJohn_M, Nov 03, 2015

A - Pours a neutral amber in the glass, slightly hazy with a short cap of off-white foam that leaves webby lacing on the glass.
S - Sweet malt base with notes of caramel, piney hops, some orangey citrus, bit of booze.  Nice.
T - Big beer, lightly noticeable alcohol presence.  Clean bitterness at a controlled medium level that seems a bit subdued for a beer of this size.  Resiny hop flavors of pine, a bit earthy and mild citrus.  Nice balance to this.  Hoppy, but not a total hop bomb either.
F - Rather full bodied DIPA, thick, sticky and resiny hops.  A bit syrupy in feel.  Carbonation is at a lower level.
O - Really solid and well balanced DIPA.  It feels big and has plenty of hops, malt and booze - all well proportioned and integrated nicely.  Not over the top in the hop department so some may be disappointed, but this is pretty damn tasty to me. 909 charactersportia99, May 20, 2015

Thankful for a chance to try this, thanks to a trade with a friend, although we had to postpone the date, so lost a month (my fault).  Trader indicated this was better fresh, which is not a surprise.
Pours a nice lightly copper-tinted golden, with the lightest haze and a moderate head.  The head fades, but comes back with the agitation of every sip.
Hate to use this term, but smells like a typical DIPA.  There is a tropical sweetness, malts hitting more than expected, and the alcohol is present.  Papaya and melon, and a grassy or lightly dank bitterness is noticeable.  Very interested in how this would have come across a month or more ago.
Taste has the characteristics of the nose, tropical malts and a dank side, both stronger than expected from the nose.  The flanked are bold even at this age, body pretty full.  Candied papaya, but of spice and mint bite with some alcohol.  Cantaloupe sweetness comes as the spice dues, but so does a bit of wet grass and pine notes.
This particular pour ended up being an even see-saw, as it hit heavy on both the sweet and bitter (lasting feel is quite dry, piney).  Reminded me of a stronger version of a 90-minute IPA.  The alcohol showed a bit more than I'd like, and the bittering agents had a slightly metallic side to them, which I get sometime with older hoppy beers.  Can at least see the potential, just need to try again to see if it's realized by this brew. 1,455 characterscjgiant, May 13, 2015

A - The brew pours orange amber with a full finger of off white head.
S - Strong hop aroma with grapefruit, pine and slight melon.
T - Strong hop flavors that follow the nose.  Lots of overpowering pine and grapefruit.  Mid palate is has a touch of malt but not enough to balance this beast.  On the aftertaste its all bitter, pucker up hops.
M - Smooth brew with medium carbonation.
O - A bit over the top for this cat.  Cheers! 470 charactersfitrock2112, May 08, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A strong pour only gets about an inch of light tan head.  Head fades to a rim skim in about two minutes.  Body is classic golden honey in tone.  Nose is big and juicy with tons of citrus just bursting to get to you smeller.  Almost like smelling hoppy orange marmalade.  Zesty and bright as the flavor jumps on the tongue.  Strong grapefruit tones are mixed with piney, prickly notes.  This is a very bold beer with a powerful bitter bite all throughout the body of this beer.  This is really a hop lovers dream just a bitter blizzard on the taste buds.  Only drawback for me is that the alcohol is just a tad bit hot, but not at all off putting.  Wonderful overall. 666 charactersSPLITGRIN, Apr 28, 2015

Smell: Bready hops on the front, spices like garlic and earthy tones are present amongst soft citruses. Smells almost like a wild ale in certain respects, without a tart presence. 
Taste: Similar to the head, the hops come full frontal attack followed by the spices you find in the head. Orange and resiny malts finish the flavor off with a last sucker punch of hops to round out the double style. There is a funky aspect to this beer that is deliberate and adds to the character of the beer in a very endearing way, but is definitely not for everyone. That earthy funk in the back of the nose is present on the tongue in a more subtle, intriguing way. 
Feel: Medium viscosity, with a hint of heat from the ABV making its status as a double IPA known. Very pleasant without being overbearing or undrinkable. 
Overall: A great twist on a classic style. I understand the popularity, but I hope it is in part of its unique characteristics. There are alot of potentially abrasive flavors present that manage to work with the style and incorporate themselves seamlessly. The earthiness gives way to a clean finish in a way that I wouldn't imagine possible as a beer enthusiast that does not brew himself. Very good and worth trying to get a hold of 1,297 charactersYeahRightt, Apr 12, 2015

Appearance: Pours a copper orange color with 3 fingers of an off white head with good retention and lacing. Body is lightly hazy with quite a bit of fine suspended sediment.
Smell: Grapefruit, sweet tropical fruit, mild pine.
Taste: Bitter grapefruit, citrus, pine, hint of mango and some residual sweetness. High bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Fuller end of medium bodied with a slightly sticky feel. Carbonation is medium. Mild boozy warmth in the finish.
Overall: Nice double IPA. Not the greatest, but worth trying. 562 charactersJonada, Apr 09, 2015

This beer was bottled roughly 46 days ago. (2/12/2015) The malts have become more prominent in this beer I'm assuming than when it was a few weeks old. A very, very good DIPA. If I lived in , Ohio  or.had this uber fresh, I'm positive my score would have been higher and the hops brighter. 
I'll re-review when that happens. 398 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Mar 29, 2015

A:  Nice burnished copper body with a three finger head that likes to linger with some lacing.
S:  This is just straight papaya.  Like a goddamn fruit salad.  Tropical Island in a glass.
T:  Tons of flavor from tons of hops.  Surprisingly balanced but still a ton of pine and resin, especially on the backside.
M:  Perfect level of carbonation for this beer.  Just a bit of fuzz that just tickles the tongue and spreads the flavor.
O:  100 IBUs and 9% ABV goes a long way.  This one produces some delicious burps.  Pick one up! 606 charactersgillagorilla, Mar 20, 2015

Aromas are big and bold bringing tons of tropical notes, light citrus and pine.  Taste starts slightly sweety, hoppy tropical notes, mid palate citrus and light pine.  Finish is bitter with juicy resinous hop sting.  Little sticky on the mouthfeel with a medium body which carries those hoppy resins over the palate.  Super juicy DIPA which blends the whole spectrum of hop flavors.  I've never had a bad Fat Head beer. 510 charactersHopBomb515, Mar 15, 2015

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, passion fruit, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon/orange zest, citrus rind, pine, light caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of bright citrus/tropical hops and light-moderate malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying or astringent bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky/resinous mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA style. All around outstanding complexity and balance of bright and juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate malt flavor; and very smooth and crisp to sip on for the big ABV. An incredibly delicious offering. 1,604 characterssuperspak, Mar 14, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Very clear, active, golden amber brew. Topped by a decent snow-white head, with great retention and leaving nice flat fields of lacing.
Super resinous hoppy aroma!  Pine resin, dank notes, pepper, and a touch each of juicy tropical fruits and citrus peel. No malt beyond a light, grainy cracker scent.
Flavor is just as balanced and complex as the aroma: citrus and tropical fruit and peel up front, along with wildflower honey, pine resin, and a bready maltiness (that had eluded me in the aroma); super dank, resinous, and flowery finish with a touch of pepper.
Very slick, active mouthfeel, minor sting, medium bodied, with a fairly long, oily finish. Lasting bitterness, leaving a kiss of citrus peel and herbs along the gums long after the taste has otherwise faded from the tongue. 9% ABV carries some heft, without sacrificing drinkability.
Wow, this is really an impressive brew, reminiscent of PtE in many ways. 924 charactersRoguer, Mar 12, 2015

I find it very difficult to rate this because I have never had this much "gushing" to do. I really don't want to come off as melodramatic or like I am a fanboy, but this one just floored me. 
Okay, looked like a beer dream. Clear, golden and just the right amount of bubble swimmers joining the most picture perfect DIPA head I've ever seen. Solid 3/4" of slightly off-cream fluff that lent itself to definition perfect lacing. 
The aroma and taste are so similar that they become one thing. Fruity, piney and just the most delicate amount of sweetness to balance out the muted grapefruit bitterness on finish. Wow.  I cannot put to words the majesty of the taste this has. I can only describe it as very similar to the fist time I had Hopslam (like 5 years ago maybe?) only without the cloyingly sweet aftertaste. And drinkable? No heat whatsoever and for a big beer, I could just gulp this like water. 
I've yet to try Pliny, but based on every other DIPA I have had, this one has no peer. 1,083 charactersgopens44, Mar 10, 2015

A: very light amber color with perfect clarity nice head that slowly drops down into a small ring 
S: beautiful tangerine rich pine softer lemon and a little spice with some grass 
T: such a beautiful mixture between piney and super fruity with a nice spiciness and malty crackery finish 
M: fairly light with a little bit of syrupy ness 
O: This beer is so good it's an over the top DIPA it's so fruity with a great pine presence and a nice slight spice kick to it. I do advise to drink thus at a touch colder at complete room temp the booze tries to sneak out a little. 609 charactersSomethingClever, Mar 09, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5APPEARANCE (4.5) - A honey amber of perfect clarity with half a hundred tiny, tiny bubbles crawling sleepily toward the top of the glass at any given moment. Upon a measured pour I drew half a finger of foamy, white head in a tight configuration of a myriad of those same infinitesimal bubbles. Clumps of chunky lacing clung to the edges of my tulip as I gulped this beverage down (and I indeed I did crush this magnificent beast maybe a bit too quickly).
SMELL (4.5) - A gorgeous melange of honeyed malts meets pine, orange peel, lemon zest, and green grass. The smell leans more toward the malty side, maybe like an extremely hoppy American Barleywine, but don't let that fool you...
TASTE (4.75) - She starts strong with exotic fruits and a flash of sweetness, has a long caramel malt/orange peel/orange dreamsickle middle, and finishes dry with a bit of green grass, a touch of grapefruit, and a blast of pine. Delicious.
FEEL (5.0) - This is the standard from now on for where a DIPA should be with mouthfeel for me. Big, full, but medium bodied rather than heavy and syrupy; wet and creamy up front, with a drying finish that keeps me coming back to guzzle down some more.
OVERALL (5.0) - This is just the most balanced, most polished DIPA ever to grace my lips. I had it last year, and loved it then, and this year tastes identical. I don't know why it took me this long to review the beer, but let me simply say - Fat Heads, please, never change the recipe for this beer. You nailed it. First try. I have had DIPAs I enjoy more, but they've had imbalances here and there. This is a thoroughbred with no faults and plenty of standout awesomeness. Cheers! 1,665 charactersBradenMK, Mar 04, 2015

And I honestly can not think of a better beverage to sip as I read a good book before bed. I am giddy with girlish  glee. It's like sparkles and stickers and ponies and shit.

The smell is intoxicating and the hop flavor is perfect. 262 characterskrossoverking, Mar 01, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is beer is simply remarkable.  For me it captures everything a DIPA should.  The color is vibrant golden red (found myself gravitating towards as if I was a bug heading into a bug zapper.
The nose on this beer was like being hit in the face with citrus orgy (everyone was invited; pineapple, passion fruit, grapefruit, mango...ect). Just absolutely the perfect smell for an IPA lover.  
The body was silky smooth with a nice thickness to it, but maintened a good temp and feel thought the glass.
The taste was piney, citrus and just the right of bitterness.  For being a 100 IBU it drank like a 60 in the hop forward portion.  The perfect amount of malty goodness I am sure kept this big IPA from being liquid hop juice, but nonetheless, the hop and malt and sweetness all balance out very well.  
Hands down one of the best beers I have ever drank.  Comparable to heady, pliney, surly abrasive or hopslam.  I bought a case and brought back home.  I'll have to see the bottle taste since my experience was draft and the brewery. 1,037 charactersYettie911, Feb 27, 2015

Bursting with flavor and aroma complete with every juicy fruit imaginable creating fruit scents and flavors that I didn't even know were possible.  This beer is nearly flawless.  Could not put it down, nor could I remove it from my nose.  Simply perfect.
Edit for 2016 version: still the best beer I've ever had. The scent could not be more impressive and the taste is unreal. I could bathe in this beer. 445 charactersBisco42, Feb 26, 2015

3.66/5  rDev -17.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75A: [3.50] Pours a caramel color.  There is very limited head on the pour.  After a few seconds it is just a ring on the edge of the glass.  The bottle has a date code that I can't figure out - but I know that it is only about a week old!  Bottle lists the ABV 9.0% and IBU 100.
S: [4.25] Tropical fruits.  Oranges, pineapple.  Some pine.  Big nose on this one.  
T: [3.25] The taste deviates a little from the nose initially.  I am getting quite a bit of bitter up front.  After the initial bitter bite I get some of the tropical flavors.  The tropical flavors are just not hitting front stage like I hoped.  I read another review (I rarely do this) but the nailed the flavor "oniony".  That is it exactly.
M: [3.75] The body is smooth and creamy with that bitter bite on the after taste.  The alcohol is well hidden.
O: [3.75] I went to Cleveland hoping to score Chillwave (my favorite Imperial IPA) but it is not out yet.  I got directed to Hop Juju by the forum.  I expected really big things and I am a bit disappointed.  It is decent - but it is not Chillwave.  The bitter notes just club everything else down so none of the fruitiness is on the tongue.  They hid the 9% really well - but that doesn't make up for the one note on the tongue.  The nose gave me such high hopes - but alas the scents on the nose didn't hit the palate. 1,341 charactersfscottkey, Feb 24, 2015
4.46/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle poured into stemless wine glass.  Bottled exactly two weeks ago (2/9/15).  Purchased on a recent visit to Pittsburgh, $13.99 for a four pack.  
A - Pours a bright copper with a scant eggshell head.  Wisps of foam paint the glass as I drink. 
S - Huge tropical hop and pine aroma, more intense than any IPA I have ever smelled.  Pineapple, tangerine, and papaya all come to mind.  Brown sugar malts balance the hop assault.  Extremely inviting aroma.  
T - Tastes of dank, ripe fruits with a nice piney backbone.  It has that pungent, almost onion-y flavor that I have found in few others.  A hint of sourdough bread hits midpalate.  It has a honey sweetness which compliments the big oily hop flavors well.  It doesn't quite live up tot he aroma, but it is still in an elite class.
M - Slick, medium-thick body with the perfect carbonation.  The alcohol is remarkably well hidden.  I put this bottle back a little bit too easily.
O - I was stoked to happen upon this beer in the grocery store in Pittsburgh.  I ad the pleasure of trying it on draft and out of the bottle and I much preferred the bottled version.  It has a distinct blend of flavors, more complex than most of the other world class rated double IPAs.  The aroma is among the finest for any beer I have ever smelled.  At $14/4-pack I am glad I didn't get a case, but I probably should have gotten two four packs.  I highly recommend this beer, if you can get it! 1,446 charactersNoLeafClover44, Feb 24, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A bright copper-orange color. Very clear. A big foamy off-white head that dissipates soon, but leaves a film and some spotty lacing behind.     
Smells extremely pungent. Big, bold tropical fruits and line, spicey/pungent hops, and caramel malts. 
This beer smacks you in the mouth. Spicy hops, bitterness, musk melon, mango, more bitterness, fermented pineapple and red grapefruit juice, pine, and a honey like sweetness. Everything and the kitchen sink here, yet all balanced. So, so juicy. 
Lip smacking, sticky resinous medium body. So easy to drink. 
This is not only one of the undisputed top 2 ipas in Ohio, but one of the best in the country. Like many Fat Head's beers, it is not for the timid though.  An amped up Pliny the Elder. 744 charactersWesMantooth, Feb 23, 2015

Color appears very clear light amber with a 1-2 finger head that slowly subsides.
smell: citrus up front with orange, pineapple and grapefruit.  piney and almost spicy backbone (maybe some pepper notes).
This one is an animal in your mouth.  All the varieties of hops hit you at the front.  citrus to pine to bitter.  Definitely the most well versed hop heavy beers I've ever had.  Truly fantastic. 
Feel: decent carbonation and leaves you with an aftertaste because of the piney hops. Nothing overwhelming.  Bitterness hides the ABV quite well.
Overall:  Glad I snagged a 4-pk. First time trying it and will definitely buy again next year.  I wasn't overly impressed with HopSlam a few weeks ago but this is a top notch beer! I'm new into brewing myself so I can't specify the different hops by their taste yet, but this beer really makes you think about the different varieties of hops and how they play a role in the beer.  Well done, well done! 989 charactersChris33, Feb 20, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The beer comes in a light ruby/rose color, very clear.
The aroma is brilliant of orange, mangoes, pineapple with an underlying resinous pine, some dank cat pee, and a touch of onion and garlic.
On the flavor, the beer hits of mangoes, peaches, sweet pineapple, along with blood orange, tangerine grapefruit, with a smack of candy sweetness. Then onto a full bittering of resinous pine. A touch of spicy hop character as well.
The malt bill reminds me of a Stone Enjoy By, Sucks, etc. It's very much what the West Coast puts out. However, the beer is wonderfully crisp, and clean, with a hidden sweetness. No sense of alcohol.
Dangerously drinkable. One of the best in its specific style of DIPA. 699 charactersdar482, Feb 20, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: Hazy orange-amber color with a two finger off white head
Smell: As i popped the cap off the bottle i immediately knew this would be a world class beer. Right away I got huge super fresh, ripe pine aromas with a undertone of bright fruits. In the glass its more equal parts pine and bright tropical and citrus fruit along with a hint of sweet bready malt. Theres also a touch of that spicy onion aroma that burns my nose, which i get in a few Stone and Lagunitas beers for example. I thought Head Hunter had a perfect aroma, but this is otherworldly.
Taste: Yup, this is very nice. A smack in your face melody of pungent pine and bright fruit notes. I get a blast of fresh pine upfront but quickly transitions into super vibrant tropical/citrus notes. Its danker than any other DIPA iv had, and a citrus aftertaste lingers forever in a day
Mouthfeel: Id say this is heavy bodied as it really coats your mouth with a resionous feel. The bitterness carries on well throughout the aftertaste
Overall: I love head hunter and it is my go to IPA, but this right here pushes the style to another level. JuJu has the most dank, concentrated, resionous pine and tropical/citrus fruit hop aromas and flavors iv ever experienced. The lingering citrus aftertaste and bittering makes for a wonderful experience and a sip goes a long way. I can also grab these bad boys off the shelves within a week of bottling. This is one of my highest rated beers on here, and for damn sure my favorite DIPA. Fat Heads may very well brew the greatest IPA/DIPA one two punch in the country. 1,577 charactersBone53, Feb 19, 2015
4.76/5  rDev +7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5L: Poured into a standard pint glass. A slight dark amber (burnt sienna color) with carbonation slightly rising through the sides of the glass. Small white head (1/8 inch max). The color is outstanding.
S: Citrus along with the citrus family in it, lemon, tangerine and blood orange. Some mango and maybe passion fruit (for me at least). Very fruity…hint of bitters, the type you put in an old fashioned.
T: Taste like it smells, the pine kick comes into play and the citrus flows through. Heavy on the bitter citrus…but it flows like someone tried to smooth down a grapefruit into a sweet tangerine, with some pine (if that makes sense).
F: The body is medium with light medium carbonation, the carbonation is low so you can taste the different citrus characters in it. 
O: The heavy bite of citrus has made me love this beer, it's a hopheads dream. 858 charactersDon_Quixote, Feb 19, 2015

Poured a 12oz into the Spiegelau with a clear, golden amber body and a fluffy 2 - finger eggshell head. Nose hit me from a foot away. Big pine, orange, and a mess of juicy, sticky aromas that might defy the norms. Hint of dank, astringent aromas. BIG ASS PINE followed by a grapefruit/stonefruit pucker. Ample bitterness. Tremendous hop explosion. Strong enough malt presence (never overpowering, but present) and some noticeable booziness with some time in the glass. Medium body, slick finish, lingering pine, clean as hell. So right. Did I mention it was bottled 8 days ago on 2/9/15. Oh Fat Head's... you've done it again! 659 charactersMikus, Feb 18, 2015

Muted grapefruit dominates the flavor, with pithy bitterness offsetting the modest caramel malt sweetness. That savory Amarillo comes through. A little bitter for my liking. Overrated, in my opinion. The flavoring hops are too one-note. 341 charactersbarczar, Feb 14, 2015

3.3/5  rDev -25.7%BOTTLE: 12 fl oz size. Brown glass. Fun label art. Branded orange pry-off pressure cap.
I got this from Duff27; thanks again, man! 9.00% ABV. 100 IBU.
Served cold. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. Expectations are extremely high as this is currently #87 on the Top 250 list. Reviewed live as an imperial IPA since the label refers to it as such.
HEAD: Over one finger in width. Off-white colour. It's appealingly smooth and even, with a nice full thick consistency and attractive creaminess. Appears soft. Not as frothy as it could be. Leaves no lacing as it recedes. Head retention is good - about 7-8 minutes.
BODY: Mango with orange and copper hues. Average in vibrance. A biteen hazy; there's some oiliness to the appearance but it's still transparent and translucent. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Overall, it's an appealing appearance for an imperial IPA, and isn't the usual boring copper colour of most beers in the style. I'm looking forward to trying it, and don't notice any obvious flaws. Definitely an above average appearance for the style.
AROMA: Fruity hop character dominates the hop profile. Mango, tangerine, citrusy esters, citrus zest, a kiss of grapefruit, seemingly balanced tropical fruit, nectary character, and a kiss of pine. 
Sweetbread. Pale malt. There's enough sweetness to balance the hop bitterness, but I worry it'll be too sweet once I get to the taste.
No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable.
Overall, it's a pleasant aroma of above average strength.
TASTE: Yes, the sweetness is a bit overpowering - or at least imbalanced - for the style. Pale malt and caramalt sweetness mixes with sweetbread, lending it substantial sweetness.
The hops can hardly compete. Hints of pine, some tropical fruit (mainly mango, but perhaps some tangerine), citrus zest, plenty of resins, and a hint of apricot.
The caramel feels out of place.
FLAVOUR INTENSITY: Moderate.
FLAVOUR DEPTH: Medium.
FLAVOUR DURATION: Average.
Amplitude of flavour is nice; this is a cohesive flavour profile with an interesting atypical build, but it's certainly not gestalt.
It's far from the most complex or intricate beer in the style, and doesn't boast much subtlety, but I do like it. The resiny and nectary hop notes are a highlight.
TEXTURE: Sticky, smooth, wet, lightly oily, and medium-bodied. Unrefreshing. Thickness is apt - enough to support the flavour profile without going overboard. It's a filling beer.
Not gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
Overall presence on the palate is nice, but not ideal. This texture suits the taste generally well, but doesn't feel tailored specifically to it. It's a bit overcarbonated.
OVERALL: A likeable imperial IPA which hides its ABV well and doesn't go for the increasingly boring grapefruit-emphatic hop profile. I've never been big on the tropical fruit approach to imperial IPAs, though, and I find this a bit lacking. More commitment to the nectary and resiny hop notes would be lovely, as would a bit more bitterness to even out the balance. I'll enjoy finishing this glass, but I definitely don't think this lives up to its current 87/250 position on the top beers list. Worth trying, but far from world class. Certainly drinkable.

4.44/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25I gave my rating awhile back, but I figured I needed to put the notes on this as well. 
2 - 12 oz short Broan bottle with a fantastic green label done is awesome Fathead's fashion. Poured into a Nonic style pint glass.
A - glowing golden light orange colored body that just screams deliciousness. It just looks like it's gushing with flavor. Head isn't massive, but still a grand display and lasts throughout leaving plenty of thin stick rings all around the glass. 
S - this smells like a dream. Almost insane like. Juicy fruits wafting all over this aroma. Pineapple, passion fruits, mango, and a big pile of ripe pineapple hug the pine resin hops like lovers on some exotic beach. The malt backbone and big fruit aromas blend so well together and I can't describe this as sweet but it's just so Damn spot on its unbelievable. 
T - just a continuation of its great aroma. Pineapple, passion fruit, gushing mango, pineapple, lime, and a hit of pine resin all flowing as one sticking the taste buds with gushing notes of fruitiness and hop oils. It's so ripe and fresh yet just enough dank character to magnificent. Breaded malt lays a superb backbone and Juju is neatly balanced. 
M - big bodied but smooth. Thickness is exceptional and texture is out of this world. It's drinkability is scary while it's balance is the stuff of legends. It just cakes the mouth in complex fruitiness and ripe hop notes and never really shifts you into that boozy, bitter feeling. 
O - JuJu is so Damn delicious and I recommend it anyone that loves dipa's. This is as good as any beer I've ever had. It's not running close like so many these days, Hop JuJu is running beside the great ones. I sure hope I run across this one again, soon.

A - Dark orange color with an awesome sticky lace that permeates the glass. Great looker
S - Nothing too special here. I get a malt bomb with some mixed in pine and maybe the slightest of grapefruit
T - Pretty much as the label describes... tropical up front, malt and pines in the middle with a nice bitter finish. Hop profile is difficult to identify. There's a great spectrum of flavors here.
M - Light to medium feel, mild carbonation, smooth off the palate
O - Not quite "World Class" in my humble opinion. This may have to do with the unreadable bottle date. If it's a little older than that explains the malty aroma. That's really the only thing holding this back from being another notch above. Overall, a fine DIPA 758 charactersrjp217, Jun 21, 2014

Very well blended imperial/DIPA.
Hints of citrus, piney flavors abound with a just right sweetness to a balance the variety of hops used in this recipe.
I found the beer golden in color and slightly cloudy. The beer poured very well with a decent head of foam to release the flavorful aroma.
Mouth feel was medium to full bodied, and satisfying.
Glad I grabbed a 4 pack to bring back with me and share with friends. 505 charactersEMB1960, Jun 05, 2014

Appearance: It has a nice deep golden/orange color to it. It has a nice thick off-white head that dies down moderately slow and leaves nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints dank pine resins, tropical notes (citrus, grapefruit, mango and pineapple) and some sweet caramelly malts. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has loads of bitter pine resins, tropical notes (citrus, grapefruit and pineapple) and some sweet caramelly malts to balance. 
Mouthfeel: It has a medium carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel.
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. 640 charactersSebD, May 12, 2014

Golden apricot in color, with a rather short cap of off-white foam.
Aroma-Big heady whiff of piney, resinous hops
Taste-Upfront sweet malt, quickly counter balanced by a big dose of piney resin-infused hops, leading to a rather dank finish. Nice drinkability for the strength. Well-balanced and tasty. 363 charactershosehead83, May 04, 2014

A- pours a hazy but bright golden-orange color with a two-finger creamy and frothy white head that retains long after the pour, eventually leaving some thick patches of lace behind upon settling
S- lots of tropical fruity hop aromas up front with notes of pineapple, mango, guava, melon and grapefruit juice. Piney resin kicks in, followed by an underlying malty sweetness that gives a slightly doughy bready notes on the back end, finishes with a hint of fresh mint leaf 
T- blast of tropical fruity hops hits the palate up front with flavors of pineapple and guava, raw piney resiny flavors kick in mid-palate with notes of fresh cut grass and mint. Sweet and bready malt underlies, adding just a hint of alcohol, leading to a fruity finish with citrusy hops dominating the palate
M- medium body and medium prickly carbonation leads to a chewy and creamy mouthfeel with a silky smooth finish, just a touch of alcohol warmth on the linger
O- Head Hunter is one of my favorite IPA's, and this just became one of my favorite DIPA's. So many complex hop flavors, yet surprisingly drinkable, maybe too drinkable. Will definitely seek out again. 1,184 charactersTreyliff, May 02, 2014

Appearance - Deep orange. Small white head. Leggy with some sticky lacing. Wispy surface.
Smell - Grapefruit and herbal hops. Smells kinda dank. Deep caramel.
Taste - Brighter hop flavor. Orange hops. A little herbal, but much less. Builds into a grapefruit bitterness. Caramel maltiness, but not too sweet.
Mouthfeel - Medium body, pushing medium heavy for a DIPA. Bitterness balances the residual sugars.
Overall - I wasn't blown away until I finished my pour and realized I had drank the whole thing before finishing my review. Greater than the sum of its parts. 607 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 29, 2014

Thanks to Reaser and Hodge for this one
App- This was more of a base looking IPA. Orange and yellows and a bit of caramel brown. A small 1 finger head that faded quickly and didn't leave too much lace.
Smell- This was a nice smelling IPA. A good balance was struck between the hops and a small amount of pine and malt. More like a west coast beer IMO. I liked the tropical notes and sweet I got.
Taste- I enjoyed this one. Can see why an award winner. A balance of sweet and tasty fruited hops with some mango, orange and tangerine with some bitter balance to it.
Mouth- A lighter medium body with a fairly solid carbonation behind it. The fruits remain with a little bit of pine/resin and alcohol.
Drink- I've been pretty surprised and happy with the fat heads brews I have had. This was no exception. Would like a couple more of these. 893 charactersFosterJM, Apr 25, 2014

A - I love the murky, dark orange appearance. Sticky lacing and head quickly disappeared into a thin halo.
S - The floral hops mix with the pine scents to produce a pleasant aroma. 
T - Just when you thought that you were going to get slapped by a cocky fat head, this brew steps aside and shows some respect. It isn't overpowering, it is balanced and full of flavor. It has a laid back piney, citrusy taste with a very light malt backbone. I sense a hint of alcohol.
M - It sits well in the mouth. Light, medium dense carbonation that fills the mouth.
O - This is almost a masterpiece, something is missing. I wouldn't consider this a 99 on BA. The mouthfeel and smell are lacking, and the taste is missing something intricate. I will say, it is definitely a contender. 
This almost reminds me of Double Jack, except it is missing the ultra smooth ending, is not as balanced, and is sweeter. I would drink this again if available.
Update - This year's batch is spectacular...(2015) 1,055 charactersmabermud, Apr 21, 2014

Doesn't strike me as overwhelmingly malty in its sweetness (which, for me, is good—brews like 90 Minute or even Maharaja tilt too much toward malt for my taste). Honestly, feels like it belongs more in the company of Undercover Investigation Shut-down or Bigfoot than your average IIPA—but then again, I'm more of a West Coast IPA guy, so fans of East Coast style might find this more familiar. Either way, pretty tasty. 515 charactersneurobot01, Apr 17, 2014

Look - Pours a hazy orange amber with a great soapy head that retains well and leaves tons of lacing.
Smell - Dank as hell, tropical citrus (mangoes, passion fruit, guava) with a side of pine. Absolutely phenomenal nose.
Taste - Malt gives this a great body for the rush of juicy fruit that comes in after and ends in a soft resiny sweet.
Mouthfeel - Almost heavy-bodied with low carbonation. Rests a resiny pine. Big beer with malt heat but super drinkable.
Overall - Wow, I can honestly say I haven't been this blown away by a DIPA in a long time. What a great surprise and what an excellently crafted brew. 100% recommend this stellar DIPA. 735 charactersJMScowcroft, Apr 16, 2014

This beer exceeded my expectations.
A - Beautiful golden amber on the dark side hinting at the alcohol content and flavor.
S - Before I tool a sip, I was greeted by outgoing tropical aromas. Sweet mango, apple, plum, citrus just pulling me in...
T - Deep tropical flavors that tasted fresh and sweet on my palette. It challenges on the front with sweet and tropical and on the back with a light syrup malt and fleeting bitter. This boys and girls is how a balanced Imperial IPA beer should taste.
M - Light syrup. It was enough to linger in your mouth but not thick like a triple can be. It was not as carbonated as usual but I think this was a positive. I noticed it but did not hate it.
O - This is a World Class beer. Drink it and you will see.
This met all my qualifications on what I consider a great beer. I would not change any part of it. 997 charactersJackTse, Apr 16, 2014

Pours a hazy, golden orange color, with a 1.5 inch head, and small streaks of lacing down the glass. 
Heavy hop aroma and taste here- not much difference between the two. Tons of tropical and citrus flavors, pretty sweet, undercut by pleasant but not overpowering bitterness. Orange, tangerine, peach, apricot, grapefruit, and pineapple are all noted. Just amazing. Not much malt noted.
Medium bodied, starts sweet, finishes bitter and dry. Crips, low but effective carbonation.
Second beer from Fat Head's- they are certainly a great brewery. 673 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 14, 2014

Sweet to hop bitter goes from 0 to 60 in .9seconds. Big bitterness on the tail end of each pull. Would guess this one at 9.5%, booze apparent.

Smell: lots of hops, mostly resiny and pine. subtler notes of citrus and spicy. there is some good sweetness to it.
Taste: opens up with a wide variety of hops. again lots of resin and pine. turns an almost juicy tropical hop before going to bitter citrus. great hop flavors but a bit too resinous for me
Mouthfeel: good medium body. some sweetness but huge lingering bitterness wins out in the end.
Overall: a good IIPA. fat heads seems to do good things with the hops but never quite hit it for me. Id prefer a little less resin and just a bit more juiciness. 675 charactersSportsandJorts, Apr 08, 2014

Bottled on: 03/06/14
Served in a snifter
Dark, hazy, glowing amber appearance. The beer was topped by a super creamy and bubbly, two-finger tall, off-white crown. The head slowly dropped to a thick, frothy cap. Patchy streaks of drippy lacing coated the glass.
The aroma was really hoppy and complex. Intense orange peel notes were immediately apparent. There was a strong, dank, weed-like presence as well. Lots of rich, caramel malt sweetness. Hint of grapefruit. Tropical fruits came through as the beer warmed. Guava and mango were detectible.
The flavor profile was solid but a bit more simplistic than the aroma. Citrusy hop notes hit hard right off the bat. The hops melded with rich, sweet, caramel malts on the front end. Loads of candied orange peel and juicy tangerine flavors came through as well. Intense, piney, resiny notes were also noticeable. A mix of pinesap and white grapefruit carried into the finish. Moderately pithy and bitter, with the bitterness lingering long after every sip.
The mouthfeel was a bit of a letdown. It was somewhat thin for the style. The liquid contained a soft, mellow carbonation that turned somewhat smooth and creamy on the palate.
Hop JuJu Imperial IPA is a tasty, balanced and overall enjoyable offering from the folks at Fat Heads. This is far better than their brutally bitter Head Hunter IPA. 1,411 charactersDamian, Apr 07, 2014

Poured from a 12oz bottle, bottled 02/24/14.
Pours a slightly hazy honey colored body with excellent retention. Some nice bittering hops mixed with fresh and juicy hops in the aroma. The flavor is awesome: real hoppy fruit juice, lots of citrus but also other fruit like peaches. Flavor lasts long, bitterness is persistent yet never overpowering. So damn drinkable as well; you would never guess this is close to 10%. Hands down one of the best IPAs have had the pleasure of drinking! 525 characterspapat444, Apr 03, 2014

A - Pours a light orange/amber color with a full 2 finger white head that retains and falls into a collar. Thick webbed lacing clings to my glass.
S - Big Citrus hop aroma that has tons of grapefruit notes, pineapple and orange. A nice sweet honey and bread aroma with hints of caramel round it off. 
T - Starts off with the bitter grapefruit with sweetness of pineapple and orange. Nice malt notes of bread, honey, and caramel to beat the bitterness back. The end is mostly bitter pine and grapefruit. It is superb. 
M - Medium body and carbonation with a good amount of lingering bitterness. 
O - To me this seems like a ramped up Headhunter and I enjoy it very much. I love th unique malt flavor of both Headhunter and Hop Juju; maybe it has something to do with the yeast? 815 charactersRi0, Apr 03, 2014

Aroma is exceptionally juicy and bright: mango,pineapple, and orange mixed with pine and herb.
Taste is also quite juicy, tons of citrus zest and piney resin, slightly sweet and delicious.
Medium bodied, well carbonated, good bitterness, some warming in the throat from the 9% but not really detected in the flavor.

The nose is delicious: ripe pineapple, oranges, pine resin, and tropical fruit. Thankfully, taste is not nearly as sweet as I was fearing from the nose. A very refreshing fruitiness quickly gives way to an intense but controlled bitterness, a bitterness that's in line with grapefruit rind but not overpowering.
Aftertaste is dry and bitter with faint traces of caramel; the beer's 100 IBUs definitely make themselves known here. Mouthfeel is fantastic: very juicy, nicely carbed, and almost chewy. Overall, I loved this one. Mouthfeel is where the beer really shines, and the taste has just enough sweet fruit to prevent the bitterness from being overpowering. A really well-balanced beer. 774 charactersblankenhoney, Apr 02, 2014

Pours a white, quarter-inch head, body is a translucent orange color. Lots of bubbles rising through out. Lacing was above average and head was thin but hung around awhile.
Smells of a tropical fruit cup, lots of mango, pineapple, guava, and lime. Bits of piney resin meld with some caramel malts. Not much in the alcohol area is detected.
First taste is definitely more malt forward than the aroma leads on. It has characteristics of a heavily hopped barley wine, a thick malt backbone with hits of pine and lime. Wish the hops would pack more of a punch, as they did in the nose. Alcohol is present but for almost 9% it drinks smooth.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Wish head was more present, it seems to have died a bit. Richness and bitterness of beer leaves a slight coating on the roof of the mouth while carbonation stings the tongue.
Overall this was a solid Double Ipa but I was expecting more from it considering its rating/awards. Malts covered up the bitterness too much and the head was abit on the weak side. Would drink it again but wouldn't add it to my top 10 IPA list 1,135 charactersangelmonster, Apr 01, 2014

The beer is bright orange with a thick, off-white head. The aroma brings a huge bouquet of tropical fruits, to include pineapple, mango, melon, oranges. Present alcohol throughout the aroma and flavor. The beer is a bit hot. Teeming with tropical notes. Heavy on the palate. While there are some nice things happening here, the beer is a bit brash and shows the alcohol too much. Still, pretty tasty. 442 charactersHuhzubendah, Apr 01, 2014

4.46/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A - Copper color, clear, with a light tan head that forms then fades quickly. Minor lacing.
S - Citrus and more citrus illustrates the powerful hop experience to come. Mostly grapefruit and orange rind, pith and a note of pine resin.
T - Hops all the way down. A slight hint of sugar and pepper, but mostly grapefruit and assorted tropicals (mango, pineapple), fading off the fruit and into the pith, closing with a chewy, resin-based pine bitterness that is significant. A big, big beer, but quite drinkable.
M - Crunchy resin with serious dry. Not a wrecker, per se, but this will leave a mark. Still, carbonation and malt keep things in check and the result is easy to tip back. That it clocks at 9% ABV is not at all apparent until you're in real trouble.
O - I love this beer - an excellent DIPA without the funkiness that can sometimes crop up. Lovely fruits, and the pine finish is bold but not overpowering. 919 charactersTsar_Riga, Mar 30, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is hazy, golden-orange, sports two fingers of fluffy white head, and is loaded with floaties. The nose is not as pungent as I anticipated, but still quite assertive and dripping with fresh oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and peaches.
The beer has a medium-full body and loads of flavor. I get a surprising amount of bready sweetness up front, with lots of marmalade and honey flavors. The hops round out the flavors and provide a fruity, quinine-like bitterness, but do not rake across your palate. I get notes of grapefruit, tobacco, and apricots. No booziness at all on the finish as the hops dry things out and leave a lingering flavor.
Overall a good IIPA, but it's not the palate-wrecker I thought it would be. The beer has a bottled-on date of 2/26/14, making it exactly 31 days old as of this writing. I am somewhat suspicious that this beer is not what it used to be (and baffled that a retailer like Jungle Jim's in Cincinnati continues to carelessly store their IPAs at room temperature). Ordinarily, I wouldn't buy an IPA that old, but I was desperate to try this one. It's good, but far from great. I would love to try it again when I can get a fresher bottle. I have a feeling that some of the magic may be lost from this one.
Edit: It is now 2015 and this time I got 10-day-old bottles. Noticeably better. Scores have been adjusted. 1,403 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Mar 29, 2014

A- Amber orange with a very slight haze. Not much of a white head.
S- Super dank and bold in citrus. Very fresh and bold. Strong but in all the right ways.
T- Very strong hop presence at first. A slightly sticky onion flavor but this beer is huge on the citrus. A lot of grapefruit in this one, even has a lot of the puckering bitterness of a real grapefruit. Very much a west coast style. A hint of orange and lemon peel. The malts exist only to allow you to focus on the hops in this beer and thats OK. Any stronger and I might taste alcohol but its not there.
M- Very solid in feel. A strong lingering bitterness but its to be expected.
O- This is a world class DIPA, much like its flagship younger sibling Head Hunter. 762 charactersTwelveOunces, Mar 27, 2014

Smell - A big grapefruit aroma is present. There is also some earthy grassiness in the background. 
Taste - This is what an IPA should taste like. Grapefruit comes to the front and is pleasantly sour. A gentle malty background makes the drinker aware this IPA is well constructed. The sourness of the grapefruit lingers nicely in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - This is my second bottle of Juju and it is completely flat. It has the mouthfeel of a can of coke left out over night. The mouthfeel does not take away from the taste; it just does not feel right. Was there a problem in packing? 
Overall - I really like the taste. I would love to try a batch with carbonation. 775 charactersJohnnyHopps, Mar 26, 2014

It rises to one finger in height and retains about half of that for the duration of the session, leaving good webbing interconnecting the lace.
Let it never be said that Fat Heads is every shy with the hops. This one's big in both aroma and flavor with a mingling of the earthier, more elemental as well as the fresher and brighter. It brings lots of grapefruit peel and pine resin, very floral up front giving way to those elements, some sharp cheese in the middle, with the tang, bite and leathery quality of dried tobacco leaf rounding out an interesting complexity. It's a hop bomb for sure, but some bready malts and caramel add the balance it needs. It also has a lot of heavy dankness in it. Tropical fruits come in and draw out into the finish, where it seems the caramel goes a little buttery as it meets it.
The raw bitterness brings out a certain dryness, but it has a lot evening it out to semi-dry. The crispness bites moderately and for the long-term, while it remains smooth into the lingering, almost herbal finish. 1,141 charactersBrenden, Mar 25, 2014

The nose is an awesome hoppy bomb with tons of citrus, grass, and pine notes. There is a little malt sweetness for balance but it is very subtle in comparison to all the awesome. This beer is great. Not the best imperial I've ever had but damn close. Wish I could get it in Michigan. 512 characterslochef81, Mar 25, 2014

Pours an attractive orange amber with about a finger and a half pale head. A wispy coat and ring remain, leaving some nice lace. 
Smells of oranges, papaya, mandarin, perhaps a hint of strawberries and some malty sweetness. Really nice. 
Taste follows the nose quite well. Bursting with juicy mandarin, berries and papaya up front. Bittersweet notes of citrus peel, pine and pepper comingle with malty sweet biscuit, cracker and caramel. There's some dicernable alcohol but it goes down easy with such a brilliant combination of hoppy goodness and the pleasant malt backbone. 
Slick, almost syrupy medium full feel with modest carbonation. Long, bittersweet finish with resinous pine, citrus zest, slight fruit and a little residual caramel sweetness. 
A truly outstanding imperial IPA. Hop Juju is right up my alley with it's great interplay of juicy fruits, citrus, pine and sweet malts. An extra that has really put this beer on my radar. I will certainly be on the lookout more of this in the future. 1,185 charactersThickNStout, Mar 22, 2014

A: Pours a dark golden color, superb clarity, with a thin veneer of pure white head, fine bubbles. Above average retention but minimal lacing.
S: Fresh and bright flavors of tangerine and pink grapefruit, a little malt in the background, subtle floral notes. 
T: The malt is more noticeable now, balanced equally with the hop character (grapefruit and pith, pine needles, some mild floral notes). A little bitterness on the finish, but its minimal and provides some structure. 
M: High carbonation, slightly sharp, with a medium-full body. 
O: Very tasty, good hoppy flavor with minimal bitterness—just the way I like it. 677 characterspmarlowe, Mar 22, 2014

A- dark gold with a reddish tint. Very little head.

T- A lot like the Smell very sweet and fruity at the beginning the has a smooth bitter finish. Tastes great!
M- A bitter mouthfeel, but still pretty smooth.

A- dark golden amber. Little to no head but there is a good lace at the end of the pour that lasts.
S - it smells so amazing, so many fruits hit the nose. Tangerine, Lemon, grapefruit, and green apple. The piney hops are there but are very much behind the fruits to the point you have to try to smell the pine. A sweet honey malt sits blends with the fruits extremely well. There might also be a little wood. Such a great smell.
T - the taste follows the nose but the malt is much more noticeable. The hops are very strong but they aren't bitter. Instead they taste sweet with a fruit blend. The malt is a very well blended with the hops. a very delicious beer. 
M- A lot of bite on the back end. It's not so much a bitter bite but the hops hit hard on the swallow. Even though there wasn't much head the carbonation does feel really bubbly. 
O- a very very great beer. The fruits and the malt are amazing together. I will say that the taste falls a little short of the smell which really is the highlight of the beer. The only two better IPAs I've had are Pliney and Sucks. 1,119 charactersmlhyatt, Mar 21, 2014

12oz stubby bottle sealed with trademark fatheads pressure cap.
poured into HF wine stem.
Appearance: Translucent golden yellow bodied beer with an orange hue. 3 fingers of bone white head. Lots of lacing and great staying power from this hoppy beer.
Smell: oranges and tropical fruits. This beer smells like it might be fairly bitter. Grapefruit rind and super resinous pine. Slightly chalky and dank aroma. Hint of floral notes.
Taste: Moderate bitterness upfront that mellows out slightly at the end of each sip. Resinous pine is the first thing that hits your palate with a decent amount of grapefruit rind to match the pine's intensity. Lots and lots of chalky and dank hops in this beer; slightly spicy or perhaps peppery too. Juicy tropical fruits (mostly pineapples) show up for a moment in the middle of the flavor profile of this beer. Bready malts to help balance all those hops. The dankness and chalkiness are unrelenting, these qualities might be hiding some of those subtle complexities in this beer. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Really nice drinkablility with this DIPA. The mouthfeel is creamy and slightly dry. The hop oils in this beer seem to coat your palate heavily.
Overall: This is my favorite hoppy beer from Fatheads. It is a little bit better than Head Hunter. While this beer is just as bitter as head hunter is, the malts help to balance things out with those huge hop flavors found in the beer. I am a definately fan of this DIPA! 1,533 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Mar 20, 2014

Pours a glowing deep copper with a slight haze. One finger of dense, creamy off-white head eventually recedes to a thin collar with oily lacing. The way this flows into the glass, you can tell it's going to be big and sticky. Smells like a grapefruit tree making sweet love to an aromatic young pine in a field of wildflowers. Or so I imagine.
First impression on the tongue is slightly sweet with a bit of pineapple, mango, and orange. That doesn't last long, as intense pine resin rushes to the forefront. Sharp biting citrus chimes in, with more tropical fruit along for the ride. The finish is long and juicy, and leaves me feeling like I just bit into a grapefruit. As good as it tastes, the body really makes this beer for me. It's oily and coats the palate with all the bittering goodness the flavors have to offer.
The total package this beer brings to the table is utterly impressive. When I'm in the mood for a good kick in the teeth by a hop bomb, JuJu is nearly unrivaled. The way it packages big juicy tropical flavors with intense bitterness is a thing of beauty. 1,116 charactersglass_house, Mar 20, 2014

Bottled 02/21/2014, less than three weeks before the date of this tasting. About as fresh as you can get for a beer with distribution between states.
A: Pale amber, translucent, though the view is obscured by a layer of bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass. An eggshell-colored head of cream appears for a brief moment then disappears nearly entirely; no lacing.
S: INTENSE hops – dank, oily aromas are practically jumping out of the glass. It’s incredible. I could just sit here and pick apart the hop aromas for minutes at a time, but what’s dominant is apparent right away: a wonderful character of juicy fresh fruit, mainly strawberry, mango, and passionfruit, but with additional layers of stone fruit, cherry candy, citrus (lemon, pineapple), and just about everything else you need for a fruit basket. Wow. And malt aromas are evident, too, providing a backbone of mild vanilla.
T: What a superb hop profile. It starts with a quiet taste of resinous pine and tropical fruit and then builds…and builds…and builds. It keeps increasing in bitter intensity until it seemingly kicks into another gear, expanding into a spicy, Noble profile of fresh-ground pepper and leafy black tea. All the while, there’s this supportive, subtly sweet malt profile of candy corn and cracker underneath the bitters. They never take over but never leave the hops on their own – my favorite IPA malt effect. Toward the finish, the IBUs start to pile on top of each other, getting briny and finishing this one off crisp (well, only slightly sticky…crisp compared to what it could have been).
M: Though there’s nothing extraordinary about the texture here, it does have everything you want in a DIPA: a noticeable thickness without being syrupy and a creamy, interesting carbonation that’s not so forward that it enhances the already enhanced bitterness. In short: immensely drinkable. Plus, the bitterness ends up light; it doesn’t hang around long enough to make this any burden to drink.
O: I love this beer; I expected something awesome from the guys who made Head Hunter, and my predictions were happily confirmed. I don’t know my Head Hunter score by heart, but this has to be close to it. I’m not entirely sure which one I like better, but who cares – they’re both great.

Look- Pours a very transparent dark gold leaving a thick finger of soapy white foam. It slowly settles revealing moderate lacing. Tiny carbonation bubbles can be seen surfacing. 
Smell- Pineapple, passionfruit, mango, a touch of grapefruit and orange zest. That fresh rubber smell I get from certain hops is there too!
Taste- Succulent passionfruit, pineapple, grapefruit and some orange zest. There is a solid shot of floral notes in the finish along with hint of fresh rubber. 
Feel- Resiny slick hop oil with a touch of bitterness. 
Overall- I'm so glad this world class beer finally made it's way back to Indiana after a three year hiatus. This has to be one of the best Imperial IPA's out there. Just a tropical juicy beer that tastes like you're sucking on fresh whole cone hops. All that and it's transparent with no haze proving that good is good regardless the looks or fads. This should be brewed year round! 1,001 charactersPrager62, Mar 14, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25With the unmistakable "Citra" hop character- it appears at first sniff that the brewers at Fat Head's have sold their soul to the devil. Irresistible to hop-heads, this deeply resinous taste is accompanied with enough fruit flavor to make any punch bowl blush.
Its copper and chestnut body shines despite its mildly hopped haze. With ribbons of gold and amber, the ale casts a dense and heavily creamy blanket of foam to rest above its prism of color. As the ale fades, trails of speckled Brussels lace follow closely behind.
The nose is quickly seduced by the beer's heavy hop influence immediately- tropical, citrus and herbaceous aromas are vibrant, ripe, and bursting with their perfume. Highly floral, the undertow of malt offers up a caramel-dipped fruit scent while approaching a rich and nearly buttery tone while hints of chive and cannabis rise at first sip.
Its taste is crisp and savory as the beer's moderate caramel sweetness turns over to a vagrant hoppy middle- there's a salty-citrus flavor that butts up against a butterscotch pineapple medley. But then there's cobblered taste of apples, mangoes, apricots and tangerine that's all wrapped in an aura of leaf and pine. Its growing bitterness is greeted with mineral and sap to crispen and dry its taste with ease.
Resembling the classic American IPA as much as it does an "imperial" version, the beer's hop dominance easily overshadows its malt sweetness as the beer is drier than expected even from the start. What ensues is a short caramel and biscuit sweetness that dissolves off the tongue and ensures a sticky resinous finish of smooth warmth and spicy bite.
Hop Juju spreads around to all the hop-heads with a resinous and tropical taste that satisfies their "bitter-tooth" with utmost divulgement. Its fruit, herb and supporting sweetness hits home with fans of newer, stronger and fruitier hops. 1,876 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 14, 2014

Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a hazy orange color with a couple inch off-white head that stayed around a long time. There's also a lot of lacing. Aroma is great, the brew smells mostly like citrusy (orange peel, oranges, tropical fruit, melon) and pine hops, along with some caramel malt. I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some herbalness and apricot flavor along with a good bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and coating with moderate carbonation. I think it's a pretty good Imperial IPA, I'd certainly buy this again in the future. 650 charactersbluejacket74, Mar 13, 2014

What else can I say? The nose on this beer... Unreal! Simply the best nose I've ever experienced on any IPA. My brother has turned me onto the wondrous beers of fatheads and if they know how to do one beer right its IPAs!
Lets begin, as I said before its hands down the best nose of any IPA. I wish my house, car, work, heck that everywhere smelled like this beauty! It has strong citrus and fruity undertones. The hops come out strong on the nose, but nothing like the taste. The taste is a hop bomb citrus explosion that lingers in the mouth and throat leaving a resinous layer of hoppy goodness. We are so lucky to live so close to this amazing brewery and I cannot wait to see what else they come up with! 733 charactersTheRealist, Mar 13, 2014

Where this beer excels is the balance of malt and in your face hops while not giving off that blatant alcohol burn. This beer is fantastic. As a reference, I am a big fan of Heady Topper, Russian River, Three Floyds, Stone, Founders, and Bells. Fat Heads Head Hunter and Hop Ju Ju are just two reasons why Fat Heads is now a cult favorite. 609 charactersterrapinmark, Mar 13, 2014

3.78/5  rDev -14.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Big thanks to SteveOldrati for hooking me up with this. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears a dark burnt copper color, fairly clear with less than a finger of off-white cap that is quick to fade leaving patchy lace.
The aroma has a pleasant hop juiciness that mingles between fruity hoppiness and mild vegetative grassiness. Some cantaloupe and mellon feel come out with a mild alcohol accent. This brew kinda flirts back and forth between brilliant and just kinda meh. Strange.
The taste is quite bitter with a melon or dirty canteloupe-like yeasty and hoppy flavor. It is grassy and herbal with hints of pine resin and pithy pulp fruit and zest a bit like grapefruit. As it warms, a bit of maltiness comes out like burnt toffee. 
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A unique and enjoyable brew with plenty of hop flavor and bitterness. The malt is interesting in its inclusion but with hardly any sweetness. If given the choice, I think id rather have IBUsive or head hunter instead. Regardless, thank you Steve for the opportunity. 1,083 charactersstakem, Mar 12, 2014

Smells of citrus fruits, honey sweetness, and some floral/resin hop flavors. Taste is the same as the aroma. Smooth across the tongue, not overly bitter, but a bit sticky on the lips.

The hops are well-balanced with a chewy malt that gives the proceedings a nice solid backbone. Great beer. 321 charactersjjdc, Mar 12, 2014

The appearance is great, white, 1 inch head, semi-transparent light copper color with lacing all the way down. Smells like a mass of fruit, melon, grapefruit and random citrus, amazing. Taste is right there, super fruity and delicious. Plenty of carbonation but still smooth on the tongue. Better before it warmed. Overall this is prolly a top-five beer, right there with "Lunch", "Another One", "Sculpin" and the like of super fruity beers. Cheers. 596 charactersmjstacker, Mar 11, 2014

A - Clear caramel-orange with a 1-finger white head that fades quickly and leaves mild lace. 
S - Sweet hop bud floral and dankness, orange flesh, pine, light malt. Very inviting.
T - Boldly hop forward, like the smell, with pine, dankness, pungent herbal tea, pear, and sweet orange flesh and significant orange zest bitterness. There's a reserved dollop of caramel malt for balance, although not as much as Head Hunter. Finishes with significant lingering bitterness with a bit of fruit/malt sweetness.
M - Medium-high body and low-medium carbonation. Quite resinous, quite prickly, and syrupy without being cloying. 
O - It's big and bold and bad ass. I understand why it scored so highly in the DIPA category. I like it a lot but I like draft/cask Head Hunter more. In any case; Viva Fat Head's for another killer brew. 867 charactersTucquan, Mar 09, 2014

Pours dark orange/gold, slightly hazy with a small dense cap, almost a finger high. Good retention and the lacing is good as well.
Pungent and dank pine, dark orange citrus and overripe mango. The pine really takes a dark turn in this beer, masking the citrus and sweet bready malts very well. I find myself really dipping into the glass to get a good whiff though.
That's alot of resiny dank pine packed into one beer. The intial caramel/bready malt sweetness provides a good balance for the piney hops that overshadow a good amount of dark citrus and notes of hawthorn. Resiny mouth coating brings with it some heat and a large steady bitterness.
This is a hearty beer, medium body and carbonation but the oily and chewy texture that the hops add is really something else. Alcohol is present but well managed with the amount of malt and not as sticky as one would be led to believe.
These Midwest boys sure do make their IPAs different, about as resiny and chewy a beer out there. Yep, I can see why this got a GABF gold. Extra points since all the buddies that I shared this one with absolutely loved it. 1,160 charactersrawfish, Mar 08, 2014

Aroma of pine sawdust fresh from the chainsaw – wow!
Head average (3 cm), white, frothy, mostly diminishing to a 2 mm layer
Lacing like stalactites
Body orange, clear
Flavor of hops, citrusy, piney, maybe a little hemlock, no tropical fruit, no alcohol, no malt, no diacetyl

A- Deep amber with a small white head and medium-high degree of clarity. 
S- Huge bright hop aromas. Lots of dank, pine, perhaps the most "weed" smelling beer I've had. Lots of bright citrus, getting mostly tangerine. Some very light onion. 
T- Similar to aroma. Lots of smooth dank pine and citrus with some very light onion. The bitterness is very smooth. 
M- On the heavier side of medium. The massive hops take away slightly from it's drinkability for me, at least compared to Head Hunter. 
O- A great IPA. I would say that I still prefer the hop profile of Head Hunter. Was really surprised how dank it was but had a great citrus and medium level sweetness to it. Hope this becomes something they put out a few times a year. Ohio really puts out some great IPAs, more so than Michigan I'd say. 882 charactersPaulyB83, Mar 08, 2014

I love IPAs and DIPAs, and this is the best I've had, and maybe even the best beer I've ever had! The mouthfeel is perfect in regards to thickness and carbonation, the bitterness is perfectly complimented by the orange flavor in the taste, and this one is bold, but somehow reasonably balanced. This goes down incredibly easy even given the high ABV as the alcohol is masked. This is the beer I've been looking for.... 596 charactersDeFaz, Mar 08, 2014

I've also had this a few times on tap.
A - Clear orange gold with a finger of fizzy white head medium spotty lacing.
S - Lots of dank pine, and tons of tropical notes, mango, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, a little sweet malt trace. This a huge aroma, one of the best ever. Tons of tropical notes.
T - Huge flavor, lots of those ripe tropical fruits, sweet caramel malt, nice mild pine and grapefruit bitterness on the end. Very juicy and fresh.
M - For a beer of this magnitude its not overwhelming, you get a little heat in the end, but its pretty balanced. Kinda dry on the end.
O - Excellent Imperial IPA, similar to Hopslam, but I personally think its better.
EDIT: Each time I drink this I love it more, this is hands down one of my favorite IPAs of all time, Its about on par with every other epic hyped double IPA, and is for sure better than these over-priced exclusive whales out there. 914 charactersOmnium, Mar 07, 2014

S: Waft is juicy hops giving the aroma of exotic fruits - pineapple, mango, papaya. A bit of sweet malt, but this one has hops just jumping out of the glass. 
T: First thing that comes to mind is how deceptively easy this is to drink from the high ABV. A sharp bitter bite upfront is quickly calmed by the sweet pineapple and tangerine sweetness that lingers in the finish. A bit of lemon and mango flush through the palate as well.
M: Full body. Crisp. Clean. Refreshing. A small bite of boozy warmth, but not much. Moderately high prickly carbonation.
O: Rarely am I this blown away by something so simple, yet also so complexly masterful. The hops clearly dominate here, but it is such a clean and crisp beer. Just wow. A fantastic beer. 895 charactersJustin_Neff, Mar 06, 2014

The nose on this one is bursting with character. Strong initial citrus off the start gives way to a very thorough resin character. All of it tones down after a short while. The flavor brings a thick resin tone as well and it lingers in a very hearty sense, changing a bit on the way. Thick and meaty. This is definitely a hop lovers beer. But very much an east coast style one at that. 447 charactersRblWthACoz, Mar 04, 2014

A: Pours a glowing hazy ochre color with a thick one finger cream colored head. Ridiculous lacing.
S: Candied grapefruit, pineapple, mango, caramel and a light trace of pine. Sort of musty resin lurking in the back as well. 
T: Intensely hoppy but really well balanced. Opens with some tropical hop notes along with a smooth layer of caramel. Middle brings in some awesome pine hop resin that just claws over your tongue, but there's this velvety malt cushion that never let's the hops get too bitter. Finish gives just a hint of pine resin, but really just makes you want to drink more than anything else. This is incredible stuff. 650 charactersnotchucknorris, Mar 04, 2014

A - Pours a rich honey color that is quite transparent. A one finger, fluffy, egg shell white head forms and retains nicely. A good amount of lacing remains along the glass.
S - BIG HOPS. This one really screams that it wants to be a west coast IPA. Aromas of grapefruit, citrus zest, and some slight tropical fruits. There is a malt presence, but the juicy hops are what really stand out here.
T - Like the nose, the taste is huge in the hop department. Grapurfruit and mango stand out the most along with some other notes of citrus juice and zest. There's some very slight pine and herbal flavors in the taste, but this is a juicier IPA than it is an herbal one. Sweet flavors are met my a malt backbone, but it quickly falls into place as the hop bitterness and flavors take over.
M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a very slight bit of alcohol heat, but nothing much. There is a dry finish and a good amount of resinous oils lingering around the mouth.
O - Really enjoyable and MUCh better than I remember when I first had it about 3 years ago. Feeling luckier and luckier that Fat Head's is a 10 minute drive away. 1,299 charactersKAP1356, Mar 04, 2014

Served in a tulip glass
A - It pours a hazy ruddy orange color. An increasingly aggressive pour yielded less than an inch of off-white head. 
S - It's got everything I like in an IIPA. It is focused on citrus with a pine accent. I even get a little sweet malt in it. Some alcohol wafts from time to time. 
T - This beer has an intense citrus flavor heavily leaning on bitter grapefruit. The finish has just enough pine to make it great. The alcohol is not apparent in the taste. 
M - It is fairly full for an IIPA. There is some biting carbonation. 
O - I haven't had this beer in about two years. I was excited to hear about it being bottled. I was disappointed at the limited bottling. Luckily, I have a friend that is a regular at Fathead's, so I settled for a growler since he struck out on bottles. This is as good as I remember it being. This beer is worth the hype, and it is unsurprising that it is so highly rated and sought. They make Head Hunter for crying out loud. Great beer from a great brewery. 1,032 charactersbuschbeer, Mar 02, 2014

Rumors around the area had this one being available soon (I drive by the brew pub fairly often, so I should just have stopped in). After the award it won, I was pretty anxious to try it. 
The ale pours a very nice golden light brown, nearly translucent, very little head but nice lacing. The aroma is pungent, but not the most so. A bit of funky who knows what is mixed in with the piney hops smell. 
The taste is huge. Obviously it's a hop monster, but it also is sweet and nicely balanced. Alcohol is the last thing you taste - literally, the finish ends with a booze bitterness.
This is a really amazing brew. It is hard to believe that such an unassuming brew pub in a nice quiet suburban area is producing such amazing things. Well done. 781 charactersschoolboy, Mar 02, 2014

A - A crystal clear deep copper. Big 2 finger head with an off white head and soapy bubbles. Head dissipates fairly quickly. 
S - BIG aggressive nose. I get dank first with a touch of pine and citrus in the background. 
T - It follows the nose pretty closely except the citrus is overshadowing the pine. I don't think I've ever had a beer so aggressively hoppy. It's glorious. 
M - Easily the worst part of the beer. Aggressively bitter that lingers on the tongue with a super dry finish. 
UPDATED 2015: Bitterness is toned down and the body is much creamier. Much improved on the 2014 version
O - The nose and the taste are truly top notch but the very bitter finish is frustrating. It's the only thing keeping this beer from the truly elite of the elite. 801 charactersPSU_Mike, Mar 01, 2014

Bottle to tulip.
A. Dark copper. Poor clarity. Poured a slight egg-shell head that retreats to a rim. Small-spotty laces.
S. Moderate fragrance. Floral-citrusy hops. Light malts.
T. Strong malty backbone with mainly grassy hops. The hops certainly pack a punch. Minor notes of grain, dust, with some booze. Slight floral aftertase.
M. Moderatly smooth, high carbonation, full body.
O. A very nice heavy IPA. Not very crisp, but packed with lots of flavor. The 100 IBUs are appearent, which certainly impart the cloudy nature of the ale. I am not a hop head, so that does influence my lower than average score. Nice flavors, but the heavy nature of the malts and hops make the beer very thick. 735 charactersmacher0, Feb 28, 2014

A: Pours a very light golden with a faint hint of copper. There's a little over a finger of white head that leaves a lot of lacing. 
S: Huge punch in the face here. There's a very good balance in citrus, pine, and sweet malt, with the edge slightly going to citrus. There's some additional fruitiness to the aroma that I can't put my finger on, and man does it smell good!
T: Much like the aroma, very well balanced. The malty sweetness really punches through, and compliments the hoppy character. 
M: Carbed well, does not leave a dry aftertaste, and leaves me craving more. 
O: Hats off to Fat Heads on this one. We already knew they could make a great IPA in Head Hunter, but this one proves they can hang with the best. It reminds me of Permanent Funeral, which it edged out for gold, and after having both, I can't disagree. 893 charactersroger617, Feb 27, 2014

Smell: Sugar-coated ruby red grapefruit
Taste: Like the aroma, the sugar-coated ruby red grapefruit flavor opens and builds through the middle, the bitterness builds, particularly after the swallow; bready malt flavors linger, underneath, but the finish is citrusy, sweet and adds a mango and tropical fruity angle
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall: Perhaps a tad too much sugar for my palate, this is still a terrific DIPA with a distinct West Coast character

T: up there with the best of them. Am I ready to say better than Pliny the younger, heady topper or the like? No. But, it is definitely top tier and better than 98% of the dipas you could buy off the shelf. This has a dry piney hop flavor without the soapy taste that comes with too many beers in this style. The bitterness is strong but well balanced with the other flavors. A little grapefruit/orange in the middle with a predominately bitter aftertaste.
M: on the drier side which I prefer. A stark contrast to their ibusive which I had on tap. Could use a tad more carbonation though.
O: best new semi-local beer I've had since moving to pittsburgh last summer. 868 charactersglazeman, Feb 26, 2014

A- Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Voodoo teku. Brilliant golden/copper hue. About a finger of creamy off-white head with some nice retention. Lacing on the glass looks wonderful. This is really enticing beer.
S- SO MUCH DANK. Wow. Love the nose. Huge notes of pine and resin. Juicy fruits. Pear, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon chews. Floral, too. This is great. Love the integration of the aromas. Fruits step in and out, but the dank, piney hops are constantly slapping you in the face. Fantastic.
T- Head Hunter on steroids, with more fruity flavors. This beer is dry, and I LOVE that. Tons of pine and resin with wave after wave of hop bitterness. You get the juicy fruits mid-palate. But, the same as the nose, the bitterness and pine ride this beer the whole way down. No booze at all. I mean, it's really smooth. Easier to drink than Head Hunter... And I love Head Hunter. I'm thoroughly impressed. This follows the aroma remarkably well.
M- Medium mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Only detractor here is that it's a little too oily for my taste. Other than that, this has a great feel.
O- This beer is worth the hype. Wonderfully balanced and smooth. I think Fat Head's brews my favorite IPAs. They are dry and bitter and aggressive, and I love it. This one is no exception, and it is top tier. They need to brew this more regularly. Seek it out. I'm gonna seek another one from my refrigerator... Cheers! 1,626 charactersjbwimer, Feb 24, 2014

Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, tropical fruit, and slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, tropical fruit, and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great citrus and tropical forward hop presence all around. 653 charactersUCLABrewN84, Feb 23, 2014

Appearance - Golden tan, amber with a 1/2 foamy head, decent lacing.
Smell - Sweet citric fruits, orange, tangerine, lemon, pineapple, grapes. mango, some honey.
Taste - Had this one before on draft at fat heads, pittsburgh, loved it, now time for a bottle. Starts off with smooth, sweet citric fruits. Lots of orange, pineapple and mango with some lemon and added sugars. You get a herbal flavor in each drink. Has a strong pine finish with some alcohol warmth.
Mouthfeel - Citric hops nail the tongue, sweeten then bitter it. Palate gets more hops, some sugars and a alcohol bite at the end. Aftertaste is hoppy bitter and dry.
Overall - Excellent beer just as i remembered. It really is a world class dipa. You can add this beer to the mix now with hopslam, dirt wolf, sucks ect. It will come down to what YOU like, and thats all that matters. Still i would take permanent funeral and artic panzer wolf over this but honestly, theres not a bad beer between them. 992 characterswvsabbath, Feb 22, 2014

If it's anything like Head Hunter...sign me up. 12 oz. bottle poured lovingly by my underage daughter. 
The pour is a clear orange with just enough carbonation to register on the beer scale. My daughter pronounces the smell "weird" which translates into the adult word for "yummy". Nose is ripe pear juice running down my chin, mixed with tropical fruit & backed up by a sugar-water mix.
Hop JuJu is woowoo my poopoo. Bitterness careens out of the gate & bruises the top of the mouth with a full shitwad of whoop-ass. Beneath the whoop are bits & pieces of the smell: most of a tropical island, pear, citrus, lemon, mango. Wears its ABV on its sleeve, actually drinks bigger than its ABV. Drier than Ordos, this sucks the moisture right out of my mouth & leaves it Dust Bowlesque. I could drink this until the rains came back. 
Well, hell, this really does live up to its rep. Dry, tasty, complex, bitter, angry. Tasty. Yes, this is one excellent beer that puts a lot of IIPAs to shame. Brewers, take notice. This is how you do it. 1,161 charactersmaximum12, Feb 22, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Been waiting to try this beer for a long time, I usually catch every specialty release at Fathead's Pittsburgh but this one has always eluded me. I was thrilled to hear that it won this year's GABF Gold medal, and it beat my favorite 3F's Permanent Funeral out in blind tastings. This sample is super fresh bottled on 2/13/14...I love the packaging and the artwork on the label..."a supernatural beer". 
Pours into a Fathead's Head Hunter pint glass glowing orange copper with a big white head filling up past the rim of the glass. Big chunks of sporadic lacing, aromatics hit hard with dank resinous hops everything I love about Head Hunter and then some, this time around there's grapefruit peel, tropical passionfruit notes, hop resins it's like diving into a bale of dried hops...what a great smelling DIPA. That happens to drink as easily as a single IPA. 
Let's talk about flavors...layered resins of hop oils take on the palate, bringing lime/grapefruit citrus pith, dank cannabis oils, tropical fruit (think papaya/passionfruit combo), just an unrelenting level of hop bitterness that actually hits the palate in all the right ways! It comes off balanced not sugar coated hops, or caramelized sugars just a depth of malt presence and hop burps come of your nares after a few sips. Truly magnificent DIPA, to make something this drinkable, critics complain about 13.99 a 4 pack it's a bargain with the quality and amount of hops used in this offering. Alcohol definitely has a presence but it doesn't burn, it seems to be balanced into the combination of big malt and extraordinary hop components but be warned this beer is 9% abv and 100 walloping IBUs! 
Matt Cole has quickly become a presence in the craft beer world after honing his skills at Rocky River in Ohio, he had a transcending meet up with Glen Benigni (excuse spelling) the founder of Fat Head's Pittsburgh which lead to a brewpub in New Olmstead, Ohio which lead to the production brewery pumping out bottles and very soon cans from Fathead's. The first time I visited Fathead's New Olmstead, it was a couple years ago Matt was loading his vehicle with GABF medals at that time...I am grateful to be close enough and part of the experience and I'm proud to see a somewhat local brewer/franchise gaining such deserved recognition for their talent, hardwork, and passion. 
Sorry about the long review that pretty much pays homage to one of my favorite brewers in the world, but the mouthfeel on this beer is perfect with big hop oils gliding across the palate, creamy texture hop layers just so easy going down this beer is truly ridiculous! 
Overall, a beer I can't live without now that I've tasted it, it best become part of their rotation if it doesn't we are all going to be let down, but the adds I've seen recently for Fathead's represents that this beer is going to be a standby offering, if not I really hope to see the next release come sooner than later. I wasn't being greedy I plan on sharing, and yes I grabbed the last 11 bottles available at my local! That's how rare this beer is!!! 3,074 charactersWVbeergeek, Feb 21, 2014

Massive Hop bomb from Fat Head's. Dank Hops aggressively attack the taste buds instantly, giving way to tropical fruit and a rich creamy malt presence, All of which make it THEE most well balanced DIPA I have ever had. Easily hangs with the big dogs of the DIPA world. I can hardly find a flaw with this beer. The only reason I will rate it '1' less than Heady Topper is the fact that Heady Topper leaves you with an ENORMOUS hop feel in your mouth for what seems like eternity. While this does linger, it doesn't leave that watery/dank mouthfeel that 'Heady' does so well. Outside of that.... The 2nd best IPA I have ever had. Beating out Pliny, as it's much meatier and balanced. Also, much more smooth and drinkable than Dreadnaught. A bit more complex than Hopslam. Can't speak on Permanent Funeral. Over all, Fat Heads CRUSHED it with this 9% bruiser~ 957 charactersClePaul, Feb 21, 2014

The appearance is a beautiful combination of amber and orange with a touch of haziness to it. The head was minimized by the bartender, but I could see a nice thick, white head during the pouring process.
The nose is absolutely overpowering, as it is noticeable even from a few feet away. It smells strongly of pine and citrus, with dank and resinous notes also present, and just a touch of sweet caramel. The taste brings more of the citrus into play, as it is the overwhelming flavor here. The pine is still present, but this starts and finishes with the citrus. There's a slight trace of the sweet malt coming through, but it's quickly pushed away.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with good levels of carbonation. It isn't overly drinkable for the style, and finished slightly drier than expected. Overall, this is a wonderful DIPA, and almost worth the hype it received. The aroma is by far the best feature, as it keeps drawing you in for more. 1,058 characterszimm421, Feb 20, 2014

This beer has already skyrocketed up to my favorite DIPA and i've tried a handful of the big ones outside of Heady. I can see why this won gold at the Great American Beer Festival!

A. Hop Juju is a deep, honey gold with hints of amber. It has a luminescent quality, at least in this soft light. Big finger and a half of off-white head...mostly tight, small bubbles with thick beading on the glass. 
S. Oh, wow. This is 100% pure tropical nectar here. The pineapple, tangerine, and mango notes are dialed up to 11. Sweet, sticky honey and fresh pine sap add a sugar and spice note. This is a lush bouquet. One of the best.
T. A lot more refined than the nose would lead me to believe, which is mildly disappointing. Initial citrus zest and pine notes that quickly blossom into this really enjoyable wildflower honey, tropical fruit, bubble gum, and slightly herbal flavor profile. The finish is drying and bitter, but the tropical fruitiness and sweet honey notes balance it well.
M. Balance is very good, even if the herbal bitterness of the hops overrides the tropical notes just a bit more than I would like. Also, I think I detect hints of booziness on the finish. With the sheer power of the flavor profile, though, this is very well done. Powerful beers are hard to reel in but Fat Heads did this one justice.
O. This is the real deal. It shouldn't be surprising that Fat Heads produces a world class DIPA, as their greatest hits list (including Head Hunter) implies they've mastered the Hop Arts a long time ago. I'm very excited they've decided to bottle this old favorite, and even more excited it received some well-deserved recognition at the GABF last year. This is one of the best DIPAs around, not the least of which is because it packs so much flavor and complexity into a very smooth, enjoyable concoction. It is boldly flavored without ever being overwhelming. It's extremely tropical yet pleasantly dry and herbal. It punches the palate without drying my mouth out for the rest of the week. It's a special hop-forward beer from a brewery that makes so many special hop-forward beers. Congratulations, Fat Heads, on another outstanding effort and to the BAs of Cleveland who now have a legitimate claim to the IPA crown by having three classics bottled right in their backyard: White Rajah, Head Hunter, and, now, Hop JuJu.

Minty citrus, tropical fruits, spruce tips, green papaya, grapefruit rind, clean hop leaf, and unripe mango. Super bright. Awesome nose. One of the best I've come across.
Super clean, crisp, moderately bitter, and unreal hoppy. Spearmint, uber-dry grapefruit and tangerine, floral notes, clean pine, real lemon-lime, green mango, tropical rinds, and bitter quince. So freaking good. Leafy hops take over. No dankness, no musty flavors. Malts are stepping aside. No complications, no real sweetness. Pale and dry and adding more crispiness, like a pilsner malt. So hoppy, the aftertaste is green and awesomely long and dry. Tingly carbonation extends the tastes. Body is exceptionally light, maybe medium. No syrupiness, no stick. Awesomely pure and silken.
An elite Imperial IPA. I would douse a four-pack of this Juju, if I had it. One of the best, in my opinion. 979 charactersthecheapies, Feb 17, 2014

Slight haze to this orange-yellow brew. Thick one finger head, copious lacing.
Huge tropical fruits explode out of the vessel. Mango, pineapple, oranges, grapefruit. Really could deeply inhale this all day.
Smooth hoppy happiness with pineapple and grapefruit right up front with a subtle pine backbone. A wisp of alcohol creeps in at the end.
Nicely balanced, medium mouthfeel, well carbonated.
Well deserved gold at GABF. 476 charactersCaptCleveland, Feb 17, 2014

4.99/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had a fresh bottle and had it on tap. 
Appearance- nice head maybe an inch or so. 
Smell- Great floral hoppy smell. 
Taste- Starts off with intense hop taste. I had this very fresh and you can tell. It later fades in to a bit of a citrus and fruity smell. The finish cuts off a bit of the bitterness in a very nice and clean way. Sometimes very hoppy beers can leave with a bad after taste, that is not the case with this. 
Mouthfeel- Easy to drink. Smooth and light. 
Overall- I bought a case (4 pack for me the rest for friends/family and a 4 to trade), I'm probably going back to get some more for my self. This is a great imperial IPA. I'd definitely put this on or near the top of imperial IPAs. 
Serving type: bottle and tap. 737 charactersCLEmark, Feb 17, 2014

Appearance- Hard pour leads to a finger and a half of creamy white head. Head fades slowly and leaves great lacing. This beer looks like a brand, spanking-new, penny. 
Smell- I get mango, kiwi and honey right away. This is followed by pear and white grapes. Really hoping it taste like it smells. 
Taste- Way more bitter than I had anticipated. I know I know, it's an imperial IPA what do I expect. The nose is so complex and so beautiful, I just expected more then bitter hops on the tongue. I am starting to detect tropical fruits and strawberries. 
Mouthfeel- This 9% beer goes down smoother than lemonade on a hot August day. This is, by far, the smoothest 9%+ beer I have ever enjoyed. A bit thinner than I have come to expect from the style, but does not detract from the quality whatsoever. 
Overall- I bought a whole case at the release party and I would do it again! So freaking good! I always judge a beer on if I would trade/pay shipping for it and the answer for this beer is YES. 1,092 charactersfrenchblood21, Feb 15, 2014
4.89/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Absolutely outstanding beer. I poured JuJu into a 16 oz. snifter and the first thing that hit me was the aroma. It was huge amounts of a blend of citrus flavors. I had to take several smells of this before I even had my first sip, and even after, I still couldn't get enough of the smell of this beer. The taste followed the smell, with a bit of pepper as well.
Overall, this is one of my favorite, if not my favorite DIPA. I haven't had it in over a year, and I'm so happy to finally see this in bottles. Do yourself a favor, and grab as many 4 packs as you can of this stuff. It's that damn good. 599 charactersShmuffalo, Feb 15, 2014

This beer has joins the ranks of the greats in the category. Citrus, pine, smooth. It has it all. If you like HT, you will love the JuJu. For such a big beer, you cannot taste the alcohol, making this one dangerous brew. I normally don't drink a second big beer like this one after the other. I drank three. If I could, I would drink this beer everyday. It is literally liquid gold. I thank the beers gods of North Olmstead for bringing this beer to life. 576 charactersVitoFerrante, Feb 13, 2014

Pours golden with a fluffy white head; great lacing and retention. The aromas are dank and full of juicy citrus. Mango, pineapple, and watermelon in the mix. This one also has hints of pine needles and grass. Flavors are extremely earthy and bitter. Lots of grapefruit. Lots of pine resin. Very resinous. Very sharp and crisp. This one has a west-coast vibe to it. There's also a touch of sweetness from the subtle malts, giving it a midwest vibe as well. Very astringent. Mouthfeel is full-bodied; active carbonation and very smooth and creamy. Alcohol goes unnoticed and this is pretty easy to drink, despite the bitterness.
I've had this in the past and I was happy to revisit it. Wonderful DIPA that can hang with the best in the country. Extremely well done. Highly recommended. 826 charactersBB1313, Sep 15, 2013

Served on cask at the Fathead's Saloon in Cleveland.
Served in 8oz pint glass with a hazy dark orange body with a two and a half inch with a ton of sticky lacing.
Great smelling beer that is dominated by the grapefruit hops, instantly reminds me of a west coast IPA. The taste is great, hop citrus everywhere with a bit of pine and a great amount of bitterness.
This is a full bodied beer with a good amount of carbonation, the beer is really sticky and completely coats your mouth. Overall a solid Imperial IPA and I will defiantly pick up another glass during my next visit to Fat Head's. 637 charactersDan3279, Sep 03, 2011

Huge blast of hops cone aromas... pine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit. Heavenly. Body is a fairly light golden orange with a little bit of a head and many streams of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Flavor is darn near perfect for anything aspiring to be my kind of IPA.... lots of hops, enough malt to balance and thicken things up a bit and a very bitter finish with some resin. 420 characterscosmo4u, Aug 18, 2011

A - A finger of white foam that has fantastic retention and leaves behind splotchy lace. Golden transparent body.
S - Big hop aroma, with plenty of pithy grapefruit, light pine, other citrus zest and juice, and a light sugar cookie and bread malt backdrop.
T - Taste is a little less exciting, although it's still fairly enjoyable. Less sweetness and more bitterness, particularly in the finish. As it warms up some icing sugar malt character comes, but this is largely grapefruits and a hint of orange.
M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, some light alcohol warmth, and a super dry finish. Plenty if resinous hop oils are left behind.
D - A very good Midwest DIPA that I would gladly have again if I saw it on-tap (or had a growler). There's a nice group of hoppy brews popping up in Ohio (Fat Heads, Columbus, etc.) which is a nice change of pace from the less hop-oriented offerings from Jackie O's and Great Lakes. This isn't a beer that you could drink all night, but I had no problem finishing my glass. 1,123 charactersMasterSki, Jun 28, 2011

T-A bit boozy but mostly delicious. Good light caramel malt, then lots of citrus bitterness nicely balanced by a honeyed sweetness and some boozy warmth. Quite tasty.

Imperial snifter served at the brewpub the day after it was put on tap. Super fresh batch. Looks nice, oranger than headhunter. Some nice head that sticks to the sides. Overall, it's a nice looking beer, very west-coast inspired.
Huge tangerine and pine smells in the nose. In talking to the brewer, he mentioned CTZ hops and simcoe. You can def. pick out the spiciness of the CTZ and the slight cattiness of the simcoe. Pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Intense and expressive. Just a touch too spicy for me.
The taste is intense and hoppy as hell. The pine and citrus flavors are lush and intense. Very bitter with just a touch of pale sweet malt underneath. This beer isn't messing around.
Medium body with nice carbonation. Overall, I liked this beer but it is ruinous and very, very brash. Not a lover, certainly a fighter. This beer will knock out your tastebuds, but it's worth getting in the ring.
Edit - the first bottled batch, released 2-2014 is much more refined, less brash, and pretty much the best beer these guys have ever made. Updated smell and taste to 5's! 1,091 charactersjampics2, Sep 01, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on tap at the Cleveland location. The menu notes: Double IPA brewed with incredible amounts of hops giving this beer supernatural hops aroma, flavor, and bitterness. 
The beer is kind of dark copper color, mostly clear with a little haze, and a wet looking white foam. Lots of lacing on the glass as the glass emptied. The aroma was all citrus hops, grapefruit and lemon, really mouthwatering. This is exactly the approach I like to see with a DIPA, some go too far with malt balance but not Hop JuJu. The taste was no disappointment either, The hops citrus flavors come through in a big way, and here the malts showed up a little more than in the aroma. The initial tastes are sweet but with a strong bitter edge in the aftertaste. 
Full bodied and filling, a strong mouthfeel to complement the strong flavors. This is another great IPA from Fat Heads, a brewery that makes nothing but good beers. This microbrewery should consider bottling. 948 charactersTurdFurgison, Mar 25, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Got this at Fatheads in Pittsburgh on tap, the only place you can get this stuff. Pours a deep amber orange, no carbonation, thin light lacing around the top of the glass.
Smell is Tart grapefruit, orange, light malt sweetness, and some pepper. Smells a little acidic in the hop department, almost dank in nature.
Taste is surprisingly much BETTER than expected. Has a HUGE grapefruit presence, slight malt sweetness on the palette, a little peppery, orange citrus, but the grapefruit bitterness definately dominates. Has a mild sweetness up front before the bitterness immediately takes over and slams the malts into submission. The malts do linger underneath to keep things in check, but definately plays a back seat to the bitterness. As a side note, I definitely dig the flavor of this private label D-IPA.
Mouthfeel is smooth, finishes dry, medium to full body, and leaves a metallic orange citrus coating in the mouth with a modest warming in the throat from the ABV.
Drinkability runs very, very high. Fatheads hit a home run with this recipe. Hey, can you bottle this stuff? This is an absolutely fabulous beer. I bought a growler to take home and if I had easier access to this, I'd keep it in my fdridge as long as they had it on tap. Very well done and a definite surprise. Nice job. 1,298 charactersjzeilinger, Mar 11, 2010

A-copper color with a thin white head that lingers for a moment and leaves a light lacing.
S-big nose of tropical fruits and floral aromas. Grapefruit, apricot and some citrus make up the fruits with a light hint of pine to back up all the sweetness.
T-follows the nose and is quite big! the grapefruit and apricot dominate with a touch of citrus bringing up the font of the flavor. a resigny pine comes in next with lots of bitterness coming in at the finish.
M-medium body with a fair amount of carbonation. it is syrupy but extremely smooth and it coats the mouth as it goes down.

Looks like a Pliny clone, its light in appearance. That is the only thing it is "light" in. Massive grapefruit hop aromas. The best. Taste is more of the same, but without any heavy malt bill, or feeling of unbalanced bitterness. Bitterness subsides before its even there. Delicious.
Mouthfeel, relatively straightforward, there is no evolution here, which is good, because its phenomenal from the first waft. Could drink this all day. 506 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Feb 08, 2010
3.72/5  rDev -16.2%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Review from notes taken earlier tonight at the brewery. Poured into a clean, clear pint glass. Notes from brewery: Double IPA brewed with incredible amounts of hops giving this beer supernatural hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. It's witchcraft on tap like a temporary hop tattoo on your tongue.
A Translucent orange brown body with little head and not much lacing either. 3.0
S Floral hops but nicely balanced with nice malt sweetness. 3.5
T Hops are the center but really they are not unbalanced. This beer luckily has a nice malt balance to it. 4.0
M Moderate with some hop bitterness but a very welcome smoothness too that really helped me enjoy this beer. 4.0
D Fair to good. 3.5
Notes: I really enjoyed this beer that I was not sure that I would. I do not enjoy hoppy beers as much as most. 802 charactersadamette, Sep 26, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I was able to try Fat Heads take on a Double/Imperial IPA there on 9/25/2009. The beer menu stated that it had an ABV of 8.7% and 100 IBUs. Fat Heads served it to me in a 12 oz. Snifter.
This Double/Imperial IPA poured a semi clear dark golden amber with a few minor sunshine yellow highlights along the sides. Sitting on top of this beer was a creamy head of white foam. It wasn't an off white color, it was a solid cotton white color. This pure white head of foam had good retention that left behind a string of white rings and some big ass streaks of lace all around the glass.
The aroma was citrus all the way! It was one of those Double/Imperial IPAs that you can smell from a long distance. The aroma was strong with bitter citrus hops, bitter grapefruit, a hint of pine, a splash of lemon, and any other citrus fruit you can think of. Was there any malts to help balance out all the citrus aromas? Hell No there wasn't! This was the scent of a great Double/Imperial. Let's see if the taste matches the strong bitter citrus aroma. 
The taste was extremely bitter with citrus fruits, bitter citrus hops, plenty of bitter grapefruit, a splash of lemon, and a touch of pine. Sometimes this taste got so bitter than I turned my head, but not in disgust. It was more of a reflex because the beer was too bitter. If you plan on drinking this beer, I sure hope you really like bitter beers because the malts will not come in at all to help balance out the beer. In other words, this was one great super bitter beer.
This was clearly a full bodied Double/Imperial IPA with the correct amount of carbonation and a full flavored bitter aftertaste. This strong bitter aftertaste was chock full of citrus hops, citrus fruits, pine, and grapefruit. This was the malts last chance to show up, but I'm thinking that all the citrus flavors combined all their citrus powers to completely kick out the malts. This aftertaste had nowhere to go anytime soon, so it stuck around in the back of my throat for quite a few minutes.
I know that Fat Heads makes some really good beers, but they raised the bar with this one. There was absolutely no shortage of citrus hops or fruits. The only thing missing from the taste was the malts and I couldn't care less about that. A 12 oz. glass is good enough for a beer this big. A growler might be a little too excessive. If you're a hop head (if you're on BA you probably are) and you see this on the beer board or menu, get it! 2,469 charactersAltBock, Sep 26, 2009
