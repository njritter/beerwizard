This is a great showcase of the listed adjuncts in an imperial porter.  Coffee, peppers,  maple, cinnamon, cacao are nicely present and balanced on top of the sweet chocolatey porter.  Very nice 227 charactersrabbott2, May 15, 2017

Pours a deep brown body with a big two finger brown head that reduces slowly to leave a layer of retention. 
On the nose.. lots of chili pepper aromas, cinnamon and coffee, milk chocolate all mix together. 
This beer is straight mexican milk chocolate .. cocoa powder, milk chocolate, coffee and a little roasty on the finish. Chilis and cinnamon sit in the background.  Body is a little light but expected for a porter. Medium carbonation. 
Lives up to the name. This beer is exactly as described. 583 charactersgcamparone, Apr 06, 2017

Had it on tap in small amounts up at the Cloverleaf Tavern but this was the first time I had a chance to enjoy a full bottle of it and boy, was it everything I hoped it would be. Balanced, smooth, and flavorful, this was a titan of a brew that made every aspect of an "Imperial Milk Porter" ring true, from start to finish!
I don't say this often but the pour was the *least* appealing aspect of this beer, and it wasn't even that bad! Of course, it appeared to be brown, relatively thin, and capped off with a tan head full of tiny bubbles that held their own as if they were solid. Not a lot of lacing was left behind but when you can smell coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and cocoa from across the room, who's to notice? All of those filled up my Kane goblet quite nicely as this seemed to be an Imperial version of the Carton Coffee but this wasn't even close to being one-dimensional. A mild roasted tone was topped off with a pronounced sweetness, bold milk chocolate taste and a mildly forward lactose sweetness that tied everything together. Unbelievably smooth for the amount of booze present, this never felt like an American Porter as the roasted and burnt notes could not be discerned over the brighter and sugary tones that characterized this. Hints of caramel and toffee were found in the aftertaste but if I had to venture a guess, the creamy, lactose-like characteristics of milk chocolate won out here as the end result was just a smile on my face.
With a bottle this big, there was enough booze to be felt by the time it was finished off. It tasted like a Coffee Porter but this was American since the roasted, toasty, and sticky aspects of an English Porter were nowhere to be found here. With that being said, this was American through and through since there since the coffee and chocolate characteristics easily won out over what this might have been "lacking". A clear winner, this ranks up with the Conclave's best and Carton's Coffee (Regular and Irregular) as the best offering *ever* produced in my flawed-but-beloved home state. Amazing stuff that deserves all the praised heaped upon it, this would be worth any effort to seek it out. Porters of any kind don't get better than this! 2,288 charactersJerzDevl2000, Mar 16, 2017

It's a busy nose. Roasty malts, coffee, cinnamon, peppers, and maple. Honestly, it's one of those smells that I want to find in a candle.
Taste largely follows the nose. Not as spicy as I was anticipating based on the pepper scents, nor as maple forward. Despite that, the blend comes together wonderfully.
Soft feel, but still plenty thick. 
Overall, I'd trade for this again in a heartbeat, and hope sometime to have 2 bottles so that we can try a little bit of it in an ice cream float. 633 charactersAngerhaus, Mar 15, 2017

Descent foam head upon pour, which dissipates quickly and leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge of glass as you drink.  Deep dark appearance.  Getting a lot of coffee on this, as well as cocoa and cinnamon on the nose.  The taste is phenomenal and not overly sweet.  There is still loads of coffee, with cinnamon + cocoa and even maple as it warmed.  The feel was full and sticky.  This to me is a much better version of an Abraxas.  
I would gladly trade for this beer again, as it is easily one of the top 2-3 non-BA Mexican Stouts for me. 574 characterseifster82, Mar 13, 2017

I am so lucky to be within an hour drive of the brewery. This one is excellent, pours as you would expect - nice and dark.  Wonderful flavor and aroma.  The heat is very mild, borderline too mild but I prefer that to in your face.  I rank this one a notch below ANTEAD and Sunday Brunch which is high praise as they are 2 of my all time favorites. 453 charactersnjcraftguy, Feb 07, 2017

4.73/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A: Beer pours a pitch black color with about two and a half fingers of tightly packed and quite pillowy cinnamon-colored head. Solid head retention--it fades slowly, ultimately settling as a ring around the edge of the glass. Very little light spots near the edge of the glass... This one is pretty much pitch black and opaque.
S: Big dark roast coffee pushing toward espresso billows out of the glass. The coffee note is intense, but it doesn't come off as overly bitter, with a low level of apparent acridity. It's balanced by a rich, sweet milk chocolate aroma that pushes back against the roastiness with a hefty amount of perceived sweetness. While those two aromas stand out, there's definitely some support provided by a light, smokey, charred-pepper-skin kinda thing along with an even lighter maple syrup note. Very pungent too--I can smell this one from several feet away.
T: Follows the nose... This is a chocolate/coffee bomb! Huge amounts of that dark roast coffee/espresso come through up front, accompanied by an uber dark, powdered chocolate flavor the drives the taste from start to finish. There's a touch of sweet maple syrup and some cinnamon that hits sharply (yet mildly) at the sides of the tongue, along with a bit of smokey pepper that appears toward the backend. But that coffee/chocolate combo is just overwhelming through the swallow. Aftertaste lingers seemingly without end... Seriously, I haven't taken a sip in 5 minutes and the flavors are all still there. It's like baker's cocoa mixed with a touch of espresso, a few drops of maple syrup, and maybe the faintest bit of charred Ancho shavings.
M: Very similar to Sunday Brunch, with a medium weight on the tongue, a delicate yet evenly full carbonation, and a lingering, seemingly never-ending aftertaste that just sticks to the edges of the mouth like maple syrup. It's definitely not a full mouthfeel, as it lacks the sludgy, heavy thickness that some bigger imperial stouts offer. However, I don't think this one necessarily needs that, and while I wouldn't be upset if it did, I'm not necessarily gonna knock it for the lack thereof. It balances richness with drinkability dangerously well, making it quite tempting to down a 750ml of this in a single sitting. If memory serves me correctly, this may be slightly sweeter than Sunday Brunch, but the finish is so well balanced on the bitter cocoa/espresso vs. sweet maple/chocolate scale.
O: Another excellent offering from Kane. I came into this with high expectations following Sunday Brunch, and this definitely met them. In comparison to SB, MB offers much more chocolate--not necessarily sweet, fudgy chocolate, but more bitter, powdered dark cocoa. This has the effect of amping up the coffee note and making it seem more espresso-like, which actually works well IMO given the slight smokey flavor offered by the peppers. But the other adjuncts (maple syrup, cinnamon), which I so thoroughly enjoyed in Sunday Brunch, definitely take a backseat here. While this is still remarkably balanced, it's not quite as perfect as Sunday Brunch. That being said, it's still excellent, and definitely one of the best porters I've ever had the good fortune of trying! 3,202 charactersavas, Feb 01, 2017

O: I'm not sure whether it was the hype or build up in my mind, but man, this sort of fell flat for me. I thoroughly enjoyed Sunday Brunch and I'm fully aware that this is categorized as a 'porter', but Mexican Brunch just didn't live up to my pre-conceived expectations. Certainly aspects of this beer are exceedingly well executed - the pour and nose on this beer were excellent. The taste felt a little 'Sanka' instant coffee-forward and the mouthfeel just felt a touch thin to me. Maybe this is better on tap? Good beer for sure, but not confident I'm in agreement with many others on its currently high rating. 866 charactersFireman_RK, Dec 14, 2016

Big coffee, light roast. Maple sweetness with very light pepper flavor. Chocolate. 
Medium bodied. Not as thick as you want it to be but it is a porter. Tons of flavor. Well done. 204 charactersmothman, Dec 12, 2016

4.56/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This one pours a very dark black, with a reddish brown head, and a small amount of lacing.
This smells like creamy vanilla, with some slight peppery aromas stinging the nose, with sweet maple syrupy aromas, a slight bit of coffee, and lots of milk chocolate.
This one tastes pretty decadent. The peppers and maple syrup are the dominant flavors amongst the numerous "adjuncts" in the beer. It tastes pretty absurdly creamy, vanilla comes to mind, almost like a milkshake. This does make sense, as it's a "milk porter." The pepper heat slowly builds with each sip, and I really dig that- but I could see some people seeing this as too spicy. I dig it, though. There's not a ton of coffee here, I think the pepper might drown it out a bit. It's got a ton of fudgy milk chocolate flavor, too. I'd like maybe a bit of roasty porter characteristics, but it's delicious enough where it's not missed a ton.
This is medium bodied, and absurdly creamy, with a nice level of carbonation that's not too distracting.
This is pretty masterful when it comes to heavily flavored dark beers. Kane knows what's up. 1,101 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 10, 2016

Full body that coats the mouth. The flavors of coffee and peppers / spices hit in both the taste and aroma in the most perfect way one could ask for. Have had this beer many of times from its first release to the latest in both bottles and tap. Its well worth everything anyone has said about it in a positive manner. 423 charactersthampel09, Apr 19, 2016

Aroma was sensational. I am not always huge on the Mexican style stouts. This one was different. The cinnamon, maple and light pepper was phenomenal in the nose and on the palate. Luxurious feel. Loved the cinna-maple combo. This was my favorite beer of the fest. Kane brought some awesome beers! Great brewery. 412 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 08, 2016

Taste is a roasty chocolatey coffee mix, syrup is present as it warms and the peppers give it a slight splash of a kick.  It's got some noticeable IBU's as there's some present bitterness.  Overall this just tastes like a heavenly blend of many delicious things.  Kane has a great one here. 397 charactersanteatr23, Feb 07, 2016

Looks dark brown, very little head. Spider web lacing on the glass after drinking.
Smells like cinnamon and maple
Taste is strong cinnamon, touch of maple, some coffee and a touch of chocolate from the malt. Really phenomenal. I wish the feel was a tax thicker, but this is just minor nitpicking.
Overall a phenomenal beer. 346 charactersBourbonJersey, Aug 20, 2015

S: Chili is extremely faint; the notes are mostly of chocolate, mocha, coffee, and cinnamon. Dig deeper to find some vanilla and smoke
T: Oak, malty, and some pepper. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma: mocha/brown sugar, coffee, cinnamon, and hints of smoke and maybe vanilla 
M: Light to more medium body and feel, very smooth and creamy, and an untraceable ABV
O: Noticed some compared this to Sunday Brunch, which I hadn’t had since the anniversary. Consequently, I can’t fairly justify the likeliness b/w the two. Nonetheless, the flavors were well integrated; the product was excellent…Saving a growler to see what will happen with age.

A:  Not as good as the base beer, Morning Bell, but still good.  Pitch black, but the lacing and head are rather lacking.  Still love the color.
S:  Good.  Lots of spices.  Cinnamon, brown sugar, chili peppers, and chocolate.  While the scents are good, however, the malt is somewhat masked by the overly potent spices.
T:  Lots of spice.  Cinnamon, brown sugar and chili peppers mask the malt somewhat, but the beer is still very good.
F:  Thick and creamy.  Lovely.
O:  Solid beer.  Perhaps the spices were overdone, however. 560 charactersleantom, Jun 03, 2015

Sweet but not overly so and unlike others I can detect the pepper in a smokey form and adding a great feel that cleans everything up underneath.  It's integrated so well.  Coffee and cocoa add needed bitterness and balance it so well, keeping it from being cloying. flavors are amazingly executed!  Clean, smooth and creamy feel.  Unreal drinkability for 9.2%.

My God, what a nose! The aroma explodes from the glass with wave after wave of dark roast coffee, maple syrup, cinnamon, dark chocolate, cream, and soft chili pepper notes. Fudge, cocoa powder, and a hint of heat. This is gloriously complex, and you just never want to stop smelling it!
The flavor is utterly decadent with sweet notes of maple syrup, cream, milk chocolate, and cinnamon being wonderfully balanced by dark roast coffee, chili peppers, and bitter baker's chocolate! One of my favorite things about this is how they nailed the amount of chili peppers! It is not too heavy handed, like many other beers in this style, but just enough to add to the flavor and to balance out some of the sweetness. In typical Kane fashion this is just wonderfully balanced!
The mouth feel is medium to thick, with a nice creamy feel from the lactose sugar. Nice carbonation, with small bubbles. A very light heat from the chili peppers, and no cloying sweetness.
This is an absolute masterpiece of a beer! It takes on the Huna's and Abraxases of the beer world (2 of my favorites!) and utterly dominates them! I cannot wait for this to be bottled! 1,240 charactersSadMachine, May 24, 2015
