Overall it was ok and NOWHERE near the cost to get a bottle. This  beer is more hyped up than Lil Wayne, I was very disappointed based on its reputation. 339 charactersStardusthotel83, May 15, 2017

Pours a thick, motor oil body with a dark brown head that reduces slowly to leave a ring of lacing. 
Aromas are fudge, charred malt, lots of barrel and a bit metallic. 
On the tongue it's extravagant and rich. Thick fudge, chocolate brownies with bourbon, roasty char, sweet vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel is a perfect 5, the thickest stout I've had. 
Yup, this is awesome. The hype is real. 520 charactersgcamparone, Apr 06, 2017

Look: The purple wax is not an illusion.  There is a slight purple hue to this dark stout with a brown and purple tinted head.
Smell: Nostril filling dark deliciousness with hints of chocolate.  
Taste: This is hands down the best beer I have ever tasted (currently ranked 49), and I have had ones much higher rated.  Warm and chocolately with hints of vanilla.
Feel: Thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.   Pours slow mimicking its feel.
Cannot wait to open the other in my fridge at the right time. 564 charactersPaulVanney, Mar 20, 2017

Taste- good bourbon nice hint of chocolate, barrel comes through very nice

Pours like cloudless, starless night. Legs on the glass that reminds you more of a fine bourbon than a beer.
Smells balanced, whiskey and roast with a very subtle stone fruit scent (namely the pit, not the fruit itself).
Tastes big yet balanced, it lingers on the palate but isn't heavy. Fudge forward with an oaky, tad nutty, vanilla and roast at the end.
The feel is balanced. It's not overwhelming in anyway. Drinking it, you know it's a world-class stout. You know you are standing at the pearly gates. 580 charactersshareallthebeer, Feb 20, 2017
4.94/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52016.  From bottle into Assassin teku glass.
Black liquid with no foam head.  Just a caramel colored ring around the edge of glass.  Aromas are of robust imperial stout with balanced barrel character: nuttiness, oak, some vanilla and coffee (and some smokiness intially but not noticed after it warmed).  Taste follows the nose but with some sweet, dark fruits coming out towards the end of each sip (and becoming more noticeable as it warmed).  The feel was pillowy, yet sticky as sip was finished. Mouth continued to be coated through out and the flavors intensified.  
Overall, it's a magnificently balanced, no adjunct, barrel aged imperial stout.  My expectations were met and the asking price was worth it. Will look to trade for another bottle when, and if, possible. 776 characterseifster82, Feb 13, 2017

No indication of any stone fruit taste as others have mentioned. Mouthfeel is molasses, thick as mud. Will coat your mouth as it did your glass. Overall happy to have secured a bottle of this. You can enjoy this now, but this one is built to last. Anxious to try it in a couple years down the road. World class offering from Toppling Goliath. 612 characterskidzord, Feb 06, 2017

A friend of mine had a difficult time deciding whether he enjoyed this one more than KBBS. For me, it wasn't quite on par, due to what I might call an overabundance of whisky character (and this coming from someone who loves whisky) leading to a somewhat intense umami note (think soy sauce).
Mouthfeel, however, is very impressive.  
My opinion: It's a great beer, but I'd let this one sit for a couple years. Optimal drinking: 2019-2020. 515 charactersWantonFaun, Jan 25, 2017

S: Dark fruit, chocolate, and whiskey. It fills up the entire room. 
T: Sweet molasses and raisins with a touch of bitterness on the end. As it warms, the beer becomes a chocolate whiskey swirl of goodness. There is s depth of flavor that elevates this beer to true whale status, taking your palate on a journey through multiple layers of some very unique combinations of tastes and senses. 
M: Thick, viscous, unctuous, and finely carbonated. Assassin delivers on everything craft beer heads complain about "not having" in most of the beers they drink. This beer coats your mouth and continues to remind you of the great beer you had, even minutes after your last sip. 
O: A wonderfully executed stout. The whiskey barrels integrate perfectly into the base beer, creating layers of flavor that linger on the palate. I do not imagine that a better beer could be made in this style without adjuncts or a second barrel. Simply fantastic. 1,006 charactersrodmanfor3, Jan 19, 2017

L-thick and syrupy, minimal head, nice lacing
S-boozy bourbon, and fudge.  Intense and bold and very nice.  oak opens up with warming.
T-gets beyond elite here.  This boozy (but not too boozy) bourbon combination with a strong and intense fudgey chocolate is really incredible.  The oak comes out and obviously gets better and better as it warms.  It's intense.  Not overly complex, but it doesn't need to be.  Some slight vanilla and maybe dark fruit sweetness are present.  (VERY slight, almost not there but just a little bit, which is nice).  For being a 2 year old stout, the heat on this is still really nice, and I can only imagine how great this will still be in another 2 years
F-WOW.  One of the best mouthfeel's i've experience.  Extreme coating.  Thick syrupy.  Just amazing.
Overall - an elite and amazing beer.  The price tag on this is just insane, so it's tough to say it's justified, but this really is an amazing beer.  I love the intense barrel coming through on barrel aged stouts and this hits it on the money for me.  A true white whale of mine.  So happy to try this.
Adding some notes to the 2016 vintage drank on 2/12/2017.  The biggest difference of this compared to 2014 (at 2 years old too) is a certain level of sweetness to it.  It's like a dark fruit, cherry-like flavor sitting on top of everything else.  It's very nice, but definitely makes it way different from 2014, unless this one ages the same.  I would say this fruit flavor is probably a 3 on the 0-10 scale from 0 being Assassin 2014 and 10 being Backyard or Bramble.  It's definitely present but not overly bold. 1,645 charactersrabbott2, Oct 18, 2016

I was blown away by this beer... it tops SR-71 as the best stout I've had. The balance between sweetness (vanilla, chocolate, and a subtle hint of berries) and barrel qualities is perfect. The mouthfeel is unbelievable... frothy and thick. Just extremely well balanced and smooth.

Chocolate and barrel on the front end with a big, sweet dark fruit finish. Mouthfeel is good but not on 2013 Assassin or SR71 level. I generally like sweet stouts but this seemed unbalanced to me with the sweet fruit on the backend.

A: Black and thick. Small dark brown head with some retention.
S: Smell is of vanilla and marzipan, dried fruits and chocolate. Vanilla and marzipan come by waves. Beautiful!
T: Fudge, vanilla, marzipan and chocolate. Very sweet but still highly drinkable. Flavor profile reminds me of the Brandy Vanilla Dark Lord, in a very well integrated way.
M: Stick and thick. It leaves the mouth completely sticky yet it remains drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden.
O: Very nice surprise. I expected this one to be overly sweet (which somehow it is anyway :-p) and overrated (which is not). The balance and flavor are great. My favorite of the TG stouts. 768 charactersFux, Oct 05, 2016

Overall, Assassin is a beer that is absolutely top of it's class. The 2014 had a bit more bourbon and chocolate aroma, were as the 2013's mouthfeel seemed a bit more rich. Both are outstanding. 269 charactersAwolter, Sep 17, 2016
4.99/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I always imagined what a perfect stout would taste like, but I wasn't sure if they really existed. This is certainly as close as it gets. So thick it coats the glass. A scent so good it almost prevents me from actually drinking it. And when I do taste it, I just wish I had the words to describe it. They should have sent a poet. If I had to take something away, it would have been nice to see more head, but that's just not something you get on a thick, BA stout. Truly remarkable, and deserving of a perfect score because I don't believe it can get better from here. 568 charactersIckyT2012, Sep 04, 2016

Some chocolate and roasted malt notes on the nose.  Big time maple, oak, and vanilla in the flavor.  Maple continues to stand out and is likely a blend of the bourbon notes with the base at this point.  Beautifully integrated base beer and barrel.  Very smooth and rich finish.  Body is perfectly dense without being overly thick.  As good as any BA stout I've had. 442 charactersPHBoiler, Jul 20, 2016

This beer lived up to the hype and then some.  Pours an alluring inky black with minimal head that dissipates almost instantly.  The smell offers a mix of bourbon and coffee.  The taste is spot on for the style, and achieves a remarkable balance.  The bourbon and dark chocolate cut through the sweetness, and there is no bitterness to it.  The mouth feel is spot on.  It is thick and viscous in a good way, and not remotely cloying.  It drinks easily, and the bigger challenge is to sip it patiently, because one's instinct is to keep raising the glass to one's lips.  Overall a phenomenal beer.  Really glad to have gotten the chance to try one of TG's legendary stouts. 718 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, Jun 12, 2016

pours a thick viscous black with a dark mocha 1/4 inch head...which as dissipates leaves a foamy swirl reminiscent of an espresso.... smell and taste are the same, bourbon, milk chocolate, and coffee notes, ...thick, chewy, and very balanced at 2+ years old.....
Overall- absolutely delicious and blew away a couple of amateur beer drinkers at the party!....

Pours absolutely jet black, very small khaki colored head. Completly coats the glass, sticks to everything it touches. This beer smells amazing. Taste is mainly chocolate, some caramel, toffee, and fudge. Tastes almost like a brownie in beer form. Really lives up to the hype. 318 charactersBobloblawlawblog11, Nov 02, 2015
4.01/5  rDev -12.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours a thicker night black color, with no head at all.
Smells of scorched malts, smoothed by milk chocolate, dried raisins and rock sugar. Has a rich, wooden Bourbon quality, which blends perfectly into the malts, evoking a rich chocolate profile, with molasses and matured oak on top. Scorched qualities are quite apparent, together with the slightly spicy barrel foundation.
Has a very creamy mouthfeel, due to its non existing carbonation in combination with a big amount of whipped cream. 
Tastes of molasses from the very beginning, gently wrapped up by earth and profound malts, resulting in a balanced toffee impression. Bourbon gets then introduced by pleasant, hot oak, together with even more smoothing chocolate, this time heading into a bitter chocolate direction, reminding of alcoholic truffels. The bitterness from the chocolate turns more pungent during the finish, still soft on the palate due to the beers rich cream profile. Spicy bourbon completes the rich finish, accompanied by a dry touch, leaving the palate with a long lasting warmth, working its way slowly down the stomach.
The more the beer opens up, the more I like it, especially its finish is stellar, based on its smooth cream foundation, handling Bourbon, licorice and peaty, burned malts. Its slick licorice quality grows a bit too pungent though, amped up by the malts, resulting in a sweet sticky impression, which takes up a bit too much place on the palate. 1,450 charactersaleigator, Nov 01, 2015

For those that are looking to "sell the farm" to get one of these,  I would not go out of my way at all to acquire this.
Taste very good, but a Bit thin.
Nice vanilla and chocolate notes, some heat, minor bite, nothing extraordinary....actually very ordinary.
Overall, solid stout...nothing outstanding. 428 characters4thelvofbeer, Sep 12, 2015

3.74/5  rDev -18.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75First, this is a very good beer.  However, this has to be one of the most over hyped and improperly rated beers on this site in my opinion.
Pours dark black oil with no head.  And, most of the reviews point that fact out.  Yet, they still give a score of 4.5 and such!  I don't get it it!  Any other beer that has no head would not get and "outstanding plus" visual score.  
Moreover, the nose is good but not wonderful.  Several reviews point out weaknesses and shortcomings in the nose which is, indeed, chocolate, vanilla, roasted grains and sweet coffee.  It's a nice nose but perhaps not as assertive as others on the same playing field.
Mouth feel is low carb.  Clearly not outstanding.  Yet, the beer is given 4s, 4.5s and more, despite being somewhat of a flat sweet stout.  
Taste is boozy, chocolaty, vanilla, coffee and thick sweet malt.  Good - very good, and with a nice sweet bitter coffee finish.  
This is a very good good beer.  This is a very good stout.  It is not particularly well made and certainly not an exemplary example of the style.  
Thick, sweet and hard to get do not equal an outstanding beer.  Good yes; outstanding or more?  No. 1,167 charactersGRG1313, Aug 18, 2015

Viscous and smooth appearance.  There's no head but once settled does have a khaki surface layer of carbonation. 
Vivid aromas of fudge and coffee.  Vanilla, oak, and an earthy spice. 
Lots of depth to the taste.  Fudge and coffee are front and center.  Charred oak, black licorice, light soy.  Extremely sweet finish. 
Low carbonation, very smooth.  Only a tad bit boozy which peaks as it warms. 
World class, for sure.  When talking about the king of barrel aged stouts, it deserves to be in the discussion. 530 charactersVonerichs, Jun 30, 2015

4.86/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.752016 Purple Wax - 4.5
Basically room temp - 66 degrees or so
Appearance - Typical dark thick motor oil out of the bottle. Minimal head on the pour, but slightly more than the recent 13/14 assassins that I've had. Typical dark khaki ring that TG has, but with some trailing carb in the center.  Head seems to build higher than the past assassins which pour pretty flat.
Smell - Sugar dominates the nose backed by alcohol/booze. Chocolate base underlines it all with hints of dark fruit mixed in.
Taste - Semi-sweet chocolate up front. Almost sweeter than 2013 was to me off the top of my head. This sugary sweetness mixes with licorice and turns towards bourbon and oak. Burnt char/bitterness takes over at the end which i don't find that pleasant and takes a bit away from the beer to me. 
Overall - Reminds me of a cross between the chocolate and booze that were dominate on 14 with the sweetness of 2013, but lacking the dark fruit that 2013 exhibited on taste.  While its a cross between the two it doesn't seem to exceed the quality of either and kind of fumbles around in the middle. The back end with the bitterness takes away from it compared to 2013/2014.  The carb level of 2016 also exceeds past years by a fair bit making the mouthfeel seem thinner and more fleeting.  Still a top notch stout, but when comparing it to prior batch quality 2016 is bringing up the rear by a fair margin.
2014 Gold Wax - 4.75
Pours like motor oil which builds up your anticipation on the mouthfeel.  Charred barrel, chocolate, bourbon and raisin on the smell.  Significant depth to the taste with fudge & barrel leading the way.  Roast and bourbon pick up on the tail with a bit of sweetness.  Mouthfeel is among the best.  Little to no carb which makes this beer linger in your mouth. and literally 
2013 Yellow Wax - 4.75
Heavy weight near flat motoroil pour.  No real head of any sort.  Sweet sugary aroma mixed with dark fruits and light milk chocolate.  Taste follows aroma with this being much sweeter than the 2014 chocolate bomb.  2013 highlights the dark fruits coated in sugar and mixed with milk chocolate and oak.  Mouthfeel is on par with 2014 that you are basically drinking liquid fudge, lingers forever. 2,221 characters4lo, Mar 22, 2015

A:  Black Oil poured from the bottle struggles to churn up a slight dark brown head.  Only light wisps and a few small bubbles last more than a minute.  Swirling leaves a sticky film that slowly recedes.
S:  Heavy dark chocolate and molasses. Slight coffee. Burnt marshmallows.  Smoky, woody campfire. Bourbon.
T:  Bourbon hits strong in a good way.  Sweet boozy goodness.  Molasses.  Caramel.  More burnt marshmallow.  Dark chocolate. Roasty malts but this is definitely leaning dessert.
F:  Low carb.  Not super thick, but silky and creamy.  Bourbon finishes a little hot.
O:  A pleasure to drink and a great example of the style. 717 charactersTampaRainman, Feb 22, 2015

It's good to have generous friends in beer nerdery circles. Pours brown-black with a thin but quickly dissipating mocha head. Probably the only disappointing feature of this beer. I could smell the Pappy goodness from a mile away once I poured the beer in my glass. Sweet chocolate, molasses, hints of vanilla and marshmallows, and oak in the nose. The flavors were surprisingly softer than expected! The Pappy flavors came through very nicely, cocoa, coffee subtleties, marshmallows, roasted oak and toffee. Thin to medium bodied along with a velvety and a slight burn in the finish. This beer was indeed a level above a coked up Parabola or BCBS! 760 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 06, 2015

4.42/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle sampled out with friends
Appearance:  Syrupy, thin tawny head, opaque. Beer looks like most imperial barrel aged stouts. As thick as BCBS. So, expect a chewy animal.
Smell: Chocolate, almost fudge like, some bourbon (and some heat from the booze), a touch of caramel, and maybe a little bit of coconut.  Smells like a chocolate bar sitting next to a glass of whiskey. No, like freshly baked brownies and an glass of whisky. Much more chocolate present than bourbon. 
T/M Mouthfeel, I am not going to beat around the bush, is thick and chewy. Leans more silky than sticky though, which is a nice surprise and makes it much more drinkable than one would have thought given the viscosity of it.  Taste follows the nose. Chocolate before booze, but booze still present. The chocolate and other barrel qualities (coconut with the faintest hint at vanilla) tone down the booze mostly. Rich. Nice. Warming.
Overall: I was worried that the bourbon would win. I was worried this would be sticky. I worry too much. Enjoy. 1,026 charactersbismarksays, Feb 04, 2015

A heavy pour yields a thick, 1 finger chocolate covered head with excellent stick. Beer is pitch black, oily and very rich. Lacing is thick, web-like and layered with outstanding stick. Top notch!
Nose is fudge, sweet soy sauce, fresh plum and grape, vanilla, chocolate and a creamy hop presence. Moderately aromatic. Pretty average.
Opens chocolate, sweet soy sauce and lactose. Notes of dark fruit. Prunes, grape, vanilla, fudge and cocoa in the middle with a bit of wood and booze at the end. Finishes sweet brownie and cocoa powder. Aftertaste of hop creaminess, mocha and molasses. Excellent. 
Full bodied with low carbonation. Thick and oily in the mouth and goes down smooth and luscious. Messy finish with a filmy, sticky aftertaste. Fantasticly robust and fitting for the style.
Toppling Goliath is putting out a ton of extremely high quality offerings and Assassin is certainly worthy of leading the bunch. Near perfect look and feel for the style with an unbelievable flavor. Definitely worth the hype. 1,133 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 29, 2015

All are out of this world ridiculous with tons of barrel but the 2012 B1 & 2013 were smoother than 2014...  2014 was still pretty boozy.  2012 B2 (Single Barrel Rye Assassin) was great too but the rye was a little overpowering. 402 charactersYodersBeerEmporium, Jan 09, 2015

Smell has incredibly rich decadent aromas of chocolate whiskey vanilla oak And some dark fruit aromas. Taste follows nose with super rich semisweet chocolate malt with notes of cocoa coffee, fudge, and caramel. Whiskey, oak barrel vanilla tannins and roasted marshmallow follow before a sweet jam like berry flavor finishes with notes of red current, boysenberry, and black cherry. Mild smokey malt on the exhale. Inceribly complex beer. Mouthfeel is thick velvety and smooth. 548 charactersFcolle2, Dec 09, 2014

Woody, sticky, and amazing barrel influence. Bourbon shows up, for sure. To me, though, it's the wood character that makes this beer remarkable. Marshmallow, vanilla, yum. A touch of roast to provide some balance. Smell is a little more complex than the flavor, which is my only "knock" on this beer. Mouthfeel is viscous and rich as I've ever had. A beautiful beer in every regard. 457 charactersjbwimer, Nov 04, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +4.8%Poured from bomber into tulip glass. Let it warm up for a good 45 minutes before drinking.
A- black with an dark brown head, looks like chocolate cake with a mousse topping. Delicious. Head dissipates rather quickly into nothing which is pretty normal for a beer with this high ABV.
S- Tons of alcohol, sweet molasses, vanilla and oak. Then coffee seeps in and smooths out the scent. It was kind of a roller coaster ride with the smell. After the coffee, dark fruit and chocolate come in on the end.  
T - Follows the nose almost exactly. Tons of bourbon but the coffee is a lot smoother in the taste than the smell. It coats the mouth like ice coffee does but it tastes like hot coffee (if that makes sense). Dark chocolate comes through on the end and finished real nice. 
M- a little hot, but overall extremely smooth. Very thick as well. 
O- A fantastic beer, I was expecting a little more coffee, but the smoothness of the coffee rivals  BCBCS. I think with a year on this beer the alcohol will tone down and it will get even better. 1,043 charactersmlhyatt, Oct 13, 2014

4.87/5  rDev +6.6%2014 gold wax bottle from trade. Humungo thanks for this one. Pours thick viscous pitch black looking thicker than any beer I have poured, including dark lord and Hunahpu. Not really anything but a ring of dark brown head. Beautiful aroma of vanilla, toasted coconut, caramel, chocolate, oak, bourbon, dark fruit, hint of roast but mostly sweet. Flavor is bourbon up front with toasted coconut and vanilla galore, a hint of chocolate, oak, more bourbon. Finishes with a blast of vanilla bourbon and wood that is just amazing. Thick bodied with low carbonation but not as sickly syrup thick as expected from the look of this thing. TG is just stupid good when it comes to making beer.

Smell: lots of whiskey, maple syrup, some chocolate and some alcohol. low amounts of espresso and roasted malts. 4/5
Taste: opens with a good kick of whiskey, and whiskey soaked dark fruits. strong dark chocolate character. large amounts of sweetness coming in waves of maple syrup and toffee. back end has some oak and wooden character. little to no alcohol. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: extremely thick and chewy. sticks to the glass and the sides of your mouth. strong alcohol warmth but overall drinks very smoothly. 4.5/5
Overall: no doubt this is an excellent beer. almost exactly what I look for in a big chewy barrel aged beer. certainly a treat that I would not pass up on at any chance. 984 charactersSportsandJorts, Sep 12, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -6.1%Popped and domed by myself on a Sunday night.
A - Dark and thick with very little to no carbonation. Coats the glass and stains it quite a bit. No lacing no carbonation dark as night.(4.5)
S - Smell was lots of chocolate and that classic pappy smell that you get in Remy, Rare, others. It's not as much of a marshmallowy smell as I thought it would be. VB Assassin has a definite edge in this category.  Lots of chocolate with some roast and hints of vanilla and bourbon. (4.5)
T - Taste follows the nose, except for the fact of how overwhelmingly sweet this is. This is a bottle that is tough to down yourself(even though its a bomber to share). It's almost cloyingly sweet with loads of chocolate sugary, bourbon, vanilla booze. It wasn't as boozy as I have heard which leads me to believe theres quite a bit of variation. Overall, cloyingly sweet and leaves an unpleasant feeling in the mouth. It's tasty don't get me wrong, but doesn't stack up to TG's other stouts. MD, KBBS, VB Assassin all edge this out by a mile. (3.75)
M - Thick creamy, lingers forever and coats the mouth. After I got through the first half of the bottle it became easier to get through the rest. Started tasting slightly better as it got to 65ish degrees. (4.0)
O - Overall, this was a letdown. It's good, but not world class. It was too sweet. I had a much easier time downing 20+ ounces of MD then this and you would think the Pappy barrels would have mellowed out some of the sweetness. I have another bottle and will either see how it ages and revisit in a year or trade for BA Abraxas or DB Huna which are far superior in my eyes.  
Still a solid effort and a solid beer. 
A friend of mine said his tasted and resembled nail polish remover which further leads me to the conclusion that there is great variation between the barrels or tops and bottoms of these barrels.
Re-review from Abraxas day.
This bottle wasn't quite as sweet but definitely still didn't stand up to the ratings and the recent ratings of gold wax. This almost reminded me of a barleywine this time, not as sweet, still thick and creamy. Just not on par with their other stouts. Not even in the same stratosphere, I think hype is getting people here. I really don't see the 5's and 4.9's and where the are coming from and I am a very generous rater. 
Need to nab a 2013 to compare. This bottle was more of a 4.35 2,378 charactersdrmcleod10, Aug 26, 2014

Pours our thick, dark, and oily black.  Closely reminiscent of a CCB stout with BC Prop oiliness.  Very impressive.  
Brilliant aroma of sweet pappy bourbon (graham cracker, pipe smoke, tobacco, vanilla, oak) molasses, chocolate, caramel and slight umami.  Really pleasant booziness and completely in balance.  Tastes in great balance as well with a nice booziness. 
Outrageously thick - very viscous, full, almost sticky.  Carries the vibrant flavors well - great boozy sweet and bitter chocolate finish. 
This is an astonishing beer. 580 characterstimc100, Aug 25, 2014

4.55/5  rDev -0.4%22oz bomber with yellow wax from the 2013 release, generously shared by lunarbrew with our tasting group today, 6.18.2013. We drank this after the Hunahpu's which we opened up first.
Aroma: Sweet straight up whiskey combined with tons and tons of sweet milk chocolate, a good bit of bitter dark chocolate and coffee accompanied by a little bit of marshmallow sweetness. It smells very sweet and boozy. (4.5)
Colour: Nothing special for a big barrel-aged stout- very very dark brown, almost opaque and black, illuminating dark cola brown. The head comes out as a sexy 1cm mocha head that sticks around for a good while until it slowly dissipates into nothingness, leaving a placid abyss. When it was poured into my glass, it looked super thick coming out of the bottle, thicker than anything I've seen- including Ten Fidy. (4.5)
Flavour: Wow! This beer definitely packs tons and tons of sweet whiskey and chocolate. I swear I'm having chocolate fondue, if you could somehow put your beer on a fondue fork and dip it in chocolate. It's incredible how the subtle vanilla sweetness, ostensibly from the barrel, combines with the chocolate sweetness. It's like marshmallows dipped in chocolate fondue. Normally, this would be bad news for any beer, but no, it was also balanced out with a good bit of espresso bitterness. There is a little bit of dark fruits, but not a whole lot, and there is a small woody oak presence. But this beer is ruled by the chocolate and vanilla oak. A perfect dessert beer. (4.5)
Mouthfeel: This is definitely full bodied, viscous and chewy. Incredible, one of the thickest beers I've ever had. Well-carbonated and I cannot detect much booze at all in this beer. When it goes down, it goes down silky smooth without any heat. It was like liquid brownies.. doesn't get a whole lot better than this. (5)
Overall: This is probably a top 5 barrel-aged imperial stout (without additions like coffee or cherry or whatever) for me. It is up there with BCBS- in fact, the best way I would put it is that this beer is what Goose Island would make if they made a Bourbon County Brand Chocolate Double Cream Stout. So thick, viscous and explosively sweet with complex flavours that complement each other really well. It's worth trying at least once, don't kill yourself getting this beer- its just beer- but be happy if you get the chance to try it! (4.5)
[2013 Final Score: 4.55]
Re-review: of the 2014 gold wax vintage, poured into a Toppling Goliath gold snifter 8/22/2014. This simply isn't as good as last year's. As a whole, the bourbon character is far too strong here as there is very little of the chocolatey fudge goodness that characterized last year's yellow wax version. The nose has a paint thinner, nail polish scent going which was very surprising as last year's had essentially chocolate marshmallows on the nose, which is not to be found here. The mouthfeel is still there in spades, but I would highly recommend aging this for a while. The whiskey almost entirely covers up the normally excellent base stout and I honestly feel that the PVW+TG hype is carrying this beer further than it should be conceivably going based on how it is tasting right now. Still, don't get me wrong- this is a thick imperial stout with a strong whiskey character (think Fifteen with a thick mouthfeel and an acetone-like nose) and it may very well improve significantly with a year on it.

This beauty pours out just the way you love: black as night, and a nice viscosity.nice tan head rimming the glass.
Ooh, nice heavy booze aroma, setting you up for your first taste of awesomeness.taste is great, a little sweetness, chocolately, not overly chewy, just right on the mouthfeel.

The beer is near black with an oily beige head. Whiskey aroma with vanilla, oak, chocolate. Again, absolutely amazing. Big whiskey character with a lovely coffee presence. Full bodied with oak and vanilla. Palate coating. My second favorite of the trio. Fabulous! 319 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 09, 2014

A: Pours a midnight black and settled with a small mocha head. Nice lacing that covered the outside of the snifter
S: Dark Fruits: Figs and raisins. Coffee and roastiness
T: Fig, plum, raisin, coffee and chocolate. Barrel really brings out vanilla sweetness. 
M: Chewy chocolate. Exactly how a BA Stout should feel. One of the best representations of the style
O: Almost exactly what I was expecting from this beer. Thick, dark, roasty and chocolatey. Very gracious of BeersAndBears to share.
Re-Review 2014 Vintage-Gold Wax
A: The most midnight of blacks. Using the term "motor oil" as a descriptor when it pours has never been more accurate. Absolutely coats the glass. Small, dark mocha/brown head which settles quickly to frothy wisps
S: BIG coffee and chocolate. Bourbon/ethanol as it warms. 
T: Really sweet. Lots of chocolate, coffee and dark fruit, emphasis on chocolate.
M: Viscous. Thick. Ridiculously coats the mouth and lingers
O: Whether it is the pappy barrels (maybe) or just the time, thought, and care put into this beer (likely) it is truly one of the best BA stouts I have had. 1,131 charactersHawkeyePA, Aug 05, 2014

S: vanilla, coffee, lots of barrel, wood, rye spiciness, dark chocolate, a little hot booze
T: lots of wood, oak, barrel character; some heat but pleasant for whiskey lovers, the spiciness of the rye definitely comes through and helps cut the chocolate sweetness.  The sweetness is chocolatey milkshake goodness but a little syrupy and cloying.  Dont taste much coffee but it may have faded. 
M: thick creamy mouthfeel, a bit syrupy and cloying but the creaminess keeps it from being Bruery syrup.
O: really good beer, the barrel character really shines and is really well balanced.  The sweetness is a bit too much but the barrel and mouthfeel mitigate the effect.  Still a dessert beer and dont need too much of it, but very enjoyable. Bravo. 895 charactersIrishColonial, Jul 25, 2014

From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2013
Yellow wax
Killer imperial stout aged in whisky barrels
APPEARANCE: A thick, opaque black pour yields a small, foamy, dark mocha head. Pitch black body but with higher levels of carbonation evident. Head fades to a faint wisp and ring. A slight swirly wisp and ring remain leaving falling dots of lacing down the glass. Really black body, but a foamy head and too much carbonation for the style. 
SMELL: Lots of whisky, coconut, milk chocolate, vanilla and lightly roasted coffee. Caramel as well, with oak rounding it out. Nice nose, and plenty forthcoming. 
TASTE: Oak, whisky, coconut and vanilla up front. More oak and whisky through the middle into the swallow. A big, lingering finish of whisky, coconut, lots of oak, milk chocolate and caramel sweetness lingers on the palate. Very sweet with lots of wood flavors, but very little roasted malt and bitterness as balance. There's a lot of good sweetness here, but not enough other components to provide balance. 
PALATE: Medium body and higher levels of carbonation. Very creamy smooth on the palate, slick and silky, goes down smooth and finishes very sticky. A bit of heat lingers on the palate. A touch light and too much carbonation, but creamy and silky. 
OVERALL: Lighter bodied than the other two and very, very sweet. Not quite cloying per se, but definitely too sweet and not enough bitterness as balance. This one definitely suffers from BA Dark Lord syndrome; good in small quantities, but tough to handle otherwise. The fact that people only ever drink this beer in small servings might explain why it gets such inflated scores as well. In the end, this is an interesting creation and I'm very glad to have gotten the chance to try it, but it falls well, well short of the magic that is Morning Delight and KBBS. I would like to try future incarnations of this beer, as an adjustment here or there might really make a world of difference. Thanks again cparles. This was one of the funnest sets we've ever done. 2,158 charactersJeffo, Jul 09, 2014

Having this new vintage, I was decently disappointed compared to what it trades for. It drinks like a whiskey/bourbon barrel Ten Fidy. Chocolate, fudge, umami, dark fruit, but very subtle and restrained barrel character.
(2013)
The beer pours in a dark black color.
The aroma has roasted malt, whiskey, coffee, chocolate.
The flavor follows with a bright kick of whiskey in the front onto roasted malt and longing flavor of chocolate. The beer transitions into a bitter coffee, a hint of apple. On the finish is beautifully onto oak, coconut, and almonds.
This beer certainly had comparisons to KBBS. Arguably just as incredible and one of the best barrel aged stouts out there. 689 charactersdar482, Jun 30, 2014

Pitch black motor oil pour with a thin, quickly fading caramel-colored head with decent lacing. The nose is rich and decadent! Chocolate fudge brownies, espresso, vanilla, whiskey, oak, and dark fruit. The taste is just as rich and very complex with huge chocolate fudge and whiskey notes along with hints of vanilla, oak, cocoa, dark fruits, espresso, subtle coconut, molasses, tobacco, and leather. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and beautifully balanced with a velvety smooth finish. There is a dessert-like sweetness, but it isn't overpowering and doesn't hurt the drinkability at all. Same with the alcohol. It's there throughout, but it's never boozey. Overall, this was well worth what I gave up in trade. Definitely top 3 for BA stouts! Highly recommended!!! 814 charactersbeerdrifter, May 31, 2014

The aroma is ridiculously rich. Huge dark chocolate, bold roasted coffee, heavy oak and whiskey notes, highlight of vanilla throughout. Quite a bit more decadent than other BA coffee stouts, reminds me of bcbcs a bit. Taste starts with coffee and dark chocolate followed by heavy vanilla and richness throughout. A bit of heat towards the end. Mouthfeel is heavy, velvety, and smooth with low carbonation. Overall, fantastic beer.

Impenetrable black pour, with a wispy tan head that receded rather quickly to a thin ringlet; minimal lacing. Pretty basic aroma for a stout, roasty dark malts, toasted grains, notes of bourbon-soaked oak and neutral alcohol; just about no coffee at all. Taste was similar, pretty oaky, roasty dark malts, toasted pumpernickel, slight herbal (or maybe astringent?) bitterness, thin bourbon notes, semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, maybe some dried prunes in there, and again, very little coffee, if any at all, with a stale solventy aftertaste. Body was on the fuller side of medium, but really no more than that, mouthfeel was a little chalky and unbalanced, carbonation was appropriately moderate. A pretty average stout overall. But I guess it's a whale because it's from Bumble****, Iowa. 837 charactersRifugium, Jan 26, 2014

4.66/5  rDev +2%Thanks to Ronald for this little slice of heaven. After many consecutive attempts to grab
hold of this one had fallen through, good ol' Ron shows up to my house, grinning ear to
ear with a bottle to share. What a guy!
Black-hole blackness in a glass; very near vacuum capacity with a slow-forming, deep and
rich leather head that perches on top. Deep tan in color, taking it's time receding. The
opening whiff is a thing of beauty - warming wafts of bourbon slapped atop a base of
semisweet fudge, nutty oak, faint char, dried & roasted coffee, & tepid vanillin.
Let me start off by saying that my expectations for this were already quite high... Not
only due to the crazy hype that is has sparked since its original release last year, or the
various amounts of consistently high reviews across all beer rating mediums from nearly
everyone who has tasted it - but thanks to own inability to safely lock down a bottle.
Cacao nib richness nibbles at the tongue up front with a battle between the bitter &
overly roasted bean aspect with the slightly creamy & sweet underotnes. Decisively
charred malts & toasty barrel notes add an inherent touch of spiciness in the back. A
knockout of there ever was one. Simply a masterpiece on all levels.
Soft hints of whiskey & bourbon booziness trounce there way in, adding not only an
openness of warmth, but another layer of complexity in this magnificent beast.
Hardly is there a flaw to be found; perhaps just a touch more sweetness could play
a better balancing game in the final moments, but I'm clearing nitpicking. It's definitely
rare to find beers crafted this well nowadays, at least from a percentage standpoint.
Don't pass this one up if you get a chance - you will not regret it. 1,735 characterstectactoe, Jan 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I must start by saying I haven't reviewed a beer in probably 3 years because it just wasn't worth it for a while, but this beer blew me away. It was flawless in what I love in stouts. Khaki head when poured, smells of sweet molasses, coffee, chocolate and dark roasted malts. Taste was right there with the smell! Thick and lingering. This beer is one of the few I put up with Berserker but this may be better. I passed on it when it hit the shelves here and now I regret it. 475 charactersmadtowndmb1, Dec 15, 2013

I have to admit that I went into this wanting to keep the hype and expectations of a TG stout out of the equation. Having had Mornin' Delight, and finding it extremely unique and interesting, but a beer that wasn't the world beater many claim...I was mildly pessimistic.
That said, Assassin is a very impressive beer. Thick, sweet, rich, and chewy with a boatload of melted butterscotch interwoven with the decadent dark chocolate base, Assassin drinks like a meal. The bourbon interplay is seamless and delicious, with gentle notes of coconut. Mouthfeel is massive yet lush and the beer stains and coats the glass with reckless abandon.
This beer was drank back to back with Bourbon Vanilla Dark Lord and in this know-nothing's opinion, Assassin is the superior beer. Just a really enjoyable drinking experience in a very crowded field. 886 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 15, 2013

Aroma screams out from the glass, spilling out deep, dark aromas, rich whiskey tones…and it's only sitting on the table, I have yet to bring it up to the nose, here we go…man, this has got it all! Thick, sick, overblown amounts of dark rum, maple, molasses, anise, notes of vanilla and cherry, and overpowering, thundering whiskey (forgot what kind, and I haven't peeked at the label yet.). Every kind of amazing whiskey barrel imperial stout flavor is seeping out of this.
Taste: Damn, this is delicious! Starts with big floods of dark fruit and vanilla, coated in thick, slick whiskey tones. Sweet-ish-like, but never too much so. Huge, vast, voluminous flavors, full-body, persistent finish. Stays sweet-like, basking in deep, dark fruit flavors, you raisins, your dates, your plums and prunes, coated in the whiskey,…it's fantastic! Mmmm…love it.
Now, I want to read the label: "After endless hours of scorching in heat, brewing in turmoil, fermenting in angst, the Assassin's journey has just begun. In the shadow of the temple, he lies in wait, maturing his plot to perfection. He emerges merciless, dominated by darkness, his bite laced with the charred remnants of his victims. No man dares to cross his path. They will forever sleep with one eye open, in fear of the Assassin's hot kiss of death."
I make a lot of hay with the gobbledygook, but this is one of the good ones. I enjoyed that. It tells the story of the beer, cloaked in this mystic fiction, without going overboard.
I definitely wish I had more bottles, to age them and see what happens in maturation, but I also want to feel what this is like young. You can't appreciate one without the other. Maybe someday I'll taste an aged bottle of this, but for now I know it's damned awesome. 1,839 charactersfeloniousmonk, Dec 03, 2013

2013 vintage (yellow wax)
A- Pours thick and used motor oil black, with a thin mocha head, leaving decent lacing.
S- Smells of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, black licorice, coffee, and a fair dose of booze. A lot of figs coming through here.
T- The flavor is incredibly complex. A lot of sweet caramel, molasses, plums, figs, and licorice. Also some milk chocolate and sugar cane. This borders on cloying, but somehow stays quite drinkable!
M- The mouthfeel is super thick, and silky smooth. Just enough carbonation to keep it feeling beer-like.
O- This is a great beer, but a little on the sweet side for my liking. I tend to prefer roastier, more coffee forward stouts. Still a world-class imperial stout! 773 charactersSadMachine, Nov 10, 2013

A: Thicker than the rest. Calmer than you are. This beer has the look of Zhukov.
S: Whiskey soaked chocolate molasses graham cracker
T: This beer is in the few "You have to try this once" category. It can't be explained how pronounced the layers of this beer are. It reminds me a lot of Uncle Jacob's Stout. Chocolate&gt;whiskey&gt;graham cracker. It is a thick tasting RIS.
M: Again, reference Zhukov on consistency, maybe a little less thick. Alan Thicke, rich, smooth. Like his son Benjarvis Green Thicke
O: I am very glad to have tried this. Tastes like Chocolate graham cracker whiskey soaked RIS. Loved it. Although, next time I want this experience, I will crack an Avery Uncle Jacob's Stouts. Twerkin' time 773 charactersgueuzedreg, Nov 09, 2013

Very little carbonation but sticks to the sides of the glass as you swirl it around. Not as thick as BCBS but certainly not thin. The smell is mostly whiskey and also a lot of sweetness. 
The taste is very whiskey-forward with a lot of sweetness following behind that. A very good beer but definitely something that needs to be sipped otherwise the sweetness might get to be too much. It reminded me a lot of Dark Lord but I thought the flavors here were better integrated and smoother than in DL. As it warmed, I could taste the black liquorice that I like so much in a good Imperial Stout. Also, the warmer it got, the more the taste and smell reminded me of World Wide Stout.
So over the course of this review, I mentioned 3 other world-class stouts that I compare to Assassin. This bodes well for this beer in becoming one of the better high end stouts available. Its just too bad that it isn't a little more readily available but that also makes it more of a treat when you get your hands on some. 1,131 charactersmjpolzin, Nov 03, 2013

Appearance. Pours thick and black with a thin layer of light brown head.
Smell. Sweet molasses, smooth whiskey, wood, and chocolate syrup.
Taste. Chocolate and burnt sugar, light smooth whiskey and fresh wood, and some dark berries. Sweet, maybe a little too sweet for me but it's a minor complaint. 
Mouthfeel. Full body, fairly sticky, low carbonation.
Overall. Sweet with big flavours but still smooth and tasty. Thanks again Ryan! 613 charactersRutager, Oct 28, 2013

A: Pours like thick brownie batter/used motor oil/insert imperial stout appearance cliche here. Thick dark head cascades up with carbonation and then recedes to a thin ring, coating the whole glass with a solid brown film. Pretty awesome.
S: Epic nose, full of plenty of whiskey barrel notes and some alcohol fumes; big-time brown sugar and bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate brownie, some molasses and marshmallow. Bourbon and burnt sugars really dominate.
T: Really similar to the aroma, thick brownie batter with dark chocolate, burnt caramel, vanilla extract and oak whiskey barrel. The burn is still moderate after several months in the bottle, but it adds a lot to the palate of this one and cuts the dark sweetness a bit. Brown sugar and molasses really dominate.
MF: Viscous and sticky and THICK; well done. Feels semi-sugary, with lower carbonation. Alcohol cuts the body just a touch.
O: I'm only knocking a few points off because it was still a touch hot to my liking, which I know is normal for a big stout like this - I just think it could have been a touch better with a bit more age. It seemed to me like this brew has a ton in common with BCBS; thick and viscous, dominant bourbon barrel character, burnt caramel and brown sugar. Pretty awesome stuff, and understandably sought-after; I am officially ISO EVERYTHING from Toppling Goliath!

Yes, I'm an idiot. 22 oz. bottle from 2013, drippy yellow wax, split with my wife. Given my encounters with Kentucky Brunch & Mornin' Delight, expectations are...well. If the beer doesn't kiss me, I'll be disappointed. 
Peel away the nicely hardened wax & the beer emerges black, with a good dose of carbonation. Nose warms my cockles: too-thick brownie batter where some wag subbed in a 1/2 cup of whiskey for the Minnesota tap water listed in the recipe. Love. Ly.
Assassin coats the throat somewhere between 5W30 and 20W50. The thickness is remarkable, with a mouthfeel like a heavier version of BCS. Richer than anything liquid has any right to be. Favors the barrel with strong whiskey notes up front, backed by more brownie batter, tons of vanilla, heavy-sweet malts, with roast looking a little lost in the crowd. Crazy drinkable, just because it's so damn good. 
Not only a kiss; I got tongue. Anybody who trades away a bottle of this stuff needs to have their head examined, because it's one of the best. Absolutely amazing beer...& the third-best TG stout I've had. That's borderline unbelieveable. 1,245 charactersmaximum12, Sep 10, 2013

A: Pours a dark black color with a dark brown head forming on the pour. It recedes to a thin ring that leaves some splotchy lace down the glass.
S: Bourbon up front with some dark fruit and sweet vanilla. Chocolate with some caramel notes and some light oak. Roasted malts give it a touch of dryness.
T: The bourbon barrel is up front. Bourbon with some oak, vanilla sweetness and a little burnt sugar. Baker's chocolate with some oak and a honey like sweetness on the finish.
M: Medium to heavy bodied with a slick and oily mouthfeel. Medium to low carbonation with a bourbon sweet finish.
O: A really nice BA stout. Not in the upper echelon, but I'd gladly have this again. Pretty tasty and balanced overall. 834 charactersTreebs, Sep 06, 2013

Perhaps it as due to the beers I had directly previous to this (Dark Lord, Darkness, Bramble, Cherry Rye, and Backyard), but I was underwhelmed with this year's Pappy treatment.  Smooth, but lacking in depth of flavor, I thought this beer was good but not great.  Very glad I didn't end up trading anything away for one.

The beer pours a thick, oily black color, touches of cola brown when struck by the light. A slight khaki head appears momentarily before receding back into the beer, leaving no lace behind. The aroma is of chocolate, whiskey, charred barrel and slightly roasted grain, chewy oak with a light note of astringent phenol alcohol. The flavors are nice, a distinct fruit character is a nice surprise, chocolate is prominent yet again, slight roast, barrel presence is nice, a bit of whiskey and phenol alcohol at the finish. The body is rich and smooth, very silky, coats the mouth very well and finishes with a nice warming sensation.
Verdict: A very well made Barrel Aged Stout from Toppling Goliath. It's simple, it's easy on the palate and it's very smooth, however, it does lack some pinache and at times, comes across as a bit boring. All of the typical components of a great BA stout are there, but none of them really pop. 1,012 characterskevanb, Jul 14, 2013

Appearance - Inky black. Stains the glass. Small mocha head with surface wisps.
Smell - Woo, big rye whiskey aroma. Lightly fruity. Coffee with a bit of its accompanying acidity. Dark chocolate. 
Taste - Whiskey is secondary to the dark chocolate. It spices it up though. Coffee then vanilla. Oak. Lots of sweetness. Rye whiskey sustained throughout.
Mouthfeel - Very thick. Medium carbonation. A little boozy but that isn't a problem.
Overall - Excellent. The beer is great despite that I don't love rye barrels. 573 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 02, 2013

4.64/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752013 vintage, yellow wax. Thanks to Cyclone8 for the bottle. Tasted 24 April 2013, reviewed from notes.
Pours deep deep brown, almost black, but clearly brown at the edges. One finger of dark-tan to medium-brown head, cocoa-colored. Good retention, decent lacing.
Smell is really well integrated, with relatively sweet chocolate-heavy malts overlain by a smooth, rich, dark fruit whiskey-barrel pop. Some roasty notes to the malts, but mostly they're molasses-sweet. The barrel-aging on top makes it bright and full.
Taste is fantastic. Heavy on the chocolate, quite rich, and fairly sweet. The barrel is a bit in the background, but present enough and smooth enough that I just want to keep drinking it. Reminds me of Bell's Black Note in how well the base beer and the whiskey characteristics harmonize.
Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and heavy, but with a little bit of marshmallowy carbonation. Even with the carb, it's still thick, but the bubbles add needed texture and volume to it.
A really top-notch barrel-aged imperial stout. There's a certain character, a grainy sweet pop, that some bourbon-barrel-aged beers have, that I've mostly encountered in -bal barleywines like Arctic Devil and MoAS. This beer has that like no other stout I've encountered. I put it in the top tier of barrel-aged stouts I've had, just a tiny step below the very best. 1,357 characterszeledonia, Jun 28, 2013

vintage 2013; bomber with yellow wax.
Appearance: black bodied beer with 1 finger of medium brown head. Head quickly drops to a thin ring around the glass. A gentle swirl brings back about the original amount of head, maybe even a little more.
Smell: The nose is a little bit whiskey forward, but for the most part its well balanced with the stout. Chocolate, roasty and sweet malts, oak barrel, hint of black licorice and maybe some dark fruit notes.
Taste: Moderately sweet stout that not overly roasty balanced nicely with barrel notes. Fudge and Chocolate, whiskey, oak, coconut, molasses, light roast, hint of dark fruits and leather. Great complexity! The beer seems to meld together nicely in the finish. This beer really opens up nicely as it warms up. 
Mouthfeel: high end of a medium bodied beer with moderate cabonation. This beer has very nice carbonation levels that keeps the big flavors of this beer from becoming too overwhelming. The beer feels silky and a little oily too. This beer isnt boozey at anytime. Really smooth drinking barrel aged imperial stout.
Overall: This beer reminds me of the first time I had Bourbon County Brand Stout back in 2008. This beer is clicking on all cylinders! Its got a lot of complex flavors, smell great, well balanced in both nose and taste and it has a fantastic mouthfeel. This is my second Toppling Goliath stout that I have drank and this small brewery in Decorah, Iowa knows how to brew world class beers! 1,495 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 19, 2013

Vintage 2013 (Yellow Wax)
Poured into a tulip glass from a 22 oz bottle.
Pours a thick and oily dark liquid. There is a nice 1 inch tan head that forms with a vigorous pour. The retention is amazing. The head sticks around for a while and is quite dense and frothy like some nice espresso foam. (4.75)
Aroma starts off with some amazing chocolaty fudge notes drizzled with some bourbon caramel notes. Amazing brew. There is some nice molasses and some slight vanilla notes in there as well. There are some slight dark fruit notes of raisin and prunes mixed in with the coca fudge. Definitely some nice Bourbon notes in there with sweetness but no heat. Very very fudgy. Yum. (4.5)
Wow!! Sooo intense. It is a bit overwhelming of the bat but in a good way. Strong and rich, sweet chocolate notes start things off mixed in with some molasses and whiskey. The middle is also ripe with nice dark ripened fruit. There are some slight raisins and prunes present. There is some mild heat but not really intense or detracting. There is some roast in the middle of the brew past the sweetness that really adds a nice dimension to a brew that is pretty intense. After some warming the slight roast malt notes can be perceived a bit sooner in the palette as well as some nice grainy oat-type notes but it’s very much dominated by the sweet aspects of the brew. The mouthfeel is great, very nice, rich and oily. (4.5)(5.0)
Overall TG is getting some nice props. Well deserved I will say. This brew is sweet and chocolaty with nice whiskey notes but none of the heat. There is a nice underlain roast but it only serves to frame the in-your-face molasses and chocolate fudge notes. (4.75) 1,723 charactersJoEBoBpr, May 19, 2013

Thanks for opening this with me, VaTechHopHead!
Nearly black, though very heavy and substantial looking in the glass. Shiny and oily, with a small brown head that leaves dots of stick.
Monstrous, rich, and lovely aroma of chocolate, bourbon character (without the heat or sting), a bit of vanilla, some raisin, and cake batter. Excellent, and, unsurprisingly, better and better as it warmed.
The flavor is similar to the aroma. Massive amounts of dark chocolate character, bourbon (wood, vanilla, dark fruit) without the accompanying alcohol harshness. This is smooth as silk and the flavors blend together marvelously. This is lacking a big roasted malt note, but it sweet, complex, and incredibly flavorful. 
Full in body. Thick. Chewy. Substantial. Monstrous stuff.
Simply fantastic. I was definitely blown away by this beauty. 850 charactersehammond1, May 12, 2013

Score: 88
Early 2012 vintage bottle (red wax version) served in a Tyranena snifter and enjoyed on 01/25/13. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Coffee color body with minimal head off the pour in the form of mocha-colored swirls. No lacing or retention. 3.5/5
Smell: Vanilla, whiskey, brownies and milk chocolate. Dark fruit too. 4.25/5
Taste: Chocolate, whiskey, and a little soy sauce-like flavor. Burnt caramel, vanilla and a touch of booze too. A little spice. Slightly oxidized, but in a way that plays decently well with the spice quality. A little sweet. No coffee whatsoever. 3.75
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and under carbonated. Has a nice rye-like kick on tongue that makes up for the under-carbonation. Finishes very dry, almost chalky -- like a less dry The Count. 4/5
Overall: This is a really good beer that just did not deliver out of the bottle when aged. I have had this one fresher, and it was much better. The 2012 vintage bottles had some issues (e.g., the brew is filled so high up in the bottle that it leaks if not refrigerated), so I encourage folks to give Toppling Goliath the benefit of the doubt on this one and seek out the 2013 vintage that was just released. I will review the new release when I get my hands on a bottle.
Cost: $20 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle. 1,424 charactersjegross2, Apr 24, 2013

Thick and black. Dark tan head. Very rich. Smooth and creamy. Thick. Chocolate and bourbon at it's finest. Vanilla, oak, and caramel. A touch of booze, but very nice.
This beer drinks very nice and having an earlier batch, I believe the PWV barrels make this better. The first batch I had was shared with me by Clark at Darkness day and although I thought it was good, I think this is better. More smooth, rich, and complex. Better barrel flavors with less harshness.

This is the bramble/backyard rye of assassin. Lots of berries and dark fruits here. Fudgy and chocolate. Warming bourbon. Oaky. Molasses. Very light roasted malts. Thick and chewy. Chocolate covered cherries. This is definitely different than the previous assassins, but I really like it. 4.5 803 charactersmothman, Jan 26, 2013

So here it goes, this is for the gold dipped bottle
Poured from 22oz botlle bottled in Feb 2012 into imperial pint glass.
A-very dark brown with no light getting through and less than a finger of coffee colored head that fades rather quickly to a small ring.
S-sweet molasses type smell with some dark fruit and a little carmel vanilla with a bit of the rye whiskey that seems to have mellowed nicely after almost a year in the bottle
T-molasses and dark fruit come through again, and what seemed a little hot the first time I tried it no has a nice mellow rye on the finish and no hint of the almost 13% alcohol
M-an almost thick and chewy feel to it just like an imperial should be
O-excellent beer that seems to only get better with a little age on it too bad I didn't get more of this, I hope I can get my hands on more. If this was brewed anywhere other than Decorah Iowa there would be a lot of hype for this one. 1,109 characterstvv375ia, Dec 30, 2012

A. Opaque, Dark, looks like an Imperial Stout should look
S. Smells sweet, alcohol notes, a little chocolate and warms the nostrils. 
T. Bourbon definitely come through. It's sweet but alcohol really balances this out. I get chocolate and roasty malt tones. Sipping this slow and taking your time with the beer in your mouth really brings out the complexity of the beer brought on by the templeton rye barrels with a bit of that warm boozy flavor at the end.
M. Medium to heavy mouthfeel, just as I think it should be. 
O. I am a fanatic about stouts. I try every stout that I think warrants a tasting and I hold this beer in high regard. It's on par with some of the better stouts I've had out there. I'll look forward to more stout offerings from TG...a great little Iowa brewery. 946 charactersJrhorner77, Jul 06, 2012

3.65/5  rDev -20.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from 22oz gold dipped wax bottle into Tulip.
A. Pours slick out of the bottle. No head at all. No lacing. Color is pitch black. 
S. Dominant smell is molasses. Then some roasted malt, a little chocolate, and then alcohol. Actually has a pretty hot smell to it. A little bit of vanilla comes out as it warms up. 
T. First flavor is molasses, then roasted malt, a tiny bit of coffee. The off putting part of this beer is that every drink finishes with a soy sauce flavor. Imperial Stouts are not suppossed to be salty. The aroma and taste of this beer is really more along the lines of an American Strong Ale than an Imperial Stout. The alcohol is well hidden in the flavor. The taste improves as it warms, but you can not get away from the Soy Sauce flavor. My wife tasted to confirm that I was not crazy. Not a lot of flavor to begin with, and then you get that off flavor on the back of the tongue with every drink. Not sure where that flavor would come from, oxidation maybe. Really the firt time I have ever tasted that flavor in a beer.
M. Medium bodied. Should be thicker for a 13% Imperial Stout. Very low carbonation. Finishes with the weird soy sauce flavor. 
O. Waited a long time to get my hands on this beer, with the Red Wax overfilled or seeping issue. This beer reminds me more of a strong ale with its flavor. Actually kind of reminds me of Hebrew Jewbilation series, just wish it tasted as good as those beers. I can not get past the soy sauce flavor in this beer. My biggest disappointment probably comes from having tried Kentucky Brunch before this. Kentucky Brunch is a damn good beer. One of the better barrel aged beers I have had actually. Assassin unfortunately is not on that level. Assassin lacks depth in aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel. For $20/bottle this should be a lot better. My hope is that the other 2 bottles that are actually able to be stored at room temperatur improve with time. 1,927 characterssiradmiralnelson, Mar 04, 2012

3.65/5  rDev -20.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured thick and dark brown with a thin tan head.
The smell is powerful, very big molasses, vanilla, and dark fruits all mixing here.
The flavor is a bit messy to me, very sweet with lots of dark fruit and I get a lot of vanilla, but just a hint of oak or bourbon. The roasted barley and dark grain flavors are surprisingly mild as well and are out competed by the sweetness.
The mouthfeel has a nice thickness to it with a bit of oilyness.
A pretty average beer for this style, the alcohol is well hidden and its easy to drink, but a bit messy and feels to me like it needed more time in the barrel. 604 charactersbashiba, Feb 26, 2012
3.6/5  rDev -21.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bomber into a tasting glass.
A: Opaque black color with a scattered beige residue of diminishing bubbles. Scant lacing remains on the glass.
S: Bourbon is represented well, heavy on the vanilla but with less toasted oak, fitting nicely with deep dark fruit. The most distinctive part of the smell is the cakey roasted malt, suggesting decadence. No alcohol is detected.
T: Begins sweet, with dark chocolate and muted bourbon spirit. Acidity is detectable but restrained into the middle, where syrupy dark fruit and aromatic wood are discovered in transition. The finish shows a whiff of ethyl alcohol, establishing a boundary that must be stepped over only to find an obnoxious thread of scorched popcorn waiting to linger on the palate.
M: Thick viscosity, syrupy and chewy on the palate, with low carbonation.
D/O: This bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout represents a fair attempt at the style, and is endearing in its missteps. Perhaps it sets the bar too high with its impressive smell, but unfortunately some of the key features in the nose do not match up with corresponding flavor qualities. Textures are also decadent and rewarding, probably helping to elevate the features of the flavor profile that would otherwise seem disjunct and very average by comparison. It serves best in the capacity of dessert beer, where the sweetness and moderate spirit influence are not found to be out of place. 1,421 charactersbeagle75, Feb 26, 2012
3.55/5  rDev -22.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a pair of pint glasses. Extremely dark brown, almost pitch black with a reddish hue near the edge of the glass. Essentially no head and absolutely no lacing.
Smells of chocolate and dark, tart cherries. Based on the issues they had with the seeping, I'm picking up a faint note of soy sauce that will hopefully fade in the taste.
The taste is super roasty. Dark chocolate and think molasses towards the front with a deep red fruit. Virtually no bitterness in this one. The finish of this one gets real boozy. To my knowledge, this is one of their first barrel aged beers and it's certainly over the top. I'm a fan of barrel aged stouts but this one is borderline overdone with the finish.
Quite thick and full bodied up front with the flavor complexities. The finish is pretty smooth (albeit boozy) when you get to the barrel character. Much more carbonated than the lack of head indicated.
Overall, a pretty good first attempt. Respectable complexity that keeps you drinking. However, in the end, the booze bomb is a little overwhelming. This was from the red batch that had to remain refrigerated. I can't help but wonder how much this one would smooth out if I had been able to cellar it without it leaking all over the place. 1,265 charactersqthompso, Feb 24, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was put out of my misery while drinking from a tulip glass. This was from the first barrel batch sealed with red wax, bottled January 2012.
Appearance- This imperial stout pours with no sound, so incredibly heavy and sticky. A slight width of dense, brown sugar foam dissipates to a ring and leaves behind no lace. The beer itself is darker than black.
Smell- Sweet and a little punch of heat from the whiskey barrel. I mean, brown sugar, figs, a little chocolate; they make the nose incredibly enticing.
What is great is how the booze envelops all of these qualities to remind you this is still an imperial stout ready to finish you off. It gives the nose a woody and leathery note.
Taste- What a monster of a stout: it begins sweet once again and then takes you on a roasty and boozy ride. Assassin brings on the dates and brown sugar. Right after, there is a bit of roasted coffee and smokey whiskey.
The finish has that distinct leather and smokey booze, with a touch of coffee roast, figs, and dark chocolate. The next sip cannot come fast enough.
Mouth feel- Toppling Goliath knows how to make a big stout punishing to the palate, and the feel is no exception. The thick and chewy feel is outstanding. It is almost a syrup, leaving the lips feeling sticky. 
The sticky quality makes the smokey and sweet finish lasts until you take yet another sip of this slightly dry stout.
Overall- I am trying really hard to find much fault with this beer: I suppose the biggest "complaint" you can have is that coffee is almost non-existent, and had it not been mentioned as being brewed with coffee on the bottle I might not have noticed.
Othewise, the whiskey is just big enough to to be noticed, but not so big it the only thing on the palate. The flavors range from sweet, to smokey, to roasty. And the mouth feel is fantastic. I have no problem saying this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had.
Edit: I had the gold wax version in a glass mug. It was bottled in February 2012.
Appearance- Main difference is almost no foam produced, still incredibly black. Same score.
Smell- Not nearly as much heat or woodiness here, still present but very buried under the sweet notes. Same score.
Taste- The whiskey and woodiness is much more pronounced in the finish with some vanilla. The dark fruits are a lot more subdued in this one. Brown sugar is still big and the roast is almost non-existent. 4.5
Mouth feel- I am still super impressed by this feel. No change.
Overall- I would bump the overall score down to a 4.5 for the gold wax just because it tastes a little more boozy and less sweet and complex than in the red wax offering. Still a great imperial stout that I look forward to putting some age on. 4.5 2,729 charactersPintofbrown, Feb 20, 2012
