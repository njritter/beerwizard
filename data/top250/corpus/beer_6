Well this is interesting. After much ado in recent days about Pliny The Younger's return to Philadelphia, where I chose not to go because of the crowds and having to wait in line, I came across some old notes from 2010. I don't remember where I had it, but it was on tap, and I had the Redemption and Sanctification as well. I think it might have been at the now closed Resurrection Ale House. Anyway...
Notes: Clear deep gold body beneath a short head of white. Very fine bubbles can be seen steadily rising which suggests that there's some body to it. Good head retention, but better lacing - it left a solid ring at the outset, and then spots throughout the glass. The aroma is resinous as in hop resins, not pine resin, but it's also softly piney. It's tropical/citrusy with what I think of as orange peel, and some peach, apricot, pineapple, and mango. Some grassiness as well. The flavor is honeyish with a tangerine note, and a little bit of everything suggested by the aroma. It's full bodied, and the dextrinous golden malt is rich, but not sweet. It supports the hops and balances the bitterness, or vice versa. It's a solid bitterness, but not brash. It's actually very refined. The alcohol plays a part in the flavor profile but doesn't stand out on its own. So much richer and fuller than the Elder, and more about balance than "wow". 1,395 charactersNeroFiddled, Mar 03, 2017

4.6/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at Bru Craft & Wurst in Philadelphia and we can cross this off the old bucket list. 6 oz. pour. Should be noted they had problems getting the keg going and they had to pour into a pitcher, let the head/foam die back a bit, and then pour into snifters.
L: Minimal head left by the time the glasses got to us, just a thin ring. Beer is a deep, clear golden.
S: All orange, pineapple, and mango, but in a West Coast restrained way rather than FRUITBOMB. A little bit of light malt and some earthy dankness.
T: Follows nose. Lots of pineapple, orange, tropical fruit from beginning to end. Light malt. No alcohol detectable. 
F: Medium to full bodied, light to medium carbonation. Good drying via ABV and carbonation mix. Absolutely the best construction and balance I have ever experienced, thus I believe this is the first 5 I have ever handed out for mouthfeel and it is well deserved.
O: It lives up to billing, is the best way I can put it. Is it worth the extended effort to get it? That's up to you. If they made more, it probably wouldn't be as good. Would I love to set it alongside Kane's Third Reef and Ocelot's Throwing Backwards and really give it a test? Yes. In any case, I'm glad I got to try it out. 1,224 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Feb 27, 2017

Pours an orange color with a lacing of bubbles. Creamy citrus smell. Resin-y feel with a touch of carbonation. Taste is pretty much all hops, smooth citrus and pine flavors with no harshness. The impressive thing about this is that the smell and taste are all hops, but it's so smooth and less bitter even than many single IPAs. You would never know this is a 10.25% ABV either, it hides the alcohol well. Overall, it's a great beer. I'm glad I got to try it, but I don't know that I'd stand in line for hours to have it again. For my money, I think Westvleteren 8 is better. 697 charactersdetgfrsh, Feb 19, 2017

L: Slightly hazy amber orange with a thin half finger head that dissipated fairly quickly.
S: I expected the smell to be a little more pungent.  Still a nice blend of oranges, mango, and a little lemon followed by some subtle sweetness.
T: For me, this beer is all about the malt.  Yeah, it's a hop bomb.  But, I don't think the hops stand out more than in Pliny the Elder.  You get a fair amount of resinous pine bite upon first sip and then this flood of malty sweetness to quell the bite.  This lets some of the citrus flavors come out without it being juicy.  I imagine candied oranges.  I've had a number of triple IPA's that have a bit of ethanol tang on the finish.  This was totally absent in PtY.
F: Smooth.  Very Smooth.  Almost buttery.  Great mouth feel and very drinkable.  Perfect carbonation.
O: Oh yeah.  It's that good. 864 charactersbrewaddict, Feb 15, 2017

L: Clear Yellow with a good amount of head.
S: Orange and maybe mango, some other citrus smells, then definitely hops to finish it off but not over powering.
T: Huge amount of hops up front, but very smooth at the same time. Nice fruit flavors to balance the hops. 
F: Exactly how a triple IPA should feel.

If you were walking through a fruit orchard that had all the best fruit trees in it, and a warm breeze blew all the scents into your nose at once, that's the smell.  The taste that follows is similar, but add in notes of pine and nutmeg to go with apricot, mango, tangerine, peach, and who knows what.

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ooo baby. Watch this guy strut. Pliny the Younger's man-parts walk into a room and commands the attention of all the occupants a good five minutes before the man himself arrives. It snaps and yells and gets everyone to stand up in salute, looking astute and respectful as the man himself is about to enter. And the man? He himself is just a bunch of man-parts stitched together with the precision of the best cosmetic surgeon ramped up on the stress and the pressure of knowing his (or her) creation is set to be on every adult website one day. Looked at in high-definition 4k, 8k, retina display, 180-degree SBS VR technology. Gawked, ogled, eyes-gaped by thousands in the privacy of their home doing to themselves things in ways only they know they enjoy. The work has got to be perfect and indeed it is. Pliny the Younger takes no prisioners, makes no promises, and yet is promoted again and again to high legendary status. Some scoff at the hype, deeming themselves too cool for truth, banishing themselves to lesser beers deluded into thinking they still have their pride. Pliny the Younger strips these hip-types to the nude and laughs at their single excuse for a man-part. You can't even please men with those parts, he says. Your women must thirst for more every night, he goes on, waking you up at all hours in disbelief that it's over. They want more says Pliny the Younger. And when they get their heads on straight your women, he says, come to drink from one of my many abundant man-parts all stitched to me like a Picasso meets Rembrandt. And he laughs and laughs, bellowed out from deep inside, hearty and foul putting Santa on the naughty list and driving Satan to the hills of heaven. That's Pliny the Younger. And it's number 1. 1,746 charactersChristianAlexander, Sep 28, 2016

The taste does not live up to the hype. After sitting and warming up it became more complex and really developed into a much better beer. If I was sitting down and had to choose between the Elder, Younger, or Blind Pig - Yes I would take the younger but only because it comes out once a year. With that being said I prefer the Blind Pig 452 charactersa_daniel_life, Jun 24, 2016
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Monk's in Philadelphia.  Had this before the hype escalated to the point of long lines or lottery tickets.  Just a beer I'd seen was rated highly (but not then top 5).   So, obviously, this rating comes years after the drinking, which is probably not legit, but it also mean my response was not prompted by any circusy hoopla or the allure of scarcity.  I didn't even know at the time that the Younger was hard to find.  I just happened to be at Monk's.  So I write, belatedly to say:  this beer was a revelation, an epiphany.  And I think that's where much of the hype comes from, which is to say I think it's at least partially justified.  The way Pliny combined maximal hops intensity without any harshness to the bitterness, the complex shifts among pine, citrus, grass, the way 10% alcohol could be so hard to detect--it's not only that I'd never had anything quite like that, but that I had never had a beer that tasted so amazing.  Unlike many fine beers I have sought and had in the decade since, I remember the first sip with complete clarity and detail.  So, yeah, look, nose, mouthfeel were all excellent, but the taste--from that first sip through the bottom of the second glass--was extraordinary.  While there are very good IPAs of DIPAs whose ratings seem to me to be much inflated by the difficulty of snagging the beer (Heady Topper, e.g.), I don't think this is one of them. 1,402 charactersprofessorchow, Jun 21, 2016

Yes, it’s overrated. Yes, it’s west coast. But yes, it’s awesome and worth the hype in some respects. This is the OG hop bomb. Pours a clear golden orange with a white head. Aromas of grapefruit, candies, orange, dank hops, alcohol. Taste is not crazy bitter, there is some hop flavors in there followed by some strange piney smokiness then there’s a tad of alcohol heat. I can see why this came to the top of our beloved RB list and has remained there simply out of respect. On to the next one... 605 charactersArtmcd88, May 15, 2016

Taste wise drops a ton of hops without being overly aggressive bitterness wise, you get a plethora of the usual descriptors, citrus, pine, grass, tropical fruit (lesser extent).  Amazing it its ability to be light, dry and massively strong without letting you know it in the taste.
I give Lagunitas Waldo's a nod above it even though its basically the same beer.  That is available in bottles, this is draft only with lines unless you go to the dipa festival. 603 charactersrodbeermunch, May 05, 2016

4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I found myself in Philly with the family for the weekend.  Serendipitously this trip coincided with some Younger tappings.  Had a pleasant wait at the front of the line outside of Monk's Cafe, which was good enough to get one of the five or so seats at the front bar.  6oz pour served in a wine glass.
4.0 A:  Nearly clear golden color.  One finger of white lacing.
5.0 S:  Superbly resiny and grassy, yet ultimately clean overall.  Also tons of tropical fruits in there - mango, pineapple, papaya.  The intensity of the aroma is where it's at though.  I kept an inch in my glass for quite some time so I could keep smelling it.
4.75 T:  Moderate bitterness.  Resiny, grassy, tropical hops.  Had an Elder to compare and surprisingly it tasted quite similar, just a bit more intense.
4.75 M:  Medium body.  No alcohol to speak of.  Lightly spritzy and quite creamy.
5.0 D:  Awesome beer that may be worth the wait in line, but not something I'd travel for.  Having joined BA when this was THE beer atop the best of list, I'm glad I finally got to slay this whale. 1,067 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 11, 2016

Beautiful beer, golden wheat color, clear and beautiful carbonation. Thin, pure white head that laces beautifully all the way through. Aroma is rather gentle and subtle, smells nice, the aroma is more malt.
Beautiful balance here in taste and feel. Hop forward with a nice progression all the way through.
So happy to have tried this beer. 499 charactersNachojon, Mar 04, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5So today, I got to try super-rare Pliny the Younger at Slater's 50/50 in Anaheim Hills. I'll put this into perspective: I'm a fan of Russian River's beers. Elder, Consecration and Blind Pig are among my all-time favorite beers. Do I think the Younger is worth a three-hour wait? If just for the beer itself? No. However, It was a great opportunity to socialize with other beer-lovers.
Is the Younger a damn good beer? You bet it is. It's rich, citrusy, piney flavor is beautifully balanced by a syrup-thick mouthfeel and malty milkshake-sweetness that's absolutely superb. I'm not debating the quality of the beer here. It's the hype behind it, and the trouble people go to obtaining it. You'd think Younger was made from white truffles and 24k solid gold by how crazy people go over it.
There are so many great beers out there that are underrated, that many people don't know about. You can obtain Trappistes Rochefort 8 from BevMo, and it's an equally good, if not better brew than Younger. If you're ever out in Denver, Colorado, Odessa Brewing Company makes a mean double IPA that hangs with the best of 'em. There are German selections out there that are just tops. 
So if you don't make a Younger tasting, you're simply missing out on only one great beer in an endless sea of great beers. It's good, but it's not the "best ever," as some make it out to be. You could sit at home with an easily-had Rochefort or Grapefruit Sculpin, and enjoy yourself without all the stress and chaos. Cheers! 1,500 charactersAntnego, Mar 03, 2016

We've all heard about how great this beer was, but many of us haven't had the chance to have one.. Some would say its not worth the lines you'd have to wait for a glass or its price. Maybe some would hate on its hype. This beer is worth all its hype! its such a light triple IPA. Nothing like any other 10% beer I've had before. Looks and smells amazing. its darker then I thought it would be. The hype is so real. 467 charactersJbagel1, Mar 02, 2016

The nose has a lot of piney hops, pale bread, tangerine, light grass. Medium sweet flavor with some juicy melon, tangerine, light piney bitterness, peach, alcohol. Full bodied, lightly chewy, with fine to average carbonation. Warming finish, lightly resinous, with lots of juicy citrus fruits, tangerine, some grapefruit, nips of boosty alcohol, orange, mango, mellow bitter grass and citrus rind. Well, it’s very good, and very drinkable, but there are more expressive ’imperial’ IPAs out there nowadays. Still, I can appreciate that this is juicy and drinkable stuff. 656 charactersleighton, Mar 01, 2016

Clear, light amber color with little head.  Sweet vanilla, orange and papaya nose with just the slightest, slightest hint of barnyard animal aromas, but in a good way.  Creamy, rounded and well balanced flavors of vanilla, citrus and tropical fruit with just the right amount of hops.  Had a pint of the Elder next to the Younger for comparison purposes and I can say the Younger is no comparison.  Big, big triple IPA with smooth and delicate features.

It's that time of year when I stalk my social media accounts waiting to see where it may or may not get tapped. I hope to try a couple more times before this season is over. 
The appearance is bright with citrus.  Smell is juicy. Taste is smooth as can be, hard to believe it's a triple. Feel makes me think the trouble to try this beer is worth it. Overall happy to say I had one but I'll be happier if I can find a couple more. 552 charactersTBedeezy, Feb 19, 2016

The beer is a beautiful, crystal clear, orange-gold color. On the nose there is a tone of pine with some sweeter tropical fruits to finish off. The taste follows through on the nose very well: massive pine hop bitterness with some smoother tropical fruits such as mango and pineapple to balance out the taste. I can't believe this is a 10.25% abv beer; it tastes like a 8% beer. As per any Russian River beer, its balance is outstanding and what sets it apart from the rest of the pack. I'm sure there are more hoppy, aggressive Triple IPA's out there but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better balanced one. 638 charactersRLM15, Feb 18, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had Younger on RRBC in 2014 and 2015. Both years have been great. The malt profile of RRBC is unique in comparison to other IPA's. Younger only builds on what Pliny is. Drinkability is great. Very hard to tell that you're drinking 10-11% abv beer. I've had the best IPA's in the world and this is still my favorite with Heady being a close second. Look forward to the 2016 batch. 384 characterspaint94979, Jan 11, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I feel like such an irresponsible goober for not having ever reviewed this phenomenal big ass hoppy elixir. I have had the privilege to drink both 2014 and 2015 versions and I will review it in general, based on both but realistically mainly based on the 2014 edition for it was vastly and clearly superior in every way possible way.( Even though both were 5's) maybe this years was 4.99 but whatever.
2014 was just over 11% abv
Appearance: similar to elder, maybe ever so slightly lighter and more golden and bright.
smell: fuck, hard to describe but it smelled delicate and beautiful. fruity and sticky, and dangerously dank and fresh. no alcohol to detect. the smell was so perfect for a triple IPA behemoth. 
taste: every single one of my taste buds was tingling. all of my taste pores / receptors were activated 110%. at the time i had never experience quite a sensation but alas, i don't want to veer into mouthfeel. taste was juicy, sweet stone fruits, a little tangerine, orange, sweet cutie flavors. 
hints of lemon zest and fresh grass / pine. The fresh pine needle, christmas tree action is real and amazing.
 mouthfeel: smooth smooth smooth smooth tingly smooth smooth smooth smooth soft smooth smooth smooth delicate smooth smooth smooth smooth smooth, drinkable, smooth smooth smooth, ideal carbonation, smooth smooth smooth smooth.
overall: perfect. like, lets be real, no other triple IPA on the planet comes close? can anyone on this site name any triple IPA that even comes close to this? nah 1,516 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Nov 05, 2015

4.45/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Went to the tapping at the South Philly Taproom in Philadelphia. Full blown blizzard, everyone was out of work for the day. The line wasn't too bad, only about 30 people at 930ish for a 10am tapping (the line grew a ton in the last 10 minutes however). Pours were $10, first come first serve, keg was kicked in 19 minutes. Color was a beautiful orange-y gold, head was thin. Served (unfortunately) in a  skinny taster glass so I couldn't get much in the way of the nose (or maybe it was because I waited outside forever in the freezing cold). Taste was a little dank, but with some citrus. Sticky but had a fresh bouquet of hops on the back end that balanced everything out. Was tasty and I can see what the hype is about, but I don't think I'd be willing to stand in line for more than an hr to get a pour. Definitely a bucket list/BA Top 250 experience though for anyone who hasn't tried it yet. 897 charactersK4550, Aug 26, 2015

App: ½ finger head, some floaties, soapy bubbles. Low retention. Orange-tropical color.
Smell: Intoxicating! Citrus, tropical aromas, pineapple juice, dank and sticky. Pomelo bitterness and lovely tartness. Fresh-squeezed OJ.
Taste: More of that pepperiness, super spicy, pineapple cake, piney. Don Limpio. Orange rind. Aggressive hops, lip-smacking. Oily, resin, like licking sap. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body and low carbonation, could use more bubbles. Dry, sticky finish, need water! Spicy, peppery all around- not too pleasant. 
Overall: Very drinkable! Like water, poundable. World-class? Not so, but delicious. Worth trying once or twice, but I wouldn’t go crazy or stand on line for it. There are many wonderful Triple IPA’s out there these days… (Knee Deep is making some killer ones!). 949 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Aug 19, 2015

Aroma was particularly alluring. I wouldn't wait 8 hours like some people do for it, but there's really nothing that compares in terms if IPA. I recommend you get to whatever venue it's hosting earlier than two hours before tapping, or wait in line with the other hundreds. 400 charactersdeepsleeper, Aug 18, 2015

It is a spectacular beer to have straight from the source. Although a very high abv it does not taste alcohol forward and is truly balanced with a good amount of hops on your tongue, a bit of grapefruit follow through and a floral scent. Had a great time drying off and warming up and 3 10oz pours along with some Elder and Blind Pig hit the spot. It is a special beer worth the effort. 477 charactersBiggiekrock627, Aug 14, 2015

4.6/5  rDev -1.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer manages to do the "look" well - pale straw, makes you anticipate a pils if you just saw the glass but had nose plugs in. Take those nose plugs out though - big floral and citrus  aromas, some pine. Once you take a swig, the taste transforms into a berry/pine marijuana  flavor on the tongue. Mouth is smooth, and dry. Overall, this hop combination has likely been perfected, and better beers only occur because they approach with different combos. 457 charactersAJKing, Jun 27, 2015

The floral smell at the start told us this was a different brew. It was smooth with an overall amazing taste. Hard to believe it was over 10%.  By far, the best beer I've had. 386 charactersDgc3043, May 26, 2015

A - Pours a dark amber color.  No head on the glass we got since they were pouring and walking them out to us. It had dissipated by the time we got it.  Looks very similar to Elder.
S - Sweet hops.  Tropical fruits, pine.  The 11% is no where to be found.
T - I must say this is the smoothest triple I have ever had.  Again, sweet hops up front, lots of pineapple, underneath the sweetness is a piney, resinous, dank note.  People say its like Elder cranked up, and I can see that.   As it warmed, much more bitterness came out, as well as some candied orange.  
O - Did this live up to the hype?  Yes.  Its delicious.  Best triple I have had.  Would I wait hours on hours for a small pour of this?  Probably not. 775 charactersjow_42, May 01, 2015

Awesome beer. Finally got to have a full pour of this in Colorado. 
Clear orange, golden color. Classic looking IPA. 
Smells like Elder, very piney, some citrus, aromatic, definitely. 
The taste amplifies the smell: very full. A nice amount of sweetness and intensity over Elder. Not boozy by any means. Just awesome. 
A great IIIPA. Not quite big enough to be a triple really nowadays, but still, the balance and exposition of the beer stands on its own. Very nice. 484 charactersraynmoon, Apr 26, 2015

10oz pour at Britannia Arms Almaden in late February. Served in a lowball glass.
4oz pour at Harry's Hofbrau San Jose, 15 days after initial brewery release. Served in a small snifter glass.
A: Medium to dark orange in color. 1/2 a finger of head that dissipated quickly. Clear, not cloudy in the least. Great looking beer, very similar in appearance to Elder.
S: Malty sweetness right upfront with pine and tropical fruit. Passion fruit, orange, tangerine come through as well. Sweet malts in the background, makes me think of cake or frosting. No alcohol to be found in the aroma, the 11% doesn't come through even a little bit. Catty aromas from the simcoe are definitely present. Incredibly delicate, takes several passes to really process everything going on.
T: Sweet pineapple upfront, pine, and sweet malt. Oranges, tangerines, tropical fruits in the middle mouth and finish. Little bit of bitterness but not very much. 
M: Medium to large mouthfeel, this is the only place where the size of the beer really comes through. Medium carbonation and a clean finish.
O: This one lives up to the hype. An incredibly well crafted triple. Easy drinking, smooth and delicious. The best beer in the world? I don't think so, but not far from it. I give this one a perfect score because it's amazing and there's no beer like it. 1,357 characterschrisjws, Apr 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ok, had to find out what the hype was all about.  Waited 90 minutes and was told I was a genius for going on a Tuesday.  The nice thing is, Russian River only allows in as many as can be seated (none of the usual madhouse, quite civilized) and they charge the normal pricing for it (and are proud of it!  Truly a labor of love!).   Background:  I'm not a hoppy guy.  Doppelbocks, stouts, porters, ciders are where I live.  This beer changed all that.  Smooth, amazingly smooth with a hoppy finish at the back / center of the tongue.  Not overpowering at all in taste but packs a punch at 10%.  Very much worth the wait.  Best beer I've ever had?  Yes.   Easily the best IPA.  Got to enjoy seven (10 oz) glasses this year and I'll be back for more next year. 757 charactersWendt, Apr 02, 2015

Appearance - Clear orange body with a small white head.  A few wisps on the surface and a thin collar.
Smell - Orange.  Some pine hops.  Lots of caramel malt, but doesn't smell all that sugary.
Taste - Tastes like an amped up Pliny.  Orange hops up front.  Sweet pale malts.  A touch of booze.  Pine hops build in the back end with a moderate bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Medium heavy.  Not a sugar bomb, which I was afraid of.  Medium carbonation.
Overall - Glad I got to try it.  It's very good.  I'd take a lot of things over it, especially if it avoids a trip to CA to get a taste. 663 charactersAlieniloquium, Mar 14, 2015

Still, I had a great time and probably will too.  Just don't expect to have your mind blown, Younger is good but this is an over-hyped release that owes its weeks of long lines to those who suffer from FOMO.
Row 2 however, is the bomb. 491 charactersPhishyninja, Mar 12, 2015

Surprisingly disappointing nose but hard for the beer not to be disappointing given all the hype. Nice, little fruity, not too overpowering. 
Mouth feel standard, little less bubbles than average. 
Light pretty pour with a small head
Taste was clean - reminded me a bit of heady topper. Couldn't really taste the alcohol - definitely a nice bitter clean ending which somehow reminded me of a stainless steal finished white wine. 483 charactersMichaelPhiladelphiaBeer, Mar 09, 2015

A&S: Very aesthetically pleasings. Fluffy white head with great retention, leaves a large amount of lacing. The beer is a transparent light orange, it semi-lively as far as carbonation goes. I was getting a little thrown off aroma wise being located right by the open kitchen area, but from what I picked up, it wasn't super powerful. I was mostly getting citrus, passion fruit, and floral notes.
T&M: The thing that stood out the most to me about this beer is the bitter profile. Very well balanced, with just enough of a kick at the end. Not super powerful, I was definitely expecting less subdued, but was similar to the aroma. Very velvety full bodied beer. Extremely drinkable. 
Overall: A great beer. I was a little disappointed (in my opinion it didn't live up to the hype), wouldn't include in my top ten, but still extremely good. 916 charactersminterro, Feb 24, 2015

Younger is different every year, depending on the quality of the hops (growing season, weather at harvest, etc.) and other factors.  Over the last 7 years I have been drinking Younger,  I felt 2015 was the best I had tasted.
But 2017, this the second week of the release - well - this is different.  And I mean different.  Two new hops were ADDED this year - Azacca and Comet - for a total of 8.  As my friend put it, an East Coast style layered on a Pliny base.
And the result is spectacular.  I won't even try to completely describe it.  Drinkable.  Complex does not do it justice.  Flavors everywhere.  Smooth.  A triple unlike any I have tasted (and I have tasted quite a few) and the best IPA of any level I have ever tasted (even beating out Elder, which remains my overall favorite - after all, Younger is around just once a year).
I think this is a new category within IPAs, not East Coast, not West Coast or any other IPA category - an IPA style all of its own.  A 5 ranking does not do it justice.  I'm just glad I had the opportunity to get it this year!
2015 - I have been attending the Pliny the Younger release for several years.  I have never rated the beer before.  It has always been very, very good.
2015 is the most balanced Younger I have tasted.
It is great.  There are no competitors.
Period.
Hint - ask for a tulip glass, pour the Younger in it and let Younger warm for 15 or 30 minutes - it will be better than you even imagined. 1,474 characterssimcoeluv, Feb 17, 2015
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Best beer ever. Had the 2015 edition. Drove 9 hours to the Russian River Brew Pub and got lucky with only a 2 hour wait time on a Saturday to get in. Totally worth all the hype. So amazingly drinkable its scary. It almost hurts to say but I prefer it over Pliny The Elder. 272 charactersDonch, Feb 17, 2015

A: Pours deep golden orange amber with a frothy white head that settles and laces nicely. 
S: Tropical fruit and caramel malt sweetness followed by pine and citrus, especially grapefruit but some orange,  a little dankness, and a touch of alcohol.
T: Tropical fruit up front, mango and pineapple, followed by citrus, grapefruit that lingers answer a bit of tangerine,  a big hit of pine and little dankness, well backed with caramel malt sweetness, with a touch of alcohol.
M: Medium body with moderate carbonation that keeps it from getting syrupy thick like so many other big IPAs. Dangerously drinkable for 11%.
O: Outstanding beer, I have no regrets about waiting in line for 6 hours to try this legend. That being said, and though it may be sacrilege, I think I like the Elder a little bit more. The whole experience that comes with this beer is unbelievable. 896 charactersRyanK252, Feb 17, 2015
4.78/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally got the chance to try PtY after being shut out in Philadelphia last year. Relocated to denver this year and fortunately there are about 10 kegs shipped here yearly! Showed up at a bar around 3:45 PM, 60 guaranteed tickets were passed out at 4pm. I was one of the lucky recipients. Sipped on victory dirtwolf and Pliny the elder while we waited..
Firstly.. It was worth the wait. Poured into a 250mL chalice, with the pour easily exceeding the 250 mL mark.
Look: hard to believe, but very similar to PtE. A light orange color that is very translucent. Poured with about 1" foam that easily maintained its lacing until the final sip
Smell: had to wait a few sips to appreciate the smell in a chalice. Very citrusy, with the main fruit smell being Orange. Didn't detect any of the Pine odor commonly found in PtE. Very minimal, if any, alcohol despite being 10.25% this year. Capsule detect a sweet malt backbone. Incredible balance.
Taste: very similar to the smell. The only thing I would add is that this beer is drier than most DIPA's. This definitely keeps the taste stuck to your cheeks throughout enjoying this beer.
Feel: again, see taste. Drier mouthfeel. Very citrusy(mainly orange), some sweet malt backbone, minimal alcohol (if any), lacking any pine.
Overall: if you can get your hands on this.. Do NOT hesitate. I really enjoy PtE, but this is my preference. More of a full mouthfeel with a drier aftertaste. You don't get as many hop aromas, but the drink ability is unlike anything I've tried. Very, very hard to believe this comes in at 10.25%. Exceptionally well balanced. I was blown away.. Best of luck getting your hands on it!
Edit: Was able to get PtY 2 days later, this time in a 6oz Pour.  The only critique I would change is the "smell and taste" portion.  I read quite a few reviews.. You are able to smell and taste some very well balanced Pine in this beer.  I can't emphasize enough how well balanced this beer is, despite being 10.25% abv.  It's a testament to Vinnie's craft.. 2,020 charactersSonnyK85, Feb 17, 2015

I could bloviate about smell, taste, mouthfeel, etc... But instead I'll just be blunt:  this is a heavy, syrupy hop-bomb that is refreshingly clear and easy drinking.  It is nothing short of poetry in a bubble glass. 434 charactersWalshwi, Feb 16, 2015

Definitely a bit more of a kick than PtE, though not in the nose. Its a classic and deservedly so.

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Copper/orange in color, kind of a glowing hue to it, appearance is very similar to PtE, no head when the beer was brought to me but from what was there it looked as if it would have a really light, airy, fluffy, bubbly head to it, lacing left on the glass looks awesome, seems as if it is running down the glass instead of sticking, this beer is insanely clear, and there's just something about this beer when you look at it that a lot of time and detail went into this beer and that it will be amazing!
Aroma: Big pine, some dank hops, slight caramel from the malt, it's really hard to make out what citrus/tropical fruits are present because it is blended together so well, the citrus/tropical fruit presence is almost as present as the pine, some orange and grapefruit stand out just barely, you can smell some bitterness and can tell this will finish a little dry. The aroma of this beer will fill any surrounding area you are at instantly, once I was within 10 feet from the outside patio I could smell this beer. The strength and powerful presence of the aroma was incredible and the aroma this beer has is absolutely incredible!
T: Slammed with pine up front and then hit with a rush of dank citrus/tropical fruits that matches the aroma perfectly, in the middle you're hit with a pleasant mildly dry bitterness quickly followed with a perfect balance of pine and the citrus/tropical fruits as well as a perfect amount of the sweet caramel noticed from the nose, the amount of caramel present is just enough to balance the flavors perfectly, then finishes with a perfect dank citrus/tropical and pine combo and slight warmth from the 10.25% ABV as it goes down. This beer is so well balanced in every aspect, and every flavor that you can notice only compliments and enhances other flavors and nuances that you can notice. Great diversity of hops as well, smooth pine, dank, brash, citrus/tropical. They all blend so well together as well. It is almost unreal how this beer can be so out going, and yet so refined and balanced. This definitely ousts Heady Topper and King Sue for me and takes the No.1 for IPA's in my book!
M: This is probably the best aspect of this beer. The slight pine and dank citrus/tropical hop combo lingers for about 10 seconds and then finishes clean not even leaving a trace that you just drank it. It's light-medium bodied, crisp, and finishes just slightly dry leaving you a little thirsty for more. This beer is smooth and drinkable that without the little warmth from ABV you would never know this beer was 10.25% ABV. This will probably be the best finishing IPA I will ever have.
O: If you thought PtE was missing something or needed a little improvement, PtY will not only fulfill those gray areas, it will surpass PtE by miles. 2,787 charactersKnowYourCraft, Feb 15, 2015

L: once the condensation cleared, so did the IPA. 100% visibility, with thin but lingering ring, lightly clinging to the glass
S: I'm so surprised there is not a distinct smell to this iconic IIPA. If you blindfold me i would say this is Elder
T: They said "It gets better with age," but let me tell you there is a clear winner between Younger and Elder. Malt and hop ratio, uninterrupted.
F: That medium malt start the show, for the headline hops to bring the crowd (taste buds) to climax.

4.54/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A really really well made and balanced TIPA. The hype kind of ruined it for me. It was good, but there are many "triple" IPAs that you can get that are just as good or better. Simtra, Hoparillo, and RuinTen come to mind immediately. Younger might have been the first of its kind, but these days there's not much to separate it from the rest of the crowd. Like Elder, it showcases a similar piney/grapefruity character and honestly if I didn't know it was 10.25% I wouldn't have known. The sweet malts hint at the higher ABV but there is no booziness to it at all. I think I waited about 30 minutes to try it, and I'm glad I got to try it, but probably not worth it again. 671 charactersMisSigsFan, Feb 11, 2015

Younger had more pine/earth/spice flavors than Elder, and a bit less Simcoe tropical fruit flavor.  The kicker with this beer is really the smooth low body palate cleansing drinkability combined with over the top delicious hop flavors and ABV.  The only thing that keys you in to the ABV with this beer is a slight warming sensation about 5 seconds after each sip. 453 charactersfenixtx423, Feb 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Notes from my time at the bar with The Younger:
L: Pours a beautiful just slightly cloudy gold with 1/4" micro bubbly and fluffy head that settles to a small bubble ring around the glass. Sticky lace and huge legs linger all over the glass. 
S: Massive waves of intensely fresh hops and pine permeate the air around the glass, with some very slight tropical aroma coming through, as well as some subtle crackery/biscuity malt. 
T: Taste follows the aroma... cleansing and pristine pine-fresh hops, slight citrus and lemongrass with a strong bready malt base that hits at the back of the tongue. The balance is really nothing short of incredible. 
M: Crisp and dry, with no booze detectable whatsoever (at 11%!), perfectly highlights the flavor balance. 
Overall: A more realized and brighter version of Elder. PtY checks all boxes and then some. The benchmark imperial/triple IPA. 'Lupulin Threshold Shift' be damned. 922 charactersmig100, Nov 10, 2014
5/5  rDev +7.1%smell: like a brighter version of elder.  hops up front, giving way to more hops...residual sweetness.  
taste: booyah.  piny, earthy hops up front.  quick burst of citrus fruit in the middle, finish long and dry with a pleasant balanced bitterness. 249 charactersDudeBeerYaBro, Nov 07, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a perfect beer for IPA lovers. The Younger is to the Elder as the Elder is to Sierra Nevada. (I'm not saying Sierra Nevada is bad; RR is just in a different league.) The beer is perfectly carbonated with such a deep and complex flavor that it should by all rights be undrinkable, yet the mouth feel is so smooth and luxurious you'd think you were drinking a stout or something. 385 characterstom_ogasawara, Aug 08, 2014

A: perfect hazy orange color that only left a little bit of head by the time my glasses got to me
S: smells of citrus and a small amount of pine.. I would argue that this is the exact smell that any "IPA" should shoot for
T: same as the smell.. Citrus and a little pine.. Very smooth and well balanced
M: I would say medium.. Ideal mouthfeel for IPA
O: obviously 1 of the highest rated IPA's and after getting to try it very well deserved.. Was lucky enough to have a non-drinking buddy that lives in CA take me and get 6 instead of the mandated 3.. Also lucky that he was cool enough to run to another bar and grab us burgers while we were in line or I would have been in trouble.. Big shout out to the coolest guy I know.. Thanks again Z!! Probably won't do it again cuz the wait was unrealistic but if you haven't had it it is worth doing once.. Very well done Russian River 1,031 charactersBarrelAgedG, Jul 27, 2014

While a secretly hoped the my results would lean PiY I cam safely say heady is the superior brew. While PIY is amazing, it seems to be more of a hop bomb than heady. When compared side by side, heady to me seems to be a better planned beer. The only other drawback with PIY is the buttery feel others have reported here which I definitely experienced and found distraction. Either way two great experiences with heady taking a distinctive edge. 562 characters1fortypoint6, Jun 23, 2014

While this is a great beer, it is not worth the effort off waiting in long lines to try it. I actually prefer the elder more than the younger. I'm glad I tried it and obviously I recommend anyone who hasn't tried it to do so. But next year I'll stick with the elder. 380 charactersSaucedBoss, Jun 16, 2014

Tasting against Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger is crisp, somehow light?, and just delicious. It is amazing that it has so much alcohol. Compare too against the syruping, nearly chewy 120 minute Dogfish head IPA - Pliny the Younger is clear and good and just so, so drinkable. 422 charactersBenempt, Jun 10, 2014

I had read many reviews and often thought, "how the hell can any beer be as good as people rate this to be??!!" So, I decided to break Vinnie's rule and enjoy this beer at a local watering hole weeks after "it should have been enjoyed." Well, Vinnie, I can't imagine how this wonderful contribution to the beer world could get any better, even after sitting through a coast to coast joyride, over many wonderful brew towns in this great place of freedom to brew whatever the heck you want to!

4.54/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.56 ounce pour into short tulip glass, enjoyed during PtY tapping event at Side Bar in West Chester (shout out to my man, Brendan, the ever friendly bartender at this awesome establishment). PtY was not hazy, as I had anticipated, but rather clear. Slim collar and decent lacing, although both head and retention were likely compromised by nature of event (servings were pre-poured before I got to the bar rail). In any event, the nose was incredibly flamboyant/expressive, with sweet piney hops evident. In the palate, the experience was at first extremely hoppy, followed by a mango/papaya floral fruit note, and finally, a sticky piney/citrus burn.
Loved this, though it was hard to match the hype.
Had PtY again, a couple weeks later, at a surprise tapping hosted by Monk's Cafe which was announced via e-mail blast. I just happened to be in Philly that afternoon, having lunch 6 blocks away. Needless to say, I dropped my fork and SPRINTED to Monk's, where I was fortunate to enjoy two full pours before the keg kicked an hour later. Must say, it was better than I had remembered. Would now give it 4.75. Cheers! 1,117 charactersJohnParadee, Mar 19, 2014

Appearance: Golden color with a bigger than expected head (guy pouring out of keg was busy, so...)
Aroma: Face full of crazy fruit hops.
Taste: Clean, hoppy taste , fruit that is in the nose, pine, and the alcohol is well hidden. Very balanced.
Overall: Stood in line for 90 minutes in 42 degrees with a wind chill. Pretty much knew from the start that each person was getting one 7oz. glass. Was this beer good? Yes. Would I ever wait in line again for 7 ounces at $15.00? NOPE. IMO, this beer is very over-hyped, and that was the general consensus at the bar. Had two Elders afterwards, and was quite content with that. Glad I tried it, and I recommend people do the same, but prepare for lines and inflation. Cheers!! 775 charactersdahlen22, Mar 13, 2014

A- Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a small creamy white head that reduces to a small layer, leaving a touch of lace behind
S- citrus explosion with lots of grapefruit, orange peel, cantaloupe, guava and passionfruit. I could literally smell this from about three feet away
T- raw danky hops are front are so clean and showcased, to a degree that i've only experienced in a few DIPA's. A clean malty sweetness compliments perfecty, hemp and fresh clean mint close it out. The finish is very similar to Elder, only a bit hoppier 
M- medium body and mouthfeel leads to a creamy mouthfeel and a clean hoppy finish. Alcohol is hidden nearly perfectly
O- this one lived up to the hype for me, it has many characteristics as Pliny the Elder, just more hoppy goodness packed in. I had to stand in line for a long time to try this, but it was worth being able to say that I've sampled this legend. 969 charactersTreyliff, Mar 13, 2014

I'll just start off by stating that this is one of, if not, the most well-balanced, elegantly-crafted hoppy ale(s) I've come across. A true example of brewing art. That said, the taste is quite fine but perhaps a bit underwhelming for more seasoned hop heads.
The liquid is a fiery orange hue with a jewel-like glow, faint haze, and nearly pure white, sticky-cottony foam that stands for a bit before being overcome by lip oils and/or the alcohol level. Looks nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
The smell is somewhat, somehow restrained, but has one of the most well-defined, 3D aromatic representations of a handful of newly-dried hop cones in the palm of one's hand - dirty/earthy with a ghostly, subtle, spirit-lifting, mildly-mineral, tonic alcohol delivering it to the sinuses... mild orange-citrus undertones... once again, nice, but requiring a few healthy, deep inhales to take it in.
The flavor is ridiculously refined - it is easily seen that this is PtE, attenuated, flattened-out. Tastes about the same, just the depth and definition found in PtE is lacking in this. One would guess, however, that the alcohol would jump out a bit more in PtY and, yet, it doesn't at all. It's amazing how well-hidden it is, though a sense of quiet warmth rises by the last couple sips. Perception of bitterness is minimal, if at all a factor. Extremely well-balanced, but nearly brut-champagne-like in its dryness - the hops (flavor) and malt are too quiet.
Where this beer really captured my attention and imagination was in its absolutely feather-light body. It's as if the carbonation was the only thing that indicated to my senses that I had beer in my mouth. I wouldn't be surprised if this beer finishes at down close to 1.002-1.004. While I attempted to savor it at CTH, at Monk's (owing partly to the excellent special draft list) I powered through it in 3-4 sips. Sooo easy to drink. Dangerous. 2,001 charactersBouleboubier, Mar 12, 2014

I was very disappointed younger, all 5 of us agreed elder was a far superior brew. Younger is good, but not as good as the hype. 388 charactersbonkers, Mar 12, 2014

A - Golden pour with a clear look. Foam head settled fast (*these were poured rapidly for 100+ people). Slight lacing rides down the glass.
S - Strong scents of pine, some pineapple & mango tropical fruit smell, and hop resin that gives some lingering tobacco notes.
T - Rich flavors of tropical fruit at the front. There is an intense malt presence that keeps the high IBU's tempered. It is not a hop bomb at all.
M - This cannot be any better. Balance on a triple IPA can only be matches, not improved. The body of Younger feels rich on the palate. 
O - Now that this is ticked on the bucket list, I can say that PtY is a work of brewing art. Vinny made an inspirational beer that seems less impressive as more heavily hopped & well balanced beers are made. This is the original, and still iconic beer. 844 characterssocon67, Mar 11, 2014

S: not as hoppy as I expected; more malt and biscuit with sweet aromas and almost a tinge of smoked grain. The finish on the aroma is familiar american hop oil, with citrus notes.
T: A perfect balance of citrusy hops with strong malt backbone. This is not the hop-bomb that some beers are (like Boulder Hazed and Infused), but there is a much stronger malt balance to this that makes the beer level nicely. The hops are certainly there, without being overwhelmingly tropical, sweet, or citrusy. There is thickness to the flavor. There is complexity to the flavor. There be dragons here.
M: A perfect amount of carbonation that can be described as smooth without being flat, carbonated softly without being pillowy, and with bubbles that are crisp without biting. 
O: This beer lives up to its hype. I had two back to the back, and the second one was better than the first. Each was served in a different glass, and for whatever reason, the second was able to open up to the air more and provide a better flavor/ aroma base. Either way, this was an excellent beer that is as well-balanced and delicious as an IPA can get. Only Heady Topper is (arguably) better by a difference of the slightest degrees. You cannot tell that this beer is 11% ABV.

Appearance - Pours a crystal clear, pure golden hue, served up in a 10 oz glass with a white, half finger of head. Fair retention leads to a broken layer of suds across the surface with a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Moderate lacing that's spotty with good stick.
Smell - Dominant grapefruit pith along with a light pine resin. Clean, simple aroma.
Taste - Follows the nose. Grapefruit pith and citrus oils, with lesser notes of pine resin. 
Mouthfeel - Full body with moderate carbonation. Incredibly smooth with a crisp, clean finish.
Overall - Awesome beer, but hard to distinguish from the Elder. In fact, if you were to hand this to me and tell me it was PtE, I wouldn't give it a second thought. This one's got just a tad more body, but all the other sensory qualities are basically identical. Glad I was able to walk right up to the counter and order this; if I had to stand in line I would've been greatly disappointed. It's certainly not worth the hype and the hours of line waiting that happens every year. Just grab the Elder. I promise you they're nigh indistinguishable. 1,144 charactersTheSixthRing, Mar 02, 2014

much creamier head than I expected, and much more fuller and thicker, too! lots of pine, lots of sweet aroma; even the family said it smelled sweet from their prospective locations at the table! malty, bready, pine-y, sweet and bitter finish. not too much like The Elder, as others have said, but very good. in fact, not even close to Elder when considering the volume of different DIPAs and (T)IPAs out there and the amount of differing flavors of them (and the Blind Pig after, I thought, was much more stable and tastier!). nice lacing down the sides. 
overall, I finally tried it! I would drink it again, but without the lines and the raffle tickets. I would very much prefer to sit at the pub and line them all up- the Plinys, Blind Pig, the Row 2, etc.... and just taste them all altogether. and then, of course, come back the next day and do all the wild ales...! but saying that I would drink it again without the lines says so much, doesn't it? it's good, but not worth the lines. 1,225 characterspkalix, Mar 02, 2014

A: Looks like an IPA - pours a tight 1 finger white head with beautifully golden color and crisp clarity. 
S: I have no sense of smell - wife thoughts - very piney and tad citrus. Pine stood proud.
T: Big clean pine and citrus hops flavors & more resin than most IPAs. Tasted like an evergreen forest grew in my mouth with a few tropical fruit trees sneaking into the sunlit areas. Alcohol apparent but well balanced with hops. Impressed with how unique it tasted - something different than other big IPAs. As great as it was, did not feel I wanted more than (1) glass. Someone poured a Heady Topper and we preferred PtY. The clean taste and clarity felt like a fountain of youth. 
O: Worth the hype at least once. Everyone knows this is an epic beer and I am only posting this to feel cool about actually getting the opportunity. 883 charactersabrethanson, Mar 01, 2014

I was going into trying the beer with an expectation of it being good, and it did not disappoint. I was very surprised at how well the beer came together as more than just a better Pliny the Elder. It was more citrusy as opposed to piney, and it did not at all taste like 11% alcohol. I cannot give it anything other than perfect scores because there is nothing more I could possibly ask for in a beer. 486 charactersBenm1024, Feb 27, 2014

A- Golden, crisp. Minimal carbonation, more transparent than Elder. Thin lacing. 
S- Some grapefruit, citrus out of the nose. Minimal hops. This has more of a fruit character.
T- I think this is really well balanced. Elder tastes like it has more abv than younger. Younger has less of a presence. 
M- Pretty thin, some cream. Medium amount of carbonation follows. 
O- Massive hype on this one. You could have told me that this was some random Colorado IPA and I would have believed it. No out of body experience for me. I liked Elder on tap more. 630 charactersgueuzedreg, Feb 24, 2014

While I don't think any beer is worth waiting 5 hours for, this was on my "must try" list, and I wasn't too hungover to wake up at 6AM. Headed to the taphouse at 7:30am, in line at 7:45, and surprisingly, was not first. Nice little gathering, people drinking coffee, playing board games, and enjoying each others company waiting for the doors to open.
A - pours a lovely hue, somewhere between golden and amber. Other beers of similar stature have a better pour (i.e. Hopslam), but the color is not why I was there.
S - Holy Moly. If someone finds a way to harness the scent of this thing, please let me know. I would pay handsomely for it. Literally spent the first 2 or 3 minutes just smelling it. Everything you would expect from something in the IPA family (layer upon layer of hops, grapefruit), but jesus, was this a step in the right direction.
T - everything I was hoping for. So much going on in this pour, every sip makes your brain spin trying to wrap your head around the complexity. Piney, earthy, boozy. The one downside, the booze. I did not feel that the ABV was very well hidden. Still delicious, and I had 3 of them, but it was a TINY bit overpowering. 
M - beautiful
O - Look. If you can get some friends together, and the weather is nice, go ahead. Its worth it for the experience and frankly, the beer also. Is it really #2? Eh, probably not. I am glad I went, and would absolutely drink it again if it were available, but I probably will not be attending another release day. 1,569 charactersfatmusic14, Feb 24, 2014

The taste is very similar to pliny the elder with a lot more mouthfeel and even smoother which is odd but I'll take it! Had a great time waiting in line and drinking with the people I met in line.

A: Clear body. Light copper color with a little head. 
S: Loaded with hops, smells like Simcoe to me. Booze is noticeable. This is a huge beer.
T: Follows the nose. Huge hop bite without being too bitter. A little hot. PtE with just an absurd amount of hops. Incredibly drinkable all things considered. 
M: It's no PtE in this dept but decently carbonated and a little sticky.
O: I'm not a ticker, but I'm really glad I had the opportunity to try this. It's an excellent beer, but would never waste 3 hours of a day again to get it. I can think of several IIPAs that are better and also aren't impossible to get. 665 charactershoppytobehere, Feb 23, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Toronado (SF). This beer is awesome. I could dock random 1/4 points, but for the style, it doesn't get any better. This pours a medium orange color that is surprisingly see through. The smell is juicy citrus fruit with a light sweetness. The taste is lots of strong citrus fruit. It's bitter, but at the same time balanced by the sweetness from all the malt. There is virtually no alcohol presence, which is quite a feat for an 11% beer. This beer is incredibly drinkable and perfectly balanced. Far and away my favorite TIPA. 536 charactersmc4z, Feb 23, 2014
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've been about the hype for two years now...learning about the Younger releases last year and missing my opportunities. After striking out twice already this year, my opportunity came this morning (2/22/14). After the hours of driving, parking, waiting, holding in a coffee dump, waiting, making small talk, waiting, finding a quick spot for said coffee dump, waiting, taking pictures, waiting, and more waiting....my snifter was poured and the deliciousness was before me. 
It's an odd feeling, seeing 6 ounces in front of you and realizing that each ounce equated an hour of your life. It's an odd feeling, having what you've "dreamt" over, researched, and hyped over to be in front of you. What do you do first?
Smell: It smells like heaven, or what I hope "heaven" to smell like. To me, it's smell is the liquid brother of bacon smell. The aroma coming off this thing was amazing. Super piney with hints of citrus. 
Taste: I sipped too quickly. I don't know if it was the hours of waiting or the general anticipation of it all but I sipped before it had a chance to open up. The first taste, to me, wasn't worth the hype. It wasn't until five-ten minutes went by that I realized just how delicious this beer tasted. The longer I waited, the better it became. The Younger went down so easily, especially for it's 11 ABV. 
Overall: Worth it. The combination of how delicious it was, coupled with the camaraderie one creates with other beer nerds makes for a wonderful experience. I'm glad this isn't an everyday beer for it gives us something to yearn for throughout the year. 
Long story short, enjoy the process and let it breathe. 1,641 charactersUAhobbes, Feb 22, 2014

4.66/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Stem glass poured from tap at tap room San Diego's 7th anniversary party. 
Pours golden with about 3/4 inch head, ideal appearance for an IPA.
The aroma for some reason is a little hard to find. Very clean, but honestly not too strong. What I am finding is typical of the style. Piney with a hint of citrus.
Taste is where this beer really lives up to the hype. I can't imagine an IPA tasting a whole lot better than this. Remarkably clean for an 11 ABV. This beer goes down dangerously easy. So mellow for a beer that is so aggressively hopped. 
Very light and airy but strikes the taste buds at the same time.
Overall, probably the best IPA I've ever had. A little bit better than a hopslam or an enjoy by, but not by a whole lot. Don't know if it's worth the hype, but then again, hype grows exponentially. Definitely worth seeking out if you can find it, but I wouldn't wait 8 hours at the brewery for it like some of the stories I've heard. All in all, an amazing beer, the gold standard for the style. 1,012 charactersbeersgud, Feb 22, 2014

The color was a great, golden ale color. I was expecting a little darker, but you can't smell or taste color, so no worries. No head, no lacing.
I didn't get much on the nose surprisingly. some tropical notes for sure. Some hop oil.
Taste was great. The booze was minute in it. the hops didn't linger at all. very smooth and enjoyable. tropical hop extract perhaps?
mouth feel was very creamy and stuck to the side of your mouth, I liked that.
was happy I lucked into getting this beer to cross off my bucket list. Would have it again if available, but not wait for a long time in line for it. The experience drinking it with other people waiting for it was actually pretty neat, as we all had the same goal. 779 charactersrhartogsq, Feb 20, 2014

What an experience. A true world class beer full of hops, pine, and citrus on the nose and tongue. Wonderful mouthfeel and a lovely light orange hue.

Great IPA appearance and fragrance. What sets this IIIPA apart from others is the fact that it's 10.25% and still drinks as smoothly as a pale ale. Goes down really well. Didn't give a perfect rating because the body is a little light. This brew feels and almost drinks just like the Elder, but packs more of a punch. Was it worth waiting in line for?

Minimal head, wonderful appearance. The color was magnificent. Definitely got me excited.
Smell was great. Somewhat similar to the Elder. Definitely good.
Taste was awesome. First few sips, i swooshed it around in my mouth. Really good stuff. Very crisp and drinkable for a "triple IPA". 
Mouthfeel was like a normal APA, not a big hop bomb. Very crisp.
Overall I really enjoyed this beer and am very glad that I got to try it. I hit RR in Santa Rosa on Sunday night around 9 PM hoping I could sneak in and get a glass before the end of the day allotment but I missed out by 10 minutes. As much as I enjoyed this beer, I am very glad that I didnt wait 6 hours in line like alot of people. 
If you can get this beer without too much hassle, go for it. It is great but not worth the madness. I suppose nothing really is... 900 charactersDennyCrane, Feb 19, 2014

I am not a fan of IPAs by any means, but felt I had to try PtY at least once in my life. I really was hoping the 2.5 hour wait would be worth it.
Well, suffice to say....it was. For a triple IPA I was surprised how good it was. The experience was very nice, from the smooth hops flavor (was expecting a Lagunitas IPA-like assault), crispness, citrus notes, and high alcohol content that went down super easy (as did the second one). While still not a IPA fan, PtY most definitely lives up to the hype and worth your time. 
If you have a beer bucket list, I'd say this needs to be on it, and crossed off!

At Russian River Brewery
Three 10 oz pours
10.25%
A: Clear golden orange, slim to no head, constant bubbling from bottom of glass. 
S: Smells like expected, very nice! Pine, citrus, hops dominate. 
T: Great! Piney citrus and lots of hops. Pine resin, can taste the alcohol but its hidden well. Slightly less bitter than previous years. Nice aftertaste. Perfect pair with jalapeños. 
M: Medium to heavy body. Almost creamy. Resinous and syrupy. Nice. It's a big beer. 
O: Excellent. A more syrupy, resinous Pliny the Elder. This beer is hyped like mad, worth it if you get the chance. 
Perfect pair with Pliny bites!
Got to the brewery in Santa Rosa at 9:40am on Friday, Valentine's Day. I waited in line for two hours, then recognized someone up front when I went to pee. Otherwise would have waited five hours. Wouldn't have been worth it if I didn't see them. Solid afternoon with top notch beer, making new friends. 936 characters, Feb 17, 2014

PTY was a rather surprising taste for me, I found it to have a subtle alcohol effect with a sweet taste overall. Texture was creamy, reminded me of a Cream Ale soda (texture only). No real head to each pour, its beer in the glass top-to-bottom. 
This is a good beer but if I had to stand in line as others have done, and continue to do, this is not the beer I would wait for.

4.57/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Bobby G's Pizzeria in Berkeley, CA.
A: Pours a crystal clear golden orange with little to no bubbly white head and a fine, thin, white ring of head around the glass. Continuous bubbling is visible from the base of the glass.
S: Super sweet and syrupy. Resinous hop character of pine, earth dankness, grapefruit, peach, and stone fruit. Tons of malt sweetness. Lots going on in this beer.
T/M: Really full medium mouthfeel with carbonation that feels low, but only because of how syrupy and resinous the beer tastes. Completely smooth with tons of hop resin coating the mouth. Prickly carbonation up front with a surprisingly subtle hop bitterness that isn't really harsh at all gives way to super resinous hop character, primarily citrus. Tons of malt sweetness provide waves of juicy stone fruit and candy. Finish is smooth, juicy, coating, and moderately bitter. Alcohol is well hidden.
O: This is a really excellent beer. It's hardly worth the trouble to get to enjoy it, but it's really quite nice. The abundance of flavor is almost too much, though; it's so thick and flavorful that after even a few ounces I feel pretty satisfied. I probably wouldn't drink this daily given the chance, but am glad I've gotten to enjoy it a couple times and would definitely do it again if it wasn't so much of a pain to get. 1,328 charactersjdhowe, Feb 15, 2014

Pours clear pale golden color with little to no head to speak of. Aroma is pretty much spot on with the Elder, super balanced, super hoppy, with notes of pine and citrus. Taste is like taking a fistful of fresh whole cone hops and shoving them in your mouth. Huge vegetal, piney, slight citrus, but mostly just a ton of hop oil that coats the mouth and pretty much destroys the palate. Younger really shines on the mouthfeel. Smooth, silky, with absolutely no boozyness to speak of. Practically unheard of! Am I glad I stood in line for 30 min at Toronado? Yes. Is it the best triple IPA I've had? No. I would probably prefer having the Elder over the Younger on a regular basis but wow what a great triple IPA. 731 charactersspark3148857, Feb 13, 2014

Drinking side by side with pliny the elder at russian river brewery. So review will be stilted by the direct comparison.
A - both are beautiful clear amber beers. The elder is still bubbling away but younger is not. 4.75
S - Same piney notes on both, but younger has the more complex citrusy fruit. 4.75
T - younger has the more complex and pleasant taste. More citrus fruit on top of the piney taste. 5
M - even though elder has the more carbonation the younger mouthfeel is better to me. Younger has the best mouthfeel of any ipa I've had, so it'd be a 5 in its class but doesn't compare as well to smooth silky stouts like bcbcs, etc. 4.5
O - slightly better than elder. So... Yeah fantastic. 5 747 charactersWolberjs, Feb 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served from a tap in San Francisco during the launch week. Pours just like any other IPA of it's style; Crisp, golden and clear. A sniff brings about a lot of similar notes as Pliny the Elder, but I get a lot less pine and more of that malty sweetness on the head, especially as the beer warms. Citrus, a subtle grapefruit and some bitters all present. The taste, like the Elder, stay true to it's smell, and the abundant hop character comes right out at the front, with a consistent, malty undertone that slowly takes the focus as it goes down, leaving a very palatable taste in your mouth. This beer hides its alcohol just as good as any I've had. It really gets lost in the sweetness from the malt, and I wouldn't have pegged it as a &gt;10% beer if I wasn't already aware that it was. The style of hops that are used really compliment the malt well, so there isn't a flavor that dominates the taste of this beer. It's smooth and the tiniest bit more creamy than a usual IPA. This beer really has the same taste as the Elder, but with a sweeter backing to balance well with the additional hops. Not as malty as a 120-minute, but not an overloaded hop-bomb either. You can tell it has been meticulously balanced.
In the end, this beer is really just an IPA. There no special ingredient or process that goes into it's production. It hasn't been fused with anything extra or aged in special barrels for extended periods of time. It's just an IPA, and that's all it will taste like. That being said though, after sipping on it for awhile, it's hard not to appreciate how drinkable it is for a triple. If anything, the alcoholic will sneak up on you before you want to stop drinking this beer. On one hand, it's hard to give all 5's to any beer, but on the other, give Vinnie credit where credit is due for cramming such a large hop bill into as remarkably well-balanced and drinkable a beer as any. 5/5. 1,903 charactersZaso, Feb 13, 2014

O: This beer hit a ceiling for me (I generally don't like IPAs as much as I like stouts, so I score them lower) that a few others (namely Blind Pig, Double Jack and Enjoy By) have hit. If I liked hoppy beers like I do bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts, I would probably give this a 100. To my taste, I'd give it a 95 or 96.
Note: Tasted four days after release. Go on a week day if possible. I only had a 20 minute wait. 650 charactersBierJager89, Jan 05, 2014

The smell is amazing, a straight hop bomb.
Appearance is like pliny
Both taste and mouthfeel are amazing, not at all bitter.
Can't wait until next year when I try this again! 311 charactersDe_Nada_Brewing, Dec 09, 2013

I didnt think the Elder could be duplicated, but this beer is a refined elder. The bitterness is perfect in this beer. Unfortunately unless you live by the brewery its pretty hard to get more than a pint or two in February. This beer should be tasted by all. 376 charactersDarth_Ryan, Nov 14, 2013

For those that say it is not worth the hype, I disagree, it is the best of Triple IPAs and as such belongs at the top!
Pliny the Younger was born in Novum Comum (Como, Northern Italy), the son of Lucius Caecilius Cilo, born there, and wife Plinia Marcella, a sister of Pliny the Elder. It is assumed Pliny was writing about him being the first to write about hops. This is debatable as his "lupus salictarium" Willow Wolf, may or may not have been the hop plant. This description makes reference on how the mentioned plant can drag down a tree by it's weight, similar as to a pack of wolves dragging down a large elk, by the weight of t's numbers, a pack of wolves drag down the larger beast, so does this plant by growing up its sides and over time, dropping said tree or plant.
This beer is hop goodness and the smell is devine hop goodness with a bitter brite grapefruit and uber happiness that should be contemplative over time rather volume. 1,035 charactersxmorgan, Nov 11, 2013

Pours an amber color with very little head. 
Lots of pine in the smell, grapefruit and citrus also present. 
Taste is sweet, mellow, a bit chalky. Pine and grapefruit are present, as well as pineapple and mango. Everything about IPA’s rolled in to one. Very smooth, very drinkable. Only the tiniest bit of alcohol present. 
An incredible beer, and right up there as the best IPA I’ve ever had. Is it worth the hype? No, not really. Is it a great beer? Yes, absolutely. Should someone seek it out? If you haven’t had it before, and you have the chance to, yes. 592 charactersSmurf2055, Jul 15, 2013

Not many beers I would wait 3 hours for...and only waited that long because my beer drinking buddy was adamant that this is the best beer ever created in the history of mankind. Usually when someone tells you something is the best you end up disappointed...not this time.
Great beer, you can tell it has high content but it is still very easy to drink with a great high hop flavor.

That was the highlights though, the Younger is good but I wouldnt wait for it alone especially at 6$ for 4oz's. 
It has a lot of complexity and doesnt have that west cost IBU BOOM but it just wasnt for me. At the bar we went to this last year they had plenty of other IPA's I enjoyed more, some of which were very rare in California, like Sculpin Habenaro IPA and Dogfish 120minute on TAP! If it were something readily available like the Elder I could see myself buying it every now and then but I probably wont be waiting in the long lines for a taster any more. 
I'd say, its definitely worth a try and find a pub that has an event for the tapping. I wouldnt rank it in the top 25 though. 831 charactersIHeartE30s, Jun 02, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this beer about a dozen times in February and twice in March. I write this review now from notes I had written on my notepad app in my phone. I think this review deserves the complete journey I took from La Habra to Santa Rosa on a chilly evening in February. I drove seven and a half hours to get to Russian River and arrived a bit past 10:30pm. My girlfriend and I ordered a couple glasses of Pliny the Younger. What I saw was a small glass with a clear, obviously filtered, golden beer and a nice head. The aroma was enticing to me, not so much my girlfriend. "It smells like pine cones!" She was not a beer enthusiast like me but I agreed with her- "It also smells like citrus and in very good balance. Not one more than the other." So we drank. Poof! Like a memory it was there and it was gone- it vanished, it evaporated. It was so easy to drink I had to keep the second gulp in my mouth, swish it around and chew it a bit to get the complete experience. I was dumbfounded. "Isn't this supposed to be nearly 12%?" I asked my girlfriend. By this time she was done and ordered another. This was a woman that barely got the hang of Leinenkugel not two months before. As I watched her drink it, swish it around and chew a few times (like I told her to) she would close her eyes and "Mmmm! This is SO good." This was probably the fifth or sixth kind of beer she has ever tried. The aggressive amounts of ABV with the intense aroma and smooth flavor and the subtlety by which the flavors develop in your mouth which is such a rich dynamic from a hop punch in front to a sweet tang of citrus to the back which completely masks the amount of alcohol in addition to being filtered- this beer is quite frankly dangerously delicious and I can't wait for my next journey in February! 1,783 characterstastyville, May 07, 2013

A - Rich orange-gold with minimal head. 
S - Strong pine but citrus comes through as well.
T - It's an elevated version of PtE. There is a stronger citrus flavor that is able to hide the higher alcohol content. The overall balance is incredible.
M - Amazing smoothness that makes it so easy to drink.
O - This is my favorite beer so I am biased when I say that this is deserving of the hype. I probably wasted way too much time tracking this in February/March, but I imagine I will be doing the same thing next year. 656 charactersakang, May 03, 2013

Best IPA in every regard. 
Pours with practically no head and is a perfectly clear, bright orange-gold color.
Balance is the key with this beer, nothing overpowers and the high abv is hidden very well - all the traditional west coast IPA notes with the citrus, pine, sweetness...just everything is bigger and yet so well balanced. Not enough can be said about just how good this beer is, I set this as my standard to compare all IPA/DIPA's against. 499 charactersLSx, Apr 24, 2013

I am a huge hophead, so this was a nice treat for me. Had this yesterday on tap at Varga bar in Philly for the black tie event. I managed to grab two 6 oz pours so I got a pretty good idea of this beer.
A: Almost clear orange/gold color with ample bubbles rising up to a ring of white head, pretty nice lacing. 
S: Not the most pungent smelling triple IPA ever, but what is there is all resiny tropical and pine hops, weed, bitters, a crisp and clean aroma overall.
T/M: Really nice composed flavor, this is supremely balanced for a beer of this ABV. Floral and vegetal hops, tropical fruits abound with pineapple and papaya fruits for me shining through. This is very clearly the next step of elder as it has a nice dry finish, resiny front, and clean mouthfeel and the same sort of hop bill, but just more. Some honey soaked malts and a slight spicy note pervades as well- this accents the hops very well and contributes nicely to the feel overall. The taste lingers very nicely long after tasting it, which is always the mark of a great beer.
Overall, this is a great beer, and it is worth most of the hype. Did it blow me away? No. Is it still awesome? Yes. Would I drive to Philly from DC to and from in one day for it again? No. What I learned from trying this beer, is I need to take my hat off to it in that we wouldn't have beers like Boneyard Notorious, Alpine Expo Hoppiness, HF Ephraim, or even my local DC Brau OTWOA if it wasn't for this beer and it's "Elder" version. This beer seems like it would have blown the doors off the barn if I had it like 4-5 years ago, but now there are many comparable beers which maybe makes it seem less magical than it might have been before. As a saxophone player, it seems to me almost like having to appreciate Lester Young and Charlie Parker so that you can really enjoy Michael Brecker and Chris Potter etc meaning that you have to pay your dues to the ones who innovated first so you can see where the 'newer' things have grown out of. I tip my hat to Russian River and this beer for blazing the trail to the yet even crazier beers we have today. 2,198 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 26, 2013

And for the first time trying it, it was no less then amazing. 
Golden, deep orange and minimum head, almost completely flat.
From the moment I had my first glass without putting my nose to it the smell found me, amazing sweetness deceptively covering the amount of hops it contains. 
Mouthfeel was medium body, creamy silk, light oil consistency that made it one easy beer to drink and make u forget its actually 11% 
Overall worth the wait and having a beer like this makes me appreciate perfectly crafted beer and has me searching for anything that can tap into the heels of this amazing brew, at least untill next year. 800 charactersTurst3Since1987, Mar 23, 2013

A - golden crystal clear yellow with almost zero head. There is no head retention because of all the hop oil. Great alcohol legs.
S - the smell knocked me off my feet. So piney and hoppy. I could smell the beer from the table. Almost didn't want to drink it because it smelt that good.
T - perfectly balanced and smooth. Classic RR IPA with the piney, citrus flavored but just the right amount of malt backbone. Some warming but no burn. 
O - if this beer was more widely available it would be easily the best beer around. Lives up to the hype and has inspired me to finally make the trek to RR next year for the PtY release. 678 charactersGetMeAnIPA, Mar 21, 2013

The beer was lighter in color than I would have expected, but it had a beautiful white frothy head. The aroma was thick. Big hop notes of citrus with hints of tropical fruit, sitting over a big malt base that seems to thrust the hops into your nostrils. The hops and malt seem wonderfully cohesive and you can already tell this is going to be a juggernaut of a beer. The taste is equally satisfying. Thick malt and resinous hops roll across the tongue while a wonderfully complex hop profile opens us with orange, lemon and grapefriut flavors, some deeper notes of tabacco and chalk and the occasional swirl of malts keep this long, complex and drinkable. Wonderfully balanced and surprisingly easy to throw down. For those looking for a grapefruit fix, something like Maharaja might be better, but thsi has got to be one of the most well crafted and tastiest beers out there. 977 charactersjmaharaj, Mar 14, 2013

Smooth, bold flavors, and a refreshing, crisp finish.

It's pretty much the perfect brew. I highly recommend. 416 characterstomakeanend, Mar 13, 2013

Poured into a 4oz sampler glass (had two thanks to my wife who doesn't drink beer) - Poured beautiful clear golden with an one-finger super white head with beautiful lacing that lasted very well throughout. The intense aroma was full of citrus and floral hops along with pine. PtY had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other. The taste sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. This was by far better than Pliny the Elder - by a mile. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice citrus and resiny note on the end as well. Mouthfeel had a perfect balance with lively carbonation lasting throughout the (obviously very short) drinking session. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts and hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness like I thought it would have due to the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, so this was a pleasant surprise! This beer was perfectly balanced all-around. It is truly such a shame that this beer is "very expensive and difficult to make under tight space limits" according to Russian River because this would have been the go-to IPA in many beer circles. Would love to try this again in the near future! 1,431 charactersCuriousMonk, Mar 13, 2013

Glass poured ahead of time. Pale brass yellow to bronze amber body. Very clear and crystal, not much noticeable carbonation. Given with only a thin off tan to white soapy collar that never lets up. Very pretty looking IPA, with some matching spider like lacing.
Nose is familiar. A great wet sense of juicy hop orange and tangerine. There's a honey sweetness behind this also, it really reminds me of hopslam, and a very dry heat that come off of it. Not boozy smelling at all. Clean, but doesn't give me the sense of a big body coming.
Palate hits hop front hard. Big juicy but still wet body, not unlike Zombie Dust, but with a quenching almost pilsner crispness. Hop explosive notes of hinted orange from the nose, but the body is far more tropical with giant fruits of mango, maybe peach, but giant fruit punch tropics. Incredibily dry finish, almost getting into brut champagne territory, with pine hop complimenting the arid quality nicely. There is just a touch though, a peck of grainy character on this in the swallow.
It's very memorable, and hardly contains any alcohol boozy heat. I completely forgot this just barely kicks in over ten percent abv, it sure doesn't feel like it at all. It personally for myself is just missing that hint of bigger body, and oomph, and a certain "wow" factor. It's so close but it's a great beer. I'll never forget it. 1,534 characterssmakawhat, Mar 11, 2013

A- Pliny the Younger pour a glowing deep yellow with practically no head at all, which is okay for me. 
S- As I take a big whiff I smell loads of pine all the way. There's also a big burst of citrus as well, just as I expected. 
T- Crazy amount of hop bitterness to start. More piny notes continue to come through with lots and lots of grapefruit citrus notes as well. 
M- It's actually a bit light bodied than I expected. Very medium bodied with a bit of tingly carbonation. It leaves a very interesting alcohol coating as I swallow. A bit hard to describe but still incredible. 
O- Very glad I got to try this. Absolutely incredible! Very complex, super hoppy and all around goodness. I don't think it's overrated, I don't think it's underrated. I think it's spot on!

A: Melted gold coloration. Very thin head. Translucent. Clear demarcation of the legs on the glass.
N: I can smell this while holding it at chest level. Intense pineapple notes, mango, passionfruit, and a smattering of grapefruit. Caramel sweetness. Very worthy nose.
T: Massive interplay between sweet and bitter. Grapefruit gives way to some onion that is eventually defeated by earth, pine, conifer, and ash. Bitterness is a 10 on a 10 scale. This is the hoppiest beast on the market. Has the caramel of a good bourbon and some honey melon.
M: Dry and desiccating as a desert. Very sticky and washes around in the mouth. Sublime.
O: A beer like this is worth the effort of the chase if you haven't had it. Clearly, this is true. Yet, as I drank the 8oz, the desire for another one diminished with each sip. I've had it 5 times now, and I don't see much reason to continue tracking it down year after year. 954 charactersSarlacc83, Mar 06, 2013

Good ol' Pliny the Younger. This is my 3rd time with this beer. This came out to me with a half inch white cap of crisp white head on top of a golden amber body that had great clarity which showed off the lazy carbonation. The head eventually faded to nothing, but left a sticky lacing on the side of the glass. 
The smell wafts out of the glass with hints of mango, bruised pineapple, butterscotch, and a sweet hint of berries underneath. Fairly strong aroma, and certainly appetizing, though it fades a bit too quickly for me to rate this higher.
Very hop-forward beer for sure, with plenty of tropical fruit in the flavor and a sweet, boozy quality that is present throughout. While a beer like Heady Topper is a master of disguise, hiding all that alcohol behind the Hop Curtain, Pliny the Younger is unabashed by being an 11% alcohol by volume DIPA. The complexity here is the mix of hops and alcohol, with a nice sweet malt backbone.
The carbonation is crisp, the body is strong, a little on the viscous side. Superb mouthfeel...
I think this is a great beer. It would be hard to write about Pliny the Younger without talking about the train of hype that precedes this beer: people freak out about this beer. A bar announces this beer bring tapped, and if they don't announce it, its considered a "strategy." The hype is not worth it though. There are better double IPA's out there...that said, this is a great beer that people won't be disappointed in. I tracked this beer down this year to give it a review, but next year, I won't be on the hunt. 1,584 charactersMusicaleMike, Mar 06, 2013

It has a beautiful translucent golden color and goes down extremely smoothly. 290 charactersMitchD14, Mar 06, 2013

A: Pours golden color with great clarity. 1 finger white fluffy head. 
S: Mango, pineapple grapefruit, sweetness lingering with hops. 
T: Hop forward, very sweet citrus fruit. Hides the alcohol well behind a well balanced malt backbone. 
M: Well carbonated medium bodied with a bitter dry sweet finish. 
O: A good beer that is no where close to the hype. I waited about an hour for this beer which is on the low end, and honestly I would much rather have a TIPA from Knee Deep over this one. Glad to have it once and say I've had it but for this to top in the top 10 beers is all hype based IMO. 683 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Mar 05, 2013

A - Beautiful. Small white head with colors of orange but not as dark as I thought it might appear. 
S - this beer smells absolutely wonderful. Hops and citrus abound. As it warms up the aroma is even better. 
T - so smooth! Actually a little too smooth at 11%. But the flavor is a little disappointing for such a high ipa. No bitter bite at all. As this warms up the taste increases as did the smell. 
O - I think this beer might fall a little short of the hype. Don't get me wrong I did love this beer. But I actually preferred Citra from a bottle then pty on draft. I would seek this out again and recommend it to any ipa lover. But you won't see me waiting 3 hours in line to drink it. Pte is as good and usually easier to find. 796 charactersbaybum, Mar 05, 2013

A: Golden orange with little head.

M: so very smooth. The finish is a bit dry and sticky. No harshness like with some 11% abv.

A- Golden, almost orange. not a lot of head.
S- Piney, strong citrus, and slight alcohol
T- Great Malt bill for the hops, i found the hops to be a bit astringent. A really unique flavor, I guess thats why its so popular, I have never had a beer that tasted like it. It was different, but I cant say I loved the flavor. A little Resinous.
M- a little syrupy, chewy. I tried to love it. tried to see what it was all about. found the mouthfeel average for a IIPA

Nice white head delivered upon the pour. Crystal clear gold color. Amazing considering how much hops go into it. Smells of dank hop resin. Attractive lemon rind & notes of melon, mango, orange zest, and some vanilla. Tastes amazing. All the hop characters in the nose in the flavor. Nice firm bitterness. Not pungent or astringent. Dangerously drinkable. Alcohol doesn't seem noticeable except I can tell it's there since I haven't eaten lunch yet. (This is my lunch.). Dry tasting. I love this beer. So glad I decided to come out for it. Only reason I didn't score this a perfect score is due to the extremely limited availability.

M: Thick and oily, but so very nice. Just feels ... right

S: pine, citrus, alcohol, and malt sweetness; this doesn't all mix well. 
T: more of that odd mixture. The taste of all of these ingredients should be good, and is, but the mixture doesn't come together well enough to be the best DIPA out there. 
M: thick even for the style, with decent but somewhat lacking carbonation. 
O: misses the mark, though still excellent. I wonder if other batches or having this fresher would have made a difference (it's a month after the release and it just showed up in Philly). Reminds me of a Heady Topper, but doesn't strike the balance right. It's not dry enough, but at the same time there's too much alcohol. This beer just tried to be too big. For all of the negative things here, it's still on par with deliciousness like Simtra, but it's a step below Heady, and probably not as good as the Elder. 898 charactersHolland, Mar 03, 2013

A: Clear and golden, beautiful
S: Powerful citrus and pine
T: Enormous and pure blast of hops explodes at the first sip, more citrus, pine and tropical fruit. No burn, just the right amount of bitterness.There is no lingering of unwanted bitterness or malt that you would find in most other IPAs of this strength, this is like a perfectly painted portrait of hops. 
M: Cloud like, in that once you swallow its almost like the liquid was never in your mouth in the first place. The flavor makes a tremendous impact but the beer is so ridiculously light and drinkable.
O: Best IPA out there? Maybe. It was my favorite back to back with blind pig, the elder, rpm, hop venom, notorious (barely) and sucks. It takes a lot to stand out in that crowd. Hype = justified. 788 charactersanteater, Mar 02, 2013

A-This brew looks like a IIPA, i.e., very little head and a clear brew with a orange-tinted, slightly off-pale coloring. 
S-The smell is intense and complex. I detect citrus flavors ranging from grapefruit to orange to lemon. I also detect a honey and pepper. This brew is on the fruit forward end of things, but there is still a light whiff of dank pine and sage.
T-The taste is not a complete fruit bomb like the smell. I still get grapefruit and other citrus as dominant, but there is more chalky, earthy, oily, dank flavor from the hops that moves on the stage here. I also pick up a hint of caramel malt, which makes for a nice balance. The concentration of flavor and balance of hop and malt are impressive. 
M-The feel is mildly slick and oily. The carbonation is low and the weight is medium bodied.
O-It is hard for a brew like this to live up to the hype, and I'm not sure it did, but this is a damn good beer. The impressive thing here is the balance of malt and hops (and ABV, which is nearly imperceptible) combined with such an intensely strong flavor. Other brews that strive for intensity come of as overly bitter or one-trick ponies, but this brew does a great job of drinking well at 11.0% while maintaining full flavor force. 1,301 charactersspoony, Mar 01, 2013

But I HAD to try the Younger, so we decided on a whim to drive from Sacramento to Santa Rosa on day 2 of the Younger's release. We got in line at 4:45, and were finally drinking the Younger around 9:45. They were out by 10:30. Apparently, some had waited seven or eight hours before us. Three weeks later, I managed to try it again in Sacramento at the Pour House. We got there forty minutes early and it sold out in twenty minutes.
The beer had a thin white head, with an instantly noticeable big splash of hop aromas, mostly intensely sweet but with some obvious pine as well. Medium carbonation, not intense or biting but not at all flat. The most obviously different part about the experience was how the flavor stays in your mouth for a couple of minutes after you have a sip. Incredibly sweet and pure like fruit in the middle of summertime. There's not really any bitterness, but hoppy, alpine-flavored dryness complements the sweet hop flavors perfectly. You can pick out the sweet and the piney notes individually. It really coats your mouth. No alcohol taste, but my stomach quickly warmed up. There's also a nice malty background that adds to the experience. When I had it again three weeks later, the only difference was that there was a much larger head that was very light, like foamy cotton candy. Best beer ever? I don't know, but it was definitely the best beer I've ever had, by a long shot. 1,523 charactersfalc0n2600, Feb 26, 2013

4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Serving Type: On-tap at Breakwater Brewery poured into a half pint glass.
Appearance: Golden amber in color with a pure white head and great lacing. The head was minimal but this could have been due to the fact that they had pre-poured a number of glasses in order to move the line as quickly as possible. Amazing lacing.
Smell: My first impression was that it was not as aromatic as I was expecting for a "Triple IPA." After really delving into the smell though, I was immediately impressed by the balance between citrus, fruit, and pine backed up by a pale malt scent. Usually, I find that one hop aroma dominates the nose but this beer was beautifully balanced in a way rarely seen.
Taste: As the first sip hit my mouth, it was as if a flavor bomb went off, immediately coating every surface it came into contact with. The balance of the smell transitioned beautifully into the taste as notes of citrus, fruit, pine, and earth (which I did not notice in the aroma). The hops were also in perfect balance with the malt sweetness and it finished with the cleanest, strongest bitter I have ever experienced.
Mouthfeel: Perfectly done. Medium body. Semi-sweet. Nice carbonation. No room for improvement.
Overall: This was just a fantastic experience overall. Although Breakwater Brewery was packed for a Thursday afternoon, there was no five hour wait. I only arrived an hour early and was able to scope out a spot to get one of the first pours. The beer was amazing and I hope to be lucky enough to enjoy it again next year. 1,529 charactersTaySuth, Feb 22, 2013

Pliny the Younger has been on my radar for a long time and finally got a chance to get a taste this past weekend at Harrys Hofbrau. It did NOT disappoint. From the second I got the beer in my hand(4oz pour) I swirled it around in my glass for what seemed like 10 minutes smelling the hell out of it. I wanted to stick it up my nose and breathe it in forever...It was refreshing. Its definitely got a huge scent and taste of grape fruit. Super smooth, much more than the Elder but amazing.

The major difference is the bite at the end and the mouthfeel. When you drink Pliny the Elder you get alot of hopps and pine from the front to the back of your mouth and when you drink the Younger you get a crisp strong pine with a hoppy flavor in the back of your mouth. With that being said, I don't think you would notice the difference if you were pounding and had them on separate occasions. 
Appearance-Clear golden orange with a thin white head, darker than most IPA's. 
Smell-Pinny hoppy scent, far from skunky but will give your nose a little pinch. 
Taste-Like the scent the overpowering flavors are pine and hopps. This beer is extremely powerful but the the delicious flavors and crisp make it hard not enjoy. 
Mouthfeel-Crisp and smooth the flavors dwell in the back your mouth, no bite at the tip of your tongue. 
Overall I feel this is the top IPA followed by Heady Topper and Stones 12.21.12 Enjoy By.it's a heavy hitter when it comes to flavor and is perfectly balanced. 1,071 charactersSpectre, Feb 20, 2013

This was a real treat to sit down and take my first sip after traveling from NH for this and SF beer week, etc. The weather, setting (love RR brewpub), and atmosphere were perfect. Having tried all of the top IPAs/DIPAS except this one, I had to confront the Younger.
I wasn't expecting to be blown away by this beer as I typically prefer DIPAs (TIPA) in the 8% abv range. I'm not a huge fan of Hopslam and other 10%+ DIPAs. This was better than I expected. I was quite impressed by the tropical fruit in the nose and taste for such a big beer. The booze is well hidden and the drinkability is off the charts (had 9 glasses over the week). Tropical fruit, pine, some booze, nice malt backing without being over the top. Delicious.
While this was not the best DIPA/TIPA I've ever had, and the setting and experience probably bumped it up a notch, it was an excellent beer. My expectations were exceeded. I do think this is a beer that is best enjoyed as close to release/fresh as possible (all hoppy beers are of course, but perhaps some more than others) as I noticed a bit of decline/change in aroma/taste by my last glass a week after the first (probably palate fatique?). I hope to return next year. 1,264 charactersphingdong, Feb 19, 2013

A - Purely clear, bright golden coloring. Very little head or remnants of foam, but curiously-decent lacing.
S - Dank, sappy, a tad phenolic, and plentiful grapefruit resin as expected. The sticky dankness of it is a bit surprising and definitely deviates from Elder. 
T - Everything that anyone could expect from a landmark beer. Pine cone, of course, but moreso a balanced blending of grapefruit rind, cracker jack, citrus, and light herbs. It's a feat to make a recipe like this taste so utterly simple, yet that's exactly how it drinks. 
M - Medium body, perfect carbonation, semi-smooth, lingering residual bitterness from the finish.
D - Easily the most drinkable of the gargantuan Triple IPA's I've experienced. That being said, Exponential Hoppiness reigns supreme for now. Worth the voyage? Probably not. But I don't regret it nonetheless. 954 charactersAuracom, Feb 19, 2013
4.37/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I might be one of the few who at least from the 2013 batch of PTE think that it wasn't as good as other beers that I have had. The beer reminded me of a apple or cider after taste. It wasn't as hoppy as I personally would like and it's very smooth. Reminds me of a cross of Apple Cider and Chardonnay and an IPA. 
I have heard that 2013 was different from previous years. I prefer Pliny the Younger. Glad I got to try it at Russian River Brewing. 447 charactersoddb0d, Feb 19, 2013

A- bright golden orange with a frothy white one fingers head that hung out for a bit.
S- PINE!!! Omg this beer is like smelling a forest...orange, grapefruit, big pine, and a florally bready sweetness. 
T- Same as smell. Big pine up front, followed up with those citrusy, tropical fruit notes, and then rounded out with that big bready sweetness. Actually the finish reminds me slightly of those kings Hawaiian rolls.
M- A very full bodied beer. So thick and full...dries the shit out of the palette right away.
O- What is there to say...it's Pliny the younger and it fully lived up to the hype as far as I'm concerned. Well worth waking up at 5:30 am for. 
Interesting side note: got to taste the infamous PTY/westy 12 black and tan. Like putting peanut butter and jelly together...well worth trying if you have the means. Thanks for that one Rolando! 978 charactersedproctor, Feb 19, 2013

I drank it third in a flight of Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder, and Pliny the Younger, and it retained the head admirably while awaiting its turn (not very long, admittedly).
S--Strong piney hops, with lemon and grapefruit notes as well. No hint of the high alcohol.
T--What a delicious beer! Well worth the wait that universally accompanies a chance to drink it (unless you're sleeping with someone at Russian River, I suppose). As with the smell, there is strong piney hops upfront. As the beer warms, the pine recedes a bit and the citrus notes, especially bitter grapefruit, come out much more strongly. The bitterness of the hops is nicely balanced by a respectable maltiness, but this is clearly a very hop-forward beer. The alcohol adds some warmth, but I would not guess at the abv if I didn't know it ahead of time.
M--Strong carbonation makes this beer feel smooth and light. It is extremely drinkable despite the high abv and strong flavor. I could drink this all day in an alternate universe without drunkenness or a chronic PTY supply shortage.
O--I have been looking forward to this and drinking PTE for a long time. I think that I still slightly prefer I Hardcore You, but this is easily one of the best strong IPAs I have ever experienced. An almost perfect example of the style. 1,373 charactersjealousmonk, Feb 18, 2013

I let it sit in my mouth for about a minute, just letting it soak in. huge floral and citrus hop notes. some bready body from the yeast, but holy cow the texture of this is what surprised me the most. its not sweet and viscous like so many American big IPAs. its light on the tongue and very clean in the finish. its bitter, but it isn't a blinder in that regard. its sweet, but it isn't sappy or sugary or thick. I think the mouthfeel allows for the flavors of this beer to develop perfectly, without making it unnecessarily weighty or sticky. that element was just so pleasing. when the waitress came around offering up seconds, I shot my hand into the air faster than ive done basically anything in the last ten years. the first sip of that one surprised me too, because it was cold again. I hadn't realized how much this beer opens up with temperature. the great blossoming. theres just so much hop going on here, very west coast, very very fresh. I am not sure from a brewing standpoint what makes this so special, and why other brewers cant offer stuff like this up on a year round bases. it has a similar hop profile to the stone enjoy by series, but trumps it by miles. the pliny the elder could easily be my every day drink, but so could this. it really doesn't seem as alcoholic as it is, totally masked. wow. I really appreciate the opportunity to enjoy this, and would like to thank the people of falling rock and the crew at my table for this event. what a beer, what a good time! cant wait for next year! worth they hype and then some! 2,547 charactersStonedTrippin, Feb 18, 2013

The color is gold/straw with a long lasting, thick, white head. Unexpected for such a heavy brew. The lacing is super thick and dries onto the glass.
Pale malts are quickly overwhelmed by citrus, pine resin and beautiful floral hops. Only a hint of booze in the smell.
The taste starts with citrus and pine, lots of floral and grassy hops follow. Pale malts barely show up, alcohol is always present, but not overwhelming. Goes down too easy for having such a high alcohol content.
This is easily a hopheads wet dream. I can't say that I like it more than the Elder, but it certainly equals it while still bringing something new to the table! Find it, try it! 717 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Feb 13, 2013

A- Light golden, but not quite straw colored, and commercial clear, which surprised me for the amount of hops used. (no hop haze) Very impressed with the clarity.
SM- So much going on on the nose. Tons of citrus fruit; lemon, and grapefruit mostly, followed by a resin and piney finish. Little to no malt character is picked up in the aroma.
T- Very good balance between the malts and hops, but the malt flavors are the first to come through. Very light sweet, followed by a long linger of hop flavor and bitterness on the back end of things. Definitely get tons of Centennial and Simcoe in there.
MF- Smooth, crisp and clean. As usual with Vinnie's IPA's...
OA- Was really hoping it would not be a let down, especially after a 2.5 hour drive and then 3.5 hours in line, and it was not. Very clean and refreshing mouthfeel, tons of hop bouquet on the nose with mixes of citrus and pine, and a great malt presence that hides the alcohol and balnces the bitter backbone very well. A must try! 1,076 charactersRfunk, Feb 12, 2013

A: Nice golden yellow. A little bit of orange. Very clear.

The Younger was served in 10 oz. glasses so you really could not get the deep smell if it was in a bigger glass. I tasted it and the 4 hours melted away in my memory. After drinking 1/2 the glass I could finally smell the wonderful aromatic smell of the 10.8% brew.
I wanted to put this brew in perspective of my Russian River favorites. So I ordered a taste of Row 2 Hill 56, Blind Pig, and Pliny the Elder. This test gives you a perspective of how great this beer is. The others are still great but the Younger is a notch above. 651 charactersFive-0, Feb 10, 2013

M - Piney resin but smooth mouth feel. Too smooth, abv seemed hidden cause after taking three in, head change was evident.
O - I wanted to join beer advocate a while back, but told myself i wouldn't until having the pleasure of drinking Pliny The Younger. One of the best Double Imperial IPAS.

4.5/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Served in a 10 ounce glasses at the brewery. From notes. Reviewed 5 February 2013. Released 1 February 2013.
A: Golden and clear, with some effervescence and very little head.
S: Resiny fresh hops (like the Elder) but with a fantastic underscent of tropical fruit (mango! papaya! pineapple! orange!).
T: Mmm. It's good, great even, but I can think of a handful of tastier DIPAs. Pliny the Younger is strong and commanding, filling the mouth. It's bitter and loaded with not only pine but grapefruit peel and orange juice. The malt base is dry and biscuity (again like the Elder). The main drawback of this otherwise delicious beer is the aftertaste -- it's bitter, yes, but with an obnoxious alcoholic tinge (almost like rubbing alcohol) or a tap line that has been poorly cleaned.
M: Full and delicious. No complaints here.
O: I really enjoyed this beer, but it is almost certainly overrated. That said, it grows on me, and after three or four glasses I feel like I *get* it. It's a perfected Pliny the Elder -- the same dry malt base, same pineyness, but wayyy more fruit (yay) and more alcohol (meh). It pairs wonderfully with pizza and spicy food, and, if you can ignore the dubious aftertaste, it's VERY good. Recommended. 1,232 charactersAgentMunky, Feb 09, 2013
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Went to Russian River Brewery yesterday to get me some Younger. We parked out back and didn't see much of a line. After walking up to the bouncer, I found out the back door entrance is for folks purchasing growlers only, who could come in and get anything they want to go, for the exception of a pour of Younger. Once we walked around the front, we saw the liny for the pliny which took us 3 hours to get through. As we waited, we decided we've came too far to turn back now, but this will be a one-time thing waiting in line this long for some beer. Once we got in though, holy smokes. Pliny the Younger did NOT disappoint. Less hoppy and much smoother than Elder, it was absolutely the best 10% beer I've ever tasted. Like everyone said, lots of grapefruit...simply amazing. 776 charactersKennyPowers, Feb 08, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Waited in line a little over an hour at the brewery to enter the all-you-can-drink Pliny the Younger outing today! Hell yeah! Poured into a 10oz pint glass on tap. Served with delicious pizza made by the fellows at Russian River, who use their own beer batter for the dough. Does Pliny the Younger hold up? Oh, yes. Yes it does.
Pours a golden, copper-tinged amber orangish color with a slight amount of head. Glasses were arbitrary all around in terms of good head retention, and it seemed as such depending on the pour. I would have really preferred to see this in a snifter, but with the massive amount of people drinking this beer PER MINUTE, I doubt that would be the most feasible option. Nevertheless, the color is extraordinary. It's similar to PtE, except it looks far darker and intense in appearance, as if it spent time soaked in oak. There are bubbles that glide to the top of the glass in a graceful, near poetic manner. No alcohol legs on the glass, which is nothing but extraordinary. Has a syrupy, thickened look resemblant of wine. This is art, first and foremost.
Aroma is a little difficult to capture in a glass this small, or while it is too cold, but when it finally reveals itself, it's incredible. The triple hop markup from the original PtE recipe is evident, yet not as explosive as you'd think. There are tons of tropical notes here. This continues later in the flavor, which I will vividly explain. Mango, papaya, and pineapple soaked with pine needles, huge citrus lime flavors, and awash with alcohol sweetness and malt hearty goodness often resembling light toffee.
As for the flavor... My God, the flavor. I can't describe how amazing this is here. While the aroma was a little bit more subtle in showcasing the aspects of this recipe, the flavor is outstanding in every respect. The juicy mango notes continue, as well as other tropical varieties, and yet a huge backdrop resembling tangerines appears after every sip. There are playfully tinged pine/citrus flavors at the tip of the tongue with every sip, but they soon are replaced by the tropical flavors and bready, crisp finish aided by the malts. The more this warmed up, the more the flavor resembled taking a spoonful of fresh grapefruit right on the palate. For a beer this crazy, this is so easy to drink that by my second I was passively taking huge gulps while chatting about (contrary to the first glass, where it was respectfully sipped). The aftertaste goes on forever. Other than being easier to drink than water, the texture and body is out of this world. After each sip, the mouth slightly salivates, floral notes numb the cheeks, and the tongue is coated with a mango-hemp buttery texture. It creates a chemical reaction that makes you smack and lick the walls of your mouth and teeth, and then immediately takes you to straight to Beer Heaven.
This is utter bliss. I've had plenty of beers that far more exaggerated that this in flavor, and yet, this wins in being so ridiculously EASY to consume, especially considering the amount of flavors and complexity that goes with this. I'll be looking forward to driving up to Russian River every year when this comes out as my personal Mecca in beer enthusiasm. It's because of beers like this that I eventually took up homebrewing. Don't miss out any chance to have this if you can. It's worth every penny spent.
UPDATE (1/6/2014): The more I think about this beer, the more that I feel that I was way to swept up over the hype to review it objectively. This is a fun brew, very experimental in nature, and fully reflects the great diversity of the beer landscape in America. However, with that said, it lacks so much balance for any practical consumption if this were, say, a year-round beer. It's exclusiveness makes it fun to drink, but there's a lot of stuff whacked out with this overall - slightly under-carbonated, syrupy, extremely bitter and fruity, but no bready or dry profile to back it up. It's kind of the antithesis what makes PtE such a perfect beer to begin with. Nevertheless, it is really good and I will give this a proper revisiting this year. Until then! 4,130 charactersmagictacosinus, Feb 07, 2013

A - A golden, yellow color that looks exactly how a great IPA should.
S - Not quite as aromatic or strong as I imagined it would be, considering how Pliny the Elder really has a powerful aroma. Still, you get a strong sense of piney hops and citrus.
T - I don't think a beer this strong could taste any better or go down any smoother. No surprise that this brew is an absolute hop bomb, so if that's not your thing, I wouldn't....well no, even if you don't like hoppy brews, you should still try this one. By the time I got to my third glass, however, the taste of the alcohol began to get stronger and a bit overpowering, so take your time and enjoy the first few you have.
M - Not so thick that you can't drink them quickly, but not so thin that you can pound them down without savoring them.
As I was drinking, I began to wonder if I could be even critical of any beer that I waited in line seven hours for, as it might be too depressing. But no, this beer is deserving of the hype. If you have a day to kill, get there early and bring a book, you don't want to go your whole life without trying this beer. 1,282 characterswesclaypool, Feb 04, 2013

Pours a deep dark gold with a half finger of foam. Mild carbonation, low retention, nice sticky lacing. Would have liked to had the foam stick around a bit longer, but given the abv whatevs. The smell was dominated by strong grapefruit and other citrus and floral tones, strong over powering hops, and a mild sweet caramel malt. Taste follows the nose perfectly here, with a big citrus and hop flavor with a good sweet malty finish. Alcohol is completely masked, everything balances quite well. Feel is dry and sticky, not as bitter as I anticipated but went down incredibly easy.
Overall this beer is one of the best I've had. It packs one of the hardest punches an ipa can throw and should have notoriety among triple ipas. That said, it was more or less an amped up version of Pliny the Elder, and hyped up a little higher than it should be. I might check it out again sometime in the next couple years, but not wait ~4 hours for again 1,164 characterslordofstarside, Feb 02, 2013

A-Pours vibrant and rather clear. Thin, creamy head leaves wavy stains of lacing. I detect the lightest essence of haze in the body. Its color is a divinely illuminated shade of sunset orange. I am shocked by its clarity.
S-The wettest, ripest, juiciest and most concentrated display of hops I have ever experienced. Pine and a fist-full of grass ripped from the lawn. Then there is a cornucopia of topical fruit. Hop perfume, hop nectar, hop extract. I can smell it from a foot away.
T-The intensity and complexity of the flavors is like nothing I have ever experienced. It got better and better as it warmed. At its perfect temperature, the flavors I experienced were stunning. Peach, mango, cantaloupe, tangerine, nectarine, guava and pineapple. A liquefied sweet-dough malt embraces the hops but is absolutely overpowered. The flavors couldn't have been richer.
M-I have never had a beer with such a long aftertaste. I could literally taste it several minutes after a sip. I could taste it an hour after my final sip as well. Incredibly juicy and resinous. Like chewing on a hop. Drinks with far too much ease.
O/D-Worth the countrywide trip. Never have I experienced a beer with such a combination of power and finesse. The Jim Brown of beer. I am quite sure no beer can ever surpass this. Every beer I try after this can only hope to find a place on the same tier as Pliny The Younger... 1,483 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 01, 2013

A: Clear golden. Not much head as the pour was pretty much to top of glass.
S: Lots of tropical fruits and pines
T: Perfect, big hops, fruity, and perfect balance. Does not taste like a triple IPA
M: almost perfect. A little resiny in the mouth, but not nearly as much as one would expect from a 10+% IPA.
O: Still the best IPA I have ever had. 378 charactersgrrrah, Jan 28, 2013

A: Pours a very clear golden-orange. One finger of medium-white head. Head dissipated very quickly, leaving nice lacing behind.
S: Lots of grapefruit and orange. Behind that there is tropical fruit, floral scents and pine. Smells very sweet.
T: The alcohol on this one is hidden really well. Has a well balanced citrus and tropical fruit sweetness with a malty backbone. Very crisp and drinkable. Less hop bitterness than the Elder on this one.
M: Medium-light body with medium carbonation. Has a great stickiness to it, which is probably my favorite part of this beer.
O: This is a very well balanced, refreshing and drinkable beer, especially considering that it comes in at 11%. With that said, I prefer many other DIPAs (yes, I know this is a triple) to this and I don't think it's worth going nuts over. 981 charactersLaChupacabra, Nov 09, 2012

3.78/5  rDev -19.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Appearance is clear, light amber in color, with a thin white head that leaves minimal lacing around the glass. Aroma is bursting with grapefruit and hops, with notes of sweet honey, caramel & fruit. Taste is sweet caramel malt upfront, mildly piney in the mid-palate, with a slightly bitter hop finish. Not too hoppy though. Very rich & well balanced. Mouthfeel is light in body, smooth, & again slightly bitter in the finish. Overall, is it the best Imperial IPA in the world? That’s subjective; I see how people could think so. I think it’s pretty damn good, but I tried it in a blind tasting among other DIPA’s, and it certainly wasn’t my favorite. The hype plays a lot into this. Still, extremely glad I got to try this! 732 charactersSamichlaus82, Oct 24, 2012

Pours a translucent dark, almost ruby amber with little head. The aroma screams of citrus and alcohol. The taste is nothing short of fantastic: a moderate sweetness from the malt backbone helps sustain the rigorous amount of hops and booze. I'd say PtY is easy to drink one after the other if not for it being a logistical impossibility.
Even though it's the only place PtY is available on the East coast, it's still nearly impossible to obtain in Philly... unless you're willing to jump through hoops or pay through the nose for it. As amazing as PtY is, no beer is worthy of its level of hype. If you can get it for a reasonable price, though, I highly recommend it. 706 charactersJimsArcade, Sep 24, 2012

Wonderfully complex hop aroma, lots of citrus grapefruit and orange being in the forefront. The flavor is big with lots of caramel offset with plenty of hop flavor mostly of the peach/grapefruit/orange vein. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel. Very nice big IPA that I waited much to long in line to taste. I’m glad I got to try this its a great beer, but I think I prefer the elder. 546 charactersjohnnnniee, Aug 17, 2012

This beer was served in a 10 oz. glass. It is a dark orange with a thin white head, and it smells of sweet cherries, cantaloupe, zinfandel, hops. Upon drinking this beer, I was hit with an intense sweetness, but the hoppiness of the beer smoothed this out, and there was a really good balance. This is a very complex beer that should be sipped - three and I was feeling more than fine. 520 characterschrisrose30, Jul 31, 2012

A. Pours a light golden orange color with some subtle hazing. Quarter finger of crisp white head with some excellent lacing. The most striking thing about Younger is its color: it practically glows in my glass. Beauty fermented.
S. Just a metric crap-ton of tropical fruit flavors, including pineapple, mango, and tangerine. Good dose of pine resin and grassy notes. Orange zest and honey provide a wonderful smoothness to the entire affair. A smooth, sweet, light bouquet. Loads of honey and tropical scents. Top notch.
T. Lots of floral, citrusy, and grassy hops. The initial flavor is sweetness, but not sticky-like. This beer slowly grows and warms to you, with the citrus and floral notes yielding to some bitter and earthy grassy/piney flavors providing a bitter finish. Touch of alcohol on the back-end. The most striking facet of the beer is how smooth yet hoppy it is. The strong caramel malt really balances out the bitterness. Malt, pine resin, and minerality combine with sweet honey and floral presence to create a flavor profile that is quite pleasing.
M. Drinks a little too smooth and light for a Triple IPA. Not a hop-ocalpyse by any means as the bitterness is mellowed near perfectly by the malt. 
O. Shockingly smooth for all the hop flavor packed into this. A very well-crafted beer. ABV of 11.0%? Could have fooled me with how smooth this is. It's not the be all end all that the hype-storm would lead you to believe. Would I drive to Philly again to try it? Probably not. But if you haven't had this, will you be disappointed investing a lot of time and/or money into getting a taste? I don't think so. It's a delicious beer and worthy of mention as a top notch IPA. 1,767 characterssiege06nd, Jul 15, 2012

The beer has a light golden color with citrus and floral aromas. This sour beer has a strong grapefruit taste but the bitterness does not linger long. 
This beer is almost impossible to find unless you live near Santa Rosa. I accidentally had my first taste on a wine trip to the area, having enough of the grape juice I asked around for a great beer spot and was unanimously pointed to the Brew Pub on 4th. My beer life has never been the same.
Cheers for this beer and a second cheers for it's limited production. 571 charactersUSChuy, Jun 15, 2012

Pliny the Younger pours a crystal clear orange, with just a dusting of white foam crowning the beer before it fades away into nothing. The nose reeks of mango, pineapple, and grapefruits. Each time I lean in close to the glass a different fruit comes across as dominant, and each time the aroma feels like it falls in a subtly different spot on a spectrum between citrus and tropical fruit. The flavor profile leads off with a touch of bready malts. The bitterness that rolls through next is definitely big, but it's very much smooth and refined, rather than raw and assertive. The hoppy finish perfectly translates all those fruits from the nose. It's amazing how potent and... juicy, for lack of a better word, the hop flavors are. The body is absurdly light and lean for any 11% beer, and married to carbonation that is exquisite in it's activity and the life it brings to the hop profile. The magic of Pliny the Younger is it has all the hops you'd expect from an 11% hop bomb, but body and alcohol wise drinks like it's closer to 7%. I don't know how Vinnie and co. manage to pull this off, but it's worth making the pilgrimage to Philly to grab a glass or two. 1,259 charactersaxeman9182, May 03, 2012

If you enjoy strong hop beers and like the taste of citrus fruits, I would highly recommend this to you. I have tasted a similar beer from Russian River - Pliny the Elder. The Elder is much more drinkable than this beer. The Younger is very alcoholic and not a beer for every day casual drinking. If you are looking for high quality Imperial IPA - try locating this beer...if you can. 492 charactershopstermonster1, Apr 26, 2012

Perfect Beer.

A- beautiful amber color, hazed slightly, with minimal head.
S- Tons of hops, sweet smelling citrus, loved the aroma on this beer.
T- Very smooth, not bitter, and hints of citrus, and very hoppy. About as perfect as you can get for taste in a beer for me.
M- smooth bodied, full bodied.
O - Wow, all the hype about this beer is true. The best beer I've ever drank. I was stunned at how such a strong beer can be so smooth and tasty and loaded with hops. 561 charactersphishphorce, Apr 15, 2012

S: Gentle hop aromas fill the nose, nothing overpowering with some hints of lemongrass.
T: Extremely pleasant taste of hops straight off, but quickly fades into faint citrus flavors. A fantastic balance of flavors.
MF/D: Awesome! This beer goes down extremely smoothly for the ABV. Faint bubbles dance across the mouth dispersing the flavors equally. Definitely worth the wait and lived up to my hype.

4.94/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally had my first pour of this delicious beer at the Vine Street Pub in Denver back on March 1. It took all of 11 minutes to blow through the 1/6 barrel and the staff there handled it very well - they were awesome.
APPEARANCE: Light, pale and yellow. Slightly lighter than both Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder. The head was perfectly proportioned and very thick and creamy looking, almost like a Boddington's. The lacing was minimal.
SMELL: Grapefruit is the first and most noticeable aroma, but the Younger is very nicely rounded out with some pine, floral notes and a bit of tropical fruit lingering behind it all. The aroma is also strong and according to my notes, perfect.
TASTE: This beer is on the sweet side up front and gently moves towards the bitter end throughout the sip. At no point, however, is this beer overstated in either direction and despite the change in balance, both bitterness and sweetness remain intact for the whole sip. Grapefruit, pine, passion fruit, tropical fruit, everything good about an IPA is packed into this beer. 
MOUTHFEEL: Pliny the Younger starts out slightly creamy, but slowly bubbles up to a nice, solid tickly sparkle. It is neither too sweet nor too dry. The finish is a little bitter, but very clean. 
OVERALL: This beer lived up to the hype for me. Somehow it is everything a beer should be all at the same time even when it contradicts itself. There is not much to say other than this beer cannot be improved in any category with the minor exception of the appearance; I would have liked to have seen some more lacing and a darker color. When I had the good fortune to come across a second pour at Cheeky Monk, I tasted the Elder next to it and the word that came to mind to describe how Younger is different was "brighter". Pliny the Younger is just a brighter, more alive and even happier beer than the Elder. This was one of the best beers I have ever tasted. 1,919 charactersStoneTSR, Mar 25, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky enough to stumble across this while in the Philadelphia area to spend time with my wife’s family. I had it at the Blue Dog Tavern in Chalfont at an awesome event that was not too crowded even.
Younger is served up a pretty run of the mill medium amber with some orange highlights. The beer is just slightly cloudy. There is not much of a head on the pour, but the lacing is nuts.
The aroma is sweet and hoppy. It has plenty of mandarin orange like aromas with mango, pineapple and a pine. The sweetness is pretty non-descript and sugary. As sweet as it is, the hops definitely make themselves known.
The flavor is not nearly as sweet as I expected. It is super, SUPER hoppy with tons of citrus, tropical flavors and pine. It is super dank and resinous. You can tell they dry hopped the hell out of this brew to offset the sweetness resulting from the large grain bill.
The mouthfeel is medium with a surprisingly easy drinking mouthfeel that is sticky, yet not overpowering. It is certainly a sipper and is rough on the palate, but at the same time it retains the relative drinkability that I find to be a cornerstone of Vinnie’s hoppy brews.
So, what was my overall impression of one of the most highly rated beers in the world? It certainly did not live up to the massive wall of hype that surrounds it. This is an awesome beer, but I hate to say that the most compelling thing about it was just that it is so hard to come by. I had my four ounces and then tried some other special beers they had on tap and ended up liking Double Daisy Cutter a lot better. My recommendation: If you can get this beer, drink it and enjoy it. However, don’t go to drastic lengths just because it has such a cult following and a limited distribution. You might end up being disappointed and unable to enjoy it for the excellent beer that it is. 1,851 characterszoso1967, Mar 24, 2012

Went last year on a weekday and had a great experience. This year I went on a Sunday so we got there a little early because we expected a line. By the time it opened there were probably over 300 people in line. I had 4 glasses and had a great time once again. I also had it a few weeks later at Tazzina Bistro in Woodland, CA. Each of my beers were 10oz pours.
A- Pours a very pale yellow. Each time I was served this beer there was almost no head, a sprinkling of white around the edges. But it is not what it appears to be.
S- A very inviting sweet floral smell. The pine and citrus round it all out. Clean and balanced yet very hoppy.
T- Hops are everywhere but everything seems so well balanced. It almost seems impossible to fit this many IBUs in a beer and have it be this balanced. The sweetness is also balanced by the citrus and pine notes.
M- Smooth and nice body. The carbonation is there. The pine sits on your tongue and really takes away some of the strong alcohol feel.
O- The most balanced beer I have ever had. Very strong hops that work well together, This beer is never overpowering in any aspect. I would drive for a day to have this beer next year... luckily I don't have to. 1,318 charactersMuthacack, Mar 22, 2012

Waited in line for over 2 hours to get inside and get a crack at this baby. Had it last year, and came back in 2012. There is a reason I came back.
A- Clear...an orange/amber color. Almost apricot. A finger thick head when poured from the tap, that held during the entire drinking. Laced the glass down to the bottom. 
S- I get orange peel and grapefruit...followed by blend of pine and honey. It actually took several attempts to pick these elements out...its a clean, strong, balanced, hoppy aroma. 
T- Jesus. Dry hops with a citrus smash off the top. The malt, holds it own here, though, so somehow this comes off as ridiculously hoppy, yet...balanced. There is a bit of pine that come in at the back end...and something strangely earthly/floral. It's a bit sticky on the palate as well. This beer should definitely be sipped, as it will overwhelm you if you take too much at once. I won't lie...this is the single best IPA I've ever had (single, double, triple all included). 
M- Crisp and sticky. Perfect carbonation. It just seems to flow over your tongue.
O- If you ever see this beer, drink it. For some reason, even the fellows in my group who don't like hops even loved this beer. It's extremely hoppy, but perfectly balanced. It's as good as its reputation. 1,374 charactersWxworkoff, Mar 22, 2012

M- Couldn't ask for much more. Great body and carbonation. Aftertaste goes on for days...
O- Overall, I'm really glad I got to try this. I had a glass of Elder right after, and it really emphasized how great this beer is. Wish I didn't have to try so hard to land a glass, but was glad to have had the chance. I actually bought a glass for a non-beer drinker, and he was blown away.

The first time I had Elder on tap it was the first 5 I gave for appearance, it was a brilliant glowing orange. The snifter of Younger was a bit duller, still looked good, I just couldn't give it a 5.
The smell, oh the smell. Straight hops. Just like opening a bag of hops to brew with. Tons of bright citrus and pine, Lemons, grapefruit, citrus, just a touch of dank-ness. So complex, so much going on, so strong. This is really nice. From memory it seems just a bit more intense than Elder but only fractionally so.
The taste. How do they do that? All the hops from the aroma with a strong bracing bitterness and a dryness that cleanses the palate. The hop flavor is so pure, no vegetalness or any other flavor that detracts from the hops.
The mouthfeel. For me, this is what separates this beer from others. 11% and it drinks like 3%. I could sip on this all day long. No harsh characteristics or burn, just easy drinking hop juice.
Overall a phenomenal beer. Definitely better than elder but elder is so good it is hard to be much better. I was glad to take off work a bit early to enjoy this but in my opinion it is not so much better than elder that it justifies the type of crazy things people do to try it. Very grateful I got the chance to try it. 1,326 charactersquirkzoo, Mar 13, 2012

Not only was I able to have the Younger but I had the Elder to pair with which was perfect. This beer poured out as a really nice looking golden copper color with a thin white head on top. The lacing isn't too sticky on this which I was surprised. The smell of the beer is loaded up with tropical fruits, pine and other forms of hop aromas. There isn't much in the way of malt coming off this bad boy on the nose. The taste of this beer is big. It's much easier to taste the massive different between the Younger & Elder when having them side by side. Younger lingers on the tongue for a very extended amount of time which keeps the beer in the glass for a longer period of time (which I personally enjoy). The flavors of pine and tingling hop flavors just cut into your taste buds leaving you with cotton mouth almost immediately after the first sip. The mouthfeel of this beer is a bit heavier than the Elder. It's little bit more oily too. Overall this beer is something that I'm proud to say that I got to try finally. I'm even more glad that I compare the two with each other. I can see now why people like the Elder better than the Younger simply based on the drinkablity. The younger is something that needs to be enjoyed over a good amount of time where the Elder is more session-able even though it's not. I wouldn't decline either Pliny on any day, I enjoy both beer a lot and I look forward to the next time I get to have this beer again. 1,539 charactersKnapp85, Mar 12, 2012

The place was packed and I noticed everyone was drinking the same thing. I saw the Pliny the Younger tap and laughed a little to my wife about it. The bartender said it was no joke, they had it unadvertised. Talk about serendipity!!!! We drank it from wine glasses. (yes, even my non beer drinking spouse liked this one!). It did not have a head. The beer is a beautifully distinctive strawberry blond color. The aroma is citrusy hops. The taste is the same. This beer is the essence of west coast hops but it is not bitter. (this is why the girls like it and other enthusiasts like the elder better). How do they get all that hop flavor without the bitterness? This is the genius if this brew. I favor stout beers so this won't be the best in the world for me, but it is damn good, and probably is the best in it's class. Drink it if you can get it!!! 977 characterstomfneph, Mar 11, 2012

A- very pretty golden brew, orange highlights and loads of bubbles. Good carbonation. Lacing all over the glass.
S- Very fruity. Mango, pineapple, pine sap, kiwi. Incredible nose. No malt in here! Aggressive hop aroma all throughout.
T- Its a toss up here between the nose. Very bitter, biting hop flavor. The fruit is orange peel, mango and some honeydo. Sticky syrup, strong pine needles. The hops blend very to me as floral and earthy in profile. No abv detected.
M- Ever so smooth and crisp. Light to medium body and high carbonation. Sticky mouthfeel, coating my teeth. The best part of the beer for me.
O- Two four oz pours didn't do this justice. Incredibly drinkable. What sets this apart from other beers I feel is it really has no flaws. Is it the best beer in the world? I'd say no, better then elder? That's a toss up. Grateful I got to try this though. Blue Dog handled this event very well. 954 charactershaazer, Mar 11, 2012
4.44/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5So Pliny The Younger... is it worth the hype? Maybe. Do I like Pliny The Elder better? Absolutely.
So why? Even though the Younger is triple hopped, the flavors and character of the Elder come through much more loud and clear. Pliny The Younger is a remarkable beer for its smoothness and crisp finish, but it lacks the unique Something that The Elder has in spades.
Does The Younger deserve the 100 rating from Beer Advocate? A reserved YES. The Younger is by far one of the best beers I have ever drank, but the score of 100 needs to be measured against The Elder which is far and away the better brew IMHO.
How do I justify the rating? If not for the high alcohol content, this would be my perfect sessionable beer bar none. No lingering taste, no overwhelming breath, ample flavor and a delightful feel from lip to throat - The Younger is truly a World Class Beer as far as I am concerned. 896 characters72hw, Mar 11, 2012

Served in a Fuller's half pint tulip
500mL flip top bottle
HUGE thanks to ricoch3t for bottling this up and sending it across the pond - you are a true gentleman and scholar my friend (especially considering how much I miss proper American DIPAs)!
In order to properly review this beer (again), I had to get "dressed up" for the occasion - i.e. putting on my PtY work shirt that I scored from RR while visiting last May. This definitely added to the experience since I was enjoying the beer alone since I couldn't convince anyone in Dublin to meet up.
A: Bright apple juice color. A few soft bubbles, but no real head per se on a vigorous pour. I assume that has something to do with the 10-day trek from the Rockies to the Emerald Isle.
S: Heavenly! Hop oils, pine, citrus, and more hops.
T: Burst of hops from the start followed by oily/piney middle to back with very nice citrus fruit. So, so excellent!
M: Fully bodied with almost no carbonation. Thick and chewy. The greatness sticks around for a bit which is awesome!
O: Standing ovation...still! I was a bit nervous about how this would hold up over the journey of 4,000+ miles from Denver to Dublin, but it made the trip just fine and came out swinging. If you haven't tried this, make it happen! It is worth the sacrifice and search. If you can make it happen, you will not be disappointed. If you are, send the rest to me! 1,403 charactersspdyfire83, Mar 10, 2012

Reviewed from notes cobbled together the next day in a somewhat hungover state.
Clear apricot with a steady bead and minimal head - however the half-pint serving vessels filled to the rim all but exclude a reasonable head assessment.
Dark, brooding aromas of rockmelon, orange, guava, passionfruit and pineapple.
Flavours follow the nose, but become more animated - especially from the 3rd glass on. Bitterness hits early but the magnitude of the flavours makes it seem quite sane. The bizarrest part is that it seems to become more drinkable and moreish with each glass.
The hop oils provide a delightful chewiness, yet the mouthfeel is generally middle of the road in all respects - carbonation, bitterness and evenness.
Amazing how well it works. Ordeal by hops that is devilishly addictive. The more you have the more you want. Started out not super impressed with this, but by the 6th glass I felt increasingly like a dog with a bone. Lacks just a little complexity in my eyes to be truly mindblowing. 1,074 charactersspicelab, Mar 09, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Bishop's Collar.
Pours clear golden orange color, fluffy white head that recedes quickly. Streaky lacing down the glass.
Smells like pine, fresh-cut grass, tangerine, apples, grapefruit, and a little mango, pineapple. A ton of hops with some malt in the background.
Tastes like fresh hops, sweet tropical fruit flavors, but also malt to balance. Alcohol well masked, nice and dry. The finish is incredibly long and lingering. Wonderful.
Mouthfeel is medium viscosity, reasonable carbonation. Smooth and creamy, with a little stickiness.
Overall, this met the hype for me. I had this alongside Hopslam, and while Hopslam had more tropical fruit/pineapple notes, it was way too sweet and syrupy compared to PtY. Very drinkable, so smooth, everything I love about Pliny the Elder but more extreme. I hope to enjoy this again next year. 847 charactersislandboi8204, Mar 09, 2012

4.16/5  rDev -10.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had twice on tap in Philly. Really glad I got to try it twice. Went into it not buying the hype, and while it exceeded my expectations, it's nowhere close to the best beer in the world. Review is based mainly on the 8 oz. tulip of Younger I scored at Resurrection Ale House. Kudos to Brendan and Leigh for doing it right!
A - pale orange, with a bit of white head, which quickly receded to a mere ring, although lacing was somewhat impressive given the lack of retention. Carbonation was what you would expect from a beer this big.
S - this is where Younger really shines. Slight bit of bitter hops gives way to a wonderful citrus hop aroma, accentuated by a nectary, honey note in the background. Strong and balanced, the insane amount of dry hopping has a definite payoff in the aroma. Well done.
T - flavor follows the nose. Massive citrus notes blend well with the honey and malt backbone. There isn't much bad to say about the flavor, but it didn't wow me the way you'd expect from all the hype. The overall lack of cloying bitterness was a welcome surprise considering this is a west coast IPA, but since I'm used to a maltier, more balanced IPA experience here on the east coast, this isn't anything new to me. Good for sure, but not a revelation by any means.
M - a bit thin, as is typical for a big IPA, though it did leave a lasting film on the tongue which gave it a pleasant aftertaste, for a while. It became less pleasant as it lingered.
O - A very good beer, but not quite world class. Not up to the hype by any means, but worth seeking out if you can score a pour without elbowing your way through a crowd. 1,627 characterskdb150, Mar 08, 2012
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had on-tap at Monk's in Philadelphia, PA. Poured a clear golden orange color with a whispy/fluffy thin white head that receded fairly fast, leaving streaky lacing on the glass. The aroma was pretty heavenly. Tropical fruits, citrus, pine...very enticing. Taste starts off sweet with a strong taste of grapefruit/mango/citrus, and finishes a bit dry with a resinous taste. It is bitter/dry, but not overly so and the hop profile is VERY well-balanced and IMO damn near perfect. Drinks pretty well considering the ABV. Medium in body...honestly, worth the hype.
I had this side-by-side with Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder and honestly I preferred Pliny the Younger. It's a unique, delicious beer that I hope to enjoy again next year. 731 charactersMsRif, Mar 08, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally got a chance to try this at Resurrection Ale House in Philadelphia this morning, and it certainly lived up to the hype.
Aroma:
Wonderful blend of luscious citrus fruits (orange, tangerine, grapefruit) with a firm piney resinous character backing it up. Some alcohol is noticeable, but perfectly acceptable (not hot or solventy at all). No malt to be found - just a clean canvas for hops!
Appearance:
Pale gold with a slight orange hue. A bit hazy (but that's to be expected with the level of dry hopping this beer surely has) with a large white head, falling over several minutes leaving thick, belgian-like lacing behind.
Flavor:
Hops, Hops, Hops, with just a hint of malt support. Bold citrus and pine dominate (Tangerine/Grapefruit, some lemony notes with firm pine/resinous flavors lingering). The bitterness is huge but not overwhelming; in a way the sheer amount of flavor from the hops helps to cut through. There's a perception that the bitterness in this beer is balanced by resin rather than malt, and it totally works. Finish is crisp, with bitterness lingering long afterwards. I mean seriously long. As in, I left the bar, walked about a half mile home, and still felt a pine-resin bitterness coating my tongue. No flaws to be found (esters/diacetyl), though its possible a low ester exists and is simply covered up by the fruitiness of the hops.
Mouthfeel:
Medium bodies, with moderately low carbonation. Very smooth considering the high abv and absurd hopping rates (which lends a certain bitter astringency to the mouthfeel of some double/triple IPAs). As with the flavor, the resiny character seems to counteract any astringency from the hops.
Overall:
Wonderful beer; I certainly plan to sample this again if I ever get the chance, however unlikely that may be. 1,792 charactersrickfrothingham, Mar 06, 2012

T: Extremely pleasant taste of hops straight off, but quickly fades into faint citrus flavors. A fantastic balance of flavors.

Look: Pours a darker shade of yellow with some orangish hues and totally translucent. 1/4 inch head and little retention
Smell: Copious amounts of pine and pine resin with a touch of citrus zest
Taste: You get that same pine resin upfront and its almost too much. I remember someone at my table saying "it reminds me of walking in the forest" The backend carries some nice citrus and honey notes which actually saved it for me
Mouthfeel: Medium body and mildly carbonated and incredibly bitter and dry. Which each sip my mouth became more and more dry and the beer became harder to drink
Overall: Glad I got the chance to try this one and glad all these west coast BA's hyped the shit out of this because I was excited to try it and then totally let down. Will NOT drink again 834 charactersDarthKostrizer, Mar 06, 2012

Old Review...
Served on-tap at Monk's on Russian River Monday. Finally captured the dragon.
A - Pours clear golden orange with a fluffy one finger tall white head leaving thin sheets of lace down the glass. A very nice looking beer.
S - Smells of fresh cut grapefruits, apricots, pine needles, pungent citric hops and a touch of sweetness creeping in as it warms up. The balance of aromas is very well maintained throughout.
T - Starts off with a ton of tropical fruits - mostly grapefruits, mangos and pineapples - quickly giving way to a mix of strong, bitter citric hops, fresh cut pine and a bit of sweet malt. The balance of this beer is amazing for how big it really is. Finish has plenty of lingering bitterness, clinging to the pallet long after the finish.
M - Medium-Light body with a well balanced flavor and moderate carbonation. Bitterness is surprisingly mild, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile.
O - What more is there to say that hasn't already been said? This one is easily one of the best beers I have ever had. I could drink this one all day, and that is saying something. 1,275 charactersorangesol, Mar 06, 2012

Younger watch 2012!
No sad sob stories of long lines or pawning off my first born here. Seems like the SD establishments handled this year’s release in stride.
-1st sampled at Pizza Port Brewbies Fest 2012 
$5 per 6oz taster – 02-11-12
Aroma and flavor was so on point here – hops were floral, vibrant, and pronounced. Alcohol barely detectable. Could have been Elder if I didn’t know any better! Really great stuff.
-2nd encounter at Stone Brew – happened upon a “silent tapping” & quite the dumb luck. 
$8 per 10oz - 02-21-12 at time of review 
A: Served in a chilled 10oz goblet by Dr. Bill himself. Pours a golden straw-amber color with decent clarity. Tiny white rim of head and a bit of leggy lace down the glass.
S: Smells of citrus peels and various stone fruits like apricot. Some evergreens and light caramel sweet malts. Noticeable Alcohol notes. 
T: Tastes of citrus fruits with predominant grapefruit and tangerine flavors, loads of resinous pine, and a smooth caramel malt backing. Alcohol definitely present and warming but not too overbearing. Moderate bitterness levels overall. Not too sweet. Smooth drinkable and delicious. 
M: Med. body but rather light for such a big brew. Smooth overall with a decent creamy texture. Some sticky hop resin coating. Nice crisp drying finish. Signature Pliny.
D: A really great TRIPA that isn’t cloying in any way. Solid in balance. Hoppy yes but definitely enjoyed this more just 10 days prior. Went from really great to just really good. Not sure if it is Stone’s use of chilled glassware that muted the hops a bit here but alcohol seemed much more evident to the point of being a touch boozy. 
All in all Younger will kick your ass!

Pours a clear golden color with an off-white head that fades to nothing. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of pine and citrus zest hops, honey, and alcohol. Taste is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, slight pine, and a honey sweetness. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a light level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good DIPA that is quite tasty but it doesn’t quite live up to the hype in my opinion. 584 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 05, 2012

PtY was fantastic - I'm not sure if it totally lived up to what I expected, but it was very good. I'd had Elder a few times before and actually drank it side by side with Younger, and honestly couldn't tell a whole lot of difference. Younger seemed to be a little drier, but that was as much of a difference as I could sense. Love 'em both, but Elder is easier and cheaper, so I don't know if I'll really worry too much about finding Younger in future years. Needless to say, it's pretty awesome, and I'm glad I tried it! 586 charactersshangwang, Mar 05, 2012

This is obviously a fantastic beer, so I won't try to describe it any more than it already has been. All I wanted to mention is that Pliny the Younger reminded us of Sweetwater Brewing Co's 420 Extra Pale Ale. Call me crazy, but my fellow Atlanta native buddy and I both had a similar response...

Very nice golden color, little head at all.
The smell on this beer is its strongest characteristic. I could've smelled it all day. Citrus and pine melded together perfect. It is not a faint aroma either.
Taste follows the smell, strong citrus and pine flavors. The taste of alcohol is there, but at 11% it is hidden more than would be expected.
In the mouth it feels great. This ain't yo mammas beer! It is nice and substantial and it coats the mouth in delicious hop resins.

4.58/5  rDev -1.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pliny. The. Younger. I finally had a chance to drink this illusive brew a few times over the pats week. Thanks to Teresa's Next Door and TJ's for the way they handled this. 
The beer pours an extremely light golden orange color. Very clear. The initial aroma is a tropical fruit hop profile, with some floral notes. Taste is bitter with a nicely balanced malt profile. Whereas Elder is much more balanced, Younger leans toward the hop side. Aromas and tastes change as the beer warms. Seems every time I lean in for a sniff I get something different: citrus, grapefruit, slight pine, tropical fruit, lemon. It's as if every tpye of hop flavor and smell is worked into the beer somehow. Medium-bodied (leaning toward lighter). The only evidence of the high alcohol content is a slight chest warming, but it's nowhere in the taste. It's quite amazing how this beer mimics something smaller, lighter and more drinkable, yet it's such a big beer. 
I love this beer. The best thing about it is the complexity of the flavors and the aromas, which makes it seem as if you are drinking several different beers at once. Dangerously drinkable. 1,135 charactersBlanco, Mar 04, 2012

A - This is the color of what a Triple IPA should look like. Its almost a pale orange in color with little to no head. The color is truely something to be amazed by.
S - This thing is like a being punch by a pine needle in the face with a clean citrus aroma that follows. You can taste the hops through your nose. 
T - A hop resin bomb is what you get when you first taste. A hop resin flavor that has both piney and citrus fruit flavors. This is great cold and mellows out a lot as it warms up. Truely a unique taste thats hard to describe but leaves you wanting more.
M - Smooth resin mouthfeel. Velvet texture that is so easy to drink.
O - This is a fantastic IIIPA that leaves you wanting more. Not as much piney carbonation as the Elder but a unique beer that everyone must try. It is almost hard to believe this is a 10% beer as they have masked the alcohol very well. Probably not worth waiting 3 hrs for or even the best beer I have had.

As a casual observer for the last few years the hysteria surrounding this beer was been overwhelming and something of a fascination for me. Horror stories of waiting in horrendous lines just for a chance to sample, amusing tirades by local barkeeps, hostile bartenders, etc. This has been something of a turn off to say the least. Was there a beer worthy of such insanity? Well I made a last minute decision to head over to Vine Street pub in Denver yesterday, 3/1/2012 to find out...if I was fortunate enough to score an elusive ticket. Parking was atrocious and knowing they were tapping the keg at 4:20, the short drive from the office to pub seemed an eternity. I was able to get one of the last 20 tickets at the pub. The place was busier than I have ever seen it and you could feel the apprehension of all these beer geeks (myself included) watching the clock tick ever so slowly. Cameras were out all over the bar just taking pictures of the tap handle! The comical looks at some of the dining patrons who clearly had no idea what was happening was rather amusing. One lady even asked her partner, "What the f*ck is going on!?" My friend was rolling down 17th to join me as they continued handing out tickets. 15 tickets left! 10 tickets left! 5 tickets left! 3 tickets left! They were disappearing at an alarming rate! I called him up and told he he needed to get his ass to the bar! Stuck in traffic? Throw that jeep up on the curb and get here! As he drove by the window "2 tickets!" PARK IN THE FIRE LANE! He dashed in right as they were calling LAST TICKET! We did everything in our power to get noticed, bam! He was awarded the last ticket! But wait, the manager promised the ticket to someone else! WTF!? In the end everything worked out ok and we both scored a 10 ounce pour of Pliny the Younger. The keg flowed non-stop for what was probably 15-20 minutes until kicked, much to the chagrin of the beer geeks who let out a resounding sigh of disappointment as the keg died. Easily the most stressful beer chase in my life, was it worth it!? On to the review:
The beer was poured to a 10 ounce wine glass with extreme care by the army of employees Vine Street had on hand. They had an assembly line of workers to distribute the beer, fascinating. As the keg was tapped and the glasses filled the entire bar was filled with a billowing aroma of sweet citrus and piney hops. The power of the aroma was glorious! It was like swimming in a cloud of hops and I didn't even have my beer yet! Finally my glass, the beer is a crystal clear yellow golden amber color with a smaller 1/2 finger white head. Good retention and lacing. The staff was very observant of not spilling a drop and filling each glass with extreme care, nice, and odd and unlike anything I have ever seen. The aroma of the beer in my hand was even more impressive than what I experienced as it flowed from the keg. Huge hop character with hints of tangerine, pineapple, orange, pine, and grapefruit along with a distinct sweetness clearly evident in the nose. The most impressive aroma of any IPA I've experienced, it knocks you in the face and reminds you who you're dealing with. The flavor is equally impressive with an initial surge of the hops. Medium bitter the hops and caramel fruity sweetness actually balance the beer very well. Absolutely no hint of the high abv whatsoever and extremely drinkable. Full bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. The beer drinks like a meal, chewy, with hop resins that linger on the palette well after the sweetness has faded. The flavor lasts on the tongue longer than any beer I've ever had, easily. Well crafted brew.
Overall, to say I really enjoyed the experience would be an understatement. Worthy of the hype? Tough call. The beer is amazing. To be honest the whole experience while stressful and chaotic in hindsight was actually a lot of fun! The whol ordeal is something I won't soon forget and perhaps that factors into the rating of the beer. As one of a couple triple IPA's I've had, this is hands down the winner... by a landslide. I now understand and respect the hysteria surrounding this beer and feel most fortunate to have had the opportunity to experience Pliny the Younger. 4,242 charactershopfacebrew, Mar 02, 2012

4.23/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is my first official BA review. PtY on tap at the Bier Stein in Eugene OR.
A- Great golden almost orange appearance. No great head but the color was fantastic.
Smell- After being poured it was very piney with a good citrus note. Delicious hop smell that can be smelled from distance. Can tell that a hop punch is going to come with the taste.
Taste- First sip the citrus comes out very clearly with a still piney/ fruit hop aftertaste. Delicious. After it started to warm up the pine settled and the a lot more tree fruit comes out. I got green apple and pear. 
M-Good mouth feel for an IIPA. Much better then the elder which I feel lacks in mouth-feel. Really felt as if something was going down.
O- I think it is a great IIPA. Best beer in the world...EEHH? It really does mask the alcohol incredibly and tastes great. Since we only had one 8oz pour and this is my first taste I don't think I can have the same review as people who have had it multiple time. Great beer. Would definitely have it again? Yes. Would i fight huge mobs of people. Probably not, unless it was from the source. 1,099 charactersBrewsoBrewco, Mar 02, 2012

4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After calling Russian River, the distributor, and driving over an hour in Philly, I finally experienced the Younger. The hype, travel, and effort were well worth it.
Appearance: Nice, golden, white head, but it lacked a little bit, could have been thicker and had better retention.
Smell: The perfect smell. Strong hop aroma with hint of grapfruit, pine, lemon, citrus
Taste: Perfect. Such a nice hop taste, but so perfectly balanced that it isn't overpowering, but still enough to give it that great hop taste. Nice and crisp, medium body.
Mouthfeel: Again, perfect. Carbonation was right one (not sure what happened with the head, though), medium body was perfect.
Overall: Again, head lacked a tad. Aroma was perfect, taste was perfect. This is a very hoppy IIPA but is so perfectly balanced as to not overpower, giving it the perfect taste. 849 charactersBlackDog, Mar 01, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was one of the lucky ones to get a glass of this at TJs. The sixtel lasted all of 55 minutes before it kicked. 2012 version of the beer.
Poured from a tap into a 12 ounce tulip glass.
A: A light to medium orange color with a half finger white head that sat atop the beer. No glass lacing once I started to consume it.
S: This beer smells so damn good. Prickly hops with pine and citric notes mix with some sugar sweetness and some herbal notes.
T: The hops are amazing. Lots of prickly pine mix with grapefruit and some floral flavors, even a hint of some tropical fruits. The sweetness is sugar like with no real heavy malt flavors, just a bit of biscuit. Finish turns slightly bitter but some slight sugar sweetness lingering. Alcohol provides some warmth on the finish but it's a dry warmth. Amazing how the abv is hidden with the dryness.
M: Full, coating, prickly, sweet and some alcohol. This beer has everything.
O: Just a tremendous beer that is very complex, a bit more so than the Elder. It's not quite as drinkable as the Elder, but it seems so much more special and one to sip and savor. Fabulous.
Is PtY worth the hype that it gets? In my eyes, it definitely does and I'm so glad I got a glass this year. Thanks Jeff and TJs! 1,247 charactersKadonny, Mar 01, 2012

pours very pretty gold, i got the first pour of the tap, big head, took couple minutes to settle while i eagerly anticipated, the bartender topped it off to make sure i got the proper amount. smells fresh citrus hops with a nice malty presence in the background. big flavor, citrus hops again, bready malts, huge. with no annoying or off tastes. perfectly bitter and so drinkable, i could have had many more, except for the one per customer limit.
not much else to say, great beer, great bar, great experience. maybe someday the brewery will make alot more so all could try. but i wonder if it would be the same then? 1,126 charactersB33R501, Mar 01, 2012

Easily one of the best examples of beer craftsmanship one can experience. I had my first experience last night at a "hush-hush" tapping in Philadelphia. Beautiful amber/golden color with one finger of white head. Smells like you're standing amidst the growing hops in the field. I hope this is taken properly, but I compare this to a beer-mouthwash due to its crisp, fresh flavor that made my mouth and eyes tingle. The high alcohol is apparent, but is easily lost in the complexity of flavor. Easily one of the best pieces of work I've ever tasted. Can't wait for next year's batch! 617 charactersLouski, Mar 01, 2012
4.6/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Brilliant tangerine color, thin white head that has little retention, and decent lacing. 
S - I got a candied sugar smell up front, surprisingly, that was then knocked down by the huge resinous hops. The candied caramel malt was definitely one of a kind. I was just expecting more on the nose.
T - Really gets a lot better here. The hop profile really gets displayed nicely with grapefruit, some mango, then finishes super long with resinous pine notes intermixed with some floral aspects. Caramel malt provides some body, with a nice balancing sweetness as it moves across the palate, then disappears in the finish, giving way to the hops.
M - Full body, yet stays light and fluffy with the carbonation. Oily, prickly hops, finishing dry and bitter. Splendid mouthfeel.
O - Taste and mouthfeel are spectacular, and something about it just makes it incredibly smooth and easy drinking. A&S could have been better, but this whole experience was just incredible. A must have for hopheads and beer lovers. 1,010 charactersgaruda, Mar 01, 2012

4.67/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Kind of a weak appearance. Pale golden, nearly zero head and no lacing. Bizarre since it's got so much hops in it.
Piney aroma, like stepping into a forest. Some hidden malt in there.
First sip was overwhelmingly pine. Like swirling sap on the tongue. But it faded quickly, buoyed up by the malts, then backed up by some citrus, mostly grapefruit with a crisp finish. After my taste buds got used to the pine that eased up on later drinks.
Light, crisp body, no detectable alcohol in the taste, really unbelievable. You'll feel the alcohol soon enough though.
Great. Worth the hype. No need to descend into some religious exaltation over this one, but if you can get The Younger, by all means do. 700 charactersChizoad, Feb 29, 2012

Big piney hops, booze, skunky weed.
Same as nose. This is amazing. Like Blind Pig squared. Booze is present, as it should be but adds a nice tropical fruit balance to the extreme hop.
Great carbonation. Lighter in body than it should be, only adding to the drinkability. 
Yeah, this is an amazing beer. Is it worth waiting 2 hrs in line for? I refuse to wait in line for any beer, so I say no, but if I had to wait for a beer, I hope it would be as delicious. 530 charactersdbmernin83, Feb 29, 2012

Appearance is a wonderful honey gold, with a decent amount of lacing. Smell is wonderful with a prelude to the wonderful balance that this beer displays, lots of hops and malt here. Taste, well...I talked about the balance here and it is ever present here. When you think about the copious amounts of hops added this beer, you are amazed at way the sweetness just balances it all out. I felt like I was on the brink of this beer being too sweet or too bitter, but it all worked out in the end. Mouthfeel is sticky, but a wonderful feeling...not to slick and definitely easily drinkable. Overall, I can see why this is one of the most highly regarded beers out there, definitely lives up to the billing. 814 charactersnesarebad, Feb 29, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Dear Pliny,
Our reunion has been long in the making. Several years, by my count. At first, I didn’t understand what the fuss was about. I only saw the long lines of beer geeks jockeying for a taste of you, and assumed, wrongly, that young(er) and old (er, elder) were one and the same… and, being in the bay, I could get the Elder at enough places to take it for granted as well.
The first time we met I felt the hype… it was a late night, and I had enough to drink by then… I’m sorry our first time wasn’t as memorable as it could have been. 
Now that I’ve been away and had time to grow, however, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate your tasty goodness. You look great in your Russian River glass, with your burnt yellow hue and that billowy white cloud sitting atop your pour. You smell great too, did I mention? Hops compliment you, and that blend of light citrus and pine, lemon peel and orange zest, with a sweet floral scent tying it all together. If it is true what they say about our sense of taste being depending upon our sense of smell then this might be enough of a paean to you. … But from the first sip on I am continually amazed. How do you do it? What is your secret to being so bold, so bitter—yet so light and drinkable? I get the hops immediately, that piney citrusy blend that you’re so fond of that’s like fresh grapefruit and chewy sap, but you’re deceptively bitter when you could be bracingly so. That finish is at once gentle yet commanding, like a whisper that crescendos into a auditorium-filling symphony. I still can’t believe you’re 12%--you certainly don’t show it at all.
I’m glad we could spend this time getting reacquainted, and I look forward to visiting you again in another year. Don’t be a stranger.
Sincerely, 
My 400th review. 1,812 characterselNopalero, Feb 28, 2012

Seems like a down year. Love the mouthfeel and drinkability for a IIIPA. But lacking a bit in the aroma this time.
2012 review:
4/4.5/4.5/5/5
At Belmont Station, side-by-side with Elder.
A: Copper, good clarity. Small, but persistent, head
S: Intense piney hops, forest floor earthiness, and something else a little funky in there, maybe a whisper of diaper. Except in a good way? Having a hard time describing it.
T: Huge hops flavor, but not overwhelming bitterness. A somewhat peculiar and almost artificial sweetness gives it backbone.
M: Long finish, slightly drying. Medium-low carbonation, enough to keep it quite drinkable
O: Okay, Younger you win. I take back everything I've said in the past about you not actually being as good as Elder. Maybe my tastes have changed, but I'm enjoying a bit more sweetness and malt-body in my IIPAs these days. Best beer ever, I don't know. But I sure wouldn't have minded having another. 955 characterskscaldef, Feb 28, 2012

4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I am sure many of you have already tried the Elder and may be curious about how the Younger compares to it. My review will focuse on addressing this particular topic. Overall, the Elder and the Younger are both excellent (as you would have guessed!). I wouldn't wait in line for hours just to try the Younger, but it was definitely worth my 30+ minutes at a local joint. 
To be really honest with you though, the difference between the Younger and the Elder wasn't as much as I had anticipated (after reading numerous reviews on how crazy the Younger is). 
The local joint that held the event tapped both the Younger and the Elder. I had the chance to taste both of them side by side. Both beers were served a bit colder than they should have been, so I got to try both at colder temperature and warmer temperature as time passed. I can tell that the Younger seems a bit sweeter, more peachy, and bitterer, but not by a huge margin. 
They look almost identical to each other. I think the Younger might have been even slightly lighter in color, but it could have been the glass (for some reason, the Elder was served in a pint glass and the Younger was served in a tulip). Both had almost no head. 
What's impressive though is that the extra 2.5% alcohol content in the Younger was not detectible much (it's a bit odd that this site is listing the Younger @ 11% - it was described to me at the event as 10.5% ABV). I didn't feel much alcohol burn. 
I personally do not agree with some of the reviewers below indicating that the Younger is the Elder on steroid or the Elder times 2, but it sure is a subtlely enhanced version of the Elder with more alochol, sugar, hops, and I gotta say more peach. 
Everyone seemed to have enjoyed the beer and most of them appeared to have already tried the Younger before. I am not sure if I will go out of my way to seek the Younger in the near future (given they are quite similar), but it was definitely a fun event, talking to folks who were also there and excited to try the same beer. 2,030 characterssukwonee, Feb 28, 2012

Dank hop with fruity notes, tropical fruit that meets pine/earthy and grapefruit. Just a huge aroma that is complex and covers the hop spectrum. 
Taste is tropical fruit up front that fades into a big fruit middle--BIG, oily hops with notes of malt honey and sweetness. Really balanced yet bitter. The oily hop finish lasts and lasts. Perfect hop taste. Like drinking hop juice. 
Medium to heavy body with medium carbonation, extremely smooth.

Pours a clear golden body. Good head that gives a nice lace to the brew. 
Very piny in the aroma. A bit larger sweet grapefruit than with the elder, but not much. Slight biscuity malt.
Resiny pine flavor very prevalent. A touch of spiceyness and sweetness from the malt help finish off this well rounded beer. The grapefruit is a little more pungent in this version than the elder.

O - as i sipped this i had mixed emotions. on one hand i was not blown away. admittedly this is not my favorite style. i thought it was just a little too much(in all ways). on the other hand i think it was a perfect execution of what they wanted when they wrote the recipe and i don't see any flaws. if you like the over-the-top hoppy bitterness then this could be the holy grail for you. i feel lucky to have gotten to try it. hopefully i will have another chance again one day. 1,109 characterscwguy5, Feb 26, 2012

Pours a golden amber with a small white head leaving a ridiculous amount of lacing on the glass for the alcohol content. Aroma is ridiculous with resinous pine hops, loads of floral hops, and hints of pineapple and grapefruit. Barely any malt coming through in the aroma.

Pours a clear glowing golden orange with a white head, some sticky lacing.
Aroma is dank and sticky resinous pine and citrus. Smells much like the Elder, only more intense and concentrated. Really does smell like what I imagine hop extract might smell like.
Taste follows nose: sticky chewy hop resin, pine & grapefruit rind mostly. Clean pale malt and almost no taste of alcohol in this 12% beast. Medium-bodied, balanced mouthfeel.
Overall, like the Elder, this is a well-balanced DIPA especially considering its 12% ABV. Perhaps a little more sharply bitter and tongue-scouring than I prefer, but still very enjoyable, and the boozy heat makes its presence known soon enough.
And at the end of the day that might be what sets this unique beer apart - it masks its alcohol so completely. Here we have an IPA that tastes like an IPA, with an ABV of a barleywine or strong ale. No small brewing achievement I'm sure. 1,129 charactersdraheim, Feb 22, 2012

4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed 3 tulips of the 2012 Younger at Monks Kettle in San Francisco (and a couple at Russian River in Santa Rosa).
Appearance: Finally, a DIPA that is actually pale! Not orange, not red. I'd guess 8 srm, almost the same color as the Elder.
Smell: Resinous, pine, cat pee, tangerine, peach. Enormous. The freshest hop aroma I've ever experienced. No malt character detected.
Taste: Echoing the aroma with massive fruitiness and a potent overarching bitterness. Pine lingers in the mouth long after swallowing. A very distinct smoothness similar to Elder, signature Russian River.
Mouthfeel: Chewy & sexy. The use of sugars really helps to keep this drinkable, it never feels bogged down by malt. Keep DIPA's pale!
Believe the hype, DIPA doesn't get any better than this. I think the exclusivity of Younger really helps to promote the importance of FRESHNESS in this style. Even after a short time in bottles, a beer like this will lose some of it's magic. Get it on tap in Santa Rosa. 990 charactersmattsander, Feb 21, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a draft into what appeared to be about a 10-oz. skinny glass at San Diego Brewing Co. in San Diego, Calif., on Feb. 14. Not sure the name of it. Color was honey caramel with a nice gray lacing that stayed for about five minutes. Just a tad bit of film on the sides, which was a bit surprising. 
Just a fantastic balance of hops on the initial smell. Smelled citrus pine hops and sweet floral notes as well. Also some grapefruit.
Tasted even better than the nose. Obviously citrus hops, but so damn smooth and balanced. Like the nose, the balance was citrus pine hops and sweet floral notes. For how strong it was, the alcohol never came through like so.
Medium body. Not sure the texture, but definitely good. Average carbonation. Long smooth finish. 
This beer lived up to the hype as hard as it was to do that. The biggest surprise was how easy it went down. Unbelievable. 890 charactersBucannonXC5, Feb 21, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:
Vibrant chrysanthemum yellow. Crystal clear. Medium white fine head that dissipated quickly. 
Aroma:
It was served cold. First aroma was sweet - not malty sweet, cleanly floral sweet - with crisp herbal notes. A 12 oz pour allowed time to warm slightly, aroma and flavor opened up. Hints of desert sage and green peppercorn, clean tangerine sorbet like aroma in the backbone, and a echo of juniper. 
Taste:
Malt is very clean and crisp, the residual sweetness is more like blonde candi syrup than malts. Hardly any yeast esters, no fruitiness unlike typical ale yeast. The bittering is low, but the hop presence is huge - clean, bright, peppery, and crisply herbal. Alcohol presence is remarkably clean, more like a good gin than the boozy or hot character in most big DIPAs. 
Mouthfeel:
Medium body, slightly dry. Finish is very long, hoppy, and carries the crispness of hop oils. 
Overall Impression:
I see many pours of PTY are about 5 ounces - and I don't think that's enough to get the full impression. At first I was a little underwhelmed. But after about 4 sips and 1/3 through the glass it really picked up. When it warmed just slightly and opened up it really started to shine. As it warmed and opened it remained clean, crisp, and invigorating across the board. The alcohol was not boozy or hot, but clean almost like a white spirit. The malt was clean and very slightly sweet, balancing the hugely floral and herbal hops very well. Altogether, fantastic. 
A 4 hour wait in line for one pour is a bit of a buzzkill, yet I'm glad I did it. However, I don't think I'll do it again. It's worth doing at least once. 1,638 charactersdfernandez77, Feb 20, 2012

A-Lively carbonation with a ring of white foam. A little bit of haze in this orange/golden colored hop bomb.
S-Tons of hops, apricot and bittering pummel the olfactory faculties.
T-Lots of hop but also lots of pale malt and a touch of honey. Obviously hop forward but surprising not overpoweringly so.
M-Full bodied, more so than Hopslam as a comparison. This one hangs on but not overly bitter. Alcohol is beautifully covered up.
D-Not meant for the long run. Goes really well with the spicy cheddar and jalapeno beer bites at RR.
O-A really solid beer. I guess I can understand why people wait in line for a few hours for a taste. Lots of everything in this beer-hops obviously are the star of the show, but full bodied with plenty of malty goodness. I prefer this one to the elder, has more malt and sweetness to better balance the hops and doesn't leave you feeling like you just sucked on a pine tree. 1,062 charactersdeebo, Feb 20, 2012
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It seems that Pliny the Younger comes and goes quicker with each passing year. The beer has been much sought over since being named the Best Beer in America a few years ago. A line formed at 8am at Oskar Blues Homemade Liquid & Solids yesterday for the tapping at 1pm, and easily sold out to the lucky 50 folks that grabbed a ticket. We were among the lucky few, and always are in appreciation of the GREAT hospitality, service, and friendliness of the GREAT folks at Liquid & Solids!
Pliny the Younger pours a very light and crisp golden color, with some amber hues noticeable near the edges. A tiny wisp of white head quickly dissipates, although a clingy lace is present throughout. A rich and powerful bouquet of citrus and piney hop aromas, as well as some grass, become more pronounced as the beer warms, and a certain sweetness encourages you to take that first sip. A wallop of hops hits the pallet immediately, but is very smooth and well-balanced. Grapefruit and other citrusy rinds come to mind, with that sweetness for the nose providing an exceptionally smooth balance, really where the Younger shines through. The body and carbonation are both relatively low, really letting the hoppy gloriness shine through in the 10.75% ABV masterpiece. Russian River is possibly the best brewery in the US right now, with the artfulness of their use of the magical hop and amazing lineup of sour beers. Get this one if you can! 1,429 charactersphishsihq, Feb 19, 2012

A: Younger pours a golden orange color with a thin head of creamy white foam. Strong lacing clings to the sides of the glass throughout. 
S: The beer has a strong aroma of citrus hops, pine and a small bit of cat urine. Slight bit of caramel malt present, but alcohol is not noticeable in the nose.
T: The initial taste is very fruity citrus hops: grapefruit, orange rind and just a bit of apricot. It's almost like Pliny the Elder turned up to 11. This initial fruit flavor explosion melds into a bit of bitter pine hops and some nice sweet malt. Extremely well-balanced.
M: The beer has a medium mouthful with average carbonation for an IPA. As I stated when discussing the aroma, the alcohol is incredibly well-masked. Unlike 120 Minute IPA, you don't taste the booziness. There is no lingering ethanol here. This beer is so well-balanced that it's hard to pace yourself. 
O: Yes, there is hype surrounding this beer. However, it's still a damn good beer. I honestly think it's a slightly more extreme version of Elder flavor and aroma-wise. I don't think it's worth five hours of your life standing in line, but it's still an incredible beer that everyone should try once or twice. 1,257 charactersdistantmantra, Feb 19, 2012

App- No head whatsoever. Color is a nearly transparent gold. Other than the lack of head it was an attractive beer
Sm- Full citrus aroma. Fresh and clean, pleasant but not too heavy hop fragrance.
T- Well balanced hops, citrus, some bitterness and orange peel.Very little sense of the alcohol content. Bitter aftertaste but a good finish overall. 
Mf- Smooth, but little sense of any carbonation, seemed a bit thin on the finish. Flavor was appealing. 
Ov- A good beer. Not sure if it's worth all the hype. My mates were a bit dissapointed as well but it's still a good beer. Enjoyed the experience and the atmosphere. I would try it again if I could find it, but probaably won't make the 2000 mile trek again. Fortunately ties it into a business trip
I was a little sketchy of the hype and while it's not the best beer in the world by any means, it's still good and the experience and atmosphere was great, a lot of great beer talk at Russian River.

Appearance; pours a gorgeous, crisp clear golden color, head non-existent but that could be due to the line and be fact that they are preparing the beers in advance... The gold color of this beer is perfect, as if Younger knows it's the #1 beer in the world... 
Smell; grapefruit, orange rinds, citrus in general... Not as heavy on the tropical fruit as Pliny the Elder.. 
Taste; exceptionally smooth, launches right into grapefruit and citrus rinds.. Quite bitter on the finish, moreso than Elder, but certainly not comically so... Good resins and a nice bitter finish. Hides 11% exceptionally well... Smooth and no hints of alcohol or alcohol burn.
Mouthfeel; this is where younger exceeds... Perfect amount of carbonation, but you can definitely sink your teeth into this one... On the lighter side of full bodied... Bitterness plays into the finish beautifully...
Overall; a great beer, and certainly one that I am glad to have experienced, although I don't know that it was worth $1/ounce and a 45 minute wait... I can easily get Pliny the Elder and I feel like Elder is every bit as solid of a beer, and given the price and accessibility is even more enjoyable although I certainly had a great ... I feel like Younger is a great beer, but I am certainly spoiled by the availability of Elder in my area... The experience is awesome, definitely glad i tried it, had some amazing times with friends in line however I don't know I'd endure the madness to try this again... 1,583 charactersThingus, Feb 19, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured on-tap at Russian River Brewpub - Santa Rosa, CA...
Appearance: Thin to no head in this 10oz glass. Color is a deep golden just barely capable of being considered translucent. A film of alcohol coats the glass when tilted side to side. Sticky, sticky, sticky is this one.
Smell/Taste: Pliny the Younger packs a PUNCH! in both respects! Lupulin hops come through to the nose with intense vigor letting you prepare for the intensity of the hops within this moderate portion. Citrus, fresh cut grass, and pine blast through. First taste packs a pucker of a hop kick as if to expect a harsh and unsettling finish but this is where Younger proves it's glory and shows you that the finish is surreallyyy smooth!! No compromise whatsoever! Alcohol comes in for a brief moment at the finish but only momentarily at almost 11% ABV.
Mouthfeel: It will definitely take over your palate - so be ready. I know it's Younger and you may worry about it disappearing quickly but maybe grab a brew or two prior just to savor the plethora of goodness on-tap at this location. Full hop body overwhelms the taste buds with the most intensely delicious hop aroma one can possibly imagine - finishing on a level of smooth which can be claimed as easily unparalleled.
Overall: This brewpub is an A++ and this beer stands true to it's reverence. Hop heads rejoice for the beauty that is the Elder's son. Be prepared to have "smooth" redefined! 1,429 charactersForb, Feb 19, 2012

Poured a pale golden color, similar to Pliny the Elder with a nice thick head that laces well. Great clarity. Aroma is super piney with citrus notes. Not very floral. Tons of hop oil, but it's not too overwhelming. This beer is most definitely about the hops and it's not afraid to say so. Taste is nothing but hop bitterness at first and a bit of fresh hop oil. Then sweetness comes in to balance things out. The malt is sweet, but not sickly sweet. I got lots of honey biscuit flavor. This is surprisingly well balanced considering the amount of alcohol, malt, and hops that went into it. I could drink this all day.
Wow, this is one beer that lived up to the hype. I'm obviously a huge fan of PtE, so it should come as no surprise that I love PtY as well. But it did come as a surprise, because of all the hype. Even if you didn't know anything about the hype, the scarcity alone would have hyped this beer a little. It's inherent. I was hoping for more of a floral/nectar aroma, but the balance of this beer makes me not care much. This is definitely the best TIPA I've had so far. While I could drink an IPA every day of the week, I don't think I could drink this most days. It's a special beer. And at 11%, it should be treated as such. 1,298 charactersPhilousa, Feb 18, 2012

Pours a deep gold, almost amber color that has a nice glow and a finger of white bubbly head with oily lacing.
Smell is dominated by piney and citrusy scents of lemon zest, grapefruit, pineapple and a good bit more dank hops than Elder, with less prominent floral aromas. Alcohol is present but not nearly what ABV would suggest.
First taste is an explosion of pine, earth and spicy hops, followed by lemon, orange, grapefruit, crisp apple, pineapple and salmonberries. Malt imparts only a bit of sweetness. Finishes quite dank and resiny, less floral than expected. ABV is well hidden but noticable. Bitterness builds slowly until the tongue is destroyed but it keeps you coming back for more.
Mouthfeel is probably my favorite part. Nice full body similar to Hopslam but the alcohol gives just enough heat to back up the huge flavors. Finish is semi-dry, a bit slick with just enough sweetness.
It's hard to keep an open mind when trying the most highly hyped beer after spending 45 mins in line to get it, but it really delivers in different ways than I expected. Incredibly drinkable for its bitterness level and ABV. Hard to imagine a hoppy beer getting much better. 1,286 charactersafrokaze, Feb 17, 2012

Appearance: Bright, translucent gold color with small white head. 
Smell: Citrus hops jumped out of the glass with a sense of freshness that had me ready for my first taste of this elusive beer. No alcohol detected by my nose.
Taste: As expected, citrus hops jumped at me on the front end, with a bigger hop profile than the Elder and intense grapefruit/orange flavor. Despite the hop dominance, this mellowed rather quickly for me due to its superb balance. Finished crisp, dry, and left some bitterness on my tongue that wasn't puckering.
Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel that had appropriate carbonation for this style. The thing that sticks out to me is how well the alcohol is masked. It's drinkability had me wanting to pick the glass up right after I had set it down after each sip. Really had to pace myself and savor it. 
Overall: While there is always going to be some degree of "hype" associated with something that is brewed once a year with extremely limited distribution, this beer does not disappoint. This is a special concoction that is worth getting a taste of, especially if you are an IPA lover. 1,262 charactersmfavoino, Feb 17, 2012

A- Presented with a thin white head sitting on top of a bright semi-transparent gold body. Surprised that it is lighter than Elder.
S- Nice dank hop aroma with notes of pine and citrus. Not as big as I was expecting.
T- Big astringent hops profiling pine and grapefruit up front. Perfect amount of malt balances it out nicely, leaving a big bitter bite at the end. This is quite a palette wrecker. Little alcohol presence, especially one this big.
M- Medium to full body. More carbonation than expected, but this left a nice creamy mouthfeel. 
O- This beer has eluded me the last couple of years. I was able to do a side-by-side with the Elder and it was amazing how Younger decimated my palette to the point the Elder did not have much hop presence at the time. Quite an amazing beer and on the house to boot. 950 charactersbstave, Feb 17, 2012

A: Pours no real head - but with a floater. Colour is a nontransparent gold. I'm disappointed by the lack of a head; you could blame the glassware, but the brewery chose it. It's vibrant and appealing, however. 
Sm: A citrusy hop aroma. Quite powerful and fresh. Clean and inviting. Floral hops. Pine. Juicy citrus; grapefruit. Refreshing and appealing. 
T: Hoppy, but delightfully well balanced with a citrusy body and relaxed mellow balancing climax. I really like it. Layered and complex for an IPA - surprisingly so. Some hop bitterness comes through in the aftertaste. Crisp and fresh. Pleasant. No alcohol comes through. Quite subtle. Really refreshing. Would pair well with food. Supple. Quite enjoyable. Orange peel comes through, maybe citra hops as well. The structure is nice, with a subtle body, unobtrusive open, and nice finish. 
Mf: Smooth and wet. Just the right thickness, until the finish, wherein it's a touch too thin. Suits the refreshing feel of the flavours quite well, but not perfectly. A touch sharp on the finish. 
Dr: Delightful. Well priced for the high quality, but evidently difficult to acquire. Very refreshing and enjoyable. Best served fresh - of course. I'd definitely have it again if I could find it. I'm shocked as how well it conceals its ABV. Certainly amongst the best IPAs I've ever had (not to mention imperial IPAs). The only IPA that comes to mind immediately that compares is Sculpin. 
I was skeptical of the hype, but while it's not a perfect beer - nor the best beer in the world - by any means, it's a great beer worthy of any beer fanatic's time. Well brewed, Russian River.

Poured a brilliant yellow-gold with just a slick of bright white head. Great blast of hops in the aroma; pine and citrus dominate with subtler floral and tropical fruit notes in there too.
Moderate carbonation and a oily, smooth, and full mouthfeel. My mouth did a double-take at first because I thought it was so similar to Pliny the Elder, but with a little time the pine and grapefruit hops opened up to reveal more tropical fruit and an emerging honey-caramel warmth on the tail end.
Couldn't believe this was 11%; tasted like a Pliny the Elder with more hops, more malt, and not a drop more alcohol. Great mix of hops that kept things bitter without being puckering, and a good dose of malt that didn't become too cloying.
Didn't seem absurdly hoppy at the time, but when I got home and went to munch on something else I realized how much it had overwhelmed my palate. While drinking it, though, things were in total balance -- what a great beer. 1,048 charactersgrittybrews, Feb 17, 2012

A- Pours a clear golden color with a thin white head. Head dissipates quickly. Minimal amounts of lacing.
S- Glorious amounts of citrus, grapefruit, apricot, pine and floral hops. This beer really brings the hops for sure. I don't detect any malt presence. 
T- Apricot, citrus and slight pine flavors become immediately recognizable. It's followed by some resinous and hop oils. Not much going on as far as malts go. So it's basically hops followed by more hops. This one is bitter from start to finish. 
M- Medium-full body with a good amount of carbonation. Very dry finish. The alcohol does leave a warming feel on the palate. An odd syrupy feel to it that I'm not used to in an IPA/DIPA. Very drinkable for 11% abv.
O- Pretty damn good beer. While I do think this beer is hyped up too much, it's still well worth seeking out if you can. As a side note, I'm probably in the minority here but I think I enjoy Elder better than Younger. Elder has a little more balance to it. Regardless, get yourself some Younger if you have never had the opportunity to try it. 1,120 charactersMahlik, Feb 16, 2012

Served in 10 ounce tulips.
A clear, golden hue, small but thick head that hung around but didn't stick to the sides.
Sweet, hoppy smell. Maybe a hint of golden raisin, although fleeting. Hops are there but not overpowering, enough to temper the light sweetness.
A lovely flavor, filled with the hops I want in an IPA but without any strong bitterness. Very smooth in the moth and goes down really well. I had to be careful to take my time because it just wants to slide down your throat and you can't wait for the next mouthful.
I wouldn't even know they were so strong except for how two makes you feel. And I felt great. 705 charactersmisterscooter, Feb 16, 2012

S: It smelled bitter but was a little more muted considered they claimed to have dry hopped it 5 times. However the high alcohol could be keeping some of the aromas in solution.
T: AWESOME. I did a comparison with Pliny the Elder and the Elder tasted bland in comparison. The IBUs on Pliny the Younger must be over 150 yet there is still perfect balance within the beer with caramel, citrus, and pine.
M: Perfect retention and carbonation.
O: Even if you live in Alaska, the trip to Russian River in February is worth it if you are a beer enthusiast. I will be making the trip every year despite the fact I will be moving out of the area in a couple of months. 745 charactersjvillefan, Feb 15, 2012

-the smell is really nice right off the bat. big time hop nose including pine and citrus. the bummer though is this great smell doesn't really last throughout the enjoyment of the entire beverage
-man, this year's batch is pretty killer. huge hop flavor at the beginning, but it doesn't make your mouth and throat bleed hop resin like some 10-12% IPAs. pine and orange are the big players involved with a nice malt round-out. i like that it isn't overly bitter either, yet it leaves your mouth tasting like hops for a good while
-just the right amount of big body on this one, not to mention the right amount of stickiness. i also enjoy the carb level
-this is the most drinkable Younger i can remember from the past 3 vintages. it is really scary how smooth and easy drinking it is. the sun on your neck sitting outside really ups the experience too 967 charactersjuhl31, Feb 15, 2012

Enjoyed on tap at the brewery on 2/11/12.
A: Pours a clear light orange color with light bubble streams rising to the top. There is no head visible, but the glass was filled to the top. A small white ring clings to the sides.
S: It has an orgasmic hop profile. This includes pine, resin, and slight tropical fruits of mangoes, pineapple and peaches.
T: The taste is almost an exact replica of the aroma with the tropical fruits making a stronger appearance. Definitely one oc the best tasting IPAs out there.
M: It is medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation that allows the flavors to dance across the palate. A nice, crisp, bitter finish creates a very refreshing feel.
O: This was really a treat. No wonder this is considered one of the best beers out there right now. I'll definitely be back next year. 843 charactersBilbosNuts, Feb 15, 2012

A- very clear golden orange, very similar the elder but a little more on the orange side. Nice white head.
S- Really astringent hops, big everything. Tropical fruits, grapefruit, sweet orange, pine, some actual bitterness and a sweet caramel. 
T- Big citrus notes with a ton of bitterness but not in a sharp way it is just there. Not nearly as sweet as the smell which surprised me. No alcohol to be found but there is a slight warmth in the back of your throat. Citrus lingers slightly but has a very dry finish.
M- Pretty standard here, the exact medium light feel a refreshing double should have. 
O- I was really really excited to try this but I have to say i'm not really sure if this holds up to the hype, for me anyhow. I think I was still expecting something a little different I guess but this is for sure an awesome A+ beer with insane drink ability. Also didn't have to wait in any kind of line or by a ticket (it wasn't even that busy really) which was a big plus. 1,005 charactersd4114, Feb 14, 2012
4.94/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at falling rock taphouse.
Appearance is a clear golden orange with good carbonation but surprisingly very little head. No sign of what's to come.
Smell is wonderful! Hops, with lots of hops and more hops. Scents ranging from tropical fruit to huge pine aromas some grassy hops.
Taste just keeps getting better. At first it opens with a fairly soft balanced sweet maltiness. As the glass warms however the hops emerge and the flavor gains miles of depth. Sweet malts play with the tropical fruit and resinous piney hops to create a wonderfully balanced composition. No trace of alcohol.
Mouthfeel at first fairly thin but after a few drinks i noticed that the mouthfeel changed and thickened. After about half of the glass I ran my tounge across my teeth and inside my mouth and found that the inside of my mouth was coated with resinous oils from hops.
Overall, aside from the head (which i suspect is the bar trying to prevent any waste by overflow) this is a perfect beer. Easily the best I've ever had. Well worth the travel and expense. 1,052 characterscrazyjoedivola, Feb 13, 2012

Appearance: Crystal clear honey-orange body with an extremely tiny white foam head. Some moderate to low lacing, no retention really, either.
Smell: Monstrous hop aroma, with big pine notes accompanied by grapefruit, orange, and a little apricot. Bright, vibrant, and exceptional. Smells great, a lot like elder with a fuller smell.
Taste: Hops, hops, hops! Bitterness is pretty big, but balanced and met with a strong malt backbone, only to be swept away with more hoppiness. Citrus, grassy hops both take turns attacking the tongue, but are always smooth and balanced. I cannot believe how well this beer fuses together. 
Mouthfeel: The feel is somewhat sticky, and resinous with hops. Incredibly smooth, very surprising. No sign of the apparent 11% ABV. I didn't think that such a hopped-up beer could be so drinkable and balanced.
Overall: This is an absolutely amazing beer. Pliny the Younger is indeed an excellent TIPA. Hype is huge on this and while it is very solid, IMHO there are other beers out there that are comparable. Glad I finally got to try this and am now satisfied. 1,120 charactersSoCalStout, Feb 13, 2012

T Holy smokes! This beer is decadent! The hops and the malt are strong, but marry so well together. It all just comes together beautifully. Alcohol is hidden so well. 
M Medium body, crisp with a gentle bitterness lingering.

A - Poured a very pale clear gold with no head and lots of bubbles.
S - Citrus and pine
T - I did not find this beer to be nearly as hoppy as I was hoping it would be. It was a pleasant taste, definitely nothing to complain about, but nothing stood out as special about this beer. A standard piney bitterness but very little residual hop flavor.
M - Very nice, almost champagne-like mouthfeel.
O - I am glad to that I got to try it, but I would not make any effort to have it again. It is by no means a bad beer, but I don't think I would have thought twice about it if I had not heard so much about it prior to drinking this. It's true that this beer "doesn't taste like it is 11%", but in my book that is not necessarily good. I found it to be lacking in both malt and hops flavor. 879 charactersrustycentipede, Feb 12, 2012

On tap. 10oz glass
A: Clear amber, thin head that leaves little/no lacing on the sides.
S: Decent amount of citrus, very reminiscent of PtE. Little bit of pine. 
T: Grapefruit malty front end giving way to a brutally fantastic hop that sticks in your mouth. Medium body that made you feel you were drinking something substantial, and again that lingering sweet flavor that bows out to reveal a great hop backbone. 
O: I found myself admiring the beer and thinking about it the more I drank it. The contrast with PtE was surprising and it's easy to see why this pulls out ahead as the superior IPA, since the hop profile is more aggressive. Absolutely astounding. 779 charactersxdopiex, Feb 12, 2012

Had this on tap at Higgins as well. Never had it before, but wanted to try it in its freshest form possible (in Oregon) and Higgins was the first to tap it. I have had PtE from kegs, as well as fresh bottles, and the fresh version is almost a different beer to me. My friend had PtY from a keg that was stored for a few months and said the fresh version was infinitely better as well...thus my desire to try it as soon as it hit town.
First off, I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Not that I thought it wouldnt be good (of course it would be!), but that it wouldnt measure up to the hype. Even with that in mind, this is the best beer I have ever had. The smell alone was amazing. Citrusy, grapefruit, a little funk, and almost tropical. Only fresh PtE compares in initial smell.
First taste did its aroma justice. Hard to believe this is an IPA. Little-to-no bitterness, a touch of citrusy sweetness but not the kind of sweetness that can come with other high alcohol beer. Finishes sooo clean and leaves no hint of alcohol on the tongue. The hop resin and pine aroma comes through but blends in perfectly. I could have drank 10 of these.
The appearance was golden with a head of about 1/4 inch that held on through the first couple sips. 
Overall I was very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed this beer. The great part was that there was no line, no commotion, and no BS auction system. Just a moderately full bar of people enjoying a truly great beer. My friend that was with me mentioned how much better this fresh version was compared to some he had a a festival that had been sitting in a keg for 3 months. I would reccomend that if you plan on trying this beer that you get it as soon as it comes out. 1,752 charactersderftron, Feb 10, 2012

 This is a difficult review, I loved the beer, nice clarity, small head, outstanding aroma. I could taste the booze, drying on the tongue. well balanced otherwise.Is it a perfect beer? Well yes, but just a few miles south at Lagunitas is something that might put a magnifying lens on that declaration. I had the happy experience of going to Lagunitas and drinking the Holiday leftovers before getting in line for the Younger.
 Don't do this if you want to taste the hype, four of us made the trip and it was unanimous. Younger is very very good. Sucks is in a class all it's own. 602 charactersmudbug, Feb 10, 2012

Beautiful clear gold with thin white head. Lacing on glass even after the head is gone. Looks like a cidre in the light. Some amber around the corners and deeper parts of the glass.
Sweet, wet hop aroma, resin, honey, and a whiff of Feet/B.O. just to round it out. Like pine needles soaked in rich honey. 
Hmmm. Softer than I imagined. Sweet, syrupy hops. (Extract?). Hints of mango. No noticeable malt character. Very hot on the end but booze isn't a major part of the flavor profile. grapefruit. Piney, bitter ending. It's an exercise in hop love without notions of malt "balance". Somehow, it still works. 
Almost cloying sweetness, but a very firm light body. Doesn't feel huge in my mouth. (that's what she said.) Hot. Prickly carbonation.
With the hype surrounding this beer, I have to say I expected more. That said, it is a unique and immersive taste experience. It doesn't taste like anything I've had before, but it still wouldn't crack my top 20. Definitely wouldn't kick it out of bed. Bucket List: check. 1,167 charactersGobigvt7, Feb 09, 2012

Nose is fresh pine, but not the pungent bitter pine expected. Sticky resinous character in the nose, primarily alongside the sweet caramel smell. Citrus notes, grapefruit and lemon, some melon. Taste is much the same, instantly bitter upfront but unarguably fleeting in character. Bitterness subsides to resinous pine, almost like young pine bud. Caramel sweetness coats the mouth while the alcohol warmness becomes apparent. What a fantastic balance of strong piney hop flavors with the sweet alcohol layer. Carbonation is moderate, the amount is juuuust right. Slightly astringent. But ever so slight it is. Mouthfeel is sticky and a tad dry. Overall, lives up to the hype as a very, very good triple ipa. Excellent proportions of piney hop abundance and sweet malty layers. 889 charactersSDDanC, Feb 08, 2012

Appearance: Golden honey amber color. Younger is glowing in the glass. It's slightly. Not much a head though my wife's glass did have a thin creamy head that laced up the glass with it's sticky residue.
Smell:The aroma is a resiny dank hop opera. It is big and bold in all the right ways. This ale smells so fresh. I pick up big lemony citrus and peach.
Taste: The taste is immediately bitter but this bitterness isn't cloying at all. It's smooth, menthol-like and refreshing. The bitterness vanishes in a subtle way. The tropical fruit flavors linger on my tongue. Bright grapefruit. Slight grassy notes in the secondary. I can't taste the alcohol. Amazingly played Russian River.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is smooth,resfreshing and creamy. Full flavored but light and drinkable. This is a real bold ale.
Overall: Pliny the Younger taste terrific. The balance between a high ABV and ridiculous bitterness is managed perfectly. The price is good at $4.50 for a 10 oz. snifter and the wait wasn't even long. A must drink ale for any northern, CA hophead.

Pours a golden yellow straw colored body, with a 1 finger white head. Lacing is outstanding and head retention is good.
Smell is of intense pine, resinous marijuana, tropical fruits like pineapple and mango. Also some sweet malts and for 11 percent no alcohol was detected. A year later I can still remember the amazing aroma that filled the somewhat small bar as dozens of glasses of Younger were simultaneously poured.
Taste is complex, full on hops though. First there's resinous floral weed, then pineapple and citrus juice, followed by bitter lime and ending with sweet malts and faint booze.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Head was present for abit and had some substance. 
Drinkability is very good. Went through glass fast, this is a hop heads wet dream. Just enough malt and booze to counter the bitterness. One of the best hop forward beers made, just wish it wasnt such a hassle to get, looking forward to trying some soon 1,016 charactersangelmonster, Feb 08, 2012

On tap at Russian River, poured into a 10 oz nonic pint glass. 2012 release.
 Amber colored with some haze that disappears with temperature, and an off-white head with good retention and great lacing. Looks and feels very sticky and sugary, but taste is a different story. Aroma is sweet tropical fruit, with some sweetness lent by alcohol.
 Taste fruity but very restrained in its sweetness, with a tropical profile and high bitterness, especially towards the end. Very clean for its huge body, mostly because of its hoppiness. A long and very bittering (pleasantly so) finish. Smooth and silky, clean but not crisp, with the alcohol very well masked. Very good, if not the most aggressive DIPA.

4.94/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Beautiful golden amber color. Clarity is spot on. Nice action from the carbonation in a thin stream. Can't comment on the head unfortunately because of the near full pour (thanks!) but there's ton of sticky lacing.
S: Tons of inviting citrus is jumping out of the glass. Malt is present, more so than PtE. Lots of caramel and fairly dank.
T: Huge, bright citrus. It's so floral it's amazing. It practically perfectly rolls into the rich caramel malts. Lots of sweetness from the malts turns into a really even bitterness. As balanced as PtE is, this beer is bigger in every way... but still perfectly balanced. 
M: Great carbonation that is needed for this huge hop/malt bomb. Very slick and astringent.
O: Another amazing beer from RR that took a very careful artists touch. When you're dealing with this much hops and malts you can swing in either direction so easily. Albeit I'm not going to compare it with PtE because they're different beasts. This is much more of a sipper. It's hands down the best 9-11% DIPA I've ever had. It's decadent in a way I've only described Russian Imperial Stouts before. Well worth the praise it receives but maybe not the 4 hour wait it took to be served on the release day! 1,217 characterstony223366, Feb 07, 2012

It pours a beautiful copper color, surprisingly crystal clear but no bubbles to be seen. There is a TINY head that lasts for about 2 seconds but does leave a stark white ring of film around the circumference of the glass, and a tiny soapy layer on top of the beer. The aroma is incredible, big citrus notes, notably grapefruit and bitter lemon rind, some tropical fruits like pineapple add sweetness, while some mango-like fruit adds some bitterness. A nice earthy element is there too, strong resinous pine that adds some nice depth of flavor, but adds to the considerable bitterness. The flavors are tremendous, juicy citrus and pineapple, mangos and papaya flavors lead into the bitter elements, where the strong sappy pine flavors take over with some light grassy notes at the end. The malt is almost non existant although some caramel flavors from the high alcohol come through. Alcohol is only a faint afterthought to the big bold citrus which is quite remarkable, the finish is super smooth, dry to the bone and the grassy flavors really bring out that bitterness, the one downside is that it is a palate destroyer. The beer is so bitter it really makes it a challenge to get a full grasp on the flavor or all subsequent food or drink, best saved for last.
Verdict: A triumph. This beer pushes the limits of what an IPA can be without losing any of the integrity and core of a west coats IPA. The flavors are great, the bitterness is perfect, and the body is exceptional. Try it all costs, even if you have to wait over 4 hours in line like I did. 1,600 characterskevanb, Feb 07, 2012

A - looks like any good imperial IPA with thick copper hues.
S - extremely pungent. I could smell this beer while it was still sitting on the bar. Dense citrus / hops smell sparks your interest immediately.
T - hop and citrus overload, but in a good way. The bitterness, alcohol, and hop/citrus flavors have been utilized to the utmost extreme, and are perfectly balanced. 
M - above average for an imperial IPA, it's one that you like to take a small sip and swish around in your mouth
Overall, I can understand the hype. This beer takes Pliny the Elder to another level. I understand that it's extremely hard to make but I wish they could find a way to have it available year round. 793 charactersBenHesk12, Feb 07, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A-This beer is incredibly clear. Not a cloudy as the Elder. Has a nice shiny golden look. Maybe some slight orange. Didnt have any head but didnt need any. 
S-You have to really sink your nose into this one as its so freaken subtle. You get a sweet alcohol presence and pure hops. All three of them. Lots of pineapple on this one. Really nice. 
T-Initally you get a ton of hops upfront with tons of fruits. Lots of pineapple, grapefruit, green grapes, orange, just really nice sweet fruits. On the back end is the alcohol. Lingers around for a little bit but incredible how subtle it is. Mind you this is an 11% brew. 
M-Medium bodied with lots of character. Smooth man, really smooth. You take something so strong and abundant in this beer and it just settles nicely. Carbonation is good, there isnt an heat from the beer, and the hops are sweet. 
O-Just an incrdible brew. Simply amazing. Best part about this is how well rounded and smooth and balanced it is for a bomb of a beer. Bliss. 994 charactersales4baldo, Feb 06, 2012
4.84/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On-tap at Russian River brewery. Poured into a 10 oz. nonic mini-pint glass.
A- Pours a clear bright golden color with a thin layer of sticky white head. 
S- Massive pine hop aroma, some malt and alcohol sweetness, some honey.
T- Hop explosion. One of the most bitter beers I've ever had. On the first sip all I get is huge bitterness, it takes a few sips to get used to it. Big enormous pine sap flavor, underneath is a dense layer of fruit, grapefruit, mango, some pineapple and orange. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden, it starts to provide some warmth as the beer warms. Light, sweet cookie malt. Sticky, slightly dry on the end with a long dandelion bitter finish that actually lasts for minutes.
M- Full-bodied, carbonation is spot on, smooth, slightly sticky feel, drinkability is pretty damn good for such an intense beer.
O- What a beer! This is what a big American IPA should be, the hops are taken to the absolute max, the layers of flavor are hugely complex and take a pretty long time to unravel, alcohol does a number but is kept under good control, this beer is really incredible. 1,100 charactersWillCarrera, Feb 05, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on tap the release day at 10:30 am.
A- golden, not as hazy as the elder, small head.
S- HOPS. the smell is awesome. I wish I could of had it in a tulip/snifter. Slight maltiness, mango, pine, and grapefruit.
T- hopy goodness. So far it lived up to the hype. I get a sweettart candy flavor. The alcohol is hidden very well. I thought it was going to be a little less bitter than the elder but it was about the same. (supposedly it was a more bitter batch this year). Very subtle maltiness with great tropical fruitiness
M- Full bodied with subtle carbonation. Bitterness lingers a bit
O- this beer was worth getting to the pub at 7:30 am. I enjoyed it thoroughly and I will be definitely going back the next two weeks for more. I am a big fan of the elder and this beer just steps it up to a whole nother level of flavor/aroma. Thanks Vinnie. 854 charactersGiovacchini, Feb 04, 2012

A - Slightly hazy golden with one finger white head with good lacing and good head retention.
S - Great hop profile with balance of citrus and pine and a bit of malt sweetness.
T - Smooth and balancde beginning to end, amazing hops grapefruit, orange, lemon, pine, with a sweet malt and the best dry bitter finish I've had in an IPA. Nice alcohol flavor as well.
M - Full body, medium carbonation.
O - Best IPA I have ever had. This is my favorite style. This is among my favorite beers. DRINK IT! 602 characterswilliamjbauer, Feb 03, 2012

S - Spicy pine and intense citrus give a firm punch to the nose while the sweet smell of malt gently follows.
T - Call me crazy, but I don't think it's as aggressive as the Elder. It's super balanced and super piney. A honey-like sweetness calms the intensity of the citrusy flavors: grapefruit and pineapple are most prominent. So spicy and sweet, it's very complex.
M - it feels like the th carbonated sap of a pine tree is smoothly sliding around my mouth. Velvety an light yet still rich an thick.
O - I do hate how hyped up this beer ha become. I definitely think there are better Dipas out there, but I can't deny that this is definitely in the top 10. Extremely delicious. Dangerously refreshing. 783 charactersJef59, Nov 16, 2011

Pours a nice golden hue with low fluffy white head and minimal lacing. Sweet, citrus aroma with less pine than I remember from last year’s release, but still - what a nice nose. Could breath this one all day. Starts with a mild pine resin and citrus flavor, with pineapple and orange flavors coming on strong on the finish. Nice hop balance and tell-tale floral pine on the tongue. Beautiful stuff and incredibly balanced with minimal bitterness. Thanks to Chris for procuring this great brew again. 619 charactersDoodler, Nov 10, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -5.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Made the pilgrimage to Russian River pub in Santa Rosa this past February specifically for this beer. When we first arrived (on the day of release), there was a 4 hour wait to get in. We aborted and went up the road to Bear Republic for lunch instead. When we returned to Russian River that night at about 8pm, the line was only 45 minutes long. Once inside, the atmosphere was awesome because everyone was there to try the same beer, and they had all put a lot of effort into being there. It was a great party.
The beer was served in 10oz nonic glasses (half imperial pint), but there was no limit to the number of pours you could buy (but no growlers).
This beer can be summed up as "Pliny the Elder times two". The characteristics are all the same as Elder, just more intense. More sugar, more alcohol, more hops. If you've had the Elder, just imagine the same wonderful hop aroma and flavor twice as intense. 
Because of the extra sugar and alcohol, the body is quite more substantial than the Elder. On initial sip, the beer seems quite syrupy and heavy. But after a few more sips, this perception fades and the beer is pure enjoyment.
Overall, a great beer. I'm glad I made the trek (for the experience alone), but I doubt I would do it again. It's a great one time beer, but for repeated drinking, I prefer the Elder. 1,328 charactersClaremontBrew, Sep 30, 2011

P: Golden body with a decent off-white head. Great lacing.

T: Flavors follow the nose, with tons of apricot amd peach flavors. Hops are floral and piney on top of biscuit malts. Finish is floral and has a long and lingering hop bitterness. Amazing balance for being a 'triple IPA.'
Yes. This is worth it. A beer that finally lives up to the hype. Just about perfect. 555 characterslitheum94, Aug 08, 2011

4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler sent by joeneugs (the last year they sold growlers-rating from notes)
Pours a clear dark golden/orange color with a medium sized off white head. There was a big pop when we opened the growler.
The aroma was everything I would want in a DIPA: an explosion of hops containing pine, pineapple, clementine, apricot, resin, ...! Some touches of caramel malt sweetness, but this is about the hops.
The flavor brings much of the same: pine, resin, citrus, lemon, grapefruit, pineapple, and caramel malts to try and off-set the bitterness. The alcohol remains hidden throughout. Medium, somewhat oily texture, dry, so easy to drink; great mouthfeel.
I had wanted to try this since I joined the site and it did not disappoint. This is everything a DIPA should be and more. My next step is to make it out to the San Fran area when it is on tap and have it as fresh as possible. 879 charactersajsdad06, Jul 13, 2011

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a 6 oz mini snifter glass at Capones in Norristown (just outside of Philly). After waiting in line for 1.5 hours, let's see if this was worth the wait...
A - Crystal clear honey-orange body with an extremely tiny, almost non-present, white foam head. Some moderate to low lacing, actually - no retention really, either.
S - Sweet and prickly pine sap notes and pink grapefruit up front. Slightly bitter, with some lemongrass and a very faint whiff of honey in the back end. Really an outstanding smelling beer.
T - Up front are some rather harsh pine notes, a slight bitterness though not as much as I was expecting from an 11% IIPA. Melon sweetness, generic citrus qualities and prominent orange flavors complete this bitter to sweet flavor profile.
M - Smooth and creamy, low carbonation (strange) but overall, pleasant. Not as wonderful as the mouth feel I got with Pliny the Elder.
Glad to know that this was served just a few days of its release so it was very fresh. Had 3-4 in one sitting. Such a great beer.

4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into an eight ounce glass. It appears medium bodied gold with only a thin layer of white foam.
I get an herbal grapefruit like smell to the beer. There is a bit of a grassy pine like smell as well. All you can smell in this beer are strong fresh dank hops. 
It tastes initially very citrus like. I get a bit of a grapefruit flavor. There is a strong pine like dank flavor. There is a grassy hop flavor as well. I detect almost no malt presence in this beer. Hops are the star of this beer (obviously). The beer attacks the palate with a strong but pleasant bitterness. The herbal, slightly citrus, pine like and bitter quality of the hops all linger on for quite a while. This is a very clean and smooth tasting beer. In many ways this beer shows constraint and is not over the top (though the craziness surrounding this beer is). 
The carbonation is moderate. There is a crisp mouthfeel to this beer.
The drinkability for being 11 percent is pretty good. It goes down quite easy but due to how flavorful it is this beer is a sipper. I could drink a few glasses of this if given the opportunity.
Overall a nearly flawless beer. I think the hype surrounding this beer is insane but the beer really is amazingly good. The cleanest, most flavorful (yet restrained) double/ triple IPA I have had. 1,304 charactersrudeboy916, Jun 11, 2011

Does it live up to the hype? Well, kinda. At least it did in 2011 and earlier. Are there local beers that are just as good that you won't wait in ridiculous lines for and pay upwards of $20 a pour for? Sure. Still, no real complaints about PtY here.
2011 batch. Poured a golden peach color, nicely carbonated, with an attractive, fluffy white head that laced well. I expected just a really good IPA here, but no, it's much more. Big hops in the nose, and a medley of light fruits and citrus, with a noticeable sweetness. The hop bitterness and the fruit tastes complemented themselves pretty much perfectly. Lots of floral and citrus hops, juicy fruits of all kind: mango, grapefruit, orange, grapes, pineapples, apricots... Just so much going on here, and all great. Medium mouthfeel, smooth and delicious, and highly drinkable...if you can find it.
Rating: 4.35-4.5
2012 batch....meh....very underwhelming. Notably different. More bitterness, more hype, less fruit, less flavor. Supposedly this lapse was due to a Simcoe/Amarillo hop shortage, and the subsequent replacement of Chinooks in the recipe. Makes sense if true. Still a solid beer, but no better than "okay."
2013 batch. About the same as 2012. I guess they changed the recipe after all. Oh well. 1,303 charactersRifugium, Jun 10, 2011

T - Smoth piney hops followed by silky citrus flavors. 
D - Nicely carbonated, with no bitterness at all, zero.
O - I was afraid that the hype would let me down, but this is one of the best beers I will ever taste. I can not wait to try it again. 
Seperately it would have been hard to tell the difference between Elder and Younger, but following the Younger I could detect some slight differences. I would never turn down either, ever! 671 charactersHuskyinPDX, May 31, 2011

Bright orange peel, lemon zest, and floral aroma with hints on evergreen. Huge 2-inch tight white foam with an amazing blaze orange body. Lacing clinging mightily to the inside of the glass, a fond memory of the sip that just transpired. Flavor is incredible...definitely more aggressive and profound than it’s older sibling.

4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had the opportunity to sample this several times at EBF including a nice little side by side with PtE.
Russian River makes some great beers and PtE has always been a favorite of mine. Even if it is a little over-hyped, it is still a great beer and I really was looking forward to PtY. Pours just a hint darker than Elder at a golden orange with just a faint haze, but this is mostly clear. Nice frothy white head. I'm a fan of dry DIPAs and semi-sweet DIPAs and this falls into the later category. Big cirtus, floral and piny hops with a hint of sweetness. More pungent than Elder with a sweetness. Taste is very much the same. No real malt to speak of which is great and the citrus really shines. Some nice bitterness to counter the sweetness.
Hopefully I'll be able to make it out to the Russian River and sample this again one of these days. 848 charactersLunch, May 22, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review of Pliny the Younger from tasting notes taken on March 3, 2011.
PtY is a pretty beer, that is a golden amber with just a little whisp of pale white head. It has surprising little cling for a beer of this hoppiness, but that might be due a protein rest or the low mash temperatures to make a highly fermentable malt. The beer smells very hoppy, with good citrus and fruity character as well as a dank piney aroma, probably from the Simcoe. This isn't as hoppy as I thought though, but it's hard to live up to the reputation. The beer tastes surprisingly sweet, although, at 11% I should've expected that. The hoppiness was expressive and very fruity, but the bitterness seems very restrained, perhaps tempered by the malty sweetness. This beer isn't the hop-bomb that I was expecting, I thought it would be a Pliny squared, but is more like Avery Maharaja, an Imperial IPA with big malt flavors. The mouthfeel is absolutely creamy and the carbonation is delicate.
Was it worth the wait? Does it live up to the hype? Would I wait several hours for this beer? The answer is probably no, but it's tasty. 1,108 charactersSoonami, May 22, 2011

4.48/5  rDev -4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this beer a couple of times at tappings throughout the Philadelphia area.
Review is based off of memory - which I have retained very well due to the amazingness of this beer.
Poured from tap into a tulip glass. About a 10 oz pour.
The color of this beer is amazing. Looks like liquid gold - orange and bright. Not any real head to this. no lacing.
Smell was of very strong citrus fruits, pineapple and whole leaf hops. The citrus was dominating. Very pleasant. Could smell the thing immediately when placed in front of me from 2 feet away.
Taste was glorious. I have NO IDEA how this beer is 11% abv. Dangerous. No real indication of alcohol burn in this, that you would expect from a beer this high in abv. Citrus hops, bitter, but very well-balanced bitterness. A bit of malt in the background.
Overall, this is the best triple IPA out there. Very enjoyable, and mandatory try for any hophead. Definitely worth the hype. 930 charactersThoreauLikeAGirl, May 11, 2011

Half finger white head due to full pour, pretty quick dissipation with minimal lacing. Clear orange amber body, very little visible carbonation. Big pine hit in the nose, resiny, any fruit aromas are subsumed by the pineyness. Taste mirrors nose, very bitter on the back end, like chewing on pine needles. Despite this keg being a few months old, quite a bit of alcohol heat. Medium mouthfeel, decent effervescence. To be honest, I don't see what the big deal is. Frankly, I'd rather have another Tankslapper! 573 charactersjdense, May 08, 2011

Good frontal, and finishing hoppy taste with a light malty taste. The Pliny was several months old so I am sure this affected the taste quite a bit since Russian River does say it has to be fresh, so probably not as hoppy and nice as a fresh Pliny the Elder. Regardless of the freshness I still thought the beer was better than almost any IPAs, double IPAs I have tried. And the Sanctification was really good btw. 532 charactersAlex1976, Apr 23, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have to say I was very skeptical about this one. I've been to the RRBC several times, and overall arn't a big fan of too many of their beers, including the elder (OK, imo). Maybe it was the waiting in line on a warm california day that makes you appreciated a cold beer more, but I have to say that for the most part the hype is true. I agree with the prev reviewer, it's 11%, and you can't taste the alcohol AT ALL. This a truely DANGEROUS BEER. The best description that I could come up with at the time was that you take the Elder and add the subtle, yet complex taste of a Belgian and this is what you get. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this one is definitely the exception (and I've tried a lot of IPA's looking for one I like, but so far this one is IT). 759 charactersMachinehead, Apr 15, 2011

A - Very average "looks", clear orange with very little head. Zero lacing. Thin white head sits; when awaken. Almost looks like a cider. Much lighter than the Elder
S - Great scent. Smooth orange-y citrus with lavender and other spice... Perhaps some raisins too??? Raisins would explain the lack of head. Better than the Elder
T - Zero alcohol taste, smooth, and citrus. Much more bitter than I thought it would be. But, for 11% it sits very well. Better and smoother than the Elder
M - Low carbonation, almost to the point of being flat, but carbonation fits the style well. The flavor goes well with the carbonation too. It goes though your mouth much better than the Elder
D - GREAT! Hardest brew I've ever had to put down, perhaps it's due to it's "stigma". Better than the Elder
Not at all over hyped... It's a great beer and I prefer YOUNGER! Worth the anticipation. I'm Very happy I took the time to try this delightful brew. $8 for a 14oz pour, not bad. Thanks @TrinityBrewing for making this tapping possible.

4.84/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Had this one in early March on tap at Stone Brewery in Escondido. I had no idea that I was in for such a pleasant surprise on my first visit to Stone. I had one glass on my way down to San Diego when it wasn't on the menu yet. I decided to stop by on my way back the next day to see if they still had any. It was on the menu now so I quaffed three servings of the stuff. Needless to say, I liked it.
That's Pliny the Younger in my Avatar over there, sitting next to my Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous.
Pours orangish-golden with a clingy white head. The head dissipates fairly quickly, but lacing still sticks to the glass all the way down. I love the look and color of this beer, but I fear I may have lost objectivity here. I think I now associate this color with the wonderful smell, taste and mouthfeel of this beer, which makes me correspondingly love the color and appearance.
A sweet, floral, citrusy, piney aroma just flows from the glass. It is so pleasant, yet so powerful. There is a lot going on, but it is not a jumble. It is a bouquet of olfactory succulence.
This is way up there in the IBUs, but is also pleasant to drink. Once again, so pleasant, yet so powerful. In the taste, it's the pine and grapefruit that come in the strongest. Hints of floral perfumes, but there is a great tempering sweetness - this is not just hop juice, they've remembered that malt goes into beermaking too.
This is a medium bodied beer, carbonation is on the low to mid-range. Super drinkable beer for such a hoppy concoction.
So pleasant, yet so powerful. I think that is the factor that makes this beer world class for me. You can do pleasant. Or you can do powerful. But so many times they are at odds with one another. To reconcile them in perfect harmony as Russian River has done with Pliny the Younger is to demonstrate true craftsmanship.
I don't know about all of this hate - I don't get the Westy 12 versus the PtY versus the PtE fanboy mentality out there. Hype informs me of what's out there, but it does not make me love nor does it make me hate a beer. This beer spoke for itself. I would have reacted the same way - neither more positively nor more negatively had I tried it out of pure ignorance. It was wonderful. Can't they both be wonderful. Would it be so wrong to have numerous wonderful beers in the world? 2,331 charactersghetto90007, Apr 07, 2011

A: Golden color with an slight amber hue. Small head with little lacing. However, the small snifter doesn't promote a large head or lacing.
S: Compared to elder this is much less piney, however has a much stronger fruity/citrus aroma. Strong notes of various citrus, pineapple, and mango. Strong fresh hop smell like no other. It literally smells like a bag of leaf hops. No detection of malt or alcohol...exactly how a big west coast IPA should smell!
T: Not quite as mind blowing as the aroma. Flavor includes strong tropical fruit and candy notes. Not quite as dry as elder with more of a malty flavor in the finish. The bitterness and alcohol content is much less than one would expect. This is the best example of strong aroma/flavor hopping I've ever tried.
M: Full body mouthfeel with a medium amount of carbonation. However, not quite as oily or coating as one would expect.
O: Simply the best Triple IPA out there. It never lives up to all the craziness and hype. However, what beers really could? I'm honored to have been able to try it in the last three releases! 1,210 charactersmmercede, Apr 05, 2011
3.5/5  rDev -25.1%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into an 8oz tulip.
Had this on tap together with Elder and Blind Pig, so I'll compare to those.
Younger is the cloudiest of the three, with quickly dissipating head. I was surprised by the lack of head, given the amount of hops involved.
The aroma was surprisingly mild, again given the amount of hops in here.
Younger tastes maltier and sweeter than Blind Pig, but hoppier and more bitter than Elder. Whereas Elder is well balanced, Younger tips that balance towards the hops. The alcohol is hidden, but you can feel that this is a potent potable.
Overall, I feel this beer is over hyped, and the hype and rarity drive up the scores. It's a good beer, but it's not great, and I prefer Elder. 704 characterstimobkg, Apr 05, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5For my first BA review, I humble myself in the presence of PtY. I realize giving a perfect score is a dangerous move, but it truly represents my experience and what the beer deserves as an example of the style. 
PtE was largely my entrance to craft beer, and after trying many more fine brews and gallivanting around BA I knew that PtY was a must-have.
I tried it on-tap at the RR brewpub in Santa Rosa (mid-february), Ben and Nick's Bar in Oakland (early march), and the Trappist bar in Oakland (late march). 
Servings: at the brewpub, a 10 oz pour into a nonic pint. Ben and Nicks served a 10 oz in a stemmed tulip, and the Trappist poured 8 oz into a RR tulip.
Appearance: it glows. It was darker each time I tried it, but overall a deep golden orange.
Aroma: incredibly potent. Wonderful tropical bouquet cut with that familiar pine. Compared to PtY? More sweet and fruity than dank/musty/bitter. Fresher.
Taste: I'm very hop-tolerant, and this is clearly a celebration of a carefully constructed hop profile, but it isn't trying to prove anything. It's been said before, but the real triumph of this beer is the balance. You can taste hops inside and out, you can feel the buds prickling in your throat, but JUST enough malt presence carries you through to a graceful, ever so slightly dry finish. It's a big beer, but there is nothing cloying about it. 
Mouthfeel: Just a bit heavier than the uncle, but clean and smooth still. The Trappist uses 30% NO in their taps, which imo countered the dryness a bit and left a more lingering mouthfeel. Carb is right on.
Drinkability: the beer is highly enjoyable; it's only extreme in its freshness and balance--it goes down like mother's milk. However, I felt the effects after each glass, humbled like Icarus.
Russian River is a truly great brewery. PtY does not compete by being heavy-handed, so I regret the constant need to compare it to other hoppy beers. There is no need for skepticism; it is a masterpiece. Like Mark Starr said, when you get to this level, it's just a matter of preference. If you're looking for the most extreme hop experience, your search doesn't end with PtY. Most likely it will simply take a detour into the rest of what RR has to offer. 2,224 charactersapplestash, Apr 05, 2011

Appearance: Beautiful transparent golden color. No head as it was decanted once into a pitcher and again into the snifter. No big deal I think I will live.
Smell: Beautiful hop pungent aroma. Slight amount of booze, but at 11% that is not surprising.
Taste: While there are a ton of hops that hit you right away, there is quite a noticable malt backbone that kind of turns me off. A little boozy, but I guess it all balances out.
Mouthfeel: Even though it was was poured twice it still has a nice bubbly crips clean mouthfeel.
Overall: Very good beer, but IMO Elder is better by a longshot. Hype it huge on this and while it is very solid, I think it is overhyped. Thank you Russian River for another great offering! 780 charactersOddNotion, Apr 04, 2011

Fortunate to get four 5.5oz servings, and transfered 3 to a decent size tulip glass. My wife insisted on having 1 for herself. This might have been "sharing the love" a bit too far.
Descriptions noted before cover it pretty well. But I am writing this because I expect many who have not tried it may have the same misimpression that I had before tasting.
Having had PTE ...and can't keep track of many, many other excellent IPAs (Imp, double imp, DIPA, etc etc etc)from West Coast and otherwise I was expectig just a bigger/supposedly better beer...what a mistake.
The first impression was so surprising...that the hop profile was excellent; absoltutely delicious, vast ( no surprise)... but no haymaker/slap to the mouth. No jolt, just so full of flavor. The malts were big and very present in taste and mouthfeel, but not distracting or bullish. 
Thought it was very good.
Half way through the glass it struck me that this might be the best balance of big hops and big malt that I had ever had. The arome remained so pleasant.
Thought was exceptionally excellent.
Finished glass. So smooth, hops and malts so married, so well. Wow.
But this was an IPA...Here I was expecting a rock concert...and instead I got artistry.
I found it the most drinkable and enjoyable IPA I have had...or at least in so long a time that comparison is moot.
Hope you get a chance to try this special beer. 1,534 charactersBillRoth, Apr 03, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Striking honey colored amber. Wasn't expecting the look of this beer to be as beautiful it was.
S - Pine & Grapefruit notes, classic DIPA smell, very fragrant
T - The classic hoppiness of other great DIPAs was there, but it was incredibly smooth, almost subtly sweet. None of that bitter or funny aftertaste you usually get with heavily hopped beers. Exceptional!
M - Despite its malty notes, it maintains the crispness you expect from an good DIPA.
O - I bought into the hype before I tasted this beer, so you'd think it I'd be at least a little let down, but I kid you not, I teared-up a little. It's that good. If anything, I think I expected something more aggressive, like Stone's Domination IPA, but the magic of this beer is how it marries the wonderful hoppy qualities of an DIPA with a smooth, sweetness that I've yet experienced in one of its peers. Hands down the best DIPA you will ever experience, and maybe, dare I say it, the best *beer* you will ever experience (outside of Belgium, of course... respect to the Trappists) 1,045 charactersdanglin85, Apr 03, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had this on-tap at Capone's, poured into a goblet.
Appearance: Pours a very clear golden amber color with hardly any head at all. A ring of white carbonation clings to the edge of the glass.
Smell: This beer smells awesome, one of the best I've run into. The smell is quite sweet with tons of citrus hops, I'm smelling tangerine and clementine. There is some malt in there with the hops as well. I would describe it as crisp.
Taste: Again, there are a ton of hops here too. The taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell. Pine and citrus hop bitterness smothers the tongue. The malt is adding some sweetness. The finish is super bitter with a hint of warmth from the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: The body is medium with a very low amount of carbonation. Just enough to feel a tingle on the tongue. The beer sticks to the tongue, and there is a super dry finish.
Overall: This beer is very good, one of the best in fact. I really enjoyed the hint of alcohol along with the other flavors. Given the strength of this one, it is super easy to drink. The hop profile is wonderful. 1,072 charactersoline73, Apr 02, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a 6 oz mini snifter glass at Capones in Norristown. After waiting in line for 1.5 hours, let's see if this was worth the wait...
A: Crystal clear honey-orange body with an extremely tiny, almost non-present, white foam head. Some moderate to low lacing, actually - no retention really, either.
S: Sweet and prickly pine sap notes and pink grapefruit up front. Slightly bitter, with some lemongrass and a very faint whiff of honey in the back end. Really an outstanding smelling beer.
T: Up front are some rather harsh pine notes, a slight bitterness though not as much as I was expecting from an 11% IIPA. Melon sweetness, generic citrus qualities and prominent orange flavors complete this bitter to sweet flavor profile.
M: Smooth and creamy, low carbonation (strange) but overall, pleasant. Not as wonderful as the mouth feel I got with Pliny the Elder.
If I'm being completely honest, this was very good but wasn't worth the 1.5 hour wait in line for. I was fortunate enough to get two pours of this beer, totaling around 12 oz, but this doesn't really need all the hype surrounding it. In my opinion, Pliny the Elder wins the battle against Younger, although I was hoping it would be the opposite. Oh well. 1,228 charactersShanePB, Apr 02, 2011

I enjoyed this beer because it was sooo similar to pliny the elder, yet bigger in every way possible. the malts were not prominent and the hops smashed the pallet but in a very gentle way. The bar went crazy when they ran out. I am grateful for the people who were there early and appreciate the beer. I will be around next year. 380 characterssocaltay, Apr 02, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a 10oz goblet. 
Appearance- Slightly hazy and straw colored with a very nice white head. Good lacing on the glass.
Smell- Huge piney hop aroma. Not much malt smell. Some alcohol. 
Taste- Big piney bitterness all over my mouth. Small malt taste and lots of alcohol. VERY dry as well. 
Mouthfeel- This is a lot thinner than I remember. A lot thinner. I did not expect this. 
Overall- Very good IIPA. When I first had this two years ago I thought it was good but too boozy. I stand by that now, but I like it better this time around. Could it be my palate or the batch? It is much drier and thinner than I remember. I was glad to get this at the Horse Brass. This tapping was under the radar to say the least. Slow night and easy to get and enjoy quietly.
2012. Better than 2011s batch. Much more of a mouthfeel to it but still not sticky like some big IPAs can be.. Crazy booziness. 900 charactersMADhombrewer, Mar 30, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tap at PtY 2011 release. 
A- Into a small nonic pint, the pour is a clear, deep orange with a small, white head that leaves some big sheety lace. 
N- The aroma on PtY is a little hard to get at served in the miniature nonic pint glass. But once it warms up a bit you get some serious jackfruit, bitter mango, candied oranges, fresh blood orange. 
T- Taste is fresh mango hoppy like biting into a raw mango. Lots of bitter mango skin and juicy mango pulp. Dank, fruity tropicals abound but the seriously dense body here is hard to get through. Some quick, spicy alcohol is present but a non sequitor.
P- Syrupy and dense. Spicy and full.
Obviously the king of DIPAs, but that doesn't mean it has to be my favorite. 718 characterstarheels86, Mar 30, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On draught at Oskar Blue's Liquids and Solids in Longmont, Co. Poured into an 8oz snifter.
A: Deep gold with amber hues but more on the bright side of amber then the dark. Solid head retention that fades into a spiderweb like lacing on the glass.
S: Massive piney hops is the first aroma to hit your senses. It's as if you too a wiff of the biggest pine tree in existance and let the flavor wash over you. Touches of citrus grapefruit also take shape behind the chronic and pine notes.
T: Massive pine to match the nose. Comes across somewhat sticky and resinous but the bitter is truly there. Citrus fruit such as mango and pineapple are present but pine and chronic flavors are dominate. The malt is solid and doesn't subdue the hops but instead balances them very well.
M: Because of the prefect malt backbone this beer weighs heavy on the palate. Top of mouth is coated but the bitterness creeps from the back of the palate to the front. Citrus notes linger on the middel of the tongue and the finish just doesn't stop. Almost no booziness present.
D: Having the oppurtunity to taste this beer is up there with getting superbowl tickets. It's worth the time, effort, and money. It's exceptional in all standings for what an Imperial IPA should be. It's not over hopped nor is it over malted, it's perfectly balanced- just like all the beers RR does. I only wish it were made more often or in higher quantities because 8oz's is just not enough. 1,452 charactersnotyourdadsbeer, Mar 24, 2011
4.54/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours with a small but solid head with a good effervescence. The beer couldn't smell more like pine, just wonderful like walking in a pinewood forest. I love aromatic beers and I could smell this one five feet away when the growler was opened. This is one of the driest hoppy beers I have ever tried, and now I fear I am going to crave it constantly. The beer is bracingly bitter and piney with some great complimentary mango and very mild citrus flavors that lend a hand in the complexity, this is not to say that the fruit notes sweeten the beer at all. There is just not a trace of the huge alcohol , just one remarkably well put together beer. 656 charactersBieresDesMoines, Mar 23, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42/15/11 on-tab at San Diego Brewing Co
Spent about two weeks watching Facebook to actually get a taste of this beer. Luckily I found it at the SD Brewing, a fantastic establishment with good beer of their own.
A: Pours a deep orange with a small amount of head that dissipates quickly. Clear and crisp, little to no lacing.
S: Nothing beats the smell of this beer. Simicoe hops, pine, citrus that you can smell from several feet away. You have to get it right off the tap or the smell will diminish in a hurry. As the beer warms up you start to get a bit more of the scent when drinking. Edit: I stand corrected. The nose on this beer is somewhat muted compared to other DIPA and TIPA's on the market. It's still great, but the smell isn't as strong as it should be. Lowering this from 5 to 4. I have had this at four different tastings now, and my opinion only of the smell has lowered. Everything else is is accurate. Still extremely smooth and wonderful.
T: Sweet and malty with upfront bitterness and an alcoholic finish. Complex flavor without being too overpowering. That being said, I didn't give the taste a '5' because the alcohol is still there and so is some astringency that I wasn't expecting.
M: Mouthfeel is fantastic. Bar none. Creamy and sweet without feeling like you're eating a malt sandwich. Goes down smooth.
D: It's actually quite hard to session this beer. Besides being quickly intoxicated, the strong bitterness lingers on the back of the pallet for a long time. A great beer that I wouldn't want to have more than 2 of. 1,552 charactersdmsohyea, Mar 20, 2011

A- Appearance is a Dark Gold mostly clear of cloudiness from yeast.
S- Piny strong hop presence much like its elder brother.
T- Taste is amazing! makes the elder next to it taste like a coors.
M- Goes down smooth
O- One of the best beers I've ever had. 425 characterswerdnacross, Mar 19, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served at Blue Dog Tavern on 3/13. Thanks to the great people there who had such an efficient ticket system in place for the beer! 
A - Poured into tulip glass with a solid two inch head, which dissipated into a thin lace around the top with lacing on the glass. A slightly darker golden color, slightly darker than my friend's Elder he was drinking.
S - Citrus and grapefruit hops
T - Hops come alive in this beer. The lingering piney hop bitterness is enough to let you know the hops are alive and kicking, but not in a bad way. The up front taste is of more of a citrus hop flavor. The malt is hidden beneath the hops, but definitely there, an almost biscuit taste to it, but again, behind all of the hops.
M - Just right, well carbonated with a full crisp mouthfeel
D - For 11%, it went down incredibly easy. No alcohol burn to it what so ever. Halfway through my glass I realized I needed to start taking smaller sips, as I was drinking my only glass a bit too quickly.
Overall, an exceptional beer, one that I could drink all day, as long as the 11% didn't knock me out. Definitely has more of a hop bitterness than the Elder, which seems mellow compared to the Younger. Looking forward to having another glass next year. 1,233 charactersgoldenmonkey1, Mar 18, 2011
4.58/5  rDev -1.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I made a 2 hour road trip to Russian River a few days before the 2 week pouring "window" ended, in hopes of tasing the legend. I landed in the brewery by early afternoon and easily found a barstool. Score!
I was poured my 8 oz portion immediately. The color was a gold/bronze with a thin head that quickly dissapated to a thin lacing.
The nose was less than expected, given my PtE experience. The pine was present but not much citrus.
The taste was extremely balanced for such a big beer. It was BIG in hops and malt without being too toasted or sharp. The smoothness ended earlier than the hoppy bitterness, giving this one a bit of a kick at the end compared to its uncle.
The mouthfeel matched the magnificent taste...the hops provided a full experience and the subtle carbonation helped this big beer go down smoothly, something to watch for with a beer this big! 
I loved the beer. I had an Elder taste during my session (of 3 8 oz pours) and found that while the nose of the Elder was superior, the overall impact (i.e. Lupluin shift) of the younger made the Elder difficult to enjoy or compare while in its "zone". I will enjoy PtY again if I get the chance. Meanwhile I continue to target PtE with my homebrew efforts. 1,231 charactersheartofgold, Mar 18, 2011

Pours a beautiful orange color with a half inch of head. Leaves nice lacing down the glass...all IPAs should look like this.
Smells of citrus and pine, bread is far in the background...but its balanced...I cannot explain this. Its a little subtle for a beer this big, but overall wish it was more
Taste has everything...citrus burst on the tip with pine and citrus in the middle and finishes with pine...herbs are mixed in. The malt is an after thought, yet is balanced. Once again, I cannot explain it, its fantastic.
Mouthfeel suffers a bit from the full feeling. Its light and crisp with amazing carbonation, yet it fills the mouth like a stout.
Drinkability is amazing, had 3, could have had more, chose to walk away...did you know it is 11% alcohol?
This is an amazing IPA...really what it boils down to 943 charactersbs870621345, Mar 16, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Notes for later review when I'm on a computer: 
App: golden copper wondrous clear with beautiful lacing. Maybe a little brighter, more golden than Pliny the elder. 
Smell: beautuful. Every hop note. Grapefruit herbs grass earth citrus and oooh the malts caramel and sugar, biscuit, grain, and beer beer beer
taste: epic. Knuckle sandwich be warned. Torn as to my favorite. The initial bites have water and citrus sweet hops with grapefruit, the middle is malty and bitter hops, and the finish dries with a ridiculous sweetness - how they got that pairing is beyond me.
mouth: same as pte, quality with wonderful carbonation and medium to almost full body
drink: a million. Forever. Desperately dangerous. I'm in love with knuckle sandwich but this is about its only competitor
summation: best vacation ever. On my third pour. Let's hope I hang on to sobriety. 865 charactersafksports, Mar 16, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5After trying the Elder and blind pig and being massively underwhelmed, I was not expecting much from this beer. What an incredible surprise. 
The look is much the same as other DIPA's and there isn't much to differentiate in this department but from there on in it just got better.
Wonderful floral hops are the dominant falvour but they are well balanced with some citrus all coming off the head that actually stuck around.
My first sip revealed a wonderful creamy silk texture that I haven't had from anothr DIPA and the sweetness balanced with the turbo-charged bitter hops that linger and dance on your palate long after the gulp of beer is gone.
This is a real belter of a beer, it tastes fantastic and slips down nicely for something as strong as it is. The only problem for me is that the alcohol is still a little dominant and IPA is not my favourite style of beer so not the best beer in the world for me, but certainly one of the best in its class for sure. 967 charactershophopandaway, Mar 14, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On Tap at the Blue Dog in Chalfont PA on 3/13/11- thanks to a thoughtful ticket system that also benefited a couple worthy charities. Kudos, Blue Dog!! Served in a Tulip Glass.
A- VERY CLEAR Golden Color with a nice bronze hue. Foamy one finger head that was not quick at all to bubble away. Did eventually wear down to a small amount of nice sticky lace that left trails down the glass as I savored every mouthful of this brew.
S- Notes of piney hops- not as "in your face" as I expected given the press about this ale. In fact, I had this after a finishing a glass of Pliny the Elder, and would say that Elder's hoppy aroma was stronger and packed more of a punch. Younger is more subtle to the nose.
T- Hoppy bliss!! Full, full, (and did I mention full?) hop bitterness from the first splash through the finish. In fact, the piney hop notes seemed to linger and intensify a bit after swallowing. The amazing thing about this brew is that it's powerfully hoppy, but at the same time powerfully SMOOTH as well. Amazing!
M- Full Body; this ale finds every taste receptor in your mouth, including the ones you didn't know you had- but with a perfect balance of taste/feel/fizz.
D- Two or three of these would go down very easily, but more would be tough without food to accompany, or a cab ride home.
This is an amazing brew that I'm glad to say I had a chance to try- it lives up to the hype. That said, as rare as this comes out and as (relatively) easy as it is in the Philly area to get Elder, I'll let others have the chance to get tickets for this next year and stick with the Elder. You can't go wrong with either, and Elder doesn't command the premium or treasure hunting expedition. 1,696 charactersCraftAleRookie, Mar 13, 2011

Had this again on 2017-03-04 at Capone's in Norristown, PA on tap with Alex after waiting in the cold for 4.5 hours. It tasted great but what wouldn't after that!
A - 9 oz of beautiful, golden-orange into a snifter produced a short, white head and minimal lacing. I had this side-by-side with an Elder and the Younger is quite a bit more orange.
S - Wonderful and strong. More aroma than the Elder. Lots of pine, pineapple, mango, passion fruit and sugar toast.
T - Frankly, the taste surprised me as it did not closely follow the nose. First impression was dry, malty and boozy but then the pine and tropical flavors kicked in. It's more bitter than the Elder. Not wanting to rush things, I sipped it over a 1/2 hour period. As it warmed, it tasted a little sweeter, which I was glad of. I also noted a little pepper. The aftertaste lingers more than the Elder and is well-balanced. 
M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation. Resinous, prickly and surprisingly dry for this big a beer.
D - Well it's a great beer and I'm glad the quest is over to find and try it. I know I'll have it again. In a head-to-head with the Elder on this day, I liked the Elder a bit better. 1,362 charactersTucquan, Mar 13, 2011

I though in all honesty don't feel it's the greatest thing EVER. As you would assume it to be from all the hype. But the Russian River crew has again produced another gem to treat us eager beer drinkers with. OK OK the beer...
A very brilliant clear golden yellow with hints of off tan straw. A very thin head dissipates very very fast. 
The nose brought out pine needles, fresh trimmings of the chronic, a little straw, with sweet hops all cut with a stinging alc. 
There was a spiciness to the beer, that after lemon and green herb. The hops were more to the back of the pallet that all lead to a warm alcohol. 
The drinkability of this beer is a personal opinion. I could drink this over and over again. Would it make me see triple? well yea! But there is an amazing balance that gives this beer nothing of a sense of un-drinkability. 
See you next year Little guy! 946 charactersMexicanSkittel, Mar 11, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I am lucky enough to work at a place called Hopmonk Tavern in Sonoma, CA. The owner Dean Biersch bought the last keg of Pliny the Younger for the year about 2 weeks ago. Two days ago, Tuesday March 8th we tapped the last keg of the Younger in the county. Guess who had to work all night? By the time I got off 7 hours later, there was so little left in the keg that it weighed as much as the empties. Nonetheless, I got a full 12 oz glass with Kary, our head chef.
Appearance- Light golden pour, slowly gathering into a frothy, almost meringue-like pillow top mattress of foam. Excellent retention.
Smell- Akin to the Elder, but with much bolder fruity citrus note.
Taste- Almost immediately after the initial shock of alcohol (11%)/maltiness, the HOPocalypse begins, crisp grapefruit and sweet piney flavors combine with a near bread-like finish that.. really shouldn't be called a finish it lingers so long on your palate. 
Drinkability- At 11%, two 12oz. glasses is enough for almost anyone. Not to mention there are only a small percentage of beer drinkers who can appreciate a beer like this. The majority of folks simply think it tastes "too bitter"... BAH.. don't waste it on those people! 1,200 charactersBrewerDude707, Mar 10, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On Tap @ Father's Office Santa Monica 2/11(From memory)
After waiting 1.5 hours and getting denied at the cluster that was Surly Goat the night before, I was happy to catch FOI's twitter feed the next night and have 20oz of the 15 gallons they released rather quietly.
Whether all the hype added to my immense enjoyment of this divine nectar is inconsequential. Long story short I can't think of a better beer that's ever passed my lips.
Poured a hazy straw/light orange color with a thin head. Incredible kaleidoscopic nose that combines the powerful skunky simcoe dispensary nose of Elder with a concentrated, almost delicate note of pure bright candied apricot fruit. WOW.
On the palate this beer is even smoother than Elder, if I had to guess the ABV blind I'd say 7-8%, it's that well hidden. There is an incredibly zen balance to the taste of this beer that I can only compare to the best Grand Cru Burgundy. Absolutely etheral, even though it's more concentrated, I'd say this is more drinkable than Elder. IBUs are off the chart. I get what they mean by Lupulin threshold shift. Definitely more purely concentrated hoppy than anything I've ever had. But the balance of this beer just swaddles the bitterness in cashmere. The fact that Vinnie makes an 11% ABV beer this balanced is a high wire act that I've never seen surpassed. Cheers. See you next year Younger! 1,375 charactersgpatt55, Mar 10, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into an eight ounce glass. It appears medium bodied gold with only a thin layer of white foam.
I get an herbal grapefruit like smell to the beer. There is a bit of a grassy pine like smell as well. All you can smell in this beer are strong fresh dank hops. 
It tastes initially very citrus like. I get a bit of a grapefruit flavor. There is a strong pine like dank flavor. There is a grassy hop flavor as well. I detect almost no malt presence in this beer. Hops are the star of this beer (obviously). The beer attacks the palate with a strong but pleasant bitterness. The herbal, slightly citrus, pine like and bitter quality of the hops all linger on for quite a while. This is a very clean and smooth tasting beer. In many ways this beer shows constraint and is not over the top (though the craziness surrounding this beer is). 
The carbonation is moderate. There is a crisp mouthfeel to this beer.
The drinkability for being 11 percent is pretty good. It goes down quite easy but due to how flavorful it is this beer is a sipper. I could drink a few glasses of this if given the opportunity.
Overall a nearly flawless beer. I think the hype surrounding this beer is insane but the beer really is amazingly good. The cleanest, most flavorful (yet restrained) double/ triple IPA I have had. 1,304 characterschumba526, Mar 09, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Scoats and his Grey Lodge Pub for the special offering. I enjoyed my own pour and shared half of my sister's (thank goodness for diets) with another friend, Marty.
This beer did live up to its advance billing. It has a clearer, appearance than expected. The wafting currents from the pour alerted the nose to the grape-fruity flavors embedded within. The taste was clean. It was sharp and it was like a cross between Sculpin and Nugget Nector, fortified with the correct steroids.
Mouthfeel was medium, the sharpness of the hop cut like a fine carbon steel knife. Drinkability was way up there, but it was the last beer of the evening and it was an excellent evening. 677 charactersjimbomill, Mar 09, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5The chase is over and let the hype finally have some perspective. My finish line was a newer joint in NW Denver called Hops and Pie. A little place that does two things great: pizza and craft brews! No fiasco, no attitude, and no worries. Hops and Pie poured off their 5.5 gallon of Younger within 45 mins with no stress.
I was able to snag a 8-10 oz pour of Younger in a mini pint glass. With the delicate pour I procured very little head but what I received was frothy white that receded to delicate white lacing.
The aroma of the Younger is really wonderful. Piney hops, hops and more hops. It exemplifies what a West Coast DIPA is and should be. Not a chase for IBU's but a pursuit of the exceptional.
The Younger tastes like it should. Smooth hoppy, hoppyness with over/undertones of grapefruit, citrus, and lime. Wikipedia is in the process of updating their definition of "smooth" to this beer. No alcohol flavor is apparent but reveals itself later on...
Younger is full bodied and smooth. It coats the palate with bitter, hoppy fruit resins that lingers beyond the norm. Drinkability? I chatted with a H&P patron that we would peg this beer as a 7% ABV if not to know better. This is an exceptionally drinkable beer that you would never know is high ABV.
And we come full circle. The hype? probably too much. The beer? as expected and a total treat. Worth the effort? not something I will stand in line for but when presented with an enjoyable opportunity to taste this fantasticness I will take it every time. Cheers Russian River! 1,546 characterskiddwhiz, Mar 07, 2011

Certainly on my "must try" list. However, with all the hype around this beer, I was a bit skeptical, but hey, a neighborhood pizza and beer place snagged a keg of this, so I figured I'd check it out. I'm glad I attended the tapping of Pliny the Younger at Hops & Pie on Tennyson St. in NW Denver. They tapped the keg at 3pm and it was kicked in less than half an hour. They used a ticket system for efficiency and to make sure we each only got 1-serving. Mind you, this establishment is a hole-in-the-wall, with maybe a dozen bar stools and less than 10-tables. Packed for the few hours I was there. Yes, many in-attendance for the tapping, but it was almost as busy the other time I went, and that was on a regular day.
A: A golden/orange color, with fairly good clarity. Minimal carbonation rising up through the ether. Also minimal head that had to be coaxed back up with a few swirls. Most people were getting their pours out of mini-pint glasses, so I actually felt fortunate when I was offered a tulip glass.
S/T: At first, all I got off the nose was fresh cut pine tree, and lots of it. We cut our own Christmas tree down every year, and it was reminiscent of burying your nose at the base of the tree when you're cutting it down. Fresh pine sap and resin. Wow, very aromatic, if not a bit one-dimensional upfront. Certainly not lacking in the freshly-cut pine bough area, which was backed up by some citrusy tart white grapefruit. There were hints of fresh bread dough hiding behind the bold pine notes that had to be coaxed out from their hiding place, as well as spiced peach and apricot notes with a bit more time in the glass. Once the beer was "comfortable" in the glass, estery/floral/grain notes also made an appearance. The last little sip at the bottom of the glass, after warming up, gave off dried tea leaf notes as well.
M/D: While waiting around for the keg to be tapped, I had 2-different IPAs of lesser strength than Pliny the Younger, so my taste buds may have either been warmed-up, or tarnished, depending on how you look at it. To me, this came across as an exceptionally balanced IPA, triple, or not. Yes, it was hoppy. Was the malt present? Of course, but it wasn't too sweet. Is a matter of fact, I would give this tremendous credit for striking such a balance for a Triple IPA, coming in at 11.0%-ABV.
This balance masked the 11.0%-ABV quite well. Yes, you can tell it's up there in alcohol, but it doesn't really let you know it's true nature on the nose or palate. It doesn't come across as being hot at all. If anything, the ABV comes through in the body.
Everyone was limited to one glass, which was probably a good thing, considering the ABV. With that being said, I would not have hesitated ordering a second glass of this to savor, if given the chance. Certainly a memorable tasting experience. 2,866 charactersJonathanG, Mar 07, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -2.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5After countless attempts to get a glass of this in 2011, my diligence was finally rewarded with a couple glasses of the Younger.
A tulip glass sits in front of me with a half inch of egg-white frothy head over an almost iridescent, rich golden orange color body. A light stream of small bubbles cascade up the sides of the glass. Nothing overly-remarkable here as it looks like other quality double / triple IPA's.
A rich, almost concentrated, freshly pressed hop aroma spills over the top of the glass. The pungent aroma of weed along with a good citrus note lingers after a lengthy smell. Very similar to the Elder but a bit stronger. 
The first gulp (have to admit I breezed through the first glass, the second was savored for awhile) fills your mouth with a mix of hops, grapefruit juice, and a mild malt sweetness. A sharp, bitter bite quickly follows, but doesn't linger and there's no sign of the 11% ABV. It seems that this years version is not as malt forward as in the past and tends towards a bit less balanced in terms of flavor. Reminds me of the Elder if it were on steroids.
Low carbonation works well, as it allows for more of the flavor to shine through with a good medium viscosity. Spot on for a beer of this style. What is really impressive about this, given the ingredients and ABV, is how easy it is to drink a couple (or more) of these.
Overall this is a really good triple IPA, but I don't think this years was as good as past, and I don't think that it's worth the hype and efforts to track down a glass. I am glad that RR keeps on making this every year (and changed the growler policy), but there are plenty of others which are readily available that can satisfy the hop enthusiasts out there. 1,725 charactersJoeySchlitz, Mar 06, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow! I had my first Pliny The Younger yesterday at Abbey Pub in Bend, Oregon. I enjoyed it a great deal. There were about 50 people there when Geoff tapped the keg at Noon. At 12:23pm, the keg was empty. :-) 
A - It has a light golden color that's clear with a light white head.
S - A wonderful hoppy smell with pine and citrus floating off the top with floral undertones.
T - Huge hops, piney and dry that finishes with a bitter touch. The alcohol is well hidden in Pliny tradition.
M - Moderate body with a touch of carbonation.
D - I can hardly wait until next year. Thanks Vinnie.

4.22/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Had this on tap at Falling Rock.
Pours a very clear golden,orange color. A small white head drops to a thin crown very fast. Good lacing. Looking at the beer it's hard to imagine the hugh flavor and alcohol it holds.
Nose is very dank. Big pine and some citrus. Resinous with sweet malt balancing in out. Alcohol is definitely present.
The first sip hit my taste buds with a bittersweet and hop oil feel. Really good. Very hoppy with the sweetness of the malt doing it's best to keep things in check. Not as balanced as Elder. The hops do scrap across the palate with the alcohol providing a burn. I love an in your face IIPA so I loved it. The only negative was that as it warmed the alcohol became hot and started to compete with the hops.
Good mouthfeel and drinkability for the style. 8-10oz is enough to satisfy with completely wrecking the palate. 857 characterschicano4craft, Mar 05, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to St. Stephens Green in Phili for my first taste of Younger
A small white head that quickly fades to a small ring that leaves a light lacing on the glass. Great clarity. Pale amber in color. Smell is a conundrum of big fruity hops, underlying honey sweetness. Tons of citrus and tropical fruits. The first sip of this elusive beer was a punch to the face with all sorts of hops. It's slightly sweet, but not what your expeting from a beer with such a high abv. MMM. Mouthfeel is great. Medium carbonation. Long finish with hops being prevalent all the way through. Drinkability is great. I almost chugged my first one in order to ensure I could get a second and did so with no problem. Then I had a third and the Pliny really started to kick in. This is a very exceptional brew and I hope I have the chance to enjoy this one again in the future. Kudos to RR for making this gem and sending it all the way to Phili for us to enjoy. 939 charactersssuggs01, Mar 05, 2011
4/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at O'Brien's.
A - Clear golden yellow colored with a short lived, thin ring of whitish head that lasts throughout.
S - Big piny resinous citrusy hops. Sweet malts and light alcohol come through as it warms.
F/M - Somewhat sweet malts with tons of resinous piny hops. Citrusy, grapefruity hops, but mostly piny. Rather bitter, but with a lingering malty sweet flavor in the end of the dry-ish finish. Moderate carbonation and medium bodied.
D - Pretty good considering its such a huge beer. Tasty, smooth, and huge, but well made. 540 charactersdomtronzero, Mar 04, 2011
4.13/5  rDev -11.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Oskar Blues Longmont
A - Pours a light brown color - almost golden. Very clear, super filtered looking. light white head formation from a good pour.
S - Very dry hoppy note, resinous and piney, some hints of floral hops as well. No malts to speak of.
T - Starts off very light, just a little bit of nutty flavors. Huge huge hops show up, resinous, piney, reminds me of the edge of a gin. Super super dry. No alcohol warmth to speak of. Finishes with a very solid bitter note - sticky.
M - Moderate to sometimes thin feeling beer body. Carbonation comes through a little - stinging. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. Huge oily bitter finish.
D - Uh how do you define this since I can't buy another? ABV is pretty potent - flavors are very abusive to the palette. A sipper in the extreme. Not filling.
A quality DIPA - worth the hype? I don't know - I probably would prefer the elder. Certainly a great usage of extreme hopping. 943 characterskatan, Mar 04, 2011

4.25/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a light orangey amber color with minimal head
Big grapefruit notes on the nose with a light background of caramel.
The taste while cool is dominated by bitter pine hops however as it warms semi sweet grapefruit comes to the front with hints of a very minimal malt presence. Not very complex.
Mouthfeel is somewhat thin especially for a beer sitting at 11%. Carbonation is moderate yet somewhat coarse.
Overall just like elder overly hyped. The beer is solid but far from the best dipa I've had. There are several dipas that are much more easily acquired with much less hoopla than this. I will say that as it warms it does improve significantly. Oh well now I've had it and won't have to feel like I've been missing out. 730 charactersUA8, Mar 03, 2011

A: Light, orangish color. Thin white head that disappeared quickly. Good lacing throughout. Faint carbonation. No bubbles.
S: Mild on the nose. I thought this would smell hoppier, but definitely not overpowering at all. Sweet floral notes. Smell amazing!
T: This is a BEER. Lived up to the hype. Delicious hop character but not over powering mouth puckerer. There is a solid malt back bone. The hop sweetness isn't as bad as other Imperials and Tripels.
M: Good mouth coating hop flavor. Enjoyed a Blind Pig right after and this one definitely was still in the mouth.
D: If I could have had another, I would have had another or ten. Amazing beer. That ABV at 11% does catch up to you, but not right away.
Overall, this was a White Whale of mine and very glad to have tried it fresh from the tap. Delicious, and will definitely search out again at other PA locations that get it out to the public. Hopefully for less than $15 a glass...even though it was for charity. 1,091 charactersinlimbo77, Mar 03, 2011

A: Poured a clear copper orange with slight layer of white head. 
S: IMO this is the best smelling IPA. I could smell this all day. While everyone else was taking pictures of their glass I have my nose stuck in mine! Over the top hops!! 
T: Taste is pretty much what I was expecting. It tastes like it smells. Similar to The Elder but bigger and hoppier. By far my favorite tasting IPA. 
M: Perfect carbonation. Very smooth. 
D: I could and would drink this until I fell asleep. 
 One of the few beers that actually live up to its massive hype. Its bittersweet to finally try this one. One glass a year doesn't cut it though. 810 charactersIdrinkGas, Mar 02, 2011

A- F*cking beautiful. Cant looking any better than this. nice one inch head. slight hazy orange. mouth is already watering
S- smells great, a lot like elder with a fuller smell. very good but not the best. strong citrus and floral notes
T- heres where this bad boy really shines, when Dipas get in the 10% range they start taking on a stronger malty taste. not this guy, very crisp and refreshing. it does taste different than elder. great piny taste with a touch of sweetness. i wish the taste left in my mouth lasted all day. (on a gross note i had the most amazing burps the rest of the day lol)
M- perfect. exactly what you'd like from a good ipa perfectly balanced.
D- cant believe how easy this is drinking, i put away my 2 glasses before i even noticed, suddenly i was trying to get out the last 2 drops to my lips. yes it cant be more drinkable. wish i was not driving
Fantastic beer, if you lucky enough to have a chance to try this guy take it. i think mine tasted even better because i was the only guy sitting at the bar haha. maybe not, part of the fun of the younger is sharing a few pints with other beer folk. was still nice to have this guy more intimately. 1,264 charactersKevSal, Mar 02, 2011

a- thick, cujo-rabbies-like gray head. light-gold body. young's head slowly dissipates, but overall is retained well after a few swirls.
s- resin. douglas fir. mexican vanilla extract. raw honey. alcohol slyly creeps into your nose at the very end. very sneaky alcohol aroma.
t- strong hop flavor. hammered with hops. tastes like pine tree sap, or how i'd imagine that to taste. the raw honey and strong simple syrup notes are immediately replaced by an AMAZINGLY bitter finish that has you actally licking your chops. this pliny packs a punch though. alcohol wallop via strong hop hammer.
m- i had just tasted some firestone walker double jack last night, which had the body and the flavor of an immensely hopped DIPA like Younger, and the comparisons thus far were prevalent; however, what makes Younger an exceptional, elite DIPA is the body/aftertaste. thick, fatty body. the hops have bled into this beer so well that you feel their wieght on your tongue with each sip. the aftertaste blows my mind though. it's so pleasant and delicious and surprising. after each sip, Younger leaves this almost chilled fruit-rind flavor lingering. it's like your mouth after eating the best chilled apple or pear or nectarine. it's unreal actually. it's as my gf says, "it's like Younger ties itself around your tongue like a ribbon refusing to be let go." so true. 
d- as it was one per customer, sitting with this and discovering the degrees of its character, because it's the only glass you'll have, is a truly beautiful thing. not that you wouldn't savor the glass anyway, but with a definite limit, it's very contemplative. with a one glass limit aside, the incredible bitterness, girth in body, and strong flavor probably limits one per sitting even in ideal circumstances.
an elite DIPA. the aromas and flavors are extraordinary, but the mouthfeel and finish make this legend. 1,949 characterspatm1986, Mar 02, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52/28/11 - 8oz pour in to a tulip glass
The color was exceptional, a clear shiny copper color with a thin white head that was only about 1 finger or so that dissipated quickly.
The aroma was full of citrusy & floral hops. A very intense aroma for a beer, but had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other.
Taste was amazing. It was sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice piney note on the end as well.
Mouthfeel was perfect, not too heavy or light, the carbonation was a bit lower than most IPAs, but suited this beer just right. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts & hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness.
This is quite possibly the best balanced IPA I've had even though it's a TIPA. I love the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, this is just one step beyond and much more refined. Excellent beer, well worth the wait, only wish it was more readily available. 1,070 charactersProspero, Mar 01, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 on tap at Khyber Pass Pub
Poured into a tulip. Deep dark golden, possibly a little orange. Solid two fingers of frothy head. Beautiful lace floated down the glass as I drank.
Big resinous hop aroma; pine and a little bit of the sweet citrus aroma.
Flavor was quite sweet as expected, but I felt it could've used a bit more. Honey and caramel were there, but balanced by the sharp astringent bitter finish. I would've liked more hop flavor, not just the bitterness.
Perfect carbonation and medium mouth feel -- pretty full-bodied for the style. 
Insanely drinkable for the style. Was easy to put away this bad boy and a struggle to actually try to savor it. An amazing beer, but there are also other great double IPAs out there much easier to get. Glad I had the chance to try it, though. 797 charactersChrisPro, Mar 01, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5on tap at khyber in philly. served in tulip glass. 
Pours a clear golden orange, nice fluff of white head, patches and wisps of lacing and retention while drinking. 
Heavy dose of pine and citric hops, notes of tropical fruit and apricot, lighter doughy malt with soft hints of sweetness. 
Starkly bitter hops up front, explosion of citrus and grapefruit, followed by sticky resin, pine, and rind. Slowly moves into softer fruit sweetness with lighter tropical notes. Caramel and dough backbone is present but rests underneath the intensely hopped flavor. Crazy amount of lingering bitterness and dryness on the tongue. Soft alcohol warmth towards the near everlasting hopped up finish. 
Creamy medium body, exceptionally smooth on the tongue especially for the style, milder carbonation. Insane level of drinkability for the ABV, I left feeling like I wanted to drink about half a growler of this stuff. The hop profile and crazily balanced flavor is off the charts, and I feel like I can comfortably say that this one lives up to the hype. 1,045 charactersxnicknj, Mar 01, 2011

Taste is excellent and worth the hype. Big, bold beer but with an excellent flavor profile. Strong citrus and resiny hop flavor. Lots of grapefruit with some pine in the background. Good caramel flavor with a perfect malty sweetness to back up the massive hop flavor. Notes of honey as well.
Mouthfeel is very good. Medium body, medium/high darn and very dry finish that leaves a resiny hop flavor.
Drinkability is surprisingly good. Probably too good. Almost no signs of ABV. BIG hop flavor but the sweetness tones it down.

On tap at Stone for the Don Younger toast.
A: Burnished gold and perfectly transparent with a huge frothy white head. Excellent lacing.
S: Monstrous hop aroma, with big pine notes accompanied by grapefruit, orange, and a little apricot. Bright, vibrant, and exceptional. Booze is really well hidden.
T: Deeply resinous with well masked yet apparent alcohol in the flavor. Malt provides a little backing but no evident taste. Lots of pine and grapefruit. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden for the ABV. Great hop flavor, one of the best in the style. Some orange and grapefruit rind in the moderately bitter finish. Overall, the flavor exhibits massive hop influence with a smooth upper moderate bitterness. Never astringent or harsh.
M: Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Mouthfeel is crisp and sticky. This aspect is amazing. Unlike many other Double IPAs that attempt to approach this ABV, it's never heavy on the palate.
Overall: I love this beer, but I think a few others I've had in the last year are just as good. Regardless, this is world class and it was nice to finally try this year's batch with minimal effort. 1,143 charactersHopHead84, Feb 27, 2011

S: Unbelievable. Smells a lot like the other Pliny, but with a little bit of a tropical flare. Lots of piney hops, some mango, apricot and a lot of pineapple. 
T: I was expecting this to just be a bigger version of PTE, but as other have said, it doesn't taste "bigger," just better. The balance in this beer is uncanny. Citrus hops and grapefruit hit the palette first along with a sharp peppery bite and then it gets mellowed by the malts and finishes pretty crisply. It takes all of the rough edges that PTE has and polishes them into a masterpiece. One of the best beers I've ever had.

A: poured a glowing golden orange in color with yellow highlights and had a nice tight finger of head with good retention but left plenty of frothy lacing sticking to the glass.
S: upfront had an incredible hoppy aroma kinda like smelling fresh hops alongside grassy, nice piney, orange citrusy notes and some good sweetness I believe are from the malts but not a very noticeable amount of booze.
T: it definitely had a hop profile second to none which was very clean crispy but with a nice hop punch. It had piney, grassy, candi sugar accents but had citrus grapefruit flavor that helped out the bitterness. Super well balance with just a prefect amount of sweetness coming through to control the hoppy blast.
M: the brew was light to medium in body with a perfect amount of carbonation which had a citrusy, sweet, grassy, piney, hoppy blast, and bitter finish that lingered on the palate; very well balanced
D: very very drinkable with the ABV truly hidden really well in the hop heaven and what has to be one of the best TIPA on the planet. Another west coast hop bomb which is definitely a treat if you can catch up with him. 1,182 charactersGobzilla, Feb 24, 2011

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tasted the beer at the bar. I had to wait in line for about one hour and a half. I then just proceeded to drink two 10 oz younger glasses in almost no time at all. It is really exceptional how easy drinking the beer is for its size.
I later ordered an Elder and a Younger to compare then side by side.
Appearance is fantastic. A hazy orangey color, just a tad more copper than the characteristic yellow of pliny the elder. Under some lights they seemed almost the same color, but when held up, you can clearly see that Younger is a bit more orange. Very nice. It is a little hazy, but I guess it goes with the style and the amount of hops. Not a very large head but it really doesn't matter, the beer was very nicely carbonated.
Smell is wonderful. Piney, citrus hops. I swear this has got to be the best smelling beer ever. Perhaps I like the smell of the Elder just a tad better, just because it is a bit dryer. Nonetheless a LOT of hops and a delicious smell.
Taste is just fantastic. It is impressive how the Younger can make the Elder seem not as good. It really has a nicer, maybe a little more balanced taste. Not as dry, and just as much hop flavor.
Everything was amazing about the beer. The only bad thing is they only make it once a year and I had to travel FAR to get it.
Drinkability is excellent. I would have had more, but did not want to get home without a brain.
The best beer I've had hands down. Really hard to express how this one makes the Elder seem like a normal beer. Although we all know the Elder is also great. I hate to give out a perfect score, but this one just plain deserves it. 1,616 charactersluisfrancisco, Feb 22, 2011

Draft to 12 oz pint
Thanks to Barley & Hops for a great day yesterday!!
App- Was a very traditional IPA color. That medium orangy/yellow color with a very thin 1/2 in head to it.
Smell- Was a bit bigger in terms of of the piney, resiny and hop forward smells I was looking for. Good smelling beer.
Taste- To me this was better than PtE. It was more of a subdued piney, resin taste with a cripsness and bit creamy.
Mouth- A very pleasant medium body with a medium carb level. Left a great hop/piney aftertaste.
Drink- I could drink it all day. Too bad so many people were in line. Better than PtE as I said and I loved it. 646 charactersFosterJM, Feb 20, 2011

App- Straw colored with a slight bit of white head. Dissipates fairly quickly. White lacing left behind.
Sm- Fruity, resinous, pine. Pineapple. Some malt sweetness lurking back there. Amazing.
Ta- Resinous hops, some hop bitterness but the malty sweetness really shines though. Great balance. Very minimal heat.
Dr- Amazing considering the copious amount of ingredients that go into this beer. Everything is well balanced and alcohol is hidden exceptionally well. 
Overall- I would choose this over elder. however, its not so much of a difference that i would go to the ends of the earth to get it. Excellent beer though. 650 charactersgueuzer, Feb 20, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was luck enough to have this 2 days in a row, 2 10z pours at RR and 2 more the next day at a tapping at Bobby G's in Berkeley. All 4 were equally amazing, though nothing will ever match the first couple sips I had at RR. Rarely does a beer live up to the hype, but this one surpassed it for me.
Poured a golden yellow with a thin head that disappeared very quickly. 
The aroma was great, but not amazingly strong. You could really tell that this beer was all hops.
The taste was literally mind-blowing. It's like a hop explosion in your mouth. And all hops, but it a really balanced way, if that makes sense. LIke all of the characteristics of hops you can have in a beer (grapefruit, pine, floral, tropical, bitter) that were all balanced perfectly harmoniously on the tongue and permeating every corner of my mouth. You can't even taste the alcohol.
It has a very light mouthfeel for what I would've expected, and that, plus the extremely great taste, contributes to the danger of this beer because I could easily drink 3 before I even felt drunk. In fact, I could literally drink these all night, or as long until I passed out! In fact, on my 2nd day of Younger, I was drinking with an inexperienced beer buddy, and he enjoyed it so much, he's the one who asked for a 2nd round, not really comprehending the effect of 10.25-11%. He was definitely feeling it by the time we made our way around the corner to Triple Rock.
Overall, I would have to say it surpassed all my expectations, and I will definitely be putting Younger day on my calendar every year for as long as we are blessed with this beer. 1,609 charactersAbyssJunkie13, Feb 20, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this on-tap at Bobby G's Pizzeria before the rush started, major props to the crew there for managing the craziness with calm and a genial attitude.
Pours an effervescent light amber with heavenly white head that laces well. Translucent and a bit cloudy, but bubbles keep rising to the surface, and it gets clearer after a minute or two. Head is pure white, like cloud white, and is a beauty to look at while it lasts. 
Nose is of tons of citrus and malt both, with sticky candy cane sugary character and grapefruit rind all over. Citrus is a blend of mostly sour fruit like lemon, orange, and grapefruit, and although there isn't too much tropical fruit, a bit of pineapple may have reared its head at some point. Aroma was not as strong or diverse as I would have expected, but it was well balanced, and pleasant overall. 
Taste is ridiculous stickiness, with caramel and brown sugar, tons of hop bitterness and citrus all balanced to perfection. Grapefruit, orange and lemon are well represented, but there was surprisingly not much tropical character, maybe a bit of mango if anything. Malt kept everything under control the whole time, as the bitterness threatened to get wild, but never really did. Really one of the best tasting and balanced beers I've ever had, as I've never had something that was so incredibly flavorful yet so balanced. 
Mouthfeel was flawless, as it was smooth and clean, while being full bodied and basically nectar-like the whole way through. Drinkability was even MORE perfect, as I had NO IDEA the abv was 11% until I saw it on this website a minute ago. There is no beer that hides it better than this, and the tempered bitter finish is so well done that you could drink this for hours without any problem.
This beer is not so much a souped up version of Pliny the Elder as it is a different beer altogether. Both are really incredible beers, and both are equals in my eyes. Russian River gets it right every time. 1,957 charactersveinless, Feb 19, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Happened to wander into the Father's Office in Santa Monica, and this was on tap. Score! Had three pours at the bar.
Appearance: A brief white head fades to nothing quickly. Deep golden, almost bronze in color. Appears to be fairly syrupy. Very good clarity.
Smell is good, though not as good as I remember it from the past two years. Big fruity hops, underlying honey-like sweetness. Tons of citrus and tropical fruits. Something isn't quite right, though... there's a hint of something that shouldn't be there. I can't put my finger on it. It's no biggie.
Taste is very good. Punch to the face with all sorts of hoppy goodness. It's slightly sweet, but nowhere near as sweet as you might expect given the strength of the brew. Very tasty.
Mouthfeel is pretty great. Full-bodied, with medium carbonation. Long bitter finish. 
Drinkability is through the roof with this one. I don't know that I can think of another 11% abv brew that is easier to put down. If I wasn't driving I would have had 1-2 more. Superb.
I think last years' version was better. That said, this is still a world-class brew. Kudos to Russian River. I'd sure like to see this around more often... 1,173 charactersdavod23, Feb 17, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5There is no doubt in my mind. For all the talk and trendy tales about this beer, now I understand this to be one of the greatest IIPA ever crafted.
Life's mysterious abundance, got me in the doors of Father Office in Santa Monica right before the mob, and a long quest was finally ended few feet from the bar counter(for an other year:). 
Very much a replica of the Elder in the aroma profiles, the color takes a darker copper orange red tones here. Clear and crisp appearance with a impeccable inch head that is the gift that keeps on giving. Releasing complex Citrus,pineapple,caramel pine essence into your nose, just to prepare you to what I will call "A religious experience" has your lips come in contact with the tulip.
Smooth yet extremely strong mouth feel at the same time. A balance that would make any scale blush. Full body,Average carbonation, inviting hop bit up front but magically metamorphose on your taste buds to open up a vast field of complex hop flavors. 
Definitely more intensity than with the Elder, and great sweet caramel silky consistency that lace down the glass as you watch your new lover disappear sip after sip. I had four in one hour. Just that good and I couldn't resist. Watch out though. 11% is a quick reminder that this one is a triple IIPA.

4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap tonight at Father's Office in Santa Monica. Enjoyed a relaxing 3 10oz pours with no lines, hassles, or assholes.
Pours an orange haze with a thin white head which fades rapidly. Falling face first into a vat of fresh hops and jammed into your nose. Grapefruit, citrus dominates. Hops and more hops, followed by waves of more hops. Ending in a crescendo of... hops. So well balanced, smooth, perfectly bitter and singular like a clarion call. Still hiccuping frothy hops as I type. The ABV is well hidden until it creeps up on you. Wham! Bam!! Hype or no hype, this is an amazing triple IPA. Well done. I'll be counting the days till February 2012. 655 characterswethorseblanket, Feb 17, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I enjoyed this fine brew on tap at the Blind Lady Ale House in Normal Heights at the 5 o'clock release. Taped out in an hour and I was lucky enough to have 2. One in a 10 oz (.25 L) flute and the other in a 10 oz snifter. The first was paired with .4L of Elder. 
Magnificent aroma and was so incredible it put PTE to shame. 
Aroma was extremely citrusy and reeked (in a good way) of simco.
The mouth was very sweet and delicious. A mouthful of pine trees. 
It was worth the wait and can't wait for next year. 512 charactersjoebrewinesq, Feb 16, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Blind Lady Ale House during their Younger vs. Elder event. Poured into a brandy snifter style glass.
A - Just slight darker than the Elder (though could have been since it was a thicker glass). Large 3 finger head was egg shell white and considerably thicker than the Elder. 
S - Came thru very citrusy with just a hint of hoppy sweetness. Slightly acidic burn from the high alcohol mingling with so much hops. 
T - What can be said that hasn't before? This is a wonderful beer with plenty of hoppy kick coming thru a rather thin grain bill - especially considering the alcohol this is a real feat. 
M - Very well balanced with a nice creamy mouthfeel that you don't often find with any IIPA. Fades a little thinner on the back of the tongue. 
D - Crazy good beer, maybe not one that you'd drink every day but there is a reason why I waited 40 mins to get at this. Why they don't make this more often is beyond me - clearly this is a world class beer and I wish RR were filthy rich cause of it. 1,009 charactersDijeriduster, Feb 16, 2011

A: a beautiful light copper orange color.
S: lots and lots of grapefruit hops hit the nose. 
T: the hops are what I taste from beginning to end. Lots of pine and grapefruit overwhelm my mouth. So much hops aftertaste. Minutes of it. I should just wait to see how long the hop aftertaste lasts. 
M: amazing carbonation reallly masks the thickness of this beer. Contributes to it's amazing drinkability. 
D: the 11% is sooo well hidden. I have to slow myself dwn from drinking this one like I would a single IPA. This beer is from a different planet. A planet I want to live on all the time. 616 charactersgregshead, Feb 16, 2011

Just hit up the brewery for the two-week stretch of PTY for 2011
Appearance- Hazy, golden with a white head that dissipates quickly. Some light lacing. Medium liveliness.
Smell- Like that of the kindest bud. Or, so they tell me. Sweet, hoppy, slightly woody.
Taste- Excellent complexity. Starts hoppy immediately, then sweetens, followed by a punch of alcohol heat. Then, it moves back to hops and malt, ending with a huge and extended resin hang.
Mouf- perfect. Easy. Medium bodied. Slightly seltzery.
Drinkability. Heck yes. 620 characters1759Girl, Feb 15, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 Release on release day at RR. This is a transcript of my notes.
My first experience with this beer was last year, and i wasnt reviewing beers at the time. That was the beer that set off this rediculously consuming hobby of mine. This year didnt dissapoint either.
A - Poured from tap into a 10oz imperial looking pint glass. The beer came to my table minutes after the doors were opened on the release day and looked like it glowed. It was as fresh as one could possibly get it. It was a bright, clear glowing orange with a small 1/4 inch head. With such small pours i was thankful for the first time that the head was minimal. 
S - The Smell was incredibly fresh, and mostly smelled of wonderful bright citrus and pine. 
T - Its hard not to think of a fresher better elder with this beer. The middle and finish are what really differed this beer for me. The beer was explosive with hop flavor but was so balanced and never heavy or sticky.
M - The ABV is so well masked in this beer. I never smelled or tasted any alcohol burn. The beer is medium bodied and has great carbonation.
D - Considering i had 4 of these in one sitting, i can say this is VERY drinkable. I paced myself rather maturely and walked out of the brew pub with wife and kid and felt great.
Great Job Russian River for implementing their new policy this year. 1,341 charactersdubinsky, Feb 15, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I finally/actually made it up to the brewery to try out this wonderful offering from the people at Russian River. Served in a 10-oz glass. Moderately carbonated.
A: Brilliant golden honey colored with little head, but topped with lace that clung to the sides of my glass throughout enjoyment.
N: Resinous pine, citrus flowers and grapefruit zest and skunky marijuana.
T/M: Taste follows the nose perfectly, with a sharp kick from the warming alcohol that almost comes off as additional bitterness. The beer goes down so easily, despite the heavy alcohol. It is sweet with the citrus flavors, but almost well balanced. The body is oily but not really as chewy as expected given the hop levels.
Overall, this beer is maybe "not worth the hype"....But with that said, I can easily say this was one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The flavors are so crisp and clean and, for a hop-head, this is a dream in a glass. I wish this were available year round! ...but people really do freak out about this rather than simply geeking out. It compares nicely to the Elder version, just a bit more alcohol--same flavor profile with a bit heavier body and mouthfeel. DELICIOUS! 1,194 characterspeacebone116, Feb 14, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5On tap at the Toronado SF.
A- Pours rusty orange with 1/4 inch of brilliant white head.
S-Piney, resinous hops, grapefruit, weed.
T/M-You'd never peg it for 11%ABV. If you're familiar with the Elder, the Younger is Elder times two. A beer whose hop profile shifts from piney to earthy to tasting like a mouthful of sticky weed, to tangerines and mouth watering bitterness, all held together by vibrant, chewy carbonation.
D-Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome beer. But it's not worth the hype. The way people trip over themselves trying to get their little 4oz sample doesn't add up. Yeah, it's a really good DIPA, but there are plenty of really good DIPAs, and most of them are available for more than 2 weeks a year. 726 charactersDaveHS, Feb 14, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The annual arrival of what many hopheads consider to be the pinnacle of IPA perfection has become more than a mere release, it's an event. Running dry within the first day of tapping the kegs last year taught the good folks at Russian River a few things. This year they switched things up, releasing a limited amount of kegs per day, and not filling growlers for anyone. As they announced on their website: The only way to get it to go is in your tummy! Works for me.
In the dead middle of the week, an hour-and-a-half before quitting time, the brewery was full but not insane. The uninitiate who might have wandered in off the street still might wonder what was going on. Is there a major sporting event I forgot about? The most cursory look around the brewery would shut that line of thinking down pretty quickly though; the only televisions--of which there are two, each no bigger than a desktop monitor--are hung high and out of the way. This is no sports bar; this is a temple of beer.
The young, hipster staff seemed to get a perverse kick out of asking the humble supplicant, once seated, what he wanted to drink. It couldn't be that easy, could it? All I have to say is, "Pliny the Younger," and they'll bring it in a perfectly chilled 10 oz glass? Visions of the Seinfeld Soup Nazi flashed through my parched, hop-starved brain. "No Younger for you!" the server shouted in my imagination. "One year!" Luckily, it was only my paranoia working overtime, and soon the beer was down the pike.
The big board behind the bar lists the Younger at a healthy 10.25% ABV and under Bittering Units it only reads, "Gobs." The brew doesn't disappoint. It pours light orange with just a scrim of head and no lacing. The nose this little bomb throws, however, is heavenly: orange peel, the requisite pine forest, and a more than a hint of killer green bud.
The truly amazing thing about this Triple IPA, is how balanced it is. To me, Pliny the Elder, Russian River's Double IPA, is more aggressively hop forward--not to say the Younger isn't crazy hoppy (as the website reads: Younger is hopped three times more than our standard IPA, and is dry hopped four different times), its just that its sweet malt backbone carries a lot of weight.
As the sun falls behind the storefronts on 4th St. and working folks are released on their own recognizance for another day, a line begins to form outside on the sidewalk. Soon a bouncer takes position at the back door so that no one bum rushes the bar, and after a few of the most perfectly balanced beers I've ever had, it's time for me to head on and give someone else a chance. 2,618 charactersmonkeylovebeer, Feb 13, 2011

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Body is a clear gold poured from draft to about a half-inch head. White foam dissipates pretty quickly to a cap and ring. Leaves trace lacing on the glass, which is motile and does not stick. 
Aroma of light malt, floral and fruity hops--green grass and grapefruit, pine. Somewhat resiny. Hops are present across the palate, and begins with sweet malt and caramel. Mid-palate and in the finish, there is a pleasant hop burn on the tongue. 
Body is medium with pleasing carbonation, producing a very creamy mouthfeel. 
This is a great tasting, pleasant drinking ale. ABV at 11% is well masked by the big flavor. Excellent beer, but should be consumed responsibly. 665 charactersBeerenauslese, Feb 13, 2011
4.01/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.52011 Pliny the Younger: Pale yellow, medium body and carbonation. Smells like pine and grapefruit. Your taste buds are totally shot after tasting this. Intense earthy hop flavors: marijuana-like and resinous. Probably lots of Columbus hops. Not as citrusy as 2010, but the same de-emphasis of hop bitterness and emphasis on hop flavor. Less bitter than Pliny the Elder. And again, the alcohol is masked by the intense hop flavors. Pretty tasty beer -- hard to explain the hype (especially when you think about all the other delicious double IPAs out there), but one of the best. 578 charactersdrummstikk, Feb 12, 2011

Pour: A dark, viscous looking orange color with tiny white bubbles coating the top layer of this beer.
Nose: Sharp piney notes with a hint of citrus hops (pineapple, tangerine, and orange rhind), sweet malts (caramel and slight toffee), notes of alcohol and more hops.
Taste: This changes as it warms but starts with piney hop notes (like PtE), transitions into citrus notes and finishes with a delectably sweet, caramel and toffee based malt and more hints of piney hops. This beer is fantastic, simple and perfectly composed.
Mouthfeel: Thick but not overly viscous, slightly oily but not overwhelming.
Overall: Glad I could have this but won't fly to CA for it. Glad we get it in Seattle :) Cheers to you RR!!! 784 characterswaltersrj, Feb 12, 2011

A: A beautiful clear golden color with a nice foamy head that quickly drops to a few off white bubbles on top of the beer. 
S: Unbelievable. Smells a lot like the other Pliny, but with a little bit of a tropical flare. Lots of piney hops, some mango, apricot and a lot of pineapple. As the beer warms, an earthy smell appears and some bitter hop resins.
T: I was expecting this to just be a bigger version of PTE, but as other have said, it doesn't taste "bigger," just better. The balance in this beer is uncanny. Citrus hops and grapefruit hit the palette first along with a sharp peppery bite and then it gets mellowed by the malts and finishes pretty crisply. It takes all of the rough edges that PTE has and polishes them into a masterpiece. One of the best beers I've ever had. 810 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 11, 2011

My first PtY. Had two glasses around 11:30am (I took an early lunch).
This is one of those few beers that you think about all day. Pours an amazing tangerine. Smell is amazing and the taste is incredible. Like a bolder, older brother of PtE. The mouthfeel is a bit more hearty than Elder. I could have easily had 2-3 more of these (might have ended up on the floor, but hey).
Sure this beer gets all kinds of hype, but after finally tasting it, that hype is well deserved. Well done RR, well done. 546 charactersjamex, Feb 11, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From tap to wine glass
A: Pours a light golden-tan, clear, with almost no head. Little lacing is apparent, the ale appears too dense. 
S: The nose is big, fresh, piny hops. You can smell the sweetbread malts attempting to balance, but the hops are just too big. They carry notes of orange zest, lemon and freshly cracked pepper. Alcohol is noted, but amazingly masked. 
T: Fresh hops hit the palate up front, as expected, but the malt-backbone is much stronger than noticed in the nose. This beer is incredibly balanced, certainly a main reason it's so coveted. Flavors are quite singular and take some time to parse. Hops have plenty of fresh pine, but have layers of citrus notes - grapefruit, orange zest, lemon. Caramel and sweetbread flavors are perfectly flush with the hops. Subtle spicy tones round out the profile, some nutmeg, pepper, coriander. Alcohol is barely traceable, dangerous for the ABV, although a slight warming effect rolls in right at the finish. And that's it - finish is clean, aftertaste quickly vanishes.
M: Of course the beer is rich and viscous, but far from weighty or sticky. Carbonation is perfect and helps wash that short-lived aftertaste. 
D: Simply one of the most drinkable beers in existence. If you didn't know what this was what it was you could throw it back to your favorite drinking game. At least for a few minutes, until you'd figure your beer is spiked. 
I do wish this beer was available more often, but it's become a bit of a beer holiday. I'm sipping this at Toronado San Diego, probably the first tap in SD this year, and the place is packed on a work-day, 11:00 AM. The owner didn't even pre-announce it, just sent out a "by the way" email this morning. 1,711 charactersrand, Feb 11, 2011

PTY arrived in a 8oz glass with a one finger layer of dense white foam atop it. The head bubbled away quickly leaving a small ring around the outside of the glass. The beer is a clear golden orange color, beautiful! The nose is huge citrus and floral notes with a good dose of pine, very nice! The taste. Is. Incredible! Orange, tangerine, and grapefruit play across my tastebuds. The malt manifests itself as a sugar cookie sweetness. The most amazing characteristic of this beer is the balance it exhibits. The ABV is completly hidden. It is the perfect blend of sweet biscuity malt and citrusy, piney bitterness. In a word, exquisite! Mouthfeel is medium with an appropriate level of carbonation. It's creamy, smooth and perfect. Drinkability is over the top. No trace of the 10+ABVis noticeable at all. This beer is the pinnacle of IPA evolution. A must try for any hophead. 903 charactersSideswipe, Feb 11, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is truly excellent and overall essentially a stronger, slightly more intense and richer version of Pliny the Elder, with the same excellent balance of hop and malt, bitter and sweet, full body and easy drinkability. 
It is deep gold or pale amber with a smallish off-white head soon thinning to a foamy ring that eventually diminishes, but leaving nice lace all the way down.
Aroma is a stronger Pliny the Elder essentially, with caramelised grapefruit and pine, some lemon and plum as well as other undefined but rich light fruity character and a raisiny character.
Taste is excellent, a full but balanced character. It has complex balance of warming fruity-raisiny character with some lightly toasted caramelised grain and plenty of spicy citrusy hops including a lightly caramelised orange and grapefruit with some green grass and leafiness. Feel is excellent, again a great balance between a full, slightly oily body and a light lively zestiness. It is not viscous, greasy or heavy and drinkability is high. 1,019 charactersOffa, Feb 10, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The things I will do to taste world class beers!!
Made a 11,000 mile or so round trip from London, UK to Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, CA to be there during 3 of the 14 days of PtY at Russian River. Was in the first throng on Superbowl Day so hello to anybody who also got that little emerald green wristband!! Great organistation here from the Russian River team. Anyway...
No sooner than we were seated (having quickly made friends in the queue) than the magic words "Younger"? were spoken and the beer followed shortly after. 
I will have to start backwards and say the thing that astounded me most about this beer was the drinkability. 
It is so smooth and creamy and the 10.25% ABV announced on the RR blackboard is just SO well hidden that you really do not realise how strong it is.
Even with my poor sense of smell the floral, fruity, piney scent of PtY blew me away as when I had first tried PtE.
I returned to RR for two more days and on my last visit sampled PtY and PtE alongside eachother as I find this helps me to really spot any differences.
That they are close siblings is no doubt but the thing that stood out for me was that I thought PtE had a much drier finish. The bitterness was certainly there but seemed more discreet in the Younger. 
Anyway, mission accomplished, it was nice to meet possibly the most drinkable, the most quaffable beer of all...which it probably shouldn't be? Amazing!!
And my bottles of Supplication and Consecration survived the flight home! Thanks to everybody who made me so welcome in Santa Rosa and RR. 1,555 charactersHabanero58, Feb 10, 2011

Toronado
San Diego, CA
Clear golden orange and tangerine with a very thin head. Leaves some lacing on the glass. A disappointing pour.
Pungent orange and grapefruit hop aromas. Alcohol is hidden in the nose. Typical West-Coat DIPA aroma, but not over-the-top or particularly spectacular. Good, but not great. I expected more. Hop Stoopid and Sculpin have better noses.
Taste is bitter hops, tangerine, and grapefruit with little to no malt character. Simple, bitter and pungent hop juice, which I believe is the point of a beer like this! Alcohol is exceptionally well-hidden. I would not believe this beer is 11% abv. 
Medium mouthfeel. Similar to Elder and Blind Pig. This is the anti-Sierra Nevada Hoptimum.
A fantastically drinkable DIPA. The alcohol is marvelously well hidden. Refreshing and delicious.
A delicious and sublime DIPA, but I don't think it quite deserves its reputation (as the best beer on Earth). It's delicious, but I am convinced I can find year-round offerings (including Pliny the Elder) that are just as good if not better and are far less expensive. Drink it if/when you can find it, but no need to go crazy trying to taste it. 1,169 charactersehammond1, Feb 10, 2011

It pours a see thru 24 karat gold with a small lacing of head around the rim of the glass
I get a hoppy floral smell with tons of citrius and malty aroma.
The taste is full of hops but not so much that its over bearing. Lots of tasty hops with very littler bitterness. Itis just as smooth as the elder with more citrius flavor. The finish is grapefruit and some hop presence minus the bitterness.
To say this beer is drinkable is dangerous at 11%. It goes down smooth and the lack of bitterness helps make this one potent brew. 614 charactersbadboyrsl84, Feb 10, 2011

Almost no head by the time it got to the table, poured a hazy amber or burnt orange. Aroma was very prevalent in the beginning and I got pine, grapefruit, tropical fruit as well as some floral notes. As many others have stated this beer is like a bigger version of Pliny the Elder but somehow it achieves more balance between the malt and the hops. All of that along with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel make this a very drinkable 11% alcohol beer. 494 charactersBeerAmbassador, Feb 10, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was one of the first 20 people in the joint SuperBowl Sunday and thought I might as well order a Younger while I'm here. I mean...everyone else was doing it.
I've had this beer now 5 years in a row and it never disappoints. (Note - I did review the 2009 Younger but I was new to BA then and to reviewing beers. That review was all over the place so I'm going to leave it out of this review. If you want to compare it that bad search my profile)
A - Looks very similar to Elder, the pour was to the tip of the 10oz glass so no head to speak of but the lacing stuck all over the glass from top to bottom. Looks, crisp and beautiful for an DIPA this big.
S - Smells similar to PtE but a tiny bit muted in comparison in regards to not as pungently floral. BUT, the Tropical Fruit and hemp and earthiness coming out of this is fantastic. Smells very balanced. Can't wait to dive in.
T - I've heard Younger referred to as Elder on Steroids which I agree with and disagree with. How could it be on steroids if it's a smoother beer? BALANCE...wow. It's everything Elder is but a bit stronger malt profile to balance out the enormous amount of hops. The Tangerine forward Grapefruit that the Elder provides in citrus is replaced by Younger with Tropical Fruits and I want to say strawberries. There is less pine in Younger than Elder but the earthiness is still present. Similar bitter finish in the end but not quite as much as Elder. If I could give a 6 here I would.
M - Similar qualities to Elder but smoother and easier drinking??? This is a 5
D - In my 2009 review I gave this category a 4 but this year is the easiest drinking Younger I can ever remember having. I could session this beer, and pretty much did as I drank my 3 pours and my wife's 3 pours as well. I could have kept going but she was starting to get annoyed with me.
Final Thoughts - If you can improve upon Elder which near impossible to do, it's been done with Younger. Many similarities but this is more complex and masterfully crafted. There were more "stages" to this beer. I kept thinking to myself...when you get this this level of IPA (10% +) it really can't be crafted any better. Truly world class. Never had a better IPA or beer period. 2,219 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Feb 10, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A friend received a growler in a trade last year and shared it with me. I reviewed the beer when we consumed it, but misplaced my notes. I recently discovered them when cleaning out my beergeon.
Poured into a tulip and served at approximately 50 degrees.
A: The beer has nice clarity and appears to be situated between pale and deep gold. Carbonation expresses itself in lazy bubbles slowly rising through the beer and feeding a weak ring of head. 
S: Pine and vague tropical fruits. A touch of alcohol and maybe some malty sweetness.
T: The beer tastes stronger than it smells. A kiss of sweetness up front; then the vague tropical fruits reveal themselves as mango and passionfruit. These flavors yield for resin/pine and a surprisingly light bitterness.
Something is a bit off in the finish, but I can't figure out what.
M: Medium bodied and not very warming, which is suprising given the big abv. Not as coating and/or slick/oily as other DIPAs, either.
D: Given some of the other characteristics of this beer, I would bet that Russian River constructed this DIPA with drinkability in mind. The beer is unique and doesn't get in the way of being drunk. 
I would love to try Pliny the Younger on tap and wouldn't be shocked if it were a bit brighter, but that is probably not in the cards. 1,299 charactersWadsey, Feb 09, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hit the RR brewpub for lunch today. No lines, just a pleasantly packed pub. I loved how the sever immediately said "What can I get you to drink? Younger?". I'm sure they knew they would be right 99% of the time.
2011 release, on tap at the source. 10oz pour. 10.5% ABV this year.
With so many great reviews on this site, I'll give a fairly relativistic review. DIPA's are my favorite style of beer and Pliny The Elder is my favorite beer hands down. Nothing original there, but that's where I was coming from for my absolute first taste of The Younger.
Poured the expected bright orange, smelled of wonderful bright citrus and pine. At this point I wish the glass was bigger just to take in the sites and smells. Initial flavor is very much like The Elder, but the middle and finish are what really set this beer apart. The beer just explodes on your palate with wonderful hop flavor but never gets heavy or sticky. It shares what I think is the best quality of The Elder, there is "room" in the beer for the distinct flavor to shine. Nothing weighs it down to take away from the drinkability.
As others have said, you'd never believe the ABV on this one. There was maybe one tiny moment, out of three glasses, that I got a bit of the alcohol, but it was fleeting and faded fast.
The last thing that really cements this tasting experience, is sipping from the growler of The Elder that I brought home with me and realizing that as good as a beer it is, it takes a back seat to The Younger.
Hats off to Russian River for their new policy this year. You sure helped at least this beer lover get my chance at Pliny The Younger. Cheers! 1,638 charactersbrotherloco, Feb 09, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drove up seven hours to Sacramento to stay at Abel's (abecall98) in Sacramento this past Friday, then drove another two hours Saturday morning to go to Santa Rosa...all so I could try this beer again on tap at the SOURCE.
Appearance - Given to me in a 10oz glass. After waiting in line for almost three hours, I was more thirsty for water than for beer to be honest. But alas, after seeing this beer, in its beautiful golden hue against the three o'clock sun...I pushed my thirst pangs aside. Slight white head that dissipates relatively fast, but leaves some nice thing lacing.
Smell - Wonderful. People were saying it smelled/tasted more "hoppy" than last year (IMO PtY is more citrus while PtE is more piney/hoppy). I don't know what they were thinking. The massive amounts of tropical aroma were prevalent even before I brought the beer to my nose. Grapefruit, orange, tropical fruits, slight pine, hops, and a malty aroma almost not noticeable due to the sweet tropical fruits.
Taste - I can honestly say, Holy Cow. This beer IS all that it is hyped up to be. Seeing as I drank more PtE oz for oz than any other beer last year, I just can't get over how different this "brother" to PtE is. Such an amazing tropical fruit/citrus quality. I had SO many of these while at the RR pub. I am so glad I went up there.
Mouthfeel - SO creamy, thicker viscosity, decent carbonation, slick, amazing.
Drinkability - If I gave this to someone, had them literally quaff down the beer, and then tell them it was over 10% they would laugh at me thinking I'm lying. This beer, this year over last, seems to me to be just insanely drinkable. Having no alcohol in my system and having this after standing in line for so long I would have expected to get some alcohol taste or warmth. No. Nothing. Utterly amazing. This is my FIRST perfect five I have given in over two years on BA. This beer deserves it hands down. Especially seeing as the most well versed style I know is IPA/DIPA, this beer just outdoes EVERYTHING. I am SO glad I drove up from LA for this. Amazing on tap. 2,067 charactersSpdKilz, Feb 09, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The most coveted beer on earth - finally after all these years!!!!
Had on tap at Russian River Brewery at 11:15 AM - had to get there early before the goods were tapped out! It was well worth the wait! Unsurprisingly, this is a pretty amazing IPA
LOOK - Pours blonde and surprisingly clear with tons of lacing and no head - looks identical to the elder. 
SMELL - Simply Amazing. Perfect pure balanced hop character. Strawberries, pine, grapefruit, orange peel, and earth - no detectable alcohol. The nose on this is by far the best of any IPA i've ever had. 
TASTE - Equally amazing, extremely geared. Starts out fruity, then moves on to licorice, spice and herbal notes and finishes with a sweet but creamy warm alcohol body and a super hoptastic, ultra bitter, dry delicious finish. WOW!
FEEL - Good mouthfeel, a bit on the slick, warm side but not overwhelming...the only quality of the beer that isn't stellar. 
DRINK - Fantastic drinkability for such a huge brew. 
This is an absolutely perfect West Coast IPA - The most telling thing is taking a sip of this and then a sip of Pliny the Elder...It tastes like a lager after this baby! So rich, complex, geared and amazing...one of the best beers i've ever had, and likely the best of the style.

4.83/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A long line forms along 4th Street in Santa Rosa every year about this time. The reason? The annual extremely limited release of Pliny the Younger!
Once again, a triumph for Vinnie Cilurzo! Only available on tap (no Growlers this year), at Russian River Brewing Company they are only serving it in 10-oz pours. Which, given the 11% alcohol, is definitely a prudent approach!
The pours I had were filled to the rim of the glass, leaving only a tiny amount of head to top the rich amber colored elixir. As soon as I raised the glass towards my lips I was assaulted by the hop aroma - pine, citrus, a bit of grass - wonderful! The taste was even better - sweet maltiness perfectly balancing the huge amount of hops. I didn't see a
breakdown of the hops used this year, but it definitely seemed like Cascade, Centennial, and Simcoe were part of the mix. Probably some Chinook too - as Vinnie once put it on one of The Bistro's Double IPA festival's listing of beers and what hops were components... "gobs" of them are used! :-)
Russian River is allocating the Younger a few kegs at a time at their pub this year - it should be available for another 12 days if they have figured their schedule correctly. It will also be available at select establishments in California and the West. If you see it, grab it - I've tasted a lot of fine Double/Imperial IPAs in my time, but none of them surpass Pliny the Younger!
[Note: Unless you can get in line early enough to get seated when the doors open, you'll probably be better off waiting a few hours. I was in line on Saturday (2nd day of release) at 11:45 and got to a table around 2:30 - you can sit as long as you like once seated, so tables from the initial rush were slow to turn over.
Was it worth it? Let's say I'd do it again, but probably show up a few hours later so the initial turnover had happened.
Or else show up on Superbowl Sunday. I swung by the pub around 4:30 Sunday afternoon and was able to walk right in, get a couple of Younger's, and grab a table without a problem. Worth keeping in mind for next year.] 2,073 charactersbauers, Feb 08, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was there at the 2011 debut. Simply an outstanding, world-class beer. Floral, pungent hops without the bitterness that so many have unfortunately associated with "good" IPA. Well-balanced and obviously carefully crafted, this is a distinctly American beer. And one to be proud of. Well done Russian River. Oh, and watch out because that 10%+ ABV will sneak up on you...
Finally, the Russian River staff and patrons couldn't have been friendlier or more welcoming. Rock on. 475 charactershopmonkey, Feb 07, 2011
4.99/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Consumed on tap at the brewery on release day 2/4/2011.
This glowing honey-amber liquid was served in a 10oz nonic glass. I wouldn't expect much of a head on a pour like this but what thin collar is there left great sheets of lacing down the glass. The smell is just the most wonderful bouquet of sweet floral, fruity and piney hops. This goes for the flavor as well. Overall the hops are full of fruit nectar, honey, and a touch of grapefruit and pine bitterness. Elder is a little bit more potent in the nose, with a bigger blast of grass, pine, and marijuana, but Younger is more fruity, sweet and nectary. The bitterness for this beer is also so well integrated, and it doesn't overwhelm or fatigue the palate at all. 
The mouthfeel is everything I want in a beer. This is crazy smooth! There is NO trace of alcohol, and this is a 10.5% beer. Nor is this beer heavy, syrupy or thick. At all. The carbonation is just perfect, and one could quite literally drink this all day. By far this is the best mouthfeel on a beer I've ever had. Basically, this is one of the world's most easy-to-drink beers, and definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. Well well well worth the hype!
EDIT: Consuming this beer during the weeks of the 2012 release solidified this beer as my favorite of all time. There are many other amazing beer in this style and others, but this beer is the best. I love you Vinnie, I love you Russian River! 1,431 charactersscottfrie, Feb 06, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I could smell this baby before I even had a chance to step into the brewpub. Aroma of pine and citrus waft out from the door. The aroma is enticing and I had to smell it for 2 hours while I waited to get in!
Finally got a chance to try this bad-boy, and it is exactly what I expected. It's Elder on steroids, yet just as smooth. Smell is slightly muted in comparison, I believe. Still a nice burst of pine emanating from the glass and into my noseholes. Although the ABV is hard to taste, I can feel it creeping up on me as I finish the glass. 
Tastes like a maltier, thicker Elder. It's more balanced, and doesn't have quite the same dry mouthfeel. 
Although this is a great beer I feel that I don't need to have it more than once. Then again, I'm not much of a fan of big ABV beers. I'll have a Gaffers bitter instead, thank you. 834 charactersEstocker, Feb 06, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Went to Russian River's brew pub on the second day of release in 2011. 
On tap poured into a 10 oz nonic glass. Clear orange color that glows even in dim light of the pub. The bartenders were pouring to the brim of the cup, leaving only some soapy surface head, but straight out of the tap, the beer pours with about a finger's worth of head. Decent lacing despite the small amount of head as you drink from it. Little to no carbonation visible through the glass, other than some bubbles forced from swirling through the glass. The way the Younger glows is impressive though. 
I was feeling a bit congested, but the aroma coming from the glass after it was brought to our table was impressive. Grapefruit, pineapple sweetness with citrus peel, and wet pine aroma powered through my stuffy nose. Excellent balance of sweet and bitter hops. 
Taking a sip, it follows the nose, sweet grapefruit, pineapple, and peach, bitter citrus peel and pine. A little bit of biscuit sweetness mid tongue and finishes very dry with a long lingering citrus and floral hops on the tongue and back of the throat. Medium bodied with a good amount of small bubble gentle carbonation prevents any type of syrupy mouthfeel that may occur with an 11% abv beer. Alcohol is non existent and I was able to drink three 10 oz pours in about 1.5 hours without even thinking about it. In this case, the hype was worthwhile. 1,395 charactersnataku00, Feb 06, 2011
4.91/5  rDev +5.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pliny the Younger is the beer to get on tap. As an IPA drinker I am always skeptical of an IPA that gets a lot of lip and press; however, this is one of the best beers I have ever tasted. As a fan of Dreadnaught from Three Floyds, to Sculpin from Ballast Point, the Younger is a truly notable beer. Color is lacking only in the sense that I appreciate a more copper-colored IPA. You cannot beat the smell. It is a scent of heaven, both floral and fruity, and with the taste you get a hint of pine. The hops are indescribably fresh, crisp, and dry. In the event you have the luxury of making it to the Russian River Brewery for this annual beer unveiling, get there early and enjoy the ten ounce pours. 701 characterspaylay32, Feb 05, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Growler shared by Grabbin2nd (thanks RJ) on 2/9/10
Poured out a nice and clear amber color. A white head emerges made up of tiny bubbles. A ring around the glass is left once the head settles. Swirling brings the head back for a bit but settles back to ring. This looked a lot like the Elder to me. No lacing down the glass.
A lot of citrus with resinous pine backing that up. A lot more citrus than found in Elder. Citrus is mostly grapefruit but some other tropic fruits possibly there. I love the smell on this and it is very strong. There are some floral hops and a bit of alcohol but not enough to replace the citrus.
Taste is the same as the smell. Tons of citrus and hops coming through. For me it has all the aspects of the Elder with the addition of a lot of citrus. There is a bit of an alcohol bite toward the end of the swallow but this taste amazing and is what I was hoping it would be.
Not a lot of carbonation here (perhaps some loss from the growler?) but it isn't as thick as some other Imperial IPAs that I've had. I like that it's not super thick however. As mentioned in the taste, there is a bit of an alcohol bite but overall this went down very smoothly.
This was a great experience and I'm very thankful for getting to try it. I would love to go get this on tap at Russian River when it is released but hopefully I'll be able to get to try this somewhere down south for 2011. 1,405 charactersSwimsum, Jan 04, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Apearance - Hazy golden copper with a 2 finger white head with medium retention and awesome lacing.
Nose- Candied grapefruit and pine. Floral and spicy. Strong aroma, but not off putting, in fact, quite the opposite.
Palate- Strong enough malt back bone to support the amount of hops. Sweet start, hop flavor middle, balanced finish.
Mouthfeel- Very light for its ABV and well carbonated. Crisp.
Drinkability- I, like so many others, could drink this all day.
Overall- Well worth the trip. I will be back next year. 520 characterswknight167, Jan 03, 2011

A - Pours a nice slightly hazy golden color with a nice little eggshell white head that sticks around fr a bit and leaves some nice lacing on the glass.
S - THE BEST aroma I have ever experienced with an Double IPA. Just an incredible wave of fruity, grassy, floral hops which really blow you away. There is some slight sweetness from the malt background.
T - Just a big hit of fresh, fresh, fresh pine and citrus hops. Very nice malt backbone with all the hop intensity going on. Extremely well balanced and I just cannot get over how fresh everything tastes.
M - Very refreshing and crisp. Bitter, but the tyoe of bitterness you want in this beer. Medium bodied and slightly chewy.
D - I really think the perfect Double IPA would have the aroma of Younger with the taste of Elder. Just another amaxing IPA from RR and one that I am extremely happy I got to try. Could easiily drink this all day no matter how much my tastebuds get assaulted. So incredibly drinkable even fr being 11% ABV. 1,218 charactersKAP1356, Dec 02, 2010

S-Some nice fruit and floral hop aroma. Then some nice caramel and vanilla, a touch of pine hops as well. A little hint of copper metallic aromas as well.
T- Soft citrus fruit and sweet caramel initially then some great pine flavors come through. More fruity orange flavors come through the pine with hints of caramel and vanilla, then another burst of dry pine bitterness. The beer finishes sweet and juicy with some lingering dry metallic flavors.
M- Light bodied with a great refreshing juiciness to it. Hops cut through with some nice dry bitterness and balances things out.
Overall I would say this beer is way over hyped. Give me the Elder! 781 charactersbr3wmeister, Nov 14, 2010

Maybe I'm just sobering up from that strange mid-afternoon event, held on Monday of all days. Fresh bursts of pine cones and grapefruits on the nose, with a lingering sweetness. Orange body, slightly darker than its elder kindred. Just such a wonderful flavor, an explosion of the aforementioned, more candi sugar than the Elder, swirling lighter fruits mingle into an extraordinarily balanced, large, and impressive IIPA. Not the grapefruit peel wonders of Dreadnaught, but an exceptionally balanced utter assault here. 616 charactersJAXSON, Oct 31, 2010
4.55/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5From (brief) notes:
Beautiful copper color with light head receding to solid and persistant lacing.
Smells of citrus and pine. Strong aroma taht you certainly don't have to stick your face into, but want to. Complex.
Tastes like hops up front. Citrus, pine, very resinous and then the backbone kicks in and lays the foundation for a looong and deliciously balanced finish.
Mouthfeel is superb. Lightly sticky, but not detractingly so. Fills the mouth with a silky layer of flavor that stays.
Kills it on drinkability. As drinkable as any regular ipa I've had. Just stupid easy. This really is the magic here. Such a big strong beer and flavor experience but I could drink this waaaay too quickly and easily.
Excellent. 722 charactersoregone, Oct 26, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5How have I not reviewed this beer? I had it three times this past year on tap, and after recently having Hop Suey on tap, I looked back to my review to see how the scores matched up. Huh. Back to the notes for my review!
Appearance: Every time I've had this, it never looked like it was going to knock your socks off. Just a touch past goldenrod towards the brown side, but very, very light for the ABV. White head holds well, laces well, and carbonation level is appropriate.
Smell: Much sweeter than initially expected, but still a very hopped-up nectar. Fruity, grassy, floral, and citrusy notes are all there, with the sweetness from the malt definitely holding its own. Hey, you don't get to 11% without some malt, but the hops do their darndest to hold their own.
Taste: Initial hop bitterness is pretty big, but met with a strong helping of malt, only to be bumrushed with more hoppiness and finishing with an incredibly balanced attack. 11%? What 11%? No booze to speak of anywhere. Citric, grassy hops both take turns laying the lupulin wood to the tongue, but are always met with a good malt backbone. My dad, who doesn't like IPAs, really dug this beer. Which is saying something about the balance. With the amount of hops, the balance is extraordinary. I cannot believe how well this beer fuses together, it really is astonishing. Far from a straight hop-bomb that some make it out to be, I've had much less balanced 6% IPAs. 
Mouthfeel: Bitter, but not resiny or tough to handle. In fact, I was expecting more punishment from the amount of hopping, but far from it. Just very well done all the way around.
Drinkability: Never has an 11% beer gone as quickly as it does here. It really blows me away how well the booze is hidden. I had 30oz one sitting and kept saying how the booze just never showed up, until I stood up and realized that indeed, the ABV is as advertised. A wonderful, fantastic beer that I wish were available more often, but the rarity makes it a treat. Is it better than Pliny the Elder? Tough to say. Pliny the Elder is the DIPA all other DIPAs are judged by. This beer is the same for the IIPA: the one that all other IIPAs will be judged against, and for good reason. The balance, flavors, and overall tastiness are truly remarkable. 2,274 charactersnomomentwasted, Oct 18, 2010

Pours an amber yellow with nice white head that dissipates but leaves good lacing.
Nose is big with pine and floral notes, I like it over the more common overwhelming grapefruit of most west coast IPAs.
Taste is superb! What PtY is most notable for is what's missing. There are no defects in the flavor of this beer, no cloying sweetness, no stale hops or pungent maltiness. Can't stand Imperial IPAs that are syrupy or reek like barleywines. 
Mouthfeel is moderate, not nearly as heavy as any other 11% beer I can name off hand. Thanks, Vinny, for making it so damn drinkable. A half gallon disappears fast.
PtE from the growler is the best beer I've ever had and keeps its crown, but the mighty son is a very close second. My bucket list certainly includes visiting RR in person to have PtY directly on tap. 900 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Oct 02, 2010
4.59/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have had this several times on tap and once from a growler. This rating is from 2009's growler (notes from the time). Pours with a small white head that fades over a golden body. Even after over a week this still leaves pretty decent lacing. Aroma is sticky gooey pine and citrus hops with earthy and spicy notes as well. Caramel and alcohol also back it up. Hops are straight up Simcoe and Centennial. Very clean, hop first taste with citrus and floral that blends to a sweet caramel and only slightly alcoholic finish. A touch of bitter orange liquor as well. Some pineapple too. This is a great example of hop goodness at its best. Smooth mouthfeel, light bubbles. 
For every time I have had this, I find the Elder to be the better of the two. The balance of PtE is exceptional! 783 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 09, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the Bistro double IPA festival (finally, finally putting my notes down into a review).
PTY is pretty much the product of PTE going east. Let me explain...
You get very similar notes in PTY as with PTE, but its just darker, sweeter, stickier, and more malty/sugary. To me, this is a perfect version of a high octane east coast DIPA/TIPA. I love the stickiness, I love the malts, and I love how the sugars just balance the hops. It reminded me of Hopslam a bit. If PTY toned down a bit, and maybe had a slightly different hop profile, it would be pretty damn similar to Hopslam. Then again, what do I know 615 charactersteamizm, Aug 28, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I got this on tap at Pi Bar here in San Francisco.
I had to try me some and find out what all the rave was about.
SO ya, pretty darn good! Some strong citrus and pine action happening to this beer. The booziness is more apparent in this beer, but that is somewhat expected in a 11% beer. Overall (if you're a hop head) a very smooth, drinkable beer.
I personally wasn't blown away with though, honestly. My personal opinion as far as why this beer is highly rated is due to how scarce it is, the hype people create from it, as well as how its older brother Pliny the Elder has left a legend in craft beer history pretty much. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent double/triple IPA, but I think Pliny the Elder is better and enjoyable to drink.

Was a nice amber in color with a good two fingers of foamy head. Lacing was good
Smell is what you expect from a top flight IPA. Grapefruit, floral and the slightest bit of sweetness
Taste is off the charts. Should be a 5.5 for this one. Like chewing on Hops, and lives up to every bit of the smell.
If I could drink this one every day, I would. Too bad it's so hard to find on this coast.
Edit: I've had this a few more times since this review. Taste is still amazing, but dropping overall to 4.5 Experience is a lot of the beer to me, and the experience has been less than stellar the last few times. 733 charactersBeerThursdays, Aug 09, 2010

Went to PtY release on Feb. 5th...Waited in line for 3 hours and was lucky enough to get a couple glasses for my girlfriend and I along with 3 growlers before they sold out an hour after we got there. Appearance was a bit darker and more amber color than Elder. Not a big head with incredible lacing. The smell is mind-blowing...I walked around my house with a an empty growler of it up to my nose during the Super Bowl (that's how amazing it smelled.) It's like the Elder on steroids. The taste is like no other beer in this world. So much pine, floral, sweet caramel, citrus, and hop notes....you can't get more complexity in an IIPA. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy... with SO much drinkability. I can't believe how fast I consumed high quantities of this beer. Can't wait for 2011 release! 807 charactersDovaliHops, Jun 22, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was sadden when i heard that Russian River sold out of this beer in the first 8 hours. Frantically I called up every local beer bar in with in an hours drive of Santa Rosa, and found out that Toronado would be tapping a keg in a week at a special Russian River 'tion night. The first sip was very magical and I knew that it was worth the trip. The gobs of hops are not over whelming like you would first expect. I think the bitterness is so intense that your taste receptors just shut down. The 11% alcohol sneaks up on you like drinking a glass or two of really good wine. You get a nice buzz going on, and you do not feel full or bloated from drinking a few pints, since they serve this to you in 8 oz. pours. That was probably one of the greatest nights in my life, until a week later I found out that RRB had a top secret keg of this stuff still available. I noticed a difference in the taste just by the Younger aging only a week, it wasn't as crisp and intense as I had remembered. Although it was still a great beer to drink. That night I had 3 glasses of Younger and a basket of beer bites. I would pay $100 any time to be able to have that night again. It was one of the best meals i have ever had. 1,209 charactersAndrewCalvi, Jun 20, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4It doesn't take a beer geek to recognize excellence. I had this beer once on tap one upon a springtime in Seattle, on my first visit to the Stumbling Monk. I'd never heard of Pliny at the time but since it was the strongest IPA on tap I requested it. The bartender didn't really play it up, so I was amazed when I got the beer in front of me. The luminous golden cup in front of me bore a heady, floral aroma of citrus and conifer. I remember really tasting the grapefruit in it, and being impressed by both its richness and balance. After a beer this strong I wouldn't usually feel like another one, but this was an exception. I knew at the time that it was easily the best beer I'd ever had, and I haven't found a better one since. The Holy Grail of IPAs. 757 charactersSchmit, Jun 19, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Capones (9oz). Enjoyed with Leafs93 and Damico. Pours an amber orange color, clear, with a thin head. Has an aroma of pine and grapefruit. This was definitely worth the anticipation. Has a great taste, creamy smooth balance of bitter and sweet. Notes of citrus. I think what separates this imperial from other imperials is the creaminess. I love the harsh hop bitters in imperials but the complex flavors here are balanced so well to reduce that harshness. Which is likely what makes it so appetizing to so many beer fans. I will not say it is the best beer I have ever had. But it is near the top of my list. 619 characterschalsk, Jun 16, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52010 version. 8 oz glasses at O'Brien's, 1st keg of the season only a couple weeks after it was released. Waiting in line for about 30 mins, keg was kicked in 10 once they started pouring. 
Outstanding - perfect blend of hops characteristics and amazing drinkability for being 11%. Tried side-by-side with Pliny the Elder, and this definitely has quite a bit more character to it. 
A - pours a nice golden color, fairly small off-white head
S - outstanding dry-hop aromas, lots of citrus and pine. 
T - great taste, the hop flavors blend perfectly
M - slightly syrupy as you would expect for the style, moderate carbonation
D - outstanding drinkability - if I drank this blindly, I wouldn't guess it was anywhere close to 11%. While it is very bitter, the different hop characteristics are blended perfectly that it is very drinkable. 836 characterscbanker, Jun 03, 2010
4.67/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ Monk's Cafe during there Russian River event. There was a line outside about 30min before the bar even opened at 11am. By the time the bar opened it was over 60 people long.
Poured a golden orange that seemed to glow in the tulip glass, leaving a swiss lacing. The smell of piney, citrusy, hops, was overwhelming. There were 6 beers on tap from Russian River and everyone started with the Younger and the smell of hops was in the air. The bitterness was unlike any DIPA I have ever had, an assault on the taste buds. Easy drinking too, even though I didn't to finish it so I sipped it 
I know the Younger and Elder are 2 different beers, but to compare, I actually prefer the Elder, for the balance of it, usually I like my beers the hopper the better, but the Younger could use a little more malt, I guess thats where the Elder comes in. Either way a spectacular 874 charactersbonbini26, May 28, 2010
3.95/5  rDev -15.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5It smelled VERY strongly of hops. My nose is not fancy enough to decipher the different scents - to me, it was just super hoppy. It was light amber/gold, with no real head to speak of. It was sweet and watery when sipped, but had a syrupy feel on my lips afterward. It was nice, sweet, and subtle. Overall, the first half of the glass was really nice. However, after that...it just stopped being all that great. Maybe the hops killed my palate, I don't know. But it's not a beer I would drink a lot of. 502 characterspennywhistle, May 25, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage. 
Pours a golden orange with red hues and a small off-white head. 
The aroma is a bit shy at first, but looses up after a while. fruity exotic hop notes of grapefruit, peaches and mango. Then, a more peppery and piny hop character with hints of tobacco takes over. Quite a lot of caramel malts is present, as well is a hint of alcohol. 
The flavor is big and intense. A wide range of flavors are present: sweet and sticky caramel malts at the base, and lots of layers of fresh hops. Exotic fruits, pine-needles, grass and resins. The finish is spectacular with a quick flare of warming alcohol, lots of bittering hops and hints of grass and peaches. 
Full-bodied and sticky with a semi-dry finish. 
This is a great beer. Better than Elder? Hard to decide, but the accentuated sweetness in this one sure makes them different. 842 charactersricke, May 21, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I got to try this for the first time in my life amidst a mass of beer geeks clambering over the taps at Blue Palms in Hollywood like brokers at the New York Stock Exchange. Luckily I was able to try it again 2 days later at Father's Office in Culver City where it was CONSIDERABLY lower-key, and where I easily got to order 2 glasses (the Blue Plams keg kicked in 7 minutes) and found a seat where I could sit and sip in peace.
It was hard trying to be unbiased considering the enormous hype surrounding the annual release of this "Triple"(?) IPA, especially considering my pre-existing love for overly-aggressive hops in beer. So bear that in mind regarding my write up and rating:
Served in a 14oz tulip glass (dang, just realized 2 glasses of that was a good amount of hooch!), PTY pours with a very attractive, hazy gold-yellow hue and a fine, robust and slightly frothy head.
The NOSE was - not surprisingly - chalk-full of pine, bright grapefruit and white pepper that almost jumped up and tickled your nose.
As far as the TASTE is concerned...11% is not supposed to be this refreshing. The punch-you-in-the-mouth hops and citrus are prominent on the front end. It's safe to say that the characteristic yet subtle caramel/malty balance that most DIPA's share is easily muted, here (not gone, just being wallflowers...they know their place), making the finish seem more like you were drinking a fresh-hopped, 7% rather than what you KNOW you're drinking...
Unlike most high ABV IPA's, Pliny the Younger has a very crisp, lightly carbonated and effervescent MOUTHFEEL that's not at all sticky, aside from a slight residual resiny tinge and a robust, lingering herbaceousness in the FINISH that is reminiscent of having taken a hit off of an ice cold cold bong about 30 minutes earlier. Seriously...there are a lot of hops in here.
Damn.
All I can say is this: this is a fantastic DIPA in it's own right, but by no means would I call it "The Best." There are more balanced IPA's out there; even those that showcase hops better. That being said: I have to admit that, in lieu of the drikability vs ABV quotient, I'd have to say this is the best/most dangerous high-alcohol IPA I've ever tried. Huge alcohol without being overly sweet or boozy. You've been warned. 2,272 characterswhiskeysoda, May 20, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Toronado, San Francisco
Smell:grapefruit, pine, a little floral, the hops fill your senses with delight
Taste: Sweet, grapefruit, pine, slight spicy hints. Hops, hops, and some more hops. what was most surprising was the balance. incredible balance. The bitterness takes control of you but does no overpower. Similar to PtE but less harsh. 11% ABV but tastes like 6. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation
Drinkability: I could drink this all day, or until the 3rd glass when I fall over due to intoxication. So So drinkable due to the incredible balance. 
Amazing brew, definitely the best beer in its class. A must for any hophead out there. Its a shame they only brew it once a year, but im sure my wallet appreciates that... 756 characterskylegillick, Apr 30, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review from notes taken on 3/20/10 during TJ's: Younger and Elite friends event.
Presented in a 12oz snifter, served a bit too cold but was enjoyed throughout a long enough duration to let it warm up to an acceptable temp. Younger appears a little hazy golden yellow/orange-like color with a white creamy head. Slick amount of lace clings to the glass in a wall at places and legs droopy along other parts. The aroma of this beer has a piercing amount of hops. It is like a frontal assault of awesomeness in the form of scents and smells. Fruity nose of grapefruit, citrus, and a sweetness almost like cotton candy. Taste is a blend of the same malty sweetness reminding me of smooth cotton candy meets a ton of floral-like and super flavorful hops. Partially grassy and spicey and as it warms there are notes of bubblegum that comes out in the nose. For 11% seriously where is the alcohol? The presence of alcohol is noticeable in both warmth and taste but relatively compared it is so minor, smooth and just unlike any other beer I've had at over 10 abv. This beer is so hoppy but it is a flavorful hoppy not just all bitterness. Medium to light feel with a moderate amount of carbonation. This beer is so drinkable, I would love to have more but I am thankful and appreciative that we are limited to one serving. Slightly acidic in the finish with the way it starts to burn the back of the mouth/throat. 
This was my second experience with the younger. The first time I had it was a month prior and I refused to take notes and just savor every sip. There is an evident change in this beer from just a month of time passing. However, overall this beer is absolutely awesome and a must try. For the greatest enjoyment and complexity of the experience, it should be enjoyed as fresh as possible. 1,797 charactersstakem, Apr 27, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Source/Serving: Growler fresh from the brewery. It was insanity!
Smell: the intensity is incredible. Deep, rich, wonderful grapefruit flavors...though significant orange is present as well. Incredible floral notes as well...like burying your nose in a bouquet of alstroemerias or lillies. Amazingly it also smells like a rich, deep pine forest. There is so much going on you might not see the forest for the trees! There is a faint note of sweet malts even when cold - honey mostly - but caramel too...and being detectable under the hops is amazing. There is a nice musty, herbal roundness that adds interest. Tastes this side by side with Pliny the Elder and it tasted dull...amazing.
There is a misty, physical quality to the nose as well....the air feels think like it is over hot tea or soup.
Taste: The first tastes are quite sweet....thick, viscous, and oily Younger hits the palette with honey and caramel goodness. These mingle beautifully with grapefruit peel bitterness which is quite intense but not crushing at all. It's a pine hop explosion. The thick, oily mouthfeel makes it feel like your drinking the nectar of the gods. Its so heavy but retains its freshness and crispness.As much depth and complexity in the malts as the hops, bisquity and bready. Just before the finish there is intense but smooth grapefruit and grassy bitterness at the back of the throat that is accompanied by floral, honey, apricot, and some spicy notes. No hint of alcohol...so drinkable its insane. Finish is quite bitter, resinous with some spiciness and lingers forever.
This beer is balance, balance, balance. Not too sweet like Dogfishhead 120 was for me and not crushingly bitter like some of the Stone brews. 
Notes: Taste this side by side a pint of Pliny the Elder. Elder had more lemon, more brown sugar, and more bitterness. 1,832 characters4000qtrap, Apr 25, 2010

Incredibly well balanced with sweet hops, herbyness, skunk goodness, honey and citrus. This is 11 percent? It goes down so easy. Reminiscent of a blend of the best parts of our other favorite IPAs without the parts holding them back. Delightful. 267 charactersbobjonesSD, Apr 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this at the local 44.I felt very fortunate to have the opportunity to try this and even more so to have it in a nice peaceful local with not that many people. I've read some of the reports of PtY madness at other tappings.
From memory: What can I say, It was the smoothest, best balanced beer I've ever had. The smell was intoxicating with tropical fruitiness and some nice hops right off the bat.
Taste was less hoppy that Pliny the Elder or just better balanced ? Could not tell that it was 11% abv. Mouthfeel was not very heavy but not weak by any means. Just really an incredible experience.
I just can't wait to have it again someday ! 647 charactersgafferjohn, Apr 15, 2010

A: Poured a pale apricot with a very nice, fluffy white head with loads of lacing as it goes down.
S: Bitter hops apparent from the beginning. Mostly tropical--mango and pineapple, mostly--alongside some grapefruit and other citrus notes. Not an iota of malt sweetness in the background.
T: Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot come from the hops. Apparently I need a hop break, as this one was bitter, but I didn't detect it much at all. The bitterness really complemented the fruitiness of the beer. Interesting "fruit" character, as the hops provided plenty of fruity characteristics without any actual sweetness.
M: Medium bodied, fairly dry, and good carbonation.
D: Amazing that I finally got to try this one after having so many things fall through this year. Looking forward to having it again next year, when I may just have to go straight to the source. 926 charactersThorpe429, Apr 04, 2010

4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5(Review from longgg backlog of notes)
Draft pour into a 9 oz snifter. I was lucky enough to have the Younger a few times this year and each time I paid for it, it was right around $8. The hype that surrounds this beer is maniacal... although it is definitely warranted. Sixtels kick in 15 minutes flat.
A: Pliny the Younger pours with an average size head. It is creamy, foamy, stark white & long lasting. Lacing is a notch above good. The light golden orange body is predominantly clear with just a touch of haze. (The last experience I had with this beer was the 66th of around 70 pours and was extremely hazy.) 
S: Average level of maltiness for a DIPA, sweet sugar cookie, lightly toasted. The malts are as present as they need to be to avoid being completely overshadowed by the relentless hops. The hops are insanely juicy and sweet, heavy handed in the citrus department (pink grapefruit first, mandarin orange second) & backed up by healthy levels of pine aroma. 
T: Additional tropical flavors come through in generous portions: Clementines, peaches and pineapples. The flavor duration is long, with moderately high sweetness and hop bitterness in perfect equilibrium. No shame in a small amount of the 11% ABV coming through.
M: The mouthfeel is medium-full with just the right amount of lively, spritzy effervescence to cut through the sweet/bitter combination and almost completely offset any warming alcohol. The carbonation literally captivates every taste bud on the tongue, front to back, except for those enormous ones all the way in the back, it skips those.
D: Speaks for itself. 1,604 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Apr 02, 2010

Pliny the Younger- Imperial IPA & 10.75%. It poured a golden vitamin pee yellow with a touch of white cream for a head. It smelled of lemon, lime peel, pine, grass and hops. It tasted surprisingly sweet with a bitter grapefruit peel on the back of the throat. It left my mouth tingly and dry. 426 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at TJs in PA for the pouring event. After PtE, Supplication and Consecration (hour or so rest for my palate), how could my day get any better? Served in a snifter at 4PM, I was #14 on the list and showed up 15 minutes before they opened, awesome. The beer is golden-copper with a nice ring and very sticky suds. Light lacing is left and a really cool looking cloud stays in the middle of the beer for the entire experience. Smell is right up there with the best hop aromas for me. I homebrew but still don't understand how to extract hop notes like this. The hops lend citrus, tons of floral and earthy, fruity and pine to a balance of greatness. There is some malt in the background (11% ABV!) and it balances the aroma to perfection. I have rarely had a 10%+ beer with no alcohol in the aroma, impressive. The taste is also one of the best. First off, while sipping on this for probably over an hour, no alcohol ever came into play, ridiculous. The hop profile is once again very earthy and floral and also citrus and fruity. Even some herbal notes come through. A nice malt backbone helps the beer become whole. The malts are like a very good homebrew wort to me and go in nicely with the hops. Mouthfeel was moderate-heavy with great low-medium carbonation that I prefer in huge beers. A really nice warmth hits the tongue along with the perfect amount of bitterness. The creaminess in the feel was very nice. At $6.25 per glass and 11% ABV, this is probably the most dangerous beer I have come across. The drinkability is frightening. I could session this and think it was 5-6% at most, vastly impressive brew. 1,622 characterscbutova, Mar 22, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75On-tap, served in a snifter
Appears a golden orange with pretty good clarity and some tiny bubbles pushing their way through the viscous liquid. A small, yellowish cap and dots of lacing.
The aroma fills the air, and from an arm's length away, you get strong waves of apricot, papaya and mango. Outside of tropical fruit, you get fresh cut pine needles and sticky, resiny hops. There is a small trace of sweet, toasted malt. The aroma is where this beer really shines, so pleasing and inviting.
Wow, perfection. They found an even better balance than the elder while still delivering a crisp, dry, bitter hop bite. Apricots, mangoes, pineapple, and papaya with fresh cut pine and a resinous, viscous body. These hops stand tall and bright with just the right amount of bitterness to let you know this guy means business.
Resiny, viscous body but not heavy. Creamy and lush. The finish is dry and bitter. Only a touch of warming once you get 3/4ths of the way through the glass.
This was a breeze. I couldn't get it away from nose and I really had to tell myself to slow down. It is just too damn delicious. 1,111 charactersColForbinBC, Mar 21, 2010

Great clear straw yellow colour and great hopped citric and herbal-pine aroma. The taste is complex and has a nice level of finishing bitterness. Smooth to start and semi-dry to finish with low courseness from a good level of carbonation.
Now let's get to the point:
Outstanding aroma when you get half-way through the beer and it warms a little... Suddenly I'm convinced that I'm smelling pineapple juice. Incredible. 
I just wish I could get this in Ontario. I know what I'll be seeking when I travel afar... 613 charactersecoastman, Mar 19, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First beer review, I'd say I'm starting it off right. A thousand thank you's to Hayes for sharing his growler, it was overnighted to him so still very fresh!
The beer poured a deep gold with an off white head. Fairly transparent, not really what I was expecting for a beer with such an awesome rep - I wouldn't have guessed it was such an amazing beer just to look at it. However, this was the only aspect of the beer that didn't live up to or exceed my expectations.
This beer smells awesome, it is right up there with the best smelling beers I've come across. Awesome taste, wow. There's a wonderful balance of fruity citrus and hops. Tons and tons of hops, but enough other flavors to lend it a nice balance and not make it bitter. This is definitely one of the best tasting beers I've had, maybe the best. 
The mouthfeel was probably the aspect that exceeded my expectations the most. Really thick, not at all like many IPAs I've had - more like a good stout really. This is what sets the younger apart from my other favorite IPAs for me. Very easy to drink too, almost no bite from the alcohol and like I mentioned before it wasn't unpleasantly bitter. I could drink this all night
Like I said, I'm infinitely thankful for being given the chance to try this beer, but I would love to have had more of it. Visiting the brewery to have it on tap is now on my bucket list, fantastic beer overall I hope you all get the chance to try it! 1,442 charactersAWolf, Mar 18, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From a keg almost seven weeks following the release, poured into a snifter glass.
A: Beautiful golden orange color, very clear. Great string of bubbles swirling up from the center of the glass. Nice white head that lingers nicely on the edge of the glass.
S: Ahhhh. I think this is easily PtE and PtY's strongest characteristic. Huge piney, resiny, sticky hops. I'm very partial to that hop smell, so more is always better and PtY delivers. I would have been happy to stop at the smell (okay, not really).
T: Yes, the hops continue into the taste. Incredibly balanced. For a 10%+ beer that is considered a triple, it does not carry any of the overly sticky, sweet tastes that some big DIPA/TIPAs have (umm, DFH120, for example). The flavor of the hops (more green, pine, resin flavors) continue through the taste without being overly bitter. The taste lingers for a long time (minutes), but seems less bitter than some local IPAs. Just a touch of warming from the alcohol, but man this goes down easy. I don't really notice many typical malty flavors as I'm enjoying the hops too much!
M: Medium carbonation, medium to big body, but not unexpected or out of style. Felt very smooth in the mouth with very little oilyness. It was there, but come on, it's a triple IPA. 
D: Excellent. Actually above expectations. This was tasted next to PtE and it's the first time that I felt PtE did not shine. PtE seems harsh and out of balance in comparison. Stuck on a desert island, PtE would likely be a better choice as it's hard to imagine drinking too many PtY's. But I certainly wish this beer was available a little more frequently. It deserves the hype, even seven weeks after release. 1,685 charactersoregonskibum, Mar 17, 2010

Ok, in for the smell. WOW! This is up there with Hopslam as far as Mango and candied pineapple aroma. This thing sure smells like it's going to be amazing.
Lot's of sugar cookie sweetness. Tons of pineapple and mango. Some light caramel also. Very Tasty.
Great mouthfeel. Smooth, very easy to drink. Flavors linger long after the swallow.
This beer is real easy to drink. The 11% starts to show as it warms up. I see why this beer gets its accolaids. It's an amazing beer but the best in the world? Either way, i'm happy that i was able to try it. 735 charactersBigMike, Mar 17, 2010

 Poured a slighly hazy auburn color with a thin white heading. Lacing did stick around through every gulp and until the bitter end.
Smell is a little deceiving at first although the hops are clearly there in the taste there is more a lighter malty body in the nose. Bitter hops blast through with a nice hello.
Taste is smooth and malty as soon as the brew touches the tongue but a heavy citrusy - pineapple blast takes over.Very tasty indeed.
Mouth has excellent carbonation with a nice medium body. The pineapple grassy notes linger around for a long while. Again very alive on the palate.Alot lighter in the mouth than I would have anticipated not like a heavy syrup that you would find in other IIPA's.
Well this is good but honestly I don't know what all of the hubbub is about this brew with you CA folk. This is a very tasty brew but you can easily find other great IIPA's for less the hassle and wait but still a solid brew. 1,074 charactersTheFightfan1, Mar 16, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: light orange in color with a short 1/4" head that broke down quickly. No lace devlops.
Smell: grapefruit, loads of hop bitterness, and a hint of sweetness creates a nice aroma.
Taste: big malt profile with a finely balanced sharp bitterness. Loads of grapefruit, caramel, ripe fruit, and a bit of lemon are most dominant. The bitterness does not overwhelm. Alcohol levels are not even noticable.
Mouthfeel: medium-heavy in body. Lightly crisp throughout with dryness late. Aftertaste is long as the flavors linger in the mouth.
Drinkability: this beer went down rather quicky despite the big flavor profile. Is this beer the best in the world ? I still think Westy 12 would be my choice in a heads up competition, but this is one great beer. Special thanks to the Hulmeville Inn for getting this beer in house. 826 charactersGavage, Mar 16, 2010

A-More gold than I thought it would be, good head that lingered. Was poured from the tap into a goblet and then into a tulip. Thin lacing after each sip.
S-Incredible hop & pine smell. Smell was a great appetizer for the beer.
T- Big, but very balanced hop taste. Sweet as well, but not overpowering.
M-Perhaps my favorite part. I put off swallowing the beer as long as possible. Aftertaste was the most unique I've experienced. The hop flavor lingered strongly between each sip. It was like you were still drinking!
D-If not so rare, this beer would be permanently stocked in my fridge. I'm looking to order some of the elder now just to scratch teh itch! 862 charactersjvanetten, Mar 16, 2010

Very small white head that dissapates to a thin ring, pretty quickly too. No real lacing to speak of, but could be due to the "bar-glass" washing methods.
Aroma was not as strong as I expected, but good! Piney hops, obvious grapefruit, and honey. Other than that, similar to most big name DIPA's.
Flavor was a little let down to be honest. It's good, but too sweet IMO. I hate to say it, but I prefer Elder better. The hops come fore front immediately, followed quickly by the intense sweetness, and finally followed again by another wave of hops and a dry boozy finish. I had heard that the grapefruit is very well detectable in Younger, they weren't kidding! Very carbonated and thin light, yet crisp mouthfeel. I actually enjoyed Younger less as it warmed up, it got even more sweet. Over all, a very good beer, but way too hyped! Again though, another good beer from Russian River! 1,089 charactersShadesOfGray, Mar 14, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -4.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Just got back home from the PtY event at Tria this afternoon, was one of the lucky ones who got in before the keg kicked. Review based on my notes.
A- I was expecting red, but this was a nondistinct gold. The head was fairly impressive, a finger of very creamy white that hung out for a long a time, and when it was finally tamed, still left some pretty lacing.
S- Unmistakably hoppy. This was the first hint at the greatness of PtY. It was all citrus from the hops, with a subtle malty balance that kept it from going full on bitter. Impressive.
T- And this is where PtY becomes significant. Just the kind of citrusy, hoppy, well balanced flavor that the smell and the hype made me expect, but there was something else going on here that I had never detected before. Maybe it was umami, the fifth taste, maybe it was the hop concentration taking the flavor to a whole other level, but the middle of this beer's flavor was one of the most unique beer tastes I've ever had. Hard to put the finger on it, but in a blind taste test, I'll never have a problem picking this one out of a lineup. Bangin'.
M- As creamy as it looked, but with a light character, and a really sweet tingle on the tongue. Awesome.
D- There was a one per customer limit in effect (though I cheated with my wife's beer when she was in the bathroom) - wish I could have gone back for a second. Could I drink this all day? I think it would ruin my appreciation of just about every other beer. The rarity is definitely part of the equation here.
So did it live up to the hype? Yes, I think so. It was transcendental as far as beer goes, but it did not necessarily transcend beer. But who can really ask for anything more than that? Maybe I'll have it again next year, but in the meantime, I can't say that Nugget Nectar is much of a drop off. 1,816 charactersrawthar, Mar 13, 2010

Alcohol is totally hidden, making this a quiet killer. 324 charactersSeanibus, Mar 11, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Drank this on 2/15, two 17 oz. mugs at Hollingshead's in Orange, CA. From the notes I took at the time:
An orange, golden color with copper shades at the edges. A small, slightly off-white head that dissipates quickly.
Aromas of grapefruit, orange, tangerine, apricot, and pine needles. It's got a boozy kick to it as well, but it dissipates after a while. Everything I could want in an IPA.
Perfectly carbonated with a medium body, but the alcohol is definitely there. Like the aroma, it subsides after some time. There's a whole mess of piny flavors followed by grapefruit, apricot, and a hint of the finest herb. The bitterness lingers for quite a long time.
It's a hoppy, bitter, and just plain angry IPA. Damn near killed my taste buds and killed my appreciation for any other IPA for the next week, which hampered it a bit (hence my wait for the review)... can't drink too much of it. But the best IPA I've ever had? Well, I have a lot of IPAs left to try, but compared to the ones I have tried, this ranks #2, right after Exponential Hoppiness. 1,055 charactersJerryBullfrog, Mar 11, 2010

this nearly clear golen beverage is wanted. a fine floral aroma like the garden of eden - BUT - do not taste of the fruit of the tree in the middle! oh dear god, i did. it is too smooth. an intensity of bitterness and hop flavor, but not quite the shapness of the elder. a little citrus fruit in the nose and mouth. so nice for 11, doesn't feel like it, so little sweetness for an imperial. i wish i could drink it, but i put the 8 oz glass in a museum instead. ahh, posterity. 515 charactersolympuszymurgus, Mar 11, 2010

S: Powerful citrus and pine aroma, makes the knees weak.
T: Ka-pow! My palate didn't know what hit it. Lots of pine and grapefruit flavors here, super fresh on the hop taste.
M: Good bitterness, feels pretty light for the amount of hops and alcohol.
D: Amazing flavors with a light balance makes it hard to have just one. I was lucky and got 3 glasses... and definitely felt like I had 3 glasses of it.
Overall it is an incredible beer. I don't think it would be so popular if it were readily available every year. But honestly, part of the enjoyment of this beer was the hunt... and kill. 719 charactersmpensworth, Mar 10, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ah yes - one of the beer holy grail items. I might as well be a geek and review it.
Got this on tap at the Vine St. Pub in Denver. I lucked into actually getting two servings since it was a Monday afternoon.
Honey golden with a cap of white foam.
Smells like hops - lots of them. Unlike many others (even my favorites), there isn't much malt popping up in there. It's just straight ahead west coast hops.
The first thing you'll notice with a sip is that again, the malt takes a backseat. Hops add both fruity flavors and herbal ones. Resiny pine, pineapple, a little spearmint, even a little bit of a cannabis. Slightly sweet, but not nearly as much as you'd expect. Every sip is just great - and it avoids having too much going on.
This beer hides its 11% as well as any strong beer can. No alcohol smell, taste, or heat. It has the drinkability and texture of a beer half its strength. 
I could've handled a pitcher of it (and yes, I did ask...) but obviously that isn't happening. Still, rarity is the only limiting factor.
Best beer in the world? Maybe! For a hoppy one I think this beats out Dreadnaught on my personal best list.
If you like DIPA's and American hops - I can't imagine them getting much better. Deserving of the hype. It really is THAT GOOD. 1,262 charactersDomingo, Mar 09, 2010
4.58/5  rDev -1.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Rewriting my review from the ground up. 
From a two-week-old growler. It was waxed and refrigerated after release while my shipped ones landed. From notes. 
A: Carbonation held up surprisingly well. I'd attribute that both to the wax job and to Russian River's choice of excellent glass. This is the first time I've ever filled a growler at RR, since they're too far away to visit more than a couple of times a year. 
The pours crystal clear in the glass: it's a dark amber body with orange hues against the light. The head is fluffy and off-white, filling the snifter with crackles and pops. It leaves some register marks down the glass. This doesn't look quite as nice as the tap form, but for an 11% TIPA, it's impressive it even has head at all, much less this much. 
S: Starts off with tropical citrus (pineapple, oranges, tangerines) and grapefruit. There is a wet pine needle aroma behind it. Malt isn't that pronounced, but it does have a sugar cookie backing. Very simple, I guess, to let the hop flavors come out. I also detect -- and this is different from the tap version -- a hint of booze. 
T: Citrus, citrus, citrus. Grapefruit primarily, but it's followed closely by pineapple, tangerine, orange. The mid-taste progresses into dank pine flavors and light, perfumey floral hops. The sugar cookie aroma I noticed is apparent underneath as an underlying, lightly bready sweetness; but it doesn't add much as far as flavors go. Light spice in the finish. This is simply an ode to the hop. As in the nose, it's lightly boozy. 
M: Medium-bodied; with carbonation a tad higher than medium. That helps suppress the bigness of this beer, but I have to say I noticed that the first glass and a half out of the growler were hot, which I did not notice on tap. The finish is semi-dry, with light lingering bitterness and not much oiliness. 
I had HopSlam next to this, since the tropical citrus flavors make for a natural comparison. The sweetness of HopSlam made it taste like a barleywine in comparison. And I LOVE HopSlam. It really speaks to how well-attenuated PtY is. 
D: I'm not sure whether it was worth it to go up to the release. I found this on tap very easily at a number of places, and like I said in my other review, the beer is delicious on draft. Out of a growler it's still good, but if this were my only experience with the beer, I wouldn't (and will not) give it all 5s. Even with this one waxed and sitting in the back of my fridge, it dropped off noticeably in quality. I can only imagine how much unrefrigerated transit takes out of this beer. 
Still, it's easily a top-tier Imperial IPA; I haven't had a better one. 2,651 charactersArbitrator, Mar 08, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is outstanding. It's your typical West Coast DIPA, but done to perfection. It has your standard pale malt base which seems to provide adequate balance. The hop aroma is sublime. It's citrusy with hints of pine. It's very bitter, yet not as much as I thought it would be. The taste is great; so smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. What there is , is a damn tasty beer that's relatively light and loaded with hops. This is a thing of beauty. The mouthfeel is great as well. It's a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is off the charts. There's not heat whatsoever, just heavenly golden nectar. 768 charactersWesWes, Mar 08, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Okay... had FOUR glasses while they had it on tap at Henry's. Here goes:
Lighter it seems than Pliny the Elder. More complex, subtle... which I enjoy. Shows a gorgeous color, though slightly clear surprisingly. Good head retention and lace. Lots going on the nose. The pine and citrus from the hops are subdued, allowing more subtle fruit and yeast aromas. Has a slight bitter funk from the yeast used. Pretty amazing. Flavors are elegant with the pine from hops and funk from the yeast playing well together. Finishes with finesse and balance. Tannins, acids, and alcohol all in check and balanced. I thought this was 8-9% abv... it was well hidden.
I recommend this beer highly... though not getting drunk at the strip club afterwards... 741 characterscbarrett4, Mar 07, 2010

beautiful golden with great clarity, bubbles, head retention. White frothy head.
Wicked citrus and hoppy aroma. Smells like cali bud.
Invasive and penetrating hops ninjas entering my chest cavity. Tastes similar to hopslam after it drank the ooze. Little to no heat whatsoever. Great drink! Really glad this one wasn't a let down in flavor.
A bit oily in the mouth (expected). Syrupy and carbonated. Without the carbonation it would come down below a 4 in mouthfeel but it helps a bunch.
This one goes deep and stays there, great drink! 657 charactersHabmike, Mar 06, 2010

Pours forth an orangy color. Little whit head that stays and no lacing.
The smell is easily the best part of this beer. An overwhelmong amount of hops is the first smell. Followed by citrus and not just the normal grapeftuitiness. A finish of toffee maltiness and pine.
This a great beer, but I liked the Elder better. This is way to easy to drink for the ABV that it is. Hops right off the bat, then citrus follows orange and the grapefruit. Pine follows with a finish of malt and grapefruit left on the tongue.
A pleasant warmth to the brew from the alcohol. A bit thinner than i expected. Decent carbonation and very smooth.
This was way to easy to drink down. I am glad I shared this with a few people, because if I had kept it I don't believe I would have remembered much the next morning. A lovely brew, just not as good as the Elder to me. 877 charactersKelp, Mar 04, 2010

Pours a beautiful orange-ish, brownish color. Great, white, head that lingers for days but doesn't spring up on you while pouring.
The smell is duh, HOPS!!! Tons and tons of hops!!! Wish there was a bit more grapefruit but this is a beautiful smelling brew!
The taste was smooth and fairly balanced. There was a slight alcohol burn that took away from the brew but it wasn't terrible.
Overall, a WONDERFUL brew! Not my number 1 but its a damn fine example of a extremely hopped brew!

4.54/5  rDev -2.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Tried this rarity for the first time during a special 20-person morning session at Resurrection Ale House. Beer was served with a smile in a medium-sized tulip.
Packing a soft, short head and low carbonation, this brew is a nearly translucent gold, with flecks of red and orange. A bit more carbonation was excepted, but there's nothing on display here to take away from its hefty reputation.
Aromas are quite strong, walking the line somewhere between alpha hops and sour citrus. It's a pleasing and lively stink, reminding me of warm weather and summer fun, something which is miles away from the arctic tundra of Philadelphia. A beautiful bouquet of lovely scents.
The flavor is a bit surprising. I initially expected a pronounced hop scratchiness that would melt the taste buds right off of my tongue. Pleasantly, this offers up the best of both worlds, magnificently balancing a powerful hoppiness with a sunny and delicate amber sweetness. It's exceptionally light for its strength, masking the alcohol well and giving off a fresh and floral vibe. I also caught a mild roasted quality amongst the concluding flavors.
The liquid carries a warmth, despite the fact that it is rather thin and quite easy to consume. The hop character wakes up the tongue, but never overwhelms it, allowing other characteristics to poke out their heads. It's also dangerously drinkable, never even hinting at its raging 11% ABV. 
This brew truly deserves the overwhelming acclaim. It's an exceptional DIPA and it certainly shouldn't be sequestered to holidays and special occasions. 1,572 charactersdeapokid, Mar 04, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5- Based on 2 10 oz drafts at Resurrection Ale House in Philly:
I doubt I have much to add to the raving about this beer except to echo my affection. It pours a copper, golden orange w. good carbonation, a decent, albeit thin head and lacing all the way down the glass.
The nose is a floral, citrus, hoppy explosion with pineapple, orange, lemon zest but especially grapefruit. 
The taste, while not what I would describe as complex, was just...well...perfection - bitterness perfectly offset by sweetness and malt and a peppery grapefuit fresh aftertaste. There is evidence of the alcohol in the warming finish but no hint of the 11% (so beware!).
In short, maybe there is a better beer out there somewhere, but I have yet to find it; This is an awesome beer. 759 charactersregspeir, Mar 03, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had a full snifter of this at a tasting at Capones in Norristown, PA. 
Appearance: This brew practically glows on the table. It's a bright gold/red with minimal head. This beer almost emits light.
Smell: Grapefruit, lillies and other wild flowers. Perhaps getting a slight smell of the malts but the citrius dominates the nose.
Taste: This beer is viscous while being still effervescent. Undoubtly the best beer I have ever drank. I took my time with this guy and let it warm up a bit and it got much more alcoholy and a little bit more malty but in an absolutely amazing way. 
Mouthfeel: Fantastic mouth feel. The carbonation is SPOT on. 
Overall: I'm sure I'm not the first to admit it but this beer is worth the hype that is around it. Definitely the best-of-the-best. 776 charactershippityhops85, Mar 03, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Someone from the East Coast with an opportunity to try and review this highly sought after beer, what an opportunity. I was beginning to compare this beer to the legend of Bigfoot (Sasquatch, not the Barleywine from Sierra), some people have seen it but it's so rare that it's more of a myth than an actual beer. (tongue in cheek, of course)
Pours a copper orange color, tight bubbled carbonation with a thin white head across the top.
Has a sweet pungent, oily hop aroma with pineapple, loads of citrus orange and grapefruit, and some pine. This beer is incredibly aromatic and I spent as much time with my nose in the glass enjoying the smell as much as I did the taste.
Taste is absolutely unreal, it's definitely the King of the IPA's. I've had many IPA's where the smell was outrageously good but the taste didn't measure up, and vice versa; the Younger has both characteristics. It's very bold and strong in flavor with huge amounts of grapefruit bitterness that dominates throughout the entire sip, has some sweet malt undertone to keep things a little bit in check but gets extremely beaten down by hop bitterness. Starts sweet for a brief second with some peppery sweetness on the side of the tongue. Malts re-appear at the very end for a brief moment before being slapped into submission by an army of hop bitterness. Finishes with strong grapefruit puckering, pepper, and orange rind that lingers for a LONG time after the sip. The back of the throat is coated with peppery grapefruit bitterness, and orange coats the mouth, almost metallic-like in nature. There's an ABV burn after the sip but that's the only indication of it's presence. As I work through the glass, the booziness becomes more apparent.
Mouthfeel is the smoothest I've ever experienced with an IPA. Drinkability is very good, you have to be a hop head to enjoy this, otherwise, forget it. 
I only had one glass and I was begging for more but the bartender was the Pliny Natzi - One Younger for you! This is a world class beer, wish Vinnie would brew this more often and make it more accessible. Glad I had the opportunity to finally try this beer. 2,132 charactersjzeilinger, Mar 03, 2010

S- good god what a smell every year when I get my few glasses I can't help but think it smells just like a powdered sugar cover lemon jelly doughnut. Crisp citrus, sweet and bready. 
T- well its just about the best ipa I've ever tasted huge hop oil and lemon zest, pine and sap. Touch of dry biscuit and bread. Mildly sweet but just the right amount. I love this stuff more and more every year. Livin in Philly really pays off if you can avoid getting shot. I kid I kid. 
M- beautiful on the tounge like a good lady. It really coats the mouth but never too much, crisp carb that delivers the brew around the palete amazingly. Finishes with a nice clean linger that is much liked. 
D- well I'm a beast but at 11 percent its not to be fooled with. If I wasn't driving and the keg didn't kick instantly oh wait it didn't I can get a second well then bring it on. I guess that says it all. 
Well thank you scoats and all the fine folks at the grey lodge for doing a younger event perfectly. Ill be enjoying this blessed brew while it lasts. Oh vinnie what magick you brew. 1,139 charactersoglmcdgl, Mar 03, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 510oz pour at Monk's Cafe, tapped for their Russian River Mad Monday. I got the first retail pour (not to brag), so I'm kind of a big deal. 
A- I have to say that it had a glow about it, sort of a halo, an aura. But seriously, regardless of how it felt to finally have a glass of this beast in my hand, it really did stand out in appearance. Golden with a slight orange hue, impeccable clarity, 1-finger fluffy white head leaving a sticky lacing, but not uncharacteristically think lacing by any means.
S- Great sweet citrus (more orange than grapefruit) with a slight fruitiness of another variety, possibly even bubblegum. It is slightly piney, but the other aromas stood out much more, especially when compared to the Elder, which I find to be dominated by the piney/forest aroma. This definitely has a more complex and layered aroma. Once you really get your nose down in there, the aroma is also of bitter grapefruit.)
T- Huge floral flavor with intense grapefruit and a slight bitter orange rind in the finish. The floral taste is much more similar to the piney ("f*cked in the face by a pinecone" as I have seen some term it) aroma that I expected based on its Elder brother. Really a sensational brew. I found it surprising that with some of the sweetness, it is slight more reminiscent of Hopslam than Pliny which lacks a lot of the citral aromas and flavors I have mentioned. 
MF- Nice and sticky on the palate with a slick, oily finish. In some ways, I expected something different on the mouthfeel here, maybe a bit more "chewy," though I am not sure that would be desirable in an IPA. I guess it is equally impressive that it wasn't that much different than the Elder or other great IPAs, yet packed 10.5% abv and a hop profile that could demolish the rest. 
D- This beer is absurdly drinkable. I think that is a lot of what makes it such a masterpiece. Granted, if it was 5%, I would like it just as much, but there is something to be said for a beer that drinks like every other IPA yet packs a decidedly greater punch. The closest comparison I often here is Hopslam, but this really does it without the slight residual sweetness making it that much more amazing. Really, a spectacular beer that I feel very fortunate to have sampled. 2,253 charactersmbudner, Mar 02, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had 8oz pour on-tap at Falling Rock Taphouse on 2/26/10 as part of their special tapping the night before the Boulder SourFest. Place was packed so glad that ummagum and I got there 1.5 hrs early and got a table. It was a slightly hazy golden orange color. Had slight carb streams. Couldn't tell how soon after pouring that we got it since it was a mass delivery but it still had a 1/8" foam cap that stayed there for the duration (especially as I kept swirling it to kick up the awesome aromas). My glass had good lacing and not much sticking but my friend's had great lacing and lots of sticking so I used his as the lacing reference and chalked mine up to washing issues. 
The aroma was exceptional. One of, if not, the best hoppy aromas out there. Lots of pine, c-hops, grapefruit with a great malt backbone. Very well balanced. A constant sniffer. The taste matched the aroma perfectly. Loads of hop flavor from start to finish with the malt coming in at the end to smooth it out. Great balance and one of the smoothest hoppy beers out there. My buddy and I kept remarking on how smooth it was. The ABV never came into play. Couldn't smell it or taste it and didn't really feel it. I could drink this stuff all day. Mouthfeel was medium to full with good carb levels and a great finish.
Overall, this is one amazing beer. After having so many of the top ranked ones and being disappointed (and wondering if the rarity was making it high ranked) I was so glad that this one held up. Worthy of the hype, rankings, etc and most highly recommend. I'd need to try it again at least 1 or 2 times to say for sure but this might be my favorite beer of all time. If not it's still pretty damn close. Rotation - not avail here in TX and is tap only so road trips are only hope. If avail here, my fridge would always be stocked with this. 1,834 charactersTexIndy, Mar 02, 2010

Look: Deep golden, slightly amber color, clear, with a medium head and great lacing
Smell: Powerful citrus & pine hops, malt, caramel and toffee
Taste: Up Front: Grapefruit, then pineapple, then apricot. Finish: Malt, with hops picking up steam along the way
Mouthfeel: Medium body, incredibly smooth, balanced, and a stickiness that coats the tongue and palate

Appearance: Murky golden with brown shades and amber highlights on the rim of the glass. White head was slow to form and the carbonation seemed mildly present coming from the bottom of the glass. Remnant lace indicated an intact and fulfilling body.
Smell: bright citrusy fresh hops, light caramel toffees and roasted glaze. Bottom line is that this was the freshest smelling Imperial i have ever had. 
TTTasteWow: first impression was TOO drinkable! Went down like a mystic haze of fury without leaving the pallet with much to discern. Second sip: creamier body with hops totted with pine resin and syrup sticky mouthfeel. After more sips the bitterness seems to linger on the roof of the mouth, and bam, the first glass is already gone! wtf! The is a salute to the drinkability of this 11% masterpiece. Goes down way too smooth I wanted it to last. The hops do hang around however, well after the glass turned empty. 
Drinkability: for a high ABV beer, this brew disguises the warming superbly, if a 5.5/5.0 on drinkability was permitted for 1 beer, this would be that beer. 1,248 charactersrandawakes, Mar 02, 2010
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into a 10oz tulip. Very slight creamy head with light sense of cabonation. Color a clear golden with slight amber hue (though to be fair the lighting was pretty bad). 
Smell is basically like being punched in the face with hops.... some slight citrus and pine is in there, but you have to search for it. 
The taste goes hand in hand with the smell. An intense hop taste with pretty minimal sense of malt and obvious notes of citrus as you progress. A syrupy/resin mouthfeel follows... intense but pleasant. A little creamy with a pretty minimal sense of carbonation.
All in all i'm a little torn with this one. This is an incredible beer and I enjoyed drinking it as much as any other beer i've had.... but if you don't love (and i mean love) hops you will have a hard time enjoying it and I can't help but think that has to count against it a little bit. For as big as this beer is and as intense as it is, its relatively drinkable, but not nearly as much as Elder. 
All in all one hell of a beer. 1,009 charactersmechamifune, Mar 02, 2010

Huge frothy white head that lingers, leaves great lacing and holds the delicious smell. The scent is a beautiful whiff of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple with vauge hints of pale malt and pine resin. I found myself smelling this beer more than i was sipping. Taste begins with the semi-acidic grapefruit, mellowing into a semi-sweet pineapple and tangerine. Bitterness comes through in the end through tastes of pine resin. In between, definite tastes of pale malt are present and provide just enough to smooth the edges between flavors. Body is medium, slightly oily and slick, but does not linger on the palate and cloud future sips. Overall, and excellent dIPA... more akin to a hoppier version of Blind Pig due to all the fruit notes. To me it appeared much less bitter than the PtE due to these tropical fruits. 868 charactersrfgetz, Mar 01, 2010

Poured into a tulip glass, the color of honey. Vanilla head diminishes slowly, leaving a sticky coating of lacing - serious lacing.
Smells like hops, hops and more hops. Pine, pineapple, not too much citrus, more other tropical fruits like mango, banana, peach - pretty glorious.
Now for the real test...how does the Younger taste?
Answer: Freakin great. Hops, hops and more hops! Round 2! Sticky and sweet, absolutely demolishes my palate. Good luck tasting another beer after this guy. Though it is a hop fiend, I'm surprised by the amount of maltiness the Younger brings. It is more balanced that I expected, but don't expect a complex, deeply layered beer here. Pliny the Younger is predominantly a hop bomb, and I couldn't be happier.
Mouthfeel is great, decent carbonation, sticky and full on the tongue. Just the right amount of bitterness that lingers for days. Good, good stuff.
I'm not sure if this is the best beer in the world. It is the best I've had thus far but my beer journey is far from over. However I will say this: I had the highest expectations for this beer, and those expectations were blown into millions of tiny hop pellets. Bravo, Vinnie. Bravo, Russian River. And thank you Monks for giving me the opportunity to taste one of the best. 1,315 characterscassanoj, Mar 01, 2010

Just fantastic blending of malty backbone with an up-front hoppy citrusy bitterness. Not nearly as unbalanced as I expected, but just as good. Really a superbly-balanced beer considering how strong it is. A much more pleasant and drinkable beer than I expected, and not the up-front flavor overload I was bracing myself for. I could drink a lot of these back-to-back. 406 charactersPawel, Mar 01, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler into a tulip.
Orange pour. Not the generic amber/orange that seemingly every DIPA is, but just a bright orange. Much lighter than I was expecting. Thin ring of foam retains well, and leaves some nice lacing on its way down.
Aroma is pure hops. Huge pine, huge citrus, though I didn't smell much citrus until after it warmed up a little bit. I'm sure there's a pretty hefty malt load in there somewhere, but it just gets buried underneath delicious hops.
Huge hoppy flavor, too. Pine is dominant throughout, though there's a nice citric flavor as I reach the bottom of the glass. Some grapefruit and sweet malt underneath. Resinous, yet sweet finish. Was definitely glad to see the citrus come through as it warmed.
Medium-full body. Great texture, appropriately carbonated. No way this beer is 11%. Supreme drinkability. A 5 in that category doesn't do it justice. 890 charactersGyle41386, Feb 28, 2010

Great mouthfeel, lots of body, somewhat sticky. Taste is a flavor explosion, strong notes of citrus fruit and pine. This is the most well-balanced beer I've ever tasted. The alcohol was extremely well hidden, and virtually undetectable. A beer that you could literally drink all day..dangerous. 514 charactersJCDenver, Feb 28, 2010

Aroma is citrus, simcoe hops with grapefruit rind, and some resinous stinky citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel. Flavor is an explosion of flavor. It follows the nose nicely and I can detect layers of resinous hop goodness. Upfront its citrus, then comes simcoe citrus, followed by pine sol flavor, and coats my mouth with hop resins and finishes with a touch of heat. Overall the alcohol is hidden well and I do detect a touch of alcohol in the finish. With more hops. Wonderful beer. Thanks AJ! 575 charactersfiver29, Feb 28, 2010

Pours a dark golden orange/tangerine color with golden orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger fluffy, soapy white head that has amazing retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Soapy chunks of white lacing are left behind. 
Uber fresh dank oily hop aroma that is very floral with a lot of sweet citrus notes balancing out the earthy pine. Slight malt presence and a somewhat strong alcohol character. The high ABV is noticeable in he nose and takes away from the hops a bit. 
Chewy full body, especially for the style, that is bursting with uber fresh earthy piny and sweet citrus hops. Very floral with lots of lemon peel and grapefruit as well as some tropical mango and pineapple. There is a slight malt backbone providing some balance but this beer is all about the hops. There is a good bit of alcohol heat that takes away from the hops a bit too much for my liking but overall the ABV is decently masked. This beer is still dangerously drnkable but I wish that it had a little less heat. I've had this beer several times and I love it but I still prefer Elder. 1,138 characterscorby112, Feb 27, 2010

Was going to get one last year but turned out I was going on vacation after the release, so I've been waiting an entire year for this opportunity. Break out the glasses & pour that Younger!
Pours a clear, concise gold that would make the Gold Rush of '49 proud. Intense, hard-edged grapefruit is the dominant smell, with pine, citrus, all flowing out of the glass. 
Pliny the Younger lives up to its rep as a serious IIPA. Yowza. The water-borne hops come mashing out of the gate at a full gallop. Again, the grapefruit of the hops is ascendant, but there's that Pine-Sol touch right behind it, & a colander full of bitter, mouth-shrinking hop character. Others include just a crumb of breadiness, malt that's a touch dankish & sweet but barely apparent, before the bitterness rushes in at the end to crush the living life out of everything else. Death to the non-hop!
Very sinewy & slippery in the mouth, tar-coated pine needles are all I can think of. Drinkable? Well, I'll have another glass & get back to you on that. But intensity of the hops, virtually unleavened by anything else, means this wouldn't be my drink of choice over a span of hours. 
Well, it's tough to live up to the rep it's developed - Pliny isn't the best beer I've ever had. That said, it also obviously deserves the accolades. It's excellent, & I'm delighted I had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Chris! 1,558 charactersmaximum12, Feb 27, 2010

Big, loose white head with great lacing and a nice golden color.

The flavor is a juicy blend of wet hops, melon, grapefruit, tropical fruit, and a mellow bitterness on the finish that just lingers forever.

4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I'm proud to say that this beer will be my first review. 
I had this on 2/10/2010 at The Trappist as a part of Russian River night. Poured into a Russian River stemmed glass. From notes.
A: Pours a glowing opaque orange with a quickly dissipating one-finger head, leaving some beautiful lacing.
S: This was amazing. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple, flowers, pine cones, and a hint of weed/cannabis. No malt aromas whatsoever.
T: Wow. Just utter bliss. Big, bold, and fresh grapefruit and pine hops dancing together on the tongue. Other secondary citrus flavors looming in the background, but the grapefruit is the star. The bitterness is there, but it's not astringent at all. Very subtle honey and bready notes. The 11% ABV is virtually undetectable.
M: Light to medium body. A bit sticky and unctuous. 
D: Had to take marks off for this. As incredible as PtY was, its just not something I could have all night. Two was plenty.
I hate to lap up all the hype, but this is the best DIPA (or TIPA?) I've ever had. The whole experience was exemplary. For all the boldness (and occasional one-dimensionality) usually associated with DIPAs, this beer had remarkable nuance and depth of character. It transcends the limitations of its style to something greater and immortal. One of the best libations to ever grace my palate. 1,325 charactersMusition12, Feb 26, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5In my opinion, the Younger is a stronger, hoppier (both are ridiculous) Elder. Nose is slightly more tropical and grapefruity than Elder. There is also a little more candi-cookie sweetness than the Elder. With a slightly lighter feeling body, deceptively, yet equally smooth and dry and refreshing. So fresh and delicious, a true ode to the hops. 346 charactersCHILLINDYLAN, Feb 25, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Growler shared by jerz at Woodshop 5.0. Pours a clear gold with an orange tinge and a creamy dense white head. Aroma is hugely pineappley/grapefruity with vanilla and a piney herbal character. Flavor is very herbal and bitter, lots of resins for sure. Sweetness comes through only in an orange/lychee hoppiness. Malt? What malt? We don't need no stinkin malt. Even if there was a pound of peated malt in this I wouldn't be able to taste it through the absurd hop whirlwind. I think I used the word "whirlwind" in my PTE review too now that I think about it. Whatever, this beer pulverizes. I'll rerate next year off a proper pint. 630 charactersillidurit, Feb 25, 2010

A: Pours a beautiful golden yellow with hints of tangerine and a rich frothy two finger creamy white head that hung around for quite some time and left very nice lacing as it fell.
S: Smells of ripe juicy grapefruit and a hint of pine, incredibly fresh and balanced, just a hint of the malt, and above all else...fresh!
T: Follows the nose, interestingly enough I think the elder has a little more bang for your buck, but what makes this incredible is the balance and smoothness of the flavor profile and the unbelievable fact that this is 11% abv. You never even dream that this beer is that high in abv.
M: Medium light body with smooth carbonation and again no sense of the abv, very crisp and very fresh.
D: This is one of the factors that sets this beer apart from others. As you drink this it goes down so smooth and you have no clue that it is 11%. Absolute perfection for drinkability. 972 charactersRedBrewer83, Feb 25, 2010

A - Pretty typical of an IPA/DIPA, yellow-orange in color with a tightly dense white head that faded after a minute or so, a peek through the glass showed little hop chunks, awesome.
S - Huge grapefruit and citrus, but pretty one note. Best described as mild grapefruit juice.
T - Great DIPA, lots of citrus like the nose, good amount of malt, maybe some honey like flavors, little bit of pine and black pepper. What stands out to me the most about the beer is the bitterness, alot of DIPA are too syrupy and can't hold back all that sugary sweetness, this one stikes a good balance.
M - Mild mouthfeel, not too watery but has enough body to hold up to the taste.
D - Great great drinkability, hides the 11% perfectly although I was good at one glass.
I gotta say, I'm glad to have tried it. I was really hoping for a life changing event, but alas it was just a really good DIPA and nothing more, I'd be happy to try it again, but at least I know not to get all worked up over future releases. 1,089 charactersFweezle, Feb 24, 2010

Not too many people were told, it was great to be able to sit and relax while drinking this. Maybe 10 other people in the bar. 
Pour is a nice golden like color with a nice small but creamy looking off white head.
Aroma was amazing tons of pineapple, citrus, pine...tons of hops...and a nice sugary sweetness and a small amount of alcohol. Very tropical.
The taste was nice pinapple and citrus sweetness, with a nice resiny piney bitterness and a decent amount of malt coming through. The sweetness of the malts and tropical flavors remind me of fresh Captain Lawrence DIPA.
Mouthfell was smooth no evidence that this is an 11 percent beer, had 2 didn't want to be too greedy but could easily drink this all night. 804 charactersgregc, Feb 24, 2010
4.24/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Well, here it is, I finally get to try more than a tiny serving of this much-coveted beer. Poured into a tulip. I'm actually a little nervous because I know the reviews for this beer are scrutinized. While it does pour an attractive semi-clouded gold, the foam recedes rather quickly, leaving a few large bubbles on the surface. 
The aroma is outstanding, it's all you ever wanted in an IPA. Apricot, orange, grapefruit, pine, a little mango. For aromatics, it easily deserves a 5.
I get a lot of intense stonefruit on the palate with a zippy pine backing. Hop character is of course very good...but I find that there's somewhat too much alcohol here. It can be harsh, on occasion devolving to what I can only describe as a peach-vodka character. That would be my knock on this beer. I don't think it needs 11%; it doesn't quite have a strong enough malt backing to mask and/or carry it, in my opinion. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I don't see how people can say the alcohol is barely noticeable....I think it's quite noticeable, and it does this particular beer a bit of a disservice in its harshness. 
Feel-wise, it doesn't seem to be that well-carbonated, but it is from a growler that made it all the way to the East Coast, so I have to give it the benefit of the doubt. Plus, it has the requisite resiny feel that massively hopped beers have. 
While it's got great hop character - we all know that - I honestly couldn't drink that much of this. For me, this is a sipping beer in a single 6-8oz serving. It's good in that context, I think. Not my #1 beer, though, not even my #1 DIPA. Even within RR's own stable, I think Pliny the Elder is the superior beer. 1,678 charactersPatrick999, Feb 24, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received a growler of this from the super generous abecall98. I've missed this damn beer the past three years and I decided the 2010 version needed to be in my belly. Drank from some sort of Belgium snifter thingy with Mr. Scoobydank.
Appearance- Pours a light orange yellow with terrific clarity and a beautiful one finger off-white head. A nice collar and thin cap remains most of the beer along with plenty of lacing.
Smells- Smells a lot like Elder. A lot. Loads and loads of tropical fruits including, but not limited to; peach, pineapple, grapefruit, mango and passion fruit. The alcohol is definitely noticeably in the nose, way more than Elder. Not a lot else to say. It's just a big fruity hoppy party.
Taste- Oh man. So subtle and smooth with absolutely no booze what so ever, surprising considering the smell. Almost zero bitterness with a super citric and fruity hoppiness. Loads of pineapple and mango flood my taste buds but I don't get the crazy fruitiness that I got on the nose because the beer is so incredibly "balanced". A kiss of cracker in the super dry finish but it's fleeting and inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. The hoppy fruitiness just lingers and lingers.
Mouthfeel- Nice and creamy with a slick oily feel from the ridiculously copious amount of hops. Light carbonation with a medium to below heavy feel.
Drinkability- Can't believe how good this is. The only real weakness I can find in the brew is the bit of alcohol in the nose. So fruity and hoppy and nice. Man I hope I can find a growler of this every year. Thanks much Abe! 1,574 charactersyounger35, Feb 24, 2010

4.5/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Enjoyed a tulip of this on draft at Teresas's this afternoon. It was a quiet tapping, nothing advertised or broadcasted about it. Which I personally enjoyed much more so than the mayhem of other releases. Anyways, this was my first time having it.
Appearance: A nice clear golden color with a small white fluffy head on top. Everything about this beer screamed PtE on steroids and this was just the first indicator.
Aroma: Didn't even have to bring this glass to my nose. Even from afar, hop aroma's of pine, grapefruit, citrus, and pineapple with a touch of sweetness in the background.
Taste: Jesus. So much of a hop presence it's amazing, but never overbearing. Strong pine presence with some citrus and grapefruit to it. To say it had a solid malt backbone would be deceiving, it is very hop forward, but somehow there is enough malt to balance out both the hoppiness and the intense bitterness at the end. Also has just the right amount of sweetness to balance it all out. Certainly the most powerful hop experience I've had without it getting to the point of being unpleasant. Truly amazing.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied while being very smooth, crisp and refreshing. No hint whatsoever of the 11% ABV while drinking this, even as it warmed up.
Drinkability: Well, realistically it is low. This is a phenomenal beer but let's be serious, no one could drink more than 2 or 3 of these without the alcohol catching up to them.
So glad I got the chance to finally try this one. Definitely a world-class example of a double IPA. Special thanks to Matt at the Beeryard for giving me the inside info ahead of time and the whole crew at Teresas (I only vaguely know Andy) for having a very tame, relaxing and enjoyable tapping of Younger. 1,738 charactersEzekiel81923, Feb 23, 2010

It Poured a nice amber color, almost like mead, With a good solid head and an all hop aroma. The taste was exquisite with a heavy hop forward bitter blast, balanced out by a honey/nectar malt flavor. I had 3 glasses and I could drink this alll night if it were not for the alcohol hitting me after glass 3. It's an amazing beer! 573 characterssomabeer, Feb 23, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I got in line more than an hour early for EBF session one to ensure I got a taste of this behemoth. That turned out to be unnecessary when it lasted more than two hours into the session. I even ended up getting a second sample.
A: Pours a beautiful golden copper color with about a finger of fluffy white head. Some lace sticks to the sides of the glass. 
S: Wonderful aromas of floral grapefruit and pine meet the nose without even holding the quaff up to it. Closer inspection revealed more of the same, but even stronger. One of the most pleasing DIPAs I've ever sniffed. 
T: A decent amount of sweet citrus and pine flavors up front quickly give way to an almost mouth puckering amount of bitter hops. Considering the amount of bitterness this brew produces, I'm impressed by how balanced it is. There is just enough sweetness to prevent the high bitterness from becoming unpleasant. In fact, the overall flavor is downright pleasant. However, I would not say it's THE best DIPA flavor I've ever experienced. 
M: A nice medium body and incredibly smooth. I can't believe this is 11% alcohol. 
D: An amazing DIPA to be sure. Considering this brew has 11% abv, it's dangerously drinkable. I would probably mistake it for something I could session if I didn't know better. Now, is it worthy of the epithet of "Best beer on earth"? I don't believe so. In fact, I think I enjoy PtE just a little more. I did a side by side comparison of the two at EBF and I truly just like the balance between sweet and bitter in PtE's flavor just a little more. IMHO, PtY is simply PtE with just a touch too many hops added. Regardless of this slight qualm, PtY is definitely an elite brew worthy of being in the same company as the world's best beers. 1,741 charactersMrDanno96, Feb 23, 2010

A-Bright, golden copper with a thin off-white head that reduced to a thin ring. Head revives nicely with a bit of swirling. Moderate, spotty lace left behind.
S-Luscious citrus (orange, tangerine, apricot) hops mixing with papaya, mango and some pineapple. Amazing, for how strong the hops are they do not overwhelm. Backing of sweetness is moderating and very pleasant. Regardless of this sweetness though the hops are, without question, the star of the show.
T-WOW! This is ALL about the hops! I am amazed at the power of the hop presence and yet it isn't overpowering or too bitter. The malt sweetness moderates the bitterness and allows the humulus lupulus beauty shine through.
M-Medium-light bodied, quite smooth and yet crisp. Can this beer really be 11%? I cannot see how...alcohol is barely noticeable!
D-From a growler, on tap, out of a cattle trough, spilled in the gutter and lapped up....it doesn't matter this beer is, without question, the KING of the West Coast hop bombs! I could drink PtY until I lapsed into a coma! 1,166 charactersDeuane, Feb 23, 2010

I have heard tell of this brew for some time now, so when I worked EBF 2010, I made sure that this one was my first one, so I was clear minded enough to review it and give it a fair shake. 
Pours a nice dark amber color, with nice head. 
Aroma is earthy hops with hints of pine. Very refreshing and enticing to smell.
The taste is very well balanced. Sweet hints of candy or citrus, with strong hop backbone coming in the middle. Finishes sweet on the palate. 
Mouthfeel and drinkability are great. For 11% abv this goes down dangerously smooth. With all the flavors in balance, you really don't notice the alochol, with very little burn in the throat. Damn near sessionable. 
A very amazing beer. I was very impressed to see it lived up to the hype. 936 charactersFreshie, Feb 22, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Cheers to Mikeoxlong for trading this growler, I have been wanting to try this beer for about 2 years now! Als shared among friends as it will be ahrd to finish a whole growler!
After traveling across the country, the growler opened up with a nice hiss - no carbonation lost during transit. Poured into a snifter glass, and with an aggressive pour, only an 1/2 inch head appears and leaves little lacing. Instead, swirling the glass reveals the legs of this beer, an indication of alcohol content. The brew looks great - a wonderful amber/golden color and absolutely clear.
Smell: An interesting mix of resiny hops, toasted malts, and wafts of spicy alcohol. Breathing in more I find more complex nose, minor citrus, tropical fruit, pine, spruce, and sap. The nose is does not knock me off my feet but it is complex with many different hop profiles added into the aroma. The alcohol, which not terribly noticeable, detracts from the nose only slightly and lends a very spicy character to the brew.
Taste: Holy hops! Bitterness grabs the tongue and refuses to let go! Hops are a strong and harsh when the beer is cold but tends to be smoother when the beer warms up. The bitterness lends a resinous, piney flavor to the brew. Quickly after the hops however, the malts come through very clean and fresh with caramel, breadiness, and toffee. Very well balanced for 11% ABV but the alcohol is present and leaves a prickly feeling on the sides of the tongue. Complexity for a DIPA as through the roof on this one. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and finishes rather dry, very typical of west coast DIPAs.
Overall: Pliny the Elder on steroids. Satisfies every hop heads wet dream with a doubt. My only marks on flaws would be the nose which is not as strong as other DIPAs. Gruit 16 ale comes to mind, PTY doesn't go past 16 in the nose. For 11% ABV, which is really hard to make in a DIPA, the beer is dangerously drinkable and well balanced. This beer would be perfect with 0 ABV heat more hop aroma, but is great as it stands 2,021 charactersphattysbox, Feb 22, 2010

T- Blast of fresh hops right off the bat, moving into a citrus and tropical fruit sweetness. I can't really detect any of the 11% abv. The hops leaves a very bitter finish, but it is an extremely clean bitterness.
M- Medium body with a low carbonation.
D- Incredibly easy drinking for 11%. I was worried when I was about to try this that it would turn out to be over-hyped; that was not the case. This beer is very worthy of being at the top of the 'best of BA' list. 643 charactersTommyW, Feb 22, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Gave this one the once over at Barley and Hops in Temecula, CA. I feel priveleged to review the number one beer in the world right now.
A - Straw yellow with a thin white head that dissipates quickly leaving a thin lace behind.
S - Very complex in the nose, citrus, pineapple and a hint of alcohol. Very inviting.
T - An explosion of hops and even malt backbone, surprisingly dry for an 11% beer. Pleasantly warming with a mellow alcohol bite. The most complex IPA I have ever tried! Similar to the nose, citrus, pine, and pineapple. 
M - Very dry with relatively low carbonation. Got better as it warmed in my glass.
D - I was tempted to rate this a bit higher in drinkability than 4, but at 11% I just couldn't do it. I had one and it lasted the better part of 40 minutes as I truly savored and enjoyed it.
I saw guys buying their two 10oz. pours and pounding the first one then take on the appearance of being hit with a sledge hammer. Vinny says Pliny is to be enjoyed fresh and not aged, but one of these in a session is more than enough. I heard one guy tell his wife she had to drive home after he was mid way through his second! 1,142 charactersimblane, Feb 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally got a chance to try the newest number one on Beeradvocate.com.
Poured from the tap into a tasting glass.
The color is a deep dark orange, is clear with a nice finger or two head. Some nice lacing on the glass.
The smell is just hoppy from the start. The is some nice grapefruit and pineapple that comes out first to welcome the aroma into sweet and delicious hop dream.
The taste is pretty hoppy but even balanced with a mellow fruity flavor. There are just a few fruits that cam into mind as I tasted this. A nice banana flavor with some grapefruit flavor mixed with a bit of melon. A wonderful fruit experience.
The feel of this beer is pretty mellow. There is a few points that come out to pronounce themselves but there seems to be less of a kick to the Younger than the Elder and I was really happy to say I was a able to take my time with this beer and enjoy it. Worth the wait and the hype. 910 charactersDuhast500, Feb 21, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had a few glasses with my homey Joe. Poured from a super cool flip-top growler, it has a bright, yellow gold color with good clarity. The head is white with good retention and lacing. Carbonation held up good in the growler shipped across the country.
The aroma is nice, but not as strong as I expected. It had some citrus and general fruitiness, a bit of wood, and a lot of pine. A touch of alcohol is detected, but it is very low considering the strength of the beer. A touch of peach as it warms. Some very slight tropical notes come through to add a touch more complexity. The one thing I wanted from this beer was to be blown away by the aroma, but I've had better smelling hoppy beers before. It's a great smelling beer, but not one I'll be dreaming about.
The taste of this beer is great. It's sweet and filled with flavors of fruit gummies and bitter pine needles from the hops. Younger is very bitter, but not as much as the drier Elder. The finish has thick, malty sweetness as well as a very solid and pleasant bitterness.
Me and Joe both agreed that the mouthfeel is the highlight of this beer. Perfect as far as the style goes. It's thick and gooey, but with a clean and dry finish. It made me think of a hop flavored gummy bear. I would give it a 6, but I can't, so it gets a 5. The half growler gave me a good buzz, and was enjoyable to drink till the end.
I didn't like the beer as much as I thought I would, but that's only because the expectations were so high. A lot of people rave and rate highly of this beer for great reason. It needed a bit stronger of a hop aroma for me, but maybe the condition of a shipped growler affected that. I'd love to have it again someday. 1,694 charactersjeffthecheff, Feb 21, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5I had several ounces of Pliny the Younger poured by Vinnie himself at the Extreme Beerfest.
The beer pours a golden honey color with a small, creamy white head on top. The aroma is all flowery and grapefruit citrus hops.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is chewy with a mild fizz on the palate. The flavor is mostly citrus and pine hop. Seems like cascade or centennial hops to me. Throughout is a nice sweet, caramel malty flavor that is a good balance to all the hops. It finishes with some alcohol and once gone the citrus hop flavor lingers on the palate.
For 11% abv this is a well balanced beer. Mostly hoppy, but the sweet malt holds its own. Definitely a sipping beer that will warm your insides after one pint. 723 charactersWanderingFool, Feb 21, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to a very generous BA for dealing with the madness at the release and shipping through one of the worst storms DC has ever seen to get this to me. It's been a long weekend of driving up and back to Buffalo and I've been looking forward to opening this growler.
Poured from a growler into my Russian River tulip glass. Pours an amber orange color with a one finger white head. The head settled and clung to the sides of the glass where it left excellent lacing on the sides. 
Aroma pretty hoppy with citrus, grapefruit, pineapple and pine all present in the nose. It also has a somewhat sweet aroma to it which I really like. It smells so fresh and delicious, it really showcases the hops better then any other beer I have had.
The taste is just as hoppy as the nose lets on. It has a good amount of pineapple and grapefruit flavors up front with more of a pine finish. There is a sweetness to it that is stronger up front and then is somewhat balanced out by the bitter pine finish. The alcohol is a little present in the finish, and it definitely gives you a warming feeling after a glass. They really do an excellent job on both this one and elder at getting that sweet flavor but also balance it out with the bitterness in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good especially for the abv. It's a very good tasting and smooth drinking beer which makes it very drinkable. It is pretty high in alcohol content and that is quite evident after drinking one glass so there is a definite limit on how much of this I want to drink. 1,583 charactersbillab914, Feb 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Walked into one of favorite bars and there it was. I was very happy. 
A- Orange, amber with a beauty of a white 2 finger head. I was surprised I did not see hops floating in the beer. 
S- Huge pine, citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, orange) and hops. 
T- Hops tons, a touch sweet and balanced very well with the malt backbone, resiney. A touch of alcohol that burns slighty. Amazing tasting beer.
M- Nice medium body with perfect carbonation that coats the mouth wonderfully.
D- 11%, no problem I threw back two of these in an hour and was ready for more. It was so smooth for what this is. Very easy to drink. 
Overall this is one of my favorite beers. Amazing, and glad I got to try this one. A hop lovers wet dream. 721 charactersipafool, Feb 20, 2010

You rock! Poured from the standard 2L Russian River sweet looking swingtop at Dave's place with a bunch of Chicago beer crew.
A: Pours a pretty clear orangy/yellowish amber color with multiple fingers of white frothy head.
S: Smells real floral, dank, and hoppy with sweet citrus and grapefruit notes. It's not super intense like some beers I've had but quite great smelling.
T: Tastes of sweet citrus abound in this hop bomb with a nice but subtle malt backbone. Flavors of grapefruit, floral, dank, and candy like flavors are present. There's a residual bitterness (punchy but not overwhelming) that simmers down over time.
M: The first few sips are somewhat resiny or oily almost, but then quickly becomes smooth. It's full bodied and viscous on the tongue due to above average carbonation, even out of the growler. Only a slight tingle in the throat on the way down though.
D: The more I drink, the easier it is to drink. Considering the potency of this beer it is amazing how sessionable it is. I keep yearning for more and more, which makes this a dangerously delicious brew with a deceptively low alcohol flavor despite a higher ABV. 1,304 charactersdukedevil0, Feb 20, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to errantnight for hooking me up with this long time want.
Growler poured into a Sam Adams Pint glass produced a finger worth of white head, that goes to a nice ring of lace that slides down the glass. The body of the brew is a clear golden yellow to orange in color.
The first thing I notice at the cracking of the growler, was the hiss and the aromas of fresh hops. Big pine and cat piss (LOL) along with citrus and grasses. There is a wide rage of hop aromas coming from this one. One of the best noses from a DIPA I have ever smelled.
The flavor can best be described as Elder on steroids. I don't know if it's the malts that add balanced to this hop forward brew, or the alcohol warmth. There is a nice light orange flavor sweetness coming from the elixir. With the hop dryness holding back the alcohol warmth in the end. The brew has a medium feel to it with surprisingly good carbonation to it for a growler. A true testament to Derek stately care of this one.
Well I have a growler of this one to cherish for the whole day, and I didn't even have to stand in line at the EBF for it. I will make a few calls to see if anyone want to help finish this but I won't be to sad if I cant find anyone ;-) 
I do know I won't be driving too much today though. Final thoughts... As an east coast guy I wish it was a little more balanced, but it is true to form for an west coast DIPA 1,393 charactersjoepais, Feb 20, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Was lucky enough to be at Pizza Port San Clemente on Valentines night and got talking to the bartender. Great beer there as always. Well, the bartender told me they had two five gallon kegs waiting to go on tap. He didn't tell me it would be on at opening, but he also didn't think they would put it on later in the day.
So this guy spent the night sleeping in front of the door waiting for them to open. The wife and I walked in and gave the secret handshake and were presented with two, maybe 8 or 10 oz. pours of this luscious, amazing elixir.
I drank my first in less than two minutes because I didn't want them to run out. (There were only three other people in the bar). I was able to have four myself as well as the four my wife had.
I am very much able to handle strong beers, but let me tell you, these four youngers really did a number on my Monday.
Then I think back and wonder if the two jack and cokes I had before PP had anything to do with it.
Overall, I will say that this batch is as good as any of the others I have tried. It goes down well, and the alcohol is virtually unnoticed until a few hours later when it's time for a nap.
Enjoy it if you can... 1,176 charactersschuey1010, Feb 20, 2010

Pours an orangey copper with a tiny head. 
Smells deep of citrus, pineapple. It's a real deep and inviting aroma. Almost like you're squeezing the fruit into the beer yourself.
All there with a malty balance. To me, this tastes nowhere near as good as it smells. It's not a hop bomb, much more balanced than I thought/wanted.
Medium carbonated and extremely drinkable for an 11% brew. 
I was a little let down with this one. I much prefer fresh Elder, HopSpam and Sculpin to this. A damn fine beer but nothing to push grandmothers down for. 662 charactersrudylaw, Feb 20, 2010

A= pours a nuclear orange with minimal head. The head falls fast and leaves some decent lacing. The color is beautiful.
S= Big pine and grapefruit. Nice tropical fruit smells. Pineapple in it. Reminds me of hopslam a little bit.
T= This is where hopslam and this beer seperate. The hops in this are much more of a resiny hop. Loads of plant matter taste. Almost a fresh hop taste. I feel like I can taste some plant matter in it almost. Really big piney hops. The malts take a back seat to the hops for sure. Really nice taste on this baby.
M= Smooth and creamy. Slick and coating.
D= Perfect drinkabliity. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Thanks for the bottle. I'm glad I got the try it. 896 charactersjjanega08, Feb 20, 2010

A - Pours a delightful honey color. Clean and clear looking, with a small foamy white head. Gentle lacing.
S - Super grassy piney notes. The smell is so full of hops, it almost smells like marijuana. The smell is not upsetting, but it is the best way I can describe it. There is just so much plant in there.
T - Sweet citrus taste at first. This is short lived, as a HUGE burst of grassy piney hops hit you in the mouth. There is a touch of sweet malt, but it is again quickly consumed by hops, this time, it is bitterness. The finish is dry and crisp. It is absolutely awesome.
M - Medium bodied beer with moderate to high carbonation. The bubbles are very fine, like a good champagne. Very nice.
D - Dangerously drinkable. No trace of alcohol in the taste. Super smooth and delicious. This is a beer I could, but shouldn't drink all night. My goodness, I wish it was made more than once a year. Glad I got to try it this year. 1,090 charactersGenghis22, Feb 19, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver on Tuesday and was very lucky to have gotten the two glasses of it that I did as the first keg was gone after about 10 minutes, and the second very shortly thereafter. 
Poured a great golden amber almost honey color with about three fingers of off-white head that lasted quite some time and laced very well as it went down the glass. Aroma was a strong citrus grapefruit smell with little alcohol present on the nose given the ABV. Taste is similar to the smell as the citrus grapefruit flavors are very prevalent, with some sweetness as well. Feel is smooth and slightly syrupy with a slight tickle of carbonation on the tongue. Overall the beer was great, and if more had been available could have been dangerous given the alcohol content combined with the enjoyability of this beverage. 837 charactersjacobseyb, Feb 19, 2010

Served in my Russian River pint glass.
A: Remarkably clear, beautifully light in color, effervescent, white fluffy head that leaves generous amounts of sticky lacing 
S: Huge hop aroma with grapefruit, citrus, floral notes. Alcohol virtually non-detectable in the nose. 
T: This beer is worth all the hype. Wow! Unbelievably smooth. Huge hops, no astringency, the bitterness and sweetness walk a tightrope of perfection. The taste hits you initially with smooth hops, then transitions to a sweet, sticky deliciousness that coats the palate, and finishes with a wonderful bitterness that begs to begin the sequence again.
M: Everything is perfect here - carbonation, freshness, this beer is phenomenal.
D: At 11%, this beer kicked my ass, and I loved it. I finished three pints, and would've hurt myself even worse if we didn't run out. 906 charactersHuhzubendah, Feb 19, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks to treyrab for sharing some of his growler with me! Couldn't wait to dig into this one after all I had heard about it and was eager to see what this beer was all about. Poured into my tulip glass...
A: Pours a rich copper color with minimal bubbles during a fairly aggressive pour. The head is slow to develop and it bubbles up from the depths of this beer to form a somewhat coarse half-finger head. The head lingers for a little while then completely vaporizes. Lacing comes in spiderweb-like patterns.
S: This beer is a masterpiece of hop use. Burying my nose in my glass, there is not even a slight hint of grassy or piney hops. My nose is inundated by huge citrus notes and mounds of bitterness. Grapefruit and orange dominate the aroma, coupled with a bitterness and balance that is nothing short of incredible.
T: The taste is almost the same as the aroma, with the notable exception that the taste also incorporates a piney hop bitterness in the finish. The grapefruit is really striking here, and it takes some of the focus away from the orangey hops. Alcohol is completely imperceptible. You couldn't hide it better if you tried.
M/D: As might be expected after the notable hop profile, the feel is somewhat sticky, syrupy, and resinous with hops. Incredibly smooth, this beer is very surprising. I didn't think that such a hopped-up beer could be so drinkable and balanced. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, and Russian River strikes a delicate balance between the bitter character of the hops and the flavors that they impart to the beer.
Overall an incredible beer. 1,598 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Feb 19, 2010

Pours a clear golden orange, very small head and pretty (but small) lacing. Small, attractive carbonation. Smell is excellent, hoppy and spicy and piny and honey.
Taste is surprising -- honey and floral, lots of hop bitterness, strong lingering bitter aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is light and airy, quite drinkable, very pleasant beer, despite all the hype. 390 characterssnaotheus, Feb 19, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is definitely the pinnacle of IPA's. The IPA has a beautiful caramel color, similar to an old German Riesling and a wonderful hop aroma that makes you feel as if you're running through a field of hop vines. The taste embodies the classic characteristics of a West Coast IPA with strong presence of bittering hops resembling Chinook. The mouthfeel is amazing, very smooth and fully bodied with less carbonation than a typical West Coast which improves its drinkability. You can easily suck back several pints of the Younger without worrying that your taste buds will be recked. Overall, an amazing IPA worth the status of number one Beer on the Planet 660 charactersTheBeerCarl, Feb 18, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to jrallen34 who let me share his growler with him.
A - Very attractive looking beer, slightly dark, golden color, can see clear through on it. Bubbles cascade toward the top, bit of a head, that dissipated, left some bubbles on the side but not really much in the way of lacing. Growler opened with a pop, but it was 15 days in there so guessing there would have been a bigger head on a fresh one.
S - Smelled the pine notes from 3 feet out, but when I got to actually inspecting the nose it was not nearly as strong as I was anticipating. Pine dominates, no real citrus hops like I would have guessed. The pine is not overpoweringly bad like some of hop bombs though, it fades away to a nice sweet malt.
T - Pine and bitter right off the front end which fades into a decent sweetness before coming back with a some more piney hops and fading to a dry finish. Very complex, usually I consider a 3 stage beer a good thing, this one is a solid 4, maybe 5 if you count the return of the hops once the beer is gone from the mouth. Very nicely done. After a few swallows the bitterness is gone, and it's just piney and sweet, no real citrus that I can find though.
M - Smooth, nice finish. Carbonation was a little light, but assuming this is due to the growler. 
D - 11%? Seriously? Could destroy this all day, don't even taste the alcohol. Dangerous, way too drinkable for the abv. 1,391 charactersAgentZero, Feb 18, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5REVIEW 500!
I slayed a growler of this last night with the help of the other Matt. Weapon of choice was my Stone IPA tulip. I obtained a growler in a trade with great BA. As a result of our heroic undertaking, my mind is still not firing on all cylinders, but this is the best DIPA I've ever had and only my second straight 5.
Beer poured from a Russian River growler into a Stone IPA tulip. Beer is yellow to orange and CLEAR! The pour forms a white head about an inch to a half an inch in thickness that falls away leaving some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to high and really steady. The bubbles nucleate at the bottom of the glass mostly, beginning small but rise slowly increasing in size as they rise to the head. The head retention is good. No chill haze, beautiful color, good head dynamics, nice level of carbonation, its a beautiful beer.
Aroma is primarily a lot of hops....a lot of hops. Very citrusy with some pine notes in there. There is some sweetness, its a dominate aroma component. Its difficult but sometimes I think I can smell some alcohol but mostly I can not. For being such a huge beer, I really can't tell based on the aroma at all. The aroma is also huge. I can smell it from across the table. I found myself not even drinking it just smelling it, very complex, very big, very wonderful.
Taste time, balance. This beer hits all the parts of the palate, forward, middle and back. Obviously there is hop bitterness in the back, there is some sweetness up front, but no alcohol. Beer is medium bodied, definitely not a malt bomb like some DIPAs tend to be. There are almost fruit notes in the mid-palate. Some sweet orange or almost lime flavors. Beer finishes cleanly, leaving no aftertaste. Bitterness grows as it does with most big hoppy beers, but it does not interfere with the other flavors or drinkability.
I was going to originally rate the drinkability as a 4.5 for this beer. But I had some food between my pints of it and after some food a blew through my second pint. It is an amazingly balanced and completely wonderful IPA. At 11%, it is unlikely that I would make it my daily drinker, but it is the most dangerously drinkable 11% beer I've ever had.
EDIT: I had this again at EBF (4 ounce pour) and compared it side by side with Pliney the Elder. I realized as Matt and I were drinking this growler that it was an important but absent variable in my review is comparing it to another beer. We drug out an Exponential Hoppiness for comparison but it wasn't the right thing to do.
At the fest I had 4 ounces of each next to each other. My wife and I both tasted each and agreed that Younger was better than Elder. It was sweeter and thicker, had more fruit notes on the palate and smells were uncomparable. The hop aroma on Younger blew the hop aroma on Elder out of the water. I'm not going to write an additional review of this beer on draft, I just thought I would include these thoughts in my present review. 2,971 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 18, 2010
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Dave for sharing this, never thought i'd try it. 
Apparently review #1300...
Out of the sturdy genie bottle, it poured a golden yellow orange, with bright clarity and sticky residual lacing. Deeply resinous nose, almost cheesy, with a pleasant soft citrus undertone, and a touch of alcohol. Not super pungent, but very nice.
Floral and fruity citrus dominates, just a ton of grapefruit, softly bitter in the back, building to a dry firm bitterness in the finish. Super well balanced, soft and smooth feel. The bitterness is fairly easygoing, this wasn't as brutal as might be expected. Infinitely drinkable, a few snifters would be dangerous. 
Overall this is a fantastic west coast DIPA, maybe not the Best of All Time, but one to seek out for sure. Thanks again Dave for the opportunity! 807 charactersemerge077, Feb 18, 2010

A - Pours a golden/orange/copper color with a small white head. There's lots of lacing around the sides of the glass, sticky stuff! There's some head here and there on top of the beer, but just a hint here and there.
S - Very complex with lots going on here! Tropical fruit, smokey malts, straight-forward citrus, sweetness.
T - Mostly a malty sweetness mixed with a large amount of hops. The hops are def there, but it's not overdone. A nice bitter finish. 
M - Light, smooth, clean finish. Nice carbonation, just frothy enough to let you know it's there but not enough to take away from the beer itself. 
D - So so easy to drink, it's scary! Probably won't have another glass until 2011 unless I get lucky again.
I wasn't totally blown away by this beer as some others are. It's as good as Elder, probably neck and neck. Would have been nice to have them both for a side by side. I think I prefer Elder to Younger... 1,023 charactersSean9689, Feb 18, 2010

a- such a great coppery gold, very deep. Quite a large head, though I'm sure the balloon glass aided in that feature. Laces well.
s- such a big, great hop aroma. Obviously the focal point of this beer. Piney citrus all the way.
t- the best thing about this beer is it's clean flavor. I've never had an IPA this clean tasting (if that makes sense). A citrusy bitterness backed up with a balanced malt flavor. Very fresh.
m- not as carbonated as when i had it on tap (I think), but this might've been due to it's time in the growler. Medium carbonation.
d- this might be te only DIPA I've had that I can drink until passing out. Such a great beer. 678 charactersSaisonInTheAbyss, Feb 18, 2010
4.65/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I drank this from RR growler into my Rochefort chalice.
The beer pours a medium orange that is surprinsingly clear. The head rises about 3 fingers but falls quickly to a soapy cover. The lacing is light.
The aroma is much lighter than I had anticipated. The aroma is some hops mixed with a little pine and a bit of soap. 
The taste is also pretty light, much lighter than I thought it would be. It starts off a little sweet then goes to a full bitterness throughout. When you start out its a little bitter, but as your drink it, it becomes very drinkable.
The feel is medium in body, a semi dry feel, and a very lasting flavor.
The drinkablility is very high. You can't notice the 11abv but its highly drinkablility. 
Overall, this beer is really really good. Its smooth, drinkable, and a nice expenience. Its not overally hoppy which is nice. Is it the number 1 beer in the world, no? Is it the best ipa in the world, no? Is it a top 50 beer for me, yeah, its that good. 977 charactersjrallen34, Feb 18, 2010

S- The epitome of IIPA. Explosive, clean hop punch to the nostrils. 
T- A lot like Pliny. Bright, clean hop character. Just a touch of malt, but really all about the hops. Nice and dry. My only complaint is the slight taste of alcohol, though it's not bad for 10+%. Again, the epitome of IIPA. I almost prefer really fresh Elder as I find them similar minus the alcohol.
M- Perfect for the style, not too rich like the more barleywine-ish IIPAs, nice carbonation. 
D- I could drink a couple of these, and that's more than I can say for a lot of beers this high in alcohol. You know you're drinking some big beer from the warming, but for what it is it's pretty exceptional. 823 charactersMrFootstones, Feb 18, 2010

Massive piney hop aroma. Flavor is dominated by hop bitterness as you would expect, but there is a solid malt base without being sweet. Very drinkable for the abv, alcohol was not very evident. Lots of hops without being too green in the flavor. Nice mouthfeel, medium to full bodied. Believe the hype. 416 charactershomebrewhawk, Feb 18, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A very generous growler gift from my pal, Arbitrator! Thanks a million, my friend...
The waxed lever top popped off and released a heady aroma of tropical fruit and resiny pine. Like Hop Stoopid, I could just sit here and sniff the bottle for awhile, no need to drink right away. My wife asked if am drinking Pine Sol. She sniffed the tulip a bit closer and said, "Wow!". The smell alone is intoxicating. 
It poured a very generous foamy head and spread nearly perfect lacing around the glass interior. The foam dissipated quickly. It struck me as very dry, despite the fruit aroma overtones.
Massive hop bite, almost to the point of mint. The alcohol is clearly there but is cleverly masked by the herbal overlay. Thinner and less viscuous than expected but delivers a solid mouthfeel, nearly creamy. Not chewy like some I know...(Amnesia's and Laurelwood's products come to mind). Some scary level drinkability for an 11%er. Could put me on my ass easily. 
I love the resin taste. A bit more honey than I usually prefer but it does add a nice compliment to the dry character. Vinnie really nailed the balance on this big boy. Crisp and spicy with just enough earthy balance in there to even things out. Sticky but not sappy. An amazing bit of brewing magic - well worth the hype. 
Really a one of a kind Imperial/TIPA. Astounding. 1,337 charactersramnuts, Feb 18, 2010

Mmmmm. PTY, taste the hype. 
A---Good looking beer, no doubt about it, not a ton of head but well laced with a awesome orange hue.
S---Yep, this has some hops in it, lots of pine and some fruit esters.
T---Complex with a lot going on besides the hops, citrus of course, mango? Pineapple? For being a hop-bomb, this has a very nice flavor and finish.
M---dry and tart with the hops finish
D---I will say up front, hop-bombs are not really my thing. I have had this beer on two separate occasions and if you are a hop-head, this is a very solid choice, I like it much more than the Elder, which pretty much reminds me of Pine-sol. I guess that is what is funny about styles, Pty is treated like it is the second coming of Jesus or something, it is not. Dont trade away your first born to get this, but certainly make an effort to get some if you enjoy this style! 930 charactersgarbercury, Feb 17, 2010

A- As has been stated before, much lighter than I expected, looks like liquid gold. 1 finger head with great lacing. Nice carbonation, especially considering it spent a week on it's way across the country.
S- Hop smack to the face, I went cross eyed and laughed. Amazing aroma. Pine with fruit and floral notes.
T- Heavy citrus hops on the front. Some tropical in the middle with a nice pine in the finish. Slightly boozy. I hop orgasm.
M- Remarkably dry for a beer this big, great carbonation even from a growler.
D- I got pretty silly pretty quick, not sure if it was the excitement, the hops ripping through my system, or the 11% ABV. None the less, if this beer was available year round, I'm not sure I would drink anything else. 832 charactersBetterDarker, Feb 17, 2010

I greatly appreciate the bar abstaining from doing a hyped-up Pliny the Younger night. Much nicer in my opinion to bust this thing out quietly. 
The beer is nice to look at, has a nice fresh floral scent, and is at the same time a hop explosion and a well-balanced beer. I find it quite refreshing. You don't taste much of the 11% ABV. It's remarkable that a beer can be his hoppy, yet balanced and big. 504 charactersrealmpel, Feb 17, 2010

Pours a really clear yellow to light orange with some Hop residue in my glass, yep hops I say. I am not a great smeller, but I do smell a ton of hops. So, for a normal person, you would smell a mega ton, I bet. The taste is very floral and not over bittering, which is great in my book. I am not a bitter freak, I like hop flavors. Wish we could get this in Florida year round.

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review #200.
Something I never thought I'd get to try. Big HUGE thanks to Chad for the growler. Huge appreciation and beer karma headed your way! Thanks buddy!!
My inner hop head is mad at me. It's like he showed me this really cool club, vouched for me at the door, and introduced me to everyone. But now a days, I'm too busy hanging out with the Stouts and Wilds to even wave when I see him out. After this experience, I remember how much fun things used to be and I promise to spend more time and effort on the types of beer than got me into craft in the first place.
Which brings us to the actual review. A beautiful growler served cold, poured into open mouth tasting glasses.
Liquid gold in color, small white film of a head.
Smell is amazing. Hops rule this roost - citrus (grapefruit, orange, pineapple) and a touch of mint and alcohol. I could smell this all day; wow is this making my mouth water!
Best hoppy taste ever. A citrus punch in the face - earthy, peachy, pine, grapefruit - fades into a bitter lingering taste that is surprisingly NOT devastating but does score a significant blow on the palette. But the finesse between the hops and linger, and the levels of explosive flavor make this the best hoppy tasting beer I've had. Extreme and refined all in one - a brilliant tight-rope walk.
Mouthfeel was surprising on this one. It had appropriate lack of density and thin viscosity for the style but also felt significant. The carb was perfect and felt sharp when it needed to and creamy when it needed to. 
Drinkability - OK, if this is 11%, Vinny is a magician. One sip begs for another. Almost sessionable in its appeal and how quickly the glasses disappear.
After 200 ratings, I guess I'm one of those who aren't afraid to award 5's (in fact, one other beer got a perfect score across the board from me). But this is one of the best 2 beers I've ever had and certainly the best DIPA on the planet. We sat around after a pour and discussed - what could be this beer's flaw. Sure it's strong, but a DIPA should be. It's just so well crafted and the appearance, smell, and taste are so spot-on that it deserves to be rewarded. I'm sure our paths will cross again, Younger!
Cheers and here's to the next 200! 2,236 charactersjampics2, Feb 16, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've waited about 4 years to get a chance to try this beer, and am very glad to be able to do so just a few days after it took the top spot.
Appearance- Growler was full to the brim which was a nice thing because it seems little if any carbonation was allowed to escape. The color is what I would describe as gold with suggestions of caramelization that create some orange hues. Color-wise, this is is light for the style, especially considering the massive 11% ABV. The head is really dependent upon the pour, and being a growler fill I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Some lacing, but I'd like to see a bit more.
Smell- This is probably where PtY performs the best. The smell is incredible. It's dry hopped 4 times, and it shows. The main aromas in order of prevalance are grapefruit, orange, pine, and alcohol. In the background it seems there are faint traces of crystal and biscuity malts which offer up just a little bit of sweetness. I can pull vanilla bean out of the aroma too but it's a stretch, and I'm not sure where/what ingredient that's coming from.
Taste- Blistering bitterness. This is one of the most bitter beers that I can remember, keeping in mind that taste buds change from day to day, the only beer that I can think of that comes close in this respect is The Great Divide's Hercules DIPA (which I didn't like, but will try again). This beer is extemely hop-forward as a double or triple (as Russian River claims) IPA. There's still a good bit of malt to make moments sweet. I'm still surprised at the number of reviews that talk about how inperceivable the alcohol is in this... seriously? It's 11% or 22 proof, and not meant to be aged. If it were aged I suspect it would mellow out nicely, but that would defeat the purpose and the insane hop presence would fade quickly now wouldn't it? There are some complexities here with odd notes of vanilla coming through, but not quite as good complex to me as the Elder was.
Mouthfeel- Well... Full. Excellent carbonation for a growler fill.
Drinkability- I had no problem drinking this. A wonderful beer that I wish was more readily available. Well worth the wait. 2,149 characterslpayette, Feb 16, 2010

A - Pours copper-gold with 2 fingers of off-white head. Dissipates slow and leaves nice lacing.
S/T - Honey and caramel up front. Surprisingly malty for a 2X IPA. Notes of grapefruit and resiny pine on the finish. Very well-balanced, a good beer.
M - Full-bodied and well-balanced. Surprise that there is no alcohol feel in a 10.75% ABV beer.
D - Great overall, worthy of the #1 spot? No, worthy of a top-25? Definitely. Dangerously sessionable. The resininess is a bit much, but the malt feel is truly dynamic. 613 charactersMisterClean, Feb 16, 2010

T - very well balanced. like elder but more complex. too bad they wont bottle this.

4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Making a 125 mile trip worthwhile. Feb 13, 2010 was the start of a brew tour beginning at Port Brewing to grab some Red Poppy Ale and Angels Share Grand Cru.
Later spent the afternoon at Stone Brew and Bistro for some 2010 Baleywine and other famous Stone brews. Stone Brewerie had PtY on tap Thursday and were all out Saturday. I was told a local pub would have it on tap later in the evening.... I am there...
After 18 months I was able to have some Pliny the Younger in my hands so here it goes...
A: Pours radiant golden color with slight copper haze around the edges. Small frothy head that dissipated rather quick with nice lacing.
S: Very similar to PtE with a stronger smell of thick hops hanging around the fizz of alcohol. Reminds me of a thick forest after a rain.
T: Very well balanced. I am not sure if alcohol content of PtY helps balance the bitterness of the hops but let me tell you, it felt like a sweet tinge at the end.
M: Heavier and almost chewy compared to PtE.
D: Have to be carefull with this one. High ABV can hit you rather quickly since there is no end with PtY. Lighter ABV would make this brew highly drikable one after another.
Overall, PtY is the best DIPA I have had (for now)... 1,212 charactersBajasith, Feb 15, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Draft serving in a 0.5 L mug at Hollingshead.
A: Slightly hazy, rich golden color with less than one finger of diminishing white foam head. Minimal lacing left on the glass.
S: Moderate sweet floral and pine hops smell. No hint of alcohol. I was expecting a more overwhelming smell to this beer.
T: Intense pine hops flavor with increasing bitterness as the aromatic flavors fade. The flavor is surprisingly balanced for what this beer is, yet the alcohol is not at the forefront. It tickles my palate in a most satisfying way and makes me smile at the thought of another sip.
M: Medium-bodied texture and light to moderate carbonation is noticed, but not distracting in any way. Seems appropriate for the style, similar to other RR IPAs.
D: Any hophead could endure more than a healthy portion of this beer, yet the abv is a limiting factor. This beer is a fine double IPA although not really in a class by itself, save for the high abv. It makes me recall a tulip of Deschutes Hop Henge reserve batch that I enjoyed at their Portland pub during Summer, 2009--another carefully crafted double IPA with a definite pine flavor and aroma. Perhaps the most notable attribute of this beer is the hype that surrounds it. Having just returned from a neighborhood deli where it was standing-room-only, the sky currently seems to be the limit. Russian River would be wise to preserve this feature of their beer, although the masses may clamber for more. 1,450 charactersbeagle75, Feb 15, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I want to do a standard review, but this deserves so much more. I'll start with appearance. This beer poured a burnt orange color that was lightly effervescent, but had great lacing and head retention. Smell was slightly piney, but more florally and citrusy. This is bitter. And not a harsh and spicey bitter, but a citrusy and floraly bitter. The younger gives it smell every cent it's worth. Hints of diacetyl on the malt. This is very well balanced. More on the hoppy side, but the malt gives the perfect smootheness to it that makes it so drinkable. Hops sit on the palate and fills the nose with that perfumy floral hops. I had a 17 oz pour and I've become a philosopher. Amazing beer. Never had better. 708 characterspnkRed, Feb 15, 2010

A- Bright glowing orange hue with a white head that was a little less than half a finger. 
S- Hoppy-citrus and piney, could have inhaled this beer all night. 
T- Sweet Citrus hop-bomb with hints of floral taste, 11% ABV was expertly hidden. 
M- Crisp and refreshing, perfectly balanced carbonation no one taste overpowered. 
D- Wish I had a growler, but was glad to have any. I probably would have been a mess, but if I had a growler I surely would have finished it in one night. 
I have had Dreadnaught, the Elder, Hopslam, Sculpin and a few others in the last two weeks and I could see why PtY is clearly the CHAMP. 762 charactersJoeynocturnum, Feb 15, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A huge thanks to tzanio for this one!
L: Pours a clear bright orange-yellow color with a big and fluffy off-white colored head that sticks around for some time and leaves a nice amount of lacing down the glass.
S: Smells of sweet malts, a whole bunch of citrus - grapefruit, mostly - then a huge earthy, citrus-y, and piney hop aroma. 
T: Not what I was expecting from the nose. I was expecting a hop bomb, but this was not it, not even close. The hops were there for sure, but they did not overpower the beer with one kind of hop flavor. It was a mix of earthy, piney, citrusy, and floral all mixed expertly together for that perfect IPA taste. The beer was balanced out expertly with the malt base and the flavors were excellent.
M: Very crisp, fresh, refreshing, perfect amount of carbonation, lighter feeling than I thought it would be.
D: Very drinkable, I split the growler with some friends (all beer lovers) and we all loved it. The growler was gone in no time and we were wishing for more. 999 characterserosier, Feb 15, 2010
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5REVIEW # 400 (FOR ME)
I've been seeking this brew for 2 years now, so it is an appropriate choice for my 400th review! Growler received in a trade with nick717 who is da man! Growler shared with beerloco, mrsbeerloco, and StonyB.
Appearance: Pours a radiant brilliant goldfish orange with a slight haze. The crown is a slightly buttery white, very frothy/frappy, shows medium retention and lots of lace.
Smell: In the words of Will Ferrels movie "Semi-Pro" its time to get tropical! LOADS of perfectly balanced grapefruit, pine resin, and a medley of hops which seems (to my novice palate) to be simcoe, columbus, centennial, etc. A whisper of alcohol rounds out the flavor and seems like it belongs (different from PTE). 
Taste: Same as nose...slightly sweet pale malt, hints of biscuit, a pungent bouquet of fruity resinous hops, etc. The juiciness of the hops counterbalances the bitterness perfectly.
Mouthfeel: Same as PTE only a touch more chewy.
Drinkability: It is wasn't for the 11% abv I'd score it at a 5.0 because this is an extremely drinkabile triple ipa.
PTY lives up to the hype. 1,102 characterskoopa, Feb 15, 2010
3.68/5  rDev -21.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks a million to alcstradamus for his generosity.
So this is it, the new number 1! Opening the growler produces a loud hiss, which is obviously a great sign. 
Poured into an Allagash tulip-type glass, it is a fairly clear golden orange body capped by a white fluffy head. It shows good retention, and produces sheets of lace on its way down. After several minutes I am left with a thin collar and a decprated glass. 
Nice aroma, with a combination of multiple tropical fruits, pineapple and grapefruit at the forefront, with caramel malts and cookie dough coming out from time to time. 
I have to disagree with buckeyenation here, as this one feels a lot closer to barleywine than a pure hopbomb. Yes, the flavor shows a hop explosion, with all the above mentioned fruity hoppiness, grtapefruit and pineapple, and fortunately, the grapefruit is noit overpowering, but maltiness is clearly present. 
Caramel and cookies are there, and there are some sweet traces on the palate. 
Nice carbonation, lending a smooth consistency. 
This is a good beer, but IMHO, far from #1. 
I am very glad I had this opportunity, thanks again to alcstradamus, but I believe Hopslam and Dreadnaught are better. 
OBS: As I finished my review, and a new average is made, it is now at #2. Westy is back on top. 1,292 charactersbrdc, Feb 15, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Quite clear with a smallish head that dissipates quickly leaving a little bit of foam around the edge of the glass. This beer smells fabulous. To quote a friend "if hops had a vagina this is what it would smell like" The fresh, grassy, grapefruity, cleanliness of this aroma is what I want to reek of when I get out of the shower. (even though I would probably find myself only able to attract middle-aged fat and/or balding men with beards). The flavor follows the smell, though it is not as complex or nearly so orgasmic. Super-dry and bracingly bitter, I would even say that the bitterness is a bit over the top, but only a bit. The mouthfeel is unremarkable, acceptable levels of carbonation... not tannic or anything.
 I kinda stopped taking notes at this point because I got enthralled by actually consuming this beer. It is made for drinking, that much is for sure, but my two glasses sent me straight to bed... yummy stuff. 932 charactersOrangevango, Feb 14, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Much thanks to Sugit for providing this growler. This was definitely an experience, and we drank it on the very day (2/13/10) it takes the BA #1 spot. There isn't much that hasn't already been said, but here are my thoughts.
A - Pours a light amber, golden color (lighter than expected) with impressive 2 finger head. Impressive, of course, because of the 11% ABV and the week's time spent in the growler. Interestingly, there were many tiny flecks apparent when looking closely at the glass. Are these hop chunks?
S - For a hop lover, this is worth the price alone. It was overpowering in a very good way. If you try really hard, you can tell there are some malts in the beer. You'd never be able to tell there was any alcohol though. How did that happen??
T&M - We had a chance to drink this at the same time as Pliny the Elder. It made Elder taste like Pliny Lite. They were similar, with Younger being everything Elder was, only amped up. Of course, the hops are on a whole different level, but the malt backbone in Younger compared to Elder is quite a bit more pronounced, especially as the beer warms. Still a lighter mouthfeel compared to others in the IIPA/IIIPA category, even with the added malt backbone.
D - This is the third time I've said this, but where is the alcohol? At first, I was sure the 11% was a lie. Then, the kink I had in my back faded away, along with all the world's troubles. It was a good thing the growler was the size it was. I had no power to stop drinking this on my own. See you next year, hopefully! 1,540 charactersdougofthefuture, Feb 14, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Many, many thanks to Wespatrick for sharing this gem. Had at a tasting last night, Feb 13th. Reviewed from notes.
"Well, here we are then, gents. It's officially.. well, apparently, the best in the land."
"Go ON then, let's have at it!"
A hissy-pop and up swings the cap, as the aroma already begins to waft about the room, blending with the cheese-and-crackers upon the table, and making quite a name for itself, though we have yet to tilt it.
A glug-glug and it's in the glass in front of me, and the seriousness of evaluating comes due. 
There's an almost-clear orange with tiny specks afloat throughout... "What is that?" "What?" "The specks there." "I don't see them." "Don your glassies then, old man!" "Ah... I suppose just a lack of filtering, then, and perhaps tiny hop-pebbles." "Lovely."
A finger-thick head rises up but settles quickly, at first gives the illusion of lace, but then shows itself to be sliding down after every savory sip.
A long, enjoyable whif, and the loads of grapefruit and resin come out. "Gents, it smells just like Sculpin!" "Ah, come off it, not just like Sculpin!" "No. Really."
The aroma and flavour are both monstrously grapefruity, with just a bit of resin thrown in... "Come along fellows, let us be honest, all of us know what a grapefruit tastes like, but when was the last time you chewed pine needles?" "Ah... what time is it? About... eight hours ago." Guffaws all round.
The percentage really does little to show itself except in a bit of warming after each swallow. The carbonation is medium-high, the body is rather thin, it's a tad boozy. But just a tad. "Really though? Have you ever had an 11% that was so drinkable?" "Yes sir. Unearthly." "Ah. Touche."
It only makes sense, as Wes pointed out, that this be the number one DIPA on the site, with Sculpin being the number 1 IPA. I could not get it out of my head that this beer is precisely imperial Sculpin. Just the same dangerous drinkability (As in, if a drinkability scale could go higher than five, this beer would be there), the exact same grapefruit-dominant hop profile, an excellent and well-crafted beer. The best DIPA? Not to my palate, but obviously well-deserving. 2,181 characterskhiasmus, Feb 14, 2010

Growler popped loud and we all scream YESSS!Poured a nice golden orangish color with great carbonation and nice white head. Nose is pine, grapefruit, booze, perhaps hint of ornage peel. Taste is pine, grapefruit murdering the palate with hops, bittering medium way with floral, citrus and hop oils coming out, caramel and booze being pretty subdued by all the damn flavors. Mouthfeel is light booze, stinging, oils but dry at the same time, pine. Drinkability, best enjoyed with many friends. 549 charactersbarleywinefiend, Feb 14, 2010

Slight offwhite head. Struggling carbonation. Gorgeous 
from the looks this is a substancial beverage...it sits in a Belgian tulip glass ready to pounce like a massive orange tiger. 
Get anywhere within a few feet of this beverage and you'll be treated to a blast of dank citrusy floral spicy deliciousness. 
Pure hop oils pulsating, filling the air and your nostrils in a way that no other dipa can do. Put your nose to the glass and it smells like opening vacuum sealed packets of all the finest
american hop varieties put together in a symphony of perfection.
Such amazing hop design going on here. 
Drinking it unloads this symphony of aroma into your mouth. Take a sip and you'll quickly want a gulp--this is 11% abv but somehow it drinks like a session beer. Flavor is rich sticky resiny hops balanced with tropical fruit citrus pine dank garlic
spicy herbal. The resins just coat your mouth and suck you in
how does a beer this big with so much ibu and dry hopping finish so dry? I can't figure it out. Insanely good and my favorite double ipa of all time. Year after year Russian river kicks total ass with this one 1,184 characters59071240749, Feb 14, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many Thanks to a very generous trader for hooking me up with this one. I can't thank you enough (!), especially with all the craziness surrounding the release. I split this side by side with Elder (bottled 1/14) with my homie Jeff the other night. 
Pours a surprisingly clear orangey amber. Darker than elder, but still has a bit of chill haze. Sturdy white-ish foam has better retention than elder (surprisingly), good spottyish lacing. Very attractive, such an innocent looking beer for a concoction of this magnitude both in its abv and flavor profile. Some of the final pours from the growler sent (hop?) particles into suspension.
Hop aromas are mostly sappy, sticky pine, but a definite woodiness to it (not oak though), first noted by my fellow taster, Jeff. Some tropical fruit and juicy grapefruit. A little booze in the nose is undeniable as it warms with just the slightest sweet malt note through the back. Still, this subtle alcohol note is nowhere near enough to indicate its 11% strength. I really liked the hop profile, but I was expecting it to be slightly more pungent. I'm sure it's a little better on tap at the source, but this was still an excellent aroma. Compared to elder, it was a similar hop profile, but there was actually more caramel in elder's aroma. 
Taste is just as great. Very firm bitterness lasts throughout. Great, expressive hop flavor with juicy citrus and pineapple. The most surprising thing about this beer is the mouthfeel. It is substantial as fuck. It would be a 6 if possible. Great and chewy and just so unlike any other DIPA. So naturally, with that amount of residual sugar, there is some caramel malt sweetness mid palate - but it is at times easily overshadowed by the hop blast. Booze is less apparent than in the aroma, but still just hinted at. Once again, nowhere near the 11% which is very impressive. The lasting hop bitterness outplays any booze that might have otherwise been able to linger. 
Really drinkable. As soon as I took my first sip I was questioning the 11%, and still questioned it during the last glass I poured. Such a pleasant experience and overall just really an amazing beer. Vinnie continues to amaze the craft beer world with masterful brews like this one. I look forward to trying this in future years and hopefully at the source one day. I am very lucky to have been able to try it and will have to try and find a way to pay back the generous trader who sent it out. Cheers! 2,459 charactersIneedabeerhere, Feb 14, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5HUGE thanks to Chad, a fellow Hoosier that's been transplanted to California. 64oz swing-top growler from the brewery. Served in an oversized tulip and shared with fellow BA infestaxion.
A: Pours a magnificent looking crystal golden orange. A finger plus of white, pitted fluff sits on top, taking it's sweet time to fade. Lacing is fantastic, leaving patchy white remnants all over the glass. 
S: The first thing that comes to me is this is the United Nations of hops. There is big juicy citrus and tropical fruit notes, mango, papaya, pineapple and tangerines. Underneath that bouquet is some dirty, grassy hops that impart a decent amount of pine. When I popped the growler and poured the first glass, my friend could smell the beer from 7-8 feet away. Yea, it's that good.
T: Pure hoppy bliss. Much of what I detailed above transfers over to the taste. The hops and malts mesh perfectly, providing some nice bitterness and counter balancing sweetness. Most impressive is the finish, which imparts a level of complexity I've not had in a DIPA before. The aftertaste also leaves a great hoppy presence and a big damn smile on your face.
M: Thick, creamy, smooth, silky, sexy, beefy and not overly sticky. Carbonation is about a perfect as you can get. Bottom line is this is everything you want in a big, fresh Double IPA.
D: If this wasn't already listed as 11% ABV, I wouldn't have believed it. There is very little trace of heat or booze present. The bitterness and sweetness do add up over multiple servings, but for such a big hoppy beer it doesn't get much more drinkable than this.
This is one of those beers that certainly lives up to the hype. Vinnie and Russian River have delivered what has to be one of the best Double IPA's on the planet. I'm really glad I had the chance to sample this fantastic brew. Hopefully down the road when they have the capacity, RR will bottle this beer and more people will have a chance to try it. 1,947 charactersheliosphann, Feb 14, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Growler from augustgarage. Many thanks!
Poured into my Firestone Walker pint glass.
A- Lighter than expected.. golden honey in color. 3-finger head that laces impossibly well for an 11% beer. Must be the hops, lol. There's a half-finger of head that refuses to go away.. carbonation looks like it held up well in the cross-country trek.
 I've never seen a beer over 10% that has head retention like this.. especially a week-old growler. Damn. Creamy as all hell... lacing is fire-extinguisher-esque in body. 
S- Hop assault. Piny, fruity, floral. Similar to Pliny the Elder, just a bit more behind it. 
T- Citrus hops, full-throttle. Tangerine/grapefruit and a bit of pineapple. Some tropical mango/papaya. Some pine hops, which come through as 'new-growth' with a bit of an octane quality. A bit of booze and a bit of a peppery note in the finish. This beer is incredibly fresh.
M- Where's the ABV? Choked out by the hops. Phenomenal. I cannot believe this is 11%. Dry.. and I can't believe how much the sweetness of an 11% DIPA is in check. I've had 8% beers that have more cloying sweetness to them.
D- Insane. Growler was no problem. This beer lives up to any and all hype. Takes everything I love about Pliny the Elder and fucking doubles down. Whoa. Excuse the profanity.. the stealth ABV must be creeping in. 
I've reviewed 300+ beers and enjoyed probably close to 500 beers since joining beeradvocate. This is, by leaps and bounds, the best beer I've had. And here I thought I was getting sick of DIPAs. Holy. shit. 
For those of you living vicariously through reviews, PtE and Alpine Pure Hoppiness are close flavor-wise. 1,639 charactersShogoKawada, Feb 14, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler received from jfh. Thanks a ton for this one! Poured into a Bruery tulip.
A - Pours a crystal clear, light orange copper color with a finger of fluffy off white head that leaves some nice sticky lacing on the sides of the glass. Surprisingly good amount of head for such a strong beer.
S - Could smell this one from a couple of feet away from the glass. Huge hit of hops - tons of grapefruit, some peach, lots of pine. Just huge hop aromas - a hop lovers dream. A hint of sweetness, maybe a bit flowery in there, seems to enhance the hops.
T - Hops up front as expected. Loads of citrus...this could replace my grapefruit juice in the mornings. Lots of pine sitting side by side with the grapefruit, along with some peach and mango...maybe even a slight touch of lemons too. Still pretty dry, but compared to the Elder, there is much more of a malt backbone in here...a bit sugary, a bit caramelly. This is defnitely part of the flavor profile, but it really sits far in the background and doesn't interfere at all with the hops...there's nothing stopping hops on here.
M - Quite full bodied...more so than I expected. Hops really must be overpowering the unfermented sugars left behind here. Given the relative dryness of this beer, I expected a thinner body, but this is definitely on the thick side. Carbonation is the typical Russian River smooth...tiny, fine carbonation bubbles give a prickly but velvety smooth feel (as a homebrewer, I wish I knew how to achieve this carbonation character - I'm envious). Mouth is filled with resiny, bitter hops and seems to leave a film of hops oils behind. Excellent.
D - For an 11.0% beer, this is extremely smooth. I would almost call this too damn drinkable. If I was sitting somewhere with this on tap, I feel like I could quickly put away a few of these and end up in real trouble. Really well done example showing how drinkable a high alcohol beer can be... 1,920 charactersportia99, Feb 14, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5APPEARANCE 
Pours a clear gold color with medium white head. Lots of sticky lacing.
AROMA 
Light citrus and grassy notes. It smells delicious but honestly I expected a bigger aroma.
FLAVOR
Grassy , citrusy hops perfectly balanced with sugar cookie malt. Tropical fruit (pineapple), and grapefruit predominantly. I love the way the hops slowly fades away. How is it possible for a beer to be so bitter and smooth at the same time.
MOUTHFEEL
Medium body with a silky texture. Moderate carbonation.
DRINKABILITY
I was a little worried that this beer was not going to meet my high expectations. I am happy to say it did. To me it drinks like a fine wine. It is hoppy but perfectly balanced with malt. It is high in alcohol but I struggle to pick it up. I just wish you could get it more often. 789 charactersseanbhudson, Feb 14, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was totally stoked to get a growler of this in the mail yesterday. Many many many thanks again go out to mjl21...Mike you made my year with this beer!
A- Pours a light hazed golden light copper color. One finger fluffy white head stays for a short bit. I wasn't expecting this with the ABV so high. Streaky lacing down the entire tulip as I drank away. 
S- This is a citrus hop bomb. Everything smells so fresh that I can't believe it. In your face aromas of pineapple, orange, grapefruit, and even apricot thrown in there for good clean fruity goodness. Very light caramel malt backbone that only makes it way in hints to the nose. Alcohol is not really present until a little more into the beer. But even when this thing is warm the alcohol doesn't make itself known. No real bitter or piney hops in the nose as at all. 
T- The citrus hops that are in the aroma are still here in the beer but not as overpowering. Still real big citrus hops right off the bat. Some light bready malts in the middle help to balance this for a second before hops take over once again toward the end. The alcohol makes a bigger presence once the beer warms but it still is nothing that you really notice at all. This is a very hops forward beer that makes a blend of cirtus-y hops and not just one. 
M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect for the beer. Leaves a very oily hop resin over everything in the mouth...teeth included. Hops are all over the palate and aftertaste is more citrus hops. Drying on the palate. Very smooth without any jerking motion in the flavors. Crisp and very clean tasting. 
D- This is one hell of a drinking beer. I only labeled it a 4.5 in drinkability because although I could sip on this all day I would not want to waste the experiance on getting trashed! I would recommend this beer to everyone out there. The high ABV limits this beer but I could have finished this growler in one sitting....I just wanted to remember how everything tasted though. 1,975 charactersalleykatking, Feb 13, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I can honestly say this is a beer that I never thought I'd have the opportunity to drink, but I'm extremely grateful to chris for hooking me up with a growler from the most recent release. I am especially thankful because it sounds like it sold out in about 5 hours this year.
I'll be the first to say that IPA's are not my favorite style, but I do have a select few that I enjoy a great deal and so my rating of this beer is in comparison to the IPA's and double IPA's that I love.
First, let me start by saying that the growler that this came in was one of the coolest looking growlers I've ever seen...that by itself was a good start to this beer. I popped the top on the growler the night I received it in the mail which was exactly one week from when it was poured and the top popped as if it were poured yesterday. It pours a beautiful dark straw orange color with 3 fingers of heavy and a generous amount of carbonation. The head eventually dwindles down to a thin lacing on top of the beer, but this lacing never disappears which i thought was really impressive with this beer. It also leave a generous amount of lacing around my pint glass. The smell is incredibly balanced. I expected a hop bomb, but what I got was sooo much more. Smells of dry malt, citrusy hoppiness, pine. Its actually very effervescent and very pleasent to smell. The taste and mouthfeel were even better than the smell. I can't believe this is 11%. I could seriously drink a ton of this beer in a sitting and never get bored with it. Great balance of intial citrus hops, pine, mint and malt. Whats great though is that the finish is dry without any annoying after tastes that I usually get from big IPA's. Like I said this is absolutely delicious and oh so drinkable. I definetely felt the alcohol as the night went on, but just delicious to drink and not too over powering. I wish this beer was produced more often because I really love it. I've had seeral other highly rated IPA's including 3Floyds Dreadnaught, Pliny the Elder, Expoential Hoppiness, Pure Hoppiness, Sculpin IPA, Bells HopSlam and the only one I would put on par with Younger is the Pure Hoppiness from Alpine, but this wins out I think just based on the drinkability. I've read several threads about the quality of this beer not being what it used to. Even if thats the case it is certainly deserving of the hype it gets and is without a doubt one of the 1,2 or 3 best IPA's in the world. 2,443 charactersHopHobo, Feb 13, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Nice clear golden pour with two fingers of sticky head. The smell is an absolutely blistering assault on the senses. Sinus cleansing levels of hops. Huge floral and pine notes with an underlying orange peel citrus aroma. This takes the bar set by other west coast IPAs and throws it like a javelin through the heart of restraint.
The taste follows suit. Gigantic hop flavor envelops every crevice of my mouth with pine resin and earthy bitterness. There is no attempt at subtlety, nor do I imagine there should be. This beer is designed to showcase the hop, and it does so as though it would be the beer we gave to alien visitors to help them understand the wonders of our planet. But does it separate itself from the rest of the pack? It is certainly a tough task considering the sheer number of beers just like it that come from the West Coast. I'm not really sure it accomplishes that separation.
The body is full/medium and carbonation is at good levels. I was surprised to find that this washed down very clean, I was expecting a much higher level of stickiness. 
Drinkability is solid for an 11% beer. Overall this is definitely one of the top 10 DIPA's I've had. A hophead's dream, I'm sure. To me, simply a great beer. 1,229 charactersalcstradamus, Feb 13, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Has it really been a year since I sipped this delicious nectar? Yes. Yes it has. 
Far too long.
A season has come and gone. Winter has given way to summer, and again submitted to the chilling winds of the North.
This beer is beautiful. Crisp and golden, with a head that should not be possible for a 11% ABV beer. To gaze at this beer, is to look at beer porn
Smell is very citric, a contrast to the more pine-like Elder.
Taste is OSUHJFOHHJKKkkk. Impossible to put into words -- Heavenly. Strong citrus hops with a malt backbone that is certainly pronounced, but not overwhelming. 
Mouthfeel -- Again, this beer defies its ABV with a crisp mouthfeel that is light on the tongue. Doesn't finish quite as dry as Elder
Drinkability - Finished two imperial pints, and would have had more if there weren't health/safety issues to consider. 842 charactersSandstone, Feb 13, 2010
4.67/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A huge thanks goes out to my buddy Ryan for hooking me up with this. After two years gone by of PtY trades falling through, Ryan stepped up big, not to mention the best packaging job I've ever seen on a growler.
The top of the growler pops with a nice hiss and white smoke. Aroma literally pours out of the growler.
A: This pours a thick, sticky, resiny light copper with a nice one finger head. For the ABV and size of this beer, I was expecting it to be a bit darker, but this was fairly light (similar in color to Sculpin). The head surprisingly lasts a while and has mediocre lacing. Great carbonation streaming slowly from the base of the glass.
S: Unfrigginbelieveable. Imagine your head inside a bucket of fresh orange, pineapple, apricot, and grapefruit and you will successfully simulate the PtY aroma experience. This is the best smelling DIPA (or is it TIPA) that I have ever had. The blast of citrus is unbelievable. As it warms up, some alcohol aroma is apparent, but it is really masked by the citrus hops. No pine or grassy hops detected whatsoever. Also not much caramel or malt backing detected in the smell. Straight up citrus explosion.
T: Tasted cold, this was smooth as hell, with the citrus flavors subdued. It coats your entire mouth with thick, sticky, hop resin goodness. As it warms, the beer gets exponentially better. The alcohol comes out, but seems to enhance the citrus and hop experience. I preferred it better a little warmer. 
M/D: This is a thick and sticky DIPA. I found myself continually going back to the growler though, hoping more would appear. 
Overall, this lived up to the hype. Best DIPA I have had? I would probably say not, but it is damn close. 1,698 characterstreyrab, Feb 13, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a growler into my Duvel tulip thanks to Evan, thanks again brah! I owe you big time!
A - Orange with yellow highlights. Tiny head with big bubbles and a small head as you sip down the brew. 
S - Big time hops with alcohol and malt mixed in. Hard to describe but it's outstanding! Some citrus, lots of pine too. Whatever Vinny did here is working.
T - Hops, hops and more hops. It basically owns your entire palate with an assortment of hops. It's a controlled chaos though, you can find balance in the big malts in the brew. A fantastic array of flavor. I can't really describe it. I guess from what I know it's like Hopslam without the honey. It's more aggressive than Hopslam, ti's not as mellowed out.
M - Low carbonation on the heavier side of medium.
D - High. It's not necessarily perfect but the flavors don't keep your lips far from the glass. As it warms, the alcohol becomes a tad more apparent but it's still masked well.
Overall, I'd say this beer is almost an exercise in perfection. A complete expression of perfection on the higher alcoholic version of a DIPA. Great job, Russian River and thanks again for the taste Evan! 1,155 charactersauroracrisis, Feb 13, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received my growler today from moosington-thanks man, this sure was a great trade. It is being shared with two BA's. I start the evening of excitement with the unveiling of the growler.
Poured into a duvel glass the color is light orange with a golden glow. Head is large bubble bit perfect.
Aroma is hopcentric from sniff one. There is a sweet malt behind the hops but the juicy, fruity hop smells are delicious to the nose.
Flavor is full, robust and again riddled with hops. There is a fairly prominent malt backbone but this monster is not sweet. The alcohol is well hidden but sneaks up quickly. If you're a hophead you'll love this grand double IPA.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Not too thin, not too thick, just perfect. This DIPA is a touch drier than any I've ever had; I think its the water.
Drinkability is off the charts. The alcohol is muted, and the flavor volume is tuned up. What an amazing beer. In fact its my only all 5's beer - and for good reason. I will definately seek this one out again; in fact I may go to the release next year.
Before this hopslam was my favorite DIPA, not anymore. West scores again. 1,127 charactersPerzentRizen, Feb 13, 2010

Yeah, its pretty great. Smells like hops, and weed, and hops, and citrus, and hops.
Everything good about every IPA in one conventient beer. Citrus, pine, sweet, sticky, etc. As incredible as one would think, but still a touch less than AMAZING. Is it worth IT? Probably not. But still wonderful, probably the best ever.

Smell is of massive hops, big pine and citrus noes come through. Pretty much all hops, with a little sweet malt coming through lightly.
Big, bitter, tongue bruising and beautiful. Tons of grapefruit and pine flavors. One of the more bitter DIPAs I have to date. A little bit of caramel malt comes through. Lots of alpha acids and hops, hops, hops.
Full bodied , acidic. Bitterness lingers on the tongue for hours.
Good drinkability for a beer this big. Overall a great DIPA, maybe not worthy of all the hype, but still a terrific beer. 637 characterspmccallum86, Feb 13, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5As a huge fan of The Elder, I waited patiently to find the Younger and was frustrated by near misses and the grim prospect of never actually tasting this beer. Sheer serendipity brought it to my lips; the tapping was unannounced and no sign was displayed. "We're just trying to keep it mellow, so don't make a big deal about it," the bartender advised.
While I heeded that advice, I had a hard time concealing my smile and, probably, erection.
A. A dim gold with minimal head and a faint cloudliness. Lacing is minimal. Tiny champagne bubble on the base of the tulip.
S. Phenomenal nose. Resinous hops, notes of oily pine, some citrus. It just smells active and robust. 
T Although its stratospheric IBU count might suggest otherwise, this is drinkable, surprisingly it seemed more active after a fresh pour while some IPAs I've had need to sit. I liked this served cold. Just alive with IBUs and hops. I kept tasting this circle, like one element of fed into the other. As I breathed through my nose, I just tasted a spiraled spectrum of bitterness noted with dank, oily pine. It didn't so much taste as it performed. I wasn't tasting something, a process was happening in my mouth. Excellent beer.
M. Sparkly from carbonation, but gentle. This would work completely flat, but, again, the carbonation moves the flavor.
D. This didn't taste like 11 percent ABV at all, closer to 7.5-7.9. 
Easily the best TIPA or DIPA or IPA I've ever had. Just a pleasure to drink. Well worth the effort I made to get this at the right time and well worth the wait. 1,549 charactersrichhandsome, Feb 13, 2010

Growler opens with a nice big pop.
Poured into Bruery snifter.
Pours 1 finger of white head. Pretty decent retention. Leaves a lot of lace rings. Color is a clear golden bronze.
Aroma: Sweet floral hops, has some sugar flavors to it, it has a lot of pine notes which is really nice. Big grapefruit citrus with some other blended into it. The aroma is huge hops and a nice sweet malty profile.
Taste: It starts out with a massive amount of pine hops (some floral hop profile). It is sweet, but bitter. The malts are bready, but don't balance it out too much, which is good. The grapefruit citrus is dominate and really brings a lot to this beer. Maybe some orange citrus sticking out a bit. 
Mouthfeel: Bitter, but nothing that overly done which is really nice. It is incredibly smooth. It has a much bigger body than any other ipa. Just massive and tasty. A nice amount of carbonation. Ends very very clean for the style.
Overall, this beer is very fine. Lots of massive flavor and incredibly drinkable. My part of this growler of this is going fast and is incredibly easy to drink. You really can't get a much better beer for this style. This beer deserves to be at the top of its class. Thanks a ton Jer for getting this growler! Everyone loved the beer and was happy to try it. 1,403 charactersmothman, Feb 12, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Paid $6.25 for a 12oz pour into a pint glass at the Englander in San Leandro, CA.
Small white head with minimal retention and excellent lacing. Glowing orange DIPA color.
Nose is an overwhelming hop bouquet. Grapefruit citrus all the way. I thought this was less piney but more hoppy than the Elder which was my favorite beer up until today. 
Taste is unrelentlessly bitter and hoppy. Very pungent of grapefruit and citrus. Puckeringly delicious.
Not quite as creamy and smooth as the Elder, but still quite nice. A long hoppy finish that keeps you wanting more and more. Absolutely no hints of the high ABV which slowly sneaks up on you. So drinkable it is scary. Meduim body and perfectly carbonated.
Easily my new favorite beer. The bar only let you have two 12oz pours, so my third beer was an Elder and it seemed somewhat tame and more malty to me after having the Younger. 883 charactersibbjamin, Feb 12, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap at Toronado SD, into a tulip:
A: Faintly amber gold in color, 1 finger white head, leaving some slight lacing.
S: Assertive hops with whiff of sweet malts. Resembles the Elder, though slightly restrained.
T: Very balanced for a beer its size. Malt and hops linger on the back end together very nicely. Grain and smooth, unaggressive hops.
M: Fantastic blend of carbonation, sweet malt, and bitterness. Goes down very easy.
D: Alcohol hit me a bit hard, but this is easy drinking for a DIPA.
Highly recommended. Like the Elder, but more in balance and more... elegant. 580 charactersnectar14, Feb 12, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received a growler as part of a trade with Ricand. He sent it overnight from California to Indiana so that I could have it as fresh as possible. Gathered with four friends they day it arrived. I've been waiting to try this beer for a LONG time, and was very excited to finally give it a shot. Thanks again, Rick!
Had that wonderful *pop* as we cracked open the Russian River signature growler. Poured into five different vintage "Rose Polytechnic" beer glass (only broken out for special occasions, of course). Pours a dark golden (almost approaching orange) color with a foamy off-white head. Nothing out of the ordinary for such a beer, but a good looking glass nonetheless. As could be expected, there was very little lacing left behind.
I've always said that Hopslam is about as good as it gets as far as smell is concerned. I guess I have to add a qualification from now on and say "unless one is fortunate enough to have a shot at The Younger." A truly divine nose with great big hops. Full of citrus - primarily grapefruit, but sweeter fruits as well. Also a bit of a flowery smell...A wonderful balance of sweetness and hoppiness! 
This is a hop machine! A wonderful blast of citrus grabs you right off the bat before retreating just enough to let the sweet fruit come through. Grapefruit upfront and then milder tropical fruits right after. A thick and slightly oily/resiny, almost creamy, mouthfeel. Very full...we all enjoyed this aspect very much. The bitter finish was very good as well, although not quite on the same level as the rest of flavor. Very, very impressive overall!
I can certainly say that the one glass I had was not nearly enough. Extremely smooth, with no alcohol bite whatsoever. I could have continued drinking this throughout the evening, if only we had more! I'm sure there was a bit lost in the growler transfer, and I look forward to the day that I get to drink straight from the source!

4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been lucky enough to have a good share of this beer over the last week at both the release day and at the DIPA fest and enjoyed it immensely but the social nature of said events didn't permit me to take notes. I'm reviewing tonight from my only growler. From notes 02/10/10.
Bright and clean amber orange in color. The somewhat rough pour from the growler forms a large fortune cookie colored head. Retention is amazing and lacing is second only to The Elder.
Citrus is big on the aroma with a burst of tangerine and pineapple which is anchored down by great oily pine and floral notes. 
First sip adds the typical grapefruit blast of most DIPA's (I'm not a fan of the Triple IPA moniker) to the other citrus characteristics noted on the aroma. In addition to the fruitiness this beer is insanely fresh, green, and oily tasting and reminds me a little of a fresh hop brew. The aftertaste is pungent, dry, bitter and grassy. The finish actually makes me imagine I'm chewing on fresh hop residue. Malts are subtle and slightly bready but really don't seem to be a big part of the show.
Carbonation has held up extremely well on this 5 day old growler which I find heartening since it means that my trading partner will get to taste this beer at its intended quality when he receives it in the next few days. 
This beer drinks at about 6.5% with no clear alcohol flavor or heat. Respect this one though, the ABV will catch up with you (a lesson I've not fully learned and this is my third year having this beer). 
Slightly better than last year's batch, this is hands down the best IPA of this strength I've ever tried and probably the best overall. I hope the next few years see more kegs distributed so more people can try this beer. 1,743 charactersberkey, Feb 11, 2010

S: As expected big doses of floral/pine/citrus hops, w/some sweet maltiness as well.
A: Deep orange, thick white head.
T: Similar to elder, but beefed up 4% and a ton more hop flavor. Citrus, pine, floral big american hop flavors. Big bitter dry finish.
M/D: Fairly thick and full mouthfeel as to be expected of a big beer. Still not noticeably boozy or sweet. Just the pure bitterness hurts drinkability a bit.
Overall: Definitely one of the great DIPA's of the world, but IMO possibly not the best. I've heard that previous years batches were better and I might believe it. 587 charactersbret27, Feb 11, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big ups to eliottJW and juhl31 for scoring me a growler, even when I couldn't make it up to the brewpub. A true friend indeed. Shared with many other friends and poured into a New Belgium tulip.
The color is lovely. Definitely a darker brown hue than Elder. This amber gloriousness was topped with a decent crown of white, clean bubbleage which was appreciated because I was concerned about the lack of CO2 in the hurried fill. the head quickly dissipated and there was minimal lacing as the brew disappeared.
Good God, this is the best smelling beer I have ever gotten my hands on. The hops blast me with that resiny citrus goodness that only a west coast IPA drinker can understand. The citrus is mind blowing with that grapefruit coming quickly to the fore. I have no sense of any malt to this beer, but frankly, I don't care.
Decent mouthfeel. Perhaps some oxidation has led to a letdown on carb bite making for a mildly flat beer. As the beer warms, however, I enjoy the complexities of its flavor with the mouthfeel taking a backseat to the onslaught of flavors.
What a hoppy beast! I allow the brew to warm and the initial the citrus blasts of lemon and grapefruit yield to a nice sweet undertone. So bitter it is balanced, so hoppy it is sweet, PTY is a glorious meddle of contradictions. 
Considering its ABV and IBU, Younger is an exceedingly easy beer to drink. The potent hop oils have staying power and can become nearly overwhelming in any sort of a session situation. This beer, however, probably isn't the best choice for a session, and the hop oils mean you get to taste the brew for hours after you drink it. All in all, a pleasant and friendly monster beer that makes me happy that I live in Sonoma County. 1,730 characterscptierney, Feb 10, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this in a trade with barleywinefiend. You da man Josh!
Poured into a New Belgium globe.
Appearance: Flip-top growler opened with a very nice pop! Pour yielded a short, white, soapy cap. Nice retention. Great lacing! Body is crystal clear and deep gold. Very light carbonation can be seen within.
Smell: Grapefruit, cannabis-like floral hops, tangerine, toasted grains, pine resin, and a touch of sea salt. There are so many hoppy components in here! I'm also getting some honey, melon, candied orange, and pollen. Amazingly complex. If there was just a bit more pungency to it, I'd give it a five. EDIT: I'm giving it a five. Neglect what I previously said about pungency. This might be the best smelling imperial IPA I've ever come across!
Taste: Pine resin, sea salt, hop flowers, grapefruit, honey, toasted malt, lemon zest, and loads and loads of hop bitterness! Yet, this beer is almost too bitter. If I don't take a long enough break between sips, I miss out on a lot of the more delicate flavors. Still, who the hell would knock an imperial IPA for being "too bitter." Not me. This beer is beautiful!
Mouthfeel: As with PtE, the body on this imperial IPA is much lighter than others. Carbonation is mild, but suits the oily/resinous feel of this beer perfectly. Clean, pure, hoppiness. Each sip numbs the entire mouth - throat, cheek, tongue, and all. Not too dry either. Very nicely done!
Drinkability: What can I say? Perfect! Imagine PtE with more flavor and more bitterness. I've got nothing left to say... 1,527 charactersThreeWiseMen, Feb 10, 2010
4.65/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks to Jerz and VacaX for making the trek from Long Beach to Russian River, and fighting through the mob to bring this back to So Cal. They're champs for their efforts, and I don't know how I'll begin to repay them.
A - Poured from a growler into my Delerium Tremens snifter glass. Has a light copper color, with just under a finger width of head. The head actually died pretty quickly. I was surprised at this from other reviews I had read. There was some lacing left on the glass.
S - It's definitely hop forward. There are some orange scents and other tropical fruits mixed in. There's a nice sweetness on the back end too. I think Sculpin might be slightly more potent, though the two are very similar.
T - First off, the alcohol is very well hidden. Now, there are grapefruits, and other tropical fruits, mixed in with a very sweet aftertaste. But then, pine comes back and there's a lingering pine note as the sweetness dies down. After the beer sits for a bit and warms, or opens up, the alcohol comes out...though just a tad. Still amazingly well hidden for 11%.
M - Crisp and tasty. There's a medium body, with a slightly creamy texture. i thought the carbonation was slightly lacking, though I'm chalking up that to it being stored and transported in a growler.
D - Wow, this is deceptively strong. It's good...very good. I wish I had more. I'd drink more. Why, Russian River, do you brew this only once a year!!??
I think some value, or potency, or whatever you want to call it, was slightly lost in the beer due to it being in a growler, but it's still pretty phenomenal. 1,599 charactersKaiser81, Feb 10, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5By the time we got to the bar to ask for growlers. They told us it was gonna be a while but here's a couple glasses to enjoy while you wait.
Appearance is dark copper with a nice head that recedes....but with the huge volume of people there I don't think they were worrying about perfect pours.
The smell was off the charts...this beer stinks of deliciousness.... You get your piney/citrusy hops, caramel for a second, more malty goodness, alcohol... a smack in the face vision.... 
When it enters your mouth you know you're on to some good stuff. The hops and malt blend together in a perfect cacophony of deliciousness. Up front hitting hard with the pine and citrus and then blending together with the malt and a bit of alcohol warmth. 
Had the correct amount of carbonation, a nice resiny feel to it as it lingers for a good while, sticky, verrah niiice.
The beer is beyond drinkable, but at some point you'll pass out. So that should be considered your limit ha ha. 975 charactersSixofsigmas, Feb 10, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My 300th review
A: Gldish amber hue with a nice fluffy white head that is surprisingly large at slightly over an inch for being poured. It is perfectly clear with a light carbonation that rises from the bottom of the glass. The beer is golden when held in the light. Lacing is outstanding and the head lingers long enough before it starts to fade.
S: Juicy Hops all over, but that is the point. Sticky pine notes that provide a powerful bitterness that is nicely complimented by resinous citrus hop notes that bring a whirlwind of fruit notes including oranges, mango, apricot, peaches, pineapple. Underneath all of that is a slight hint of caramel sweetness that is very inviting itself
T: The moment of truth...wow, just wow. It starts off with the fruit notes mentioned at first, providing an intensely near tropical fruit punch experience that then turns into oily resinous piny bitterness that while also instense is not overwhelming. There is also a touch of sweet caramel and biscuitiness
M: Very smooth and creamy at first while still being light and full of body. Yeah a bit of an oxymoron, but oh well. Also a nice gooey pininess lingers on my tongue and begs me to drink more.
D:Very easy to drink, but that is not unusual for IPAs and me. There is only the slightest bit of alcohol heat and i know i can drink plenty of this as it is very easy to put back. Needless to say the growler will have to go tonight, but i am optimistically up to the task
In short this is one of the best IPAs i have ever had 1,520 charactersmikey711, Feb 09, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I acquired a growler of the infamous Younger from vacax (thanks mate)! Served it in a Bruery tulip glass. I poured 3 glasses of RR brews and compared them. Blind Pig, Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger.
A - A beautiful orange/copper tone with minimal head but amazing lacing that lasted the whole glass. A darker orange color than that of it's uncle.
S - Chocked full of piney aroma! Compared with the Elder it was far more hop aroma, grapefruit, citrus and pine just fills your nose! Absolutely beautiful smell!
T - Grapefruit, pine and citrus; just as the scent would allude to! Bitter! But, not over the top (believe it or not). It was a well balanced bitterness, no funny facial expressions after taking a sip of this beer. Insanely flavorful and potent! Some beers you'll need a few sips to get the flavor, this one is not that! If you're offered a sip of the Younger, take it and you'll know how it tastes! No new flavors come through near the end!
M - Medium bodied, nice carbonation that creates a little dance party on your tongue. The finish sticks around too, which I really enjoy in good beers. It's a shame when they go away quickly, the Younger does not do this!
D - 2 friends came over and we had the growler gone in less than an hour! 11% so be careful! This is no harder to drink than Blind Pig or Pliny the Elder! Amazing for such a big beer!
I would say I was blessed to have been able to finally get this beer. I would love to get some every year! For anybody that's wondering if they should try to pile into a small bar to try get this on tap, I would say DO IT! 1,592 charactersantioch, Feb 09, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Multiple draught and growler samples over the past weekend. First sip last friday at the release day which was supposed to be the start of a release week, though things didn't exactly work out that way. Walking into the Russian River brewpub, the aroma hits you at once. Yes, you heard correctly; I just rated the aroma by entering the room. Elder is probably my favorite DIPA, so a side-by-side was necessary to really get a feel for its larger nephew. The color is a deep gold, going a touch darker than Elder. The head is small, with some sticky white foam lingering in a slick. Oddly enough, at first, Elder has a much more expressive aroma, leaning on more pine and pungent dankness. I do a double take on Younger: there is a touch of alcohol and orange showing but it seems pretty closed. Temperature is definitely key with this beer. Many larger DIPAs (or TIPAs in this case) seem to benefit from a cooler serving temperature that lets the hops keep the upper hand over the malt sweetness. Younger breaks that mold because it is about as dry as you can get and still maintain balance in a beer this big. I have heard that it has been sweeter in past years, but can't say firsthand how this years release compares. All that I can say is that the sweetness never becomes at all bothersome. Sure, it is evident when compared right next to Elder, which elegantly shows how dry the style can be, but it works perfectly with the massive hop load. Let the temperature come up a few degrees, and the hops become incredibly juicy and expressive, showing all kinds of orange, mango, and grapefruit. There is a similar resiny dank touch as you get in elder, but it is overall rounder, fruitier, and juicier, probably helped in part be the additional perception of sweetness. The flavor is just crazy hoppy without being at all abrasive. This is one amazingly smooth beer, with just a hint of alcohol in the finish to remind you that it is nearly eleven percent full of it. Bitterness is almost mild to start, only building to full strength toward the back of the tongue. Mildly malty and sweet, but it's pretty damn had to pick out much definable malt character over all the hops. Medium-full body with smooth carbonation. Just about the perfect consistency for a beer like this, with the hop oils contributing as much mouthfeel as anything else. Younger has a surprising amount of subtlety and balance for a beer this big and hoppy. It definitely has more nuance than most big DIPAs, and may even be a touch understated. In the end, it works perfectly just like Elder works perfectly, just from a different approach. 2,613 charactersbulletrain76, Feb 09, 2010

4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm scoring this from when I had it on tap at the 2010 friday release at Russian River. I am going to pick out the aroma/flavors from a growler pour at home during this review, but I wanted to give it the on-tap score because the mouthfeel is better on-tap.
Body color is an enticing light orange, with some hues of dark yellow. Clarity is really good. Bright white 2-finger head with spiderweb lacing. The head is quite creamy looking. Retention is good, but it does mellow quicker than Elder down into a thin ring that stays until the bottom of the glass. 
Initial smell is all pine, that's really the chief characteristic, and it's beautiful. Underneath the absurd amounts of pine there's some grapefruit pith and an underlying sweet caramel aroma. I smell no alcohol despite the fact that this is a fresh 11%er.
First sip tastes of the caramel I got in the nose, but quickly transforms, first into lemon, then grapefruit, then pine needles as the bitterness starts to creep up. Finishes up with a little bit of a spicy peppery kick with some faint alcohol in the background. I can't envision any hoppy beer ever surpassing this in the taste department.
Big chewy mouthfeel, while remaining oily and extremely smooth. The creamy head will bathe your upper lip and give you a hop mustache :) Somehow despite being pretty thick, it has a lot of small bubbles that remain active. This is the big difference of having it on tap. I still achieved a good amount of head from my growler, but the body of the beer did not retain the small bubbles that kept the beer popping in my mouth. The growler pour is more like a 4.0 in mouthfeel because of this.
Drinks EXTREMELY well. I should qualify that statement by saying that being a hophead is required though. Frankly, my lupulin threshold has shifted to such a point where I don't get any real bitterness here and I just taste all the delicious hop qualities instead. It's so damn smooth. There is absolutely no alcohol bite at all, and I don't get how that's possible. I could go on and on about this beer for days, but I'll stop so you can continue onto the next review.
A heart-felt thank you goes out to Vinnie and Natalie for all their hard work over the years to make beers like this a reality. 2,251 charactersBubba83, Feb 08, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Long time BA, but a first time reviewer. I think I've chosen a fairly worthy beer for my first review.
I was able to get my hands on a 10 oz. at the brewpub on 2/5/10 and I also picked up a growler of the Younger while I was there. This review is of the growler.
A - It's a beaut. Dark for an IPA but a little lighter than a red. It's just asking you to drink it.
S - I don't have the best sense of smell but this one's a winner. Hoppy to the extent that it smells almost like weed. Honestly a perfect smell. It retains a smell of an intense yet perfectly balanced hop profile that wants to be challenged.
T - Again a winner. Somehow the taste catches you off guard with its quality despite your fair warning with the smell. If I were to guess without prior knowledge, I'd say the beer was a 7.5% as it hides the 11% quite well.
M - If you don't like IPAs or hops in general, avoid this sucker. If you've been bitten by the hop fever this one's a must. I've been a longtime fan of the Ruination but this one begs of a more strong adjective as it left my tongue completely numb.
D - On top of the totally intense profile this beer pushes, I could drink it all night if I had the chance (I've only got 1 growler so I'm forced to ration it as much as possible). If this beer was given the distribution of Pliny the Elder (my previous favorite beer) I'd need some convincing to buy anything else on the shelves. Despite its "gobs" of IBUS and 11%+ ABV, I'd drink this beer all night every night I could.
Simply put, this is the best beer I've ever tasted. The mini imperial pint glass at the brewpup served it well but I've found my snifter to accentuate its characteristics to their maximum potentials. My advice: line up before 11am when it's released next year; this one's not worth missing. 1,797 charactersshortysdude285, Feb 08, 2010

A - pours a beutiful rich pale orange. White sticky head stands out at the top. The beer head grasps the rim of the pint glass tightly. Amazing
s - wow, first wiff, smells like a fresh rain forest. Further smell brings out slight grapefruit bitterness. Every sniff is a new adventure. 
T - this beer tastes so pleasing. The taste grabs your taste buds and screams bitter. Even the burps afterwards remind you of the taste. The hoppiness in this beer is awesome. It's a bitter sweet. Feels like biting into a grapfruit, you get the bitterness of the peel, and then the sweetness of the fruit kicks in to finish. Perfect triple ipa taste going on here.
M - only been in the growler for 2 days. Carbonation is there. The beer is bubbly, it's silky, it's smooth. It's everything you can ask for in a perfect beer. I can't complain about this mouthfeel. 
D - wow, at 11%abv, this beer is dangerous. It is the highest abv beer that us unnoticable to me. The hops and malt create the perfect bitterness and sweetness to mask the abv perfectly. This beer also has such a good balance that it is hard to put down. It is very easy to drink an entire growler solo. Wish I could. So damn drinkable.
O - this beer is the top of it's style for a reason. It's got the whole package. If you enjoy ipas, this beer is a step beyond in the right direction. Highly recomended. 1,410 charactersabecall98, Feb 08, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Believe the hype... that's all that really needs to be said about this beer. perfection. 
pours a deep golden almost amber color that is truly something special to behold. a small off white head rests atop the body of liquid awesomeness, lacing the glass minimally, and leaving only the slightest trace of itself. The smell is super piny, citrusy, hops all over, with a hint of cannibus. the quintessential aroma for an ipa.
The flavor is so overwhelmingly amazing it's hard to put words to. citrusy and piney, tons of hops. earthy and bitter as all hell. a little honey flavor. bitter grapefruit and alcohol in the finish. amazing. a palate destroyer for sure. 
The mouthfeel is oily with hop resin and nice and thick on the palate. wonderfully, perfectly carbonated. The drinkability for an 11% beer is equal to the most drinkable single ipa available. incredible. 869 charactersjdklks, Feb 07, 2010

Completely destroyed my taste buds. Sticky and chewy in the mouth. Today (2 days after release) I just opened a growler and it is just as awesome. It is IPA perfection. Floral hop scent, good head, a little cloudy. The hops resonate in my mouth and the bitterness removes all saliva. If you are a hophead this is the pinnacle of beer. 461 charactersShane94941, Feb 07, 2010
4.67/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the brewpub on release day, less than 20 minutes after opening. Poured into a generic 10oz nonic. Consumed on a sunny day out on the patio.
Hazy tangerine body with amber highlights. A spider-web of ivory bubbles drifts across the surface, creating a thin collar over which gossamer arcs of lacing hover for a languid moment before sliding back down into the glass. 
The aromatics underscore the freshness of this beer above all else, almost like freshly chilled wort. The orange-rind and evergreen notes are there from the hops, but joined as well by marshmallow and very fresh malt. 
Orange blossom, honey, and apricot coat the palate, followed by a spicy citrus-blast, cushioned by a wave of almost syrupy sweetness. Glorious bitterness with green peppercorn, hemp, and grapefruit seeds into the finish. The alcohol lingers like a hoppy single malt - the pine notes coming across almost like menthol.
Smooth, resinous, almost creamy, medium-bodied with some added heft from the ABV - though I wouldn't describe this as hot by any stretch of the imagination. 
Among the best examples of the style, edging out the Elder just a bit for king of the NorCal versions.
Hours later, after I had shipped off my growlers, as I was walking down the street in a completely different part of Santa Rosa, I found myself smelling hops. I soon realized the smell was coming from my hands (when I wiped my mouth after the last sip from the glass) even as they were wedged in my pockets! 1,488 charactersaugustgarage, Feb 07, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I truly believe that not enough good things can be said about this beer. I had it on-tap at the release day. I also split a growler of it with friends the day after the release. Very fortunate to write this review. 
The appearance is a light honey colored nectar that pours with a one and a half finger head. The head is white and sticky, but leaves after a while due to the ABV. The brew itself is as thick as honey, the carbonation bubbles struggle to make their way to the top of the brew. Leaves a thick alcoholic leg all around the glass. Also leaves a medium lacing on the sides. A beautiful beer with the greatest color and gravity, this thing is thick!
The smell is the best hop smell I have ever experienced. It reminds me of rubbing wet hops together in my hands at my local homebrew store. It has a hop bitterness with underlying citrus notes that bring two big characteristics together. No ABV is present anywhere in this beer, and it makes it dangerous. There is a marijuana smell that a lot of my beer tasting friends picked up, so this beer brings together my favorite smells in an IPA and intensifies them by ten. 
The taste is of extremely bitter hops with a very strong malt backbone. It is balanced so well that the hops just explode with different flavors. What I love about Russian Rivers IPA's is that they have more of a pine characteristic than overly sweet. This pairs pine hops with sweet undertones in the taste. I had a growler at a bar last night and gave samples to about four different people, some that do not always drink craft beer. Everyone knew without the background of Younger that this was a very special beer. 
The mouthfeel is a palate destroyer! The oils in this beer coat your entire mouth with hop bitterness, creating the best mouthfeel for a hop focused beer. Nothing tastes the same after this, for your palate is in fatigue after just a few sips. 
The drinkability is dangerously high, I would of given this a six out of five if possible. Once you start, you cannot stop at all. I had about eight pours of this on the actual release, needless to say I got out of bed the next day at around noon. There is no surprise here that the taps ran out on the same day. Once you get to taste it, you just don't want to stop. 
This was a true pleasure to try for I will never forget this weekend. A truly exceptional beer thats hype is well deserved. Cheers to Vinnie and Natalie at Russian River

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this on-tap yesterday and am having it from a growler now. If this beer were available year-round, I'd drink nothing but. 
a: This beer pours a slightly hazy somewhat dark gold. In an effort to get glasses out faster, Natalie Cilurzo was filling pitchers with younger and pouring glasses out of that. The head size tended to vary depending on how quickly she was going. At home, pouring slowly, this develops a one-finger head that dissipates before too long, but still leaves a nice lacing.
s: Hops. Hops. More hops. I'm also doing a side-by-side comparison of this and Elder. For all that they have similar piney-grapefruity hop profiles, the difference in intensity is staggering.
t: I'm almost at a loss for words. On the one hand this is every bit as intensely bitter and hoppy as its older cousin. On the other hand, there's this sweetness as well. It doesn't taste malty, though. It's almost like the sweetness is a facet of the heavy citrusy oomph. And despite being 10.75% ABV according to the RR chalkboard, there's not a hint of alcohol that can be tasted.
m: At the pub, it poured out of the tap so slow it looked like maple syrup. I was almost expecting something very heavy, but what I got was a medium-bodied sipper with just the right amount of carbonation.
d: More. More. More. The insidiousness of PtY is not that it's a great beer. The insidiousness is that it is so bloody drinkable that every empty glass is a major disappointment. An empty growler is cause for tears. When you start drinking this beer, you don't ever want to stop.
I have one growler left. On the one hand I'm having to fight off the temptation to open it now, because once I do, that's all I'll have left for an entire year. On the other hand...so good... 1,755 charactersexcal, Feb 07, 2010

A: The pour is a slightly hazed golden, amber color with a finger's worth of white foam that sticks around forever and leaves some nice lacing.
S: I think it's pretty obvious how this one smells. The hops are amazingly intense with aromas of bitter grapefruit and pine. The malt is there in a sense, but it's more mixed in with the incredibly bitter nose.
T: The flavor is pure resinous, bitter, pine with plenty of bitter grapefruit. The alcohol is not at all present (despite the beer being 11%). The bitterness starts before the beer even hits your lips and lasts all the way until the next sip.
M: The body is full with a moderate level of carbonation. The bitterness lingers on the palate but it really just makes you want some more.
D: This is an absolutely amazing beer. Despite its strength and intense bitterness, you just want to have more and more. I had at least 30 to 40 ounces of this and could have had plenty more. 1,073 characterswomencantsail, Feb 07, 2010

A: Crystal clear golden color. Lighter in color than one would expect for such a high alcohol beer. One finger head. Good lacing.
S: Hugely hoppy aroma. (I could smell it when I walked into RR) Sweet malts, dank, resin, tropical fruits, pine.
T: Sweet malts. Mango, pine, resin, daaaank, bitterness. Killing it.

The smell is a sweet, yet floral hop kick. The pine and grapefruit are very strong.
While I expected the hoppy pine and grapefruit taste to follow the aroma, I was surprised at how sweet it was on the tongue. Don't get me wrong --- it's a palate killer. In both instances, I tried other brews following PtY and it was a waste.
It has a heavier mouthfeel than I expected it would. It was kind of syrupy, but in a very good way. It was smooooth.
Because I didn't notice any alcohol burn, I drank a couple of these right off. It came back to bite me. 798 charactersBuckeyeOne, Jan 20, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review transcribed from a RB review from Feb. '09. I have actually only had this beer once, and I was fairly drunk at the time. Mark my words, I will practically live at Russian River Brewing when this is released in '10. So did it live up to the hype? In a word, yes. This is a sweet hoppy nectar of the gods. It really just doesn't get much better than this. Had it on tap at Toronado in SF.
A - Deep golden amber color with a nice white head that lasts. 
S - Really piney and floral hoppy aroma with sweet caramel malt. This kicks even the Elder's ass as far as aroma goes. It's just incredibly intense and incredibly awesome. Few beers compare.
T - Flavor is a piney hop explosion with some floral and citrus notes as well. Complex and awesome hop profile. Huge backbone of sweet malt (caramel, pale) and honey balances perfectly.
M - Syrupy mouthfeel with alcohol warmth despite very little alcohol flavor. Nice smooth carbonation.
D - Way too drinkable. I could drink this all night and end up on the floor, no question.
See you in 2010, PtY. Miss you. 1,064 charactersnickd717, Sep 04, 2009
4.61/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Okay,so this is one of those great hype beers, the father of all IIPAs, etc., etc.
I've had it at OBF and some other tastings here and there, but a trip down to Sonoma gave me the perfect chance to actually review it, the whole pint of it (well half pint). Reviewing a sampler just isn't my style. A faintly hazy amber tangerine. The head was super sticky, with the lacing affixing itself all over the sides of the glass. 
Blast of hops in the aroma. Sticky, syrupy and oily. The malt ismingled with the hops, providing sweetness to the hops but not adding any distinctivly malty flavors. The alcohol does the same. It doesn't contrast to the hops, it adds to the illusion of spiciness 'in' the hops. Interesting. If this beer got into any orfice other than my mouth, it would burn. 
The taste is surprisingly balanced. Ooh, look, here's the malt! This isn't a tooth disintegrating, cheek numbing, hop bomb of an iipa like some out there. It's got actual balance. Sure the hops are stong enough to blast your palate and drown out any milder beers for the rest of the night, but this ain't Ruination. It's balanced. Pine tips, grapefruit, and other great hop characteristics abound. This is a great brew, and a great recipe. Let this not be a benchmark for IIPA's, otherwise too many other beers would suck. Instead let this be a plateau that other iipas continue to climb towards. There's plenty of room up here on the top for more good iipas! 1,446 charactersSurlyDuff, Aug 31, 2009

Flavor was very fresh with the with sticky pine and floral hops dominating and citrus fruits coming up in a close second. Slightly sweeter than expected, but it still has a nice dry bitter finish. This was very nice. 321 characterspepsican, Jul 17, 2009

They had an IPA fest going alll week with rumors of a PTY keg that they would crack sometime during the week, so i went a couple times out of the week then last minute i went again and BEHOLD! it was finally on tap! i grabbed two glasses of it and enjoyed the SHIT out of them.
A-beautiful beautiful color, rich lathery head with sticky lacing, the head is off white, body was amber golden with tiny ropes of carbonation rippling through it.
S- pure hops! this is one of the most intriguing beers ive ever had. now i understand what all the hype is about. I wasnt sure I would like this beer so much seeing as though PTE is an "OK" beer in my book. There is a great amount of malt complexity to it as well. This beer was teeming with all sorts of complexities. 
T- A rush of pine, candi sugar, a bit of molasses, and finishes simi sweet with a crushing spice at the end that lingers forever!
M- Thick, chewy, and has given me my hop fix for the next six months.
D- I could drink this all day all night and into my retirement years. Such a shame its so rare. Good job RR! 1,119 charactersslayer3604, Jun 20, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this at the Local 44 in West Philly during Philly Beer Week. Awesome lineup of RR brews on tap! Review from notes (3/15/09).
A - poured a clear honey amber with a quick white head. Slight lace in the Chimay goblet. Didn't expect much head for a huge beer as such.
S - Very well balanced and pronounced nose. Caramel malts and citrusy hops of the grapefruit variety. A touch of biscuits. Good golly!
T - Extremely balanced. Malty sweet backbone complements grapefruity hops nicely. Impeccably smooth. Very little, if any, alcoholic tones.
M - So incredibly smooth! The carbonation was just enough to keep it crisp and hold the flavors together. 
D - Three letters: OMG
Overall - for $5.50/goblet, I would drink this all day. Pliny the Younger is indeed an excellent DIPA. Maybe it doesn't live up to the extreme hype for me but it certainly surpassed my expectation for a delicious, smooth DIPA. Especially when drinking this at 11:20am on Sunday... 958 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 02, 2009
4.83/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had to fly all the way across the country to try this beer and just stumbled into a bar that happened to have it on tap. Lucky me.
The beer was in a tall snifter glass. It was a nice medium copper color with a thin whispy white head.
The beer had an excellent hop aroma. Not the kind that hits you hard and screams hops, but a much more subtle refined smell where you could tell the beer was going to be hoppy.
The taste is just fantastic. I imagined it being an Elder with just more hops but that really wasn't the case. It has an excellent hoppy flavor balanced well by a nice malt background. The hops are well balanced, nice and floral like the Elder but also and extra bit of resin and bitterness at the end that the Elder is lacking. A very strong hop flavor that in no way is overwhelming or over powering like many double or triple IPA's. 
The mouthfeel remains on the lighter side, like the Elder, but with a good thickness from the hops. It never left a negative bitterness in my mouth or a negative thickness like some extra hoppy beers do.
A lot like the Elder the alchol is hidden in this one and the flavors are refined enough that I could drink about 6 of these before I knew what was going on. A great great beer and I feel so lucky to have found it. 1,273 characterstjsprague, May 28, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Oh YEA!! This was all it was purported to be. Had it on tap at Russian River last week. Poured (in a 10 oz. glass) to a bright orange-red color with good head and lacing. Strong nose of hoppy citrusy grapefruit hit me as the waitress approached. As I nursed it along, the 11% abv also became much more noticeable. Mouthfeel was very full and slightly tingly, and the taste was a very dominant bitter grapefruit blended perfectly with alcohol and a touch of malt to round things out. I sipped toward the finish, which was long, very smooth and warming.
A GREAT beer. 566 characterskimcgolf, May 26, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Poured into a snifter at the Bottleworks Grand Re-Opening. They had a great selection but my mind was already set before I walked in. Golden orange with burnt lemon and butterscotch hues. Infusion of well balanced hazy copper rich tones. While lighter in complexion than my expectations it is a fantastic looking beer. Perfect pearl white head that fluffed up like thousands of minuscule marshmallows. Retention was strong. Sticky crystallized lacing all down the glass. 
S: Coats the air with honey seared grapefruits and flowery resined hops. I pushed my nose close to the glass to inhale the orchestra of melting spruce and fresh pine needles. Hints of lemon soaked tangerines. Smells like they corked a pine tree and drained out all of the sap while blowing it full of toffee smoke. Citrus, berries, and perfection.
T: This one hits the mouth like an ax blade glazed in hops. Much like the aroma everything about the taste is clean, fresh, and crisp. Significantly rich with assaulting hops. Pineapple juice tang and orange rind pierce that are cut with just the slightest vanilla and banana roundness. Subtle spiciness emerges from the cacophony of hop madness. This is over 10% and while there is no alcohol in the taste you get a nice flush feeling about 6oz in (especially at 1130AM, after the gym, and on an empty stomach). Every taste is better than the previous. Not just first class for the style but first class for beer in general.
M: Perfectly dry and smooth with a medium mouth feel. My tongue was still tingling 45 minutes later.
D: The best IIPA I have tried. Thus, I am giving this five's across the board. A possible uniter of humanity? RR may be onto something. It's a sipper but after the first sip it's hard not to keep going. They should just call it a triple imperial IPA. I am by no means an expert on beer but this lived up to my anticipation. Thanks to RR for creating this and Bottleworks for providing it. 1,942 characterserikm25, May 16, 2009

PTY:  2/16/12 ( I think it's been released for ~12 days)
A:  pale yellow amber and quite clear,  just a tiny bit of haze (i think id actually like to see more).  A thin stark white foam tops it off clinging to the glass fairly well along the way.

S: fallen pine needle and citrus peel are ever present.  Tangerine juice and grapefruit pith.  There is a hint of iced doughnut for me as well.
4.5
T:  huge and sticky this shows a sweet candied orange sweetness and Soft zesty bitterness.  along with the citrus pith suggestions, this carries a "green" quality usually reserved for green flash descriptions.  Some forest floor carries out in the mid palate.  Some astringent alcohol in the finish with a sense of its strength but in a dry sort of way (think old raj).  
4
M:  bright prickly and sticky all at once.  Medium finish.  Lengthily drying out the palate.
4.5
O:  not unlike biting into a honey tangerine through the skin.  But don't sweat what ya heard kid.  This is great stuff, if they brewed it all the time I think I would still be popular.  Not something worth waiting in a long line for however.  That said this beer is somewhat unique in its balance of flavors.  It doesn't register too sweet (120 min, brass knuckle, ect...) nor does it fall into a bitter hop head bomb ala Dreadnaught.  No, this one is balanced, well except for that pesky alcohol on the finish.
4.5
WOW I finally got to try it! WOOOHOOOO! man this beer is EVERYTHING everyone makes it out to be. or is it? 
 to try it at an IPA fest at NAJA's place in Redondo Beach (If you live in LA and haven't been I recommend trying Najas out). 
Pours a dark amber color and has sticky head retention.
Smells like what one would expect of a big IPA, Lots of citrus and piney notes. Grapefruit aromas lead the way.
There is a hop and flavor explosion once this stuff is on your tongue. Wow I kept going back for more despite the high ABV. This is just an amazing beer tons of balance and complexity, yet it leaves a high note of bitterness to sooth the hophead in me. If you see this beer ever, buy all of them! Of course this will never be bottled so good luck. 2,186 charactersflannelman808, May 13, 2009

64oz russian river swingtop. sampled may 5/09.
pours crystal clear deep orangey amber. a big fluffy cream coloured head forms, dropping very slowly and leaving spotty lace behind.
aroma is intense. wow, there's some hops in there! huge multi-dimensional hop blast. pine, grapefruit flesh and peel, orange flesh and peel, tangerine. alcohol. crackers and white bread. you can almost feel the IBUs before you even take a sip. goddamn this smells good.
taste is awesome. again, wow. intense multi-dimensional hop attack. mostly orange and tangerine up front, then the bite of the grapefruit and pine kicks in. and keeps kicking. fruit and peel. bit of sweetness in the fruit, and bitterness in the peel. earthy and floral too. i can tell there's some alcohol in there, but it's lost behind the bludgeoning hop attack. yet, as much as the hops are kicking your ass, there's a ton of malt in there too. slightly toasted whole wheat bread. white bread. cracker. touch of biscuit and grain. light almost nutty character too, just a hint hiding in the background. there's as much depth and complexity to the malt as there is to the hops. hints of caramel, but most of the sweetness comes from the big juicy citrus hops. medium-high bitterness level. actually, the first sip was probably higher, but i feel like i've quickly become numbed to some of its effects.
mouthfeel is great. medium-large body. very fine medium carbonation. it feels a little full-bodied for the style, but since we're playing at or beyond the upper end of the style guidelines, that's probably a good thing. screw a randall, this thing doesn't need fancy bells and whistles to peel the enamel from your teeth.
drinkability is surprisingly good. i feel like i'm being slowed down by the body more than by the alcohol or the bitterness. actually, i'm mostly just constantly stopping to explore the new directions i see in it. 1,954 charactersgrub, May 06, 2009

Pours a crystal clear light amber/orange, nice and bright, very thick white head forms, slowly settles down to a very thick ring around the glass and thin layer, big chunks of lace stick to the glass. Smell is insanely hoppy, very complex, tons of tropical fruit, pine, grapefruit, oranges, very perfumy, alcohol, apricot and light fruits, caramel, some biscuity malt, lightly sugary, tons of citrus in this one, mango, all over the place, amazing stuff. Taste is amazing as well, tons of orange peel, almost acidic how much hoppiness there is, pine and grapefruit, caramel sweetness through the middle, big alcohol but not overdone, slight graininess near the finish, almost a jasmine sort of character in the finish, very bitter but also is sort of balanced, very complex. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, pretty thick for a DIPA, with medium carbonation. Crazy hoppy but still balanced with the malt. Wow is this a good DIPA, insanely hoppy but just the right amount of malt to balance it out. Well done, big thanks to Michael for this one! 1,169 charactersViggo, May 06, 2009

I've somehow missed this every year in California even though I'm usually there every time it comes out- sadly I'm usually working too hard then to seek it out or go up to Santa Rosa. I love the Elder, and this beer is every bit as good as I'd hoped. Pours golden with okay head and some excellent lacing. Very nice for a growler. A beautiful blast of pine on the nose with some lovely sweet caramel malt providing a nicely layered backbone underneath. For me, the taste is perfect. Sweet malt and a heavy dose of extremely fresh tasting piney hops that have just oozed their oils into this brew. Some nice citrus on the finish as well that combines with the sweet malt for a nice slightly candied finish to the herbal explosion that came beforehand. Deep flavors that roll on and on. Exquisite. The mouthfeel is at first prickly with hops and then smooth with creamy malt. Looong finish. Utterly delicious. I could drink this all day and pay for it later. Not as dry as the Elder of course, but even more deeply flavored. A masterpiece from my favorite brewery. 1,137 charactersGeorgiabeer, May 04, 2009
4.65/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was finally able to try the mighty Pliny the Younger on tap during the Drafting Room's Hop Fest V. I originally thought they were going to tap Pliny the Elder, but they tapped Pliny the Younger instead. What a pleasant surprise!
Appearance: You'd think a beer that's super hopped up would be hazy or murky as hell with a ton of hop particles floating around, but it wasn't at all. It instead poured a semi clear golden amber orange with a few traces of pale lemon yellow highlights along the sides. Sitting on top of this beer was a good sized fluffy head of white foam. This cotton colored head of foam had good retention that left behind a string of rings and a few blots of lace around the glass. I still can't get over the fact how clear this hoppy beer was!
Smell: The strong scent of hops was just pouring off of this beer. It was so strong that you could easily smell the rich scent of hops a couple of feet away. There wasn't just one variety of hop taking up all the room in the aroma, it was a whole plethora of hops in here. I smelled piney hops, citrus hops, grapefruit hops...ah hell just name a variety of hop and it's more than likely in here. Cowering behind the thick wall of hops was the aroma of bitter and tart grapefruit, lemon grass, as well as a few exotic fruits. My nose couldn't find any malts in here, but to be honest, it didn't need them. The strong scent of hops is more than enough to satisfy anybody's sense of smell.
Taste: For a beer that's jam packed with hops, it was actually well balanced. The hops balanced themselves out without the aid of malts of fruits. The first of many hops to show up in the taste was the grapefruit hops. These grapefruit hops lingered on my taste buds for a few minutes. After the grapefruit hops had enough time in the spotlight, they made way for the piney hops. These piney hops didn't stick around for too long because out of nowhere, in comes the grapefruit hops again. I guessed they thought that they didn't have enough in this beer before, so they shoved the piney hops out of the way. I guess you can say the grapefruit hops were very aggressive, but it made for a great taste. There weren't many flavors following the hops, but I couldn't care less about that. The hops were more than enough for me. If you want to know, the flavors that followed the hops were bitter and tart grapefruit and a splash of lemon.
Mouthfeel: 11% ABV? You have got to be kidding! That's what I first thought after I had a few sips of this beer. This beer completely masked it's high 11% ABV. Not only did it hide the ABV%, but the mouthfeel also had a long lasting hoppy aftertaste of a wide range of hops. This strong hoppy aftertaste will linger on the surface of your tongue for a good 10 minutes. 
Drinkability: Be careful when you drink Pliny the Younger. Even though it's extremely good, the 11% ABV will come down on you hard if you don't watch it. This beer lives up to all the hype it's received. It was an honor to try this wonderfully balanced hoppy beer. 3,027 charactersAltBock, May 02, 2009

Pours a strong orangecopper color with a thick white head and tremendous amounts of lacing.
Strong pine hop nose, some floral aspects as well. Some citrus comes out when the glass is moved.
Amazing flavor, the hop flavors are incredibly complex and powerful - pine, grapefruit, floral aspects all present at one time or another.
The finish is almost sweet, crisp and still powerful. 
I managed to get two of these, as the keg kicked in 26 minutes, the second glass was as powerful and tremendous as the first. According to my notes, the second glass seemed a bit more oily than the first, but not in any negative way. A great, great beer. 698 charactersmhatters, May 02, 2009

Ok so I don't know if I've even got words for this. I've been to the promised land at back. Getting my hands on this beer has been a pilgrimage of sorts. From what I understand, having a keg od pty this late is almost treason. That's ok with me though. I'm just glad to get a taste, fresh or not.
Where to start....The appearance is absolutely perfect. Its a pale/transparent honey gold. There's little head to speak of, but the head that exists is totally white. Absolute heaven. It laces beautifully down the glass.
Pty smells great, too. Hops hops hops. A ton of citrus is almost assaulting, followed by grapefruit and some piney notes as well.
The taste is the most complex I've ever experienced. There's a ton of grapefruit up front that grabs a hold of your tastebuds and doesn't let go as a slight bitterness works its way in followed by more grapefruit and even some lighter fruit notes. Melon maybe.
The beer is medium bodied and nothing really sticks out w/r/t carbonation.
The drinkability is incredible. I savored my one glass over the course of 45 minutes, yet gulped down the first half almost instantly.
Long story short...I need more. 1,196 charactersoriginalsin, Apr 23, 2009
4.65/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A: Color is rich, pale hued but with an orange and honey goodness. Not a lot of head or lacing, but the carbonation appears bubbles up in champagne-reminscent strands.
S: Gobs of hops. Citrus zest and even honeylike blossoms. All of this in conjunction with a bit of alcohol presence that gives an indication that this brew is serious business (though it is still deceptively strong, trust me). 
T: The citrus from the nose is delivered, grapefruit, orange peel, some sweet citrus blossoms balancing the bitterness and alcohol. Add some pine to the mix, and even some peppery spiciness from the array of hops assaulting the mouth. Alcohol is well masked, but the beer kicks my tongue's ass. This beer grabs my tongue and squeezes the taste buds. Do not mix with lawnmowing, as this is no lawnmower beer. Huge, possibly frightening flavors.
M: Medium body, somewhat oily. Smooth in my mouth but not thick. Carbonation, my tongue failed to perceive anything relevant, as my palate was too busy being wrecked.
D: I have mixed feelings on this one. On occasion I have had a few pints of this (warning: bring a driver) and today I sipped on 12 oz. for probably 45 minutes. Of course you should drink it if you see it, but just because it is so rare and uniquely tasty. If this was more freely available it is not something I would buy too frequently. A great beer to savor, preferably last as it is a palate annihilator. The only problem is that I always drink it first because I am scared the keg will blow. 
Not my favorite beer, maybe not even perfectly suited for my palate, but an achievement in brewing. No other beer is similar. Considering the thousands of IPAs brewed in America, that is an astounding statement. 1,721 charactersvacax, Apr 23, 2009

A: Beautiful golden, copper color. Off-white/ ivory head that dissipates in about a minute or so. Left great lacing on the glass as the beer consumed.
S: White grapefruit up front, taken over pleasantly by the sweeter, more tropical fruit smell of pineapple as the beer warms a bit. Maybe a hint of maple syrup offered as a malt backbone, but very minimal.
T: This is the most interesting and complex beer that I have ever tasted. In addition to an exquisite flavor, I loved the fact that this beer had a "3 Phase" taste to it. The first phase consisted of a huge grapefruit punch. The second phase was the big grapefruit flavor giving way to a sweet pineapple flavor. This only lasts briefly, but is extremely pleasant and is the perfect balance for the grapefruit. The third phase consisted of more grapefruit taste, but this time a more tart grapefruit. The aftertaste lasts a minimum of 10-15 seconds post-swallow, before it heads the way of a nice and dry finish.
M: Smooth, medium bodied, with a bit of oiliness/ stickiness left on the tongue from the massive amount of hops used to make this fine brew.
D: I am forcing myself to drink this slowly, which is hard to do since it packs so much flavor. I would love to drink this every time I have a beer. IIPA's are my favorite style of beer, and PtY has everything I could ever want, and more, in a beer. 1,472 charactersaglose45, Apr 19, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap @ Union Jack's (Boyertown, PA) on 4/11/09. Part of the '09 Easter Hopfest. 
Served in a tulip glass. 
Pours a beautiful crystal clear copper with a 1/2 finger of creamy brite-white head. Retention is just fantastic, continuing to bubble during the duration of the glass. Huge flare-up when swirled gets this back to it's original head level immediately, leaving a great looking smattering of lacing back. Just a top notch look here. The aroma on this beer just OOZES hops and tropical fruits. Floral notes, spices, piney residues, grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. If it's associated with West Coast hops, it's crammed in here. Thick bread and caramel add an extra layer to the nose, mixing with the citrus to impart a robust tang. There's also a touch of alcohol beef to the proceedings but it in no way infringes on the other smells in this. Overall quite fantastic and I could sit here and sniff this all day! 
The first thing I think of upon my first sip is how well balanced this is. Huge spicy and piney hops up front that are immediately cut and evened out by a slick backbone of caramel, bread, and tropical fruits that just explodes in the middle, before settling into a exceedingly bitter finish that lays a dry feel and lingering warmth on the palate. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an overall creamier feeling carbonation but there is a definite sharp prickle to it as well as you swallow. Of course, probably the highlight of this beer is the magnificently hidden ABV. At 11%, there is absolutely some alcohol beef to the overall profile but it stays warming, never gets stinging, and fits in with the general hugeness of the beer. 
Hands down, this is a hoppy masterpiece. The exceptional balance, flavors, and most of all drinkbility of their flagship Pliny the Elder taken to a new level. Seek it out. 1,832 charactersKegatron, Apr 14, 2009

A: Dear Lord, it even looks like the king of IIPA's! Bright, bright golden copper color - really stands out - we actually placed this beer next to pours of Bear Republic Apex, Avery Mahajara and Hop Stoopid. And Younger was the prettiest, by far. Looks like a beer drinker's dream, with a nice white 1/2 inch sticky white head. full lacing throughout
S: A hop blast for sure. To my nose pine dominates, but grassy grapefruits hues are around. Smells fresh and wonderful.
T: No comparison. Masterfully hopped, beautifully bitter. The hops assault the back of the tongue, while just a light kiss of malt caresses the front. Not a fair balance, but oh man does it work here. In the debate of east vs west coast IPAs this one destroys all the east coast IPA arguments for malt balance and hop goodness. Younger laughs at you, big malt bills.
M: Resiny sticky mouthfeel, great coverage - taste bud fatigue might be a problem after a few, wish I could find more than one or two at a time. When you don't even notice the carbonation either way, it must be perfect.
D: Damn scary. I'd be dead before I realized I drank too much of this, or my tongue through in the towel from the hop beating. 
This is the first time I've sought out one of the OMG beers and have it exceed the hype and expectations. And yes, Elder does not even come close. 1,425 charactersbwd110, Apr 13, 2009

4.78/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a snifter at Capone's on Sunday morning March 29th, 2009. What a fantastic event. Kudos, as usual to Matt and his peeps. Double IPAs and strong sour beers at 10am on a Sunday, BooYa Grandma!
Arrived at the table as I said in a snifter, nearly filled to the brim. The room left for head was about ¼ inch. (not complaining mind you, as I knew the keg would kicked in minutes). The ¼ inch head was stark white and tight. It hung around for quite a while, while I took these notes on appearance. When it receded, if you looked straight on, it almost appears as though it hadn't. But looking in from above, you could see it did. The liquid was a dark golden color with a copper hue when held to the light. 
The smell was sheer hop goodness. Citrus hops abound, grapefruit, grapefruit rind, sweet oranges, and lemon peel. Yes, all of these and potentially more. There was a bit of piney hops in the middle. Finishing out the aroma was a bit of sweetness, not quite caramel, but that smell when making simple syrup, just boiling sugar and water. 
Wheeew, hop city, next stop! The hop flavor in this one is nearly beyond comparison. I would not say the bitterness is as high as many others, but hop flavor, oh baby. Citrus dominates, with pine taking a back seat. I mostly get grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit and grapefruit zest. A bit of the lemon zest and oranges from the nose comes in late. A bit of sweet candy like malt comes in the middle but quickly is beaten back by the hops. A bit of alcohol heat can be found right before the finish. Speaking of the finish, it is a wonderfully smooth lingering bitterness. 
Body is medium to full. Carbonation is light with a fine, creamy smooth feeling. There is bit of drying in the finish that combines with the bitterness to make you long for the next sip.
Drinkability is quite high but loses a fraction and is not quite as quaffable as his uncle. 1,907 charactersjackorain, Apr 03, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Tria Washington Square - I drove 30 miles to partake. Tria was exceeding fire code capacity when we arrived at 6:45, so I had to take the wife to Banana Republic to spend some cash and kill some time. Luckily the kegs were still dispensing when we returned at 7:30.
Served in a Tulip Glass, perhaps a little too cold. 
Great expectations...
A: Golden with some cloud (Tria was dark) Head is formidable but recedes evenly. Sticky lace remains.
S: Intense, full hops. Fresh and Green. My wife says it reminds her of our trip to Sonoma. So packed and powerful that the hops can't get out of their own way. I expected a more extreme hop aroma but was pleasantly surprised at the relative balance. Floral notes - white flowers.
T: In a word: Sublime. perfectly balanced with no regrets. I generally like something with more aggressive hops, but this has shifted my paradigm. Fresh and green, which is especially surprising, considering that I am drinking a beer from Sonoma while standing in the middle of Philly. Hops are extreme, but in check with everything else. Little or no malt character.
M: Medium to High carbonation. Not too thick. A little sticky.
D: 11% ABV!? It sure doesn't taste it. But two beers in, I start to feel it. If I lived in northern CA, I'd be a lot less productive.
Overall: Probably the best I've ever had. Would love try it next to some fresh Ruination, Pliny the Elder and DFH 120 - Talk about a final four... 1,452 charactersRuinationMan, Apr 03, 2009

 I went in expecting to enjoy but not be blown away. The elder is my fav- until tonight. Yes friends this beer lived up to its hype for me.

S - strong citrus-grapefruit and pineapple and piney hop aroma with a hint of the alcohol to come
T - the taste follows the nose exactly, lots of citrus hops up front followed by more of a piney hop flavor
M/D - Definitely worth seeking out. I was lucky enough to have this twice this year at the Local 44 event and at Capones later on. The only thing that keeps me from rating this 5 across the board is the abv. that keeps me from drinking alot of it and remembering my name.

A-- Pours a bit hazy deep to mild orange depending on how the lighting is. Nice creamy head that lingers for a while. Great sticky lacing.
S-- smells of pineapple, grapefruit, pinecones and all the resiny goodness you would expect from a high alcohol DIPA. Malts peek there head out to say hello then disappear until the beers has a chnace to warm a bit.
T-- mmm...hops...first sip gives me a great taste of grapefruit that almost compares with hopslam's grapefruit character but not quite. The hops also have a pine and pineapple flavors in this bad boy. alcohol adds some fruity esters which is very nice. malts once again come in to help out in keeping this beer drinkable..a bit bready from malts...very very delicious...
M-- smooth and a little sticky...goes down really easy...

T - Taste was right on with the nose. This beer smelled like hoppy citrus and couldn't have delivered any better. Not the hoppiest beer I've ever had, but close to it, yet still maintains a balance of delicate undertones
M - Medium in carbonation and body
D - While this is crazily hopped, I could drink it just for sheer appreciation of its beauty. This is by and far the best beer I have ever tasted. I have had a lot of beers that haven't lived up to the hype, but this one did. 561 charactersMartin2D, Apr 02, 2009

I have had it three times over the years and most recently had it for the first time in a quite a few years. My pallate is more refined, I've seen more, I've done more. This beer still took me by surprise. I didn't even take a sip for ten minutes, I just smelled it. This beer is a style defining beer in my opinion. Forget about putting the Coke recipe in Fort Knox, lock this baby up.
Trade for it, beg for it, travel for it. Just make sure you try it before you die. 579 charactersNolanGTI, Mar 31, 2009

Flavor is quite malty with a sweet finish. A bit heavy and harsh at times and not as citrusy as the growler version I had. Certainly not as citrusy as Elder. Second time around I was less impressed by this one. It is a heavy IIPA and at times overbearing. Fun to try, but I think I'm done seeking out this one. Elder is better!

A - Clear golden/amber body with one-finger bubbly white foam cap that settled to a patchy film but flared up with each swirl of the glass and left thick lacing around the glass. Carbonation is minimal. 
S - Sweet, citrusy hops reeking of pineapple and grapefruit. Mild alcohol notes appeared, especially as it warmed up a bit. The Younger is packed to the gills with West Coast hop goodness... even more than its Elder counterpart! 
T - West Coast DIPA all the way with a bold smack of pungent citrus hops suggesting pineapple and grapefruit. Some sweet caramel malt swoops in at the end to balance out the intense hop bitterness. Hops take on a more resiny character toward the finish. 
M - Medium bodied, although a bit lighter than your usual DIPA, with moderate carbonation and a light syrupy texture, yet still retains a smooth, creamy mouthfeel overall. Finishes with an assertive hop bitterness on the palate. 
D - This is perhaps the Holy Grail of West Coast DIPAs, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to get this on tap in PA! However, I'm sticking with Dreadnaught as my benchmark DIPA. With that said, Pliny the Younger is certainly no slouch and nothing short of an amazingly crafted West Coast style DIPA. Definitely worth the hype... even after standing in a line that rivaled the re-release of Star Wars back in 1997! 1,396 charactersffejherb, Mar 29, 2009

A-A beautiful clear orange, with a generous pillowy white head and lots of lacing.
S-Best. smelling. beer. ever. Pine hops, grapefruit hops, even some floral notes. Each swirl of the glass yields another burst of aromas.
T-Lives up to its hype, and the promise of the nose. As with the nose, all of the hop flavors are present at one time or another. Citrus, then pine, then floral, then pine, then citrus, etc. A nice, almost honey like sweetness in the finish is the final delicious touch.
M-And yet, for all of the flavor, this is still medium bodied, a little oily but not overly so.
D-Well the sixtel kicked in 26 minutes so I can only imagine the second would have been exceptionally drinkable like the first. Given the ABV, one is certainly the right number.
Wow!

It still had a nice piney smell with a hint of sweetness, and a little acidity. The mouthfeel was richer than the elder, becuase of the maltiness and higher alcohol. It had that hazey golden straw color in the glass. As far as drinkability it was easy to drink but a little to rich to drink alot 437 characterslocstir, Mar 26, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this after the Firkin Fest at the Green Dragon. I would have rather had this early in the night but it wasn't an option. After drinking warm cask conditioned beers all day this was as an exceptional way to end the event. 
The brew came in a six ounce serving in red wine glass. Color is almost electric tangerine, crystal clear and topped with about a finder of fine white head. Nose, is over the top hops all the way. After sniffing some big northwest IPA's all day, the Younger was much more intense. Flavor follows nose. In fact it's a bit hard to judge any of the other flavor components with such an intense contribution from the hops, but hey this beer is all about hops. Hopefully I'll have the chance to review this one again, earlier in the night. Damn Fine brew! 777 charactersSickBrew, Mar 22, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Had on tap at the South Philly Tap Room. Served in a wine glass.
Golden orange/yellow with a small fluffy white head on top. The hop aroma of this beer was really great. Very strong smell of floral hops, some citrus, and pine. 
Holly hops! I would say that is about the best way to describe the taste of this beer. This one is aggressive. It felt like my mouth was being coated. The beer stuck to the inside of my mouth as if it did not want to be swallowed. It was relatively smooth and left my tongue tingling. There was some pine flavor, citrus, orange, grapefruit. I also found a hint of sweetness. After the first few sips I felt the hops and alcohol in my stomach. For 11%, the alcohol was pretty well hidden until it warmed me up on the way down. 
The drinkability on this one is not very high. A definite sipper that I probably would not have more than 1or 2 of. 
Overall this is an amazing beer, but after having both the Elder and the Younger I have to give the edge to the Elder. The Elder still has a great hop presence and seemed to be much more smooth and drinkable. That's just my 2 cents however. 1,116 characterswilliam5586, Mar 21, 2009

4.49/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a golden orange into a Chimay-ette glass. Yes, that be a mini Chimay, a glass reserved for the heathens and the wannabees for such holier than thou brews! The rest of us, with permission, drink from a standard Chimay glass. Alas, we all fail. As this beer, and so many others are better consumed from a wine glass in my opinion, but alas, I digress. Brew looks good on the pour yet an off white head dissipates swiftly, leaving little lacing.
Nice hop nose which only improves with a bit of agitation later on. Floral up front, and going bombastic later on. Woodsy and rippin' when gassed. Very nice.
Taste is a bit of viscous orangey malts but not in the bad way I view many brews, somewhat typical of my experience within the style actually. Nice but nothing over the top. Lots of hops on the tongue and enough malt balance to hide the hefty ABV quite well. Nice feel and drink as the beer goes down reasonably well but gets a bit overwhelming in short order. A rare beer that actually lives up to the hype. Quite different, and superior, to the Elder in my view. 1,073 charactersHalfFull, Mar 20, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Just had this on tap at Monk's Cafe in Philly.
Wow! I have heard and read a ton about this beer and being from the East Coast was worried I'd never get to try this beer; luckily RR has sent some out this way and I was able to track it down. 
Was a bright orange color when poured into the glass and had a nice sticky head that laced the glass throughout the drinking experience. The aroma was an inviting scent of floral and citrus hops that wasn't too overwhelming; sometimes these types of beer smell better than they taste, but this was not the case here.
The taste is where this beer shines as there are a ton of floral hop flavors bursting right off the palate. It took me a few sips to distinguish the other flavors, but after the initial floral hop flavors comes in the citrus, especially grapefruit, flavors and then finishes with a nice subtle, almost sweet, malt that is necessary to keep your taste buds from exploding. 
The drinkability of this beer is what will get you; 11% and I couldn't find a trace of it anywhere. I don't know how they were able to put this much hop flavor and that much alcohol into a beer and keep it so drinkable. I tore through 2 glasses of this before I even realized it. Overall, this beer was just about flawless and I don't think I will see IPAs the same way again. Believe the hype.

A- Pliny The Younger came to me with a bright orange with some gold hints here and there. Holding this glass in my hand the color seemed to bounce on to my skin with the same bright color. Not much in terms of head just some white streaks scattered.
S- A nice mountain of hops that are quite subdued surprisingly. Cirtus scents left and right. A lot of grapefruit and some pine in there as well. Just so much juicy hops that I don't know what else to say. Tropical scents abound. My friend oglmcdgl said it reminded him of a powdered lemon jelly donut.
T- It's been about two years since I had this last and it's still the bomb. The hops work their magic giving off the tropic and floral qualities that they are known to do grapefruit being most dominate. A bit of piney essence as well. Some sticky sweetness presents itself as well. This is kick ass stuff!! 
M- A bit thicker than the elder as the younger is pretty much medium bodied. Bittering hops on the tounge but not too much. For 11% alc it is hidden remarkably well with some sweetness coming from the some ingredient. The taste of this hangs around for a bit after drinking.
D- Dangerously drinkable, but at 11% dangerous in it's own right. Younger is limited so i'm glad I tried 20oz or so and will be looking for it again in the next month. After a month, my guess is that younger won't be around for another year or more, so in the meantime i'm enjoying living in SEPA. 1,499 charactersBARFLYB, Mar 17, 2009

A - Served in 33cl Chimay goblet. Georgous golden color, slightly hazy, with soft foam head.
S - Almost 100% grapefruit. I prefer my hops to lean to the citrus side of the spectrum, and I just couldn't ask for a better first whiff.
T - Ditto the smell. Fresh grapefruit rind. Sweet candy. Alcohol is superbly well hidden.
M - Creamy smooth. Not too viscous for such a high malt content. Very nice carbonation.
D - Very Very good. While 11%, Younger never forces you to take small sips. A half a mouthful or more is a very reasonable dose.
It looks like my quest to find the most citrusy-perfect IIPA has ended. Younger is truly the standard (perhaps unfairly) that all future IIPAs will be judged against. 741 characterstubbnik, Mar 16, 2009

Pliny pours a bright golden orange with a thick, white head with good retention. Lacing was a little patchy but the way this beer glowed was rather unique. On the nose... well, it's just like I remembered. An explosion of hops - pine, citrus, hop resin, mild fruit. Dank hops. On the palate, it is just that, a riotous explosion of hops, semtex and hops. Medium-light in body with a mild sweetness to counter the hop bitterness, this is spectacular.
The past 6 weeks seems to have taken it's toll on the mouthfeel, the hops aren't as vibrant as I remember them being. That said, it's still a perfect 5 (fresh Younger deserves a 6) and drinkability? I had 4 glasses, over a liter of this stuff, and I wanted more. Fabulous stuff. 782 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 16, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Local 44 and Memphis Taproom in Philly yesterday.
The beer pours a striking golden peach color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose... this beer is just heaven. There is a huge blast of pine and dry bitter citrus, with a hop presence so intense that it imparts almost a slight skunky, marijuana aroma. Have seen this in a few over the top wet hop bombs in the NW, but suffice it to say that such an intense, gorgeous nose is extremely unusual and impressive. The flavors on the palate replicate the nose, except there is an intensity of flavor that is just astonishing. Tried this side by side with the elder - the elder was almost light and watery by comparison!!! The finish just goes on and on in this beer, and there is an underlying creamy smooth mouthfeel to this beer that is, once again, astonishing.
At 11% alcohol, drinkability is of course a problem, but this great beer carries its alcohol very well. Ended up drinking three 10 ounce glasses of this great beer, before I was finally worn out. For a hophead like myself, this beer is a wet dream in a glass. Fabulous stuff!
Edit from 2/11. Was fortunate enough to have several glasses (three if the truth be known) at the brewpub on the release date (friday). Nothing really to add to my review, except to note what an incredible treat it was to have this beer so fresh. Fresh at the site; a couple weeks old in Portland; roughly a month old in SEPA... younger is consistently excellent and delicious. 1,487 charactersJohn_M, Mar 16, 2009

A: Nice garnet hue with no head. Swirling it around in my glass - it looks rather thick.
S: Smells sweet and syrupy, reminds me of stone fruit.
T: Nice sweet aftertaste of cherries. Overall it was very sour - you can taste the hops. Unfortunately the bar where I had this has sat on the keg for a few weeks before taping it. When I had this about a month ago in Portland it was really splendid - a nice and fresh taste of hops hops hops! The color was a bit lighter and the aroma very citrusy and fruity. Although it wasn't as fantastic this last time it still was an exceptional IPA.
M: Nicely carbonated. A good balance. 
D: Not too bad to drink but the 11% abv was a bit much for me - can't drink too much! But in small quantities for those of us with lighter-alcohol tolerances it was quite grand! Personally I don't adore lots of hops but that is just me. I don't think this is the best beer ever and rather liked PTE better...now don't shoot me for it! But I can see why others think it is a gift from the beer gods. Great beer though! 1,135 charactersHatTrick, Mar 16, 2009

A: Light golden, with some straw tones... solid white head, quality retention and lacing... when I walked into the bar they had just started pouring this... nearly everyone went right for the younger (also had elder, consecration, blind pig, damnation, salvation, and rejection on draft)... you can spot this beer across the bar and its so appetizing... ordered it up and waited for the keg to kick in roughly a half hour
S: Powerful citrus hop blast, mostly grapefruit but hints of tangerine... not as much pine as the elder, but certainly in abundance 
T: Incredibly balanced... sure the hops are crazy strong with intense pine and grapefruit, with a nice resiny bite, but this beer has the smoothest flavoring ever... the malt is soft, slightly sweet, and has a real nice character to it... 
M: Absurd. Super smooth. Crisp finish. Dry hop bite.
O: Out of this world. I looked down after about five minutes and I was halfway through my glass.
Edit: I've had this a a few times since my original sampling... I am down grading it a bit from what was once a 5.0/5.0 beer. The score reflects my current opinion. 1,240 characterscallmemickey, Mar 16, 2009

Pours a golden orange-ish color with a small head that leaves a sticky lacing as i drink it down.
Smell is phenomenal slightly sweet with a huge hop nose and grapefruit
Taste is hops (of course), grapefruit, pine and slight sweetness. The 11% is well hidden, but i could see how a few of these could put you away. especially on an empty tummy.
Mouth is medium body with perfect carbonation. the aftertaste of the hops lingers on the tongue for a loonggg time.. =)
Drink is very high the only reason i didn't give it a 5 is becase of how damn hard it is to find this. (Some people might disagree with my reasoning but it's my review so screw you) 749 charactersSirChugsAlot, Mar 14, 2009

D: Hides the alcohol very well, but dang, you really feel it in the head after just one 10 oz glass!
A+. Gotta take a road trip to Santa Rosa sometime (with a stop at North Coast and a half-dozen other breweries on the way)...
[Note: PTY and PTE are very sought-after beers around here. I've been looking for both for weeks at every little local place that has a good selection of beers in town, and today is the first day I've found both. Belmont Station got in a small quantity of PTE bottles as well as PTY on tap. Within minutes of getting there, their whole stock of PTE was wiped out. Managed to get 2 bottles for later.] 1,194 charactersneckarmueller, Mar 10, 2009
4.48/5  rDev -4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Served at Obriens $5 for a 10 oz. tumbler.
A: amber-copper, small cap white fluffy head, disspates quickly. High clarity, bright color. 
S: lots of pine, citrus.
T: Large dose of hops. Piney, w/ a long bitter finish like eating grapefruit. 
M: Heavy, silky, velvet. Very smooth. 
D: Fantastic beer. High ABV kept me from drinking more than 30 oz. 
Pliny the younger is a great beer. Have had it side by side with blind pig, and pliny the elder. To my taste the younger and elder have similar characteristics, in taste and smell, although the younger just takes it too the next level. The mouthfeel of the younger is creamier, and smoother w/ less fizz. 658 characterssteadydose, Mar 09, 2009
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on-tap at Uber Tavern in Seattle, WA as my first beer of the night (clean palate!)
A: Golden citrus in color with diamond like clarity. No skimping in the head department, this one yields (similar to Pliny) a huge fluffy off white head. Lots of curtainous "ringed" lacing.
S: Light floral hops, huge citrus nose! 
T: Fantastic! Huge citrus blast, some candy like sweetness, floral hops, piney, but not as much as Elder...not nearly as much...which is GREAT. This is really a superbly refined and well balanced DIPA. Hats off you to RR. 
M: Smooth, medium bodied beer that just wants to love your mouth. 
D: High ABV will limit physical tolerance and overall drinkability, but damn if I don't want to risk it all and try anyway! 740 charactersjulian, Mar 08, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -3.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served cold, in a pint glass, on tap at Catalyst in Fort Collins, Colorado.
It has a golden orange color with just a skim layer of white head on top. It has very good clarity for a beer of this style. Nice lacing is left behind but I can't stop swirling to get that great aroma out!
It's huge and hoppy with floral fruity goodness in the nose. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had.
There is big hoppy bitter flavors but not (quite) overpowering. It's very similar to the Elder but with the hops turned up to 11. Sticky resiny hops and just a bit of sweetness to offset the bitterness. It certainy has the same hop profile as the Elder.
Sticky mouth-coating stuff with big body and a sticky dry/bitter finish. The alcohol burn is more noticible as it warms. 
Drinkability is limited simply because of the strength and bitterness. It's definately a great double IPA but I find the Elder to be more enjoyable overall. A great hop fix! 944 charactersGilGarp, Mar 08, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at O'Brien's, once again. Served in 10oz. glasses, a brilliant yellow gold with pristene clarity and a pure white 1/4" foam head.
It looks so inviting, especially when you know what your getting into.
Sweet hoppiness greets the nose. Citrus nectar of grapefruit, tangelo, honeysuckle, pine and peppermint, permeate the nose. The best hop smell in an ale, ever!
The taste is unlike any 2X IPA, once you get to know it. Sweet hoppiness reigns with tangy citrus and somewhat sappy pine leading the way. In steps a slight malt note, followed by a fresh peppermint and lightly bitter finish. Balanced and clean throughout...best hop flavor ever.
Medium bodied with the alcohol burried within the complex flavor. The carbonation is subtle yet perfect...refreshing as cool spring water. This brew is way too drinkable...there will never be to much hype put on this ale, it's the best in it's class, bar none. 911 charactersscottoale, Mar 07, 2009

Dark golden appearance with almost no head.
Smells like a hop monster.
Tastes like a hop monster. Similar to Pliny the Elder but a little "thicker". That said, mouthfeel is full but as light as an 11% ABV beer can be. Alcohol is well hiddn but starts to become apparent after about half a glass.
Overall, an excellent brew. It is definitely the Elder taken to the next level. As one would expect, the high ABV limits drinkability. It may be overhyped, but this is still a great beer that any hop head needs to try. 554 charactersMickeyHops, Mar 06, 2009
4.49/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 410oz glass poured on draft at Bailey's Taproom. Color somewhere between golden and amber, without much in the way of a head. Aroma of sharp, floral, piny hops, with notes of pineapple and cannabis. Palate is a straight-up hop bomb, possibly the hoppiest beer I've had outside of fresh hop season here in Oregon. Grass, pineapple, and cannabis notes peek through the sticky, syrupy, hoppy backbone, while a touch of bready malt comes through to balance things out on the finish, only to be overtaken by a serious grapefruit character that lingers long after the swallow. A fantastic offering, although somewhat brutal on the palate. But, if you love hops like I do, you've got to try it. 686 charactersElGordo, Mar 03, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5For sure one of the best IPA's in the world. Pours an orangish brown with a silky beige head. 
The nose has a bouquet citrus and pine over bready malts, caramel and toffee.
A perfectly balanced palate features sweet malts and fresh bitter hops. 
Body is crips yet full and compliments the brew very well. I could enjoy this any time. 336 charactersrye726, Mar 02, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance- Orange Amber liquid with a fluffy off white head
Smell- Freshly herbaceous and flowery hops 
Taste- Lush, verdant, piney hops up front, middle and last give this beer a uniquely "live" charatcter. Malt backbone is substantial, yet clearly overwhelmed by massive hops. Big alcohol presence is nicely masked by big flavor
Mouthfeel- Moderate smooth carbonation, medium bodied, but seemingly sticky with hops resins
Drinkability- A very big beer and quite extraordinary. High ABV detracts slightly from drinkability. 529 charactersolmatty, Mar 02, 2009
4.6/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Tons of cheers to Beerzebub for this one. 
Pours a very nice golden with surprisingly thick and well laced head. Carbonation is active and this looks thick. 
Scent is the elder on crack. Citrus out the ass. 
Taste is...so bitter yet clean. Tropical but not really sweet. Fruity but only in spots. Bitey but not dry. Alcohol well hidden. Really great. 
Mouth body and carbonation are medium, and this is very drinkable and good, but so so difficult to get. I'll savor every drop of this growler. 498 characterssonicdescent, Feb 28, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: That same hazy golden-orange color of the Elder with the same cloud-white head. the head sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass.
Aroma: For my money, this is the best nose I have ever experienced. There is tons of grapefruit, but the marijuana smell really sets this apart. The bready malt is also there as well, but all of this exists in perfect balance avoiding anything that could be described as overly sweet.
Mouthfeel: Oily and syrupy, this one just coats your mouth. The absolutely perfect carbonation helps to accent and trigger (for lack of better word) the flavors to bloom.
Taste: Wow! How can this possibly be 11%!?! The hops are just note perfect. it is like the best grapefruit juice you've ever had... in beer form! The bready malt is there, though subdued, to give it the perfect balance without any cloying sweetness.
Overall impression: I drank two half pints, but that was probably overdoing it. It is very drinkable, but that alcohol, though very well hidden, will get you. If the Tap House had not run out of the Elder, I would have switched to that. The buzz is somewhat stoney as well. I love love LOVE this beer, but I'd have to give the slight nod to the Elder, simply due to its lower abv. 1,254 charactersjkendrick, Feb 27, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had on tap at Fathers Office in Santa Monica, CA. A nice suprise on a recent trip there. Pours copper, looks virtually clear, with creamy head and decent lacing and retention (note: bar lighting was not the best so this is the best I can get to the look). Smell was superb. A nice kick of piney hops with some caramel maltiness. There is a presence of alcohol but nothing terrible. Taste was great as well. A strong citric kick to it, stong tastes of pineapple and grapefruit I thought. Strong malt backbone, a bit of a sweet caramel taste. Warming on the way down and leaves behind a nice hop bitterness to it. The first sip is pretty intense I must say. The mouthfeel was perfect I thought. Very smooth, somewhat silky...just great. Not too light or thin, but not too thick or creamy. Overall a great beer, not that anyone is suprised. I could easily have a couple in a sitting. I, unfortunately, had to drive so I could just enjoy the one. But between a great beer and a great bar, this was an amazing beer experience. 1,021 charactersbunnyhustle, Feb 25, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have long since given up on milestone beers. That being said this beer is a milestone all on its own so I am going to make it review 900. It has been my holy grail for the past year or so and a great big fucking thanks goes out to Talisker for once again hooking a brother up!
I owe you.
Being the good guy I am I took it to the local tasting group for all to enjoy.
A: Pours an ultra clear golden hue that is actually fairly light for the style. Bold creamy head quickly rises to a nice solid cap. Good retention, lots of lace and fizz when swirled. This one begs to be drank.
S: Holy hops batman! This baby is pure hop juice. Huge hop aroma with wonderful scents jumping out at you. Juicy orange and sweet apricot play well with peach and grapefruit. Green grass cuts through along with an absolute bouquet of flowers.
T: The malt in this beer must be ridiculous for the balance to be so spot on despite the insane amount of hops. Nice sweet caramel malt peeks through but trust me there is much more going on here in the malt department. That being said it has no chance to shine. The hops plow through with the malt doing its best just to provide balance... which it does quite nicely. The hop flavors are like nothing I have ever tasted. Sweet, Citrus, and Floral are all there. Sun sweet apricot and peach really stand out with notes of sweet mango. The green grass cuts through and seems to duel with sweet orange and bitter grapefruit. To call this beer complex would be an understatement. To call it great would be a crime. It is sooo much more and even better I could ever imagine.
M: Full bodied, rich, thick, smooth. It coats the mouth and throat with sweet and bitter fruit that just lingers and lingers. Pure sex in a bottle. 
D: I had two full glasses and if there had been more I would have had a third. That being said I was fine drinking all the beers at the tasting. When finished with this one I was bombed, yet there was no hint of the ABV in the flavor.
Huge aromas, and out of this world flavor. This is one many will try to duplicate but will no doubt fall short.
It is worthy of that holy grail title. The best beer in the world? I would say so at least for now. The good news is my boy ibrew2or3 brought a growler home with him from his trip to Cali. I get a second round with this bad boy tomorrow. Life could not be better.
Give an arm, a leg, your first born. Get this one you will be glad you did. Talisker you rock man, I owe you big time! 2,482 characterstpd975, Feb 25, 2009
4.44/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sampled at the 9th Annual Double IPA Festival at the Bistro in Hayward.
A - The beer poured a copper color. I had the beer in a festival tasting glass so not much to talk about in terms of head and lacing.
S - Pine, grapefruit, citrus, floral. Everything you'd expect from Vinnie.
T - An explosion of hops, but also surprisingly malty. For such a big beer, it's not at all hot. 
M - Fairly viscous, but incredibly balanced for such an aggressive beer.
D - I could have pint after pint but I'd be drunk as a skunk before I knew it. 
I'm glad I got to try it. I'd like to drink it again, although I'm not going to go to great lengths to get it. Inevitably, this one is going to be compared to the Elder, and I have to side with the old guy. 744 characterssessycuban, Feb 24, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had this one on tap at the Horse Brass pub in Portland.
a: bright golden color with a slight haze to it
s: bright, piney and floral hop character, but not as agressively hoppy as expected.
t: surprisingly well balanced. big hop flavors, but with enough malt that it's not at all overly hoppy. expected this to be a bit hot at 11%, but just a little hint of warmth.
m: medium bodied, fairly sticky, with the agressive hop coating lingering on the palate for several minutes.
d: again, better than expected for such a huge beer, but I don't think I would want more than one in a sitting.
overall: a really excellent imperial IPA, but I'm not so sure it's deserving of such hype. I felt that batch one of this year's Deschutes Hop Henge was stickier, prettier, and generally more agressive. 
if this wasn't so rare and expensive, I'd happily have one now and then, but given the extreme hype and price tag, I don't think this is something I'd seek out again. 964 characterspkasten, Feb 24, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I finally got the chance to try Pliney the Younger at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver and it was well worth the wait.
A - The 8 ounce pour was a coppery-amber color that was clear with a nice head.
S - From the first sniff this beer is all business. Very hoppy aroma that beacons you to take a sip.
T - The Younger is similar to the Elder, but the higher ABV off-sets the smack of the 100+ IBUs.
M - The IBUs hit you from the beginning and linger long after the last sip.
D - The Younger is a very drinkable balance of malt and hops, each complimenting the other which leaves you wanting another one after you finish the first.
Definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. Highly recommended if you ever get the opportunity to try it. 748 charactersCPTJack, Feb 24, 2009
3.66/5  rDev -21.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75Falling rock had this on tap, and I didn't want to miss it. served in small snifter at the half pint volume. 
Bright ruby and amber brew, really likes the light and shines like a lantern. Good dense, white, and foamed head. Great lacing after every sip and quick swirls...all the way to the end. 
Mild hops aroma, yet complex. The alcohol is well concealed. Some floral and vanilla seem to be present as well.
Balanced taste to it. For as much hops as this thing has, the malt is present just at the beginning and a bit in the end. Smooth and sharp. Not bitter, buy very dry. 
Deceiving beer with the abv. Dangerous, but very nice.
Update:
This is my third PyT review, the other two being in 06 and 09.
Falling Rock tapped this tonight and I got in on the first of 3 kegs. 
Clear, clean light copper pour. A 1 finger white head foamed up. Lacing was thin, a quick swirl brought about the head again, yet lacing didn't quite stick.
A good blend in the aroma of citrus hops, some butteriness, pine and faint biscuit. 
A rather lack luster taste. A soft citrus body develops with thin pine and an aftertaste of malt. But that doesn't last long. The body is thin, the bite is quiet and the balance is easily overlooked. At 11% abv, it is very easy drinking. I'm a bit disappointed in this one this year. Still good, but not world class, imho.
Update the update: 2011 sample. I dunno, the taste just isn't meeting the nose (i've upped the smell score). Doesn't seem as juicy as I remember or expected based on the aroma. The appearance today wasn't all that good...no head...but that was due to the pour
Averaged out the scores above
Update: On tap at Backcountry Pizza in Boulder, Feb 11 2012. This version seems thinner. The nose is softer and less hoppy. Nothing bad about it. The feel is drier without the bite. It just kind of evaporates and leaves the palate quickly.
Update: 2016 tapping at FRTH.  Appearance and aroma are more than good, but still not great. Boozey a bit, but this one seems a bit more balanced.   For a triple IPA the bitterness is light. Sure, it's an IPA...but it seems the "triple" part is only for abv. Finishes really light and evaporative. 2,168 charactersMebuzzard, Feb 23, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this courtesy of gford217 - thanks!
Pours a slightly hazy honey copper color with a thick off-white head. The head sticks around for quite a while before settling into a large-bubbled crown leaving solid lacing.
Smells great. Hops and more hops are front and center - citrus, tropical, floral, and pine hop aromas. This really is every hop aroma under the sun. 
Tastes similar to how it smells, though with more of a malt backbone. The malt doesn't really have a flavor, just more of a setpoint from which to judge the huge amounts of hops. The bitterness sneaks up on you - managing to get stronger and stronger with each sip, but never so overpowering to hamper the hop flavors. The ABV is there, but it's as well hidden as any non-stout I've had with this high of a percentage.
Mouthfeel is good - good thickness with grainy carbonation make this one glide down my gullet.
Drinkability is great. I could drink not one, but multiple growlers of this - just so easy to drink.
Overall this beer did not disappoint. Everything is done exceptionally well and I hope everyone gets the chance to try this at one point or another. 1,135 charactersglid02, Feb 23, 2009
4/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Falling Rock $7 per 1/2 pint, wow. Served in a wine glass, nice orange color, smells amazingly hoppy like Pliny the Elder. Tastes bitter, hoppy, stronger. Honestly I think the Elder is better. This didn't seem to add hoppy value, only alcohol. A delicious IPA but the elder is better as far as I'm concerned. 322 charactersArrogantB, Feb 22, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Evan, who works at Brewbakers in Huntington and is a regular at Beachwood, popped in and was nice enough to trade me some of the Abyss '07 I had just bought for a few pours from one of his RR Growlers of the newest PtY batch. Many thanks to him for allowing me to finally try Younger - it was worth it.
Appearance: Poured with a translucent, "juicy" deep tree sap amber color. Head was fairly non-existent, but that could be more a consequence of this being in a growler. The lacing was pretty spectacular, canvassing-type stuff, which stayed for some time. Looks appetizing.
Smell: Deep, deep grapefruit, followed by basically the entire flavor spectrum of citrus fruits. Slight pine on the back end. Maltiness is there, expressing itself in a slight honey-like sweetness on the back end. Smells powerful, but not too powerful. Mega hoppy, but not in a detracting way. Just something else. Really is perfume-like, and makes you want to keep your nose in it for some time. It's less about complexity and more about simultaneous strength and balance.
Taste: Taste is similar to the smell. There is just an incredible balance here that only Elder can really compare to. It's basically the finest hop specimen I've tasted. Believe the hype.
Mouthfeel: Chewy, chewy, chewy. Juicy.
Drinkability: Intensely drinkable. I would basically take issue with anyone who said that Elder somehow is much more so. 1,402 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Feb 22, 2009
4.59/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Memorable Quality: The smell is an out of this world basket of hops, the hops punched me in the face like I have never experienced from a beer before. I felt like I was chewing a hop plant. I thought about this beer for days after I drank it, thoroughly deserving of the hype, the best hoppy beer on the planet.
EDIT: This thing actually haunted me for months. No beers could get close to it. Amazing. 402 characterssquaremile, Feb 22, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours from growler golden honey, substantial head dissapates to in impressive thin bubbly swirling lace that refuses to fade. Not expecting this with a brew of such girth. Rings of lace cling to the snifter. Pungent citrus hop aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and sticky sappy pine needles. It's hard to keep your nose out of the glass on this one. Taste is again a rush of citrus hops with a nice piney bitterness. Some very lite honey like malts sneak in mid way. Mouth is smooth but somewhat sticky. Finishes with a slight boozy warmth that coats the mouth with some apricot and again piney bitterness. The 11%abv was extremely well hidden and way to easy to drink. This was simply fantastic. Thanks so much Chris, for the unbelevable opportunity to try this from the source. 778 charactersdrunkmonk, Feb 22, 2009

I've been waiting for this beer for quite some time now, and there I was.
The aroma was so divine, deep ruby red grapefruit with a wonderful floral bouquet.
Taste was amazing. More so than the Elder. In a way that its more complex, lasting and bright.
I could drink this all night long, and I did!
One truly amazing DIPA. A fine example of RR excellence to world class beers! 415 charactersDajtai007, Feb 22, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -7.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Found the Younger on tap - not once, but twice - today in Portland. 10 oz. pour at Concordia Ale House (tapered glass - $8), 10 oz. pour at Henry's Tavern (snifter - $6.25).
A: Clear golden/sunshine. Individual bubbles rise, slowly and lazily - not a very 'lively' look. Not much head either (barely 1/2 finger), a slight white cream; clings at the edges, a few floating suds at the center. Droopy lace, an indistinct pattern.
S: Placed at the center of the table, roughly 2 feet away from my nose, a perfume drifts over: sappy evergreen, orange citrus, mild honey/grain sweetness. Expected it to be bolder as it warmed, but it never grew - in fact, the aroma seemed to recede a little.
T: Burst of pine and pithy zest meets a tangy hop spicing. Flowery honey, sweetness of sticky buns. Develops quickly - transforming from a jarring jolt of hop spice/bitterness to a balanced citrus-y sweetness. Once the sharp hops subside, subtler elements like mint, even clove, enter. Doesn't kill the palate, a big plus.
M: Coating mouthfeel, thick and slightly chewy, remarkably creamy. Alcohol heat sneaks up just a little; some cheek-drawing warmth. Overall, a wonderous and exceedingly mellow feel. 
D: Ridiculously drinkable for an 11% beer. Generally a fine DIPA, enjoyable in all ways. Taste approaches 'greatness' for me, everything else is 'good' or thereabouts. Would have again (and enjoyed twice in a day), but not one I have to rush out and have again. Won't go overboard with the glowing praise: it's a very good DIPA. Have one if you can find it.
On the personal side: I prefer Pliny the Elder 1,603 charactersmsubulldog25, Feb 22, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Update 2/24/2010-
10 oz at County Cork for $5.75 IIRC. I enjoyed three glasses, and over all had a much more favorable impression them my first sampling, and have updated my scores to reflect it. In general, I found it to be exceptionally smooth, with only mild heat on the finish when I really looked for it. I don't feel that it's particularly hoppier tasting then PtE (I assume they've reached saturation point), and is simply a bit thicker and stronger, which detracts from the drinkability and overall enjoyment to PtE, which I prefer. A bit more of that resinous dank bite, but definately dangerous. Still, I don't think this would be the frenzy inducer that it is if it was a regular release. Luckily, PtE is!
Initial review 2/21/2009
ap-4
s-4.5
t-2.5
mf-3
d-2.5
10oz. snifter at the Concordia Ale House for a whooping $8 (granted hops aren't cheap now and there are clearly a lot in this, but still...). Clear pale orange with a light sand head. 
The aroma is very fragrant and bright, much more resinous then the Elder, and really smells exactly like a bag of dried hops, with a blast of alcohol. 
The taste was a let down for me. This beer is too hot and boozy for my taste. The 11% is painful, and detracts from the hop flavor, which ends up falling short complexity wise (e.g. the floral notes I enjoy in PtE), with a firm bitterness and dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is slick and oily, solvent like, medium bodied. 
Drinkabilty is pretty low all things considering, and overall I was sorely disappointed. PtE is one of my all time favorite beers, but probably I'll never bother having this again. If you can't find this but are eager to try it, take a PtE and drop a shot of vodka in it and you'll get the idea. 1,723 charactersccrida, Feb 21, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- This had a slightly foggy dark golden color. The head held up petty well. The place I was in was a bit dark so it was hard to see all the finer details of an appearance.
S- This smelled very very delicious. It was almost as if I had crushed up a fresh hop flower in to a fine powder and then snorted it. Very fragrant, lots of grapefruit citrus, yet had a slight dry smell to it. This also had a sweet smell, that of honey added in.
T- I've been waiting for this for a while and wow. The first sip was just too hard to take it all in. I was pumped to get the chance to even try this. I knew there would be hops, but I didn't know what to expect out of it. The hop taste is just like if you chewed up a few hop flowers and sucked down the goodness. The hop taste is slightly dry and I felt like there was a taste of dust in the aftertaste. The dusty taste reminded me of just a dusty attic or something to that effect. I think it was more of a dry taste note. There is also a nice bitterness in the aftertaste, not too bitter though. As far as sweetness goes it is sweet, but not nearly as sweet as a 120min IPA. One thing I like about this over the Elder, is this one isn't a palate killer. I could fully enjoy another beer style right after because it won't be too harsh. The one draw back to this beer is its sweetness, although good and has its place, I don't think I could drink a lot of this beer in one night, the sweetness would be too much for me. But I would like to have it on a regular tap line up for sure.
M- Just the right feel for the mouth.
D- This is very drinkable, but I think over time the sweetness would slow me down. 1,646 charactersWetpaperbag, Feb 21, 2009
4.6/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Grant for sharing this lovely growler treat.
Pours a beautiful gold color with a large frothy white head that reluctantly receded. Smells only of sweet, tangy c-hops that are the signature of west coast hop bombs. First sip is all puckering hops that are citrusy down to the bone. The hops overwhelmingly overpower the malts. There is no mistaking this Imperial IPA for an American Barley Wine...No sir! The 11% ABV is incredibly well hidden as I guessed on tasting it was around 8%. Tasty and unique. World Class 524 charactersATLbeerDog, Feb 21, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured out of a growler, shared by an extremely generous California BA, poured into a tulip.
I've been waiting to try this one for quite a while and was pretty certain that it couldn't live up to my expectations. The growler was full to the brim and opened with only the slightest hiss.
The pour was very good, extremely clear amber with a hefty cream-colored head that hung around on top for a while and left a bit of lacing. A good start.
It didn't take me long to get a whiff of this beauty, with a huge hoppy kick up front, juicy citrus, grapefruit, mangos and even some pine as well. There is plenty of malts in the nose to keep the hops for becoming overpowering, great balance overall.
The taste is exceptional with lots of the aforementioned pine hops but with even more grapefruit and other citrus sweetness thrown in. The malts provide a nice balance underneath but the finish is definitely bitter and sticky with hops.
The mouthfeel is well carbonated with lots of hop juice and a bitterness that builds up after each sip.
This beer is certainly the most drinkable 11% beer I've ever tasted and probably one of the top few beers I've had in recent memory. Exceptional. 1,185 charactersgford217, Feb 21, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got to enjoy this monster of a beer, thanks to beachbum1975! 
A: Pours dark yellow to amber, with ¼ inch of frothy tan head. Layers of white sudsy lacing on initial pour.
S: The smell is amazing! Strong hop, citrus and pine notes on the nose. Very fragrant 
M/T: Medium, syrupy body. A sting of alcohol with a clean but hoppy finish. This beer is HOT! Full flavored, with a strong alcohol presence on the tongue, that proceeds to the back of the throat. After initial hit, I get an explosion of bitterness, with a citrus finish.
D: For such a large beer, it drinks very well. The hops dissipates in the aftertaste, leaving you wanting more. 
Monster beer through and through and the best double IPA I have ever had. 723 charactersDrewOSU, Feb 21, 2009
4.24/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours an enormous sea-foam head that takes quite a while to subside, I quickly gave up the wait and fought my way through. Nice lacing all the way down the glass. I prefer a dirtier IPA with spots and flecks, this one was a clear peach-orange-lemon-amber. I love the sound of a RRBC growler opening.
Smell: Best and sweetest smelling hoppy beer ever. 5.0 without a doubt. Pure sweet hops, citrus, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and pine/evergreen. Incredibly juicy, but I would like to be able to smell at least some of the malt. I buried my nose in the growler for a solid five minutes every time I returned for a pour.
Taste: Pure wet hop. Still, there is a sweet maltiness to it, lots of grapefruit, tangerine, orange, pineapple, citrus, and a floral element. Did I mention the hops? There is some malt, but it is understated and provides some balance. 
Mouthfeel: Near perfect, if not perfect. It is like liquid, creamy candy. Very creamy and full with a nice hop stickiness; you can feel this one on the teeth. Near perfect carbonation; I might want a tad more but it could be the growler.
Drinkability: Despite the 11% ABV, this beer is highly drinkable - like a creamy, hop candy.
-- Updated for 2010 release; a bit of a step down from 2009 IMHO. More bitter, less sweet. Still smells like hop heaven but other scores adjusted accordingly. 1,366 characterscraytonic, Feb 20, 2009

S = Huge hops, fresh pine, and numerous citrus aromas (orange and lemons mainly).
T = Amazing mixture of bitter and sweet. Pine flavors upfront and then a strong malt backbone washes the bitterness away and leaves a semi-sweet pine finish. 
MF = Medium body with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and smooth.
Overall, this was incredibly balanced and very easy to drink. I've never been a "Hop Head", but, both Younger and Elder have converted me. 475 charactersRiverwarrior, Feb 20, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I don't give up all 5's very often but this one deserves it.
Pours out really clean and clear with two fingers of white suds. Pine tree in a bottle here. I mean the oily pine shit you get on your hands after cutting down a pine tree. Very strong pine smell in other words.
Tastewise, the bitterness hits first with a blackness from hades. You get used to it really quickly. Then the pine smell is twice as strong.And the malt and mellowness take over.
Really a complicated drink here.
Mouthfeel is perfect and you never know you have had an 11% beer in your hands. This is the perfect mouthfeel for an IPA.
Drinkability should be lower since you can't get this all the time. In fact, this year it only lasted 12 days. This is a travesty!
This is the perfect IPA for now. I can't wait for the beer to beat this one! 814 characterspeabody, Feb 20, 2009
4.67/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a growler into a big wine glass at 50 F/ 10 C.
Brilliant orange color with some fine haze. Minimal off-white head; a nice dense little head does materialize with a swirl, fleetingly. Finely patterned lace.
Hops dominate the aroma, mainly loads and loads of fresh pine, along with some milder tangerine and lemon. There's also a clean, straightforward sweet malty aroma something along the lines of cookie dough. Vibrant and alluring.
The flavor starts light, with a fresh fruity piny hop flavor floating on the palate, then everything builds and builds. Intense pine, citrus zest, sweet light clean malt, and very intense bitterness. The sweetness and bitterness grow together, but in the end the bitterness digs in deep and the sweetness is overcome. Some noticable alcohol, but it fits in seamlessly. Great cohesion and balance. Very very long finish of fresh citrus rind and pine bitterness, somehow achieving almost total dryness.
Cushy luxurious carbonation. A pleasure to drink.
Great beer, and a big thanks to my broski Alex for sending me this. 1,069 charactersBeerzebub, Feb 19, 2009

What a beer! It's everything I would want in a DIPA. A hazy gold, with almost no head. Smelled like a hop bomb but not so much to turn you off. The taste was SO balanced it really isn't even funny. Just as it starts to get too bitter the honey like sweetness coats your tongue! 
Well deserving of the hype! 391 charactersmadtowndmb1, Feb 19, 2009

Well, here goes... I get a little excited reviewing some of these special beers. 
Pours with a nice foamy white head that fades fairly quickly. Clear Orange/Amber color with the slightest amount of visible carbonation. Nice rings of lacing left behind in the glass . Nice looking beer.
Aroma is fantastic. Big, fresh, pine, pine, pine. Have I mentioned pine? Almost a touch of lemon... very light though. There is the slightest sense of some light malt.... But I mean real light. 
Very interesting. You can easily detect the higher ABV. Some light mint. Pine resin..
Moment of sweetness in the middle, but it then is slammed away from the hops. If you are not a hop head... just stay away. Good thing I'm a lifetime member of that club.
Some citrus, but this is really about the pine to me. Lingering hop bitterness does not begin to describe the finish. Touch of honey.
Mouth feel is medium bodied, just under sticky and definitely a lot of hop resin/oil....
My God, this beer packs a punch. Drink multiple at your own risk...
A very, very good beer. Bordering on classic. I think I liked Pliny the Elder better.

4.22/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a growler courtesy of tzanio. HUGE thanks!! This guy went out of his way to send me a growler, because he felt he shafted me on our last trade, which he did not. Mega-karma his way!!
Poured this into my brand new snifter (what better way to break it in). Pours a beautiful orange/gold with a sticky, frothy white head on top. Decent amount of carbonation rising up. The webbing on this clings to the glass edge for dear life. Perfect sip rings follow. 
This is the best smelling beer I have ever dipped my nose into! Wonderful mixture of flowers, grapefruit, pine forest, and alcohol. Other beers attempt this scent, but fall way short. I wanted to bathe myself in this it smelled so good. 
Mouthfeel was creamy, yet still held a nice mellow crispness that I like in my DIPAs. This beer had a high warming quality as I sipped and sipped. Flavor was strong citrus smack smothered in booziness. I could sense the alcohol very much so in this beer. This hindered my drinkability, as I could only drink one glass of this. Curse my feeble palate!! 
Besides the high boozy quality in this one, this is near perfect. I'm glad I saved some for the next couple of nights. And I'm glad I had an opportunity to try this. Thanks again, Tzanio! 1,247 charactersOnenote81, Feb 18, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Jasonm for sharing this!
A- Body is a minimally translucent bright amber/orange color. Pours with about a 1/2 finger white foamy head that eventually subsides to a nice thick collar.
S- Absolutely heavenly. Bright juicy grapefruit and citrus are the main character and it has a balance of a slightly sharp piny character. 
T- Wonderful. A big bright kick of juicy citrus and sharp pine flavors come through first with equal strength. A sweet malt provides the backbone for this and is completely overshadowed-but still detectable. The pine intensifies for the finish keeping the intensity of this brew up. What lingers is a slight alcohol heat and a medium strength residual rind bitterness. 
M- Well carbonated. Medium weight oily body. The oiliness is wonderful but a bit of alcohol astringency can be detected also.
D- This is an absolutely wonderful DIPA that I thought I would never get the opportunity to try. Its an intense experience that goes right to the top without going over the top (as many Hop-bombs due). Its just barely kept in check. 1,071 charactersPittBeerGirl, Feb 18, 2009

A - Apricot in color, and very transparent. 
S - incredible and my favorite part of this beer. pine, spruce, and lots of vitamin c. 
T - The balance of this beer is quite an achievement. delicious hop goodness. I can for sure taste the elder in there. slight alcohol burn on the very back of the throat but very well hidden...actually amazingly well hidden...it was very hard to notice.
M - light and well carbonated. 
D - Very drinkable, you can get through one fast. But after two, I'd much rather move onto a pale ale. If it was availabe all the time, not sure I would seek it out. 
Perhaps a over hyped, but this is due to its rarity and it's unique Triple IPA status. I prefer other Big IPAs but this is an amazingly well crafted beer. I can now say I tried it, and very much enjoyed it, but I will go for something else at any bar with rotating taps...actually, I would order it again. 918 charactersmykie73, Feb 18, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewpub. Served in a 10 oz glass.
Consumed on 2/2/09 (opening day for PTY at the brewpub).
A-Beautiful orangish yellow color. The beer looks as if it is glowing in the glass. Not a ton of head. Some lacing is left in the glass.
S-Resinous pine smell wallops the nose. Lots of citrus in here also. Smells incredible.
T-All of that pine hits up front with the citrus tones. Definite sweetness is found. Some alcohol ca be detected but is still well balanced.
M-Tongue gets coated with oily hop resin. Stickiness lingers. You know this thing is thick.
D-So good yet so dangerous. If you are drinking this save it for last or stick to it. 30 ounces in a session has been my limit.
This stuff keeps getting better. The 09 batch was insane. After drinking it at the pub and going through 2 growler fills, I would say I got my share this year. Would be perfect if it was released once every 3 or 4 months. It's always nice to have a special beer to look forward to drinking. 987 charactersmjl21, Feb 17, 2009

A - light orange, with a thin, wispy head. Sticky lacing left all the way down.
S - Holy hop explosion! A potent menagerie of pine, grass, grapefruit, and tangerine. The perfect blend of all things hoppy.
T - In the words of my cousin, "it kicks your mouth's ass!" Major juicy hoppiness assaults the palate, overwhelming everything you've tasted in the last year. A bit of toasty breadyness and caramel sweetness prevent total imbalance.
M - Surprisingly light bodied, with fine, smooth carbonation.
D - Incredibly high for an 11% DIPA. I'd drink the whole keg myself if it wouldn't kill me.
Unbelievable. Worth any and all hype that surrounds it. Pray it gets into bottles next year. 721 characters0110x011, Feb 17, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sampled from a growler in my Double Mountain tulip pint glass.
A - RR has a pretty outstanding growler. I really thought a genie was going to come out. The beer itself is golden and quite clear with a thick white head and nice lacing. 
S - Wonderful floral and citrusy hops. It was everything I expected from RR.
T - Loads of hop presence. It starts with a strong attack of hops oils and rich hop flavor but a citrusy bitterness increases over time. The alcohol is always lurking in the background but the hops keep it at bay (until the next morning). I had high expectations for this one and it certainly lived up to them.
M - Good consistency with an almost oily quality that makes it slide right down. Nice carbonation with a moderate level of very fine bubbles.
D - A powerful and compelling beer. I found it comparable to Hop Slam yet very unique. And all of this from a growler shipped across the country. I can only imagine how good it is straight out of the tap. 975 charactersGJ40, Feb 17, 2009
3.44/5  rDev -26.3%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Thanks to a hot tip, I got to enjoy a couple of the first glasses poured at the Horse Brass Pub. Served in a small nonic glass.
Pours bright and light golden orange with an almost pure white head. The head is ~3/4 of a finger, and with some gentle swirling lingers pretty well considering the ABV. A little bit of lacing is teased, but drips back in.
Loads of pine and grapefruit aromas, plenty of sweeter tangerine, peach(?) and floral notes, with quite a bit of alcohol weaving through it all. I can only imagine how great this would smell in a big snifter. Served in a nonic glass is no way to show it off, though. Really had to dig in there to enjoy the bouquet, literally getting my nose wet a couple of times.
There's not much of the sweet fruitiness I was excpecting based on the smell, but there's a ton of pine and grapefruit. The balancing sweetness tastes not of caramel or even light malt, but rather like simple syrup. Odd- it doesn't complement the bitterness very well. As it warms, the alcohol becomes increasingly pronounced and distracting. Pronounced alcohol burn as it warms up. Booziness aside, it's not as big and aggressive as I expected (I definitely prefer the Elder). 
Mouthfeel is decent. There's a slick/oily quality that, in combo with gentle carbonation, smooths out the substantial ABV. However, it doesn't disguise a distracting sugary stickiness left on the palate in the finish (sticky hops= good, sticky sugar= bad). Not nearly as raw and angry as expected from a beer with this much hops.
Drinkability is OK, but not great for me based on the sugary stickiness, weird sweetness(tasted at times like straight simple syrup instead of light malt) and, to a lesser degree, the alcohol burn. 
Overall impression: Glad I got a chance to give it a try without promising my firstborn for a growler trade. Intense and pretty enjoyable, but doesn't live up to mystique (and isn't even the best DIPA from Russian River). 1,951 charactersPDXHops, Feb 17, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wonderful. It's chock full of hop flavor. I've had a number of DIPAs, and this beer expresses hop flavor better than any beer that I've ever tasted.
I'm currently tasting this beer against Pliny the Elder and Blind Pig. It's an interesting comparison, but the flavor profiles are quite similar. Pliny the Younger tastes a lot like Pliny the Elder, just as Blind Pig tastes like Pliny the Elder. Each beer steps up the strength and intensity of hop flavor. Blind Pig to Pliny the Elder is a smaller step than Elder to Younger but not substantially so.
Hops are the star in the flavor department. They are citric, piny and very floral. The citrus is grapefruit, orange and tangerine mixed with pineapple. The pine is dark and resiny, like sap. I don't know flowers well enough to identify the floral aspect beyond wonderful wildflowers. 
There is a strong malt backbone that allows this much hop flavor to come through. Is this beer balanced? I would say so, but the malt does not express the same complexity and assertiveness of the hops. That is not to say the malt isn't strong or is bad. The malt is actually wonderful. It's like a caramel cookie swirled into a fine hop tea.
The alcohol is in this beer is exceptionally well-hidden. I'm giving this beer a perfect score, in part, because I can't imagine a way that this beer could be differ and be better for it. I say that because I can't imagine this beer without the same strength. I guess the alcohol is present, but it's not unpleasant in any way.
The color is very close to Elder and Blind Pig, which is to say golden-amber and wonderful. The aroma is very hoppy, with the flavors as previously described. The feel is also exceptional, almost oily with hop essence. Sorry, just trying to get through the other categories.
I should probably end this as I just finished my second glass out of the growler (not to mention some Blind Pig and Elder), and I can certainly feel it. It's a great beer. Try it if you can. I hope that they start bottling it. I can't imagine that they couldn't turn a profit on bottles. I know it's expensive to produce, but you can charge a pretty penny nowadays for a bottle of beer. Anyway, great beer. 2,193 characterspopery, Feb 17, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I finally got to try the elusive Younger of the Plineys. 
I walked into a jam packed Toronado on Friday the 13th, and found about 10 Russian River beers on tap... YES! I started with this one, and it turned out that it was a hell of a way to start the night.
Pours a bright gold color, quite clear, with a nice off white head.
Aromas are off the charts. There is a huge blast of pineapple, maybe the most I have ever noticed in a beer. Also some really sticky resins and pine. This smells like a glass full of smashed fresh hops.
Taste follows along the with the aromas, and is big. Lots of pineapple, fresh resins, pine, and other giant hop flavors. The malts are there, and they provide a nice thick slightly sweet creamy backdrop. This is easily the biggest hop bomb I have ever had. But it's not just a bomb, it's an expertly balanced and put together beer. It's just really BIG.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Big, thick, and full... just like the smell and taste.
Drinkability is quite good. But is still this beer only "fault". (I say that rather loosely) After this one, it was hard to drink anything else, or much more. I had a couple of other beers, but not only did they pale it comparison, but they were about all I could handle. I am partly to blame by starting with this one. But I didn't want to wait when I saw this on the Toronado's beer board. 
Really... an unbelievably hoppy beer. And I am so glad I got to try it, and I'll be excited to get this on a more constant basis next year. But all in all? I think I like the older Pliney a tad bit better than this. And that's only because the Elder get's a 5 on drinkability, and this one is pretty much a one and done. But, a hell of a "one" this is. 1,713 charactersflexabull, Feb 16, 2009

http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/13600/?view=beerfly
Appearance: Very clear/transparent yellow. A little on the golden orange side. With a mildly sized fluffy white head.
Smell: HUGE amounts of citris/grapefruit and hops.
Taste: Similar to nose. The grapefruit and hops in this one are outstanding and very present. Very bitter as a double IPA should be. But it doesn't totally dominate like some Double IPAs. It has a good balance with a sweet malt taste, and little pine flavor as well. Alcohol is well hidden and not boozy by any means.
Mouthfeel: Nice and crisp. Perfect balance of carbonation and overall mouthfeel. Not thin by any means, but also not too heavy. It's just right. Medium all around.
Drinkability: I wanted more of this one, but at 11% and having to drive, one is plenty. It's very smooth and tasty though. Wish I had a designated driver.
Overall: Fine example of a double IPA. Maybe a little more malt and I would say it was perfectly balanced. But I don't think a double IPA should be. Fantastic one that deserves all the hype. 1,107 charactersmikedashg, Feb 16, 2009

Enjoyed at the Brewery on the opening day 09.
Poured unfortunately in a 10oz glass..I need More
Drinkability...I could live on a Pliny I.V.
Golden amber in color it falls in a very in between stage that I don't think is my favorite. Those at the bar are questioning wether or not it has been drunk already.
Good constant flow of carbonation without disturbing the head. It flows up directly from the bootom of the glass and sits just below the head.
Smell...well, HOPS!!!! The Elder on crack.
T- stands for "Takes my breath away". Woody, lots of earthen flavor, slightly fruity and of course citrus.
Mouthfeel is good and the carbonation builds the after kick of hops very well. Fakes some spice then bobs and weaves into a barrel of hops.
I love this beer but deffinately not for the Young beer drinker, regardless of the name.
Young IPA'ers stay away for a while. You will regret how much you'll love it. 925 charactersmacktbone, Feb 15, 2009

Appearance: I wonderful golden color, with a very night tight white head that was about an inch thick. It laced all the way down.
Smell: This beer was so pungent! It smelled of those wonderful little hop flowers and lots of them! First comes the malty sweetness, like caramel and the hops come in, which smelled like if you blended a grapefruit and a pine tree together.
Taste: Tasted just how it smelled, tasted as if you blended grapefruit and pine needles together. It had a wonderful sweet caramel malty taste and the hops come running in, it was so wonderfully bitter! Following this wonderful parade was a nice alcohol hotness. The aftertaste was my favorite part of this beer, the hops just got stuck all over my mouth and it was such a great experience.
Mouthfeel: This beer sat on my palette just so amazing. It was so thick and sticky with hops! You could chew this beer!
Drinkability: Even though this beer was very high in alcohol and was so thick and sticky, this beer was very drinkable, it was scary easy to drink. What an amazing beer!
I thought that i total lost my chance to try this beer, but i got so lucky and was a the right place at the right time and got the the first pour off the freshly tapped keg. I thought that this beer was all hype, but i was so wrong! This beer was AMAZING! 1,507 characterswalows, Feb 15, 2009

A sloppy pour from the funky growler produced a crystal clear, dark yellow body with a huge , pillowy, snow-white head. 
There are not any IIPA's with an aroma this strong. Noticeable right after popping the growler. Resiny, piney and citrusy. Tons of tangerine, orange, pineapple on the nose. I could seriously just smell this beer all day long. Flavor is enormous. TOns of hops! Not too much in the malt department to mellow it out, but it remains extremely well balanced. This beer punishes your tongue, but my tongue begs for more! Slick, oily mouthfeel that completely coats your mouth. At 11% this beer is dangerously drinkable.

pours straight up copper with thick white head and leaves an INCREDIBLE lacing pattern behind. 
scent is actually more muted than i expected, VERY citrus with grapefruit being dominant. 
taste is so balanced for what this is. smooth hop flavor that is bitter like a red grapefruit concentrate. the carbonation quickly releases the flavors. starts out smooth and ends with a sharp bitterness that quickly fades into red grapefruit. i even caught what appeared to be white pepper for a few seconds. 
very full bodied, thick, oily, with a medium to moderate carbonation
this is VERY drinkable however at 11%, be wary!

4.22/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5With CrellMoset's before mine, it would make this #200 on here. Shared with Chris and dkachur with Clare. 
A: It is an pretty clean amber. Nice creamy head that has great retention, and a nice spotting of lace. 
S: A fruity and floral aroma - peach, pear, clementines. A sweet citrus scent and a scent similar to that in a florists shop. 
T: Fruity sweetness is not as apparent in the flavour. It's a lot more piney on the palate, with a soft fruit peel flavour. Very little alcohol, quite smooth despite the hefty bitterness. 
M + D: Body is medium and slightly tacky. A tasty beer, though admittedly I prefer the Elder, and found the scent to be more attractive than the flavour. I do look forward to another opportunity to drink it. 739 charactersProteus93, Feb 14, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Growler courtesy of urwatuh8 - many, many thanks for perhaps my #1 want. Split several ways w/ dkachur, proteus93, and one other friend (who has just begun to appreciate DIPAs - beeradvocacy at work!!).
Appearance: Pours a golden bronze body, gorgeously crisp and clear, with occasional sparse, slow, medium-sized carbonation. The head on this one is very attractive - it's a creamy snow-white, an initial finger-and-a-half high, and has above average retention. It in fact never really fades beyond a healthy thick dusting of snow and a firm, spongy collar. The lacing is similarly attractive, strewing waves and chunks of foamy, occasionally glittery lace all over the place. 
Aroma: Very reminiscent of HopSlam, actually. It's incredibly citrusy and fruity - definite apricot, pineapple, strawberries, peach, white grapefruit, blood oranges all make themselves known throughout the course of the sip. It's also fantastically sweet, with notes of honey, tons of pale, saccharine sweetness. The loss of half a point is due to - upon intense, intense inspection - the emergence of a faint whiff of ethanol, light and spicy, and though not imbalanced with the other notes. This one's borderline 4.0, IMO, if only because I get almost the same thing out of HopSlam, with no alcohol there. 
Taste: Massive bitterness up front and throughout, though it's a very soft, gentle, well-balanced bitterness. It melds fantastically well with the intense, large, biting citrus, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit, tons of tropical fruits, and backed up by a big, bold, simplistically sweet malt backbone. 
Mouthfeel: Wonderfully smooth and even, with a moderate, subtle carbonation, a surprisingly moderately-viscous body - i.e., I would expect it to be a lot thicker given the amount of malt that had to be pumped into this one - gentle, and subtle, pleasant, nice. 
Drinkability: I actually liked the Pliny the Elder better, I do believe, though they're really, truly very different brews. The Elder seems to be a far less balanced brew, actually, with a far more herbal, minty, hop-forward nose than this brew. This one's balanced, but bigger all-around, and (in my personal opinion), the sum of its parts is just a little less overall than the Elder. That's not to say this isn't a fantastic beer - it's stellar, amazing, well-crafted. If you like balanced beer and HUGE beers, this one's for you - it's big, tasty, aromatic, well in-proportion with itself, and just all around amazing. I give many, many thanks to urwatuh8 for the growler of this fantastic brew. As an aside, the Russian River growlers are super-awesome sexy - sort of low to the ground, squat, maybe like a Russian babushka? Regardless, if I lived in Cali, I'd move into RR for this one. As it stands, I'll likely only try it once, and was very, very glad to do so. 2,828 charactersCrellMoset, Feb 14, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42009 version. I've had this year's version a couple times, at Beachwood BBQ and Verdugo Bar. The hop aroma is much more pungnet in the nose than I remember, and I can taste a smoother, more balanced beer in this year's version. Some caramel and bready notes emerge alongside with the intense, puckering hops, and it's slightly cleaner too. Overall, I like 2009's version a little more than the 2008 version, and the latter was pretty awesome as well.
2/13/08 (4.5/4.5/5/5/4.5)
I was fortunate to hear this beer would be on tap at Hollingshead's this week. I raced over this afternoon and grabbed a 12 ounce sample, which was poured into a goblet. On to the beer:
The beer glows a deep orange color. Aroma was very hoppy, lots of metallic smelling hops at first, but it mellowed out to be sweeter as it warmed. My first impression on this beer was that it isn't as "intense" as one might think. Extremely smooth and syrupy thick on the palate. All I could think of was hop juice, yet still has a nice balance to it. The long lingering flavor of hops comes to no surprise. 
What else? If you find this, savor the flavor, and enjoy! 1,133 charactersDoubleJ, Feb 13, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Half pint at Russian River on 02.06.09. Board behind bar listed PiY as 10.5% with GOBS under the I.B.U. One of the most unique colors of beer I have ever seen. No head in sight and the glass was glowing orange. All I could do was stare for a few minutes. While doing this, I could smell Younger from a foot away. Crazy giant boozy grapefruit whiffs. Really. Chewy as hell. Grapefruit taffy. Cascade spearmint jolly rancher. Enormous whopper of a DIPA. Exceptionally drinkable for the size. Had a tulip of Younger Sunday night @ Toronado and could have had 6 more. But what's the point? This beer is the shit. 608 charactersRustyDiamond, Feb 13, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Pours a super bright, crystal clear golden orange with a nice white head. Not too much in the lacing area though the only thing holding it back.
S- As soon as I popped the growler top of this one I could smell it. Plenty of hops here and that's what I like piney and grapefruit all over the place here. A touch of sweet malts but the hops rule this one.
T- Hops again rule this one. Hops are very consistent through out the drink and its incredibly balanced. The alcohol is hidden very well.
M- Medium in body and perfect carbonation. This one feels well perfect.
D- Highly recommended. I love this beer and wish I could get it more often. Clearly worth the hype and very solid. 
Thanks again Jason!!! 709 charactersnrbw23, Feb 13, 2009

Current batch is drier than the last batch with less sweetness apparent from the malt. Citrusy and resiny hops just dance on your tongue with a beautifully filling yet light malt profile. This does live up to the hype. Better than last year as well. I'm loving this. So go, get yourself a pint of this beautiful beer. 360 charactersrallison, Feb 13, 2009
4.58/5  rDev -1.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got to have a pint of this one. On tap at Pizza Port San Clemente.
Appearance is beautiful. Nice creamy looking head. Beautiful color and clear as a bell. the lacing sticks to the glass almost so much you can't see through the glass.
Smell is awesome. Lots of pine sents and awesome hop aroma. Although I think the bottle of Elder I poured the other day had more hop aroma than the younger.
Taste is great. Nice and malty. The malts are wonderful. The hops and malts balance so well. But I wish there was as much hop flavour as the elder I have had. Call me spoiled or picky since I have access to these wonderful beers but I kind of like elder better because of the hop flavour and aroma. The malts on the younger are very nice though.
Mouthfeel is perfect. I love the carbonation to malt ratio. Perfect for the style.
Drinkability is really high but after one on an empty stomach, I'm pretty buzzed. But I'm going to drink at least 3 more before the night is over. Good thing my pizza came. 1,005 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Feb 13, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to urwatuh8 for the growler.
Pours a clear amber color with two fingers of foamy white head.
Scent of huge piny hops, grapefruit, citrus, honey and a bit of caramel. Extremely hoppy, but it doesn't matter, this stuff smells so damn good.
Taste is very hoppy, lots of grapefruit and citrus, honey, and a hint of caramel, there is a hint of alcohol, but nothing that would suggest 11%. Finishes with a lasting flavor of delicious hops. One of the few 'Holy fuck' beers I've had, worth the price, a growler was not enough, I must have more.
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a good bite from the carbonation. 620 characterspaco1029384756, Feb 13, 2009
4.48/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally got my hands on this one. Called Father's Office, found out it was finally in, and practically threw the lady in the car and raced off. I was not about to miss this. 
Appearance - Light orangish. I definitely got the "it glows" thing. It was very nice and clear, with 1-2 inches of whispy head that settled down in a couple minutes. Not a super rich color, but very bright and nice.
Smell - Plenty of hops. Some real pine and grapefruit. Also some lemon/citrus. There's also a little bit of a malt back behind all those hops. Very nice and balanced, but no explosion.
Taste - Very, very balanced. There's that hoppy citrusness, but also some real malt hanging around. There's a bready-ness that I did not see coming. Not too astringent, and the alcohol is nowhere to be seen. That said, the aftertaste is a little tough, a sharp bitterness that sort of clings. Overall, it was one of the more balanced DIPA's you'll find.
Mouthfeel - Really great. Very crisp, not syrupy at all. Just about perfection.
Drinkability - Lethal. Definitely went down faster than planned, although it does begin to accumulate a little. Still, with such a high abv it's incredibly smooth. Even the lady, not a big fan of hops, thought that this one was very, very drinkable. That about says it all.
A very nice beer. Great even. Of course, there was no way it could live up to the hype. I'm not sure anything could. It was very, very drinkable. Still, it seemed a little thin? There was a level it did not quite go, but I think that's how it ends up being so balanced. I'm really glad I tried this one, and I really admire the craftsmanship. One of the better DIPA's you're going to get anywhere.
If you ever see it on tap, pounce! That said, your life can complete without ever having tried it. I'm a fan, definitely. 1,810 characterscallmescraps, Feb 12, 2009

A - Three fingers of creamy-white foam, with incredible retention and gorgeous lacing. Semi-transparent gold, with tiny bubbles slowly & lazily rising upwards. This is the standard by which DIPAs are measured.
S - Huge, complex bouquet of flavors - mossy pine, fresh-cut grass, tangerine, Braeburn apple, grapefruit, and a touch of pineapple. Mild touch of malt in the background, but this is a huge hopbomb.
T - Incredible balance - great fresh hoppiness and sweet tropical fruit flavors, but also more malt than the smell lets on. Sweet and hoppy aftertaste that keeps me reaching for the glass. Only the tiniest hint of the 11% ABV.
M - Medium viscosity, reasonable carbonation. Smooth and creamy, with just a touch of tingling. Leaves a sticky resinous feeling after swallowing. Not sure what else I can ask for in a DIPA.
D - This is the most drinkable 11% beer I've ever had. The only thing that would keep me from filling up my glass is passing out.
This is incredible stuff - it takes all the things I love about Pliny the Elder but to the nth degree. This is a must try for all lovers of beer. 1,225 charactersMasterSki, Feb 12, 2009

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a tap into a 4 ounce taster glass...Finally had my chance to taste The Younger, and oh my GOD, what a day to remember. First the sample, then meeting Vinnie...the brewer himself.
This ale poured an amber color with a nice thick white head. Like the Elder, this ale was very clear and clean with no sediment at all.
The smell was of fresh hops...citrusy and crisp. One word describes the taste...PHENOMENAL!!! Like the Elder, this ale hides its alcohol content very well and has the perfect balance of malts and hops. I wanted to ask Vinnie how he does it, but refrained. At 10.75% I thought this would be tougher to drink, but I was wrong. It's definitely not one to chug, but to savor, for this is one ale that people will remember for years to come. 764 charactershophead247, Feb 11, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Scott (swnicholson) for scoring a growler of this for me. Poured from a cool looking growler into my Corsedonk tulip glass.
A- Pours a beautiful golden amber that just seems to have a glowing aura around it. Visibility is crystal clear and produces a huge three fingers width of white head that lasts throughout consumption.
S- Huge scents of piney hops infiltrate the nostrils. The aroma is just so clean it seems to cut through the air. There is a subtle citrus sweetness that attempts to balance the piney aroma, but to no avail.
T- Piney hops assault the tongue and hold it captive. As the beer warms up, the piney taste becomes less aggressive, allowing for the citrus flavors to kick in. 
M- Clean, carbonated and medium bodied. Can't ask for much more in a DIPA.
D- After one glass of this, I was definitely feeling the effects. There is also a warming sensation that comes with this one. 
Overall, an absolutely fantastic DIPA that it truly worthy of its praise. Younger is bigger and bolder than Elder, giving off a far more piney taste. As such, it is a beer that I would go out of the way for to drink on a special occasion. However, I don't think I would be able to drink this on a daily basis, unlike Elder. If you have the opportunity, definitely try this one. 1,295 charactersrhinos00, Feb 11, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I have waited over a year since I moved to the Bay area to have this beer and I was at Toronado the day they received the kegs. RR delivers on Thursdays to Toronado btw...might be good to know from time to time.
Needless to say I was trembling with anticipation and arrived a little before my drinking and brewing buddy so I couldn't order one by myself quite yet so I decided to warm my palate with a Blind Pig. 
When the Younger arrived I was smitten by the smell, intense resinous hops, grapefruit, orange, grass, pine resin and some real dank chronic. The onslaught of hops is smoothed out by a richness of malts, a tiny bit of caramel and toffee with cream. It is intense alright and the alcohol is definitely there, but it is not overpowering. A little bit like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand, definitely there but you can easily forget it is...at least after a few glasses. 
Taste-wise I was let down a little, as good as it is, there are still some things that pull it down from a perfect score. It is a little brutish and lacking elegance, but perhaps I am crazy for saying that, but I kept thinking that I may actually like the Elder better. It was also slightly under-carbonated for my taste. 
All in all it is a World-class beer, probably like nothing you've ever had before so I highly recommend trying it. If I had my way I would start the evening with a regular RR IPA which is amazing, move on to Blind Pig, Pliny The Elder and finishing off with Pliny The Younger. That encompasses all the foreplay, action and climax a hophead could ever wish for.
I stayed at Toronado for 5 hours and can safely say I have not been THAT hung over for years...I was hyperventilating until noon the next day. Great stuff!!!
OK, now I've had it 2 years in a row and I revised my review. It is fantastic, better the second year. Enough said. 1,855 charactersmj001jk, Feb 10, 2009
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5HUGE thanks goes out to bifrostguard for this and his FIRST trade! Delivered on my doorstep on Saturday 2/7/2009 and shared with pwoods (&lt;-- this guys owes me a shit ton! Just kidding), DrewOSU and Ftownthrowdown.
Poured from the flip-top Russian River growler into my traditional pint glass at around 40-45 degrees. Pours a clear, brass orange with an average tan head. Nice sticky lacing seen rolling up the edge of my glass. White, creamy halo of foam seen, as well.
You can smell this beer from the neighboring room! The nose on this beer is so intense. Huge, pounding of floral hops, ammonia (likely from the simcoe hops), sweet malts, orange citrus, grapefruit, grass, pepper, earth all mixed around a big slap of alcohol - basically the entire spectrum of hops all over the nose - holy shit, world class.
This is a MASSIVE freggin' beer! Starting on the drink was a huge wave of bittering hops. Medium bodied and FULL flavored. Finishes with a sweet, at time creamy finish. Waxiness on my tongue. This is a big, extremely tasty beer. Pine on the aftertaste lingers in my mouth. My palate is official shot for the remainder of the night. Soo much going on here. A plethora of hops and lightly balanced, semi-sweet malts, masterfully blended. Crisp and very dry, yet waxy finish. It's almost like a super-hopped strong ale.
Wow...
A million thanks go out to bifrostguard again - cheers! 1,399 charactersbeachbum1975, Feb 10, 2009

Poured from a growler.
Pours a very nice amber, gold in color. Completely clear and effervescent. A fairly good amount of frothy head forming on the pour. Mostly around the perimeter of the glass, but it's there. Smell is all hops. All glorious in their splendor. Obnoxious hops. Oily, resinous, floral, sticky, juicy. Heavenly. The type of hops that kick in your front door and make themselves at home and there ain't nothing you can do about it.
Taste is wonderful, powerful hops. I had to apologize to my mouth and tongue after drinking this. It was a full onslaught and both sides of my tongue were numbing. 
Besides the full hoppy onslaught, this is a very clean and enjoyable beer. Very crisp with a wonderful mouthfeel. 
The alcohol is a bit tough to hide, so you can notice it a bit in the flavor and in the warming heat in your nostrils.
Incredible, one of a kind beer. Very glad to have had the opportunity. I've had plenty of elder since it's bottling, and I have to go against the grain and say that I like the Younger infinitely better, hands down. 1,175 charactersFtownThrowDown, Feb 10, 2009

A: Pours clear golden color with a moderate white head.
S: Very fresh citrus, pine, and floral hop notes. Really good smell to this.
T: Again, the citrus, pine, and floral hop qualities dominate the taste, but are somewhat balanced with the malts. Still an out-of-control hop bomb, but far better than most, and probably the best California IPA I've had.
M: Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Not too heavy, not too light, and the carbonation is perfect.
D: High ABV and out of control hops hamper drinkability, but this is very good. 570 characterswaltonc, Feb 10, 2009

Pours a nice clear yellowy orange with a stark white head that lingers forever and leaves great lacing. A very slight redness, this one doesn't quite glow, but tries as hard as it can. Carbonation stream rises from the etching in the bottom of my corsendonk goblet.
Nose is pure hops. Big West Coast hop resins waft out of the glass. A nice malty backbone is noticeable in the smell, but man o man this one just reeks of ooey gooey stanky ass hop resin. Grapefruit and pine abound, some slight perfume as well. Smells like this is going to be a major palate thrasher.
Wow. This is a fine fine D(T)IPA. Taste begins slightly mild, with good hop flavor. The sweetness from the malt backbone comes on early, and makes the taste feel a slight bit slick in the beginning. Through the middle of the taste, the hops start to take ahold of the reigns and begin to take names. Grapefruit, pine, and other citrus explode as the finish approaches. Said finish yields some fierce bitterness, but it is kept in check and balanced perfectly with a slight sweetness that makes its return here. Dry finish precedes the aftertaste that lingers of hop resin and citrus.
Mouthfeel is solid here. Near perfect viscosity, not too thick and soupy, but certainly not thin. If anything it is every so slightly undercarbonated, but when I say ever so slightly, I mean BARELY. Dry finish is spectacular without making one parched. 
Drinkability is fairly unbeleivable here. You can feel the warming sensation when it begins to settle in your stomach, but there is next to no alcohol burn here, and this one goes down dangerously easy.
Overall, this is certainly one of the best DIPAs to be found on the planet. Amazingly well put together, quite balanced, and just plain delicious. If you are a hophead you MUST seek out this beer. It is one that you do not want to miss. If you never have this in your lifetime, and you die and go to heaven, as soon as they pour you one, as this will surely be on tap there, you will realize what you were missing your entire life on earth, and you will curse long and loud, maybe even punch a monk or two, drop kick a couple cherubs, and you will be kicked out and sent to hell. 
So don't screw up and miss out on this. 
I'm not saying this is the best DIPA on the planet, but it should certainly be in the discussion. I can count those that would rival it on one hand, and can think of none that surely beat it. An amazing beer. 2,533 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Feb 10, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Sonoma Wine Exchange (Wine Exchange of Sonoma?). Pours a yellow to orange and transparent, with a nice white head. Sticky, sticky lacing. Clear and gleaming in the light. Smells very hoppy, citrusy, but also very heavy on the alcohol. Some pine notes. Flavor is quite good. Very bitter, very hoppy. Citrus hops dominate, but again there's a pine sap presence too. Hops blow out my taste buds pretty early on. More of a malt profile than the Elder and definitely a more prominent alcohol presence too. The massive hops and alcohol don;t really work to its benefit, imo. Elder is a great beer because of how it manages to cram all that good stuff in and not be overwhelming, while Younger IS overwhelming. Still, its very tasty, just more on the overly aggressive side of things. Full bodied, but also a bit syrupy. Drinks well, but again, i prefer the elder. 871 charactersaforbes10, Feb 09, 2009

m - medium-bodied, full mouthfeel relative to other DIPAs, not overly dry on the palate
d - pretty dangerously drinkable for an 11% DIPA, not too harsh on the palate, not one dimensional, so it stays interesting

4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My 100th review! WOW! And the perfect beer to enjoy on such an occasion. I had the chance to enjoy this beer twice. Once on 2/6/09 at Hollingshead in Orange, and yesterday (2/10/09) at Beachwood BBQ. This a combination review from both tastings. 
A: Poured into a Chimay glass, PTY boasted a robust white and frothy two-finger head. The liquid sitting beneath this extremely frothy beast comprised of deep and dark golden-copper hues along with shades of orange. Similar to PTE, but not as murky and chewy looking. It also gave off that "clean and crisp" appeal that every Double and Triple IPA should have. 
S: Intense piney and tree like smells that were balanced off by the sweet malts. There was also a definite alcohol bite from the initial whiff as well.
T: For as robust and potent, the hops and malts balanced out each other out in complete harmony. Hop bitterness was strong, but not overwhelming, and seemed to stay pretty consistent throughout the whole sip. Alcohol was not noticeable, but not hot. 
M: Smooth carbonation, medium to full-body, a numbing affect on the palate from hop bitterness.
D: Alcohol is extremely well hidden, to the point that I might think this a regular IPA! A hop bomb that is well balanced between both pines and malts, makes this very enjoyable for just about any time of the year.
Overall: WOW! This beer didn't disappoint at all. It deserves a spot on my top 5 beers I've ever had and one that is well worth seeking. Now that I have said that, I do believe that Pliny the Elder (when fresh) is on par with the Younger. So, if you are unable to get your hands on this, just grab an Elder, put a whole bag of hop pellets in your mouth and drink...then you'll know what PTY tastes like. LOL. Well, maybe not quite like that, but you get the point. A must try. Cheers! 1,813 charactersOlieIPA, Feb 07, 2009

A: Beautiful orange/amber with a nice thick, creamy-looking head. Nice lacing on the glass.
S: Exceptional smell of citrus and piney like hops. The freshness is amazing. Almost an earthy component to it. 
T/M: As expected, massive amounts of citrus & piney hops. Mouthfeel is unexpectedly creamy. Despite how over-the-top this beer is, it's very well-balanced. There's none of that stinging bitterness on the finish that ruins other big IPAs for me (many of the San Diego style brews). Overall, I'm impressed.
D: I had four in one sitting. I don't remember much else of the evening. 
So, is it worth all the hype? Maybe. A remarkably well-made beer that's probably the best IPA I've ever had. At the same time, I probably wouldn't be driving all of the country to try it (which is what I get the impression some do). 969 charactersabfraser, Feb 07, 2009

S - I can understand why this was named after Pliny the Elder - the aroma profile is almost identical - just way more floral.
T - Alcohol is very prominent followed by a STONG FLORAL hop presence a bit of grapefruit. Unlike Elder there is no emphasis on the malt.
M - Creamy and smooth if the alcohol didn't have such a strong presence this would be highly drinkable
D - the strong alcohol burn is a let down
People are going hog wild over this beer but it's definitely not the best double / triple IPA I have ever had. 606 charactersxhcadamx, Feb 07, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3on tap at the Toronado SF.
pours a dramatic orange/amber with a creamy one finger head. the head dissipates rather quickly, but there is some ok lacing left in the glass.
smell is the expected citric and piney hops, with a bit of grass and earthiness in the back.
the taste is rather unexpected, however, as I was anticipating an amped-up version of the Elder. the immediate impression is of pine, but that quickly gives way to a really nice spice, like some peppery greens, and black tea. the citric notes from the nose are barely present, but there is a nice floral character at the end, with a pleasant bitterness in the finish. malts do not register too much except as a faint sweetness in the memory.
mouthfeel is medium-full, without too much carbonation, a little sticky in the finish.
overall this is a heavenly tasting beer, but the ABV really sneaks up on you. I was aiming to have a few but had to quit after one.
definitely worth trying if you can, but the Elder is the more drinkable brew. 1,002 charactersJoshuaCain, Feb 07, 2009

4.28/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Toronado. Poured into a tulip glass.
Beer pours and almost fiery, translucent orange. Small white head disappears almost instantly. Almost glowing appearance.
Hops, hops and hops on the nose. A touch of citrus, some sweetness and some booze.
Not surprisingly, the hops dominate. Hoppy flavor is fantastic. Quite bitter but also some balancing sweetness. Some citrus flavors but everything pales next to the hops.
Mouthfeel is is good. Nice carbonation. There is a lingering bitterness left on the tongue which is very noticeable but also very pleasant.
This is an amazing beer and one I am glad to have tried. However, I feel that in the quest to be huge, it lost some of the subtlety and nuance of the Elder. For my tastes, it is a bit too much. 761 charactersyeastsipper, Feb 06, 2009

I made it to Russian River to partake in the almighty son. Brought to the table with no foam whatsoever. Poured in a 10 oz. glass with a nice caramel/amber color.
Fruit, very hoppy aroma. Awesome smell!
Massive grapefruity taste with hops to no end. No major aftertaste for so many hops. Smooth and silky feel.
Very easy to drink for the high alcohol content. So easy I put back two and was "hopping"...er...hoping for more.
Definitely worth driving an hour and a half to partake in it and look forward to it someday being put in bottles.
Awesome beer and well worth the hype! 615 characterskaseydad, Feb 04, 2009

Color is a hazy, glowing orange, white head, aroma of floral hops, pine, citrus (more citrus in the nose than elder). Taste is similar to smell, full of grapefruit, pine, slightly sweeter than elder, but maybe a bit more in bitterness up front. The 11% is very well hidden, and the brew is balanced to perfection.
It's a shame it's so rare. I'll be going out of my way to get a few pints when it hits beachwood/hollingshead next week... 595 charactersantilogic, Feb 02, 2009

Poured a medium to deeper golden/amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of citrus, oranges, caramel, and pine. Tastes of citrus, pine, caramel, and grapefruit.

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Perfect 5 you say?! Well, I'll let you guys in on a little secret. I cheated a little bit, filling out these scores. Don't tell anybody, though... the truth is, I may have had beers that looked better than Pliny the Younger. (/sarcasm)
Whew.
Now that's over with, let me start the worshipping of this beer. This beer is easily in my top 3 beers I've ever had. I've had great, huge, stinging barley wines laced with wood and whiskey, but no beer comes close to Younger in terms of a big, balanced, delicious beer. This beer may be the best-looking, most easily-drinkable beer above 6% I've ever had. Couple that with a great taste, well, 5.
I've had this on tap at Hollingshead about a half dozen times over the past few months, and it really is a finicky beer. Some kegs Kenny taps seem a bit more stale than others. The pint I had today, though, was godly.
For all the gushing that the Pliny the Elder receives, Younger should get a waterfall. It actually has a pretty different mouth profile than the Elder, but a similar hop bouquet and complexity. For those of you who haven't tried Elder, Younger, or Blind Pig, and love IPA's, try to get your hands on these. The only experience I can compare tasting these beers with was me trying and enjoying my first glass of IPA at the Stone Brewery -- that one Ruination that made me fall in love with the IPA style. Bitterness to hide the alcohol, best served cool (not warm) to enjoy on a hot day, with fruits and malts to balance it all out. I've since moved on from Ruination, but I get to have that falling-in-love experience every time I try one of these great Russian River IPAs.
To start, Younger is a truly different IPA. Most IPA's pour somewhat clear -- Younger is very opaque and almost looks like a Hef or Belgian ale. The head is creamy, but settles down fast.
Smell might not be as complex as Elder, but it has a very different, less pine-y, and more citrus-y and sweeter nose to it. A sign of things to come.
As you take your first sip of Younger, it becomes clearly evident that this is not Elder (which, to me, is the premier DIPA). No, this is something different. To a hophead, it's very creamy, sweet, and yet still bitter and hoppy. To a casual drinker, this beer probably is supremely hopped but bearably so, with a deep taste and great feel. The complexity of the hops underlies the sweet nectary feel around your mouth. It's a pretty strong beer, but it seems Vinnie almost used a hidden alcohol hotness to blend a further dimension into the hops and malts. And that creamy feel just adds even more depth. Mmm. 
Next sip -- wow! This is almost the pinnacle of mouthfeel. A taste so delicious you could swish it around your mouth until it gets warm, or you could gulp down its cool soft feel.
So you take another gulp, and another, and then you go on BA because you aren't really sure why you're feeling buzzed off of 6oz. of a tasty medium-bodied beer. Oh, that's why, it's 11%.
To the negative reviews of Younger here -- I can only assume the keg was stored differently or was from another batch. I had thought Younger didn't age that well kegged, but trying it today on tap, at least 4 months after its February '08 release, changed my mind. This keg tastes as good as the first one I had, and much better than the couple I've had in between. If you like Elder, you'll love Younger. If you're a hophead, you'll love Younger. If you love beer, well, you'll probably love Younger. 
Undoubtedly, the beer that everybody will compare this one to is Pliny the Elder. Younger sacrifices some pine, grapefruit, and bitterness, and replaces it with a milky, creamy, sweeter taste and feel. Highly desirable, in my opinion.
I thought IPA's couldn't get any better than Elder, but after trying both Elder and Younger, Younger wins by a mile. When I talk about loving a Triple IPA, most people look at me and make a bitter face. Younger is not overly bitter, regardless of its IBU. Pliny the Younger sits at the summit of IPA and determines what else is worthy of being its kin.
Now I've fallen into the trap of believing a beer was great just because of its ranking (coughAbysscough), but Younger completed my search for a perfect 10 (or 5) IPA. I've read reviews that praise a certain beer, lifting it above its style, and tried them, thinking, "well, this it a great stout, but i was expecting cotton candy." But for all the hype this beer gets, I think it deserves its ranking. I haven't tried the current #1-3 beers above the #4 Younger, so I can't argue Younger's place, but to see it stand out up there, away from the Belgian ales, Stouts, and Barley Wines, means something to me. 
You might not like it, but I know I do. It's the only beer I've tried that doesn't taste like it holds even half the abv it really has.
IPAs I've had: Lost Abbey 2nd Ann, Stone 10th/11th/Ruination/IPA simcoe hopped, Avery Maharaja, Alesmith, DFH 60/90, Racer 5/X, among many, many more. 4,951 charactersNewSc2, Jun 24, 2008
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sometimes a beer kept in such high regard can falter when actually faced with reality. This beer somehow became even better than the old stories I had heard for years befor having the chance to try it out. 
The same DNA as the "Elder" but richer, velvity, and the best finish I've ever experienced with a beer ever. Aroma is also lifting, needed as the light in color beer is still huge in style and hop weight. Magic hops maybe? There is no other way to explain it. Please please please bottle this beer!!
This tasting note is from O'Briens Pub in San Diego back when this was released in Feb or March. That's how memorable it was. And with the Elder to be bottled very shortly, Pliny "Elder" will finally be available to the masses. For good or bad?! 754 characterspaytoplay, Jun 22, 2008
3.8/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served in a large mouth glass, the head was firm and perched on a nice golden pedistal.
The aroma was like sitting under a Pine tree eating sweet grapefruit, oranges and tangerines. A complimentery blend for the nose. 
Well here is another beer using an abundent amount hops. Are brewers aware of the shortage?
The sweet maltyness is a good balance for the hops used. A clean finishing medium bodied DIPA that won't leave your face turned inside-out.
Following the frame work of just about every other DIPA around this one is full of citrus and pine. There are notes of grass clinging to the piney resign. Sweet grapefruit and moderate carbonation smooth it out pallett for a clean, dry finish at the back of the tounge.
This one is a good find, another notch in the post for Russian River. 794 charactersdbONE, Jun 19, 2008

A: A cloudy golden color. Very hazy with a head that lasts for the duration of the brew. 
S: Hops and malt. Nice sweet smell that lets you know what's to come. 
T: All I need to say is, WOW! The balance between the hops and the malt is exceptional. Great use of them to make this the best brew I have had yet.
M: Nice. 
D: Too easy for an 11% abv brew. I could drink 10 of these if it weren't for the fact I knew about the alcohol contained here. It is masked exceptionally well.
Conclusion: I like this one better than the Elder, but not by much. These are the two best brews I have ever had! Got to try it if you haven't already! Good stuff. 730 charactersJedimaster1, Jun 13, 2008

Brought out in a Chimay Goblet... a beautiful pilsner-y gold with a creamy white head that stuck around to the bitter end.
Aroma is grapefruit and tangerine with hints of sticky pine. What is sticky pine? I dunno, but it smelled like that sounds.
Taste is... well, let me just say, I don't know that I would immediately peg this as the best DIPA I've ever tasted... but it's certainly the cleanest, and has the most perfect, medium body, clean finish, and balance of hop flavors to malt sweetness, particularly for a beer this size, ever. Only beer that comes close to this level of drinkability is Pure Hoppiness, which also was a chore to NOT chug like hop candy water.
Flavor is a burst of resiny hop goodness, and while it has an appropriately sweet and full middle that accentuates grapefruit and pine notes and a bit of musty tangerine... it has a clean, dry finish that's smooth as silk on the tongue. I've had more satisfying full-bodied flavor explosions before, but this is up there, and more of a 4.6 or 4.7 in taste than a 4.5.
It's interesting to me... this beer is both entirely deserving of its fame and reputation.... and yet not. Every hoppy beer producer and hop afficianado should make a point to seek this out, yes, but it's not more spectacular in flavor than some of your regional favorites. If I could get this regularly, or easily, I'd love it... but what makes it so spectacular is its easy drinkability. To seek this out and try to nurse the experience out seems at odds with the character of this beer. 1,595 characterserrantnight, Apr 17, 2008

What an exceptional beer. The hop aroma jumps out of the glass and hits your nose about a foot from the glass. Tastes of citrus and pine hopiness. Extremely clean and dry finish. No off flavors or astringency. For a DIPA this is very drinkable. I think I'll have two. 304 charactersTheEremite, Apr 16, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On-tap at Lucky Baldwin's in Pasadena, CA. 
Appearance: The pour is a rich auburn color with a frothy beige head. 
Smell: The nose is bursting with freshly peeled grapefruit and resinous pine out in front of sweet caramel malts and soft fruit.
Taste: The flavor profile starts out with an immediate bitter hop-filled explosion. Then, all of a sudden, the grapefruit, pine, and floral hop assault takes a supporting role as Bartlett pear and Fuji apple linger in the mid-palate. Sweet caramel pops in just before the beer finishes with a resurgence of bitterness that manages to be equally intense, crisp, and refreshing. 
Mouthfeel: It's on the heavier side of medium-bodied and somewhat sticky with a lively mix of hop bite and carbonation. 
Drinkability: Pliny the Younger is dangerously drinkable and, considering its enormous IBU and ABV numbers, it has absolutely no right to be. This is now the fifth beer on my list of beers that will always appeal to me, regardless of which styles I'm in the mood for. It's a truly remarkable beverage. 1,049 charactersgoschool, Apr 16, 2008

Strong citric, grapefruity aroma. Noticable crystal malt notes and some alcohol.
Poured golden-orange with slight haze. Not much head aside from a slight ring around the side of the glass.
Hops are most noticable flavor component: citric and grapefruity with stong hop bitterness. Big malt backbone serves to prevent the hops from completely overshelming this beer (just barely). Some crystal malt notes apparent in background. Stong alcohol flavor as well. Tangy, citric, bitter finish.
Medium-bodied with a rich mouthfeel. Some alcohol warmth, but not overwhelming. Medium carbonation.
This is a huge beer, but surprisingly drinkable for a triple IPA. Very nice. 692 charactersojclark, Mar 31, 2008

A: Very orange, no shades or red or yellow, this was pure orange. Served into a Chimay goblet, not much head but plenty of lacing.
S: Strong grapefruit hops, but lots of estery malt, peach and citrus.
T: Massive citrus hops dominate the flavor, but again there's that huge malt component. Plenty of sweetness here but the balance still favors the hops. 
MF: Rich and smooth. Enough carbonation to give it a bit of bite, but not overly abrasive. The hops have a bit of an acidic bite, so the feel is a bit stinging, and the finish is fairly dry.
D: This is a really really good IIPA, one of the best I've had. The balance is pretty impressive because it packs quite a hop punch and yet it doesn't abuse your mouth. I think I had unrealistic expectations about this though, like it would be some sort of religious experience. An excellent brew and one that I would not hesitate to drink again, but I can't say I would rate this higher than some of my other favorite IIPA's. Still, just another fantastic brew from RR, and something I would never pass up the opportunity to drink. 1,115 charactersrxdrewthejew, Mar 26, 2008

S: Grapefruit heaven. I love the aroma from west coast IPAs. There is a touch of sweetness in there also.
T: HUGE grapefruit blast initially that fades ever so slightly into a good sweetness. It isn't really a malty sweetness though. Others have suggested that the sweetness is actually from the amount of hops and I could see how that could be true. Leaves a great grapefruit aftertaste and a slight burning on the tongue.
M: Thick and creamy. Very deceiving from the color.

A- You gotta love RR's pop-top growlers. This had been sitting in a fridge for three weeks and still poured with a magnificent creamy head that disipates to a subtle lace. The only short-coming with this brew is the color. It was a little on the pale side, pouring a ayryupy, light orange-yellow.
S- Heavy on the west coast citrusy hops. Its like a large grapfruit humping a small pine tree.
M- Full-bodied that leaves a bitter coating on the tounge. Light on the carbonation.
T- Not just a Hop Bomb. There's a sweetness that I can't define from the hop overload and finishes with a cinnamon-like tingle in your mouth.
D- Pretty easy drinking considering the full body and 11%. Dangerously so. 741 charactersAvryle, Mar 16, 2008

A: Pours a clear golden color. Decent amount of white head especially for a growler. This looks like a cheaper beer but do not judge this book by it's cover.
S: Grapefruit dominated this for me. Tons of citrus and that really good west coast hop smell. Slightly flowery.
T: Hops. Really sweet for a DIPA. This was what we kept coming back to. How sweet this beer was. It was not even a malt sweetness. Almost like there were so many hops it picked up a sweetness. While there is a bit of balance going on here there are still enough hops to keep even the most grizzled hophead happy.
M:Super creamy with a nice thick mouthfeel.
D:No hint of the ABV at all. This beer could definately get you in trouble. While this was a great beer I do not know if I would actively seek it out. If I lived in Cali I would be drinking this on the regular however. 904 charactersaerozeppl, Mar 16, 2008

4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.53/1/08: What a day here in Denver. We spent our time outside enjoying the 74 degree winter heat, had some friends over for a barbecue, threw some darts, drank beer, played basketball with the kids, could it get any better? Yes, yes it can. The mailman delivered a package, not just any package, this was beer mail. Ladies and gentlemen, Pliny the Younger is in the building!
Appearance: Poured a beautifully clear and brilliant light honey orange. A frothy thick 2 finger head adorns itself at the top of this nectar from god. It dissipates leaving a sticky lacing around the glass.
Nose: After letting the head settle I give a little swirl and bury my nose deep in the glass. I am greeted with big grassy hops, almost the same as when you were a kid and you would chew on a piece of grass while playing in the yard. Sweet crystal sugars, fruit - tangerine, and a slightly bready malt buried in the background. The alcohol is noticeable for a quick moment but then gone, hidden by this enormous nose.
Taste: Seriously, how? The first thing that comes to mind is how balanced and drinkable it is, almost like it has been slightly aged. Intense fruity hops, bold in nature but not overwhelming or one sided, followed by sweet hard candy sugars, doughy malt backbone, but the hops win out with a long bittering finish. 
Mouthfeel: Full, initially sticky and sweet quickly followed by warming alcohol. Only light carbonation, overall a surprisingly thick and coating mouth, especially for this style.
Drinkability: You would drink this until you passed out or you ran out.
Overall: Last May I had a beertopia experience when I received a growler of the Elder in a trade. It was by far the best beer I had had until now, and while I can't say that the Younger is leaps and bounds beyond that of its uncle, the incredible complexities and balance give it the nod. Honestly, I would take either over any other beer on the planet, any day of the week. You drink this and you feel like you are experiencing a work of art. You understand that a true craftsman created this masterpiece, revealing it slowly one sip at a time. I am simply in awe, thank you Russian River. 2,165 characterssession1979, Mar 03, 2008

m -- good carbonation, smooth, lingering hop sense
d-- easily slides down my gullet, I had to take 3 or 4 sips before I even started to figure out this beer it really good out standing brew. My wife and I put down the whole growler before we realized how much alcohol was in this beer.

An unbelievable fresh citrus nose. It's like a mix between Pure Hoppiness and Summer Yulesmith, toss in some pine sap and you have it. Earthy, green hops at first, just incredibly clean. Then big bold citrus scents come through. Bitter grapefruit, tangerine, orange, and hints of lemon. A piney undertone is there for sure as well. 
Taste was just shocking to me. It was so much bigger than the smell lead me to believe. The inviting nose had lured me in and now I was getting slapped across the face with hops, laughing as my cheeks turned red with embarrassment. My forehead began to sweat, I got chills down my spine, and from that point on I knew I was in love. Seriously, there are still great citrus flavors and it's super fresh but wow, the piney hops are coming through full force. It's like pure hop juice glory without the overly oily and resinous body. As it warms, malts (huh?) do come through. A light caramel sweetness doesn't so much tame the wallop but it's there. 
Bitter but not drying, tingling but not numbing, full but not oily. When I got this growler I was drinking it within an hour. Within the next hour, I had consumed nearly three pints of this addicting serum. A few hours later, after I took a nap, I couldn't help but come back for more. 
This is truly a dream come true for hop lovers and I'm fortunate to have tried it. I put it in the realm of Yulesmith and Pure Hoppiness as my favorites. Not really in a class of its own but for now, it stands at the top. Andy, you are quite the generous soul, thank you! 1,752 charactersncvbc, Feb 25, 2008
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5While in Santa Rosa I visited the brewpub and filled my Growler, brought it home and poured a small glass. I have waited a long time for this to be available and it was worth the wait. Without a doub this is the best over the top DIPA I have ever partaken, and this is my favorite beer type. Poured a hazy gold tending toward orange with a soap suds head that left big chucks of lacing. Huge citrus hops nose, and a rich mouthfeel that feels like port wine on the palate. Flavors are citrus hops and the finish is long and bitter, but enjoyably so. I was prepared to be disappointed after the long wait, but this is the best brew ever for me. So sad I only have a growler. I really love this beer. I was going to save a 5.0 for the very best. This is it! 754 charactersrkuhnel, Feb 24, 2008
4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - pours a hazed light orange amber. Very little head, but after transfers from tap to growler to bottle to glass, well, I can be forgiving. A thin layer of bubbles appears and kind of limps off to the side.
Aroma - good malt base, intense pine and fragrant grapefruit following.
Taste - whew! A sweet start, the malts are there but struggling to develop because the hops are on right now! Intense in many ways - pine, grapefuit, bitter, and a late sweet orange citrus on the back of the tongue that comes outta nowhere. I think the underside of my tongue is even tasting this, and that's impossible!! :-D Very sweet and bitter on the same swallow, pretty cool. Late aftertaste is quite dry and bitter. It does the DIPA proud. A smooth warming alcohol feel as it warms. What a fine glass o' beer.
Mouthfeel - as expected, the carbonation is probably half of where it started. I still get a good hoppy burp here and there. For a DIPA the body is thicker than normal but most reasonable.
Drinkability - sickeningly drinkable. At 11%, that is a problem. No wonder pimpp offered to hook me up with a sample, he was probably very 'happy' after downing over half the growler, lol. At any rate, big karmaic kudos to him for sharing this delicious brew. 1,259 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Feb 21, 2008

Also, thanks to SirChugsAlot, kersta8, dsigmon, beavers, and NJpadreFan for the kind words in the thread that SirChugsAlot made. jwolfie70 saw that thread and decided to offer me the growler. So, Thanks everyone!
A: Pours a bright, hazy, glowing blood orange rind. A nice 1 1/2 - 2 finger pearly white head forms in the snifter and takes its time walking down. Nice lacing throughout.
S: HUGE hop bomb! My nose was assaulted right when I popped the swingtop. Very west coast. Huge, slightly stinging citrus notes with massive amounts of pine and hop leaf resin. So much resin that it's almost like it's wet hopped. Alcohol is present in the slight sting mixed with the citrus. Malts are sweet yet controlled... I can't wait.
T/M: MMMmm! Tastes like I brushed my teeth with pine cones and then swished with grapefruit pulp, haha. A nice alcohol bite lets you know this beast means bidnus. Malts are super sweet and bready, cutting just enough of the hop blast to add somewhat of a balance. Body is medium+ throughout with a huge creamy, sticky, and sometimes chewy mouthfeel. Finishes instantly super dry but not overdone and with a long lasting bitterness.
D: I'll tell ya what... If I could finish this entire growler tonight, I would. After a second 10ish ounce sampling my tongue started to feel tortured. A 12oz. bottle is being hand filled and handed over to brewdlyhooked13 and then I'll finish the rest tomorrow... if my tongue can handle it :) 1,533 characterspwoods, Feb 18, 2008
4.09/5  rDev -12.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4We are, we are...youth of the nation. On tap at O'Brien's in San Diego. Poured a somewhat hazy orange color. A good head when poured although did dissipate during the tasting. Some viscous sticks to the glass when you swirl it.
The nose is citrus hoppy with mostly grapefruit and oranges. A fantastic nose that shines of Amarillo, Summit and other "C" hops. To compare with Elder, the nose is much more hoppier and sweeter.
The taste is punch in the mouth hops. Sure it's a crazy west coast hop bomb but both hop, bittering and finishing, and hop to malt are so far out of balance, especially if you compare it to Elder. To start, the hops have a strong bittering bite that last through the finishing taste which overpowers the finish hop flavors. There are some piney and citrus finish but it plays second fiddle here. There is a sweetness to the beer that really is off for me as well. Feels like its under attenuated although there really isn't much of an alcohol or estery flavor at all. As your taste buds adjust the malt flavors come out but really limited with some sweetness and stickness.
The body of course is big. Carbonation is light, maybe to bring out the hop flavor. With the sweet syrupy finish leaves a blah aftertaste. Overall this is an ultimate hop bomb, but with my money give me an elder every time. I suppose I would have to say respect your elders. 1,375 charactersOxymoron, Feb 18, 2008

4.78/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on tap at Hollingsheads. Poured clear orange with ample but short lived head. I'm amazed a beer so hoppy can be perfectly clear like this.
Smells like the hoppiest of IPAs combined with the maltiest of barleywines. Much more complex than any other Imperial IPA I've ever had. Hard to distinguish individual aromas, but very interesting anyway.
The taste is incredible: hops and citrus, malt and fruits, all well balanced with no one flavor being to dominant. Obviously, hops are a major part, but they are so well balanced with the sweetness that I can't imagine anything better.
Mouthfeel is just as awesome as the taste. Medium bodied, slightly syrupy sweetness, with an excellent bitter and sweet finish. Drinkability is amazing for the extreme ABV.
This is one of the few beers that I loved so much I keep wishing for more. If Russian River bottles this, it will be a dream come true!

Had another tall pour at Hollingshead's again today. I stand by everything I said before in my previous review. Incredible beer in all regards, and the best Imperial IPA I've ever had, bar none. 1,104 characterssrroos, Feb 17, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served to me in a Chimay chalice at Hollingshead's.
A- Clear orange in color with a moderate head that dissipates quickly and leaves a bit of sticky lacing.
S- Tons of piney and citrusy hops backed by some very sweet and fruity malts. Tangy tropical fruits and orange peel too.
T- Everything the aroma promises. The bitterness is intense, but the sweetness of the malt evens it out nicely. The phenomenal thing about this beer is that the sweetness never becomes cloying. This is the perfect balance of bitter and sweet. The alcohol is well-hidden too. 
M- Oily, slick, and syrupy with mild carbonation. Just right for a beer like this. 
D- The drinkability is exceptional for a beer with such a high alcohol content. Every sip leaves you wanting more. 
The best double IPA I've ever had. This is ridiculously good. 821 charactersTdizzle, Feb 15, 2008
4.51/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said? I believe this is my third or fourth year having it, and it has always been incredible.
Grabbed a pint of this nectar of the gods at O'Briens. Pours a very clear deep orange color with a nice little head on top and just a bit of lacing.
Smell was not as over the top as I remembered and hoped for but still a rather nice citrus, lemon and slight piney hoppy sweet aroma.
Delicious taste that was actually quite sweet but not in a cloying way. Perfect amounts to balance the explosive hops and extreme alcohol levels. It all melds together so well you would have no idea it's so alcoholic.
A great full bodied mouthfeel with a nice prickly carbonation that makes for an easy drinking beer. I can't think of very many 11% beers that go down as well as a pint of Younger. 
This is one seasonal offering that I'm very excited for every year. I can't imagine how crazy people are going to go for the bottles of it once the new production brewery gets up and running. 1,028 characterskleffman, Feb 14, 2008
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4$5 pint at O'Brien's. Now, last night I started feeling congested and felt a cold coming but I was still able to taste/smell fairly well.
Served in a pint glass. Caramel color with a quarter inch of foam. Good retention. A few soapy spots of lacing.
Big juicy hops. Lots of citrus, lemon, bitter orange and grapefruit zest. Hints of toast and caramel malt, but quickly overpowered by the hops. Just a wonderful bouquet of fruits and hints of pine.
Holy hoppiness! Yep, that's it!
Damn, I think this cleared my sinuses. The most citrusy and yet balanced DIPA I have ever had (just ahead of Summer YuleSmith). Lemon, grapefruit, orange, and a bit of pine on the finish. 
Most perfect mouthfeel. Full bodied but not syrupy. Soft on the palate yet a little aggressive on the tongue. Just a little alcohol on the finish, and I was surprised to find out it was 11% 
While this one was great, I probably couldn't drink more than 2 servings before getting full. Definitely worth seeking out. 989 charactersseaoflament, Feb 14, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I enjoyed a half liter of this at Hollingshead today. I have never had a sip of alcohol at work for my entire life, but given that I expected this to be a once a year opportunity, I made an exception. Halfway through, the barkeep casually mentioned that they actually received five kegs instead of their usual one. So it goes.
Pours a bright burnished orange. Clearer and more uniform in color than I expected. Little to no head. Smells like grapefruit and pine. Some tropical pineapple/passion fruit notes in the aroma, but little to no malt. Oily, viscuous, and perfect mouthfeel. 
The flavor is robust and awe-inspiring. There is definitely tons of sweet, pink grapefruit-y tropical-ness and caramel malt to balance out a truly explosive pine and grapefruit hop backbone. That's right: this the rare beer in which the dominating characteristic is hops, and yet it actually is balanced by sweeter characteristics. Very drinkable. 
I'm not sure what else there is to say. This beer has been well reviewed. This has joined Dreadnaught at the top of my DIPA chart. 1,066 charactersOverlord, Feb 13, 2008

On tap at Hollingsheads, poured into a Chimay goblet, transparent rich golden orange with not much foam. The smell is earthy but mostly citrusy hops. Pine citrus leafy hop taste. You get a nice bitterness in the end but its not overpowering. The mouthfeel is really good as there's not too much of a syrupy feel to it. There is a nice level of carbonation that is just prickly enough. This is about as drinkable as any triple or even double IPA could be. The high alcohol hits me but doesn't stop me from ordering another. I'm going back for more in a couple days.

I was able to revisit Younger at Lucky Baldwin's Delirium Cafe and must say that it's now my favorite IPA of any kind out there. The aroma really hit even more today as fresh citrus and pine and it was again exceptional. I think it deserves a 5 overall. 849 charactersMiScusi, Feb 13, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5An exeptional beer. It pours a deep red copper, with a small white head. The smell is dominated by floral hops. The taste is definitely sweet, but it is balanced out nicely by a very strong floral hop taste that keeps the beer from being too sweet. The aftertaste is dominated by the hops. The beer leaves a hop stickiness coat on your mouth. Definitely a beer that I would recommend trying. 391 charactersjwolfie70, Feb 12, 2008

A-Golden orange with a nice brightness, 3/4 fluffy off white head, stuck around for about two minutes, some of the best sticky lacing I have ever seen
S-Crazy amounts of hoppiness, both citrus and floral, pine aromas, wood scents, deep sweet malt notes, tropical fruit, and strong perfume
T-Bitter, dry, hoppy, sweet, tangy, chewy, you name it and this beer has got it, the balance of this was awesome, sweet malt mixed with unlimited amounts of hoppiness, sweet tangerine, lemon, orange peel, grapefuit, pineapple, green apple, and then a somewhat chewy malt backbone, finish was dry and sweet at the same time, seemed like a session beer the way it was going down until it just hits you immediately, this baby is strong and there is no doubt about it, more complex than I thought an India pale ale could be, one of the best tasting beers I have ever had the chance to indulge in
M-Dry and sweet mouthfeel at different times, definitely more bitter when it was cold and crisp, taste lingered for minutes, perfect level of carbonation, nice looking medium body
D-If I did not know how much alcohol was in this beforehand I probably would not have been able to drive home because I would have kept drinking it, scary drinkability, alcohol is hidden amazingly, eleven percent is strong though, smooth and goes down with ease
I have been wanting to try this for the last two Febraurys, I always seemed to miss it at Naja's and Hollingshead, best IPA I have ever had without question, would have been a perfect score if it was not for the huge ABV, between this and the Beatification I drank last night, Russian River is easily my favorite brewer out there, this blows Pliny the Elder away and that is an almost perfect beer in my opinion, my buddy next to me said this was the best beer he has tasted, very highly recommended 2,020 charactersFloydster, Feb 12, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured off the tap at Pizza Port C'bad on 2-9-08. Poured into pint glass a golden color with no head by the time the bartender handed it to me but a lot of cotton candy lacing. Smell is like running through the NorCal forests of Humbolt while holding an grapefruit in one hand and in the other pineapple.( in other words giant forest pine aroma mixed with grapefruit, citrus, and tropical fruits.) The Taste was pine resin hoppy at first with a monster sweet malty backbone. But as it warmed up the bitterness took effect adding layers of citrus rinds to the pine flavor with the sweetness still there but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is as full as a TIPA could be without being cloy or overdone, it was sticky with a light creamy carbonation. Considering its 11% ,extremely hoppy and bitter, with a giant malt backbone this beers has a balance of those extreme features that keeps it from being a one hitter quitter beer. 925 characterssfoley333, Feb 10, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was skeptical of the hype for this beer but cutting to
the chase, it delivers, especially as it warms up a little. Had this on tap first at RR brewpub, then at Toronado, review was from first tasting
A: 4.5: A deep, clear, golden orange color with a thin off white
head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring with moderate lacing
and a little carbonation with small persistent, rising bubbles
S: 5: Damn. Punch in the face. Citrus, pine, floral, everything
hits at once and in balance. I could just keep smelling this beer
T: 5: Perfect, at first while this was a little too cool there wasn't that much bitterness from the hops and instead was just a delicious semi-sweet citrus flavor then as it warms up a little the there is a stronger bitterness up front that never lets go but never quite devastates the palate like Hop 15 or Hopslam. Slight malt, chocolate taste hiding in the finish too. Also as it warms up there is a slight taste of alcohol in the background to remind you of the 11% abv. Basically, this is just too good.
M: Again, near perfect to me, nice medium to thicker body that is very smooth and in the finish remarkably creamy/silky with a moderate level of carbonation. 
D: Considering the alcohol and ibu this deserves something higher than a 5. I have not had the Elder yet so I can't compare but of all the Imperial/Double/whatever IPAs I've had this is by far the best and easiest drinking. 1,417 charactersyourefragile, Feb 06, 2008
4.47/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bright peachy orange color. Nice fresh hop aroma, leans toward ripe citrus but also some earthy/herbal notes too. Nose is clean, citrus hops, with a permeating but pleasant bitterness that carries some ripe tangerine flavors. Slightly viscous, full mouthfeel. Malt provides perfect vehicle for all the hops, without getting in the way. Really nice hop complexity with the perfect amount of bitterness to finishing ratio. Hop flavors are complex, with leafy earth and pine coming through after initially ripe citrus burst. While this IPA is a whopping 11% abv, it is not overly sticky, cloying, or too sweet, and the alcohol is almost undetectable. Probably one of the best versions of the strong IPA style I've had, and almost worthy of its reputation, but not the lines and inconvenience of many of the release events. Tasted @ Toronado 2/2/08. 845 charactersbcm119, Feb 04, 2008
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap at the Toronado on 2/2/08.
A: Pours a bright orangish color with a thick white head. Tons of sticky sweet lacing all over the glass. Even the color in the brew screams out "citrus"!
S: The best nose in an DIPA that I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. It bursts out with fresh hops. An absolute wallop of fresh citrus fruit in the form of grapefruit, orange, and other tropical fruits. Of course, the woodsy pine is also present.
T: An incredibly well crafted and delicious DIPA. The best I've ever had. An explosion of hops, but not at all over the top and always in perfect harmony with the slightly sweet and light underlying malts. It's really the perfect DIPA in my book, an explosion of citrus hops, a wonderful bitter pine aftertaste, and always in prefect balance and harmony with the malt backbone.
M: Another perfect, for the mouthfeel in this is sublime. Just ever so slightly thick with an active carbonation. Perfect amount of body.
D: Well, this beer sure did have a lot of hype and I wasn't sure if it could live up to it. Not only did it live up to the hype, it exceeded it. Probably my favorite beer of all time. It's really ever thing that I look for in my favorite style, the DIPA. It's a shame that it's only releases once a year but I would go the ends of the earth to sip this one again. 1,331 characterswilljschmidt, Feb 03, 2008

S- Smell is very piney, some deep sweet malt notes, reminescent of Pliny the Elder but much bigger with hints of alcohol.
T- Taste is phenomenal. A very complex IPA, a boquet of piney, floral hops, big malt backbone, hard to describe but everything you could ask for in a triple IPA and more. 
M- Mouthfeel is thick with carbonation a bit on the low side which suits this brew.
D- I could honestly drink this beer until I passed out. One of my favorite beers, bar none, and I don't say that a lot. 601 charactersLothore, Feb 01, 2008

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Golden-amber in the glass with the faintest hop haze and a quarter-inch of white froth. Head retention is very good for such a high gravity beer, and the brightness and clarity are impressive.
The hop aroma is huge. Very resiny like Elder, but with a slightly greater sugary malt presence. Notes of pine and tropical fruit from the hops, the depth is outstanding and there's barely a hint of sweetness despite the staggering 11% ABV.
Plenty of juicy, resiny hops in the taste, but they're expertly balanced by the light malt backbone. Zesty and fruity hop flavors mix with notes of peach, pineapple and biscuit. A puckering hop bitterness comes out in the finish, overpowering the malt and drying the palate slightly.
Sticky, lightly oily with semi-crisp carbonation. Dry and bitter but displaying amazing balance, the bitterness never becomes wearying and the alcohol is hardly noticeable. 893 characterslargadeer, Jan 31, 2008

S: Big citrusy hop smell packed with grapefruit aroma.
T: Loaded with citric hop deliciousness. Not overwhelmingly bitter, per se, but tilting heavily toward that side of the spectrum. A slightly noticable alcohol presence.

A: Poured into a Chimay chalice, Pliny the Younger pours a vibrant, sparkling orange, with a creamy, billowy almost white head. Good retention with solid lace.
S: Very hoppy, with lots of pine and fragrant grapefruit. Smells like a freshly cut Christmas tree.
T: Magnificent, incredibly hoppy and complex. Hop city, if you want to know what American hops are all about, then drink this beer. Lots of pine, grapefruit, and a fair amount of tropical fruit like papaya and pineapple abound in its great taste, with a good amount of complex, solventy alcohol.
M: Robust, resiny, warming, fruity, and complex.
D: Another great beer from Russian River, I prefer the Elder to this one, but this is a great beer in its own right, everyone who can find this elusive beer should try it. Too drinkable for it's weight, a pint will get you buzzed and only make you want more.
Edit 2/15/10 - Having this beer on-tap, fresh at Hollingshead's at 10:10 am when your taste buds are at their best, I think I really know where I am at with this effort. Upped the taste and drinkablity a bit, lowered the appearance, 4.6 tells you really what I think. This is the new #1. This is truly world class. In the end though I can get a similar experience from PtE and I don't have to fight crowds and lines. The hype machine has truly taken this beer to another level. It's so good, I think I will venture to Beachwood on the 23rd, but in the end, I don't know how pumped I'll be about seeking this beer out in 2011. Pretty much check it out at Beachwood since it's close. But the easy days of PtY are over.
Edit 2/25/11 - Having this year's version, it wasn't anywhere close to last year's, just a solid beer. Dropping the score down since sometimes it's insane, other times just a "good" DIPA. 1,818 charactersHalcyondays, Aug 02, 2007
4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a home bottled younger some months ago but never recorded. Recording on revisiting it this evening.
Pours a golden orange into my Smutty Big Beer glass. A decent little head rises up and fades away in minutes. Aroma is deep, and sweet with the rich resiny hops kicking in and rounding out the nose.
Taste falls in line with aroma. Hops hit syou but the sweetness carries it through the sip. Lots of sweeet and sticky conifer, not even pine so much, resiny pitch that sicks deep into the swallow and lingers till the cotton sets in and your mouth is so dry it puckers. This gets a bit hotter as the temp creeps up letting some alcohol shine through a bit.
Have to thoroughly enjoy when the hype holds up. This is obviously a winner when in the mood for a DIPA. 780 charactersgpcollen1, Jun 29, 2007

Bright and inviting aroma of tangerine and honeydew melon, some honey and cinnamon.
Full and rich flavor of resinous toffee sugar and some oily and sticky citrus hops. Less sweet than in the nose, more orange flavored with some grapefruit rind in the finish. A piney warmth lingers and warms the mouth. That 11% octane is well hidden beneath the flavors.
Good mouthfeel and carbonation despite the ABV. Pretty full and satisfying.

Great hoppy aroma.
Perfect balance, [Huge beer of course but...] big malt to go with the bitter hops.
 [My local brewer makes a great triple, that actually come pretty close to this and some day some how i need to get this Pliny the Younger and Buzzsaw together!]

4.62/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Props to Redwood George for getting a bottle of this to someone in the Chicago area!!!
The appearance was a hazy, bright gold color with about 1/4 inch of white head. A few initial whiffs brought scents of grapefruit and lemon rind. More careful sniffing brought out some alcohol and bready croissant aromas.
The flavor was all about hops. There is a strong hop bitterness made up of mostly grapefruit, pine, and lemon flavors. What is not there is a strong alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is full with a dry, bitter finish.
Overall this is an exceptionally easy drinking double (or triple) IPA. Much more drinkable than other examples that I have had. I could drink a lot of this... which is very dangerous. 714 characterswestweasel, May 29, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale, hazy gold. Creamy head of white foam sits steady.
I was caught off-guard by the sweetness right off the bat..but that being said, once the sticky sweetness fades, this is one hoppy mother#^!%er... The citrus flavors are simply incredible..grapefruit, pineapple, orange, peach, mango, kiwi, etc, etc.. leading into an equally impressive piney, floral hop bite...wow. I would need to drink a lot more of this to try and capture all the flavors..and I have a feeling I'd be up for the challenge.
The huge hop dosage leads to a dry finish that leaves you tasting hops long afterwards..and at 11%, this remains remarkably drinkable down to the last drop.
A unique, complex, and unrelenting beer that certainly demands respect.
Can't thank wcudwight enough for the chance to try this rare gem. 809 charactershero27, May 21, 2007
4.53/5  rDev -3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had on cask at Naja's Place on my 21st birthday.
I was excited watching the beertender pump this one out of the beer engine and my mouth was salivating as she handed me my first legal "good beer." The beer was a dark orange with very little active carbonation, but a uge white frothy head. The taste was... well it's Younger. It's fantastic. Hoppy, creamy, smooth, hoppy, delicious. This was a most fantastic beer, I wish I could drink more of it, but it was my 21st and I was at Naja's and there were way too many other beers I had to try that night. I might not have been the best "advocate" that night, but dammit, how many times o you turn 21 at Naja's? Fantastic stuff, highly reccomended. 695 charactersbradford, May 20, 2007

Aromas of citrusy(especially grapefruit), zesty, lemony, piney, grassy HOPS, HOPS, HOPS!!!
Tastes of nice subtle, sweet malt and citrusy hops with a hint of alcohol.

4.89/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Nice golden color with an off-white head that retains well and leaves a decent lacing. Absolutely mind blowing aroma. Full of citrus; grapefruit and pine and other aromas I can't hardly begin to describe are not only blended perfectly, but are powerful enough to greet your tongue from a foot away. Amazing taste of aforementioned aromas with a strong, yet amazing bitterness. The bitterness seemed like it came in waves; extremely bitter, but only pleasant bitterness, not harsh at all. Mouthfeel was medium bodied with a dry finish, leaving you wanting more and more once the explosion of taste leaves your mouth. I would drink the hell out of this if given the opportunity. 
I should note that this was from a growler shared at DLD, it was not a full glass, but I felt there was more than enough for a review. 813 charactersbadbeer, Apr 30, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5HUGE THANKS to todd1 for this growler. You are a god among men, sir.
Pours out crystal clear, thin white head. Golden/copper in color. Not much carbonation to be seen... maybe since it's from a growler. Nice lacing whilst drinking.
Absolutely amazing hop aromas going on here. Very citrusy, bold American hops. Perfect for the style.
Taste absolutely lives up to reputation. Bold hop flavor, not overly bitter or aggressive. Sticky, citrus flavors... incredibly smooth and balanced. Strong malt backbone. Honestly, the most well-balanced DIPA I've ever had. As this warmed, the hops became even more prevalent.
Mouthfeel is wonderfully full. Nice hop-stickiness across the palate. I think this brew lost a bit of the carbonation being in a growler for a week before I opened it, but it's still very nice.
I didn't notice that this was 11% ABV until I was polishing it off. So smooth and tasty... masks the strong alcohol admirably. 946 charactersbobbyc881, Apr 26, 2007
4.53/5  rDev -3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Capone's 4/18/07.
Clear, true-gold in color. Modest, off-white head. Lacing minimal, some legs.
Aroma is grapefruit, peaches and honey. Smelled pine in my growler of Elder a few months ago, but didn't get that as much here. Tasting this side by side with Elder, and Younger doesn't smell as sweet.
Taste was grapefruit, big time. Younger has stronger hop bite than Elder. Biscuity, but covered in grapefruit jam. Well balanced, but still screams with hops, if that makes any sense. A bit sweeter than the Elder, and a more noticeable ABV. Grass and pepper at finish.
Medium to medium + in body. Carbonation seemed medium. Immediate feel of alcohol warming in Elder, alcohol warming with Younger when you pick up the glass...
Very, very good. If I wasn't drinking it side by side with Elder, I would probably have no complaints at all. As it stands, it is a touch sweeter and, to my taste, quite a bit hotter. I would happily drink this until I fell over, but when it came time to fill my growler, I took the Elder home with me. 1,052 characters, Apr 25, 2007
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Second of a group of growlers donated by kind hosts to the beer-sampling cause after being retrieved by a long road trip several days prior. Carbonation levels somewhat lower due to this treatment. Still sampled in reasonable condition and without having to take a personal trip down to Philly to have some. 
After a minor cuisine-related mishap that had me thinking this somewhat bland and watery (see my tasting notes for the Elder for details), I came back to this beer to be quite pleasantly surprised. Suddenly, tasted on a palate no longer swamped with spice, I had something big and broadly hoppy and quite enjoyable. 
Appearance was a clear deep amber. Due to conditions, there wasn't any obvious head without swirling up whatever little was still there, in which case there could still be some little bit of white bubbles. Big, broad, full nose of hops. Not so much a focused blast of grapefruit as in the Elder, more of a solid wide symphony of hops. Flavor was complex with a sort of mild start, then more of the hops shining through along side some syrupy-sweet caramel malt notes and then the 2x4 of the high alcohol to the side of the head. Wow. Needs to be treated with respect, but quite delicious. Again, quite similar to some other DIPAs that I'm fond of, but I prefer a more direct hop slightly lower alcohol/malt version so I will have to so that I prefer the Elder slightly. No matter, quite a wonderful beer. 1,436 charactersjsbrendle, Apr 25, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sampled on-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA on 4-18-07 as part of a side by side comparison with Pliny the Elder. This review is from notes taken that night.
APPEARANCE: Amber with gold highlights. Nice head with incredible lacing.
SMELL: Huge grapefruit and other citrus. Very raw hops flavors. Smells like the hops were just picked off the plant.
TASTE: It starts out so malty, you don't expect what's to come. But serious grapefruity hops come really hard, and last. The finish is nice and clean. An absolutely perfect beer.
MOUTHFEEL: Not very carbonated, but feels really smooth. Not syrupy like its Elder counterpart.
DRINKABILITY: Like the Elder, I'm blown away by this. No IPA can come close.
The Younger was my preferred Pliny of the night. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. 810 charactersjmalex, Apr 22, 2007

This beer is like Elder on steroids. The beer looks the same, smells much the same but there are some differences. The higher abv of the younger is evident. This takes just a touch from the drinkability because caution is needed. Much like the Elder, this beer is worthy of the hype and and I will likely try and get some more in the future. 412 charactersEnola, Apr 19, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a clear copper/golden color with a solid inch off-white sticky head. I honestly didn't spend much time eyeing this one as the aroma when the bottle cap was popped kind of put me into a trance. Wonderful punget hoppy aroma. The aroma almost dares you and invites you at the same time.
Taste is much like the Elder. Hops are more agressive and the alchohol is more noticable in the finish. Still a marvelous tasting beer.
Mouthfeel is full, sticky and numbing. The Younger attacks the palate and leaves no doubt that he was there.
As much as I like this beer, and I LIKE this beer. IMHO, the Elder is better. I could drink the Younger often, but only a pint at a time. I could spend a happy life drinking nothing but the Elder. Both are excellent examples of thier respective styles by a top notch brewery and a very tallented brewer.
Thanks to RedwoodGeorge for not only providing the beers, but for the experience. 924 characterswcudwight, Apr 16, 2007
4.1/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5On tap at the Toronado. After drinking Pliny the Elder too many times to count, I finally came across the much heralded and harder to find Pliny the Younger on tap. Like the Elder, the Younger pours beautifully with a clean, coppery orange and a nice two-finger head. The smell is pungent with citrus/grapefruit hops, but with less of the sweet pine and floral character you sometimes find in the other good IIPAs. Not a bad thing - just different and you know this one is going to hit you big time with the bitter end of the hops. Flavor is dominated by grapefruity bitterness, but kept in check with a biscuity malt. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly smooth for such a big beer. My only real complaint is I find this beer to be a little more astringent and hot with alcohol on the finish than I like. Where the Elder is the epitome of balance for me, I find this one a bit unbalanced. Some like this, but to me it makes this a "have a pint and then Im done with it" kinda beer. Another excellent effort by Vinnie, the Yoda of IPAs, but Id rather hook myself up to an I.V. of the Elder for the night! 1,102 charactersalohaC, Apr 05, 2007
4.44/5  rDev -4.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: Standard pint from tap
Appearance: Golden yellow in color, minus points for looking strangely like urine
Smell: Nothing overpowering with a light hop and medium malt smell.
Taste: A balanced malt flavor straight from the start quickly blends with a balanced hop charactor and a alcohol flavor. Finishes at first with a strong alcohol flavor that is mildly covered with the hops. The alcohol flavor quickly vanishes as the glass empties, because it starts to get you tipsy.
Overall: An excellent offering, but I didn't buy into the hype. I like the elder much more. I think with a little more time the alcohol would have aged into a more balanced beer. I finish still in search of a beer I would put in my all time top 10. 747 charactersJFazekas, Mar 27, 2007
4.67/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Advertised as a triple ipa at hollingshead's. Nice hoppiness on the nose and mouth. The hop level is high, but the cascades (with another hop that I don't know) make it citrusy and easy to drink. A lot of ipas are just hop bombs with nothing else. This beer is a hop monster, but has enough malting (especially a delicate caramel malting) behind it to not just be hop oil. The alcohol presence is also not too extreme even though this an 11 percent abv beer. This beer is a work of art and you need to go out and drink it. Stop reading my review and go drink it NOW! 566 charactersjasonjlewis, Mar 13, 2007
4.65/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I have had this beer four separate times. I have in front of me four separate pages of notes and my head is swirling with how to put this all together. Twice I did a side by side with the Elder and the Younger. Clearly these are two, TERRIFIC beers! The Younger is the strong muscular, steroid juicing aggressive loud ostentatious, sibling to the more refined, Elder brother. Pliny The Younger gets right in your face and smacks you around until you pay attention. Wow!
Appearance: pours light liquid gold into my snifter glass. A white frothy head rises moderately in this beer (more in the first growler than the second.) The carbonation in this beer is very tight. A few swirls and the wall of the glass are lined with lace though it does not stick. Very attractive brew.
Smell: The aroma is extremely poignant and yet quite complex. The bold resinous hops spray hop juice directly up the nose. When we opened the growler you could notice it across the table. There is a sweetness as well. A tropical fruit attribute that brings to mind pineapples and apricot along with the glorious grapefruit. The sweet sugary sticky backbone does present it self, and then is followed by a noticeable alcoholic rum-like presence as well.
Taste: Where do I even start. Again this is much more aggressive than the Elder. It is intensely hoped with grapefruit, pine, lemon, orange-rind, tangerine, pineapple, and pepper scorching the mouth and then peach, apricot, melon, and loads of sweet sugar, malts caramel and cookie-dough pull this back into harmony creating a nice balanced MONSTROUS beer. The alcohol plays a role in there too.
Mouthfeel: It is a rough prickly roller-coaster of sensations on the palate. It is hard to describe because the hops bite at you while the sugars ooze through the palate slow and sticky. It is sweet and full in the mouth but then the warming alcohol and the bitterness leave you feeling more of the bite than the sticky caramel sweetness.
Drinkability: This Monster is an EXTREME IPA! There is no two ways about it. It is not friendly or approachable, it is impressive. A magnificent display of what can be done when you give a great brewer the chance to show off. I suggest sipping this beer! =) I also discovered that you really do need to let it warm. Bars serve it too cold. Order it before your meal and drink it after; and I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
Hope this is helpful.
Cheers!

A- Light amber with ample white head

T - Kicks and envelopes taste buds with hop acidity, malt sweetness creeps in at the finish
M - Full round and substantial with sharp hop edges
D - Less than average drinkability due to over the top hops, alcoholic strength, but a delightful taste nonetheless
Edit -prior ratings A 4, S 4.5, T-4, M 4.5, D-4 from Growler
I went to the release this year and had it on tap -2014 I want to update since I was so impressed with the difference having it fresh from the source.
Start with appearance- the color is spot on with light haze and lasting head with fine bead. Smelling this- The smell is phenomenal, I don't think I have smelled hops as fragrant or clean with tropical fruit citrus and sweet floral odors in an Imperial IPA before -just incredible and wonderful in every way. The feel is equally great -practically no alcohol and lots hop resins with mild sweetness and semi high carbonation with moderate bitterness and semi-dry finish. 
 The flavor is great just embodies everything good about an Imperial IPA, Hops are the star but nice amount of malt body to support and the smooth flavor is seemless without much alcohol taste at all and I had this on an empty stomach/clean palate. Overall extremely drinkable for 10%+ and worth the time it took to try it on tap at the brewpub which I was skeptical of but recommend having this fresh to appreciate the true glory that is Pliny the Younger. 1,604 charactersSlatetank, Feb 27, 2007

Light coppery color with a slight haze.Very tiny compressed bubbles as the glass swirls. Once the aroma hit my nose i kinda forgot the check the color of the head. It was very creamy and left a good 1/2" coating through out.
The aroma was very intense Piney/Grapefruity. Fruity,very pineappley with sweet carmell trying to cut through all the hoppiness.
Awesome hop nose,the only way I could describe it is like crushing a handfull of fresh hops in you hands and totally covering your entire face with your hands full of the freshly crushed hops. The hop aromas were crisp and clean,fresh just awesome. The best hop aroma of anything i've ever smelled.
Intense grapefruit flavors lots of pine with a great sweet carmell taste. Just a hint of alcohol for 11% the taste was so good i forgot all about the alcohol. An amazing balance for all the hoppiness my mouth just kept watering for more.
Extra creamy,airy feel,syrupy with slick hop oilyness, juicy, just an awesome mouthfeel
The drinkabily was unbeliveable,enjoyed it so much didn't want to stop drinking it. I can't stop thinking about this beer. I want to thank Phatz's again for giving me the chance to taste this amazing beer.

A: The ale has a vibrant golden color that nicely blends orange and yellow tones. The head has held up nicely, coming in thick and billowy on each pour.
S: The aroma is this thick with big juicy hops. Aromas include grapefruit, apricot and soapiness. The malts are big too, caramelly and big.
T: This IPA is incredible. The hops are thick and powerful from the first sip to the last, providing apricot, pineapple, grapefruit and lemon rind flavors. The malts don't shy away from the hops either. They are big and chewy, full of caramel and biscuit. The strength of the malts is enough to push this into barleywine territory (but that is another argument for another day).
M: The mouthfeel is intense from start to finish, showcasing an incredible array of hops and a big malty profile.
D: If only this beer weren't 11%... The ale is delicious with a great hop profile that refuses to let go of your tastebuds. 1,005 charactersakorsak, Feb 25, 2007

Smell was, how do you say, HOPS! Must intense frwsh hop smell, almost burned the nose hairs, this is gonna be good.
The taste, everything I expected and more. So bitter it brings tear to the eye, huge pine hops, very fresh tasting, no balance here, none needed. Absolutly intense, slight warming from the alcohol and a very dry finish.
This was right on the money and at 11%abv, its a doozy to say the least. This lived up to the hype for me at least, a true double, dare I say almost a triple IPA, wonderful wonderful brew! 730 charactersmikesgroove, Feb 08, 2007

Smell: Floral and citrusy, all I can smell are hops and sweet fruits. The aroma is very intense.
Taste: tastes like it smells, with grapefruit coming in and a pine forest on the aftertaste. The malt base isn't as deep as I expected and this is not as balanced as the Elder, but the amount of hops is quite impressive. This is a hop-heads dream. There's also some alcohol, but for 11% it's covered very well by the intense hopiness.
Mouthfeel: Very bitter, especially as one keeps drinking it. It seems to magnify the bitterness with each sip.
Drinkability: For the amount of alcohol in this, it is way to easy to drink. It goes down the throat and is bitter enough to keep someone gulping. I'm very impressed and although it's not quite balanced enough for my tastes, I can see why this is so highly regarded. 949 charactersdbalsock, Feb 07, 2007

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had every batch of Pliny the Younger and I wasn't about to miss out on this latest one.
The beer poured a rich golden color with a small white head that quickly turned into a small lace.
The aroma of this beer was bursting with amazingly fresh hops. Pine and heavy citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, and pineapple) were there in abundance. The alcohol was there to help carry the aroma up and away.
The flavor of the beer had an intense, yet incredibly rounded hop profile that blended many hop flavors. A myriad of citrus fruits were there, but tangerine was the heaviest. Many double IPAs have hop profiles that are good, but one dimensional. PTY had a multi-dimensional hop flavor. The malt profile was clean and sweet. Mostly 2 row pale malt with some light notes of caramel malt.
The mouthfeel was medium/light with a rich creaminess that worked so well for this beer. I'm assuming corn sugar and Carapils malts were used in this beer which made it crisp and dry, yet still dextrinous enough to never be thin.
The carbonation was fine and tight.
This beer is a masterpiece. This latest batch seems like the finest to me. The hop profile is a little different and improved from previous batches. I'm fortunate enough to live close to several places that have this beauty tapped. Life is good. 1,303 charactersSacoDeToro, Feb 05, 2007

Much of this review compares the younger to the elder. Younger again is gold in color, maybe a bit lighter. Nice thick white head, which held together very well. Great piney aroma, not quite as much citrus as the elder. Very sweet, a huge malt backbone. Piney and citrusy hops, but without as much peach flavor as the elder. Nice full body.

S - Sweet juicy hops! Citrus, pine, tropical fruits, grapefruit, floral bouquet. Just about every great hop aroma I have come across is in this beer.
T - Intense pine, citrus, grapefruit and pineapple. Very hoppy upfront but I was surprised by the malt balance. That all changed. After each swallow the hops just built and built to a mouth puckering superb hop bomb. The bitterness is also present but sneaks up on you.
M - Medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Hint of oily hop resin present and a dry finish that builds after each sip.
D - Initially I was expecting more from this one but with every sip I took it built itself up to this massive, tasty, beautiful DIPA. The ABV is well hidden and 2/3 of the way through the growler, I can feel it sneaking up on me but it is still a truly tasty and highly drinkable DIPA. I can not wait until I get to CA and taste it straight from the brewpub. 1,015 charactersbrewcrew76, Jan 28, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Good looking indeed. Nicely carbonated with a large white and fluffy head that leaves some sticky lace behind. 
Piney and very fruity hops with a sweet aroma of malt. Good bit of alcohol in the nose with more citrusy fruit aromas than the elder. Sweet and very floral and very hard too pull your nose out of.
Again balanced, but more sweetness and slightly more body and balls. Alcohol adds a dimension not found in the Elder. Not as balanced but more piney hops on the finish which is also much longer yet lacking the lush creamy mouthfeel. Not as drinkable because of the drying hop finish and the alcohol content but quite drinkable and delicious. 656 charactersmcallister, Jan 28, 2007
4.4/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Originally reviewed on February 10, 2005. Handbottle. Aroma is fuming blast of acidic fresh spritizing strong and sour citrus of grapefruit, fresh spruce and a hint of perfumy essence. Pour is a oranged yellow rimmed clear pour, with a lacy spotted sheets on the class of clean white. Flavor is a sweet fresh grapefruit, lime and cilantro. Savory and gushing with a gentle sweet maltness that superbly comforts and carries the hops as a delicate and sumptumous hop elixir. A true ambrosia. If the malt lent a little more character, and the hops were a little more transformed into that mouth warming bready goodness, this would be a top 10. Nonetheless, its an astoundingly drinkable high alcohol brew, with all those flavors carried perfectly, yet not leaving a harsh impression on the palate. Finishes actually quite sweet and floral, as opposed to typical dry grass, instead with lemongrass and a sweet cinnamon candy. 923 charactersCharlesDarwin, Dec 07, 2006
3.63/5  rDev -22.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Served on Cask at Naja's Place in Redondo Beach.
This is the second time I've tried the younger, once on tap and once on cask. I've had the elder many times and will be drinking some tonight for MNF. I had to try the younger again before I reviewed it to give it a second chance. So many people say that it's better than the elder I thought it deserved a second go-around.
Pours a pale gold with a big head. Took the bartender a lot of pumping to get this one poured just right. The head subdues rather quickly. Not sure if that's the cask or the ABV.
The smell is of course hops plus a good dose of alcohol. The beer is 11% after all. The alcohol is almost dominant.
The taste is overload. Tons of hops and lots of alcohol burn. I'm sure there is sugar used in the brewing of both the elder and the younger. I like a good, strong beer, but the alcohol is almost to much.
If you are going to compare the Younger to something it might as well be the Elder. I had an Elder right afterwards and reaffirmed my preference. The Elder is perfection. Taste completely unique in a time when every brewer is brewing a DIPA. The Younger reminds me of several other DIPA's I've had. The hops are great in it, but I just don't care for the alcohol burn. 1,255 charactersCallenak, Sep 19, 2006
4.73/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow! On cask this beer takes a different form. I love it from the tap, but I find it difficult to drink more than one. From the cask, the smoothness allows for many pints. The ABV does not.
I had a few pints of PLY at Naja's Place. The bartenders were working that hand pump. 
It pours a beautiful dusky gold. A nice frothy head. The scents are crisp and fresh. A very clean scent. Some nice hops, but not too bitter on the nose. The scents are bold but not overwhelming. 
The flavors are extremely clean. A great mix of bitterness, but not so much that there is no barley. There is a nice barley back-bone to this beer. I am very impressed. I don't find this IPA to be very fruity, which I am very happy about. It has more of a sour and bitter flavor. The flavors compliment each other and do not fight for dominance. The bitterness previals, but the malts find a way to exert themselves. This beer has no bad aftertaste.
From the cask this beer is perfect. It is silk and velvet down the throat. What a treat. I cannot convey how the cask has made this beer so succulant and easy drinking. It is smooth like a like pure ice. 
From the cask this IPA is a great blend of flavors and smoothness. It is still bold, but the smoothness is just phenomenal. Drink it if you get the chance. Keep them coming Russian River. 1,330 charactersRumrunner, Sep 18, 2006

Poured a clear and shiny brass color. Not too much head but was an incredible amount of layered, wedding cake-like lace. Nose is full of pungent and wet wood and hops.
Flavor was hop bitterness but not bitingly painful. More of a sour citrus suchs as grapefruit flavor. Little hint of vanilla. Where is the heat from the alcohol--very nicely concealed. Slightly dry but there were lots of oils from the hops. Amazingly simple but still complex DIPA. They don't try to do too much here but create a solid beer. 592 charactersMuddyFeet, Sep 08, 2006
4.25/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I was lucky enough to have this delicious beer at the Grey Lodge in Northeast Philadelphia. Props to them for bringing in the goods. I must admit that I had a pint of the Younger immediately after a pint of the Elder, so my palate was certainly well worked over. However...
The appearance is beautiful, it pours a deep golden orange. Clear and thick with low lacing and a mild to no head.
The aroma is warm or alcohol and herbacious with hops. Sweet and spicy but not as piney as the Elder, more floral.
The taste hits you up front with a big hop bite and strong alcohol tingle. It's big, deep and rich in the middle and incredibly well balanced for the alcohol content. It has a deeper, subtler flavor than the elder with almost erverse characteristics.
The mouthfeel is thick with alcohol, slightly syrupy but pleasant all around. Good carb and nice mouthfill.
This is a big beer but could go for two in a row, sure another one! 945 charactersNoLiberty, Aug 27, 2006
4.27/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This is based on notes from The Drafting Room and The Grey Lodge.
This beer came a very foggy simple copper and gold with a wide collar of head.
Smelled of a beautiful honey and oats with a slight marshmallow. There was also a slight candied apple, dehydrated pineapple, and grapefruit. The blend of smells here is exquisite.
Tastes of a sweet pizza dough, powdered sugar and honey which is engulfed in a long lingering dry crisp pine that stings my tongue. Where malt ends and hops begin, no one knows. I'm impressed.
The mouth feel is heavy and viscous with a tiny smooth carbonation.
This is a really impressive beer, but I wouldn't want more than one. 660 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Aug 26, 2006
4.45/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Clear orange with a thin, cream coloured head. Spotty lacing was evident from the fine bubbles, which showed excellent retention. The aroma was all hops - powdery, floral, tangerine, pine, and grapefruit, not necessarily all at the same time though. There was a lot of malt sweetness up front, but a very strong bitterness hits at the same time. Floral and citrusy hop flavour fills the midsection, with mild pine, orange and tangerine. Spicy alcohol appears towards the end and grapefruit bitterness really lingers. Full bodied served with moderately low carbonation and significant alcohol warmth and numbing. Drying hop finish with slight stickiness. This is really good, really powerful. Highly drinkable for such a big beer. Everything is just turned up on this beer - a lot. I think I prefer the Elder as a beer I could drink on a regular basis - this one seems to be fit more for special occasions. I'd be a happy dude if I could get either on a regular basis... 969 charactersDrJay, Aug 26, 2006
4.17/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had this on-tap at The Drafting Room. My glass was filled with a golden copper color liquid with a thin white head. Some lacing was left but not like the amount left by the Elder. The aroma was filled with pine and citrus from the hops and a sweet caramel / tofffee scent. The flavor followed the smell. Hops were there but so was the sweetness. Somewhere in between a 90 min. and a 120 min. with the sweetness. Very smooth and not as bitter IMO as the Elder. The abv in this one (11%) limited me to only two glasses but they were tasty. Great brew, but I think the Elder comes out on top. 591 charactersImstillthegman, Aug 20, 2006

Advertised as a triple, I wasn't blown away though. There are local tripals in my area of SE Pa. that are on par with this in my opinion. I don't think it is that far above them.

4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Tria in Philadelphia, served in a 13 oz tulip glass. The beer poured a vibrant copper color, clear and with a thick off white head that disapated slowly and gave way to a nice ring around the end and a swirly island in the middle. The aroma was a strong pine and citrus nose that was similar to the Elder but kicked up a bit and more pure and extreme but enjoyable. The taste was very similar to the taste. There was the initial hoppy, piney taste with some citrus, grapefruit and a touch of sweet caramel. The mouth feel was very smooth with a nice alcohol burn on the way down that tells you this is a 11% beer. What a smooth ride the Younger was. I was expecting this to be hard to handle but found this very enjoyable and drinkable. I had 2 in this sitting and will go back for more wherever I can find it. Another RR hit and it has been a long time that I have waited to try this. 895 charactersggaughan, Aug 10, 2006

Aroma of piney hops, citrus fruits, tons of resin, caramel malts, and light alcohol.

3.82/5  rDev -18.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Despairing over not being able to get this on tap at the RR brewpub, I was overjoyed to find it on tap at Toronado in San Francisco.
A: An unmoving copper with a thin head. Still waters run deep, right?
S: Earthy hops--grass and cedar with a touch of sweeter fruit, maybe strawberry. This is certainly one of the strongest hop bouquets I've ever smelled.
T: An ode to the hop. The overall flavor is strong enough on malt and hops that it could pass as a barley wine (especially if Avery were making it), but it emphasizes on bitterness, from start to finish. The molasses like malty flavors up front give way to a dry and bitter finish, with hints of pine, grass, and alcohol.
M: I suppose that the quality of mouthfeel depends on how much you love the hop. The 'balance' is about as good as one might expect from a so-called triple IPA (which I will insist is not truly its own style); nonetheless, the residual bitterness is a little too much for my palate.
D: For sipping. 'Nuf said.
Overall, this is an ambitious and aggressive brew, significantly stronger than its (wonderful) uncle Pliny the Elder. It seems that RR isn't going for a beer that's going to please anyone other than the most die-hard of hop heads; while that may mean the beer won't be universally acclaimed, it's probably that kind of an attitude that helps make forward progress in the US craft brew industry.

4.3/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had this on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach. It was presented in a tumbler, and had a pale orange color with a thin foam comprised of big bubbles. The beer was very clear which I guess I didn't expect.
The aroma is massively hoppy, and of course the flavor also. Actually I compared this with the Pliny the Elder and I prefer the Elder because it seems a little more complex, kind of more malt in the flavor it seems to me. But that's just what I took out of it.
Drinkability is pretty high, even though this is pretty alcoholic. I think the hops weren't so excessive as to kill my tastebuds. 599 charactersTurdFurgison, May 21, 2006

Appears a light gold with a small off-white head that slowly fades out. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of bready, biscuits, citrus, rich resinous hoppy pine, and vanilla. Much like The Elder.
Taste is of the same and very delicious with a touch of caramel standing out.
Mouthfeel is slightly sugary and mildly piney, woody, and candy.
Drinkability is decent with some ABV that's noticable. 538 charactersweeare138, May 04, 2006

Pours a fuzzy light golden amber with a decent head and lacing here and there down the glass. Aroma is floral with hops, grapefruit.. my favorite smell.. and piny as the hops dominate. Taste is likewise, and I'm not complaining, and covers up the ABV... 11%!... good mouth. I want to bring a case home!

4.12/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5thx george
glowing orange and clear in my brooklyn snifter. cloudy patterns of bubble haze gather and swirl on the surface. lacing sticks all about the glass... romantic in its appearance.
smells harshly of orange liqueur.. oily alcohol and crystalline caramel sugars. opening of the nostrils allows a steady flow of near-noxious ethyl gases. citrusey and sweet but with consequences. rocket fueled ipa for sure.
feels silky and syrupy.. comforting and warming going down. taste is along the line of behemoth BW, but this beer manages to hop itself into next week and maintain the double ipa thing. a new dimension of hops dominated by orange essence does its best to mask the abv. very little tart grapefruity hops.. this is more sweet, sweet, and sweet fruitiness. nice twist on the style with acidic fresh mcintosh apple skin crispness. some elements of the spicing here are extremely floral, rose and honeysuckle accenting the final product.
this is good, but overall way too huge for my current tastes. that said, i can totally respect its uniqueness and think that despite my personal opinions this is a really fuckin good beer. 1,146 charactersgoodbyeohio, Mar 28, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz bottle obtained via trade with RedwoodGeorge. Thanks for the opportunity... Brewed 1/3/2006, hand-bottled via counter-pressure system 1/19/06.
Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/8" off-white head over the clear light amber brew. Head fades reasonably quickly, with plentiful lacing. Aroma is a twinge of tangerine, and then christmas tree pine aroma that dominates it all. Flavor is as the nose indicates, with a fruitiness upfront that is quickly shouted down by the piney-yet-somewhat-fruity hops explosion. I can feel enamel dripping off my teeth, and it's great! Mouthfeel is amazing, that for all the hops power, it still has discernable flavors, and drinkability is superb for the style, not just another bottle of hops with a grain hull or two for color. Worth the hype. Thank goodness for "George's Unauthorized Home Bottling Project". 863 charactersppoitras, Mar 20, 2006
4.82/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to RedwoodGeorge for this handbottled bomber, counterpressure filled from a keg and sent off to me. Pliny The Younger pours from the bomber an amazingly clear bright orange/peach color with a half inch of frothy bubbly white head on top. Slow carbonation rises up to meet some sticky lacing. Aromas of beautiful, vibrant hop cones attack my senses with bold citrus, grapefruit and pine needle aromas. A sweet, slighty doughy caramel undercurrent is present as well. Quite possibly hop nirvana. Green, leafy, floral and quite simply enchanting. Wow.
First sip brings a rush of intense piney and citric hop oils across the palate. Bitterness establishes itself from the get go as the resinous hops relentlessly attack the palate. The underlying caramel, mildly doughy maltiness does a good job of holding things together. Such an awe inspiring amalgamation of wonderful hop flavors. Green, intense and vibrant, like sucking on a fresh hop cone. One awesomely hoppy, incredibly tasty brew, no doubt about it.
Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied and creamy with the perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is a joy to drink. Honestly, the only hinderance to the drinkability here is the high abv, otherwise I could sit and enjoy this fabulously hoppy brew all day long. A hopheads dream come true, I only hope to have the chance to sample this again someday. Guess it's time to plan that trip to California, so I can sit and adore this one at the source. Russian River strikes again! 1,492 charactersorbitalr0x, Mar 18, 2006

Unbelievable hop aroma, loads of fruit, particular grapefruit and orange. The aroma is very vibrant and fresh, but also extremely dry, emphasis of an enormous and ridiculous dry hop, which we all know Vinnie has trademarked. The body is very rich and full, giving not only malt balance, but a variety of rich malt flavors, especially caramel and toffee, along with a light fruit platter. The hop character is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous, but in such an unbelievably great way. Wow, such a hop monster, but still balanced in a completely maniacal way. 615 charactersCrosling, Mar 13, 2006
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received from the BA's BA, RedwoodGeorge, as part of his recent Home Bottling Project. Thanks a million George for bringing smiles to this hoppy beer lover, along with many others.
Electric tangerine with juicy pineapple edges. The French vanilla canopy is three fingers in height and looks incredibly thick, rich and creamy. There's been very little deflation in the several minutes since the pour and it appears as if the head will last forever. I don't have forever, though, because I'm dying to take a sip. It eventually melts just enough to reveal a thick, sticky coat of lace with a few dots of visible glass. I prefer dirty, hop-flecked DIPAs, but this one is more than superb.
The nose is, without question, one of the best in all of beerdom. I was pretty sure that it would be pure hoppy bliss... and it is. And then some. There's an incandescent, brain-filling explosion of the sweetest, juiciest hops imaginable each time I venture anywhere near the glass. Thankfully, the malt is buried without a trace, allowing the hops to work their incredible, lupulinirific magic. One of the best of all-time.
Pliny The Younger is a gorgeous, unbelievably delicious Double IPA. There's no question in my mind that this style should be all about the hops. Those that favor the caramel malty, more balanced side of the DIPA continuum, edging into barleywine territory, miss the opportunity to brew transcendent, explosively hop-centric beer, the likes of which is sitting before me right now. Make no mistake, this one is all about the hops. And hops. And more hops.
There's a solid, sugar cookie-like maltiness that lays down an unshakable base and provides support for whatever tonnage of hoppage that may be thrown its way. The trick is in laying off any hint of toastedness or caramel-like flavors that would dilute or mask the citric hoppiness. Lightly (and I do mean lightly) brown sugar-crusted candied grapefruit peel abounds, along with a blissful bitterness that is unrelenting in its pithy intensity. 
I may be able to appreciate the slightest hint of bitter orange, but white grapefruit is front, center and side-to-side. I'd love to know what varieties comprise the hop bill, but it's pretty obvious that the best hops in the known universe (one or more of the 4-Cs) are represented in a major way. I just can't get over the liquid candy-like, sweet and bitter, unalloyed nature of the hoppiness. Pliny is everything that you've heard it is and is everything that I hoped it would be.
It's nearly impossible to completely bury a 10.5% ABV, but Russian River has given it a Hurculean effort. I'm not sure that I'd want the alcohol to be completely absent since it provides a power and presence that lets you know that this is a serious beer that must be respected. Hell, I repect it for the flavor alone. Maybe it's my elation at the out-of-this-world taste, but I'm halfway through the bomber and I'm barely feeling it. This is the most drinkable 10.5%'er ever!
The mouthfeel is simply perfect. Mouthfillingly full with an incredible lasting stickiness after the swallow. Lushly sappy is my favorite sort of DIPA mouthfeel and this beer fits that descripton to a 'T'. When it comes to the carbonation, I have to give credit to RedwoodGeorge for the amazing re-bottling effort. I had some qualms that PTY would be over-carbonated, but that hasn't been borne out in the actual drinking. It's perfect: enlivening without being the least bit spritzy, fading to muted by the second half of the bomber.
I held off on contacting RedwoodGeorge for a trade that would have brought me a growler of Pliny The Younger because I knew that I would love this beer more than any other that I've ever had and wanted to experience it in Santa Rosa, as it should (ideally) be experienced. When the opportunity came my way, however, thanks entirely to George's incredible generosity, I just couldn't turn down the chance to try one of the world's best.
Before cracking the crown, I told myself that there was no way I could give perfect scores to a beer that had been re-bottled from a keg, no matter how outstanding. I'm glad to report that I was wrong. Pliny The Younger is a remarkable beer that transcends any attempt on my part to put its magnificence into words. I still plan to make it out to Santa Rosa some day. When I do, I'm going to ask the Alstroms to come up with a rating scale that includes sixes, 'cause I'm gonna need 'em. 4,440 charactersBuckeyeNation, Mar 12, 2006

Pours a clear copper colored ale that forms a surprising amount of head in my Duvel tulip glass despite the alcohol level.
Smell is vast quantities of fresh hops, I can tell THAT 3 feet from the glass as I look at it. Big abundant hop aromas here. The first thing that hits your nose is a stiff aroma of bitter oranges and Meyer lemons, a very citrus smelling IPA. Lots of pine and spice scents are in this one. Black pepper, lemon grass, cardamom, fennel. Fruit scents of papaya, mango, pineapple and probably others, this stuff numbs up your sense of smell after a while.
Taste is surprisingly mild at the beginning and is dominated by fruit flavors, peaches, melon and passion fruit at the start. Spicy hops flavors join in next pepper coriander, lemon zest, angostura bitters, and a bit of juniper berry. Quite a tasty beer indeed! 
Mouthfeel is quite good.
A super tasty beer here that I could almost give straight 5s for but I do think Pliny the Elder and Three Floyds Dreadnaught are just a little better. Having said that I will hit this stuff like a starving Mako Shark anywhere I see it offered. Word Class Beer! That sums this up. 1,218 charactersZorro, Mar 04, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I recently had the pleasure of enjoying this lovely beer in a lovely 2 liter Russian River growler. Shared samples with some friends at Bethlehem Brew Works, then revisited it a few days later so I could write about it. 
Appearance was decent- on the first opening, there was a pretty lively fluffy ivory head which faded away after a few minutes, very aromatic. Nice sticky lacing too. The second time there were only a few bubbles on top that went away quickly, but the beer was still far from flat. Color is clear reddish-amber, deep yet bright orange, almost looks like a sunset. Very pretty. 
Smell is Hop-City! A gang of hops smacks you in the face andfills your sinuses and lungs with a strong piny floral hoppiness. Not sure how else to describe it. Just mega-hops. Taste again, it's like drinking a hop-farm, yet this beer is far from bitter. It's really amazing how balanced it is considering how strongly hopped it is. Very floral, and a bit of a wheaty taste, it's just so good, you should just quit reading reviews and go taste it yourself. Can't really taste the alcohol either. Just extreme hops and almost too balanced it's scary.
Mouthfeel is well-carbonated but a little thick actually, it leaves a sort of hop oil coating on your tongue and throat- this would actually be a good thing to drink of one has a sore throat or a cough, as it's a tad bit syrupy. It would probably clear out your sinuses as well. The finish is very dry though, mouth-puckering and leaving you wanting more more MORE!!! Drinkability is excellent, as it is so hopped yet balanced, and the alcohol doesn't rear its head until it slides down your throat. Then you start to feel quite warm and fuzzy all over, inside and out. I was more than happy to share the wealth of this one but glad I had more to myself too!

4.94/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pliny the Younger made the journey across the country in a 22 oz. bomber, bottled from a 5 liter keg using a counterpressure filler by BA RedwoodGeorge. While the bottling was unofficial, the beer coming out of bomber was in a very good shape. The head was one finger thick, which is a little small for the style, but it did stay put for a good little while. The underlying body was clear pale orange, and well carbonated. The looks were classic DIPA, while aroma took the style up a few notches. The smell was enticingly grapefruity, and peppery, with a very sweet smelling malt backbone. The juiciness of the smell was certainly mouth watering, and the taste did not disappoint. Quite citric and pungent, the hop laden flavor was cut by a lot of malt sweetness. The low perceived bitterness and well hidden alcohol made for an easy to drink brew. The mouthfeel was sticky, minerally, and thick, with a peppercorn zest in the aftertaste. With so much to enjoy in each sip, there was nothing to complain about the time that I had draining my imperial pint. The alcohol only became evident as the beer came near room temperature, but never did it feel like an obtrusive spoilsport. This drank much easier than the 10.5% strength it possessed would have suggested. A craft brewing masterpiece that deserves all the hype it gets. This beer was big, but still in a very delicate state of balance. Muscular, clean, and beautiful, there was none of the sloppy flab in here found in so many big beers. A Charlize Theron among beers. 1,525 charactersrajendra82, Feb 25, 2006
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: A Growler freshly plundered and expertly filled at Hollingshead Deli in Orange this past weekend. 
Appearance: A massive thrupp resounded from the RRBC Growler, only the proper Growler for this one! Hey this is a little darker than I recall from earlier rounds of this one, though that was in Bars and my mind can play tricks on me. Fiercely examined at close quarters with a sober light, this has a soft lush fettered peach skeleton with a nectarine body that exhibits some faded gold wedding ring flashes. Shear white head, rises boldly, it will fight you if you want. Nice off-white lacing and fresh carbonation lend a lively young feel to this one. Gentle swirls reveal the true nature of this brew. A milky mélange settles out to reveal the dogs hoppy bollocks. Hard to knock.
Nose: Mmmm, I just burnt out my Septum..4 lines of Pliny the Younger and thats it. Dilated nostrils and hop oils trickle down the back of my throat. Fresh cut ferociously rubbed hops straight from the vine rubbed in the palms. Ill whiff this one for weeks..least I hope so.
Taste: The bell tolls and I am sure I get my lights punched out way before the ringing in my ears dissipates. The hops are intense, but unlike other hop bombs the overt yet fine-tuned balance is shattering in its perfect balance. The malts lay under the see-saw and act like the ideal fulcrum for the alcohol and bitterness. The piney Pliny has the hoppiness, but its in check, and it just pumps you relentlessly. I love it. 
Mouthfeel: Now youre playing with the Big Boys. A Wolf in Fairies clothing of sorts. Hard but soft. Oh my Grandma, what big hairy balls you have, All the better to fuck you senseless with my dear.. This one will get you, even if you aint wearing a red hood. 
Drinkability: Half the Growler has gone and its getting to 1pm, I better leave the rest of this one for later..no I really should,..I must not drink any morework tomorrowGrowler back in fridge..must go to Bed..dont clean teethtaste and dream HOPS..I am so fucking tempted to drain this Growler and take a day off work tomorrow!! Whats the bet that I wake up on the Sofa at 5am with an empty Growler!?
Overall: My first Review of this marvel was for a Pub based experience, far from accurate I am sure, but I just wanted to record and portray the experience rather than the technicalities. But now, sat at home with my very own Russian River Growler that started life with Deification barely 6 weeks ago, it is now staring at me like a corner-hanging panty waving crack whore touting for business. I cant think of anything except, what is wrong with this, what could be better?! (The beer that is not the whore). Well, it could be easier to get a hold of for a start, and, erm, well thats it. Im sure this has just got better since I last tried it too.
Perfect!? I.think..so..but why do I feel reluctant when I type that? Perhaps because it means the end of a beer journey in a way maybe!? Well not quite, Im sure that todays 5.0 will be tomorrows 4.75 when the next marvelous Ambrosia to come out of Santa Rosa appears and realigns the envelope. Change is the only constant, but right now Id settle for this being a constant in my life.

5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5To me, this is the perfect beer. I've since had 7 growlers of it from Hollingshead and am finally reviewing.
A - a rich honeyish amber color with a little apricot with a creamy smallish egg white head. Many little buggles dance in my goblet.
S - solid wall of floral pine assail my nose. Very crisp and present aroma that opens up as the beer warms down a bit. Scent does punch you in the nose in a good teasing way... oh this teasing.
T - the scent segues to a delicious meadow of flowery citrus that says hops, pine and grapefruit live here. Enter if you dare, and you do. Strongly hopped but remarkably balanced per se. The malt backbone allows the hops to really shine, like salt added to cookie dough. There is a faint hint of alcohol that is hidden very well so watch out.
M&Dr - nicely carbonated and a bit viscous, ambrosia i say. This is one aggressive beer not for the faint hearted and definitely meant to be appreciated. Sip this with delight. 961 charactersSwillinBrew, Feb 09, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Was very pleased to find this at a favorite little place of ours, Pleasantons Main Street Brewery. Nice crysal clear light amber color was topped by a nice white head that retained well and left nice patterns of lace. Aroma, hops hops and more hops. Very piney and inviting. Taste, very hoppy with emphasis on the pine, fantastic freash taste and very smooth despite the high bittering. Not thick and viscous like some other beers of theis type can be. How can I give a average drinkability score to a beer that tastes exceptional? Well I don't think beers in the 11% realm are the kind you sit around and knock back. This is a great beer but I don't look to get ripped on one brew. 682 charactersMark, Feb 05, 2006
4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Tasted on tap 1/28/06 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. $4.50 for a 25 cl "half" order.
Pours a rich full deep golden orange that looks very syrupy. A very slight bit of bubbles cling for dear life at the top.
This is one well constructed beer. I went in expecting a hop bomb overload that would blow its uncle Pliny the Elder (check your Roman history for their relationship) hoppiness out of the water. I was wrong. This still has a huge strong fruity hop profile, but it is well balanced by a solid malt underpinning, with brandy-like qualities. 
This is one of those dangerous beers- a sipper that is really easy to drink right down. Alcohol is nicely present, but oh-so hidden. Watch out!
A very good beer. To be honest, I like the Elder better, but that's just personal taste- this is one incredible beer. 825 charactersDukeofearl, Jan 29, 2006
4.73/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got a sample of the all mighty "Younger" from the Liar's Club in Mission Beach @$2.75 a glass, can't beat it.
Poured in a snifter, dark orange amber color with an awesome creamy white head that reduces to a nice thin layer of white. The ceamy white lacing paints the inside of my glass as I sip. Moderate carbonation.
Very nice aroma of caramel malts and tons of grassy/citrusy/pine hops.
Really very nice taste! Sweet caramel malt sweetness and an awesome grapefruit rind bitterness. This brew is so drinkably smooth I cannot believe it, alcoholic brand flavor really stands out. Younger leaves a lip smacking pine tar dryness on the palate.
Thick and syrupy texture.
Awesome brew, very balanced, the high alcohol level is very warming. I wish I could get this more regularly.
Cheers! 799 charactersSteveO1231, Jan 22, 2006
4.55/5  rDev -2.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4After months of patience, I finally got the chance to try this fine beer. I had it on tap at the Liars Club. All I can say is wow.
This beer pours a golden yellow with a thick fluffy off white head. The head fades slowly leaving thick laces all around the glass.
This beer has a hoppy aroma, but it is n ot overbearing like similar beers. I was surprised at how balanced the aroma was. It smells grassy. Also, I can detect a citurs aroma. A very slight piney aroma mixes in making this beer smell incredable.
This beer has a grassy hoppy flavor. It tastes hoppier than it smells. It has a plesent citrus, grapefruitlike flavor to it. It also has a strong piney flavor. I can detect some alcohol flavor in the finish. 
This beer is very full bodied. It has a very aggressive, yet also quite pleasent flavor. It is carbonated well. It leaves a grassy aftertaste.
I dont know how good of a session beer this would make. 11% ABV is a little high. Also, the flavor is quite aggressive. I am sad that I am not at the Liar's Club still to drink some more. I hope to get another chance to sample this beer again soon. 1,124 charactersOStrungT, Jan 22, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4appearance: that's a fine looking glass of beer, that can't be denied. Pours a nice pale, slightly amber color. That is some haziness to it, the hoppier the beer the more hazy. poured in to a pair of pint glasses to share with my dad. that head stayed along time.
smell: volumes and volumes and volumes of hop aroma. However, it doesn't really smell all that different than the standard Russian River IPA or Pliny the Elder for that matter. 
taste: well, i ate a small dinner and i can feel a buzz with one sip. You can taste the hop fiber, alcohol, more hop flavor. There is alot of bitterness, more than the elder by far. The bitterness drowns out more of the flavor, however, there is still quite a bit of hop flavor in this sucker. If there was something like hop jucie this is. This tastes as close to "beer" as lambic does, if you get my drift. over the course of a pint i warmed to this beer more and more and it's not as bitter as some other beers i've had, again more hoppy than bitter. 
mouthfeel: you can actually feel the coursness of hops in the mouthfeel. While that is probably an illision, to say that this beer is syurpy, would be an understatment. 
drinkabiliy: it's a sipper, but i'd imagine most triple ipa's would be.
My quest for the hoppest beer in the world ends here.(come to think of it i wasn't really on a quest, but i degress) However, this isn't really a beer I'd like to have that often really. Pliny the Elder is far more drinkable, and is just an all around more balanced great beer. I know this beer is a hop showcase, but I think just a hair more "oumpf" in the malt deparment would improve it. Still what can I say, if you see it you'll no doubt grab a growler, although a growler is sure alot of this beer, i would recomind enjoying this beer very, very slowly 1,812 characterspjwilson, Jan 17, 2006
4.47/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a golden color with a nice head that falls quickly but leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very well balanced with the high level of hops and maltiness. Smells very nice. The flavor is much the same. Very hoppy and resiny, but the malt backing is just right to make it very well balanced. Finish is very bitter. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkability is very good for the abv. 410 charactersclvand0, Dec 10, 2005
4.4/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served on tap at the Brickskeller in DC in a pint glass. Cellar temps, to boot.
Appearance: What the heck, it's actually pale!!! Honey golden yellow. Slightly hazy, but I'd still call this clear if pressed. Head is not overly present, but the barkeep apparently felt a full pour was warranted given the price ($7 per glass). Frankly, can't say I blame her. What head there was dissapated to a film and left decent amounts of lacing on the glass. Extra special kudos for actually being yellow, only impressive given what follows.
Smell: Honeysuckle-like floral aromas mixed with a heady amount of apricots. Sappy woodsy/earthiness underneath that. Some yeasty phenols lurking around. Overall, a hearty dose of tropicalia. Hoppy, but not. Yeasty, but not. Malty, but not. Stank and dank. Heady.
Taste: Honey-like sweetness for a brief instant, then smashed - Hulk-like - by piney bitterness. Alcohol and tropical citrus on the long lasting finish. Grainy malts with grassy hops on the extreme end (like, 50 seconds after a sip). 
Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light, given both the style and the ABV. What the heck was that again? 11%? You gotta be kidding me...While you know this is boozy by the slight burn, you wouldn't think it's that high.
Drinkability: I feel like I've quaffed some cross between the movie "What the *BLEEEP* Do We Know?" and the book, "Gödel, Escher, Bach." I just faced an onslaught - verging on a cacophony - of malts, hops and yeast. Hops eked out, barely, over the others. I can't honestly say I got the intent, or the entire point, but gawdamn do I think that this is the epitome of extreme beer. All other claimants, while possibly good/great, are just some other beer or beer style turned up to 11. This is something else entirely. Possibly something new under the sun. 
I'm still confoozled. Maybe a few more pints will help me figure things out... 1,892 charactersManekiNeko, Dec 01, 2005
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Kmpitz2 for sharing his growler...I wouldn't have done it for him. This beer is just too good. I have often criticized Double IPA's for trying to acheive balance when IPA's are supposed to be completely out of balance. This beer taught me better. Sweet and bitter can come together in a great IPA. The look is solid but to be expected straw, golden with a haze and incredible head retention. Aroma is bitter and hop flavored solidly, but not to knock your socks off. A boquet of hops is the fullest and roundest that I have had without intimidation. The flavor is a combination of sweet malts that hinge on confectionate sugar and cotton candy with a yeasty (almost musky) aura about it that adds much complexity. The hops give tremendous, but not sharp, bittering and pine, oak, nut, ginger, nutmeg, and pepper flavors. The carbonation always kept the beer soft and creamy. Never prickley or hot. Finishes a combined sweet and bitter. Not as drying as you'd think. The high alcohols hit only in the aftertaste and never become fusal or too sweet. This is truely and ideal beer. 1,088 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 28, 2005

Nose is sweet and hoppy. Citrusy sweet with a nice caramel background. Light notes of earthyness from the hop. Decent spun sugar sweetness. Very enticing IIPA. Flavor is all about balance. Citrusy hop and deep sweet caramel malt blast initially, with just a touch of earthyness from hop. It fades to a mellow caramel sweetness and moderate, but very calm and mellow bitter on the finish. Wow. Everything is in awesome harmony. Feel is thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Bitter hangs on just long enough to beckon me back in. Burps are also all about the balance...sweet and hoppy. Drinkability is way too good on this one. Just looked and saw the 11% and I don't believe it. Hot damn. I am very pleased with this to say the least. 859 characterskmpitz2, Nov 23, 2005

Also thanks to Lou91 for bringing this from Cali! 2L growler poured into a snifter. It pours a hazy medium orange color with two fingers of head. There's a decent amount of lacing. The smell is pure hop juice. Hop oil is what you get here! I'm lovin' every bit. If I knew what heroin was like, this would probably be damn close. The taste is also chock full of hops. The maltiness is there just enough to hold the beer together, but the hops shine through. No alcohol in sight, it's unreal. The mouthfeel is so thick and heavy. Just wow. The drinkability is beyond all awesomeness. I cannot believe this is an 11% brew. Lies I tell you! All lies!!! A really really fantastic beer. 723 charactersSheepNutz, Nov 23, 2005
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was lucky enough to have a friend bring me a growler of this, last month after a trip to Northern California. Immediately after opening the growler the hop punch hit me. A bouquet of hops almost overwhelm me. It poured a golden haze while the aroma continued to permeate my senses. The balanced foam head filled out what looked to be a picturebook painting of what a pint should look like. The scents still swimming around my nose: piney, gorgeous hops with a slight citrus undertone. It was a complex aroma that was truly remarkable. 
My first sip completed everything. The aroma perfectedly made its way to the taste: it was a complex delight of many flavors, including a slight sweetness. The mouthfeel was a bit creamy, well carbonated but decidedly easy drinking for its 11% ABV.
This is as closed to a perfect beer as it can come, possibly the best beer Ive ever had. 887 characterssloejams, Nov 21, 2005
4.2/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Mostly diminishing, but initially generous white head takes position above a straight golden body. Extremely complex hops nose hints at most nuances you can think of, all ahead prefumey and piney, but underneath hinting at a broad range of citrus fruits, leafy and minty in nature. Might gain a bit from being less liquorous, but this nose is truly fantastic, magical hoppiness Id dare say, with maltiness being certainly felt if not exactly managing to show any flavours all the way through the hops. Palate is oily, full, slick, tannic and liquorous, hence surprisingly sweet, but it works thanks to a controlled level of citric acidity. 641 charactersRastacouere, Nov 08, 2005
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Growler split between a few people. Crystal clear golden orange body with a tall off white foamy head. Sticky and clumpy lacing galore. Huge hoppy as hell aroma that is spectacular. Pine and citric hops just bombard your nose. Some nice floral hops in there as well. Very light sweetness in the nose that seems to be just enough to make it seem balanced even though this is overflowing with hoppy goodness. The flavor is packed full of hop goodness. Very juicy with hops and it has a good amount of the hop sweetness that I taste in 120 minute but without going overboard. Citric, pine and floral earthy flavors are there in abundance. Pretty much hop juice is the way I would describe it. Its fairly bitter but not to the point of being a palette destroyer. Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth for the strength and the hoppiness. Just the right amount of body to it. No alcohol to be found anywhere. It couldnt be any more drinkable, it almost went down like water. While most of my other favorite double IPAs are the smack you around and rip your tongue out kind this one manages to be a super refined and smooth hop bomb that managed to stay balanced and still hoppy as hell. 1,179 charactersmeathookjones, Oct 20, 2005
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge-ass growler courtesy of RedwoodGeorge. You are a prince among men.
Pours a hazy coppery color with a very nice, thick, almost injection molded, pure white head. Lacing and retention are both spectacular. This beer just screams drink me from the moment it hits the glass.
Smell is a hop head's wet dream. Nothing but hops, pure, unadulterated hop aroma. Well balanced and just superb. Piny, citrusy, and just a bit earthy. Some alcohol in the nose, but at 11% it's not surprising. Everything is balanced out nicely with just a hint of toffee.
Taste, again, is just amazing. This is hop juice pure and simple. What starts off slightly sweet, and a little caramelly, easly blends into a piny, bitter and downright great taste. Loads of hops in this one, that's for sure, and yet it doesn't seem overdone. I've had some DIPAs that are just acrid with hops where as this beer blends everything together so nicely it's hard to find fault. There is, of course, a slight (very slight) alcohol warming sensation as this one goes gleefully down my throat.
Mouthfeel is just what I want from a DIPA, not tooth enamel stripping, but not something that is going to feel like water going down. With the amount of hops in this it's amazing that the former isn't the case.
Drinkability is insane for the alcohol content. I could easily drink this beer all night and not have any complaints. Of course, the next morning might be a problem, but I'm sure it would be a fun night.
Overall, this is easily one of the best IPAs if not one of the best beers I've ever had. It stands to style, and takes it just one or 10 steps further than you would have thought possible. An impeccable beer from an even more impeccable brewery. 1,719 charactersLuckySevens82, Oct 01, 2005
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks go to RedwoodGeorge for this wonderful fresh 67.6 oz/ 2 liters of pure heaven on earth.
This baby pours a lightly hazy peach color with a nice fluffy white two finger sized head, leaves lots of lace web down my glass. For an 11% brew this nice big head was not expected but is wonderful. The growler itself is great the coolest looking growler I have seen.
Aroma is holy cow wet sticky fresh from the vine hops. Fresh pine tree dripping sticky sap all wraped in grapefruit rinds. Like sticking your head in a barrel of fresh hop. There is some bready malt underneath along with hints of spiciness. If you love hops this is for you, I have never smelled anything this good, strong and fresh before.
Taste is big full huge amounts of hops very nice lots of juicey flavors fruity and piney tingle the taste buds. Man its like chewing on fresh hops how does Vinnie get so much hop flavor in this one? Its like randalized beer without the green stuff in your teeth. OK all these hops and you would think just tounge numbing bitterness but no, it is bitter but more balanced then should be possible.There is a lingering grapefruit bitterness with hints of pine but nice bready malt base does come thru and adds some sweetness also some spice shows up but probably coming from the huge amount of hops. This one truly is a triple IPA unlike the other triple IPA that tastes more like a barley wine, nothing against Devil Dancer but this is the shit here. This is the big IIPA all should be judged by.
Mouthfeel is nice smooth big almost creamy but a little to much carbonation for creamy. The carbonation adds a touch of zest to the hops. You can almost feel the hop oils rolling over your tounge.
Drinkability is beyond great, where the hell is the 11% well after a few pours I know its there and didn't finish my growler in one night so it will kick your ass atleast for a light weight like me but you will not know it until you get up. The only thing hurting drinkability here is having to go to Santa Rosa to get more. Vinnie can you please bottle this and send some to the Vintage Cellar. I have rated one other beer a 5.0 but that was probably a mistake, no mistake here you want the best triple IPA, or double as stylized by BA, then this is the one to rule them all. Again want to thank RedwoodGeorge for this one. 2,341 charactersmntlover, Sep 25, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ap: Hazy straw color, nice white head, fades pretty quickly, but hangs on exceptionally long for an 11% ABV brew. Collar remains indefinitely. Bubbles rise to the surface at a slow pace due to the apparent viscosity of this big brew. 
Aroma: Huge resinous, ammonia-amped hop aroma. Fat, deep malts also evident. Fusel alcohol is also evident, but restrained. A gem on the nose for hopheads. Bristling with resins, pine and agro-grapefruit skins.
Taste: Fantastically big hop flavor slams the palate, but still, this is restrained when compared to their IPA or even Pliny the Elder, their double IPA. Vinnie Cirluzo is credited in some circles as the father of the double IPA, and this massive brew is billed as a triple IPA. Like the truly well done bourbons and cognacs out there, this big beer is smooth and quite elegant and deceptively potent. 
Finish: Tight, drying bitterness is big, but there is actually a hefty malt backbone that somehow manages to support the huge hop load. Finishes with tons of resinous pine and hop-sap flavors with almost cloying malt and hop sweetness. Beautiful indeed.
Misc: Surprisingly easy to drink considering the hop and ABV content. I paid $26.75 for the original growler (had to buy one to fill), but couldnt afford the weight on my flight home so had to have it mailed to me for what turned out to be an unexpectedly whopping $60. So, all told, for $86.75 for the growler, Im taking my time sipping it. Thankfully the growler has a swivel-top clamp that makes for easy resealing. The most expensive brew Ive purchased considering, but still, Im gonna say its worth it to have this one in my fridge. A true indulgence and an absolute must for the hardcore hopheads out there. Genius in a bottle. I was so ridiculously jealous of the local Santa Rosans who can just walk in and order a 10-oz serving of this beer any time they want (though it's plainly stated that they're restricted to no more than 3 of the higher ABV beers per night). Lucky bastards! Service at the pub was fantastic and the gourmet pizzas were very nicely done. 2,094 charactersAdvocateFan, Sep 22, 2005
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Used 5 tickets to sample at the ABF. This is a combining of the notes I took each time..
How'd it look?: hazy honey yellow body with frothy head.
Olfactory Rating: Foresty Citrus Fresh Baked Sweet Bread. This beer is almost as confusing in the amount of smells it provides as any I've sampled. Was first, third, fifith, and then seventh and eigth samples I tried Friday night. Glad I tried it so many times up front, as it was gone fairly fast, and I could smell more layers in the beer than I might have later on.
Taste Buds say: sweet, almost amzingly so, as the nose doesn't hint that is the first thing you'll taste. Malt sits up front and Vinnie's use of sugar in the brews to up alch % and add sweetness comes through. Then, the hops explode - and the alchohol slowly works it way down the throat. The hops are almost like chewing on a piece of grapefruit covered in pine tar. Very intense, and the only other beer I've had that compares, is Dreadnaught. Alch flavor is there, but not highly present. Simply stunned, these taste buds are.
Mouthfeel: Very rich taste, covers the tongue, and attaches to the top of the palette.
Despite an 11% abv...this is one drinkable beer.
Finally found my notes from that weekend in Boston and am adding in reviews as I can. 1,284 characterslostbearbrew, Aug 24, 2005

appearance - nice warm golden color, with a decent head that retained it self through the serving ( I drink pretty fast), mild carbonation,
smell: like being in a pine tree forest, with david the nome 
taste: amazingly smooth, not as rough as the elder, can't believe that this is an 11% abv, until I stood up from my third glass, I saw pixies fly around my head. It had a great finish that was silky smooth with hoppy tones and some pale malty notes, cabonation was light and didn't effect the taste much
overall, one of my favorite west coast ipa's, would be a great compliment to anything salty. which I was enjoying ribs and buffalo wings at the time. it wasn't to filling so you could down several before the alcohol got to you.
If you get a chance to come to san francisco make the journey north to russian river for the some of the best west coast brews. 978 charactersbrewbacca, Aug 16, 2005

It pours an amazing orange-hued amber with a medium-sized off-white head and a smattering of patchy lacing.
The aroma is certainly the high point of this brew, though the rest ain't bad either! A smell reminiscent of a fresh cut blue spruce comes to mind. Smells of citrusy grapefruit, orange and lemon zest is direct and potent. A sweet malty smell lingers through. A light perfumy rum alcohol aroma rises from the depths.
A solid, slightly sweet, almost oily doughy malt body lies a firm foundation for all the varied hop tastes to dance and frolic about. Bitter orange, pink grapefruit, essence of pink and floral hop flavors abound. A taste of over-ripe pears and hint of cherries in cream is noticed.
A rich golden rum fuminess releases in the exhale.
This is a really decadent and flavorful brew! 854 charactersBeerResearcher, Jul 30, 2005

Appearance. Perfect 3/4 inch head that maintains itself throughout. Dark brown/amber color. Very inviting.
The smell and the taste are identical in my opinion what you smell is what you get. Aromatic, fruity but not overpowering. The taste is a beautiful blend of hops. Its bold up front but once again a perfect balance. Finishes dry with just a touch of malt sweetness left behind.
Mild carbonation and a deep warm feeling in the gut adds to this well crafted brew. Drinkability is off the charts. If I ever get the chance to buy this by the palett count me in. 743 charactersDogFood11, Jul 03, 2005
4.87/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Sampled (a few times!) at the ABF. One of a very select few beers I bothered to review while attending the ABF. Pliny The Younger was served up at the VIP session of the ABF.
Appearance: cloudy honey color topped with a dense white head. head displayed amazing durability and left much gummy lace, enough that I had to completely wash my glass afterward. The lace refused to get off my glass! Tenacious stuff!
Nose: big juicy citrusy hops aroma. Nice fruity notes (tropical in nature) and doughy malts in supporting roles offer a pleasing balance to the massive grapefruit and tangerine rind hops aroma.
Taste: starts off with a deceptively sweet offering of light caramel, bready malt, and hints of mango, pineapple and papayas. Those flavors don't last long, however, before the heavy load of juicy, resinous hops oils brush the sweetness aside. Tons of grapefruit peels, lesser notes of pine sap and even less alcohol simply take hold and linger long after each swallow.
Feel: full, creamy and almost a bit chewy.
Overall: just an ungodly good double IPA!! This is an 11% ABV beer - hard to believe and that just makes it all the more dangerous. Simply a can't-miss beer. Find it, drink it. You will enjoy it, guaranteed. 1,239 charactersBoilermaker88, Jun 27, 2005

This one was a nice clear dark honey yellow- with a decent head on top. Very nice...and a harbinger of good things to come. The smell? Hoppity hoppity hops. What more could a guy want?
The first sip revealed a nice underlying sweetness, topped by a hearty hoppiness. There were some fruity notes as well- with apple, pineapple, and a hint of papaya. There was a bit of alcohol fume, as well.
The body also had a bit of alcohol on it- but it was overall just slightly syrupy.
This beer was heartier than expected- and very pleasantly so! I look forward to my next encounter with the immensely palatable Pliny!
Be well

Beer had an awesome, pillowy head on top. 
Aroma? Fuggedaboutit. Massive quantities of west-coast hops. Citrus fruit, anyone?
Aggressive hop flavor, but well balanced for such a light color. Outstanding.
Medium bodied, but not syrup given the strength.
Overall, very drinkable given it's strength and hop flavor. 376 charactersSixpoint, Jun 19, 2005
4.92/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler imported by brewandbbq from the sacred hop grounds of Russian River . . .
This is truly a hophead's delight. The light color seems to suggest a pils or a tripel, but it is truly a Triple IPA. The nose exudes pungent grapefruit, juicyfruit gum, pine sap, cotton candy, and citrus galore. The taste matches the smell. Each sip revealed a new layer of hoppy goodness, and the full-on hop assault pummelled my palate into submission. Despite the intense hoppiness, Pliny struck a balance between bitterness and malty sweetness. It lived up to the hype. I could drink pint after pint until I fall off my stool onto the floor. Man, does it go down easy for an 11% ABV ale. 
Thank you, Vinnie, may I have another . . . 739 charactersHopasaurusRex, Jun 13, 2005
4.77/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured light gold and hazy from the growler, white, rocky head with a myriad of different sized bubbles. Quickly settled down to a thin whisp of carbonation.
Pungent in the nose, but not overwhelming.
First try at the brewpub, I figured it was because of the 10oz glass, but this time in a goblet.
Delectable aromatics. Alcohol steeped hops and fruit.
Melons, pears, peaches, tangerines, drizzled with candied pine sap. A bit nose clearing with the rich alcohol. A true hop cocktail.
Light to medium in the body and slightly numbing on the pallet.
Zesty hop attack has a nice drying quality that offsets the residual sugars.
Bitterness is not overbearing, with the majority of lupulus being in the flavoring.
Juicy, stickey, and slightly chewy. Filled with loads of lush pine infused citrus fruits.
Malt is light and a mere shadow in this brew.
Finishes long and balanced, with lingering honey, spruce, and a hint of Grand Marnier.
A beautifully balanced beer for such a hop monster. Very approachable and alcohol well hidden.
Revisit 2/16/10..Growler also.
Clear gold body with a white head. Plenty of sticky head when agitated.
Aromatics are laced with skunky kind-bud, onion skin, garlic, and fruit loops following through. Not screamingly pungent, but very resinous and dank.
Medium bodied and crisp. Tacky mouthfeel with a slight chew.
Juicy, earthy, resinous hops start the palate, with light malt following through and a pleasant bitterness. Alcohol is a mere afterthought. A blend of pine, garlic, grapefruit, and a hint of tropical fruits.
After five years of just a memory, it's good to revisit PTY. Not as tropical as I remember, and heavier on the dank, garlicy Columbus hops. Very dry and not over-the-top hoppy. 1,731 charactersbrewandbbq, Jun 12, 2005
4.75/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5once poured from the growler, the brew slipped over the lip of the pint, and I had to suck up some...pre-inspection, I'm wowed by this beer! Holy dribble cup, Batman!
Clear golden/ pale peach appearance, with an excellent cup of lacey, snow -white froth on top. Very attractive IPA, so far.
Nose is all pine, hints of pineapple and other tropical fruit, pineapple, peach, apricot, banana, lemon...braces of bitterness, but all of it pleasing to the hophead. Just heavenly!
Taste: all those good things and more, the tropical and citric fruit blaze over the palate, bright and luscious, hoppy, bitter, but overwhelmingly pleasant and tasty...the extra liquor doesn't click in right away, but makes itself felt eventually...11%?? Hooo, daddy!
There's enough malt here that it's not a raw hop blitzkrieg overpowering anything else in the brew, but hops are king here, as if there were ever any doubt. Damn, Zam-Bam-A-Lam!! this is a true killer-diller, not for the weak of heart or palate!
much thanks to Axisjones for the growler! 1,045 charactersfeloniousmonk, Apr 12, 2005
4/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at O'Briens. Served in 10oz glasses. (2nd batch)
This beer had a tiny layer of foam that receded quickly, as expected for such a huge brew. Deep golden color with a touch of haziness. Lots of citrus in the nose but I would call it moderate -- less than the aroma I get off the Elder. Crisp on the tongue at first, there is a moderate hop bitterness of grapefruit, citrus, and something different from Pliny the Elder. Hmmm... Can't describe it. Malt is present but again doesn't knock my socks off... unlike the alcohol, which did. Rather, I didn't taste the alcohol but I certainly felt it very quickly. 
I really need to try this again. It was somewhat of a letdown, but then again, 1) no beer could live up to the hype that this "triple IPA" got, 2) small glass may have limited aroma dispersal, 3) I developed a bad headache after drinking it, possible from being dehyrdated and then going for a highly alcoholic beer (I doubt it was a reaction to the Younger), and 4) I've been on such a double IPA spree lately that my tongue was probably a little dead to the hoppiness of the Younger. Regardless, I owe the Younger another chance. 1,150 charactersoggg, Apr 10, 2005
4.97/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a clean light orange with a nice fluffy head. Laces all the way down. This smells like hops. Hops, hops, and more hops- it has the signature cascade piney hop smell, very citrusy. This is what God must drink when he wants an IPA. Massive hops, but very very smooth. Whereas some IIPAs are over the top and almost undrinkable, this 3IPA is bitter but very flavorful, with fruity notes and floral-piney-citrus-juicy taste with a clean bitterness in the back. Its well balanced and not overly extreme. The drinkability is high. Too high. So high in fact, that the bartender (who knows me very well) warned me that it would go down easy for an 11% brew. I could not taste a single % of that 11. I could drink this all night, but that would probably result in alcohol poisoning. 
Overall, an outstanding IIPA, probably the best I have had. Drink at your own risk though. 873 charactersaxisjones, Mar 15, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at the Russian River Brewing Company...
The brew is a deep straw-yellow in color with a boatload of very tiny bubbles. The head is a pure-white, light and fluffy with a very fine grain. The brew didn't stick around long enough to judge head retention but it did leave plenty of lacing on the glass.
The aroma was certainly inviting - plenty of hops with a nice mix of grassy and citrus notes. The taste was pure ambrosia - plenty of strong hop notes and yet not the least bit bitter. What impressed me about the Elder holds true for the Younger as well - the smoothness is astounding. You'd think that a brew with this much hopping would taste like paint remover but it's smoooth. The primary hop tastes are grass and grapefruit with much lighter notes of herb and flowers. There is actually a mild malt undertone, a clean, 'bready' taste that compliments the major flavors.
As for the 11% ABV: for a while I thought Vinnie might be fibbing a bit - there's no alcohol 'burn' to this brew. No alcohol taste at all, really. Of course, as you stagger away from the bar you realized there was ethanol hidden in there somewhere. My theory is that it somehow helps smooth out the hop bite without adding a sweet note.
Mouthfeel is mind boggling - again, you'd expect an extreme beer like this leave your lips numb, your teeth stripped of enamel and your tongue curled up like a smoked whitefish but this isn't the case. There's no heavy coating on the tongue, the very fine carbonation leaves a very clean, clear palate. This brew has an almost velvety feel on the way down.
Drinkability? Is it even worth discussing? If I were to walk into a bar and this were available, I wouldn't look any further down the board. With the possible exception of Pliny the Elder there may be no other beer that compares. 1,820 charactersRedwoodGeorge, Mar 10, 2005
4.59/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance  This one came out a deep, rich orange in color with a monster head that just refused to go down.
Smell  Oh, shit, this is da hop bomb. Ive had some pretty big hoppy beers before, to include The Chunks that requires a strainer to drink, but this thing was just huge.
Every hop, and I mean EVERY hop, that I have ever had is in this nose. The grapefruit, the citrus, the rare Simcoe, East Coast Amarillo, giant PacNW pine sap, huge monster citrus, big floral, and anything else you can think of it in this bouquet. Oh, and theres a huge, monstrous super-sugary caramel malt sweetness here as well.
Taste  This is a sledgehammer made of hops striking down on the head of the barstool-affixed patron. Its not unexpected though, because this is one of their best-selling beers.
The complex hops from the nose hit hard and mercilessly at the taste. This really is like liquid hop syrup, and if youre a hophead looking for the next, biggest hop fix than the buck stops here. It really doesnt get any bigger than this.
Mouthfeel  This full-bodied hop bomb is a meal in itself. Interestingly, the huge sugary caramel-infused malt balance keeps this one from being extra bitter, although significant bitterness is present.
Drinkability  If The Ruination is a delicate ballerina floating on the DAIPA stage, this is a steroid-using 260 pound female bodybuilder whoopin your ass. But man oh man is this good. Somebody tried to take a sip from my glass but I knocked them out into the street. I think it was my mama.
Comments  Vinnie the brewer said that he cant run Pliny The Younger with Pliny The Elder because The Elder tap gets stale. The Younger is the clear patrons choice.
He gave me the run down on the hopping of this beer, but I cant begin to remember it all. He adds a complex mix of hops at four different stages of the brewing cycle then dry-hops the beer four times with varying mixes of hops. Theres an emphasis on Amarillo and Cascade, but he has everything in here from Centennial to Simcoe to all else in between.
The beauty of this concoction is that he got it so hoppy. He did it in stages, because at some point you can keep adding hops but the IBUs dont change and you cant really taste them. It really is a work of art and an amazing accomplishment from an excellent brewer. Cheers! 2,372 charactersRoyalT, Mar 08, 2005

Wow - did Russian River figure out how to ferment straight hops? Poured a lighter color than the Elder - looks like a pale ale. Great head, nice lacing all the way down the glass. Definitely none of the balance and subtley of the Elder - this is hop juice, pure and simple. Absolutely unbelievable that this is 11 % - smooth and not a hint of harshness. 388 charactersrowew, Feb 27, 2005

Big resinous grapefruit rind aroma. Floral and perfumey with some malt and a bit of caramel. 
Sweet floral tastes. Lots of sweet malt with toffee undertones helps balance the inpending hop onslaught. Does a good job of it too.The hop profile came in fresh and floral with citrus rind & juice flavors, a bit of pepper and hints of pineapple and vanilla in the finish. Great balance and the alcohol was almost non existent. It was almost on the verge of being a little cloying. Absolutely a glassful of nectar!
Medium bodied with a velvety smooth, creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel. Perfect!
Exceptional, almost laughable drinkability for such a huge beer.
If you find it...try it! Highly recommended. 803 charactersrkhaze, Feb 02, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served at Naja's, Redondo Beach in 8oz. (owner approved) servings and unlimited at O'Brien's, San Diego in 10oz sevings. When first in posession of this beer, I had NO idea what a triple IPA was supposed to taste like. I thought maybe a Dogfish Head 120 or a Rogue I2PA? No. This beer is amazing in color, smell, taste and drinkability. I've tried pretty much every Double IPA that I could get my hands on and I was convinced that a tie between PizzaPort's: Frank and Pliny the Elder was fair. Those are GREAT beers but Younger follows after Elder and is simply astonishing and amazingly well balanced.
At first smell, I was hit with a huge appearance of citrus scent and pine. The first taste could be described as biting into a sweet grapefruit, then getting hit in the face with a pine tree branch. Four hopheads standing around a table taking the first sip for the first time and eight eyeballs have never been so wide! The taste lingers forever then you put it down for ten minutes and wait. After a change of shorts, tasting this beer every ten minutes for about an hour sends you through an experience that is uncomprehendable. By the last sip, you are tasting a totally different beer. I wanted to heat it up and see what it would do. Mouthfeel is so smooth but powerful, and when swallowed, one is amazed at the balance acheived by Mr. Cilerzo running an 11% triple IPA through your brain. You think: "No way!"
In all, I would say I've tried the best beer that exists on the planet. There must be three times the hops in here than Elder. Vinnie Cilerzo is a beer God! 1,582 charactersLongBeachHopHead, Feb 01, 2005
5/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is not beer, it is hop juice. That said, it is the tastiest thing I have ever put in my mouth. Had on tap at Lucky Baldwins.
Appearance: Pale ale color, nice dense head. Sheet after sheet of lacing.
Smell: Massive orange juice aroma.
Taste: orange rinds on a big bed of malt. There is no noticing the 11% alcohol level. This is perfectly balanced and insanely delicious. Although there is a sweetness to this monster, it is not a sweet beer.
Mouthfeel: light carbonation, silky and delicious. Not a drop of harshness for all the long lasting and beautiful hoppiness.
I had a Avec Bons Les Vouex afterwards and could barely taste it. I could sell my soul for this. 683 charactersNaerhu, Jan 31, 2005
4.61/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A stout, small top covers up the ruby-tinted, dry and sticky orange frosted body. Nose is sweet constantness in a mighty, floral hop blast.
Taste manages to be huge without knocking out considerations of balance or drinkability -- which is something any beer can hope for. Spiced fire pine-sol blisters the throat in sweet, floral hop gratiness to the point of a hop pollen explosion, of bitter, poison berry. My eye started twitching with the intensity...
Yet there's an edge of fruitiness, of fruit juice complexity, of watermelon and peaches, that adds to balance the brew. After is barely dry, and just enough to compensate the fruitiness and represent the nose and IPA character. A greatly put-together brew that seems somehow subdued and drinkable. 
One of my favorite beers to date. 798 charactersdonnebaby, Jan 31, 2005
4.52/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Billed as a Triple IPA with an ABV of 11.0% according to the taphandle.
Pours orange / copper in color with excellent clarity for an IPA of any type. The nose is seductively fruity sweet with a very strong backdrop of resinous floral hops. 
The foretaste scrubs the front of the tongue with 'just right' carbonation while the hops perform a vise-like grip the full length of the sides of the tongue. Even the midtaste is dominated by the aggressive hopping while the elevated ABV begins to show a warming effect toward the aft of the mouth. The finish is thick with the generous grain bill while the hops begin a slow, slow exit stage right.
Mouthfeel is thick-n-chewy and only the over the top alcohol content reduces drinkability by ½ point.
Pliney the Younger is a big, complex beer and well worth almost any journey in an effort to seek out its hoppy goodness. 877 charactersIceAce, Jan 30, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.501/27/05- Purchased at the Toronado on tap. I need to mark this date in my palm pilot as the day I had the best beer ever created by a human.
Presentation- 12 oz tulip glass poured from the tap.
Appearance- Nice 1/2-3/4 inch white ultra creamy head. Beautiful cloudy golden pour with excellent lacing.
Smell- I could not stop smelling this glass. Even when it was empty I would go back and literally try to wedge my nose into the glass. If it were possible this glass would become and appendage from my nose. A very sweet smelling hop presence. Lots of grapefurit and pine, but in a sweet floral manner. Didn't have that astringent bitter make your head fly back scent. This one just glided down with the greatest of ease. 
Taste- This is truly God's elixer. The first thing I thought of was...how soon before I can find this bad boy on the shelves. Then I realized that it's probably not going to be bottled :( So,...how soon until I can get a growler of this stuff. Reminds me of Dogfish 90, but sweeter and with more character. Lots of frutiy and floral hops, but not overporing. Tons of flavor and a sweetness that works perfect..with at least my taste buds. You can detect the alcohol though. I had three beers of 9%, 11% and 6% and I am done for the day. Gimme that water!!!
Mouthfeel- Light carbonation, plus the sweetness make this super easy to send down the pipe.
Drinkability- According to the Toronado, this beer is the first triple IPA. I went to their website and they don't even show it as one of their current beers. So, I am going to email them and find out for sure. The bartender originally told me it was 13%, which threw my head back pretty damn quick. All I can tell you is that the first thing I thought of after my first sip was...I am going to buy a kegerator and order a keg of this. It's absolutely incredible. A pure pleasure to drink. 1,881 charactersGClarkage, Jan 27, 2005
