Poured dark and fizzy, smells boozy, no head.
Fairly thin and not enough sweet to my palate. Pretty dry and oaky. 
Probably perfectly within style guidelines, but a bit svelte for my American tastes. Wishing for more caramel, toffee, raisin and sweetness. 269 charactersPDXAmbassador, Mar 29, 2017

Reddish brown, very little head, no retention or lace.
Big boozy aroma, bourbon, sherry, field berry.
I think the barrel has spoiled this one.  It's not sour, but it's incredibly dry with plenty of oak and leather.  Some roasted nut and raspberry, but it's overcome with bourbon.
Mouthfeel is relatively light and overly dry. 343 charactersDerek, Mar 27, 2017

I was immediately struck by how no nonsense the nose is. The barrel was eager to escape, as bourbon, vanilla, tobacco and leathery tannins blended together near perfectly. After warming up a bit, the Bourbon dominates but brings along sugar and dates.
First sip brings massive hot bourbon raisins. Second swig, I know what is coming enough to dismiss the obvious and focus on the tobacco, which is hiding under an astringent heat. Third swig opens up with a bit of the date thing that was in the nose, but one thing all of the swigs have in common is the astringency on exit. Only a touch of aftertaste, and not overly dry despite being fairly hot.
Very happy to have finally get a chance to check this one out, as I'd classify it as a heavy duty barley wine for sure 863 charactersgopens44, Mar 05, 2017

4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.252015 Sucaba, opened 2017-02-17. Side-by-side comparison with a 2015 Central Waters BA Barleywine and a 2014 Bourbon County Barleywine.
Cloudy with a medium-brown color. Slight carbonation. Not as dense and goopy-looking as the BCBBW.
Smell is dominated by oak and bourbon with plenty of sweet malt. Also caramel and vanilla. The sweetness comes through almost like cola. Hint of sweet dark fruit in the background, like red grapes.
Flavor is similar to smell but mellower and more subtle. Lots of caramelized sugar, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and malt.
It feels fairly dense and oily, but it doesn't have the viscosity of the BCBBW. Alcohol is well-integrated It's listed as 13.3% ABV -- higher than the BCBBW -- but there's no bite or burning.
This is probably the second-best BA barleywine I've had. It's quite good, but in a side-by-side with Bourbon County, it doesn't have quite the smoothness, richness, or density to come out on top. 941 charactersccg, Feb 17, 2017

The nose, as you would expect, is chock-full of caramel & toffee aromas, with warm bourbon quaffs floating in underneath. Lots of bourbon upfront, but on the mid-palate it shifts into decadent toffee flavors with vanilla and burnt sugar. Finishes with a boomerang of the bourbon heat but it is very smooth. 372 charactersajm5108, Jan 29, 2017

This barleywine is soooo smooth. In fact it's the smoothest ba barleywine I've had. Pours the usual dark and murky seductive amber brown with a slight foamy khaki tan head that dissipates quickly.
Aromas are aren't necessarily anything unique or special but the usual and expected scents of dark fruits, bourbon, oak and leather do indicate a well made Barlywine nonetheless. 
Mmm, delicious . . . Taste is superb. Initial flavors of spicy malts and dark fruits along the lines of dates, raisins, figs and plums and a touch of cherries give way to a subtle blend vanilla and heat from the bourbon. Which in turn gives way to it's dry barrel aged oaky finish. 
Overall, Sucaba has been a very long want of mine and it may not be the best I've had it still did not disappoint.
1) Open a bottle of this.
2) Pop in a Mozart piano Concerto.
3) Enjoy your day. 868 charactersGOBLIN, Jan 15, 2017

The aroma is a fantastic mix of bourbon, oak, raisin, fig, caramel, spice, vanilla, and molasses. Complex and prepares you for a treat. Quite simply, the best bourbon barrel aged barleywine I have tasted. Same notes -- dark fruit, caramel, spice, vanilla, molasses -- with a perfect blend of bourbon and barrel. Full bodied, low-moderate carbonation, balanced, and moderately dry. An absolutely phenomenal beer. 521 charactersBSiegs, Jan 08, 2017

Enjoyed a 2012 bottle at the New Year 2017! That's nearly five years of cellaring (I sort of lost track) and before that 11 months aged by the brewery. It was bought for me as a birthday gift in June 2012, and I almost drank it on a 40th birthday in June 2016. But it hung on until the new year.
I was a bit concerned, but this couldn't have lost anything for the aging.
There were really all sorts of flavors. Plum, raisin, cocoa, wine, and who knows what from the barreling. Oak, sweetness, vanilla, bourbon? wine? And nothing off, even almost nothing bitter at all in this beer. Just a forceful but sedated flavor punch that is hard to describe. With just the right sweetness to be exceptional at a new year. 740 charactersbraker649er, Jan 01, 2017

Smell is rich caramel, grape, prune and fig with a hint of charred wood. As it warms, a bit of cologne, spruce, and/or eucalyptus develops, with molasses and gingerbread.
Taste is grape, caramel, toffee, toasted charred oak at first, with bourbon coming in strong on the back end with some prune finishing. Some round and waxy toasted coconut and cashew fills in the aftertaste. The heat and strength get a little overpowering towards the second half of the bottle.
Medium body with a fizzy froth and semi-dry finish.

4.86/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 52016 vintage served cold in a teku
Appearance: orange and copper with almost no head except for a few bubbles on the rim. Oily top of the liquid (the glass was very clean). Classic Vintage labeling from FW with tons of info and specs.
Nose: bourbon, sweet malt backbone, tons of barrel, coconut, walnuts, toasted oak, marshmallow,  sweet alcohol and vanilla
Taste: follows the nose well but with a huge smack of barrel character, toasted coconut and marshmallow, oaky, bourbon, vanilla, some booze but certainly not the 13.4% ABV that the bottle lists. The beer is a bit sweet but that will help it age.
Overall: this beer lives up to the hype! It is totally worth the near perfect rating (99 BA Score at the time). I don't see where the fresh beer can be improved with the exception of the higher sweetness. I have another bottle and we sill see what a year or two does for this one. 888 charactersClavisAurea, Nov 26, 2016

S - big vanilla, oak, chocolate, tobacco, bourbon, molasses, caramel, butterscotch in a good way
T - bourbon, oak, vanilla , old pipe tobacco, caramel, molasses, milk chocolate, cream, it's not oxidized but it definitely begs to be aged for 5 or 10 years 
M - heavy beer, alcohol covered extraordinarily for the abv, aftertaste is bourbon, oak, little boozy

Aroma is of dried dried dark fruit: plums, cherries, and raspberries all soaked in rum. A nice amount of brown sugar and toffee.
Taste is phenomenal! Dark fruit, rum soaked raisins, brown sugar, and tons of toffee. A little alcohol burn at the end. Very smooth with a nice roastiness. Surprisingly a big amount of cherry and raspberry flavor as well.
Overall, this is a great beer! It reinforces my belief that FW has the best barrel aging program in the US. Drink this beer by itself; no food pairing necessary. It gets a 96/100. 642 charactersDaverCS, Sep 04, 2016

Wow, the aroma is hard to describe, it's so complex; really intense with tobacco, brown sugar, dark rum, dark fruit like raisin, dates, figs and plum, toffee, maple syrup, vanilla, oak barrels, caramel, coconut, wet leather, cinnamon and everything but the kitchen sink that's sweet and malty. Fruity, malty and full of wonderful earthy notes, I find myself stumped at trying to describe this as good as it smells. Summed up, it's wonderful.
Tastes like it smells, with the flavor lingering long after the swallow and tasting just as good as it did when it went down. Flavor starts of rich toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and then is similar to the nose with tobacco, sweet malt, wet tobacco leaf, vanilla, dark fruit like raisin, dates, figs and plum, toffee, maple syrup, oak barrels, coconut, wet leather, cinnamon, mild piney hops, gummy bear candy, sweet malt, graham cracker, bourbon, and minor booze that brings out more flavors and complexities rather than taking away from it. Sweet but not cloyingly sweet as the barrel influence cuts through with smoky and woody accents. So much flavor that my senses were overloaded and shutting down just so I could sip, savor and enjoy this world class brew.
Mouthfeel is creamy and buttery smooth with a medium body that leans towards chewy, average carbonation and one of the best finishes ever as it lingers just as tasty as each sip tasted. This brew hides the 13.4% ABV masterfully while letting some of the booze come through to remind you that this is a classic strong English Barleywine. An outstanding feel that was meant for sipping and easier to drink than it should be.
This lived up to the hype and was so flavorful and excellent that it justifies the steep price-tag. I have another bottle which I plan to age at least another year to maximize the flavor. One of the best overall beers I've ever had. Bourbon County Brand Barleywine Ale is a great English Barleywine, but this takes it to a whole new level. 2,174 charactersCHickman, Aug 10, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5'15 Vintage 
Appearance - Pours a deep, dark auburn brown with an off-white, half finger width head. Fair retention, leaving a mostly barren surface. Virtually no lacing.
Smell - Equal notes of toffee and bourbon qualities; vanilla and oak. Some nuttiness. 
Taste - Oh man. Toffee and toasted oak make up the bulk of the flavor, with lesser notes of vanilla and mild bourbon booze. A touch of raisin comes through in the backend. The finish is mostly toffee with a touch of caramel and light bourbon.  Hard to beat this.
Mouthfeel - Medium-to-full in body with low carbonation. Slick texture that gets dry and slightly sticky on the finish. Incredible smoothness for a brew at 13.3%.
Overall - I originally reviewed this beer back in 2013 with a fresh bottle of the '13. I thought it was too hot and bourbon-centric for it to be a truly great beer. Fast forward to a few months ago, and I cracked my '14, finding it having lost too much punch. Tonight I'm drinking the '15, and I think a year of age on this beer makes all the difference in the world. It's beginning to sound a bit like the Goldilocks story, but this one is just right! I've got a '16 in the fridge that won't be opened for a year, and I may snag one or two more to do the same!
6/29/17 Update: Just cracked my '16 and confirmed: 14-18 months is the ideal age on this, in my opinion. 1,357 charactersTheSixthRing, Aug 09, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Simply put, this is the best beer I have ever had and what I believe to be the best beer ever made.  If you have not had this beer, you have not lived and have nothing to judge beers against.
What does it taste like?  Butter.  Now I know that sounds strange and weird for a beer, but it's true and legit.  While this might not sound like what you want in a beer, you are wrong.  It's this warm, thick, caramelly, buttery goodness that warms your soul and your dick.  I tried this is a flight with several other high quality barrel aged beers and this made them look like Ghetto Black and Tan made out of Colt 45 and Boone's Farm.
If you've over had improperly barrel aged beers and don't understand the hype, try this.  If you've ever had awful barley wines that taste like rubbing alcohol and want to discount the whole category, try this.  If you are a human and have a tongue, try this.
Like most other reviews will say, this is a super heavy, thick, buttery, rich, complex, smooth, experience.  But overall it is this, an experience.  This beer changed my life.  I don't want to do anything else in life other than drink this beer.  If Lexi Belle wants to hang out with me, I hope that she has a bottle of Sucaba with her, because otherwise my attention span may wonder, that's how good this is.
Head is small but thick.  Color is fairly light and does not foretell the quality inside.  Do not let this ruin your future life changing experience. 1,453 charactersBeerStud187, Jul 12, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52013 Vintage cellared for over 3 years now!
Pours out a very dark copper with ruby hints and an off-white head.
The aroma is vanilla, coconut, bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, cherry, oak, barrel char, bit of chocolate and a hint of molasses. Extremely complex with layers and layers of different smells. I could spend all day just smelling this one!
Taste starts off with some sweet bourbon and vanilla, goes into a toasted coconut, caramel and toffee malt base, some milk chocolate and molasses/brown sugar. There's dates, figs and raisins along with cherry notes too and even a touch of a red wine character. Sip after sip presents something new and there are so many layers and so much complexity to this one!! 
Fuller side of medium bodied, creamy, smooth mouthfeel and only a slight warming in the chest. The alcohol is hidden quite well. Definitely a sipper, but so smooth.
I very rarely rate anything a 5/5, 10/10, 100/100, etc, but this beer more than deserves it!! An absolute joy to drink and my only regret is that I don't have more. D: 1,059 charactersJohnnyMc, Jul 09, 2016

L - Murky brown up front.  Ruby red against the light.  No head.
S - Complex. A little booze, oak, char, smoke, caramel, butterscotch, toffee, sweet malts ans bourbon.
T - Heavy on the malts and bourbon. Oak and tobacco from the barrel. Also has the sweeter, candy-iike caramel and toffee. Some cherry and honey.
F - Full-bodied. Slighty thick without being syrupy. Malts and bourbon last for days on the tongue. Some minor alcohol taste, but no warming or sting.
O - Just because its "Abacus", does that put it on another level from all releases since the name change? No. that's not taking away from the beer's superb quality. This is a bourbon-soaked ride filled with caramel, toffee, oak, and smoke. Easily one of the best (maybe the best) English Barelywine I've ever had. 797 charactersThrewRedButter, Jul 09, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from 2016 vintage into tulip glasses:
Appearance: dark brown and cola-esque in color and consistency, this brew is perrty looking for a high percentage barleywine. Carries a solid, sudsy white head with lots of lacing, especially for a 13% banger.
Aroma: suuuuuuper deep and boozy, with vanilla and caramel being dominant scents here. Doesn't smell "hot" per se, but the barrel definitely carries a heavy presence.
Taste: following the scent, it starts with the barrel, with some solid oaky notes, and is followed by caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Maybe some burnt sugar in there. Either way, it's got lots of heavily sweet notes, but remains well balanced with the boozy barrel and smokey character.
Feel: very viscous, and borderline syrupy, it's a beer to split with a friend or two.

Caramel, oak, vanilla, bourbon, toasted coconut, leather and tobacco all mingle perfectly together, creamy mouthfeel that coats your mouth and leaves you wanting more and more. As i said before, this is just an incredible achievement in beer making, it only comes 2nd in my opinion to Stickee Monkee.amazing. 461 charactersmanfromanotherplace, Jul 03, 2016

In a snifter the beer was a dark red/brown color with a miniscule tan head. 
Aroma of booze, caramel, and vanilla.
Wonderful taste. Caramel, toffee, bourbon, vanilla. The alcohol was complimentary, not overwhelming.
Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. 291 characterslordofthewiens, Jul 02, 2016

Mahogany-amber. ++++ clarity. Head hangs onto the edge.
Tannin laden sherry. Boozy orange peels. Dry, rough leather, a touch of cherry, vanilla-coconut cream, charred barrel aroma. 
Light body for style, but velvety and smooth. Never cloying.
Toasted coconut dusted bourbon bonbons. Bourbon forward with tobacco-brown sugar that coats figs, plums, raisin. Fiery char. Earthy-woody, a touch of burnt sugars, chocolate and carob, but a lesser, latent sweetness than say BCBW. 490 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Jun 23, 2016

4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On Draft - 2016 vintage.
Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin tan head that quickly dissipated. Some slight lacing was noted on the glass.
Smell had aromas of caramel, toffee, plum, brown sugar, and roast malts. Undertones of vanilla, bourbon and a distinctly discernible alcohol are noted. Really a wonderful aroma. 
Taste follows the nose with this wonderfully melded array of flavors of caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, plums and dark overly ripe cherries. Finishes with a strong bourbon and alcohol presence that warms the face as you drink. 
Feel is very smooth, buttery, and relatively drinkable for a 13%+ ABV beer. Only mild carbonation. The beer definitely warms your face as you sip it. 
Overall, this beer was simply sublime. It changed what I think of barley wines (they can be good) and definitely lived up to the "hype"/expectations. Next year, I'll be looking to snag a bottle of this one for the winter months. 954 charactersFBarber, Jun 03, 2016
4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52014 vintage poured into a snifter. Pours a rich, dark mahogany with a slight off-white head that persists on the edge of the class. Pretty beer. Smell is amaretto, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, malt and booze. Taste is malt, bourbon, slight raisin, oak, and a rather strong alcohol bite. I'm a bit surprised about the sharpness  of that here, particularly as that's what lingers on the back end of the taste. Feel is rather light and springy in a pleasant way--its a smooth sipper that I'm taking my time to enjoy.
A fantastic beer and standard setter for the style. 565 charactersAppaZappa, Jun 03, 2016

4.11/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 42016 Vintage, 13.4% ABV.
22 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Beautiful, clear, ruby brown color with a sparse, off-white head. Poor head retention with no lacing, but some nice legs as you swirl it around in the glass.
Heavy vanilla, caramel, toffee, maple syrup, port, and alcohol in the aroma. Simply awesome. Huge bourbon presence comes through in the flavor backed up by caramel and toffee from the malt and brown sugar sweetness.
The body is lighter than I expected, medium-full. A little on the thin side and I think I would enjoy it more if it was thicker or chewier. Carbonation is extremely soft, almost flat, and the finish has a warming quality to it.
I set this one aside for enjoying after passing my PE exam and it while its complexity was impressive, I was left slightly underwhelmed. Maybe my expectations were too high but it just left me wanting more. I'm still extremely happy I got the chance to try this and have no regrets spending the money on its hefty price tag.

Deep Ruby/garnet hue to this beauty, small amount of sediment and floaties in the haze. Small tan coloured head that dissipates to near-nothing, with no lace. The smell of this one blew me away with huge aromas of grain, cereal, malt, caramel, vanilla, cherries, plum, bourbon is subdued and balanced, which is usually a big factor in these brews. 
Massive amount of malt and yeasty breadiness, grains and cereal, giving it a lush forefront, with some nice roast and slight coffee undertones. Sherry, vanilla, plum, fig, prune, peach. Malty sweetness in the end with a lick of brown sugar and woodiness. Finishes earthly, smooth and clean. 13.4% ABV is kept at bay amazingly well, with just a slight booziness and barrel presence lingering in the end. 
For me this was a complete win. Has all the things I love in a BW and the bourbon just brings it to another level. Firestone Walker delivers yet again. 979 charactersanon, May 16, 2016

4.03/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sorry to be contrary, but I'm not a fan this year or last. In the world of barrel aged BW, I much prefer Arctic Devil, Old Conundrum, Hand and Seal, Mirror-Mirror and yes the retired Double DBA. These have more "leathery" ,sweeter,  deep aged flavors. 
I offer that 2016 Sucaba is unique in its completely dry finish and sherry-like presence but lacks much flavor and has hot astringent alcohol presence that is unpleasantly burning in the nostrils. I should have let it age at least 2 years. That said, my cellar contains many cherished bottles of FW Double DBA and Stickee Monkee  in various states of age. The class and refinement that FW seeks with Sucaba is commendable but my palate is seeking more richness in a $20+ bottle of fine ale. For this same reason, I also no longer buy Parabola. 796 charactersJjski, May 08, 2016

Look: Dark reddish black with about 1/2 finger of tan head. 
Smell: Pretty muted. Bourbon, chocolate, red fruit. 
Taste: Delicious. Bourbon and vanilla, oak, chocolate and espresso, and a bit of warming alcohol to hold it all together. 
Feel: Lovely carbonation with a slick, medium to heavy body. A bit chewy. Long finish. 
Overall: Great barrel aged barley wine. Balanced and well executed. 442 charactersweltywm, Apr 13, 2016

L: pours a dark brown color with a nice tan head.  
S: sweet, caramel, molasses,  toffee, 
T: like the nose, there are toffee, and caramel notes in there.  Boozy alcohol taste on the back end
F: the right amount of carbonation, but very thin.
O: I was sadly very disappointed by this beer.  I found it to be very thin in both taste and feel.  Don't get me wrong, it is a good beer, but I was expecting it to be much more complex and flavorful. 456 characters-Rick, Apr 04, 2016

In my early beer days, I was a barleywine fan, but I've drifted from that and don't really care for the style anymore. That said, for the style, this is about as good as it gets. Even at 13.3 ABV, this is stupidly drinkable (so be careful!). Although the nose is, I feel, a touch strong, the balance in the color, feel, and taste is exemplary. Truly world-class. If you are a barleywine fan, this should be a holy grail offering. Beautiful dark leather color. A taste base of leather and light bourbon and malt. Although it's not enough to win me back to the style, it's enough to make me understand and agree with its reputation. 692 charactersChris_Huston, Mar 28, 2016

22 oz foil capped bottle poured into a snifter.
Appearance
Hazy mahogany with ruby highlights. No head to speak of.
Nose
Caramel, toffee, bourbon, oak, coconut, vanilla, and tobacco.
Taste
Caramel cubes and rich toffee. Sweet cigar-like flavors mingle with bourbon, raisin, and maraschino cherry. Light notes of chocolate, smooth oak, coconut, and vanilla bean.
Mouthfeel
Full bodied, warming, balanced, and sticky with light carbonation.
Overall
A borderline perfect English Barleywine. Some of the best barrel blending around. Incredibly balanced with a deceptive 13.4% abv. 604 charactersjustintcoons, Mar 18, 2016

L - Pours a deep burgundy color with a cream white head that dissipates quickly
S - I get rich sweet caramel, vanilla, oak, and cherries
T - The taste is of brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, and bourbon soaked raisins.  There is a spicy almost peppery finish with some heat.
F - Good mouth feel.  Maybe a little over carbonated.
O - As with most FW boxed beers, this is all about the balance.  Typical for an English Barley Wine, there is a little bit of heat.  But I really look forward to some age on this. 545 charactersbrewaddict, Mar 15, 2016

Taste was a great excursion into hoppy barleywine land meets bourbon barrel without a shit ton of malt to muck it up.  Caramel all over this, some oak, brown sugar and vanilla.  Its complex and nothing is excessive or out of place.  Slick. 335 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 14, 2016

F: syrupy thickness, coats my mouth well and the flavors linger for a long while.  I have to knock this rating down a little since I'm a fan of ultra thick beers and this is not that.

Appearance - Pours a deep ruby red with two fingers of bubbly off-white head.
Smell - Bready malts, caramel/toffee, dark cherry, oak, vanilla bean, hint of alcohol to warm the nose, somewhat port-like aroma, touch of dark chocolate, mild earthy hops.
Taste - Harmonious blend of bready malts, caramel/toffee, dark cherry, oak, and vanilla. Hints of dark chocolate, mild bitter earthy hops, and the slightest alcohol flavour. Sweetness from malts, dark cherry, and dark chocolate lingers on the palate.
Mouthfeel - Medium-to-full bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a smooth warmth of alcohol along with a touch of softness. 
Overall - An out-of-this-world English barleywine from Firestone Walker. I can't get over the array of complex flavours and aromas. The vanilla and oak round out this barleywine very nicely. This is a dangerous brew as the alcohol is well hidden, really just providing a nice warmth on the palate. 971 charactersleaddog, Feb 14, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +6.1%look: 2.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Look: Probably the only thing that's bad about this brew. Everything else offsets it. It's a dark murky brown color with almost zero head. It's extremely ugly looking.
Smell: Moving on to the good stuff. Raisons, chocolate covered nuts, and vanilla aromas. You can tell you'll definitely get some boozey flavors. It's still very young, but it will be fun to check back on what I wrote about this one once I try it again with a year or two tacked on it.
Taste: Dark fruits, figs, plum, and raisons. Nice earthy tones in there and hardly any bitterness. You can pick up on honey and chocolate as well as some vanilla, which probably all comes from the barrel. Big boozey taste as well. Very warming.
Mouthfell: Silky smooth, but there is some burn to it. It's not something that bugs me though and I actually very much welcome it. I'm sure after a year or two that will mellow out.
Overall: Exactly what you'd want from a barrel aged english barley wine. It's beautiful and you can almost imagine how much better it will get with age. 1,036 charactersivehadthatbrew, Feb 06, 2016

I would say it is much better balanced compared to bourbon county which was overly rich and a little unbalanced (maybe the bourbon county needed some aging). At 42 IBUs, there is only medium bitterness providing drinkability for such a powerful beer. 377 charactersTrevor11, Jan 23, 2016

This review is for the 2015 as I've not yet sampled the 2014.  Now that they are a year old, I'm adding a review.  The aging makes them less hot and IMHO quite smooth and wonderful.  Having dipped into the collection a few times over the year, it is definitely worth waiting and aging them.
Poured into a 6oz snifter from a bomber warmed to about 50 deg.
L: Pours a dark amber slightly burgundy with a one finger head that dissipates quickly to a thin foam ring.
S: Strong caramel with a sweet almost marshmallow like odor
T: Strong bourbon, caramel, and vanilla.  It is amazingly smooth for such a high ABV.
F: medium body with a silky texture as it rolls over the tongue. 782 characterstprinzing, Jan 15, 2016

Very dark ruby-brown pour with a modest head that gives way to a thin tan head. Smells of bourbon, caramel and a bit of barrel sourness., followed by more delicate notes of chocolate, raisins and cocoa. The taste is dominated by bourbon and caramel and well balanced by hop bitterness. The alcohol is quite present in the taste, but in a pleasant way. Hot aftertaste due to the alcohol. Soft mouthfeel, medium body. It would have been a bit better if it were thicker. 492 charactersMarius, Dec 30, 2015

Poured from a 1 pint 6oz. bottle into an over sized wine glass. 
The color is a cloudy dark maroon with some red highlights and a thin layer of brownish head that disappeared quickly.  No lacing here and not much in the way of carbonation that can be seen.
The smell has a dark chocolate and toffee aroma here. There is some slight black cherry aroma with some raspberry aroma in the background and just a slight hint of coffee bean aroma.
The taste is cherry and raspberry flavor with some dark chocolate that is just like a desert wine. There is a great sweetness here that is a bit caramel and toffee flavor with some a warm vanilla flavor. There is a slight banana flavor here in the far background that comes out at certain points and compliments the caramel flavor.
The feel of this beer is heavy but more mellow than it certainly would have been fresh. With some age on this beer the alcohol now just has a warming feel that comes forward and enhances the flavor. This one was well worth the wait. 1,029 charactersDuhast500, Dec 22, 2015

4.27/5  rDev -4.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a dark ruddy amber to brown color color with a thin wisp of a settling white head. Practically non-existent lacing just slides right on into the beer.
The smell started off with some "tobacco" flavors running into a nice estery fruity to caramel maltiness. Light smoke, butterscotch, vanilla and toffee bleed in for the balance.
The taste was moderately sweet with a stretched dry tingle from that "tobacco" flavoring. It seems like it wants to show balance, but leans towards the sweeter side of the wheelhouse. There's definitely a sweet fruity aftertaste, still nice.
The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with a good sipping quality as the tobacco lingers back to dry things out a bit yet allows some moisture from the malts to lay out nicely on my tongue.
Overall, as an English Barleywine, this was a wonderful offering by Firestone Walker as now I feel just a little bit sad now that it's gone. 952 charactersSitkaSteve, Nov 09, 2015

Pours a slightly cloudy copper color with a very thin head that turns to a ring. The nose has lots of barrel characters to it. The taste starts with a sweetness then gains flavor of raisens mabey a hint of wine barrels then it all slowly mellows away. A very nice treat. 332 characters303beer, Oct 23, 2015

A: ruby red in color very dark amber with pretty good clarity almost no head just a little lace around the rim
S:lots of soft Bourbon, toffee, vanilla, a little butterscotch some alcohol smells light bits of hops 
T: Light bourbon a little vanilla and toffee a touch of oak and a lot of alcohol very boozy on the tongue getting some banana bread taste too 
M: very thin and a little watery the beer doesn't even coat the tongue its just watery 
O: I have had this beer before the 2013 version and this beer tastes like it has been watered way down and has an odd banana bread taste I don't remember in the prior version. While Firestone can rarely do wrong when it comes to Barrel aging this 2015 is not what Sucaba should taste like. Although the 2013 version was an absolute pleasure to drink. 832 charactersSomethingClever, Oct 07, 2015

Appearance: Deep mahogany and incredibly murky. Didn't form much of a head, despite a vigorous pour. Just a thin layer of light tan suds.
Aroma: Huge dose of drunken raisins and dried stone fruits. Very sweet. Touch of alcohol.
Taste: Incredible depth of flavor. It starts simple with some light hoppy tones balanced by caramel malt. Then it transitions to oak and bourbon with a heavy dose of raisin/dark cherry liqueur flavor. At 13.3% ABV, the alcohol in the flavor is no surprise and works quite well. A dark chocolate flavor comes through in the finish and there is a final sweet caramel/cherry note before the hops dominate in a bitter aftertaste. Some heat in the throat. I'm sure this ages phenomenally, but it was nice to have it young. It's a bit rough around the edges but still very good.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full in body with more carbonation than I was expecting. An easy sipper.
Final Thoughts: Definitely met my expectations. At $20 a bomber, it's a bit pricey, but worth the cost if you haven't had it and are a fan of the style. Would I drink it again? Yes. 1,104 charactersJamesMN, Sep 07, 2015

Pours a tawny chestnut leather with two fingers of light tan head which dissipates to a thin layer.
Peaty oak smell, slightly brackish in profile, combined with dried dark fruits of cherries, plums, raisins and dates soaked in brandy. Hints of cocoa power and leather, reminiscent of an old leather chair. 
Smokiness is less pronounced in the flavour, with the leather and dark dried fruits together with cocoa coming to the forefront, although less sweet than expected from the scent. Notes of oak and brandy. Extremely smooth in its finish, with very minimal alcohol presence. 
Overall an amazing barley wine, and likely the best I've had. 657 charactersFondueVoodoo, Sep 06, 2015

Pours a translucent reddish dark brown with a thin tan head that dissipates for the most part but keeps refreshing a thin ring of bubbles around the edge, with little to no lacing.
Aroma is sweet candied dried fruit - very reminiscent of a late harvest zinfandel. 
Taste is straight up delicious, with raisin, plum, dark dried fruit, zinfandel and a hint of oak.
Mouth is just right, medium-full, not at all cloying.  Very drinkable for a 12% BW.
Overall, this was a treat.  It's just a fantastic aged barleywine. 697 charactersFFreak, Aug 31, 2015

Solid, but not my ideal cup of tea... or glass of beer. 346 charactersljjpowers, Aug 25, 2015

Pours copper with some creamy bubbles that hang out on the top.  Smells like straight up heath bar.  Big creamy caramel notes, a hint of malty booze, caramelized orange peel, and bitter chocolate and toffee notes.  Tastes like big nutty toffee, with a hint creamy, roasty, chocolate notes and a hint of cold coffee bitterness.  Feels smooth as silk.  A Great beer, worth the hype and worth the wait. 414 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Aug 10, 2015

Taste brings sweet malts along with oak and a little coconut. Figs and raisins are prominent with chocolate and vanilla. You really Taste the booze and that takes away from the taste and mouth feel. Taste doesn't deliver on the promise in the aroma. 506 charactersdanh53, Aug 05, 2015

A: Very dark brown. Very light tan colored, frothy head that settles to a thin layer on the beer.
S: Musty, bourbon, cherry, vanilla, caramel, cola, leather. There's a lot going on here!
T: Decadent. Bourbon, cherry, cocoa, toffee, vanilla, caramel. All the desserts.
M: Thick, but also very drinkable.
O: This was a great experience, drank for a special occasion that made it even better. I haven't had it fresh, but the cherry (dark fruits) flavor that I love was helped along with age, I'm sure. I see why this beer is sought after. Very nice. 599 charactersFargrow, Jun 29, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look - Dark brown, very little head; no lacing.
Smell - Malt, caramel, toffee, oak... all blended together into a very pleasant nose.  The only negative (barely) aspect is the slight booziness.
Taste - one of  the top 2 tasting BA barleywine's I've had.  The first thing I noticed was the excellent balance.  super smooth with toffee, malt, and dark fruits upfront followed by a little bourbon and a minuscule hint of vanilla.  Not much booze in the taste which in my opinion is the sign of a well done beer, especially of the BA variety.
Feel - Pretty thick for a barleywine, a little sticky, but quite smooth
Overall - This is a sublime beer.  One of the 2 best of the style that I have ever had. 702 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Jun 15, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Amazing, one of the best beers I've ever had. 
L- dark Amber color, tan head that quickly dissipated
F - definitely has some body but not too much. Moderate carbonation
S - instantly I knew I would like it once I smelled it. Big vanilla and toffee. 
T - similar to the nose. Pretty sweet with the same caramel, toffee vanilla flavors. Some booze but it perfectly balances the sweetness. Finishes with caramel corn, a slight butteriness. 
O- I usually don't give out 5* ratings but this deserves it. For me, a perfect BA beer. Only question is what to do with the other 2 I have. My feeling is it will continue to get better, but don't hesitate to drink now. 662 charactersManiv_Steel, May 31, 2015
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Ruby-brown body, slight haze. Head and lace only appear as faint collars.
S: Oak, vanilla, caramel, tons of warming maltiness, some diacetyl, and even a bit of alcohol that is well-integrated.
T: The malt and butter is most prominent, a combo that usually results in a cloying and sickly rich beer, but this is amazingly balanced by the non-harsh oak, vanilla, and coconut notes. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen here- I wonder if just a glimpse of it would add or detract. Either way, it's already incredible.
M: Warm alcohol, full bodied.
O: Amazing balance, and for an arguably straight-forward and heavy style, this one presents its flavors with grace and even just a little restraint, where appropriate. This is my definition of a crafted beer. 753 characters1000lbgrizzly, May 30, 2015

Full bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Big malty body with taste or candi sugar and licorice, vanilla, and resin. Alcohol (13.5%) is evident. Comparable to Bourbon Country Barleywine, but has some interesting fruity complexities, and even a hint of sourness. Decent barrel-aged Barleywine, but would have to give it another try to make a better assessment. 477 charactersretry4z, May 13, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. No bottling date, but it's likely just under 4 months old at this point. 
A: Pours a deep, dark brown with a reddish hue. A faint 1/4-finger off-white head with an aggressive pour that dissipates quickly. Appears a bit thin. 
S: Vanilla, molasses, brown sugar. Plum, chocolate-covered cherries, raisins. Also a bit of a cinnamon french toast quality here as well. Bourbon integrates well here, it's very smooth and has some fruity notes that complement it well. It's not an overwhelming or powerful aroma, but it's still very nice.
T: Lots of sweet molasses, brown sugar, dark fruits. Some maple syrup, vanilla, oak. The bourbon integrates so well with the natural flavors from the barleywine that you almost forget it's barrel-aged. They really play off each other nicely here. 
M: This is where the beer falls from elite status for me. It's very, very thin. Almost has the consistency of water, and that's no good. Also, it is extremely boozy. 13.3% is high to start, but there's a way to work it in and it's been done before, but just not here. It's very hot on the finish, almost like a dry red wine. 
O: So this is my 2nd review of a "boxed" beer from FW, and I've encountered the same problem twice now: poor, poor mouthfeel. This beer is way too thin and way too boozy. And that's a shame, because it takes away from an otherwise stellar beer. Great, great aroma here. Great flavors, with the bourbon complementing the rich sweetness and dark fruit flavors of the English-style BW. But the mouthfeel just prevents it from getting to that next level for me. I even let it sit for 4 months, and it still came out hot! 
Recommendation: Don't let my review scare you, this is still a great beer. Definitely seek it out or trade for it, but maybe let it sit for 6+ months. Maybe at that point some of the heat has faded, making this beer much more drinkable. 1,926 charactersSparty1224, Apr 27, 2015

2016.  Cold:Light booze aroma.  Coloring is a dark burnt red. Very boozy. Toffee, Vanilla, cherries, orange peel,booze. 1/2 hour later let it sit.  Aroma is coconut cherries, vanilla and chocolate.  Taste: truly comes alive at room temp. Burnt coconut , cherries, vanilla and dark chocolate light booze finish.  This must be room temp when you drink it.  Must. 504 charactersBoccu, Apr 16, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52014 vintage. Poured from the bomber Into a wide snifter. Pours a dark brown color with a half inch head that dissipates quickly and leaves very little thin foam at te surface.very little to no lacing present around the glass. Smells of Madeira, port wine and fig. Tastes of dates, figs, caramel, subtle oak, whiskey, port wine. Great mouthfeel, solid malt base, and overall very drinkable for a 13.5% abv brew. Would absolutely seek this one out!

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This 'Suca' is packing heat! Beware, if you don't give her some time to mellow out, it's gonna be boozy. Pour as hard as you like - resulting head will be minimal. However, that's not bad. This beer has no intention of being highly carbonated. The focus seems to be on body and aroma. Genetically, Ssucaba probably isn't actually a beer at all. Barley wine is really something between beer and liquor. It's 'barely' beer;) For example, the liquid itself is thick (liquor like). Instead of lacing the glass as a sticky double IPA  would, Sucaba slowly slides down and the thickness drags all residue with it (almost like a whiskey that's been sloshed around in a glass). <--not a turn off. Just expect strong; '15 at least. On the nose it's sweet and inviting. A little hard for me to pick apart, but I think the bourbon and vanilla come through first. One might deduce that toasted coconut or cocoa - not likely through the heat though. As for taste and mouth feel, think quad. This one is heavy, and the forward encounter is slightly sweet and near syrupy. Toward the back, it warms in Booz-like fashion. Share. It's better that way.

4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Sight:  A dark amber, with an SRM of maybe 30 or so.  Red highlights.  Tan head that sits smooth and creamy.  It eventually dies down.  Lacing thick and generous.
Smell:  Oak, vanilla, caramel.  Malty sweetness.  Dark fruit suggesting raisins, dates, or figs.  All the hallmarks of a BBA English Barleywine.
Taste:  Mimics the aroma, plus a mature presence of booze, more evident as it warms up.  The chill I had on it makes it a little crisper, as it were.
Feel:  Smooth, creamy.  Long finish, due in part to the barrel aging.  Luxury in a glass.  Pulling air through it a-la a “wine taste” gets me a little more length, and even makes me cough a little from the booze.  A confusing treat.
Overall:  FW, I commend you, and now, I can let this one go.  Excellent example of the style. 792 charactersJMS1512, Mar 15, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I originally rated Sucaba on 3/13/2015 without reviewing it.  This review is on  8/26/2016 and it's based on the 2016 vintage. The bottle date is 1/9/2016.  It was poured from the bottle into a snifter glass.  It pours an orange-brown with ruby hues and has a thin, khaki-colored head that dissipates quickly.  It resembles apple cider.  The lack of a thick head doesn't hurt the rating.  It smells of caramel, butterscotch, molasses, raisin, and bourbon.  It's delightfully aromatic.  When sipped (and it should be sipped!), the first taste is raisin, followed by vanilla, butterscotch, oak, and bourbon, which is strong at the finish.  This bottle is 8 months old and I think the alcohol burn has dissipated somewhat.  It has a delightful mouthfeel: it's viscous and creamy with mild carbonation. The 2016 Vintage is 13.4% ABV and you definitely feel it.  This is assuredly a sipper; it's like a cordial.  Overall, I haven't changed my rating, which is one of the highest I've ever given.  Sucaba is the best Barleywine I've tasted and it's a world-class treat. 1,063 charactersMacMalt, Mar 14, 2015

As it warms, A hint of vanilla and oak shine. I can only assume this is the bourbon barrels. As a normal barleywine doesn't have this level of complexity. This is by a long shot, one of the best barleywines I've ever had. Thanks FW crew! 384 charactersKVNBGRY, Mar 09, 2015

a: a murky dark brown color with some deep purple and ruby red notes.  no real head, just some off-white bubbles hovering around the side of the glass - probably being kept there by the etching at the bottom of the glass
s: a very rich and luxurious aroma.  vanilla, oak, tannins up front.  baking chocolate.  plums, fig, raisins. dark rich sticky caramel. dark sweet cherries, a very small hint of licorice.  ends with the mellow barrel character
t: oak and vanilla tickle the front of the tongue.  dark cherries, fig, prunes, raisins.  sweet caramel, some of that bitter baking chocolate.  there is a tingle of alcohol on the tongue, and it is there on the back end of the flavor along with the (bourbon?) barrel - but it isn't harsh, which is amazing given that this is coming in at 13.3%.  very well crafted beer.  if left to sit, and the the alcohol mellowed this would be taken to a whole different level
m: surprising light.  its medium with a lot more carbonation than i expected.  no head, but definitely a bit fizzy in the mouth
o: my impression is that drinking this fresh (as i am) i can tell this beer is extremely well-made, and on its own its really good.  very nice base flavors in here that are harmonized well.  also the fact that this is 13.3% and drinks as well is it does is super-impressive.  well done.  i would definitely recommend getting one and sitting on it for at least 1 year.  if allowed to blend in the bottle further, this will be something extremely special 1,522 charactershopsputin, Mar 07, 2015

Smells of coconut, vanilla, dried fruit, caramelized sugars, malts and a few other things I couldn't identify.  Tasted thin in the mouth like most barley wines.  Flavors are as above but it didn't knock my socks off.  Over hyped before drinking maybe?  After taste is vanilla, dried fruit and Barley.  Good but not out of this world good. 453 charactersuvachief, Mar 03, 2015

4.48/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25We pull our bottle of 2012’s “No. 002” from its protective cardboard sheath, and remove the foil and cap.  Pouring into our three-quarter sized tasting snifters, we discover a remarkably dark barleywine the color of deep rosewood.  A quick one finger head of loose, soapy, tawny foam heads the beer before dissipating into a solid ring of lacing, with wispy satellites extending across the surface of the glass and the liquid alike.  The top looks like an oil slick.  No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be light.  The aroma is rich, savory, and hot, blending together huge buttery diacetyls, densely biscuity and sweaty roasted chocolate and caramel grain, bright honey sugariness, chalky Flintstone vitamin tartness, metallic date and fig jam sugars, warming and fusel bourbon booziness, toffee fudge, pumpkin flesh, soft peaty char, dried nutmeg spice, brown sea glass, oily cashew and pecan butters, dried rosy florals, acidic lemony juiciness, burnt mallows, unpopped popcorn kernels, copper, tea leaf tannins, and distant vinous mossiness.  The flavoring is wonderful, extending perfectly from the aroma through liberating waves of intense cloying sugariness of strawberries, red apples, and dates, iced plum pudding, brown breadiness, singed molasses, syrupy yet dusty caramel, amber, and soft coffee malt roast and wash, rinsed barley rawness, huge buttery woodiness of oak, charred chicory, biting and puckering bourbon flavoring, creamy vanilla, aluminum, soggy Cornflakes, mineral water, English yeasty bitters, hot gingerbread and mild cloven phenols, salted caramel, nori vegetals, and oily leathers.  The body is full, oily, and chewy, and the carbonation medium, but more soft and foamy than prickly.  Slurp, smack, cream, and froth are all excellent, softening the heaviness of the sip, and folding the mouth over upon itself in velvety goodness.  Following this coating creamy softness, the palate tightens into a tannic puck.  The abv is appropriately large, and the beer sips forever.
Overall, this beer certainly lives up to the hype.  Even after a solid two to three years maturing in our cellar, this 2012 stock retains its intense buttery woodiness, dense caramel sugariness, and warming bourbon booziness.  Aside from these obvious necessities, you get ever shade of complexity to fill in the gaps across the nose and palate.  Although we don’t have a great base of comparison, if seems that nothing has faded or taken to the top.  The balance remains supreme.  We tackled this as part of our recent “Whale Hunt”.  Our cellar space is being dramatically reduced in the upcoming months, so we’re systematically going through the “drink now” beers we’ve been aging.  This beer, more or less, is helping to kick that off.  In this vein, it was nice reading about the history of this beer.  It seems that this was one of, if not the, genesis beer of their “Reserve Series”, and it fits so well.  We’ve obviously not sampled them according to their order of release, but it meets that same quality of barrel-aged wonder that the rest of them have attained.  §ucaba is a phenomenal beer, and something every true BeerAdvocate should seek out for reference point and blissful enjoyment. 3,252 charactersTheBrewo, Feb 11, 2015

Appearance:  rich ruddy-brown hue with a clear body and a light effervescence.  Head pours a finger of frothy tan foam.  I think it's quite beautiful.
Smell:  richly malty with a subtle but effective dark-fruit character that lurks beneath the big vanilla-ey oak.  There's just enough complexity to be interesting, but the big story is really with the depth of the malt, dusky fruit and vanilla -- wonderful.
Taste:  big, rich malt up front which slowly subsides revealing a boozy, hot and barrely finish.  The flavor elements are much like the aroma, with an emphasis on the oak and vanilla, although the big alcohol adds a little sweet, light fruitiness in the finish.  An excellent beer, if a little boozy.
Mouthfeel:  big, big body with a low carbonation that nevertheless yields a wonderful creaminess and exceptionally silky-smooth texture.  Outstanding.
Overall:  I this this is a wonderful beer, but it's booziness is just a little too much for me.  Perhaps I will buy another of these and cellar it for a year to see if that edge wears down a little. 1,188 charactersflagmantho, Feb 08, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Re-review! 2015 vintage! 'Murica! 22 oz bottle into a teku.
Appearance: Pours a very dark ruby color. The head is a finger high, and mocha in shade. For over 13%, the retention is impressive. Its creaminess creates an additional aesthetic appeal. A thin ring of lacing is left on the glass, too. (3.75)
Smell: This really taps into darker malt notes than a typical barleywine, such as chocolate, brown sugar, and even roast. Caramel appears, and is very well defined. That 'trademark' Firestone Walker coconut character? It's also there in full force. Alcohol and bourbon presence is gentle yet prominent, ditto the vanilla. It's so bourbon-forward, in fact, that it kind of drowns out the base beer. Luckily it manages to remain balanced while asserting such strong aromas. (4.5)
Taste: The initial flavor is heavy on the oak, while vanilla slowly builds up toward the finish. I'm also picking up some finishing roast and coffee flavors, which is always welcome. There's a mild burn throughout - it doesn't hide the alcohol (through sweetness, fullness, or whatever) as well as something like Bourbon County. It's intensely oak-laden, almost like chewing on an oak chip. Once the palate gets used to the powerful bourbon presence, some of its additional notes make themselves known - the British ale esters pop up with some finishing cherry/apricot, and the caramel/brown sugar sweetness strengthens itself. Ultimately, it's complexity lives up to the billing of many BAs, at the cost of a slight harshness. Whatever, it works beautifully. (4.25)
Mouthfeel: Very soft on the palate, but also fairly thin. It's practically dry for 13.3% - despite the mild residual sweetness, one could almost call it 'drinkable'. No, wait, I will call it drinkable. It's slightly syrupy, but any 13%+ is bound to be. Carbonation is low throughout. (3.75)
Overall: My problem with previous Sucaba vintages was that it was a bourbon showcase first, and a beer second. It's still the case here - at first. Anyone who's read the BA forums at some point knows how herrburgess recommends one to drink multiple Schlenkerla rauchbiers in a sitting, so its massive smoke flavor will ultimately reveal a beautifully layered beer underneath. In a way, this beer is very similar - it's all bourbon at first, but after a while the barleywine base is fully revealed, even taking on some porter/stout elements in the process. Even better, it never becomes overly sweet at any point (TAKE SOME NOTES, THE BRUERY!) The only thing I can quibble about is how the complexity takes a while to really hit the palate. Unlike many BA brews, this doesn't reward instant gratification...no, it rewards those willing to drink a whole bomber solo. And that my friends, is what drinking beer is all about. (4.5)
4.28/5: Most drinkable barleywine ever? 2,812 charactersThisWangsChung, Feb 05, 2015

I get heavy almond upfront followed by toffee, coconut, vanilla, mild earthy hops with just a hint of alcohol. The flavor follows the nose pretty closely with a bigger emphasis on the toffee caramel flavors. There is a bit of booziness, but it is quite welcoming and subtle. This is interesting because it is the first time that I've had a bourbon barrel aged beer where the booze melds with the beer so perfectly that it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. 563 charactersBenwayPHD, Jan 28, 2015

Have not had this before.  As soon as you pop the hood, you know this is something special.  Smells awesome- malty, coconut, pineapple. a little licorice when it warms.  Tastes truly incredible.  Sweet, malty, caramel, still getting the coconut.  A little boozier as it warms.  Nicely carbonated.  Coats the tongue, but still feels somewhat light.
This is just a great beer- no surpise really, coming from FW.  Hope I'm lucky enough to get the 2015.  Hope you are too. 516 charactersstortore, Jan 24, 2015

Still a fair amount of alcohol heat, but the big surprise was the relative dominance of bitter flavors over sweet. All the standard FW flavors are there, though oak and toffee are at the fore.

A finger's of tightly packed crisp rich velvety light khaki colored head...  Limited retention gives way to an ultra inviting full perfectly uniform veil of lacing which ultimately turns a bit splotchy with a small collar...  The color is a deep slightly brooding garnet...  A light to moderate bit of carbonation rises at a slightly sluggish pace towards the top of the glass...  The nose is deep, rich and inviting...  Loaded with warm bready malts...  Vanilla...  Brown sugar...  Light oak notes...  Fig...  Raisins...  Sweet plums...  Well rounded...  Deep and complex...  The palate is not nearly as deep nor complex...  It is loaded with oak and booze...  Both of which slightly overwhelm the barleywine beneath which I'm fairly certain is trying to shine...  Medium bodied...  Sturdy...  Light yet sharply carbonated...  A touch of lushness to start before a wave of dryness overcomes and lasts throughout...  An astringent booziness rises on the finish...  A solid English Barleywine (though if given a blind taste test I would have considered this either an American Barleywine or American Strong Ale)...  Given all the praise for this brew, I expected world class but this one falls a bit short...  Perhaps more time in the bottle would do this justice and the barrel aging seems to obscure the base brew...  As is, the end result is a bit less than the sum of its parts... 1,395 charactersphilbe311, Jan 01, 2015

Looks: very deep amber ruby color with a slight creamy white head the encircles the glass
Smell: Smells of wood and alcohol, the amount of alcohol I smell has me worried I tend to not like Beers that are to heavy on the alcohol.
Taste: Can't get past the amount of bourbon and alcohol. This beer may be a favorite for many but definitely not for me.
Mouth Feel: Gotta say though, I like the mouth feel. very soft and has a nice warming sensation.
If you're looking for a really deep, bourbon like ale than Firestone Sucaba/Abacus would be a strong choice. If you're not a fan of strong alcoholic beverages that taste like bourbon and wood I'd stay away. 708 charactersJon_Gamer, Dec 30, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm generally against rating beers as 5s. I don't think there is such a thing as a perfect beer. But I'll be damned if I could find a fault in this one. It has a beautiful clear ruby red pour with a nice white head that lingers for a while. Hints of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, and wood explode from the nose and explode on your taste buds. The bourbon is present but not overpowering like other BBA beers I've had. It still allows the other flavors of the beer to shine. It's incredibly smooth and full bodied with the alcohol incredibly well hidden. 
While I am not a huge barleywine fan, I do enjoy them from time to time and I can appreciate the style. This one is head and shoulders above the rest. Hell, it's head and shoulders above anything I've had. 772 charactersPSU_Mike, Dec 26, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75One of my most sought after beers. Love barley wines. 2013 vintage from the bottle into tulip glass. 
Look: box says dark ruby red and that's accurate. Reddish brown, some murkiness, minimal head or lacing. Darker coloring than your typical barley wine. 
Smell: amazing! Vanilla, sweet caramel, toffee, coconut, bourbon, tobacco smokiness, leather, can notice a boozy note as well. Very sweet, smells like an incredible dessert laced with liquor. 
Taste: burnt sugar, molasses, tobacco, toffee, vanilla, smoke, ripe dark fruits like dates, figs, cherries, bourbon, whiskey, oak. Of the barrel influences the bourbon is most pronounced on the nose while in taste whiskey and oak shines through more. The malt is almost like a scotch whiskey. Most surprising note to me is the smoky, peat-like tobacco flavor, was not expecting that. Really contrasts with the sweetness of the caramel and toffee. 
Feel: tad more carbonated than expected. Nice chewy, thick mouth feel. Almost grainy. Pleasant and doesn't get in the way of the many contrasting bold flavors on display in taste and smell. 
Overall: the bar was set extremely high here with the top ratings and being a staple of FW's barrel aging program. I think it met those expectations. Perhaps the most complex beer I've had. There's a significant amount of barrel influence in the nose and taste from bourbon, whiskey and oak. And there's a lot of sweetness along with a smoky tobacco flavor that I assume comes from the barrel aging. They all mesh together excellently. This is the top barley wine I've had. FW continues to astound with their skill. 1,607 charactersMonkeyBread, Dec 22, 2014

Aroma-dark fruit, burned sugar, vanilla,oak
Taste-burned sugar and dark fruity sweetness upfront, balanced by smooth vanilla and oak, faintest bite from the booze but drinks very smoothly.
Feel-moist upfront, full bodied yet surprisingly carbonated.
overall-delicous, satisfying, great representative of the style. love the effect of the oak on this one. 504 charactersSteveB24, Nov 24, 2014

22 oz brown bottle with an elegant black foil covering the cap and just barely running down the neck. Off white label with old gold and deep red colors giving it an amazing style. This thing comes in a box! These FW barrel aged brews just scream quality and class. Poured into an authentic Firestone Walker stemmed proprietors tulip glass. 
A - deep brown in color with dark ruby highlights running through In magnificent fashion. Tan head pours decent in size but settles quickly into a thin ring of cover leaving minimal stick. §ucuba poured into a proprietor glass is one of the best looks you'll find in the craft beer world. Stunning and beautiful.
S - rich dark fruits, coconut, sweet bourbon character, vanilla, and a hint of chocolate make this wonderful on the nose. A real nuttiness in the back end with sweet barrel notes laying off shot after shot in your nose. 
T - sweet bourbon and whisky barrel flavor up front. A touch of dark fruit, coconut, hints of layered chocolate, and toffee. Slight nuttiness And a mild toasted malt character are found if you dig deep for it. Almost like a candied dark fruit with more sweet barrel notes are hit just before a alcohol like spice finish. Layer upon layer of barrel aged goodies are rolled gracefully over the palate leaving you remembering the prior sip before the next slurp even touches your tongue. Absolutely incredible flavor. 
M - big, full body though as smooth as anything you'll ever experience. Thickness is out of this world and apply to its easy going smooth texture. Coats and coats and coats with its brilliant notes of goodness. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and only adds to its flavor. 
O - §ucuba is a damn fine brew and world class on any planet in our galaxy. It may be my favorite in fact. If there was one I could have every evening after dinner without question it would be this lovely majesterial barley wine, §ucuba. Brilliant 1,965 charactersBradtheGreat7, Oct 23, 2014

2013 vintage. on 10.15.14
Deep ruddy mahogany with a little brown head. Dissipates, but lacing down the sides.
The bourbon barrel steps forward offering itself first. Sweet and boozy dark fruits, vanilla and tobacco.
Taste follows suit: sweet bourbon starts us off, with some oak and vanilla Prunes, leather, raisins... all the things you want and more! Yummm
Super smoothe. Alcohol is incredibly well blended in, as it manifests itself more as a light spice than any sort of heat. Not sure if that's it being a year old or if that's just the masters at FW doing their thing. Mild carbonation doesn't get in the way of the sticky, medium body. Finish 1s sweet initially (thanks Abbey), but has a touch of bitter... closer to the tobacco on the nose than a particularly hoppy note.
I love barleywines. I've never had a bad beer from FW. I thoroughly enjoy BA beers, and bourbon in general. All of this comes together about as you'd expect: this is an amazing beer, and I will continue to pick a couple up each year. I suggest you do the same. 1,065 characterskemoarps, Oct 16, 2014

As the pool rises the color becomes a darker brown with autumn leaf red/brown highlights.  Tan head mostly small bubbles, goes away pretty quickly.  Not really much in the way of lacing.  
Smell is really good, probably the best part about it in my opinion.  Hints of dark dehydrated fruits (fig, dates, raisons, and maybe some dark cherries).  There's also plenty of oak, vanilla, toffee, cinnimon and some slight sweet chocolate.  Finishes with hints of sweet tobacco and leather.
Taste is almost as good as the smell, but not quite as good.  Same sweet flavors as the aromas.  Lots of toffee, oak, vanilla, and the above mentioned dehydrated fruits.  Also the same hints of cinnamon and a bit of chocolate.  Very spicy; nice overall.  
Mouthfeel's good, certainly full bodied with a nice lingering flavor.  The carbonation is low, which works very well for it.  Fairly smooth when I expected it to be a little gritty.  Since it's so full flavored it starts of big and sweet, gets slightly bitter in the middle, then goes to a dry bitter finish like a red wine.  The one thing is it's a little hotter than I prefer, but gets much easier the more you drink.  Speaking of which, it's really drinkable.  Really good overall beer.  Firestone Walker really continually produces amazing products, and probably the best barrel aging program out there. 1,460 charactersAndyAvalanche, Oct 03, 2014

A: One finger of head formed when poured from the bomber into a snifter glass and fell in under a minute leaving behind a small ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass. The foam is tan in color and made of medium sized bubbles mostly. Nice alcohol legs are kicked up on the edge of the glass when swirled, but very little foam. The beer is a deep mahogany color and that color only comes through with a back lite.
S: Sweet bourbon dominates the nose with oak and vanilla right behind it, medium levels.  Raisins and prunes with sweet plums come next at mild levels. A light spicy hop character. Candy raisins and toffee notes also present. Alcohol is mellow and mostly in the form of bourbon. Nicely developed after the 2 years it was cellared.
T: Wow, beautiful bourbon barrel character. Smooth and tobacco tasting bourbon with vanilla, caramel oak flavor - very developed and up front. Sweetness is kept to a minimum and seems to be reduced by the bourbon. Bitterness is medium with a more neutral hop character. Malty flavors come through as the beer warms up with prunes and plums consistent with the aroma. Some milk chocolate notes come out as well.
M: A big tingly tongue sensation from the bourbon that leads to a nice warming sensation from the alcohol. Carbonation is on the lower side and very complimentary with the style. The tannins from the wood provide a slight drying sensation on the mouth and the body of the beer is in the medium range.
O: Fantastic BA Barley Wine, The barrel is up front with tons of character from the bourbon left over. The alcohol is there, but not offensive or difficult to drink. This beer aged perfectly. I would like to try a fresh version to compare, but as it stands this was superb. 1,745 charactersguityler83, Sep 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.1%I'm not much of a barley wine drinker. Sucaba definitely makes an exception. It has a strong nose on it, pour a nice dark color. Has a a strong flavor profile and still goes down smooth. It pours a dark color with a tan head that doesn't last long. It has aromas or fruits, malts, sweetness and alcohol of course. It has strong notes of spices, dates, figs, caramel, wood-aged. It is strong but is very smooth on the palate. This is my first one, 2014 edition and will be buying more of these in the future!! 508 charactersClints1991, Sep 18, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%2013 Vintage.  Poured into a snifter, the beer is a dark, cloudy, opaque, caramel-toffee coloring with a sparse coating of light tan head that recedes into a halo. Nose of rich caramel, molasses, apples, toffee, booze, roasted nuts, date and fig, wood spice, and earthy notes.  Some highlights of raw honey and sugar candy, too. Wow! Flavors of rich sweetness, layered indefinitely, with notes of caramel, honey, toffee, sugar candy, roasted notes, butterscotch, booze, and earthy highlights. Quickly warming in mouth, with a dose of hops bitterness to keep some semblance of balance. Heavy and big. The body is robust and smooth, with an underlying dryness. The aftertaste is almost like candy, with a heavy dose of old world fruit and booze. Tangy and richly sweet linger on a smooth, drawn out finish. Very solid brew. 822 charactersGarthDanielson, Sep 03, 2014

4.38/5  rDev -1.8%500th rating!!!! Pretty exciting day. Been off BA for the past week or so because of visiting friends and try decided what I would rate. I picked this beer because I wanted to do something special and this one the only beer I was aging that I felt would be both great and good to go (aging wise) for today (maybe not perfect but close enough). Poured into a snifter and paired with almonds, water, and a movie with occasional breaks to think and rate. 
A&S: Woody, vanilla, lots of dark fruits (raisins) as it warms. Surprisingly as it warms I get more of a hoppy presence than before. Quite complex. Head is initially very fizzy causing me to think the head was going to die fast, however it does hang around in a thin top layer. Light brown colored head. Bottle nails the color as dark ruby. Pretty lively carbonation. 
T&M: Not nearly as in my face as I expected in the taste. A little boozy, it has a very solid malty, dark fruit mix. I’m tasting more cherries than raisins in the taste. Very smooth even without being super thick as far as body.
Overall: Not my favorite English Barleywine, but it was up there. Felt it could be a tad bit more sweet and intense in favor, but the aroma was spot on. I would be interested to see how more aging would affect this beer, but honestly, since it was more mellow than I expected, now was probably a better time to drink it. One of the few big ABV over 12oz bottles I would recommend not sharing. This beer has a extremely long development time, unless you drink it super slow you miss out on more than the usual brew. 1,571 charactersminterro, Sep 01, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +5.4%2014, bomber poured into tulip glass
A-pours a rich dark black that fills the glass like oil. Small off white head that dissipates very quickly into an outer lace.
S- tons of bourbon, rich, malty, sweet and hot. Some dark fruit . Overall it is a very sweet hot smell.
T- bourbon first, then a blend of sugar and vanilla. There's a sweet taste of berries but I can't pick up on which one. There also might be some cherries in there.
M- full bodied, thick, hot and creamy!
O-one of my top barleywines.  It rivals king henry and bcbbw in my opinion. The heat keeps it from being perfect  but I will definitely seek these out in the future. 642 charactersmlhyatt, Aug 28, 2014

The first taste is all dried fruit. Prunes, raisins, etc. The follow is of a dry sec port. More in the dried fruit vein, but more full in the fluids.
04/16/14 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. 
As I set about the task of trying to capture all that's going on in my mouth/nasal area, I'm struck by how this drink actually is not refreshing. Perhaps it's the cloying. 
In the world of port wines, I find their sweet-yet-astringent taste has a mildly refreshing aspect due to a dry finish. 
I guess the problem is that I'm drinking this taste marvel with out the benefit of counterpoint. It's extremely smooth. Deceptively so. The 13% ABV is not so much masked as assimilated into the whole. 
The oak & bourbon are in the front row all dressed in a rich vanilla, with a slightly less chocolate aroma that manifests very subtly. 
My problem here is trying to decide what accompaniments will help & which will hamper. 
The rarity doesn't help the prospects of finding a solution but I refuse to be deterred. 
I'll just have to have another.

A - Warm ruby body with a foamy latte-colored head. As the head settled down, a nice lacing of foam lingered on the sides of the glass.
S - Very rich and tantalizing - caramel, vanilla, cherry and plum dominate. A whiff of alcohol astringency and a peat-like smokiness.
T - Warm toffee and caramel lead of the tasting. The come wave upon wave of vanilla, dark cherry, and dates. The malt has a caramel sweetness to it. The finish has a bit of whiskey and oak.
M - Thick but not overly sticky. Carbonation is pleasantly toward the low side.
O - A great barrel-aged beer. Whereas most of the barrel-aged beers tend to taste more like bourbon, the English-inspired malts in this barleywine lend a more Scotch whiskey flavor. Worth checking out, even thought it is expensive. 819 charactersporter_collie, Aug 06, 2014

Aromas of raisins, plums, roasted malts, and bourbon are most prevalent, a little sharp in the nose for my taste.
Dark fruits, slight vanilla, mainly sweet malt, finished with a splash of bourbon.
Mouthfeel is the only score here that did worse off, though a delicious beer, the mouthfeel of this is too grainy (IMO).
Overall this is another delicious example of Firestone doing everything right. 480 characterslarryarms847, Jul 27, 2014

4.31/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A - Very dark ruby red. Head was a a little soapy and coarse-grained for my liking.
S - Predominantly sweet and fruity. Fruitiness is of raisins and sherry. Sweetness is of maple and caramel. My favourite part of this beer.
T - I'm picking up the sherry-fruitiness from the nose, although not any one fruit in particular. Not as sweet as I would have expected and not particularly sweet overall. I was hoping for a little more vanilla, a little more coconut and a little more spice. Where this beer is not found wanting is in tobacco flavours. This beer had me racking my brain to see if I had a cigar stashed somewhere in the house. It's sort of dirty and a tad leathery but I like it. A little bitter malt and bitter bourbon on the finish as well.
M - Thick enough, but like the rest of the beer it's just not quite there.
O - At first I was quite disappointed, however this beer definitely benefits from time spent in the glass. The most relatable beer I've had to Sucaba lately was Fremont's Bourbon Abominable, which for me, was clearly the superior beer. This was malty, sweet and sherry-like with nice tobacco notes, but I wanted more bourbon, coconut, vanilla, oak and spice. Sadly it did not live up to expectation. 1,228 charactersabeeronthebeach, Jul 24, 2014

Pours a caramel color beer, dark. I don't remember any carbonation, maybe a light foam around the edges of the glass. I smelled some oak, some brandy, but all very faint, and the beer doesn't really lead you anywhere. Taste reveals a sweet barleywine, very light, not heady, not strong, but very tasty. Not many notes picked up. Body is medium, not a light bodied beer. 393 charactersJulioH, Jul 20, 2014

Sixty degrees out and rainy and it's Barleywine time in the middle of an Oklahoma July. 
The tan head is thin and fleeting. Color is dark brown, near black. 
Fresh baked brown bread wafts to the nose, followed by cherry, burnt sugar, subtle caramel and some rye way off yonder. 
Tastes of sweet bread, more cherries, allspice and caramel. Has a bitterness that is hard to discern, but it's there. Leaves a nice coating of syrup on the lips.
You could call this delicate if it weren't for the bold, lingering, fusel alcohol. You could also call-it dessert-like, and on that count you would be completely correct. 
I recommend opening this one for an occasion. It is that good.
********
2013 vintage.
Dark brown and ruddy with a tan froth.  Aroma is boozy with prominent notes of cherry, plum and brown bread.  Burnt sugar and licorice are also noticed before a hint of herb.  A sugary sweetness is quickly countered by grain, beer bread, various dark fruits, faint pepper and hops.  Goes down smooth with a nicely blended fusel alcohol warmth and no evidence of wear from the aging.  Medium carbonation leaves this beer open and free.  
Absolutely fantastic and no fucking plastic. 1,206 charactersstephens101, Jul 19, 2014
4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Very balanced and extremely drinkable for a barleywine. Alcohol is present only in the aftertaste giving a warming sensation as it goes down. The barrel is very present, along with a lot of caramel and even some hops on the finish. Syrupy body, very easy to drink. 264 charactersCiocanelu, Jul 18, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: The beer was a cloudy shade of black with an off-white colored head crowning the glass.
Smell: The nutty notes jump to the front, but malt and bourbon are also very detectable.
Taste: I love the nuttiness that starts the taste. Nuts, caramel, sweet milk chocolate notes balance in the taste. The bourbon does not overwhelm the taste, but lends itself to balance. The warming aftertaste makes each of the taste notes glow a little brighter. This is orgasmic!
Moutheel; The mouthfeel is a little syrupy and resembles a port. Of course, this allows the taste to linger for an exceptional amount of time.
Overall: This is my first perfect score on BA; I really can not say anything bad about it. I certainly wish it was more accessible. 748 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jul 13, 2014

A: an inky shade of plum with a light, soapy whitish head
S: delicious aromas of mellow bourbon, caramel, thick brown sugar, vanilla, and booze-soaked cherries or figs
T: the dominant flavor was burnt brown sugar and vanilla-bourbon sweetness. there's also a bit of tart dark cherry flavor and chocolate-covered coconut shavings. the finish had some light char and tobacco notes. this beer gets nice and boozy as it came to room temperature.
M: vinous and lightly syrupy, with some resin and heat on the finish. nice, but a bit lacking; i would've liked it a bit thicker and creamier.
O: an outstanding BA barleywine. aroma is top-notch and flavors are delightful, but mouthfeel left a bit to be desired. 765 charactersblankenhoney, Jul 07, 2014

Soothing aroma of figs and dates, alcohol, caramel, tobacco. Toasty roasted malt flavor with an equally satisfying boozy warmth; raisins and plums; a cinnamon-like spiciness. Heavy bodied and thick sweetness with a dry element to the feel due to the ABV.
A well-done take on the barley wine style. Rich, deeply complex flavors, and great sensory experiences with aroma and mouthfeel. This beer was tried two years+ after it's release date and seemed to age well, still packing plenty of punch and delivering exceptional flavors. 598 charactersbeergoot, Jul 03, 2014

Had this on tap at the Old Toad in a properly kept and poured keg, so I will re-review the beer and change the score. The old review will be kept for history purposes or whatever. Original scores- 4/4.25/4.25/2/4.25
The aromas and flavors are similar, but a bit more amplified with the proper amount of carbonation. Looks the same, essentially. Tons of brown sugar, toffee, caramel, cherry, dark fruits, coconut, and bourbon in both the taste and aroma. Great mouthfeel, thick, but not crazily so. A much better beer now.
On tap at the Owl House in Rochester, NY.
Pours a dark red brown-ish. Visible active carbonation. One inch head forms quickly, but dissipates very quickly as well. Not much lacing.
Aromas include brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon, bourbon, chocolate, and cherry.
Lots of similar flavors. The bourbon is well integrated, and the barrel aging provides oak and vanilla flavors- with a lot great barleywine flavors- toffee, caramel, chocolate, cherry, with a slightly noticeable alcohol kick.
A bit of a weird mouthfeel here, and makes me feel like the keg wasn't filled properly. The body is a bit thin, with the most carbonation in a barleywine I've ever tasted. The thin body could just be the high carbonation playing tricks on my taste buds- but the carbonation keeps some of the flavors kind of muted. I can tell the flavors are great, but I know I'm not getting the full effect.
I can tell this beer is great, but I want to try it again, either out of bottle or a properly kept keg. 1,516 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 18, 2014

T: bourbon, butterscotch liqueur, toasted coconut, dark fruit, sweet, oak bitterness, boozy, complex

O: This barrel-aged beauty is a sipper, and gets even better at the end of the bottle. Is even more complex as it becomes less cold. I find myself wanting more. Definitely world class -- what a beer! 396 charactersTastesalot, Jun 17, 2014

O - Very solid, although I'm not intrigued to plunk down the dough for a bottle. I can't help but compare it with Bourbon County BW. I like how the BC BW finishes with the stout/chocolate flavors. 410 charactersgaruda, Jun 16, 2014

Appearance: Dark red, amber color with some ruby on the edges, a vanilla colored head that dissipates pretty quickly. Head is gone within a few minutes after the pour, no lacing. Looks beautiful in the glass, fairly clear. 
Smell: Very sweet aroma, coconut, some toffee, not a lot of alcohol on the nose.
Taste: Nearly same as smell, getting some alcohol on the flavor, nice sweet coconut, the bourbon is not as prevalent as the other flavors, very smooth, the flavors flow really well.
Mouthfeel: Little to no carbonation, not very thick, some heat on the tongue from the alcohol.
Overall: Another winner from Firestone's barrel program. First time having this and will definitely pick up in the future. A world class beer, worth a try. 788 charactersBrolo75, Jun 08, 2014

Smell: toffee and maple sweetness followed by bourbon and a little bit of oak. Some alcohol. 
Taste: strong bourbon, oak, and alcohol taste. Underlying layer is full of malts, from toffee to nutty and maple. 
Mouthfeel: medium to heavy. A little on the dry side. Some alcohol warmth. 
Overall: ehhh. I think the bourbon English barley wine has a lot more potential. The bourbon seems to clash with the malts rather than adding to. I think it would be a little better with some age though 661 charactersSportsandJorts, Jun 06, 2014

A- pours a dark brown in color with some ruby hue creeping through when brought up to the light, small fizzy light-khaki head eventually reduces, leaving just a ring around the edges with small carbonation bubbles shooting to the top
S- huge aromas of caramel malt is complimented by sweet toffee, maple syrup, dark fig, plumb & raisin, concord grape, dark cherry juice, rum and sherry. The barrel gives aromas of oak, walnut, toasted coconut, vanilla and bourbon. The aromas seem to go on for days.
T- caramel and toffee flavors consume the palate up front, notes of toasted coconut, graham cracker and brown sugar kick in, followed by black cherry juice and a toasted walnut nuttiness. Oaky barrel juice kick in with more caramel flavor on the linger with hints of bourbon and vanilla bean. The caramel lingers on the palate long after
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slighty foamy mouthfeel and a creamy and chewy finish, lots of alcohol warmth on the linger, that is needed to stand up to the plethora of flavors and aromas
O- the longer I sip this beer, the more flavor and aromas come out, the complexity is unlike any other beer. It drinks pretty hot, but actually is needed for such a big beer. I can't wait to try one with some age on it to see how it changes 1,327 charactersTreyliff, Jun 03, 2014

A: An almost perfect mahogany in color; the viscous, weighty brew forms almost no head on a moderate pour. 
S: Caramelly, boozy bouquet. The aromas are anchored by the huge malt-backbone, with notes of oak and vanilla and anise adding complexity and layers.  There's a hint of bubblegum at the edge of the bouquet. 
T: Even more layered than the nose, the flavors slowly unravel in distinct components. The front is vanilla-sweet, with notes of licorice and bubblegum. Oaky, toasty in the middle, with drying spice notes, paprika and pepper. The finish is boozy, a little phenolic, and long, with sticky residuals between sips. 
M: Actually, not quite as chewy as expected, but no question a full-bodied beer. Light carbonation amplifies the viscous complexion. 
Some time ago I would have put barleywines at the bottom of my go-to list. I find beers like Bigfoot and Old Guardian somewhat of a chore to drink. Barrel-aging completely changed my opinion, and I look forward to Firestone's annual release of this incredible brew. 1,064 charactersrand, May 19, 2014

It lives up to the expectations. This is a lovely beer. The barrel effect is flavourful and adds a great deal, but does not overpower the base beer, which is terrific. Caramel, bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla and light fruits/berries. The flavour is big, but not the overpowering intensity that I expected - this is a good thing. It is remarkable how drinkable this beer is given its potency. First rate stuff - now I just have to try and find more. A lot more. 558 charactersjrenihan, May 18, 2014

The deepest darkest of black tar colours, had a majestically stout head of dense brown foam.
The nose is so fragrant and smooth with chocolate, caramel, toffee and char. The nose has almost a second side as date, prune and dark candied fruit become apparent. The nose than turns once more to chocolate fudge brownie.
The flavors are silky chocolate, coconut, vanilla, oak, fudge and a wisp of bourbon creme.
The feel is so velvety smooth and seductive that it's hard to give it justice. The thickness simply coats the mouth and throat.
This is unbelievable...simply unbelievable! 589 charactersKYGunner, May 14, 2014

Very little on the nose, other than vanilla. It's an incredibly subtle aroma; even as it warms, just a bit of bourbon comes through, and maybe a hint of coconut and chocolate.
Incredible panoply of flavors immediately assaults the palate: toasted coconut, vanilla, and fried banana. Sweeter base bourbon and oak are firmly in the background. Plenty of caramel and molasses, as well. Some chocolate.
Very noticeable sting, but not too much heat. Smooth. Medium overall feel.
This is an incredibly complex beer that hits you with multiple flavors from first sip, and continues until the glass is empty. Absolutely fantastic. 728 charactersRoguer, May 13, 2014

You need to get your hands on one of these as if this is how barleywine should taste and it doesn't hurt the vanilla aromas and the nice smooth oaky background of the barrel aged process. Good luck on getting one of these and enjoy! 364 charactersTooch321, May 11, 2014

Enjoyed out of a brown 22 oz bomber with no bottling date, but a vintage of "2013" marked clearly on the label along with other beer stats like OG, FG, IBU and more. Poured into a large 20 oz snifter.
Appearance - Pours a murky chestnut brown with a twinge of clay red giving the hue some warmth. Atop the body sits a khaki cream colored frothy head, about a finger thick. The foam dissipates after a few minutes, leaving just spots of film intermittently along the surface of the glass, and a faint ringlet around the edge. Lacing is nonexistent.
Smell - Heavy notes of caramel (of course), but this one goes deeper, with richer, sweeter notes of toffee, brown sugar and molasses. Alongside the sweetness are flavors of coconut, vanilla bean, and dried fruit, like figs and golden raisins. The heat of the barrel is there as well, with faint notes of bourbon and oak tannins. So rich and succulent, I'm almost remiss to begin drinking it. Almost.
Taste - While I loved the aroma, the taste somehow kicks it up a notch. Every flavor that seemed to waft out of the glass is present on the tongue as well. Rich, creme brulee toffee and caramel and coconut, with a heavier influence from the barrel this time around, preventing the wonderfully sweet aroma from becoming cloying or off-putting. Finish has a healthy amount of heat that creates a warming sensation. I also pick up more of the grains in the taste than I did in the aroma. Rustic barley and oats are a subtle compliment to the sweet and estery profiles.
Mouthfeel - Medium-to-full bodied and moderate carbonation. Honestly, I'm surprised/impressed by how dynamic the mouthfeel is from the carbonation. Much more tingling feel than I expected. There is also the warming note in the chest from the alcohol--I guess that would be chestfeel?
Overall, it's yet another BA take on a style that I'm quickly falling in love with. Were it not for the unconventionally unique take on the style that GI released in 2013, this would be the benchmark. Heck, it probably still is, especially as they continue to release it every year when BCBW will likely be a one time thing. I will have to make a point of getting my hands on this as often as I can. 2,267 charactersLambicPentameter, May 04, 2014

English Barleywine
12.5% ABV 
APPEARANCE: Pours a mud puddle brown with a deep ruby red rim variation. Zero head on my pour, second pour was a hard pour that produced a very small halo of off white bubbles with small spotted lacing. 
AROMA: In your face Bourbon barrel. Huge amounts of chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, caramel. Very reminiscent of a Port wine.
TASTE: Like I just had a fig newton while sipping on a jammy glass of red wine. Lots of dark fruits, that sweetness in the nose comes through on the taste as well. A lot of the barrel comes through and gives a nice oakiness. Very flamboyant beer with an immense amount of layers. 
MOUTHFEEL: Very smooth and delicate. Medium body with a light prickly carbonation that gives a nice bubble dance on the tongue. Nice lingering sweet finish. 
OVERALL: An amazing sweet English Barleywine that highlights the barrel exceptionally well. The nose on this beer was the highlight for me even as it warmed it revealed more and more. Definitely a sipping beer, went well with the movie I was watching "Gravity" yup just did a beer movie pairing suggestion!

A: Pours a deep brown with a hint of burgundy when held to the light. One finger frothy off white head that settled fairly quickly to a small ring around the edges. Some slight lacing.
S: Wonderful aromas coming from this one, Sweet caramel, bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, stone fruits.
T: Follows the nose fairly closely. Maybe a hint of banana and coconut in the back.
M: I found it a bit thin at first, but it seemed to improve as it warmed. Fairly lightly carbonated but not unexpected given the style and ABV. 
O: I can see why this is a highly respected barleywine. One of my new favorites. I just need to get my hands on a 2014 bottle now. 704 charactersrichj1970, Apr 27, 2014

Smell is dark fruit, vanilla, and soy sauce in a this Chinese restaurant uses way too much sauce, kind of way. Taste is sweet and dark fruits and soy sauce with a quick finish. At least the booze is hidden very well, but with the lack of almost any carbonation, cloying nature of it and the soy sauce flavor, it was a big disappointment. 380 charactersJDV, Apr 21, 2014

4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is one of my favorite barleywines, and it never lets you down as far as barrel aged beers and that wonderful vanilla flavor they can impart. This beer goes down too easy for being 13%.
It pours a dark orange color with a very small head that falls to not much.
Smell is toffee, bourbon, caramel, toasted barley, vanilla, and coconut.
Taste is the same, but add in the alc taste that just seems to accompany the beer flavors instead of overpower it. It doesn't taste hot really, but you do notice it. Perhaps gets better with age.
Feel is low carb and full of calories. Just a huge beer.

The pour is a dark brown, with a solid head at the beginning that fades pretty quickly. The smell is sweet caramel with light vanilla and oak. Surprisingly little alcohol for the ABV. The taste is similar, lots of caramel, minimal booze. I find this a lot less sweet than similar beers of this style (say Bourbon County Barleywine). This is really easy drinking due to the low sweetness and despite the ABV. Definitely my favorite barrel-aged barleywine. 519 charactersmc4z, Apr 14, 2014

I've got to dissent from the consensus, even though I'm a huge fan of British tootsy-rolly barley wines (one of my favorite styles ever). 
Nose was good. Huge vanilla. Soft and nuanced caramel. Some nakedly boozy aromas not really on-style but enjoyable nonetheless.
But in the mouth I found it alcohol-hot, lightly oxidized and relentlessly blasting me with simple, inelegant, almost artificial vanilla (plus perhaps a trace of diacetyl, but that could be my imagination given that FW is usually such a clean brewer). Like a really clever cream soda spiked with rum. There's not much in the way of flavor layering, or variance/progression, or tertiary flavors. Just a big inelegant wallop of front/center vanilla...and booze.
I suspect they warm-age this beer to hasten the maturity. You lose a lot of subtlety and complexity that way. 902 charactersJimLeff, Apr 11, 2014

Appearance – The beer pours a super deep copper color with thick tow finger of tan colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the beer is quite a caramel and toffee smell mixed with a ton of fruit aromas ranging from darker stone fruits to lighter fruits. Apple, cherry, raisin, are the strongest with hints of other fruits within. A good deal of oak and lot of bourbon booziness are there as well creating a very warming smell overall.
Taste – The taste begins big caramel and butterscotch flavor. A big bready and doughy flavor is there as well. A bourdon and vanilla flavor begin working their way onto the tongue along with the caramel and toffee transitions to a molasses and brown sugar flavor. A ton of oaky bourbon booziness hits the tongue toward the middle to the end of the taste with some dark fruit flavors starting to be sensed as well. The booziness gets a bit hot at the very end and is combine with a bit of a herbal and earthy hop flavor to leave a very warming and sweet flavor on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are quite appropriate for the style and match the huge sweet and boozy of the flavors rather well, making for a rather slow sipper. 
Overall – A bit on the boozy and oaky side with a ton of sweetness. A rather robust Barley wine. Not one I would likely frequent frequently, but a nice on to try none the less. 1,613 charactersDarkmagus82, Apr 10, 2014

A - Darker than I remember.  I thought it was pure orange, but it's really quite dark.  Looks almost like a quad.  It's a very dark amber/brown with virtually no head.  Meh, still a 3.
N - Whoa.  Tons of barrel.  Vanilla, maybe a bit of coconut, actually quite bitter smelling.  Delish.
T - Yeah, it's pure vanilla.  I get virtually nothing else.  Just like I remember.  A slight bitterness, but mostly just sweet vanilla.  Sublime.
M - I think I'll actually lower this from a 5 to a 4.  I have to slosh it around for a while before I get the real good coating and frothiness that I like so much.  Still extremely well-crafted.
O - A true classic. 758 charactersCraftFan5, Apr 07, 2014

8-6-16 - Enjoyed a 2014 bottle in a tulip glass. Aroma is OUTSTANDING!  Color is Dark Ruby, as described. Slight caramel head. Flavors are intense for this sipping beer. I have one more 2014 bottle to have in a few months. Awesome. 272 charactersGregaroo, Apr 03, 2014

4.88/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This beer is big, bold, and has an absolutely lovely finish. Honestly the best barley wine I have had to date (thoughts are its the bourbon influence). The alcohol is extremely well hidden and the nose is mainly comprised of rich fruits including dates, figs, and plums (brown sugar compliments as well). Firestone has again done a fabulous job with their barrel aging program.
A-deep amber with a slight cream colored head that stays consistently throughout drinking the beer.
S-again sweet with rich fruits and brown sugar.
T-the most balanced bourbon barrel aged beer I have experienced. The alcohol is so well hidden its scary.
M-great level of carbonation. No flavor bullys the others into submission.
O-oh man. This is a top notch beer. Worth every penny. Interested to see how aging a bottle will turn out. Cheers from Oak Street Draft House in Denton, Tx! 868 charactersjmadiadora19, Apr 03, 2014

A - Looks beautiful in the glass. Nice dark brown color with tints of orange and copper. Beautiful, foamy head, thick and tight.
S - Tons of vanilla, caramel, mild pepper. The bourbon is fairly mild but still noticeable after a year of aging.
T - Caramel, mild sweetness, malty backbone. As smooth as a beer can get. Oak flavors still come through.
M - Just the right feel, not too full and not too light. Almost a sticky feel, but nice anyway.
O - While aging this may mellow the alcohol, it also probably mellows the sweetness. Almost like a rare bourbon. Just outstanding. 594 charactersBeer-A-Lot, Apr 03, 2014

Looks beautiful. Brown and red, with a trace of white head that dissipates quickly. 
The smell is tremendous. You get bourbon, vanilla, tons of oak, toffee, that classic english barleywine style smell. 
The taste blew my mind. It follows the nose, times 10. There is absolutely nothing lacking in this beer. It is so incredibly well-balanced with the sweet, the booze, and wood, and mouthfeel. Just to die for.
Overall, don't buy this beer. I want them all. 547 charactersbball208, Apr 02, 2014

Mud, blood, light colored head sticking to the glass in a taunting manner.
Smell-
Rich and warm, sweet like caramel or toffee. The alcohol slips in and out.
Taste-
Flavor bomb that follows the nose, and the barrel accents really start to jump out. Once again, the alcohol is deceptive and hides well.
Mouthfeel-
Rich and sticky, like a barley wine should be.
Overall-
An excellent barleywine, grab it if you see it. A big shout out to my buddy who snatched it up at Hopscotch Bar in Franklin Park, to share with me. 531 charactersRope, Apr 01, 2014

A: A medium ruby brown color with a 1/2 finger of off-white foam on the pour which quickly becomes a thin head which then settles into no head whatsoever. Its expected. No lacing. 
S: Oh my. Toffee and caramel. Vanilla and bourbon oak. A little bit of alcohol, but in a positive way. Behind the barrel, you can pick up notes of dark fruit, particularly figs and plums. Lots of interesting things going on here and very enjoyable. Well constructed.
T: Again with the toffee and caramel. Very nice. The oaky, vanilla, barrel is very nice. The beer is well done, and I find the barrel to be at the forefront of the taste. Not cloying at all. The taste is very complicated and intricate. Many new sensations and tastes as you work your way through a glass. While some alcohol is noticeable, it is crazy to think that this is a 12.5% brew.
M: deliciously silky and enjoyable. Medium full which really compliments the flavors that are working here. The mouthfeel really adds to the enjoyment of the beer. 
O: Very enjoyable, and I need to find more bottles of this stuff. 1,114 characterspknyc, Mar 29, 2014

Snagged the last bottle from my local store just hours after it came in. Thanks to my brewing buddy Steve for the heads up. $17 a bomber. Here we go:
Pours up a dark ruby (like the bottle says) with a quickly dissipating khaki crown. Aroma is bourbon up front. Big bourbon. Vanilla, molasses, plums. Not the most broad range of aromas but very big and bold. Very pleasant. Flavor is big. I get all that was in the nose plus leather and diacetyl. Very earthy. Full bodied, very crispy carbo. Not as hot as one might expect a 13.5% brew to taste. Still there is a little fire inside every sip. 
Very solid brew. I'll come back and write a little more as my beer warms itself and I up a little.
*1 hour*
In a nutshell, propaganda comes to mind. Price versus Product. Pricey to make yet that doesn't always mean the best product. Leather, swamp, deceit, devil on your shoulder. Ya, not the brewers fault. Reasons beyond.... 937 charactersstumac, Mar 27, 2014

A: Pours a burgundy color and leaves a very thin head. Very little lacing.
S: Wow. Bourbon up front, with notes of vanilla, chocolate, and dark cherries. Some other smells in there too, can't quite put my finger on them though.
T: Bourbon notes dominate the palate on this one, but not overly so. Balances perfectly with notes of vanilla, chocolate, toffee, caramel, cherries, and other dark fruits. Some barrel-aged beers are too heavy on the oak notes, but this one is just perfect in my opinion.
M: Despite being highly alcoholic, this beer is extremely smooth. Full-bodied with just a slight bit of alcohol heat. Very drinkable. 
O: Fantastic. The smell and flavor of this beer are still fresh in my mind after a week. I drank two bottles this year and am aging another two. I'm excited to see how a bit of age affects this masterpiece. I wasn't too interested in barleywines before I tried this, but they have my attention now. Thank you, Firestone Walker, for another amazing offering. 1,052 charactersBedrocker, Mar 26, 2014

S Bourbon barrel is strong on the nose, followed by a caramel almost syrupy aroma. Lightly spiced with stone fruit (plum and cherry) on the backend. Lightly boozy.
T The taste follows the smell--bourbon barrel on the front end with booze following. There's a slight sting, though not in a bad way. Caramelly notes linger in the aftertaste, with a big barley warmth across the palate throughout the entire sip. The booze washes away some of the nuances, which is unfortunately because there are some big notes here. Toffee begins to enter the equation the further into the bottle you get. The cherry notes linger in the end and persevere through the alcohol wash. Much like Parabola, the beer becomes more and more complex the more and more you get into the bottle. 
M I'm pleased with the mouthfeel--not too sticky or oily. It is a bit slippery, though the carbonation level is pretty nice and rounds out that aspect of the beer. 
O Barleywine is not my go to style; however, this is yet another outstanding offering by Firestone Walker. I love the deep complexity of this beer in that it is not overwhelming or "in your face." It is a subtle, enjoyable drink. 1,320 charactersBingCrosby7, Mar 24, 2014

I'm not going to go through the review motions and simply wanted to point out that this beer is definitely worth purchasing if it is ever available to you.
I was fortunate to get my hands on this year's 2014 release as my local bottle-shop that I frequent had 5 on hand. (wish they also got parabola which is what I initially asked about) but this is certainly better than nothing!
So the appearance is good but not spectacular. No head and no lacing for me due to very high alcohol.
Smell is killer. Deep caramel, brown sugar, malt, dark cherry, booze, butter, faint bourbon/ oak background.
Tase follows nose excellently. 
Mouthfeel is nice thick and chewy with low carbonation.
Overall awesome beer that I really enjoyed and found worth the purchase ($18 at my shop) 
I did want to say that as amazing as it is a beer less expensive still retains the top spot for me for English Barleywines. Our Finest Regards by Pretty Things Brewing while not barrel aged represents the top of this style for me to date. 1,118 charactersoldmankoch, Mar 21, 2014

4.89/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52012 bottling. Poured from a bottle into a Lost Abbey Teku. The pour is very clear, yet very dark as well. The color is a deep mahogany with intense ruby-red highlights. It sports a thin head (not unusual for barrel-aged beers) which quickly dies down to a thin lace. The nose is spectacular. Lots of rich malt, sweet toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and oak. It's so sweet and rich and full, it defies description. It's like you're standing in a candy factory.
The beer has a very full body and a massive, sweet flavor profile. Up front are intense malt and caramel flavors, quickly followed up by bourbon, vanilla, hazelnuts, cocoa, and molasses. All the sweet flavors associated with the style just unfold perfectly on the palate, but the flavors never get so intense or rich as to betray the drinkability. There is a nicely metered alcohol warmth that greets you at the finish.
Overall, this is an amazing beer. There's nothing else I can compare it to except Bourbon County Brand Barleywine. In a head-to-head, I think I'd choose this one right now. The BCBBW is so unbelievably rich, it's difficult to drink. This one is also rich and intensely flavored, but much more smooth, refined, and balanced. With a little age, BCBBW might be more like this one, but right now it is not and I have to give a tip of the cap to this beer; my own personal champion of English-style Barleywines. 1,383 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Mar 20, 2014

Appearance - Hazy brown colour with a good size frothy beige coloured head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for around 5-6 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, caramel/butterscotch, dark fruits, leather, anise
Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, butterscotch/caramel, and dark fruits. There is also some vanilla and a bit of chocolate.
Overall - Love this stuff. My favourite style of beer and an array of flavours to keep it interesting. I'd like a little more barrel flavour, but maybe the taste has faded a little. Pricey, but definetly worth it to try it once at least. 757 charactersspinrsx, Mar 19, 2014

This beer is good, but not great and in my opinion nowhere near a 100 rating. 
Pours a very nice translucent deep brown red. Smell is ok, nothing really outstanding here.
Taste is muted, I can definitely tell it is a barleywine, but other than that nothing that really distinguishes it from your average "good beer". Taste is a bit watery from what I was expecting with this. It would be nice if this beer was a bit thicker.
Overall, very average, nothing really spectacular here. When I see a 100 rating backed up by so many reviews, I expect the beer to be a wow! This beer is nowhere near wow! 
This beer is massively overrated and should rate somewhere around the low 90s. 729 characters4thelvofbeer, Mar 18, 2014

The beer pours some off-white head that dissipates very quickly but still leaves a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is an opaque dark plum color. The beer has notes of very dark purple with black that strongly resemble plum. The smell is fairly complex with chocolate and caramel notes. Dark fruit smell that resembles plums with a bit of oak and a very concealed note of alcohol with a bit of barely smell. The strong notes are definitely the dark fruits. The taste is similar to the smell. Caramel and plum notes dominate the taste. The alcohol and oak make an appearance and compliment the stronger notes very well and end up creating a nice caramel taste in some places. Notes of vanilla from the barrel also appear. The beer is heavy bodied but very smooth to the point where it feels silky. Overall, a fantastic barleywine and one that I'll go looking for each year. 906 charactersHattedClassic, Mar 15, 2014
4.86/5  rDev +9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A: Dull, dark red in color. Looks nice but isn't amazing. Not like it matters that much though because this is one beast of an ale.
S: Wow. Chocolate, plums, figs, oak, some alcohol.
T: This thing tastes incredible. A lot of plums and figs with some chocolate, coconut and oak. The alcohol is covered up so unbelievably well, it's almost dangerous. Keep in mind the 2014 is 13.5%, not 12.5%.
M: Medium mouthfeel with pretty low carbonation. There is absolutely no sting or bite from the alcohol whatsoever.
O: I had my doubts that this beer would live up to the hype, but it definitely did and then some. If it weren't for the price and availability I would be drinking this every day. 689 charactersMisSigsFan, Mar 15, 2014

Overall : English Barleywine where ya been all my life?
My first English Barleywine won't be my last. What difference does it matter what I say it is a limited production run so if you get your hands on a bottle do yourself a favor.
Overall a great beer I would put this on par with some of the finest Scotch Whiskys. 
Very complex there is a whole lot going on in this bottle. 570 charactersBuannaich, Mar 08, 2014

Appearance: Nice amber dark brown, lovely. Little head, but I poured gently out of reverence. 
Smell: Absolutely wonderful. Raisin, plum cherry on chocolate. Brown sugar, and just a hint of alcohol on the back end. This is a very fragrant beer.
Taste&Mouthfeel:Wow this is like a liquid burnt caramel and brown sugar filled chocolate from Sees Candy! The liquid is thick, rich, full in body and mouth coating. Every crevice on my tongue screams with taste. Low carbonation, as there should be, is just enough. This is like a dark fruit molasses syrup and just tiny hints of chocolate nips. Not too sweet though, the alcohol from the strength of the beer greatly curbs any residual sugars that overwhelm the tongue. It's layered and complex, with great power in the mouth.
Overall: This could be poured over ice cream as a high end dessert it's so delicious! Probably one of the best beers I've even had. For me it's a little heavy, so not an every evening type of beer, but I feel very lucky I tried it, and cannot wait for the second one to age a few years. With the depth of what I tasted today, that will be one special bottle! 1,159 charactersToriBug13, Feb 23, 2014

This is far and away one of the best beers the world has seen - yes better than Westvleteren 12.
Get one of these - if you can - and impress your friends with a taste or two.
It pours a dark brown with a thin white head.
The smell is out of this world Carmel, Vanilla, Bourbon, and holy moly awesomeness.
Mouth feel is full, rich and thick.
Taste is incredible - like it smells but far more complex. I could drink this everyday and be happy...very happy - but drunk, and needing a liver transplant in short order as it is 13,5% alcohol content...but you'd never know it as it is well hidden.
One bottle of this to yourself and you have thoroughly enjoyed every second of it, you have a healthy buzz and you won't be up pissing 5 times that night like you would have been if you drank a case of Corona or Bud.
This is a beer for the ages.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Very familiar and a huge fan of FW, however, first time trying §ucaba. I've heard great things. Let's hope it lives up to the hype for $18.99/22oz.
A: Dark red, cherry like appearance. Slight lacing around the glass. It has the color of cherry coke syrup, just obviously not as thick. Look's like Bigfoot on crack.
S: Bourbon dominates in the beginning, followed by caramel, cinammon, fig, dark cherries, vanilla and some unidentifiable dark fruits.
T: Very bitter upfront with a slight malt flavor, then just explodes with everything the nose promises. A bit of toffee in there too that lingers nice on the palate.
M: Heavy. Good amount of carbonation. Bitterness is present throughout the entire sip and beyond.
O: By far the best Barrel-aged Barleywine I've ever had. Exceeded expectations. Cannot wait to try that other bottle next year to see how it has aged. Well forth the price. 996 charactersBoardwalkBock, Feb 21, 2014

A: About a finger of head. Deep, plum red. Golden yellow in the dimple, with some visible bubbles. Decent sheeting and lacing.
S: Big Bourbon-y molasses note up front, with a touch of earth and grass to it. The beer itself seems more malt driven; perhaps toasted cereal grain. A touch of fruity chocolate. Hint of some sort of bark, not quite cinnamon. Quite nice, overall.
T/MF: More of the molasses, with the grassy note being a little more forward. A touch of char. Big Bourbon caramel. Nice, light carbonation.
Original: Firestone's §ucaba 2014, a barrel-aged barley wine. 13.5% ABV.
A: Just the thinnest bit of head. Very deep red/brown. You can see some VERY fine, active bubbles in the dimple, which shows yellow, and very bright at the very bottom. Clear/faint yellow meniscus.
S: Dark caramel and bourbon, right off the bat! Bittersweet chocolate/cocoa cereal. Woody notes. I'm loving the smell. Raisin starting to come out, as it warms.
T/MF: Starts out really bitter, but then the flavors start to pop out. Char. Burnt caramel. Sweet toffee. Extra dark chocolate. Hints of date or fig. Backing sweetness lingers, alongside some char and caramel notes. Fairly decent carbonation for a stronger beer.
This is a beer that could put people off if they go with their immediate reaction, but it has some nice qualities if you stick around. I could imagine this being very good after a couple of years.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.
2016:
Firestone's Sucaba 2016, barrel-aged barleywine. 13.4% ABV.
A: A finger and a half of lightly tanned head. A very interesting and pretty dark-red/sienna, glowing more garnet towards the outsides. Very clear. Honeyed yellow in the dimple. Faint, but thick and sturdy sheeting, and decent lacing. Sheeting forms a ghost around lacing.
S: Deep, sweet barrel toffee. Slight red apple and cereal grain. Fig comes out as it warms.
T/MF: A lot of fig. A good amount of sweet char/graphite backing. A sharper spike sweetness if you hold it on the tip of the tongue. Dry, ashy toffee. Slight cereal grain at the end. Finish is a nice, soft barrel char.
Overall, much more subtle than a BBA stout, but has some great flavors.

Well - this certainly warrants a formal review. Abacus/Sucaba is an extremely high end barrel aged barleywine - possibly the best. I regard FW as the gold standard in barrel aging and it really shows in this one. Extremely sophisticated barrel presence - lots of oak, dark cherries, chocolate, stinging bourbon finish.

4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Was surprised to see this available at local restaurant. This was listed as 2012, reserve series no. 002. As it is a highly rated beer already, I had high expectations, although barley wines are hit or miss with me, as are bourbon aged beers.
This beer pours perfectly, dark brown with creamy white head that holds decently well, especially at the edges where it leaves nice lacing. The initial smell was strong on the bourbon, with some chocolate undertones. As the beer warmed, I lost a bunch of the nose, but what I did get was a more mellowed bourbon scent than the original sniff.
As usual, I can't wait for the beer to get to temp, so the initial tastes were a bit astringent and boozy. Once I forced some patience, I got a wonderful flavor profile similar to what the brewer's site indicates. I actually get a little more cherry feel to the overall taste, before the bourbon bite hits.
That said, the initial hit on the tongue is smooth and silky, to use an old cliche. The light mocha tones don't last long before a slightly more tart than bitter bite hits, yielding the cherry flavor I mentioned (also some licorice). The bourbon taste hits next, the tongue feels it throughout. The alcohol tinge lasts well into the aftertaste that is also marked by a dry woodiness presumably from the aging.
After trying to analyze, I sat back and just enjoyed the beer. When I did this, I noticed a light sweetness throughout the sip that helps hold the whole taste together. Overall it reminded me of a more tart version of BCBS. 1,530 characterscjgiant, Feb 15, 2014

After missing out on the 2014 §ucaba release at my go-to liquor stores, I consoled myself by breaking out the 2013 version from my cellar. §ucaba pours a deep ruby brown with a tan head that dissapates relatively quickly. The smell had notes of toffee, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. The taste was fantastic combination of sweet decadent caramelized malts and bourbon barrel notes. Burnt caramel, toffee, butterscotch, caramelized brown sugar, bourbon, charred oak, vanilla, coconut, dark sweet cherries, and subtle chocolate/coffee flavors. §ucaba has a pronounced barrel character that compliments the sweet malts beautifully without feeling too boozy. I thought the bourbon notes were quite smooth without the type of heat that you might expect from a 12.5% ABV barleywine. I think one year of aging may have been the perfect cellaring period. The mouthfeel was remarkably smooth, velvety, and drinkable for the ABV. This beer was truly a pleasure to drink. Firestone Walker has blown me away again once again with their bourbon barrel-aged releases. If I have to choose my favorite barleywine of all-time, it is a close call between §ucaba and Bourbon County Barleywine, but I think I would have to give a slight edge to §ucaba. Simply fantastic. 1,332 characterslmperialChad, Feb 13, 2014

Wow... Just wow. I am absolutely blown away by how this beer tastes. I went into this with certain expectations, all of them good, and it completely surpassed them on all accounts. This is all about huge flavor and perfect balance. The taste is a swirl of sweet dark fruits (Cherry, apple, fig) with vanilla, oak and bread, whisky and a touch of spiciness at the end. Whisky is everywhere in the nose and taste, but is only ever so slightly boozey in the mouth giving it a warmth that lingers. The texture is pretty much perfect silky smooth, with nice mild carbonation even after a year. Since these reviews encompass more than just taste, I have to nit pick. Smell was fantastic, but decidedly muted; I love a huge nose on huge beers. Lots of aged whisky, with lots of wood barrel presence, apples, toasted nuts. Finally, this is not a terribly appealing beer to lake at to me. It is a muddy reddish-brown, with hints of what wanted to be some head but could only muster a few lonely bubbles along the rim of the glass. It's dark and murky, and it simply isn't my favorite beer to look at. Like I said, nitpicking. Any inconsequential negative trait that I could try to pull out is simply dwarfed by the absolute perfection of the taste. 
Overall, this very well could be my new favorite barleywine with the only other possibility being Stickee Monkey, another from Firestone. I am absolutely giddy looking forward to trying the 2014 Sucaba release. 1,479 charactersSamuel906, Feb 11, 2014

13.5% ABV
Pours cola like, red-tinted dark brown with very little head that quickly disappears completely and leaves almost no lace. 
Smell is all over the place: bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon, toffee and faint cherry. Impressive. 
Taste is complex as well: bourbon, molasses, raisins, cherry and vanilla. At 13.5% ABV, this is definitely a sipping beer. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. 
Very complex and enjoyable aromas and flavors with unmistakable bourbon qualities. Sip slowly and enjoy. 538 charactersFurlinator, Feb 07, 2014

Pours lightly cloudy dark ruby brown color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big vanilla, molasses, toffee, caramel, raisin, toast, chocolate, coconut, oak, bourbon, tobacco, clove, and toast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of malt and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge molasses, vanilla, raisin, caramel, toffee, toast, coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon, tobacco, light clove, and toast/oak earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of molasses, vanilla, raisin, toast, caramel, toffee, coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon, tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Insane complexity of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a perfect malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with an very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely insane BA English Barelywine style. All around insane complexity and balance of malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the high ABV. Absolutely unbelievable stuff, Wow. 1,493 characterssuperspak, Jan 27, 2014

Taste: This beer is an above blend of mentioned aromas. A smile on my face will remain till the beer is gone. So tasty and delicious.

A: Dark copper. Excellent clarity. Half finger tan head. Rapid dissipation. Good lacing. Noticeable alcohol legs. 
S: Coconut, vanilla, oak, bourbon, marzipan, molasses, port, cherry. 
T: Sweet up front. Big molasses. Transitions to candied cherry, big hit of coconut. Vanilla oak, bourbon. Finishes very warm and fairly drying. 
M: Fairly light for the style. Carbonation mellows as it warms and it gains some body. However, the noticeable alcohol heft cuts the malt and this beer feels light for the style. 
O: It's amazing. Easily the best barleywine I've ever had. 586 charactersMcStagger, Jan 13, 2014

This is such an amazing beer. Firestone's barrell projects are getting better and better. You get so much from the barrel. Coconut, charcoal, bourbon, just amazing. Nice body of this beer, front of the mouth caramel and coconut, middle and back of the mouth lots of bourbon. A little boozy but this is a big beer!! I would have given this a 5 but I think with proper aging this beer will only get better. 445 characterspaulmarquez10, Jan 09, 2014

Muddy chestnut brown with rich haze. Lip of foam forms a consistent thick ring around the surface.
Caramel rich, bourbon complex, malt heavy, and dark fruit sweet. Decadent. Heavy caramel, gooey toffee, sweet honeyed bourbon, butterscotch, raisin, marshmallow, English maltiness, date sugars, cognac, and a toasty sugar finish. Mellowed and well-tempered. No boozy stiffness.
Super-rich. Delivering caramel and toffee English malt convolutions beneath a mellow flavor of quality bourbon and dried fruit. Dried date and raisin and hints of butterscotch, mallow, and a little maple. Awesome maltiness, and not entirely absent of an almost-blind pithy hop note. Surprisingly, it's not too heavy. The body is warm, wooly, and delightful. A very good mouthfeel.
Sucaba is excellent. I love this beer. 837 charactersthecheapies, Jan 04, 2014

22oz bottle to my FW Snifter glass naturally
*Notes taken from Christmas Day 12/25/13 
A: Sucaba pours a rusty chestnut brown color that is amazingly clear for a barrel aged barley-wine. Evident with bubbling carbonation and only a thin film of khaki head that dispels rather soon leaving behind a swirl and a few dots of lace in its wake. 
S: Smells of figgy nougat with candied plums, raisin bread, toasted malts, vanilla toffee, and a hit of solvent alcohol. I am getting some faint coffee in the nose as well a light vinous berry element. Nice intricacies coming from the malt and barrel aromatics but with a bit of stinging booze to it.
T: Caramel toffee and nougat with vanilla spice, alcohol, fig Newton/date bread, and just a hint of chocolate. There is a dark berry wine likeness to the beer and some earthy woods coming through as well. A moderate bitterness to the beer really helps to cut down the sweetness for sure. I am finding the barrel treatments to be pretty mellow however as the flavors interplay between the vinous wine like character and a scorched oaky vanilla quality. A lot going on here really. Very complex at times while somewhat muted at others. The alcohol is fairly intense. This one probably could use a bit more age on it in my opinion. In the end a rather tasty beast. 
M: Not chewy at all and in fact a bit on the thinner side. Mostly filling in weight however. Creamy and smooth feel with a moderate bitterness on the palate. Light drying towards the finish and some definite alcohol heat. Sticky residuals linger about an otherwise fairly clean finale. 
D: Definitely a good beer but not quite a favorite for me. English in style and almost too much going on to the point where flavors start to get a bit muddled. Mix in some untamed alcohol and we are falling short at times. I think I would prefer just a straight Bourbon Barrel approach here. Would like to revisit an older vintage possibly. 1,966 charactersNugganooch, Jan 04, 2014

2013 Vintage. 
A: Pours a murky, deep mahogany. Some ruby highlights, but reads as super dark, opaque brown. Cloudy, nearly zero light penetration. Thin and quickly fleeting marshmallow head. Fairly sticky lacing remains. 
S: HUGE dose of bourbon. Picked it up at arms length with the pour. Rich, bourbon, oak, sweet toffee aromas. Loads of vanilla but surprisingly some cocoa mixed in. Great set up here. 
T: Smacks in with sweet, boozy fruit. Almost like a moist bite of a vanilla/cinnamon bread pudding with bourbon soaked cherries. Some of the oak tannin from the barrel cut the sweetness to a slight degree. Flavors are layered really nicely. Just a great blend of winter's night flavors. Not a more typical wave of this vs. that followed by a wallop of the other thing. Just a smooth, complex monster of the a beer. 
M: Low carbonation. Nice, easy drink for such a strong and sweet beer. Full bodied, but not syrupy. Well done. 
O: Just fabulous. Such a nice mix of flavors. Been holding out of this one for a while and have a 2012 in reserve. Sets a tremendous bar. Great, great beer. 1,135 charactersBraseltonage, Jan 01, 2014
4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On-tap at Boulders on Broadway in Tempe, AZ.
A: Deep brown, thick liquid. No head, no lace, no retention. Looks like port or any other dessert wine. Big legs on the glass.
S: Leathery molasses. Chocolate covered cherries. Booze becomes stronger as the beer warms.
T: Malty, syrupy, sugary goodness. Molasses, caramelized sugar, brown sugar, dark chocolate. Booze soaked fruits. Heavy malt, heavy sugar, heavy booze. But the alcohol doesn't take anything away from the beer. There is a lot going on. Very complex. The amount of layers reminds of the their 15th Anniv.
M: Mild carbonation but smooth as can be. Malty and boozy. Viscous.
O: Gotta be the epitome of the style. This is the bar for English barleywines. When you read about the style, this hits every mark and exceeds it. Fantastic beer.
Update: had to bump up this score! Snagged a bottle of the 2012 and sat on it for a while. (still have a 2013 in the "cellar") Wish it had a bottling date. Don't even remember when I picked this up. Maybe the fall or winter of 2012?
Beautiful liquid...deep brown with red and amber hues. Burnt sienna for the last few sips as the glass empties. A very light brown head that bubbles up quickly and fizzy while also fading quickly. Nice lacing and a ring of head retention throughout. Serious aromas of vinegar, booze, bourbon, wood, and even a bit of funk and sour as it warms up. Flavor is a bit more subdued, with flavors of heavily roasted and charred malt, delicious booze, vanilla, caramelized and brown sugar, molasses with alcohol, and sweet, dark fruits. Wow. So complex. Mellowed out from what I remember but not as much as I expected. Either it needs more time or it's just a big beer that will always be in-your-face. Which I like. Since the barrels and bourbon were such an emphasis, they should always stand out. Which they do. Heavy on the buttery, earthy bourbon as well as the wood, malt, and booze. A huge beer for serious beer drinkers. Not for the faint of heart, as shown with my brother who I gave a small glass of this to sample and it was too much for him. A fantastic sipper with massive flavor and drinkability. If I had the entire bottle, though, this NYE wouldn't be much to remember. I'm excited to try the 2013!
2013 bottle drunk on 2/21/14. Bottled on 1/10/2013. Amazing stuff. Lots of delicious bourbon character while retaining all the great qualities of an English BW. 2,406 charactersGatch, Dec 31, 2013

Beautifyul clear mahogany pour with an off-white two finger head with decent retention and great lacing. Boozy, woody nose with hints of dark fruit, butterscotch, oak, vanilla, caramel, and subtle bourbon. The taste is also dominated by booze and wood along with hints of toffee, dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, oak, butterscotch, maple, bourbon, and some subtle chocolate. The mouthfeel is initially a bit on the hot and boozy side, but as it warmed it became quite smooth and creamy. Overall, this is another world class offering from Firestone Walker. I have a couple in the cellar and can't wait to try them. 654 charactersbeerdrifter, Dec 31, 2013

S clear maroon ruby when held to the light, two fingers of foam fizzes out in no time leaving no lace, just a few visible bubbles popping up here and there
S dried fruit, nutty toffee, vanilla, lots of wood and I'm not sure what barrel they use but I could see port, bourbon, and rum making sense, there's a little booze but what I'd expect from 8% not 12.5%, some herbal hops, plum, apple pie filling, and some coco powder, smells wonderful 
T brown sugar, raisins, dried cherry, still plenty of wood, the faintest hint of smoke, loads of toffee and vanilla, long story short it mimics the smell and that's a good thing 
M thick and creamy, some heat but again I'd never guess 12.5%, some herbal notes and barrel lingers strong
O the hypes for real with this one, super complex and this fresh bottle drinks like its aged, the booze pops up here and there but all things considered the liquors very well concealed 
I'd seek this one out and after trying a fresh bottle I really want a couple to age, plenty going on and I'm going to sleep well tonight 1,150 characterswordemupg, Dec 19, 2013

8oz pour split between 2
Just starting to get into barley wines and why not start with BCBW and Sucuba
A - Pours a deep dark color with partially see through dark brown purple edges around the glass. Poured on tap with a minimal to medium light tan head
S - chocolate, coffee, toffee, vanilla, dark fruits, decent amount of barrel presence smell
T - This was poured too cold so started sipping lightly until it warmed and wow did the flavors ever come out when it warmed. Starts like a stout with the heavy flavoring of vanilla, chocolate, maple, and as it warmed there was an eruption of fruit flavors that went down my throat that was quite delightful and boded well with the initial tastes. This was my one of my first BW's and man am I impressed.
M - Mouthfeel is slightly more carbonated than most of the stouts we had. Medium bodied with a smooth mouthfeel really a treat.
O - I loved this style of barley wine it nearly resembles a world class stat except for the finish of these beers. I loved the dark fruits really erupting as it warmed and went down the back of my throat. World - Class Glad I was able to snag a bottle of this on Black Friday 1,225 charactersdrmcleod10, Dec 17, 2013

A- Pours a deep deep garnet with a good degree of clarity considering the deep color. With an aggressive pour a surprisingly high light tan head forms and dissipates rather slowly to a thin film. Looks to be of a high viscosity.
S- Medium level of barrel character in this one. Vanilla, coconut, dark dried fruits, alcohol, then oak. 
T- The ABV is very present in this beer. Getting more of the vanilla, coconut, oak, and some tannin. Also getting some hops in here which I wasn't expecting but this must be more of a West Coast barleywine along the lines of Bigfoot as opposed to Third Coast Old Ale. Bitterness on the tongue as it leaves the mouth. 
M- Nice heavy mouthfeel but not too heavy. Surprisingly high carb for a strong barleywine.
O- A great beer but I have to say the big alcohol presence was a bit of a turn off and unexpected. I was assuming I'd get something a bit smoother. Had this a few days after having Goose Island's BCBW and that was one of the best beers I've ever and may ever have. And this kind of paled in comparison to be honest. And BCBW is 12.1% and Sucaba is 12.5% but the alcohol prescence would lead me to believe it is more like 15% and a could barely detect the ABV in BCBW. Also the bourbon barrel presence is there but at a medium level compared to other big BA beers I've had. Barelywines and Old Ales along with Scotch Ales are my favorite beer styles and hope to see more barrel aged ones. 1,536 charactersPaulyB83, Dec 04, 2013

a: Clear dark ruby, tall offwhite head receded to even surface foam and dense lacing.
s; Ripe dark fruit.
t: Ripe dark fruit under smoke. Smoky ash taste lingers at first, later gives way to the ripe fruit. High ABV seems well covered, even to minimal initial throat burn, although that does build somewhat later. 
m: Medium and very smooth.

4.73/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a large snifter after about 20 minutes out of the ice bucket. Deep reddish brown with a fair amount of tan, creamy head. Good lacing, and the collar was thick at the edge of the glass. Aroma of toffee, caramel, some woody earthiness, sweet medium roasted malt too. Taste is of toffee/caramel, leather, woody-earthy, very lightly smokey (perhaps because of the campfire). So damn good. Mouthfeel is all that barleywines should be. Appropriately carbonated, medium creamy body. I could drink this til the cows come home; too bad I have to trade for it. 562 charactersmverity, Nov 18, 2013

Pours a medium-dark brown body with a beige head of small and medium bubbles, good retention with eventual rimming, not too much lacing.
Smell is heavy on toffee, caramelized malts, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, basically akin to the inside of a bourbon barrel.
Taste is very mellow. Soft toffee and caramel malt flavors are present first, with some vanilla and bourbon notes waving in but far from dominant. Nice smoothness and barrel character is present. Low bitterness. Lingering taste of bourbon on the finish not low alcohol burn.
Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and delicate. Heavy body, moderate carbonation. Finish is clean, not too sticky or dry.
Overall, there's a reason this is the standard by which barleywine is held to. Just a fantastic sipper that is warming and delicious. 852 charactersMCain04, Nov 15, 2013
4.9/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752012 bottle poured into my Founders snifter.
A- Pours a deep, deep, murky brown in color. Haze is dense, and combined with the color, it looks almost like some mud in the glass (but in a good way). Small, .5 finger head that retains well for its size and laces only a little.
S- Sweet toffee, caramel, and vanilla right off the bat. Some spicy barrel notes and medium to dark malts mixes in. Bourbon and barrel spice give it a nice layer of complexity. Just a hint of brown sugar sweetness also in there. Incredibly complex and enticing.
T- Spicy, sweet, malty, bitter, and a little warming. Just as complex as the scent. Starts with more barrel flavors forward, most prominently spicy char and vanilla. Moves toward caramel malts and toffee flavors in the middle before moving towards some balancing bitterness. Slight detection of hops towards the end and also some warming and biting alcohol flavors. Slight bitterness and malt flavors linger on the tongue.
M- Thick and smooth with medium carbonation. Rather easy to drink for the intense flavors and complexity, as well as the alcohol level. Warming a little as it goes down.
Overall, another incredibly complex and awesome beer from Firestone Walker. I had both this and Parabola with about a year of age on them, and I'm not sure they could get better. Mellow and smooth, yet bold and distinctive; Firestone Walker just gets barrel aging beer. 1,405 charactersboilermakerbrew, Nov 15, 2013

Sweet, port wine smell. Oak, dark dried fruit, caramel, bourbon.
Initially silky. Followed by a slight sting of carbonation with dried plums, & dark cherry (almost medicinal) that lingers on the palate while the alcohol warms your throat & belly. You might even taste merlot & a hint of vanilla.
If my review was based on grades, the appearance would be the valedictorian, the smell the salutatorian, and the taste would be a graduate. 613 charactersbcerv-ca, Nov 03, 2013

Smell is incredible. All caramel candy (Werther's) and barrel. Smells sweet. Taste is out of this world. Has always been my favorite BA barleywine, and it still is. Lots of barrel, malty sweetness, caramel, vanilla. I get a hint of smoke on the back end. A very slight bitterness as well. However, the dominant flavors are sweet caramel and bourbon. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Overall, amazing beer that appears to get better with age. 541 charactersBeersnake1, Oct 21, 2013

The beer pours a ruddy ruby red. The murky beer offers no head and only a faint whisper of a mocha colored ring at the edges. The scent is very complex and intriguing. Notes of toffee, prunes, a touch of sherry (pleasantly so), and generally malt driven with a slight touch of alcohol presence. Hints of wood come through with the scent of vanilla and tropical fruit. 
The beer has a curious and medium bodied mouthfeel. It begin with a good amount of carbonation, but finishes with a slick almost oily feel. The oily feel is very brief and unfavorable, but I'm really only nitpicking here. Just something I have not experienced before. The taste begins with a warming impression of strong malt flavor that fades to the dark fruit that was strong in the nose consisting of prunes and raisins. Just a hint of vanilla on the finish with a slight reemergence of the alcohol. Very consistent to the English barley wine style with then barrel aging providing layers of complexity. Very good beer and wonderfully done blending and using the various barrels. 1,066 charactersJmamay22, Oct 16, 2013

4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.252013 vintage drunk 8 months old at room temp in a tulip.
A - 4.5 - Beautiful crystal clear ruby brown when held up to light. Away from the light it looks like root beer and you can't see through it. Beautiful, rich, even, creamy, thick, light tan head.
S - 4.25 - Malty like wet Raisin Bran cereal (both for the bran flakes and the raisins), and sweet like when I used to drizzle honey over my Raisin Bran. Those flavors are potent and saturated, with a lesser hint of booze and a slighter hint of mystery fruit. 
T - 4.5 - Sherry, and lots of it. Malty with a fruit tinge. A hybrid of honey and caramel sweetness initially, which later in the bottle accumulates and concentrates into a Raisinets malty/raisiny/chocolate-ness. A decent bitterness is left behind on the palate to remember it by, which is at least in part a bitterness like oxidized apple peels.
M - 4.25 - Creamy, smooth, soft, and barely viscous. Short of medium bodied surprisingly. Leaves a faint sting on the tongue, which turns into mild hop abrasion.
O - 4.25 - It's good. Given its reputation, I had for some reason expected a bolder complexity in terms of layering. But like some other English-style barleywines I've had, and like a lot of English and English-style beers in general, its subtlety makes its complexity something you have to work for, in this case at least beyond the sherry notes, which are themselves pretty bold and nice to have. There in the center is a mildness where I want something more. Style considerations aside, if I could magically alter it for the better, I'd put a puff of spice in it for that extra sense of layering and altitude, give it a buttery viscosity to play against the bitter/dry ending, and add something unmistakeably earthy to give it some additional depth and counterpoint to the sweet elements. Take me down low. It's still a very nice beer and well made. The potency of the alcohol in it leaves you dreamy warm and relaxed. To me it's an ideal slow, no-hurry, contemplative sipper for when the weather cools. Great brewery. 2,049 charactersBrownNut, Oct 07, 2013

Aroma- rich dark fruits, caramel, walnuts, vanilla, maybe a touch of oak
Taste- rich oak and warm dark fruits, some prickly hops fighting to push through, lots of rich, fine chewy caramel. Finishes with toasty vanilla and citrusy hops, more caramel 
Feel- so smooth, barely any booze there. I'm surprised how light bodied this, almost too drinkable
A fantastic beer. No doubt one of the best barleywines. I may be a little more partial to Old Numbskull (barrel aged), but this is great

A- Looks like a more watered down caramel. Very little head on the pour with good retention. Thin lacing. 
S- Caramel, thick malt backbone. Caramel is huge in the nose. Some belgian dark fruit action going on too. 
T- Very nice malt backbone with huge caramel as well. somewhat charred dark fruit. 
M- Very smooth, and on tap prob gives more carb than usual.

Not at all like the toffee fruit cake English barleywine I was expecting, this is one of those phenomenally complex beers one can pull flavors from all night. I smell chocolate biscotti, chocolate covered espresso beans, bourbon, black cherries and red grapes scraped across an oak barrel. Tastes like molasses cookies, bourbon and a port-like dark fruit. Chocolate syrup. Still warm after 6 months in the cellar.
A beer worthy of its high ratings. 595 charactersdonkeyrunner, Aug 22, 2013

3.88/5  rDev -13%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Poured 2012 into snifter glass. The beer presented a dark red ("Ruby" as said on the bottle) in color. Very short head was present, not much lacings around the glass. 
The beer smelled boozy - definitely a bourbon forward aroma. This is my first barrel-aged barley wine so I cannot say this is what I expected. But at 12.5%, it doesn't surprise me. There was also a faint aroma of chocolate raspberries and some other dark fruit. 
Taste wise it's a complex beer and that made it rather difficult to pick out the flavors of this barley wine. Very very sweet (almost cloying), maybe some smokiness, and some dark fruits. It did start out boozy while chilled but as it warmed up, the booziness became even more present exponentially. The bourbon flavor is a plus for this one. Its there and if you love bourbon, you should like this one. 
It had a medium to heavy bodied mouthfeel. The alcohol just sits in your mouth like it's a love seat. 
Unfortunately I cannot say I'm all the way impressed with this beer. So much malt, a lot of booze, and the complexity seems to go beyond what I can handle. Like I said, this was my first barrel-aged barley wine and it certainly is different than a non-barrel-aged barley wine. I would probably have to give it some time to 'understand' and appreciate the characteristics of a barrel-aged barley wine. I have to give this beer credit for the awesome aroma. This probably had the easiest characteristics that I could pick out verses the flavor. 
It would be nice to try a 2013. Maybe I would have different feelings about this without the age being a possible factor. 1,608 charactersBenish, Jul 24, 2013

A - pours a deep brown mahogany. Almost completely opaque. Nearly two fingers worth of tan foam.
S - the aroma is rife with caramel in all its Gooey and sticky glory. Barrel notes are prominent as well. Notes of splinters and vanilla. Classic dark fruit character of raisins, dates and figs. Hints of whole grain bread. Slight nutty character.
T - doughy and slightly sweet caramel malt flavors coat the tongue. Big flavors of wood and vanilla in the centet. Delicately sweet fruit flavors enter as well with notes of cherries, raisins, and dates. Some peppery spice notes of alcohol throughout especially the backend and finish which also exhibits notes of caramel and dried fruit.
M - fuller side of medium bodied. Slick texture. Medium carbonation.
O - excellent barrel aged ale. One of my favorites. Went perfectly with some english stilton. 861 charactersTeleweizen2, Jul 24, 2013

Starting out, I get sweet caramel and toffee, a little bit of bourbon and oak, vanilla. A bit of coconut too. Mostly a sweet smelling beer. Smells good. Thebeer pours a dark brown, but it is lighter coloured than King Henry. Pours with a 0.5cm off-white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Looks like a heavy beer.
On the palate, I get coconut, vanilla, caramel and toffee. This is a sweet barleywine. Very different from King Henry in that it is sweeter and milder on the palate despite being a big beer. Very tasty on its own.
This beer is bit on the thin side compared to King Henry. Probably a medium bodied beer that has absolutely no indication of booze in it. It's a very good beer that comes down very smoothly. Aftertaste is a bit of sweet toffee and oak.
Deliciously sweet English barleywine that shows off the barrel pretty well. Very tasty and if you like barleywines but haven't had this one, I have no idea why you wouldn't- go out and get some to drink. Its not the best barleywine (King Henry has that title) but it is very good.
-Update: drank a 2012 Sucaba a few days later. The barrel notes a bit more muted and the beer is just as sweet as the 2013. The booziness seems more noticeable in the 2012. I would recommend drinking this beer fresh. 1,438 charactersStevedore, Jul 22, 2013

Mostly clear dark maple syrup amber. Garnet edges. Plump finger of light peanut shell brown. Great lacing and retention. Rich, deep aromas of brown sugar, coconut, rummy fruits, tobacco, figs, vanilla, molasses, and oak. Heady with definite traces of warming alcohol, but everything seems to fit together perfectly. I just want to keep huffing this.
Toasted malt and toasted coconut up front. Caramel and rummy fruit melange follow. Hints of brown sugar and toffee in the mix. Nice sweetness level--not too cloying. Toasted coconut picks up toward the finish. Vanilla and woody oak notes intensify as well. More figgy fruit and toffee in the finish, along with plenty of soothing, warming alcohol. Smooth and not too hot. Full-bodied, creamy feel. A beautifully put together beer. Too drinkable for its strength. Well done. 877 charactersalexgash, Jul 21, 2013

A - Dark reddish brown with a small off white head.

I have been searching for this beer for forever and am so happy I finally get to try it. Thanks to 'whiskey' for the trade hook up.
The aroma on this beer is ridiculous. Reminds me a little of BCBS in how the bourbon is prevalent, but doesn't steal the show. It definitely helps hold the other nuances of dark fruit, chocolate, toffee and caramel up nice and tall. An expert touch.
Flavor is along the same lines. The time spent in the barrels definitely helped smooth this monster out and has made it less cloyingly sweet. Dangerously drinkable for a 12.5% ABV barley wine. Vanilla, oak, dark cherries, caramel and toasty malt all coincide gracefully in the glass with a nice mouthfilling effect on your palate. Long finish leaves you tasting it for minutes and all the while pining for just one more sip.
What an epic 300th review and another personal whale slain.

Freshness: 2013 Vintage
Packaging: 22 oz. brown bottle, pry-cap with foil
Glassware: Snifter
Purchased: Received in a trade
Appearance is a murky, dark brown beer. The head is nicely sized, off-white in color, and shows a good amount of lacing and fair retention.
The smells are big and bold, with an alcohol sweetness like in a holiday cake drenched in whiskey. Aromas include oak woodiness, sweet caramel malts, figs, molasses, spices and tobacco. 
The taste follows the nose, with an extremely rich palate of bourbon whiskey and sweet malts. Other flavors remind me of brown sugar, molasses, maple and vanilla. There's an earthy hop character as well, but I don't really taste any bitterness, even though the FW website lists the beer as having 42 IBUs.
Mouthfeel is full in body with a moderate carbonation level. The finish is rich, sweet and malty, with aftertastes of wood and whiskey.
Overall a real gem. A slow sipping beer due to the intensity of flavors and alcohol. My only quibble would be that it may be a touch too sweet. Recommended!
Thanks to my cousin Brian for this one! 1,117 characterssommersb, Jul 07, 2013

2013 Vintage poured into a snifter
A- Pours incredibly dark amber colored. Surprisingly clear. A one finger off tan eggshell color. Little retention. Some alcohol legs..
S- A caramel sweet smelling beer. A big breaddy malt profile. A nice oak, and char on the nose. A touch of bourbon and a hint of dark fruit. A sweet and syrupy smell.
T- A nice big bourbon up front. An intense sour mash flavor. Followed up by a nice charred oak character. A lingering woody taste. Bourbon dominates the tongue but you wont hear me complaining. A slight hint of cocoa and chocolate in this one. Maybe a chocolate covered cherry. Some fig and a touch of raisin in this beer. A breaddy sweet malt backbone, a touch of caramel and nice bit of toffee. Some roasted nut perhaps, and earthy flavor. Not what I was expecting but very very good stuff here.
M- Good carbonation, a well balanced beer. I would like a touch more body out of something this size however. 
O- An epic beer. Really emphasizes on the bourbon barrels. The beer itself provides a very nice base for the barrel program. Wish I could get this one in my area. 1,125 charactersTwelveOunces, Jul 06, 2013

2011 Vintage
Been waiting awhile to open this, in retrospect looks like I should have opened it sooner.
Pours an orangish brown in the glass with a decent off-white head.
Smell is pretty decent, some sweet caramel malts, a touch of bourbon. Not overly enticing though.
Taste is not quite right. Some sweetness, some oak, almost no bourbon. A weird bit of heat on the back end. 
Mouthfeel is meh.
Overall, this tastes old. Did not age well in my basement. Oh well, I'll have to look for a fresher version of this to really give it a fair shake.
**Edit - Finally got to try a fresh bottle to see how this should taste. The short answer is: much better. Nice bourbon flavor, good sweetness from the malt. Fairly smooth, just a touch of heat. My only complaint is that this gets a bit one-dimensional about halfway through the bomber. A very nice BBBW, well done FW. 901 charactersthebigredone, Jul 01, 2013

4.91/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752013 vintage. Had the pleasure of drinking a couple of 2011's and a couple of 2013's prior to this. Enough to know it's one of the most sublime beers to pass my lips.
Appearance: quite dark, hazy bronze. Some deep ruby highlights. Impressive head on the pour that mostly subsides. A thick swath of big bubbles lingers around the ring. 
Smell: that's the stuff. First sniff is simply...amazing, damn fine nose. after pondering...Vanilla, oak, bourbon, caramel, even a touch of fruitiness. 
Taste: technically I guess you can't do better than a 5, but the taste is even better than the nose, by a nose. 
Overall: just an outstanding, fine work of art. Thank you FW. 663 characterscindyjeffsmith, Jun 15, 2013

4.06/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This isn’t as good as I remember it being last year. It’s almost as if I can taste the fact that this was more readily available, and the stank of semi-rareness repulses me. Why–this could have been purchased sight unseen by any ol’ rube on the west coast. His grimey, Bud-covered maws probably touched the bottle–my bottle–and got it all dirtied.
Also, thanks guys for making a beer with an unpronounceable name. That’s a really hip and clever way to encourage people to discuss your product. Like, “hey guys, have you had that one beer with the name you can’t pronounce because its nonexistent first letter looks like it was drawn on a Spirograph?” And your friends are like “oh yeah, skucaba, or whateer. Wow, I love not being to pronounce it’s name. That makes up for the fact that dirty poor people can afford it!” (In case you can’t tell, I’m being super sarcastic right now!)
Uhh, anyhow, it's PG-13 (which stands for "Pretty Good," but not good enough to let you say "fuck" or see titties). Wood nodes are less oak and more just a vague sense of mellowness. Hops are dulled. Overall it comes across like a very nice, but very weak bourbon.

Pours an extremely dark blood red color with a small, appropriate head that quickly dissipates. Very nice appearance. Smell is of scotch and dark fruits. The smell isn't overwhelming and is quite pleasant. the first flavor you get when you sip this is of whiskey, followed by dark fruits, caramel, toffee and a plethora of others. It's so complex. Each sip you can detect new and distinct flavors. Obviously the alcohol is strong and apparent, but not as strong as in some other beers of this style. It's got just the right amount of whiskey flavor for me. Feel is excellent as well. Heavy bodied with low carbonation, but you just want to take sip after sip of this, despite the high ABV. 
Overall Firestone Walker is quickly becoming a favorite of mine and this beer is no exception to that trend. Overrated? Ehhh perhaps, you'll have to be the judge of that, but I'd still rank this brew close to world class in status. 973 charactersAxnjxn, Jun 08, 2013

Small brownish yellow head that recedes quickly. Aroma of huge vanilla and caramelly biscuits, sweet brown sugar, molasses, and bourbon. Awesome! Flavor is caramel vanilla up front, bready malts, molasses, more vanilla and a bit of licorice, and ending with hot bourbon notes. Lingering dry oak and bourbon on the palate. Finishes surprisingly smooth and easy. A great balance of sweet and oakiness. Plenty of rich hearty body to handle the barrels. Low to medium carbonation. A sipper and oh so yum.
Trying a relatively fresh 2014 bottle on 6/9/14 courtesy of Doug. Amazing lasting vanilla finish on this with more dark fruit than I remember from the last time, less caramel and more bready toffee. Still as yummy as before. Mmmm. 840 charactersBMMillsy, Jun 05, 2013

I don't recall the aroma, but I'd love to have it again and investigate further. Flavor tastes of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, mild milk chocolate, and booze. Without messing around, let's just say this is probably one of the ten best beers I've ever had. It's luxurious, balanced, complex, and way more drinkable than a 13% ABV beer has any right to be. It was outstanding from the first sip to the last, and only prudence prevented me from having a second glass. I can find no fault with it. 555 charactersMaximalC, Jun 01, 2013

Served in a snifter
A - Pours a dark brown/mahogany color with red highlights. 1 finger of off-white head forms a thin collection of wispy patterned bubbles below a solid collar.
S - Sweet whiskey, vanilla, buttery cotton candy, toasted coconut, caramel and toffee, sugar coated nuts roasted, amaretto, scorched oak wood and cherries, strawberry and rhubarb preserve.
T - A swirl of roasted wood, sweet vanilla, dense toffee, sticky caramel, toasted fruit bread, leather, spicy hops, whiskey swirls around notes of chocolate cherry cordial, amaretto, and rum. The whiskey components grow stronger as it warms, making the finish drier and drier. Some spiciness shows up toward the warming finish.
M - Starts out firm and full but turns medium and softens out, low and fine carbonation.
One of the best aromas I've ever smelled from a beer. Complexity is an over-used word but this is complex. The transitions of aroma, taste, and feel over the course of the bottle are incredible. Full barrel flavors the meld beautifully. Don't know how this could get any better with age. 1,101 charactersStaveHooks, May 28, 2013

I definitely get red wine, charcoal, bourbon, rye malt, caramel, and alcohol. the different barrel blends really come out in the nose and the taste, giving a lot of layers to this monster. the flavor features some vanilla and some toffee, brown sugar, but its not too sweet, and some dried fruits in the date or fig range. again, the complexity is stunning. furthermore, the alcohol content of this beer in not caustic or hot like I expected it to be. its in fact quite tame, just warming, appropriate. this is also oddly drinkable for its magnitude. its soft in feel, but very well carbonated, and the body is full but not filling per se. I cant say enough about this one, everything is dialed in, and its a beer only firestone walker could pull off. its got their signature all over it. I was hesitant and skeptical to see a barleywine so high in the BA rankings, but this makes perfect sense now that ive had it. I will look forward to my next bottle with great enthusiasm! a must try. this is pretty much the end all and be all of the style for me. 1,489 charactersStonedTrippin, May 27, 2013

Pours a dark amber approaching brownish, decent light tan head but fizzes away surprisingly quick, no cap on top and not much lacing either.
Smell has a nice caramel malt backbone, lots of dark fruit hitting the nose, definitely a touch of vanilla to sweeten it up before the boozy barrel aged aroma creeps in.
Taste has a very malt mixed with dark fruity raisin-y flavor going on, sweetness in the aftertaste but nothing too cloying, body is nice and full, carbonation is soft but active which lends a hand with the full body, the boozy alcohol burn is present but surprisingly is really only hits the back of the throat and not so much in the mouth which is nice, a very nice sipper indeed. 708 charactersdeltatauhobbit, May 26, 2013

A-Pours a lovely ruby brown, low to moderate carbonation leaves a thin tan ring and a small pool of tan head in the middle of the glass.
S-Some nice boozy head overwhelms the nose with some dark figgy fruit underneath. A hint of marshmallow.
T-A perfect barleywine. Sweet and rich, moderate booziness and a nice hop underbite. Sweet raisins, marshmallow, alcohol. Terrific.
M-Medium bodied, rich but not wearying on the palate. Right on.
O-Outstanding, even better with a bit of age.

A: Pours a deep ruby red with a finger's worth of cream colored head that fades to a nice halo along the edges of the glass. Nothing groundbreaking, but a good start.
S: A lot going on with the nose. The barrel makes its presence known for sure with big hints (oxymoron?) of vanilla, toasted coconut, and caramel. A lot of sweetness, which makes sense given the style of the brew and the daunting ABV.
T: Wow. This is an amazing, and a big, beer. The bourbon that I picked up is a bit more subdued on the palate, but is still definitely there. Much of the same sweetness with a lot of vanilla and some more raisin coming through. I'm excited to see how this develops as it warms up.
M: There's no way this is 12.5%! Incredibly smooth and velvety on the tongue, the flavors last incredibly long and make me yearn for another sip. I think I'll have to indulge...
O: There's a reason this has such a strong reputation. It has the impressive ability to meld together a smooth drinkability with an amazingly complex taste, and is truly a unique drinking experience. I have a 2011 bottle sitting around too...I'll have to see how that's drinking soon. 1,245 charactersAndrew61923, May 24, 2013

The aroma is a nutty with sweet vanilla, mellow coconut. It has a familiar aroma to BCBS with its oak and vanilla. The sweetness is quite obvious with dark sugary malt with a heavy malt backbone.
The beer hits you with a sweet caramel and maple syrup flavor. Then the pop of fresh vanilla pods smack you and grows all over the mouth. There is a coconut, dark brown sugar. It keeps exploding and changing in flavors with every sip. The end has a big booze and smokey bourbon flavor. The beer is almost like sweet vanilla malty extract. 
The body is medium/heavy with low carbonation. A surprising thing about this beer is the easy finish without a cloying sweetness.
The booziness eventually gets quite obvious and in your face. However, the complexity and flavor is almost unmatchable for any beer style. I generally would prefer hops in a barleywine, but this is world class.
However, having this aged from 2012 on tap at Brouwerij Lane, I prefer this fresh. With age, the booze mellows, but as does the big bold flavors. It becomes less complex and bold. Not that it is not still amazing, but I just prefer the wide range of flavors that the fresh one has. 1,197 charactersdar482, May 19, 2013

4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- Pours up a good amount of head. The foam is a very light tan/ mocha color that produces big bubbles quickly. A good amount of lacing is left on the first pour. The body is a dark chestnut brown with hints of maroon. It glows ruby at the bottom when held up to the light. Very pretty beer. 
Nose- The smell alone is delicious. Coconut is the first thing I get but there's so much more than that. Caramel, vanilla, oak, and tobacco. The coconut is the strongest and if the note is any indication of the palate, I am going to love this beer. Toffee notes with butterscotch and honey. Roasted and nutty notes as well. So much going on here. One of the best aromas I've ever experienced. 
Taste- Caramel starts the palate off as it moves into vanilla, oak, coconut, tobacco, and smoke. Chocolate- a very dark chocolate ends this up with cherry notes. This is an amazing beer. The heat is very low key which makes this a very dangerous beer (it does creep up on you a little bit in the end). Some peat notes, also bourbon. I think 3 months has served this beer well. It isn't messy at all but still retains lots of complexity as you can tell from the description. Oakiness starts to present itself more and more but not in an overpowering way like Oak Aged Yeti or Vanilla Oatis. 
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied but thinner than I expected. A little zip on it. This is probably the only (slightly) negative aspect of this beer. 
Drinkability- For 12.5 %, this goes down very easy. The flavor profile makes it dangerous. Plus it's a bargain at 15 bucks (I think I'm going to have to pick up another bottle). I would pay that much for a bottle of wine and this is better than any wine I've ever had.
Overall- Solid A with inclinations toward A+. This is a must try and a steal at the price. I will not hesitate to pick 2 or 3 or however many I can afford next year. 1,868 charactersartoolemomo, May 19, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5§ucaba, we meet at last... I have dreamt of this beer for eons, and indeed, finally tasting it has been a journey well waited. Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz bottle. 2013 vintage. No bottling date, but I know this was released in February.
Pours a deep, almost purple ruby, near opaque appearance when set close to the light, and a dark, ruby-red cloudy appearance when held against the light. The initial head on this thing was marvelous, rising completely in the tulip and lasting a good 10-15 minutes before settling down. A ring aggressively persists at the top, which is great given the high ABV. Extremely viscous - maybe the most viscous barleywine I've seen to date, and that's saying a lot. Lacing coats the glass in large droplets, which is astonishing. Bubbles and slight sediment abound inside this, give this a lively, jubilant appearance in midst of the intimidating, thickened look. A work of art.
At the aroma, you get whacked in the face immediately with sweetened, stinging booze, only to follow with a variety of complex and diverse flavors. Juicy brandy notes, vanilla from the bourbon, a touch of American oak, raisins, vinous, caramelized grapes, a buttery, woody finish, and a persistant sweetness that appears to last a good long while. There's an elevated hoppy profile here, to my surprise, often feeling floral, but the sweetened, syrupy malts are the stars here, only separating themselves from the high booze and woody, bourbon/brandy combo. Not necessarily my favorite thing to sniff on (very astringent and harsh at times), but still exquisite.
However, upon taking my first sip, I'm pretty sure my heart skipped a beat. This is absolutely delicious. At first, you get an initial touch of the brandy/bourbon flavors, coated with dried figs, plums, raisins, vanilla, honey, maybe a touch of coconut, combined with well integrated tannins from the oak. Then, as soon as the initial touch of sweetness and fruity complexity passes, you get a stinging yet exciting boozy sensation, combined with syrupy, toasty malts, a little bit of citrus and grassiness, and then a finish that is enormously buttery, thick, and silky - almost to the point where this feels like it's melting right in your mouth. It could be liked to a blood orange cream sorbet, but it's far more complex than that. Simply put, the vanilla, and brandy and bourbon combo combined with the syrupy toasted malts and fruity, resinous profile is unlike anything I've had before. No alcohol burn to speak of. Sticky, dry, slightly astringent, but definitely full bodied. Absolutely hedonistic and decadent to the highest degree. It's a sipper, no doubt, but it all goes down like a charm no matter how much it warms up.
Wow!! I knew people were head over heels in love with this thing, but now after having it I see why. This transcends the barleywine style as we know it, integrating the best of brandy, bourbon, and American white oak flavors, as well as incorporating a British malty goodness with a West Coast hop grassy profile at the finish. Undeniably complex, and I'm kicking myself for not buying a bottle or two extra to see how a vintage this great would end up tasting in a year or two. Not an everyday beer, but undeniably delicious. Can't wait to try Parabola and DDBA as well, and immerse myself with FW's incredible barrel program! This is pivotal for sure. Every fan of barleywines and barrel-aged beers must check it out. 3,441 charactersmagictacosinus, May 18, 2013

The body is a murky red brown, with a touch of visible beading... almost like a port. Above that, there's a boozy looking set of carb - half finger of beige head retains well, leaving behind both spotty lace and imposing looking alcohol legs. 
Huge vanilla, oak, sweet bourbon, toffee, dark red fruits, licorice or molasses, brown sugar maybe... mushy cherries, more vanilla... smells fantastic. 
Wow. So... yeah. Wow. All the complexities of the nose converge on the palate to form something entirely unique. Like a bourbon/vanilla/cherry sundae with a perfectly reserved sense of sweetness. There's a nice underlying biscuit flavor that provides a great base flavor for an otherwise rather extreme beer. 
This is exceptional stuff. Far exceeded my expectations, as I haven't been wowed by a barleywine in many moons. Well done Firestone Walker. Well done indeed. 951 charactersyamar68, May 16, 2013

The Sucaba I had on tap was delicious. Very strong bourbon notes, vanilla.. appearance was a very dark black, but not opaque. Thin lacing of head, and smelled very similar to BCS which I had on the side. The taste is spectacular, probably my favorite barleywine, but I don't typically drink this style of beer. Out of a bottle, it is not so complex, a little thinner, but the flavor is there. It is also quite boozy in comparison to the tap. Makes me think the Sucaba on tap was from a year or more ago. Definitely excited to try the other bottles I have in the cellar. 693 characters4amepiphany, May 14, 2013

I wanted to get an idea of how this beer is fresh so that subsequent tastings of it aged can be duly informed.
2013 vintage, "fresh" 10 May 2013
A: Deep red, ruby, burgundy color, transparent through the glass to a light source. A light khaki head forms a thin layer and quickly dissipates to minor sticky lacing. I don't expect much head stability in a 12.5% abv beer like this.
S: Oh my damn. This is fantastic. Strong coconut, bourbon, vanilla, toffee notes immediately assault the nose. A sugary sweetness of candy is present... this beer is going to be indulgent. Blind this doesn't smell too far off from Parabola (some things are missing, of course, and others present), leaving me to suspect I'm picking up almost entirely barrel character over beer character, but I don't mind, because it's absolutely amazing. The alcohol is masked perfectly.
T: After the nose, the flavor comes on just a little weak in comparison, but holds the same character. The vanilla steps up to take the lead followed closely by bourbon and coconut and everything else behind, and only in the finish (and more on warming) do I get the barleywine character in the taste... otherwise this beer seems more like a vehicle for delivery of delicious barrel flavors. Alcohol warms the finish enough that you know this beer is high in alcohol content, and is a primary contributor to the "weaker" flavor in comparison to the nose... which isn't to say anything bad about the flavor, because it's also delicious.
M: Sucaba drinks smoothly with minimal carbonation. The mouthfeel is very appropriate to the style and pleasant for such a nice sipping beer.
O: I quite enjoyed this, despite typically not liking barleywines very much. The barrel aged character of this beer imparted wonderful flavors that balanced beautifully with the beer, although they did seem to take over the beer and mostly use it as a vehicle for barrel deliciousness delivery. I was glad that I was able to split this bottle 5 ways, because with that size of pour I am left excited to revisit another bottle in 6 months or a year. I definitely could not have enjoyed it as much had I finished a bottle by myself, even if the alcohol content was not an issue. Another great barrel-aged offering from Firestone Walker that I would advocate anyone trying. 2,498 charactersjdhowe, May 11, 2013

Pour yields a much darker appearance than expected. Dark plum color. Lots of bubbles creeping up the glass edge slowly feeding the frothy beige cap. Rings of lace left after each wonderful sip. 
Aromas of sweet oaky bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, slight ethanol burn. 
This beer is surprisingly creamy and smooth. Full mouth if there ever is one. This beer is meant to be sipped and enjoyed slowly. Yet, I couldn't help slowly gulping it as the flavors melded so well. The bourbon is present, imparting a mellow sweetness, but it holds back from really overtaking the base. Toasted vanilla beans, fig, plum, toffee finish. The alcohol is dangerously underplayed. 
This beer was a treat. Sweeter than expected, but not overbearingly so. Loved this one. 894 charactersOnenote81, May 09, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had the pleasure of having Firestone Walker's English-style Barleywine, Sucaba, at Lord Hobo in Cambridge, MA in late-March (yes, I have quite the backlog of reviews to do...they're coming along). It was incredible, to say the least. Read on to hear just HOW good. 
Appearance (5/5): Sucaba pours a very dark brown with a small off-white/light khaki head. The head doesn't stay around too long, not that I would expect that from a beer of its strength. Pretty red highlights against the light; this is a good-looking barleywine, for sure. 
Smell (5/5): This barleywine has a wonderful barrel character to it: I'm getting some vanilla and bourbony-boozy notes. One of the most noticeable aromas actually is toasted coconut, which you don't get too often in a beer. It's a fantastic note that I wish showed up more often in imperial stout. You can tell that this beer is sweet but has nicely rounded edges; it's not a sticky, sickly sweet mess. 
Taste (5/5): Sucaba has serious barrel aged characteristics: I'm getting bourbon, vanilla, coconut, but no serious alcohol heat. That comes on after you've already swallowed and manifests itself, rather tamely, as a warming sensation in the chest. Leather, dark chocolate. Very very malty, but not syrupy or cloyingly sweet, which is incredible. Lingering bitterness and burnt sugar flavors finish this baby off. Incredible complexity. The best tasting barleywine that I have ever had. 
Mouthfeel (5/5): Sucaba is smoothness incarnate. Not a jagged edge on this beer to be found, and it's disturbingly easy to drink–but DON'T drink this one quickly...let it warm and savor the changing character as the beer creeps toward room temperature. The body is appropriately full and the carbonation level is right where it should be–low, that is. This beer has the velvet touch. It's not aggressive even though it packs a ton of flavor. 
Overall (5/5): Absolutely outstanding. Easily one of the best beers in the style. Take this one slow and appreciate true craftsmanship. 2,020 charactershagbergl, May 07, 2013

Poured into a sampling snifter...
A little head, pretty dark that dissipated quickly. Pretty dark, almost a soda color. Soda-y fizz. Enticing appearance, but wasn't "beer-y" enough for me to give a very high score.
Strong smell of wood, not astringent at all really. I get some kind of cheery scent also.
Strong wood flavor. Then I get a little wine-y character, followed by a black cherry, chocolate kind of taste. The oak taste brings both charred and fresh character. You know it's strong by tasting, but it presents it very well. A really strong smoke flavor starts to develop, replacing a lot of the fruitiness, chocolate has been gone. Not as strong as a smoked beer, but a lot even for a beer aged this long. It all works well together, which may be the best part (because it is the most important)
This is thick. Full freakin' bodied. Not a fizzy taste (luckily). A little bitter, and a little alcohol feel in the back of the throat.
To say the least, I'm excited to try aging one. Very original beer. A Fun try, one of the better BW's I've had. 1,129 charactersMrBoh, May 05, 2013

A - Pours a murky, semi-opaque, dark ruby-brown, with a wispy half-finger beige head. Tiny dots of lacing, but mostly just slides back into the glass.
S - Powerful aroma of toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, pipe tobacco, red wine, sandlewood, dark chocolate, and the slightest hint of spruce. Complex. 
T - Extremely robust flavors of toffee, vanilla, anise, leather, toasted oak chips, bourbon, mint, date and black cherry. Rich dark chocolate flavor develops as it warms. Absolutely amazing. 6 out of 5. Surprisingly smooth for such a young barley wine. Unlike some barrel aged beers, the wood deepens and enriches the flavor profile as opposed to overwhelming it. 
M - Medium bodied, but with very low carbonation. Works well for the small sips one surely takes when drinking this. Alcohol has a stinging effect on the back of the throat. 
O - A masterpiece. World class all the way, and worth every penny of the purchase price. Nothing else to say besides if you haven't had it, get it. 1,064 charactersTempeBeerMan, May 03, 2013

A: Pours a deep ruby red/brown with about a half finger of light tan head. The foam settles fairly quickly, leaving a tiny ring of bubbles around the edges of the glass. There is some spotty lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is wonderful. I get a lot of vanilla, caramel, toffee, plums and black cherries. There is also an undeniable barrel aged booziness to the beer as well. It's prominent in the beer, but it's not overwhelming. Great balance.
T: The beer starts out sweet with a nice helping of caramel, light vanilla oak, and mild raisin. The beer transitions a into a good helping of bourbon heat, but it's never over the top. It's just right. The flavors mix as the beer moves to the back end and it finishes sweet and boozy. Love it.
M: Full bodied beer. It's syrupy and coating, a bit sticky, and finishes sweet with a great alcohol burn.
O: Excellent beer. This is one of the best English Barleywines that money can buy. Seriously love this beer. It makes me wish it was available all year long. So good. 1,053 characterstrxxpaxxs, Apr 22, 2013

A - pours a ruby red; as you pour you can see the medium to thick body. A 1/4 inch head with perfect carbonation.
S - boozy with vanilla, with a yeast undertone throughout...the sweetness is apparent as well.
T - the booze is upfront, not pushy but not secondary. Vanilla hits immediately after the bourbon, followed by some dark fruit, with a constant sweetbread undertone. The bourbon lasts and is the first to the party and the last to leave; inhabiting the chest as it goes down and exiting the nose as a bourbon vapor should.
M - thicker than medium, but won't choke you. Perfect carbonation...slight fizz to the swallow; much more carbonation than people are citing.
Overall - its a 5. I dont feel this way lightly. Many beers are so close to great, but not quite there. The presentation begins the experience: the box packaging, the bottle size (12oz would be entirely too small), the label, and the ruby-red color...all build a respectful anticipation. Like awaiting a world series game 7.
Once you begin to taste the beer you fully realize the skill in creating this old ale. It's layered perfectly, begging for a drinker to revisit and pick out it's characteristics...Sucaba begs you to share, showing people what passion and craftsmanship, when married, will produce. 
This beer is exquisite. 1,568 charactersVeazus, Apr 22, 2013

A:
2013: pours dark brown with a finger of beige head thades into a bubbly ring with a little lacing.
2012: about the same.
2011: also about the same.
S:
2013: lots of caramel, vanilla, dates, citrus, oak, vanilla, oak, and bourbon dominate along with sweet breads.
2012: lots more vanilla and caramel in the nose here. Oak and smooth rum-like aromas follow with slight dark fruit notes as well.
2011: loads of vanilla and caramel with oak, Port-like aromas and sweet rum.
T:
2013: similar to the aroma, tons of vanilla and caramel with dates, oak and bourbon following suit. The finish is sweet and hearty with surprisingly little alcohol burn.
2012: vanilla and caramel dominate here as well with oak and bourbon being a bit more subdued. Sweet breads and slight alcohol warmth bring up the finish.
2011: loads of sticky sweet caramel and vanilla with oak, Port, and rum flavors. The finish sticky sweet with almost no alcohol burn.
M:
2013: medium-thick body with lowish carbonation, this beer is sticky sweet, but not overly so.
2012: medium-thick body with low carbonation, this beer is a bit less watery and more sticky than the 2013.
2011: medium-thick body with low carbonation, this beer is sticky sweet and coats the mouth.
O:
2013: delicious and tastes great. Super smooth for a fresh bbal barleywine.
2012: still delicious. The 2012 is sweeter and smoother than the 2013. Still very enjoyable.
2011: still quite tasty, though bordering on too sweet.
Overall, I'd say between 0-1 years is best for this beer. It gets a bit sweet with two years. 1,610 charactersn2185, Apr 22, 2013

Deep darker amber pour, with a small beige head that retained as a thin ringlet. Nice sugary nose, toffee and brown sugar, raisins, bourbon, and surprisingly, quite a bit of the wood/barrel profile remained even after aging for a couple years. The aroma was reflected in the taste, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, hint of vanilla, bourbon barrel, raisins, herbal and earthy hops in the distance. Chewy mouthfeel, full body. A great barleywine overall. I have a few bottles of other vintages that I'm looking forward to sampling soon. 598 charactersRifugium, Apr 21, 2013

A: Pours a deep, dark, murky brown with a tiny 1/4" head. Little to no retention or lacing.
S: Tons of barrel (oak, vanilla) and some lingering malts.
T: Wow. Bang on the nose. Plenty of barrel followed by a big hit of malt sweetness finished by some caramel/toffee sweetness.
M: Full body, minor carbonation. The smallest hit of burn trickles down the throat into the stomach.
O: This is outstanding. Remember this review is based on a beer that is pushing 6-8months old. Huge drinkable, layered barrel aged barley wine. Drink one fresh, save one for later. Trust me, it's worth it. 625 charactersWesM63, Apr 21, 2013

A: deep cola-like appearance

M: a lot of carbonation helps to keep it from being too cloying
O: I have been looking forward to trying this one, and I'm glad I did. It is sweet, but not disappointingly sweet. A great example of American Barley Wine; it kept me coming back for more. Firestone Walker does not disappoint 498 characterssmerrell, Apr 17, 2013

A bit of malty bourbon that reall complements the barley wine notes. Kind of a syrup smell too. This is as smooth as smooth gets for a bourbon aged barley wine. Best in class in the bourbon barrel aged beers. This lives up to the hype and would definitely seek this out. Can't say enough positives about the beer. 406 characterssjones5045, Apr 12, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep, rich brown (almost black) with ruby highlights. Not a lot of foam on this one. Less than a finger of tan head.
Smell: Where to start?! An intoxicating aroma of bourbon, charred oak, vanilla, black licorice, light tobacco, and subtle hints of Montmorency cherries, red wine, coconut, and raisins. A heavenly experience for the olfactory lobes.
Taste: Follows the nose fairly closely. If I were to sum up the flavor with just three words, they would be "bourbon", "oak", and "vanilla". But there's also a little bit of baking chocolate and some caramel as well as fleeting hints of the aromas mentioned above. At 12.5% its not surprising that there's a good deal of alcohol heat, making this a slow sipper.
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with fairly low carbonation. Goes down smooth with a little kick in the finish.
Overall, this was a stunning and wonderfully complex barrel-aged English-style barleywine. I've had quality beer from Firestone Walker in the past but this is on a whole other level of greatness. 1,057 charactersWolfsbaneBloom, Apr 10, 2013

A- Pours a semi-opaque dark brown color with a 1/2 inch tan head that retains slightly before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a small streak of surface foam. Slippery lacing leaves a broken ring behind on the glass. 
S- Chocolate, caramel and cookie dough dominate the nose very pleasantly. Booze is present but distant except when deep sniffs are taken.
T- Malt is teetering between toasty and roasty with a firm but non-intrusive alcohol flavor. The hops provide just enough bitterness to balance the caramel-like sweetness of the malt. Quite smooth for the ABV. There's a slight smoke flavor but it commingles with the sweetness enough to make for a hickory/honey/maple barbecue sauce note. Hard to pin down but enjoyable. Man, is this complex. Becomes more boozy as it warms.
M- Not as full as expected given the color but that's not a bad thing. The alcohol brings a bit of a sting but is subdued enough to be overlooked. Medium-low carbonation.
O- Not the first FW beer to leave me pretty much speechless and I'm sure it won't be the last. 1,132 charactersImmortale25, Apr 10, 2013

This tastes exquisite. Caramel ,toffee, vanilla, coconut, bourbon/alcohol peeks through a bit as well as a touch of chocolate and cherry fruitiness. Damn.
Subtle bubbly carbonation with a nice smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.

A: Very dark amber/brown with a moderate light khaki head.
S: Tons of carmel, bourbon, brown sugar, french vanilla, toffee. Some wood/oak and a bit of wine/tannins. Some leather, a bit of tobacco, dates and figs as well. Really malty, bourbony and complex.
T: Tons of rich toffee, carmel and big malty notes up front with a good hit of really nice bourbon. Some tannins coming through from the wine barrels adds a really nice touch. Its got that great firestone walker barrel flavor near the finish, a nice woody/bourbon and toasted coconut taste. Lots of vanilla, oak and bourbon in the finish as the palate slowly dries. The bourbon is very present and frontal, but its never boozy or overpowering.
M: On the upper side of medium/lower side of full. Softer carbonation. Fairly smooth.
O: Drinks a lot less than 12.5%. A sipper, but only because its really complex and you want to savor it. Best barrel aged beer I've had that hasn't been a Imperial Stout. 974 charactersherman77, Apr 08, 2013

A: 4.5 - black cherry coloration, minimal clarity (can't see or read through), yellow-brown one finger head dissipates into subtle glass lacing, moderate-to-large alcohol legs
S: 4.75 - lots of barrel and booze notes...Shiraz tannins (maybe aged in wine barrels), roasted coconut, French vanilla, toffee, caramel
T: 5 - on the front of the tongue, it's what you'd expect from the aroma with minimal hop presence and no bitterness but lots of candy sugar sweetness, milk chocolate and coffee; as it settles in, some of those barrel-aged qualities reappear with burnt candy, caramel, toffee, vanilla beans and bourbon; to my taste buds, this is a damn near perfect tasting barrel-aged British barleywine
M: 4.75 - full-bodied, boozy and sticky; mild-to-moderate carbonation
O: 4.75 - definitely one of the best if not the best barrel-aged English barleywines that I have ever tasted; there is so much (almost too much!) going on in the nose and mouth; it definitely lives up to the hype and is worth trading for and aging to try in a vertical tasting; my only complaint is that it can be expensive ($15.99-$21.99 in the greater D.C. area) 1,288 charactersMNishCT77, Apr 06, 2013

S- Sweet, boozy bourbon, vanilla, oak, hints of toast, maybe even a hint of toasted coconut.
T- Slightly sweet at first with some boozy, malty flavors giving way to sweet delicious flavors. Candied sugar, vanilla, hints of oak, still that tiny hint of toasted coconut, maybe even some dried fruit.
M- Full bodied, medium carbonation, some booziness to it, but overall smooth and drinkable.
O- An excellent beer, no doubt about it. The maltiness plays off the sweet barrel flavors very nicely. Lots of complexity and great depth. 727 charactersstephenjmoore, Apr 05, 2013

A: Chill-hazed body clears as it warms, leaving behind a clear amber, with a light tan head and good lace.
S: Big notes of malt, sweetness, and barrels all collide - initially pretty subdued, but unfolding as it warms with notes of vanilla, toasted almond, faint toasted coconut, darker fruits, raisins, oak, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and figs. Hops are pretty buried.
T: Follows the nose, supremely drinkable too this fresh. Caramel and toffee sweet malt characters bordering on decadent...faint oaky vanilla blended with toasted coconut and almond. Figs, raisins make up the dark fruit component. Again, hops are pretty minimal, as is the heat, which is surprising me for this vintage.
MF: Creamy medium-to-full body, lighter carbonation, good viscosity for 12.5% beer. Minimal alcohol booziness.

Misc.: N/A
Poured a black amber color with three fingers of khaki cream head. Nice amount of thick, sporadic, foamy lacing on the sides. Good retention all the way down.
Smelled sweet, red wine, bourbon, sour cherries, caramel, light vanilla and light smoky tobacco. 
Tasted so smooth out of the gate as the alcohol is well hidden. Got sour cherries, vanilla and not as much bourbon as the nose. Some oak and toffee. Tasted a bit like warm Cherry Coke. Light smokiness. 
Medium body. Creamy texture. Soft (below average) carbonation. Warming, smooth finish. 
Wow! I finally got to try this and it didn’t disappoint. Smooth and flavorful all the way down. Would love to get my hands on this again. Wanted to go a 4.75 for the overall but couldn't quite pull the trigger. 936 charactersBucannonXC5, Apr 01, 2013

2011 Vintage 13% ABV
Sampled 01MAR13
[A] A half finger of compacted foamy head, light brown in color and short lived. The body is walnut colored - the darkest shade of brown - showing transparency only when the glass is tilted. A couple minuscule bubbles collect around the glass and nothing more. No lacing.
[S] Dark and sweet sugars, toasted marshmallows. Fading oak. Mild tea leaf and even milder mint. Menthol mixes with a wet tobacco-leaf-like earthiness. Heat is highly evident but integrated. Mint, menthol and tea leaf is not my thing so the aroma score suffers.
[T] Starts of with a complex blend of malt sweetness, heavily rendered but never approaching burnt. A short note of creamy, tootsie roll and semi-dark chocolate rolls in at mid palate, then fades out before the finish. The lasting notes are a melange of dark fruits and dark sugars, namely molasses and prune.
[M] The mouthfeel starts out average with a fine tingling carbonation - but just a tad too aggressive for my tastes - plus thinning it out a little. After breathing however, the mouthfeel comes into its own, and it is really, really good.
[O] A fantastic beer that probably deserves a clean 4.5...but I was just not digging the nose. However, the two weakest aspects - the nose and mouthfeel - improved to damn good after opening up to room temperature. 1,382 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Mar 30, 2013

But this is far more than just a BW, it's like dessert in a glass. It has pretty much every wonderful aroma and flavor mixed into it, and each time I have it, it never disappoints. If you haven't tried it yet, I'd strongly suggest seeking it out. Simply sublime. 362 charactersalysmith4, Mar 26, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +3.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75this is not an English-style barleywine. if you know anything about beer, this is obvious and I need not go into further explanation. that said, i feel this is brazenly, unarguably an American -ized version of the style and a goddamn fine one at that...
A: (sort of, but quite) turbid on the pour....big-ish bubbles and the head breaks down quick....darkest of red (-brown) in color....brightens and clears up late, but still retains some haze....no lace....eh to look at
S: vanilla (oak barrel) and charred wood (bbq-ish) right off the bat....fairly potent cocoa and stronger dried fruit aromas, easily raisin and one more, maybe apricot?....bit of dark brown sugar....the smell doesn't permeate my sinus, smattering on the back of my nostrils like select others, but it's still mighty inviting...cons: lil lack of hops and fruit? ease off the (dark) crystal
T: the barrel aging pervades the whole...pretty complex from start to finish (more so colder?!)....start - chocolate, oak, dried old cherry, smooth ethanol....halfway - burnt/roasted-ness (dark crystal, chocolate malt), floral phenols (in essence, not so much flavor)...totally malt-driven, alc/phenols cut and balance....dark crystal looms large in the aftertaste, caramel....
F: there's a nice, bright, revitalizing warmth from the alcohol, et al....nice malt roundness that quickly vanishes into a uniquely dry (tannic) and cleansing(?/lifting?) finish....supreme balance between the malt and alcohol - it's so well-woven in, until the beer warms up quite a bit (I found out that eating a sugary-sweet food (chewy granola bar) with this accentuates the booziness multi-fold - but this isn't news to me, I suppose)
O: (hardly) arguably one of the top 3 American barleywines I've had - worth the extra effort on their part....very nice - highly recommended, for yourself or as a gift 1,849 charactersBouleboubier, Mar 26, 2013

A: a slight haze on an otherwise dark brass/copper hue. 
S: complex. coffee, caramel. a lot of oak, but not a ton of bourbon. present but not kicking you in the balls. dark cherries. a lot of vanilla. 
T: more vanilla. booze. lots of booze, actually the first thing I notice. bourbon on the palate is where this thing comes to play. big time booze makes me think I didn't age this long enough....some roast and chocolate as well. 
M: mellow. little bit of carb sizzle but nothing crazy. full bodied for sure.
D: glad this thing has gotten as low as it has (attenuation wise) otherwise it may be tough to drink. otherwise, super big. dark flavors. dark chocolate, bitter dark grains, black cherries, complex, more boozy than I would like. I wouldn't have mind it if I aged this for another couple years just to smooth it out a bit more. however, still super drinkable now. 950 charactersJimmys, Mar 25, 2013

S- I was surpised how little nose there was, but from I could pick up it had a sweet, sugary base, bourbon, with molasses and malt. 
T-what was missing in scent it far made up for in taste. It has a great bourbon and alcohol kick, with very nice touches of vanilla and caramel. 
M-it is easy to drink, but has that syrup-like texture throughout. 
O- a great treat on draft. Although it didn't have quite the kick that the bottle I had a couple of weeks ago. A fanatastic beer either way. 634 charactersdrrone, Mar 24, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark burgundy colour. Quite murky but a bit of a vibrant hue when held up to the light. Head is beige, with small bubbles, just a ring of foam left with disappointingly little lacing. Looks good, but a bit too big for its own boots.
Smell is very, very sweet but a nice sweet, with massive, massive coconut aroma - just huge, sticky coconut flesh, touch of vanilla and some pleasant sugar notes. Hint of some peachy, floral hops behind, but it's all that secondaried booze note, lovely clarity and tempered sweetness.
Taste is in a similar vein. Plenty of sweet malt underlying, with caramel, toffee and brown sugar, then over the top comes a succulent boozey sweetness with that lovely desiccated coconut flavour, hints of vanilla, and then yeah, a bite of booze late which is an unfortunate glitch. Palate is beautifully constructed as far as strong, sweet malt bombs go, but that unmistakeable heat from the booze on the back is a definite overstepping of the line.
Good body, not too thick and heavy but the hot booze on the back is noticeable and sharp.
With that in mind, this is a big, cuddly and loveable brew. Flavours I love and the development of the palate is superb. If not for that slight overheated booze on the back, this would have been held in wonderful balance. 1,292 characterslaituegonflable, Mar 21, 2013
4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 22oz brown pop-top bottle, nicely boxed. Classy labelling and presentation. 2012 vintage, purchased from HyVee last year for around $15.00. Split with my wife into two Chimay chalices to commemorate a bittersweet day today. Sampled between cellar and room temperature. 
Appearance: Beautiful burnished English walnut hued beer with a light beige cap which soon falls to a thick ring and patchy lacing. Lots of small sediment in suspension, but that's not particularly surprising. Beautiful burnt orange highlights when held up to the light, and tiny bubbles of streaming carbonation. 
Smell: Incredibly rich and powerful. Very sweet notes of dark or slightly burnt caramel with dark fruity notes and a subtle kick of alcoholic heat as well. Rich, warm malt tones and no hop aromas to get in the way; the aromas are so thick and intense you can practically see them. 
Taste: More complex on the palate than the aromas (as good as they are) suggest. Dark caramel, English pale malt, a dark spiciness reminiscent of Fisherman's Friend throat lozenges (menthol, eucalyptus oil, licorice), a bit of fruity alcohol, and a subdued, fruity English-hop bitterness. Ends on the light side of medium bitter and this, in combination with the alcohol, prevents this from becoming at all cloying. 
Mouthfeel: Big and soft, though not quite as heavy as some big bruiser imperial stouts or the like...the mouthfeel works well for this beer. 
Overall: Opened this today to celebrate the fact that after several years of looking forward to it, I finally had a paper accepted at the 2013 International Medieval Congress in Kalamazoo, MI, AFTER I had decided to leave my PhD program and academia behind me. Everything happens for a reason though and, even if it sucks, the wife and I thought we'd split this tonight to celebrate. It really is a fantastic beer, second only to King Henry in terms of an American-made English-style barleywine. This is the second time I've had it aged now (had the 2011 in 2012) and can honestly say that I don't understand any of the people who like this fresh over aged. I had the 2012 fresh and it tasted thin and almost hot to me, with very little depth of flavor. This, however, is another story. I picked up 2 of the 2013s, and I'll definitely be hanging onto them for awhile. Paired with some good English Red Leicester, this is fantastic, and a good value for the money.

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz. bomber bottle that was sealed in a wine box. The box had the history of the beer, the fighting or the getting to ready to fight lion and bear, and a vintage year. The bottle itself had paper wrapped around the cap and a simple label that had a wealth of information about the beer. The label had the beer's O.G., IBU, cases produced number, F.G., yeast variety, color, a reserve number of 003, and another vintage year. This is from their current vintage, 2013. Poured into a Big Eddy (don't laugh) Snifter. 
The label said this beer was dark ruby in color and I have to agree with that statement. It was so dark and murky and it almost looked dark brown in color. No highlights in this beer. The murkiness of this beer sent the ray of light back into the lightbulb. Out of nowhere rose a 1/4 of an inch head of foam that was light khaki in color. It had acceptable retention that left behind a tiny string of rings along the side and only a handful of sticky spots of lace around the glass. The appearance of the beer was just as nice as the beer's packaging. 
The first thing I noticed about the aroma was how sweet this beer was. It's not rot your teeth sugary sweet, but pretty damn sweet. Up front was the brown sugar, toffee, molasses, sugar coated nuts, and a whiff of French vanilla. Following the sweet aromas was a little roasted malt, black cherry, and figs. The aroma then finished up with a subtle oak, bourbon, and alcohol. All the sweets mixed well with the dark fruits, bourbon, and oak. 
Unlike the aroma, it wasn't the sweet flavors that kicked off the taste. It started off a little odd with the taste of alcohol and a hint of roasted malts. Quickly following that odd taste was a bunch of dark fruits. This bunch included figs, raisins, and black cherry. It was after the dark fruits when the sweet flavors emerged. The sweetness wasn't dominating like they were in the aroma. I found a little caramel, brown sugar, and French vanilla. Like the aroma, the taste finishes up with a drop of bourbon and a dab of oak. Very interesting. Nothing really dominated the taste and I'm perfectly fine with that. There were plenty of flavors to keep my tastebuds happy.
Despite this beer clocking in at 12.5% ABV, I found this Barleywine to be more medium bodied than full bodied. It's a little weird. The aftertaste was on the sweet side. The sweets dominated the aroma, was calmed down in the taste, and tried to come back in the aftertaste. The aftertaste was a little sweet with caramel, brown sugar, roasted malt, black cherry, figs, French vanilla, bourbon, and oak. This semi sweet aftertaste will last for a few minutes before it decides to leave. 
I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. Did it live up to its hype? It did for me. I would have liked more bourbon and oak aromas and taste, but that's probably due to this beer's young age. I would love to age a bottle to see how it will taste in the future, but I only scored one bottle. So sad! 2,982 charactersAltBock, Mar 20, 2013

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Abacus (2013 release) opens to a malty, fruity, alcohol-soaked aroma that is instantly appealing. Perhaps most noticeable are the huge fruit esters, including fig, raisin, plum, prune, and date, as well as lighter bits of pear, cherry, and berry. These lie atop a heavy vanilla-soaked caramel-and-molasses body, with wildflower honey, honeysuckle, and loads of brown sugar thrown in, as well as a bar or two of good milk chocolate. The grains bring thick brown breads, toast crust, biscuit, rising wheat dough, and floury baguette, and the hops add just a touch of pine and grapefruit. The beer also carries a thick barrel-aged overtone of vanilla, oak, and bourbon, the latter notes combining with the darker fruit esters to lend a port-like quality. On the whole, the nose is fantastic, and what was obviously a very good Barleywine before the barrel aging has been transformed into a small slice of heaven, featuring amazingly well-balanced fruits, breads, alcohols, and hops; it’s hard to imagine how this beer could be made to smell any better.
On the tongue, the barrel aging is immediately noticeable, with bourbon-soaked vanilla beans and charred oak chips rising quickly to the surface. These are joined by the fruit esters, here bringing in fig, raisin, plum, prune, pear, and cherry, as well as bits of brown sugar and a touch of molasses. Thick brown breads, as well as toast crust and rising wheat dough, add earthy touches. Subsequent sips bring an even heavier bourbon, vanilla, and charred oak onslaught, along with bits of kola nut, and a hint of pine. The aftertaste is heavy on bourbon, with bits of sugar hanging on for dear life. Mouthfeel is medium to medium-heavy, and carbonation is medium.
Overall, this is very good beer, and I suspect with aging it will become even better. However, as young as my bottle is, the bourbon notes simply overpower many of the flavors, making the mouthful not nearly as mouthwatering as the aroma, and giving the beer a very strong Jack-and-Coke overtone. If I buy a second bottle of this—and I likely will—I’m going to cellar it for a good two years. 2,117 charactersjondeelee, Mar 19, 2013

2013 Vintage served in a tulip glass
Appearance: Pours an extremely deep dark ruby red. About 2 fingers of a light khaki head that dissipated to thin collar. When held up to light there's some fine but visible sediment floating in the glass.
Smell: Caramel, toffee, dates, vanilla, milk chocolate, whiskey, coconut. As with so many of the FW barrel aged beers the aroma is super complex and inviting.
Taste: Vanilla, dark fruits, dates, plums, caramel, sweet bourbon, oak. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Carbonation is on the higher side of light. Slightly sticky mouthfeel. Inanely smooth for 12.5%
Overall: One of the best barleywines I've ever had. Incredibly complex and insanely smooth. Seek out a bottle to drink now and a few more to age. 756 charactersJonada, Mar 18, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep, deep brown (almost black) and leaves about a half finger of tan head.
Smell: Lots of chocolate and bourbon come out right away. Definitely some toffee and caramel in there as well. Very pleasant aroma, not overbearing at all.
Taste: Matches the nose completely (chocolate, bourbon, toffee, caramel and perhaps some dark fruits), but then finishes with some alcohol which is definitely there but doesn't kill it or overpower the other flavors.
Mouth-feel: Surprisingly thin for this type of beer and for the flavors involved. Some carbonation, but not a whole lot.
Overall: A pretty good barrel-aged barleywine. This one has a whole lot of heat to it however which can always bring some mixed reactions. I don't think it kills it, but adds some interesting character. 866 charactersResuin, Mar 18, 2013

Pours deep garnet hued chestnut with one and a quarter finger sandy head. No lace. 
Smells of rich caramel, toffee, vanilla and bourbon. 
The sweet, rich nose did not disappoint. Nice bourbon character with layers of toffee, vanilla, oak, caramel, burnt sugars, dark fruit, wine, butterscotch, toast and a smidge of cinnamon. There's a little nip of booze but this is sweet and smooth. 
Creamy, semi-oily, medium thick body with nice light carbonation. Sweet, slick bourbon toffee finish. 
An outstanding barley wine. Excellent balance between barrel, bourbon and caramelly malty goodness. I tend to like the hoppy barley wines (Hog Heaven, Behemoth, etc) but this is fantastic. Another must try offering from Firestone Walker. 826 charactersThickNStout, Mar 17, 2013

Otherwise, this brew is out of this world. Pours a deep ruby color with a moderate 1-finger head. Smells of sweet malt with bourbon and vanilla overtones. The typical mellow oakiness is also present from the barrel aging. Overall, the flavors are perfectly balanced without any single one overpowering the others. A tad heavy on the sweetness, but absolutely nothing offensive. The 12.5% ABV is present, but fits into the overall flavor profile like the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle. The sweet heat and bite is a welcomed finale to each outstanding sip. A solid A+ for this brew, nothing less. Easily worth the $15/bomber and I'll be looking to stock up on this each and every release. 805 charactersDrewV, Mar 15, 2013

Pours a crimson brown with a little bit of head that quickly faded away into nothing. The smell is extrodinary with a lot of toffee, vanilla, bourbon and I want to say cinnomon but, it might just be a spiceness. The taste of this beer is other worldly, it is another absolutly fantastic addition to FW's Rep. It is sweet but not too sweet. Bourbon and wine barrells really mellowed this beer. Not a lot of taste from the wine barrells which I like. Overall an excellent beer that I will enjoy from time to time. Not trading this one. 546 charactersMumbler, Mar 14, 2013

My first bottle of this, expectations are through the roof 
Pours a thick ruby brown with a little transparency around the edges. Held up against the light a lot of suspended particles float around clouding the beer. A half finger of foam has receded quickly and now has amassed around the ring of the glass with some moderate lacing
What a rich aroma! hops, caramel, coffee, chocolate, cinnamon, toffee, tobacco, brown sugar, sweet malts and alcohol all thrown into one bottle. Very complex and intricate, easily makes a 5
Taste falls a little below the aroma in telemetry. Hops, caramel, dark fruits, toffee, bourbon, coffee, butterscotch, toasted sugar, malt and alcohol. Lots going on here, very good also
The feel is a thick body with a creamy finish. Some definite heat to the beer, as is expected with so little age. Nice tingly burn on the tongue from the carbonation, very sippable 
Overall this stuff is pretty good, but I'm a bit let down after trying parabola last weekend. This really needs to lie down for a while, should really improve with some age. I have three more in my cellar, I'll return with a re-review in a year or two 1,187 characterslordofstarside, Mar 14, 2013

A: Pours a dark Ruby red, that I can slightly see through. VERY thin white head, that dissipates quickly. Surprised by the lack of alcohol legs on this one, for such a high Alcohol %. 
S: BIG barrel, bourbon sweetness, medicinal dark cherry. Not very aromatic for me which is surprising. Vanilla striking in as well. 
T: Vanilla, caramel up front. Very smooth with light maltyness.Getting slight medicinal cherry on the tongue as well. 
M: Medium bodied, slight alcohol burn warming the mouth, minimal carbonation, sticky sweetness coats the mouth. 
O: A home run from FSW. Fantastic beer, that I can't wait to see how it develops. 680 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Mar 10, 2013

A- Pours a rust colored body with a very small head that reduces quickly to a white ring. Dark and nearly opaque, can't tell if it's hazy but I think it is.
S- French vanilla coffee, bourbon, toffee, vanilla beans, butterscotch candy, white chocolate. Definitely smells like a dessert beer. Very nice. 
T- Upfront there are sweet caramel, vanilla, bourbon notes. This develops into coffee and dark fruit notes, finishing slightly roasty. Warming booze definitely present. The aftertaste is amazing, toasted malt and vanilla cake. 
M- Low carbonation, medium-heavy body. Split this one. 
I've waited a long time to try Sucaba and it didn't let me down! This is such a complex brew, and the bourbon really stands out and makes a grand presence. It's a heavier version of Founders Backwoods Bastard in my opinion, and that's one of my favorite beers. 958 charactersgcamparone, Mar 09, 2013

Deep amber, clear in appearance with a very creamy half finger tan head. Spots cling to the glass sparingly. Lots of caramel with toffee candy, rich chocolate, vanilla, and strong oak (not overpowering). Toasted wheat bread is also prevalent. Caramel and vanilla dominate the palate with dark chocolate, candied sugar, and lot of booze to end. Feel is slightly viscous with a dry finish. Great, but I can't have more than a snifter since it's so sweet. 489 charactersPhilousa, Mar 05, 2013

A - very dark ruby red. The label calls is "dark rust", which I would say is correct. Looks almost black away from the light, held to light, the red comes out. Not much head unless you really pour down the middle, then about an inch or so that retains for a bit.
S - a lot of caramel and vanilla dominate. Some bourbon and alcohol on the edges.
T - Taste follows the nose. Sticky vanilla and caramel up front. Very very smooth, with some light toasty malt type flavor next. Finishes with medium hop bitterness. It seems to lack a little bit of complexity somewhere, but its more than made up for with the smoothness.
M - just on the thick side of medium. Very low carb. Excellent.
O - really great beer. Super easy drinking, hides the ABV no problem. Could drink this every night. Only gripe would be a little lack of depth in the flavor profile, but overall an A/A+ beer 888 charactersBeerandboards, Mar 04, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this beer up at All-Star Pizza and Pub in Parkville. Just stopped in for one beer, and I had heard this was a good one. So I gave it a shot. From a tulip glass.
Appearance - Poured a deep ruby, almost black, with a thin, half finger head of quickly receding head that left outstanding lacing. I personally don't think it was presented well by bar staff, but thats just me.
Smell - Big time dark fruits, oak, booze, and some vanilla and other sweetness. This was a complex smell, lots of layers to it that all kind of merged together. Really good.
Taste - Follows the nose quite well, but I think it improves on the nose even. The dark fruits and vanilla are the big time players on the palate. Oak, dark fruits, and toffee/caramel wash the palate at the start, with the vanilla sweetness bringing up the rear with a slight malty backbone. This was an outstanding beer, for sure.
Mouthfeel - Smooth, like a big stout, creamy, and rich. There is certainly a boozy, bourbon element on the finish, you know this is a high ABV beer. Coats the throat with warmth and goodness. 
Overall - This is truly one of the best beers I have ever had. Firestone Walker is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries, in that their line is so varied and robust. This is an exceptional beer. I thought it was a stout at first, and put it on line with BCBS. I wasn't until I reviewed it that I learned it was considered an English Barleywine. You need to go get this brew as soon as possible. 1,486 charactersTheCondor, Mar 04, 2013

A - Dark Ruby, pencil thin head - dissipates quickly, say 2 min.
S - Sweet bourbon - but not overpowering, carmel malt, dried plums/dates. overall not real potent other than the bourbon.
T - Oh wow. This is real nice. sweet malt with great bourbon. Carmel, molasses, barley, oak/woody. Hop level is low. Sweet all the way thru- but certainly not a syrupy taste that could rise with such a sweet brew. 12.5 ABVs hidden completely. very impressed.
M - Thick feel, not as velvety as a stout but very nice, froth tingles on the tongue. lingers for 1-2 min. coats mouth very well
O - Amazing. Everything a person is looking for in an english barelywine. If i really had to pick out a downfall (and im nit picking) is a more potent scent. 751 charactersweonfire, Mar 03, 2013

Pours into a tulip glass. Head disappears quickly. Very dark in color.
Smells very strongly of booze, cherries, maybe some oak and vanilla
Taste hits you hard up front with the booze, follows with some sweet, more mellow vanilla flavors. Delicious and complex. That previous statement makes me feel like an asshole, but hey, that's how it comes off.
Mouthfeel is creamy and thick. 
Overall I really love this one. I will probably grab the 2013 and maybe try to age it longer than I did this one. 508 charactersDrStiffington, Mar 03, 2013

Wow, such an insane beer. The best barleywine I have ever had by far. I had a Sierra Nevada Bigfoot 3 days ago, and this beer makes that stuff taste like water. Here is my experience with Firestone Walker Sucaba...
Picked up one from the store yesterday. That was my biggest mistake. I only bought one, when I should have just bought the remaining 9 the store had. Fast forward to tonight. At this exact moment. Let me inhale the fumes. Big notes of dark fruit, toffee, and caramel hit in waves, followed by the oak, booze, and slight vanilla characters. I could smell this from across the room. As I take another quick sip, boozy dark fruit and fig followed by toffee make up the greatest tasting barleywine ever. The barrel characters are also present in the form of background vanilla and wood flavors with an improved smoothness in the mouthfeel. 
This stuff is amazing. It reminded me a lot of when I had Parabola the first time. Between Double DBA, Parabola, and Sucaba, Firstone Walker can only do amazing stuff with their barrel program. Can't wait to crack open my FW 16th anni later on down the road, along with an aged 2012 Parabola.
If you can find it, but as much of it as you can. Don't settle for just one, like me. 1,256 charactersTitans77, Mar 03, 2013

A - A lovely brownish amber with minimal head on an aggressive pour.
S - Sweet bourbon, complimented (in a perfectly balanced way) by caramel and toffee.
T- This is the winning category for Sucaba. The amazing balance of the bourbon, toffee, caramel and candied-nut is simply superb and complex
M - Velvety and moderately thick for a barleywine.
O - I'm a stout guy/BA stout guy. That being said, this is one of the greatest and most balanced, complex beers (of any style) that I've ever consumed. The glory of this beer is the balance of the bourbon and additional flavors. They compliment one another perfectly. This is, by far, the best barleywine I've ever tried...and it's not even close. 717 charactersAnotherImperial, Mar 02, 2013

A - Dark brown with a reddish hue.
S - Very complex. Lots of dark fruits (dates, figs, raisins) coupled with lots of bourbon. This turns to coconut and vanilla with some oak.
T - Follows the nose. Starts with an amazing array of dark fruits. There is also some caramel, toffee and chocolate. The next wave is tons of bourbon and oak. This finishes with sweet vanilla and coconut. This is one complex bourbon bomb.
M - Very silky and smooth. On the lighter side for such a big, boozy and complex beer. The finish is long with lots of bourbon.
Overall: Firestone Walker's barrel program makes some of the best barrel aged beers. The level of complexity on this beer is amazing. Tons of bourbon. 808 charactersDrunk_And_Sarcastic, Mar 02, 2013

The beer’s body seems clean, but surprisingly full of carbonation bubbles. The beer pours with a decent sized white head that seems to be turning khaki colored. It mellows down to a half of a finger’s width as the beer sits in the glass. It features nice legs of alcohol as you swirl it in the glass, and leaves little dots of thin slippery lacing on the glass wall. On the nose, the beer smells big and boozy with wonderfully complex notes of plum fruit, toffee, slight raisin and bourbon sweet notes, and even some brown sugar notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes wonderfully sweet and complex with boozy alcohol and lovely mellow toffee and oak notes. The beer begins with caramelly malt that moves into toffee, light bourbon and then explodes into a medley of all those flavors, adding coconut, light oak, very faint char, raisins, dates, and brown sugar. The finish is a little harsh with booze, but also features a maple syrup sweet taste that travels into the sticky aftertaste. You can definitely feel this travelling down the back of your throat, but I think with a bit of age it could be beautifully mellowed, and as is I find the flavors wonderfully mellow while still being big and complex. As it warms up, this beer definitely builds in booziness. On the mouth, the beer feels thick and chewy, but soft and very mellow almost fluffy with the carbonation, almost syrupy. Its body sits on the mellower side of heavy. The mouth is left slightly dry with alcohol and sticky dry saliva. Overall, I’m definitely a fan of this beer. This is one of my favorite Barleywines right now, and I would love to find another bottle and set it away for a couple years. This stuff is thick, boozy, and complex, and definitely a sipper. You should try this beer. 1,855 charactersMaxwell, Feb 28, 2013

A - Sucaba pours a Ron-Burgundy-laced black with a decent khaki-colored head; the lacing is solid, the rim consistent against the glass, and the carbonation minimal
S - I've got some sugary-bourbon notes up-front, with some vanilla, raisin, subtle coffee notes, caramel, and oak all present in the nose
T - The taste of this one advances the nose in the avenues of coconut, cherries, sugared dates, toffee, and booze; the vanilla, raisins, chocolate, and oak are all carried over from the smell
M - Mouthwise, this is one of the smoothest drinking barleywines I've ever encountered; the beer is pretty medium-to-heavy but not at all cloying giving the complexity of flavors; this one is truly an easy drinking BIG BW with complexity and ease of consumption highlighted
O - One of the best BWs I've ever had; the complexity of the flavors, ease of consumption, and generally booze-soaked sweet notes are all pulled off without being even a tad overbearing; I'd say this is the best FW beer I've had, but I still have a Parabola and Sucaba 12, along with 15 sitting in the cellar.

The smell is barrel driven. Alcohol follows. There is a bit of caramel in there as well.
The taste is quite nice, and the fact that there are many types of barrels used for the aging helps quite a bit. Starts with caramel and bread with some whisky and wine barrel notes. Some earthy hops and alcohol follow. Very balanced.
The mouth is a little thin and bubbly. I'm sure this will change with age.
Not bad. I'm not always into Barleywines, but this one got me. The barrel aging helps. Lucky I grabbed the last two bottles so I can cellar one.
2013 Vintage Update
Not much of a difference in the look of the brew.
The smell went from 4 to 4.5. Caramel, oak, candied cherry, chocolate, earth and more .
Taste went up a touch for the lack of boozy heat for such a heavy brew, mouth up too for not being as thin.

A: Deep brown to near pitch black with hues of burgundy when held up to the light. A khaki head rises up after pouring into a snifter.
S: Some hot bourbon along with toffee, marshmallows, espresso, and cocoa. There is a base of oak and bread which holds up the aromatic nose.
T: The alcohol is moderate and comes through as a bourbonesque bouziness. The alcohol is topped with toffee, coconut, vanilla marshmallow smoothness and mocha espresso notes. The oak is substantial with a charred edge. There are also raisins, plums, cherries and brown sugar which add a layer of complexity and sweetness. Strong earth bitterness rises mid palate and combines with the alcohol creating a warm, sharp finish.
M: Full bodied, creamy, and smooth as silk with a faint linger and carbonation.
O: Sucaba is a testament to the supremacy of Firestone Walker's barrel program. Rich, complex, and nuanced, this American Barleywine is at the top of its class. Will be interested to see how this beer drinks with time. Get a hold of this one while its still around. 1,103 charactersElSid, Feb 25, 2013

A- minimal 1/8" head, with a carmel hue. Bubbles are micro and gone around 60sec. Very nice leg-lacing, not rings, more like rivers. Walnut/milk chocolate color body, with slight transparacy, due to the darkness. Great looking beer.
S-vanilla, raisin, oak, cab sauv, coco,coffee,plum. Amazing profile in my opinion; a beer to share amongst your closest friends/relatives(who highly appreciate beer).
high alc up front as in the nose, finishes with coco, and oak. Not a sweet barley wine, earthy. Bourbon cask very apparent
M-nice smooth mouthfeel with a well balanced and conceptual approach. Starts big with the finish complex. On the light side as far as body-mouthfeel in my opinion, for a 12.5%er. Slight pepper tounge/woodsy palate feel.
O- this beer will only be appreciated for those who can handle complex flavor profiles, or pairs it with fine cheeses. Seems like a great bourbon aged BW to pair with a sharp/deep/rich cheeses. Fdub is my name for Firestone/Walker!conitnues to set a standard for me.
re-review: 2013 bottle no.003 stamped
aged in refrigerated cellar ar 53deg, aged 1.5years. pours a nice dark walnut shell; almost pitch-black atop and towards the bottom of the pour it is much lighter looking with the brown tones much more apparent. Head is still there and seems to have settled slightly however still very active. Lacing is spotty, big-pica-dot pattern left on the glass here, possibly the best looking beer/barley wine for sure I have come across to date. Smell is toffee, high quality dark cocoa, pecan. Taste is Dark chocolate first then toffee, then some ripe pear, chestnut, hazelnut, cashew, then a little roast, red wine and some bourbon with definite oak detected in the finish, with the barrel lending it's impression on this beer. heat from the abc lingers, and adds to the layers of flavor, that go well here (such as adding wine or cognac or vodka in to lend complexity, which may add to complexity and refinement). Sweet but not too sweet, medium bodied, and the malt profile here is impressive. Overall, do yourself a favor and serve this closer to room temp than not. Still and will always probably be my favorite barley wines. Merit is off the charts here. Food that pairs with chutneys, and a rich flavor complex. Nutty cheeses such as aged gouda. Black truffle is going to be a top notch match for this beer. Heavily browned or buttered, and earthy/spice-ful dishes. dried herbs vs fresh herbs; smoked or grilled vs. seared. Something that can stand up to one of the most tasty and complex beers in the world. 2,618 charactersBeerswag, Feb 25, 2013

A - Pours out a beautiful dark reddish brown, some ruby highlights and a sticky looking head. Some lacing is following the sides of my glass.
S - Smells like whisky with notes of caramel and vanilla. 
T - Tastes very complex with some burn in the finish, which is welcome for this BBA. I am getting lots of butterscotch, vanilla, toffee and some coconut. Sort of sweet and rich from heavy malts, a bit of leafy hop flavor.
M - Mouthfeel is rich and full.
O - Overall a delicious beer, lots and lots of bourbon in there but nothing seems out of whack. Has a bit of heat which makes me want to age some for a while cause this one would just get better and better. 679 charactersStar80, Feb 22, 2013

A- Pours a dark ruby with hints of light brown colors. Maybe some chestnut or hazelnut colors in there. This beer pours with little head at all, but what appears is not not long living and cream in color. 
S- Extremely complex. Boozy comes to mind first in a good way. Sweet caramel and toffee notes prevail, followed by the barrel aging notes which probably contribute to the booziness. Lots of fresh cut oak wood mixed with a nice pleasant nuttiness. There is so much going on here. Fruity, nutty, oaky, boozy, sweet. 
T- Wow! This one hits it out of the park. Follows nose perfectly. The complexity turns into layers of flavor that challenge the palate. Sweet malty flavors mixed with oak and bourbon, followed by a toffee sweetness that is unmatched. It has a very unique aftertaste of toffee mixed with breakfast blend roasted coffee. The only way to describe this is to eat a Heath candy bar and take a drink of medium roasted coffee. Fantastic.
M- Wonderful mouth coating thickness. Silky smoothness that is amazing considering the ABV. 
O- Fantastic. Glad I got to try this. Even happier that I have another bottle downstairs. 1,174 charactersrfbenavi80, Feb 22, 2013

This was one I've wanted to try for a while and I'm honored to say that I finally had it. The beer poured out as a deep amber color with some brown hues to it. The head was white and actually stuck around for a little while. There was a light lacing on the glass too. The smell of the beer is sweet and earthy, lots of caramel and toffee notes along with some hops too that I am a bit surprised to pick up. The barrel aging also comes in on the nose too. The taste of this beer is awesome. I can't even explain the kind of flavors I experienced here. There is some serious complexity here. The mouthfeel is very good too, it's super smooth with a nice subtle carbonation to it,. Overall this was great, There is no doubt that I will buy this for myself one day to have it again. I miss this beer already and it's only been a few hours since i had it. Very very good stuff. 955 charactersKnapp85, Feb 19, 2013

A: Poured from the bottle into a Duvel tulip. Body is chestnut brown, with some ruby hues when backlit, and a small ivory head that's gone pretty quickly - not surprisingly so, given the 12.5% ABV on this one.
S: Really nice nose - the wood is there in full force (vanilla and oaky tannings), along with toffee, nougat and a boozy fruitiness, like some sort of liqueur. Some spice too - cinnamon and cloves (maybe - though maybe I'm thinking allspice).
T: This is good stuff. Dark fruits (I'm thinking of figs and dates), fruit (black cherries), booze, vanilla, brown sugar and toffee. Oaky tannins at the finish, along with drying ethanol heat. I can definitely feel the alcohol as heat on the way down and into the belly. 
M: Full-bodied with moderate carbonation.
O: This is really solid; I'd love to do the Pepsi Challenge with this and King Henry. 932 charactersKendo, Feb 18, 2013

S: Incredible. Huge vanilla, coconut, caramel. Lots of wood, tobacco and leather earthy notes. So incredibly rich.
T: Huge, hits you in waves. Big caramel, dark fruit; oak, bourbon; vanilla coconut. As it warms the caramel increases and chocolate presents itself
P: Incredibly smooth, slightly chewy. Does not at all feel like a 12.5 beer - medium to full in body. Complements everything else

Aroma of bourbon soaked cherry but you have to go in and get it.
Getting an immediate bourbon head tic (I like that) but gotta sort through the booze here. There's a rootbeer like quality. Profiles of malt and oak. Some vanilla and toasted almonds. Nothing, though, really standing out strong as I'm searching for character. Cool whip cream finish and the alcohol lingers. Find the bourbon distracting at this young age.
I know this is young but I had to try it now. Last week I had the 2012 FSW Dbl DBA and it is a phenom. So I'm not concerned as much that this Sucaba has great potential because of the FSW barrel brilliance. This is a sipper and I'm getting a pretty good whack. Drinkable now and I got two for the cellar; we'll definitely see you next year. 837 charactersjoeseppy, Feb 17, 2013

4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 522oz bottle. 2012 vintage. Review from two tastings: one fresh, and this year-old bottle.
Striking dark mahogany with a thin layer of tan foam. It looks potent, and definitely smells the part. Huge aroma that's full of oak, concentrated malt sugars, and booze. Bourbon and cherry notes, too. After a year, fusel alcohols are much less present. A delicious cherry-vanilla sweetness dominates.
Nuclear malt bomb on the palate, but there's a sufficient amount of hop bitterness that steps in to maintain balance. Tons of oaky, malty sweetness, and a bourbon note that doesn't overpower like in some barrel-aged beers. Some tabacco and smokiness on the finish. Carbonation features very fine bubbles and is well-restrained. Sticky mouthfeel. Drinkability is good for such a strong brew, but this definitely has to be sipped and is too mighty for pretty much any dish. Alcohol is extremely well masked, especially on the year-old bottle.
This is an epic beer and worthy of all the praise it gets. Firestone Walker's mastery of barrel-aging is a joy to behold. 1,057 charactersgr0g, Feb 16, 2013

Presently the #1 ranked English BW here on BA. Can't wait!
Served in a Duck Rabbit snifter.
A: Poured a dark, dark, prune juice color, without much of a head, if any. A tinge of light passed around the edges, but you really have to hunt for it.
S: Coconut, malt compound, very muted, balance, and EXTREMELY inviting.
T: OMG: This is truly the smoothest, non-sugary BW I've ever tasted. Simply remarkable collection of coconut, dark fruit, and intense malt (but not too). The finish is the true star here.
M: This was not a dessert beer like I was expecting. No alcohol detected at all (as long as you don't include the bourbon), and no lacing.
O: Simply remarkable. It's one of those beers that a) you need to try for yourself to truly understand its power, and b) you'll never forget. 982 charactersChaney, Feb 15, 2013

Smell: booze! great barrel nose with some sweet notes, maybe figs.
Taste: hits you up front with the barrels. booze up front and I love that. Some alcohol lingers towards the end . As it opens up and comes up in temp the booze falls off a bit and things start to change. It gets much easier to drink and the sweetness comes out 
Mouthfeel: medium body with little resinous qualities.

Though a very solid beer all around I personally found a couple of undesirables that lessened it loftiness not the least the $16.99 price tag. Barrel aging can be finicky and I may have drank this early than the peak date but I will likely stick with other Firestone Walker beers - 4.00 962 charactersdeereless, Feb 13, 2013

S- Oak, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and toffee...the nose of this bear is to die for...absolutely fantastic!

The aroma is sweet with notes of maple syrup, oak, vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Very pleasant.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is chewy and syrupy with moderate carbonation. The flavor is much like the aroma, sweet and oaky. It begins with sweet flavors of caramel, oak, maple, vanilla and bourbon. In the middle dark fruit flavors of fig and raisin along with some toffee move in. It finishes slightly bitter and dry. Once gone the oak and maple linger on the palate.
This is a well balanced, full flavored beer. It's definitely worth savoring each sip, but it's easy to drink for the style. The flavor really comes alive as the beer warms. 813 charactersWanderingFool, Feb 09, 2013

Pours mahogany with an inch of beige head. After the retreat a partial skim coat and a few dots of lacing for the duration.
Aromatics lead off with bourbon-laced malt and booze-drizzeled toffee. Hints of vanilla and nougat follow through.
Medium bodied with a sticky, slickish mouthfeel. A bit creamy and lush.
Ripe, plump, juicy malt with boozy bourbon, vanilla, figs, and toffee start the palate. Bitterness to balance and other than that hops are subdued. The beer is assertive on the palate strictly from a strong bourbon presence. Plenty of kick but nicely balanced.
Excellent beer. I will never miss Arctic Devil with this in the cellar. Smooth, boozy, and certainly a benchmark for a BA Barleywine. 733 charactersbrewandbbq, Feb 09, 2013

A- pours into the glass a beautiful deep garnett and gives off an almost wine like appearance until the carbonation kicks in . Semi opaque; holding it up to a bright light reveals some bright ruby highlights playing amongst the vinaceous shadows. A modicum of soft bubbles create a modest 1-2 finger head which quickly dies and leaves patches of sticky lace. Fantastic.
S- Wowzers. No one does barrels like FW. So smooth and complex. Beautifully mellowed bourbony vanilla notes mix with a slightly sweet caramel and a fantastic berry like vinous aroma. Lesser notes of port, tart cherry, licorice, toast, and chocolate.
T/M- Smooth and complex doesn't even begin to describe how sublimely perfect this beer is. Big smack of bourbony vanilla, oak, and toasted sweet bread- especially as it warms. Follows almost lockstep with the nose- light fruit flavors of tart and sweet cherry, pineapple, apple and vinous twang that imparts some dark fruit as well. A rich and decadent sweet dark chocolate flavor also mixes with a slight nuttiness. The flavors seem to intermingle endlessly; new flavors emerging with each sip. As it warms the alcohol makes itself known with a light pepperiness and play nicely with the ever-so-slight tannic astringency.
O- I believe FW adds wine barrels to many of their BA lineup and I think they are what adds another level of complexity that absolutely blows my mind. With a year on it this beer is unbelievably awesome. 1,495 characterssentomaster, Feb 03, 2013

A: A very deep brown/ruby color with a laced ivory white head.
S: Very strong caramel and toffee aromas in the front of this beer. There is a nice bourbon finish on the back end.
T: Very sweet, but not overdone, caramel, toffee, fig flavor on the front end. The flavor then transitions to a smooth oaky bourbon finish. Very well done.

A: Deep otter brown is the pour upon exit with a bready dark khaki head thats moderately sized but holds its own in terms of lengthy stay. Quickly paced micro-efference bubbles rise to the top while a small marginal amount of splashy lace is left behind on the glass walls. 
S: Nice wiff of whiskey upon first uncapping as with thier parabola. Whiskey barrel highlights alogn with dark fruit and a sweet touch of burnt molasses. Again the abv% seems well behaved, feeling much, much lower then its 12.5%. 
T: Burnt molasses caramelized whiskey laced dark fruit and dark malt sweetness first comes to the taste senses. Soothing, charred nature, again a very refined and eloquently brewed example that was velvety with chocolate malts that just melted in your mouth. Let this warm up thoughout the drinking session to fully experience its spectrum with signs of figs, raisins, and prunes coming about at warmer temperatures.
M: Malty smooth mouthful, velvetly viscose nature with a quiet demeanor of carbonation.Whiskey breath on the swallow. 
O: Overall another winner by Firestone. Having just had thier Parabola yesterday, anything would be a hard act to follow but this holds steady on its own. Impressive. 1,269 charactersbeerthulhu, Jan 31, 2013

Deep caramel, toffee, bourbon, vanilla and wood. Sweet and dry, nearly no hop character. Wood and booze on the back end that lingers.
I was afraid that this was going to be too sweet but it's very balanced, toffee and grainy malt with subtleties of cocoa, peanut brittle and light caramel. Wood and bourbon contribute lighter notes of vanilla and char. Finishes beautifully and drying with light caramel sweetness, unsalted pop corn and toasted marshmallow.
Medium bodied considering the abv and dries well. Subdued carbonation, warming alcohol. Not sticky at all.
I recall this being a bit green that first time with alcohol being astringent and the malt being stickier. This is a rich treat that is drinking well after 9 months, balanced and complex. A must have for the cellar. 928 charactersrawfish, Jan 19, 2013

A: Poured a 1/4 finger off-white head that settled to a thin ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Beer is a cloudy, murky ruby color that closely resembles liquefied caramel. Carbonation appears very fine. Kind of like Grammy’s china.
S: Blew me off the chair. Butterscotch, toffee, caramel, plum, prune, huge coconut, raison, bakers chocolate, FIG NEWTONS. The aroma is explosive. If they made a candle out of this, I would buy three.
T: The ABV asserts itself right away so you know Sucuba is not here to play games. There are multiple layers of flavor, unbelievable. To sum, it is the crispy caramelized edges of your favorite dessert. But wait, there is o so much more. In the first wave of flavor you get the ABV burn along with dark fruit, burnt sugar and sour yeast. The body of the beer is comprised of fermented medjool dates. Then the beer takes a wild turn for the third wave. You taste chocolate, vanilla, and coconut macaroons. One could describe it as toasted meringue.
M: Thick and chewy yet incredibly smooth. Coats your mouth with delicate dark fruits and a smoky char sweetness. Unfortunately, because you are obliterated from the heavenly aroma and complex flavor, mouthfeel is a second thought. At this point all you can hear is screams of "SUCUBA". You look around, but no one is there but you.
O: This beer is the epitome of deep satisfaction and mild arousal. Like a quicksand of layered flavors, it appears docile, but you will be taken down, down, down.

S: Red wine, vanilla, and a general bourbon character in the nose.
T: Bourbon, vanilla, a touch of red wine, a touch of alcohol, but it pulls it all together. Delicious.
M: Honestly I don't remember, but this beer was nearly perfect. I'm guessing full bodied and smooth.
O: Like I said, nearly perfect. It's comparable to Lost Abbey Angel's Share (bourbon edition) but with better carbonation. 448 charactersBierJager89, Jan 11, 2013

A - Murky dark brown w/ light highlights on the edges. Light tan head, very minimal that fades to nothing.
S - Nice bourbon aromas. Coconut, vanilla, brown sugar. Very niiiice! (Borat)
T - Has really mellowed out from what I remember the fresh version to be. Coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, some dates, figs. Dries enough on the finish to really balance it out.
M - Like all the strong Firestone beers (to me), mouthfeel is a little thin for these big beers. Carbonation is a little low, but I kind of like it with these intense bourbon barrel beers (ala flat Angel's Share)
O - Great beer. Bourbon character and smoothness are spot on. Only detraction is the thin mouthfeel. 740 charactersjeff1973, Jan 09, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%Just opened an aged 2012 Sucaba, already did a review and gave it a 4.25 overall.
Poured this refrigerated treat into a central waters snifter, and it at first , after a swirl, gave off a Bruery-big alcohol smell, then after a second swirl with a more in-depth inquiry into the aroma , I still get a big alcohol sniff, then you canick out the caramel-toffee sweetness that will come out in your taste buds after a nice mouth-swirl and chew.
As this warms up you lose the heavier alcohol, and get the sweet, toffee, caramel candy smell, a real treat to enjoy through your sniffer.
Yeah, the taste is sweet toffee, caramel, some would probably say the dark , sweet fruit taste, too.
Glad I still have a couple of these to age further, just a real treat to sit down and enjoy, while pondering the world of craft beers. 819 charactersstouts4me, Jan 06, 2013

4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42012 bottle
Appearance: pours a dark crimson, with a 1/4 finger of off-white head that quickly leaves. There's a bunch of stuff floating around in here, not quite as bad as if you poured a Heady into a glass, but this definitely looks unfiltered.
Smell: Barrel notes with dates, figs, caramel, hops, vanilla and some toffee. Delicious.
Taste: Dark fruit sweetness hits right up front then subsides as the barrel character creeps in over it. After the barrel's part in the profile reaches its plateau, it fades out and gives way to booze, paired with some spiciness at the end. After the drink is done, you still have that dark fruit and slight caramel lingering on the palate, which is nice. 
Mouthfeel: Very nice combo of carbonation and velvety body that is just right. This is extremely drinkable for the abv.
Overall: Definitely a unique Barleywine that I'm glad I could try. Be forewarned that it's indeed boozy and probably doesn't hide it as well as some others in its class. This is last year's bottle, so I'll definitely seek out a fresh one in a few months to compare. This company has yet to let me down and are one of the best out there. 1,154 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jan 06, 2013

A: somewhat agressive pour gets NO HEAD, not even a cap. Beautiful claret red, looks like pinot noir. Fuckin sexy. (added later) As I poured the last 8oz into my glass everything had warmed up a bit. Another rather agressive pour gets 3 fingers of frothy almond colored head that fell to a 1/4in thick cap. No lacing but this leaves legs like a red wine too. 
S: caramel notes, vanilla, delicious barleywine smells!
T: follows nose, caramel and vanilla, big malty backbone and a lots of alcohol.
M: thick and smooth. A little fizz makes it go down really nice.
O: despite being less than a year old this is fantastic. No regets on spending $14 on this. Was so overcome by the selection at the bottle shop so I had to s
ask for a reccomendation on an imperial stout or barleywine. The guy said this was one of his faves, glad I listened. 879 charactersN3rdM3t4l, Dec 20, 2012

Pours a crisp clear ruby copper with a thin, 1/2 finger, off white head Really a nice color with great clarity.
Heavy on the bourbon with some sweet, tangy undertones, but definitely dominated by the barrel aging.
Wow, first time having this beer and I am impressed. I will certainly be grabbing more in the future. Very pleased with the sweetness that has been well balanced with the barrel. Hints of vanilla, cherry, sweet caramel. Fantastic!
Nice medium to heavily bodied beer with moderate carbonation, flavors linger on the tongue. I would have given it a 5 with a little less carbonation. 
Man I am pleased with this beer. I didn't expect this to stand up to the Sebago BBBW that I had a week ago, but it certainly has. I have been quite impressed by FW yet again and this has turned be back into a barleywine fan again 854 charactersTheBeerologist, Dec 12, 2012

Major thanks to Thorpe429 for this beer!
A - Strong alcohol keeps the light khaki head from sticking around long but it leaves light clingy lace on the glass. Deep chestnut mahogany brown in color, §ucaba pours very clear.
S - Deep, rich maltiness floods the aroma with sweet caramel cube, milk chocolate, and toasted bread. Very mellow, smooth, but warm alcohol blends with complex undertones of dark fruit esters; raisin and fig. Earthy hops provide a nice balance through the finish.
T - Malt heavy, the sweet caramel blends perfectly with the chocolate flavor for a mouth-watering treat! Fruit esters remain in play as the soothing alcohol finishes out.
M - Soft as velvet, this smooth-drinking barleywine has an exceptional feel that is malt-heavy but still balanced and finishes with a warming, mellow alcohol presence that seems faint for how strong it really is.
O - Deep, complex, and balanced superbly, this barleywine showcases the wonderful malt and warm alcohol attributes without ever pushing the limits. §ucaba is world-class. 1,194 charactersBeerFMAndy, Dec 11, 2012

L – Ruby brown color with a 2-finger bubbly tan head. Pretty good retention but not much lacing. Clear with a good amount of bubbles.
S – Lots of bourbon and lots of woody oak with some vanilla notes. There’s a touch of caramel and molasses and a hint of earthy hops, but I’m mostly getting bourbon and oak.
T – Follows the nose unfortunately. Starts off slightly sweet with some caramel and molasses but bourbon and oak take over quickly. There is maybe a little bit of earthy bitterness that creeps in at the finish but it is overshadowed by the dry, hot, and astringent alcohol. Hardly anything in the way of dark fruits is apparent.
F – Medium-to-full-bodied with good carbonation, a sticky and smooth but astringent mouthfeel, and a woody, earthy, and dry finish. Oak dryness and astringency lingers and accentuates the heat from the alcohol.
O – I’ve got to say I was disappointed by this beer. I was looking for a big, rich, malty beer but what I got was basically weaker, carbonated bourbon. While I do like bourbon, and I do like bourbon-barrel aged beers, I don’t like my beers to taste only like bourbon. The malt and hops are there somewhat but they are completely overshadowed by the taste and aroma of bourbon and oak. The only reason why this isn’t getting a lower score is because this is what can happen with English barleywines if they’re aged long enough. They lose some of the malt and hop characteristics and take on a more sherry-like or port-like quality. However, while I can understand losing some hops, they should not lose this much malt character. I’m not quite sure what the hype is all about with this beer, but I’ve had better barleywines. 1,762 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Dec 02, 2012

Pours w/a thin film of tan head over a very deep, yet fairly clear (when held to the light) ruby body. Just a touch of lacing. 
Aromas are all sweet liquor. Very cordial-like. Smells hot. Deep cherry, oak, vanilla bean. The unabashed alcohol is the only reason this is not a 5. 
Incredibly smooth, but hot. This is a sipper, no doubt. Deep fruit quality... lots of marachino cherry, vanilla/oak barrel, English hops, cocoa... maybe even a touch of brandy. Delicious, clean, and smooth. 
Very glad I popped this one, as I have another 2012 waiting in the wings for some day far down the line. This would be an awesome 10 year comparison, but not sure if I have the willpower**.
**Edit: 3/12/15... I did not have the willpower.  And it is still quite delicious 2.5 years later.  Holds up virtually the same as what I noticed back in 2012. 876 charactersBeerImmediately, Nov 24, 2012

Smell: Bourbon, caramel, toffee, burnt brown sugar, rum soaked fruits, cherry, charred oak, sweet malt, vanilla, fruity esters, plum, fig. 
Taste: Huge bourbon and vanilla notes, middle of the mouth fills with caramel and toffee, rum soaked fruit adds depth to the toffee and caramel notes, raspberry. Tip of the tongue has subtle toasted coconut overlaid with bourbon. End of the tongue has a nice tannic dryness that clears the palate from the initial and middle sweetness. Milk chocolate appears at the end as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Viscous and sweet without being cloying. 
Overall: A massively complex beer. Huge dark fruit notes covered in bourbon and sweet toffee. Just enough carbonation and tannins to clear the palate and make you want to come back for more. Expertly balanced between huge sweet notes and strong bourbon and heat but it remains extremely smooth even as it warms. 1,107 charactersBrandywine, Nov 16, 2012

4a... Pours a deep, rich ruby color. Very little light gets through. A hard pour yields a few bubbles that retreat to a thin ring which leave a few spots of lacing.(4.5)
It has a pleasant sweet aroma. Caramel, toffee, vanilla, dates, as it warms I get some bourbon. Nice balance, not too sweet, alcohol is prominent yet in check. Dare I say that it is sophisticated? (5.0)
The bourbon carries over well. It has wonderful balance in the flavor department as well. Toffee, & whiskey (cognac) lead the way, vanilla, & caramel finish. (5.0)
Nice thick body, next to no carbonation, a bit sticky. Its body is perfectly paired to its flavors.(5.0)
It goes down easy for such a "big beer.". If I had one beer to drink for the rest of my life; it would be this one!(10.0)
4b. Pours root-beer brown, not much light passes through. 1/8" of tan head retreats quickly to a faint ring. Spots of lacing slide back in to the drink.(4.0)
It has a big, complex aroma. I smell whiskey / bourbon, tobacco, cherries soaked in vodka, caramel... Its not about any one component, it is the overall aroma that make this a winner.(5.0)
Taste like an adult beverage to me! The first sip tells me that there is a common denominator between this and 4a. Less booze, and more fruit, though it is still quite boozy.Tobacco is an added element as well. Its flavors do not seem to be as married, no complaints though...good to the last drop.(4.75)
Full bodied with a hint of carbonation, slightly bitter, warm, dry finish.(4.5)
This is a wonderful beer as well; too bad it had to go up against 4a.(4.75)
Im guessing that these are both English style Barleywines, same brand different vintages.
4a. = 2012 SUCABA.
4b. = 2011 ABACUS.
I was fucking floored with the reveal. Not only due to how buzzed that Buzzard and I were becoming, but also getting to share this great beer with a non b.a. At times I think he enjoyed this more than I did. He was more amazed than me with the depth, and complexity of these two beers. It didnt mater to him if he was drinking 4a, 4b. or AbacussucabA.
Kind of weird, I would have guessed that 4a. had more age than 4b. 2,221 characterssitarist, Nov 07, 2012

4.03/5  rDev -9.6%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed blind as part of Blind BIF 7, courtesy of ShogoKawada. Poured into a tulip.
A - Murky chestnut brown with ruby highlights and a finger or two of slightly fizzy head that dissipated before I managed to take a picture. Just the tiniest ring remains around the edge.
S - Big and bold, lots of malty sweetness: dark fruits, perhaps molasses, some nuttiness, and an obvious touch of alcohol. We're in barleywine territory!
T - Tons of nutty caramel (just barely burnt), vanilla, and I'm thinking some oak? Lots of flavors meld together nicely. I learned at a blind tasting this summer that I'm somehow embarrassingly bad at telling whether a beer is barrel-aged, but I'm gonna guess this one is. The alcohol is a little rough around the edges, but on the whole, this is quite tasty.
M - Rather thick, with low carbonation and a pretty big alcohol presence.
Overall, this is a bold, rather tasty barleywine (probably barrel aged, definitely English-style). Compared to some barleywines (I had a JW Lees Harvest Ale not long before this, which, granted, is not bourbon-barrel aged) this one seems comparatively brash and unrefined, but I'm still certainly enjoying it.
I don't have a solid guess... maybe Sucaba?

4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a snifter glass from a current 2012 batch bottle. 
Appearance: Dark and semi cloudy amber. The light does slightly go through it where at the edges you see the tiny bubbles. Orange to white head that is maybe 1/3" but does disappear with little to no time. Still looks very good. 
Smell: Strong caramel scent which hints of brown sugar. It is an addicting aroma that make you want to sniff before each sip. 
Taste: Toffee all the way, has a bitter coffee bean feel to go with that compliments it perfectly. Lightly sweet which could be compared to the dark fruits that are embedded to the body of this brew. 
Mouth: Medium, smoother than most with a light alcohol after taste. 
Overall: Paired with a piece of sharp cheddar cheese this beer is great. As far as (English) Barleywines are concerned this brew is up on top of the food chain but still not on the level of what I reviewed last night. I don't really like mentioning other beers within a review but not too hard to look up. If you see, you buy! and enjoy what quality is supposed to be about. Salud!
I re-reviewed the beer four years later with a much greater appreciation of English barleywine. In lust. 1,180 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Oct 31, 2012

Hill Farmstead wine glass
A: Pours a deep amber color. There was some catbonaton, which was a welcoming sight. About a half finger of slightly off white head. Only stuck around a short while. Definitely seeing some alcohol feet on the glass. Not a lot of lacing.
S: Toffee. Caramel. Vanilla. Oak. Coconut, god I love that about FW beers. Still some mild booze heat there too, even after nearly a year.
T: Really nice booze and chewy toffee flavors greed you. Love that FW barrel character: coconut, vanilla, caramel, wood, etc. Really smooth sipping beer. The sweetness is there, but doesn't make the beer cloying. It really meshes well with the booze and barrel character. The finish is long, and improves with warming.
M: it's full bodied but not as vicious as a stout or anything. The little carbonation that is there helps. 850 charactersinlimbo77, Oct 26, 2012

Aroma of bourbon and corn is very deep with some sweet caramelized malt notes. Taste is a very rich mix between some bourbon notes with light corn ester and some deep caramelize sugar. Bourbon is intense though not too much too ruin the balanced though vanilla notes are harder to distinguish. Residual sugar is also not too overwhelming and some attenuation remains to keep some kind of balance into this big beer. Well done and something I would have again. 567 charactersPhyl21ca, Oct 19, 2012

The aroma is candy like sweet. Sweet bourbon, vanilla and toffee aromas provide the sweet aroma. Some dark fruit notes; booze soaked cherries and fig. Nice big aroma.
The taste is of big smooth caramel and toffee malt base. Some toasted notes as well as a hint of chocolate. Bourbon and vanilla notes provide a big dash of sweetness. Cherry and plum pop out in the finish. The flavor reminds me of the girl scout samoa cookies. A bit of an alcohol flavor in the finish.
The beer is thick with just enough carbonation to help breakup the malt body. Very sweet on the palate but does have some toasted bitterness. The finish is sticky and there is a noticable ABV burn.
Big flavorful barleywine, quite flavorful. The bourbon plays well with the base beer. 870 charactersGmann, Oct 18, 2012

Poured into a snifter.
Pours a deep dark ruby red brown color, some tan colored head that eventually turns to nothing. No lace but a little legs noticable.
Very nice aroma, boozey bourbon is immediately noticeable, caramel, toffe are a little noticable, and hints of wine barrel and dark fruits at first. As it warms it turns to a hot bourbony sweet aroma.
Sweet caramelly burnt sugar , butterscotch, molasses with lots of smmoth bourbon with booze throughout. Hints of fruity wine barrel, more initially but bourbon and sweet caramel dominate. 
Very smooth, thick, caramelly, and sweet with some nice heat. Some very light carb which really compliments the beer. Leaves your mouth feeling like you were just eating some butterscotch candy dipped in bourbon. Very warming. 
A very nice display of some fine barrel aging and blending. This beer is yet another reason why firestone continues to be one of my favorite breweries. 944 charactersdogfishandi, Oct 07, 2012

A: Deep, dark , toffee brown in color. Forms a small bubbly head on an aggressive pour, but the head manages to fizz away as quickly as it forms leaving just the faintest of surface coatings and no lacing. 
S: Oak and bourbon, woodsy, with a light note of vanilla. Molasses, brown sugar sweetness and some caramel to round things out. 
T: Mildly sweet, with the predominant flavor of oak. Coconut, sweet caramel, brown sugar, coffee, demerara, and even a touch of chocolate syrup. Sweet and syrupy with a long, smooth finish. 
M: On the heavier side of medium. Lower carbonation. Low bitterness. Smooth and slick, with a light syrupy character. 
O: A very nice Barleywine. The barrel-aging really rounds this one out quite a bit, adding complexity without the alcohol harshness. To think this is a 13% ABV beer is amazing. 851 charactersFlorida9, Oct 06, 2012

A: Pours a dark amber with a finger of head with a vigorous pour. Retention is OK, but below average.
S: Lots of caramel and bourbon upfront. This beer somehow never smells overly sweet despite this. Booze is evident.
T: Lots of bourbon and caramel with quite a bit of toasted coconut. I get some dark chocolate and maple syrup in the background. Certainly on the sweet side, but this beer never becomes cloying. Hop bitterness is low, but keeps the sweetness in check. Booze is there, but definitely not unwelcome or overbearing.
M: Medium body with low, creamy carbonation.
O: A sweet, great tasting Barleywine. Not overly complex, but well balanced and delicious. The bourbon really shines here without adding a bunch of harsh booziness. 778 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Oct 04, 2012

Not too much sugar, beautiful coconut. Very beautiful palate- not too sticky with a nice fruit juicy character and mild sugar. Super yummy dessert beer. Similar to FW11. Shame it doesn’t pour with a head. Moderate alcohol heat is not distracting at all. Still, Parabola is the Cuvee de Firestone. 11/17/2011 8/2/8/4/16=3.8 621 characterstarheels86, Oct 02, 2012

Wow, I have loved this one for years. Finally a review.
The nose comes to me carrying a figgy malt sweetness. With a vigorous pour I get a dark avacado honey hue and a frothy head that quickly dissipates to a thin diminutive patchy layer of foam.
Wow, I still get a hint of fig, more of a dried fig. A bit of molasses and slight hints of, is that bourbon. I don't remember that from the last time- BONUS! I have enjoyed this barleywine so many times in the past, and I shouldn't be surprised that each time it brings something different.
Lite and slightly slick on the mouthfeel. Don't get me wrong, it's full enough. But while I love a chewy Imperial Stout, I desire a barleywine that's full enough to respect, but not to chew.
Never disappointed with Abacus, er uh Sucaba. 810 characters2beerdogs, Sep 04, 2012

Pours a deep dark brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light and a smallish off white head that quickly dissipates. The smell is really amazing. A little smoky, a bit of brown sugar, some vanilla and oak, cherries and raisins, coconut, no harsh ethanol, wow I could stick my nose under this all night. The flavor follows the aroma quite well but comes in waves of flavor. Sweet sugary malts up front, a bit of oaky bourbon next, some dark fruits wash in then some earth and sweetness then a bit of warming comes in before a semi sweet lingering finish. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet almost ashy or chalky mouthfeel. This one is a sipper that's for sure, but I'm going to spend the rest of the night enjoying the shit out of this. 801 charactersjohnnnniee, Aug 19, 2012

A: Dark, little and quickly fading head, a DARK amber color
S: Booze. More booze. Not really a bourbon/whiskey type smell, just overall alcohol. Buried beneath that I smell some sweetness - caramel and toffee maybe?
T: This is more like it. Not overly boozy in taste, sweet caramel/toffee malt taste with a very faint passing hoppy bite. A fair amount of sweet raisin/fig in on the aftertaste.
M: Big burst of carbonation at first but quickly fades to a smooth, silky yet thick taste. Pleasant
Overall: I'm mixed on it, do I like this? sure. Am I wowed or really impressed? no, not really. A bit too big, a bit too sweet and a bit too boozy. As I take more sips however I am a little bit more interested in it and finally subtle other flavors. Solid, but not my 'wow' beer. 832 charactersmwrecording, Aug 12, 2012

Something about a brew whose bottle is displayed in a box that instantly raises one's spirits. Fortunately, for this brew, the box was well deserved. 
Poured into a goblet, our final brew to cap off the evening. Nice rich amber-copper in colour, with a thin but stable head of white foam. 
The nose is eight different varieties of amazing. Rich caramel, sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, spice, a hint of smoke, and some terrific complexity. The first whiff is truly something else. 
This is an absolutely stellar barleywine, that does everything I want a barleywine to do. Similar tasting notes as in the nose, with hints of chocolate, vanilla, cherry and some other pleasant unidentifiables that work together to make each sip something else. Traditional english hops finish things off. 
Carbonation is a touch hot, but this brew has a nice body and coats the tongue with terrific each time. Alcohol is well-masked. 
In three words: buy this beer. In a few more words: this is a terrific barleywine that was a real pleasure to sip and enjoy. Will be looking for this again. 1,165 charactersJohnnyBarman, Aug 06, 2012

Real thick malts on the nose of this one. Figs are in there as well, but as an accent. Flavor is nice. Smooth and fairly sweet with a bit of a boozy thing to it. Maple seems evident on here as well. Smooth, certainly. But as it's a 2011, it could probably use some age to harness some complexity. As it stands now though, it's quite good. Few barleywines are able to get to this point so fresh. And that is worth noting. After several beers before this, and drinking them "too fast," I wanted a sipper. This is that. Something to relax with, savor, and enjoy. A notable beer. 581 charactersRblWthACoz, Jul 30, 2012

Pour: Deep mahogany with a finger and a half of tan head that recedes to a rim. 
Smell: Vanilla bourbon to the max. Maybe dark fruit, but barely if at all.
Taste: Bourbon and vanilla with a milk chocolate mixed in. Some oaky woodiness is also present. As it warms, cinnamon and baking spices begin to flare out on the nose and the taste. 
Mouthfeel: A sipper for sure. Warm but not overly so.

Tastes just as the nose let's on with burbon first that smooths out to a very pleasant sweetness almost like a toasted marshmellow. Mouthfeel and carbonation are just about as perfect as I can sk for with a barleywine. Overall very good beer. I have had this beer a few times in the last 6 months and always loved it...I have no idea why this sits around in stores. 493 charactersjoefuzz, Jul 19, 2012

a- I immediately thought of tamarind juice when i poured this and saw the color. had a small head that disappears into a ring around the glass. no real lacing. It looks lively. 
s- sweet-smelling. cinnamon, toffee, vanilla, a good deal of bourbon. great smelling beer. 
t- wow, i'm very surprised by this. I get lots of a caramel-cinnamon blend, malts, bourbon. this taste-profile is sort of what i expected Southern Tier's Creme Brulee (unfortunately not the case). This is a delicious beer. Vanilla notes are the highlight, and there's some woodiness to it as well. there's also some heat coming but it's not overwhelming whatsoever. 
m- not as heavy as I expected, which makes it pretty drinkable at 12%+ abv. Has a low-med carbonation.
o- delicious beer. great stuff from FW. 840 charactersdejrrma, Jul 18, 2012
4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Abacus bottle, not sure of the vintage probably 2010. Clear mahogany pour with slightly yellowish white foam. Aroma is typical of a good barleywine, lots of rich toasted malt, toffee, caramel, piney hops, a touch of oak, very subtle though, a hint of vanilla. Taste is rich and boozy, sweet, slightly roasty, cherry, some chocolate. Palate is rich, boozy, alcohol definitely present. Nice barleywine, slightly too boozy though. 427 charactersLuk13, Jul 17, 2012

S - the smell of this beer punched me in the face as soon as the cap popped off. huge bourbon sweetness, all the vanilla, oaky, toffee and vanilla aromas I have come to love from bourbon barrel aged beers, and it's easy to tell right away that this is a quality example. 
T - what else would I expect? The flavors that assaulted me in the aroma pack an equal punch on the palate. especially the vanilla and oak. You can understand that this spent more time in barrels than just a bourbon one. a malt and mild hop profile do become present, but as a mere formality and vehicle for the awesomeness
M&D - smooth, rich, velvety, sweet, powerful; this beer is all those. I am headed to get some more of this. Want to put some age on one. This beer hides a 12.5% punch very well, and behind some incredible flavors. Find it. Buy it. Try it. 955 characterssinstaineddemon, Jun 28, 2012

Pours a absolutely gorgeous, deep, dark garnet. Great clarity. Produced a nice one-finger khaki head. Quick to dissipate, but is actually leaving a bit of lacing. Very nice.
Heavy nose. A lot of barrel characters initially, followed up by a balance of dark fruit, caramel vanilla and some more wood. A definite hit of spicy booze rounds it all out. 
Wow, just wow. This is seriously tasty. Tons of bourbon barrel upfront, but somehow in no way overpowering. The middle is all malt. Super complex; this is hitting all the dark malt notes. Caramel and toffee meet with some figs and raisins. More barrel with wood and vanilla. Hints of chocolate and coffee, even a touch of tobacco. Then a whiff of clean alcohol evaporates off the tongue. 
Heavy in body for sure. The light carbonation helps coat the mouth well and keep it on the tongue. Far from cloying, this beer finishes surprisingly clean. While the alcohol is definitely perceptible, it isn't as "hot" as most other fresh BA Barley Wines. I have to say this is easily the most drinkable BA Barley Wine I've ever had. 
Overall this is a true work of brewing art, and the best Barrel-Aged Barely Wine I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The fact that this is so balanced and clean while still so fresh is astounding. I opened this one at around 45 degrees, and it is now most likely around 55 and it is just perfect. This is now almost six months old and is damn near perfect; I don't see anything more then a year on this bottle being beneficial. This is highly recommended to any fan of Barley Wines or barrel-aged beers. Thanks again TJ, I owe you for this one. Cheers! 1,853 charactersHumulus85, Jun 24, 2012

The instant the liquid swirled in the bottom of the glass the strong bourbon scent wafted above. Sweet, inviting with a touch of cherries and vanilla and heavy on the bourbon on the nose.
The taste is incredible. Almost like eating a chocolate covered cherry that is filled with bourbon. Intense complexity laces every sip. Oak, dark fruit, and crazy sweetness, vanilla. Incredibly warming.
Coats the mouth in melted chocolate and bourbon, yet remains thin enough to let you finish it. Amazing.
If I could find any faults, it would be that it is hot and the bourbon is really fresh in this.
I find this beer more complex and amazing than Parabola. I have one tucked in the cellar, hopefully it mellows out in a few years. A must have! 871 charactersmarkmiller, Jun 16, 2012

2011 vintage.
pours a dark though translucent ruby/caramel tone, sits a deep mahogany in the glass. pour yields just shy of a finger's worth of head that, as expected, dissipated fairly quickly into a collar around the glass. lacing in patches.
nose is just exceptional. one of the best aromas off a barleywine i've come agross. assertive notes of caramel, vanilla, bourbon. a bit of coconut, maybe dark fruits. i'm not usually a big fan of the descriptor 'wow' but, well... wow. well bleepin' done.
taste is phenomenal, just really flavorful and well-blended. the caramel, boubon, vanilla, et al come together to produce a delicious melange; a few sips in and i'm already thinking this is one of my favorite barleywines - english or american - to date. nice hoppy presence in the finish, as well as some warming booziness. my one (slight) criticism would be that it is pretty hot (at 13% ABV this is to be expected). luckily i bought a second to throw in the cellar for a while. 
medium-full bodied mouthfeel with some chew to it; average to slightly below average carbonation. overall? world class, no question. just a killer beer. well worth the cost IMO.

The aroma is absolute HEAVEN! Luscious bourbon notes dominate the aroma, ever so smoothly, with an amazing background dark fruits, caramel, big toffee notes, vanilla and oak.
The taste follows the nose to the T. The smoothness of the bourbon is top notch. Toffee, vanilla and oak dominate the rest of my palate and I'm just begging for more with each sip. 
Full bodied with medium to high carb (the absolute perfect amount for this beer). Definitely some heat, which I think is an asset to this beer and finishes with a sweet burn.
Overall this is a top notch BBBW! I am convinced that this is as close to King Henry as you can get without drinking it. I have a few bottles left and plan on seeking out somemore! 873 charactersdcloeren, Jun 09, 2012

It pours a luscious dark brown, almost black color, hints of ruby red and burgundy when held to the light. A thin, loose, bone colored head sits atop the beer before dissipating leaving behind no trace of a head and no lacing. Most of the beers of this style really don't look like much, and this is no different, but once you get your nose to this beer, you remember why you are drinking it. The nose is massive, huge notes of toffee, caramel, strong grainy malt and nougat, to say the aromas are rich is an understatement. Sweet milk chocolate, a bit of hazelnut come out as the aroma turns into abrasive bourbon heavy alcohol. The flavors are rich and wonderful, the malt and grain hits the tongue first, chocolate comes through much earlier and is more prominent than the aroma leads on. Bourbon jumps out, but is exceptionally well balanced with sweet and luscious toffee, caramel, a hint of nougat and a bit of nuttiness comes out at the finish, which hides the alcohol a bit better than the nose, but it is certainly evident and at 12.5%, it's not unwelcome, but could definitely be hidden a bit better. The body is thick, rich and coats the mouth incredibly well, the carbonation is a bit higher than anticipated, but it doesn't detract too much from the drinkability.
Verdict: This is a sexy beer, rich, voluptuous and doesn't get too sweet even though the alcohol is definitely apparent through the drinking experience. The rich flavors are in great harmony and the bourbon adds a great touch to this Barleywine. This is a home run from Firestone Walker, one of the best barrel aged Barleywines on the market and an anchor in the Proprietor's Reserve Series. 1,724 characterskevanb, Jun 08, 2012

4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My 600th review and it’s a good one. Finally cracked open my bottle of Sucaba a few months after its release. I’m not the biggest fan of barleywines generally speaking and find myself leaning towards the English style when I do enjoy them. Needless to say this one was exceptional and one of the best in the style I’ve had, period.
Pours a somewhat murky, dark brown color with a small head that settles down fairly quickly. Lacing is sticky and web-like. Complex aroma of rum-soaked raisins; vanilla, oak, brown sugar and caramel, lots of other dark fruits and fumy alcohol. 
Delicious flavor! Again there is a wide array of tastes, with prominent booziness and bourbon but not necessarily excessive heat; caramel, toffee, and vanilla, lots of raisins, dates, prunes, and figgy notes. Some nice woody, oaky flavors as well. Bitterness is very moderate with the hops kept mostly at bay by the other flavors, a fact I appreciated. 
Sticky and medium-full in body, with moderate, smooth carbonation. Nicely creamy, with lingering booze and sweetness in the finish. A tremendous drinking experience overall. 1,113 characterstobelerone, Jun 04, 2012

Appearance: Sucaba pours a really dark reddish amber. A slightly muddled mahogany but when held the light it's quite clear. There's almost a purple hue inside. It's quite mesmerizing. A beige finger head is gone in a flash.
Smell:Oak, bourbon, chocolate, coffee and fig are all here and are dissected easily. It's really sweet smelling but the burn of alcohol is still slightly present on the finish.
Taste: The powerful flavors of oak, bourbon and figs stand up front and mix together well while easily being taken apart. As she crosses the center of the tongue, caramel and a flavor of pie crust start to shine. They're quickly cut out but chocolate and oak rounding out the back. The alcohol is just barely there throughout it all. Remarkably smooth for 12.5%
Mouthfeel. There's a lot of substance here. It's quite meaty and full. Absolutely amazing.
Overall: It's good but I've hyped it up a bit much. Still, I'm delighted I was able to get the bottle and it's a wonderful stylistic picture. The folks at Firestone Walker have done it again. 1,133 charactersmtlasley, Jun 03, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 and 2012 served side-by-side. The scores above reflect just the 2012 bottle, but I will discuss both below.
The two vintages look nearly identical, a dark reddish-brown with a small white head. The smell is where things start to diverge: the 2012 aroma is fantastic, full of oak and bourbon combined with brown sugar and maybe even some dark fruits. The 2011 aroma is nice, but not nearly as impressive. The bourbon and oak are more subdued and instead it's got more of the standard English barleywine aroma of raisins standing out. The 2012 gets a 4.5, the 2011 gets a 4. The flavor follows the nose in both cases. The 2012 had much brighter flavors with the oak and bourbon mixing in very nicely with the dark fruits and malts of the barleywine, while the bourbon and oak really have faded to the background in the 2011. 2011 tastes more like a standard English barleywine with a little bit of age on it, much mellower and more subtle. Again, I'd give the 2012 a 4.5, the 2011 a 4. Mouthfeel is largely the same in both cases, medium-to-full bodied with decent carbonation. Overall, I think the 2012 really stands out as the superior beer here, while the 2011 is merely good, not outstanding. I had the 2011 fresh and loved it, and the beer just has really fallen off over time. I guess the lesson learned here is not to age this beer - drink it fresh! 1,360 charactersstarrdogg, May 31, 2012

Flavor is great as well. Immediately I got caramel apple again to start. Then transitions to mildly sweet then a touch heat from alcohol. Wide range of rum/brandy soaked fruit. Very nice mild sweet toasted sugar aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel is medium, but light bodied IMO for the style. Medium-high creamy carbonation. 
Overall a fantastic barleywine. An easy drink with huge character.  603 charactersMrVonzipper, May 28, 2012

Appearance: Caramel-mahogany. Hints of bing cherry. No head but a little bit of lacing.
Taste: Surprisingly mellow. Exceptionally smooth. Chocolate and cherry. Semi-dry cocoa powder feel. The alcohol is there, but definitely subdued. Hints of vanilla and bourbon.
Overall: My God! So smooth. Elegant in its simplicity and so well made. This ended up being my 100th review by accident. I had gotten it to celebrate the end of a major project at work - and it just so happened to coincide with completing my first century. 630 characterssjverla, May 26, 2012

4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle. $16 from Neds. 2012 vintage. Poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Pours a pretty dark, but clear to light, purplish amber color. A bit of a light brown head fades pretty quickly. A few spots of lacing. 
Smell: Dark fruit with raisins and cherries. A sweet, cupcake-like bready smell. A bit of cocoa, but no roast. Caramel. Bourbon, oak, vanilla. Very nice. 
Taste: Its tasty and complex, but its got some slightly unpleasant heat. Fruity, sweet and cakelike, with big delicious bourbon flavor, but some fairly harsh and hot burning on the back of the tongue. When the heat fades, the aftertaste is fantastic.
Mouthfeel: Starts wonderfully smooth and slick, but the pure ethanol burn is drying and thinning. Again, after its gone, the long finish is nice.
Overall: This is close to being outstanding. Despite the heat and burning, its really damn good. Probably needs a year or three. 900 charactersrapidsequence, May 25, 2012
4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a extremely dark ruby red with about 1 fingers worth of head formation upon an semi-aggressive pour. Head dissipates rather quickly, thin film remains. Lacing is decent at best
S:Huge sweet toffee, vanilla and bourbon notes dominate. Brown sugar is in nice harmony with darker fruits such as plums, figs and raisins. Oak is present in there as well. A slight burn of alcohol is also noticeable after the initial pour but after it warms up a bit it comes on stronger, but not to a point where its dominating.
T: Huge bourbon right up front. Immediately followed up by brown sugar, caramelized toffee, vanilla and dark fruits of plums, raisins (very similar to the nose). Oak is also in moderate amounts pushing the beer to a more complex level. Towards the end of brew I pick up on some dark cocoa notes which is followed up by a creamy after taste. Alcohol is also evident in the taste throughout the beer (more subtle than the nose).
M: Perfect. Very medium-full bodied and leaves a nice creamy feel in the mouth prompting myself to take another drink
O: I thought this beer was excellent. Very well balanced and the complexity was perfect. The only thing that is holding this one back from all 5s is the noticeable alcohol. However, some aging should do the trick with this one. And since KH is retired, this one will make a pretty damn good substitute. 1,368 characterstut2528, May 24, 2012

T - Tons of maple and vanilla, a bit nutty, very similar to smell, some sips had some alcohol in the back of the nose
M - Surprisingly smooth. Packs a punch but in all the right ways.

Into a CBS snifter... 2011 version
Dead still with a deep ruby/brown shade and no head or carbonation at all... Barrel aging, baby...
Huge aromas of pineapple, bourbon, chocolate, oak, some vanilla... Not a hint of that booze either... Simply amazing... The aromas are incredible and intense... Those pineapple hops are still unreal after all this time... The barrel is present and takes this barleywine above and beyond into the ethereal planes of what other barleywines only aspire to be... Its freaking unreal...
I'm speechless... I'm usually fairly critical of barleywines with any age on them at all as I like that sharp contrast between the bitterness and sweetness but this is a different story altogeher. Sweet pineapple, dark chocolate, stinging bourbon, earthy oak... No booze at all... This is just stupid... Stupid... At 13%, it's that ass in a hurry if not careful but I find myself not caring... It's in the upper 80's here today and I wish it was in the 30s as I'd sit out on the porch with my snifter and sublimely cruise into unconsciousness...
Easily the best barleywine I've ever had... Head and shoulders above all others... Thanks, Mark!!! 1,242 charactersTilley4, May 22, 2012

A - Dark amber colour with half a finger of bubbly light brown head that quickly receded to a ring around the glass.
S - An amazing bourbon aroma up front full of toasted oak and vanilla. The background offers some aromas of the base beer with some brown sugar and toffee notes coming through. 
T - Big barrel flavours up front with massive toasted oak, bourbon and more muted vanilla flavours. The middle adds the base beer flavours with plenty of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toffee and some lighter raisin/date/fig notes. The alcohol is slightly warming throughout but not overly so for the ABV. The bourbon and oak flavours return in the finish. The toasted/charred oak really shines in this ale, even overshadowing the bourbon, which is a really nice change for a bourbon barrel aged ale.
M - Medium to full body. Thick and sludgy at times. Light carbonation is perfect. Great mouth feel. 953 charactersTheSevenDuffs, May 19, 2012

S:The nose is robust with bourbon. Mild vanilla and oak notes are present. Toasted malt and hops linger in the finish.
T: The taste is incredible. The balance of bourbon, roasted malt and sweetness is excellent. There's a bit of alcohol apparent, but it doesn't betray the 12.5% ABV. 
M: The mouthfeel is well carbonated, but it feels bit thin for the style and flavor. Not bad, just a bit underwhelming.
Overall, this is an excellent barleywine and widely available for a barrel aged beer. Other than a slightly underwhelming mouthfeel, there's not much to complain about with this one. I can't wait to try one with a year or two of age on it. 736 charactersvonnegut21, May 19, 2012

A- Slightly hazy dark brown with ruby highlights. Three fingers of large bubbled off white head. Lacing is magical.
S- Right off the bat you get a nice sweet brown sugar and caramel smell. The barrel adds vanilla and oak that helps compliment the little bit of alcohol heat that you get in the nose. Dark fruits and nice biscuit.
T- Sweet caramel, vanilla and brown sugar. Dark fruits with a little char and coffee in the back. Slightly boozy but it really works with this, nothing over the top in the alcohol.
M- This is a beefy barleywine. Heavy with a nice creaminess, slight carbonation, slight warmth with an excellent chew.
O- I thoroughly enjoyed this. Tasting this now I can see why I like the 15th anniversary so much, this smells and tastes a lot like that. 838 characterskorguy123, May 14, 2012

T- Sweet and tropical fruit upfront with pineapple and coconut followed by caramel, citrus hops, dark chocolate, vanilla and some sweet bourbon. 
M- Low to medium carbonation with a slightly sticky body with some heat. 
O- Quite a sweet barleywine. There is some citrus hop presence, but this one is full of caramel and fruit sweetness that does get a bit cloying, but overall, a good barleywine that is quite tasty. 708 charactersiadler, May 12, 2012

Pours deep, dark brown, almost black, with a chocolate mousse, 2-finger head that dissipates rather quickly. No noticeable lacing. This one only lets a small amount of light through, and is truly dark.
S: Right as you crack the bottle cap, it's hard not to smell the aromas wafting out of this bottle. Potent aromas of licorice, prunes, vanilla bean, molasses, and leather abound in this complex, deeply aromatic brew.
T: Strong and hardy up-front with big toasted English malts; smooth and warm over the tongue with some molasses, and finishing sweet and dry at the same time with some powdered chocolate notes. Big flavor without any one overpowering characteristic, I get lots of molasses, licorice, roasted chocolate malts, dark fruit juices, alcohol esters cut with a nice vanilla coating, and a touch of espresso on the aftertaste.
M: Many English Barleywines I find too syrupy in their feel, but this one has a beautiful balance of being silky, without being slimy. Smooth and robust in your mouth, and definitely with the feel of a sipping beer, but not uncomfortable. A good balance overall, maybe the best "feeling" barleywine I've had...
O: A special treat beer that befits its limited release status. This thing is well worth whatever you've saved it for. It's complex, but drinkable, and has some truly beautiful flavors that occur in perfect harmony. As it warms, it just gets more mellow and tasty. This one is the real deal. 1,509 charactersFeloniousDrunk, May 09, 2012

Boring appearance, minimal head, poor retention. Kinda fits the style, though some of its peers definitely excel in this category.
Malts, dark fruit, and booze in the nose. Some oak notes to supplement, but nothing remarkable.
Plenty of malt and fruits, also plenty of booze. Lots of barrel character from a spirit I cannot finger. Bourbon, oak, and something else. Regardless, the beer itself is an above-average English barleywine but nothing to write home about.
I've had Abacus (and now Sucaba) a number of times each, and I never understand why these receive so much praise. There are MANY superior barleywines out there; don't waste your liver capacity on this one. 705 charactersbrystmar, May 05, 2012

S: Big and malty. Fruit. Wine? I'm actually not that impressed.

M: Smooth and dull/matte.
O: A damn fine beer, but a bit boozy for me. Not one-dimensional, but...monochromatic. What it does, it does very well. Recommended, but probably not worth the money.

a - deboxed, unwrapped, and popped the bottle. brew poured a crimson caramel plum with a finger full of cream colored head that exactly matched the color of the beer's label. the coloring was a dark core with shiny tints of maroon along the edge of the glass. deep, dark, ominous...
s - oh joy. smells like heaven. wonderful malty english barleywine with great barrel aged shine. plums, raisins, figs with some light vineous qualities.
t - just as the nose suggests...big dark fruit from the plum and raisin family soaked in oak. the wood brings along some alcoholic heat, but also carries very strong vanilla oak characteristics with a hint of caramel. reminds me more of an anniversary brew than last year's abacus. as it warmed, a lot of chocolate characteristics started to show. interesting and tasty.
m - surprisingly not as heavy as i remembered. the booze is there in full affect, but more white wine like and softer. easy drinker, but the heat is on. very silky. feels fantastic...almost juice like but thinner.
o - overall, a solid offering, but not as wonderful as i remembered, but still an amazing beer. since last year's batch many other big players have emerged in the barrel aged barleywine space and although i'm sure this one still holds a spot in the top 5 or 10, it is not the top spot. granted this is a different year and there will always be variation from year to year. i look forward to trying this side-by-side with last years. 1,670 characterscosmicevan, Apr 27, 2012

T- Fruit and bourbon forward. Big dark fruits and booze up front followed up by waves of toffee/caramel, toasted coconut, and sugary sweetness. More bourbon and buttery sweetness as it warms.
M- Slick and oily with minimal but adequate carb.
O- A year has definitely changed this brew. Much smoother and more drinkable than fresh with better flavor integration. Much less heat than fresh. Great brew. 717 charactersstxSS07, Apr 26, 2012

Appearance: Pours a reddish amber color with a layer of off white head that goes away completely as the beer sits.
Smell: This is a sweet one with some vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit and caramel notes. There is some warmth that you pick up when you smell it.
Taste: Lots of vanilla from the barrel along with bourbon, raisins, and caramel. The beer is a bit hot, but this is a fresh bottle, so I was expecting as much. Even with the head, it's still a pretty smooth drinker.
Mouthfeel: Medium to slightly thick body with tingly carbonation and a slick finish.
Overall: Very sweet and smooth. The notes from the barrel are very nice. This is a delicious beer and I would be happy to have another. 736 charactersoline73, Apr 25, 2012

Taste: Much like the nose this one is full of dark fruit lots of raisin and figs and some plum. Mid palate is nice amount of american oak and caramel and toffee. The beer finishes with some nice bourbon
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body and low carbonation a bit syrupy and sticky
Overall: I have had this beer several times and decided not to review this one until the blind tasting. I remember enjoying this one much more on draft and before the blind tasting. For me this one finished in the middle of the pack. Still a damn good beer and I will drink this every chance I get. 835 charactersDarthKostrizer, Apr 23, 2012

A- Pours a dark brownish red mahogany, about a quarter finger of foamy beige head, about average carbonation, slightly translucent but on the dark side.
S- Strong sweet smell of honey, a little bit of wine, molasses, rum, and some mixed fruits. One of the stronger smelling beers I've encountered.
T- A nice strong sweet taste of honey, molasses, rum mixed with a dark wine, and a mixture of dark fruits.
M- Heavy. Nice and creamy and a little bit syrupy. ABV very well hidden.
O- This was a very good Barleywine. I like Barleywines, but they've never been my favorite. Like most Barleywines this beer was a little bit too sweet and syrupy for my liking. That aside, this beer had a great taste and smell. The alcohol was very well hidden and mixed well with the beer. In a lot of barleywines the alcohol has too much of a burning taste that ruins the flavor, this is not the case in abacus. One of the best barleywines I've had, definitely recommended if you are a barleywine fan. 999 charactersjaasen64, Apr 22, 2012

Pours deep maroon with a small off-white head leaving some lacing.
Some sweet burnt toffee in the aroma along with heavy barrel presence. A lot of oak, vanilla and general boozy sweetness.
Heavy toffee and barrel presence in the flavor as well. Some earthy hops peak in, but this one is malty. Still pretty hot even after a year.
Booze is not hidden well. Good body and carbonation though.
Maybe KH has raised my standard for this style, but I thought this was awful. A hot boozy. 505 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 16, 2012

Reserve Series 2012 No. 002
Big thanks to MarkVegas for sending this one over in a trade
A: Pours an opaque very dark brown with only the slightest light tan colored head, it actually very much resembles a slightly darker coke cola.  When poured out it has a soda like fizziness, which I don't recall ever experiencing in a beer.  Strange. The head that is present dissipates almost immediately and leaves zero lacing.   
S: The bourbon aroma smacks you in the face as soon as you pick this one up. Bourbon, oak, dark fruits (fig and raisin), some booze.  This aroma reminds me of why I love barleywines.  Awesome. 
T: Like the nose, the taste starts off with a big bourbon punch, with coffee and cocoa notes on the back end.  I also get oak, black licorice, and roasted malts. The chocolate and coffee presence is bigger than most examples of the style.  Dark fruits try to come out but are masked by the (you guessed it) bourbon presence, although I do get some raisin and a hint of fig .  I've had glasses of bourbon with weaker bourbon profiles than this. There is a decent alcohol presence, but it acts as a balancing agent and is not overwhelming.  This beer didn't come off as hot to me, at all. What a complex palate profile.  Very nice.  
M/D: Warms the body quite impressively, so don't drink this on a hot summers day.  On the full side of medium bodied,  feels thicker than it pours, moderately low carbonation and a very chewy mouth feel.  ABV was present but well restrained.  Drinkable, but certainly a sipper as it took me quite some time to finish this.  Take your time and enjoy (and have a DD handy, as this one went straight to my head).  
O: What can I say, I'm a sucker for barleywines, and I love this one.  If you like the style, go get this, now.  If you don't like the style, or dislike bourbon, it may be  best to stay away cause this is one big,bourbon heavy, barleywine.  Awesome brew.  Again, a big thanks to MarkVegas for talking me into expanding our trade to include this.   2,072 characterszac16125, Apr 16, 2012

A: Pours a rich, red-tinged black with a small white head. Minor lacing but surprisingly good retention.
S: Barrel shows up big in the nose. Hot, sweet liquor, vanilla bean, raisins, vinous grape, a bit of oak, figgy bread.
T: Pretty hot fresh, but nice and complex. Fig, milky chocolate, mushy raisin, dark grains, nutmeg, caramel, faint hop leaf, quickly overtaken by oaky vanilla and a spike of solvent alcohol. A bit of a burn in the throat as it goes down. Vanilla and some dark fruits in the finish.
M: Very soft body and carbonation.
O: Very complex and smooth, definitely up there with the best. 679 charactersEtan, Apr 16, 2012

Pours a dark reddish/brown with a slight haze to it. Small beige head turns to a ring after a bit and stays that way. Fine considering the beer.
Nice scent bringing lot of barley wine and barrel elements with other notes of goodness. Dark fruits come through the most, along with caramel, chocolate, bourbon, oak, light tobacco and alcohol.
Taste is similar to the scent, pretty great, but really brings on the booziness. Nice balance of dark fruits, roasted malt, caramel, cocoa and bourbon with a light hop presence as well. Great flavors somewhat masked by huge alcohol and big sweetness as well.
Good, slick mouthfeel, well-carbonated leaning towards the higher side, assaulting booze.
Nice but a bit disappointed with how boozy it was, this might fare better with some age on it. 928 charactersChico1985, Apr 13, 2012

A: Sucaba pours with a wonderful frothy light brown (think milk chocolate) head that is average in size (about 1 finger). It's head diminishes without staying around long at all. There is some lacing but does not stick to the glass very long. The color is murky brown to ruby red on the edges and bottom upon holding it up to the light. 
S: Maple sweetness, vanilla, toasted oak, tobacco, and lots of bourbon. Wow lots going on here in the aroma. Next I get the dark fruits like raisin, plum and maybe some dark cherry. The sweetness is evident and wonderful. Brown sugar and toffee come to mind next. Lastly I do pick up some tobacco.
T: The taste does not disappoint and follows the nose like I was hoping! I first taste a wonderful combination of bourbon and sweetness that intermingle in perfect harmony together. The dark fruits (plum, raisin, prune and date) take center stage and then the vanilla and oak make their appearence. I must mention the alcohol is very much there and warms and stings the mouth and tongue urging me to take another sip!
M: This is medium on the palate but just right in my opinion. It is alcoholic like I mentioned in the taste but just awesome. Sticky comes to mind as I continue to sip as it does coat my mouth nicely. This allows the flavor to linger for a looong time and I'm lovin every minute of it.
O: King Henry is one of my favorite beers and let me tell you I'll take Sucaba as a decent substitute for the never brewed again King. This has shot to the top of my list of all time favorite sipping beers, but it is so hard to just sip this one. 1,615 characterssleuthdog, Apr 10, 2012

Appearance - dark brown, almost opaque, bottle says dark ruby, but I didn't see any red hues. Thick, 1 finger head in a Sam Adams glass, not too much carbonation
Taste - tons of maple and vanilla, a bit nutty, very similar to smell, some sips had some alcohol in the back of the nose
Mouthfeel - very smooth, full bodied
Overall - loved this beer, their barrels are magical. Only complaint was the boozyness that came through on a couple of sips, it was probably imagined. 535 charactersparris, Apr 10, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured a dark brown, almost black body with minimal lace patches. I pick up figs, barley, roasted malt at first sniff for some reason, a woodiness as well (I guess oak really), some sweet sugary and chocolatey malts as well as a pinch of dark fruit. A plethora of maltiness in as much as this is a thicker, fuller body that borders on syrupy stickiness at times. A bready/woodiness and some roasted malts balance real well with chocolate, careamel, vanilla even a touch of toffee (I think). Can't really say any hop or fruit notes come out, so it's more of just a malt beer so to say. Perhaps the stunner was the 12+ ABV% b/c they really hide it well other than that nice high and dry finish. A little pricey and def a sipper but worth a try by anyone. 752 charactersclayrock81, Apr 06, 2012

Pours a deep ruby amber with a half-finger off-white head that quickly reduces to a very thin foam ring. Aromas of sweet dark fruit especially black cherry, oak, bourbon booziness, and toffee rises from the glass. Bourbon greets the tastebuds joined by a bit of sweet fig, plum, and caramel, finishing with tones of bourbon warmth and oak. Wonderful mouthfeel. Full syrupy body coats the mouth with silky smoothness. One of the top barrel-aged English barleywines available. A "must purchase" annually. 604 characterschanokokoro, Apr 06, 2012

S - Bourbon, oak, candied plum and raisins, roasted toffee and caramel. Sweet malt and bourbon forward. 
T - The taste is intoxicating (literally). Up front is a hit of sweet roasted malt followed with a wave of dark fruit - raisons, plums, and layers of oak, bourbon, and vanilla. As I dig deeper into the glass, the oak comes through with more strength and the alcohol warmth subsides a little bit. In the beginning, the warming in the throat is very noticeable until things adjust. There's a hint of hop bitterness at the very end of the sip
M - Medium full body, somewhat thick, and leaves a sticky coating on the lips.

A - Ruby color with an off-white head that moves on to thick lacing. Sticks very well to the glass.
S - Sweet malts, some spice and almost a dark fruit note emerging. Only a slight note of oak in end (I may be imagining it).
T - Sweet malts smoothly transition into the barrel notes. Oak, toffee, then dry oak. The finish has a sweetness to it as well. Some heat comes through far into the finish. Some raisin/plum comes out in the middle. Bits of vanilla can be picked out as well once it gets coated on the tongue. Pretty smooth all around with the exception of the feeling on the throat.
M - Medium body, pretty nice for the style.
O - The aroma doesn't show much, if anything, of the barrel. Instead it provides a lot of malts. The flavor is mellow and nice, but lacks complexity until the finish. The finish is still a little bit hot. If you have some left, drink it. 953 charactersclaaark13, Apr 05, 2012

S- Smells boozey more than anything to me. Getting some hints of dark fruits as well. 
T- Wow, really unlike any barleywine I've had. First off is the caramel and dark fruit notes. Then comes the slight notes of hop character. The barrel-aging really shines in the taste, with great oak notes. This drinks very hot fresh, with an overly boozey presence which I like. 
M- A great sipper. Definitely boozey, each sip leaves a warming alcohol feeling, especially as the beer comes closer to room temperature.
Awesome stuff, always impressed with FW beers. I'm glad I got to try this, and would be interested to get my hands on a bottle to see what some age does to this one. 1,018 charactersvic21234, Apr 03, 2012

S: Vanilla, oak, some EtOH, toffee. A nice melange of these and more.
T: Sublime and superb. Like the nose, vanilla and oak are present for sure. Hefty doses of rich toffee and caramel as well. Rich malt present. Some brown sugar present too. Dark fruits/dates/raisins come through as well. Flavors meld together seamlessly as the beer warms. I am loving this for sure. The only knock against it for me is that the alcohol is still just a little bit too evident in the finish for my personal liking. 
M: Silky and smooth....dangerously so. A little on the sticky side too (if that is possible given the previous 2 elements described?) I divided my bomber up into 1/3'rds so that I could sip it and truly appreciate it. The 12.5% is deceptive to a degree but, as I said before, can still be detected in the finish (a little too much so for me)
Overall, I love this beer. Definitely amongst my personal elite. I am discovering that I have a penchant for English Barleywines and this one absolutely lives up to the hype. I hope to be able to get more and will do so as often as I possibly can. I want to see what some age will do to/for the alcohol component in the other bottle that I have aging presently. Highly recommended.
NOTE 6/13/13: I aged a 2012 for a year and it's much less hot and boozy now. The aging did wonders for it. Awesome! 1,558 charactersbcostner1, Apr 03, 2012

4.68/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As it says on the label, it pours a dark ruby color, beautiful and deep, almost opaque until you look at it through a light, which gives it that dark ruby glow. Tight and silky khaki head on top that dissapates to a thin sheet leaving spotty lacing. Comes in a cool collectible box so that suckered the appearance up to a 5 for me. Deep and bourbanesque nose with some toasty booze-soaked oak aromas coming up through the grainish caramelly malts. Lighter hints of raisins and vanilla come through, as well as a hint of earthy hops, rounding out a very nice nose. The vanilla and booze come out more as it warms. 
Lots of complex flavors going on in this one, all of which are very tasty. A lot of the aromas translate very well to the taste, with the barrel aging playing a big part in imparting some whiskey-like flavors and a toasty oaky vanilla flavor that is addicting. That combined with hints of raisins and figs that are not quite juicy, but definitely not dry either, create a satisfying mouthfeel that complements the amazing flavors. Caramelly malts are there in the background, giving a great backbone to this monster of a barleywine. These malts are definitely noteworthy, but outshined by the sheer boozy weight of this beer. This booziness is very close to fantastic in short. It's not cloying at all, and although it's remeniscent of mid-grade whiskey, it doesn't leave very much to be desired. Granted, not nearly as boozy as a straight shot of whiskey, but it does add a certain satisfying burn to the feel, followed by a breath of the booze as well. The only reason the taste isn't a 5 for me is because the aftertaste/afterfeel is that of a cheaper whiskey. If I could give the taste a 4.7, I would because it is so well-rounded for what it is. The hops in this one are almost outshined by the fruit and whiskey qualities, but should not be counted out because they are about as present as the sweetness of the malts and hints of vanilla and raisins. They add that last touch of earthiness to the beer to bring the alcohol down to a well-balanced, albeit very present, state. The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth despite the prickle of the alcohol and slight burn that it brings. 
This beer is pretty amazing and complex, all things considered. Smooth but prickly, sweet and yet dry, boozy and yet balanced in its own way. Even a touch fruity. This is the kind of beer that makes me want to brew a barleywine and barrel age it. This beer is huge and not for all, but if you appreciate a good whiskey, bourbon or even scotch, then give this a shot. Its definitely one of the best barleywines I've had. I wish I had bought at least two bottles, leaving one to age and see what it would be like in a year or two. But I couldn't imagine it being much better than it is now. Great beer, pick at least two bottles up if you see it! 2,847 charactersRschis16, Apr 02, 2012

4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 vintage (the last one called Abacus). Poured into a tulip.
Pours very deep amber. Looks like a typical barleywine on its way out of the bottle, but becomes nearly opaque in the glass. With light behind it, that same rusty amber re-appears. Half a finger of cream-colored head, gone fast, little lacing.
Has that amazing richness, warmth, and sweetness that good barrel-aged barleywines have, but there's something more here. The higher, sharper notes of the bourbon blend smoothly into the big fruity malt base. Plums, cherries, and other dark fruits abound. Vanilla oak notes float above it. Divine. One of those beers that made me say "wow" at first sniff.
Taste is much like the smell, only with some slightly sharper edges. Loads of dark fruits, dates more prominent here. Again it's quite oaky, with an impressively smooth bourbon twist throughout. Delicious, and amazingly mellow for such a big strong beer.
Mouthfeel is excellent. Heavy and sticky, but with more carbonation than I often find in barleywines. That fizz keeps the flavors moving, allowing me to savor them even more.
To date, the best barleywine I've had. Looking forward to drinking a few other bottles I have on deck to compare to it (King Henry, Mother of All Storms), but if they're better than this, I will be thoroughly impressed. I don't generally like barrel-aged beers, but I could drink this stuff for days (if it weren't 13%... is it really 13%? I get no alcohol burn at all). I need to get myself some more of this. 1,509 characterszeledonia, Apr 01, 2012

A powerful plum-bourbon smell arose from the bottle.
Poured in a tulip, the color was a light-brown with hops noticeable on the top. The mouth feel was mild- suitable for a strong alcohol presence, which at 13% is a bit overwhelming.
The finish was a marvelous blend of alcohol, plum, and a fusing of bourbon from the casks. The plum-bourbon finish improves with warming. 
I was looking forward to drinking this great beer. 
Drink this beer warm- it's the only way to fully experience its subtle intertwining of flavors. 569 charactersbrureview, Mar 31, 2012

Pours a very dark red brown with a light head and minimal lacing. Very nice aroma of bourbon, malt and oak. Flavor follows with malts, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, oaky middle and boozy oaky bourbon finish that melds all the flavors together. Very nicely done. The booze is a little assertive, but I think this will be superb if aging tones down the alcohol. Still delicious and very well made. 460 charactersLiquidAmber, Mar 29, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 2. 22oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours a murky, deep mahogany color. There is minimal foam produced, even from a strong pour. A thin ring does form around the edges of the glass but it doesn't hang around very long. 
There is a ton going on in the nose here. And it's strong too. Nice bourbon up front. Really big, but not harsh. There is a huge sweetness, caramel and toffee, almost candy-like. Some light oak and vanilla come through. All the aromas are very well integrated and provide a pretty complex experience.
The taste is equally exceptional as the nose. Very nice bourbon that actually seems a bit more mellow than in the nose, which is unexpected, but not necessarily a bad thing. Some brown sugar is added to the caramel and toffee mix pushing the sweetness about as far as it can go without being unpleasant. The oak and vanilla go hand in hand here as well but they are drawn out a bit more, especially as the beer warms. There is a nice, pleasant warming at the back of the throat with each sip.
The body is huge. Thick and viscous, almost chewy at times. Very low carbonation combined with the body make the beer feel enormous. 
This is an excellent barrel aged barleywine. Huge flavors and aromas that are intertwined so that nothing becomes overwhelming and nothing gets lost in the shuffle. Everything seems carefully balanced. I felt the same way about the original bottle (Abacus) when fresh and not so much a couple weeks ago when I had a second bottle. After having this fresh again so close to the aged bottle it makes me realize that the balance is so good when fresh that aging it might not do it any good. 1,648 charactersms11781, Mar 29, 2012

A: Deep brown and red pour with a smallish tan head. Fades quickly, leaving only dots of lacing here and there. 
S: Intense bourbon aroma up front. Stinging alcohol. Tons of toffee, molasses, brown sugar and caramel with a distinctive oaky vanilla. Perhaps a touch of fig underneath it all. Very big aroma in general.
T: Not nearly as bourbon heavy as I expected (thankfully). Wow there is a lot going on here. Up front there is some stinging bourbon with heavy toffee and oak. Then it sweetens out with lots of caramel and brown sugar. Touch of cocoa in the middle brings just a bit of bitterness. Lingering booze with figs and perhaps dates (perhaps even cherries?) in the aftertaste. 
M: Big, thick, syrupy, smooth with a decent bite from the bourbon. At the same time, not too hot.
O: Wow, is all I can say. This is a big bourbon and malt extravaganza. It's boozy, sweet, complex yet surprisingly balanced. I thought the bourbon would overpower it from the smell but it does not, it just compliments all the flavors nicely. By far the best english barleywine I've had. 1,098 charactersDope, Mar 28, 2012

A: pours brown so dark you can only tell it's brown by holding it up to the light with a minimal head that refreshes with each sip. 
S: smell is straight bourbon sweetness and all the oak, brown sugar, and some of the alcohol that comes with it. Slight cardboard smell worried me a bit. 
T: bourbon again, with vanilla, oak, sweetness, and even some slight malt taste and dark fruits. 
M: silky smooth with medium-light carbonation and a medium-heavy body. Great feeling. 
O: great beer overall, and the barrel aging no doubt added to the beer. I'm curious to see how it ages even though the consensus is that one should drink it fresh. ~$15 per bottle. 690 charactersHolland, Mar 28, 2012

S: Rich, Bourbon, Sweet, Malty, not much hops
T: This was my first real experience with a barley wine that isn't hoppy. I was hopping for something that had a backbone to back up the sweet, boosy, bourbon barrel aged flavor. Not the case with this one. Tasted a lot like a bourbon BA stout. Maybe this is just my vigrin taste buds to this style, but I thought it could have had a little more hop presence to round it out and still remain in the bounderies of English Barleywine.
M: Thick, Smooth, low carbonation

It pours a dark reddish brown with a fizzy but foamy tan head that actually sticks for a little bit and then recedes with no lacing.
The smell is great. Boozy and boubony, I am beginning to like hotter beers with more of a bourbon kick. This one has an ample malt and barelywine backing though, a ton of dark fruit, rich malt flavors, and a bit of hops shine through. The yeast character is indeed English giving it a profile that isn't often had in big BA barleywines, usually they are more american yeast tinged.
This one is really thick, wow. It has a good vanilla, coconut, and oak vibe that is the main hit I am getting. Instead of boozy this one is as velvety smooth as it gets at first sip. The sweetness is never too cloying but it creeps up with the alcohol as you go. Nice hop, tobacco, and dark fruit flavors as well as a great malt bill. The bourbon itself is readily noticeable lending a spirit-like vibe.
This is an exhibition of how to make a bourbon aged beer. 1,007 characterscrossovert, Mar 26, 2012

Reserve series 2011/No. 001
Served in a snifter
The liquid poured a slightly oily, dark and cloudy, crimson-mahogany color. It actually looked a bit murky and flat in the glass. A thin film of tan colored bubbles coated the liquid. The crown quickly dissipated to a clingy ring of froth.
The aroma was quite impressive. Sweet and boozy. Bourbon notes came through strong. Lots of caramel, toffee and brown sugar. Good amount of vanilla. Some coconut. Dark fruits were also noticeable. Raisins and plums were most apparent. A touch oaky.
On the front end, the flavor profile was quite similar to the nose. Rich caramel and toffee notes dominated. Lots of vanilla. Strong dose of raisins and dark fruits. Somewhat nutty in the center. The beer turned sharper and less flavorful as it moved along the palate. It finished quite hot with an excessive amount of oak and tannins. Slight metallic notes were also detectible. Overall, a bit disappointing.
The mouthfeel was frothy, creamy and smooth, yet much thinner than I was anticipating for the style. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence. As the beer sat, it lost a good amount of carbonation. Toward the end of the glass, the liquid was nearly flat.
§ucaba (Abacus) is a respectable English Barleywine style ale, but it definitely does not live up to the hype surrounding it. Perhaps a bit more aging would help smooth out some of its rough edges. 1,467 charactersDamian, Mar 25, 2012

A- Dark brown hue into a pint glass with ruby red around the edges. Light tan head forms with a creamy texture and decent retention. Lace is hard to come by but there are a few spots.
S- Smooth for a 12.5% barrel aged Barleywine. Complex mix of caramel malt, butter, mellowed bourbon vanilla oak, roast cocoa malt hints, cherry dark fruit and brown sugar sweets.
T- A bit darker here, the chocolate and roast hints come through. Smooth balance of oak barrel, whiskey, brandy? something like plum dark fruit, caramel, raisin and vanilla. The oak and caramel are what keep coming back to my palate.
MF- Creamy feel to a nice full body. Carbonation is moderate and there is a definite alcohol warmth. 716 characterscbutova, Mar 23, 2012
3.11/5  rDev -30.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3Served on-draught into a snifter at Firestone Walker's taproom in Paso Robles (NOT tasting room) on its grand opening day. This was my first beer there as I was really excited to try it given its reputation. Reviewed from notes. 
A: Pours no head at all. Not even a floater about the edges. Colour is a murky dark caramel brown-black; maybe black cherry (though that makes it sound far more appealing than it is). Not horribly appealing. 
Sm: Fruit esters - perhaps cherry. Mulled wine, spice, a bit of vinegar, and fresh yeast. An attractive aroma. Mild in strength. 
T: Black cherry alongside almond, alcohol, caramelized malt, and other clean malts. Decently balanced but far from impressive. Decently built, but nothing to write home about. How did this beer get such a good reputation? Very strange as a barleywine, and not in a good or experimental way. Warm alcohol comes through. Neither complex nor subtle. 
Mf: Smooth and wet, suiting the flavours okay. Far from good. Not tailored to the flavours by any stretch. Way too thin for the style. Fails to adequately support the flavours. 
Dr: Drinkable but not exceptional. Hardly hides its ABV at all. I expected far better given its reputation. I wouldn't have it again. People pay $20.00 a bottle for this? Trade your bottles away, lads. Get something worth your time. 
I really hope this gets better with age. This isn't worth seeking out. As a fan of barleywines, I'm very disappointed.

A: pours beautiful and dark dark brown, almost amber brown hues can be seen around the edges when the glass is held to a light. Nice almost finger with a off white caramely-brown head that dissapates nicley and leaves a bit of lacing, looks deep dark and sticky!
S- Very deep, and alluring , I detect some burbon right off, but it is not as dominant as I expected, but rather a nice blend with all the other aromas, chocolate, toasty vanilla, hints of caramel, a faint touch of smoke... Dark cherry, alcohol, so complex... 
T- just as amazingly complex... If not even more so then the nose. It Seems here that the burbon steps out a bit further then it did in the nose, blending with caramel and toasty vanilla. To me it progresses like this, dark caramel/toffee into a toasty vanilla, with a you h ooze and dark cherry on the finish. A nice warm roasty oak comes through in the middle with the vanilla leaving an almost coconut note as the warming alcohol kicks in. I could go on for days.... Phenomonial
M- medium bodies with lower carbonation, bit not as sticky and syrupy as inexpected... In a good way.... Finishes dry, velvety and slightly viscous. For what it is I feel as though this beer, as much as it is a sipper is incredibly drinkable.

Also, the head is well-formed. Head does die down but still manages to retain most of its former glory. Plentiful amounts of lacing...
S-The bourbon is extremely pronounced. Oak, vanilla, and plenty of sweet additions a la caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and liqueur-dipped fruitiness. A very strong nose. Alcohol is more than evident. Extremely aromatic. Sweet, ultra-complex, and downright enticing.
T-My lord what a delicious flavor. As if someone dipped the richest caramel into a vat of Pappy Van Winkle. The flavor is very concentrated. Oak and vanilla extract. Just such a rich, loaded flavor. It is exceptionally enjoyable. The barrel-aging has made this brew a masterpiece.
M-Big, luscious body. Carbonation is mild. Alcohol is drying, akin to a liqueur. Sweet and creamy. Great feel. Body matches the flavor.

Pours clear dark brown, with serious purple-red streaks in the light. A light tan head forms from very tiny bubbles that leave no lacing, but that's no surprise at 12.5%.
Smell is bourbon right off the bat, rich, a bit of vanilla, smoky wood, some deep malt hidden in there, with some booze, and a touch of leather.
Flavor is huge, with some sweet caramel malt, wood, hint vanilla, and a bourbony finish.
Feels velvety smooth with a touch of alcohol burn, appropriate for this beer. It's almost thick and viscous, and warms my stomach as I progress.
Almost all bourbon on the nose, but more subtle in the flavor. Great balance and an awesome beer. Perhaps this should be shared, as a bottle to myself made me sleepy, and gave me lingering effects the next day.

Aroma is thick and rich, intoxicating alone. Vanilla, wild berries, caramel goodness all blanketed with restrained bourbon. A dessert sipper.
Delicious. The sweet dark fruits, toffee and caramel dabbed with vanilla the again wonderfully restrained bourbon. Alcohol is obvious but not hot. Aftertaste slowly fades away pleasantly away, a strength of this brew. Great depth. Full bodied chewy mouthfeel.

Aromas of bourbon and vanilla combine to form a most incredibly rich caramel, with notes of oak and alcohol.

M: Medium to full bodied with low to moderate amounts of carbonation. Very smooth.
O: This beer has an inviting aroma and is delicious as well as incredibly smooth - it gets better with each sip and I was just hoping the glass would never end.

4.27/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 vintage served at cellar temp into a goblet.
Abacus is a deep brown color with ruby highlights. It has good clarity but the head settles almost instantly. Just a skim layer is left behind.
Aroma is instantly impressive with great bourbon barrel aging character coming through. Lots of vanilla and bourbon but the barley wine isn't completely lost.
Flavor is equally huge. It starts with the sweetness of the bourbon and the vanilla and caramel that comes with it. Towards the middle, I start to get the barley wine with that big hop bitterness. It ends with a drying alcohol that isn't hot but is certainly noticeable. 
Mouthfeel is totally smooth, medium to full in body, and nicely balanced in flavors.
Overall a totally impressive beer. 749 charactersGilGarp, Mar 12, 2012
4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: The beer is very dark reddish brown in color. It poured with a thin beige ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass and a small patch of bubbles in the center.
S: There are moderately strong aromas of bourbon, oak toffee and vanilla in the nose.
T: Similar to the smell, the taste is somewhat sweet and has complex flavors of bourbon, caramel, toffee and vanilla.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and smooth on the palate and has some hints of stickiness. There is a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This is a great beer to sip because it continually keeps your taste buds interested due to its complex flavors. It definitely tastes quite strong but the alcohol does not detract from the taste. 704 charactersmetter98, Mar 12, 2012

Reviewed 3/4/12
Note: Batch 001 (2011)
Appearance: Deep brown with a touch of ruby - pretty clear, actually - off-white head, fades to a ring, minimally spotty lacing
Smell: An interesting array of malts, sweet maltiness, caramel, burnt sugar, toffee - lots of wood, but not an excessive amount - some bourbon, vanilla, alcohol 
Taste: Cooked, caramelized, slightly roasted malt - some toffee, a nice amount of sweetness - dry chocolate, with a touch of vanilla and bourbon flavors - the wood is more apparent in the taste - oak, but not in excess - some straight-up alcohol - gets better as it warms, as it should 
Mouthfeel: A bit thin for what I want in a barleywine, but I suppose it is unfair to compare this English style to an American barleywine - slightly chewy, very smooth, nicely carbonated
Overall: Regardless of the name, this is solid 
Abacus is nicely balanced, with some nice sweetness, wood, alcohol, and cooked malts. It's not exactly what I want in a barleywine, but for the English style, it's great. 1,070 charactersangrybabboon, Mar 11, 2012

2012 vintage.
Pours a deep burgundy red with a light toffee colored head.
The aroma is of bourbon, vanilla and oak, predominately.
Starts with more oak, some caramel and toffee followed by some soft chocolate notes and finishes with a fair bit of bourbon.
A medium body with soft carbonation. Leaves a moderate boozy, warming sensation.
A really well done English barleywine. Definitely quite bourbon and barrel forward. With that said though, the bourbon is not overly hot or over-whelming. 528 charactersvkv822, Mar 11, 2012

Looks pretty dark, reddish when held up to light. Light off white head that dissipates to a ring for awhile then disappears forever. 
Smell is a bourbon bomb. Vanilla comes through but mostly boozy, bourbon whiskey. 
Taste is bourbon, booze, heat, bourbon, bourbon, vanilla, bourbon, caramel and some malt. Did I mention Bourbon?
Mouthfeel is ok, a bit thin I think. Not as sticky as I would have liked. 
Overall this is good if you like the fresh heat and very prominent bourbon taste. Look forward to stashing one for a year or two 563 charactersvivasbeer, Mar 11, 2012

Dark amber. Clear. Smallish head and no real lacing.

Flavor is heavy on the barrel notes, which are fantastic--heavy char, vanilla and bourbon. Sweet toffee, caramel and light chocolate also evident. Smooth and a bit boozy in the finish, but not overwhelmingly so.
Medium body. Creamy. Lightly carbonated.
Firestone Walker sure knows their barrels. This is a great beer. 456 charactersmusicforairports, Mar 10, 2012

A- Deep mahogany/ dark brown. Really rich color with a head that dissipates to near minimal but then holds around the rim. The color show barrel aging for sure
S-I know this beer is aged in a numerous amount of barrels with different uses, but I get so much bourbon off this. I get oak and toffee and sweet luscious booze.
M-Creamy. The barrel aging real does this beer great. It feels so great going down and leaves a fantastic mouthfeel afterwards. The body lingers in the mouth for minutes afterwards. 
T- Still a little cold the taste is good. Gets a hit of booze off the beginning and finishes heavily oaked with vanilla, a that toffee comes through as well. A really great English barley wine. No hop presence. The barrel aging is allowed to shine through. the maltiness is present and give a sweet finish.
O-A great barrel aged barley wine. FW does it right and does it again. Good job. Will try and pick up another bottle for cellaring. I think the booze may very well drop off and the barrel aging shine through. Hope to have one again soon. 1,138 charactersBrewsoBrewco, Mar 09, 2012

Deep mahogany. Minimal head dies quickly.
Heavily fortified nose of stewed plums, toffee, and muscatels. Barrel notes are not particularly evident.
Now the barrel character comes through strongly, bringing vanilla, coconut and bourbon to join all the malty characteristics in the nose. Great stuff.
Appropriately syrupy and full, marred slightly by a touch of booze heat.
Feel slightly guilty for reviewing this based on such a small sample, as I needed a lot more to break down the flavours, but have previously enjoyed a bottle 0f 2011 Abacus with others and this certainly aligned with my memory. A barleywine with fantastic flavours that is very good fresh. 727 charactersspicelab, Mar 06, 2012

Appearance: Deep ruby/ruddy brown. Head is minimal and khaki. Carbonation is still present. Depth of color is impressive. 
Smell: Rich roasted malts with caramel, toffee, and a strong sweetness. Hints of vanilla, oak, and brown sugar. Bourbon and booze. Crazy depth to the aroma. Sweet in good measure. Nice balance.
Taste: Toffee with a nice doughy malt base. Caramel and vanilla add a good kind of sweetness. Booze hits on the back and adds a lingering heat and dryness. Big cooked sugar flavors. Malts are huge and bring bread dough, crust, and caramel sweetness to the party. Brown sugar. Loads of malt complexity.
Mouthfeel: Moderate body with a nice carbonation. Feels a little thin at times but I chalk it up to the barrels. Leaves a lingering dryness from the alcohol.
Overall: A very well-crafted take on the style. The barrels really highlight the malts and allow the sweetness to blend with with flavors produced by the barrels. Very solid and clean. 976 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Mar 04, 2012

Poured into a brandy snifter.
Reddish, mahogany body. Thin cream colored head that quickly fizzles away. Translucent to the light.
Smells of potent, caramelized sugars and light bourbon. Good amount of oaky, barrel-aged tannin quality. Very sweet smelling– vanilla and milk chocolate. Some smokiness, like fresh leather too. Very awesome.
Opens equally as good. Sugary sweet but not cloying, minimally boozy, and hits of bourbon towards the end. Light bodied with small amount of carbonation. Leaves a nice warmth and bitterness on the palate as it finishes off. Well-rounded in flavors. Balanced between sweet, boozy and bitter. A fine-tuned, barrel-aged barleywine, for sure.
The barrel program at FSW is absolutely incredible. Both Abacus and Parabola are immensely delicious. Very glad to have tried this offering from them. It's definitely up there as one of my favorite barleywines. 932 charactersinfi, Mar 04, 2012

Beer poured a reddish-brown with some head that quickly went away.
Nose is a little boozy with some oak, vanilla, and some hints of chocolate - quite nice!
Taste was hugely warming upon initial sip. Flavors picked up include chocolate, vanilla, light bourbon, and some raisins. The finish is very clean and not cloying at all.
Mouthfeel is full viscosity which helps make this brew satisfying for me. It is pretty smooth as well.

Color is dark ruby as described, with little semblance of any head and no lacing. Little darker than I'd prefer from a barleywine, but still very rich in color.
Smell from the bottle is all bourbon and oak, with some cookie thrown in for good measure. In the glass the heat and bourbon are more prevalent, but there is lots more going on here. With time, more maple and cookie flavors develop, with vanilla being the dominant characteristic. Smells amazing with each sip.
The flavor that follows is intense caramel malt, with plenty of toffee, oak, maple, and vanilla to back it up. Some fruitiness is present in the finish that counteracts the heat quite nicely. Hop flavor is non-existent but some faint bitterness is present. Nice balance, amazing flavor. With warmth, the vanilla comes out in full force. I'm typically no fan of vanilla flavor in beer, but it's well balanced, and presented here as more of a vanilla one would experience in a red wine. Masterfully done and always welcome.
Overall, this is a beer that every craft beer fan should try if given the opportunity. Firestone Walker really sets the bar with their barrel fermenting/aging profile, and they are certainly masters of their craft. 1,315 charactersmorningthief, Feb 26, 2012

A. Pours a cloudy, dark ruby brown. A quarter finger of light brown head quickly dissipates to a dusting around the edges. Faint lacing. 
S. Excellent. One of the top examples for style. Ripe plum, cherry, dark fruit, and some raisin. Fairly assertive vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Little bit of chocolate in there as well. 
T. Chocolate, oak, bourbon, vanilla. Ripe fruit is a little more subdued in the flavor profile. The barrel is very assertive right now, with the wood and char dominating. Very very good, but I suspect this will improve with a few more months on it. 
M. Smooth and silky. Quite a bit of heat and barrel character that needs to be evened out. Full bodied, light moderate carbonation. 
O. It's doesnt eclipse Mother of All Storms and I wont do it the disservice of comparing it to King Henry, which is really a stout as opposed to a barleywine, but Sucaba is one of the very best barleywines out there. It is hot and rife with barrel out of the box, but I am eager to see what age does to this. Excellent now, could be ridiculous later. One of my very favorites. 1,100 characterssiege06nd, Feb 26, 2012

T + M: Big and sweet... flavor is quite rich, and full of the same dark fruits that were noted in the nose. Body is big and chewy. Some nice, spicy notes from the alcohol content, blending in quite nicely with the malty, caramel sweetness and fruit flavors.

I've left my comments for the original batch below. I tried approximately 18 bottles of it from release to September 2011, and I decided I do not like how this beer ages. Yes, you could make the argument that it hasn't finished aging, but since it fell off so quickly, I don't anticipate the trend reversing. On a general note, I don't think most barrel-aged beers need age, and I've found that Firestone Walker beers have nowhere to go but down, so this is how I've reached my conclusion. 
That being said, batch 1 was spectacular fresh, so I picked up a couple of bottles of batch 2 to consume immediately. 
A: The body is a clear chestnut color, though in the center of the glass it darkens and becomes murky. The head is a half-pinky finger of tan head that collapses quickly into a thin collar. 
S: Bourbon, vanilla -- that rich barrel-forward character is back. Coconut, raisins. The beer is all barrel, carrying a noticeable heat that singes the nostrils. If you're looking for some of the base beer to shine through, look elsewhere. 
T: Mild contributions of caramel and toffee suggest some of the base beer is coming out. But as in the nose, this is all barrel. Nutty bourbon with raisins (not the treacly, sharp profile of sherry oxidation, but rather the sweeter, fleshier end of the spectrum that suggests a dessert wine). Was this partially aged in wine barrels? Vanilla, oak, and heat in the finish. 
M: Medium-bodied. It doesn't have the thick richness of something like King Henry, but its heat is quite brash and noticeable, with a strong warming effect. In my first review of batch 1, I predicted that the heat would die down and the flavor would be in balance. I was wrong; the heat lasted for the better part of a year, with the flavors becoming more mellow and less expressive as time passed. So I expect similar things here. I didn't get any bottles for aging. 
O: This is quite good, but it's outmatched by other barrel-aged barleywines, such as Wooden Hell, King Henry, Arctic Devil, BA Hi-Fi Rye, and Kuhnhenn Bourbon Barrel Barleywine. I found King Henry especially rich and barrel-forward, as well, but it had enough base beer contribution to seem more substantial. I like Sucaba, but it's not in my top tier for the style. I enjoy it more than Mother of All Storms, at least. 
~~~~
Original review of batch 1: 
Chilled bomber into a glass. It's not like we often have bad weather in CA to enjoy some of these big beers, so I make do. It's raining a bit. TIME FOR A WARMING BEER. 
A: The pour is a clear, caramel brown, though the beer in the glass looks substantially darker (still brown, and still clear at the right angle). Against the light, it glows with ruby tint. Tan head on the beer. 
S: Bourbon, coconut, vanilla, raisins. I've noticed coconut in several barrel-aged beers from FW. They're doing something right in this regard. It's unique and very pleasant. There's a mild heat that reveals the big nature of the beer. It's obvious that Abacus is very barrel-dominated; I'm not even sure what the base beer is supposed to smell like, because I'm not picking it up. It's great if you're a barrel fanatic, though. 
T: Like the nose, this is very barrel-dominated, though some hints of the base beer some to come through. Lots of brown sugar and bourbon. Some coconut and vanilla. The raisin flavors might be some wine barrel contribution, but they taste more treacly than wine grapes to me. Caramel, nuts, and a touch of toffee. Again, this is great for the barrel lover. I like barrel aged beers, but I'd love for the base to emerge more strongly than it does. 
M: Carbonation is low-medium. It's just right for a beer of this size. The body is hefty; I'd peg it at medium-full. There is a very noticeable heat to this beer. I like my beers silky-smooth, but I'm not suggesting this is a deal-breaker. With time, I see the mouthfeel reaching perfection. 
O: Wow. Hell yes. This one could use 2-3 months to cool off, but it's damn near ready to drink right now. It's very fairly priced and it's absolute quality. Get it.
UPDATE 06/12/2011: Either there's some bottle variation, or the bottles are falling off quickly. I still enjoy the beer, but I find it a little more one-note than I previously did, and the heat is more bothersome. It's still good, and I'm still enthusiastic about it, but I bumped my scores down a notch. In retrospect, I prefer the approach that Arctic Devil brings to the style, and this follows a little behind. 
UPDATE 09/27/2011: Bottles are continuously falling off. Gone is the rich vanilla and dark fruit character, leaving a general sweetness with some bourbon, while the heat remains. This beer was awesome when it came out. It fell off a cliff. I will only buy 1 or 2 of the next batch, and drink those quickly. 4,816 charactersArbitrator, Feb 21, 2012

4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Poured a mahogany brown/dark red color in my over-sized brandy glass from a 22 oz bottle nicely packaged in a box, with ABV and the year marked on the label. Deep ruby red hues when held against light.
The head was almost one finger and dissipated fairly quickly. 
S- Aroma was heavenly; lots of bourbon upfront with notes of charred wood, vanilla, dark fruits (raisins, dates soaked in alcohol) coming through. 
T,M- Smooth, very smooth, right from the start to the finish. Bourbon notes are evident upfront giving way to sweet notes in the middle. The sweetness was similar to the aroma; of raisins soaked in alcohol and mixed with some sugar. There was a hint of bitterness in the finish similar to caramelized burnt sugar bitterness. Perhaps one of the most well-balanced and smooth beers. Doesn't feel like a barleywine at all and definitely doesn't drink like a 12.5% beer. The alcohol is masked very well. A perfect sipper for a special occasion. 
O- Overall, this is perhaps one of the best beers I have had, period. The craft to make this beer is truly something that needs to be appreciated. It is definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended. Cheers!!! 1,176 charactersCaptDavyJones, Feb 20, 2012

You would be excused, when you first sip, if you experience momentary confusion and think that you’ve accidentally picked up a nice single barrel bourbon. The caramel, joined by toffee, then takes you for a ride. I can’t say that the beer finishes anywhere close to dry, but there’s a more significant hop presence at the end than I would have expected.
Mouthfeel: This is a complex and truly rich beer. Despite the huge dose and range of the sweet flavors, it never gets cloying even though it is not terribly zippy. Instead, it seems as though the lurking hops and the alcohol burn provide an adequate counterweight.
Drinkability: I think you need to judge each beer in the context of its style, so a high drinkability score for a barleywine doesn’t mean you can knock down a half dozen of them and then operate heavy machinery (or, perhaps, stand up). I will say, however, that this is a quite drinkable beer (and I am not typically a big fan of barleywines). 1,460 charactersrdickey, Feb 19, 2012

The aroma was very rich and had notes of raisin and chocolate alongside the traditional grain and malt scents. On the tongue, all those aspects were present, just amplified. The flavors were all well developed and very rich and full.
The body was pleasantly full, as you'd expect for the style, but managed to not be heavy or sticky. Drinkability was dangerously good, this the rare barleywine I could drink all night. Overall, an excellent example of the style. A must try if you see it and worth some effort to get. 712 charactersbeertunes, Feb 18, 2012

Pours a dark ruby red edging towards brown, with a finger of fluffy off white head that leaves decent oily lacing.
Bourbon & vanilla jump out at first, followed by spicy & earthy hops with a bit of citrus, tobacco, leather, wood. Alcohol is readily apparent but a bit distracting.
First taste gives impression of more hops than expected, spicy, earthy pine and a bit of dankness. The malt imparts strong caramel, dark bread & chocolate tones that mixes with vanilla, toffee, tobacco, leather, figs. Bourbon & oak character take the malt sweetness down a bit, and it finishes with Firestone's characteristic coconut barrel aging. Alcohol is definitely there but not as apparent as expected.
Medium-heavy body supports the flavors well, finishes a bit sweet and sticky but not cloying with good slickness. Definitely a bit hot but it compliments the bourbon well and keeps things from getting too sweet.
Easily the best bourbon barrel aged barleywine I've had thus far, but just a touch hotter than I remember the original Abacus being. Also quite a bit hoppier than most English barleywines, but FW once again shows their prowess at mixing classic English brewing with American creativity and flavors. I really want to try my bottle in a year or so with a good cigar, a great beer to celebrate with or just enjoy a cold night. 1,441 charactersafrokaze, Feb 18, 2012

A lot of bourbon in the nose followed by wisps of vanilla, oak, caramel, and smoke. Just like in the nose bourbon is up front on the taste and with the bourbon flavor is a little alcohol heat not terrible but maybe with some aging the heat will subside a little. There is also a good caramel flavor with vanilla, and some sweet dark fruits. The mouthfeel is very thick and a coats my entire mouth and it seems to stay on my tongue after each drink. Overall I feel that is is a good beer one that I would like to revisit some time in the future. 665 charactersphisigben, Feb 17, 2012

From a boxed bomber into a snifter. 
Brewers Reserve 2011
Note: Drinking an $ucaba no.002 right now and making a few comparison notes as I go. Got a couple of these from SliverX and Stupac. Thanks gents! Scores are still for the 2011 Abacus. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, super fizzy, thinner looking, light bronze colored head with horrible retention. Head quickly fizzes down to a ring only. I think this is fizzier than Coke. Transparent dark ruby body with no carbonation evident. A ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass. Fizzy and fizzy. By comparison, the 002 has a more normal head and isn't at all fizzy. Much nicer to look at. 
SMELL: Big nose on this one, with lots of barrel. Bourbon, oak, vanilla from the barrel aging, with some caramel and toffee in there from the barelywine. A hint of raisins as well. The barrel is more present but doesn’t dominate the base beer. Good nose. The 002 was slightly more mild but had all the same elements. 
TASTE: Still quite hot. Bourbon barrel with oak and vanilla up front, then lots of caramel and toffee sweetness through the middle into the finish. A big dose of alcohol at the finish as well. Bold but relatively dry aftertaste of sweet caramel and toffee, bourbon, vanilla, a touch of mik chocolate, and plenty of alcohol linger mildly. Despite the boozy barrel, the base beer still shows through. Nicely done, though a bit too hot for my liking. The 002 followed suit exactly here. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. A little lighter on the palate than hoped, but creamy enough. Goes down fine with a scratch and burn at the swallow, and finishes somewhat sticky. Plenty of heat lingers. The 002 was perhaps even lighter on the palate here, amazingly enough. 
OVERALL: Good thing this one came in a box. An enjoyable beer, and the base beer was still able to play a role in the flavor profile despite the big barrel presence. However, this one is till too hot to be top class in my books, being much hotter than the Parabola 002 we drank immediately afterwards. Moreover, the head on this one was just atrocious, reminding me of Rice Krispies doused in Coke. Noisy and obnoxious stuff. While this was an enjoyable beer I’d drink again if it were convenient, for me, Parabola 002 was the superiorly crafted beer in a box. Thanks again for sharing Doops. Good times! As far as the $ucuba 002 goes, it's a solid brew, but nothing worth going nuts over. I would probably still score it the same, though the scores for look and feel would be reversed. Cheers! 2,674 charactersJeffo, Feb 15, 2012

Appearance: Mahogany Brown with no head.
Smell: Straight up boozy.
Taste: Sweet Caramel/Toffee with a good balance smoothness courtesy of barrel aging. Way too easy to mask the 13%
Mouthfeel: This one's a super smooth drinker. Again the alcohol is well hidden for the 13%!
Overall: A very good BA Barleywine. No longer in my Top 5 with newer BA Barleywines like King Henry, BA Naked Evil and MOAS 2011. But still a very solid beer I'd happily come back to enjoy. 507 charactersTATURBO, Feb 14, 2012

A: a clear dark brown, with almost zero head just a quick lacing from poor that faded when pouring into a sniffer.
S: a nice sweet bourbon malty goodness, no real hop scent apparent.
T: malty goodness of roast, with a little bourbon profile of vanilla, toffee, a little chocolate.
M: not as warm, as it was last year. a year of age makes this taste less hot. no real bite of carbonation here.
O: pretty damn good, look forward to having another one in 2013 with a '11 and '12.
2012 - Sucaba (4.2/5)
A: again a dark brown that is clear, but this one had some head with a lacing that remained in the sniffer.
S: a more heavier bourbon aroma with lovely malt scents.
T: this one has more hop character then abacus, which is welcomed. Kind of reminds me a bit of the 15th anni blend.
M: a little carbonation tickle in the back of the throat, with a mildly bitter after taste.
O: definitely a nice brew, a tad different from the '11, but i am curious how this one develops. 1,001 charactersGrumpyJunglist, Feb 10, 2012

o: Given the hype and the price I expected a hell of a lot more out of this one. It isn't bad or anything, but there plenty of better BA b-wines at more reasonable prices out there. 740 charactersDIM, Feb 03, 2012

Smell: What it lacks in head, it makes up in aroma, with a rich combination of fruit (hints of fig, date and black cherry) and spice cake (brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon and vanilla), ensconced in the Bourbon barrel
Taste: Spice cake favors, up front, followed by the fruit and budding vanilla/brown sugar elements; earthy hops add some balance, at mid-palate, with the Bourbon barrel adding complexity to the finish
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with low to moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet
Overall: This is a really nice English Barleywine that is brimming with complexity and hides the alcohol mysteriously well

A: Still and murky, the barleywine sits tranquilly, a few isolated wisps of off-white head. The underlying ale is dark, a deep brown color that is opaque, verging on black occasionally.
S: Oak, molasses, anise, raisins, brown sugar, rich caramel, lightly toasted breads. I'm getting cramps typing all that out. The varied aromas are a treat, sweet and spicy with a strength that can't be hidden. Bourbony vanilla is a pleasing crescendo.
T: The bourbon, the last full measure of the nose, brings its strength immediately to the fore. The vanilla and oak, sweet and plodding and strong, are majestic. The boozy heat isn't that strong as I was expecting. Spices follow, the anise (black licorice) and brown sugar mixing with a bit of heat. Caramel, and a lot of it, is a recurring theme, running throughout each sip. The relatively low levels of carbonation (another tale for another time, I suppose) is a blessing and a curse, thick malts against the sweetness of the body. An astounding barleywine, the age has made the bourbon a star. Quite nice.
M: Thick and smooth, the bourbon even lending some cinnamon heat to the mix. Thanks, Dan, for this bottle; the howling winds outside give it a seasonal appropriateness. 1,262 charactersakorsak, Jan 27, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5It may or may not have been the time spent in a barrel, but Firestone Abacus looks like wood. It is such a deep, opaque brown that I can feel splinters just looking at it. Not only is the colour dark, but the complexion is hazy as stale tea. Any initial carbonation obviously became part of the 'angel's share' as this can hardly muster a halo. 
This barleywine was a resident of Heaven Hill bourbon barrels for 3 years and is not shy at all about its Alma mater. It is rich, temperately boozy, and showcases a strong barrel character. The bourbon, however, is not overtaxed as the backdrop of charred, honeyed wood is enlivened by notes of dark sticky-sweet fruits.
If the beer has any shortcomings, flavour is certainly not one of them: butterscotch and plum, raisin and chocolate pudding, tree resin and charred wood, custard and astringently steeped tea, the list is endless as forever. It entertains the palate with bourbon-inspired tastes and lots of gooey rich malt. Warming is most definitely a good thing. 
The mouthfeel has an almost syrupy viscosity with thick molasses and dark caramel notes. Sweetness, however, is hardly noted due to the char. The fact that you can still sense some of the leafy, earthy East Kent Golding bitterness is nothing short of remarkable. Mind you, it tastes as though it's been dipped in tobacco juice and coconut oil. 
At 13% alcohol, Abacus may make walking a delicately poised talent but drinking it - all 1 pint, 6 fluid ounces of it - is far from a challenging task. It may take some time, but that's less about necessity as it is not wanting to ever find the bottom. It offers a complexity that only barrel-aging can offer and, at only a year old, should only get better. 
Abacus is a beer for bourbon-barrel lovers. In a way, it exceeds any descriptions I can give of it. In another, more accurate way, it is a sublime blend of rich barleywine and proud Kentucky Bourbon. There's more flavor here in the aftertaste than most beers have in their entirety. This definitely rivals the best American barrel-aged brews. Thanks Sam! 2,079 charactersbiegaman, Jan 22, 2012

On tap at The Black Squirrel last night. $13 for a 10oz pour, reminding me again why DC sucks.
Pouring reddish brown with a thin tan head that recedes rapidly, this looks decent. The nose is great. Brown sugar, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, rich leather and a little tobacco, this is beautifully balanced all the way through. The alcohol is shockingly well-hidden, I find it hard to believe this is 13%. Some oak appears as it warms up. The palate opens mildly sweet with bourbon and brown sugar along with toffee. Mildly nutty without the associated astringency, this shows beautiful balance and complexity. Leather and pipe tobacco are present, especially on the finish. Some oak with nice tannins to balance the sweetness on the finish. The barrel is remarkably well-integrated here, it's a very harmonious beer. Surprisingly refreshing for a 13% barleywine, this is easily the best fresh barleywine I've had. 1,016 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 20, 2012

Dry, oaked aroma, hints of dark fruit, bourbon, and plenty of alcohol fume. As it warms the aroma becomes more inviting and is quite delectable.
Tastes a bit sweeter than I expected. It's got a boozy, caramel and vanilla backbone, with soft hints of raisin and cherry. It tastes like bourbon aging, but apparently all sorts of different wine and spirit barrels were used in the process. The resulting complexity really shows. It's not overly alcoholic in the finish, but the sweetness definitely carries through without much hop balance. The carbonation is subtle, but works. There's a little syrupy feel but ultimately not heavy on the palate. 
A unique and worthy English Barleywine, I would recommend trying this one. Curious to see how it ages, probably pretty nicely in my opinion. 887 charactersbennetj17, Jan 12, 2012

Pours a dark nutty brown, very dark and deep. Rich off-brown/tan head. Thick, yet thin on the lacing
Aroma is quite nice. Vanilla. Leather. Chocolate. Caramel. There's some "smoothness" to the nose. Not sure how to describe it. It seems to burn with alcohol at first, but just mellows out to sweet caramel and chocolate and vanilla. Spicy.
Well, ok. So this is a pretty darn good beer. Complex but with only a handful of flavors dancing around. Caramel and vanilla come from a woodiness. Chocolate and leather are more from a sweet side. A bit of spice from the barrel. A bit of an alcohol zing at the end, but all that does is make you want more
EDIT: Updated
 This is the newest version, 2012 Sucaba. Earlier review was Abacus and there is a difference...to me at least. This version was just thinner all the way around. The caramel and vanilla didn't come alive and laid somewhat dormant. This is tough to rate b/c it's still a great beer, but I feel it has lost something that aging in the bottle just won't improve. 1,110 charactersMebuzzard, Jan 12, 2012

S: Bready, caramely malts and some toffee. Alcohol is a bit present, a bit more than I remember in fresh bottles. Strange. I like to compare English Barleywines to J.W. Lees, because I believe that is the perfect example of the style. This certainly holds a candle to that beer and has that sweet bourbon lick on top.
T: Full of English malts and caramel, great compliments of the barrel. May be a bit strong as the alcohol seems to override most things here. A bit earthy with some grainy flavors. The wood plays a key role in the flavor of this beer. Bourbon flavors definitely work well with this barleywine.
M: Fills the palate, lingers and finishes sweet. Everything I look for in an English Barleywine. Just a bit of bitter hop to finish it off.
O: This beer really is close to perfect, leans towards a perfect English style barleywine with barrel notes on top. Quite impressive. 1,015 characterskiddynamite920, Jan 09, 2012

A: 1+ fingered creamy khaki colored head that exhibited solid retention atop this muddy brown bodied brew, but as the head dissipates it only left some lacing in its wake.
S: Raisons, LOADS of toffee, and lots of vanilla. Some biscuity malts show themselves as the beer warms. What the beer lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in potency.
T: Wow, so much flavor. Caramel, toffee, and dark fruits backed very nicely with vanilla undertones that resonate long after each tasting. I also could detect light wood characteristics with semi strong bourbon notes. Can't wait to try again fresh.
O: One of the most enjoyable Barleywines I've had to date. 738 characterstjkinate, Jan 07, 2012

A- Minimal head on a brownish red body. Nice alcohol legs! Minimal lacing.
S- Smooth bourbon booziness.
T- Caramel malts. More smoothness from the bourbon barrels. Very tasty. Some hop presence.
M- Syrupy, thicker mouthfeel. Good carbonation.

2011 vintage
Medium brown pour; very dark brown in the glass. One finger head thins out quickly to a sporadic patch and collar retention. Basically no lace.
The aroma is weak sauce; I'll give it tame at the very best. Hardly any oak, but the vanilla note is ok. Dark fruits are most notable - raisins and plum. A bit juicy and watery. Roasted cocoa ghost note. Faint overtones of bourbon. Begins to smell a bit better as it warms.
Tastes every bit as potent as the aroma isn't. Alcohol heat immediately molds bourbon and vanilla. From there it becomes heavy with sugars, often hanging in burnt territory. Some faint chocolate tones. Notes of molasses. Lots of dark fruits - raisins, prune and such. Tastes pretty good, even of on the sweet side.
Pretty much full bodied; fairly coating, too. Decent shot of carbonation keeps the beer from becoming tiresome. Finishes sugary with a touch of vanilla and oak. 972 charactersRyan011235, Jan 06, 2012

2011, No. 001
Thanks to pittsburghkid66 for hooking me up with this bottle. 
Appearance: Beautiful pour, thick mahogany brown body with stunning deep ruby highlights when held to the light. A small cream coloured head forms slowly; retention and lacing are average, but that is expected from a barrel aged beer of 13%. A light swirl yields stunning alcohol legs - it would seem the bourbon has even had an impact on the appearance. 
Smell: Good lord, I knew this was going to be a good beer, but I had no idea it would smell this delicious! It is just so rich and complex - basically it is perfect! 
Sweet caramel, toffee, maple syrup, butterscotch, quality bourbon, lots of oak, sweet vanilla, a stunning array of sweet fruits including cherries, plums, figs and golden raisins, toasted coconut and a light nuttiness are all present. Alcohol is noted, but it has a quality bourbon feel and fits perfectly with the rest of the nose. 
The combination of sweet caramel, bourbon and vanilla is to die for! 
Taste: I do not think there exist enough adjectives to describe just how good this beer tastes! The nose seemed perfect, but the taste just seems to be that little bit better.
Again sweet caramel, toffee, butterscotch, vanilla, bourbon, oak and sweet dark fruits are dominant. Alcohol is noted through a lovely warming at the back of the throat and all the way down to the stomach. The finish has a moderate bitterness that helps to keep the sweetness in check. 
Mouthfeel: Again pretty much perfect! Full, chewy body with super smooth, mild carbonation. I just seem to be continually reaching for the glass to take another sip.
Overall: An absolutely stunning beer, one of my all time favorites. I will have to make a concerted effort to get a whole lot more of this! 1,848 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 04, 2012

Dark brown with ruby highlights and a 1/2 finger light tan head which disappeared almost immediately with no lacing. The aroma has caramel, raisins, vanilla, and oak. Smells like it should be a very sweet beer.
The taste is quite sweet with caramel, raisins, vanilla, and a little oak. Has a classic English Barleywine flavor. No real hop presence to speak of, which is no problem for me.
Full bodied, low carbonation, chewy, and the alcohol is well hidden for 13.00 %. A nice solid Barleywine. 511 charactershardy008, Jan 04, 2012

A - dark cola colored with a sligh red tinge. Reminds me of the color of a soda fountain cherry cola. It has a small dirty white head that quickly dissipates.
S - Strong nose of dark fruits and honey. On the dark fruit side, I mostly note raisins. There is also a slight bready note to it. There is a slight spiceyness that gives a hint of the beer's BA aspects.
T - taste is sweet at first as I note candided dates and raisins. There are also notes of vanilla. There is a twinge of the alcohol that cuts into the sweeter flavors. The finish has a nice, strong barrel aged note to it as I note the oakyness which leaves a nice spice lingering on the tongue.
MF - this has a nice stickiness to it that matches well with the sweetness. Originally there isn't too much carbonation upfront but as the beer develops the carbonation arises that goes with the bourbon flavors that arises.
O - Overall a nice sweet Barleywine that has some BA aspects, especially the spicyness that shines through. A nice offering from Firestone walker and excited to try a few more by them. 1,115 charactersjeonseh, Jan 01, 2012

Note: have had from tap and bottle multiple times and this is nowhere near as good as it was. I have definite reservations about this beer holding up much longer.
A - Pours dark brown with very little head.
S - fig, vanillla are present, but it is dominated by rich caramel. Also some fusel alcohols in the nose.
T - Pretty sweet with a really nice hoppy bitter backbone.
M - a bit thin, with light carb and only a touch of heat
O - overall, pretty good, but not amazing. Extremely drinkable. Ranked 2 out of 6 in our blind tasting. 601 charactersChrisPro, Dec 27, 2011

S - the nose consists of caramel malts, figs, loads of vanilla, and some bourbon
T - sweet caramel malts up front give way to a lot of vanilla - the vanilla dominates a majority of the palate. There is also some whiskey/bourbon spiciness and heat on the backend.
M - medium bodied with a little bit of carbonation through the body.
D - pretty solid barrel aged barleywine. A lot of the flavors are masked by the vanilla bourbon barrel aging, which is good and bad. Good thing I bought a couple of these for aging as there still was a decent amount of heat. Recommended! 638 charactersbirchstick, Dec 26, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: The appearance of this beer is more similar to an old ale than a barleywine. A dark chocolate brown is a bit transparent in the thinner parts of the glass. A small off-white head struggles to form originally and fades to nothing fairly quickly.
Smell: The aroma simply bursts out of the glass. Tons of vanilla, caramel, bourbon, oak, and a bit of spice.
Taste: The flavor starts out with a very nice and complex gooey caramel that never gets too intense or cloying. A bit of roasted malt, some spice, and then a smooth bourbon, vanilla, and oak presence that carries through the finish. Incredibly smooth and balanced.
Mouthfeel: Although the alcohol is well-hidden in the flavor, the alcohol creates a tingling sensation on my tongue and warms the back of my throat and stomach. The carbonation is pretty much perfect; creamy and moderate. Definitely on the full side of the body spectrum. Slightly sticky.
Overall: This is not one of those beers that has nearly infinite separate components; it is a relatively simple beer that is made impressively well. The bourbon really accentuates the wonderful flavors and adds some complexity itself. 1,203 charactersKickInTheChalice, Dec 26, 2011

4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured on tap at Belmont Station into a Short, wide pilsner glass. Body is a deep red/amber color, topped by a solid finger of creamy, off-white head that sticks around for a while. Aroma of caramel and toffee with some notes of dark fruit and a whiff of citrusy hops.
 Palate is big on caramel malt up front, with touches of maple and dark fruit. A big dose of mellow hops help to offset the sweetness, imparting a mild citrusy note, along with some prune and/or cherry notes from the malt base.
 Body is rich but still a little thin for such a strong beer. The flavor is carried pretty well, but the super strong brew goes down a little too easy without a robust mouthfeel. Still, this is a thoroughly enjoyable offering, and I highly recommend seeking it out. 762 charactersElGordo, Dec 24, 2011

A - Deep red/brown body. Small white head which quickly dissipates to a still body. Legs, but there is minimal lacing or retention.
S - The bourbon and oak are very dominant. The finish is fruity. Caramelized figs and plums and sweet malts.
T - Alcohol is dominant but smooth and not overpowering. Taste is heavy on the bourbon and dark fruits. Medium carbonation and body. Maybe lighter than I would have liked.
O - A very delicious barrel aged barleywine. The only fault I found was that I wished the body was a bit heavier to support the flavors.
2012 §ucaba (the beer formerly known as Abacus), Batch 2. Poured into a tulip glass and reviewed on 09-01-2012.
A - Same as the 2011 but with a longer lasting head.
S - So chewy and toffee heavy. Smell is just very much in the english style with some fantastic barrel notes of bourbon heavy vanilla. Finishes with an alcohol warmth and some caramelized fruits and some spice.
T - Chewy toffee, burnt caramel, vanilla, oak, dark fruits. Still just as tasty as the first batch. Mouth feel is also still a tad on the light size.
O - This beer is very much a booze bomb. Its one of the hottest beers I've ever had, but it works the same that a fine bourbon or scotch works. You just sip and enjoy the deep complexity. Its very english with a strong and chewy toffee aroma and flavor that seems to meld right into strong bourbon barrel notes. This remains to be a top three barleywine for me. 1,511 charactersdavey101, Dec 23, 2011

Nutty and richly caramelised malt aroma with some fruit and earthy character. Not as complex as it could be but still very good. The darker, more caramelised malt notes and well developed on both the palate and the nose. Some minerally character comes through on the palate.
Medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Fairly good with just a hint of dryness on the palate.
A really nice English style Barleywine. I don't find it to be the best beer I've ever had but it is certainly solid and deserving of it's status as a great beer. 701 charactersdgilks, Dec 19, 2011

Poured into a tulip glass, served at 52º cellar temperature. 
Frothy spotty lace around the edges, sturdy collar of foam and a wispy broken skim across the surface after a few minutes. Glinting highlights of saturated crimson where the light gets through.
Aromas of English toffee with crushed almonds, maple syrup and freshly toasted creme brulee. Traces of oak and sweet vanilla. Spec-fucking-tacular.
Flavors of toffee, toasted almonds, syrupy maple, caramel, almond toffee. Light woody bitterness on the back end. Chewy, fudgy, decadent... smooth and luxurious. This is some serious stuff to get lost in. Full bodied and packing a punch, the alcohol heat is well integrated but still lurking in the periphery. A frostbitten winter beast that's a real treat to sit with and sip over an hour or two.

Wood (oak), sweet malty caramel, brown sugar bourbon, hit of vanilla, tasting a touch of booze, good times. Pretty full bodied and lightly syrupy. Slightly sweet at the end. Great. So, so, sad I don't have any more of these gems to see how they are in a year or so. 653 characterspmlondrigan, Dec 17, 2011

Appearance: Careful pour yields a one fourth inch offwhite head that dissipates immediately. Pours a semi translucent dark red brown. No lacing, very leggy.
Smell: Vanilla and coconut bourbon and oak. Malt and sugary fruit. Welcoming bourbon barrel aromas. Like the flavor, it's a large, sublimely well-integrated set of notes. Not bold, not particularly potent, but beautiful and enhances the flavor.
Taste: Bourbon and oak, spicy, vanilla, that "almost coconut" of strongly American oak influenced beer, with a hot finish. Slight roasted flavors, some mild dark fruit (raisin, date) and apple. Less distinct notes and more deep complexity that's superbly balanced. 
Really, balance and oak aging are the stars here. Heat is there in the flavor (13% = not kidding around), but it only helps. It's amazing to have so much flavor without giving an impression of boldness... It's not subtle either, but nothing hits you over the head. Just tons of perfectly married flavor.
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Good attenuation (just a little dry, and not sugary). Not as outstanding as the flavor, but well done enough.
Overall: This is my kind of beer. Lots of great barleywine (I would guess the base beer is delicious on its own) and oak bourbon barrel flavors. Hope I don't miss the 2012 version in February. 1,554 charactersPahn, Dec 12, 2011

A: Pours a semi-hazy reddish-brown mahogany color. Minimal head that fades pretty quickly...not for lack of carbonation though as it can be seen floating up through the body of the beer. Massive alcohol legs as well.
S: Huge booze-soaked raisins and other dark fruits: plums, figs...bourbon is pleasantly in the background. Some brown sugar and confectionary sweetness noticeable. No hop aroma at all.
T&M: A big chewy version of the aroma. Raisins, figs and plums. The bourbon is quick to move through the palate, which I very much appreciate - definitely not one of the main flavors here, just compliments everything else. I also get something of a granola bar taste. Oaty and sweet. Such a smooth viscous beer that coats the mouth and throat long after the initial sip. Carbonation is low. Very much full-bodied. No astringency from the alcohol, but definitely get some heat in the chest.
O: This is really a brilliant beer. Truth be told, I forgot that this was a bourbon-barrel aged beer until I got a whiff of the aroma...and I was a little bummed. I don't seem to have the appreciation for bourbon-barrel aged beers that some others do. But it was so complimentary to the other flavors that were going on in this beer, that I didn't find it at all offensive as I normally do. In fact, this may have changed my opinion on bourbon-barrel aged beers. One of few beers that have opened my eyes recently. A fun take on a Barleywine. 1,537 characterskbuzz, Dec 10, 2011

Pours a lovely deep brown, just flecked with hints of ruby. The body is a thick, glutinous blob of chewy malt, and the bubbly inconsistent head is really the subsistent, secondary part of the appearance. Nice fine carbonation. Looks very decent.
Nose is just lovely, and a brilliant archetype of the Firestone Walker barrel-aging genre. Lovely coconut-vanilla characters coming through above a gorgeously thick and sweet malt basis. Slight hints of earthy vegetation coming through, giving a touch of tea and a minerally hint of seaweed. Very nicely accentuated. Lovely.
Taste is smooth, luscious and gorgeous, with big sweetness beautifully worked off the oak tannins and faint acidity. Coconut comes through, along with hints of reduced bourbon, barley sugar and a slick resiny aftertaste. Really smooth, and gorgeously integrated—the characters all meld together really beautifully, and although the complexities are manifold, they form one coherence, blissful whole.
Feel is spectacularly smooth, while remaining quite fluid. The feel is pretty much the only way to truly detect the alcohol as well, sitting as it does as a warmth on the back of the throat.
A gorgeous beer from FW. I love their anniversary barrel blends, but this one shows that they can do something amazing and comparable with a single brew as well. Great stuff. 1,476 characterslacqueredmouse, Dec 10, 2011

Taste is malty with caramel, molasses and nuts. Loads of oak aged notes soon follow with vanilla, dark chocolate, and dark malts. Finish is smooth and lasting.
Body is very heavy and licorous with a medium level of carbonation and an amazingly smooth mouthfeel. Warming sensation follows.
Top notch oak aged barleywine from FW. Very balanced, great flavor and an even better mouthfeel. 656 characterspaulozanello, Nov 29, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Dark ruby, light brown creamy head, hard pour in SA perfect pint glass leaves little lasting head. No lacing to speak of.
Smell: Strong bourbon, oak, alcohol. Faint bit of vanilla and toffee/caramel. Very nice.
Taste: Bourbon, malty, and generally sweet. There's a lot going on here, but it's very well mingled together - kind of a situation where picking out the individual flavors doesn't do justice to the sum of the parts. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, kind of high on the carb.
Drinkability: It is what it is - a boozy alcohol bomb of a thick syrupy style of beer. Split your bomber with a friend - one glass is plenty.
Overall: This is an excellent beer. But, following up a Pelican MoaS, it really fell short of that bar. That speaks more to the MoaS than it does to the Abacus though. A touch on the boozy side for my liking, and we're about 7 months old at this point. I also had a bottle fresh and don't notice a discernible difference to my memory. 971 characterscbeer88, Nov 27, 2011

A: Pours dark coffee brown with an amber tint around the ring of the glass. Some faint swirls on the surface, with a ring of largish sand colored bubbles. No lacing. Retention is good for what it is.
S: Wow, up front is bourbon, rich toasted oak and toffee, and vanilla. Underneath, dark chocolate, cherries, and some dried dark fruit. Candied orange. Sweetish. A little alcohol and tobacco come through at it warms. Gorgeous.
T: Caramel malt, pretty mellow bourbon, dark chocolate, bright but subtle orange, fig, long finish with some nice vanilla. Slightly sweet. Alcohol is noticeable and could be a little more hidden.
M: Medium body and medium carbonation, a little high for the style. Warms the body, making it superb for cool weather.
O: Decadent and delicious with a phenomenal, complex aroma. If the flavors had melded together a little more on the palate (like I remember the tap version having done), this would have been 5's across the board. In any case, this is an awesome English-style barleywine.
---
2012 vintage (enjoyed June 2014): Some of the flavors have mellowed/receded, esp. the richness that you get fresh. Consequently, the sweetness comes out a bit more, but the booze has mellowed as well. This is still delicious and even more drinkable. 1,317 characterspmarlowe, Nov 25, 2011

4.02/5  rDev -9.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a clear, very dark mahogany brown with ruby highlights. Light brown head. Bubbly head at first, but doesn't linger long. Starts to look flat after a while.
Aroma is primarily bourbon, wood, and vanilla. Some barleywine-like qualities come out right after the second pour, but then the bourbon returns. Fairly sweet.
Taste upfront is sweet caramel and a little raisin-like fruit sweetness with a light presence of bourbon, wood, and vanilla. Increased bourbon flavor at the finish along with some wood, caramel malt, and toffee. Lingering bourbon and toasted malts.
Medium to full bodied and somewhat syrupy with a little alcohol heat at the finish. Alcohol is well in check.
Bourbon presence isn't that high, but not a lot of barleywine characteristics. I have mixed feelings about Abacus... great taste with a good balance of bourbon, but not a whole lot else going on. I can tell the base barleywine is under there, but it just doesn't come out. Kind of one dimensional, but still very enjoyable.

(A)- Pours a deep dark dark blood red crimson/black color with ruby red highlights. Some bits of tan froth and subtle lace.
(S)- Nice and rich. Bits of toasted caramel and oak. Bits of booze soaked raisin and toffee, but is by no means a hot booze aroma. Tiny hints of cocoa and a nut (almond?).
(T)- Very similar to the smell in every way. Rich, but a buttery smooth sweetness. Bits of toasted oak up front with mellow caramel, toffee, almond, and raisin. Even subtle bits of vanilla at the end from the oak.
(M)- A mellow carbonation level. A superb balance to it; superbly integrated ABV level. There is some heat, but incredibly smooth and mellow for being 13%. Sweet and rich too, but expertly balanced as a whole without overpowering the other.
(D)- Age has done some very interesting things to this. Still rich, sweet, and powerful, but far more smoother, balanced and integrated from what I remember on tap. I look forward to what further time does to this, though I think this was at its best, fresh and on tap. 1,098 characterssweemzander, Nov 24, 2011

The aroma features a wide array of flavors, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and dark fruit. The taste has a lot of the dark fruit (boozy raisin?) along with the bourbon, oak, vanilla, and some caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with an adequate amount of carbonation.
It was a decent barleywine, but the taste just turned me the wrong way, perhaps I'm not cut out for barleywines but the high alcohol presence, sweetness, and the pronounced dark fruit just turned me off. 564 charactersmkotsayfan, Nov 21, 2011

A - Decent clarity. A dark cola brown, quite dark actually for the style. I imagine that's the barrel talking. Cream colored head with a nice ring of bubbles around the edges of the glass.
S - Very sweet, boozy, lots of vanilla and heavy char off the oak barrel. Chocolate is there too.
T - Smooth char and dry oak. Mild vanilla and quite malty. I'd have preferred more hoppiness in a barleywine, even in spite of the barrel. Mild coffee flavors on the finish.
M/O - Extremely smooth, low carbonation. Finishes hot, deep in the throat - but this is more residual rather than immediate.
A nice beer, but compared to the other BA offerings from Firestone Walker this was nowhere near as complex or enjoyable. 745 charactersSpider889, Nov 20, 2011

Bottle served in a Stone 15th Anniversary glass. Thanks to SpdKilz for the bottle!
Appearance -- Beautiful dark brown transitions to a dark ruby red at the edge of the glass when held up to the light. Head is very persistent at about half a finger and a creamy, buttermilk color.
Smell -- Incredible. Very, very happy that this was my 23rd birthday beer. Initially I get a very vanilla-based sweetness that is quickly surrounded by the barrel notes, most notably the toasted coconut and bourbon sweetness that you expect from good barrels. 
Taste -- I love bourbon barrel aged beers and I knew this would be top-notch. This beer is so smooth that it is almost impossible to pick out specific taste characteristics. Initially I taste the sweetness of the bourbon barrels and the vanilla and oak that it imparts on the beer, followed by toffee/caramel sweetness. Little bit of toasted coconut in there as well. At 13% this is easily the smoothest double-digit ABV beer I have ever had. 
Mouthfeel -- Abacus is so smooth and drinkable. The carbonation is spot-on and perfect for a brew of this size. 
Overall -- Abacus is basically the perfect BA Barleywine IMO. Definitely the best I have ever had. I'm very happy that I was able to try this. 1,259 charactersmullenpc, Nov 16, 2011

A: Ruddy mahogany with a firm creme colored head. Some particles land on the glass when this is swirled.
N: Caramel, vanilla, malt, oak, and toffee. Bourbon is well-integrated. Brown sugar, honey, and syrup. Some cola. Has a lot of rich flavors.
T: Tastes of bourbon mixed with a round sweetness and a tempering bitterness. Lots of flavors of the wood are showing through here. DOesn't destroy the palate, and that's a good thing. 
M: Not as heavy as expected, and there's a high amount of carbonation which I don't enjoy. Alcohol is somewhat pronounced. 
O: A very solid beer that seems to be missing a little extra oomph. Enjoying it, even if it reminds me a bit of a low-end bourbon. 747 charactersSarlacc83, Nov 14, 2011

Tobacco, date, plum, fig, dark fruity, moderate toffee, lighter caramel, fairly malty, bourbon, somewhat woody flavor. Dark fruity, cherry, plum, toffee aftertaste.

 Thanks to Nicks 6217 for the beer
A-- Poured and settled a dark cola color. Shows lots of carbonation and a quick sprouting and fading light brown head, otherwise a light brown ring around the sides. Lots of ruby showing when held to the light. Not a lot of head retention to this at all. 
S-- Carmel, lots of carmel. Undertones of bourbon, vanilla, and coconut. had a bottle in May and the vanilla and coconut nose was much bigger and the Carmel was a bit softer. Still a good nose though. Alcohol is quite well hidden.
T-- Syrupy butterscotch, bourbon, touches of oak, vanilla and noticeable alcohol. Gums got numb on first few sips of the beer. 
M-- Thick, syrupy and slightly jam like. Get some notes of strawberry jam in the mouth. Bourbon and the barrel are really apparent in the mouth as well. Bourbon alcohol finish to this with touches of jam like qualities. I think starting to turn into a malt bomb. Medium full body and slightly more carbonation than it needed. A bit prickly at times. 
O-- Thought much better fresher when I first had it. The barrel notes far more obvious in the nose then. Just starting to develop the jam like qualities that barlewines have. Careful cellaring might be really good for the beer, though I preferred the fresher version much more. Odd balance of strawberry and bourbon now than not sure I really like. 1,382 charactersmulder1010, Nov 07, 2011

Really excited to drink this guy. I've had it before, but am glad to be reviewing it this time.
Poured into a Magic Chouffe Tulip.
Pours a dark brown, like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. Light, smooth head, that gives way quickly. Hazy clarity, but not from being too cold, or yeast residue. This was from the first half of the bottle, and was poured carefully.
Aroma shows lots of vanilla, bourbon, tannin and caramel. The alcohol is masked in the overall, which is surprising for 13%.
The flavor is much like the smell, delivering on those promises made to my olfactories. So mellow, so smooth. The Frank Sinatra of beverages. An easy drinker, continuing to hide the high ABV. Absolutely delicious.
Second half of the bottle goes into a large snifter, and is swirled to blend leftovers. Still remains slightly hazy, but not chunky. Taste continues to be phenomenally balanced and smooth.
I'm glad I have some more of this. A top 5 brew for me, in my book. 998 charactersYaKnowBrady, Nov 01, 2011

4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz brown glass pry-top bottle. 2011.
Pours a deep, dark, opaque brown with very little head. Nose is like butterscotch (not faulted), sweet vanilla, boozy whiskey, sticky caramel, etc. Palate is wide and thick, choc-ful-o-flavor. Lots of the same characteristics from the nose but less butterscotch. Viscous but not cloying. The alcohol is warming and pleasant. Lots of bourbon flavor but it's well integrated.
Notes: Usually I detest bourbon barreled barleywines, but this one is stellar. The integration, the marriage of wood and beer, is just perfect. I think this is better than Parabola (shhh....) Well done FW. 620 charactersSFLpunk, Oct 29, 2011

Thanks to ShanePB for the trade.
Pours a garnet/ruby color with a minimal tan head. No lacing, no retention, but that is somewhat expected for the style and abv (13%).
This is a treat. Oak, vanilla and toffee greet the nostrils with a firm layer of fusel alcohol underneath. Amazingly complex. Dark cherries and ripe plums lend a fruity sweetness that works in concert with the barrel flavors and some raisins/figs.
On the palate, this guy is far from bashful. Fusel alcohol throughout; really no shame in letting it rip. Toffee is prominent, with oak, vanilla, cherries, plums and figs rounding it all out.
Medium to full body, smooth, with a bit of expected roughness from the booze. The finish is sugary and boozey. As boozey as this is, you don't get the warming/heat down the throat to get in the way of all this flavor.
This is an elite english style barleywine, my preferred style of barleywine. Large toffee notes with loads of sweetness and some nice dryness from the oak. 1,021 charactersColForbinBC, Oct 29, 2011

Thanks again to Arbitrator for yet another bottle. The signature Bay Area wax job let's me know it's genuine. 
A: Unchanged. 5/5
S: Easy enough to smell, but the vanilla notes are gone. Still there is the bourbon and wood. Not sure it's really setting itself apart anymore. 3.5/5
T: Bourbon barrel forward still with a bunch of stone fruit right behind it. Sweet malts lingering but the overwhelming complexity is definitely diminished. 3/5
M: Unchanged. 4/5
O: I still enjoyed this beer, but it's not quite as distinctive now as it was fresher. More middle of the pack and forgettable albeit non-offensive. 3.5/5
Big thanks goes out to Arbitrator for sending one of these up my way. I'm still hoping to buy one off the shelf when (if) it hits Portland but at least now I can get a taste. Bomber split with TulipSnifter. I used a Captain Lawrence snifter and she used a Mad Elf snifter. 
A: Very dark garnet bordering on black at the thickest part of the glass. Other brewery's might try to call this a "black barleywine". Firestone Walker simply calls it "barleywine ale", like that's the way the style should be. A good two fingers of cappuccino like head forms on top with a vigorous pour. No lacing, but it has legs. Looks to be nice and syrupy. You drink with the eyes before the taste buds and my eyes like what they see. 5/5
S: The same -bal notes I find in Parabola are definitely here. Spice, vanilla, sharp wood, and some beautiful chocolate covered coconut sweetness promise quite a bit. My one complaint is that the aroma, while complex, isn't as strong as I would like. 4.5/5
T: Tongue numbing bourbon bites right off the bat. Sweet artisanal chocolate candies represent the malt base very well. Cherry cordials are one of those candies. Nice vanilla notes, sugary caramel, and some toast are other flavors I can pick well. I'm having a hard time not giving the perfect score here. Are there any faults? Do I wish something was better? I'm going to say it might be a touch hot right now. The bourbon is great but in 3-6 months I can see the directness of the heat smoothing out a little bit and really tying this thing up. 4.5/5
M: Thick and viscous with low carbonation. The finish is sticky but no more than expected for a 13% barleywine. I'm okay with a good rating here. 4/5
O: Quite the enjoyable beer. Big, boozy, sweet... Some of my most enjoyable characteristics of beers that get it right. FW delivers yet another winner. If these bottles ever get up to Portland, I'll be buying some more. I'd recommend anybody who see's these to buy, buy,buy. 4.5/5 2,598 charactershopsbreath, Oct 28, 2011

A- Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head that disappears as quickly as it arrived. When held up to light it shines a beautiful dark ruby color. A large amount of floaties are present throughout the beer. No lacing is present as drinking commences.
S- Large oak/bourbon along with dark fruit notes take center stage with some toffee, coffee, and vanilla hiding in the background. Hints of booze to remind you this is a monster of a beer. 
T- Extremely complex blend of sweet caramel, chocolate, dark fruits, and coffee all sprinkled over a very large oak/bourbon backbone. A smooth, creamy vanilla is faintly evident throughout each taste. Everything is in harmony with no single component distracting from the others. A great warming presence from the alcohol, leading to a faint burn as the glass makes its way to room temperature.
M- Pretty heavy body but a decent amount of carbonation gives this beer a creamy, smooth mouthfeel. The heavy body and building alcohol warmth/burn as this beer warms make this a great sipper. 
O- What a treat it is to drink this beer. A skillfully crafted beer this is very complex and a pleasure to sip on throughout the night. Glad I have a few more to try for the long Chicago winter ahead of me. 1,276 charactersSimmy7000, Oct 26, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Huhzubendah for the bottle!
Pours a deep ruby color with an espresso crema head. Head retention and lacing are unheard of for a beer of this strength.
Aroma of bourbon, dark fruits, and oak. Very nice!
Extraordinarily complex blend of bourbon, oak, vanilla, tobacco, leather, and more. The flavors swirl together in a way that is completely harmonious and complementary. Alcohol is there, but in a way that enhances completely and never distracts.
Silky smooth and velvety mouthfeel. Creamy, with just enough carbonation. Hops provide a nice balancing support in the back end that keeps things in check and doesn't allow for the sweetness to enter cloying territory.
Overall, one of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had. A shining example of the level of flavor that can be achieved through the use of bourbon barrels. Delicious. 846 charactersafdempse, Oct 23, 2011

S= The nose is pretty complex. Sweet caramel, vanilla, some dark fruit, bourbon, and molasses. It also seems like there is some toasted malt in undertone of this beer.
T= The main thing that jumps out for me is the bourbon and vanilla they are pretty strong in the taste and really come through. I also pick on the molasses and dark fruit like figs or something like that. Nice roasted malt is the backbone in this beer.
M= I would say this is a Full bodied beer, with low carbonation.
O= Overall, I would say this is a very good barleywine and was perfect for a cold Oct. night. This is definitely a sipping beer and gets better as it warms up. 738 charactersLiquidBread219, Oct 22, 2011

Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. In the taste, mellow bourbon, and notes of dark fruit, oak, vanilla, and alcohol. A small bite, however mainly smooth, with a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, and a dryer alcohol and oaky aftertaste. Big bourbon, although the aftertaste is lacking, but fantastic otherwise. 388 charactersOWSLEY069, Oct 19, 2011

Aroma is bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Booze is really strong with this one.
Taste follows nose. Lots of bourbon, less vanilla & oak. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Flavors move around a bit, nice complexity.
Just like w/ Parabola, a quick swirl of the snifter brings a bright flash of buttery, caramely bubbles up to the surface. Nice burst of bourbony aroma follows.
Overall a really good barleywine. Really sweet, great for slow sipping on a cold October night. 634 charactersdraheim, Oct 18, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fun review to write. I’ve had this beer two times before today and I already know I love it. Time to enjoy some and finally post a review. Firestone makes some great beers and this is certainly one of them. 
Even with an aggressive pour you still only get a ¼ inch of light tan wispy head. This quickly fades to a thin ring of foam around the edge. Some foam clings to the glass here and there. Almost appears to be more legs vs. lacing…. The beer has that barleywine ruby tone within the deep amber color.
The aroma is heaven. Layers of chewy sweet caramel, vanilla, some dark fruit. And some toasty goodness in the background from some nice malt.
The flavors here are so deep and fairly complex. Lots going on. Vanilla, coconut, again chewy caramel. A hint of dark fruits. Layers of toasty malt again mix with the caramel. Somehow this reminds me of something in the bread basket at an extremely high end restaurant. Sometimes they have a crusty/toasty sweet bread with some dark fruit in it. The different flavor components all meld in a wonderful way here. The warming sense of alcohol is really nice and wonderfully rounds. Not hot, just warming.
Velvet like again warming in your through and heart.
A bottle to share a beer to savor. A treat any time you have the chance. 1,287 charactersReagan1984, Oct 16, 2011

Slightly carbonated, possibly over carbonated IMO. Overall this was very good. I love that it is balanced and that the bourbon doesn't dominate.

Poured to a snifter, deep brownish red almost a plumb color it held a half finger light tan head for about a minute that dissolved thin film and then to nothing.
Very rich aroma. Very sweet, dark fruits, burnt sugar and carmal. Just a little bit of alcohol.
First sip is I get a lot of sweet flavors blended together. Lots of sweet malt, tart strawberry, tiny bit of bitterness there is defiantly some alcohol in the finish which is paired with oak flavors.
Mouth feel is super smooth, silky, the flavors really envelop the entire mouth.

T&M - Hits super sweet, and immediately you get that dark fruit, cherry vanilla flavor that builds to a wonderful woody alcohol burn that forms this amazing mouthgasm. Very nice alcohol burn and pretty heavy body. After taste is smokey, a little chocolate and toffee, but mostly that bourbon flavor which seems a little too much after a while.

3.98/5  rDev -10.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bomber into a Duvel tulip. Reviewed from notes.
Initially, this pours a nearly opaque deep ruby or garnet. But as I slowly made my way to the bottom of the glass, the beer appeared a fairly translucent reddish-brown. Half-finger light brown head filled with loose bubbles lasted less than a minute. A surprising amount of suspended yeast at the bottom of the bottle.
The smell is a rather musky collection of dark fruits. Plums and toffee, with just a little bit of caramel. Curiously, there's not too much barrel presence in the aroma. A touch of wood, maybe some coconut and vanilla, but it's light. Little to no alcohol phenols coming off of this one. 
The taste departs significantly from the aroma in a very positive way. There's a ton of booze in this beer, and it is hot going down. The -bal isn't overpowering, but there is a very strong woody character in play. Given how malty this beer is, the barrel-aging does wonders for balance. Prunes, cherries and toffee are all present, but this beer never seems cloying.
The mouthfeel is excellent - I wish all barleywines went down like this. Smooth and rich, with an appropriately low level of carbonation.
I suppose you can't judge a beer by its nose. What at first seemed like a potential letdown turned out to be an excellent barleywine. Though they're obviously quite different styles of beer, Abacus and Parabola are both very barrel-dominant - I think this is the more successful of the two, as the imparted flavors complement the base beer very well. I'll be curious to see if this improves down the road. 1,572 charactersamphion1065, Sep 30, 2011

Awesome head retention. 
Smells like figs and prunes. Tons of ethanol on the nose. Perfectly aged smells a little oxidized. Smells smokey and nutty malty with a swirl definite chocolate.

3.96/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've had this 3 times or so now. Each time is almost a different experience, but the first bottle I had at a tasting provided by boatshoes stuck out as the worst of the lot. I'm not sure what is going on here, but this beer is far from consistent. 
Apearance
This is a pretty dark barleywine. Its a deep, burnt ruby with a wispy gray head that throws droopy lacing. The beer looks thick, showing good veining on the glass. 
Aroma
The oak is fairly dominate here. Its damp, time worn and bourbon soaked. I can pick up a little notion of pollen or hay dust as well. Caramel, smoothed over by vanilla should be the dominate aroma, but instead is secondary. The bourbon smells spicy, almost like its a rye whiskey instead. 
Taste
The taste leads off with that spicy bourbon which is smoothed over by the team of caramel and vanilla. Wood isn't as dominate here, but it is lending it's musty essence. 
Mouthfeel
This beer is obviously fairly warm, but it is toned back and well incorporated. This is a sugary beer with a gritty, heavy body that is near impossible for the low carbonation to cut through. 
Overall
This beer ranged from a let down to quite good. I had very high hopes for this one though, and it turns out that it didn't quite live up to them. Still though, this is an enjoyable beer. 1,299 charactersMbpBugeye, Sep 25, 2011

A: The beer poured a dark brown (maybe a dark ruby?). It came with a small (half a fingers worth) white head that dissipated quickly. Left minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. 
S: Big time aromas coming from this beer. Could smell waves of caramelized malt with huge whiskey and vanilla notes. Large alcohol notes coming through with burnt brown sugar and dark fruits. There is also hints of oak. 
T: Bourbon bourbon bourbon. Huge booziness on the front followed closely with vanilla, bready malts and burnt sugar. I am also getting some dark fruits on the back end, but some what hard to identify with the large bourbon notes. Good amounts of oak apparent as well.
M: Medium to almost heavy mouth feel. Very silky mouth feel that goes down nicely. Beware though, that bourbon will kick you in the pants if your not ready for it. Very warming all the way down. A little hot, but thats how I like it. 
O: A fantastic barrel aged barley wine that was very much enjoyed. Would love to come back to it with a little bit of age. The alcohol was strong, but that is to be expected. One of the better barrel aged barley wines I have had. 1,180 charactersCaptainTripps, Sep 23, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've been wanting to try this for awhile but haven't found the right opportunity to open one. Well, as of 9pm tonight I'm on vacation for four days so the time is now. Thanks to Brian (BrewerB) for this bottle, which I received in a recent box.
This one pours a nice and rich cherried wood in color with a light and fizzy khaki colored head which quickly dissipated. The aromas consist of sweet and ripe dark fruits, figs, light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, and port. It smells pretty good but I could use more bourbon. The flavors are almost exactly what I was looking for tonight. You get a lot of buttery biscuity malt (yet not as intense as a California Chardonnay), light bourbon, oak, vanilla, raisins, figs, and it has a rich and resonating after taste. The bourbon is a little more mellow than I anticipated but it's fine. Overall this is a fine beer and a pretty spectacular barrel aged barleywine. It's an instant favorite and probably my second favorite of the style to only the Mother of All Storms. 1,015 charactersaasher, Sep 23, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Finally getting to try this one! Bought for $20 at The Stable.
Opened the brown Abacus box for the first time, revealing a 22oz bottle with a sophisticated label noting "Batch One" and "2011".
Used a cabernet glass as my snifter.
Aroma: Mmmmm. Carmelized, malty goodness. Pineapple upside-down cake, vanilla, sweet whiskey, and a hint of the booze that awaits. Definitely one to contemplate.
Appearance: 1/2 finger head disappears quickly. This one's got legs, but minimal lacing. Body is brown-copper, but dark enough in color to make translucent.
Flavor: Mirrors the aroma profile. Again--sweet, delicious carmelized fruit and vanilla notes that you find in a pineapple upside-down cake. Whiskey flavor also comes through, but is a bit on the hot side yet. Really made me envision how much more fantastic this brew might be with a little more age.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, medium-low carbonation. Peppery heat from the alcohol comes over the tongue, throat, and sinuses, and is reminiscent of a fortified wine.
Overall: A delicious barleywine that I was glad to have shared with a couple of friends. At 13%, it would have admittedly been a challenge to finish by myself. I can see why so many BA's rave about this one, and look forward to trying it again after it's been laid down for 3 or so more years. 1,315 charactersmdvatab, Sep 18, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Dogfish snifter. It poured a dark, murky brown color with a thin white head sticking to the edges of the glass. The head faded to a thin ring after a minute or so, but fit the style pretty well overall. 
The aroma really balances the barleywine and the bourbon flavors nicely. Both seem to come through equally and really compliment each other. I get a brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruit character to the barleywine while the bourbon, vanilla and oak really add some depth and complexity to itl. fantastic aroma to it overall. 
The taste really wowed me right from the first sip. Dark fruits mix with some brown sugar, vanilla, oak, and some fantastic bourbon flavors. Everything integrates perfectly in it, all the flavors shine at one time or another. The bourbony finish is very smooth and complimentary of the malty, sweet, caramel and brown sugar flavors. A little boozy heat in the finish, but fitting for a barrel aged barleywine. This is perfection for me in a barleywine. 
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being below average. It has a creaminess to it that really works well for it. Overall it was a fantastic beer, and probably the best of the style I've had. MOAS was great, but I liked this one a little more. It was so flavorful, smooth, and everything just works so well together. Fantastic beer overall, I loved it. 1,395 charactersbillab914, Sep 17, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Received via trade with Azureoval (Thanks Josh).
Original review is of Abacus, a short footnote and recalculation for Sucuba: A lot of sharp alcohol flavor from Abacus is long gone in Sucuba. I don't know if the recipe changed at all but this version is much smoother and easier to drink. The barrel notes aren't quite as forward and integrated well into the beer. I certainly enjoyed this much more the 2nd time around. 
Right out of the gates this beer is darker than I expected. A very dark brown with brick red edges when held to light. 
The aroma starts off with bourbon.... a ton of it. Big whisky notes. Vanilla and coconut all over the place! Very sweet and hot. The aroma represents the flavor accurately. Bourbon all over. Ethyl alcohol is very present. The malt bill seems to get lost in the barrel somewhere. I get a lot of vanilla and cocnut in this beer. More so than in almost any other beer I've ever tasted that didn't have vanilla or coconut added. Drinking a bomber of this by yourself isn't really reccomended. It can become a bit much. Boozy, sweet, and surprisingly simple. Lacks a lot of the complexity I had hoped for. The mouthfeel is average for the style and the carbonation was adequate. 
Overall, this is a good beer but I think it may have spent a little too much time in the barrel for my personal tastes. I look for a spirit barrel to be part of a beer, not take it over.

Smell is straightforward - rich bourbon and sweet caramel, bready malts. Sweet and boozy. Caramel, vanilla, oak, and burnt sugar are all present. Not terribly complex, but quite nice.
Taste follows the nose - smooth, despite the alcohol and bourbon kick. Tons of caramel sweetness and bourbon with subtle bready malts, vanilla, and toffee in the background. Very straight forward flavor profile.
Feel - medium bodied and a bit thinner and drier than I would have thought. Quite nice.
Overall, a very tasty beer - sweet and boozy, but not overwhelmingly so. A lovely slow sipper. 731 charactersreadbaron, Sep 14, 2011

A: Very dark, dark brown. Very little amount of thin head consisting of large bubbles.
S: Lots of wonderful malts, caramel and booze.
T: This one has lots of laywrs. It starts with a caramel sweetness and then gives way to wonderul oak and bourbon notes. It finishes with a nice maltiness.
M: Medium to full body with an appropriate amound of carbonation.
O: So glad I traded for a 2nd bottle. Now I have another one to try somewhere down the road. 503 characterscamil1mj, Sep 12, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle generously given and shared by Huhzubendah. Thanks Matt!
 Pours a brilliant brown w/ orange highlights and a sliver of a chocolate head. Very little carbonation or lacing, which is expected at a 13% ABV beer. Excellent for the style. Very port-like in appearance. Nose is nothing short of amazing! Malt, chocolate, toffee, some faint fruit, and very mild alcohol smell, oak. bourbon. There's no way the nose gets any better than it is. Wow. Taste is very similar profile. Unbelievable! It's so smooth and drinkable I can't believe it's a 13% beer. Alcohol is almost completely masked in the taste. This is truly one of the best beers I've ever had the privilege of tasting. If you have the opportunity to try this, RUN, don't walk, and pick up as much as you can fit in your car. Undoubtedly a world class beer, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it. Cheers! 873 charactersjayhawk73, Sep 08, 2011

A: Pours a dark mahogany with the slightest light tan head popping up in the pour. That quickly leaves to a ruby hued bubbling mass. 
S: There are so many great smells wafting out of my glass right now. Great dark fruits, some raisins, figs, and dates, with the nice woodiness of the barrel shining through. There is a slight vanilla sweetness and a little boozy back. 
T: The taste is like the nose, but much better. The barrel comes through much more with a great oakiness and sweet vanilla combination. The dark fruits I smelled are present here as well, but take a back seat to everything else going on. There is heat present from the alcohol, but it is wonderfully integrated and not overpowing in the least bit. It finishes with a light, semi-sweet chocolate. 
M: Medium to heavy bodied. This is very smooth and has a great coating quality that leaving you wanting more. There is little carbonation, but it's a perfect amount. Very warming on the way down. 
O: This lived up to my expectations indeed. I've read the threads about this fading and I just laughed as I was drinking this. To me it was great and the combination of flavors, especially the barrel qualities, really did this for me. I'm glad I've got some more in the cellar. 1,427 charactersTreebs, Sep 07, 2011

Pours a chill-hazed chestnut with a pinky of khaki colored head. Nice viscosity with minimal lacing & no head retention
S: Vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit (cherries), a bit of booze
T: Follows the nose, rich cakeyness to go with some butter rum notes as well up front. Jammy notes mix with raisins & figs as this warms, along with dryness, some woody & herbal hop presence as well. Finishes dry, fruitty, with some rich oaky notes
MF: Chewy, low carbonation, nice balance, warming booze there as well.

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5There’s a monster in my glass, and its name is Abacus. Seriously, though, there’s almost too much extravagance surrounding this beer. From the forum hype to the bottle-in-box packaging, this beer already has a lot going for it before I even open it; really, the expectations of epic-ness are big. Here’s to hoping Firestone-Walker delivers!
Bottled approximately six months before the date of this tasting (March 2011). Thanks again to tripelhops for making this legendary tasting possible.
A: A very, very dark ruby red. The body looks nearly jet black from a bird’s-eye view, only to reveal a gorgeous crimson when you look through the liquid at the bottom. The head is quite light – just about the same color as the label. The lovely eggshell cream looks weightlessly silky on top of the body, a fine powder above the darkness. Medium amount of lacing.
S: Big, big nose here. The alcohol is one of the most forward smells, starting strong with a hit of vodka-type booze. It’s not as unpleasant as it sounds, though. Some spices, especially cinnamon and ginger, move around beneath the alcohol, quickly followed up by some dark, fruity malts. These bubblegum, cranberry, raisin, fig, and warm brown sugar aromas are what take the nose to the next level. That, and the earthy tones of estery yeast, tobacco, and oak. A hugely complex nose, but all within the frame of super-booziness; hopefully it’s a bit tamer in the taste.
T: Incredibly sweet; there’s a bright sugariness that registers as soon as it hits your lips. Cherry candy, warm vanilla, sugarplum, honey, coconut, dark chocolate – they’re all products of the malt. Wow. Cinnamon is present, once again, but it’s only there for a moment; that is, right before you get a mouthful of barley. Full-on grain husk, with a big taste of grassy wheats. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting that from something with such a high ABV; I thought the booze would just block it out. Very glad to see that you can still taste the beer’s most fundamental ingredients, though. At the back end, oaky booze comes in and, supported by a slight coffee profile, smoothes everything out. And for such an alcoholic beer, it’s pretty drinkable; it’s definitely not as striking and vodka-like as in nose. No other flavors come out after, leaving this one with an aftertaste of coffee, chocolate, and a bit of booze. It’s like a mix of tiramisu and rum-cake with chocolate drizzle. Decadent, rich, smooth – I know that I haven’t explored the diverse barleywine style very much, but I’m gonna go ahead and say that it will take a truly divine beer to beat this flavor profile. 
M: Wow; so warming. Gentle, smooth, and with just the right amount of pop on the front end, it’s hard to tell that this is a 13% ABV brew. It’s almost like it’s showing off how light it can be, and honestly, the palate would be much more serious if the body were thicker. The fact that it isn’t is nice, though – it seems like a much less intimidating brew.
O: This is one of those beers that I didn’t really expect to love; big, boozy, sugar-bombs (i.e., DFH 120 Minute, Founders Devil Dancer, GI Night Stalker) just don’t sit well with me. This beer, though, has such a delicate approach to those flavors – I could really drink it all day. It isn’t my absolute favorite brew, or anything that I think I'd be craving, but it really is a gorgeous beer. Great job, Firestone-Walker – this is an incredible barleywine! 3,487 charactersBarryMFBurton, Sep 06, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a murky dark brown with hints of garnet and a nice wispy head. 
Smells dense. It seems a lot of English Barleywines have a thin nose. This thing jumps out of the glass and you know there's something solid in the glass. Sweet and caramely, raisins, dates, cotton candy. Wow.
Taste is every bit as great as the smell. Thick and rich, it coats the palate. Tons of dark fruit backed up by what must be a massive malt bill. Almost tastes like a stout...a nicely sweet one. 
It's so dense and sweet, but the sweetness doesn't ruin it like it does some brews. A truly exceptional beer and one I wish I had regular access to. 623 characterskirok1999, Sep 03, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a clear, very dark plum color. If it weren't for the clarity, there would be slim chance of seeing through it. About 1/3" of khaki colored head forms, which has reasonable retention considering the ABV. Lacing is nonexistent, but the legs are pretty good.
Smell: Very nice smell. Initially what hits me is a ton of candied sugar, along with vanilla. Very sweet caramel malt and toffee. The barrel aging certainly shines through; I get some bourbon, but I can tell this beer was partially wine barrel aged. I get some dark fruit character (fig, a bit of raisin) that I believe is enhanced by the wine barrel aging. Very complex, and about as good as it gets to my nose.
Taste: Sweet toffee and caramel malts show first, as well as vanilla and brown sugar. Very sweet malt base, but very pleasant as well. On the back end, the barrels kick in. Some bourbon is present, but also fig and a bit of raisin. A touch of port character, even.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is between medium and full, and gets exponentially smoother as the beer warms towards room temperature. I have heard several people mention that there is a lot of variation in Abacus bottles; I will agree with this. I have had one other bottle before this and was not nearly as impressed. Interested to see how the others I have turn out. Overall though, this is an exemplary barrel aged barleywine. Very complex and well integrated flavors. 1,420 characterszhanson88, Sep 01, 2011

A: Dark blood red in the lights on the back porch. Decent head formation and wonderful legs and lacing. Very nice to look at.
S: Wow! Bourbon and fig and sweet malt and raisins. This really is an amazing nose full of barleywine. 
T: Another wow! Really, really complex. Caramel sweetness and big oak and bourbon and dark fruits. Amazingly sweet at first, then the oak/bourbon kicks in. 
M: Incredibly smooth, but hot! At 13%, this is not for the faint of heart! It is hot on your tongue and it stays hot all the way down. 
O: If I could get my hands on another bottle, I would see if aging it would help with the heat v.s. sweetness battle that seemed to be raging on my tongue, but it sure was a treat to have this one to drink just the way it was. 873 charactersSpica66, Aug 31, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I drank Firestone Walker's bourbon barrel aged barleywine "Abacus" a short few hours before sleeping in the bathtub again. I do not blame the brewer. But there may be something wrong with me, because nearly the same thing happened when I drank FW's Parabola.
Personal reflection aside, Abacus pours a red brown amber with a sticky head. It smells like bourbon, but it's tempered by thick and sweet candy malts, sugars, and dark fruits. Perhaps not the most complex smell, but fantastic.
The same goes for the taste. It's front-loaded with bourbon and sugar, and the dark fruits come in later. At the end of the sip, there is even some roastiness. The only knock on the beer may be just how overly sweet it is. 
Sweet enough to land you in a bathtub by the end of the night. 776 charactersafksports, Aug 31, 2011

2011 Release
A- Pours a deep deep dark reddish brown that looks like blood in the light. Even with a vigorous pour no head bubbles up at all but leaves some really nice legs on the side of the glass as it slides down. 
S- Very very interesting smelling, unlike any other barley wine I've put my nose in. Deep dark roastiness up front from the malts and possibly the barrel char which is quickly followed by a strong bourbon booziness that is so enticing. This beer has a lot of subtle notes like sweet caramel, toffee, vanilla, and musty oak.
T- This is the type of beer that literally just blows you away the second it hits the tongue and leaves you speechless. Tastes just like the nose but so much better! Up front the barrel really comes through and dominates with strong flavors of delicious bourbon, musty oak, and sweet vanilla. Behind that you get flavors of roasted malts, caramel, toffee, and a slight bitterness from whats left of the hops.
M- Medium bodied with moderate to lower carbonation and a nice wet slightly bitter finish. Definitely has a nice warming feeling from the bourbon and higher ABV. 
Overall this is just absolutely phenomenal. So complex and every sip just gets better and better as it warms. If you can, get this beer and as much of it as you can.

4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 22 ounce bottle with a black foil wrapping around the cap. Sent to me by leschkie, so a huge "thank you" goes out to him! Into a Deschutes tulip glass...
It pours deep brown, almost black as you watch it come out of the bottle, and it develops about a centimeter of cream/white head that consists of large bubbles. There is little retention, which is not surprising given the alcohol content. It smells wonderfully of caramel, toffee, toasted malt, some dark fruits (raisin, date), bourbon, and some faintly bitter hops. Very good first impression. The taste is great: hazelnut, toffee, toasted malt, caramel, and bourbon dominate. Some alcohol is detectable, as are some oak flavors and some muddled, floral hops. Mouthfeel is very smooth, albeit thick, and the carbonation helps it slide off the tongue. There is a lingering warmness from the alcohol. Overall, an amazing barleywine that easily ranks amongst my all-time favorites. 936 characterseclipse54, Aug 26, 2011

2011 batch
A- This beer pours a dense brown body with a garnet glow at the base of the glass. There is a bubbly tan head that soon fades to a thick ring and it the body is a bit to dense to see any carbonation. 
S- The aroma of cream and vanilla oak notes have a soft bourbon note to follow. There is a dark toffee sweetness in the finish that grows as the beer opens. The oak character also grows a bit as the beer warms. 
T- The dry bitterness in the finish has some qualities of roasted malt and a bit of hops in it. As the beer opens up there are some slightly sweet malt rich characters with oak notes and a soft bourbon that all blend together. 
M- The medium mouthfeel has a thick texture that coats the back of the throat and a gentle alcohol warmth in the finish. 
O- This well blended beer has some rich malt notes and bourbon notes that come through when it opens up but everything takes on a 1 dimensional character. It is a nice barleywine. 979 charactersrhoadsrage, Aug 25, 2011

2.67/5  rDev -40.1%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2Batch one with several months on it. 
Gorgeous dark maroon pour with just the right carbonation. Can't get any better looking.
Boozy on the nose, barrels obvious but not rich and deep, more sharp and simple. Smells like other barrels too, not just bourbon, which the label confirms. Muddled hotness results. Maybe they should have just used whiskey barrels. Too much sharp and undefined alcohol ultimately. 
And the tastes agree; too much booze here. Esters complement the alcohol in an unholy union. Hints of the rich carmel and dark fruit depth I crave in a barrel bw, but it doesn't deliver. 
Aftertaste bites with unwelcome astringency and grainy ethanol. 
Thickness cut down by the barrels, right in my sweet spot there. 
Lots of reviewers I trust like this beer, and it sounds like something I'd love, a bourbon heavy barleywine. Oh well. At least I didn't trade for a case. (I have two more that are sitting in the cellar for at least 3 years.) 956 characterscaskstrength, Aug 19, 2011

Pours a very dark ruby, almost brown color. At first glance I would have assumed this is a stout. Head is off white, half a finger, and quickly fading into a light ring. 
The nose starts with bourbon at first, with plenty of oak. From there, dark fruit and caramel take center place. There is a feint scent of vanilla as well. Alcohol hits the nose at the very end.
Wow! This is incredibly rich and complex. Abundant amounts of malt and bourbon hit up front. It starts very sweet, but is then balanced by a surprising amount of hops and spice. Bourbon and alcoholic warmth stays with you.
The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Carbonation is a bit on the lighter side.
Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, my first try from Firestone Walker. I am excited that there are two more of these sitting in my closet to age. 846 charactersfatmcb1, Aug 18, 2011

T - Lots of the barrel - bourbon, smoke, wood, vanilla. Some chocolatey and toffee malts, and grassy leathery hops. Nice flavor, wish a bit more of the base beer was in it.

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.
Appearance - Dark ruby body. At first glance, it looks like a light stout. With some light, you can see the flecks of red in the body. Not a great head and no lacing. It's 13%, so that's expected.
Smell - Bourbon up front, followed by dark fruits. Plums and figs. The bulk of the aroma is caramel and brown sugar. Wonderful aroma. The best barleywine I've ever stuck my nose in.
Taste - Perhaps the slightest bit less interesting than the smell. Bourbon burn right at the front. A lot of caramel and brown sugar in the body. I get hints of dark fruits, but not as much as the smell. The finish has a hop bitterness and is boozy with a strong bourbon finish. Very nice.
Mouthfeel - Thick and syrupy at first, but it goes away at the end. It has a strong alcohol burn, which is really the only complaint.
Overall - The best barleywine I've had. Bourbon is the bacon of beer. It makes everything better. 940 charactersAlieniloquium, Aug 17, 2011
3.57/5  rDev -20%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bomber (Spring 2011) into a Darkness tulip on August 13, 2011. Thanks drDogBeer! Dark wood to rust colored with good clarity. A small light tan head formed but left rather fast.
 Aroma is signature barleywine - dark fruit, specifically raisins and figs with notes of chocolate and toast. Very restrained booze. Tastes flavorful with notes of dark, dried fruit; some chocolate and vanilla, but as with the aroma, the bourbon is very restrained. The finish is very clean and the feel of the beer in general is closer to a Quadrupel than a barleywine - light body (for the style!), cleaner flavors and high carbonation. I am not digging it all that much.
 Overall it's certainly a good beer but it's not the ultimate barleywine. It's a shame that Mirror Mirror 2009 got infected, otherwise that would have been a much superior alternative. Well, I can always cough a few bucks more and go for J.W.

Tastes like butterscotch and bourbon.

S: Bourbon, anise, cherry, tobacco. The alcohol is there but well integrated.
T: Vanilla bean ice cream, bourbon, drizzled with chocolate. Sweet as hell, but cloying? Is an ice cream sundae "cloying"? No, its just awesome. No medicinal qualities, even in the impressions of cherry as the glass warms. Nice woody undertones, and a FAINT hop bitterness compliment. Not over hopped, thankfully. Alcohol presence is complimenting, not really "boozy".
M: Enough carbonation to support and enhance drinkability. Body is velvety and smooth. Drinkability is right on, this is going down too fast @ 13%.

S - Scents of carmelized sugar and dried fruit. Has a bit of chocolate scent as well. The lingering smells of bourbon is evident as it settles.
T - Wow. There is a taste of cherry and vanilla initially. Almost like tasting the syrup of a sundae. It then gives to a strong malty chocolate flavor that ends up with the boozy burn of bourbon. Just well blended and incredibly tasty.
M - Heavy, and a bit moreso because of the complexity. It is a true sipper, and after this you really won't enjoy fine flavors of other beers. End your drinking with this.
O - I actually am not a big barleywine fan but have tried to appreciate the quality types (like Old Ruffian). This is about the best I've had. I am finding FW to be a personal favorite brewery. 858 characterssocon67, Aug 11, 2011

T: Godly. Very unexpected. Doesn't taste like most barleywines, much sweeter, less hoppy, and full of bourbon, vanilla, and almost a hint of sort of a cabernet sauvignon. The alcohol hits a little bit at the end and you are left with a sort of vanilla-fig flavor
M: The perfect carbonation to compliment the flavor of it. Really thick also, kind of syrupy
Overall, I love this and it's the best barleywine I've ever had. If it was easier to find I would buy it by the case even at $15 a bottle. Can't wait to see what a bit of age does to this 795 charactersBobheed, Aug 10, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5My offering for our Lollapalooza weekend throwdown on August 7th, 2011. Bomber into wine glass.
First of all, I'm saddened that FW is forced to find a new title to bestow on this brew just because of a bitchy Cali wine company. Abacus is a great name and I'll spend the next week crying over its unfortunate demise. Anyway... "Barleywine" pours a dark mahogany with very little head (despite my aggressive tip). Very good lacing with tons of legs. Alcohol feet cling to the sides throughout the 45 minutes I spent with this brew. 
The nose is, well, bourbon. And extremely smooth bourbon at that. Vanilla comes second. A heap of other undertones come third, including figs, caramel, cinnamon, slight alcohol, and oak barrel. Somehow it all feels less than what I expected. 
Ahh, the taste is more what I was anticipating. Virtually identical characters as in the nose but more pronounced while maintaining excellent blending. It's all about togetherness with these barrels. In addition to bourbon, oak , and vanilla there is a little dark chocolate and bready notes. Alcohol kicks in at the backend with a fair amount warming. Slightly tannic finish. Bourbon aftertaste coats my tongue and lingers for quite a while.
Appropriate feel. Heavy body, good carbonation. Again, extremely smooth throughout. Not quite as smooth as your ideal woman's legs, but not everything about this beer can be perfect. 
I'm thinking my second bottle will need about a year on it before I consider a revisit. It is very well blended but I'd like to see mellowing out of the alcohol particularly on the finish. Great stuff, so far it's my #1 in this style. 1,640 charactersAuracom, Aug 09, 2011

Appearance is a dark copper color with an off-white head, not very tall. Taking in the nose of this barleywine is something else, there is quite a bit going on, all of it quite pleasant. I noticed coconut, cherry, vanilla, bourbon and caramel. Taking a sip and I taste brown sugar, caramel, more vanilla, brandy and well toasted marshmallow. MF is fairly creamy with an aftertaste of alcohol, ie some brandy and bourbon. If you come across this in bottle or on-tap, this is a fantastic barleywine. 528 charactersmltobin, Aug 06, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark hazy amber, pretty much light brown (which is dark for the style) with a small half inch eggshell cap that dissipates rather quickly leaving nice lacing. Already I can tell this is a big boy...
Aromas throw me off initially. The first thing I get is a distinct dark fruitiness (plums, figs, red grapes). As I dive back in I get nice barrel accents highlighted by vanilla and light toffee. As it warms the butterscotch smell becomes very apparent and almost dominant, with a hint of baker's cocoa in the background. Really really nice and inviting.
The tastes follow the nose and are equally intense. Sweeter malty notes show in flavor first with butterscotch and maple syrup being the most forward. Lesser notes of toffee and cocoa once again. Soon the Bourbon barrel ushers in powerful flavors of vanilla, light oak and light bourbon. Late flavors of alcohol and the dark fruits of plum and fig (that were present in the nose) appear once again, but they are not as strong here. Complex to say the least.
The mouthfeel is quite chewy with low carbonation, bordering syrupy but not quite there luckily, which is impressive because this is a 13% monster. This is about as low of a carbonation level as I can tolerate (I hate flat/still beers) but it works here.
Overall, this was an experience to say the least. Crazy complex Barley Wine that I can't compare to anything I have ever had because it was so unique. Definitely delicious and well recommended if you like barley wines and/or bourbon. Bourbon barrel definitely plays a significant role but it is so well integrated that boozy is not a fair term. This is meant to be sipped and savored (and more appropriately shared, even though for my first time around here I did not). 1,747 charactersclaspada, Aug 05, 2011

A - Pours a pretty dark, cola-like color with some ruby highlights when held to the right light. A small, .5 finger tan head forms and recedes pretty quickly to a collar of the same color. Lacing is unremarkable. **EDIT: Just had this again and feel my previous score here was slightly low.
S - Really strong bourbon and vanilla mixed with caramel, butterscotch, and dark fruits (figs, dates, some cherry). Wood notes make an appearance from time to time. Some chocolate in there as well? Very nice complex nose.
T - Bourbon, vanilla and creamy butterscotch all the way here. Caramel and wood flavors come out as well. Some nice dark fruit and chocolate flavors add nicely to the profile along with a nice honey undertone. Alcohol definitely comes through on this one; pretty hot.
M - Butter-like smoothness (think butterscotch), syrupy, and some serious alcohol heat. Slight burn because of it. Medium-heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. 
O - Really enjoyed this one for the first time. Would love to see what a couple of years does to this one. Lower alcohol burn would definitely give this one higher marks in my opinion. 1,170 charactersKAP1356, Aug 01, 2011

A: Dark. Almost black, with deep ruby red coming through on the edges when held to light. Hardly any head, what little there is, is a slightly off white color. Good lacing.
S: BIG bourbon. BIG butterscotch. Dark fruit, raisins, figs. Vanilla. Very light roasted coffee. Super complex. I'm sure I'm missing a lot.
T: Again huge bourbon qualities. Butterscotch from front to back and all the way through the finish. Raisins, figs. Kind of hot. Way to complex for my palette. Can't wait for a year or two on this one. Mellow out the alcohol and it's a 5.
M: Full Bodied. Very thick. Super creamy. Taste lingers for ever.

4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle into Portsmouth snifter.
A: Pours a very very dark mahogany red with a finger of dark tan head that quickly faded into a thick collar that left a few streaks of lacing down the glass. 
S: I knew this was going to be a good beer before I even opened (I know, biased much?), but this smells deeper and more complex than I could have imagined. I get notes of caramel, raisins, vanilla, mint, herbal hops, pepper, pine resin, bourbon, honey, coco nibs and even a splash of coffee. I mean this beer has everything, and I haven’t even taken my first sip. 
T: Again, very rich and complex flavors. There is an amazing balance between sweet, spicy, and alcohol. I get dominant notes of spicy bourbon and woody cask flavors along with vanilla and a honey-like sweetness, but there are more subtle flavors of molasses, raisin and red grapes, caramel, and both herbal and pine hops. The vanilla in the finish reminds me of marshmallows, and that splash of coffee and chocolate I smelled is present in the aftertaste. I get a note or two of leather and tobacco in the aftertaste as well, and those flavors along with some warm bourbon linger long after I swallow. 
M: Low, even carbonation over a thick body and slick, sticky mouthfeel. The bourbon and alcohol are warm but comfortable and work well with the boldness of the flavor. 
O: Just an amazingly rich and bold beer with complex and well integrated flavors. I enjoyed this whole bottle over the course of a couple hours and savored every sip! 1,503 charactersscottfrie, Jul 30, 2011

S: Nose was like WHAM! bourbon, vanilla, wood, chocolate hints of cocoa and espresso
T: Complex..vanilla, bourbon, oak, oats, caramel, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt and a mass amount of sugar not to mention well hopped. 
M: Nice, sweet big body beer for sure but I like a bit of chewiness in my bwines. This was good but opposite almost to easy to drink for a bwine, like buttery smooth

4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bomber into a pint glass. Been lookin forward to this one. Let's see what it has to offer.
A- Pours a pretty cola, maroon color. Brown and red tangle for dominance. The head is tan in color, billowing at first but dissipates down pretty quick to a thin ring. No noticeable lace. 
S- Wow, what a nose! Strong bourbon and vanilla aroma warms the nostrils at first. There is a very strong caramel base, along with toffee and dark fruits. Fig and dates mostly. But the bourbon upfront is awesome.
T- The bourbon flavor dominates in flavor as it does in the aroma. The vanilla follows suit but is not as strong. There's a sweetness of hard candy in this beer but not cloying. I probably could've held on to this a little longer as the booze is still fairly warm. The dark fruit flavor is in the background of the brew, and some malt for good measure.
M- The mouthfeel is very syrupy and smooth. Thick, and full bodied. Carbonation was evident from head but feels low in the mouth. There's deffinitely heat in the mouth and throat from the booze. 
O- This is like drinking a lower abv Gentlemans Jack Daniels. There's still enough elements to to remind you that this is beer. I let this sit for three months and couldn't wait. I say if you love bourbon, drink right away. If you want that flavor to mellow and tasteore like a beer, let it sit for at least six months. Still, this is an excellent barleywine. 1,406 charactershaazer, Jul 29, 2011

A - Beautiful deep mahagony brownish colored, clear, with a small, thin, lingering foam ring. Little lacing.
S - Caramel, toffee, sweet bready malts. Little bit of dark fruits, figs and plums. Subtle vanilla and oaky aromas are blended quite nicely. Light earthy hops.
F/M - Rich malty goodness up front. Loads of dark fruits and caramel, bready malts, and a late piney/earthy hop flavor leads to a moderate bitterness which helps to keep this malt bomb from being too sweet. Vanilla and a light tannic oakiness appear as the beer reaches room temperature. A touch of alcoholic warmth in the belly, not in the throat. Medium full bodied with moderate carbonation. A little thick and oily on the palate. Lingering bready caramel malts long after the finish.
O - What a great beer. Delicious, rich, and bold, another top-notch beer from Firestone Walker. 913 charactersdomtronzero, Jul 29, 2011

A- Pours a deep dark ruddy, muddy Red/Mahogany stained brown. A pillow of tan lace floats a top this beautiful brew before quickly dissapating. Little hints of lacing left behind, but it's more oily than I would have thought. Decent carbonation pops and bubbles from my DFH Signature glass. 
S- Vanilla, charred oak, dried plums, figs, dried cherries, alcohol, roasted pecans and macadamia nuts. I don't even wanna taste this... I just wanna bask in the awesomeness and perfection that is in the nose of this one! Absolutely... one of the top 3 or 5 brews that I've ever laid my nose on! 
T- Sweet vanilla and dark dried fruit! Nice toasty oak flavor and alcohol burn. Some complain about high alcohol brews, but I love them and revell in them. If you like Bourbon, you're gonna LOVE this!!! Lovely figgy jam... sticky and sweet... roasted nuts, caramel, toffee popcorn, and love!!! Yes... I can taste the love that was put into this fantastic barleywine!
M- Semi-thick is how I would best describe this one! Really caramel coating, laced with notes of honey, figs, molasses, and brown sugar. I somehow wish it was just a touch thicker tho... I'm thinking this is WAY more English BW style than West Coast!!! I'm not picking up much more than a hint of hops. The vanilla from the oak aging is perfect and spot on! Kids... It just doesn't get any better than this!
O- This is perfect! Absolutely perfect! I can't imagine a Bourbon Barrel Barleywine topping this... but I'll be sure to try all that I can get my hands on! This is Heaven and Hell in a glass... Sin and seduction, Beauty and the Beast!!! Every taste that you smell becomes history ... and every smell that you taste becomes a memory... I will remember this forever! 1,801 charactersThickfreakness, Jul 28, 2011

Pours a reddish hued brown. When out of the light it's almost black with an ivory white head that sticks around to a noticeable amount of lacing.
Smells like chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon and the best smell in the world. Alcohol heat is very present but I like it a lot.
Tastes are sweet caramel, booze, and a light bitterness.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly medium with good carbonation. I was chewing on almost every sip.
Overall is probably the best Barley Wine I've ever had. Quickly becoming my new favorite brewery. 536 charactersdaveytheformer, Jul 24, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was the first of the I had tried by this brewery so it's fairly new in Philadelphia. I didn't know much about them ahead of time so basically just bought this out of curiosity. This beer poured black with a thin white head. The aroma was very sweet with notes of vanilla, plum, and burnt sugar. The taste was a little more mellow than expected, not as cloyingly sweet as I thought it would be after smelling the beer. The mouthfeel was very creamy and woody with a nice alcohol burn on the finish. The wood masked some of the assertiveness seen in most barleywines and instead added a lot of complexity to it. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one since my palate was totally exhausted when I was done. This beer was a bit pricey, but it was worth every penny. It was definitely one of the best barleywines I've ever had and I can't wait to try more from this brewery. 877 charactersjonvan04, Jul 24, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz brown bomber into a clear glass snifter. 2011 vintage. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $15.99.
A: Rusty brown burned caramel color with solid 1-finger of head that dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a few scraps of lace.
S: Sumptuous caramel-toffee aroma mixed with vanilla and coconut, chocolate, and espresso. Herbal and citrus floral hopes make an appearance along with smooth whiskey.
T: A stellar barleywine to be sure. Layered caramel and toffee flavors with a lot of sweetness but plenty of slightly burnt toast dominate, and the vanilla, whiskey, and coconut really accent the huge maltiness and maintain this from becoming cloying. The alcohol is powerful, but it does not detract in the least - it stays pretty neutral and mostly provides warming. The barrel-aged notes add spice and bourbon notes with the coconut. The citrus hops bitterness with mango and pineapple coupled with the amazingly medium-dry finish are instrumental to this beer treading the fine line of over-sweet syrupy and greatness, finally landing on greatness. I had 2011 Parabola last week and really enjoyed it, but Abacus really outshines it with its complexity and roundness. 
M: Smooth and silky with low carbonation and a giant body behind the 13% ABV.
O: One of the best two or three beers I have tried this year. It is different than FW Anniversary 14 but just as enjoyable. I don't tell myself to go out and buy too many $15.99 bombers, but this is one I am going to try to find a couple more of to lay down for 4-5 years. A superb barrel-aged beer. Nice job FW. Highly recommended. 1,620 charactersargock, Jul 23, 2011

A - Very dark red color -- almost chestnut. Very little head quickly dissipates as soon as that alcohol starts to breath.
S - Vanilla, figs, dates, bourbon, and wood. I love the smell of this beer. 
T - Sweet, caramel tasting malt on the front with hints of vanilla, dried fruits (dates, figs), a slight hint of tobacco, and of course bourbon. Finishes nice and dry without any heat from the alcohol content.
M - Light/Medium body with mild carbonation. For a beer with this much alcohol, I think its incredibly balanced.
Reviewed on: 07-17-2011 19:45:40
Note: I love this beer, but I prefer it on tap vs bottle. I think it should also be served around 40-45 degrees and slowly sipped as it warms up. The spectrum of flavor is amazing ! 830 charactersunitmonster, Jul 22, 2011

4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Delirium Tremens tulip.
Caramel brown color. Two finger beige head. Good lacing and retention. Looks great.
Smells of caramel, toffee, vanilla, hints of oak, and a touch of bourbon. A solid dose of booziness too, but not off putting.
Taste follows smell, only more intense. Also, a really nice dose of bitter and earthy hops balance out the sweet flavors. Some coffee and black licorice flavor in addition to what was in the nose. Finish is tobacco, leather, caramel, and vanilla fudge. Awesome. Solid smack of booze as well.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, but light on it's feet. Carbonation isn't high, but kinda high for a barrel aged beer, and it breaks up the stickiness and heaviness of the body. Perhaps could have been a little less carbonated and more viscous. Acidity could be a little more restrained as well, but it sort of adds a sharpness and brightness to the beer that is kinda nice. Alcohol is there, and makes itself known, and kinda helps balance the sweet flavors.
One of the best barrel aged barleywines I have ever tried. Top 5 for sure. Just a great beer. 1,092 charactersbillshmeinke, Jul 18, 2011

3.54/5  rDev -20.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a snifter. 2011 vintage. Thanks to psiweaver for this.
3.5 A: Clear (I think) deep brown, nearly black color. One finger of fizzy head falls quickly and leaves no lacing.
4.5 S: This nose has it all and by that I mean it has a big hit of bourbon AND a very respectable beer underneath. The bourbon is lightly leathery with perhaps a touch of peat. Also included is a moderate fruitiness that borders on the floral, good bit of vanilla, and nearly as much oak. Lots of caramel and toffee with plum, prune, date, and fig fruitiness. Brown sugar and a very reasonable booze level for the ABV. Really complex and pleasant. Borderline 5.0. 
3.0 T: I can't believe what I'm tasting. This beer has such a nice nose, but the taste is straight up boring. Boozy bourbon with a light charred, peaty flavor. Still a decent amount of vanilla and oak. The beer itself is the problem with the taste. The taste follows the nose for the most part, but all the dials are turned down to a three from what were eights. All subtlety is lost behind the booze. Really disappointing and certainly not better than average. 
3.5 M: The mouthfeel is indicative of what is problematic with this brew. A 13% barleywine had me thinking thick, velvety, and rich. Having had Parabola a few times, I figured that was the route this would go as well. Instead, this has a medium body and a moderate creaminess. Seems like the potential malt flavor went away with the potential heavy body. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. 
3.5 D: Totally disappointed. I loved the hell out of Parabola and thought this would be the barleywine version of that. It isn't. Not quite sure how this is getting the scores it does. Maybe bottle variation. Who knows? Not confident this will age well, but I have another bottle and I'm going to give it a go. 1,821 charactersDavoleBomb, Jul 12, 2011

A - dark chocolate body with an off white head on top. The head perks up when it is swirled but then dies back down
S - Sweet caramel notes, smells like stick toffee. The barrel aged notes mingle really well with the base beer. Noticeable but not overpowering
T - A nice beer for sure. Sweet, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, hints of vanilla and oak from the barrel but doesn't overpower. The barrel aging is really well integrated and doesn't overpower but rather adds another layer of complexity. 
M - pretty heavy, thick, syrupy a little bit of carbonation
O - A really nice beer. The barrel doesn't dominate but makes its presence known. Crazy smooth for the ABV. I mean 13% really? I would never know. A really nice BA Barleywine for sure. Not the very top of its class but does belong near the top. 861 charactersjpmclaug, Jul 12, 2011

S- It's a sweet malty blend, with hints of vanilla and bourbon. I do get some straight alcohol, along with some molassas and figs. 
T- This beer is everything I look for in a bourbon barrel barleywine. It is very smooth upfront, and transitions to a very complex flavor of hops and bourbon. Brown sugar, molassas, vanilla, and oak dance in my mouth. The hops are perfectly balanced.
M- Pretty stupendous. It does have a bit of carbonation, but I like it. It helps keep the beer from being to syrupy. Very tasty, and an amazing aftertaste.
O- Overall this is one of my favorite beers I've had in the last year. I've had some of the more popular BBBW's lately, and this one definitely stands out to me as at the top. Going to need to stash some of these away.

A thick candy apple caramel maple concoction. My ABV detector is going off. Molasses, cherry, this one smells great.
Yes! Sweet vanilla and chocolate and chewy caramel, raisin with only the faintest hint of hops. 
The hops linger a bit more in the finish. Alcohol is apparent at this one, I was guesstimating 14%. Could probably use some time in the cellar.

A: Amazing deep amber hues with some yellowing at the edges. Great carbonation out of the bottle and the lacing looks like a Gallagher show, just mess everywhere, in a good way.
S: There are sweet hot notes with cinnamon and dark fruits. It’s tough to take in with nutmeg and some sort of hot currant smells going on. I usually hate barley wines but this smells nothing short of amazing.
T: Just wow, this is the best barley wine that I have ever had. There is an amazing great hot finish with sweet licorice and figs. The heat rolls through and finishes a juicy plum note.
M: The mouthfeel isn’t too heavy and really impressed me. Again, I really dislike this style in all its iteration and if this is this good now, I shudder to think what a couple years would do to a 2011. The coating has a great finish with deep dark turbinado sugar and nutmeg. In short, it is very complex.
D: This is scary drinkable for 13% abv. I shared this with some friends and they all demurred and preferred their Pliny, which, for good reason I can understand. But for a beer this huge, its tough to argue with. The interplay of all of the elements at once feels like a Mars Volta record where you aren’t sure how they did it, but you are satisfied to be left in the dark as long as it tastes amazing. This is exceptional and well worthy of the hype.
Narrative: Tyler Folsom was a nice person. Sure he was a 4 sport athlete, donated time on weekends to explicitly blind orphans, adopted 5 shelter cats, ran makeshift sickle cell anemia cure test centers in his garage, and had a laundry list of acceptance letters to a litany of schools, but, he was a nice guy. Some would say that he had too much on his plate. He never knew what was going on with Pretty Little Liars, his record collection was woefully wanting for a 17 year old guy, but somehow, his rough translations from Aramaic to Latin to hexidecimal for a new kernel that he was debugging made it all worth it. “Oh sure, we could run scripts under English syntax, if you want spaghetti loops in your DLLs!” He exclaimed in a rare moment of tension while nursing a Koala deftly. “But ultimately, if the kids don’t eat, I don’t eat.” He meant this literally. He had adopted Peter Singer’s theory of ethics and regularly starved himself for days on end, still outperforming all other student athletes. “It’s basically just about being a NICE GUY.” He noted as he put the finishing touches on his double fermented 4Loko batch that was 0 calorie and 0 carb, a gift for his friends for an upcoming soiree against teen inebriation. 2,621 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jul 08, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Stone Imperial glass. Dark redwood or Mahogany colored and pretty hazy. Highlights are a bright amber. Head is one finger and creamy tan in color. Lace is minimal, probably due to the high ABV.
Smell is bourbon barrels in your face. Huge amounts of sweet caramel malts, and some spicyiness from either the alcohol, or maybe some molasses. I get maybe some tobacco and wood. Did I mention the alcohol? 
Taste is hugely complex. Extremely sweet from the malts. A lot of those barrels come through with vanilla, and bourbon. The sweetness comes from blackstrap molasses as does some of the spiciness. The ABV is integrated perfectly. There is a subtle warming sensation on the back of the throat. I am not getting any of the coffee or chocolate that were promised on the box.
Mouthfeel is sublime. This is the bar by which all others should be judged. Perfectly carbonated. The bubbles dance all over your tongue and mouth. It is smooth, rich, and creamy. That alcohol is there as well, just as well integrated as ever.
Overall this beer was worth the wait. I am very happy that I have another one to cellar for awhile. I am sure that it will only grow in complexity over time. Everyone should do whatever they can to get ahold of one or better two, or three...you get the idea. Thanks to matttYCE for picking this up for me before it was sold out. 1,363 charactersazdback, Jul 07, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Im splitting a room temp bottle with fish113d. Poured into a snifter the beer pours a clear mahogany hue with very little beige head and only the thinnest of edge layers remaining in the glass.
Aroma is big with figs, prunes, red grapes, general hot booze, some caramel and molasses. I dont get any real hop presence, but this beer doesnt hide the fact that it is a heavy hitter.
The first sip reveals a thick heavy brew with very minimal gentle carbonation. 
Flavor is as the nose advertised with fgis and plums dominant with some molasses and a bit of caramel mixing in. The booze is warm on the finish as this one doesnt hide the "umph!" on each sip. I definitely put this in the sipper category but it is thoroughly enjoyed as well by this malty beer drinker.
The hops dont really show up anywhere and this is driven by the malt profile. I enjoy it and wish I had a 2nd bottle for aging. 891 characterssulldaddy, Jul 04, 2011

S: It smelled like strong vanilla and oak and toffee, with some coconut and chocolate and oranges.
T: It tasted like sweet caramel and orange and rich chocolate, with vanilla and dry oak and toffee and a bit of coconut. It had a smooth and dry sweet aftertaste that lasted quite a while and had a some alcohol warming.
M: It was thick and viscous with a little carbonation. Very full and fantastic body.
D: This was a fantastic barleywine with huge bourbon influence, but great hops and malts too. The scent and taste were clean, bold, and complex while the body was wonderfully huge. The alcohol was hidden decently for its strength, so I had to use some restraint to sip instead of gulping this treat. It could age well, I'm sure, but it was excellent fresh. A top beer that meets the hype. 867 charactersPencible, Jun 30, 2011

Aromas of vanilla, oak barrel, sweet caramel, biscuit, dark fruits and moderately phenolic. Flavor is sweet toast, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, oak barrel, vanilla and significantly phenolic.

Aroma is brandy soaked dark fruit. Mildly sweet with generous alcohol heat. Slight woody notes.
Taste is sweet caramel malt and toffee up front. Rich dark fruit - notably raisin and date. mild Smoke quality. There is also a strong oak character with plenty of spicy oak notes and vanilla. Finishes with a more dark fruit and alcohol heat.
Mouthfeel is medium-full. Thick and viscous.
Overall a very flavorful experience. Intensely fruity and boozy. Dark fruit, oak, and alcohol heat come on strong. A wonderful beer. 608 charactersBlakaeris, Jun 30, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had the opportunity to taste this in the quiet of day 2 of 38 degree's barrel aged week. It was the first beer of the afternoon and the one I was most excited to try (since I haven't been able to score a bottle!)
My experience with Firestone Walker barrel aged beers(Parabola) and their worthy other efforts--Velvet Merlin, Union Jack, Double Jack, DBA...led me to expect greatness.
It was great, but in comparison to a Firestone Walker 14 right after, I could tell that this one needed a year or 2 to reach its potential.
First, the appearance was on the money...little carbonation...nice dark syrup....
Smell was a bit sweet, with some tobacco in the background
Taste..like brown sugar, a hint of tobacco and a beautiful warm alcohol aftertaste (definitely complex that should get better with time)
Mouthfeel was the beginning of greatness...not as smooth as I wanted it to be, but again...a year will make a difference with this beer
If only I had one to age!
Thanks to my local beer bar 38 degrees for having this on tap! 1,033 charactersunseenbyyou, Jun 30, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Most def a top tier beer. Very fortunate to have got 2 bottles...much moreso appreciating that now that I'm diving into my first. Probably the best Barleywine I've ever had. 2007 Bigfoot the next best but not really apples to apples, and I'm sitting on my 2010 Midnight Sun Arctic Devil for a few more months before opening that.
A - Darkest of Ruby Red - excellent 1 and 1/2 finger head from a semi-aggressive pour. lacing pretty good in the tulip glass it's poured into. Slim to no activation in the tulip which led me to want to give a 4 but what barrel aged beer has much activation??? Still - 4.5
S - WOW! Just WOW! Toffee, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, sweet bourbon but not at all overpowering. As it warms the dark fruits come into play, plumbs and raisins specifically. COMPLEX!!
T - See the smell. Matches it to perfection. The only reason the smell gets a 5 and the taste gets a 4.5 is because after you get past the first 12 ounces, it starts to become a little (I don't want to say tooo sweet) but sweet. This should mellow out with age. 
M - Pretty spot on but I could have used a wee bit more carbonation but that's just getting picky with a beer this high in quality, especially for the style. Still though..my only real complaint was that it could have used a little more. Sticky but not at all syrupy. A crafted masterpiece with a barleywine at this ABV. Alcohol at 13% noticeable but WOW, drinks like a 10% and I will kill this bomber no problem on my own. Having a pretty big grin at the end of this bomber on my face of course...
O - Highly recommended. Never had a better Barleywine. This really is a sipper. One to open for special occasions. Would not want to drink this beer all the time, savor for a treat.
Now, to conclude, let's talk about balance. This beer is still relatively fresh. Bourbon and alcohol heat this recent from the barrel should be more overpowering. It's pretty mellow. one year, maybe a year and 1/2 should be about the perfect age I'd imagine with this. Well done FW. You've nailed the Barrel aging program above all else I'd say. (Although I've yet to open my BCBSRare) but until then, I'll give you the nod. Well freaking done! 2,182 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Jun 29, 2011

Churchill's Pub & Grille
San Marcos, CA
A deep copper and auburn with golden edges. Little carbonation and nearly no head. 
A mind-blowing, exceptionally good smelling beer. A wonderful combination of vanilla, oak, caramel, citrus, sweet and dark fruits, and just a touch of warm alcohol presence. Tremendous! When is Firestone Walker coming out with this in a spray-on cologne?
A sweet barleywine with lots of cherry and orange flavor, as well as vanilla and an oaken earthiness from the barreling. It all comes together remarkably well, and is certainly the easiest beer to drink I've ever had of this strength. While still a sipper, this one finds it's way to my lips so often because I can't stop sniffing it. A marvelous effort and a very special beer.
Medium to thick beer, a touch oily, though it isn't a problem at all with a beer this style. A fine sipper.
An incredible barrel aged barleywine. The aroma is one of a kind and out of this world, while the flavor is close behind! Bravo! 1,014 charactersehammond1, Jun 28, 2011

Smell - Complex hints of vanilla, malts, bourbon, and more. I couldn't count the smells in my head that I had here.
Taste - Numbers of flavors hit you all at once. I couldn't calculate it. Then it calms down and I taste a little raisin, oak, and bourbon. Flavors start to smooth out as you drink this over time. 
Mouthfeel - The frame is perfect... nice and smooth.
Overall - I can count on this beer at all times... 519 charactersdvsbizzyb, Jun 28, 2011

A- Dark copper around the edge of glass, mahogany appearance in glass. Very little lacing and almost no head.
S- Dark fruits, caramel, oak, bourbon, vanilla a perfect blend of aromas.
T- Bourbon and caramel malts, dark fruits and a hint of dark chocolate. Vanilla and oak also apparent in the middle with a slight alcohol burn at the finish, although I don't mind the burn as much as other high abv beers.
M- Medium bodied, velvety with low carbonation. Alcohol tingles the tongue a little in the aftertaste.
O- Absolutely amazing beer! The flavors come alive and have a beautiful blend that can only be described as wow. Can't wait to see what this tastes like in a year or two. 711 characterskawilliams81, Jun 28, 2011

A: A slightly cloudy brown with a cream collar and some lacing.
S: White chocolate macadamia nut, nice bourbon and wood character, and bananas.
T: Strong caramel and toffee notes, sweet but not cloying, refreshing bourbon on the finish with lingering wood character. Otherwise, everything is as you'd expect from the aroma. Not too shabby.
M: Thicker and creamy, which after a while slightly breaks to the alcohol, and then returns to a linger.
O: Pretty good. Not outstanding, but instead a solid beer. 533 charactersne0m00re, Jun 28, 2011

A: Pours a dark cherry mahogany ale. Less than single finger of light tan head falls to a broken sheet of the same. No lacing. When agitated, head replenishes and then falls once again. 
S: I like the way this smells. Sweet vanilla, nougats and caramel. Some hints of cherry. It reminds me of a white chocolate Idaho Potato Cherry flavored candy bar, if you know what I mean...
T: Plenty of sweet butterscotch, vanilla, oak, cherries. The alcohol is a bit hot here. The taste profile is less than impressive, but with a year or two on it, presuming the toffee tones in the malts would come thru, this would be world class. As it warms, the alcohol continues to have more and more presence, not cool.
M: A bit thin for the style IMO. Carbonation is moderate and persistent, not bad, would prefer a little lower. 
O: I think this is a nearly exceptional barley wine. I might pick up a few more just to age them, but I have less than high expectations for this to continue to excel. It will either thin out and fail to build the smooth feel I really appreciate from good BW's, but then again, you never know. I'm nearly on the fence with this. It's good, but not terrific. 1,187 charactersharrymel, Jun 26, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Surprisingly dark. It's a mahogany brown color with very little head. What little head there was seemed to be a whitish color. No visible sediment or haze. 
S: Caramel, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and oak. Hints of butterscotch and molasses as well. Smells absolutely incredible. 
T: Wow butterscotch, toffee and caramel. Malt city, but with toasted oak, vanilla, bourbon and alcohol heat prevalent as well. Flavor would be perfect with a hint less alcohol burn. 
M: More carbonation than I had anticipated for a high ABV barleywine. Good medium-bodied beer with ample moderately-sized bubbles. Moderate to light viscosity for the genre (but it's possible that's an illusion from the carbonation). 
O: Very tasty overall beer. I thoroughly enjoyed this and wish it wasn't $18 a bottle and extremely rare. Glad I got to try it on my birthday. 846 charactersjnn4v, Jun 25, 2011

S: A lot of chocolate, considering they call this a barleywine. After a while I pick up on some of the barrel aromas like vanilla.
T: Good depth with the malt character. The chocolate and barrel flavors are very present. Not balanced too well, but I don't care, it's too good. I love it.
M: Nice and tingly on the front of the tongue, but thick and creamy on the back. Not bad.
O: I'm drinking this side by side with Parabola, and I have to say, I think I like it better. But maybe not. Great beer regardless. 583 characterskerklein2, Jun 25, 2011

Smell is full of carmel and dark fruits, with a hint of vanilla. Very pleasing.
Taste is very close to the smell, with the fruits coming forward a bit but the carmel flavors lingering. The barrel balance on this beer is amazing, and probably one of the best I have ever had. Nicely carbonated with a hint of alcohol burn in the finish.
If tasting this blind, I probably would not say "barleywine", but never mind. This is a treat. 507 charactersdrummermattie02, Jun 25, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.52011, poured from a bottle into a snifter.
A - Pours a dark ruby brown with a little clarity through the top when looking up at it. Thin cream head disapated rather quickly.
S - Could smell this one right as I opened it. As soon as the bottle depressurized, I smelled bourbon and caramel. As poured into the glass, get notes of toffee, dark fruits, roasted malts, aroma of good bourbon, and can almost smell the booze knowing this will be a big beer.
T - This is delcious. The bourbon brings a heat to the taste that lingers throughout, but balanced with some dark fruits, smidge of vanilla, toffee, oak, cherry. Has some sweetness in the front to balance out the hot bourbon and booze taste which seems to last long enough to let that initial bourbon kick die away. I really like how the tastes play with each other, very complex taste and ever changing with the drink getting warmer. Bourbon becomes more pronounced as it warms, making a more bold but welcomed taste after the introduction the colder flavors gave. I stand by my first sentence.
M - Little hot and heavy from the bourbon. But I didn't expect this to be light. The cheeks become nice and saturated with the bourbon, a great feeling when drinking a beer that is aged in good bourbon. But as far as drinkability, this becomes a little more of a sipper once it warms up.
O - This to me is an amazing barleywine. Great job of kicking the tastes up to extreme levels yet keeping the body restrained a bit to account for the barleywine. This beer is coming in a little hot right now, and should be amazing with about 1-2 years on this, but I for one welcome that bourbon. Love the lingering taste and complexity. 1,678 charactersScrumtralecent, Jun 24, 2011

Wow what can I say? A beautiful tawny brown, garnet highlights, and a slight beige head that lifted exceptional aromas of figs, currants, a heavy caramel back, and vanilla. Touch of woodiness is apparent in the background but the vanilla is all over the palate. A very balanced mix of dark fruits and malt complements the sweet vanilla. Carbonation is perfect; it melds the rich body of the beer and the sweetness into a smooth and velvety feel. A strong sipper that renders the unwary into a head trip. Delicious. 553 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 20, 2011

4.12/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance -- Pours a rich dark brown with a slim beige head. Looks good.
Smell -- Bourbon, oak and vanillin, toffee and dark fruit. Very rich and complex. The alcohol is fairly pronounced, and the bourbon takes up more of the profile than I would like, but still very impressive.
Taste -- Dark fruit are more present than in the nose. Woody oak, vanilla, roast malt, bourbon, and raw sugar sweetness. The alcohol is very evident. Lingering flavors of dark fruit, burnt sugar, and vanilla.
Mouthfeel -- Medium-full in body with milder carboantion. Pretty much perfect for the style. However, I had to dock points for the intense alcohol harshness.
Overall -- Pretty damn good. The flavors seemed well-integrated, but man is this beer hot right now. Give this a few years and I'm sure this will be drinking magnificently. 824 charactersyeahnatenelson, Jun 20, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4So this is like my 6 or 7th solo bottle of Abacus in the last month or two, i got alot of it and figured i'd get around to a review at some point, i guess it's that time.
First off a quick note, it seems like there is some differance in the bottles, some bottles are rich and full with great bourbon tone, warmth, and depth of richness, and some bottles just seem hollow and shallow overall. it is split about 50/50 or so, just want to point that out. This bottle i'm drinking now is one of the better ones, even though im sitting in a 85f room without AC drinking a 13% BW, i'm really digging it. Anyway...
Color is a rich decadent mahogany hue with an antique tan colored head fading to a collar. 
The aroma on this bottle is excellent, The bourbon had strength to balance and cut through the luscious caramel, and there is woody notes of oak and the barrel acting as a canvas that the other aromas build off of.
On the palate this is great, not as exceptional as the aroma, but that is probally my preferance as the heat is more integrated in the flavors then aroma. The richness of caramel is allowed to take the lead role with some maple and toffee whispers and the bourbon, while perceptable, plays support, along with the barrel and wood which pokes more on the finish.
The body has some viscosity to it yet is not near syrupy thanks to the 13% keeping it clean.
I dig this BW, and i am always undecided what to score it given the bottle variation i have experianced. Bottles have honestly ranged from A+ though C. I guess Abacus is like a box of chocolates, never know what your going to get.
Update: !!!
12/18/11 this beer has lost some richness of caramel flavors and toffee, the heat has not faded out at all, and lost some depth. This one was best fresh, Fo Sho. I still have 3 more bottle to drink, will report any further changes. 1,847 charactersChadQuest, Jun 19, 2011

This beer has a nice vanilla aroma. I can also detect some chocolate, and some dark fruit notes. The alcohol content is well hidden in the aroma. A mild bourbon aroma is also present.
This beer tastes much like it is spelled. Vanilla up fromt with a slight chocolate and fig flavor. Alcohol is not overly noticable in the flavor either.
This beer is full bodied and low in carbonation. It leaves a vanilla bourbon aftertaste. The alcohol warms a little on the way down.
This beer wouldnt make a good session beer. It is high in alcohol, and aggressive. It is a sipper.
Overall: I love barral aged beers, and this one ranks up there with the best. Firestone Walker does some amazing stuff with barrals. 812 charactersOStrungT, Jun 18, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I would love to say that this was a "got" but it basically only sat in my "beer fridge" long enough to cool down after a long summer's drive home. Enough idyllic sounding stuff, how about a review?
Poured this into a nice tulip and gave it a chance to sit. Pours a nice ruby/caramel color. Pretty much a standard look for a Barleywine. 
Definite Bourbon in the nose (as is to be expected from a Barrel-aged barleywine). Tiny hint of alcohol but, once again, Bourbon barrels...no shock here. Wood, candy sugars, maybe a bit of vanilla. 
Mouthfeel? Nothing overwhelming.
Taste is where this brew absolutely kills. Balance like nothing else - something I've come to almost EXPECT from Firestone Walker. Just when you think you might get overwhelmed by sweetness, the Bourbon kicks in and manages to mellow out in seconds. 
All pretentious beer reviewing aside, here's my plain old opinion: I go with barelywines in the fall almost as a rule just because of the intense alcohol and full bodied flavor. I'm almost afraid of when the 13% catches up to me because frankly I don't taste it. This is just a fantastic brew hands down. Highly recommended to even those who aren't into the "bourbon aging" or "barleywine" scene. 1,221 charactersemsoud726, Jun 18, 2011

 Letting it warm in the glass brings aromas of caramel, vanilla, fig pudding and brown sugar.
 Taste is superb, sweet malt, very brown sugar, overripe figs or prunes.caramel. There is a warming alcohol (%13!) that leaves the mouth dry but wanting more. A sipper, but what the hell, I've got a whole glass and this baby is going down nice!

4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have been anxiously wanting to try this brew since its release to bottle back in March, so tonight I finally decided to stop waiting for the perfect occasion to share with a group and just dive in to a bottle solo. A rough pour into a Maudite snifter yielded a solid two fingers of dense tan foam which receded fairly quickly, leaving spotty lacing on the sides of the glass and coalesced into a fine outer ring of bubbles. The beer was a deep rich ruby red, much darker than most barleywines I've had before. The aroma was full of sweet vanilla and toffee, with a sweet booziness to it along with toasted oak and coconut. My mouth was literally watering with anticipation.
The taste was an incredibly balanced blend rich toffee, caramel, molasses, slight cherry and bourbon laden toasty malt. This is definitely one of the most well-rounded barrel aged barleywines I've ever sampled. The mouthfeel was exceptionally smooth and creamy, full bodied with light carbonation. The 13% ABV provides a hearty warmth to the finish, but it is by no means overpowering or out of place. Overall, this is an incredible brew. 1,115 characterssurlytheduff, Jun 17, 2011

A- This BadBoy pours a deep dark murky brown. Similar to Angel's Share. Had a 1 finger head that dissolved rather quickly into nothing. No ring and no lacing.
S- The smell of bourbon, vanilla, caramel and raisins prance their way up your nostrils and finally reach your olfactory glands which cause instant euphoria.
T- As I partake is this masterpiece, the sweetness of the caramel and malts hit you up front. There's an alcohol burn on the back end that's pretty Intense. As the beer warms, the burn intensifies. Kinda bothersome.
M- This is medium bodied and very smooth. You can feel the alcohol as the beer warms.
O- Had this BadBoy twice with different results. The first time, the smell and taste completely blew me away. It was a perfectly crafted beer. I had this again a few days later and it was totally different. The smell was the same but the taste was dominated with alcohol and it only intensified as the beer warmed. I'm going to try this again in the future and re-review it. As of now, this is still a must drink beer if you haven't tried it yet. 1,179 charactersDevi0us, Jun 16, 2011

Poured into a Bruery tulip, this is actually my second go around with this beer. Pours light brown, with a small amount of head that goes quick. The nose is really great - brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, oak and maybe just a hint of spice. I spent some time with that. Yum. The taste is really, really terrific. A barleywine that hits the sweetness just right. Caramelized brown sugar, vanilla and a nice amount of oak meld perfectly. Not at all too sweet, but with a big punch of flavor. Just fantastic. Then it does this amazing thing - in the finish, the spirits build a bit and then it just disappears off the tongue. The word that was used was ethereal. I have never had a beer almost evaporate away, and just at the right moment too. When I had my first bottle right after it came out, there was too much oak tannin in the finish that knocked down a peg an otherwise fantastic beer. Right now, the oak is back in balance and is just phenomenal. If you are hanging onto one to age and haven't actually had the beer, don't bother. It is just about perfect right now and I am not sure you want to tame what is already in perfect harmony. Stock up.
EDIT (9/3/11): I'm forced to revisit this review after having my 3 bottle. I had one before the review above (right after release, in bottles) and I am now having one. The first bottle was way too oaky. The second bottle was perfection. This third bottle is really different than either of the other two. It tastes more like one of the anniversary blends than what I remember from before. It has chocolate notes, and in taste only, tastes like there is some BA imperial stout blended into the BA barleywine. 
I don't know what to say about this beer. It has changed a lot over the past few months since it was released. I have several more bottles and I am eager to track them. My reviews are:

4.31/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into a Jester King Grand Opening snifter
A: Carbonation on the low side. A small cap appears and quickly fades leaving a thin ring which pretty much disappears after a while. No lacing is evident. Pours a deep reddish-brown hue.
S: Astoundingly complex. Bourbon, oak, lots of vanilla, chocolate, caramelized sugar, raisin, apple cinnamon and coconut. Wow.
T: The roasted sugar and chocolate appears first closely followed by vanilla and oak. The bourbon (and a nice portion of warm alcohol burn) comes last…pretty cool. I think this is gonna taste phenomenal with a year or more on it. I absolutely intend to find out.
M: Fairly viscous and perhaps a bit less carbonation than I would personally prefer but enough to tickle the tongue. The alcohol creates a lovely warming feeling.
O: I’m glad I got this review out of the way. I’ve got several more bottles of this that I can now sit back and enjoy and share with others, but I’ll probably wait till the cooler months. Can’t wait! 1,015 charactersmjtiernan, Jun 13, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 Vintage
A: Poured into my FW Pint glass, this brew pours a wonderful, deep burgundy. The head isn't strong enough to last even a minute, which is very displeasing. I expect more in a barleywine.
S: The aroma is more complex than any barleywine I've had to date. The malt adds notes of chocolate, dark toffee, oak, vanilla, apple cinnamon all with a splash of bourbon.
T: The flavor follows suit. Chocolate and toffee coat the pallet. Rich oak/vanilla tones follow. Bourbon is in the background ever so lightly. Alcohol is evident, but very well hidden.
MF: Mouthfeel is good without being incredible. Possibly one of the only flaws, I would have liked a thicker body to this brew.
Overall, Firestone Walker always impresses me with their brews. Another offering that I just love. This one will definitely age with the best of them. I can only see this beer gaining in complexity over time. 899 charactersTKEbeerman, Jun 13, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz Bomber. Bottled 02/18/11. Poured into Tulip.
Pours a very dark but clear reddish-brown. Produces an initial beige head that quickly dissipates to a medium ring. Minimal lacing.
Barrel notes are apparent in the aroma but are really nicely blended and don't overwhelm. There's the smooth oaky vanilla wood, but also a solid dose of hot buttered rum. Breathe hard enough and the alcohol becomes apparent, but not as strong as you might expect.
Taste is initially quite sweet, but never reaches an annoying level. Port wine and brandy in the middle and the end gets quite dark and smokey. A good blend of rum raisin, coffee, and milk chocolate ice cream. Some tobacco notes and a light whiskey finish.
Body is medium-full and carbonation is nice for this style. Sipping is imperative, as is a glass of water on the side, but the beer is quite drinkable, and I'd say that for 13% the alcohol is incredibly well integrated in the flavor.
I suppose this is the only bottled "Abacus" we'll ever see. Looking forward to what it's called next year. 1,048 charactersbrotherloco, Jun 13, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a dark, cola brown with ruby highlights, nearly opaque when held to light. A careful pour produces a half-finger of tan head, quickly dissipates to a thin film. 
S- Smells very boozey (whiskey), caramel sweetness and vanilla, has some faint chocolate and dark fruit (figs, prunes) notes. Lots going on.
T- Incredible. A big wave of bourbon is the first thing I notice, very alcoholic with some sweet fruity flavors. Oak and vanilla. Towards the end it melts into a sweet, syrup-ey, chocolatey flavor. The alcohol stays on your palate for a while with more dates, figs, raisins. 
M- Full bodied, medium carbonation, leaves a sticky, chewy feel on the palate. Alcohol is very warming, it's definitely a sipper.
O- A really outstanding beer, I've never really had anything like this. There's enough going on to keep the bottle changing and interesting the entire time. I bought two bottles and can't wait to break out the second one in a few years. 958 charactersWillCarrera, Jun 12, 2011

A: Thick black oil-like color, no light seen through this. Small, if any head, that dissipates quickly.
S: Smell has a slight alcohol/bourbon scent, and hints of sweetness. 
T: Sweet at first, as if there were syrup in it, which quickly gives way to a oakey coffee flavor. as it loses temperature, turns to more of a coffee flavor. Slightest hint of alcohol in the backbone.
M: Medium plus body, with hints of alcohol as you swallow. This beer has a nice feeling in the mouth, and finishes much smoother than one would think. 
O: Very good barleywine, which tatses less than the actual ABV, but leaves you feeling nice once the glass is finished. overall a good specimen, would definately try again! 813 charactersSidebordz, Jun 12, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -4.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This pours deep mahogany with a small, half finger khaki head rising and falling with no lace. On the nose there are big notes of dark fruits, oak, vanilla, and ethanol. The fruits like raisins and figs definitely provide the basis while the oak and vanilla are more of a frame that the rest of the nose sits inside. In the mouth those same flavors come out with a larger emphasis on the ethanol, though it's never overpowering. The bourbon is definitely a compliment rather than the center stage. It's there for sure, but bourbon doesn't have a fig character that really sits in well with everything else. The body is chewy, viscous, and large with a long finish, the oak and booze giving a dry sensation as time passes.
Overall, this is a fine, fine beer, no doubt. It's a great example in my mind of how bourbon barrels can enhance rather than overshadow a good base beer. That said, for the price I'd probably rather buy a 6 pack of Bell's Third Coast Old Ale. But as an occasional splurge, this is pretty great. 1,017 charactersEricCioe, Jun 12, 2011

S: Bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel, a little generic alcohol fumes.
T: A very restrained bourbon barrel barleywine. Certainly plenty of flavor from the bourbon barrels, but nothing abrasive or hot about this offering. Lots of oaky vanilla. Rich malt backbone.
M: Silky smooth medium-heavy body. Just a pinch of heat in the finish. Appropriately carbonated.
O: One of the best bourbon barrel barleywines out there. 507 characterscallmemickey, Jun 11, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks goes out to mikesgroove for sharing this one during Hobo Tasting #9! Served from bottle into a Duck-Rabbit snifter. Poured a deep dark brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, and booze. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, caramel, dark chocolate, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The booziness on this one definitely started to show its face as it warmed up. A very nice flavor on this one. I was worried I wouldn't like this one as much based on the aroma alone, but the flavor was very nice in comparison. Really glad I got the opportunity to tick this one! 786 charactersthagr81us, Jun 10, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Extremely complex, powerful, and gentlemanly, this Barleywine carries a plethora of flavors but without the heavy body that's normally associated with the style. Warm body with amazing drinkability sets this one apart.
Deep garnet in color, the beer allows for only the most supple of light to announce it's ruby-like glow. Low carbonation, the beer forms a creamy light head that disipates early in the session- seemingly very port-like.
A potpouri of aromas erupt from the glass, with the shape of maple, toffee, chocolate, plumbs, grapes, figs, walnuts, oak, bourbon, sherry, vanilla, cherries, and currants- the independent notes seem endless.
Sweeter malty notes show in flavor first with the maple syrup, toffee, vanilla, and chocolate. Very savory and succulent before the alcohol ushers in the powerful flavors of bourbon, rum, cherries, berries, light coffee, mild toast, and oak. Late flavors of alcohol and fruit bring about the strong estery notes and balance of oak, walnut, and bitter alcohols.
Rich and sweet early, the low levels of carbonation allows the full weight of the beer to rest on the taste buds- seemingly heavy and chewy. But the beer's thinning alcohols lighten the brunt of malty character and give a warm and numbing effect on the mouthfeel. Powdery woods and mild tanins give balance late for impressive dryness and palatable weight.
A world class barleywine that makes a statement with intense alcohols and a remarkably dry finish and smooth variety of flavors. Where a mystery flavor seems to emerge with each sip, so does the intensity of alcohols that seem to distract from time to time. This the only reason to keep it from top scores.

T: There's so much going on. I'm speechless. Great, rich mouthfeel with notes of vanilla, caramel, coconut, toffee and butterscotch. There's a slight warmness, but this hides the alcohol pretty well.

A - A very dark brown color with mocha-colored head. The head did not have good retention however and dissipated quickly.
S - Bourbon and vanilla with a little smokiness to it. Great aroma that is expected of a barleywine.
T - One of the sweetest barleywines I have had. Vanilla-ish chocolate flavor and bourbon. I did not know the abv beforehand and I would not have guessed that it is 13% as it leaves no dirty alcohol aftertaste. 
M - A little heavy but incredibly smooth. Packs a lot of punch considering its abv, you can feel the warmth going down your throat.
O - Fantastic barleywine, probably best I've had so far. Strong flavor that is not too offensive. 688 charactersbbb099, Jun 07, 2011

A: A dark burgundy that lets the slightest bit of light through. Very little head that dissipates very quickly and leaves NO lacing. A very pretty color, but a bit nondescript otherwise. Still, this bodes well.
S: The slightest hint of roasted malt, but that is obscured by the heavy notes of chocolate and vanilla. A bit of oak is there too. Very well-balanced, but slightly on the sweet side. Hard to find the booze that I know lurks in the bottle. Another good sign...
T: Wow. Vanilla vanilla vanilla. Although strongly vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, and an underlying foundation of roasted malt and oak. Very good. The booze is so well hidden that it's hard to discern, even though I'm looking for it. As it warms it gets better and better, with hints of caramel and the slightest beginnings of a traditional barleywine. Absolutely fantastic.
M: Nice and heavy bodied. Thick and caramel-y, with an incredibly smooth finish. One of my favorite parts of this beer.
O: It's hard to describe how much I'm enjoying this beer. A great beer from Firestone. I'm glad they finally bottled it. I'm going to be searching for more. 1,158 charactersmjyoung, Jun 07, 2011

A: Dark brown, nearly black with a finger of tan head. 
S: Bourbon, bourbon and some bourbon. There is a little vanilla, but really just alcohol and bourbon.
T: Follows from the nose, hot bourbon and some vanilla. I really wanted this to be a bit sweeter, but it just is not there. 
M: Smooth, silky, easy drinking at the high ABV
O: I had high hopes for this beer and while it gets a good rating, I was hoping for just a touch more sweetness and a little less bourbon. By comparison, Alpine Great blows this away in terms of sweetness and complexity. 599 charactershamilton23, Jun 07, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Bell's tulip.
Pours a deer raisin brown with light tan head. Surprisingly great head retention for a barrel aged beer.
Smells of bourbon, vanilla and sweet malts. Strong caramel aroma that seems to last forever. Finishes with a biscuit like sweetness and more bourbon.
Tastes of bourbon soaked raisins with a complimentary backing of vanilla and caramel. Another explosion of sweet, biscuity malts with a touch of anise. The balance and flavor are beyond words.
Mouthfeel is soft and creamy. With all the bourbon and sweet flavors this somehow manages to stay medium bodied. The balance is perfect to say the least. It's also adequately carbonated. The 13% abv has no bearing. The beer is so delicious and well balanced, I didn't even notice the alcohol.
Overall this is one of the best tasting and and well balanced beers I've had up to this point. The barrel aging takes it to another dimension. As opposed to dominating, the bourbon serves as the ultimate compliant. Rich, smooth and absolutely delectable. Simply stunning on every level. 1,081 charactersdgugliuzza, Jun 06, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep brown with some dark amber hues. Little head on this one, but some suds form as I swirl it around in the glass. Little lacing on this one, but it looks syrupy. 
Aroma is big on the sweet malts, brown sugar, raisins and other dark fruits. I'm surprised by the presence of the bourbon and vanilla too. Although this is a barrel aged beer, I was completely expecting the barrel qualities to be masked behind the massive malt character. The flavor does a beautiful job combining the oaky/woody/vanilla qualities of the barrel with the sugary, dark fruit characters of the base beer. The malt is relentless in this beer (as expected for the style). This beer feels very silky on the tongue with a sticky, sugary caramel finish. Moderate carbonation with very little alcohol presence, even at 13%.
Truly impressed by this beer. 836 charactersmuttyd, Jun 05, 2011

4.89/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The tulip glass provides a nice, thick off-white head on top of th beautiful, burgundy body. A bit hazy, with bits of malt floating around in the glass to reassure that this is gonna be a no-holds-barred sort of brew. Aromatically flawless. Cinnamon raisin bread in scent, kind of. Malts out the ying-yang.
The short version of the nose: Extremely malty, but with a hint of alcohol to provide complexity. In length, it's a sexy combination of dark plums, brown sugar, coffee, and bread that I can't even truly defined. Unbelievable balance in the complexity, and so potent that it's impossible to miss any scent. Each compliments the other in a way that's almost indescribable.
As if to mock me, the flavor is identical. A thick, thick, creamy body carries a wave of malt on to the tongue, with brown sugar and dark fruits being the most obvious flavors of the bunch. Hints of vanilla, brown sugar, and cinnamon round off the palate, giving this beer an overall sweet feel. As if not to feel one-dimensional, though, it finishes with a warm kick of hops that heats up the back of the tongue and lingers for sips-on-end, right to the last drop. Complex, delicious, amazing. This is close to God in a glass.
Overall/notes - I can't be a Jedi, because tonight I experienced a love so passionate that I can't describe it. Lovely beer all around, with only one or two equaling it, and none surpassing. This goes well a good, dark cigar that sweats. Recommended on those special days where you feel as if your life is going in the perfect direction. My God. 1,554 charactersbbkd3b, Jun 04, 2011
3.98/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Bomber split with some friends and poured into a snifter. It appears a dark amber brown. When held to the light, it shows ruby clarity. A tan cap forms across the top and fades leaving patches of lace across the top and on the glassware. A swirl revives a fingers worth of revitalizing head.
The smell of this brew is dark and fruity with alcohol esters. Coupled with the sweetness of the toasty caramel malt and smoothness of barrel aging creates vanilla notes that are quite enjoyable. As this brew warms up, there is a faint spiced aspect which reminds me of something like cinnamon. Overall not bad.
The taste is bold with fruity alcohol and toasty malt. The flavors blend into a sweetness of vanilla from the barrel aging. Herbal hops are quite modest and linger long into the aftertaste with an almost resinous oily cling typical of a more hoppy brew. Throughout the tasting experience, I found myself looking for more but the flavors of this brew are quite simple and forward.
This is a bold fruity alcohol forward barleywine that is hurt a bit in drinkability. It is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Clearly a decent representation of the American style with it's modest hop inclusion. The alcohol is not hiding in this brew at all, it is forward in both flavor and warming factor. It is a solid brew but I was let down a bit. Perhaps my anticipation and hype built this brew up to something more magnificent than it ever could be. Oh well. I have wanted to try this beer for some 2+ years since I first heard about it. Along the way I got to try a small draft sample and that just didnt satisfy my curiosity. I just about gave up hope of ever getting a real taste (since it was at the time draft only.) Then the announcement came that it was going to be bottled. Perhaps a bit fresh at the moment, I intend to revisit this one with some age. 1,859 charactersstakem, Jun 02, 2011

A.
Beer is a deep dark brown with some ruby highlights. Head is pretty much non-existent, but was expected for a barrel aged barleywine. 
S.
Aromas of sweet caramel, vanilla, and bourbon dominate the nose. I can pick up some slight oak and fruit to this as well (cherries perhaps?). The booze might be a little too strong in this, however it still has a solid aroma. 
T.
Pretty much similar to the nose but fruits are a little more prevalent. Almost port-like but not as sweet. Bourbon is very smooth. Was expecting it to be very "hot" but pretty tame and expected for the ABV. Still a big beer being 13%.
M.
About medium bodied. I'd prefer it a little thicker but it's still a sipper..definitely a warming sensation but not lip burning. Carbonation low but OK for being a barrel aged beer. Has a slight syrupy feel to it but not so sticky and sweet that it's a chore to get through. 
O.
A good BA barleywine but I've definitely had better. This is the second time I've had it (first time I've had it as the first beer of the night) and I think it could definitely benefit from a little aging. As it is now, one person would definitely have some work to do to make it through the whole bottle. Even sharing this with someone else is taking awhile to drink. Not really readily available but I managed to get a few bottles from downtown. 1,365 characterscetherid, Jun 02, 2011

4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle provided by jodan, thanks Jordan!
A - Pours a dark brown with deep red highlights to it, like the color of rosewood. It is hard to see through, but carbonation can clearly be seen streaming from bottom to top and clinging to the glass. A one-fingered, tan-colored head eventually forms, but it fades quickly. Lacing, likewise, clings precariously before falling apart and sinking back into the liquid.
A - The nose on this just screams malt and barleywine. This definitely packs some sweetness to it, as well as alcohol. The bourbon is smooth but it's forward, and the alcohol does pack some punch as well. The barrel is apparent too, giving off a lot of vanilla and especially oak. I'm also getting a bit of fruit in the back-end, with cherry pits and grapes that gives it an almost sherry-like quality.
T - The flavors of Abacus are really influenced by the barrel, as the oak gives a strong wood flavor. The vanilla and bourbon are also noticeable at the very front, and the fruits moved up to the front. As it warms I'm really getting some of those dark fruits that last well until the end. The malts come next and they give off a sticky caramel note, as well as some milk chocolate. Unfortunately, the alcohol comes through quite strongly in the finish and ends the great flavors on a solventy note.
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy-bodied with good carbonation. A little bit syrupy but the flavors and carbonation keep it moving easily. It's fairly smooth, and the lasting impression is alcohol-soaked fruits.
D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. This beer is interesting as the bourbon doesn't punch you in the face, but the 13% at the end sort of does. While the fruits really take this to a new level, the combination of them with the solvent alcohol burn at the end is a bit of a turnoff. Still, it's a great beer that has a nice barrel-aged profile, but don't be surprised when this beer bites back. 1,960 charactersnhindian, Jun 01, 2011

A - Chocolate-mahogany, with deep red highlights. Head and lacing is minimal, but a ring of nougat-colored suds is present throughout.
S - Vaniila, oak, and bourbon on first whiff, then dark cherries, cocoa, and burnt sugar on successive sniffs. Very aromatic, with a sweet caramelly smoothness tying the different scents together.
T - Early on, the first chilled sips are heavy on bourbon and vanilla, and a slight nutty character from the malt. After that, the beer really opens up, revealing cocoa, molasses, French roast coffee, and fine port wine. Buttery caramel, soft dark fruits, and tart cherries in particular rise in the finish and become stronger as I drink, as does a pleasantly warming booziness.
M - Appropriately silky and creamy for a barleywine of this stature, medium in body and moderate in carbonation, but not as decadent as it could be.
If this is what Firestone can do with a barrel-aged barleywine, then my anticipation for Parabola is spiking into the stratosphere. I enjoy the anniversary blends, but I think beers like this really showcase this brewery's mastery of the barrels. 1,187 charactersAJacob81, May 29, 2011

A brown liquid with a reddish tint. Less than half a finger of slightly off white head. Nose is malty with caramel and toffee notes. Obviously it's a barleywine so carbonation is non existent. Taste is right on with the smell. Big toffee and caramel notes. Almost like a coconut on the finish. Basically a tasty damn liquid candy bar. Very happy to try this. 392 charactersTheDudeRules, May 29, 2011
4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer is very dark and has a minimal head. It leaves no lacing or legs. Not that impressive, but who the hell cares how this beer looks. The aroma is great, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, coffee, chocolate, and oak. There is a slight alcohol burn, but it is not too apparent. The taste too is great. Surprisingly light and nuanced for such a big beer. Great oak / bourbon presence. Good chocolate, caramel, molasses, and toffee flavor. Firestone Walker really knows how to use -bal aging to enhance a beer instead of taking it over. Mouthfeel is smooth and approximately medium bodied. Mild sweetness, but nothing that overwhelms the palate. Drinking a whole bomber of this by myself was not as difficult as I thought it might be. Does not get heavy or cloying. Really well made beer. 787 charactersAgold, May 28, 2011

Pours a dark brown/plum color, when held to the light the edges are burnt orange and dark yellow...a little bit of light tan head forms, somewhat soapy looking and recedes to a haze...
Smells of wonderfully warm and sweet bourbon, the barrel aging is very prominent. Sweet, caramel, molasses and vanilla with a bit of oak and smoke, but the bourbon takes the forefront...
Bourbon. Booze. Heat. But still smooth and tasty. Sweet and malty, caramel, vanilla. Barrels. Some dark fruits add a bit more sweetness. Finishes hot.
Full bodied and lightly carbonated. Thick and creamy, very smooth. Tons of lingering alcohol heat...
Not bad. Aromas were wonderful, taste was a bit too hot and one sided, but still pretty good. 797 charactershawks10, May 27, 2011

great look here with a nice hazelnut brown color and a smooth and even head of light tan that really seemed to show quite nicely how well it would be.
aroma was to die for with rich vanilla tones, tons of barrel and just a huge oaky and caramel presence. this was a monster for sue. it seemed each sip became more complex then the one before and soon i was totally sucked into its workd and just beaten down. nice light feel , a bit different then what i would have thought but overall i think it was quite nice.
an outstanding ba barleywine for sure! 688 charactersmikesgroove, May 25, 2011
4.06/5  rDev -9%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bomber into my Kentucky bourbon barrel ale snifter. 
A- pours a brown dirty color and settles into the glass as remarkably dark blackish brown. No head at all, just the faintest suggestion of wispy khaki smoke rings on the surface. Absolutely no lacing at all. 
S- there is lots of alcohol in the nose with sweet caramel wood also. Deeper in there is vanilla and some whiskey. Very aromatic
T- rum and liquor infused chocolate. Wood and sweet vanilla remind you of it's barrel and a definite alcohol heat and taste reminds you of abv. A little hot
M- smooth and medium bodied. A touch under carbonated. The alcohol makes a slight harsh tingle on the swallow. Not to bad for the abv. 
Overall an interesting beer that stretches the barleywine style. Flavors are very strong and make you notice them. The alcohol takes away from the experience and definitely needs to be toned down. 899 charactersKelly88, May 25, 2011

A - Pours a amber brownish-red color, light carbonation, thin collar, some whisps on top.
S - Candy sugars, fruit, smooth booze, no real alcohol heat. The sweetness and smooth booze is exactly how I want my barleywine to be. For 13% and fresh, I can't believe it's so smooth.
T - Burnt sugars, caramel, fruit, smooth booze. The alcohol is there, but not "hot" at all. Very smooth, rich, and adds to the overall enjoyment. The fruity sugars and caramel are excellent as well, not overly sweet, just right.
M - Medium, smooth and rich, light carbonation.
O - Excellent barleywine, in my book. The smooth alcohol, sugars, and sweetness were just right for me. I can't believe how smooth this is right out of the gate. Looking forward to seeing how this one ages. Recommend. 881 charactersSean9689, May 23, 2011
4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown with light red highlights thin light brown head with no retention or lacing. Strong boozy bourbon vanilla and oak aroma. Molasses and alcohol up front mwllowing into the bourbon vanilla sweetness. Balancing hops and alcohol with a light sour and clean finish. Silky smooth and robust feel with light fuzziness.
I’m very torn on this one. I usually like a challenging barleywine and this is so smooth and easy, especially for a beer with 13% abv. There’s a very strong warming but it’s very pleasant without a trace of burning. The flavor is strong and clear all the way to the end but it’s hard to call it really complex. It’s not a chore to finish nor difficult aside from the abv but it did get almost boring. Fantastic as a single glass so the bottle is definitely something to share. It certainly wasn’t as deep or dark as “Black Swan” (my movie pairing of choice) but it is certainly as mentally debilitating. 942 charactersBriken, May 21, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow what a great beer. Pours a dark tawny port with the faintest wisp of a head which quickly departs, poured this gem at about 55 degrees into a tulip. The nose hits you with a complex mix of rum soaked raisins, figs, buttery caramel, rich toffee, slightly smoked oaky vanilla with a classic fortified wine oxidized/rancio note, really impressed. The taste brings a mouthfilling richness with almond roca, toasted coconut candy, dark caramel and finishes with a satisifying mouthcoating oilyness and just enough carbonation. There is a slight note of alcohol at the end but for being 13% it is barely perceptible at that degree. I really wanted to like this beer before i opened it and often i think i set myself up for failure with such high expectations, abacus though did not let me down. 792 charactersTrilogy31, May 21, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Aroma:I really like the aroma. It smells of caramel, sweet malts, dark fruits like figs, and a little bourbon.
Appearance:Pours a deep mahogany color. Nice head, but quickly dissipates. Great lacing.
Taste:The flavors are well balanced and subtle in this beer. The foretaste consists of sweet malts, and mild dark fruits. The bourbon makes itself known in the midtaste, and lingers on into the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel:This beer has a thick body, with good carbonation, and a bunch of alcohol warmth.
Overall:I really enjoyed this beer, it's really well balanced, and a great sipper. It reminds me a lot of sipping on a nice bourbon. I believe this one should age really well. 677 charactersfear025, May 21, 2011

A: Pours a clear dark red with thin light brown head that dissipates rather quickly.
S: Tons of delicious aromas, toffee, oak, vanilla, alcohol, chocolate and bourbon in one amazing melody.
T: Wow, insanely smooth, ridiculously rich and delicious. Similar to the aroma but with less alcohol, tons of sweet caramel malt, vanilla, oak and toffee with surprisingly not much detectable alcohol for a 13% ABV barrel aged barleywine. Perfect.
M: Smooth, full bodied and creamy with very little heat and lower carbonation. This is awesome.
O: One of the best barleywines ever, this is absolutely fantastic! 669 charactersAzurescens, May 21, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my monster 22oz snifter.
Appearance: One half finger light tan head on top of a dark ruby/light brown body. Nice lacing around the edges.
Smell: Dark fruits, chocolate, some booziness, not a lot of hoppiness. Some barrel aging is apparent. A lot of sweetness.
Taste: Bready, no bitterness to be heard of, some booziness. More complexity in the nose than the taste. Some dark fruits poke their head out at the end of the sip. Given that it is 13% the booze is hidden relatively well but it is still apparent.
Mouthfeel: Light carbonation, thick.
Overall: Solid beer. Not quite sure why there is all the hype around this beer, its not bad but not the best barleywine I have had by any stretch of the imagination. Given the ingredients and the taste this should certainly be classified as an English Barleywine. I can have a good quantity of a lot of different beers but there is no way in hell I would be able to finish a whole bomber of this one in one sitting. 977 charactersOddNotion, May 21, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Clear but dark brown. When held to the light, it is a reddish brown. Light tan foam.
Smell: So complex, and amazing. Spirits, oak, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit and toast. Nutty and bready. Complex malt and oak.
Taste: Strong malt taste with lots of complex barrel flavors. Bourbon, vanilla, coconut, and lingering malt complexities. Nice toasty malt with a strong dark fruit flavor, but finishes dry enough. Maybe some hop bitterness helps balance the intense sweetness? A lot is going on, and frankly I am just overwhelmed.
Mouthfeel: on tap, so the carbonation is okay. Drinkable, but strong and more of a sipper.
Overall: I bought some bottles, I can't wait to compare. I wish I could have bought a whole glass. 730 charactershotliquor, May 18, 2011

A: Pours a dark red/brown with a small off-white head that fades to a ring and leaves no lacing on the glass.
S: The nose is amazing...full of vanilla, molasses, dark fruits, charred wood, and toffee. Smells like an Englsh Barleywine more than an American one.
T: The taste is just as good as the smell. Big flavors of vanilla, toffee, dark fruits, charred oak, a touch of molasses, and a hint of hops. 
M: The feel is thick and a bit undercarbonated. You can get some carbonation if you chew the beer in the mouth but it's not nearly as creamy as it should be.
O: This one is tough to rate. The nose and taste are amazing...2nd only to MoaS in my experience. The carbonation issues detract from the beer slightly though. I also think this is more of an English Barleywine than American...unless the barrel aging has significantly muted the hops. Still damn tasty and I'm glad I have a few more to drink over the next year. 955 charactersGregSVT, May 18, 2011

A: Pours a brownish-burgundy with a very thin film of tan/ivory head that dissipates down leaving very little lacing on the glass.
S: Smells warm with bourbon, vanilla, raisins, with a carmel and toffee sweetness. Stronger alcohol tones were present as it warmed.
T: Caramel sweetness that is overtaken by the boozy warmness with each sip. The vanilla notes helped to tame down the alcohol presence, but regardless this is one highly superior Barleywine.
M: Very heavy with flavor, and moderately syrupy as it warms up. Good carbonation presence, and enjoyable lingering warmth.
O: This is one of my favorite barleywines. The complexity in the flavor is one that I have grown to love with each bottle I've had.
Aging a few, can't wait to try the next! 816 charactersLuvzsurfrz, May 16, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my Thomas Hardy snifter, the Abacus is an attractive rootbeer brown color with fairly good head retention and decent lacing. The nose on this bad boy is very, very attractive, showcasing considerable brown sugar, caramel, light chocolate, rum raisans and vanilla. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this sweet boozy beer, though right now I think the sweetness and noticeable alcohol detract just a bit from the enjoyment of this beer. Mouthfeel is full, with a long, smooth, sweet and boozy finish. Drinkabilty is fairly good, though I get a bit of heat on the finish from the 13% abv. 
An excellent beer and one I think will probably improve with time. Hopefully, I'll get to find out.
Edit from 3/14. Bier Stein recently had a 4 year vertical in honor of the 2014 release. The best of the bunch was easiiy the 2011, though none of the years were exactly awful. The current rating is based on my review of that vintage, now that it's 4 years old. 969 charactersJohn_M, May 16, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This beer is nice, but it was really young when I had it on tap at the Sunset Grille in Boston in April. I think maybe it's a little overrated at this point but it's definitely good. 
A: Maroon colored with light brown highlights, no lacing and a very small head that dies quick. 
S: Complex notes of fruit and cinnamon with a nice edge of the bourbon barrel. Some vanilla, dates, and nutty pecan like smells as well. Interesting and nice. 
T: Very complex with plenty of bourbon whiskey and bright alcohol character to it that hits first. Fruity with dark dried fruit, dates, plums and a little brown sugar on top. There appears some bittersweet notes at the back of the palate after the initial bourbon sweet and savory attack. Leather persists. This is great now but will be better later. 
M: Way too hot right now, and a little too medium in feel but I give it the benefit of the doubt because of how coating it is. 
O: This will be great with age. Said the same about FW 14th, we'll see about that. Looking forward to having a bottle in 2 years or so. 1,061 charactersDreadnaught33, May 16, 2011
3.9/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a dark brown with good translucence. Head dissipates fast leaving no lace on the glass. Body is striking though, with reds and browns everywhere.
Nose is complex but understated; wood, caramel, sweet sugar, a bit of molasses, and maybe a touch of vanilla are what I get, along with some light fruit. All those aromas combine to form a potent amalgam, which ends up with a bubblegum note as a result too.
Taste is ok at the start, with light melon and mellow malts coming out. However, as the beer moves to the finish an intense vanilla caramel butterscotch ice cream flavor dominates - it is fantastic to be sure. Alcohol is just barely in the background and utilized well.
Mouthfeel is smooth and slick with a bit of coating left in the mouth after sips. Body is between medium and full and is just enough to hold up the taste. Drinkability is fine, but the finish is so rich and fully flavored that it gets tough to down after a bit. Still, great beer. 963 charactersveinless, May 15, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle, courtesy of stx00lax (thanks, Jacob!), into a CCB snifter (and a goblet for my girlfriend, who will be copiloting on this review).
A - Pours a very dark amber, with only a bit of light making it through the edges when held to the light. Not much in the way of a head, which is expected given the high abv. Just a thin ring of bubbles around the edge. For what it is, it's nice looking.
S - The barrel certainly makes itself known right off the bat -- it's strong and forward in the nose, and gives it a slightly boozy aroma that works well with the burnt sugar and vanilla notes. I'm not getting much else, but I really like it so far.
T - Wow. Lots of strong toffee and caramel notes, vanilla, and toasted almond. And plenty of bourbon. I can't place what it is, but something reminds me of german chocolate cake, only without the chocolate. And then there's a bit of the oak in the finish. Fantastic.
M - Smooth and creamy, good carbonation, and just a little heat from the booze at the end. 
O - Firestone continues to impress with their Reserve series. Parabola was and still is one of my favorite beers, and this one is almost that good. Certainly one of the best barleywines that I've ever had. Another reason that I wish I still lived on the west coast. 1,278 charactersdjmichaelk, May 15, 2011

S- Vanilla, sweet syrupy bourbon, sherry, coconut, dark fruits , caramel, and candied sugar. Superb smelling
T- Wow!!! This is even more amazing than I ever thought. Taste follows the nose. Vanilla, sweet bourbon, dark fruits, candided sugar, coconut. I wish I could describe the wave of flavors that I am experiencing. It is a beautiful beer. Not a hint of alcohol which is amazing as well, just a slight warmth that is very welcomed. Easily a 5. Nothing can be improved on this.
M- Low carbonation from the barrel aging which produces a creamy mouthfeel. Viscosity of it is nice also. Great
O- One of the top beers I have ever had. Amazing beer worth the hype and praise. Also worthy of its price. Have four stored away for aging and special occasions that I am looking very forward to. Cheers 938 characterst420o, May 14, 2011

Poured into Stone Double Bastard glass. Deep ruby colored body. the body is rather clear of sediment. 3/4 finger sandy head is set atop momentarily, works its way back in short order. A good amount of lacing clings to the wall of the glass. 
The aroma is absolutely stunning. Very rich and well integrated aroma. Gooey caramel and bready malt provide a sturdy base. Dark fruit and oak fill out the aroma behind. An assertive chocolate smell lingers through out separates Abacus from many other Barleywines I have enjoyed in the past. Vanilla and soft bourbon meld into the aroma as a whole.
If I am impressed by the nose I am blown away by the flavor. Each scent picked up in the nose is intensified on the tongue. Rich bready malt, toffee and caramel coat the tongue. Bourbon and oak flavors develop as the beer head towards the midpalate. Again a chocolate characteristic is noted. While it may not be common for the style the flavor seems to be right at home here. The flavor gains layers as it moves back rather than replacing previous. The deep dark fruit flavors and subtle and sit on the back of the tongue. Smooth vanilla flavor ebbs and flows through out though gains intensity towards the back of the palate. 
Full bodied Barleywine, carbonation is low. Rich, syrupy, luxurious mouthfeel. The flavor digs in deep, leaving a long and enjoyable finish.
Absolutely stunning beer. Without a doubt my favorite Barleywine. The flavor shows amazing complexity and integration. There is a bit of warming booziness but it adds more character opposed to becoming abrasive. Very smooth overall, a definite sipper. Flat out awesome beer, great work FW. 1,713 characterskzoobrew, May 13, 2011

S - A bit of vanilla and bourbon. 
T - Wow....with the smell of this i thought it was going to be quite boozy. This beer is perfectly balanced. The bourbon stays around for the whole pour. I get a bit of oak as well. I cant believe this is 13%. Very good job masking the alcohol with everything else in here. 
M - Perfect. Very smooth considering the ABV. Very little alcohol burn. A little syrupy. Slightly dry.

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage.
Aggressive pour yields a minimal tannish head that recedes quickly. Clearish garnet-amber body. Laces decently.
Nose is vanilla, rich vanilla, and bit of oak? There's probably more here but allergies are preventing me from getting the rest of it.
Taste is fantastic; wouldn't be out of place in a top-tier imperial stout, the same vanilla from the nose, some subtler oak and a a faint bit of hops for a clean finish. Faint coconut aftertaste. Oaking has really taken the edge off of the hops to let everything else shine through.
Mouthfeel is nice and creamy; it would be easy for this to get syrupy otherwise.
This tastes fantastic, but one for sipping and sharing. I could see it with creamier cheeses (brie) and raspberry. Could also pair with steak. 772 characterszaphodchak, May 12, 2011

Appearance: Deep ruby tones throughout a dark brown to black body. Pours a nice one finger beige head that fades nicely into a thin lacing on top.
Aroma: As soon as I popped the cap, huge notes of brown sugar, molasses, vanilla bean, milk chocolate and bourbon all just explode. Considering the ABV, there is not much alcohol burn in the nose, but near the end of the glass I did begin to detect some. Nicely balanced and integrated.
Taste: The big bold aromas translate perfectly into thee taste. Caramel, molasses, and brown sugar all provide tons of flavor and balance. This beer is incredibly sweet, but manages to keep away from being cloying. Vanilla bean, coconut, and milk chocolate notes all support the sweet malt notes of the beer nicely. The bourbon is really nicely integrated and completly avoids any harshness while contributing plenty of flavor from the barrel. Flavorful and balanced incredibly well.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and a tad syrupy. Plenty of carbonation for the style/
Overall, possibly the best barleywine I've ever had. Incredible balance and great integration of the barrel really set this beer apart. I only wish I had a couple more bottles. 1,297 charactersGosox8787, May 11, 2011

D: For 13% this is crazy drinkable. Mouthfeel is viscous and syrupy. There is little heat, so I don't think this can benefit much from cellaring, but I'm going to put one aside anyways.
Overall: Excellent brew. Well worth the asking price. This should be savoured like a fine cognac and should be shared with great friends. Recommended! 772 charactersJohnnyChicago, May 09, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured out a reddish orange color, minimal head. And thanks to jh1982 for breaking this out after the baseball game, super cool. Aroma was rich, sweet, a little boozy.
Taste, not boozy at all, jeez, I think I liked this better out of the bottle than I did on tap. Talk about hitting the nail on the head, caramel, sugar (brown?), light hopping, wood, caramel, vanilla, what seems like a white chocolate type of vibe, everything possible to absorb alcohol heat, at 13% this was very decadent, allowing lots of flavors, but completely immasculating the alcohol. Phenomenal. You know its a good BW when you start to think to yourself, "oh shit, can I really rate something higher than Bigfoot, my favorite barleywine for 15 years running?" I dunno, we'll see how the numbers play out. The fact I can get 3-4 as much Bigfoot for the $ I guess hurts this overall score relative to it.
Just amazing mouthfeel, pick up all the tasting notes, but also, a slickness, glides off the palate, comes and goes without an aftertaste backlash. This stuff is excellent now, makes me a little leery about aging it. Can it really get any better? 1,128 charactersBeerandraiderfan, May 09, 2011

The complexity shows in the nose. It resembles bourbon with the oak and vanilla tones. There's also a brown sugar sweetness and I even pick up some coconut. 
The taste doesn't depart much from the smell and it's delicious. Vanilla, wood, brown sugar, candied fruits, coconut and toasted coconut. It's highly complex. 
The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. There's very little carbonation, which is good in this case. 
It drinks like a high end bourbon. Very smooth and complex. The high abv is prevalent but necessary in a drink like this. It's a sipper. Take your time and enjoy. 697 charactersVonerichs, May 09, 2011

Wow the nose, I pick up cocoa, vanilla, oak almost nutty smell. Great smell on this one, everything blended together.
Taste follows the smell, great vanilla and cocoa taste on front of tongue. You get some heat on top of tongue with smooth velvet like coating down the throat. Aftertaste of oak and nice dry finish keeping you wanting to sip more.
Overall I messed up not picking up more bottles of this gem of a beer. Can only imagine with another year what this will taste like. Does not taste like any barleywine's I have had, but who cares with this symphony of taste and smell this beer makes work. 750 charactersMiloHoP, May 08, 2011

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A room temperature bottle poured into tulip glass. Pours a dark somewhat clear brown, with lighter orange at the edge of the glass. Barely a quarter of a finger of head with a vigorous pour, but quickly dissipates to nothing. Lots of alcohol legs along the edge of the glass as you swirl the beer. Surprisingly a few bubbles can be seen at the edge of the glass, with such a high abv beer, any carbonation is a bonus. 
Nose is impressive. A warm brandy like alcohol aroma brings caramel, sweet dark fruits, toffee, chocolate, vanilla, tannins, and oak, all well blended together into a treat for the nose. At room temperature, the alcohol just allows the aromas to explode out of the glass without overpowering with booziness.
Taking a sip, the taste doesn't stray far from the nose. Alcohol warms up your tongue, then toffee, caramel, milk chocolate, dark fruits, and a sweet rum like quality explodes. As the beer lingers on the tongue, the barrel characteristics come through, vanilla, toasted coconut, and burnt oak comes through. Very warm going through your throat from the high abv, though. With a little bit more age, this should be almost perfect. 
Medium bodied, with a hint of soft carbonation, enough to prevent this beer from being a sticky mess on your tongue. The finish goes on forever, mainly the barrel characteristics and a touch of toffee. For such a big barleywine, this beer is not overly sweet at this point, so the blend is meant to be enjoyed soon after release. 1,490 charactersnataku00, May 07, 2011

Aromas are spicy and bready up front, with some butter. Beer then settles into notes of deep dark fruits, booze, vanilla, and hints of oak.
Taste is sweet and boozy up front. Nutty and creamy, with sweet dark fruits, vanilla, coconut and oak. Finish is warm, with earthy hops, and crisp dry carbonation.
Mouthfeel is good, full up front, but a little thin on the finish,
Overall, an excellent beer. I can really tell that this was a base for 10, on it's on it stands tall. This is a delicious beer, you just have to like sweet booziness. 626 charactersflexabull, May 07, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a dark crimson red/dark brown with a very, very small tan head that fades to nothing. The head came out very fizzy, much like a soda. No lacing whatsoever on the drink down. The smell coming off this beer is absolutely fantastic. Caramel, toffee, butterscotch, brown sugar, cherry, coconut, earthy woods all come out of the glass. I spent about 5 minutes just smelling this beer before I even took a sip. Not surprisingly the taste is out of this world. The first taste that I get is toasted coconut. This is followed by sweet caramel/toffee, candied cherries, and very subtle hints of chocolate. There is an aftertaste of some woody notes from the barrels. This beer has a good level of carbonation which I think helps it from being too thick and cloying. This is by far the best barleywine I have ever had. The 13% ABV is really not noticeable at all. The aromas and flavors mesh together amazingly well. I have 2 more of these in my cellar and I can't wait to see how these age. I am going to seek more of these out for sure. 1,034 charactersUCLABrewN84, May 06, 2011

A - An almost opaque, dark ruby pour only letting light in the top and bottom 1/8 inch of the glass.
S - a Very dark nose with smells of syrupy whiskey. Oaky sweet malt and vanilla. Has an almost buttery sugar sweet aroma. 
T - A big bite of dark, oaky bourbon barrel hits the palate. Sweet, dark bourbon syrup. A buttery charachter from possible diacetyl additon. Slick dark sugars on the tongue. The dark sweetness here balances the oaky whiskey bite.
M - A very smooth, very slick mouthfeel. Still wondering the addition of daiacetyl to slick the mouth? Possibly but either way, a nice wet and smooth ride down the throat. 
O - For a barrel aged beer, this one is pretty smooth and properly balanced. Im not a whiskey fan but I wasnt overpowered by the ammonia-like whiskey bite. A nice smooth mellowed dark beer. 898 charactersBeerForMuscle, May 06, 2011

Bottle poured into a snifter.
A: Appears deep brown with ruby highlights. Beige head is frothy and rises one inch above the liquid.
S: Intoxicating blend of caramel, toffee, and brown sugar. Prominent wood notes. If you were to take an axe and fell a sapling I think it would it would smell a bit like the wood aroma in Abacus. This young wood note was most apparent around the 55 degree serving temperature, but when I allowed the beer to warm and open up a bit, it finally gave way to notes of bourbon. At this warmer temperature, the blend of vanilla, bourbon, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, wood, fig, and chocolate is absolutely stellar, and immeasurably complex. Alcohol is faint and does the beer credit.
T: Rich caramel malt with robust toffee and brown sugar notes. Quite sugary and sweet, with a decided candied quality on the palate. Bourbon is apparent yet not at all dominating. Nicely done. Alcohol is very well hidden here. There's an upper low level of bitterness as well, with a faint earthiness.
M: Upper medium to lower full in body with upper low carbonation. Mouthfeel is sticky and silky, with substantial alcohol warming on the palate.
Overall: An exceptional bourbon barrel aged Barleywine. 1,228 charactersHopHead84, May 05, 2011

Appearance: (3.0)
- Pours a dark ruby brown which as far as I can tell, is clear.. not cloudy. Very quick fizzling light brown bubbles which practically vanished and left what looks to be a port in the glass. Can't say it's an overly pretty beer. Guessing this aspect will be the beers low points. Nice thin oily film in the glass.
Smell: (4.0)
- Fig, prune, esters hit the nose. Thick sweet raisin molasses and brown sugar with a sweet malt presence. Little bit of alcohol, but not much. Overall this smells like a wonderful sweet desert beer. 
Taste: (4.5)
- Caramel and molasses come to mind at first.. then a blend of vanilla, earthy oak, burnt brown sugar, and prune show themselves. Very tasty, sweet, and balanced. Not overly loaded with alcohol flavors. Perhaps some earthy and grassy hops. Finishes with a nice spicy touch. 
Mouth Feel: (3.5)
- Not as thick as I thought it would be. Plenty carbonated, just doesn't leave any head. Slightly chalky and sticky. Somewhat chewy and drying. 
Overall: (4.0)
- Overall this is a killer barleywine. Has a wonderful array of flavors and a desert-like quality that can be rare in such a style. Overall not the prettiest beer, but is quite nice and a bomber worth sharing with some fellow beer advocates! 1,271 charactersDocer, May 04, 2011

A - Pours deep brown with a thin film of white head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lacing down the glass. This was served WAY too cold. Once it warmed up a bit it got a little better.
S - Smells of warm bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, tobacco, and chocolate sweetness offer some contrast to the typical caramel / toffee sweetness in most barleywines. The heat began to creep in more and more as it came to room temperature.
T - Lots of toffee sweetness up front quickly giving way to a mix of bourbon heat, tobacco, chocolate, and vanilla. Finish is a mix of sweetness and alcohol burn, lingering for some time. This one is still a little raw but I can see it developing over the next few years into something amazing. I need to grab a bottle of this one as soon as I can.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. It was pretty thin at the beginning but it really developed once it warmed up into a rich, creamy, feel with plenty of lingering sweet heat in the finish.
O - Very good beer. It is still pretty hot at the moment but it is still a very easy drinking barrel aged barleywine. I am really glad I made the long trek down to Capone's to try it. 1,309 charactersorangesol, May 03, 2011

S- Strong amount of oak, Bourbon, sherry, sweet brown sugar. Cigar tobacco. maybe a hint of cherry and grapes. Maybe a bit of smoke.
T- Very sweet get that grapie or cheery fruity flavor. Lots of brown sugar, or something sweet. Almost a cognac flavor, hints of a traditional barely-wine. Lots of oak at the beginning that is with the sweetness. the middle does have a chocolate malt flavor but much more caramel.
M- Chewy, good amount of carbonation, good amount of prickly going on. It is nice, a little more refreshing and not as over overpoweringly heavy as a remember.

Appearance: Pours very dark brown. Some red highlights appear when held up to the light. About a half finger of off-white head, which faded very quickly.
Smell: Wow, a lot going on here...notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, and caramel. The bourbon is probably the most dominant smell, but it's not so over the top that it beats everything else into submission.
Taste: Just like the smell, the taste is very complex. Starts off with some sweet caramel when a little oak and vanilla comes into play. A little bourbon hits the back of the tongue, but it isn't nearly as noticeable as I thought it would given the smell.
Mouthfeel: Slightly thick with below average carbonation, which works perfectly for this beer.
Overall: I could have this beer over and over and it would never get old or boring. Crazy complexity and an abundance of excellent flavors.

S: sweetness was just jumping out of the aroma consisting of caramel, molasses, whiskey, dark fruits, oak, and vanilla to name a few but with mild brown sugar notes as well.
T: the vanilla caramel molasses notes were more potent on the taste with oaky dark fruits notes, a bit of boozy whiskey character and a touch of sweet creme brulee flavor.
M: the brew medium to full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, boozy, mild fruity, oaky, and silky, sticky finish.

4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Have to say this a beer I've been meaning to try for awhile so I was a little worried I had overhyped it in my head. Let's just say I had nothing to be worried about.
Poured a very dark brown almost black hue that was almost totally opaque. Have to say there was no head at all from a very vigorous pour but you can't expect much from a 13% beer that spends almost a year in oak.
Aroma was a very enticing mix of grapes, sweet alcohol, and dried dark fruits. 
Taste was extremely complex. There were notes of coffee, dried fruits like raisins, chocolate, vanilla, oak, alcohol and a nice bitterness from the hops. It was incredibly smooth and mellow for all the flavors going on. Nothing overpowered.
This one is definately a sipper. Sticky thick mouthfeel that coats the entire mouth with every drink. The high alcohol is definately subdued and I was able to finish the entire bottle by myself. Selfish? Maybe a little bit! This beer was definately one of the best beers that I have drank in awhile. 1,004 characterssnpub540, May 01, 2011

A- Abacus appears darker than the 1st time I had it on tap with a pretty much black deep dark brown appearence. Some redness with light shining through. A sparse cap of mocha cream colored foam leaving semi streaks.
S- Smell is wowzers, they really mean bourbon barrel when they say it. Heaven Hill barrels times three years imparts a bunch of oak and vanilla and bourbon. Big time malts, cocco powder, coconut, and some alcohol.
T- The bourbon is smooth with vanilla and slight coconut filled in with oak and alcohol. The heat and alc, comes out much more with warming hindering drinkability alot. Toasty mats big time with caramel sweetners somewhat. Yup!!
M- Very full and rich in taste, somewhat coating. The heat towards the end is unavoidable, drink quicker to avoid this. Besides the heat the flavors do not linger much.
D-o- A slow sipper, not something to take lightly, 13% is alot and it shows. FW knows their way around a barrel. 3 years is insane yet this remains a balanced beer and not a booze bomb. 1,081 charactersBARFLYB, Apr 30, 2011

4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle, allowed to warm before being poured into my Duvel tulip.
Abacus pours surprisingly dark for the style, it's almost stout black. One or two cherry spots do shine through when the beer is held to light though. The khaki colored head is thin and disappears quickly without a trace. The nose is heavy on bourbon (albeit good, smooth bourbon), with toffee and vanilla in the background. Each sip brings forth a fantastic blend of toffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, toasted coconut, and bourbon. No one flavor consistently dominates, every time I bring the glass to my lips any one of these flavors is liable to steal though. If I had to nitpick though I'd say that the bourbon is just a little too boozy right now. The body is full and rich and creamy, without becoming over the top or lending a cloying sensation to the beer. That may be at least in part thanks to a surprisingly active carbonation that feels quite fine on my tongue. It helps give a life to the beer that is lacking any other opposition to malty goodness. Bottled Abacus is quite good at this still young point in time, but it doesn't quite reach the subtle excellence of both the draft version and what I think bottles will turn into in a few years. 1,226 charactersaxeman9182, Apr 29, 2011

Appearance: Served in, yes I know, my Sierra snifter, Abacus pours thick and heavy, with a glug and a gurgle- the sound of good things to come! Nice one-finger head, very impressive for a barrel-aged brew. Poor retention, though, with the head dying soon and only a white rim and a mantle left. Color is the customary black with brown overtones. 
Smell: The wood is beautiful... so subtle and smooth. Vanilla pods of the highest quality, shipped fresh from Madagascar. High-quality bourbon, sugar, a tad of melted caramel at the end. White chocolate. Some spice. Unlike many reviewers, I do not detect any booziness. This is mellow and delicious. Reminds me of Goose Island Vanilla Bourbon or Goose Rare... yum yum! A total treat. Hardly the smell of a barleywine, though.
Taste: Caramel, wood, bourbon, sugar. Toffee, hard candy. 
Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth. I mean it. Let me say it again: smooth... fuck fucking yeah. This beer caresses your throat and tongue like the best pussy out there. Full body and flavor, low-and-perfect carbonation. Woodsy and creamy. Delicious and enticing. Well-balanced, only a hint of alcohol at the end.
Overall: I never expected this to be so disgustingly good. They say it is a barleywine... hardly. But whatever it is, oh dear god it is delicious! Smooth and outrageously drinkable, enticing and engaging, just rightly sweet. Woodsy, bourbon-y, beautiful. Seriously, for a 13% brew, this is immensely poundable and delicious. Need. More! 1,595 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Apr 26, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Big thanks to ericfb18 for the delicious brew(s)
A - Pours a shiny deep cola brown, close to black, with an obvious viscosity. It is capped with a short-lived khaki head that quickly recedes to an encircling collar.
S - The nose is a fantastic assortment of caramelized sugar, creme brulee, candied fruit, amaretto and other cordial liqueurs, vanilla, cinnamon, wood, whisky, and straight-up decadence.
T - The taste is more of the same deliciousness suggested by the nose: buttery oak, notes of rich maple, vanilla, whisky, chocolate, roast barley, dark candied fruits, figs, dates, molasses, creme brulee, jaggery, cinnamon and absolute deliciousness. It could perhaps use a bit of time before it ripens (and loses a bit of heat); if time treats this well, it will be one of the most delicious beers *on Earth*.
M - The feel is silky and softly effervescent for (literally) hours. Not J.W. Lees territory, bjt quite good.
O - This is a phenomenal brew. Thanks Eric. I want more. 985 charactersktrillionaire, Apr 24, 2011

After breaking into this beer a week after purchasing it, I almost have to mourn the fact that I won't see it for another year. Thanks, I guess. --
At one of my local haunts, beer-master Al pulled me aside and mentioned he got a case of Abacus. Said it was being called the best barleywine of the year already. Ha, right. That couldn't be true. And even if it is, I don't even really like barleywines.... Well, I supposed if there was going to be one to change my mind, this might be it. But that's pretty doubtful, right? Well, I'll buy a bottle, that'll show him.
Well, a week later, after my girlfriend and I had both had some long days at work, it seemed like a perfect opportunity to bust out this brown-boxed barleywine. Oh, what's this? Neck support for the bottle built into the box? That's clever, but probably just for show, yeah? No bottle deserves neck support, right? Popped the cap, poured the first share into a couple of wine glasses.
And pretenses start to crumble.
What's that smell? Oh, fuck that's good. Maybe it's from the meal.. that meat was pretty well seasoned. Nope, definitely beer. But how can it...? Don't get carried away, Peter, it's probably not that great. Let's see, the taste? Oh... Oh wow. Oh wait, no. No! 
It's 10PM. It dawns on me that all the local stores are closed, and that all of those five cases have likely already been scooped up at any rate. 
I'm stuck in that unique, but welcome hell that is having a beer that's so fantastic, so age-able, so already-open, and so finite. Guess it's time to enjoy. We definitely stopped what we were doing a few times to marvel about it. Bounce back tastes and try and pin things down - the bourbon, the chocolate, the vanilla, the dark fruit, the balance of all of these working together, captured with just the right gravity. An amazing beer that happily made me eat my words. Now if they can just fix the typos all over that brown box... 2,024 characterspetacutlasaurus, Apr 24, 2011

(A) Pours really dark, almost stout or dark porter like. Had a lot of head on it which is surprising for the ABV that this thing carries.
(S) Smells fruity with the citrus notes from the yeast beading through. Some biscuit and light malt even up the nose.
(T) The initial taste is sweet. Has light fruit notes like grapefruit and orange but has a nice underlying tone of medium malt. There is a mild hop bitterness. Has a bit of an oak character toward the middle-end of the taste and finishes off with molasses, raisin and butterscotch.
(M) Being so carbonated I expected it to be bitey but its quite smooth. Had an oily feel but its a filling quality in the mouth.
(O) The alcohol is masked very well. You can get a hint of the booze in the nose but you can't really taste it. I expected it to be a heavily hopped, boozy mess but it was well constructed and balanced and extremely good. 920 characterscjacobsen, Apr 22, 2011
3.98/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours a viscous dark ruby, clear bodied, quickly dissipating off white head, retains a sticky thick ring of lace.
Aroma is a little flat and boozy. Vanilla, oak, sweet plums and sugar dominate, but overall it just smells hot and like alcohol. 
Flavor seamlessly transitions from it's start from a sweet, sugary barleywine to an oaky, vanilla sweet barrel finish. Still some faint trace of hops and the finish is extremely hot and raw.
Mouthfeel is very smooth and thick with very light carbonation and not quite as much booze as the nose. Mildly syrup like and much more like a liquor than a beer. 
Not quite as ready to go out of the literal box as Parabola was, the heat on this needs time to cool down but this still ehas traces of the typical FW balance and deliciousness of their BA beers. 835 charactersyourefragile, Apr 22, 2011

Thanks to Alpar for providing me the chance to taste the top rated American Barleywine.
Well this beer sure looks the best of all of the other barleywines set before us. Hopefully it's a sign of things to come. This beer pours a clear dark mahogany color with an ecru finger surfacing this pretty beer. The aromatics are oak barrel, caramel, fig and raisin. It was actually pretty weak on all those fronts as well. Because the smells were so good is the reason it gets the rating it does. The flavor matches the same with the nose. It good mellow, sweet and has all the characteristics you'd look for in a quality barleywine, but it feels so standard. I think it could have been smoother, but it was still really easy to drink. Overall this was a very excellent beer, but it felt like something was missing from making it world class. 856 charactersVdubb86, Apr 21, 2011

By the beard of Zeus! What an outstanding aroma. Big angry booze smacks you across the nose, followed by vanilla and caramel, a little date, tobacco and oak. Blast it all, this is lovely.
It drinks a little on the sweet side, but it is a smooth ride if you don't mind the river of fire flowing through it. Is this tasty! Good mouthfeel even with the low carbonation, very full and enriching to my life. The caramel coats the tongue and inside the cheeks, plunging into the spots between teeth, seeking all the places to hide forever. And I, willing participant, allow it. I do allow it. 746 charactersdragonWhale, Apr 20, 2011

A: Pours a medium brown with a nice reddish tint to it. 1.5 finger white foam that faded quickly.
S: Sweet smelling and boozy. Caramel and maple with hints of hops.
T: Very boozy, the caramel comes through nicely, bourbon and vanilla continue to sweet this out, hints of oak smoke and tobacco near the end. hop presence is there, but low.
M/D: Good carbonation and medium bodied. It was overall too sweet and too boozy for me. Tasty and there is a lot going on, but I could have used less booze and more hops to even this out. 564 characterscpmichael, Apr 20, 2011

Seriously. I'm convinced they could stick dust bunnies in barrels & make them divine. 22 oz. bomber split with my wife while watching the '11 Twins implode. Infield: Hughes, Tollbert, Casilla, Valencia. No wonder they suck. 
Pours a fiery, almost black shade of garnet that winks from within. Pretty still beer. Like a sleeping rattlesnake. Smell is 94.6% barrel. Titches of sweet maple & malts intrude, but not much. 
Abacus. Clearly, this is a Ket translation for "whack bourbon". The alcohol stings up front, a Kentucky-sipper-slap with a lush vanilla offshoot. Rich raisins rolled in brown sugar squirt about. Toasted wood. Lovely toffee emerges from nowhere as the beer warms towards room temp. Heavy malts roll in during the mid-section, & the beer closes out with another whale of alcohol. Weee! At 13% this one should be half as drinkable but twice as wicked, if you get my drift. Damn. 
Firestone maintains it's standard of excellence for barrel-aged brews. This is one fine BA barleywine. Glad to have a couple more & very interested to see how this stacks up after a little time in the cellar to cool it off a bit. 1,249 charactersmaximum12, Apr 20, 2011
3.75/5  rDev -15.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Bottle thanks to Mark. Pours a deep, deep crimson with a ring of lace around the edges. Nose is fairly pungent and earthy, of course a lot of bourbon, some wood, and an interesting leafy tobacco note. Not overly bright or expressive. Carbonation is pretty sharp upfront. Flavor profile starts quite hot with darker fruits, segues into a bit of milk chocolate and coffee. Strangely subdued despite a large bourbon heat. Pretty good, does the job, but not an elite example of the style as it's just sort of empty and singular at times. Feel is thick and rich. Good but ultimately uninteresting. 
I had this on tap as well and it was about the same, in fact I was hoping the bottle would be better. I was looking forward to this beer for some time but it's kind of a disappointment. I'm not sure age would really help either as the flavors are fairly mellow as it is underneath the hot bourbon. 892 charactersJAXSON, Apr 19, 2011

Big thanks to Alpar for sharing this bottle!
I haven't busted out an abacus since seventh grade math class. Let's hope this beer tops those memories (not much of a challenge, really). It pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger of dirty off-white foam. The nose comprises sharp caramel, mild cocoa, graham crackers, and butterscotch. The taste reunites all of these elements, while simultaneously introducing them to a few newbies: ruby red grapefruit, orange peel, and mandarin orange flesh. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and an oily, sorta syrupy feel. Overall, a more-than-solid b-wine, though I'm not sure it deserves all of the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong: this is some tasty stuff, but there are many better barleywines more readily available. 819 charactersTMoney2591, Apr 18, 2011
3.25/5  rDev -27.1%look: 2.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Poured from a 16oz. growler filled on 4/17/11 at Bullseye Beverage in Smithtown, NY into a Darkness snifter. 
A: Standard pour yields a barely rising off-white ring of head that dissipates quickly. Beer is a dark, nearly opaque but clear mahogany. Lacing is spotty and with little cling but beer has exceptional legs. Rather standard but the lack of head or lace really hurts this one. 
S: Nose is big and boozy. Sweet dark prunes and plum, caramel, toffee, and brown sugar are all present but the alcohol heat in this one covers all but the most pungent smells. Aromatic but almost not in a good way. Stings the nose a bit. 
T: Opens caramel, toffee, and brown sugar. Rich with ample amounts of heat that washes over the entire experience. Middle sees prunes and plums peak their head for the slightest instant before returning to the background. Finish is more brown sugar and caramel with a big alcohol sting right at the finish. Aftertaste is sweet brown sugar and some nuttiness. A lot going on in this one but the predominant alcohol kick covers some of the details. Still, a very intriguing and delicious beer. 
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Slightly grainy and hot in the mouth with some bubbles going down. I can taste all 13% in this one. The comparably (to its style) body helps a bit though. Finish is messy with an aftertaste that lingers. Overall too much booze here and not enough subtlety. 
O: Compared to Parabola (which I realize is a different style), this offering from Firestone Walker is overall a big dissapointment. So hot that the alcohol seems to cover everything in the nose, taste, and feel. I recommend sitting on this one for a very long time. There's a great beer behind that heat somewhere... 1,738 charactersSpeedwayJim, Apr 17, 2011

While it is labled a barleywine, its much more than that... at any point you could convince yourself you have an American Strong Ale, and Old Ale, an Imperial Stout.
Pours a dark color, only noticing the deep mahogany hues when held against a light, nice cap of tan colored head with good retention and lacing. Scent brings wonderul notes of fine burbon, oak, warm vanilla sugar, rich dark chocolate, ripe black cherry, coconut, leather. While beers with this nose tend to be harsh and warm, it was nothing but smooth... all of the flavors blend perfectly. The barrel againg is the star and FW has this method down. While a fantastic malt profile is the base of the beer, I cant get beyond the oak, warmn vanilla sugar, cocount an burbon. While most barelywines seem to go for clean and bright malts, this definitely brings in some from the darker side - chocolate, char, earth and spice present themselves. Body is full, smooth and creamy, no lingering tastes on the palate, moderate carbonation. Fantastic beer which I would love to secure another bottle of and let sit for a while. 1,204 charactersrfgetz, Apr 16, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Another FW bottle courtesy of Richie.
Pours deep, deep copper, darker than most barleywines, with a thin tan head that recedes slowly to small collar and some sticky legs on the sides.
Aroma is spectacular, everything I'd want in a BB barleywine. There is the deep, sweet caramel malts, toffee, vanilla and hints of hops, though this seems closer to an English BW than American. The bourbon is perfectly balanced in the nose, sweet vanilla, light wood notes and bourbon. Wow.
The taste is almost as good with smooth bourbon and vanilla up front, meshing perfectly with the sugary malts, toffee and caramel underneath. Nice alcohol burn in the finish, just tingling the tongue.
The mouthfeel is super smooth and medium bodied with lots of barrel character and soft carbonation.
This is a fantastic BA barleywine, one of the best I've had in a long time. FW certainly knows their way around barrel aging. World class. 920 charactersgford217, Apr 16, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5An extraordinary barrel aged brew: complex, long, sweet, and quite the delicacy.
Presentation: 22 oz boxed brown capped bottle. Exposed cardboard box with the seal of the brewery presiding it and highlighting the name. Back box label notes history of the brewery, expertise aging brews in barrels, intent of ales and blending process, and Abacus overall release. Bottle offers a simple Firestone paper label with brewery branding and brew details, noting 2011 Reserve Series, O.G. 27, IBU 42, F.g. 4.7 p, British Ale yeast, 36 SRM, a production of 1500 cases, and 13% Alc. by Vol. Served on a snifter. 
A - Clear deep brown pour, small brown head, moderate retention, faint surface memory and minimal lacing. Again nothing extraordinary to look at but in sync with a brew of this caliber.
S - Long, delightful and rich nose with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, charred wood, vanilla, caramel, and bourbon, with a nice spicy hint.
T - Taste stays on message with a nice expansion of flavor, charred malt, with a woody sense, caramel and chocolate sweetness, notes of bourbon tied to its vanilla oak, sugary touch… sticky range retrofeeding the taste to a spicy bourbon dash… what a rhythm..
M - Medium/full to full body, low carbonation, creamy stickiness with a nicely woven and showy boozy presence.
D - As good a sipper as a brew can be. Complex, long, and worth the reputation if one is into this range of barrel aged brews. 
Notes: Not the 14th Anniversary but who would complaint when something is this extraordinary. Sure enough, one needs to be into barrel aged, complex, and boozy brews but this is another highlight… I'll keep a bottle, maybe two for the aging, if I can. But it'll be difficult. 1,719 charactersDaniellobo, Apr 16, 2011

A: Dark mahogany wood color with some defined maroon hues throughout the opaque body. A small beige head is on top with some splotchy lacing. A nice foam ring sticks around throughout the entire bottle. What a beautiful looking beer.
S: Strong and rich bourbon barreling notes are first, with some wood elements (maybe cedar or oak -like) coming through. Brown sugar, raisins, fig and some sweet vanilla tie everything together. This smells awesome!
T: Bourbon and Jamaican rum coat the palate, wood notes explode and throw your palate into shock. Vanilla comes through towards the end to smooth everything over. Seriously, this is one of the best tasting Barleywines I've ever had the pleasure of having. The barreled aged notes, vanilla, brown sugar and slight booze are blended masterfully into a single bottle. Fantastic.
M: Low carbonation, smooth, creamy and silky.
There's no doubt in my mind now that this is one you absolutely need to seek out. I feel honored that FW is finally in the Philadelphia market, because it will be hard to keep my hands off this stuff. If you want a barrel aged Barleywine done right, look no further - Abacus is your answer. 1,293 charactersShanePB, Apr 15, 2011

A - Pours a very dark mahogony brown, with a slight tan head leaving a little lacing as it disipates.
S - First thing that hits my nose is bourbon. On second smell I get carmel, woodsey malts, and dark fruits. The smell is very inviting.
T - WoW. The taste is more complex than the aroma, letting way to dark chocolate notes, molasses, and even some espresso notes on the back end of the taste. A nice warming alcohol note does follow, but I expected that for 13%.
M - Has a medium-heavy mouthfeel, almost chewy. Great carbonation.
O - My first Abacus, and I'm blown away! To me, this brew is like The Abyss of the barleywines! So deep, so complex. I am very glad I bought 2 of these, and if there's anymore on the shelf when I go back, I might buy 2 more! Great, amazing barrel aged barleywine! 848 charactersRizalini, Apr 14, 2011

Pours a deep brown almost black color, with some cherry hues which peek out in the light. Thick frothed tanned head dissolved into collar of beige retention, few spots of lacing. 
Rich, strong bourbon and booze with earthy wood and oaked tannins. Light chocolate and caramel with a hint of brown sugar and raisin. 
Smooth syrupy roasted malts, warm and a bit sweet with rich bourbon. Slight hoppiness cuts thru followed by plenty of barrel character with wood and earth. Some silky caramel, burnt brown sugar, heavy malt backbone. Hints of dark chocolate, raisins, and dates. Finishes boozy and sweet with plenty of lingering barrel touches. 
Full syrupy body, milder carbonation, sticky velvet smoothness which wraps around the tongue. Surprisingly drinkable for the alcohol content (I ended up having multiple glasses bc I simply couldn't get enough). Excellent flavor, awesome bourbon barrel usage. One of the best barleywines or barrel aged beers I've ever had - Truly remarkable. 1,014 charactersxnicknj, Apr 14, 2011

Beer appears a clear mahogany in the glass until held to strong light, when it becomes a clear, prune-colored affair. Virtually no head, just a tiny crown of off-white bubbles clinging to the edges of the glass.
Vanilla and rum greet the nose. Brown sugar? Or just a dark rum? Delicious either way. Sweet, with a caramel note.
Flavor is rum and raisin with some bitter oak and sweet brown sugar notes. Coconut. Vanilla. Slightly herbal and medicinal. Alcohol is a component as well, and brings heat as well as flavor. Pretty easy to sip, regardless.
Beer is silky smooth and thick.
One of the best barleywines I have had, I have no doubt this will age wonderfully (if I can let it). 741 characterscharlzm, Apr 13, 2011

*From notes
A BIG thanks to siege02nd for supplying this one. Cheers, John!
A: Rich mahagoney and rustic autumn leaves in color. It's a beaut. A generous pour yields a 1.5 finger head and thick, sticky lacing.
S: Utter bourbon bomb. Alcohol runs rampant to the point where I'm forced to remove the glass from my nose. This one burns. It's like sitting on the porch of a Kentucky B&B at dinnertime, with a plate of steaming, homemade Hot Browns in front of me. As I get past the whiskey, I find spotty hops and juicy prunes.
T: After the nose, I was a bit scared - as I felt this may be too young for early consumption. Happily, this isn't the case. For as brash as it is, it's addictively drinkable now and deceptively smooth. Massive amounts of malt and barley grains are followed by a Costco sized serving of smokey bourbon. A ghosting of hoppy bite interweaves with overwhelmingly chewy tannins and mild, sweet alcohol on the finish.
M: Rich and thick. I wouldn't go comparing it to an Impy Stout, but it's certainly one of the bigger AB's I've had.
O: Firestone Walker's Abacus is simply awesome. This is a delicious beer. For as drinkable as it is now, I would recommend cellaring this for a dime and basking in it's amazingness.
This one's worthy of the hype. It's one of, if not the best American Barleywine I've had the pleasure of drinking. 1,433 charactersRhettroactive, Apr 13, 2011

Pours a deep dark copper/chestnut color with dark ruby/mahogany edges and a one finger frothy off-white head that quickly settles into a thin lasting ring. Sporadic small spots of lacing left behind.
Amazing complex nose with a blend of earthy oak, luscious vanilla, sweet boozy bourbon, dark fruit and earthy/leathery malt. The barrel character is very prominent with lots of toasted oak without smelling burnt. Sweet bourbon and lots of vanilla and marshmallow mellowing things out. As it warms the malts become more prominent with hints of leather, toffee, hazelnut and caramel. Slightly vinous with hints of cherry, grape and plum. Smells amazing and the bourbon is well integrated in the nose without overpowering the other elements.
Medium bodied with the perfect balance of earthy barrel character, boozy bourbon, sweet malt and alcohol heat. Very similar to the aroma with a prominent barrel presence up front. Earthy oak that is slightly toasted with sweet bourbon flavor that is prominent but not overly hot. Although the bourbon flavor is strong, it's not overpowering and the other flavors are able to stand out. There are also notes of vanilla and toasted coconut from the barrel, mellowing things out. Slightly hot with some nice burning warmth in the finish but the ABV is pretty well masked at 13%. Underneath there is a nice blend of earthy/leathery and sweet malt flavor. Slightly earthy barleywine flavor with hints of sweet caramel toffee, rye and faint cocoa. Vinous with dark fruit flavor, especially dark cherry as well as some grape, plum, raisin and fig. More heat toward the end of the swallow but this beer is excellently balanced, delicious and dangerously drinkable. One of the best barrel aged beers I've ever had. Amazing! 1,778 characterscorby112, Apr 13, 2011

S- wow what a nose. Deep dark fruits, with dates and figs. Sweet chocolate, vanilla, dark brown sugar. The bourbon character is so well done, just the right hint of booze. 
T- opens up with smooth bourbon, sweet caramel and chocolate, dried fruits with dates and raisins taking the lead. There's a vanilla and toffee hit that rolls into a nice bit of very well used booze heat. 
M- on the fuller side of body with a touch of sticky slick to it. Nice smooth carb that does just enough to keep it light and moving but understated enough to let you really get into the brew and the brew get into you. There's is some heat I'm not going to lie but hell this is a barrel aged barley wine. 
O- I'm totally digging this brew and I had been hoping for good thing and this far exceeded my expectations. One of the best ba bw I've come across. Its super easy to drink yet at the same time you could spend all day picking it to pieces. 1,295 charactersoglmcdgl, Apr 11, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle. 2011 release. Pours a cola brown with a very small light tan head that leaves small spots of lacing around the glass. The aroma is wonderful. Caramel, toasted coconut, light oxidation, vanilla, brandy (not sure if any of this was brandy barrel aged, but I get it in the aroma), some light cherry notes, a decent amount of bourbon, some light alcohol, a light leather note, and a bit of oak. The barrels certainly come through in the aroma. All of the different aromas work quite nicely together. The initial taste is sweet with caramel, brown sugar, coconut, and vanilla. Then a little brandy and a light oxidation comes through as well. Bourbon and a bit of leather on the finish with a light bitterness. A light alcohol heat, but much less than you would expect for a 13% beer. Medium-heavy body. Very smooth mouthfeel. Manages to be sweet without being syrupy. Low carbonation works very well for the beer. Overall, a great beer. Probably the best barley wine I have had so far. The barrels certainly dominate the nose and taste, which I quite enjoy. I found myself not wanting to finish my glass just so I could continue to enjoy the aroma for a few extra minutes. 1,182 charactersjethrodium, Apr 11, 2011

a: I expected a dark amber color typical of most barleywines. This was dark black with a slight hue on the edges. No light was getting through this beer.
s: Bourbon hits you immediately. The vanilla and molasses come through as well. You can tell this is going to be a hot one.
t: Again with the vanilla, molasses, toffee and some oakiness. The bourbon warms you up at the end, which was appreciated on a rainy night.
m: Creamy and smooth going down and the ABV is felt, but not overpowering. This is a definitely a beer to sip and enjoy.
If you get the chance, Abacus is absolutely worth the try. The barrel aging makes this beer amazing. I would love the chance to try this with 3 years of age! 860 charactersShumania, Apr 10, 2011

Pours a very dark murky brown, almost black, with light cola edging. A thin ring of off white head sits only around the edge of the glass.
The nose offers some faint bourbon accents akin to vanilla, molassess, butterscotch and a touch of cocoa. There is a boozy heat noticed within a short whiff.
The taste is wicked. Some sweet/bready malt is noticed up front and is then immediately surrounded by the barrel aged impressions. The caramel and vanilla is met with some woody characteristics. There is an entire absence of hops here but i'm not complaining. This monster ale packs a punch at 13% ABV and you can taste it. Besides the overbearing heat on this one, it is delicious.
The mouthfeel is very full and satisfying. It goes down smooth and creamy and then bites your palate at the end with high alcohol content.
Overall, impressed and looking forward to tasting improvements with my cellared bottle. Nice bourbon presence that isn't too in-your-face. 1,061 charactersChugginOil, Apr 10, 2011

S - Caramel, toffee, some burnt wood, vanilla. It smells very smooth and good, but not quite as complex as I was hoping for.
T - Caramel, little bit of booze, dark fruit. One of the more defining characteristics of this beer seems to be the barrel precense: great oak and vanilla. There is a lot of brown and slightly burnt sugar and a slight nuttyness. Taste is exceptionally smooth. While good, I'm just a little disappointed as I was hoping for epic.
M - Smooth, light carbonation, very full bodied.
O - A really good beer and barleywine, the 13% is felt in the buzz, but you don't really notice it while you're drinking. Not as good as I was hoping for, but still a great beer. 888 charactersAgentZero, Apr 09, 2011

Nose had traces of buttercorn, molasses, toffee, and butternut squash. Decent carbonation, a little fizzy on the tongue. Full bodied and thick palate.
Very malty and the alcohol tones played like bourbon whiskey and toasted oak. Buttery toffee (not diacetyl! But imagine cracker jacks caramel buttery sweetness). Characters of burnt sugar, caramel, and creme-brulee. Dark fruits like figs, dates, raisins, prunes and hints of earthy honey sweetness. A little bit floralness crept in to balance the sweetness and a big malted grain finish. 
As it warmed the whiskey notes really became more evident. 683 charactersboMD, Apr 08, 2011
4.66/5  rDev +4.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Bailey's Taproom
Poured into a snifter with virtually no head. Color is a dark murky brown, with some red showing when light shines through it.
Aroma hits you first with caramel and toffee, then vanilla, bourbon, and a hint of prunes.
On the front of the tongue this tastes like candy, then there's chocolate further back in the mouth and cherry in the finish. This is very, very smooth and not at all cloying. It should be sipped slowly, but it's hard not to drink it faster than an 13% beer ought to be. 518 characterskscaldef, Apr 08, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Into a wide-rimmed glass, pours a bright ruby body. Quite vibrant and oh so pretty. Didn't really notice the head too much, but from what I can recollect it wasn't substantial. Look at that ruby body though...
A bouquet of strawberries, hints of toffee, and just a little bit of graham cracker/sweetbread. Intense yet very well-balanced between all of the aforementioned aromas. 
The flavors are complex, complex, complex, with the prior-mentioned strawberries and toffee nearly stinging the palate with intensity. Also some biting bitterness, with an overall smoothness that's just right. 
Mouthfeel is ebullient upon swishing, thinner without. 
Overall, this is a fantastic barleywine. Reminds me very much of Greenflash's Imperial Red, though with a lot more of the toffee and caramel notes that GF's IR just doesn't showcase. I could potentially knock back an entire bottle, though not sure what that would do for my constitution other than make me REALLY happy. OoOo:-]
(Update: had it on draft last week, and it's even better. All of the flavors were amplified, especially the sweetbread, toffee, and strawberries; my inspiration had led me to conclude this ranks with Parabola as FSW's top specialty-release) 1,220 charactersjminsc76, Apr 07, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Received this bottle in a trade with cbeer88, thanks Carl! Split with my girlfriend and served in a snifter:
A - Pour produces a small, thin head at first that dies into thin foam ring around the edges with murky bubbles in the middle and a cloudy sworls in the middle. Eventually, there is just no head or foam at all. Color is nearly black with brownish hues coming from the sides. Light can sort of pass through but when I tip it toward the light there are nice brown and amber/ruby tints come through. No lacing retention.
S - The smell is a bourbon cream with a light roast and chocolate. A little bit of toffee and caramelized brown sugar. The bourbon is not in the forefront but compliments the beer quite nicely. A really great smell.
T - Bourbon and oak. Nice caramel and brown sugar. A bit of sugary candy and chocolate cake. The roast is in the middle and toward the end with the smooth bourbon in the front that levels off toward the end, but there is just a touch of heat but it is expected for 13%. Really delicious.
M - Very smooth and creamy. A bit of a tingle from the ABV but pretty well done considering how high it is. A tiny bit of a smokey char that leaves it a tad bit dry.
O - Wow, this is a great beer! So smooth and delicious. I know that this beer is pretty fresh but I am so glad that I have a few bottles to age because I know it is going to get better. Considering the high ABV I am just downing this beer. Great, just great! 1,460 charactersjoshuaseresse, Apr 07, 2011

A) Ruddy brown color, little to no head, mild lacing.
S) Caramel and vanilla, a faint trace of bourbon.
T) Now for the fun, the caramel and vanilla are backed up by a bit of chocolate, this is sweet (of course) but there is a nice balance towards the end with some slight hoppy bitterness and a little "oaky" smokiness!
M) Smooth with just a bit of an alcohol burn. This will age very nicely.
O) Another great beer from Firestone Walker and yet another reason to do my beer shopping other than in Connecticut! 598 charactersjimmy82063, Apr 07, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz. black foiled bottle picked up at Wine Warehouse, Charlottesville, VA. Poured in to a 22 oz. brandy snifter.
Appearance: Pours a brown beer bottle, dingy, russet auburn, transparent at the offset, but - as it begins to fill up the snifter - increasing progressively in opacity until it's entirely devoid of internal light. A fizzy, bubbly, chaotic head - slightly tan, creamy and fine-bubbled albeit severely lacking in the stick and retention normally necessary to coax the descriptor "creamy" out of me - fades to an incredibly fine, thin ring inside ten seconds. An initial burst of carbonation kept the head alive for that brief time, but this burst fades to a stream of slowly creeping effervescence around the periphery of the snifter. At 13.0% with a barrel aged beer, you don't expect much more, but it's still slightly disappointing, given what you would expect to be a pretty high hop protein concentration. 
Aroma: Brown sugar, maple, caramel, and toffee toastiness mingle citrus notes, tropical fruits, and a slew of astringent barrel notes. It's a little harsh and a little muddled, nicer when chilled rather than warm, with a few pleasant spicy and sweet coconut, vanillin, cinnamon notes emerging when chilled (as well as an interesting rum-like undercurrent from the booziness mingling with the dark fruits), contrasted with a much harsher nose as it hits room temperature.
Taste: An interesting taste profile - initial impressions, this is one that both soars in places but also stumbles in just a few. First, the malt profile is fat but not over the top. It's about one step past an equal-parts sweet/dry mixture - towards the sweet side, that is. Honey notes blend with intense caramel roastiness which merges seamlessly with darker toffee, brown sugar, and a hint of butterscotch which themselves meld in to a few heavier, toasty notes: cocoa, well-done toast, a few earthy, biscuity, dry notes. There's also plenty of citrus and fruit - a definite mango presence mingles nicely with a slew of vaguely tropical fruitiness, tons of hoppy citrus, pineapple, and, unsurprisingly, coconut (more on that soon). The remaining fruity notes are darker, but they seem to be more subdued - cherries, stronger dates, a little figginess, some pretty pungent raisin notes, hints of plum, and even some slightly tart prunes. 
The barrels, on the other hand, are a bit ... well, muddled. Brandy fruity notes, rye spiciness, bourbon sweetness ... it's all a bit lost amidst a barrage of heat, unpleasant spice, and astringency. There are a few pleasant vanilla notes and plenty of toasted, barrel sugar-esque coconut notes that emerge from this party, but the big takeaway is that there's a lot going on here, and most of it doesn't jive with most of the rest of it. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth regardless of the carbonation level, and maybe this beer's best quality. About as creamy as you'd want with the hop level and spicy spirit notes and about as erratic as you'd want with the sweet malts and barrel sugars, the end result here is balance. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. 
Drinkability: I was a little underwhelmed by this beer. It's no Parabola - it's hotter, more astringent, and a little less flavorful. And at 13.0%, it's going to kick your ass if you're not careful ... and maybe even if you are. Drink this one with food (specifically, with dessert), and don't drink it alone if you can help it. I think this beer could be a lot more if they became a little more focused with the barrel aging, and maybe even a little more focused with the baseline malts and hop profile ... thinking back on the "big picture" of this beer makes it even a little more hazy. Regardless, on the whole it's definitely an above average brew, one I'm glad to have tried, though I question its price tag. 3,809 charactersCrellMoset, Apr 07, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Split with the trusty airohead2001.
A: medium dark brown with some dark amber hues when held to light. There was a ½ finger light brown head that faded into a crown and oily swirl.
S: The main smells I get are butterscotch and alcohol that comes through with a smell like that of acetone. There's a little bourbon, but not much. Also of note, the beer is devoid of dark fruits, caramel, but has a little bit of vanilla.
T: Thankfully a lot better than the smell. The bourbon comes through very well and is smooth, not overpowering. The main flavor I get is butterscotch, but it doesn't stop there. There are nice layers of oak, caramel, and a pinch of molasses. The alcohol is fairly well hidden, but a get a mediocre amount of "hotness" at the finish. 
M: Nice level of viscosity, appropriately low level of carbonation for the ABV and a pretty good after taste give this a great mouthfeel for the style.
O: Overall I'm glad I was able to find several of these to lay down in the cellar as I really feel this will get better with age. Definitely one of the better bourbon barrel barleywines out there. 1,108 charactersglazeman, Apr 06, 2011
4.31/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks glazeman.
Appearance is pretty standard for a barrel aged barleywine. Dark brown/red with a small head that fades to bubbles that line the edge of the snifter.
The smell is buttered popcorn, toffee, vanilla, booze, and a little bit of piney hops. Outstanding. 
Taste is so rich, complex, and delicious. Wow - I was not expecting something this good. Butter toffee, coconut, and caramel up front with a nice bourbon sugariness through out. The finish is a combo of harsh roasts, harsh hops, and a whole lot of painful EtOH burn, just to remind you that this is a 13% ABV brew. 
Mouthfeel is sticky, which is nice, but is just a little too thin.
Overall, this beer is what I would hope and expect a Harry Potter Butterbeer tastes like. It is sweet, nutty, and buttery. I had no idea that this beer would be this good. It is far better than Mother of All Storms and is much more on par with my favorites, Kuhnhenn BBBW and Central Waters BBBW. The EtOH burn is prominent in this one, but I would love to drink a bottle or two with Hermoine Granger and see where the night takes us. Excellent brew. 1,106 charactersairohead2001, Apr 06, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage on-tap at Track 84. Served in a tulip. Pours the color of mahogany with ruby highlights around the the base. Half-inch head is frothy, tan-colored and embedded with pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a swirl of foam that coalesces around the edges. Thick swaths of lacing are exposed during the tasting. Nose is incredible - sweet and malty with brown sugar, a dominant toffee character and vanilla notes. Taste follows nose - a little alcohol acridness pleasantly breaks up the sweetness. There's also a hint of cocoa or milk chocolate and perhaps a nuttiness quality (hazelnuts?) as well as a rum or whiskey character. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively effervescence that is slightly too assertive for the style and abv. There's also a slight viscosity and some residual alcohol heat at the finish. This is a dangerously drinkable beer at 13% abv. Possibly my favorite example of the style. Definitely a beer that has great cellaring potential. I'd love to see how this beer rounds out with perhaps three years on it. 1,046 charactersJwale73, Apr 06, 2011

Beer served in a snifter, beer is ruby red, dark, thin off white head, some lacing, low carbonation, looks good.
Aroma is great, sweet, bourbon, some fruitiness, mild oak, smells awesome.
Beer is the most drinkable beer I think I've ever had. I'm not the biggest barleywine fan out there, but this is an incredible beer. Sweet, not a dry finish, great liquor character, nice body, creamy smooth, you can hold the beer in your mouth for a long time without any alcohol bite or any heat. Wonderful, truly wonderful. 572 charactersdrabmuh, Apr 05, 2011
4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed from the tap at Tops, served first in their new 10-ounce stange-style glasses, and then out of a little snifter, because I wanted more. 
Deep amber-tinged crimson with very slight haze. Atop, a foamy, one-finger cream-colored head, slowly becomes very thin ring. 
Such an incredible nose. Dark sweet cherries, vanilla, toasted coconut, oak, fig. Barrel notes definitely command the aroma, but the barrels are gooood. Also of note is the perfect integration of all the different aromas. I want to make a shampoo out of it.
The flavor is a nearly perfect reflection of the nose, though perhaps with a tad more cherry sweetness. Tons of barrel character emerges in notes of charred oak, vanilla and coconut, while the "barleywine" nature of the beer shows itself in a blast of sweet dark grapes and even some syrupy orange before the swallow and the slightly drying finish. So complex, but so well-blended.
As in the bottle, the mouthfeel is perfection. Creamy medium full body, very soft fizziness. The carbonation seems lighter here, but still works. Alcohol is picked up on the tongue and throat, but seems more like 8 percent than 13. 
I hate to be that guy, but Abacus is even better from the tap being granted a cherry sweetness I didn't much pick up in the bottle. Incredible. 1,293 charactersPhelps, Apr 05, 2011

Caramelized raisins with brown sugar with some booze.
Dark fruits raisins dipped in rum, powdered chocolate, some spicy hops add a nice dimension to this Barleywine. Highly carbonated.
Overall I think its a great Barleywine that deserves a try, very complex with lots of layers to the flavor. 407 charactersfoogerd, Apr 05, 2011
4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured on tap into a small snifter at Church Key DC as part of the official Firestone Walker DC Launch Party.
No head was poured, but the body of this brew is a fairly clear but real nice dark brown to red cherry body. Light tan color noticing other pours, and bubbles are present, and there does manage to be a minimal collar left even while finishing.
Bouquet is a real pleasant soft silky milk chocolate almost Belgian chocolate tasting. Vanilla, hints of powdered hot cocoa with slight powdered sugar. A sense of dry feeling, but not entirely.
Taste brings a real nice Belgian chocolate, with silky feeling. However, there is a very prickly carbonation that is noticeable and subtle. I would prefer this to be a lot smoother. No hint of alcohol boozyness, but gives a slight lingering numbness on the finish.
Overall this is pretty dang good, but I wish it wasn't so prickly and carbonated. Very chocolaty I must say. It's excellent but I am not blown away by it. 971 characterssmakawhat, Apr 05, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Rather dark for the style with a dark brownish-red body that is just a few shades short of black. Capped by a modest cream colored head that looked good while it lasted.
Sweet caramel malty tones on top of an underlying vanilla and oak wood character. Picking up on slight hints of chocolate too
Lots of wonderful flavors swirling around. The combination of these malts and the oak barrels give it strong caramel and vanilla sweetness at first, like putting caremel syrup on your ice cream. Other flavors get the chance to come through with a bit of a chocolate note and some tobacco flavors in the finish. 
Thick and chewy with a bit of a boozy kick to it. Overall, another excellent example of barrel aged beers from the guys (and gals) are Firestone Walker. 763 charactersKinsman, Apr 05, 2011

Impeccable balance from sniff to aftertaste. Simply one of the most amazingly sophisticated barleywines I've ever tasted. In another six months when the heat has subsided, this will be a true masterpiece. Edit: After only a few days resting, the heat has almost totally vanished, the carbonation is softer, and the flavors are already more married. Kudos, Firestone! 592 charactersImpfan, Apr 05, 2011

A: The beer is a deep dark reddish brown color, large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains candy sugar, dark fruit, caramelized malts and a touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out very sweet with strong flavors of brown sugar, caramel & dark fruit. The malt character is very hearty and there's some chocolate in the background. There's also a mild alcohol sting which is to be expected with a 13.00% ABV. The hops presence is mild but complementary and brings some balance. The after-taste is likewise sweet.
M: Smooth and crisp, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, for a high-gravity sipper this is a good beer to drink for as long as you're able to handle it. 927 charactersTheManiacalOne, Apr 04, 2011

Poured into my Firestone Walker mini snifter as I am a freak like that. Pours a beautiful dark ruby brown with some light tan head. Nice looking Barleywine.
I've really been impressed with FW in the past and this experience is no different. Goddamn, this is a delicious beer. Smells malty and delicious with just a hint of alcohol, but for it being so fresh this smells like the direct opposite of fuck. Bourbon is so well intergrated into both smell and taste as I feel this ageing process is very similar to Rare. Subtle yet powerful, like the opposite of an old man trying to send back soup in a deli. Toffee, caramel, and dark fruits along with brown sugar, oak and vanilla blend perfectly creating a thick and lushes mouthfeel with perfect feel and carbonation.
Another excellent beer from a really impressive brewery. 910 charactersLunch, Apr 04, 2011

Appearance: Least appealing part of beer (but not unattractive!). Dark brown, amber at the very edges almost no head visible

Smell: Typifies an English barleywine--Deep sweetness from stone fruits and date. I'd say boozy but that carries a negative connotation-this smells wonderfully rich and caramelly. Touch of blended whiskey on the nose.

The color is a beautiful dark ruby, as stated on the label. The head is rather small and fades rapidly to virtually nothing, leaving some faint lacing on the glass.
The aroma is inviting, with scents of bourbon, malt, caramels, and oak.
Delicious! Balanced? Oh yeah. Flavors flow together beautifully. Brown sugar, caramels soaked in bourbon, oak barrels, hints of vanilla.
The feel is truly exceptional. The beer goes down effortlessly, with nary a hint of the supposed 13% abv. It would be no problem to finish a bomber unaided. No need to age this masterpiece, as it's already silky smooth.
Overall, a terrific beer and a stellar example of a barrel-aged barleywine. Highly recommended. 815 charactersHuhzubendah, Apr 04, 2011

never had it before -- now i see why people talk about it and seek it out. 
pours a beautiful rich black with a little head but perfect carbonation -- good and rich and the right amount of fizzy all the way through the glass.
the first hit is all coconut milk goodness.... and it is rich and sweet and complex all the way through -- molasses, dates, sweet, rich... only the mildest of bitter sensation.
BARRELS rule the day at Firestone Walker. their barrel aging process is giving their beer a next level taste profile. you do not just appreciate the ingredients -- the beers are conditioned in such a way -- you go from 10 to 100 very quick.
Abacus rates in the 90s -- it is an incredibly rich, yummy, complex brew... it is not something you would casually give to your dad when he asks for a Beer.

Palate is intensely english barley wine, sesame seed, vanilla, heat, honey, lamb meat, pineapple, fig flesh,and brown sugar. This was my experience. But it may be different for you. With that said i can see this beer being a bit over accessible, as in this beer is so broad and hides the abv so well that its a slow approach which in turn makes it a success in that it must be drank slowly. Carbonation is better as it sits. 539 charactersrtepiak, Apr 02, 2011

A - This beer pours a ruddy brown with ruby edging. Virtually no head.
S - Lots of variety in the nose. Chocolate, vanilla, some pepper, plums, caramel sugars, slight florals.
T - Incredible depth of layers of flavours. The two prominent layers are a very nice, subtle, sweet cherry. The other is the bourbon. The bourbon brings a nice oakiness with it as well as some 'young' back end heat. Between these two, you pick up hints of vanilla, toffee, chocolate, coffee, slightly burnt sugars.
M - Creamy, medium, slight tackiness from the sugars. Still a bit hot.
O - An incredible beer already. This will just get better after a few years in the cellar. 704 charactersOakedCanuck, Apr 01, 2011

ahhhh. so smooth. a bit boozy, but flavors abound. oak is there in abundance, and is a bit bourbon-y. molasses, maple syrup, and vanilla with some light chocolate, mocha latte, toffee and a plethora of deep malts mixed with a good amount of oaky bourbony booze heat.
a tad thin for the strength of flavors with a good amount of heat, but velvety smooth.

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is labeled (here) as an American Barleywine, but really reminds me more of an English one. Since they used a British yeast, I will be rating this as if it were English.
A: Quickly dissipating head with almost no lace. Large bubbles that make loud popping as they disappear. Swirling in glass causes a brown coating on the wall, indicating high sugar.
Cola brown with reddish highlights
S: This beer hits you fast with the sweet smell of overripe pineapple and perfectly ripe coconut (almost a pina colada), hints of chocolate and a slight sweet-sherry smell follow. 
The malty smell is reminiscent of sweet dark rye bread. Very small butterscotch upon opening hints at diacetyl, but that quickly fades.
T: Sweet toasted malt gives way to a chocolate and bourbon palette with. There's no hop bite, the bitterness is slightly subdued behind the sweet chewy toffee. Slightly alcoholic, but not too much. It leaves a coffeelike aftertaste going down, which turns to coconut. 
M: It's creamy and delicious and not too hot or biting on the tongue. The balance is perfect.
I would drink this again and again, though probably only one a night if I want to wake up the next day. It is truly a world class beer, one of the few 5.0s to a style I have seen. Judged as an English Barleywine, I cannot find a flaw. 1,310 charactersTawnos, Mar 31, 2011

A - Dark brown with a glimmer of mahogany at the edges. One-finger tan head that fades immediately. Mild lacing that slides quickly down the glass. 
S - Plum, leather, bourbon, spice, vanilla, wood, mild chocolate. Pleasing. Reminds me of a liquour-laden, high-quality fruit cake. 
T - Complex to say the least. Taste runs much like the smells with a bit more wine-barrel flavor, caramel and some hop bitterness. The chocolate remains mild. Alcohol is readily apparent. 
M - Medium-heavy body and light carbonation. Thick and creamy. Lip-smacking good.

Vintage: 2011
A - Pours a reddish murky dark mahogany with a thin off-white slightly creamy head that has some dense bubbles. A vigorous swirl just barely generates a head of about .25 inches. Very nice red ruby hues on the corners of the beer.
S - Molasses and caramel sweetness come up front. Dark fruits and some nice brown sugar. The sweetness is almost indescribable. Nice, complex and full but at the same time not too cloying. There is some nice yeast phenols to, surprisingly. There is some slight woody notes and there is a faint hoppy spice in the nose.
T & M - Flavors are soft but full. Not too intense, very well balanced. There is some nice smooth caramel and vanilla sweetness. Some intense but inviting bourbon notes mixed in with the sugar hints and the delicious vanilla sweetness. This beers malts profile is near perfection to me. The hops are there but they just compliment the malts. For an American Barleywine they stay away from the intense hop notes. There is some slight grassy and dry citrus but the star is the malt. Awesome. The mouthfeel is almost, creamy and viscous. Carbonation on the lower side but still good.
O - Great AB. Probably top 5 in my book. Its good to see a AB that is malt heavy and the barrel aging adds to the sweet side. 1,320 charactersJoEBoBpr, Mar 29, 2011

Smells a little oaky, woody, boozy, shredded coconut, good. Taste is like nice chocolates, hardly a hint of the alcohol, very well done. Overall, this is probably the second best firestone beer i've had after FW11. 312 charactersArrogantB, Mar 28, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - poured with a small head of off white foam on top of a black body with clear amber highlights showing through. The head settles quickly and leaves little lace.
S - Earthy aromas of chocolate and cinnamon with lots of toffee and a hint of pine hops.
T - Sweet, dark caramel and toffee up front. Spicy cinnamon and chocolate flavors come out in the middle. The beer finishes with fruity notes of red apple and licorice with molasses and thick caramel. Pipe tobacco and brandy linger in the aftertaste.
M - A thick, slightly oily body, moderately low carbonation, and a fairly sweet finish. 
D - Complex, interesting, and intense. This beer is very drinkable for done thing of this strength, though it really should be served in a small snifter. I imagine that this is the sort of beer that would continue to improve for years, though it didn't seem to need any age when I had it. 885 charactersnickfl, Mar 27, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -11%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Pours a dark walnut brown, can only see a bit of light around the edges. Small head that fades quickly and ends up looking like flat cola after a few mins.
S - Lots of vanilla, chocolate, dark fruit, hop aroma absent. Can smell that this has spent some time in oak.
T - The smell translates to the taste very well. Very complex, again you can tell this has been aged in bourbon barrels, the vanilla flavor really comes through. Lots of chocolate malt and a bit of dark fruit, almost reminds me of a port. Again, lacking in hop character and bitterness which should be present in an American barleywine.
M - Nice, smooth, and warming. A little alcohol bite at the end. Wish it had a little more body to help balance the 13% ABV.
O - This is a good barleywine, would be even better if judged as an English style, but it is a bit lacking as an American style in the hop category. Definitely a barelywine to be tried by all loves of the strong style. 954 characterssteelerguy, Mar 27, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep cola brown with a finger of head that dies down to some bubbles.
Aroma is ultra rich toffee, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Holy cow this is big, bold, clean, and appetizing. Notes of pine and floral hoppiness deep in the background.
The flavor is a stellar mix of the above mentioned characteristics--rearranged a bit. The pine hoppiness jumps out up front as well as lingers in the finish. The toffee and milk chocolate are present but are overtaken by the vanilla sweetness. A dry oaky characteristic in the finish. As it warms, the hops subside back down and the chocolate and toffee jump back into the forefront. This is a complex and evolving flavor profile, and is pretty much exactly what a barrel aged barleywine should taste like.
The body is in between medium to full and the carbonation is a bit stinging yet somehow finishes with a little bit of creaminess. 
Overall this beer is one of the best barleywines on the planet for sure. Right up there with The Perfect Storm '09 and Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Barleywine '09 competing for the status of the best to ever cross my lips. 1,110 charactersalcstradamus, Mar 27, 2011

A: Looks very dark with a small tan head that fades quickly to a nice bubbly lace atop the brew. Good.
S: A nice creamy bourbon character upfront with some nice caramel vanilla notes in the middle. Some nice toffee on the backend. Very good, love the bourbon character. Almost a strawberry character hidden here.
T: A nice creamy bourbon character upfront with some nice vanilla and coffee flavors quickly followed. Some nice chocolate notes on the back. Some toffee on the back. Very good.
M: Full bodied with a great carbonation. Creamy dry finish. Very good.
D: Goes down surprisingly easy. Very good.
All in all, this is a very good barleywine. Great for the style if you get the chance to try. So definitely try if you have the chance. 850 characterssteve8robin, Mar 26, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Be jealous...yes, be very jealous...SOMEONE in the Sonoma County area is going to be very upset that they didn't get their bottle, since I told the folks at BevMo! that they were holding some for me!!!
Beautiful reddish amber...Closer to red than amber or even brown. Beautiful, creamy head...Tiny bubbles of carbonation and plentiful they are. Nice sticky lacing..Very purty thus far...
Aromas are amazing, like many of the FW Barrel aged brews...I get toasted coconut, bourbon, vanilla, some roasted chocolate malt, but just a hint...very robust...A certain sweetness too, very nice...
Flavor is incredible..It's tough to describe...There's certainly alcohol in it...You get that late middle and in the finish, but it's not cloying...Initial burst shows off some of the brewing technique: nice carbonation sets up the blast of flavor...Early middle gets a large, sweet-roll going on: a chocolate and bourbon sweet roll! The sugary sweetness is fleeting, though, and quickly is replaced by the barrel aging notes: some char, some liquor (I get rum also, but that can't be right)...This is downright d-effin-licious...Finish is a TOUCH too bitter from the alcohol, that will mellow with age. This will be Earth shattering beer if cellared for a couple years...
Now the basics: Nearly impossible to find bottled, when you do it's $14.99/bomber (YOWZA!!) and 13% ABV (Holy Moley)...
What I like most: The awesome aroma profile and nice early flavors...
What I like least: Certainly the price and noticeable alcohol flavors...
Verdict: A touch below stuff like Xantus, but still top tier. If you can find it, try it... 1,622 charactersSolomonGrundy, Mar 26, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had on-tap at Armsby Abbey in Worchester, MA.
A- Poured a deep dark brownish red with a thin head that stays around for a little while and leaves some decent lace.
S- Bourbon, slight hops, and a giant slam of coconut. It was a pleasant surprise, the coconut was strong, but mixed right in and really complemented the bourbon flavors. A nice oaky vanilla aroma as well.
T- Wow, exactly like the smell. The only difference is that as it warms, the coconut dissapears and the bourbon shines through. The alchohol makes itself well known as it warms. Also, the vanilla comes out as well as it warms. Almost a different beer 30 minutes in.
MF- A nice smooth body that's about moderate to just about full. 703 charactersLtCracker20, Mar 26, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Just recently received a fresh load of brewski's from the PeprSprYoFace; included was this beauty. I've had this brew a couple of times (Dark Lord Day & Night of the Barrels) and it's mighty tasty. Barrel Aged Barleywines (especially English) are some of my favorite all time brews (Perfect Storm, Wooden Hell, etc...). Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip.
Appearance- Pours a dark ruby red brownish with a small quarter finger creamy off-white head. After a few minutes no cap or collar remains along with ZERO lacing.
Smell- Rich and caramely with that great sort of burnt Barleywine sweetness that oozes out of the nose. A fair bit of vanilla is detectable amongst the nice subtle wood and faintest booze. Maybe a touch of chocolate that adds a Tootsie Roll like aspect. Plenty of hops do make their way into the nose adding a bit of a dark fruitiness that gets more potent as the beer warms.
Taste- Starts out fairly soft with a sort of butterscotch sweetness that is lightly accented by the barrel. A touch of vanilla and maybe a bit of chocolate but its feint. Sort of a cola/root beer thing mixes in. The caramel is definitely dominate and I almost feel this brew is sort of one sided. The booze is very well hidden but the hops aren't as assertive as the nose led me to believe. I need something more to counteract that sweetness.
Mouthfeel- Nice rich mouthfeel with a light bit of carbonation. A bit cloying (nothing game ending) with a touch of alcohol warmth in the finish.
Drinkability- Definitely a tasty brewski but it might need a touch more time. At this point it's slightly too sweet and I don't find it as complex (or delicious) as PS or WH. Maybe that's an unfair comparison but that's what it's up against in my mind (right?). It's just not quite there yet. Thanks much Corey! 1,798 charactersyounger35, Mar 26, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle from jbtice0315, thanks a lot!
Pours with a strong vanilla bourbon and oak odor that permeates the room. Alcohol is present, but not overly so. Little head, and much darker than I thought it would be. Not much lacing down the side.
The nose makes me drool.
The first taste is all smooth oaky bourbon. The second shows the 13% but it is not that too strong. Some plum notes actually come out, but not very much. Best thing to compare to would be the mother of all storms. It is right up there, but I think the Moas is a bit better. I think a few years would make this unbelievable though. It is good now, but could use a bit more time. 
Great beer, glad I got a chance to drink it, and hope I can try one in a few years. Thanks again jesse.
Edit: as this warms the booze really comes out of this. The nose is strong with alcohol... lowered my rating of the smell. 869 characterscrusian, Mar 25, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at Naja's during their Firestone Walker event because their keg of 14th Anniversary blew in the hour and a half interim before I got there (insane!). 
Poured into an 8 oz glass. Appearance is dark with shades of ruby and brown. Smells sweet and malty. It's making my mouth water.
Taste is absolutely exceptional. Very surprising. It's pretty sweet. There are definitely some fig or prune notes in there along with some malty maple syrup goodness and just a slight hint of coffee/toffee. At 13% the booze is there but not entirely noticeable
This is way too drinkable and dangerous. It's an eager sipper. Mouthfeel is great and it goes down smooth. This is an outstanding beer. Cheers 697 charactersUnknownKoger, Mar 25, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a founders sniffer from a 22oz bottle. I'd never thought I'd say this but big ups to blanchards in Allston for the 3 bottles I got. 
The beer pours a wonderful dark red hue. Similar to a coca cola on ice. Nice lace on the glass
The smell is intoxicating. Sweet, bready, oakyz, bourbony goodness. Some chocolate and coffe.overtones. 
The brew goes done smooth and feels amazing on the tongue. I had it below cellar temp so the taste may have been off but I noticed little heat while enjoying the flavors of wood, cream laced bourbon, mocha flavoring as well. 
An exceptional barely wine. Proud to have this be my first review. 641 charactersPatrickbrusil, Mar 25, 2011

Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Firestone walker taster tulip. 
A:The beer pours a clear copper amber color, with a light red hue. Lightly carbonated, even on the intial pour, just a ring of bubbbles, no lacing at first. 
S: A bit surprisingly, I get cherries in the nose. Followed by scents of toffee, bourbon, and vanilla. Booze come through as well. 
T: The flavors in the taste were of lightly roasted caramel malt, maple syrup, vanilla bean, toffee, bourbon, and light oak. 
M: Buttery, and a little heat. Lighly carbonated
O: Great barley wine, but for me, it needs some time to mellow out, as I also got what I would describe as a spice, or cinamon note in there, which was a bit off putting to me. No one elses at the tasting got that in this, so maybe it's just my palate, but it was subtle, so hopefully that note will fade out, and the other notes will have more promience. I Have three bottles in the cellar, so will what some age does to it. 1,079 charactersRetsinis, Mar 25, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From 03/11/11 notes. Had two samples of this on tap at NOTB up in Boston, MA. 2011 vintage.
a - Pours a deep mahogany brown color with an inch of off white head and light to moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of caramel malts, bourbon, oak, and toffee. Maybe a hint of chocolate as well.
t - Tastes of caramel malts, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, and toasted malts.
m - Full body and low carbonation, the body is insanely smooth and creamy. Very easy to drink for a 13% ABV barleywine. Perfect mouthfeel for a barleywine.
d - I thought this was an amazing barleywine. Lots of caramel and oak, mixing with some sweet vanill and bourbon, especially in the taste. The mouthfeel was great and this was scary drinkable for 13%. Can't wait to get bottles of this one when it comes to VA. 793 charactersmdfb79, Mar 23, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Clear deeply brown colored beer a very small tan colored head.
Smells strongly of bourbon. Vanilla, oak and chocolate are the next strongest scents. Smells sweet with coconut cake aroma. Some patent malt in here and a faint scent of ashes. Super complex scent probably 10 things I missed.
Starts out sweet with a strong bourbon whiskey flavor. Lots of chocolate, coconut, vanilla and caramel in the taste. This tastes more than a little bit like German Chocolate cake. After it gets warm it gets more boozy than cold but it is still quite tasty. This is very much a whiskey beer.
Mouthfeel is good.
Drinkability is OK. High alcohol level and the whiskey taste make this on a little problematic in the drinkability department. To bad this isn't in 7oz bottles. 763 charactersZorro, Mar 22, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bomber into a tulip, 2011 batch. Clear ruddy brown in the pour, more foggy in the glass. Seems a shade or two lighter than batches of Abacus I've had on tap in the past, more of a traditional barleywine color than a near opaque dark brown. The off-white head doesn't last long, receding to a crown after a moment.
Smells good. Really good. Plenty of brown sugar and toasted coconut, with a leathery, earthy note of oxidation. Some alcohol is evident, but not much considering how fresh this is. There's a lot of barrel here, contributing the expected caramel-vanilla richness, and beneath that I pick up subtle dried fruit sweetness, somewhat date-like.
At this point, it tastes even better than it smells. Alcohol again is noticeable, but pushed aside by layers of caramel, coconut and and roasted nuts. Oxidation isn't as present on the tongue as it was on the nose, I only get a faint trace of cocoa and leather. It's a rich, sweet beer, but remarkably easy to drink - maybe because it isn't terribly syrupy or hot, but I find myself drinking this a lot faster than most barrel aged barleywines.
There is a slight heat to the finish, especially as it opens up, but it's nothing that a couple months of age won't solve. Toffee and tobacco linger in the finish, along with a slight woody/tannic note.
Overall, yeah, this is awesome. At $15 per bottle, there isn't much to complain about here. I wish it were easier to find, but that isn't the beer's fault. World class stuff. 1,480 characterslargadeer, Mar 22, 2011

A: Clear, deep, radiant ruby-brown body underneath a solid head of super-fine tan bubbles. Great retention and lacing for such a big beer. Simply beautiful.
S: Surprising. Fruity and floral. Grapes, raisins, candied figs, and apple blossoms. I'm stretching to pick up the barrel aspects, but they just aren't coming. Still awesome.
T: Bourbon shows up right away here, backed up by rich toffee, dark fruit, oak, and butterscotch. Some booze on the finish, but ridiculously little for a 13% beer. Completely different from the aroma, and somewhat better - certainly more typical for a barrel-aged barleywine.
M: Soft, smooth full body with light but ever-present carbonation. Quite nice indeed.
O: I read the box after taking my notes, and the aroma makes way more sense to me now that I see it was aged in a mixture of wine and bourbon barrels. The wine completely dominates the smell, with the bourbon asserting itself on the palate. Both are lovely. What's most impressive about this beer is how supremely smooth and drinkable it is, despite being astronomically strong. I wouldn't have guessed it was anything over 10%, much less a full 13%. Wow.

4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Aroma: A huge bourbon barrel and deep oak nose right up front. There's no mistaking the barrel aging on this one. Alcohol spice is present but not overpowering or fusel. Black pepper and burnt caramel also come out if you dig for it.
Appearance: Deep brown to nearly black with ruby red highlights along the sides when held to the light. Head pours medium with rocky off-white bubbles, though this fades quickly to but a ring of head at the sides. 
Flavor: Caramel and oak blended with a powerful alcohol and bourbon presence up front on the palate. Through the middle malt sweetness kicks in just for a moment with dark melanoidin character. Alcohol comes back in the finish with spicy pepper. Hop presence is noted only with a lingering bitterness in the finish. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with medium carbonation. The 13% alcohol content is providing quite a bit of warmth throughout the palate with a tingling presence on the roof of the mouth and a burn at the back of the throat.
Overall: The bourbon aroma coming off the top of this beer is outstanding! Though one could argue that the aroma is rather one-dimensional and you do have to look for the other aroma characteristics. But that's really being picky. Flavor and mouthfeel are balanced. The alcohol is a little hot, but this will tone down nicely with age. An excellent barleywine. 1,355 charactersDanOLeary, Mar 21, 2011

2011 vintage.
pours a dark though translucent caramel tone, sits a deep mahogany in the glass. pour yields just shy of a finger's worth of head that, as expected, dissipated fairly quickly into a collar around the glass. lacing in patches.
nose is just exceptional. one of the best aromas off a barleywine i've come agross. assertive notes of caramel, vanilla, bourbon. a bit of coconut, maybe dark fruits. i'm not usually a big fan of the descriptor 'wow' but, well... wow. well bleepin' done.
taste is phenomenal, just really flavorful and well-blended. the caramel, boubon, vanilla, et al come together to produce a delicious melange; a few sips in and i'm already thinking this is probably my favorite barleywine - english or american - to date. nice hoppy presence in the finish, as well as some warming booziness. my one (slight) criticism would be that it is pretty hot (at 13% ABV this is to be expected). luckily i bought a second to throw in the cellar for a while. 
medium-full bodied mouthfeel with some chew to it; average to slightly below average carbonation.
overall? world class, no question. just an amazing beer. well worth the cost IMO. 1,194 charactersperrymarcus, Mar 21, 2011

Appearance - Given to me in a 10oz...mixed drink glass? A brown murky color with some nice ruby/mahogany shade. Slight lacing is on the sides of the glass.
Smell - Wonderful notes of vanilla, coconut, dark fruits, and bourbon. The aroma is just remarkable and FW seems to have nailed this quite often with their beers. The nose just gets you excited to taste the actual beer.
Taste - As the nose would indicate, vanilla and bourbon with a hint of the dark fruits. Raisins and plums are prevalent along with the slight coconut smelled in the aroma. This almost doesn't taste like a barlywine to be honest. The beer then has a big malty backbone with chocolate and toffee noticeable also.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, very creamy, and decent carbonation.
Drinkability - This is one of the best barlywine's I've ever had. Incredibly smooth and tasty. Another hit from FW and I'm glad I have plenty of bottles. 952 charactersSpdKilz, Mar 21, 2011

S: Bourbon is front and center on the nose, which I love so my bias knocks this up another 0.5 points. Behind it is vanilla, caramel malts, and oak.
T: Carmelly and sweet, with a nice bourbon punch. I am a big fan of bourbon so this hit the spot for me. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 for me was that it is difficult to see what the base beer is like. This is one of the better beers I have tastted.
M: Very thick and creamy but very drinkable at the same time, especially with the high ABV. The alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering. This was quite a treat. After having it on tap, I must get my hands on a couple bottles to age. 788 charactersthatsfine, Mar 20, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour: Dark cola brown with a red hue and a small one finger off white head, slightly bubbly, slightly fluffy and slightly lasting, turning into a finely beaded ring around the glass.
Nose: toasted oak, vanilla, coconut, coffee, dark bakers chocolate, brown sugar, bourbon soaked cherries, some noticeable dark fruit like plum and dates. 
Taste: God this is great. An amazingly well blended barleywine where the bourbon accentuates the great parts of the base beer. An English style barleywine that isn't overly malty sweet but just right. The initial flavors are bourbon cherries, brown sugar, coconut, dark chocolate and vanilla. This turns into slight coffee, slight plum and dates as well as some more bourbon. The malt is well balanced with the bourbon and the vanilla, coconut, cherry and dark bitter chocolate round out nicely with notes of charred oak. 
Mouthfeel: Very well done, well blended and not overly syrupy or cloying but definitely in the medium-heavy thickness range. It is also nicely carbonated once it hits the back of your mouth.
Overall: an extremely well blended English barleywine and an exceptionally well crafted barrel aging masterpiece. My favorite barleywine. Great both on draft and in bottle. Wow! Cellaring should do wonders. 1,262 characterswaltersrj, Mar 20, 2011

S: Up front is a lot of wood an barrel aromas. Very strong and sharp vanilla and sweetness. Fruit, molasses, and alcohol lingers. Lots of wood and alcohol.
T: Follows the nose. The barrel is up front and center. Wood, toffee, molasses. Very sweet.
M/D: A full body with good carbonation. So smooth and creamy. Easy to drink. This is a very nice treat.

bottle to snifter
650ML
App- Dark garnet dark with a chocolatey look as it poured from the bottle. At the end of the drink looked very bourbon/whiskey like in color. A very quick one finger head was present then vanished. No lacing on cling.
Smell- More like a big stout to me which was fine and it smelled great. Had a big oaky, vanilla with a rich boozed infused scent.
Taste- This is finally the big GIANT barleywine I have been looking for. I always imagined barleywines to be a big beer and this hit it spot on. Big malts with a little chocolate. Dark fruits are very prevalant but well balanced against the stronger flavors.
Mouth- Full bodied with a medium carb level. The fruits and molasses tastes are thick to me but mellow down as this warms.
Drink- This was big, flavorful and very stout like. I have a couple more of these to sit on and I am very glad I picked the extras up. This was flavorful and powerful and I think it can only get better with age. 989 charactersFosterJM, Mar 19, 2011

Fluffy 1/2 finger head fades at med pace over super dark brown color
Nose lots if aged soft malts, dark malts, crystal, caramel, molasses, toffee, some dark fruits, lots of aged malt aromas, very light earthy hops.
Taste aged malts, dark fruits, light fig and raisin, light fluffy malts, crystal and caramel, molasses, toffee, bit of minerality but not much, bit of a very dark roast, some booze but not much for 12%, light earthy hops. Chewy, soft, light choc, tasty. Finishes a bit bitter, light minerality, aged malts lingering, drier, it gets a nice earthy and slight spicy hop on the finish.
Mouth is a bit heavier bodied with decent carb.
Overall great, cross between old ale and barleywine. Very soft, delicate and tasty. 753 charactersjlindros, Mar 19, 2011
3.9/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I grabbed this bottle at Yankee Spirits in Stubridge today. I tried this last weekend at EBF, and was impressed, so lets see how it hold up from the bottle. It pours out a rosewood color, with half a finger of whitish heading. The color is nice, here; a mix of red and brown. Lots of caramel and alcohol come through in the nose, along with just a little bit of dark fruit. More of the same from the taste, but the alcohol is much more in the forefront than in the smell. The mouthfeel is thick, creamy and chewy all at the same time. The ABV on the bottle is listed as 13% as opposed to the 12% I see above. In any event, the alcohol is pretty hot on this one right now. I am thinking this beer tastes great now, but will do even better with some age to it. This is a beer to buy two of; one to drink now and one to cellar for a while. 836 charactersjamie2dope, Mar 18, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Poured out a dark, dark burgundy color with a small, off-white head of foam. Nice retention with a soapy residue of lace.
S - It smelled of sweet caramel malt with some floral notes and sweet citrus fruits.
T - It tasted spicy with a sweet caramel maltiness. It had a nice toasty flavor, too.
M - It was crisp, sharp and smooth. A medium to full bodied ale with a dry, snappy finish.
O - This is a really good barleywine. Delicious on tap. 447 characterszeff80, Mar 17, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So glad they decided to start botteling this beer.
Poured into my Russian River wine glass.
Pours a dark ruby red/brown color with only a ring of head. No lacing.
Aroma is amazing. Bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, caramel. Awesome.
Tastes just as it smells. Soo flavorful. Dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon. Amazing what a barlywine can become.
Mouthfeel is a bit heavy and makes it hard to drink an entire 22oz bottle.
Overall an amazing beer. Glad I grabbed a few to age. Get some for sure. It's going to age very well. 535 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Mar 15, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42011 Vintage/13%ABV. I was SO EXCITED to try this one, considering every time I've gone to the brewery, they've never had it on tap. Pours a dark amber-reddish color with almost no head at all. Almost like some cherry cola after the carbonation has settled. Scent is OAK...and lots of it. The oak and bourbon flavors are absolutely lovely and predominant in the aroma. The description on the box doesn't specify which barrels were used, but some of the barrels definitely left some amazing bourbon notes behind. Taste definitely has that oak flavor as well, along with delicious cherry and vanilla notes. There are also hints of chocolate and dark fruits. Bourbon is blended in very nicely with all these flavors. Absolutely phenomenal! Mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with such amazing complexity. Drinkability is high for a 13% barleywine. 845 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 14, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Darkish brown, almost cola-like, but a few shades lighter. 
Smell - Caramel, molasses, hints of orange oil and banana candy. Orange circus peanuts? My friend Kate said, "it smells like something's happening."
Taste - Molasses, vanilla, marzipan. Hints of almond liqueur and citrus. The more I drink it, the more the cherry sticks to my palate.
Mouthfeel - Viscous, oily, slick... all in non-offensive ways.
Drinkability - There's an unsurprising boozy bite that I think would keep me from going too deep into this. Having said that, it hides 12% remarkably well and could be very dangerous. 
Overall, this is a fantastic beer that will only get better and better with age. One customer remarked that he thought this could be kept for 5+ years and I can't disagree. This is going to be a beast and I'm glad that I caught a taste of it before it goes back into hiding. 884 charactersKhourysBeerGuy, Mar 13, 2011
4.14/5  rDev -7.2%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The color was dark woody brown like a dark tree bark.
Smell of raisin and vanilla. The taste was complex, I could discern the raisin, some spiciness, more vanilla, and finished up with lingering moderate sweetness. 
The spiciness element was a bit biting to the tongue, a little alcohol burn was felt but that's negligible. 
Abacus was a successfully blended barrel-aged brew. The taste was excellent, but I found a lack of uniqueness among these barrel-aged beers. Nevertheless I enjoyed sipping Abacus because it gave me the enjoyment of tasting a recherche and tasty beverage. 582 charactersvince4953529, Mar 12, 2011

It does dissipate rather quickly but leaves behind a lasting bubbly tan ring around the edges. Lacing is expectedly very oily and slides down the side of the glass quickly leaving little to admire.
S: very boozy, sweet, dark sweet fruity/fig like aroma mixed with molasses. Lots of booze, which isn't surprising at 13%
T: Mmmm very nice. The booze is in the nose is very well hidden in the taste. Lots of malt with an earthy hop bitterness. Some mild bourbon, 
M: creamy, smooth, medium bodied, definite throat warming feeling from the high ABV.

T/M-Jesus Christ. This is, as Charlie Sheen once said, "Epic." My 10,000 year old vatican warlock brain can't even begin to comprehend the range of flavors. Deep, lush vanilla sweetness, perfectly integrated bourbon barrel character, creme brulee, fresh whipped honey butter...I'm going to call it. This is the best beer I've had from Firestone Walker.

A-Came out in a small tulip and appeared much darker than i expected. It was a deep ruby color that was bordering on black. Nice tan 1 finger head that had decent retention and left rings on the glass as it went down. Overall looks very appealing.
S-This was my first beer of the night and at first the smell seemed very heavy on bourbon and slighly boozy. I think i was suprised by the heavy nose on this beer and as the night went on it became more and more appealing.
T & M - WOW this is good, i think it delivers a little bit heavier on the nose than on the taste which is a good thing, very complex mix of flavors with some subtle and some strong. Overall a nice barleywine slightly over the top though.
D-Well, I had about 5 of them so it was pretty drinkable however i would not recommend more than one or two in a sitting to truely enjoy it.
Overall, I am excited to get some bottles of this and enjoy over time. Nice work on this one! 1,062 charactersJWD, Mar 09, 2011

received a small pour at the brewery in Paso Robles. poured a dark brown with a small white head. you can tell there is some carbonation in this Barley wine.
the oak aromas seem to over power this beer. there is also a sweet malty back bone with small hints of smoke, bourbon and vanilla 
at first drink the oak takes charge and can be overwhelming at first as the alcohol double teams the pellet. there is a lot going on in this beer. very complex as the flavors are of many different things. Chocolate, cherry, bourbon, vanilla, and coffee start to develope. 
finishes great asking for more i say is not uncommon. well done firestone. 
one of my favorite barleywines. 677 charactersemagana, Mar 05, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed this on tap today at the Tap Room in Buelton, served in a small 5oz snifter. 
A - Is a super dark red almost brown, but more purple than brown. Not much of a head, it had dissipated rather quickly. 
S - You smell some bourbon, but more vanilla and oak notes with some chocolate mixed in between. Also some spices were present, but they didn't dominate over anything else, everything seemed to mess very well together. 
T - This is an awesome roller coaster ride of flavors. It starts out very clean and simple and then just progresses and get more intense as it goes across the entire tongue. There is dark fruit, chocolate, vanilla, and a lot of oak flavor with what could be described as leather. For being 13% you can feel the strength, but it's not something that overly burns the tongue, its quiet delicate and balanced while still being very complex. 
M - For being a bourbon barrel aged is has a decent about of carbonation, its low to mild, I think the perfect amount. And it's on the thicker side, but an easy drink nonetheless, it's also very warming, great for the cold late winter/ early spring day it was. 
D - For being 13% this is a masterpiece, I think this and Parabola are great examples from Firestone. I could drink this all the time. 1,267 charactersMrTopher, Feb 26, 2011
3.63/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Sampled at 1702, Tucson; April 2010
This beer arrives from the tap with a dark, concentrated amber / brown color that shows a clear'ish hue in the light. It is topped by a thin, creamy textured, dark tan to amber-tinged colored head. Bourbon aromatics jump out at me from the get-go; notes of vanillin, coconut, a hint of woody spiciness, lots of oak-wood like fresh cut plank aromas and even a touch of alcohol heat are noticeable. The aroma is quite nice, but leaves me wondering were the aromatics from the base beer are.
The beer is sweet tasting as it first hits my mouth, with a viscous, chewy character that finishes with a hot alcohol and Bourbon spiciness that lingers on the palate; it actually does remind me of sipping on Bourbon. There are lots of flavors reminiscent of vanilla and toasted coconut; wow, the Bourbon barrel really just completely dominates this beer. Luckily the malt is big and sweet enough to carry all the barrel character, but you better really like Bourbon if you are going to enjoy this beer. The base beer really plays a subservient role here. The Barley Wine does contribute a lush texture, with caramelized malt sweetness and some toasted malt character. The beer finishes with a really spicy, almost hot at times, peppery barrel character that lingers on the palate for quite some time.
The vanillin and coconut notes are nice in this beer and it is well accentuated by the malt sweetness, but this is too hot and too Bourbon dominated in the end. If you really like Bourbon then I can see this being quite the enjoyable tipple, but it is perhaps a bit too much for me. 1,611 charactersGueuzedude, Jun 28, 2010

4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4City Beer Store. This was my third time drinking Abacus (past two at Toronado). I'm not the biggest fan of bourbon barrel-aged barleywines, but this is an awesome beer. It pours a deep brownish purplish murk. Virtually no head. Somewhat ominous. The aroma is strong on wonderful bourbon. It's a much more delicate and complex bourbon aroma than most bourbon barrel-aged beers. Bourbon and oak dominate a bit - not that I'm complaining in this particular case - but there are some wonderful malty fruit flavors lurking beneath and even some chocolate and vanilla. The fruit notes come out even more in the flavor. It's sweet but not cloying. It tastes of malt sugars refined by barrel-aging. The beer is thick and warming. Abacus is probably the best barrel-aged barleywine that I've come across. Delicious stuff.
Edit 9/7/12: I don't know if the beer changed or my palate, but this beer has been a lot boozier when I've tried it since my review. It's still quite good, just a bit much. A small taste is all I really want at once. 1,030 characterspopery, May 23, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Pours a murky and super dark red color. Not to much of a head just a very thin layer of bubbles here and there. 
S- Quite a bit of booze is the first thing I noticed. A handful of different spices, a woody smell, a touch of chocolate and pretty much no hops here. 
T- This one follows the nose really well. Alcohol is here but doesn't mask the overall flavors. Very solid tasting. 
M- Full in body and carbonation is perfect. Creamy, smooth and perfect. 
D- Insane, so easy to drink very lucky to have tried it. I would go after this one like crazy to have another glass. 578 charactersnrbw23, May 06, 2010

Amber colored beverage with some burgundy highlights and almost no head to be found. The aroma consists of molasses, maple syrup, candy and light malt. The taste is boozy with the alcohol on the forefront and a medicine-like aftertaste. Reminds me of a port wine. Slight burn on the swallow and a tummy warming sensation as well. It has a numbing effect on the teeth and tongue. As Mr. Furley would say "Smoooth." A definite sipper beer that would go well as an after dinner drink or with a nice cigar. Nice work on this creation. 551 characterskaseydad, May 02, 2010

3.97/5  rDev -11%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I've been anticipating this beer for a while. Glad to have been able to finally try it! Reviewed from notes.
Black opaque, but when held up to the light, some deep browns and rubies are noticeable. Aromas are HUGE: fig, currant, vanilla, and some unmistakable vinous qualities. Lots of anise, too. Flavors are similar, with the anise and vanilla really dominating. A bit of dark rum and sugar in there as well. Plenty of heat on this very strong beer. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I expected, and the carbonation is nice and mellow. I'd want to lay this batch down for about a year and see what happens to the dark fruit flavors. I couldn't drink very much of this at once, but I can see myself sipping on a small snifter of this beer after dinner. 755 characterswashburnkid, Apr 11, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had the pleasure of having this on-tap at the brewery yesterday. Served in a small snifter.
Color is described as "dark ruby," which is apt; much more concise description that mine: a sort of burgandy and copper-tinged rosewood with hints of plum and taupe. A thin whispy collar yields fine bubbles when swirled, a few colonies of which pause on the sides of the glass before receding back onto the surface, driven down slowly by the legs.
The base of 13 is perhaps even better on its own - the myriad nuances contributed by the barrel aging can be better appreciated without the overwhelming variety of aromatics in the blend. Vanilla, butterscotch, and molasses bleed into the malts. Rum, brown sugar, and a hint of oak are suggested as well. Sophisticated and powerful.
Dark cherry, chocolate, German malt, and a touch of Barbaresco on the palate. Nice tannic finish with incredibly deep rich malt complexity; leather, loam, cocoa, roast coffee beans, and tobacco all fight for attention. The hops seem rather restrained in this onslaught, which is the only deficiency I can note.
Light carbonation, mild astringency, maybe a touch thin, but still fairly velvet-like...
Heavy flavors and ABV, but so luscious...nearly impossible to put down the glass. 1,261 charactersaugustgarage, Mar 24, 2010

Pours a very dark brown, mocha color, with just a hint of stone colored head. A very aggressive nose, with bourbon, oak and dark fruit (raisins, plums). Taking the first sip creates an explosion of incredible flavors--loads of bourbon, dark malts, oak, vanilla, dark fruit and maybe just a touch of chocolate. Alcohol is definitely present and noticeable, but adds to, rather than distracts from, the pleasure I get from drinking this one. An absolutely perfect example of bourbon barrel aging. 571 charactersemmasdad, Mar 24, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on tap at Spuyten Duyvil in Brooklyn on 3/22/10.
A: Pours dark as heck for a barleywine with great lacing, and no head in sight. I really can't comment on the color as the lighting was dim.
S: Toffee, booze, dark fruits. Opens up as it's exposed to oxygen and warms to room temperature.
T: Complex and rich! Caramel, booze, brown sugar, and chocolate covered black cherries with a bitter finish.
M: Well carbed (as it should be from the lines), and warms the palate and everything else on the way down. Finishes dry.
D: Packs a boozy punch but is balanced because the beer is not filling.
This beer does not resemble a barleywine in my opinion, but what a treat anyways! Thanks to the guys at Spuyten Duyvil! 718 charactershoppymcgee, Mar 24, 2010

A reddish brown color with a small, off-white head that dissipates quite quickly. 
Aromas of stewed fruit (like raisin), cocoa, molasses, and Bourbon.
Not much in the way of carbonation. Flavors of chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, coconut, raisin, and fig.
This is a Barleywine? I feel like I've been missing a lot with the others I've drunk, but everything works here. Much more drinkable. 435 charactersJerryBullfrog, Mar 23, 2010

A: The pour is a dark, rich amber color with a small off-white (perhaps beige) head.
S: The nose has an incredibly rich fruitiness to it which I really was not expecting. Plenty of sugar, caramel, bourbon, vanilla and oak in the nose as well.
T: The nose gave this one a lot to live up to, and I'm happy to say the flavors delivered! A lot of caramel and toffee sweetness, obviously, but also some really great barrel character as well. The bourbon, vanilla, oak, and even some hop bitterness really round this beer out.
M: The body is very full with a low level of carbonation that works well here.
D: Normally you don't associate barleywines with easy drinking, but this one is so smooth and delicious that it's easy to keep going back for more. I can't wait until this is bottled. 845 characterswomencantsail, Feb 25, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Firestone Walker brewery.
Served a dark brown with a very small off white creamy head. Minimal and somewhat oily appearing lacing left behind.
The aroma was caramel, molasses, lots of bourbon, oak and perhaps a bit of raisin.
The taste was a mixture of the above, with what seemed like chocolate and even vanilla in there as well. Very complex and the character changed as the beer warmed. The alcohol also provided plenty of warming too.
The mouthfeel was slick, smooth and creamy, and without the stickiness found in many barleywines.
I'm not a huge fan of barleywines, mainly due to the overly sweet and sticky properties so many of them seem to have. This Abacus however was nothing like that at all. Easily one of the best, if not the best barleywine I've ever had. If you happen to see it anywhere, it's definitely worth a try. 852 charactersJBogan, Feb 20, 2010

a - pours a deep golden color, pretty hazy, one inch ivory head with decent retention and lacing
s - lots of caramel malt and toffee mixed with lighter notes of citrusy hop, some bourbon note with oak and vanilla, very interesting aroma
t - very nicely balanced taste with big caramel and tofee notes mixed with citrusy hop bitterness, mid-palate has a considerable but not overwhelming bourbon and oak component that mixes very well with the caramel and citrusy notes, finish is mildly sweet with prominent bourbon flavors, not overly sweet and well-balanced for a big barleywine, the alcohol is there but not as prominent as many barleywines
m - medium-to-full bodied, moderate to lower carbonation, slightly sweet finish, very nice alcohol warming
d - incredibly drinakable for the style, not overly sweet or alcohol, relatively easy on the palate, and a complex taste
This definitely lived up to the hype and exceeded my expectations. Very nuanced and drinkable big barleywine. I look forward to Firestone bottling this later this year. 1,109 charactersWeisGuy, Feb 08, 2010

Tap at Toronado 22nd Anniversary, then later at Monk's Kettle in SF for the Firestone Walker dinner.
Murky dark brown color with purplish hues and a small off-white head.
Aroma is sweet malt, oak, roast, bourbon, and dark fruits. Smells prettty, prettty awesome.
Flavor is caramel malt, roasted malt, bourbon, plum, fig, raisin, vanilla, oak, and alcohol. Really complex and good.
Palate creamy with low carbonation. Slight booze, but not much for 12% ABV. Drinkability is not awesome, but it's pretty high for what the beer is. 1,081 charactersnickd717, Dec 11, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cellared keg from 2008, enjoyed on draught at Beachwood BBQ. Pours exceptionally dark in color, which could easily confuse it for an imperial stout. Compact and dense dark tan head is under a centimeter tall. Aromas of toffee, brandy, and spicy hops come through. Tastes of toffee, raw sugar, brandy, leather, and maple. Finish is increasingly spicy, with a floral, almost phenolic finish. Heavy in body, chewy and smooth, yet with prickly medium carbonation that makes for a perfect barleywine feel. One of the best barrel aged barleywines on the planet. Exceptional flavor that can be savored for extended periods of time. 624 charactersvacax, Dec 10, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally! I've wanted to try this one for so long and it's been around in a couple bars in San Diego but I've just never been able to make it over to taste this. After sharing a few beers with fellow BAs floydster and hophead84 on Oct.31st we decided to head over to Hamilton's for a pint or two. I had been checking Hamilton's tap list pretty much every day for at least a month because they had Abacus on their "On Deck" list and to my good fortune something tapped out while we were there and what do they replace it with? Abacus! I still wasn't done drinking my first pint but I went over to the bar right away and got me a nice 10oz pour of Abacus to warm up while I finished my first round.
This beer was pitch black for a barleywine, seemed more like a stout than a bw. No head adorned the top of the beer as it was poured too cold.
The aroma was pretty darn good and the beer first greeted me with some roasted malts, toast, chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, and hints of grapes. A subtle note of alcohol hid in the background.
Wow, didn't think the taste would be better than the aroma but it was. Bold toast flavor, chocolate, raisins, toffee, almonds, flaked toasted coconut in the finish with vanilla and oak. Notes of bakers chocolate. This beer was delicious. A low carbonation helped to bring a creaminess to the beer, making it run down smoothly down the tongue. I could have easily had another one of these if we didn't have to leave so early. Will have to try harder to make it to any bar that has this one next time. 1,559 charactersseaoflament, Nov 24, 2009

A: very dark brown and very opaque. Fair amount of tan white head with pretty small bubbles. Head retention is pretty good, lacing is good.
S: bourbon barrel aged... Why yes SUPER bourbon character on the nose... a blind tasting might make you think it was a mild bourbon on the rocks. Also there is a good amount of chocolate as well as vanilla bean.
T: Very rich, vanilla bourbon sweetness with some oak as well. This one is sweet finishing and I would definitely say it's a dessert beer. I get long finishing flavors of chocolate and toffee. There is a little bit of warming alcohol but not in a bad way. Not tons of complexity, but pretty freaken good.
M: sooo rich and mouthfilling its silly
D: mouthfeel draws you back for more more easily than it should be to drink this rich viscous liquid. So points for that but overall not very drinkable. 993 charactersflannelman808, Nov 19, 2009

This is the second beer I've had at this event that has simply floored me with its silky rich yummy goodness. Pours deep amber to near dark brown and micro thin tan head. Wow! Another knee buckler aroma with a smooth blended mixture of wood, molasses, rich dark fruity esters and more rich molasses. The wood notes become mildly brighter upon further inspection. The taste is just amazing with some smooth bourbon flowing into deep rich dark fruity esters accented with well rounded smooth wood notes. Just a smooth beer that gets almost velvety for a while. It dries out a tad into the finish. 640 charactersBigMcLargeHuge, Oct 06, 2009

More tar flavors in the taste, some roastiness, quite bitter- almost quinine like, followed by vinous qualities that are fruity and strong, almost reminiscent of Port wine. On the finish there is a hit of unsweetened black licorice. Strong and thick in the mouth, this beer bears more than a passing resemblance to an Imperial Stout, but with some rich sweet notes of an American Strong as well. I wouldn't really call this a Barley Wine, but whatever it is it's mighty tasty. 779 charactersGeorgiabeer, Sep 20, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Toronado a couple times - got a preview before the big party thanks to an extremely generous and amazing bartender. Served in a small tulip glass.
A - One and a half fingers of tan foam with surprisingly good retention that dissipates to a ring - pretty impressive considering the alcohol. Attractive hazed dark red/brown color, although I think it gets darker as one nears the bottom of the keg.
S - Burnt sugars, dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, wood, cocoa, molasses, a touch of booze. It's amazing - the only knock is the slight harshness of the alcohol as it warms up.
T - Thankfully the alcohol heat doesn't show up at all in the taste, which otherwise is just as good, if not better, than the aroma. The complexity and depth of flavor is immaculately preserved. When I think of barrel-aged barleywines, this flavor is my reference sample.
M - Low carbonation, medium-thick body, some light alcohol heat as it goes down. Pretty much spot on for the style.
D - It's a slow sipper, and at 12% it can quickly wear down my sobriety, just as fast as the intense flavor wears down my palate. Just a touch less drinkable than the awesome 10, as this batch seemed a little younger and hotter. 1,214 charactersMasterSki, Aug 19, 2009
4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: Dark brown, like prune juice, appears clear, w/almost nonexistent brown head.
Smell: So complex. Prunes/raisins, alcohol, woody.
Taste/mouthfeel: Very viscious+full mouthfeel. No carbonation feel. Delicious taste the same as smell w/addition of chocolatiness.
After: alcohol warming. Raisiny alcohol lingers.
Overall: Exceptional. I tried this @Toronado 22nd party mostly because I saw it won the Toronado BW fest earlier this year. Definitely solid and 12%abv not noticeable. Very dangerous! Similar to Older Viscosity or Bourbon AS. Technically a BW but could almost pass as an old ale, strong ale, or even stout. 631 charactersbret27, Aug 16, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5About a 10 ounce pour in a plastic cup at Darklord day 2009. Body is a blackish brown mocha tone that hosts only a rim of skim tan head. Nose is brilliant with tones of bourbon and candied, dark fruit based malts. There is a soft rustic hint of a hop profile there also. Loads of bourbon initially flood the tongue. This is quickly followed by a very sweet malt character with tones of dark fruit like raisins and plums. All the time keeping a well balanced background hop character that adds nice zing and balance. Lots of vanilla and even some cordial chocolate show up. Mouthfeel is thick and desert like, very nice. Super smooth and attractively drinkable. This is one of the best Barleywines I have had. Firestone Walker, please bottle this one. 750 charactersSPLITGRIN, Aug 03, 2009

12% abv.
On-tap into small snifter
Appearance= Not black like I thought it was last time. Dark brown. The initial pour off the tap was a minute brown head that quickly dissipated into a thin ring of lace around the edge.
Smell= Booze. Bourbon, oak, vanilla. As it warms it begins to open up nicely.
Taste= Fucking Tasty. Bourbon, butterscotch, vanilla. Alcohol is hidden well for being 12%. Tap my vein with this shit already!
Mouthfeel= Smooth. A little on the thick side, but thin enough to really enjoy. Light Carbonation.
Drinkability= Very Drinkable. I could drink this all day. As a matter of fact, I'm on my 6th glass and not looking back. Alcohol is hidden very well in the taste. Very dangerous elixir! Bottle this already... 788 charactersGrabbin2nd, May 15, 2009

I love barley wines, so I was excited to try this. Poured in a small snifter. Small white head, dark like a porter - red hues. Great aromas, smokey and woody, dried fruits and nutmeg. Really superb aromas. Let it warm up a bit and it just intesifies. Tastes of bourbon & vanilla, smoke & oak. Finishes so perfectly, the 12% ABV is hardly noticable. 
This is one excellent barleywine. Very bourbon-oriented and has all elements you would expect from it. Firestone rocks. 490 charactersDijonKetchup, May 15, 2009

A: Fairly dark--especially for the style. Some reddish highlights with a light, cream-colored head.
S: Oak, roasted malt, chocolate, and bits of vanilla. The oak definitely came through, as I had this not too longer after sampling the Oak Aged DL.
T: Fairly-roasted malt with some caramel/toffee taste as well as a certain earthiness to the underlying malt. On top of this lies some of the oak/wood flavors as well as characteristics of chocolate and hints of vanilla. A bit of bourbon in there, too.
M: Very chewy and quite heavy. Fairly low carbonation.
D: Quite drinkable, as the alcohol is hidden, but not too much. 671 charactersThorpe429, May 01, 2009

Big thick monstrous barley wine with decent hopping on the finish. Hints of RS with a boubony middle and vanilla toasty oak induced middle-finish. Dried fruits and a hint of currant. Caramel and date with mollasses and chocolate. Delicious. 417 charactersmcallister, Apr 28, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed two monstrous glasses of this fantastic beer at Beachwood on 4/24/09.
A: A very dark looking beer...almost stout-like in many ways, with mellow hues of reddish wine. Right on top of this rested an average looking ½-inch head that head it's retention for a substantial amount of time. Lacing had some clinging qualities after a few vigorous swirls and gulps I might add...but nothing to write home about.
S: Definite booziness off the bat that soon dissipated, revealing complex aromas that included cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spice-like notes that further balanced the sweet maltiness I was also picking up.
T: One of those beers that taste exactly like the aroma indicates; an abundance of sweet malts (which came through as a more syrupy type flavor) that were delicately balance out by the variety of spices that were hard to figure out. The bourbon also shined through a bit more in the flavor profile, and didn't overwhelm the palate like barrel-aged brews tend to do. The alcohol was also on the strong side as well...but again, didn't take away from any of the flavors. 
M: Absolutely perfect for a BA Barleywine; light on the carbonation, full-bodied, and slightly creamy. WOW!
D: For the style and everything that came along with it...a perfect 5! Flavor profile was off the charts, and even though the alcohol content may have been a bit too strong...it didn't deter me from having two. I really should have had three...lol.
Overall: Wow! And this is the stuff that comprised (at least I believe) 40% or so of Firestone 10. A really beautiful beer and a top five barleywine for me as well. Seek this beer out and enjoy. Cheers! 1,653 charactersOlieIPA, Apr 27, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Beachwood.
Pours a deep, opaque brown with extremely light, bubbly head that disappears almost instantly. No lacing to speak of.
Aroma of bourbon, wood, vanilla and dark fruit. The alcohol presence can be felt a bit as well. 
Flavor is fantastic. Starts with a nice combo of sweet malty syrup, a touch of cocoa and the dark fruit (raisin, plum) and meets up beautifully with the bourbon oak finish that stays on the tongue. Tasty stuff to be sure.
Mouthfeel is lighter for a barrel aged brew like this, but I think it adds to the experience. Nice level of carbonation and not too syrupy leads to an amazing drinkability factor. I highly recommend making an effort to try this one. 694 charactersmoosington, Apr 25, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Beachwood BBQ,
A: Pours an exceptionally dark brown, with a light bubbly head, imposing and inviting at the same time.
S: Heavy bourbon and vanilla, wood, black cherry, and volatile ethanol, great to smell, more spiritous in the nose than beer-like. Reminds me of FW11, though none of Abacus was in that ale.
T: Big oak, maple sugar and roasted malt notes hit first, and the bourbon just smooths it all out. Great malt flavour.
M: Smooth, full-bodied, alcoholic for sure but it melds well with the overall flavours.
D: Another outstanding barrel aged product from Firestone, they've certainly found a niche they excel at. 636 charactersHalcyondays, Apr 24, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap over at Beachwood BBQ. Considering Firestone X is my fave of the anniversary series, very excited to try the "base" beer of it. 
Pours kind of a murky brown with a slight crust of bubbles. Tried to hold it to the light or slosh it a bit to get a better looking color ... yeah, it's pretty much brown.
Smells of bourbon, vanilla, and a bit of boozy dark fruit. Taste is really fantastic. The bourbon is understated, and a nice, earthy oak-ey component begins to make an appearance. There's vanilla with a dash of chocolate, and a definite dark, sweet, pancake syrup-ey dark fruit component. It's a boozy, thick beer, but still pretty drinkable. 
Fantastic, and a must have. 682 charactersOverlord, Apr 24, 2009

This beer pours a deep and murky brown/black into a snifter glass. Zero head leads to zero lacing and such, but alas I'm distracted as we speak.
Smell is of bourbon barrels, alcohol and some deep plum and cherry/chocolate on the nose. Taste follows with notes of the barrel and a very lingering close...nice..
Good feel and the drinkability is extravagant given the potency, as the alcohol is present on the nose but not on the tongue. 488 charactersHalfFull, Apr 24, 2009

Earthy caramel and bread dough aroma with vanilla, oak, and whiskey. Boozy. Viscous, non-carbonated mouthfeel gave it the character of a liquer. Strong caramel and cherry flavors up front, then moves into the earthy, alcoholic oaken malt flavors. Somewhat of a mix between whiskey and cognac in the background. Long, sticky finish that tastes resiny, but without the bite. Definitely a sipper, but a great one at that. 505 charactersmagictrokini, Apr 21, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this on tap at the 2009 Toronado Barleywine Festival, 3oz taster.
Had almost no head, little bit of a haze on top. Reddish brown with some purple mixed in there too. Almost a cherry cola color but with the purple added in there too.
Smell was almost perfect, it just needed a little more complexity and it would be a 5. I smell plum mostly, but it's more than that, there's some cherry and even some pepper in there too.
Now the taste, that is exceptional... The best tasting barleywine I've ever had infact. Starts out with some caramel, then into the cherry alcohol and plum. Raisins are present too, along with figs and black currants, and an undertone of chocolate the whole way through. Vanilla creeps up at the end before finishing a little earthy with a hint of spice and a little bit of paper.
Very nice mouthfeel, a pleasure to swirl. 
Good drinkability, and an overall awesome treat. Firestone Walker's big beers are second to none. Now if I could only get my hands on some Parabola... 1,004 charactersBubba83, Apr 21, 2009

A-Medium to dark brown with some mahogany highlights, minimal 1/4 inch creamy light tan head that lasted no longer than a minute, no lacing either, nice legs though
S-Lots of oak, light bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, bread, and molasses
T-Starts off with a nice sweet carmel flavor, middle is whiskey and three years in an old Heaven Hill barrel did wonders on this part, earthiness and sweet vanilla in the finish, dark fruits do not come out until way later but the vanilla provides a nice sweetness all the way through, like the bourbon component as well, creamy and buttery toffee that I love in barleywines, a little bit of maple syrup by the end that mixed well with the vanilla, great balance and not overpowering with any one flavor
M-Warm, chewy, sugary, dry, and slightly sweet mouthfeel, full bodied, light level of carbonation, aftertaste lasts about thirty seconds
D-Alcohol is hidden very well and does not seem anything like eleven percent, very good overall drinkability, only complaint with it is that the oaky dry finish can get heavy after drinking it for a while
Firestone's barrel aged program is showing why it is one of the best in the country, their three blends thus far have been fantastic and same with every beer that makes those up, I just went out to grab a beer after a rough day at work and stumbled upon this masterpiece, wish I knew it about it before because I would have been there when they opened and had several more of these, this beer is going to create some serious hype as it circulates through the state, I cannot wait to have more, highly recommended 1,861 charactersFloydster, Apr 11, 2009

Served on tap out of snifter, was 11abv. %. These are the notes I jotted down on the bottom of my receipt.
A - Black as night, as I got towards the bottom I could discern that it was a deep auburn. No head retention, decent lace.
S - Fig, raisin, dark chocolate. Maybe a little nutty tho couldn't tell.
T - Delish. Dark chocolate right up front, malty and very smooth. Cherries in the back. No real taste of the bourbon, was aged for 3 yrs, so was really mellow.
D - Definitely strong. Would like to have this paired with some chocolate, or maybe a smoked cheese. Wished they could bottle this stuff.
M - not too heavy, good body and feel to it. 820 charactersNewmerator, Mar 23, 2009

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A re-review almost a year later - was again on tap at CBS (3/09) and again delicious. 
Had on tap at City Beer Store in SF following the barrel-aged week and was really surprised to see it still available today. 
A: Mahogany brown with a medium to light head. Very little if any lacing. 
S: Sweet, malty with a bit of smokiness and brandy (delicious). Hopp undertones but well balanced.
T: Fantastic and completely agree with an earlier review - as it warms up the real flavors surface (carmel, toffee, butterscotch, etc.). There is a slight hoppy finish at the end although crisp - no lingering bitterness.
M: Chewy (although a bit overused as a descriptor - this term definitely applies) great mouthfeel. The kind of beverage that you want to linger in your mouth for a bit to pick up all the flavors. 
D: Unbelievably drinkable for the high abv - and can definitely sneak up on you making the following day's work pretty much useless. Like a well-polished brandy or whisky this one goes down quite easily and brings a smile to your face.
This is definitely one of the best barleywines that I have had and look forward to future availability. Firestone (although seemingly focused on pale ales based on their website) needs to either bottle this or produce/distribute more of this and the Parabola. They're definitely on to something here. 1,348 charactersJoeySchlitz, Mar 05, 2009

Have since tried it two other times: at the brewery (03-11-09) and at Spike's again (05-14-09). Following review was written by Wisemen Nick and Justin.
Poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Body is almost totally opaque and cola-colored. A very thin, tight, brown halo sits on top and drags no lacing whatsoever. Looks slick and oily, much like an old ale. N: 3.5; J: 3.0
EDIT (03-11-09): We each had this on-tap at the brewery today and noted that it looked much nicer than before. A fluffy, tan head sat on top and drug pretty good lacing. Also, the body showed more transparency; notably, shades of deep amber and red. N: 4.0; J: 4.0
Smell: Bourbon, chewing tobacco, molasses, oak, vanilla, and something else. Oh, there it is! Cherries! Old, sour, sticky, mushed up, alcohol-soaked cherries. Fantastic! N: 5.0; J: 4.5
Taste: Unbelievable. "Dangerously delicious", claims Justin. (He stuck around and had three more of 'em after I left.) Bourbon, vanilla extract, oak syrup, loads of malt, sour cherries, and more. Not harsh at all for such a high ABV. We each wanted to give this a 4.75 on taste, but the site won't allow it. N: 4.5; J: 4.5 
(Justin Edit: Call me crazy, but the more I drink Abacus the more I realize that it's my favorite beer of all time. February 17, 2010. I'm changing taste to 5.0; Wiseman Nick you can't fault me for this, it's so damn good.)
Mouthfeel: Oily, sugary, and definitely chewy. Low carbonation, full body, warm, and surprisingly smooth. Coats the entire mouth instantly, and then lingers. N: 4.5; J: 4.0
Drinkability: A definite sipper, and a marvelous one at that. Nick thought it was fantastic right off the bat, but we all agreed that it gets even better as it warms. This is downright dangerous. I (Nick) badly wanted another, but had previous engagements to attend to. Justin on the other hand... well... he got drunk off of Abacus. Bastard. N: 5.0; J: 5.0
EDIT (03-11-09): Justin and I each ordered a couple of snifters at the brewery today and were in heaven. The lady wasn't too happy about us ordering multiple Abaci, but either one of us would've happily stayed there all day drinking it. Fantastic!
EDIT (05-14-09): Justin and I got to try this again at Spike's last night (along with cask Walker's Reserve and cask Unfiltered DBA). Still phenomenal! Justin drank five of 'em. RJ (Grabbin2nd) had eight!
Wiseman Nick: A+ (4.55)

The beers pours a dark mahogany with rich red tones. The smell is subtle and doesn't 
The taste was just amazing. I have had many barlywines but I have never had one so well balanced and even flavored. The beer is rich without being overly biter or too hoppy. 
Its very smooth and not too heavy in the mouth. Not too sweet, which is one of my biggest complaints about many Barleywines. It has a nice velvety mouthfeel that is not too heavy and is definitely the kind of beer you could enjoy of few of on a stormy night. Subtle flavors of chocolate and coffee. 
The ABV is 13% but I never noticed it. I think the Bigfoot has a stronger alcohol flavor than this, and I don't notice much in the Bigfoot. The Abacus was far smoother than any Barleywine I have ever had. 
I was blown away when I tried this, I heard it placed second in the SF Barleywine festival and it deserves it. Firestone is making some fantastic special releases. 1,043 characterstjsprague, Feb 17, 2009

Old review: Going to review this one off memory from a little over a week ago, so not going to be able to do as intricate a review. General principles still hold. Had at City Beer Store in SF during their Barrel Aged Week
A: Poured black, off-white head a finger or two deep

T: Wow. Creamy alcohol, caramel, vanilla oak. So damn smooth and rich.
M: About as good as it gets. Mouth-filling and complex
D: Unbelievably drinkable for a "barleywine". So damn smooth and delicious.
A different type of barleywine than the sugary high alcohol set (although this one ain't no session beer). Just an awesome beer. Would drink it every night if I could. 1,059 charactersabfraser, Aug 29, 2008

A - Dark, malty appearance. Very rich, dark caramel color. Little or no foam.

T - Great tasting barleywine that definitely tastes better as it warms up. The surprisingly hoppy after taste subdues as the beer warms up.
M - not as syrupy as I expected it to be. A little more acidic than I thought it was. However, in general, it has the mouthfeel you would expect for a barleywine.

10 oz pour into a small tulip pint glass. Deep auburn in color, with a certain coppery shimmer that only high alcohol beers have. Minimal head with no lacing.
Smell is very strong and sweet, sort of like a less extreme Utopias. Whiskey is the main note, maybe with some dark fruits.
The flavor here is really similar to scotch but with less alcohol bite. Peaty and oaky, with lots of sweet malt and booze-soaked fruit.
Mouthfeel is too low on carbonation but the viscosity is spot-on for a big bad barleywine and the finish is shockingly dry on the tongue. 593 charactersillidurit, Mar 06, 2008

Poured a deep ruby brown with a small off-white lace.
The aroma was full of rich caramel malt, bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Some alcohol was present.
The flavor of the beer had a rich caramel maltiness appropriate for the style. It was well attenuated and didn't finish too sweet. It was well infused with prominent notes of bourbon, vanilla, and oak, which added tremendous complexity. Some medium dried fruits came through in the palate as well.
The mouthfeel was medium-to-heavy, but not overly so. The body was full and creamy. The carbonation was delicate and dialed in just right.
A superb barleywine that exhibits a wonderful spirit barrel character. From my understanding, this was a blend from several different barrels. 791 charactersSacoDeToro, Feb 21, 2008
