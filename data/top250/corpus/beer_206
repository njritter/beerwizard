L: pours very thick and dark red. It's black in the glass with no head.
A: black licorice/molasses, slight barrel, some typical for the style brown sugar sweetness.
T: just like the nose. Unfortunately not the flavors I seek. Huge molasses on beer his one. The molasses is so over powering it's hard to anything else.
F: high carbonation makes this tingly and I taste a good amount of alcohol.  It is thick and syrupy but though.
O: very disappointed with this one. 485 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Apr 08, 2017

4.51/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a rich and robust, deep brown with merely a nickel's width of fizzy khaki head rising to the top. This is a bottle from 2014, stored in a cellar. All things considered, it's a good look. Aroma is huge, with notes of bourbon, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, and barley. Each note hits with power, and is well executed. Flavor profile is bourbon, caramel, toffee, roasted malts with an earthy, barley finish. It's absolutely every bit of robust, and yet slips down smooth. The earthy finish is hearty, and may be a little polarizing. Mouth feel is smooth, and medium-thick. Overall, the presence in this beer is absolutely in the flavor profile. Aroma is great, with a hearty feel, but the flavor profile is deep and complex, and yet slippery smooth. The 14% ABV hides in well. 
Served in a teku glass. Consumed and reviewed on 2/17/17. 2014 vintage bottle. 862 charactersHarrison8, Feb 18, 2017

Pours a deep brown almost black, stout looking body with a brown head that reduces pretty quickly to leave a ring of retention and no lacing. 
Aromas are sweet with caramel, bourbon, butterscotch, sweet vanilla, chocolate. On the tongue is an initial sticky sweetness, sweet caramel and bourbon a little boozy, sticky and sweet, chocolate, lightly roasty, vanilla and butterscotch. Thick, rich and low carbonation. 
A solid barleywine, super sweet. 503 charactersgcamparone, Jan 27, 2017

Pours deep rustic autumn brown with ruby golden hue. Oily and aggressive looking beer. Aromas are oak, bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, figs and dates. Flavors are similar with a very nice aged silky feel. One of the best barleywines I've had. 
Pure and simple barrel aged luxury. 439 charactersGOBLIN, Jan 01, 2017
4.74/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- The beer poured a deep murky brown color with some white bubbles crowning the glass. 
Smell - There was a huge malty, boozy, sweet dark fruit nose.  
Taste - I first noted sweet dark rich fruit. Rich dark chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and roasted nuts.  I think what amazed me most was how well balanced the booze was with the diverse palette of taste The richness continues in the aftertaste with a slight alcohol burn. 
Mouthfeel - Almost syrupy in feel, this coats the tongue nicely. 
Overall - MoaS is a fantastic beer. The only barleywine I might like better is Sucaba. 594 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 01, 2017

This pour was a tad flat, though the other pour had a thin rim.
Nose is baked date bread with a bourbon kick.
Flavor is chocolate licorice sweet/spicy with a bit of fig, and this gives me more of a Quad impression.  The bourbon that comes in gives me some alcohol heat, but a pleasant one.  Fairly thick and silky feel that coats the palate.
A powerful and full bodied/flavored offering that might just lack a little in nuance.  A very general thought would be that of a chocolate covered liqueur  candy, though a tasty quad-like one. 545 characterscjgiant, Dec 26, 2016

A - pours a dark murky brown, with an off-white head that quickly recedes into  thin ring leaving alcohol legs everywhere it's been...like a gangsta mother that doesn't want to be seen or heard but leaves a trail of dead bodies in her wake.
S - doesn't let the cold temperature bother her one bit. Raisins for days, with liquid caramel, torched brown sugar, dates and prunes by the boatloads. Traces of almonds and toasted wood, which I predict will only grow stronger as the beer warms up.
T- opens sweet and....oh crap... this is one motherful load of malty goodness. Ok.. gathering my senses now.. let's see.. raisins, dried stone fruits(dates, prunes...etc), brown sugar, molasses, almonds, toffee. Getting some vanilla and coconut as well, not quite as intense as the FW ones, but it's definitely there. Warming alcohol noticed as the liquid makes its way down.
M- very full, and welcoming so. A fantastic winter warmer.
O- in the pantheons of the great BBA Barley wines, this brew stands atop. 1,086 charactersgshak, Dec 07, 2016

For some reason I'm not in the mood to write a typical review.  It looks exactly like it's described in the other reviews.  Smells and tastes just like a barrel aged barleywine should.  Being an English style barleywine, it's strongly sweet with a firm bread flavor and no noticeable hop balance.  There's also a strong booziness, it is 14% alcohol, but not masked.  That will probably decrease with age but i don't think I could take the increase in sweetness that would happen.  If you like English style beers then step right up. 550 charactersstratusjeans, Jul 15, 2016

4.71/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Milky light molasses body, light tan head fades to nothing, notable carbonation around the perimeter. Heavy buttery caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and mild smokiness on the nose. Other mild aspects that weave in and out include a tartness like red fruit, burnt turbinado sugar, and controlled, subtle alcohol. The flavor brings to light that red fruit flavor in the form of dark red cherries, along with molasses, wet wood pulp, a kiss of bourbon sweetness, spice and coziness, very rich caramel and toffee that is offset by burnt malt bitterness. The body is super sticky, only *moderately* heavy and full, and slightly warming. Just a hint of tannins.
I have a hard time believing this thing is 14% when the alcohol is so subtle, but that could also be because there are HUGE yet palatable, varied but balanced, delicious but mature flavors going on as well. Everything was in magnificent harmony and came together to deliver one scrumptious wallop of a beer. Simply incredible. 976 characters1000lbgrizzly, Jun 23, 2016

N: Bourbon with vanilla in the back seat.
T: My first thought, this is just like Backwards Bastard, then as it warms and
as the 14% abv puts a small burn in your stomach, I realize this is Backwards Bastard
on steroids. Bourbon very present in the taste, vanilla moves farther in the background.
F: average for the style.
O: MOAS is less of an English Barleywine to me and more of a Wee Heavy/Scotch
Ale. I like higher abv brews and the alcohol is quite prominent but never harsh. I have another
I will continue to age. This was a 2014 bottle. 589 charactersJebBeerFish, May 14, 2016

Look: Big deep molasses brown. 
Aroma: Its too boozy. The alcohols over power the bounty of subtle aromas. But it smells like bourbon s'mores. 
Taste: Some things in this world just taste like quality. This is one of them. It is rich, it is layered, and it is complex. The beer is 14% abv, yet drinking an entire bomber seems effortless. The bourbon flavor is dense, packed between notes of rich cacao and sweet cherries. It finishes long with a fruit leather sweetness and a bourbon bite.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is oaky, tannic, and sticky. 
Overall: This is, or should be, the benchmark for massive bourbon barrel aged English barleywines. Its drinkable, its sweet, it bourbony, and its expensive. But the dollar per delicious sip ratio is very favorable. 775 charactersBrotherDylan, Apr 14, 2016

Beer pours a dark brown/black, with a very mild head.  Smell is of great Kentucky bourbon, backed by a brown sugar sweetness.  Taste follows nose - the bourbon here is *extremely* smooth and well-rounded.  every sip is laced with bourbon, but never in an overpowering way.  Nothing is hot, and everything is in balance with the base beer.  Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style - moderate carbonation.  All in all a great beer, if only it weren't so pricey :). 580 charactersGoneARye, Feb 29, 2016

3.98/5  rDev -10%look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4This is review of 2013 vintage. Bottle is around 2 1/4 years old at this point. 
Pours an extremely dark brown, looks closer to an imperial stout than a barleywine. Head is very thin and mocha colored. Head retention was non existent and neither was lacing. 
Smell is big on caramel, burnt sugar, brandy soaked figs, vanilla, and oak. Bourbon is slightly present but blends nicely. No hops apparent, this is a malt bomb.  
Taste is very sweet and somewhat dry. Burnt caramel, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and slight oxidation are main flavors detected. As beer warms I'm getting big hits of dried fruit, prune, fig, and dates. That along with some warming alcohol gives the beer a false sense of being aged in cognac barrels rather than bourbon. Maybe the prolonged aging is to blame for that. Hops are nowhere to be found, sweet malt and alcohol is the name of the game here. 
Mouthfeel is oily, dense, and somewhat undercarbonated. Alcohol is slightly astringent, head was never a factor unfortunately. 
Overall, beer was good, solid representation of the style. Just wish there was more head and a bit more carbonation. Maybe 2 years in the bottle have diminished some of the qualities that were present in 2014 when I had this beer at Gabf 1,251 charactersangelmonster, Jan 29, 2016

Caramel, brown sugar, molasses, bourbon. All the usual suspects. Starts sweet, rich and decadent. I get what I can only describe as a peanut butter middle which is actually quite enjoyable. Finish quite bitter, true to style. Bourbon warmth lingers.

Head is just a skim but I can't fault that to much for that in a big brew like this that has aged two years.  Nose is a creamy sweet and laced with tons of dark fruit.  Smells great. Spicy bourbon and zesty dark fruit bounce off each other to give such a ballet of balance.  Toffee and spicy bourbon cream are so tasty here. This is a well constructed masterpiece. 442 charactersSPLITGRIN, Nov 14, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a surprisingly dark cola-brown; minimal mocha head, quickly disappearing to a thin residue. Clear on the edges.
Strong bourbon, boozy aroma. Plenty of toffee, chocolate, dark fruit, and oak. Nuts and caramel grain. Coconut and vanilla. The more I sniff this brew, the more it reminds me of BCBBW, which is very high praise.
Flavor follows. It's strong and sweet, with chocolate and bourbon up front, and a massive, coconut-and-vanilla bourbon finish. All along, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, and fruit ride along the bourbon wave.
Shockingly thick feel. Very full bodied, but still lively. Clearly a hot brew, but easy drinking considering the 14% ABV.
As a very rare occasion, this is the kind of brew that truly lives up to the hype. I mentioned that the aroma reminded me of BCBBW; the flavor and feel do, as well. Exceptional BA BW. 846 charactersRoguer, Nov 03, 2015

Pours a deep, deep, dark ruby. looking black in the glass with a mocha colored head.
Smell is of rich bourbon, oak, raisin, dark fruit, sweet vanilla with a leathery subtlty.
Taste has an intense bourbon and oak, supporting the molasses and vanilla. Some slight coconut notes masked by some smoke and dark candied stone fruit.  Barrel and bourbon are present but the beer is not hot. Just the right amount. As the beer warms the smoke and raisin character become more prevalent. Sweet but not cloying.
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Not too heavy though.
Overall an amazing beer worthy of its praise. The flavors meld together very well into a complex and entertaining beer that shows you something new with every sip. 735 charactersBigRedDog, Sep 28, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52014 release. Pours a deep, dark umber with a very thin layer of head that dissipates within minutes. Smells marvelous, full of oak, toasted oats, caramel, and vanilla. Thick and unctuous on the tongue, it tastes like raisin liqueur, caramel candies, cinnamon, and brown sugar, with a hefty, boozy kick. Complex, and with a finish that lasts for days, this is an exemplar of barrel-ageing, with oak, heavily-wheated whiskey, dark buckwheat or avocado honey, and nougat all mingling happily together. The high alcohol content is quite evident, but it doesn't drink hot or unpleasantly; the booziness stands up against the sweetness of the flavors and counters the low carbonation by adding some intensity to the experience. A beer to sip and savor. 747 charactersdarktronica, Aug 14, 2015

Out of this world. Cracked this open with a few buddies to try out. Poured a nice burnt brown color and a sugary/spice aroma comes through. 
Hit the pallet a bit thick, but wasn't overpowering. Tastes of brown sugar and spice land gently and every sip tasted better than the previous. 
I've heard that this beer is almost overpowering if opened too early, but having one that's 4 years old it wasn't the case.

Ruby glints. No head. 
It smells deep and boozy, with toasty brown sugar. 
Sugar deep and rich and spicy fun. It's a bit flat, but the burnt fruity booziness carries throughout everything. 
Good but not great. Wouldn't have again. 346 charactersAgentMunky, Jul 10, 2015

3.96/5  rDev -10.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had total lack of impulse control when I saw this in Chuck's Hop Shop while visiting Seattle. I paid $25.99 for a fricking bomber. Still shaking my head with buyer's remorse. But it was a serious memory-making event to sip on a 4-oz. pour of this monster for thirty minutes. 
It was over-the-top in every way:  i) def one of the most viscous beers I've encountered, and almost completely flat; ii) too "rich" -- too sweet, too much musty oak tannin; iii) the fluid is a seriously, unlovely, brown haze. 
None of us could drink more than the four-ounce pour. 
Being so unfamiliar with West Coast brews, I asked for advice from one of the Chuck's guys, said I was looking for IIPA's on the sweeter side, and American Barleywines, specifying that I've lost my taste for straight-up malt-bomb ENGLISH Barleywines. I'm not sure how he got it so wrong in steering me to this one.
Way over-the-top, for me. I'm sure it lives up to its legend. But I sure wish I would've paid just $5 for my 4-oz. pour. I barely could finish it. 898 charactersmartyl1000, Jun 11, 2015

4.97/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This kind of beer is why I love English Barleywines. Intense aromas of vanilla, toffee, burnt brown sugar, last but not least - bourbon. It basically has the smell of anything decadent that I can think of. Taste wise - wow. The sweetness hits you but it's not just sweet, it has that in-depth sweetness that went beyond my expectation. It's basically a decadent dessert mingled with bourbon barrels. Tasted vanilla, brown sugar, maybe molasses, bourbon and others that I just cannot describe. Very full-bodied. Each sip is robust and the aftertaste is left behind tasting like...you guess it: more vanilla and bourbon. Overall this compares to the Bourbon County Barley Wine. Both aren't that different from each other and both are outstanding. Either one - you can't go wrong. 777 charactersBenish, Apr 30, 2015

Look: Dark brown with a faint mocha head.

Taste: Dark stone fruits, molasses, vanilla, oak and some burning alcohol.
Feel: Luscious and chewy with great carbonation. 
Overall: For its age, I'm amazed how well it help up. Nice and mellow but still have some pronounced alcohol in there. Very good beer. 488 charactersrwf08, Apr 01, 2015

Pours a deep mahogany color with a thin fizzy head that dissipated immediately; no lacing.  The nose was so complex, big grain nose, toasted malt, brown sugar and dried dark fruit (plums, raisins), molasses.  The taste seemed to be falling apart for me, maybe a sign of the again and reminded me mostly of overripe fruits, maybe even rotting a bit. with lots of plums, brown bread dough, molasses, treacle.  Lots of boozy bourbon but smooth with almost no alcohol.  I would like to try this beer fresh. 535 charactersmtomlins, Mar 04, 2015

4.2/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/3/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring pretty quickly. Some minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, prune, fig, date, caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, bourbon, oak, light vanilla, light tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, light vanilla, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a small-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged English barelywine style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and fairly smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, but I feel that the base beer is more impressive than this one. 1,600 characterssuperspak, Feb 28, 2015

Pours a deep, dark, mysterious mahogany color with a small and quickly fading tannish head.  
Wow, this is an impressive aroma.  There is a lot of deep maltiness paired with the very notable presence of bourbon, candied molasses, sweet dark fruits, hints of coffee beans, and a bunch of other stuff.  The syrupy sweetness present here makes me feel like a kid in a fine chocolate factory who is so thrilled by the aromatic character of the place that he can't wait to indulge in the goodies.  
The taste doesn't disappoint.  Full maltiness, sweet bourbon presence, bitter alcohol and hop sting all hit the palate.  After the initial shock, I can appreciate the combination of coffee, toffee, vanilla, and bourbon added to sweet caramel and chocolate flavors.  Once again, there is a lot going on here.  All of it is impressive.  
Relatively low carbonation with plenty of boozy bite summarizes the mouthfeel.  This beer has a definite presence in the mouth.  
Overall, this is quite an impressive beer.  I quite honestly cannot remember the last time that I have enjoyed a beer this much.  This is a very complex and killer brew.  You really have to sit down, sip, and savor this one.  With a 14% bill, sipping and relishing should probably be part of the option anyway.  The Pelican is a heck of a brewery, and this is way more than a heck of a brew.  Can't wait to taste my other bottle in a couple of years or so and compare the difference. 1,603 charactersmacpapi, Feb 28, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Many thanks to ron for the bottle. Enjoying the '10 vintage in 201502.
Pours a dark mohagony, ember red color, with a fizzy, small head, leaving back a thin alcohol legged lacing.
Complex aromas of toffeeish malts, syrup, molasses, getting wrapped up by wooden, slightly vanilla, hot Bourbon. Despite the barrel burn, the nose evokes a very sweet character, which gets topped by a sweet coca-cola like impression. Involves a note of slightly bitter coffee and bakers chocolate, inseparably blending into fudge and molasses. Although there is a prevailung sweetness, which I would usually pretty much diskike, the nose convinces by all its finely graduated nuances, and the very well developed, complex Bourbon barrel, easily balancing the toffee sweetness.
Tastes of bready, toffeeish, slightly creamy malts, with a very clean mouthfeel to it, until the Bourbon enters the scene, bringing a wooden, slightly dry alcohol bite with it, as well as a vanilla note, mingling with molasses, nougat and stale, oakie coffee. The boozy Bourbon bite is teeth numbing dominant, while getting toned down by glazed toffee and honey, building up a great balance between wooden booziness and caramelized sweetness. Due to the surprisingly convenient balance, there are many subtle flavors detectable, such as an acrid coffee tang, resulting from the rich Bourbon, paired against toasty, glazed vanilla, getting accompanied by hazelnuts. Has a hot dryness to it during the finish, enveloping the dried fruits, sweet malts, with molasses providing a long lasting aftertaste among the leathery, wooden Bourbon. 1,595 charactersaleigator, Feb 22, 2015

Has a sweeter flavor with a viscous mouthfeel. Barely hoppy unlike many other American Barleywines. Lovely! Had 2015 version with 2 months on it. Feel that additional time in bottle would've benefited it. Even an additional 1-2 months; feel it would've smoothed beer out some. Still good though. 367 charactersKevinpitts, Feb 21, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle shared by Adam last night. '14 vintage.
Pours a slightly murky brown, with a very small head, and no lacing.
Smells like a big old bourbon bomb, tons of bourbon, oak, and alcohol, with typical barleywine. This smells pretty "hot."
It seems like this one might need a little time to mellow out. As it is now, it's a stellar barleywine, but I think with 2 years on it, this could become god tier. Now, there's a good amount of spicy booze and oak, some char, caramel, dark fruit, coconut, and an absolutely insane amount of bourbon flavor here. Bourbon bomb for sure.
This is medium bodied, with a thick and syrupy mouthfeel, with a crisp alcoholic bite at the end of each sip. It's definitely a slow sipper, due to how strong the booze is.
I'd love to try a '12 or '13 of this, or try a '14 in a few years. Now, it's slightly too hot, and needs a bit of time to mellow out. However, even at this stage, its still delicious and clearly well-crafted. 959 charactersGreesyFizeek, Feb 14, 2015
4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A:  Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights around the edges.  A one finger khaki head forms, and recedes to a smaller ring.  Light lace.
S:  Toasted malts, baked bread, chocolate, vanilla and oak aromas. While nothing is particularly surprising, it is all excellent.  
T:  Again, toasted malts and baked bread.  Caramel/toffee flavors, and dark chocolate.  Vanilla and oak flavors that are incredibly balanced with everything else.  Love it.
M/D:  A big full body that is not overly viscous.  Though perfectly weighty.  Silky smooth and velvety with that perfect oak tannin character.  Incredibly easy to drink.  Just a bit of heat from the alcohol.  Mix that with the malt, and this is so warming, welcoming, and enjoyable to drink.
An incredible balance of malts and oak barrels.  I could curl up with this on a cold night and be happy all night.  I have always loved this, and just a treat to drink again. 910 characterschamp103, Feb 14, 2015

A: Pours an extremely dark brown in color with just a thin line of khaki head that reduces quickly and leaves the tiniest collar I've seen. Viscosity appears super thin for the ABV, by appearance alone I wouldn't put this over 10%. 
S: Wafting aroma of bourbon, toffee, dark fruits, vanilla, caramel, oak. As it warms, it becomes a sweet bourbon bomb. 
T: Mimics the aroma. The bourbon stays on the after taste, making each sip very sweet up front.
M: Carb level is on the lower end, and is a perfect fit for this beer. It lingers as semi-dry semi-rich, which given the large flavor profile is very enjoyable. 
O: I appreciate this beer for it's bold qualities throughout. I am not a barleywine guy, but I love bourbon. This delivers the best of the beer and bourbon world, making a barleywine that I find highly drinkable. 947 charactersroger617, Jan 17, 2015

S - Smells of bourbon and sweet malt with a hint of hops and soy.
T - Fairly bitter at the fore with medium malt and bourbon in the middle and a bite at the end.
M - Very viscous with a small amount of carbonation.  Quite mouth coating.
O - A good barley wine but one that is heavy on the hops.  I would give it a higher score were it more balanced. 542 characterskdahnke123, Dec 30, 2014

Pours an opaque, chestnut brown with burgandy highlights and a little less than one finger ecrue head. The bubbles quickly shrink to a thin collar, leaving only a few occasional dots of lace. 
Sweet, inviting nose. Toffee, bourbon, caramel, vanilla and port. 
Taste is spot on. Bourbon, toffee, toast, brandy soaked raisins, caramel, cereal, vanilla, dark fruit, oak, leather, earth, faint char and of coarse a healthy dollop of booze. So rich and flavorful that it goes down with an ease that belies its mid teen abv. 
Near-syrupy, full feel with mild carbonation. Finishes sweet with booze doused dark fruit, toffee and caramel. 
Mother Of All Storms is a top tier barrel aged English barleywine. This one is well worth a hunt/chase. Very glad that I procurred multiples. 881 charactersThickNStout, Dec 19, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +2.9%More, perhaps, than any other beer I've yet tried, this one manages to walk the fine line between being utterly undrinkable (on account, mostly, of its intense sweetness) and being utterly delicious (on account of its rich, malty flavors).  A memorable offering, but if you have it in a bottle, plan on sharing that bottle one or two ways if you can. 350 charactersNietzsches_Horse, Dec 07, 2014

Pours viscous and thick, dark brown and almost black initially. The head is a fizzy dark-khaki that dissipates almost immediately, leaving only a pitch-black liquid. With no lace or head, it appears to be a flat coca-cola almost. 4.25
I think of port with my first whiff. Raisins and booze certainly. Dark chocolate and vanilla mingle. Oak and bourbon are eventually more obvious but they don't dominate the aroma. 4.25
The flavor is pretty true to the nose. Raisin-heavy, suggestive of port or rum raisin pudding (just like HF Aaron I had yesterday), and thick with caramel flavor. Notes of oak and vanilla persist throughout. The finish reminds me of dark fruit and chocolate. 4.25
The mouthfeel is thick and very dessert wine-like. The carbonation is moderate and tickles the mouth a bit before a bit of a boozy feel. Really though, the booze is masterfully buried with this brew. It's exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. 4.75
I think the shining aspect of this beer is how easy it drinks. Beguilingly smooth. I have to say, I think my local Marble barleywine gives this a run for it's money. Either way, I look forward to aging a couple for future consumption. 1,220 charactersONovoMexicano, Dec 01, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%2014 vintage, poured from 22 oz bottle into snifter.
Dark reddish-black, head quickly faded to a ring.  Smells of molasses, vanilla, oak, and a little boozy.  Tastes how I anticipated from the smell, but better.  Same flavors as in the aroma, with some dark dried fruits in there as well.  Sweet, but not overly sweet.  Exceptionally smooth, hides its alcohol well (though clearly a sipper).  Lived up to the hype and then some. 429 charactersjds16, Nov 29, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%2012 vintage. "Bottled 121712." Been aging in my cellar for the past year and a half. Have another there I'm saving for maybe in a year or two.
Wow. That's a lot of beer. Huge malty sweet flavor bomb. Notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Chocolate, caramel , molasses , brown sugar , vanilla ice cream. Lots of rich leathery sweet flavor profiles and some reduced balsamic. Flavor finishes long and tangy with bourbon and toasted oak along with a rich dark earthy muddiness. Almost compost flavored, but more like black nutrient rich soil.
Finish is syrupy and sweet and coats the mouth. A tingly carbonic/graphite crispness tries to cover the syrupy finish, but it can't hold up to it.
Smell is big sweet and syrupy again. Bonilla and brown sugar again. Viscosity is out of this world. Ridiculously thick.
Overall, this is an amazing beer. Though, it looses points in my mind for the texture. It's too viscous for me, though I understand developing this sort of flavor profile has its drawbacks. I can't imagine how much grain went into making this! 1,047 charactersconstantine_272, Oct 09, 2014

Complex and deep flavors of toffee, roast, wet wood, caramel, nutty, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits (figs and raisins).  Full bodied and moderate carbonation.

It is full of toasted coconut and quite a bit of roastiness for a BW, and breaks to a big salted toffee back end.  Smell was vanilla, coconut, and general sweetness.

The serving was the darkest brown you could imagine, it was impenetrable. Aside from the very few bubbles spotted when this beer was served, there was nothing there besides the darkest brown liquid. 
The smell was of heavy malt syrup, soy sauce, and some vanilla. Super sweet smelling soy sauce :)
The taste = malt syrup, vanilla, soy sauce, faded rich dark fruit, and sweet bread.
The mouthfeel for The Mother of All Storms was decadent. How? It was smooth, no carb, syrupy, and rich feeling.
Overall, this is a decidedly, smooth, rich, balanced, well-crafted, English Barley-wine that is perched atop the barley-wine food chain. It is easy drinking and dangerous. I have not had a comparable barley-wine. 794 charactersmabermud, Aug 10, 2014

Appearance: Pours a clear auburn color, with 1/2" of light khaki colored head. pretty nice retention time, and ultimately reduced down to a thin ring around the edges of the glass. minimal lacing.
Smell: Rich, sticky toffee, vanilla, hints of wood, medium amount of oxidation, which does not retract too much, and is reasonable considering this is 4 years old. 
Taste: Toffee, caramel, sherry, wood, vanilla, and hints of oxidation, although not as prevalent as the nose. Sweet, but not too much so especially for this style.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation, sticky with residual sugars. Again, good. Overall, this probably would have been better a year ago, but still has retained much of its quality. A bit oxidized, but does not affect the beer too much overall. I have a 2011 that I will open very soon and hope it has faded a bit less than this. 894 characterszhanson88, Jul 13, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Here it is. We cut the foil and pop the top on a bomber of their 2012 stock, pouring into our oversized tasting snifters. It pours thick and syrupy, settling the color of the brown bottle it came in. A brief finger’s height of a head is produced, but this fades quickly into the ether. No real haze or sediment is appreciated. The aroma screams toffee and bourbon at the top of its lungs. Otherwise, the nose is titillated by notes of raw honey, dark and juicy plum and black cherry flesh, huge buttery diacetyls, thick curtains of slick oakiness, deeply roasted chocolate, caramel, and dank amber grain, vanilla bean, malted milk balls, spicy ethanol burn, and a smoldering cedar character. The flavor…oh, the flavor!! It is incredibly sweet, but absolutely perfectly balanced. Malts come in the form of heavy chocolate, caramel, and amber grain, and roasty barley, with intrinsic sweetness of the bourbon and oak, pound cake, dense plastic phenols, ceramic, warming butters and toffees, slick and metallic coolness of vanilla bean, chalks, vinous white grape skins, and the baked, flakey crispiness of fresh croissants. The body is thick and chewy, with lighter carbonation to match. Slurp and sip are big, giving the old mustache, despite lower creamage or frothage. The mouth is coated a foot deep, dripping into only mild astringency after a few minutes. The abv is appropriate, and drinkability remains at a snail’s pace the entire night.
Overall, this is the mother of all mothers of beer, and the anticipation and excitement levels were obviously through the roof. Contrasting against some of these whales that may taste the same as its top-tiered brethren stylistically, this is a sure standout for barleywines. As soon as you open the bottle, the aromas hit the room from corner to corner, enticing you with every breath. The flavoring is extremely pure and full, with absolutely nothing offensive about it. There is almost no aftertaste, due in part to the thick coating of sugar left around the mouth, but more so due to the fact that the blend is so utterly perfected. If you’ve had Westy 12 you’ll know what we mean when we say that this should be the basic prototype for the style. There are no bells or whistles you’re not expecting, but rather you are presented with something so pure and unabashed. We keep using the word “pure”, but there really isn’t any other way to put it. This is one of the most palpably slow drinkers in recent memory. You don’t want to guzzle or pound because the flavoring is so amazing, but rather you want to finesse this one, and perhaps take it out for a nice seafood dinner, by candlelight, followed by a romantic ride in a horse-drawn carriage. Oh, yes. You want this experience to last forever. 2,766 charactersTheBrewo, Jun 28, 2014

A monstrous, decadent beast of a beer. Pours a rich carmel cola shade of brown; some real boozy legs, too. Kind of an intimidating-looking brew. Aromas of butterscotch, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar. Lots of wood from the barrels. Based on appearance and aroma, double-checking your glass to make sure you're not drinking straight bourbon would be entirely understandable. Taste is wonderful: mellow vanilla marshmallow, sweet dark fruit, butterscotch, and brown sugar.
Mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, but heavy and domineering; would be near impossible to crush this one in a solo op (however I'm tempted to try it if I can land another bottle). To repeat: a monstrous, decadent beast…and one of the finest barleywines I've had. 805 charactersblankenhoney, May 31, 2014

Initially a reddish deep brown head is formed and fades away, a thin ring remains around the class. Not surprising given the alcohol content. Aroma is jammy, with raisins. Alcohol is rather present even after two years. Some barrel presence remains. Port like. Flavor is heavy on the booze, port and sherry like flavors waft in and become heavy and prominant. Burnt caramel, raisins, and toffee mingle with the sherry and port flavors. Complex flavor, really it is, way beyond a barrel bomb. Slick, oily mouthfeel. Thick. Not cloying however. The alcohol creates a sharp and clearly burn like quality. There is no doubt this is an exceptional ale. Downsides, the alcohol keeps coming back and reminding me it is there, the burnt caramel flavor is rather strong and can be off putting, the palate is left muddy. 923 characterspmlondrigan, Apr 20, 2014

22oz bottle poured at 41 F into a large chalice. Bottled on date is 12.03.13.
Pours dark brown, but translucent, with little or no head, not much carbonation. Doesn't look cloudy, just dark. Smell is mostly alcohol for me (although my wife can't smell it). I get dark fruit, a little smoke. Yeast. Overripe fruit.
Taste is hella sweet. Some alcohol, masked well by the incredible sweetness. Some smokey flavor. Woody. Something is really nice about this, but I can't nail it down with a descriptor. Maybe some slight vanilla.
Mouthfeel is silky and smooth. Overall, I like this beer, but I still can't describe why.

Incredibly rich, dark and sticky barleywine.  Dark chocolate macaroon with an undercurrent of rich plum and other dark fruit. Macaroon taste comes from the caramelized oak and bourbon - vanilla cream, coconut and nuttiness.  Very nice bourbon on this as well.  
Worlds better than the 2013 and a top barleywine no doubt.
2013 vintage, had at a half a year about.  Rated 4.23
Very dark barleywine - opaque black in the glass. When held up to a light it's surprisingly clear with a dark ruby/red wine color. The burnt khaki head fades immediately. 
Lots of bourbon oak, red wine, musty, booze, some caramel and overpowered dark fruits. Aroma seems restrained, this is the first time having it so that is an odd comment to make - pretty hot and disjoined but still very good.
Huge flavor - booze, bourbon soaked oak, some slight vanilla and dark fruits in the back ground. Prominent red wine note. Dry for the style, which is interesting - not very sweet. Feels great - full bodied, very soft carbonation - carries the flavors well. 
Very good beer, excited to see what age can do. Can imagine it improving - mellowing out and blending together. Time will tell. 1,202 characterstimc100, Mar 22, 2014

Big thanks to ScottO for sending me a 2012 to enjoy myself. 
From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2012
Aged in bourbon barrels 
APPEARANCE: Same as the 2011. This one pours a one finger, very loose and fizzy, tan colored head that fizzes away immediately. Only a slight ring is left after the quick disappearing act. A transparent rosewood red/brown in color with lower levels of carbonation evident. Quite dark for the style. A faint ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass. Body is fine, but the fizzy head was pretty unattractive. 
SMELL: Toffee, raisins, grapes, brown sugar with some nice bourbon, oak, touches of vanilla and caramel on the nose. Some alcohol and coconut from the bourbon barrels. Pretty complex and inviting, and much better balanced than the 2011. 
TASTE: Really nice. The fourteen percent ABV is noticeable, but it doesn't get in the way. Toffee, dark fruits, like raisins, dates and grapes, and some brown sugar up front before oak and bourbon at the swallow. More dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla and coconut linger linger with a bit of caramel sweetness as well. Bold and interesting flavor with enough boozy alcohol underneath. Much better crafted than the 2011 version, which was just an alcohol bomb. 
PALATE: Medium body with medium levels of carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, a prickly perhaps, goes down okay with a burn at the swallow and finishes mouth-coating. A burn and some heat linger, but not outlandish. Could be a bit creamier and less prickly as well. 
OVERALL: This was infinitely better than the 2011 I had a while back. Much less alcohol and burn, which allows the interesting flavor profile to come though. Perhaps some more time in the cellar will allow it to mellow out a bit more and take some of the heat out of the equation. That and a less prickly feel would make this one a real winner. Thanks again ScottO. Was a pleasure. 2,167 charactersJeffo, Mar 15, 2014

Nose immediately fills the air. Strong caramel, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, and toasty malts. This is absolutely heaven to the nose. Age has done wonders for this one. Taste follows the nose - lots of toffee and caramel. Less vanilla, but the bourbon is definitely there. The flavors blend together to create a perfectly smooth and well balanced beer. This is tremendous, and I would say the top of this style. I would put this higher than Sucaba, and I have had both quite a few times. Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy - amazing. 638 charactersBeersnake1, Mar 01, 2014

Appearance: Beautiful fizzy pour. Two fingers of solid but ephemeral head. Still and mysterious like a swamp. Enticing dark-auburn color, like an old church pew hidden in the attic of grandma's house.
Smell: Toffee, caramel, brown butter. Nuttiness abounds. Toasted grains, quinoa. Raisin. Old wine, most likely port. As it warms up, booze and wood come out to play. Milk chocolate confection (Milka).
Taste: Follows nose, intensified. More of that toffee, brown sugar, sweetness galore but not overwhelming. Candied bacon, bourbon gastrique. Syrup, fruit cake. Oak, vanilla, black pepper. Chestnut mousse and roasted parsnip. Reminds me of drinking Aventinus Eisbock or Samichlaus, but more refined. The Kentucky barrel is not immediately present but well blended with the overall brew. 
Moutfeel: Low carbonation, medium body and full taste. Prickly-spicy feel. Sweetness in check. 
Overall: I didn't like it as much as the first time (that 4.75 rating) but this is still a great beer. I enjoyed it more than Sucaba... drinks rather well for such a huge beer. Slighty one-dimensional perhaps, and a tad too filling, but it makes for a lovely sipper. Definitely would buy and enjoy again. 1,309 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Feb 28, 2014

Dark and silky brown this poured a thick lace of brown foam.
The aroma is thick with bourbon, oak, barley and wine like alcohols.
The flavor is far more complex as I taste whipped cream, fudge brownie, brown sugar, starchy grains, bourbonesque alcohol and subtle barrel wood.
Very smooth feel, but the bourbon does give off a warmth.
This is so interesting, so complex and quite a delight. 399 charactersKYGunner, Feb 23, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown/ruby shade with ring of tan foam. Aroma is heavy on dark, sticky fruits, adding wisps of chocolate, smoke and a lighter-than-expected bourbon presence. Taste is brimming with sticky toffee and barrel influence. Hint of anise spiciness in the finish. Thick mouthfeel with no real trace of heat. I think I’ve had more complex barleywines, but few as delicious and easy to drink. A superb example. 407 charactersjbaker67, Feb 08, 2014

Poured into an etched tulip glass. Opaque chestnut brown with a thin mocha head. Dissipates fairly quick but comes back with a swirl. It's over a year old though, I'll cut it some slack.
Rich, full aromas just spillin out the glass. Toffee, bread pudding, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, fig spread. A little bourbony booze. 
Taste follows suit, but with toffee and dates at the front. Caramel, tawny port like notes, sorghum molasses. Ends with some bourbon. Vanilla and dates linger in the finish. A little bit more oxidation than I would have liked. Fairly sweet but not cloying. I caught a little bit of alcohol here and there but generally doesn't taste like 14%.
Medium bodied, smooth, syrupy but not thick.
Rich and complex, drinkable for it's ABV. They don't overdo it with the barrel aging either. I can see why this beer is so renowned. If you have a 2012 around drink it now, mine was already oxidizing and I think a bit past its prime. 997 charactersbusternuggz, Jan 19, 2014

A - Pours a really deep, murky brown with a thin, one finger light khaki head that fades quickly. Not really much retention or lacing to this one.
S - Sweet caramel, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla and and bready malts. It's rich, malty and most of all really quite sweet to me.
T - Overly sweet dark fruits and bready malts at first that develop into good bourbon barrel aged characteristics of vanilla, brown sugar and light oak. Again, it's overly sweet for my tastes here.
M - Medium bodied and carbonation. It has a cloying sweetness to me.
O - I'm not sure with the "whale" factor plays a role in the high rating here. But, the beer is overly sweet in nature, which is a huge turnoff for me. 747 characterscvm4, Jan 19, 2014

Thanks to Joe for breaking this out!
A huge barleywine. Wonderful chestnut hues with off white streaks of lace. Nose is predominantly toffee and caramel with lesser notes of raisins, vanilla, and bourbon. Many layers of complexity here. Mainly sweet but finishes with a light touch of earthy hops to keep the sweetness in check. Rich, smooth, and delicious.

Thanks to an awesome BA who broke this out at DLD. Review from notes on 4/24/10
A - Poured a rich chocolate brown with a large tan head that lasted the entire experience. Touches of lace here and there. Deep ruby red in the light. 4.5
S - Wonderfully malty with lots of caramel and toffee tones mixing with a delicate vanilla and wood. Hint of figs and black currants, but very subtle. I feel enlightened after wafting this goodness. 4.5
T - This is amazing. Complex dark fruits blended perfectly with toffee, caramel, and the slightest hint of robustness. Plums and figs bring the finish with the every so slight earthiness of hops. Yes, this is a delicate beer but that's exactly why it's so good. 4.5
M - There can be no flaw here. Rich and smooth to the point of velvetiness, coats the palate ever so slightly, and finishes with a bit of warmth in the throat. Carbonation is held in check the entire time. 5.0
D - Ok, I'm putting this on my whale hunt. Damn this is good. 5.0 1,401 charactersDmanGTR, Jan 19, 2014

Bottle Date: 12/5/13
A: Pours a ruddy, almost opaque brown color. Small tan head quickly fades to nothing.
S: Earthy caramel and dark fruit leap out of the glass. A fresh bourbon aroma quickly follows. Molasses, figs, vanilla. A touch of biscuit.
T: Opens with sweet dark fruit. Raisins are very prominent throughout. Burnt caramel and vanilla lead to a decent dose of bourbon flavor. Oak is also present. Alcohol adds a bit of heat near the finish.
M: Thinner than most beers of this strength, which makes it surprising drinkable. Moderate but effervescent carbonation.
O: A wonderful beer. Grabbed a case and had to try one fresh. I think this will definitely improve with a little age. Delicious now, but with the alcohol heat rounded out and the flavors more integrated it would be truly world class.
Also, my girlfriend tried a sip and immediately told me it smells like dog food. Now when I smell it, I pick that up, too. Damn you Deana! 991 charactersWankelEngine, Jan 11, 2014

Reviewed live. Expectations are extremely high given Duff27's recommendation and its current 99 rating. No ABV is listed on the bottle. 2012 vintage (Bottled 11/05/12. Reviewed as a barrel-aged barleywine because it's identified as such on the label. 
Served cold – straight from the fridge - and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
A: No bubble show forms as it’s poured. 
Pours a half finger wide head of rich shiny khaki colour. Nice thickness and creaminess. Head retention is poor - about 15 seconds. No lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. 
Body colour is a rich dark amber. Understated and classy. No floating yeast particles are visible. 
Overall, it’s an appealing appearance for the style. I’m really looking forward to trying it. 
Sm: Bourbon character is plentiful, but there's no distinct vanilla/oak character. Nice amber malts, bready/breadcrust-evoking malts, and rich malty character. Not too sweet nor too bitter.
No hop character or yeast character is detectable. 
Unfortunately, the bourbon overwhelms the base beer. 
A pleasant aroma of moderate to high strength. 
T: Great bourbon-evocative notes - plenty of vanilla and oak, but not real authentic vanilla bean or toasty oak barrel. Amber malts. Bready malts. Some bread crust. Caramel. Maybe some sherry wine. A hint of marshmallow. A hint of graham cracker. 
Has lots of subtlety. Nice complexity, nuance, and intricacy. 
Good depth, intensity, and duration of flavour. 
It's real well balanced. Has a nice pleasant boozy warmth that I really dig. I don't get any spice. 
No yeast character or hop character is detectable. 
Mf: Smooth and wet. Well-carbonated. Good body, thickness, and presence on the palate. Has a decent softness to it. 
Not oily, gushed, hot, astringent, harsh, or rough. 
Dr: Pretty drinkable for the barrel aging and ABV, but still a sipper. Rich and decadent. I really like it. I'd definitely get it again. Really good stuff. I'll have to seek out more Pelican brews. Many thanks to Duff27 for the bottle. Age I think has done it well. Dead-on for a barleywine. The barrel notes complement the base beer nicely; there's some development of flavour there.

A reddish brown that I can just barely see through when I hold it to the light, fast falling three fingers of noisy tan foam leaves no lace but that's to be expected at this strength, some wide legs and a few streams of tiny bubbles going up the side make it look like a slow boiling pot of oil 
S lots of brown sugar, some anise, wood, bourbon, vanilla, toffee and caramel, some booze and I get some sawdust of all things, some sugar coated raisins burnt marshmallow, and spiced rum 
T more boozy bourbon, lots of toffee, some fruity notes, a little coco, leather, plenty of booze and wood, everything I smells still there but with some welcome additions 
M not as thick as expected but quite syrupy and sticky, lots of heat and a little tannin, has enough bubbles to give it some life but it stops short of creamy
O booze is noticeable throughout but that's my only complaint, everything else is working well for this one but I wouldn't put it as high as it is on the top 250 list 
I'd love to revisit this one a few years down the road, shes a big ass boozy sipper and If I had a second bottle I'd sit on it for ages. Its a great beer don't me wrong I just don't think its built to be drank fresh, and by fresh I mean a little over a year old. 1,341 characterswordemupg, Dec 18, 2013

Brooding blood-mahogany with an airy saffron head that falls summarily to zip.
Nicely fortified notes of rum 'n' raisin, prunes, caramel, liquorice, sour cherry, cola and mild plastic.
Barrel rises to the fore in the flavours, which are impressively rich. Sticky date pudding, muscatels, toffee apple, muscovado sugar. 
Full and syrupy, but in keeping with the ABV. Similarly there's decent booze heat but it's welcome.
Immense barleywine that is easier to drink than the 2011 Stormwatchers that preceded it on the evening, but also lacks a bit of complexity. Would be interested to see whether it opens up with 5+ years of age. 693 charactersspicelab, Nov 27, 2013

This was a serious white whale for me. I love the Pelican brews, but never tracked this down. I was surprised to find it a nice little bottleshop, a bit south of the brewery in the summer.
A: Dark chestnut brown, pours with a thin tan head, no retention, no lace/leg. Not surprising for a brew of this weight.
S: Pleasant alcohol aroma (like a sherry), raisins, maraschino cherry, treacle, field berry, light spicing reminiscent of a Christmas cake.
T: Piny resin is up front; raisin, field berry and maraschino cherry through the middle (along with some light rum & spiced Christmas cake); roasted nut and dark toffee in the finish.
M: Full body is a bit syrupy with a drying alcohol finish.
O: Some may consider the malt, hop & alcohol balance a 'perfect storm'... and it is indeed impressive for a brew of this strength. Personally, I could do with a bit less alcohol and residual sweetness, and some more American hops! Though perhaps I was just expecting a more hop-forward brew like most of their lineup. This is seriously good (and improves as it warms). 1,081 charactersDerek, Nov 17, 2013

The beer pours a dark burgundy color, touches of garnet red when struck by the light with just the slightest touch of head that vanishes immediately yielding no lace but a faint film around the rim of the glass. The aroma is wonderful, lots of rich dark grain, the barrel is perfectly integrated, lots of toffee, bourbon and oak with some brown sugar, molasses, caramel, pitted fruit and a bit of fig with just a light roasty char at the back end. The flavors follow nicely, bourbon and toffee jump out, soft chewy oak and vanilla can be found behind it, brown sugar, fig, molasses and caramel finish it up nicely and sweetly to counter the more earthy and roasty start. The body is nice, lively carbonation, rich and smooth, coats the mouth exceedingly well with a soft and creamy finish that warms ever so slightly.
Verdict: An incredible Barrel Aged Barleywine from Pelican Pub and certainly one of my all time favorite barrel aged beers. A masterclass in complexity and balance, not too sweet, not too roasty, not too boozy, everything in harmony. This beer is aging superbly well and is worthy of any and all accolades. 1,246 characterskevanb, Nov 10, 2013

Note: 2012 bottle
Consumed 11/8/13
Appearance: Dark, dark brown - some dark, dark copper and hints of dark red around the edges - impressive amount of clarity considering the color - pours with a moderate size, light tan head, fades to a few wisps of a cap, leaves a little lacing
Smell: Holy mother of storms, this is intense - big, big chocolate with a nice range of malts - tons of roasty, dark malts, caramel, molasses, toffee, and biscuits sprinkled with powdered sugar - some big, intriguing bourbon notes, wood, and vanilla - some dark fruits, and some alcohol
Taste: Big, boozy, beastly, and awesome - big, burly malts - caramel, cooked sugar, molasses, and toffee - to contrast the sweet notes, some roasty and burnt malts - so much depth - some bitterness - bourbon mixes quite well, rounds out the flavor - some wood and vanilla - hints of dark fruits - rich, decadent, with some booze
Mouthfeel: Big, full body, very smooth, low carbonation
Overall: This will rock you like a hurricane
This beer has some hype. And it lives up to it. This is a great, great English Barleywine. This is only a year old, and I imagine more aging will only make it more awesome. This is great. 1,233 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 09, 2013
4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to beachstrength49 for the bottle. 
Appearance: Deep reddish purplish brown. Slight haze. Head is light tan with a loose structure and minimal retention. Drops to a tiny collar. No lacing and no cap. Barrel influence is obvious. 
Smell: Raisins, plums, figs, coconut, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and more. Booze with some seriously cooked and caramelized malt sugars. Sweet with raw sugar. The base bourbon is a nice compliment to the burly malt body. Some toasted nuts with some cocoa and dark cherry. Mega fruity. Slight peppery note from the alcohol. Warming pushes some of the bourbon down and IPS the coconut and dark fruit. 
Taste: Syrupy booze. A ton of dark fruit. Plums, raisins, figs, dark cherry. A solid punch of vanilla, toffee, and caramel. Layers of coconut with a sweeter almost macaroon thrown in there. A touch of toasted malt with some roasted elements as well. Bourbon adds a nice layer of own and boozy sweetness. Cooked and caramelized for ages. Some raw sugar and a ton of toffee. Deeply complex with some alcohol on the back. Boozy, but not 14% by any means. Warming smooths everything out and let's the dark fruit push up. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy medium pushing full body. Minimal carbonation. Lingering sticky sweetness. 
Overall: That's a wicked big storm!
This is one hell of a bourbon barrel barleywine. Layers of malt sweetness completely enhanced by the bourbon barrel. A ton of complexity. Well worth the fight to track down. 1,471 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Nov 09, 2013

With much appreciation to PDXHops for giving me a bottle
Split with MbpBugeye
A) Medium brown pour. In the glass the beer has a gorgeous deep ruby hue (especially when held to the light). The beer fostered about 1/4th inch head but it dissipated quickly leaving only a ring of retention and a few lily pads. No lace.
S) The aroma is dense with notes of raisins, molasses, prune, caramel, bread, butter toffee and tobacco. Overtones of wood with a sturdy booze note across the board. The barrel characteristics emerge as it warms taking a more prominent roll. There is faint vanilla as well.
T) The taste is comparably deep. Deep, and rather sugary (which I reckon is appropriate in this case). Hints of chocolate, molasses and caramel. On the back end, the sugars are a bit toasty too. Dark fruit notes. The barrel has blended in very well - the oak actually pulls a higher card than the whiskey. Vanilla creeps in as it warms.
M) Full, slick body with some granular undercurrents. Moderately low carbonation that mellows a bit, but always maintains a bite. Some heat on the finish.
O) This is the kind of beer you want to drink and not write about. I screwed that up big time. 1,237 charactersRyan011235, Sep 26, 2013

A - Very dark ruby red (like a dark merlot), clear. Light tan head, dissipates quickly, no lacing.
S - Big toffee, vanilla, coconut, a little booze (in a good sense), dark fruits, chocolate. A lot going on and very fragrant.
T - Toffee, piloncillo, vanilla, coconut, dark chocolate, dried cherries, blueberries, figs, dates. Extremely flavorful. Alcohol is there but blends nicely with the flavors. Is sweet, but finishes fairly dry.
M - A little watery (like Sucaba), medium w/ a sticky undercurrent. Carbonation is medium low.
O - Great beer! The lack of mouthfeel is more than made up with the smell and taste. Very similar to Sucaba, but more intense in taste and more dark chocolate flavor, which I like. 836 charactersjeff1973, Sep 15, 2013

Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights when held to light and a smallish off white head that dissipates quickly to a ring on top. Huge brown sugary caramel malty aroma with lots of deep dark fruits and bits of vanilla. coconut and wood. Sweet sugary malt flavor with a solid hit of alcohol. Dark fruits caramel prunes wood and vanilla are all there in the flavor. Hints of bourbon oak and oak tannin round out the flavor. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I've had this before and remember enjoying it a bit more. Its a nice barleywine, but I feel the alcohol is a bit too present and may need a bit of time to mellow out. 764 charactersjohnnnniee, Sep 02, 2013

A - Dark Brown- almost a deep purple, khaki colored head which dissipates rather quickly leaving a small amount around the rim
S - Complex fruits: Cherry, fig, coconut, toffe, carmel, bourbon
T - Toffee, carmel, chocolate, coconut, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, beautiful bourbon
M - Thick, full body, very good carbonation, descent froth
O - Outstanding. Love the dark fruits with coconut. Complex flavors keep you guessing. Levels on levels on levels. Does warm the tummy quite a bit. But at 14 ABV - concealed very well. Unlike 'King Henry' this is NOT a extremely overly thick syrup. Thickness is excellent. I do think it could be more frothy. Thus far: #1 Sucaba. #2.

Limited tan/khaki colored bubbles that don't even make a thin head across the surface. Deep burgundy colored body with yellowish/tan outlines in the glass. Good coating of the glass. Smell is inviting with some bourbon on the nose and dark fruitiness. The taste is deep. Ripe/overripe fruits creating a candy/brown sugar sweetness that enhances the oak and minor vanilla. Very, very smooth with a slick mouthfeel that is full bodied without too much heat. Great beer. Comparable to the best BA barleywines I've tasted. The key is having the body to stand up to the flavor and round out the drinking experience and this beer delivers that. 663 charactersPHBoiler, Jul 01, 2013

A gorgeous body color, comes out of the bottle glistening dark walnut brown and shiny, and hits with a dark walnut body with some very obvious red hues. There is a faint remaining head but falls quickly to a small tan collar. Looks like a real deep brandy and I love this red hue to it.
Bouque jumps with berry fruit. Brown spices, almost clove like. Lots of charcoal and tight smelling oak, with a little bit of sticky caramel to match with it as well. VEry impressive.
First sip on the palate is incredibly sharp. THe berry like nose continues with a strong fruit and sharp bitter with an incredible dryness. It feels and tastes almost like a sherry. Caramel starts to really wash over the tongue on multiple sips with a nice dry coating. Large amounts of boozy warmth in the stomach, but not in the palate luckily. Oily but with a good sense of viscosity and not horribly thick.
A great barrel aged barleywine, real enjoyable. 1,050 characterssmakawhat, Jun 23, 2013

Packaging: 22 oz. brown bottle, pry-cap with foil
Glassware: Snifter
Purchased: Received in a trade
A: Dark brown beer that is nearly opaque, capped by a small head of tan that fades quickly leaving little lace.
S: Aromas are rich, powerful and complex, with elements of toffee, molasses, wood/oak, dark fruit sweetness, bourbon alcohol and some tobacco. Reminds me of the smell of boiling wort on brewing day.
T: Flavors are big and bold, with sweet caramels and molasses up front in this malt bomb. Bitterness is low but the warming of alcohol is pretty pronounced. I also taste vanilla and dark fruits like raisin. 
M: The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, like a motor oil, with a moderate amount of carbonation. The finish has dark fruits like figs, plus molasses, for a sweet and malty aftertaste. 
O: This is a real "wow" beer; a strong and potent sipper. If you're not turned off by sweet and malty brews I'd recommend you seek this one out!

4.68/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- Very light head (about a finger and a half to a finger in a 12 oz. Glass) and basically no head retention. This would be worrisome in other styles but acceptable in this one. Tan/light mocha but could be wrong, it went away so quickly. The body is a deep chestnut brown that shows ruby notes when held to the light. 
Nose- There was a greenish note that I noticed early one (especially from the bottle itself). A greenish note (not of fruit but of trees, maybe plants) that worked with a certain sourness (think coffee). Toffee, vanilla, butter, and caramel alongside heavy roasted notes of malt and bread. Very sweet- brown sugar and molasses. But the coconut. The coconut on the nose in the glass is dominating. It's intoxicating. It mixes with burnt toffee and is quite a compelling aroma.
Taste- Burnt toffee, coconut, and caramel come out first. There is some bitterness lingering around the edges that need to be sussed out. Some heat but with such a high alcohol content, it is very welcome. This is ever so complex- figs, raisins, light hints of chocolate, oak, and even tobacco at the end. Vanilla as well. While this may be based upon Stormwatcher's, this is much better. Notes of leather as well. This is amazing in its complexity and integration. It is still very boozy. It makes me interested in trying the 2011 that is at bottles. Right now, it is straddling the line between a 4.5 and a 4.75 but I think it is closer to a 4.75. It's only real failure is in appearance. Brown sugar and molasses. Bourbon notes as well. This is what a barleywine should be. 
Mouthfeel- This is heavy bodied and it should be. The carbonation is minimal and this is no problem. Syrupy but smooth. 
Drinkability- Extremely dangerous. It will destroy your pocketbook and liver. You have been warned. Buy immediately upon sight. 
Overall- A/A+. A thoroughly enjoyable beer. It was definitely worth 25 bucks. I would purchase again. Will be ticked as a 4.75 but slightly lower than that. 1,994 charactersartoolemomo, Jun 15, 2013

Pours a deep brown, burgundy color that captures 99% of the light that enters the glass. About a half inch of khaki-colored head develops following a moderately aggressive pour. Retention is minimal - unsurprising for a 14% brew - but there is a good amount of lacing to remind you of its existence. 
The aroma is of bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, caramel, a bit of chocolate, a hint of ubiquitous "dark fruit" (e.g. date, raisin, maybe some plum), and some other muddled, earthen, malted barley. Still, not a single scent dominates the nose, rather a balanced bouquet of delicate aromas greets the eager patron. 
It tastes of caramel, chocolate, vanilla, and toffee up front, with oak, bourbon, and a some nuttiness following suit. A vague hint of once citrusy hops fades into some richer date, raisin, and plum flavors. The slightest hint of ethanol is detectable if one actively searches for it. 
The mouthfeel is tremendous, bringing enough carbonation to cut through the heavily-bodied beer and create a lively sensation on the tongue. Though it readily coats the mouth, the finish is clean, neither overly dry nor residually sticky. The consistency is thick enough to slow the drinking rate to a comfortable evening sip, but thin enough to keep those sips spaced only briefly apart. 
So this is it, my personal white whale finally slain. After years of navigating the high seas of the craft beer world, the great beast lies dormant in my belly. It possesses everything I hoped it would: balanced flavors, ample bourbon, readily noticeable vanilla, and all that English Barleywine goodness that I crave. Ultimately, this is one of the best I've had, and while the ethanol is still slightly pronounced in this most recent batch, I'm hopeful that it would have mellowed with a bit more time. 1,969 characterseclipse54, May 26, 2013

Pours brown with a little bit of red letting in some light. Bright beige creamy head.
Lots of toffee and vanilla in the nose. Brown sugar, perhaps a bit of fig and bourbon.
Big maltiness in the flavor. Brown sugar and toffee mixed with a lot of vanilla. Bourbon has died down a lot. Still present and heats up at the end, but this is a malt bomb.
Full bodied and sticky. Low, but present carbonation. Pretty spot on for the style.
Probably waited a bit too long on this one. Still pretty good, but I'd prefer more heat and less sweetness. Will be drinking any future ones closer to fresh. 606 charactersjmarsh123, May 23, 2013

Poured a deep brown with mahogany edges, 1 finger of cinnamon colored head lingered for a quick minute and slowly succumbed to the weight of the beer.
Nice aromas of toffee, caramel, oak, bourbon and vanilla. Smells awesome.
Toffee dominates my palate right off the bat with an amazing bourbon burn following it. Great caramel malt carrying the weight throughout with some vanilla rounding it off on the back end.
Medium to full in body with a perfect amount of carbonation. I really love the carbonation on this beer! It gives it an amazing mouthfeel. I also love the smooth burn from the bourbon on the finish of this beer. Top notch!
This is an amazing barleywine. Amazing flavor and mouthfeel! This is a must have and it is definitely a world class BBBW. 784 charactersdcloeren, May 21, 2013

A: Pours a dark brown/red color with very little head. Almost looks like wine when the head dissipates. 
S: Smells so strong, I could smell it across the room when I opened the bottle! Huge caramel, bourbon, vanilla, oak and brown sugar/molasses aromas. Smells amazing. 
T: Just like the smell, this has a ton of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and bourbon. Raisins and figs are in there too, but brown sugar dominates. There's a slight hint of dulce de leche and chocolate hidden in there. Big sweetness in the beginning but it fades towards the finish as you get the blast of oak and bourbon. A nice bit of burn at the end as well. 
M: Very balanced for 14%. Nice and thick bodied with low carbonation. Incredibly smooth and velvety.
O: One of the best barleywines I've had, up there with Leon and King Henry. I will need to revisit Sucaba soon to see where that one stands. 887 charactersstandardcherry, May 16, 2013

2012 in snifter
High hopes for this one....
A - poured down the middle, starts as a nice amber color, head is a thin golden/brown that dissipates quick. full glass is a nice dark brown with ruby highlights
S - could smell this one since the second I started pouring it, big bourbon smell in the air. Stick you nose in it and you a thick/sweet/molasses and bourbon smell with some vanilla. Thick and sweet best describes this smell for me
T - I am SO impressed how this beer finished off! Its got that great bourbon and barley wine start but the heat from the booze finishes and dies so smoothly. Brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, its all really well balanced
M - heavy and syrupy 
O - exceeded my hopes, i really enjoy this one, its a huge thick sweet boozy beer that is perfectly balanced for me. I went in to this one in the headset that maybe we don't need to bourbon the hell out of everything but the way it works on this one restores the faith that Doom destroyed. Definitely going to keep up with the releases on this one

Vintage 2011 served up at cellar temp.
A dark mahogany brew with a small tan head
The nose is of sweet caramelized sugar, not much else on the nose.
The taste is of bourbon, vanilla and caramelized sugar. This brew is on the sweeter side, not surprising considering the ABV is 14%. The mouthfeel is full and vinous.
Not bad when a sweeter and bigger brew is called for. 409 charactersalpineclimber, Apr 28, 2013

Appearance. Pours a deep brown with some red-amber coming through at the edges of the glass. Topped with a finger of orange-tan head.
Smell. Sweet toffee, woody bourbon and vanilla, some brown sugar and molasses with just a hint of dark fruit.
Taste. Brown sugar and caramel, bourbon and fresh barrel wood, a little molasses and burnt sugar. Not as sweet as it may sound from this description. A little hop bitterness in the finish, but not a ton of hop flavour. Nice stuff, just a little boozy.
Mouthfeel. Full body, just a bit sticky. Medium-low carbonation.
Overall. A really nice barleywine that could probably stand another year or two at least to mellow. That being said it's very tasty right now. 735 charactersRutager, Apr 23, 2013

A - Almost black body. As I hold it up to the light it looks a very deep red. 2 finger head from aggressive pour that quickly settles leaving a small rim of bubbles.
S - Heavy bourbon, lots of wood/oak, rasin, plum.
T - Bourbon/booze at first, vanilla, sweet but not overly so, a lot of dark fruits in the finish.
M - Medium to full, not a lot of carbonation, smooth. 407 characterss1ckboy, Apr 21, 2013

It’s good and all, but frankly I’m burned out on barrel-aged things. It tastes like vanilla. Or—OR, it tastes fiery like whiskey. And also a little like beer. Whoopie.
I mean, again, it tastes good and all, but I kind of miss the days when we got excited because beer tasted like beer.
Back when I brewed, I sucked. I could understand brewing on paper and had a decent enough nose and palette to tell between different hop and yeast varieties. But I’m impatient and have ADD and am 1/18th basset hound and therefore prone to running through glass porch doors in pursuit of sparkly butterflies. Where was I going with that? Oh, yeah! Impatience! That and brewing do not mix, and so I’d always do something stupid or forget something important and my beers would turn out not very good.
But one time I brewed a high-acid double IPA and I put a cheesecloth sack full o’ oak chips in the secondary. It tasted pretty damn good. All of the off nodes—which, trust me, simply must have been there—were blotted out by vanilla and alcohol and citrusy hops. I cheated, and so I won. 
Extremity erases character. That’s why it’s so weird to think that at one point Hitler was a sensitive painter type. Not to say this is the Hitler of beers. I mean, yeah, it gets Shit done, however messily—but I’m going down a weird road, here.
Again, this is not the Hitler of beers.
It does, however, win the award for most annoying shit I’ve ever seen written on a bottle. I’m too full of worms to get up and see what it actually said, but it was something like “you got to wait years on the ocean to see a storm this intense.” Breweries should hire writers. I could do much better. Like, I’d said “this beer is like vanilla and barleywine like a pelican’s salty, barnacled beak.” That sucked. Fine. But it was still less lame than what they wrote.

Pours a very deep cherry wood red, almost mahogany. Clear coming out of the bottle, but so dark it's almost opaque. Just a touch of head, gone fast, and little lacing. Okay with that.
Smell bursts with that incredible brightness that all the best barleywines have. A divine blend of dark fruit, backed by brown sugar, with a soft touch of well-blended whiskey.
Taste is a small step down from the smell, but still really really good. It's just a bit more sluggish, with less pop and vividness than the smell. The bourbon comes on powerfully in the latter part, but backs off right when I want it to. Front end is brown sugar, molasses, plums, and everything dark and sweet that goes along with them. But where the smell was bright reddish, the taste is more muddled and orange.
Mouthfeel is really nice. Big, heavy, and sticky. Carbonation is exactly where it should be - right in the middle, enough to move things around, but not so much as to disrupt the flavors settling. And it sticks to my mouth, allowing those fabulous flavors to linger.
This is up there with the best. Haven't had Sucaba recently enough to say which I prefer, but this is in the same league. Among the top barleywines I've had. Fantastic. 1,423 characterszeledonia, Mar 10, 2013

Served in an oversized snifter - muddy garnet body, light cream lace. Pungent aroma fills the room - bourbon, spice, dark fruits. This is a monster of a beer - a rich array of barrel influences dominated by bourbon and oak. Brown sugar, raisins, dates, syrupy booze, thick malt. Very good - i think I favor Central Waters though, for the style. 377 charactersdirtylou, Mar 03, 2013

Aroma is deep dark dried fruits - figs and dates - plus brown sugar, molasses, caramel... ooey gooey sticky goodness.
Taste is powerful and rich. Rum-soaked figs, burnt sugar, toffee, caramel, boozy bourbon and vanilla. A nice firm bitterness on the finish.
Mouthfeel is heavy, chewy, sticky, coating. Lingering aftertaste. Alcohol warms the throad as it goes down. Exactly what I'd expect, but even more so.
Overall I'm impressed. This is an unapologetically big bold beer. 644 charactersdraheim, Mar 02, 2013

A: Pours a dark murky reddish-brown. Big fizzy dark tan/almost brown head. Interesting coloration on the head, haven't really seen exactly that shade before. Fades at a moderate pace, leaving no lacing at all behind. Minimal head retention, fizzes out quickly.
S: Whoa. Big, huge malty notes. Loads of brown sugar, caramel and molasses primarily. A bit of vanilla too. Touch of dark fruits, mainly raisin. Super sickly sweet. Wonderful.
T: Notable bourbon up front with caramel and toffee and vanilla. Mixes in with brown sugar, molasses, even honey? Just brief hints of raisin and fig but the sugary sweetness is really what stands out here. Sweetness fades into the finish, leaving a bit of oak, toffee and the bourbon burn. Lingering bourbon and oak between sips.
M: Low carbonation and very heavy body makes this one thick and syrupy
O: This is big and malty and ultra sweet. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a 14% bourbon barrel english barleywine. Wonderful beer, the only real fault I could find is when the bourbon stands alone in the aftertaste, it tastes kinda like cheapish bourbon. I'm guessing evan williams like previous vintages. Regardless, not nearly as hot as you'd expect for a fresh 14% barrel-aged barleywine, hell this bottle is barely 3 months old. Honestly, sucaba has nothing on this beer, this should be #1 handily. 1,369 charactersDope, Feb 27, 2013

4/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle: Poured a lightly cloudy dark brown color ale with a medium size head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light whisky notes with some brown sugar, toffee and some pretty robust caramelized malt notes. Taste is a great mix between some toffee notes with some brown sugar and caramelized malt with some whisky notes which kinds of round off the rough edge. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no real apparent alcohol. Very well done but I would have like the residual sugar to be more subtle which would have provide more space for the malt backbone to shine. 591 charactersPhyl21ca, Feb 25, 2013

A - the beer, after an aggressive pour, displays a deep ruby black in color; this mofo has a 'sparkling sound' from the carbonation as well; the mocha head sits contently even after the initial pour; bubbled lacing sits but moves 
S - there is a LOT going on in the nose here: bourbon covered caramel apple; that brown sugar sweetness; vanilla; candied plums; whisky yams...is that a legit concept? That's what I'm getting
T - man, I love this beer: everything going on in the nose and more! That whisky yam thing carries over predominantly; some cherries; some milk chocolate; oak char; vanilla; brown sugar; molasses; candied prune; f me...booze! Also, there are some cotton candy notes as this one warms up.
M - this one has a little heat to it...which at 14%, I can't say I'm shocked; the beer is nonetheless smooth and nicely syrupy; this one is a little chewy, but I dig it. The heat lingers after a swallow, but yeah...I dig that shit; heavy all in all
O - all I can say is, I'm glad I have another one. I'm looking forward to seeing how this beer develops. It's a damn fine barleywine...maybe the best BW I've had to this point. It's got so many different flavors, the perfect amount of sweetness, an awesome ABV....a sipping man's BW. I'll be working towards a case next year Pelican! 1,359 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Feb 21, 2013

This poured out as a deep brown color, there was a thin bubbly head on top that didn't last too long. The retention faded and there really wasn't any lacing either but there was some viscosity on the glass after each sip. The smell of the beer wasn't as potent as I was expecting or hoping for. The beer smells sweet and earthy with some subtle booze on the nose. The taste is sweet, there is a touch of maple in there with some earthy peat but it's very hidden. The bitterness is low just a touch of it in the finish but for the most part this beer is very malty and for the right reasons. The mouthfeel is smooth, it's slick and very mellow. Not much carbonation here but just enough. Overall it was a good brew, holds up well to the style, I found it to be enjoyable. 832 charactersKnapp85, Feb 19, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hell yeah! Thanks to whomever opened this one up at a recent tasting (forgot who brought it). Never thought I'd get to try this one. Pours a deep-ass ruby-red color, appearing jet black underneath dim lighting. The tan head reaches about a quarter-inch, but fades quickly into nothingness. Aroma is dense, heavy, and robust as fuck. Loaded with sweet caramel, toasted brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, oak, wood, light vanilla, and candied dark fruits. There's no mistaking thing brew - it is powerful as all hell, and you'll know it after taking one whiff.
The first flavor to go to work on the palate is a delicate, yet strong display of booze-soaked raisins, dates, and juicy plums, with the booze, of course, being a whiskey-bourbon type blend. Malt bomb, incoming - melted brown sugar, thick syrup and molasses, more juicy dark fruits, and plenty of clashing cocoa and oaky vanilla flavors. This beer is sweet as hell, but never hits the point of being cloying, as it's kept in check by the dense oak and warm bourbon profile, making it insanely drinkable, even at a whopping 14% ABV. Nice, sweet molasses, vanilla, and booze in the finish; thick, syrupy mouth feel with a low level of carbonation.
Hot damn, this was an amazing brew. 2012 vintage. Absolutely delicious and dangerously drinkable given the pretty high ABV. Wonderful display of flavors clashing together with an addicting sweetness than never becomes overbearing. Well done. 1,445 characterstectactoe, Feb 10, 2013

S: Deep caramel malts are in the front of this beer followed by a rich bourbon aroma.
T: Rich caramel malts are primary flavor. The smoothness of the oak and bourbon cut through this very nicely.
M: Sharpness comes from the alcohol and subtle carbonation. It is nice a viscous and fills the mouth well.
O: One of but no the best Barleywine. I like King Henry, 2010 Bourbon BA Old Guardian, and Abacus more, but this is one of the elite barleywines. 492 charactersjvillefan, Feb 05, 2013

Thanks to KAlvarez for doing the legwork on this one!
A - Perfectly clear ruby mahogany in color with a fast-forming tan head, it's thick but there's almost no retention, due to the high alcohol level, and no lacing left on the glass. Give this beer a swirl and you'll see legs slowly dribble down, though.
S - Rich molasses and toasted pumpernickel bread arise with a rich and smooth warm alcohol bourbon barrel aroma that adds light oak and vanilla. This is aged to perfection without being hot. A plethora of fruity notes enter as well; raisin, fig newton, and chocolate covered dark cherry. 
T - Maltiness overwhelms with a punch of sweet caramel and dry toasted bread following behind. Notes of milk chocolate emerge with grace as the attention shifts towards the smooth barrel-aging. Oak and vanilla pull from the aroma to flavor easily and are flanked by warming bourbon while the beer finishes with the aroma's fruity notes.
M - Gentle carbonation caresses the tongue, keeping the beer from syrupiness because it's one full bodied barleywine. Smooth on the palate, the feel is robust and sweet but nicely balanced by alcohol heat and dryness on the finish as this beer lingers for quite a while, slowly turning lightly bitter and gritty.
O - Mother of all Storms is a quintessential barrel-aged barleywine, showcasing exceptional malt flavor and layers of complexity with bready notes, chocolate nuances, and bourbon wamth. Sip gingerly, soaking in the uniqueness and depth of this one-of-a-kind beer, and share with others, for it's a heavy hitter begging to be split and savored. 1,671 charactersBeerFMAndy, Feb 03, 2013

A: Dark brown pour which allows some light to shine through when held to the light. Half finger, cream head despite a moderate - aggressive pour. Head quickly dissipates, leaving a tiny ring around the edge of the glass.
S: HUGE oak presence, followed by bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar sweetness, and caramel. Really surprised by the amount of oak I am picking up in the nose, almost overpowering.
T: Upfront flavors of booze and bourbon. The oak barrel is apparent here as well. The booze gives way to caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and something like burnt sugar on the back end. 
M: Moderate carbonation. This isn't a thin beer by any means, but I was expecting something a bit thicker based on the abv and my experiences with several other recent barrel aged barleywines. 
O: I will be honest, I enjoyed this beer but I was slightly underwhelmed by it. Do not read that as this not being a good beer, it absolutely is. I also realize that my excessive expectations are not the fault of the beer, but I feel like this was just a step below some of the other top barrel aged barleywines (e.g., King Henry, BB Monster 29), for my palate at least. 1,202 charactersdbc5, Feb 01, 2013
4.66/5  rDev +5.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A - Pours a deep rich brown with a tint of mahogany in my oversized DFH snifter. Nearly a finger of somewhat vibrant cream brown/yellowish head (the yellow tint was new to me). The head disappeared within 2 minutes leaving only a thin outer ring and virtually no lacing that hangs onto the glass for more than a few seconds.
S - Lots of oaky alcohol burn, sweet caramel, dark fruits (prune/date) and vanilla. Brown sugar/molasses and bourbon are obvious as well.
T - Ohhhh my, Initially it's super oaky/vanilla/bourbony and the dark fruits (cherry and dates are killer), burnt molasses kicks in shortly after and all the flavor sticks around through the flavor with the addition nice alcohol burn.
M - Full bodied and incredibly smooth, minimal carbonation.
O - Fantastic, the mouth feel of this could not be any better, complex and the flavors are damn near perfectly blended with one another. Will definitely hang on to a few of these for a nice dinner. 959 charactersMacQ32, Jan 31, 2013

Appearance: Deep dark garnet with barely a finger's worth of a brown head that dissipates almost immediately. Massive alcohol legs and big lacing. 
Smell: Bourbon, vanilla oak, brown sugar, dark fruit, rum soaked figs or dates. Carmelized sugars. 
Taste: Bourbon, oakiness, burnt sugar, sour cherries. Ton of barrel character going on here. Bourbon and caramel fill the end of the tongue. The toasted malt plays off the sweetness nicely, along with the surprising sour-like character at the tip of the tongue. Rich bourbon throughout that distinctly tastes like older bourbon (rather than young, fresh bourbon). 
Mouthfeel: Full with just enough carbonation. 
Overall: The subtle bitterness at the end of the tongue detracts from the overall flavor. Otherwise a very enjoyable, dark fruit forward barley wine. 849 charactersBrandywine, Jan 23, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep brown/black with a very small dark tan head (less than a finger). Pours relatively thick, but looks quite appetizing.
Smell: Chocolate and bourbon meet the nose first, with a kick. Some caramel, vanilla and figs/raisins as well. The aroma finishes with some alcohol. Quite an interesting smelling beer.
Taste: Pretty complex tasting beer: bourbon up front, along with possibly a toffee-like flavor. Definitely some chocolate in there, along with a bit of vanilla. This one packs a ton of flavor into each sip, awesomely complex.
Mouth-feel: Perfect amount of carbonation for a beer of this depth and complexion. Fairly thick but not quite as thick as the nose suggests. A very well balanced beer for what it is.
Overall: This beer exceeded my high expectations and is an excellent version of a BA Barleywine. So many flavors, and they balance very well together. Definitely a beer to sip and enjoy as it opens up over time. I highly recommend this brew. 1,069 charactersResuin, Jan 18, 2013

O - Overall, nice barleywine, balanced and complex, sweet brown sugar and caramel, toffee with touches of molasses. Not sure I'd put this up as one of my overall favorites in the style, but it is definitely a solid beer and one I'm glad to have tried. 866 charactersportia99, Jan 08, 2013

Beer is down right dirty. Very great taste initially cold then better with warmth. I have this ranked no1 in Barleywines as of right now. Fairly new to Barleywines but ive had highly ranked ones and this is tops. Was going to give it a perfect score but no. Thats for PtY, PtE, Westy12. With time, this may be perfect.

Pour: Super dark brown body, but not quite black. A very small tan head forms and disappears quickly, leaving only a rim along the glass.
Smell: Big sticky toffe up front, followed by some dark, chocolate covered figs and raisins. A light roastiness. Some boozy caramel bourbon comes through on the finish.
Taste: Follows the nose, but with a big roastiness at first, that quickly morphs into chewy chocolate covered figs and raisins. Heavy, super sticky bourbon toffee and caramel dominates the majority of the palate. A thick sweet booze finishes.
Mouthfeel: Boozy, but relatively well balanced. Booze and sweetness can get cloying, but only serve to make this a lon time sipper, which is enjoyable with me. 
Overall: A really decadent beer. Probably best for sharing, which is the way I will go the next time I have a bottle. 886 characterscfrances33, Dec 26, 2012

Taste- wow! This is the most complex beer I have had to date. Picking up on all of the nose plus some dark fruit, cherries, and big brown sugar. Alcohol is warming but not too apparent for a beer of this magnitude. 
Mouthfeel- medium to heavy body. Low carbonation, but just right for this style.nice warming alcohol but not too hot. Just right for the style.

Classic English barleywine aroma of caramel malt and dark fruit with nice bourbon and oak notes. Flavor follows with caramel malt, brown sugar, bourbon, dark dried fruit, a hint of cherry and chocolate. Finishes somewhat dry with oak and light hops. Medium bodied. Alcohol is covered but still hot and warming. A really nice English barleywine that was worth waiting for. Will lay a few bottles away for ageing, I think this will score even higher when the alcohol mellows and the flavors balance out over time. 725 charactersLiquidAmber, Dec 25, 2012

Appearance - Deep brown with some reddish notes. Khaki head retains nicely and settles to an island of foam and naught else.
Smell - Lots of bourbon goodness. Oak and vanilla. Deep brown sugar and caramel. Everything you'd like in a BA barleywine. Maybe some hops come through as well.
Taste - Everything the nose belies, with an intense boozy and strange aftertaste. Bourbon up front, but it doesn't linger. Lots of caramel and dark brown sugar. Hop bite in the back with an intense nutty/oaky flavor. It's kind of unpleasant and I don't get it out of other BA barleywines.
Mouthfeel - It's quite boozy and that aftertaste is harsh. Not really sure what it is.
Overall - I have had different vintages of this beer from 2010 to 2012 and all of them have had the same off-putting aftertaste. It's not awful, but it could be so much better. Not sure if it's a nutty malt or an oaky flavor, but it keeps this from being the perfect BA barleywine. That said, it's still incredible. 1,070 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 24, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
2012 Vintage 
Thanks a million to Lurchingbeast for hooking me up with this bottle. 
Appearance: Mother of all Storms appears very dark brown (almost black) in the glass, with a back light revealing beautiful deep crimson highlights and red edges that fad into a beautiful golden amber. A rough pour yields a good sized cookie dough coloured head that fizzes away quite quickly and leaves almost no lacing. A light swirl coats the glass in heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: The initial nose is almost all bourbon with big vanilla notes alongside sweet caramel, butter scotch and oak. As the beer begins to warm, caramelized brown sugar, toffee, dark treacle a myriad of dark fruits (raisins, dates, black cherries, plums and red grapes), toasted grains and some chocolate become apparent. There is a trace of the 13,5%, but it is far from bothersome. 
Taste: As promised by the nose, this is an absolutely delicious barley wine. Flavour notes include: Brown sugar, sweet caramel, dark toffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, butter scotch, cherries, raisins, stewed plums, some chocolate, a faint roasted note, a little liquorice and some dark treacle. Unlike the nose, there is not trace of the 13,5% and this makes Moas dangerously drinkable. 
Mouthfeel: Initially quite over carbonated for my tastes (medium-high level), but thankfully the carbonation settles down quite quickly. the body is medium-full and fairly chewy. 
Overall: Mother of all storms is a fantastic barrel aged barleywine and one I hope to have again in the future. 1,606 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 20, 2012

Appearance: - not much head, but a great oil rubbed bronze color.
Smell: Nice scents of figs, rich malt, bourbon, wood, but all over powered a little by a woody raisin bran aroma. 
Taste: Diverse! Some many flavors! Bourbon, malt, oak, vanilla, barley, dried candied dry cherries, but damn that raisin bran! 
Mouthfeel: For 14% - nice bite, but smoothness that makes it hard to feel that abv. It also reflects far more carbonation than its appearance does.
Overall: This is my first time have MOAS and I wish I had never read any reviews on previous years. It's hard to think this one compares. 635 charactersTheBeerTruck, Dec 19, 2012

O: Very, very good beer. Well-put-together, and the bourbon and oak don't overwhelm the other flavors. I'm very impressed with this one. 629 charactersmacrosmatic, Dec 19, 2012

A- Pours a very dark red/ maroon with a small amount of a khaki colored head that quickly fades. Some light comes through but overall it's the darkest barleywine I have seen. 
S- Aromas of oak and bourbon are most apparent to me. As it warms some vanilla seems to come through as well. 
T- Starts off smooth with oak and bourbon notes like the smell. Drinks hot but is an easier sipper as it warms. I get notes of vanilla and toffee, as well as some bready malts and raisin/ dark fruits. This one drinks very nice. 
M- Medium to heavy body, low on the carbonation, a nice sipper that drinks hot but smooth. 
A nice beer for sure. This and Sucaba are up there as my favorite English Barley Wines I have had. Luckily I have several more bottles of this to age and see how it mellows out. 931 charactersvic21234, Dec 10, 2012
3.82/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52012 vintage. The pour reveals about a finger of head which is light brown in color with a lot of red in it. Body is pretty dark and is also very deep maroon/red. The foam falls quickly to a trace. Aroma is big and sweet. The in-your-face bourbon, raisin, vanilla, and molasses fill your nose quickly. There is a bunch of alcohol burn as well. One sip reveals a lot more bitter chocolate, and dark fruit. Not expecting that. A bunch of molasses and some alcohol. Mouth is quite good with nice carbonation and a very full body. A little syrupy. 
I had this right after trying Bligh's and they are completely different. This is not nearly as sweet and has chocolate and bitter/dark fruits. Maybe some time really helps this beer out, but right now I don't think it is the league of exceptional English Barleywines. 813 charactersRuckusDu, Dec 09, 2012

2012 Bottling
Incredibly complex nose and flavor of caramel, toffee, bourbon (lots of it), sherry, cognac, vanilla, oak, raisins, honey, kumquats, orange zest, persimmons, plums, peaches, strawberries, prunes, dates, figs, cherries, pecan pralines, rhubarb, toasted coconut, leather, tobacco, and a hint of smokiness.
The body is syrupy, but playfully so, not sticky or cloying. This beauty has legs like Angelina, and the mouth becomes delightfully coated as the sipping continues. The finish is one of the longest I've ever experienced, and the woodiness and the alcohol prevent this one from becoming too sweet (as a gentleman before me pointed out).
It's been quite a few years since I was an ardent fan of the barleywine style, but this one absolutely blew me away, even fresh. I can only imagine what a few years of aging might achieve. 902 charactersImpfan, Dec 08, 2012

 A: Dark brackish brown with tints of red. No head after an aggressive pour. 
N: Malt, licorice, caramel, and toffee. Brown sugar. Has an inviting nose. Bourbon, vanilla, coconut, and oak are present, subtly. Biscuity sweetness. Quite nice. 
T: Very sweet. Loads of brown sugar, toffee, and licorice. The bourbon goodness of the nose is very muted. There is some oak, but it’s very light. Does become cloying. Wish this matched the nose. 
M: Thick and sticky. Coats the palate. 
O: Glad this is distributed, because I definitely don’t need more than one and it would've bee a long drive to Pacific City to be nonplussed. Needs a ton more bourbon, otherwise it doesn’t justify the cost increase over the Stormwatcher's Winterfest or even the Wee Heavy. *Sigh* 2009 seems so long ago, though this is better than the 2011/2010 vintages when they were fresh. 936 charactersSarlacc83, Dec 07, 2012

A: Poured a deep brown with good carbonation. 
S: Nose is bourbon, booze and vanilla. 
T: Taste is off because I thought it was poorly carbonated. I did find notes of bourbon, toasted grains, caramel, toffee, dark fruits and booze. This beer was all over the place. Not a subtle barleywine and I have had many barrel aged bwines which were capabale of pulling flavors together much better. 
M: Mouthfeel is hot and bourbon but mainly because I did not find much on mouthfeel to help balance it out. There is a sherry like quality to it 
O: I struggled and wanted to give it an A but no dice

2011-Mother of All Storms ampled 1/8/2012 and 12/1/2012
A: Poured a medium brown with a nice tan cap and some bubbles
S: I get a unique cotton candy nose on this with toffee, brown sugar, bourbon and booze
T: Immediate atringency with brown sugar and toffee, a little bit of residual sugar, bourbon midway with some pungent heat. I managed to pick up some light leather, vanilla and cocoa
M: Medium body but I still feel this beer was carbonated a bit high for the style, seemed a bit thin on the back end, perhaps due to the heat. Booze and a syrupy sweetness on the back end and an odd twang to boot I can best describe as liquid dirt.
O: Originally I gave this a cut above average. I c have changed my mind. After afting the first runs, vintages and fresh I still believe this beer is thin, hot and off balanced. The tannins on this beer just a killer for me. In no way is this a true to style English Bwine and I feel by taste, experience and BJCP standards this is a poor showing. 1,613 charactersbarleywinefiend, Dec 02, 2012

Enjoyed the 1st bottle with my bro celebrating the Cards victory over the Niners that night...drank very hot. Matt - i appreciate all your efforts getting that case!
Beer poured a reddish brown with a small tan head.
Nose is bourbon that is still going pretty good after all these months.
Taste is a nice balance between the bourbon and the malt sweetness. Vanilla notes linger in the back. Hops are barely noticeable. Alcohol appropriately warming but not overwhelming.
Mouthfeel is pretty full and smooth.
Overall this brew is doing quite well after a year of mellowing out in my wine cooler. Bourbon heat is just right compared to a year ago. Definitely would recommend the splurge if you have the cash! 826 charactersarizcards, Nov 24, 2012

Pours like a black cup of coffee... minimal ruby-black clarity. A single finger of creamy tan head fizzles down to a nice lasting collar, oily drapes of thick lace.
Beautiful scotchy caramel and smooth bourbon, ripe raisin, some grape soda, molasses, brown sugar, pancakes, more sweet bourbon... really an incredible smelling beer. 
Soft bourbon character, rum raisin, vanilla, some licorice, still pretty damn hot but nothing you have to struggle with... toffee, some biscuit malts, a little bit of fruit... nice.

It definitely got sweeter over time and alcohol burn is pretty much gone at this point.  
Still ton of barrel character, toffee, vanilla, caramel...  wow.  Amazing.  I am upping my rating.  
2011 Vintage bottle - consumed on 11/21/2012. 
A: It's almost black - really dark reddish brown but clear body with half a finger head. 
S: Wow. Vanilla, caramel, oak, dark fruits, alcohol, sweetness. amazing. 
T: Vanilla, toffee, caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruits (plum, cherries, fig). It's a tad bit hot. Barrel aging on this beer is done to perfection, adding so much complexity. If it was slightly less sweet and less boozy, it would been perfect. I think this could use another year or two of further cellaring. 
Update* - I had a chance to try 2012 bottle (fresh) and I have to say that the fresh bottle had much more fruit notes and surprisingly less alcohol burn. It felt sweeter too. 
M: Thick, syrupy, with lots of alcohol heat. 
O: I think I much refer fresh Abacus/Sucaba over this, but it was pretty solid. Too sweet for me though. 1,157 characterssukwonee, Nov 21, 2012

Pitch black in glass which is a little surprising to me for the style. Bubbly tan head head with pretty short retention. 
Solid bourbon barrel character in the nose. Caramel, notes of dark fruit and molasses. Not quite as complex as I'd hoped but nice. 
Flavor is pretty big and bright with notes of dark fruit, oak, a bit of anise, caramel and molasses with a mild bitterness. Mildly sweet vanilla wafflecone-like aftertaste. 
Mouth is medium-full bodied with low carb. A bit sticky. 
Overall it's a very good beer but not quite as good as I had anticipated. I have traded away a few and put off the chance to try this and am finally trying it. Maybe I set my hopes a little too high? Some say it's better fresher?? 724 charactersMrVonzipper, Nov 13, 2012

This pours a deep ruby red color with a small off-white head. Its` nose contains caramel, brown sugar and quite a bit of bourbon. The smell is very fragrant, but those who enjoy bourbon from time to time, it is quite nice. Sipping on this and I taste vanilla, toffee, more bourbon and some oak.

A vigorous pour produces a thin active layer of mixed yellow-browns: khaki/citrine/fulvous which bubble out to a thin lasting collar and smattering of surface slick. Delicate lacing is suspended in viscous tears. The liquid below is an abyssal shade of auburn.
The bourbon barrel contributes immense aroma without any sharpness, redolent of fine tobacco, leather, loam, vanilla, and cocoa for starters...a low fruity note like that of a fine sherry flitters in and out as well.
Deep unctuous palate entry intensifies all the aromas into corresponding flavors and integrates them into a delicately shifting yet extremely potent cascade. Gentle hops contribute just enough bitterness to offset the immensity of the malt which itself is just strong enough to stand as a foil against the bourbon notes. Finishes moderately dry, fruity, and earthy. Surprisingly balanced and clean despite its stunning richness.
Silky mouthfeel is like melted chocolate ganache on the tongue though sufficient carbonation enlivens the mouthfeel.
An inspired and inspiring glass - a truly top tier example of the style...while any one element might be improved upon in theory, doing so would upset the balance of the whole. 1,278 charactersaugustgarage, Sep 16, 2012

Acquired via online purchase
(Aged for 1 year)
A very, very dark brown and ruby, though it's so dark, it's really bordering on black as opposed to a brown. Very small dark brown head/film atop the glass that dies down quickly, then leaves the glass fairly clean, perhaps a bit oily, on the way down.
Familiar, comforting aroma of bourbon and wood, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits, vanilla and molasses. Everything comes together nicely, the alcohol is well hidden, and all accents work in concert with one another. Wonderful.
The flavor is similarly nice to the aroma, with the dark fruits and barrel character combining nicely, complemented by some chocolate, roast, and earth. The alcohol is hidden remarkably well for the beer's strength.
Medium bodied with creamy, somewhat oily, low-moderate carbonation.
Superb stuff. 844 charactersehammond1, Aug 19, 2012

2011 Vintage
Thanks to Veldrid for sending this one over in a trade
A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, but when held to the light reveals some nice reddish hues, and is surprisingly transparent for how dark it appears sitting in the glass.  Really pretty color once you get towards the bottom of the glass and red and mahogany hues can be better seen.  An aggressive pour yields just under 1 fingers width of mocha colored head which dissipates down very quickly and leaves no appreciable lacing. 
S: A big oak aroma, toffee, a bit of bourbon, significant dark fruits including sweet cherries, a hint of booze, caramel.  Intoxicating.  
T: Sweet dark fruits, oak, a bit of hop bitterness, fig and dates, the oak/woody notes are big, but the bourbon characters are surprisingly weak. Some booze comes out as it warms.  Not as complex as some in the style, and I would have liked a stronger bourbon presence, but for a style that tends to lack balance (whether it be cloyingly sweet, smack you in the face bourbon, or booze dominance) this one manages to do a wonderful job of maintaining it.  
M/D: Medium bodied but not as thick as I anticipated.  Carbonation is fairly high for the style, but works well with the thinner body.  Drinkability is just absurdly good, and a huge ABV is brilliantly masked.  
O: So as I was drinking this, I kept trying to compare it to Sucaba, as that's the next highest rated/most hyped English barleywine I've had to date.  And if I remember right, I enjoyed the first part of Sucaba better than the first part of MoAS, however, as I continued to drink (I drank whole bombers of each, as I like to do that when trying a beer for the first time/rating a beer) MoAS seemed to grow on me with every sip, whereas Sucaba became somewhat cloying as I approached the end of the second glass from the bomber.  So as far as which one I liked more, well it's a really tough call, but I think I'd lean towards MoAS.  I think a combination of the two ( with MoAS's insane drinkability combined with more of a bourbon presence and a thicker mouthfeel similar to Sucaba), would be the perfect Barleywine.  Maybe that's what King Henry is like....  That being said, this was excellent, and I will certainly seek it out again.   2,301 characterszac16125, Aug 07, 2012

T: After starting with Abacus this one was a little odd for me. It was well balanced and the bourbon wasn't too overpowering. But the finish was left with a weird after taste. It didn't taste bad... Just odd.
M: The carbonation was a little low. Hard to hide that high ABV level. I could definitely taste it.
O: A good English Barleywine. Personally, I would choose Abacus over this. Even though it's rated higher. Might had been a bad batch or something. It was good but the odd after taste killed it a little. 793 charactersRinkor16, Jun 28, 2012

A: Pours a nice dark brown with a little tan head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a little lacing. Decent for the style but certainly not the best head I've seen.
S: Smells lovely. Nice caramel and bourbon up front with some brown sugar, figs, and vanilla character.
T: The smell was lovely and the taste didn't let me down. I am getting the bourbon and caramel that I noted in the aroma, along with some vanilla. The background has some brown sugar and dark fruit. Really well put together.
M: This is a nice hefty barleywine with pretty light carbonation, but well within the range I expect for the style. There is just the slightest hint of booze going down.
O: I really like this beer, probably my favorite barleywine. I usually like my barleywines a bit hoppier, but this was my favorite (so far anyway). I will do my best to age a few. 897 charactersBigTomZ, Jun 22, 2012

A: Pours a clear mahogany color with a finger of off white head that quickly receded to a very thin ring. Minimal carbonation.
S: Lots of dark fruits - figs and raisins and caramel behind with some well integrated bourbon in the background. Not overly sweet though.
T: Similar to aroma, but more toffee and bourbon. I still get a good amount of dark fruit, but well balanced with the toffee and bourbon. Also has a good amount of bitterness to balance perfectly.
M: Medium mouthfeel with low, creamy carbonation.
O: This beer is very well balanced between toffee and dark fruit sweetness and hop bitterness. The bourbon is very well integrated. Probably my favorite Barleywine, definitely more balanced than most of the style. 759 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Jun 14, 2012

 2010 vintage
A-- Dark brown with tints of ruby showing. Real nice color and hue to this. One finger light brown head that faded away to a thin film and collar. Obvious alcohol legs and left not traces of lacing. Just the alcohol legs. 
S-- Yikes. Impressive nose. Forward bourbon, thick and rich carmel, vanilla, and oak. Underneath that was figs and dark fruits. Alcohol is very restrained in the nose. 
T-- See above :) Just a silly mixture of figs, bourbon, vanilla, Oak, Carmel and touches of dark fruits. Just jelled together very well. 
M-- Rich, luscious and thick. Medium bodied and light carbonation. Long lasting finish of bourbon, vanilla, figs and carmel. 
O-- Gone before I knew it and was sad. Really well done beer and enough notes of the base beer to keep it interesting even with the very forward barrel notes. Alcohol was well hidden until the end and it hit like a hammer. Then again you just need one of these for the night. 983 charactersmulder1010, Jun 12, 2012

Poured into a Westy chalice a very nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, nice fizzy almost one-finger dark tan head, with some little oil slicks left behind. The nose is very nice malty, with some nice sweetness, lots of dark fruits, with a nice little bourbon note. The taste is exceptional, malty, very sweet, with lots of figs, raisins, plums, nice little touch of bourbon, caramel, slight chocolate note, vanilla. Full/Medium body, ABV hidden very well, a true sipper though. This has got to be the best BW I've had to date, definitely the best English BW. Finally I'm getting a chance to try this brew.

A: Deep Chocolatey brown, light brown head that didn't produce much head or leave any lacing.
S: Bourbon Bourbon and more Bourbon, with some roasty toasty malt in there.
T: Great complexity of flavor, Even with the Big Bourbon flavor this beer is balanced enough to taste some really good malt profile. The finish was a little odd for me, I can't put words to the flavor but it just tasted different and not that good on swallowing.
M: Hard to hide 13.5% in there, this thing def tasted and felt like a High ABV beer. Carbonation was a lil low.
O: Drinking this next to Abacus I would have to rate it just below because of the weird after taste, if it weren't for that the complexity of flavor was better. King Henry is in a league of his own. This was a really good beer, def something I would want to sip around a campfire. 884 charactersanimortician, Jun 07, 2012

pours a muddy black/brown with a smallish tan head that quickly recedes and laces okay, there seems to be alcohol legs that rise above the head. very nice and on point for the style.
booze, raisins, caramel malts, spiced rum, vanilla, wood. a lot going on here actually, but booze is strong. expecting a monster of a beer.
yep. that's a monster beer. very boozy, and very sweet. bourbon and molasses with vanilla, caramel, raisins, rum, wood. some toasted malts and charred wood come out as it warms to balance out the sweetness a bit, but this remains a sweet, boozy, delicious monster of a beer.
medium/full bodied with a slight carbonation and a sticky sweetness that lingers and an alcohol warmth you can feel all the way down your throat to your chest.
well, I'm impressed. Not as smooth as Abacus (sucaba), not as complex as King Henry, and boozier than both, but should be included in the conversation with the best barleywines out there. I'll be seeking more of these out. wonder what more age will do. 1,171 characterssilentjay, May 20, 2012

Score: 82
2011 vintage bottle served in a plastic cup and enjoyed the night before Dark Lord Day (04/27/12). Review is from notes.
Appearance: Looks like syrup. 4/5
Smell: Caramel malt, booze, brown sugar, light barley and a hint of cherry. Lots of malt and ample bourbon. 4/5
Taste: Loads of caramel malt flavor and booze. Like a lot of booze. And residual cherry. Maybe a little brown sugar. The flavor of this beer is essentially 90% caramel, 9% booze and 1% cherry flavor. Hot, unbalanced, and super malty. 3.25/5
Mouthfeel: Has the mouthfeel of hot, malty and boozy syrupy. No carbonation, medium-full bodied. 3.5/5
Overall: Too hot, malty and boozy for my taste, but I guess that's what a traditional barleywine is supposed to be like. For me, a few ounces was enough.
Recommendation: Fans of malty barleywines should seek this one out, but let it cool off in the cellar for a while.
Pairings: Fudge brownies.
Cost: $20 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle. 1,026 charactersjegross2, May 12, 2012

S: Aroma of thick roasted caramel, cocoa , bourbon, figs and raisins blended with oak. 
T: Wow, this is rich! Chocolate, cherry coke, cotton candy and leather intermixed with caramel and roasted caramelized sugar. As these flavors imply, this beer is sweet. Closest thing that comes to mind is Adam, but this has more cherry and less leather in the body. A bit of port with bourbon and american oak barrels really rounding out the sweetness. 
M: Thick chewy sticky resinous caramel with a light carbonation. 
O: This is definitely one of those beers that lived up to the hype. While I had this on my list for probably two years, I was actually very glad to have finally tried this and it lived up to my expectations. I imagine with a few years age on it, it would do well and possibly lose some of the sweetness. Very impressed here. 1,030 charactersalpinebryant, Apr 28, 2012

Pours a cherry leather with a rim of dark tan foam. Smells nougat, bourbon, raisins, chocolate and chewy caramel. Aromas of cake and sugar - a sincerely exquisite nose. Mmmm, cherry, tawny, sweet vanilla cake, rich mousse and caramels. Goddam, this is a good beer. Full bodied for the style with just a hare more carb than I prefer with a good, sticky and chewy finish. This is a truly excellent beer.

Medium sized tan head with a hint of red that goes down slowly. Scent is outstanding! Great toffee and brown sugar notes...nice sweet bourbon booze. You can definitely smell the barrel in this beer...sweet oak and bourbon with some nice dark fruits, toffee, and vanilla. Taste is just as it smell...more complex than I was expecting. All the flavors in the nose are present in the taste and equally distributed, except I get a bit of chocolate in the taste. For such a high ABV beer, this gem is not overly sweet, nor is it too hot and boozy. Well crafted. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a bit sticky. Drinkability is high, as this is a delicious sipper. Overall, I haven't been this impressed about a barrel aged BW since King Henry. Would love to try these guys side by side. I got plenty of love for Sucaba, but KH and this are rightfully powering over it. Fantastic beer! 937 charactersDovaliHops, Apr 20, 2012

Served into a tulip glass
A: Deep dark brown with crimson hues throughout the body. Atop is a small bubbly medium tan colored head that settled out into a thin ring rather quickly. A few splotches of lacing coat the walls, too.
S: Mildly muted when cold, but as this warmed the aroma opened up tenfold. Big dark fruits, sweet caramel, subtle bourbon undertones, vanilla and toffee. It's big and rich, the barrel gave this some wonderful qualities.
T: For a beer this size, it's remarkably drinkable. Vanilla and toasted caramel/sugar are the first on the palate. Plenty of bourbon, winter fruits and wood come through towards the back end.
M: Thick and full-bodied with enough carbonation to keep this from being sticky. Sweet linger and very easy drinking.
For me, this sits right behind King Henry in my favorite bourbon barrel aged Barleywine list. This had so much flavor, all working so well together. Balance is key and this is quite the achievement. 974 charactersShanePB, Apr 16, 2012

T: The beer was very sweet tasting, not quite cloying but still very sweet. There is a lot of caramel/toffee/molasses malt sweetness and a heavy presence of dark fruits (plums mostly but a little fig). Some light bourbon presence and a hint of oakiness. Some very light alcohol present in the finish.
M: Medium to full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and creamy.
O: There is a nice complexity in the flavor and aroma of this beer but there is a heavy sweetness and some alcohol presence. This beer is a definite sipping beer and a very nice one at that...

Appearance: Dark, dark brown with subtle redness. Centimeter thick, khaki head that dissipates ridiculously quick. Barely any lacing at all. 
Smell: Great aromas. Molasses, caramel, vanilla, little bit of bourbon, plums, figs, spices. Huge combination of complex smells. 
Taste: Sweet at first and throughout the majority of the sip. Caramel, burnt sugar, some roasted malts. Bourbon is more pronounced in the flavor than the smell. Huge alcohol flavor towards the end. The booze takes away from overall experience.
Mouthfeel: Thick, heavy drink. It feels like my glass weighs six pounds. Leaves a warm feeling after every sip that lasts for a bit afterwards. Low carbonation. Goes flat pretty fast as it warms up. 
Overall: Not as bad as I might make it out to be. It's a good dessert beer. A definite sipper. The aroma and flavors were above average by far. Very good beer. 972 charactersnmbr0ne, Apr 01, 2012

A - Pours dark caramel brown with a decent one finger tall khaki colored head leaving small streaks of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of toffee, caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, oak, molasses and plenty of bourbon booze. This one still smells a little too hot for my liking but still very nice.
T - Starts off with plenty of sugary sweetness - mostly toffee, caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, etc. - quickly giving way to the hot bourbon booze and some dry oak tannins. Finish is best described as sweet bourbon heat, lingering long after consumption.
M - Big, boozy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. The carb goes a little flat as it sits in the glass and the booze is still way too strong.
O - I remember when I had this beer for the first time. It was a 2009 bottle, consumed in early 2010, and it was the #10 overall beer in the world. At the time I thought that was WAY too high. I have had it twice since then and it is still very good, but the best I have ever had? No way. 1,106 charactersorangesol, Mar 28, 2012

Caramely aroma, strongly malty, a kiss of dark fruits to round things out. Black licorice and molasses join the caramel train across my palate. Meadows of malts are a safe haven for all things barleywine-y.
The 2012 is a clear departure from previous vintages of MoaS, and I like what they've done with the place. Excited to see how this develops with age. 476 charactersbrystmar, Mar 12, 2012

Review for 2011 vintage.
Shared with the wife in the comfort of our home, this one was decanted into a Klokke Roeland globe for myself (a Cascade stem glass for her). Deep and dark, yet still eerily translucent, dark brown color mixed with a glistening bloody maroon, topped with a rocky beige head that retained for a surprisingly long time, and left some soapy lacing on the glass. Complex and tantalizing aroma of dark malty sugars, molasses, juicy dark fruits, and chocolate-covered cherries. Rarely do I give "5" ratings for taste, but I can't really bring myself to rate this beer anything less. Caramel, toffee, thick malts, molasses and milk chocolate up front, a segue of almonds leading to a mid-palate cascade of raisins, figs, black cherries, sherry, brandy, red grapes, and finishing off with flavors of cigar-grade tobacco, vanilla-tinged, wood-soaked bourbon, and a deep-seated earthiness. If that weren't enough, the mouthfeel was intensely creamy and velvety smooth, full-bodied, almost too drinkable, though pretty hot from the alcohol, but you have to expect that from a beer like this. I have a few more bottles of this that I'm going to let age for a while. I'm sure they'll prove to be interesting in a few years. 1,290 charactersRifugium, Mar 11, 2012

A- Pours black, some ruby highlights at the edges when held to light, with a thin tan head that fizzles to a black mirror.
S- The aroma is very powerful, immediately I'm getting big notes of bourbon, dark fruits, some oak and vanilla, as well as a strong sweetness from molasses and caramel. The only beer I've had recently with such an awesome aroma was King Henry, the two actually smell pretty similar with big sweet, fruity booze aromas.
T- Just like the nose, huge bold flavors. Bourbon flavor is prominent but isn't hot or harsh, it blends nicely with oak and vanilla flavors. Lots of fruity berry sweetness along with molasses and malty caramel notes.
M- Full-bodied, very thick and palate-coating, low carbonation emphasizes the thickness of the beer, goes down smoothly with a bit of alcohol warmth.
O- An awesome beer, one of the better barleywines I've had in a long time, I'm struck by the similarities between this beer and King Henry, if you liked one you should definitely try the other. Definitely a great beer for cold, stormy nights. 1,145 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 05, 2012
4.29/5  rDev -2.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle, 2011 release. This one was allowed to warm a little bit before being poured into my Duvel tulip. 
Pelican's Mother of All Storms pours almost stout-like. The body of the beer appears to be all black, but some backlighting reveals scant cherry highlights. Nearly three fingers of foam come together to crown the beer. Head retention is somewhat fleeting though, and lacing is basically nonexistent. The nose is a little weak at first, but really starts to pop as the beer finishes warming. Strong notes of smooth bourbon and caramelized sugar are supported by a secondary aroma of vanilla. The bourbon, while still present, takes more of a back seat role in the flavor profile. Some creamy milk chocolate emerges to join the vanilla and burnt sugar hinted at in the nose. The mouthfeel is spot on, with a full, sturdy body that stops short of being syrupy. The carbonation is just enough to cut through all the malty goodness and let me know it's there, and I wouldn't want any more for it. English barleywines, and their barrel aged brethren, are some of my favorite beers, and Mother of All Storms is on of the best takes on the style I've had. 1,160 charactersaxeman9182, Mar 05, 2012

S: This is very oxidized, more than previous vintages have been. It has substantial cardboard and a general aroma of "nothingness," as if the beer is over-mellowed. 
T: I taste the bourbon, a bland sweetness, and cardboard. Yech. This is not a strong showing of a beer. It is one-dimensional and simple. To my credit, nearly everyone else at the tasting felt the same way. Finally! Validation! 
O: As noted in my comments below, I haven't been a fan of this beer from the 2009 vintage onward. But this one was especially off. I like barrel-aged barleywines, but something about this beer doesn't click with me. I turned down an offer from ramnuts to get the 2011s for me, and I'll do the same in the future. It's just not my beer. More for others... 
~~~
2009 vintage. A big thanks to Frank (ramnuts) for trucking these down to my house! 
A: Pours a very dark honey / amber body in the glass. Develops a decent light beige head with the pour; retention is decent for a barleywine of this ABV. Some lacing down the glass as I sip, but nothing that sticks. 
S: This beer REALLY needs to warm up. It produces aromas of bourbon, toffee, caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, wood, toasted pecans, and some booze. 
T: Like the nose, the beer is best when warm. Toasted pecans, bourbon, and toffee up front. The malts continue into a blend of caramel, and butterscotch, but they also develop rummy dark fruit flavors. Vanilla and chocolate are lightly present. It's surprisingly tannic in the finish, but that doesn't offset the molasses bomb that this beer is turning into. Each time I've had it, it has tasted sweeter and sweeter. 
M: Medium bodied, with low carbonation (very creamy). It used to be somewhat hot in the finish, but after about a year it has cooled off. The tannins have been more pronounced each time I've had this beer, and they create an astringency that is distracting. 
D: I hate to blaspheme, but I'm not blown away by this beer. I think it's solid but no more. I've had it a handful of times since it came out last year, and each time I am less and less taken with it. 2,151 charactersArbitrator, Mar 05, 2012

A: Pours a very dark tobacco brown with a quarter finger of cream colored head. Traces of lacing down the sides of the glass. I particularly love the dark colors of this brew and the sunburst effect around the edges.
S: Super complex nose with dark fruit, raisin, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, oak char, tobacco, leather, cherry, brown sugar. Thick, rich bourbon barrel notes provide some outstanding character here. It doesn't just hit all of the right notes, it absolutely destroys them. Perfect bouquet.
T: The initial flavors are chocolate and vanilla. As it washes across the mid, the caramel, raisin, and oak notes weigh in. It all comes together with ripe dark fruit, dark tobacco, and a nice little alcohol burn on the back end. I love very bit of this.
M: The mouthfeel and balance on this are top notch. It's amazing how much complexity Pelican has packed into this beer while keeping everything supremely balanced and smooth. Only deficiency is that carbonation seems a little bit high for the style. However, this one is silky smooth and decadent in all the right ways. 
O: The absolute standard for the English Barleywine style. A spectacular beer from start to finish, worthy of every accolade it has received. Thank you, Pelican, for this creation. 1,296 characterssiege06nd, Mar 04, 2012

2011 Release.
Pours a gorgeous rich mahogany color with some gorgeous ruby hints. Nice thin head with a tan to light tan color that is medium dense and recedes to a nice ring around the glass. Gorgeous beer.
Delicious aroma. Strong molasses notes and caramel but most importantly tons of Bourbon. Nice vanilla undertones as well as some nice woody spice. Nice dark fruits including raisin and prunes. Very nice slight chocolate notes are also perceived in the nose. 
Wow. This brew is amazing. It is so complex, big and flavorful. Starts off with some nice dark malt notes. Grainy and bready and then followed quickly by intense big and bold sweetness. Caramel and toffee with some nice Bourbon sweetness. VEry dark fruit notes are present. The middle has some nice intense boozy sweetness and more molasses and toffee notes with a nice heat in the back end of the brew. Having had King Henry not too long ago I can safely say that these two are very close in awesomeness. MoAS seems to be a bit more balanced and full bodied. Smooth as hell and very drinkable the ABV isn't too big of a hurdle which is a bit scary. Mouthfeel is awesome. Silky smooth and oily.
Very good brew. Amazing actually nice dark fruit notes with toffee and tons of Bourbon and sweetness that isn't too intense. This is a great brew. 1,359 charactersJoEBoBpr, Feb 29, 2012

Poured from a 22 oz. capped and gold foil-lined bottle (2011 Vintage) into a snifter glass.
A strong pour yields a 1 1/2-finger reddish brown head that completely dissipates in less than a minute. The body is a dark brown similar in color to the bottle it was poured from. Traces of bright crimson shine through when this beer is held to light. As the beer is consumed, a thin foam ring forms that leaves strings of lacing that quickly fall back down to the body.
The nose is dark, rich, and boozy. Strong aromas of bourbon-like alcohol impact the nostrils with each whiff. Once you get past the booze, aromas of oak, vanilla, and dark fruits do well to round out and complicate the news.
Like the nose, this beer starts out dark, sweet, and full of alcohol. Flavors of molasses, dark chocolate, and dried dark fruits all present themselves. As the beer is held in the mouth, alcohol stings the sides of the tongue. Upon swallowing, a warming alcohol envelops the entire tongue and is quickly greeted by flavors of oak, vanilla, caramel, raisins, and black currant. As these flavors taper off, an alcohol warmth emanates from the back of the throat. This beer reminds the drinker time and time again of its 13.5% ABV. However, this is welcome as the alcohol flavors add to the experience.
This beer is thick, and delightfully messy. The body is coating, syrupy, and quite sticky. The carbonation is subtle at best but is definitely doing a lot of work in the background. The mouthfeel is slick, sticky, and syrupy but matches the taste perfectly. 1,597 charactersoutput01x, Feb 27, 2012

A: Dark ruby, with a thin fizzy head that dissipates instantly.
S: Molasses, bourbon, and dark fruits. Very sweet, some alcohol noticeable.
T: Upfront, dark sweet fruits attack, with a very deep flavor. Mid-sip, strong bourbon overwhelms. The finish is of a dark fruit--barely good.
M: Medium bodied, with medium-high carbonation. Works well.
O: Rough, but the composite parts are excellent. The bourbon is a little too overwhelming. I hope with some age, the flavors will mellow slightly and come together. I'll save my second bomber for a year or two and re-review! 637 charactersHophead717, Feb 25, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Intense richness exudes from a beer of luxurious proportions that's aptly named the "Mother of all Storms". This is certainly a Barleywine for the ages.
Decanting with a tawny ruby and garnet hue, the beer exhibits bright clairty although with a mystic denseness that's so, so seductive. A surprisingly spritzy head rises to the top but mysteriously evaporates in quite fizzy fashion. Not that it's a big deal for these intensely alcoholic beers to degrade head formation and retention in favor of brandyish legging- but the fizzy way that the head disolves is odd for the style.
Strong malt aromas of molasses, chocolate, and toffee lead the way, but also with the tawny scent of vinous, bourbon, and brandy-like fruits. Complex to the bone, the beer's complementary notes include plumbs, dates, balsamic sherry, walnuts, berries, cherries, apples, and grapes.
As an extention of aromas, the flavor spread offers a similar variance but with an early focus on sweetness: toffee, chocolate, and molasses forms a robust taste that coats the mouth evenly and richly for a savory and lucious flavor. The mid palate introduces the estery notes of cherries, grapes, apples, and berries for added layers of complexity. Balance from bitter alcohols, vinous tartness, tobacco, sherry, balsamic (almost soy sauce savoryness)and tannic bourbony woods round out the sweeter notes and keep the beer from becomming one-dimensionally sweet. As the beer warms, more bourbon notes rise in the forms of vanilla, caramel, and coconut.
Calling the beer "full bodied" is an understatement. Heavy and masculine says it better, expecially with the fleeting carbonation that allows the beer to lay on the tongue and palate in a very dense and velvety coat. An extended finish of malty sweetness and moderate dryness from alcohol and woody tannins allows the enjoyment of the taste through an long lingering aftertaste. Expectations of Port wines should be expected from the mouthfeel of this beer.
With the focus on malt, malt, and more malt, I love the sherry, wine, and soy sauce-like savory notes that provide mild tartness to accompany the warm alchols and balance the beer. Beautifully invisioned and executed by the ever-classy Pelican Brewery!
An enjoyable beer with which to celebrate review #3,000. Thanks a bunch Hopluva1! 2,314 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 21, 2012

*December 2012 Edit*
*Much more balanced and mellow out of the gates this year. THIS is the beer I thought I was trading for last year. Sweet sticky caramel, toffee, vanilla, figs, and barrel (coconut) on the nose and taste. If only they didn't switch to stickers instead of painted labels...*
A- Pours a slick dark brown/black with not head to speak of. Leaves a sticky film on the glass along with some big legs.
S- Dark fruit, figs, raw woody notes, sweet caramel/vanilla and not much else. We both thought this was pretty subdued.
T- Sweet caramel, huge boozy hit--insanely hot, toasted barrel character, roasted notes, vanilla.
M- Nice and thick. Velvet-like with minimal carbonation but an insanely hot finish.
O- This is a really tasty BA barleywine, but with the huge amount of hype built up around it I thought it fell wayyy short...especially when directly compared to King Henry and BA Hi Fi. Hopefully some age can mellow out my other bottle. 1,069 charactersstxSS07, Feb 19, 2012

Glisteningly clear, sanguine ruby liquid, a frothy layer of tan foam across the top, leaving plenty of spotty lacing all around the edges. A lasting skim swirls on the surface like cirrus clouds. 
Pleasant aroma of dried dark fruits, vanilla, and brown sugar. Nutty and rich with some barrel traces around the edges, though fairly sweet like cotton candy.
Rich coating feel, viscous yet dry and not overly sweet. Big bourbon notes of brown sugar and vanilla, nutty malts, toffee, and spun sugar. Finish is pretty dry, and the abv is felt but doesn't seem close to what it is in reality. Masterfully aged, though a bit more depth would be nice. 721 charactersemerge077, Feb 18, 2012

Pours a transparent hazel color, only a slight bit of foam exists in the glass as it is brought to me, but I don't there was much to begin with considering the 13.5% ABV. Smell is of raisins, dark fruit, alcohol, smooth vanilla and caramel smell. The smell is really potent, I didn't really swirl the beer at first, and it didn't have much head but it was still very aeromatic. The taste resides in the same vein as
The smell, once again one of the most potent flavor was that of raisins/dark fruit. I let my glass warm for a good bit before I drank it, so it may have different notes when onsumes colder. I also get some notes of bourbon. This was still really hot, I'd like to get a bottle of this age for a while then try it in two years once it has mellowed. While it was very aggressive when I tried it, I thing it would come out very smoothly with some age. Mouthfeel id relatively thick, with mild carbonation. If you enjoy a boozy beer and you like those sweet dark fruit notes, give this a try. 1,054 charactersgkunkle, Feb 17, 2012

This is the brewery’s Stormwatchers Winterfest 2010 aged in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. Pours brown reddish hue with off-white medium head that dissipates to thin but a livery lace that lasts throughout. Gosh, I can smell the barley wine without bringing it close to my nose. Dark fruits, vanilla, and caramel in the nose. Light bourbon is detected. Flavors of dark cherries and oak vanilla. Bit of a bitter back finish. The bourbon brings out in it’s own quite smoothly. There is some toffee picked up late along with caramel. Good carbonation; sticky medium mouthfeel. A very well-made barley wine! 691 charactersCuriousMonk, Feb 15, 2012

Pours a clear, mahogany with a short, light tan head that quickly dissipates to some small bubbles at the edge due to light carbonation.
The smell is complex with oak, deep dark fruit aromas and a little alcohol (bourbon).
There's a lot happening here; There is a lot of malt character, a hint of vanilla, the dark fruits show up nicely here, oak and bourbon. The alcohol is mostly hidden in my bottle but it is a very warming beer.
Mouthfeel is fairly full with very low carbonation. Most everything in the taste lingers in the mouth after swallowing.
Overall: This is a delicious and complex beer, one that lots of other barleywines should try to emulate. It's a really good beer. 722 charactersmeatyard, Feb 14, 2012

2011 VINTAGE- 22oz. foiled and capped bottle at about fridge temp, poured into a boulevard tulip. shared with trxxpaxxs.
pours out a dark ruby, mahghony red color, almost appears black from a distance, with about one fingers worth of light tan colored head that eventually faded to a foamy ring. no real lacing to speak of. 
intial aromas of grainy oak, then some big doses of nuts and a little bit of some dark fruits. some light roasted almonds, pecans, and cashews. a little bit of vanilla oak and hints of smooth bourbon, more as it warms. 
again, lots of figgy like dark fruits and cashew and roasted almond nuttiness. some sweetness with a bit of molasses and brown sugar. vanilla with just a touch of oak and bourbon, but the booze is masked nicely. 
sticky, with almost a syrupiness to it, all in a good way of course. heavy bodied with lots of good sweetness. 
quite an exceptional BA barleywine, among the best ive ever tasted. nuts and dark fruits kind of take center stage while the bourbon barrel seems very well integrated with the rest of the flavors. this kind of reminds me of hebrew 15:15 combined with founders- backwoods bastard. i cant wait to see what wonders age will do to my remaining bottle. 1,274 charactersdogfishandi, Feb 12, 2012

A: Pours out a super dark mahogany red with a thin khaki colored head. There isn't much lacing to speak of, but the color is exceptional.
S: The nose is sweet, buttery, bourbon, vanilla/oak, a touch of seaweed, and some booze. It's a 13.5% beer and it reminds you right off the bat. It's an interesting mix that is extremely pleasant.
T: The initial hit is seaweed and booze. But that transitions to some really nutty and fruity notes. These flavors come as a shock considering I didn't pull any fruity notes out in the nose. It almost has a raspberry and cashew mix to it. The finish is sweet and mellow. The alcohol fades in the finish, which I really appreciate.
M: Full bodied beer. The flavors are silky and smooth. Everything coats the palate and lingers nicely. It's thick and chewy but not overly cloying.
O: Fantastic. This is one of the best BA Barleywines that I've ever had. The fruity and nutty characteristics were unexpected but very enjoyable and the barrel aged on this beer was done to perfection. It's just right. 1,105 characterstrxxpaxxs, Feb 11, 2012

- Sticky and sweet brew with a full body, and pleasant carbonation. Certainly what I think such a heavy English Barleywine ought to be like.. not bad.

The Perfect Storm comes in the glass looking a very dark shaded brown with sprays of mahagony towards the sides. Nice dark beige foam sits on top with nice retention, no sticks though. 
Smell is in your face bourbon. The aroma is very strong and it hits you. The bourbon is big, some vanilla/oak notes with dark fruits, mollasses, etc. Some sweet caramel with warming and some booze.
With some time on this bottle, the heat is there. The alcohol is noted and blends into the bourbon and malty base well. Heat, bourbon, into some oaky territory with the usual vanilla. Some dark fruit comes into play with warming.
Feel is big and approaching thick. The carb is there, yet not overbearing. A nice amount of heat creeps up on the tounge, especially with warming, but there is so much flavor to go along with it.
All in all, this is one of the better English Barleywines I've had from America. I could imagine this vintage was super hot when 1st out. For my 1st time having it, this is nice stuff. 1,067 charactersBARFLYB, Jan 29, 2012

The beer pours a dark reddish brown with a tan head about a finger thick that quickly fades to a thin ring and patchy lacing. The first aroma that I pick up on is oak and bourbon followed by toffee, caramel, dates, and raisins, with just a noticeable alcoholic smell. Despite the alcohol aroma the finish is barely noticeable. The taste is best described as a combination of dark fruit, a hint or chocolate, fresh oak, bourbon and molasses. The mouthfeel is chewy with low carbonation. This is a spectacular beer and one that I would definitely seek out again. 626 charactersjamescain, Jan 25, 2012

2011 vintage.
Pours a clear dark brown with a khaki head that settles to a thin film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, toasted coconut, bourbon, and wood. Taste is the same with the bourbon flavor sticking around as the aftertaste. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a light crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good barleywine and the bourbon barrel aging is very nice on this beer. 551 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 23, 2012

2010 Vintage
From notes. Thanks to exitmusic00 (I think) for contributing this to our tasting.
A: Dark caramel/tan. Single (creamy white) fingernail head on soft, gentle pour.
S: Burnt fig, caramel, oak, bourbon, vanilla and loads of malt sweetness. Hint of booze coming off the nose, but very inviting.
T: Loads of caramel sweetness up-front followed by a combination of dark fruit, bourbon, and vanilla. Hint of spice towards the tail-end along with oakiness. 
M: Full bodied with medium carbonation.
O: Well put together and definitely worth seeking out. I think this beer can be enjoyed now or cellared for many years to come. 668 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 22, 2012

A- Dark red brown with a nice tan head, about a finger for the beer style. Creamy pillow stays around atop the ale. Spotty lace sticks to the glass.
S- Deep strong caramel and vanilla over an awesome toasty oak barrel whiskey note. Some roast, raisin and slight alcohol.
T- A great, fairly mellowed out blend, nothing really jumps out intensely. Balance of charred oak, deep caramel sweets, vanilla, peppercorn spice, raisins, dark fruit cherries, whiskey and slight alcohol.
MF- Silky thick oily body with low smooth carbonation. Fairly warm feel rounds it out quite nicely.
Awesome balance of flavor. Once I'm done with King Henry the scores will come through, what is the true king of bourbon barley wines. Can't compare them in retrospect. A truly balanced master craft. 824 characterscbutova, Jan 16, 2012

Pours dark reddish-brown, mostly translucent. Tan head quickly turns to a ring, understandable for the beer.
Nice scent, lots of dark fruit (cherries, red grapes), bourbon, caramel. Lots of goodness without being too bourbon heavy.
Taste is actually an improvement over the smell. Big dark fruits, flavorful+mellow bourbon, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, decent hop presence, a bit of vanilla and alcohol. Standout balance with a perfect amount of bourbon vs. barleywine.
Nicely hidden ABV, carbonation is a bit high, maybe a bit thin, but not bad.
Great beer, but not mind-blowing for me. Really nice level of bourbon presence, lets the barleywine really shine through. 816 charactersChico1985, Jan 15, 2012

4.17/5  rDev -5.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42011 bottle, opened 01/2012. From South Sound tasting notes:
Poured a deep brown with a thin film of eggshell head. Big aroma with bourbon, vanilla, sugar cookie, and caramel.
Moderate-to-high carbonation and a full, creamy mouthfeel. On the sweeter side with lots of toffee up front, but there's a nice balance with notes of bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, and boozy warmth. The finish seemed a little "off" with a vague chalky quality or something else that I couldn't pin down.
This was really tasty and I'm glad I got to try it, but it didn't quite live up to the hype. 574 charactersgrittybrews, Jan 15, 2012

2011 Vintage, I prefer to try a beer fresh before aged anyways. There's no longer an upkeep of full info in the notes section, but it appears that 10yr old Evan Williams barrels are used to age a 1yr aged base barleywine. Sounds like a great combo as I open my first bottle of Mother of All Storms.
From the moment I remove the bottle cap I am greeted with the heavenly aroma of aged bourbon. Always a good sign. Poured into a snifter. Through the pour I can see a beer that has nice clarity for being barrel aged, and it is a dark caramelized sugar color. Collected in the glass, it is nearly black unless held to direct light, in which case hues of ruby shine through beautifully.
The head is quite small, and I was pouring as roughly as I dared. A short cap of butter cream colored foam slowly cascades upward and a ring of bubbles replenish the ring of receded head throughout the life of my first glass. Signs of very good carbonation.
The aroma is easily the best aspect of this beer. Mother of all Storms showcases a beer and a bourbon that expertly compliment each other. Flavors of caramel, char, chocolate, and toffee are likely thanks to both elements. Aged oak and lovely vanilla are certainly products of the barreling. In short, this is an aroma that is sweet and balanced - exhibiting all of the qualities that one looks for in a fine bourbon without the nuisance of extreme booziness.
This said, I have sampled a few vintages of Evan Williams Bourbon on the rocks in the past and can say that it is an extremely smooth bourbon on its own - this was a wise choice on behalf of The Pelican Pub and Brewery.
As I dig in for my first taste, I am subconsciously compelled to close my eyes and allow the beer to linger on my palate. A chill of pleasure rings down my spine, and I am taken back to memories of Kuhnhenn BB Barleywine and 4D and Boulevard Rye on Rye. I know that not all of these beers are the same style, but all are similar examples of brews that should be the benchmark of their style, with few to no flaws.
The flavor is every bit as complex as the aroma, with additional nuance. The rich caramel sweetness and lovely soft chocolate and vanilla are right there. But there is also a nice fruitiness present as well - black raisin and plum add dimension. The base barleywine is still asserting itself - a sturdy bitterness makes itself known after the initial shock of bourbon character wears off.
The mouthfeel is full bodied, almost thick, with low but lively carbonation. The alcohol is very warm, and at times the biggest flaw of the beer, though it also helps to remind us to sip and savor this beer rather than quaff it the way the aroma and flavor urge us to do. Once room temperature the booziness grows, making me all the more certain that I need to try an aged bottle of this beer.
Overall - this is worth every penny, and every ounce of praise. I can't wait to try this again sometime with some age on it - it will only get better, I am sure of that. 3,043 charactersSpider889, Jan 14, 2012

S - YUM! Malty, sugary, and caramel-y. Lots of heat too! Some raisin or plum along with slight spiced vanilla. Wicked rum kick! Pretty smooth for what it feels and tastes like... 
T/M - Perfect carbonation and low heat taste for the age and ABV. all things considered, a perfect mouthfeel. Light bodied with tons of great in depth flavor. Super grape and rum. Lots of nice spice and vanilla.

A: Deep dark mahogany. Half a finger of head that disappears quickly leaving no lacing just a thick syrup.
S: Bourbon is nicely evident, but not overpowering. The smells that come in around the bourbon are burnt sugar, vanilla, wood, leather. Alcoholic bite is strong.
T: Starts strong with sweet burnt caramel and toffee. There's a light sweetness hiding somewhere in there. This is followed by the sharpness of the bourbon with figs and a few dark fruits like dried cherries. Aftertaste is the burnt sugar bitterness. Warming, but not overly so. Holy shit this thing is like a kick of sweet bourbon right in the kisser.
M: Perhaps the thickest and fullest body I've had yet. Like caramel velvet. My lips were sticky from the beer that passed through and dried.
O: This beer comes kicking out of the stables, no holds are barred. It's right there, gigantic and in your face. The caramel and bourbon is unapologetic and it works. Beautiful executed. 966 characterscmadd, Jan 08, 2012

A - Dar ruby in color, nice head turns into a little bit more than lacing. Looks very nice, follows the style well. Sticks a little to the side of the glass.
S - Sweet malts, oak, caramel and toffee. Smells VERY nice.
T - Caramel, toffee, oak and a slight amount of heat towards the end. Toffee lingers in the finish. The flavor changes quite a bit through each taste, it is quite complex. 
M - Medium body with medium corbonation. Makes it more drinkable than if it were thicker, but to each his own.
O - This is a great beer. I think the freshness is what kept the score down a little bit. I imagine that some time would do a lot of nice things. 782 charactersclaaark13, Jan 06, 2012

The plan all along being to consider it during a Christmas celebration...this one just happens to be the BEST CHRISTMAS I'VE EVER HAD!!
Poured a somewhat lifeless hazy mahogany darkness that really intrigues me. My expectations are already abandoned. No collar, no visible indication of texture, but the DARKNESS is scoring points at the moment.
The smell is aggressive and quite unique. First a blast of vanilla bourbon followed by a staunch toffee caramel character. Expressive roasted malty notes. Very Nice.
The roasted toffee flavor is true to the nose. The mouth texture is very heavy and creamy SMOOTH and compliments the taste really nicely. The aftertaste lingers much longer than anticipated and REALLY adds a lot to the overall experience. 
SCORE!!! Very well done!!! Once my most appreciated style of beer, this barleywine is taking me back to the complex characteristics that I admire most in memorable ales. I highly recommend it. Actually...now that I think about it...this is ONE OF THE BEST beers that i've considered in 2011. 1,166 charactersjjayjaye, Dec 26, 2011

A- Pours a very deep garnet/mahogany color. Thin brownish head subsides very quickly to a ring. Plenty of alcohol visible on the glass.
S- Caramel, vanilla, bourbon, sweet syrup. Dark fruits abound. Alcohol noticeable but not overbearing.
T- Bourbon hits immediately but is enveloped by burnt caramel and sweet syrupy dark fruits. A bit of alcohol in the back. Vanilla and oak. The flavors are hanging on for days.
M- Thick and smooth. It's almost like drinking very delicious cough syrup, meant in the best way possible. Moderate carbonation is enough to keep it from being cloying but lets the flavors linger. Alcohol burn is nice and warming.
O- This is one of the best barleywines/barrel-aged beers I've ever had. Immensely big and complex. Definitely a sipper, though. 841 charactersmikehblack, Dec 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a dark burgundy color with very nice carbonation and a thin tannish green head that eventually subsides to a thin lacing ring.
S - Big nose with a healthy dose of vanilla, toasted toffee, oak, bourbon, and slight traces of maple. The nose is sweet and for the strength, while boozy, it's not obnoxiously so.
T - Slightly medicinal, boozy, and sweet. Bourbon takes the front seat immediately and doesn't let go, dominating throughout. Fairly heavy oaky wood flavors, roasted toffee/caramel, toasted brown sugar, and bourbon with some dark fruitiness added in. Everything blends together very nicely without being cloyingly sweet. There's a substantial boozy effervescence during and after the sip.
M - Thick, full bodied, syrupy, and leaves a massive sticky coating of sugar on the lips. The mouth is filled with oak and bourbon for a lingering and sweet finish.
O - This is a very bold barley wine, next time, I will most likely split the bottle as it is a little intense to drink all 22 oz in one sitting! Bottom line, this is an awesome beer and well worth it if you're lucky enough to get some. 1,111 charactersjzeilinger, Dec 25, 2011

A: Poured a deep brown/almost burgundy color with a very thin, one finger khaki colored head. KH and MoAS appear very similar. The ring at the edge of the glass dissipates quicker than the KH did. There is more of a reddish hue to the MoAS. As the beer warms, there is a brilliant coating that lasts on the glass, with some real tight legs. Brilliant. Slow moving, thin, viscous. 
N: Some slight metallic notes bookend a big caramel, vanilla, and bourbon body. The oak is very apparent, in a good way. The metallic sensation eventually reveals itself to be some nice and mild English hops. 
T: Big hop presence provides some nice bitterness, backs up a big raisin body, sweet malt, bourbon, and some vanilla. The alcohol is fairly well hidden. 
M: The body in this beer is massive. It doesn't look as big as it is once it fills your mouth. Great carbonation level to hold up this beer. Really fantastic. Awesome creamy texture, with a good amount of crisp dryness to balance. 
D and O: Well, this is my second bottle of the 2011 MoAS. Extremely pleased. It's a truly great beer. Has alot of personality, and I feel like it's true to style. Great drying qualities, with a huge body, full of flavor. A really nice treat. 1,317 charactersMarcatGSB, Dec 25, 2011

A - Pours an inch of tan head into a tulip glass. The head fizzles away quickly with little to no lace. The beer has a dark licorice color to it, a combination of blacks and browns.
S - The nose is a wonderful mix of bourbon, vanilla, and sweet malts. The alcohol isn't too in your face which is surprising for the abv content of this beer.
M - Full in body with mild carbonation. There is a bit of a syrupy feel which isn't at all surprising for the style and abv.
T - Big sweet malts greet the taste buds first. It's followed by toffee, and hints of dark fruit. Vanilla and bourbon shows up next in just the right amounts. It finishes with oak tannins and a smooth alcohol burn.
Masterly crafted. It has just the right amount of barrel flavor without being overwhelmingly alcoholic. Perfect brew for this Christmas eve. 839 charactersboralyl, Dec 25, 2011

Pours a caramel copper color with some slight reddish hues when the light hits it. Thinner beige head dissipates into a filmy collar and some spotty lacing. 
Bourbon and vanilla notes in the nose with oaky tannins. Earthy and robust with a thick malty character and toffee. Some hints of raisin and dark fruit. Boozy and sweet. 
Big and burly up front with a caramel and toffee attack. Light touches of pine hops and sticky sweetness. Oaky bourbon tones with vanilla and burnt sugar. Definitely an earthy feel to the backbone, which continues with bread crust, caramel, and brown sugar. Finishes with another wave of oaky booze. 
Full body, decent carbonation, sticky, lingering and chewy on the palate. Holy crap this is a big beer - insanely delicious and satisfying but a definite sipper. I've had the 09 before and I think this was better. 900 charactersxnicknj, Dec 23, 2011

T- sweet toffee and caramel, dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and I get some sort of tobacco or earthy characteristic as well.
M- full bodied but not real syrupy. Abv is noticeable but not too hot, and it leaves you with a slightly dry mouth but you still beg for more.

Pours a dark brown color with a really nice one finger cocoa head. Amazing head for a 13.5% beer. Good lacing on the side of my tulip glass. I get toffee, bourbon, coffee, vanilla, caramel, and some alcohol in the nose. Really balanced, and just about perfect nose. The taste is outstanding! The same profile as the nose, except better. Very balanced, and smooth, and amazingly drinkable. Feel is medium full with a tiny bit of dryness, and a smooth/bitter finish. Overall, this is a world class English Barleywine.

A: Pours a medium coffee color, slight reddish tint, with oddly large, sand colored bubbles which in any case disappear to a ring rather quickly. No lacing and some retention. Too dark to see with a full pour, this is basically clear, like a dark bourbon color, which only becomes evident as your glass nears empty.
S: Barrel characteristics up front (loads of cinnamon, oak), sweet caramel and toffee, smooth bourbon, and dark fruit. Smells wonderful with nice complexity. A little alcohol burn is perceptible as it warms.
T: Caramel malt, fruit, bourbon and oak, long kind of milk chocolate finish. Quite rich, definitely a sipper. More bourbon comes through as it warms to cellar temperature. 
M: Full bodied and medium-light carbonation. Warming, but not much alcohol noticeable.
O: Delicious, top class English-style barleywine. I've never had a barleywine with so much cinnamon from the oak, but it works with the other flavors. 966 characterspmarlowe, Dec 15, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage. Really excited to try this. Thanks Jordan for the in person hook up! Cheers brother!
A: Medium viscosity, deep dark color with minimal head. An aggressive pour kicked up a nice light tan colored head and when held up to the light you can see this thing is damn near clear and would be if it weren't for it's dark color. It's not brown however, but more of a deep dark ruby or garnet. Really stunning. Head is disappears after a few minutes leaving a perfectly still surface. No lacing. Not surprising for a barrel aged beer and better than other examples I've had.
S: Lots of malt character here. Very complex. Lots of sweet malt in the form of caramel and toffee mixed with some sherry like vinous notes. Slight alcohol on the nose but for something so high gravity it's extremely well masked. Bourbon is very subtle also but clearly playing it's part. Some dark fruits essence here, perhaps some prunes and fig. Hop bitterness is undetectable.
T&M: Taste follows the nose (love it when that happens). Sweet malt character, some toasted caramel, dark fruits, sherry like vinous notes, followed by some throat warming booziness. Mouthfeel is big and luscious. Carbonation is medium. Some slight harsh alcohols on the finish, but I think that would clear up over time. This is a relatively new bottle.
O: One pretty damn good barleywine and relatively local to me too (even though it was a bitch to get a hold of!). Great barrel aging on this one, it's not over the top but you know it's there which in my book is the mark of a great barrel aged beer. Color is really nice and wish I had seen it in daylight. The dark crystal clear garnet hues look amazing! The aroma and taste share many similarities and this is deceptively drinkable. You will not be disappointed! Is it worth the price? To try for the first time: yes. To buy a case of? I'm not sure...you be the judge of that :) 1,899 charactersjulian, Dec 13, 2011

A: Pours a rich brown color with dark amber notes. Thin tan head disappears quickly, leaving a flat coca-cola appearance. Oh, looks can be deceiving!
S: Wonderful, beautiful bourbon shines through. Woody, vanilla, with hints of toffee, caramel or molasses. Some booziness, but not distracting. Just inviting.
T: More bourbon continues to shine. Similar to smell, lots of oak, vanilla, caramel, smooth malty sweetness. Followed by more bourbon. 
M: Rich, perfectly balanced with just enough carbonation. Gently warmness. Fresh, this is amazingly smooth and tastes more like a 8.5 rather than 13.5% beer.
D/O: Amazing. Love this beer, all the way around. Wish it wasn't quite so expensive though. 786 charactersoregonskibum, Dec 10, 2011

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 Vintage.
Appearance – Pours into a tulip with a dark brown color that turns to deep mahogany when held up to the light. About a finger of tan, almost mocha colored head is achieved with a moderate pour that dissipates at a moderate pace leaving slight lacing on the sides of the glass.
Smell – Oh wow, heavy bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Sweet candied aromas mixed with molasses and burnt brown sugar. Smells quite rich and some toffee shines through as the beer warms.
Taste – Quite bourbon and vanilla forward. The oak takes a slight backseat to the more prominent flavors of dark fruits and candied sugars. Slight alcohol flavor and burn, though nothing what I was expecting for the ABV and how “young” this beer is.
Mouthfeel – Full bodied, very creamy, lower carbonation. One of the highlights of this beer in my opinion.
Overall – A delicious barleywine. I can’t wait to see how this ages. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden, and after the first few sips you don’t so much taste it as feel it. Not sure what I was thinking when I opened this by myself tonight. Looks like I’ll be nursing this the next couple of hours. A very nice sipper on this cold Midwest night. 1,203 charactersSpdKilz, Dec 09, 2011

poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: murky brown bodied beer with a whiteish tan colored cap of head that goes around the outside of the glass.
Smell: Malts, Oak and vanilla. All barrel notes and all malts. This beer is assertive!
Taste: Very malty and very bourbon barrel forward. This beer is just aggressive and on a cold winter night I have been wanting a substantial beer just like this! Tons of caramel sweetness and candied fruits. Mild toffee notes and lots of vanilla complimented by moderate oak notes.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with low carbonation. It is a syrupy beer and I think it just needs some time in a cellar. Its really nice, but has some decent boozey heat. A little time to mellow will make this beer amazing. 
Overall: Really enjoyed this beer and look forward to tring it when it is a year or two down the line! It will only get better and it is already fantastic! 944 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Dec 07, 2011

S- Nose is all bourbon barrel, woo!
T- Sticky caramel sweetness. Bourbon heat is there and well tolerable. No way this is 13.5%abv, alcohol is *very* well hidden.
M- Full, smooth mouthfeel. Carbonation comes in on the end of each sip.
D/O- One of the best beers I've had in the last few months. Insanely drinkable given the ABV. Pleasure to try. What a nice surprise on a Tuesday night, thanks TATURBO!!! 512 charactersDuff27, Dec 07, 2011

Appearace: Gentle pour into SA perfect pint. Dark ruby brown. Minimal head, some wispy swirls from nucleation point float on top of the liquid.
Smell: Bourbon, toffee, caramel. The nose is potent, and I like it.
Taste: Bourbon, malt, sweet fruit, brown sugar, caramel, alcohol. There is so much going on here, and the taste is sublime. Heavenly.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, moderately carbed, and very nice. You can't really hide 13.5%, but while the alcohol was there, it wasn't offensively so. 
Drinkability: Split with a friend! But, it's good enough that I wouldn't blame you for drinking it all yourself.
Overall: There is really not much fault to be found with this guy. Not only an awesome beer, but easily the best barrel aged barleywine I've ever had. I can't wait to try the 2011 fresh. 888 characterscbeer88, Nov 27, 2011

A: Pours a deep dark chestnut, clear when held to light with a short tan head that dissipates into a collar rather quickly and leaves very little lacing around glass.
S: Very rich with toffee, oak, vanilla, dark malts and bourbon. Plenty of alcohol reminds you how big this beer is. Like most beers of this size the alcohol definitely becomes much more pronounced as the beer warms.
T: Dangerously rich and flavorful with wave after wave of malt, dark fruit, oak, vanilla and toffee. Alcohol is definitely present but quite mellow with very little heat for how young this is. Loaded with malty sweetness but very well balanced from the barrel aging and some hop bitterness. Little to no hop flavor to get in the way of all the malty bourbony goodness. Incredibly smooth oaky finish with some vanilla and more malt. Long lingering flavors tease me to take yet another sip.
M: Extremely rich, smooth and creamy full bodied with low-moderate carbonation and sweet finish.
O: In my opinion this is the barleywine that all others should be judged against. So rich, flavorful and ridiculously drinkable for the 13.5% ABV. Perfect winter sipping beer warms you from the inside out. Without a doubt this is a world class barleywine. 1,283 charactersAzurescens, Nov 21, 2011

A. Murky,muddy brown body. No head to speak of,just some large bubbles. Big alchohol legs.No lacing as expected.
S. Bourbon hits first,not a blast but strong presence. Followed by sweet fruits kind of apricot. Then you get leather, toffee. Damn good!
T. Wow! Great barell treatment, First thing that you get is a perfect amount of bourbon,it's not overwhelming in any way. Then you get the ripe fruits and leather,brown sugar,toffee,caramal. A touch of alchohol in the end,very well hidden.
M. Feel is thick and heavy,just right. Nice sweet aftertaste that lingers.
 Overall So far this is the BA barleywine to measure all too. I have to get more. Just a excellently crafted beer!!! 781 charactersMarty30, Nov 20, 2011

Anywho, a rich brown, leather like pour. Off tan head billowed up nicely. Lacing is a touch thin. Looks delish
Aroma is hot at first, singeing some nose hair. Underneath that are whaffs of caramel, vanilla, cocoa, leather and sweet orchard fruit.
Yeah, it's a bit hot. Flavors cover it up. Caramel apple, chocolate, vanilla, wet leather. Rich flavors like a good old ale. It seems there's a fight between the wood tannins and the hops for pucker-power. Moderate amount of each, nothing outstanding. With the malt and other rich, sweet flavors, the puckering serves as a cleanser of sorts. That and the alcohol. 
A sipping beer to be sure. Nice dessert beer methinks. 810 charactersMebuzzard, Nov 03, 2011
4.29/5  rDev -2.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Kind of a muddled brown appearance to it, almost nothing in the way of head. Beautiful mahogany and bourbon aroma with no heat, very immaculate smell, plenty of vanilla.
Taste, bourbon heavy, very low hopping, good mouthfeel carbonation wise, something that wasn't apparent from the appearance. Good amount of toffee to it, caramel to a lesser extent. Mild wood tannin in the mouthfeel, nice vanilla meld with it. 
The last beer of the barleywine cabin fest, you chumps should have stayed up later, I couldn't finish the bottle (but came so close).
Probably not as good as Abacus (the standard), this one, if there is a complaint, was just a tad too dominate by the bourbon. But yet, it wasn't hot for 13.5% so what can ya do? 729 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Nov 02, 2011

Appearance: Pours a mahogany color with hardly any head at all. The head goes away completely almost right away.
Smell: Very sweet with vanilla, toffee, dark fruit and some warm booze.
Taste: This is a really nice and complex barleywine. Sweet toffee, bourbon, vanilla, and dark fruit all show up. The finish has a slight bitterness to it along with some warm alcohol.
Mouthfeel: The body is on the thicker side and mildly sticky. The carbonation is mild and the finish is a bit slick.
Overall: A very tasty beer, but I wasn't as blown away as I expected to be. Great depth of flavors and I will seek it out again, but I do think I have had some barleywines I enjoy just a bit more. 824 charactersoline73, Oct 24, 2011

This beer pours a nice reddish brown color with a thin but present head. the smell is a big sweet bourbony nose with hints of caramel oak and vanilla. the taste follows the smell with a bit of a burn in the finish, i think aging for a few years would definitely help this beer out. the burn was the only think i could find to deduct for. i think at a 2-3 year mark this beer would be a 5 the mouthfeel is very full and overall and amazing brew. 557 charactersrowingbrewer, Oct 22, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks GregSVT for sharing! Poured from a bomber into a big brandy snifter. 
Pours a mahogany, dark brownish color that has lighter edges. A tan ring of head is present and then dies rather quickly. 
There's a huge smell of charred oak. The bourbon hits you hard! There is also vanilla, caramel, roasted malt, and dark fruit. 
Taste is more balanced than the nose. While bourbon is still certainly present, the vanilla and dark fruit really come out to shine. The booziness is apparent as well, but not in a bad way. 
It feels creamy and smooth. It isn't exceptionally drinkable, but neither does it try to be. It is sharp and intense.
This is my favorite barleywine, ousting Abacus. The smell and taste are complex and amazing. Get your hands on this if you can! 768 charactersfatmcb1, Oct 20, 2011

2010 vintage.
Pours a very dark cherry with a thin, bubbly toffee colored head.
The aroma consists of bourbon, vanilla, oak and caramel. Perhaps some dark fruit notes as well.
The taste follows the nose, with a blend of caramel and dark fruit with oaky bourbon and vanilla. Just a bit of heat from the alcohol comes through in the finish.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. The alcohol heat gives a pleasant warming sensation.
A really enjoyable barleywine with very well integrated bourbon barrel aging. Definitely deserving of the high praises it receives. 612 charactersvkv822, Oct 02, 2011

Appearance: Mother of All Storms pours a ruby brown color with a fast fading tan cap. No real lacing is left on the glass.
Smell: There is a good amount of booze in the aroma. Caramel, smooth malts, toffee, oak, and vanilla.
Taste: Boozy, yet very smooth and tasty. The malt presence is strong but not overwhelming. The sweetness starts firm, but fades through the sip. Caramel and toffee work well with bourbon, vanilla, and oak contribute to a complex flavor. The finish is slightly sweet.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and lightly carbonated. The alcohol is more noticeable in the throat and stomach than in the flavor. The tongue tingles as well from the strong flavor and booziness.
Overall: A boozy delight. It makes no attempt to hide its identity - thick, sweet, boozy, and delicious. 924 charactersKickInTheChalice, Sep 28, 2011

Aromas are much less boozy than I remember from the aged bottled. Lots of dark prunes, toffee, dark bakers cocoa and molasses (almost leather). Some oak and alcohol heat emerge as it warms.
The tastes has lots of dark and milk chocolate, with emerging coconut bourbon and a little vanilla. A huge base of toffee and brown sugar. Finish is semi sweet and slick with ample sugar and oak coating your palate. Bitter molasses and some sweet maple also emerge as it warms. 
Overall I think think version is more refined than the original, maybe the refined the base beer or improved or altered their barrel aging but this example is much better than I remembered. Still a beast and should be shared; just a monster flavor wise.
2008 bottle courtesy of hoppymcgee. Still says The Perfect Storm on the label (original name). 
Pours a viscous dark, dark brown with a small khaki head that recedes rapidly leaving adequate lacing.
Aromas begin with a decent amount of alcohol surprisingly even after 3-ish years of cellaring. I also get some chocolate and the usual barely wine smells of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and dark fruit are there as well, along with some oak. But the booze is quite apparent here.
The tastes follow the nose of this monster. The booze can't hide amongst the excessive malts. Flavors of toffee and molasses, paired with some chocolate, and a boat ton of Evan Williams bourbon. Very thick, I feel like I should be chewing what is in my glass. This must have been a fresh barrel because it is very prevalent. Not overly offensive, just a really big beer and I am glad I only had a small sample.
The mouthfeel very nice and smooth, despite the alcohol bite in the finish. The carbonation is quite low and the body is quite full but not the fullest I have ever had and I wouldn't classify it as chewy by any means.
Overall this despite being 13.5% alcohol, it is surprisingly drinkable in small quantities. Definitely a sharing beer to be sipped and savored and a good one to contemplate the world with, if that makes any sense. I wonder if newer versions are equally as strong or if they are toned down a little. Glad I have two to find out down the road. 2,208 charactersclaspada, Aug 13, 2011

A-Thick, dark, brown with almost a purple hue to it. Very thin cocoa head which fades quickly. 
S-Toffee, cocoa, molasses, earthy fruitiness.
T-Lots of bourbon in this one. Bourbon more or less overpowers everything but it is also very sweet. Some fig and lots of chewy toffee flavors. Little bit of chocolate in here as well.
M-Very little carbonation and this one does pack a bite. I feel that if there was just a bit more carbonation it would not feel so thick.
O-This was a great beer, a real sipper. The bourbon flavor was very nice and it was almost like you are chewing thick bourbon than drinking a beer. My only complaint with some BBBWs is that they just don't have enough carbonation. I would drink this again but I am mostly glad to have ticked it off of my list. 810 charactersbeerhan, Aug 09, 2011

A: There is an almost bourbon note to it. A mild agitation evidences a some small bubbles but it is clear that this beer is above you, much in the way that Hemingway never seemed to mind the banalities of a normal life. You rock it back and forth and all you see is a wafty character that coats with a scary liquid refusal.
S: There are deep bourbon notes that resound like falling down a mineshaft and hit every peat note on the way down. I don’t want to overstate the wood and bourbon but, wow, this is beer but it feels like a proper gentleman’s drink. This was made in Oregon but its spirit takes its summer vacations in the hateful south. It enjoys conifers in the summer and spraying down protesting hops with fire hoses in the winter. Too far? Ok, let’s stop turning barley wines into social commentary. This has a great heat on it and I don’t even want to age it because I like it for it’s bumbly angry presence. It rounds out this delicious dinner party with a fuck up that you can point out that is incredibly enjoyable.
T: There is a huge panoply of raisins, figs, mild dates and nice waftiness just like envelops like sweet caramel candy. I enjoy this immensely and the retraction from the huge fruits on the finish makes it all the more enjoyable, wait for it
M: AS A RESULT THIS IS THE BEST BARLEYWINE THAT I HAVE EVER HAD. I know I know, this dethroned Abacus, no big deal, you hate Barleywines. Wait a second though, I like the following LESS: Hellshire, Old Dipsea 2009, Bigfoot, etc. This is hands down the most balanced and amazing barley wine I have ever had. I just want to sip on this and watch a Ryan Reynol- CLINT EASTWOOD MOVIE.
D: This is not exceptionally drinkable and, you know what? GOOD. This isn’t here for your consumption, this is like a Terrence Malick movie, it is deliberate, slow, deep and amazing. If you drink this alone you are a jerk. Plain and simple. This has such a great resounding spirit to it that begs to be split on a balcony and horrible philosophy discussions will ensure. It is just wafty, boozy, complex and amazing. The thin mouth almost makes me feel like “give me a cigar.” But then I realized that I don’t live in the gilded age, so put out the robusto Grover Cleveland.
Narrative: All of the brackish land lovers said that this take was too ambitious. Sure, there was a school of marlin right off the coast heading for warmer currents, but, for gods sake, did you look at the meterology reports? They didn’t want to end up like the crew of the S.S. Stone Tea, rest in peace, who lost every member in this modern age refusing to deliver tea by protocol. No; no. There was a much more insidious secret that no crew member beyond the first mate could be made aware of. This marlin galleon was commanded by none other than a pelican. To be fair, he was a completely able captain with a curse placed upon him by a Portland witch who converted his form to the omnipresent visage of fertility, well knowing that he was impotent. That, my friends, is a story for another day. Sure there was a cool pressure from one direction and another front with conflicting warm pressures and, wait, who is manning the sextant? Oh that’s right, a pelican. Their cargo of 1200 barrels of bourbon and figs might never make it to port but one thing was certain, with this capta- BGLUB GLUB:::GURBLE::COPYRIGHTGURBLE 3,422 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jul 28, 2011

Both the flavor and aroma are just delicious; they are fully redolent of buttery vanilla notes, sweet oak, almond, caramel-toffee, brown rice syrup, toasted coconut, molasses and a hint of fudge. The feel is creamy, smooth, and softly effervescent. Overall, it may get better with age, but it is drinking absolutely fantastic by any measure right now. 642 charactersktrillionaire, Jul 15, 2011

2009 perfect storm – really thick looking, almost sludgy, very barleywine like, dark brown, tannish, almost copper in color. Wow, smells of syrupy hops, good malt backbone. that’s a good tasting barleywine though. very balanced hops with good sweetness, nutmeg. It’s good. Mouth is very thick. Seems like the year on it probably did it some good (although I haven’t tried this year’s yet to know for sure). Overall, solid barleywine and I’m VERY happy got to try it. Cheers.

revisited this review with the 2011 vintage and was pretty blown away. firing on all cylinders. i envision that my first taste was more in the swarm of a ton of beers, but this is a fantastic barleywine. looks smell taste and feel...probably would give it 4.5s across the board today. great nutmeg caramel malts and the barrel adds a really nice element. just as good as the other big boys. vanilla, toffee, and caramel wonderfulness. 1,029 characterscosmicevan, Jul 05, 2011

A: Pours a muddled tea-brown color with a slight ruby vibe to it. Immediately, a khaki colored layer of creamy foam develops on top and displays excellent retention, leaving some intricate webbing down the inside of the glass.
S: Incredible aromas of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, carmelized brown sugar, and nutty toffee. Some subtle whiffs of alcohol, as well.
T: Thick layers of bourbon drenched caramel, molassas candies, vanilla glazed bread pudding, and coconut shavings on caramel dipped cherries.
M: So thick and sweet with only the tiniest hint of alcohol burn. I think a spoon would stand up in this.

A- 3.5 The body of the beer is a dark brown but when held to the light turns a very striking almost ruby tone. The head is non existant and an occasional bubble pops up. 
S-4.5 This one will definitely hit your sweet tooth. Brown sugar, molasses, caramel, vanilla, toffee, a bit of bourbon. I love bourbon! If I knew a bit more about bourbon I think I could really get into it. 
T- 4.5 This beer is very sweet. If you dont go for that kind of thing keep away. The beer doesnt hit cloying sweet levels but delivers a bourbon infused combination of the aroma. No alcohol is present in the flavors and I am really sure this beer is alcoholic. Hell its nearly kicking my ass. 
M- 5.0 This beer has a very full slick body. The carbonation is low but I think it works with the beers nature. Not a trace of alcohol in the mouth. I bet this beer is in excess of 12%. 
O- 5.0 I am really loving this beer. Its way sweet and way malty and very very alcoholic. The flavors and aromas are very well balanced. The alcohol is present but not in the aroma, taste or mouth. I think this beer is what bliss taste like.

2010 Vintage - 22oz - Poured into large snifter. Thanks Verecund.		
Shared with my brother.
A - Poured a deep, dark amber with a light tan head that quickly dissipated into a light ring around the glass. 
S - Amazing aroma, oak, vanilla, molasses and caramel, hints of bourbon. I pick up further hints of dark fruit and brown sugar. 
T - This barleywine is a thing of beauty. Incredibly smooth, all flavors blend perfectly. Sweet caramel, dark fruit, vanilla, flavors match the nose nicely. Very sweet, and fortunately not cloying. If I had drank the whole bottle however, my opinion might change a bit. 
M - So smooth and creamy, full bodied with low carbonation. 
O - Of all the barleywines that I've had to date, this has been by far my favorite. Hoping to land a few more of the highly regarded barleywines to see how this compares. 852 charactersRSchaeffer, May 31, 2011

A- Dark brown in color, small off-white/brown head that quickly fades and moves to a ring around the glass. 
S- Ah that all familiar barleywine aroma. This one is potent and sets a good expectation of a delicious beer. Big bourbon and bourbon barrel on the nose. Followed by syrup, and some fruits. 
T-Along with smell.. bouron on the nose some hints of caramel, syrup, vanilla, fruits, sweet malt, slight barrel earthy finish. Everything is so very well balanced, I see why this is the #1 barleywine. 
M- Medium/thick body, medium carbonation. Excellent coating on the palate, not to sticky. Just right.

3.5 A: Clear (I think) deep amber mahogany brown color. Two fingers of frothy tan head falls pretty quickly and leaves no lacing. A huge ABV will do that to you, I guess.
4.0 S: The aroma is good, but the bourbon overshadows the barleywine. Leathery, a touch of peat, oak and vanilla, and an almost nutty vibe. Underneath that there are hints of tobacco and dark fruitiness, molasses, brown sugar, booze, and a good helping of caramel.
4.0 T: The taste is more barleywine-forward for sure. Lots of tobacco, raisin, plum, prune, and date. Again somewhat nutty (perhaps from the bourbon, but who knows). Lots of molasses, brown sugar, and caramel. The bourbon kicks in after becoming accustomed to the malt flavors. Leathery, somewhat peaty in a smoky sense, and oak and vanilla from the barrel. Definitely sweet, but not cloying. The booze is very apparent, though. All 13.5% is realized.
3.5 M: Heavy body with a syruppiness to it. Just a touch chewy. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy, but a bit too hot to be as smooth as I'd like.
4.0 D: This is a good beer, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype (at least not this vintage). I think this will be vastly improved in a few years after it is allowed to cool down a bit. 1,308 charactersDavoleBomb, May 22, 2011

Surprised to find thus on tap before I can buy it tomorrow. This is going to be a great weekend.
Served in wine glasses from fresh tap (first glass in fact). No head was left nor any lacing, but who cares. This dark honey beverage looked spectacular.
The aroma was everything I expected. First and foremost was a suble bourbon overtone. To go with was some mollasses, caramel and vanilla.
They are some others aromas present, but my novice alfactory organ fails to identify them.
Holly crap. This thing is amazing. All the flavors blend together perfectly. Nothing overpowers, but rather everything is perfect beer symphony. Despite clocking in at 13%, the alcohol does not dominate. The flavor is sweet, but certainly not cloying. My taste buds are happy!
The mouthfeel can only be described as a creamy smoothness.
I could drink this all night, but I have 09 Perfect storm to attend to. A wonderful beer that does not dissapoint this newbie and will likely please the seasoned veteran.
Another stellar beer from Pelican.

2010 vintage.
This is a barrel-aged version of Pelican Pub's Stormwatcher's Winterfest; when finalized, it's a blend of barleywine that spent time in 11-13 Evan Williams barrels of varying ages.
A - As it pours out of the bottle, it appears a rustic orange, as if it's molten copper spilling out of a forge, but as it settles in the snifter, it turns into a murky, tawny brown that's completely opaque save some translucence at the rims. A steady pour releases a 1-fingered, tan head that is nearly gone by the time I reach my table (it almost instantly fizzes away like cola.) There's barely any remnant that the head was even there; perhaps a visualization of what something would look like after 'the mother of all storms' ravages it - complete emptiness. As the head essentially disappears completely, its not surprise that there's a distinct lack of lacing here. Small bubbles stick softly to the glass, but rapidly fall back into the depths. It's possible to see some carbonation slowly rise, but they are few and far between.
S - To be honest, the nose took me off-guard here at first because the bourbon isn't readily apparent at the start. The barrels are more noticeable, in that there's a decent helping of oak and especially vanilla here, but at heart, this beer is still an English barleywine, and there's absolutely no mistaking that as the malts lend their sweetness and depth right out of the gates. Big notes of molasses and even some chocolate join the mix, as well as darker fruits such as grapes, plums and some brown sugar. It's sweet, but enjoyable, and the oak and vanilla definitely complement that. The bourbon comes through about mid-way, and plays to the fruits here, as well as giving off some alcohol. Speaking of alcohol, the 13.5% ABV is masterfully concealed here, not approaching that number in any way in terms of heat.
T - Again, the thing I notice right away in the taste is that the bourbon is exceptionally subtle. I've never had the base beer, Stormwatcher's Winterfest, before, so I can't exactly say if it's because the original beer is overly malty, but I can say that the barrel-aging was careful enough to not completely overshadow it, which is a worthy criticism of some barrel-aging programs. To me, this is barrel-aging done right; performed to add another layer of depth to a beer and is subtle, rather than throwing out all of the characteristics of the original beer. As in the nose, the taste starts off sweet with thick molasses and chocolate, and almost immediately thereafter the barrels shine and give that extra kick of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. It's chewy and earthy, almost gritty, and to me, just screams 'English'. This isn't aggressively hopped in the slightest, and I'm hard-pressed to ink much hop influence out of this beer. The fruits make an appearance here, especially the plums, and the alcohol does come out as it warms and aerates. It's not solvent, but does give off that ethanol taste. Overall, an interesting and grounded flavor profile; this beer isn't aiming for the heavens and it's modest, but it's damn solid.
To note: Pour this beer about 5 minutes after pulling it from the fridge and taste it, then let it transform and note the differences it takes on as it warms. For me, the latter half of the bottle brings much more of the bourbon and barrel, especially the vanilla and to a lesser extent, oak. If you don't like it at first, let it sit a while, and it definitely develops into a different monster in its later stages.
M - Mouthfeel is heavy-bodied with low carbonation (although adequate for the style). Thick and chewy, although not on-par with the heavier imperial stouts, it is deservedly full-bodied. Smooth to say the least, although the lack of carbonation doesn't move the beer easily around the palate. Finish is bittersweet with a touch of bourbon and alcohol.
D/O - Drinkability is high. This beer is very easy to drink, if not for the flavor and smell alone, but the insane transformation it takes as it sits in the glass and the lack of alcohol. While it's a sipper for sure and a bottle will last you well over an hour, it's worth it to taste it at intervals and witness the changes. I found myself drawn back to the snifter time and time again and wasn't disappointed. 4,362 charactersnhindian, May 12, 2011

I've been looking for a world class bourbon barrel aged barleywine for some time now. It was probably my favorite beer of the day. It poured a dark brown/amberish color with a light off white head. It instantly smelled of oak, bourbon, vanilla, carmel malts, and alcohol. It made the hair on my neck stand up. I instantly knew that I was in for a treat! The flavors were a nice blend of woody earthiness, vanilla, molasses, Evan Williams, and slight roasted malts. The complexities of this one are something I haven't seen from a barleywine yet. It drank very easily and smooth for the high alcohol content. My only complaint is that I only got a four ounce pour and it disappeared too quickly. Massive thanks to those BAs who shared this on Saturday! You forever etched this memory in my mind! Can't wait to see you guys next year!
Edit: I've now had this beer several times since the tasting at DLD and each bottle has been equally superb. I'm confident in saying that it's my all time favorite beer and I cannot get enough of it. 1,097 charactersaasher, May 02, 2011

Mmmm…..Dark, dark, dark. Ruby red when held directly to the light with tan head.
Oak! Bourbon!!! Earthy/woody. Sweet sugary prunes, toasted vanilla. No alcohol present, like none! Dark cherry as it warms.
Bourbon! Toasted malt and dark candied fruit. The sweet malt is balanced perfectly by the bourbon-barrel. Really rich in flavor!! 
Warm. Medium-bodied. Borderline on full, but not syrupy. 
AGE IT!! Sooo good now, but resist the temptation if you can. A lot of potential here for one of the top BW’s of all time. Very pleasurable. Just a joy to sip on.

Mellow bourbon comes through right away. Aromas of raisins brown sugar and toffee round it out. Lots of dark malts with a sweet undertone in the aroma. The flavor follows the aroma nicely. Sweet caramel on this with a figgy raisin flavor. Brown sugar and toasted malts round this one out with a complimentery bourbon finish.

A mix of golden raisin and vanilla, that I would love to spritz on my girlfriend so I could smell it all night long. The taste has that dark fruit flavor too it. There is a butterscotch, vanilla, raisin and fig flavor that can typically be found in all good barleywines. The mouthfeel actually felt a bit rough to me. As if it wasn't finished. The palate has a almost a barley husked tannin-like quality to the finish that is slightly undesireable. Overall this is still a very good beer and I would probably never turn it down. 773 charactersVdubb86, Apr 21, 2011

A- Deep ambery brown with a touch of red. It 
has a interesting glow to it, and appears quite clear. Pours with a light off white head, which reduces to a ring around the glass.
S- Smells sweet and rich, mostly of caramel and hops. It's a very soft and well balanced smell. Yum...
T- The warm flavor instantly coats my mouth. Caramel and hops are abundant and strong. I also get notes of molasses and bourbon. Very very nice. The barrel aging is evindent, but not overboard.
M- A bit thick and intense, a touch boozy too. It definitely could use some time to mellow out, but certainly is not bad. 
O- Very very nice. I've been waiting to try this one, and it was not a let down. I have another that I am going to put a year or so on, and see how it shapes up.

Big thanks to therealnomayo for this bottle!
2010 edition, so you know we ain't steppin' on George and Marky-Mark's toes. It pours a somewhat murky ruby-brown topped by a short-lived half-finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises dark toffee, dark candi sugar, light cocoa, and light roasted malts. The taste holds notes of hot caramel, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, toffee, and a healthy amount of brown sugar and cinnamon. So much spicy maltiness, so much enjoyment. The body is a hefty medium, with a moderate carbonation and a syrupy feel. Overall, a very good barleywine, which deftly focuses on dropping a malt-bomb on all of us in a very pleasant way. Get some! 697 charactersTMoney2591, Apr 18, 2011

Pours a dark caramel with little to no head. Smells like candy, boozy candy, booze, dark fruits, phenomanal.  Taste dark fruits, some caramel, boozy, good.  Mouthfeel is sticky, drinkability is high for the ABV, delicious. Man, I need to get a few bottles of this. World class. 362 charactersLukafer, Apr 15, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big Thanks to GbVDave for providing this as the main part of a recent trade. Excellent trading partner.
A beautiful ruby red/amber color. Cool color when held to the light. Rather dark when looking at a full glass. A tan head forms and vanishes fairly quickly. A thin ring of foam remains. No lacing remains.
Aroma is of malt, subtle vanilla a little nutty and a touch of coconut. Some sense of oak, but deep in the background. Actually the aroma just keeps getting better.
If someone says this beer is only highly rated due to hype, they need to be slapped. Wow, this is fantastic. The layers of malt are the base of the flavor. The depth is wonderful. Maple, vanilla, coconut, nice wood, yes bourbon, caramel… Lot’s going on. There are some dark fruits here, but I am so struck by the other flavors that I don’t let my mind dwell there.
Really bold body. Even more than I ever expected. Really thick and almost a syrup. Carbonation only provides a sparkle.
Special beer indeed. I will be trading for this again. Back on the Want List for this one!!! 1,062 charactersReagan1984, Apr 15, 2011

Pours a clear golden-copper color with a half-finger cream-colored head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of rich caramel malts with smooth butterscotch, toffee, and vanilla. Also present are hints of oak and even lighter hints of booze-soaked medium fruits.
Tastes very similar to how it smells. Robust caramel malt flavors kick things off and are quickly sweetened by the addition of vanilla and toffee. Midway through the sip the flavors lighten up a bit with hints of butterscotch. Slight amounts of oak bring everything together near the end of the sip, fading out into a slightly bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is great. It’s got a very nice thickness with grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is also great. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this was the second time I’ve had this beer and it lived up to its memory. A nearly perfectly well balanced English barleywine with nice notes of barrels. Well worth a shot. 1,031 charactersglid02, Apr 14, 2011

bottle to snifter
2010
Capped and gold foil
App- This was a gorgeous deep dark pentrating red. It had a lot of shimmery highlights. The head was a very compact two finger khaki in color and was very quick to recede.
Smell- A very big smelling beer. The minute you pop the cap scents just come wofting up and out of the bottle. This was big, boozy and very rich. Scents of oak, vanilla and dark dried fruits fill out the nose.
Taste- This is one of those beers I will remember for a long time. It was powerful and rich but had a multi faceted taste that changed with each sip. The booze is very potent and that's okay because the other flavors compliment it well from the oak and the vanilla to the sweet and strong dried cherries. 
Mouth- This bordered itself on being full bodied and was low carbed. The mouth was thick and rich and left a sweet liquor like taste after each sip.
Drink- This was one of the best beers I have had. The strong qualities were matched by its subtle flavor directions and how well each sip played on the last one. Would love to have one a week. Just a great beer. 1,116 charactersFosterJM, Apr 14, 2011

*From notes
Vintage 2010
A: Imagine you've accidentally added a heaping dollop of molasses to the richest red velvet batter you've ever seen. That my friends is what this Mother looks like. A careful, straight pour yields an eye opening 1.75 finger head and reasonable lacing.
S: Like the best vintage port you've never had. The bouquet on this one is simply marvelous. I can't begin to explain quite how complex this is. There are so many wild and crazy nuances exploding within my nostrils: figs, plums, dried apricots and hard caramel candy. I think I spent more time inhaling this godly concentrate then I did drinking it.
T: Buy a farm. Once you've settled in and cultivated the soil, spend the next fifty years growing the choicest fruit trees the world over. Figs, dates, plums, morello cherries, persimmons and more. Their roots will grow deep into the earth. The heavenly fruit these trees will bear will vine ripen, and once at their peak, you'll harvest them by hand. After a long day in the field, take your prized crop home and dry them. Allow the sugars to crystalize, the skins to shrivel and the flavors to concentrate. With your old, weary and wrinkly hands, squeeze the dried fruits, wring every last drop. And once you've painstakingly completed this arduous task, bottle the Godly nectar and call it the Mother of All Storms.
M: It feels like I'm drinking motor oil. It's extremely thick and cloying. From the moment it enters my mouth, it explodes with a sticky nature not seen in many brews.
O: I'll keep it simple: Pelican's Mother of All Storms is best Enlgish Barleywine I've ever had.

4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 release, big thanks to Joe for hooking me up with this, shared with Smoked.
Poured into a snifter, this brew appears a deep dark ruby color with a hint of almost purple about it that is fairly clear and plum-like in appearance. A finger of frothy yellowish stained tan head appears and fades leaving spots atop the brew and on the glass.
The aroma is deep and fruity like plums, raisin, toffee, caramel and sweet, smooth vanilla notes. The barrel aged and bourbon presence in this brew is amazing. The vanilla aspect is amazing, it's one of my favorite characteristics of barrel aged brews. The abv tingles the nose with a fusel touch and light medicinal quality and herbal smelling hops. Overall the smell of this brew is quite candied sweet and enjoyable. The alcohol gets a bit tangy as it warms.
The taste is bold with alcohol and contrasted with herbal hops that give way to a light medicinal flavor. The bold flavors of this brew part to show a light oxidized quality, herbal hops and a drying sense of alcohol. Notes of oak and the barrel aging presence of vanilla flavoring mix with toffee and caramel sweetness. More sips yield dark fruity flavors like raisin, plum, dates and an overall candied sweetness.
This is a medium to full bodied brew with a lighter level of carbonation but not too low. This is an exceptional brew. The abv is fitting and not distracting with all the other flavors. A very solid sipper with a toasted quality that only evolves as it warms. Fantastic brew that satisfies the sweet tooth. 1,531 charactersstakem, Apr 07, 2011

This big beer poured a dark deep red with a 1 finger head that disappers relatively quickly unless you keep swirling it. Not much lacing at all unless you keep swirling.
The smell was terrific with dark fruit lots of bourbon and a little wood in it. The taste is oh so smooth for something that is 13.5%. I can tell this is a big beer, but I would not of guessed anything over 10. A lot more of the bourbon but not as sticky and thick as some other barleywines. It does not coat your mouth or feel overbearing which was nice especially after having a good amount of this beer. 
This is a really terrific beer and one can tell how carefully one like this is crafted compared to other barleywines. A must try. 771 charactersmcgwire756, Apr 02, 2011

Poured into a Darkness snifter in Thorpe429's living room while whispering sweet and subtly offensive nothings in the ears of my fellow tasters. Looks like and English Barleywine as this beer is a dark mahogany with a bit of off white/tan head.
Smells rather sweet with lots of sticky malts and bourbon. Seems perhaps just a touch hot, but who the hell am I to complain. Taste is very malty and fairly full-bodied, but slightly thinner than I imagined. Lots of toffee and caramel with notes of vanilla and oak.
I enjoyed it. 739 charactersLunch, Mar 28, 2011

pours dark mahogany and is clear once you hold it up the the light - an aggressive pour renders a 2 finger tan head that rapidly dissipated and left no lacing
smell is not very strong which surprised me but is still quite complex - bourbon oak chocolate dark fruit caramel 
taste - this packs some punch some boozy heat and all the notes the nose had - woody dark fruit caramel chocolate malts - the highlight is bourbon barrel aging and what it brings to this beer 
mouthfeel is full bodied heavy sticky which works very well since this beer is a sipper(took me over 2hrs to finish) - it had more carbonation the i would have thought and i was pleased 
overall - this brew made me wonder why there are not more breweries that barrel aging Bwines - it also reminded me quite a bit of founders backwoods bastard 825 charactersjsh420, Mar 28, 2011

Vintage: 2009 Perfect Storm
Glassware: Portsmouth Tulip
This brew has been in my cellar for 2+ years and am eager to sample it.
Poured dark brown mahoghany in color w/ a skim coat tan head w/ no lacing on the glass. Prototypical BA BW appearance. Aromas of dark roasted chocolate, molasses, dark currants, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. The taste was of warming dark fruits and charred malts, w/ a touch od brown sugar, followed by strong bourbon and vanilla. For me this was still way too boozy even w/ 2+ years of age on it. Medium bodied.
Disappointed majorly by this brew! Very complex in the flavors, but the bourbon barrel aging was simply too much and completely overwhelmed the base beer.
Glad I got a chance to sample, but now really looking forward to sampling the base beer(Stormwatcher's Winterfest). 848 charactersmikeyv35, Mar 27, 2011

2009 bottling.
Pours a deep mahogany color with ruby highlights, a little cloudy. Carbonation seems fine.
Nose is still quite boozy, but not as bad as it was a year ago. Also getting big dark fruit notes, a little woodiness, and some sweet caramel/toffee flavors.
Taste follows with huge caramely flavors, big dark fruit and a nice booziness that compliments the flavors and the mouthfeel. Not picking up that much wood, but a nice subtle vanilla note that i didn't pick up in the nose as well. Finish is clean, next to no bitterness, as the style calls for. Booze and thick caramel linger in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is damn close to perfect. A great chewy viscosity and ideal carbonation for the style.
"overall" uh...good? Really alot like Arctic Devil.
Really enjoyed drinking this, just like the first time around. Thanks again for packing this one up with you Alex, a shame we didn't get to it while you were still here. Great beer. 1,108 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Mar 25, 2011

The aroma is wonderfully complex with some toffee, some cherry, some pecan, lots and lots of bourbon, & the booziness while present is very mild. The flavor is plenty of the vanilla and bourbon thing but not in an insanely overbearing way, this is well balanced with a very nutty and roasty character. The beer has some great candy sweetness, some resiny notes and a bit of coffee. The palate is very full and luxurious. 470 charactersBieresDesMoines, Mar 23, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Wow, review # 1000! I never imagined I would make it this far. It's been an interesting road, some good beers, some bad drain pours, some surprises. I've learned a lot over the time. But yet, there are so many more to go. So for awesome number 1000, comes one I've been waiting for for a while. As I could not land a Kaggen! this is a good rebound. Thanks to imperialking for this beauty. This is the '09 vintage.
I keep balking at opening it, not quite sure if I want to yet, but I've come this far, and I need an awesome beer for the 1000th, so here. I finally bite my tongue and pop! It pours a very small fizzy but darker colored bubbled head that fades to little pockets of bubbles fairly quickly. The beer itself is super dark, barely any light getting through on the edges, revealing a ruby molasses brown color.
The nose wafted out as soon as it cracked open, with bourbon just pouring out. Lots of great bourbon aromas, some oak, toasty oak, a bit of vanilla coming from that. That rounds off the awesome malt aromas, plenty of dark malts and reddish malts all smashed together in a big heavy nose. Some dark fruits, hints of plum and date/fig, candy aroma like the candy on a candy covered apple, plenty of caramel and vanilla, some light chocolate, light bitter chocolate and creamy, very light hint of booze, and a nice soft aged malt aroma. So heavenly, complex, and just awesome. As it warms the bourbon comes out a bit more, bringing some woody esters with it too. I just hope the taste doesn't let down now. 
Taste starts rich and creamy, lots of dark malts, chocolate, very light roast, some reddish malts, creamy smooth malts, rich and luscious, some dark fruits again bringing fig, plum, hint of raisin, and more, which gives a nice chocolate covered raisin and candy flavor. Then again loaded with bourbon flavor, not so much as the nose and as it would be fresh I imagine, but a really nice bourbon flavor. Some light toasted oak and barrel flavor coming with that delicious bourbon. THere is also a light warming booze, and hint of tingly booze as I hold it in my mouth for about a minute. Some aged soft malt flavors come through, like a nice old ale or, sic, barleywine. A light juicy malt bomb, light smooth and creamy oat feel, it has quite a smooth but heavy stout feel as well, almost like a cross between a big stout and barleywine. I get the slightest hint of earthy hops, adding a light bitterness to the nice sweetness and luscious feel. Hints of molasses and caramel, as well as vanilla, round off the complex and awesome flavor. As it finishes, a mouth coating malt flavor just sticks all over, reminding me of the flavor for a few minutes, a very slight tingle from the booze comes and goes quickly. It drinks much smoother than 13.5%. A light chocolate and candy flavor linger, as well as aged malts and dark fruits, the bourbon is mostly gone at this point.
Mouth is full bodied, fairly heavy, luscious, smooth, thick, and a little velvety, with lower but decent enough carbonation for an aged barleywine.
Overall, I'm very impressed. I was glad this was #1000. It definitely lived up to the hype, and maybe more. Lots of delicious soft aged dark malts, chocolate, dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, oak, very complex but very tasty. No real off flavors at all, even with all the dark malts there was no minerality quality or burnt flavors. The booze is there but drinks well for 13.5%. Very slight hops there, but not much, which I'm sure is helpful for aging it, and perhaps I should try it fresh sometime. A slow drinker, but I could sip this all day. The one negative at all is the lack of carbonation, but then again almost 2 years old, a heavy slightly syrupy barleywine at 13.5% the lower carbonation doesn't hurt too much.
Yay, 1000 reviews! Release the balloons and confetti, just don't let them fall in my awesome beer. Thanks to all the awesome traders who helped me get here, and more in the future. Can't wait to try more awesome beers, and wish I could just sip beer all day and never have to work, but I gotta pay for the beer somehow. And now I'm enjoying this with a little bit of dark chocolate and it's so transcending, they accent each other so well, I'm in heaven. 4,233 charactersjlindros, Mar 20, 2011

Review #575
The beer poured a syrupy, dark caramel color with no head. A few tiny bubbles dotted the top of the liquid but they quickly dissipated.
Tons of bourbony sweetness came through in the nose. Super oaky with strong vanilla and brown sugar notes. Rich caramel malts were apparent as well. Slightly toasty. Some candied fruits were also noticeable.
The flavor profile was intense. Like the nose, the bourbon element was quite potent. Boozy and somewhat hot initially. Maple syrup, brown sugar and candied fruits came through strong. Super malty and rich. Sweet toffee and burnt caramel notes were apparent. The oaky, slightly tannic and dry finish provided a nice balance to this otherwise sweet, alcohol rich brew. As the beer warmed, the booziness subsided and subtle nuances came forth.
The mouthfeel was syrupy and smooth but a bit thinner than I anticipated for a 13.5% ABV barleywine. Creamy and supple on the palate with a fine, mild effervescence.
This beer really comes into its own with time. In order to enjoy all its complexities, definitely let this one warm up to cellar temperature before serving. For a barleywine of such magnitude, The Perfect Strom is a unique and enjoyable sipper. 1,306 charactersDamian, Mar 14, 2011

Graciously given to me by my man Rochefort10nh 
Appearance: Deep mahogany in color with an off white head that vanishes in an instant. A slight ring is all that's left surrounding the outer edge of the glass. No lacing to speak of, it just slides down the side and looks potent.
Smell: Oak, vanilla, caramel and dare I say raisins. It's aroma is simply awesome. 
Taste: Vermont maple syrup hits the taste buds head on with caramel, coconut and bourbon in the middle followed by a fair amount of sweetness and alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied feel almost like syrup. A perfect amount of carbonation no more needed for the style. Finishes clean, bitter and dry. 
Drinkability: A definite sipper and quite enjoyable. I was first introduced to this gem under it's former name "the perfect storm" and this one doesn't miss a beat. Next year I'll be stocking up on this one. 890 characters05Harley, Mar 05, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 vintage bomber poured into an oversized snifter on 12/11/10. Striking clarity in the mahogany body. The fluffy tan head is somewhat surprising at this monstrous ABV. It sticks around for a while before receding to a thick skim and a bubbly collar. Streaks and patches of lacing are scattered about.
Smells incredible. Since this stuff aged for a considerable period of time in the barrel, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at how well integrated the bourbon is. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly potent, but not at all out of place when paired up with the massive toffee malt. Oak, vanilla and figgy pudding aromas demand attention as well.
Tastes every bit as great as it smells. You can literally taste the vapors coming off this stuff- crazy. The creamy mouthfeel is the perfect vehicle for the copious amounts of buttery caramel and toffee. The bourbon simmers in the background without ever overwhelming. Vanilla and oak all around. Intense blend of fruits- persimmon, fig, white grapes, raspberry pie and a scathing citrusy bitter undercurrent. Bourbon, brown sugar and raspberry jam linger and linger. 
Overall impression: Incredibly good barleywine. I can't imagine how it could get better, but I'm glad I've got a few bottles in the cellar just in case it does. 1,280 charactersPDXHops, Mar 03, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -7.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Got this in a trade with largadeer. Thanks again. Split with a buddy and poured into a NB Globe. 2010 vintage of Mother of All Storms.
Pours out a murky medium brown. Settles into glass a murky dark brown and a very thin bubbly head emerges. The head doesn't even stay around long enough for me to pour the second glass for my buddy. A ring around the glass is the only thing that stays. Head is medium tan in color, swirling doesn't even bring a much head. No lacing is produced.
The nose certainly lets you know that this sat in bourbon barrels. Sweet bourbon, vanilla, oak, brown sugar and caramel. There is a lot of caramel in this. At times I get some dark fruit smells but can't really decide what specifically those fruits are. Very sweet smelling overall.
Much like the smell but much more of the dark fruits come through. First taste a very sweet but by the end of each sip the alcohol harshness becomes very present. The bourbon flavor itself is very pleasant and I think is done really well because it's not overpowering all the other flavors. The alcohol heat however, makes this a bit rough at times.
Medium bodied and slightly slick feeling. There is a sugary stickiness that is left on the lips after each sip. The alcohol burn is not very easy to try to ignore. Warming on the way down. 
Overall this is a great tasting beer but it is a bit hot and harsh. If I had another bottle I would hold on to it for at least a full year before opening it. If you decide to open one, this is still pretty young so be prepared to taste the alcohol heat. All that said, my friend and I finished our glasses very easily and enjoyed it all the way. 1,654 charactersSwimsum, Mar 02, 2011
4.07/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the bottle into a tulip. 
Pours a mostly clear, dusky burgundy, the stuff behind obscured by the darkness. Cranberry highlights. A one-finger head of tightly packed light khaki foam quickly dissipates to a thin, persistent ring leaving horizontal lines of lace. 
Smells like an old ale. Cranberry, plums, leather, substantial oak, tons of vanilla, caramel, overripe oranges, earthy English hops, toffee. Well-integrated bourbon. Very smooth. 
The flavor is similar: plum sauce, quickly ripening oranges, earthy hops, vanilla ice cream, caramel, oodles of toffee, some light leather. Interestingly dry finish. There's also a hefty amount of ethanol. This needs to lay down for a year or two. 
Light massaging carbonation, very light fizziness. Medium-full body, nice creaminess. Heavy alcohol warmth in the throat, tongue-numbing and chest-warming. The booziness is unavoidable, but I don't mind it too much. 
Mother of All Storms packs incredible flavors into an alcohol-soaked whole. It's great for how fresh it is, but a year in the cellar will make this beer phenomenal. 1,090 charactersPhelps, Feb 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5After a long day felt like I needed something special to open tonight. 2009 vintage poured from a 22oz bottle into my Dogfish snifter. It poured a a dark, murky, mahogany color, with a thin tan ring sticking to the edge of the glass. 
The aroma has a very nice mix of flavors to it. Brown sugar, molasses and vanilla all come out along with some raisin, cherry and plum flavors. The woody oak and moderate bourbon alcohol give it some excellent complexity. The barrel aging is very well done, it adds some great flavor but manages to integrate very well and not overpower the beer. Excellent aroma overall. 
The taste shows a lot of dark fruits to it throughout the flavor. Figs, plums and raisins show through more at first, while some cherry comes through more in the finish. Some brown sugar and vanilla sweetness comes through as well towards the finish. The woody oak and bourbon alcohol seem more subtle compared to other barrel aged beers, but still add some very nice, complex flavors to the beer.
The mouthfeel is on the heavier side, with carbonation being moderate for the style. Drinkability is very good, I really loved the flavors to it. The barleywine flavors were very good, the dark fruits and malty sweet flavors were especially nice in it. The barrel aging was also done very well. It added some nice depth and complexity, but still allowed the beer to shine through. Fantastic beer overall. 1,413 charactersbillab914, Feb 26, 2011

A: Pours a ruby/brown color with a small head that dissipates very quickly to a ring of bubbles around the outer edge. No lacing at all. 
S: Very sweet and rich. Lots of caramel/toffee and some molasses. I also get lots of dark fruits - raisins and a slight oak component. Really nice and complex. 
T: Similar to the smell, lots of dark fruits again, the raisins return, and I also taste some cherries. A little bit of alcohol, but more subdued than other barleywines I have had. 
M/D: Medium to full bodied with a good carbonation, balanced very well. There is a slight alcohol burn, but not a problem at all, and expected. Overall, I found this beer to be really good. Very complex flavor profile with a lot going on. 779 charactersmdaschaf, Feb 24, 2011

Pours a brown with deep ruby highlights. Low clarity through the beer. There is a half inch of beige head that sat on top but quickly fizzled out to nothing. The ring of foam that usually stits around the edges of my glass is no longer their either. Once poured this beer looks ready to be drank.
The aroma is that of a rich caramel malt with a touch of breadiness. There is plenty of oak and bourbon that follow with just a hint of sweet raisin on the end. It smells slightly hot and sweet.
The flavor is very well balanced yet complex. There are lots of rich malt up front as well as bourbon. I can taste the traces of oak from the barrels as well as a touch of vanilla. The dark fruit flavor I smelled (raisin) tastes more like dark cherry as all of the flavors combine on the finish. The flavors are warm and full bodied.
Lots of body and warmth, with very little sensation from carbonation on this mouthfeel. A very creamy body that bites on the first sip, but really smoothes out the rest of the way. Easy to drink, although not to be guzzled.
I enjoy Barleywine very much and this beer really set the standard for the style (at least for barrel aged). The flavors were bold yet well balanced, a true sipping beer, not because you want to but because you have to. 1,296 charactersSiepJones, Feb 12, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look - Very little head appears on an aggressive pour but the color is great it's a very dark amber color. 
Smell - A very nice bourbon smell the oakiness comes thru but it is not over powered but the slight alcohol smell, there is also some dark fruit and a little caramel
Taste - The taste is amazing great bourbon taste just like is the nose. The first thing you taste is bourbon then some dark fruit, and finally some of the caramel. I find that the alcohol is very well hidden for being 13.5%
Mouthfeel - Good carbonation for the style, the body was a little thin when compared to others in this style but I found the medium body to well complement the flavors. Just like in the taste you can tell the alcohol is there but it is very nicely done. 
Drinkability - This has scary good drinkablilty for 13.5% this is hands down my favorite English Barley wine that I have ever had. 887 charactersphisigben, Feb 07, 2011

3.9/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52010 vintage. Opened on February 3, 2011.
Persian plum with the tiniest ring of tan head. Still; like burnt caramel waiting to be eaten.
Huge, decadent nose. Caramel, toffee, oak, vanilla, and bourbon booziness. Just the tiniest wisp of raspberry. 
Palate is toasted malt, bourbon, toffee, caramelized sugar, and vanilla, with some oak peeking through the huge bourbon notes. Some dark fruit, especially plum strikes mid-to-late palate and shows more as it warms. The complexity is slightly masked by the heat of the bourbon. There's an odd note on the back of the palate I can't quite put my pen to - almost vegetal. Very sweet, very big, with a lingering bitter astringency on the finish. 
Medium-bodied, with low carbonation. Sticky. 
A nice sipper for a cold night, but not as mind-blowing as I had hoped. A little sherry oxidation should benefit MoaS and cool her down enough to appreciate her complexities. I'll be nursing this bottle for the next 60-90 minutes, easily.
EDIT: Fourth bottle opened December, 2011. This has become fairly muddled and one-note. Will update with last bottle. 1,100 charactersVerecund, Feb 04, 2011

Aroma: Mad malty. Caramel and toffee. Sweet bourbony booziness and maple. Dark fruit. Sugary iced tea. 
Taste: Sweet brown sugar, toasty, bready. A little spiciness, perhaps from the barrel? That iced tea is still there, not at all unpleasant. A scoach of cellar mustiness and beef jerky/savoryness, oddly enough.
Mouthfeel: Works, nothing amazing but it is fine for the beer.
Drinkability: Not a chore at all. Opened up nicely once warmed. 
Glad I got to try this but the ~$34 it cost for us to acquire it was a bit steep. 629 charactersMrFootstones, Feb 01, 2011

Had a dark crimson color with a small ring of head thats a little tan tinged. The lacing didn't really stay so much. 
The smell has definite leather qualities you find on many barleywines with notes of dark fruit, prunes and cereal-bran malts. I don't get a lot of bourbon character in the smell. 
The taste is nice. Raisin and rum notes prevail with banana, slight bourbon sweetness + alcohol sweetness; Prunes and some dried berries as well. 
Smooth feel but a little hot for me. 
Drinkable for a barleywine for sure. 586 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 26, 2011

22 oz bomber of 2010 vintage, received as a generous surprise from lurchingbeast, poured into a big snifter. Thanks Frank! This beer was one of my top wants since it tops Beeradvocate's list of English Barleywines, and I love me some J.W.Lees - super excited to try this one!
Appearance 4/5
Deep garnet and clear with a big brown head that gave away rather soon and settled into a thin collar, without any lacing. However it should be noted that this beer has spent time in barrels and is quite high in alcohol, so poor retention is not a problem.
Aroma 4/5
The usual suspects are present: Toast, caramel/toffee, figs, sweet alcohol and bourbon, and then there are some off putting notes of green potatoes. Alcohol gets a little too strong at warmer temperature.
Taste 4/5
Sweet, but flavorfuly so, with a sharpness of character. Despite the dominantly sweeter notes, this beer is quite bitter and astringent and would complement fatty food very well. A long and vinous sweet finish with a slightly bitter and alcoholic aftertaste.
Mouthfeel 3/5
Disappointingly thin!
Drinkability 4/5
Good, but this beer didn't wow me in any respect. I will definitely revisit it if I get a chance to! 1,220 characterstewaris, Jan 26, 2011

A: Almond brown with dark red edges. About one finger of beige head. Small amount of lace left behind. No cap.
S: Smooth buttery toffee and caramel are the opening act. Mild tart fruit, vanilla, oak and smooth bourbon follow. Malt and hops are sort of an after thought. Smells terrific.
T: The flavor is just as smooth as the nose. Toffee and caramel rolled in slightly bitter hops. Dark fruit, brown sugar, tobacco, molasses, wet wood and bourbon. Hardly any heat. 
M: Creamy smooth medium body. Just enough carbonation to keep things lively.
D: This is my second time enjoying this beer. The wait between tastings was almost a year. I really hope I don't have to wait that long to try it again. 787 charactersbeerwolf77, Jan 26, 2011
3.4/5  rDev -23.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3MOAS (2010) bottle provided by CaseyK at a Madison tasting. 
Pours a clear brown with the booze/sugar shimmers and very little head. Smells of oak, booze and vanilla. Another bourbon barrel beer *sigh*. Tastes strongly of booze, complemented with vanilla and a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. This beer is not ready yet. Like a little kid who is freaking out, this beer really needs some time to lay down and chill out. Features a medium bodied, sugary mouthfeel with lower to mid carbonation, which is not unexpected. It is way too boozy, sugary, etc. to call altogether that drinkable. Seriously, this beer was made for the long haul. In the future, I don't think I would touch it until it had a year on it. Then, I am certain my review and experience would be more pleasant. That being said, I think it has tons of potential and was enjoyable as is, despite it being a bit of a mess. Let's call it currently an enjoyable mess.
EDIT: Had an opportunity to try another 2010 bottle in September 2010 it is not aging gracefully. The big, bright excessive bourbon flavor which was both hot, but tasty has lost some of the positive edge to it and instead has gotten more abrasive. Review above adjusted accordingly (-1 for taste). 1,234 charactersseeswo, Jan 19, 2011

Served from bottle into a goblet. Poured red-brown with a minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, and slight alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, cream, and alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. The flavor and aroma were quite complex and all aspects seemed to work quite well together. Not really a whole lot could be added to make it better. This is an absolute must try. 700 charactersthagr81us, Jan 12, 2011

M/D - A true sipper. You can tell by some of the alcohol heat that this is a young beer and is a perfect candidate for aging. I am glad I have a few to compare over the years to see how it develops, I am betting on fantastic! 628 charactersOakedCanuck, Jan 10, 2011

(A)- Pours a rather dark burnt sienna color that produced a rather good sized tan colored head despite its ABV. Dissipated to a low layer of froth. Certainly a darker representation of the style, but it does not bother me any.
(S)- A decadent rich profile. Wonderfully sweet and rich caramel/toffee/brown sugar front. Raisin, molasses, cocoa, and a smooth syrupy-like charred oak roastedness that could only have come from the bourbon barrels. Such a dynamic yet delicate and rich aroma that I could smell all day; my description does not do it justice.
(T)- Very similar to the smell. A sexy rich profile of raisin and molasses with bits of caramel/toffee/and brown sugar. A blend of cocoa and charred oak. Again, my description fails in comparison to what this is really like.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. It is so smooth yet rich and smooth for a barleywine with only a minimal warmth despite is massive 13.5% ABV.
(D)- This is just a wonderful example of a barleywine despite how fresh it is still. Smooth despite its ABV. My review does not do it justice; rich and dynamic with really the perfect body for the style. I so want to just give this perfect 5s, but this really cannot be too drinkable since it just needs to be sipped and savored to fully appreciate just how good this really is in my opinion. 1,478 characterssweemzander, Jan 09, 2011
2.88/5  rDev -34.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2A collaboration of efforts to buy a case of these. Bottle shared by petsuphi with cmurren25 and it went a little something like this...
A- A very surprising dark charcoal black color similar to some fine stouts instead of the familiar brownish colors of most barleywines. A nice amount of carb that dissipated an off-white/tannish head into a tiny thin strip of it's former self. A quite odd looking beer in my honest opinion.
S- A pungent smell greets me like a filthy old diaper. Did not pick up the normal smells, but some burnt oak/wood, some touches of bottom shelf bourbon and stale vanilla. It was very undesirable, seriously wanted to pick up more aromas, but they just weren't there at all. Completely let down.
T- I will say the taste does not match the smell at all. Has a pleasant opening of smoked oak/wood with a nice earthiness in the beginning. As it warms though more of the off putting characteristics come back to torture me. Stale vanilla, your grandmother's stale werther's original caramel candies from 1981 and some malty sweetness that is almost not sweet enough. Son of a bitch why did I buy a few of these? 
M- Full bodied and thick. From appearance the carb was anticipated, but is really not there no tingle or prickle. A nice warming presence along with coating and a syrupy character. It's semi-viscous, but doesn't stick around like others I've had. A little underwhelmed to be honest.
D- Not really, I had to suffer through too much with this one to ever come back to it. I would think about it, but would probably pass on this one. It's high abv, nasty smell and unpleasant taste kill this one for me. I'm sure a lot of people will like it I'm just not one of them. I would reconsider after putting myself through that one twice.
I have had 2 vintages of this beer and they both were let downs. There are definitely better barrel aged barleywines around. Anyone want one in trade? 1,919 charactersStormKing47, Jan 07, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 vintage
Poured into a Portsmouth tulip glass. A clear, burnt, amber-brown body holds up a thin film of off-white head that eventually fades to a thin ring. Looks pretty good for a 13.5% barleywine. Swirling the glass leaves some light lacing and legs.
Bourbon, oak, vanilla and sweet dark fruits rise up from the glass. Figs, sugared plums and a hint of cherry. Honey, sweet malts and a touch of alcohol. Nice layers of complexity.
Sweet, caramel malts, light bourbon, vanilla and some peaty hop bitterness. The hops take a backseat to the English malt profile, but still carry some weight and add an almost meaty presence to the middle of the flavor profile. Some alcohol comes through, but is pretty well balanced for a beer of this size. Still would consider this hot though. Dark fruits and a touch of grape. The fruits are not as strong as the nose would suggest, but still present. The malts are great. Bready and biscuity, pairing well with the light bourbon presence. I originally gave this a 4 right out of the bottle at cellar temp, but as it warms the fruits come out more and the entire flavor profile becomes more integrated, so this deserves to be bumped up a half point. Good stuff.
Mouthfeel is thick, almost viscous with light carbonation. Almost spot on for an English barleywine. Warming alcohol throughout.
Drinkability is good. This is a great sipper, especially on a cold night. I love the nose and the flavor is almost there as well. Probably my third favorite barleywine right behind Midnight Sun's Arctic Devil and J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale. The beer seems a little hot at the moment and I'd like to see the light hop presence die out a little bit. So needless to say, I'm excited to revisit this beer with a few years on it. Really glad I've got a case to age. One of the best English barleywines out there. Nice work Pelican. 1,859 characterssisuspeed, Dec 30, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Mother of All Storms, poured into a large snifter to reveal a deep ruddy brown body, almost opaque in thickness, with half a finger of airy cream head that fades quickly. Darker than the English barleywines I am used to but pretty as it is. Smells sweet and malty with a big caramel presence. Surprisingly not syrupy-smelling given the consistency and style; more bready than fruity with a slight hop presence on the nose that suggests robust bitterness. Very strong smells. Very nice lacing.
Tastes decently sweet but with a decently strong bitterness and an almost savory bread-like slightly salty umami that would I think lend well to aging. Caramel and some warm date rolled in as well. Mouthfeel is just slightly abrasive with a tingly small carbonation, otherwise medium-bodied. Pretty drinkable for a fresh-ish English Barleywine, very sip-able. Very excited to see where this one goes with aging. 905 charactersabuliarose, Dec 30, 2010

A: Pours a translucent, darkish brown with deep ruby highlights when held up to the light, capped by a half finger of frothy, beige head. Retention is poor as it quickly settles down to scattered lacing.
S: Bourbon notes out front with strong vanilla and oak, followed by a big case ofcaramel and toffee, sweet figs, leather and light tobacco. Some light alcohol heat paints a pleasant hue over the rest of the aroma, everything is well integrated.
T: Caramel and toffee up front with light vanilla, followed by moderate bourbon character on the mid-palate - oaky and stronger vanilla. Dark fruits come in just after the bourbon with figs and dark cherries being evident, followed by leather and a faint charred character. Long finish of dark fruits, bourbon, and burnt sugar.
M: Full bodied with low, velvety carbonation. Could be just a hair thicker.
D: Alcohol is evident but far from overwhelming...it's a sipper, but it's extremely drinkable for its ABV and style. 988 charactersXul, Dec 26, 2010

I poured the 2010 vintage of this bourbon barrel aged barleywine into a couple of wine glasses and watched the head dissipate to barely any lacing. Not surprising, given the wood aging, I suppose. It's clear when held up to light, but very dark amber and red in appearance. Alcohol smacks you in the nose, but the primary flavor is bourbon. Not a lot of it though. Taste-wise, I can say this beer has made me like bourbon aging again. I had been burnt out on it. 
It's got the sweetness of the barleywine, but without anything cloying. That sweetness matches the bourbon sweetness, and the malt notes really peek through. It's highly alcoholic, so it's more of a sipper, but that doesn't mean it can't get you twisted! 
Just, you know... good luck finding a bottle. 900 charactersafksports, Dec 25, 2010

A - Pours a clear, deep, mahogany that borders on black. Nice ruby highlights, yet little/no head. 
S - Strong bourbon notes, hints of oak and vanilla. 
T - Strong bourbon. There's a hop bitterness to the finish that I hope will mellow out with time. A bit of residual malt sweetness as well as some alcohol burn.
M - Medium to full body, heavy and sweet. 
D - Good. There's a bit of heat, and it's certainly a sipper, but it improves with a little bit of warmth. 
Overall- Good, but a bit one-dimensional to make it elite. Bourbon treatment is well done, but needs a bit more depth. Don't trade your cellar for one, but it's worth getting, especially if you're a bourbon fan. 727 charactersmrandypandy, Dec 20, 2010

I vividly remember him coming into our psychiatry lecture with a dejected look on his face and saying, "we're on the list, but a long ways down." Luckily, it worked out for us. Poured into a snifter.
A: Dark brown with very dark, but vibrant ruby red tones, especially when held up to the light. The head on this beer measured about ¾ of a finger and was off white in color. There was excellent head retention, but minimal lacing. 
S: Bourbon notes prevail, but there's also a earthy character that smells somewhat like dog food. I know that this sounds gross, but when combined with the bourbon, it actually smells quite good. There's also some caramel and burnt sugar on the nose.
T: Wow, I was so surprised that this is not hot whatsoever. The alcohol is completely hidden. There's beautiful flavors of bourbon, maple syrup, and butterscotch. Deeper down there's cinnamon, some hop bitterness and a faint hint of alcohol.
M: The mouthfeel was on point. There's an excellent visocity, aftertaste, and an appropriately low level of carbonation (although the carbonation could be slightly higher).
D: So happy that pelican let's you order this by mail! Also, excited to try the 2009 perfect storm that I have sitting in my cellar at some point. 1,291 charactersglazeman, Dec 18, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Been waiting a long time for this one. Here's the deal - last year, 2009, I had my order form all filled out for a case of The Perfect Storm. Cases lasted for at least a week or so at the brewery. After mulling it over for a few days, I decided not to spend the cash on an entire case. I regretted that day until about two weeks ago when I got the call that it was my turn to buy a case of MoAS 2010. My second chance!! Glazeman and I were thrilled. I'm glad I took the opportunity this time. 
A - Very nice. Dark crimson with a lighter rose colored hue on the edges. Not brown. One finger head that fades to a rim of bubbles. 
S - Very complex. The bourbon, caramel, butter, florals, and BOOZE blend together beautifully. Earthy, citrus hops through out.
T - Rich and delicious. Cold Friday night watching the Blackhawks beat the Wings - for this occasion, this is the PERFECT brew. Bourbon through out. The front is candied almonds and the finish is burnt roasts. The hops are much more pronounced in the smell than in the taste. 
M - Really great for the style. I rarely rate generously in this category, but the flatness up front and the light bubbles near the finish do an excellent job of bringing all of the flavors to fruition. 
D - The taste of this beer is outstanding. I love it. That being said, it is really hot. Ton of booze. The alcohol burn limits the drinkability, but this is still an outstanding beer. 1,425 charactersairohead2001, Dec 18, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From 12/12/10 notes. Brought to a local tasting, poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 2010 MoaS vintage.
a - Pours a nice mahogany brown color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Leaves a little bit of lacing.
s - Smells of caramel malts, dark fruits, bourbon, molasses, oak, and light vanilla. I loved the smell; I thought it was very complex and balanced, and I didn't think the bourbon overpowered the nose. One of the better smelling barleywines I've had.
t - Tastes of bourbon, oak, molasses, caramel malts, dark fruits, chocolate, and light vanilla. Alcohol is definitely present, but again, not overpowering. I like it.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, very smooth and creamy. Feels amazing.
d - I thought this was a really good barleywine; one of the better ones I've had. I loved the nose and think for the ABV, it is pretty drinkable. Glad I've got some more of this, looking forward to holding onto most of them. 963 charactersmdfb79, Dec 16, 2010
3.84/5  rDev -13.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52010 bottling.
Black with no head. 
Nose is full sweet dark chcolate to sweet espresso with hints of cocoa that quickly goes to malty assertive whiskey and carmel. 
Mouthfeel is initially creamy but with a "fizzy" character on the tongue, some of which is a good deal of alcoholic heat and a strong whiskey mouth. Mouthfeel becomes richer and creamier and loses some of the whiskey heat without losing the character and flavors as it warms to room temperature and as it gets more air. 
This one, newly released, greatly improves from the air and is likely to become better with at least a little age. 
Flavor is rich and creamy and improves with a bit of time in the glass and improves with air. Flavors go from bitter black chocolate and hot whiskey to roasted grains and coffee with an assertive soy flavor. 
Air and some time in the glass really improves flavors to rich roasted grains, big black chocolate and coffee that goes to big black licorice nose and flavor profile. Black bitter coffee/espresso goes to an assertive licorice finish as one sips it. 1,065 charactersGRG1313, Dec 15, 2010

Beer poured into a Russian River glass. Beer is amber, dark, and mostly clear with a thin broken head of small bubbles, some lacing and low carbonation. Looks good.
Aroma is malty and warm with bourbon, liquor, oak and mild vanilla, smells nice.
It is a little warm at the lead off but overall its a medium bodied beer with sweetness and alcohol at the front. The palate opens up in the middle with oakiness and more sweetness, from the bourbon. The finish of the beer is clean and a little dry but it doesn't dry out my palate. It's big but the alcohol is balanced well with the flavors of the malt and the barrel character. It's very drinkable, although it is a sipper. 704 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 13, 2010
4/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours chestnut brown with reddish edges and a tan head that fades into nothing. Sweet lacing. Huge aroma of malt and booze, cherries, raisins, dark fruits. Big flavor, just really big sweet English toffee, malt, bourbon. A bit of hops keeps this from being the least bit cloying. A bit hot but balanced. Huge, bold flavors. Really similar to Wooden Hell and Bullfrog Old Toad. An English-style barleywine with heavy bourbon influence that remains balanced but is quite strong and boozy. Good stuff. 
Second bottle, opened 7/15/10. Pour is a fairly dark brown, not much head or lacing. Still quite boozy on the nose. Flavor has refined to a pretty nice chocolate liqueur thing going on. Of course it's malty, a bit boozy, but it's more refined now. Doesn't really have the fine pipe tobacco quality of Wooden Hell at this point. A fine beer though, and comparisons between the two are warranted.
Third bottle, from memory, amidst multiple elite barrel aged barley wines. This was also a 2009 bottle. Basically a bit more muddled with age, more chocolate and oxidation going on. Not even in the same ballpark as Wooden Hell, which was also involved. Too much barrel, too muddled, not much intersting nuance anymore. Fine, but not world class. 1,242 charactersJAXSON, Dec 13, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I couldn't resist opening this today. The biggest blizzard in decades calls for the biggest barleywine in the cellar, and the name is too fitting. 2009 release. 
A. Poured at cellar temps into a snifter. One finger head for the better part of a minute amazingly, but then it disappears. Oily consistency on the sides of the glass. Color proves to be a dark ruby when help to the light, but approaches black in the glass. 
S. Just smelling this warms me up. The bourbon is the attention getter, but it remains mellow. Strong dessert sweetness - toffee, vanilla... Very appealing. 
T&M. There is a ton of bourbon - it tastes closer to bourbon than barley wine honestly, but it remains balanced. The smoothness helps here, as do the complementing malt aspects that shine through. Without the bourbon this would probably be cloyingly sweet, but here the alcohol cuts right through it to the point where it almost seems dry. 
D. This is intense. 22 ounces never looked like so much, but this is a perfect beer to sip on for hours and wait out a storm... 1,052 charactersdougofthefuture, Dec 12, 2010

09 Perfect Storm.
Dec 11th in MN. Was going to have something else tonight, trapped in the house, but I couldn't resist the symbolism of this one.
Thanks for the trade, ramnuts.
Pour is darker than expected. Deep, dark red brown. Nice carbonation that quickly recedes to the edge. 
Smells are just so wonderful. Bourbon smacks you in the face, mingled with dark carmels and alcohol.(good, spicy, warming alcohol) Bourbon is strong in this one. 
The bourbon is marvelous on the tongue. Defines the beer. Everything else plays a supporting role. Carmel, some sweet (dark) chocolate, dark fruits and tobacco. Ultimately sweet, but not cloying; balances the sharp boozy feel. (This must have been pretty hot early on.) Feels more than 13.5%. 
Mouthfeel is great. This finishes like scotch or whiskey, sharp and tingly on the tongue. I like it. I like it a lot. 
 Wonderful example of what the barrel offers. 1,170 characterscaskstrength, Dec 11, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle into a snifter, 2010 Mother of all Storms vintage - Thank you Pelican for selling these to mail order customers!
A: Pours a deep mahogany with a medium dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. One of the darkest barleywines I've ever seen.
S: The aromas coming from the glass are excellent. Lots of toffee, vanilla, bourbon, and malt. 
T: The taste is buttery toffee, vanilla, and a roasty malt flavor. There are lots of oak and tannin flavors in there as well. The finish is incredibly complex and changes as it develops. Lots of sweet flavors and some roasty flavors that balance them out. There's a bit of hops on the finish as well but only enough to let you know they're there.
M: The feel is thick and creamy with an excellent amount of carbonation.
D: One of the best barleywines I've ever had, barrel aged or not, and definitely lives up to the hype. I can't wait to see how this one develops over time.
After having the regular Stormwatcher's I can say that the barrel has done wonders here. The harsh licorice and roasted flavors are smoothed out and the beer greatly improves. 1,140 charactersGregSVT, Dec 11, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge malty thanks to lothore for this bottle via trade. I traded for this in ignorance, just figuring it was another decent barrel-aged barleywine, not knowing that it was bringing in a king's ransom. Lothore, I owe you one. 2009 vintage of "The Perfect Storm" bottle split with my wife on a bitterly cold Minnesota evening. 
Pours light black, with surging, bubbling, turgid red snapping around the edges of the goblet. The smell is a slapshot of bourbon. I tried really hard, honest, but that's all I could come up with. But it's a really nice smell, somehow dominant without being overwhelming. 
The Perfect Storm radiates warmth like an Amish fireplace. Booziness soaks into the pores before anything else is evident. Then the beer unfolds like a spring rose in my warm, welcoming mouth. Big caramel notes waltz with great shots of sweet, sweet malts. Drying oak is sly enough that I almsot missed it, but upon recognition, it's evident in every sip. Vanilla, figgishness or something, round out the sample, before the bourbon steps back in front for one last curtain call. 
Strong. Wicked. Thick enough that if it weren't so good, I'm pretty sure I could dump my motor oil & use this. Despite the freak-show ABV & heavy-heavy-monster-mash sparks The Perfect Storm throws off, I could sip this all night. Or as long as my night would last. Not very. 
This did not disappoint. A masterpiece that I'm intensely happy I've been able to sample, & now I'm really looking forward to the new batch of Mother of All Storms! 1,523 charactersmaximum12, Dec 09, 2010

Head doesn't last long due to the alcohol content, leaving a clean looking deep dense off black body the color of mahogony with a thin ring around the edge of this 3oz snifter.
The barrel influence smells amazing, clean crisp heat rising up mixed with perfect caramel candy and toffee and maple.
Incredible rich flavors of Oak and other woods more sappy, and Vanilla with rich dark Molasses and melted caramel, and smooth bourbon with just a hint of courseness,and lightly sugar coated dried fruits, incredible smoothness and complexity for an 13% beer.
I got 2 bottles, one for tonight and another for aging, but i am going to absolutly have to get more, this is an amazing beer, maybe the very best BarleyWine i've ever had...i should say most likely the best...most likely the best beer period.
I sipped these 22oz for the better part of 4 hours, and still at the end it was exciting to raise the snifter to my lips. incredible. i'm a harsh reviewer, but i'm strongly considering all 5s...next bottle(someday)will decide. 1,206 charactersChadQuest, Dec 04, 2010

a: Dark brown/amber with light tan head. Closest to black I've seen for a barleywine (that wasn't a black barleywine).
s: Quite intense vanilla/coconut bourbon barrel smell to it; caramel/toffee malt.
t: Heavy bourbon barrel tone; I'd say probably the closest to bourbon I've tasted from a beer. A bit of darker fruits also present along with the caramel malts. Quite a bit of alcohol noticeable.
M: Thick chewy mouthfeel; as expected for a barleywine like this.
D: Sipper for sure. Quite boozy.
A very intense brew. Bourbon lovers rejoice. I felt like it was on the edge of being a tad too boozy for me though. 641 charactersbillyshears, Nov 24, 2010

a: This was a dark, chestnut brown and it poured with a large off-white cap.
s: Perfect barrel aged b-wine aroma. Plenty boozy but in an aromatic way, it wasn't at all hot. Lots of caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla, raisins, borbon, and a touch of oak. Not subtle in the least.
t: Incredibly rich overall, there are so many bold flavors here its almost overwhelming. There were stronger raisin and dark fruit flavors present than is typical for a BA barleywine, yet the bourbon flavors were quite strong as well. This was sweet without being cloying. Flavors of caramel, molasses, and vanilla were all prominent. There was even some chocolate coming through. 
m: Big, sticky body with fairly active, creamy carbonation.
d: This absolutely lives up the hype. Thanks Ed, for advising me to wait until this had a year on it. It was worth it. 924 charactersDIM, Oct 21, 2010

A: Super deep dark ruby red with an interesting mocha and blood red blend colore head that fades quickly to a lace atop the brew. Good.
S: Not hard to get good scents on this one. I get sugary malt which blends into almost a grape juice scent. Quickly following comes some breadiness and booziness with some caramel on the backend. I get some port, faints hints of cocao and chocolate, some faint butterscotch and hints of raisin. Very good.
T: Hmm, a very unique blend of flavors on this one. Very syrupy at first bringing forth flavors of some toffee, caramel, followed by a tight booze bite. I get dark fruit and hints of port in the middle with almost a cranberry breadiness on the backend. Super thick brew. It's very sweet and sticky with a warming booze bite, but not overwhelmingly sweet. The sweetness is quickly dulled by the carbonation burn. Good.
M: Full bodied and very syrupy with a thick carbonation feel. Leaves some awesome flavors on your palate. Very good.
D: Drinkability is not as good as you would've liked due to the heavy booze bite. Decent.
All in all, this brew is good, but did not blow me away. I would definitely try it again if I got the chance, but I have to say, from the hype, I am a little disappointed. Definitely try this if you like your beers boozy, BIG, and sweet, but if you don't like that, then don't worry about this one. I'm definitely a BIG beer person, so I do definitely think this is solid, but not mind blowing. 1,639 characterssteve8robin, Oct 17, 2010

Sampled side by side with '08 and '09 Stormwatcher.
Pours deep red with a descent tannish head.. 
Nose shows lots of caramel and toasty malts... good vanilla and barrel presence in the aroma.
Flavor has big bourbon right up front that melt quickly into the expected rich traditional BW flavors... toffee.. caramel.. toasty malts... bits of cherry.. the vanilla comes back in swinging on the finish... with warmth obvious oaky tannins help keep it from getting too sweet.... very smooth medium body with persistent small bubble carbonation.

A: Effectively opaque brown body with ruby highlights. Not much carbonation, but what do you expect in such a huge beer?
S: Hugely toasty, sweet nose of lightly oxidized barleywine goodness. Caramel, toffee, vanilla, oak, some light, candied fruit. A little over the top - but isn't that what you want?
T: Big, sweet, and oaky. Everything you'd expect; nothing you wouldn't. Great beer.
M: Full body with some spiky carbonation - more than I expected based on the pour and the ABV. Pretty good.
D: Not great, but what could be at 13%?
Notes: Super special thanks to Tony for magnanimously opening this amazing and sought-after beer with us. I only wish we'd had it earlier in the night, when my experience wouldn't have been quite as hazy. Drunkenness didn't keep this from being a memorable experience, though. I can't wait to get to try this beer again, preferably with some more age on it. The astronomical ABV could use some time to tone down, even though it's delicious enough to drink wantonly as is.

4.33/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4From BeerAdvocate Magazine #73 (Feb 2013):
While it may be English is style it displays a bit of rebellious Americana with the bourbon barrel aged character. Much mellower than previous years, not saying it is any less flavorful but perhaps a bit easy going on the palate. So many layers, very complex and with each sip comes a new nuance to pick out. Exceptional. 
STYLE: American Barleywine
ABV: 14.0%
AVAILABILITY: Limited
LOOK: Dark brown, red glow, minimal lace, has legs
SMELL: Wood, toffee, barrel juice, fusel, figgy, sweet, very aromatic
TASTE: Chewy, creamy, full bodied, toffee, toasted wood, vanilla, boozy, rose water, ripe cherries, christmas pudding, brown sugar, hint of spiciness, woody dryness, roasted cocoa nibs, semi-sweet finish
-----------------
From BeerAdvocate Magazine Volume III, Issue II:
You can hear the head crackle as the remnant fusel oils lower it quickly, not uncommon depending on the freshness of the barrel from spirit to beer. Mahogany darkness in the glass, good clarity when brought to the light. Big bourbon nose from the first whiff, boozy with charred wood and vanilla. Some caramel and ripe fruitiness in the aroma as well. Semi-syrupy, full body; prickly, moderate carbonation. The taste buds scream of bourbon from the first sip--soon after is the Barleywine alcohol with its fruity esters that tag along with the fusel bourbon character. Sweet maltiness plays off of the note of vanilla. Modest hopping, though the alcohol and wood keep any trait from going cloyingly sweet. The wood flavor actually cuts deeper than we thought, but not to the point of puckering, just at a perfect level. Finishes with some residual sweetness, peppery alcohol and a smack of wood.
Nothing subtle about this beer. If you are going to name a beer "The Perfect Storm," it better live up to it, and Pelican without a doubt came through. Beer geeks, hunt this one down. 1,906 charactersBeerAdvocate, Sep 10, 2010

Poured from a 22oz bottle into my De Dolle large snifter. Pours a dark brownish' black in color, basically no light is shining through...just a slight tinge of red torwards the rim. About a finger size tan head rises, and quickly dissipates. Leaves basically no lacing.
Aroma screams of booze! Bourbon of course, some raisins, belgian yeasts, dark fruits.
Flavor is great! -but potent! Wow, tons of booze in this one. I would imagine with a couple years, this would mellow out great! A sipper in current condition for me. Loads of bourbon, big over ripe fruits like raisins and figs. Taste overall is very sweet with a strong sharpness due to the 13.5% abv. Medium to full body, low carbonation...heat from the ABV, which is noticable on the lips too after each sip. A great beer, and definitely stoked I got the chance to try this beer! 924 charactersShadesOfGray, Aug 03, 2010

Poured a dark brown with mahogany highlights with a thin head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. Big caramel aromas up front with a good amount of bourbon that also had vanilla accents and slight oakiness. The flavor was big on the caramel as well with vanilla accents and large bourbon notes busting through that made the taste a little heavier alongside slight oak and raisins. The beer was full bodied with a low amount of carbonation that had a swet silky boozy finish. Very good barleywine and was very happy to try out at least once. The drinkability was pretty good considering the ABV on the brew. 649 charactersGobzilla, Jun 30, 2010

The alcohol is far from hidden. Starts with a great in depth complex barleywine style and is followed by some bourbon integration, but the finish is just so sweet and hot. My belly is just filled with alcohol. I can see how many people would love this beer, but it's far from being a finessful drinkable beer. 614 charactersTrueRates, Jun 27, 2010

A: Pours a very dark ruby/brown. Hard to tell in this glass, although I would guess it to be only slightly cloudy. Almost non-existent head hints toward low carbonation. 
S: Rich bourbon and caramel layers greet the nose. Vanilla/oak makes an appearance as well. Spirit-like boozy character works itself in well. Very well integrated, reminds me of Central Waters BBBW, but perhaps a bit heavier on the malt and easier on the hops. 
T: Sweet caramel and vanilla up front, moving along to intense but not overwhelming (or cloying) layers of sweet caramel flavour. Bourbon comes near the finish, cleansing the palate with a spirit-like dryness. 
M: While initially it seems a bit thick, it proceeds to glide along with a velvetesque smoothness. A little sticky, but near perfect for a beasty barleywine such as this. 
D: Fantastic for the style. It integrates the alcohol very well with the varieties of flavour. The carbonation is very accommodating as well. A storm I would gladly weather when reaching for a big brew such as this. Delicious. 1,121 charactersdarklordlager, Jun 25, 2010

Taste: Toffee, up front, with the dried fruit (fig and golden raisin) flavors prominent; by mid-palate, the coconut and vanilla make a brief appearance, only to be overwhelmed by the boozy bourbon flavors; after the swallow, the bourbon persists but it masterfully incorporates some of the more subtle elements
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation and plenty of warmth

M: feels thick and syrupy with a medium carbonation that tingles my tongue. 
D: a big time sipper but that was ok since it became much more complex as it warmed up. The alcohol was very noticeable as it warms the mouth and throat. That being said, it was extremely smooth for 13.5%abv. 
Overall, I'm very happy to have gotten the chance to try this amazing barleywine. One of the best I have ever had. Very much worth the Darkness I gave up to get it in trade. 1,035 charactersCosmoHopHead, May 21, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Dark brown color with a one finger tan head with poor retention. Smells of bourbon, vanilla, caramel. toffee, and some oak. A very nice aroma. 
The flavor is just what I expected, Toffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and oak combine to make a malt lovers dream. Sweet, and a bit too boozy in my opinion.
Full bodied, rich, creamy, with a surprisingly high amount of carbonation. At the very least, the carbonation is higher than I expected it to be. This is a nice, drinkable Barleywine, which I am glad I had the chance to try. 528 charactershardy008, May 16, 2010

A- Ruby/rust brown, 2cm head that is the color of cornbread. Settles quickly. 
S- Bourbon! Rich, buttery, caramel, toffee, some dark fruit underneath it. A hint of vanilla and molasses. Not boozy in the least, which is impressive for 13+%.
T- Bourbon is here in full force, but there's a good, strong barleywine here as well. Dark fruit, a bit of brandy, and of course bourbon. A bit woody, and a bit hot from the boubon... wonderful. Molasses as opposed to caramel. 
M- A bit hot, slightly spicy, great bourbon and fruit notes, wonderfully blended. A masterful beer.
D- Moderate but oh-so-tasty. I am really impressed, this is deserved of all its praise. A world-class barleywine. I'm not the biggest bal-aged advocate but when done this well it's a no-brainer. I like my beers hot if done well, and this one is perfection. Awesome stuff. 922 charactersShogoKawada, May 08, 2010
2.86/5  rDev -35.3%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Incredibly disappointed in this one. I reviewed batch #2, perhaps batch #1 was much better.
Appearance: Decent enough, rich, deep mahogany brown with a big head.
Smell: Booze (not really bourbon), oak (more like oak chips in a cheap chardonnay), vanilla, toffee, caramel, and chocolate.
Taste: Train wreck of the flavors mentioned above. Booze intersecting with too much oak and brandy, along with chocolate, toffee, raisins, prunes, butterscotch, caramel, and vanilla. WAY to sweet.
Mouthfeel: medium-to full body, a bit to sticky sweet. Booze is way too hot.
Drinkability: Boozy mess (didn't notice bourbon), too sweet and too much oak. I don't get what I am missing that makes others like this one so. 709 characterscraytonic, May 03, 2010

The aroma is full of dark fruitiness heading into solid boozy nose searing heat at the end of the draw. The taste is smooth and sweet with prunes, ripe plums and raisins. By midway solid heat like booze tries to take over the flavor right into the finish. Very nice stuff that could use a few years of aging to bring it into perfection. 456 charactersBigMcLargeHuge, May 03, 2010
3.6/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Thanks to milwaukeeclassic for the share.
Bomber split three ways. Pours still, with little action and a head that sinks immediately. 
Vanilla and 31 flavors Dr. Pepper bourbon, incredibly hot on the nose. What remains of my nostrilical follicles is now destroyed.
Bourbon heat is a meaty punch in the chest. Caramel sweet maltiness and vanilla try to take hold, but are repeatedly beaten down by alcoholic heat. This beer is unrelenting.
Carbonation is non existent, which is stylistically appropriate, but doesn't help the drinkability or the experience. Really, really hot.
A real sipper and not one that I would seek out again. Big props to Duane for the opportunity, but this didn't meet the hype. 707 charactersBarrytheBear, May 01, 2010

The perfect beer for a lightening lit sky. Its storming here now as I drink this. Thought it was only fitting to open her up.
Poured from the 2009 bottle into an oversized snifter. A semi hard pour makes about a half inch of tan head. Receding to leave a collar. Color is a murky darker brown. Not the most attractive beer to look at and thats ok because it smells wonderful.
Aroma is very intriguing. Sweet mildly roasty with a bit of chocolate, distant chocolate really. Dark fruit is plentiful, figs, rasins, plum. Burnt caramel toffee is jumping from the glass with a buttery sweetness. Booze soaked wood, more wood then booze. A good amount of vanilla, some breadyness with kind of a belgian yeasty aroma too. Its bready, it just seems to hold a kind of belgian funky spice to it. 
Aroma is very well balanced, no cloying alcohol heat, which is amazing for the 13.5% abv. It does not seem that high off the nose.
Taste is also quite good bordering the amazing. Heat here is much more pronounced, but not in a burning alcohol solvent flavor. Its more of the boozy kind. Its warm, you know its there, but it does not overwhelm the other flavors, its still balanced. The booze contains both wood and grain alcohol flavor, also a mild spice, similar to cracked peppercorn.
But starting out its mostly sweet with toffee, vanilla (quite a bit of vanilla) and a mild roasty chocolate grain flavor. Hops do not reveal themselves to me in this one and that is just fine. The other flavors a mingling well and provide me with intense satisfaction...I dont need the hops right now.
Mouthfeel is slick with a light syrup texture and mild carbonation. Not flat though, just silky smooth.
Drinkability is obviosly cut down by the warmth and the large flavors here. Its definatly a sipper. A good after dinner drink that can be enjoyed for a long period over a nice conversation. 
Great beer guys, this being my first from the brewery. Loved it!
Returning to flavor as its been some time since I opened this and completed the review: Hops do provide a mild bittering long after the sip lingering slightly with a touch of pine.
Thank you Grant! 2,171 charactersBuebie, May 01, 2010

A-	Very dark viscous brown. Hues of red come through when the sunlight hits it. It has a very rich coloring. Little to no head. 
S- Lots of Toffee and Molasses in the nose with plenty of dark fruits also. The roasted malts come through on the end. Bourbon and oak pull through warning you of the immense flavor about to come.
T- This is a huge beer. Lots of sweet roasted caramel flavor. It's a very sweet burnt sugar flavor up front which moves to a darker more complex flavor towards the end. Raisins a figs play out the dark fruit notes as the beer starts to warm up. The vanilla and Bourbon complement the finish quite well.
M-	Quite nice, enough carbonation to keep the beer from muddying up the tongue. Thick and smooth are about the only way to sum it up
O- This beer is huge. Lots of flavor through all its complexities. The alcohol is just enough to be noticed and not too much to be overpowering. A 10oz pour out me back, defiantly a beer to share. Will be seeking out more. 1,134 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Apr 28, 2010

4.79/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thought the Stormwatcher barleywine was amazing, so I'm more than a little curious to try this highly-praised barrel-aged version. Thanks a zillion to msubulldog25 for the chance.
Pours a glimmering toasted gold head, which lasts about a minute and isn't all that thick, but at 13.5%, hey, no problem. Colors is an extremely dark brown with dark rusted hues. 
The aroma is a thing of wonder, a surprisingly subtle meeting between vanilla, toffee, caramel, whiskey-soaked wood (more wood than whiskey), dark cherry, cinnamon roll, sherry and graham cracker. Considering the hefty alcohol content, and the fact this sat in bourbon barrels four months before bottling, the smell of alcohol is hardly cloying here. Amazing.
Taste offers a wide variety of impressions, all of them good. First, it's nice this still resembles a barleywine, rather than teetering too far into the bourbon and/or wood part of its character. Those elements simply lift the barleywine up into a new plateau, while the original Stormwatcher's intense flavors of caramel and toffee reign over the tongue. Toasted malt threads deep into the flavor, and there's a healthy splash of vanilla as well. Plum, raisin, and fig roar big and bold here too. Tons of balance, incredible depth of flavor, and an insanely well-incorporated 13.5% alcohol. There's something here, possibly the yeast, that occasionally reminds of a big Belgian dark ale. Toffee, caramel, dark fruit and mellow bourbon-soaked wood all carry through in the finish. Malt-lovers rejoice.
Texturally it's fairly sticky, full-bodied, big and round; a rather chewy feel that perfectly fits the flavor profile.
Kudos, Pelican. I'll still be savoring this two hours from now, no doubt. A slow-sipper, one to be taken slowly and respectfully. Simply one of the best beers I've ever had, and I'm far from a bourbon aficionado. I was hoping the bourbon wouldn't overtake what was one of my favorite barleywines, and it doesn't. And I would've easily believed this was in the 9-10% range, judging by what's going on in the flavor. Uh, hey Brian, you have 10 more of these to send my way? :) 2,121 charactersMetalmonk, Apr 13, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Trey is the hero of barrel-aged beers, as he broke out another one for our epic tasting. This bottle was from 2009, consumed on 3/28/10.
This beer is a beautiful deep ruby brown in color, capped by a dark ring of head and wispy bubbles on the surface. There is no lacing to speak of, but go figure at 13.5%.
The bouquet is characterized by the nutty malt taste that I have grown accustomed to in English barleywines, as well as a huge barrel presence. There is a lot of whiskey in the nose, and it brings with it a big alcohol warmth. The flavor comes right along those same lines. No real surprise here. The whiskey comes right out. If you don't like big whiskey flavors, keep this in the cellar for two more years...at least. The nutty maltiness is phenomenally done, and in a couple of years, the flavor will balance out and be truly amazing.
Warm and almost too boozy, but this is one incredible smooth beer. Not harsh by any stretch of the imagination. I would love to have another shot at this a year or two down the road, because this is filled with potential. 1,070 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 08, 2010

It created one of those rare "wow" moments, as I casually grabbed the glass and started walking, only to stop short, turn around, sit down and start paying attention. 
Reddish brown in color, nice thick tan head, good retention and lacing. 
the aroma suggests the malt assault that is coming, as expected for a british style barleywine; toffee and butterscotch, sweet, dark fruits, some oak and vanilla, brandy. 
On the palate this is incredibly rich, velvety with a very longlasting afterflavor. Sweetish but never too much. Malts abound, balanced somewhat by a nice booziness that is never too hot. vanilla, brandy, dark fruits, lots of toffee and butterscotch. 
A very impressive barleywine, british style as I prefer, need to get myself more of this. An excellent sipper. 866 charactersbrdc, Apr 06, 2010

A - Very deep brown, with reddish hints on the end. Small head, not much, which disappeared quickly.
S - Roasted malts, there is not hops in this like I was expecting. Big molassas and toffee smells. Actually smells a bit like a quad with thie dark fruit smell. Very nice.
T - Great dark fruit taste, mostly raisins and figs. Carmel, toffee, and great cocoa/molassas mix in there. Some interesting bitter hops bite right on the end that only became noticable later after I was drinking it. Some nicely hidden vanilla on the end as well.
M - Nicely carbonated, nice little bight on it in a full bodied beer.
D - Shockingly drinkable with the high ABV. It's still a bit of a sipper, but it's something you can down easily all things considered. 783 charactersAgentZero, Apr 04, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Trey was kind enough to share another one of these this past weekend.
Brilliant ruby red with crimson highlights, this beer has an exquisite color.
The nose is big on bourbon with a boozy character. Brown sugar, caramel and some nuttiness are present along with a little coffee. The palate opens big and boozy. Burnt sugar, caramel, toffee, nuts and an astringency akin to nut skins are present. Bourbon, vanilla and oak are quite prominent in the mid-palate, and the finish is mildly drying and boozy. Medium-high in body, low in carbonation with a decent finish, this is great stuff. I can't wait to see how this evolves.
**Edit 27 Oct 2012**
2009 release.
The nose is still pretty big and boozy, with a fairly strong bourbon character. Not yet oxidized (neither pleasantly nor unpleasantly), there isn't much sherry, though there is a moderate date and toffee character. Brown sugar, burnt sugar and some caramel round out the nose. The bourbon is mostly booze with some vanilla and brown sugar in there. The palate is thoroughly enjoyable, a moderate bourbon, date and brown sugar character coming through up front. The mid-palate has the burnt sugar and toffee flavors, and the bitterness from the burnt sugar comes in here. This also does amplify the mild astringency that alcohol can impart. Boozy on the finish with a nice burnt sugar bittersweet character, some toffee and a blend of dates and a little raisin character, this is quite enjoyable. Medium in body with a carbonation level that is initially too high, but when it does die down, the beer is immensely more enjoyable. This seems to be aging well.
3.5/4/4.5/4/4
**Edit 08 Feb 2014**
2010 release. 
Less almond-like, more hazelnut like, with a simpler, brown sugar/ toffee aroma. Oxidation is starting to take a hold here, lending some sherry notes that work well with the nutty booziness. Booze is dying down, bringing out the malt a little bit more. A touch flabby on the finish. Solid stuff. 1,970 charactersDefenCorps, Apr 01, 2010

A - Poured a really deep, dark brown liquid with burgundy highlights and a wispy burnt tan head that diminished into a thin ring of retention and left virtually no lacing. 
S - Aroma is quite chocolatey with woody notes and a warm bourbon presence. The nose is rounded out with hints of dark fruit and earthy hops. 
T - Like the aroma, chocolate dominates the flavor profile (especially in the backend as the liquid warmed up) although the bourbon presence is really apparent, imparting a huge amount of alcohol warmth. Finishes with a blend of earthy, herbal and woody hop notes amid all of the boozy attributes.
M - Medium bodied with a thick, robust and syrupy texture and prickly carbonation. Sticky and boozy mouthfeel overall with a burning sensation on the lips and tip of the tongue. Finishes dry with a really warm, boozy presence, which delivers quite a bit of heat to the palate. 
D - While this is a very good barleywine in its own right, I am perplexed that this is a top ten beer and (at the time of my review) the highest rated barleywine on BA. I can think of several others that were more enjoyable. Some that come to mind are: Midnight Sun Arctic Devil, Cambridge Blunderbus, and Bullfrog Whiskey BA Old Toad. 1,286 charactersffejherb, Mar 21, 2010

The beer is dark mahogany color, brown with a ruby shade to it when held up to the light, with about 1 finger of tan foam. The beer smells strong and rich, lots of malty sweetness with toffee, dark fruit, and only a little bit of bourbon. The taste is all of the above, rich and complex, sweet with a burning aftertaste. The definition of a malt bomb.
The body is medium-plus, low but peppery carbonation. This beer is massive, glad to have the chance to try it. 625 charactersTurdFurgison, Mar 16, 2010

A: The barleywine is a coffee look-alike, dark and brown and opaque. The depth of color makes me think of a stout. Surprisingly, at least to me, there is really no head whatsoever. All that remains, from first pour to last sip, is a miniscule off-white band.
S: The nose has plenty of toffee to go around. The malts are unmistakable, thick and rich. I'd even posit that molasses is sitting there. There really isn't any indication of a barrel.
T: The barleywine is very hot, leaving a burning sensation with each sip. The booze can't hide amongst the excessive malts. Those malts have toffee and molasses, paired with some chocolate, and are heavily roasted. Very thick, I feel like I should be chewing what is in my glass. As in the nose, there really isn't anything that screams barrel, or even barrel-blended.
M: Beware the heat, this baby isn't afraid to drop the booze on you. The maltiness is blindingly thick, drowning out any barrel and any real enjoyment.
D: Number 10 (as of right now)? Really? Give me JW Lee's Harvest Ale or Gratitude any time of this. Too messy, I just can't get into it. 1,177 charactersakorsak, Mar 12, 2010

4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz. bottle with a gold foil cap courtesy of dregs78 - thanks for the longtime want, man. 2009 vintage, poured in to a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a deeply hued Tuscan rosewood, or a singed burgundy, and my first thought upon holding it up to the light is that the color of this beer is about as dark as it could possibly be while: 1) still being crystal clear; but also 2) still allowing enough light through that you can actually determine that it is indeed transparent. Some barleywines are unfiltered, others too dark to tell if they're filtered or not - TPS lies at what is truly a gorgeous intersection. A terra cotta head three-quarters of a finger tall sits atop the the smoked ruby-imbued body, and though the center of the mass collapses fairly quickly - leaving a caldera populated by a few dashes of surface detritus - its rim is dense, creamy, almost whipped in texture, with impressive stick such that it almost imperceptibly climes up the circumference of the tulip. The infrequence of random, moderately paced bubbles is outmatched only by the infrequence of spots of lace on the sides of the tulip once the drink begins. A gentle and understated but subtly masterful beginning.
Aroma: TPS smells dark. It smells earthy. It smells woody. It smells ... wonderful. The first note that greets my nose is a healthy amount of smoke, which is likely more a testament to the relative lack of smoke and smoked meats in my diet than the proportion of the malt bill occupied by smoked malts. Barrel notes are not far behind, contributing toasted coconut in spades, flanked on both sides by vanilla bean. The whiskey component is really almost understated, dull in a pleasant way by virtue of it being buried beneath a sea of dark toffee, blackstrap molasses, sweet chocolate, brown sugar, crème brûlée, tobacco, black cherries, raisins, and leather. Heavy complexity in this one.
Taste: Make that stunning complexity. The array of flavors here is mindboggling. Lord only knows how many malts went in to this malt bill. Lightly caramelized biscuity malts to just-south-of-burned toast mark the bookends of a range of notes that includes cocoa, toffee, butterscotch, huge brown sugar and molasses, and crystallized caramel. Filling in the interstices is every imaginable permutation of drupes - cherries, plums, blackberries - and dark fruits - raisins being the prime culprit, though prunes and figs also feature prominently. Add to this panoply vanilla, coconut (I know, I know, also a drupe, but it didn't seem appropriate mentioning it above), a far fainter amount of smoke than I initially detected in the nose, a ton of leafy, sticky, sweaty tobacco, a sizable quantity of herbal bitterness, and the ever-more-prominent (as it warms) Evan Williams contribution. My one comment about the whiskey contribution here is that I'm thoroughly impressed with how long it took me to remark upon it. It was almost imperceptible in the nose, even though I served this one at about 10 degrees F below room temperature. And it took a good 45 minutes out of the bottle (nearly 2 hours out of the fridge) before the taste approached anything I would describe as "near-dominant." 
Mouthfeel: The body of TPS is here, yet the carbonation seems to be a little "off." That is, what I would hope would be a thick, chewy, creamy barleywine is indeed thick - waves of massive, saccharine caramelized sugars coat the tongue with every sip. It's also chewy - the sheer volume of the malt bill and the accompanying hop kick make this one bold, large, biting brew. But it's not quite creamy. The carbonation seems a little spritzy, too crisp, and even the density of this body can't hold up to it, which is surprising because it doesn't seem "overcarbonated." It's just that minimal agitation makes for sort of a fluffy, erratic mouth. Not terrible, and it does improve as the carbonation begins to escape, but not out of this world.
Drinkability: This is a beer to savor, and this is so for two primary reasons: 1) it's 13.5% abv, and anything that's 13.5% abv is something to savor, or else you'll end up on your ass; and 2) there's too much going on here for even a 22 oz. bottle spread over 3+ hours to expose. The drinkability of this one surely gets knocks for the abv% - and also for what is, relatively speaking, a pretty large amount of free sweetness - but these can't stand in the way of what is truly a remarkably complex and amazing brew. In many ways, this reminds me of Bourbon Barrel Angel's Share - boundless intricacies in a spirit-infused package (only, with carbonation). This one's worth seeking out. 4,612 charactersCrellMoset, Feb 18, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5NOMMM!
Appearance: Pours a deep but amazingly crystal clear color that appears to be near pitch black (or a very dark brown) at first, but when held to the light is almost exactly a ruby or burgundy color. Pours with nearly a finger of head, which dissipates quickly, leaving first a film over the top of the brew, and then the finest ring of creamy tan bubbles around the edge of the glass. These fine bubbles show up in the lacing as well, which glitters down the side of the glass immediately following the liquid. There's a tiny patch of bubbles near the center of the top of the glass that floats around, dare I say, in almost the shape of a hurricane, which is an interesting coincidence given this one's name. Beautiful and glassy as it warms.
Smell: The smell is phenomenal. Heavy candy and dark fruit notes are dominant, with caramel, molasses, and toffee very strong, as well as spicy rum soaked raisins and prunes. There's a strong grape presence, between the raisins, notes of white grapes, and a somewhat strong undercurrent of red wine. Barrel and earth notes are also dominant, which is very nice. The nose on this one, at first scent, reminded me of Firestone 13, which I think is interesting if only because I tried the aforementioned beer only once, at a tasting, and didn't have a whole lot of it. Spicy, but not in an overbearing, hot way--reminiscent at once of both cinnamon-and-clove spiced fruits and breads as well as a cool, minty spiciness. This all, of course, is tempered by the candy notes, including a nice syrupy vanilla note as well as a hint of pancake syrup (it's a bit too sugary to come across as maple). There's even--albeit when agitated--a slightly sour note, perhaps of lime, which fits in surprisingly well with the nose overall. As it warms, and after I've tasted it, I get a blackberry note out of it as well. Well done.
Taste: The taste on this one is huge. What at first hits you in the face are heavy spice and alcohol notes--though the alcohol is nicely blended in, well-hidden, and only warm in the slightest bit. And there are all kinds of spices--there's the spearmint and wintergreen minty notes that were present in the nose, and heavy clove spice, as well as some anise and licorice (moving to the lighter side of things) but there are also the caramel and vanilla sweet candy (though far less dominant here than in the nose, this still makes up a fair share of the flavor of this brew) as well as raisin and dark fruit notes, and maybe even the slightest hint of blueberry (though it's hard to get this due to all the syrupy notes that are heavy in this one). Rum and whiskey flavors are strong. Tastes more and more like candy as the flavors set into your palate, and exponentially so as it warms.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel functions just about perfectly in this brew. Initially, the crisp carbonation bubbles are plentiful and deliver the spicy flavors to the top of the brew, and then calm down to allow the deeper, darker candy and fruit notes to shine through. It's alcoholic and heavy bodied all the way through, but the aftertaste leaves only the slightest hint as to its actual alcohol content. Chewy like caramel, which runs consistent with the rest of the characteristics of this brew. Wonderfully balanced. I can't think of how the mouthfeel on this one could be improved beyond what it is right now.
Drinkability: It is a rare occasion that I give a beer with a 13.5% ABV anything above a 4. Why is this? Because, I don't care how well the alcohol is hidden for the ABV percentage, at some point, you usually are still going to be tasting quite a bit of alcohol, and the drinkability will consequently be hampered quite a bit regardless of relative ABV and style considerations. I make an exception, today, for The Perfect Storm, because, well, The Perfect Storm is EXTREMELY drinkable for its ABV, with little to no alcohol heat (and on top of that, tastes delicious). I want to drink this one all night, and extremely glad to be splitting this one with CrellMoset, who is almost certainly saving me from drinking to excess this evening. Pick this up by any means necessary. As a side note, this one pairs well with an extra sharp cheddar (due to the strength of the cheese) but I've also got some creamier cheeses out (havarti and fontina) which more than hold their own with this brew. Excellent. 4,370 charactersafausser, Feb 18, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is my third bottle, decided it was finally time to put down a review.
Looks quite good -- dark brown that glows red when held up to the light. Very thin head quickly dissipates leaving a few large bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. Smell is huge, tons of caramel and vanilla, touches of bourbon, burnt sugar and soy sauce -- taste is somehow even bigger, lots of grain to go with the caramel and toffee, more soy sauce and the slight sour tinge that comes from a old ale that's been left alone for long enough. Mouthfeel is creamy/silky with a slight slickness. Carbonation is slight but detectable.
This... tastes like an incredibly well-aged beer. I would love to know how they got this perfect oxidization in a beer that's a year old (brewed winter '09). Only concern I have is that bottle-to-bottle has slight variations -- my guess is that it's in-the-bottle stable, but the level of dissolved oxygen in the blend is tweaking the flavor.
Going to hold on to my last couple until I know whether or not I can get more next year... 1,050 charactersjedwards, Feb 16, 2010

A: Poured into the closest thing I could find to a snifter, a stemless wine glass that is pretty close in shape. The color is kind of a dark raison and the head is rather subdued. This does not come to much of a surprise considering the high ABV. A nice burnt mocha ring persists on the outside of the glass. Lacing is subpar and an almost saliva like half moon 
S: The barrel-aging is real apparent in this one, bourbon, dry oak, vanilla, sweetness, and alcohol.
T: This is one big beer, the ABV is more noticeable in the back of the throat than on the tongue. The beer has a lot of flavor to it: bourbon, coffee, cocoa, old grapes...all intense and richly complex. A highy intoxicating brew that benefits from barrel aging. However, despite it's complexity the alcohol is pretty in your face and it's certainly far from graceful. 
M: The mouthfeel is great, maximum alcohol delivery in the smoothest of fashion. Carbonation is just right and pretty silky.
D: Whew. The alcohol bit is big, but so is the flavor. 1,135 charactersMPLS, Feb 13, 2010

22oz bottle topped with gold foil. sampled feb 6/2010.
pours deep brown. at first it appears opaque, but when held to the light you can see that it's crystal clear and has a bit of reddish highlights. the small dense dark tan head drops fairly fast and leaves a bit of spotty lace.
aroma is great. vanilla. bourbon and raw oak. rich caramel and toffee. earthy. light alcohol, but not 13.5% worth.
woah, taste is excellent. bourbon and vanilla. bit of raw oak. slightly earthy. caramel and buttery toffee. light alcohol. biscuit and lightly toasted whole wheat bread. bit of cracker. dark chocolate. hints of coffee and anise. light herbal and spicy notes, but they've been mostly subdued by the time in the barrel.
mouthfeel is great. nice big body. silky smooth medium carbonation level.
drinkability is great. nicely balanced, hiding much of its 13.5% abv. great depth. excellent complexity. the barrel is perhaps a little more heavy-handed than i would like, but it works pretty well. 1,101 charactersgrub, Feb 07, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Vintage 2008 22oz bottle.
Pours dark mahogany with amber highlights and a ruby tinge. Sparkling clarity with a quarter inch head of tan. A partial skim coat remained for the duration as well as some errant lacing.
Aromatics lead off with a blast of bourbon, toffee, and malt. Vanilla, brown sugar, and plenty of caramel quickly follow through.
Full bodied with a creamy, chewy mouthfeel. Viscous and dense.
A massive, boozy bourbon character leaps onto the palate with loads of toffee, raisins, figs, and caramel stepping forward. Hints of charred oak, cocoa, and nougat follow through. Minimal hopping other than some bitterness to balance.
Finishes with lots of building warmth, chewy caramel, bourbon, and rich malt.
Wowza, what a massive Barleywine. The barrels must have been very wet for this one. Loads of bourbon and very strong in nature. Truly a boozy, chewy winter sipper if there ever was one. 911 charactersbrewandbbq, Feb 04, 2010
3.81/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours dark toffee brown with a paltry sized head with no retention noted. Aromas of brown sugar, cat food, maple, and bourbon booziness dominate. Did I just say cat food? Yes, yes I did and apparently I am the only one to pick up on this but I don't get much enjoyment out of the aroma. The taste loads up on sugary sweets, treacle, toffee, with a maple and earthiness to it, and a big bourbon bite that I enjoy. I do like this, though as far as bourbon barrel barleywines go, this is fairly typical in taste. The thick body and properly light carbonation for the style, are, however, spot on, and this is a nice beer. I would recommend this, however, no more than any other bourbon barleywine I have enjoyed. 709 charactersvacax, Feb 03, 2010

I've had a few different brews from Pelican from back in the day and they were tasty. Super excited to try this one. Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip while watching the National Championship (Texas vs. Alabama).
Vintage 2009
Appearance- Pours a dark brownish ruby with a decent one finger sand colored head. After a few minutes the head dissipates leaving a decent collar and no lacing
Smell- This baby is just oozing with big boozy bourbon and oak. Smells very candy like with tons of toffee and peanut brittle. The bourbon is very pronounced and the woody goodness really shines. Loads of vanilla and red licorice along with some darker fruits (raisins and dates maybe). Whiffs of milk chocolate that mix with the toffee for a Milky Way type of smell. Awesome nose.
Taste- Starts slightly sweet with a big rush of lightly tannic woody goodness. The caramel and toffee are off the charts as they are malty and boldly aggressive. Tons of whiskey as it's lightly warming but mixed with the oak and malt it's merely an afterthought. Vanilla is abundant as well and mixed with the somewhat Tootsie Roll aspect this beer is everything I was hoping for. The finish is warming with a sort of light bitter char and a touch of red licorice.
Mouthfeel- Despite the barrel aging and high alcohol of the beer it still maintains a nice full body. It's somewhat creamy and very rich with a slight bit of warming.
Drinkability- This is just a solid f'n beer. SO much bourbon and wood. I'd say this is the biggest, tastiest barrel aged beer that I've had since Wooden Hell. It doesn't quite have the oak that WH had and it's a tad warmer but I think it may be slightly less sweet. In a year or two this thing is going to come together nicely and be absolutely amazing-er. Thanks much Tyler you generous son-of-a-gun! 1,920 charactersyounger35, Feb 01, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Scott for hosting a brew day and sharing this brew with me.
A - Poured a deep mahogany with even more mahogany highlights in the glass. Left about a finger of head, which retained nicely. Left some lacing.
S - Caramel, some smokiness, vanilla and oak. Light notes of alcohol. Hops were barely noticeable in the smell. Smelled good.
T - Roasted caramel, vanilla, and oak. Fruity esters (nectarine or ambrosia?) and grassy/fruity hops as well. Alcohol was barely apparent. Great overall.
M - Medium-full-bodied, malt dominated. Very smooth. Alcohol barely there. 
D - Fantastic. Wished I had more. This is by far the best English style barleywine I've had. Not a pretender, definitely a top beer. 713 charactersMisterClean, Jan 31, 2010

Poured into a snifter.
Appearance: A very small pile of khaki foam is all I got for head off the pour. It quickly dissipated to a thin halo. Body is clear, but very dark: deep reddish brown with shades of ruby. Looks very syrupy. I don't see any carbonation.
Smell: Cereal, toasted grains, caramel, bourbon, oak syrup, and brown sugar. Very sweet and sugary, but the light toastiness and hints of bourbon do a lot for this smell. Not as deep or complex as I had hoped, but unique.
Taste: Brown sugar, caramel, sweet oak and bourbon, a touch of pine, and even... roasted malt? Lots of residual sugars in here, but it's less sweet than all other English barleywines I've had (many of which I find to be unbearably sweet). Once again, unique. More complex than the aroma. I dig.
Mouthfeel: Oily, full, gritty, and awesome! Not too hot, not too dry. Lightly carbonated, syrupy, and rich.
Drinkability: English barleywine is certainly not my favorite style, but I can see why this one stands out. I think the sweetness would overwhelm me after a while, but as ~4oz. sample this was great. 1,186 charactersThreeWiseMen, Jan 25, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed at hoppymcgee's tasting 1/16. '09 vintage. 3oz. pour into a 8oz. pint glass. Reviewed from notes. 
A: Pours no head and leaves no lacing but on-par with the style. Almost seemed flat as a pancake... beer is a deep, stunning, almost opaque amber.
S: Cherry, oak notes, a bit boozy, vanilla, and a strong shot of sherry. Caramel and brown sugar are also present, this one is an assault on the senses. 
T: Opens sweet and boozy. A very deep malt backbone is apparent. A bit spicy, quite hot, with a touch of sweet soy sauce. This drinks like an imperial stout... also a bit pruny and the oaky sherry presence dominates towards the end. 
M: Medium to full bodied, spicy and hot. This one is slightly coarse in thew mouth but smoothes out over time. More carbonated than I expected. Finish is sweet and sticky, leaving a lasting impression. 
D: This is the king of barleywines. Incredibly balanced with a mouthfeel to match and integrate the complexity that is this beer. Seek it out. The hype is well-deserved here. A joy to have and one I'll definitely be seeking out in the future. 1,093 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 17, 2010
3.46/5  rDev -21.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5Pours a deep dark mahogony with amber hues and very little to no head. Not a great looking barleywine, but a decent looking beer. The smell is fantastic. super complex with vanilla, bourbon, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and sweet dark fruit.
The taste of this beer was a big disappointment, given the high overall BA rating and the aromas eminating from my glass. There are still the toffee, caramel, bourbon and brown sugar flavors, but none of them blend very well. The alcohol is SUPER-hot, and the barrel aging has not done well for this beer. Again, super-hot alcohol throughout, and a dry, bitter aftertaste that does not compel you to drink more. 3+ years would do wonders for this beer. 
The mouthfeel is nice and thick, but there is very little carbonation and it is way too hot all around. I'm glad I split this, because it would have taken me a few hours to finish a bottle by myself. 
Give this one at least three years and maybe it will be worthy of its BA rating. 981 charactersjdklks, Jan 12, 2010
3.6/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5The bourbon barrel scars this brew with a brownish hue. The barley wine looks like it started off with a great dark golden color, but the bourbon stains the color to make the finish with a hazy brown heart and darker golden edges. Has a bit of white head, but it leaves pretty fast. Alcoholic legs are fairly thick. 
The smell has sweet malt sugars and bourbon. Oak, and cherries with vanilla. Oak and bourbon are very strong, giving the overall smell a 'hot' aspect. 
The taste has characters of vanilla, cherries and dark fruits, with oak and bourbon. Lots of malt sugars that make it sweet, tastes like this is already aged over a year. The beer and the barrel come together very well, with the barrel being a bit of a larger character. It did not start off for me very ABV strong, but towards the end of the bottle it was a bit rough. I was picking up the oak and bourbon more and more and the balance was starting to fade. Very enjoyable, but maybe aged in oak a bit too long? 
The mouthfeel was good, but towards the end started to get very hot. This damaged the drinkability a great deal, and made the last glass full a challenge. Maybe a 8 oz pour into a brandy snifter would be perfect for me. A full 22oz bomber, even shared, was a bit much.

Poured a deep brown with red highlights that were revealed from each angle and rotation of the glass. Loose, white head quickly dissipates into barely a swirl. Incredible nose - malty, sugary sweet, toffee, butterscotch, a little booze, molasses, prunes and perhaps a little breadiness. Taste follows nose - sugary sweet with the addition of some caramel, vanilla and coconut. Mouthfeel is medium with a lively carbonation. Definitely a little booziness in this, but a big, bold and delicious beer. However, closer to an American Strong than an English barleywine in my humble opinion. 642 charactersJwale73, Jan 10, 2010

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I had the opportunity to sit down and drink this exceptional brew with one of the Pelican's brewers. As a deschutes loyalist from Bend, Oregon, I had lowered expectations going in from the beginning (abyss or bust). When the gentleman first explained the process of brewing The Perfect storm, I was very intrigued.
I wanted to see the color first, though. It was absolutely beautiful. Even more so then The Abyss. 
This elegant, yet slightly scary beer poured beautifully. Right out of the bottle, Chilled to perfection, I will admit to anyone that the beer was one of the best tasting brews I have ever had. But as time passed, mind you this beer is to be drunken slowly, it began to warm up slightly. and as it happened, i could definitely taste the strong alcohol nodes. This was, other than the price, the beers only turn off.
Given time, I know this beer will mature into something amazing. but for now, it is only exceptional. 932 charactersiheartpnwbrew, Jan 06, 2010

Pours a clear dark ruby red, some brown, very thick tan head forms, huge and chunky, settles down to a thick ring, some lace spots stick, legs on the glass, looks great.
Smell is insane, tons of oak and vanilla, bourbon, brandy, huge toffee notes, butterscotch, coconut, lots of raisin and dark fruit, lightly spicy, alcohol, this is intense.
Taste is similar, huge toffee and brown sugar sweetness, vanilla, bourbon and brandy, alcohol, dark fruit, raisin, butterscotch, more vanilla, more bourbon and alcohol in the finish, supremely malty.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some big warmth going down but I would expect no less. This stuff is serious, huge rich malts in the one, amazing. Thanks Alex! 849 charactersViggo, Jan 04, 2010

This has been a want of mine for a loooong time now, and finally I got to try the new batch. Split this with my girlfriend and roommate. Drumroll...here goes...
A: Opens with a nice muffled hiss and the ghostly smoke climbs out of the bottle. Pours a nice, deep mahagony brown with a khaki head. The head is, I would say, half a finger and recedes to a ring. Slightly sticky and creamy. Georgous.
S: Whoa. Bourbon hits you hard, but in a very good way. Nice spicy bourbon, caramel, toffee, and chocolate rise nicely. There are also hints of fruits (raisins?) perhaps, but the bourbon, caramel and toffee are the majority.
T: This is great. Smooth bourbon and caramel with bittersweet toffee and melted bitter chocolate. The caramel blends so great with the fresh bourbon. There is a slight heat that warms you, but nothing distracting at all.
M/D: Creamy, smooth, warming, delicious. Just great.
I am glad I got to try this beer and am lucky I have a good WA BA friend who gave me another to age. Thanks! 1,078 characterstreyrab, Jan 04, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a sinister black color with orange highlights; nice color. Just a smattering of brown head fizzes and then dies atop a half glass of Perfect Storm, as expected. Taking an initial whiff from the bottle, I'm already struck by a powerful blast of bourbon, oak, chocolate, and dead leaves, aromas that I continue to smell after I pour out a few ounces. The aroma is everything I want from a barleywine, with the unique, brawny booze and oak presence lurking at the edges. After a while, the smell becomes a little port-like-- very sweet and a little grapey
Sipping amplifies the bourbon, chocolate, and caramel notes, and vanilla and fruit (cherry, orange peel) flavors are added. Some hot alcohol washes in at mid-sip and brings a segue to a rather spicy finish. It's taking me a while to process everything I taste, perhaps because of the sheer intensity of all aspects of Perfect Storm. I don't taste as much oak, but bourbon is pretty upfront. 
Mouthfeel is medium-full in body with a syrup-like consistency. My mouth is left tingling after each sip, and now and then the alcohol threatens to become overwhelming after a sip. This is a slow drinker, and I can see I'll be taking a couple hours to polish off the bomber. I guess I can't complain too much about drinkability, even given the sometimes intense aspects-- it's a bourbon barrel-aged English barleywine, after all, and it is what it is. 
All told, Perfect Storm is a really great barleywine, perhaps near Midnight Sun Arctic Devil for among the best I've tried. I think some age would have bumped it to #1, as about all I can ding the beer for is a little harshness in taste and feel from the alcohol/bourbon flavors. 1,686 charactersRiccymon, Jan 03, 2010

4.69/5  rDev +6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewpub today.
Like the bottled version, PS pours a dark brown color, but with fair at best head retention and a decent amount of sticky lacing all around. The nose on this BW is really impressive, with a considerable amount of brown sugar, toffee, chocolate, milk duds and vanilla. As good as this beer smells, it tastes even better. If anything, the flavor profile is more intense then the aroma profile, and this beer has almost a gooey sweet, soft creamy mouthfeel. This is like eating/drinking the essense of BW nougat. Also, there are some wonderful dark fruits in the flavor profile, something I don't recall being all that prevelant in the bottled version. Otherwise, the beer is exceptionally soft, plush and creamy... yummm! This beer does seem a bit boozy, but at 13.5%, that's hardly a surprise. Like the sweetness in this beer, it's not at all intrusive, and is something that I suspect will dissipate over time (and as I have another 3 bottles, I'll get to find out!). Drinkability is pretty good considering the abv., though needless to say, a little bit goes a long way. Also, although this beer is pretty sweet, it's not over the top and is, I think, perfect for the style. 
One of the best young BW's I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. The draft version seemed a bit more mature then the bottled version, though I'm sure it will improve over time as well. Otherwise, I can't say I found all that much difference between the draft version and the bottled version. In any event, very, very impressive.
Edit from 11/14.  The newest version is more of the same, but the barrel aging and whiskey barrel flavor is more prominent than in previous versions.  For me, this just makes the beer even more impressive and enjoyable.  Excellent stuff.... 1,779 charactersJohn_M, Dec 29, 2009

Pour an oxidized/rust brown, but perfectly translucent. Smells of Werther's caramel, a touch of Werther's chocolate, toasted pecans, a touch of bourbon and wood, perhaps lightly roasted coffee... list could go on and on. Basically, it was like smelling an exceptional sherry that changed in the glass over time. Phenomenal. 
A bit of heat and tannic wood, which gives taste and drinkability as the only small knocks I gave this beer. Perfectly carbonated upon opening--but even after letting it run still in my glass over a couple hours, I continue to be fascinated by this one. Truly an exceptional beer that I can't wait to try again a few years down the road.

A: Pours a dark caramel with nice light tan head and lacing. 
S: The initial whiff brings forward quite a bit of bourbon and alcohol. Underneath there is caramel, wood, vanilla, toffee, and a bit of dark fruits. 
T: Again, the first taste brings forward tons of hot bourbon. The underlying flavors are all quite nice and complex, but it takes a while to sort through the hotness of it all. This is what keeps it down at a 4.0, although I could see an aged version of this absolutely creeping up to a 4.5 or even a 5.0, depending on how the heat recedes.
M: Even though this is fairly hot, the complexity is outstanding, begging me to slowly chew every sip of the beer.
D: This was a hard one to put down; sip after sip news things are developing. Would love to try this down the line with some more age on it. 901 charactersThorpe429, Dec 21, 2009

A: The pour is a dark, dark brown with some nice reddish highlights. The head is mild in volume and tan in color.
S: There is a surprising amount of chocolate (oxidation) in the aroma, but it works quite well. The usual suspects of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and dark fruit are there as well, along with some oak.
T: Like the aroma, there is a ton of chocolate to this beer--something I don't normally expect from a barleywine. The sweet, malty flavors, dark fruits, and barrel contributions (vanilla and a nice oaky flavor) make this amazingly complex. I just had to give it a 5.
M: Very nice and smooth. The carbonation is quite low, and the body is incredibly full.
D: The only place that this beer takes a bit of a hit. This shouldn't be surprising, however. But despite being 13.5% alcohol, it is surprisingly drinkable.
I've not been the hugest barleywine fan in the past, but this beer has changed my perception of the style. Absolutely fantastic. 1,020 characterswomencantsail, Dec 21, 2009

Poured into Carolous chalice.
Pours a layer of tan head. Fades to a ring around the edge of the glass fast. Color is a dark ruby hued chocolate brown.
Aroma: vanilla, oak, bourbon, chocolate, caramel, earthy hops, very complex. Amazing.
Taste: Bourbon, vanilla, and oak up front. A nice amount of hops to balance it out. Caramel with light chocolate. Dark fruit notes. A fantastic b-wine.
Mouthfeel: creamy, smooth, but a little too hot. Pretty full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Ends malty and hot with dark fruit flavors.
Overall, a fantastic b-wine. One of the best in the style. A little hot. I think this one will get better with age on it and then I will reevaluate the score. I can't wait to try it again 741 charactersmothman, Dec 21, 2009

A--Plenty of lacing with a orange-burgandy hue.
S--Complex. So many diffent things going on. Vanilla, spice, and of course, some bourbon. 
T--Tempted to give it a 5. So complex in its flavors, not too much Bourbon which I liked, it did not overpower the brew allowing its other flavors to come out. Vanilla and cinnamon for sure, figs?
D--Do to its rarity, does it matter? What I can say is this is a sipper to be enjoyed for its complex flavors and smell. Hated to see it go. 530 charactersgarbercury, Dec 15, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz bottle...most recent vintage.
Pours a deep mahogany, with a small but nice looking tan head.
Aroma is magnificent, so much happening here...huge smooth bourbon notes, vanilla, toffee, wood, cinnamon, caramel and rich dark fruits. Wow the nose the very complex. Seems like each time I give it a sniff something new is coming out. 
Flavor is equally impressive if not better...rich and smooth flavors of caramel, vanilla, oak and a nice spot on for the style hop presence. 
Really nice full body and extremely smooth, very drinkable almost no alcohol presence. This is hands down the best barleywine I have ever had. 620 charactersgregc, Dec 15, 2009

Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a medium tan head that fades to a ring and leaves good lacing.
Aroma is caramel, bourbon, wood, toffee, dark fruit, and spice. Really pungent and awesome. A "perfect storm" of awesome aromas melding together (yes, very creative, I know).
Flavor is caramel and lots of toffee and wood, in addition to vanilla, spices, cherry raisin, fig, date, malted milk balls, and a little mildly boozy bourbon. Very complex and very, very tasty. Once again, the name of this beer is fitting.
Full body with a smooth mouthfeel, only ever so slightly boozy but very warming. Drinkability is high because it's just so damn good. Overall, this is easily one of the best barleywines I've ever tried. 853 charactersnickd717, Dec 15, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Thanks to ipafool for this. Pours ruby/dark brown in color with an interesting tan head that recedes to nonexistence. Smells and tastes amazing - tons of bourbon, vanilla, toffee, raisins, dark fruits, wood, and alcoholic heat. This really is liquid toffee. Reminds me a bit of FW Abacus or FW 10. An amazing wood-aged barleywine. Body is super thick, but the carbonation slices through it to prevent syrupification. I started out the gate strong in downing this, but am hitting a wall as I near the end of the bottle, so drinkability takes a bit of a hit. Not sure why this is sold in bombers rather than 12 oz bottles, but quite a tasty brew. 644 characterswaltonc, Dec 12, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I drank this second release from a 22.oz bottle into my Rochefort glass. 
The beer is a dark brown with medium brown head that rises about 1 finger is gone quite quickly. The lacing is heavy but watery in substance is gone quickly.
The aroma is strong and complex you get bourbon, wood and vanilla right off the bat but then some nice rasian, toffee, and sadly a touch too much alcohol at the end. 
This beer tastes very comples and wonderful. The front is very malty lots of raisins, then it fades to bourbon and and ton of vanilla at the end. For 13.5% you taste some alcohol but it could be a lot more. 
The feel is incredibly it coats your mouth like syrup almost numbing you to the bone. This is by far the best mouthfeel ever. 
Overall, I'm not a barleyfine at ALL! But this great beers may just change my mind, or just is it this beer? This beer is tasty, complex and has the best mouthfeel I've ever had. I would recommend this beer up and down all day. 966 charactersjrallen34, Dec 10, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cannot believe I get to finally try this one, been a long time coming for sure! Served at cellar temp and poured into a snifter, this one was consumed on 12/07/2009. 
  
The pour was fantastic, and much better then I have seen on any of the BA BW before. Rich dark brown in color with a huge head of tan that just towered over the top of the glass. Settling down smoothly and evenly it produced a thick coating of lace all along the sides of the glass. Rich vanilla and woody aromas are being picked up almost immediately. Huge notes of oak and subtle caramel and toffee and truly dominating here for sure. Warming only brings this out further, rich and decadent, sweet aromas just building off each other here. The first sip is divine, subtle, and rich and perfectly carbonated it simply rolls across the tongue with a gentleness that is unheard of. Vanilla and caramel merging with oak like notes and touches of earthy hops all working together seamlessly. I am still not sure how strong this one is, but subtleness is key here as it was barely detectable at all. 
  
Overall this was just incredible. I had heard this was one of the best out there, but very seldom does that hold true, here it does with flying colors. One of the best, hands down I has ever had. 1,267 charactersmikesgroove, Dec 09, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5BA barley wines typically aren't my favorite style and after all the hype, I was really curious to see how it would hold up.
This was poured into a small snifter and the dark brown/ruby brew sat heavy with a light layer of cream colored bubbles around the edges. They dissipated quickly but small carbonation bubbles continued to rise and agitate the surface. The color was very nice but it was the aroma that let me know I was in for something special. Immediately a wave of warm bourbon and vanilla hit me followed by a light sweetness and touch of alcohol. This easily could be out of balance but to me each component mixed so delicately with one another where the combination added up to something impossibly better than the individual scents. Honestly, if they were able to create an air freshener that matched this aroma, I don't think I could ever leave my house.
If even possible, the taste was better than the aroma. Initially there's a bit of sweetness that quickly fades as the complexity sinks in. Yes, there's a lot of bourbon and vanilla and toffee, but the longer it sits in on your tongue, the more the flavors change. Whereas Wooden Hell is velvet like and overall exceptional, it seems a bit one-dimensional to me compared to the Perfect Storm. Both have outstanding bourbon flavors with a great malt backbone, but TPS just seems to have a complexity in the base beer that is so well balance that it makes sipping on it for a long time extremely enjoyable. 
This easily is one of the best beers I've ever had and being the rich, intensely flavorful beer that it is, it's definitely a sipper. That being said, the light carbonation keeps it playful and the smoothness made me crave sip after sip. I went into this thinking that it would be pretty good but would most likely not live up to the hype, and I was absolutely wrong. It's exceptional and I only wish I had more. 1,891 charactersSonicAlligator, Dec 08, 2009
3.67/5  rDev -17%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Big thanks to Joel, who brought this to our tasting...this was one I was very excited to try!
Pours a very dark, very clear reddish brown with a tan head that dissipates to nothing. 
Smell is of toffee, raisin, prune, bourbon, vanilla and oak. Big, malty, sweet, and very boozy. Nice. This is so barrely.
The taste is equally strong. Very bourbony and boozy. Too much so. Bitter and carmelly with some blueberry-like dark fruits. This beer is so rough around the edges, it is impossible to review it as positively as others have on here. I truly don't understand the fuss over this one, and neither did most of those with whom I shared the bottle (and we didn't even discuss that at the tasting--just now reading their notes). This tastes like a prime candidate for extended aging, but as it stands fresh, it just isn't very drinkable or tasty. Give it 2 or more years and it might turn into something great, but it just isn't right now.
Crazy hot with low-medium carbonation with a medium-full body. 
Too hot and too intense to be very drinkable, this one is complex and tasty enough to keep me thirsty for more...to a point. 1,131 charactersphotomike, Dec 07, 2009
3.28/5  rDev -25.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5Bottle brought down by Joel from the pub. Super dark red color with a small beige head. The aroma has a lot of bourbon influence and barrel character, like this spent some quality time on wood. Dark burnt sugars, charred oak, burnt vanilla, caramel, alcohol and old wood. The flavor is very hot with lots of bourbon, dark caramel, bunt fruit and charred wood. The finish is almost pure alcohol and very rich. The mouthfeel is very hot and alcoholic, full, and has a modest amount of prickly carbonation. A very big beer that is not very smooth at this point and could use a lot of time to mellow out. Dark and burnt for a barleywine. They really went for it with maximum barrel extraction, but it looks like its going to take a lot of time to really mellow back out. 766 charactersbulletrain76, Dec 07, 2009

Aroma is sharp bourbon, lots of heat here, charred oak, vanilla. This is more bourbony than any barrel-aged beer I've had. Over the top. Flavor is caramel and bourbon, vanilla, leather, and wood. I don't know if I'm drinking beer or if a plane dropped a barrel on my face. Needs a lot of age to gain a modicum of drinkability. Also rather thin from the spirit influence. 459 charactersillidurit, Dec 07, 2009

4.8/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a very dark amber/chestnut brown color with ruby mahogany edges and a one finger light beige head that quickly fades into a lasting ring that leaves sporadic spots of lacing behind.
Sweet caramel malt aroma with hints of honey, toffee, hazelnut and earthy leathery malts. Sweet alcohol, earthy oak and a boat load of vanilla accompanying the subtle bourbon character. There was not as much bourbon in the nose as I had expected and this is a nice change of pace. Very complex with a lot of interesting aromas going on here.
Nice soft carbonation up front with a medium body that's on the fuller end. Promient oaky tannis and a huge vanilla character from the oak aging. The bourbon is ore prominent in the flavor than in the aroma but again it isn't overpowering but rather is a nice compliment to the other complex flavors. There's also a bit of dark fruit, especially raisin, fig and date balancing out the earthy leathery malt notes. The bourbon presence provides a bit of alcohol warmth but this beer is dangerously drinkable considering how well the high ABV is masked. Extremely smooth and if I didn't share this bottle with some other BAs I would have probably killed myself by drinking it too fast. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and I can't recommend it and higher! 1,295 characterscorby112, Dec 06, 2009

A: Very deep mahogany, nearly purple. Very faint tan head about a quarter inch formed but quickly faded in less than a few seconds and no lace could be found.
S: Lots of sweet flavors like toffee, caramel, dark fruit followed by some sweet vanilla and bourbon. The wood is very mild but provides a hint of an earthy undertone.
T: This very well may have been the most complex beer I have ever tried. Each sip seemed to provide a different flavor. It started out with the toffee and caramel but there were also some nice coconut and almond notes present. Plenty of bourbon in there as well providing a nice amount of smokiness and some leather. Figs with a mild vanilla flavor also come it. At times it tasted a bit like marscapone. Again one of the most complex beers I have ever tasted.
M: It was slightly hot and at first the bold flavors were a bit overwhelming. It had a nice cheky quality and blurred the lines of what a beer can be. At times I felt like I was drinking a port due to the sweetness.
D: This is one to share without a doubt. The tiniest of sips was all that was needed to get a mouthful of flavor. 1,134 charactersmikey711, Dec 03, 2009

A month ago a friend and I took a very long trip to Pacific City. First sight was the amazing Oregon coastline. I have to say that the brewery is one of the sweetest sights I have ever seen. Literally, its right on the beach! I knew I was in for a treat. Pick up a three cases of their finest. I drove home with that silly grin of accomplishment.
Went home served it in my Rochefort glass, I thiought it was fitting.
Deep deep red with a very creamy head that bubbles out.
The smell was deep with a rich malty goodness. I have a hard time deciphering minute aromas. Lets just say " It was divine".
Taking my first sip let me know it was finely carbonated, very clean. To follow up with amazing complex flavors. The great thing was that the high ABV was tamed quite well. 
After thew bottle I felt blissful with a warm fuzziness that comes from excellent beer. I'm so glad I know where to get more,
Great beer, one of the reasons I moved to the NW!
09 Batch (5.0)
 This years TPS is sublime. The base beer, 08 Stormwatchers, is a lot better than the previous. Thus giving the ale a wonderful creaminess and balance it didn't have before (I didn't realize this until I did a side-by-side tasting). Big notes of vanilla, caramel , prunes, raisins, and a little bourbon makes this years batch worth every drop. I have to give a standing ovation to Pelican for taking TPS up a notch. They have been producing some amazing beers under the radar and TPS is the cream of the crop. Great World Class Beer!!! 1,513 charactersDajtai007, Nov 30, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to rochefort10nh for sharing this brew with me, during my break at work none-the-less. Reviewed from notes earlier today. The pour yielded no head, just a tight white ring around the top of the deep dark brown mahogany body. When held up the light there was a bit of amber glow around the edges, very little lacing on this one.
The smell is an intoxicating blend of toffee, caramel, bourbon booze, barrel and vanilla. Underneath the dominate notes there are hints of pine resin, toasted malts and raisins.
The taste is a huge malty blast of caramel, toffee and a toasted malt sweetness, that never gets too sweet or cloying. The barrel flavors bring everything back to center quickly and effectively and the bourbon just finishes everything off. You taste caramel-and-bourbon, toffee-and-bourbon, etc... The bourbon flavors are perhaps the best I have had in a beer yet, just perfectly complementing everything else and inviting me back for more.
This is definitely a sipper, it has a thick boozy mouthfeel and the warming sensation in the stomach starts almost instantly with this brew. The carbonation is light, but spot on for the style, and adds just enough to make the beer more complex. The finish is incredible and surprisingly dry, not sweet and boozy at all. As the beer warms the raisin and vanilla come out a bit more, making the flavors more interesting indeed. 1,388 charactersrpstevens, Nov 26, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me just start off by saying that this is fantastic beer that really shows what barrel-aging is capable of doing with a high-quality base beer. Of course using the finest quality barrels also adds to the complexities found in this elixir.
Appearance is really a deep brown when observed at table level but when held to the light a russet and golden edged sunburst color is apparent. Little to no head is produced with a vigorous pour, but that's not to say there isn't any carbonation. Surprisingly no legs are visible even when the beer is swirled to release it's outstanding aroma. At this level of alcohol legs were, to me, a forgone conclusion.
On to that outstanding smell. Where to begin!! Deep dark, Belgian chocolate, star anise, fresh, home-made caramel, intoxicating booze (high quality), very slight pine and resin, a minute amount of top-shelf soy sauce and a roasty bourbon char and the requisite vanilla underpinnings. 
The taste is not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be. It almost reminds me of a Amontillado sherry in how the nose would leave you to believe that a serious dose of sweetness (toffee, honey, turbinado sugar) was coming your way, only to produce the hint of those sticky sweet flavors you expect to swirl around in your mouth. Very intriguing and very more-ish. The Storm also has a hint of hazelnuts in is lasting finish.
Mouthfeel is thick, rich and viscous - almost decadent. Not a great deal of carbonation, but enough to suit the style perfectly.
This is a sipper folks, but the best kind of sipper possible - warm, friendly and lets face it, intoxicating - the kind of beer that leads to reflection and contemplation. This is a beer for late fall, early winter when the trees are barren and the first signs of frost blanket the earth. Take out your favorite beer book, start a fire and relax.
Update: This has become my favorite Barleywine over the years. I look forward to buying a case each year. This is the ONLY beer I buy by the case!! I'm drinking my last 2012 as the leaves fall and thunderstorms roll in. This is why I drink beer. Perfection! 2,103 charactersRochefort10nh, Nov 24, 2009

A- Poured with limited bubbles and they disappeared quickly from the glass. Very dark, beautiful beer. Swirled nicely in our Dogfish Head brandy glasses, and left a nice coating.
S- Wow, this is bourbon! Beautiful woodsy, bourbon barrel smell. Lots of alcohol scents. We couldn't help but continue to swirl our glasses to get more of the scent wafting up our noses.
T- Again, not like any barleywine I have ever tasted. It had characteristics of a imperial stout, some barleywine, english strong ale and bourbon. 
M- Wow again. Lots of alcohol flavors. Carbonation went quickly away as we continued to drink our glass. But who needs that when you have a delicious sipping/after dinner/dessert beer? Sweet flavors continued to come through.
D- A must share with friends. Enjoy a bottle with two people or more. 
This is a great beer. Didn't rate it the highest because I don't think this is a traditional barleywine but extremely enjoyable. 1,139 characterschief7771, Nov 24, 2009

This is my first review, and what a beer to kick it off with!
Pouring this beer into my glass reminds me of that vanilla cherry dr pepper a little bit with all the smells. I can definitely smell the bourbon and malts too. It looks like a dark brown color. The foam settles quickly and all thats left is a nice set of intersecting carbonated bubbles rising up the edge of the glass.
The taste of the beer is just like the smell - very thick and chewy and just the right amount of carbonation. I taste nuts, bread, sweet dark fruits.
This is easy to drink. High ABV not a concern. It's actually a little dry swallowing with a nice warmth. Well balanced.
Parts of this beer reminds me of the Central Waters bourbon barrel barleywine but more complex, brewed in my state. If I could find another bottle of this, I'd love to do a side by side tasting with that. 900 charactersMysterySwirl, Nov 17, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 vintage-
Poured this into my Delirium Tremens tulip snifter. Was hit with the pleasant smell of vanilla, bourbon, caramels and the tan lacing quickly dissipated into a nice little ring of lacing. When I swirl my glass, I'm reminded of this beer's thickness. Damn - this is a hell of a BA Barleywine. *Just had it again and I honestly can say this is the BEST smelling beer I have ever had. If we had to score this based on smell the Perfect Storm would be number one.
It's very dark brownish ruby color but-crimson like through the edges when I hold my glass to the light. So smooth - malty, dark fruits, bready, caramel. Carbonation teases my tongue and cheeks when I swirl it around. The ABV is warming and the taste is dryer on the finish but SO drinkable. It's like drinking pure goodness!
World class - that's for sure. Lives up to the hype and belongs where it is now. I wish I had more of this than the 3 bottle I have left because I can only imagine how this is going to taste in a year or two. 1,011 characterskunstdrache, Nov 16, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage (aged in 1998 Evan Williams barrels).
A: Deep rudy-brown body. Bordeaux like on the edges when held to the light. Lively carbonation forms a fizzy, coca-cola like khaki head. Rises to about an inch before crashing rapidly. No lacing to speak of.
S: Rich bourbon, soft oak, warm caramel, sweet vanilla, roasted brown sugar, molasses and hints of raisin. There are lots of elements coming together here in harmony. Sweet, yet not cloying or desert like.
T: The sweet caramel, brown sugar and molasses dominates. Accentuated by substantial, yet not overwhelming, bourbon. The barrels imparts a nice delicate oak/vanilla character. You can tell that this beer is the product of both an excellent base beer and nice bourbon barrels with a good amount of age on them.
M: There is lively carbonation throughout the entire bomber. Imparting a hefty, yet not massive mouthfeel. Creamy. Perhaps a bit oily. Nice lingering bourbon "burn" in the finish.
D: Immensely drinkable. Easily the best barleywine available. Looking forward to trying this each year. 1,063 characterscallmemickey, Nov 15, 2009

Smell is huge malts, a little toffee and just a hint of alcohol in the backend.
Taste is incredibly smooth, some slight fruits and a bit of alcohol heat in the finish. This beer is absolutely outstanding. The drinkability on this beer is unbelievable. The abv is barely noticeable in the beer.
The mouthfeel is untouchable in this beer. I know this beer comes in at 13.5%, but everytime I take a sip I want to drink the whole thing. 
I love this beer. 556 charactersFtownThrowDown, Nov 14, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ahh, I have been waiting a long time to get a chance to try this beer. Poured from a bottle into my Bruery tulip. Thanks, Ben.
I was taken aback by the brew from the instant it poured from the bottle. A very dark but clear deep reddish amber color, very, very attractive for the style. A thin tan head develops, but quickly dissipates. Nice.
The moment you pop the cap the aromas explode on you. Bourbon is paramount here, but underneath are layers of brown sugar, toffee, alcohol, and just a hint of dark fruit. I'm thinking plum.
Taste is excellent. Again, the barrel aging is very obvious here, with the bourbon playing a big role. Taste follows the nose - sweet caramel, brown sugar, with a nice alcoholic zing at the end. Maybe some nuttiness on the finish too, which is interesting and unexpected. Only reason that it's not a perfect 5 here is because I think the bourbon could be slightly more mellow (but only slightly). This will age very well - a year in the cellar might make this a perfect score.
Mouthfeel doesn't get any better for a barleywine. The slight carbonation is perfect, and the beer is viscous and chewy. Outstanding.
You know, I don't care that this is 13% alcohol. I think that I could sip on this beer all night and never, ever get tired of it. I might pass out, but it would be totally worth it. If this beer was on the shelves, I would have it stocked all-the-freaking time. 
Perhaps the best English barleywine I have had the pleasure of drinking. 1,484 charactersdavod23, Nov 14, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had two pours of this last night at the South Bay Drugs Bottle Tasting. This was had in the same night as BA Speedway, BA Numbskull, Black Tuesday, and Black Ops. This is not a stout, yes, but the barrel-aged nature of it certainly lends a similar bourbon character.
Appearance: Certainly nothing remarkable or indicative of a "world class" beer status. Don't mean that in a negative way, just in a you-don't-know-what's-coming way. Slight reddish hue in a brown-orange beer with a relatively little tannish crown. 
Smell: Raisins, bourbon-rum, malty, sugary sweetness and some booze coming through. A very, very pleasing aroma.
Taste: I was slightly let down from what I've heard, but still very powerful. Rum-raisin, brown sugar, with the big bourbon notes coming through. It's certainly a complex beer, but she needs a little time in a cellar to mellow the tastes out a bit. Huge potential here for sure.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, thick, and relatively mild in the bitterness department. Bourbony finish is very solid as well.
Drinkability: I think it drinks right around the ABV. Side-by-side with the other barrel-aged classics though, it just didn't stand out to me in the same way. Then again, give this a year or two to mellow out some boozy sweetness and I could easily see this sliding into that tier. 1,309 charactersnomomentwasted, Nov 13, 2009

4.84/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Shane.
Pours a glowing, translucent brown with some ruddy, ruby-esque highlights. A small light tan head of maybe a half an inch to an inch, surprising considering the brew's abv. Very attractive. 
Smells glorious. Absolutely splendiferous. Rich warming bourbon, supple caramel, a bit of coconut and vanilla, some .. wood? ... notes brown sugar and candied cake, along with toffee and roasted marshmallows. Really sublime, with two dozen things going on at once. Maybe even a hint of dark fruit.
Tastes very good. A really great melding of strong boubon flavors with a complex backing. The bourbon comes through more strongly in the flavor than the aroma. The coconut, vanilla and ... dark chocolate ...? take more of a center stage along with the luscious bourbon, and the brown sugar, toffee, and caramel provide a delicious sweet backbone. The barrel also give a slight woodsy/earthy flavor to it. I do wish that it had a touch less bourbon, but it's a small complaint considering all that was going on. 
Chewy, thick mouthfeel. Quite an achievement. Considering the ABV, very drinkable. 1,101 charactersOverlord, Nov 12, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Opened this one with HopHead84 upon landing in San Diego last Thursday. What a beer to start the weekend with. 2009 vintage.
The beer pours a dark reddish-brown, and sits in the glass nearly opaque with a finger of tan head. When held to the light, it has a beautiful crimson hue with perfect clarity.
The aroma is earthy, woody, leathery. There's a bit of tobacco and some noticeable oxidation in the form of sherry with just a hint of soy sauce. There's a bit of boozy heat from the barrel as well, along with caramel and a touch of toasted coconut.
Opens on the palate with moderate malty sweetness, light fruity esters, boozy bourbon, fruitcake and a touch of roastiness. The body is medium-full; this isn't overly rich or sweet as some barleywines can be. The mid-palate brings out more heat and some pleasant oxidation - soy sauce, sherry, and some oaky vanilla. The finish is tannic and dry with a light bitterness.
Drinkability is good for a 13.5% barleywine. While it's very rich, it's not especially cloying and the complexity keeps it interesting throughout. 1,073 characterslargadeer, Nov 10, 2009

A - Pours a ruby tinted root beer stream with a short lived dark tan head that recedes to nothing. Only a few sips in, but no lace. The appearance should be a 4, but I'm adjusting it to bump the taste to ~5.
S - Damn this smells great. As I started pouring this I could smell the sweet sweet bourbon. Fantastic toffee, raisins, oak, vanilla, and I think some nuts?
T - Thick brown sugar, vanilla, and rum soaked raisins. This is freakin' delicious, and is making a great dessert night cap. I might be crazy, but it reminds me of Nutella a little bit...
M/D - There really isn't much of an alcohol presence, but I also enjoy a glass of good bourbon. The mouthfeel is awesome; oily and coats your whole mouth with light carbonation. It's a sipper, but one I seriously can't put down. 790 charactersxpimptastikx, Nov 10, 2009

L) Pours with little head, tiny bubbles around the glass which show the light carbonation. Brown to amber almost transparent. Looks yummy
S) huge toffee notes, bourbon, syrup, oak. Smells yummy.
T) light sweetness, bourbon and oak like the smell a little hot but still awesome. Tastes yummy.
M) Perfect, the light carbonation does wonders not to thick not to thin. A somewhat dry finish. Yummy again
D) Perfect again, it is strong but it is a barrel aged barleywine. I could sip this all night long. 
A overall great beer that should be seeked out by any barleywine lover. 618 charactersipafool, Nov 10, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Shared with Dave & Joe for NBS. Served in a mini-pint glass.
A - A finger of dark tan/mocha foam that dissipates to a thick ring and leaves a bit of light film. Transparent ruby red-brown body that really glows when held to the light. Not much in the way of lace, but still quite impressive for such a high-gravity brew.
S - The smell is a wonderful combination of toasted marshmallow, light coconut, milk chocolate, burnt brown sugar, a bit of wood, and a touch of grape/raisin flavor that I tend to get more from old ales (like Papier). The booze and bourbon are extremely understated, especially compared to something like Barrel-Aged Behemoth.
T - The taste isn't quite as complex, with more roastiness and tannic bite - there's still some chocolate and sugar, but there's also some multi-grain bread qualities bouncing around. Finishes with a lot of tannins and barrel, as well as some roastiness, but it's not overly bitter or astringent. Pretty good - should probably be closer to 4.25 at this stage.
M - The mouthfeel is wonderful. Big and chewy, viscous, full bodied, with a dry finish that has only a touch of residual stickiness. Light carbonation tingle that keeps things from getting too syrupy and heavy, but not harsh either.
D - I keep sipping this one. It's very mellow considering the ABV. That said, the aftertaste does get a touch fatiguing - I don't think I'd ever have more than a bottle in one sitting. I think I like Abacus a little more, but this didn't disappoint either. 1,502 charactersMasterSki, Nov 09, 2009

Pours a dark ruby red/chestnut brown with a small head that recedes into a thin rim. Looks stately in my tulip class!
This is easily the best smelling beer I've ever had. Absolutely no question. Nutty, caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, cherries and some bourbon heat all come a-calling.
It's all there in the taste. I'm also picking up grape skins, toffee and marshmallow. The only detractor this beer has right now is it's heat. I think that in a few months, this could be my favorite beer of all time.
At 13.7%, drinkablilty suffers... but you don't go through your stash of this beer willy-nilly. You savor this, sip by mother loving sip. Standing effing ovation, Pelican! 777 charactersrudylaw, Nov 09, 2009

Viscous mouthfeel. Flavor was dark fruit, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and finished with a rubbing alcohol aftertaste. This beer might be too green at this point. It was just hard to sip because of the rubbing alcohol aftertaste. It was tough. Shared originally Sept. 1, 2009. 382 charactersfiver29, Nov 09, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Purchased a case of 2009 Perfect Storm and received it in the mail 11/2/09. Opened the first one on 11/7/09 to celebrate the birth of my daughter born 11/5/09. I really worked up this brew in my head because of all the reviews I read and the attractive appearance and color of the beer.
When I cracked the top the smell was of raisins and bourbon. The bottle was pretty cold (maybe 40f) so I took one sip cold and then let it warm up. The initial reaction was that tastes dang good, but to cold to taste the spectrum of flavors.
After warming up I started enjoying it in my snifter. Flavors consisted of oak, bourbon, raisins, caramel/toffee, maybe fig?
Definitely a top notch beer. Strong, dominating flavor, great carbonation. I think the alcohol was a little hot still in the bottle and will get better with aging. 
This was a great beer, but I keep on thinking afterwards that I've had some that are better. Namely the Abyss, Berserker, Canadain Breakfast Stout, Cherry Adam, Matt etc. This is definitely a beer that should remain in the top 25-50 brews available world wide. 1,082 charactersnorthwestmark, Nov 08, 2009

Scent of rich sugars, sweet bourbon, chocolate, oatmeal, a hint of raspberry, and faint alcohol. Nice complexity, but not quite perfect.
Taste of strong bourbon, molasses, chocolate, a bit of alcohol, dark fruit, and sugars. The bourbon flavor is quite powerful and lasts long into the finish and the alcohol adds a nice heat.

Pours a deep, clear copper with a short-lived cap of big bubbles that recedes to a small collar and leaves very little lacing, though there are boozy legs down the glass after each sip.
The aroma is massive and has plenty of bourbon sweetness and alcohol burn in the nose which mixes well with the sugary caramel malt and dark fruit in the nose.
The underlying caramel malts are the first thing I notice with some toffee and dark fruits. There is definitely plenty of bourbon especially in the finish where there is a noticeable burn in the throat. Overall, it's like a caramel and chocolate dessert with raisins and plums soaked in bourbon.
The mouthfeel is stunning, one of the best I've ever felt, like velvet. It's smooth with ample, but soft, carbonation and slightly dry and woody in the finish with a sweet bourbon presence on the palate as well.
I wasn't sure what to expect on this one. I saw everyone raving about it but just figured it wouldn't live up to the hype. Well, it lives up to the hype. It's a wonderful beer that drinks fairly easily for the high ABV. The bourbon is strong right now and I think this one becomes even better with time. Superb. 1,220 charactersgford217, Nov 08, 2009

A - Pours black with a super-fizzy head that quickly vanishes right after I complete the first pour. A few stray bubbles here and there, but otherwise, it's just complete darkness (in the Darkness snifter...okay, not funny). 
S - Amazing nose. Plums, raisins, cherries, oak/wood, bourbon, roasted malts, brown sugar. So sweet but yet all meld together perfectly. The bourbon is there, no doubt about it, but it's not so in-your-face as to not appreciate all the other things going on with this one.
T - Not quite as sweet as the nose suggests. Dark fruits, roasted malts, dark chocolate. Lots of bourbon on the palate, but it doesn't kick you in the face as bad as I thought it would. ..it's very smooth. Some alcohol burn on the way down but hey, it's 13.5%, so what was I suppose to expect? Bitter hoppy dark chocolate finish. Whew, I'm getting the sweats putting this one down. This is one BIG beer.
M - Medium to full bodied. The carbonation tingles a bit but quickly smoothes out and engulfs the palate. Pretty dry on the finish. Just like motor oil, only better!
D - The alcohol is hidden pretty darn well, if I do say so myself. It's a sipper, no doubt about it, but probably one of the best (if not THE best) BA Barleywines I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Right there with Wooden Hell, IMO
This beer is going to be near perfect with a couple of years in the cellar. 1,478 charactersSean9689, Nov 07, 2009

Smell - At first it smelled very fruity to me, but then the toffee/syrupy smell came on strong with hints of bourbon. Right at the end it really reminds me of a raw dough smell heh. The smell is great and very strong, I could smell it as soon as I popped the cap.
Taste - The toffee and the caramel really shine through in the taste along with the alcohol.
Mouthfeel - It is quite fizzy which I like. 
Drinkability - Goes down alright, think it would go great with a hardy meal of some sorts.
Edit for 2010 MoAS
Much of the same as the last year, but more vanilla/marshmellow flavor and smell. I'd say this years is better and one of the best beers out there. So I am giving a 5. The drinkability is insane consider the ABV. 853 charactersyuriruley, Nov 06, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Consumed on 11/6/2009 and poured into a snifter. Thanks to largadeer for opening the bottle. The beer appears deep crimson when held to light with good clarity. The wispy head is one finger and a light toffee color. 
The nose is outstanding, and it reminds me of...M. When I stuck my nose in the glass I immediately thought of the famed Midnight Sun beer. I'm greeted by strong vanilla and spicy oak notes. Bourbon is very well integrated in the nose. I detect dates and a hint of roast. The nose is boozy but it's fitting. Caramel and toffee are strong in the nose, and there's a touch of sherry-like and soy sauce oxidization, as well as a distinct earthy quality. Beautiful.
The beer opens sweet with strong vanilla, toffee, and caramel notes. Oak adds a touch of spiciness. Bitterness is at a medium level with that same earthy quality I found in the flavor. Bourbon is well integrated, providing complexity while not dominating. Alcohol heat hints at a beer below 10%, rather than the high 13.5%. The fruit component is reminiscent of dates. The beer finishes refreshingly dry with some noticeable heat and a whisper of soy sauce and sherry. The beer has a low level of carbonation that works very well. This is a top notch -bal aged English Barleywine. I can't recommend it enough. This beer is a prime candidate for aging, too. 1,336 charactersHopHead84, Nov 06, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Alas, I have been waiting to try this beer for a while. 
Back story.... Purchased three of the first batch one year ago on an educated gamble (educated because Pelican is awesome; gamble because it was expensive and purchased in a mall kiosk); traded 2 of them, cellared one. All in the mean time, I have been watching the hype for this beer grow from afar, while my one remaining bottle has been tormenting me.
2009 served around 50-55ish degrees into a snifter. shared with MrMike or ipAfool
L) head is none existent--tiny bubbles cascade upwards (if the verb "cascade" can be used in an uphill motion) towards the side of the glass showing it's good carbonation. beautiful deep, dark brown-maroon while staying transparent despite color. not cloudy at all. looks amazing besides the lack of head. 
L) toffee...lots of toffee, maple syrup, currants, raisons, vanilla, oak, sweet bourbon. a little bit of heat on end. There is a lot going on. As others have mentioned, smells like its going to be sweet and syrup-like...
T) ...and not as sweet as it smells. chocolate covered raisins (raisinets), vanilla yogurt covered raisins (goat berries), toffee, caramel, and bourbon... delicious bourbon. bourbon is dominant but does not overpower or offend; like three exclamation points at the end of a poetic sentence!!! (okay...bad example).
F) what a barleywine should be...not thin, not overly thick...just perfect.. chewy and has a dry finish. Tremendous coating of mouth with an aftertaste that lingers harmoniously; I want it to be my saliva.
D) This beer should never be on drought...at least not without a limit...because I fear I will not stop drinking it. insanely drinkable do to dry finish... worth the price tag. My roommate watched an entire episode and a half of project runway and I didn't move...I didn't look up...I didn't care...I just had a shit-eating-grin on my face starring at this masterpiece. I was lost in this beer... and I did not want to find a way out.

4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an absolutely stunning deep red color that looks black in low light. Honestly one of the best colors I have seen for a beer...just menacing. Not too much head formed in my tulip, but a persistent and thick collar did form and stick around.
The smell is a sweet and inviting mix of dark fruits and wood, with surprisingly mellow bourbon. This didn't really seem too potent at first, but with every swirl of the glass came wave after wave of wonderful vanilla, toffee, and plums. Absolutely fantastic.
Holy cow....the taste is far more potent that I had imagined it would be based on the nose. And wow this is rich and decadent. Honestly, I'm sitting here and I'm trying to come up with words to describe it and all that is running through my head is WOW JESUS HOLY SHIT THIS IS WOW I CAN'T BELIVE IT HOLY SHIT. Eloquent, I know...
....but anyway, back to the beer at hand. This is utterly superb. Rich and luscious chocolate and toffee take center stage, with the bourbon and other barrel notes providing a punch that magnifies everything that is great about this beer and hides anything that could potentially be subpar. And it hides it well, because this is flawless. You know those Hershey's Skor bars? Not the most popular candy bar in the world, but one of my favorites. Dip that bar in a bath of bourbon and you have just created The Perfect Storm.
The mouthfeel on this is full and creamy and perfect. Plenty of carbonation to splash the flavors throughout the mouth, but enough heaviness that it also marinates on the tongue for an extended period after swallowing.
Drinkability is almost an afterthought with this beer. It is hugely alcoholic, so you would be crazy to want more than a bomber at a time. But that is irrelevant in my opinion, because this beer is not designed for mass consumption. It is one of the best dessert beers I have ever had, and is already one of the most memorable beers I have ever had and I'm not even done with the bomber yet. That to me is what drinkability is all about.
I really wanted to give this beer straight 5's....the only reason I docked any points was because of the weak head. Is that fair? I don't know. Everything else about the look was fantastic...but I'm just trying to be consistent with my other reviews. When I crack another one of these in the future, I will see if I still feel the same way about it as I do right now. Because right now this is on an extremely short list of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Get it now! 2,496 charactersalcstradamus, Nov 06, 2009

Taste is more of the same with a wonderful malty backbone just behind it. The only BA beer that I've ever had that took this much flavor off the barrels is Bourbon County Stout, but this one is a little less sweet, and yet still seems to have more flavor. 524 charactersPawel, Nov 05, 2009

22oz bomber, 2009 vintage, enjoyed via snifter starting at an unmeasured temperature I'll refer to as "lightly chilled". 
The aroma is amazing. Caramel, bourbon, toasted oak, buttery vanilla, a deep robust spice, and a bit of alcohol to let you know it is meant to be taken seriously. This beer has one of those smells that that I could just take in all day. The only disappointment here is that the scale only goes to five. It doesn't end there; the taste delivers on everything the aroma promises. Creamy and smooth, complex without overwhelming, sweet without being syrupy, strong without being boozy, and just enough carbonation to hold it all together. 
This beer is the real deal, and is easily among the best beers I have had the pleasure of enjoying. If you enjoy this style, then The Perfect Storm should be on your short list of beers to seek out. 888 charactersthethrone, Nov 05, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Brand new 2009 bomber, poured in a big wine glass at 54F, rising to 60F over the lengthy course of this review.
Beautiful color, a deep translucent red-brown. Initially, a ring of creamy yellow froth around the edge of the glass leaves some thick rings of lace, then dissipates entirely and the color of the liquid is unobscured, a rich gold at the edges.
Great big complex aroma. Toasty woodsy bourbony bourbon barrel, with deep complex spicy herbacious tobacco a bit like a good cigar crossed with sweet red vermouth, and sweet heady booze, a bit of bubblegum, mild vanilla, mild fennel, a hint of ripe dark fruit, and some earthiness. The bourbon barrel is well integrated with the malt; they belong together, the aroma is cohesive. Great depth and complexity, along with bright freshness, and the aroma blossoms and evolves continuously as the beer breathes and warms.
The flavor is like the aroma, but somehow even deeper, more complex, more intense. Sweet dark caramel and booze are perfectly balanced by deep, deep, DEEP tobacco/barrel/spice/earth. This is almost like a great bourbon or barrel aged rum, only far less alcoholic, and more intensely flavorful in all respects apart from the alcohol. Long long complex tasty finish, becoming dry.
The texture is exceptionally silky, with just enough restrained, ultrafine carbonation to add cushiness and avert any undue heaviness.
Perfect balance makes this very easy to drink.
Outstanding. 1,452 charactersBeerzebub, Nov 04, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I love barrel-aged barleywines and have been wanting to try this for some time. Kicked myself for not going out to the mall in Portland when it was available as late as February 2009, and thankfully to a generous trader, I was able to acquire a bottle which I still hold.
My review is for a 2009 bottle which I consider myself lucky enough to have gotten a few bottles of, thus affording me the opportunity to open one up. The 2009 StormWatcher batch was aged in the same Evan Williams barrels as the 2008 batch was. 
Whoa, this beer's aroma is pungent with vapors of vanilla, alcohol, and sweet malts as I removed the gold foil and opened it. A dark ruby/mahogany color fills my glass with a little head but there's some carbonation and lacing. Viscous, creamy, chewy, nutty, caramelly, toffee, and very bready. Can taste the oak character and bourbon as well.
This is definitely an easy sipping beer, if only to enjoy the complexities and enormity of this beer's character. I found myself inhaling the aroma each time I would sip, just to appreciate it. The alcohol presence is there but very drinkable in a smooth warming sense on the finish. I wouldn't have known it was a 13% abv. 
The buzz around this beer seems to be picking up. It's no longer a NW secret, and it shouldn't be because this is an absolutely fantastic barrel-aged barleywine. It's a keeper. 1,367 charactersbgramer, Nov 04, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Review is from notes taken on 10/13/2009. Thanks to Uncle Jedi for his generosity and sharing this. Pour is from the bottle to a snifter.
Appearance: Pours a murky coffee/caramel color; dense and nearly opaque; mild carbonation is present; no head forms at all; a thick oily residue is left on the sides of the glass and you just know that this is going to be thick in the mouth.
Smell: Deep vapors of alcohol and strong candied, almost like brandied sweetness; slightly spicey. The nose is strong and you can almost taste it just by smelling it.
Taste: Much like the smell -- strong presence of alcohol but it's well blended and not like drinking isopropyl or anything; warm sugary and brandy like sweetness mixes well with the alcohol; slight carmelized flavors are present as well.
Mouthfeel: Super viscous, very chewy and thick and slick as it slides around the mouth; very warm as well and heats the mouth, throat and belly; mouth is left tingly, sticky and a little dry from the high ABV.
Drinkability: Amazing in every aspect, but it's definitely a sipper. Not to mention the rarity of something like this would make me want to sit back and savor every last drop. I feel kind of honored just to have had it. 1,219 charactersbamadog, Nov 02, 2009

Pours the color of amber - not the reddish brown "amber" of many beers I've described, but the golden color of hardened sap. The viscosity of the beer is apparent in the appearance, with layers forming between the alcohol and syrupy liquid. The clarity is good, and a very thin skim of white head swirls atop. 
Delicious aromas from this beer. Lots of warm, spicy notes come through and are balanced by a sweet, buttery toffee smell. Dark, chewy fruit like sweet/tart raisins comes through all the rest. Alcohol is present, but not negatively. 
The taste echoes the buttery, smooth toffee from the nose. It is nutty and creamy and not too sweet. A cinnamony spiciness accompanies dark, syrupy-sweet fruitiness like raisins and prunes. The alcohol is not nearly as mellow as in the nose. Its sharpness is nearly medicinal. The rest of the flavors do a good job of keeping it from ruining the taste. 
Feel is as thick and viscous as anticipated. The syrupy liquid coats the entire palate and enjoyably prolongs the taste. The heat of the alcohol is warming through the chest, and the beer goes down very smoothly despite the heat of the alcohol. 
Moderate drinkability at best, as with most of this style. It definitely has the potential for masquerading as a highly-drinkable beer due to the excellent flavors and smooth drink. Gotta be careful with this one. 1,508 characterskels, Oct 19, 2009

4.97/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This will probably be my only review, ever; Rhinos00 split a 22oz with me on the condition that I review it. Poured into a 10 oz snifter. Simple brown bottle with silk screen print, like their other beers. Aged in '98 Evan Williams barrels.
Very deep mahogany color. When held up to light - shows a deep red glowing spot light. A cream colored head that only sticks around the edges of the glass. The center of the beer doesn't hold any head; instead a small area of carbonation bubbles keeps it interesting.
I can't describe how perfect this beer smells. Amazing combination of alcohol, whiskey, and wet malt. If inhaled enough it creates a burning sensation. It took me 10 minutes to build up the courage to taste, out of fear that it wouldn't live up to the aroma.
It lived up to the aroma. Toasted bread, alcohol, molasses, prunes, vanilla; a nectar fit for gods. I want to jump right ahead to mouthfeel. It didn't occur to me until I tasted this beer just how English this Barleywine is.
Most amazing mouthfeel of any Barleywine. Creamy. Possibly the best mouthfeel of any beer. If you didn't have taste buds and you closed your eyes, you might think you have a cream stout in your mouth. 
I haven't read Rhinos00's review, he may have said this: "Although you would get hammered, you could easily drink a bomber of this. It is just too good to only have one ten ounce snifter if there is more in front of you." 
This beer is going to give Pelican one of the greatest reputations in the country. The last sip made me shudder in oral-gasm. My belly is warm, my soul content. 1,584 charactersPecorasc, Jul 18, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter. Batch #1, Bottle 1 of 500. Split with BA Pecorasc. Huge thanks to Mychal for hooking this guy up!!!
A- Pours a dark burgundy with garnet hues throughout. Produces a fingers width of tan head, reduces to a thin layer over consumption. Some retention.
S- Absolutely perfect. It's potentcy should be legendary. The way the complex aromas melded together is definitely worth noting. On one hand, big notes of vanilla come forth from the bourbon barrels. In addition a gentle sweetness is detectable from the caramel malts. Also noticing some chocolate malts and various dark fruits...almost like prunes drizzled in toffee and then soaked in bourbon. If you inhale just enough, you can feel the hairs inside your nose start to burn.
T- Just as complex as the aroma. The one big thing I'm noticing is that the intense flavors of this beer just linger for minutes after each sip. Upfront I'm getting notes of caramel and vanilla. Just as these flavor set in, a distinct rich bourbon flavor kicks in. Alongside are various notes of toffee and chocolate malts. The finish is boozy and intense with the combination of flavors mentioned above. There is also a sweetness that is not as easy to pick up in the aroma. Very complex and rich. Perfect, no other way to describe it. Interesting to note that after a while, you become desensitized with the alcohol notes and can pick up more of the sweetness.
M- This is what really put the beer over the top for me. Rich and velvety, everything I could want. So smooth. Definitely world class.
D- While this beer is nearing 14% abv, it is so delicious and perfectly crafted that I could definitely drink a bomber of this no problem. 
Overall, this is honestly one of the best beers I have ever had. The only beer that can even hold a candle to it is a 2002 De Dolle Oerbier Reserva I have had recently. This beer will put Pelican on the maps. Bravo!!! 1,933 charactersrhinos00, Jul 17, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +12%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 ounce bottle off to the side during the Pizza Port Belgian Beer Party on 3/28/09, reviewed from notes on my cell phone, thanks to vurt for bringing this gem that he formerly bought at a mall kiosk, how awesome of story that is, very cool of you to bring this along Eric and I truly enjoyed this to say the least, he gave me a generous six ounce pour in my Chimay goblet
A-Very dark brown with several bright red highlights, 1 1/4 inch creamy and foamy beige head that lasts the whole time I was drinking it, that is crazy for a beer that spent this long in a barrel, great legs as well
S-Bourbon, vanilla, strong oak, sugar, donuts, white cake mix, charcoal, milk chocolate, some dark cocoa nibs too, espresso, cream, toffee, caramel, toasted bread, various dark fruits, and a hint of syrah wine
T-Starts off with a nice sweet character than was a bit like a dessert wine, lots of caramel malt along with a variety of breads in the middle, big vanilla finish with a lingering bourbon aftertaste, then a bit of coffee and more roasted accents come to the surface, still followed by a sweet and oaky vanilla flavor, later on a bit of cake and milk chocolate tootise roll-like flavors arrive in the finish, each sip was something different and all of that was good, this beer has bourbon characteristics but is not that boozy at all, not even that dry from the wood, its seemed the barrel aging just enhanced the great flavors that were already there, great overall and balanced at all points even if the tastes changed so dramatically often, outstanding flavor
M-Sweet, warm, chewy, and earthy mouthfeel, medium to full bodied, this brew is as rich as they come but you keep wanting more, syrupy texture with moderate carbonation, taste lasts a long time but you still want it to be longer
D-Yeah right this stuff is thirteen and a half percent, it taste more like eight, alcohol is hidden incredibly, this stuff is quite easy to drink and that is saying a lot because it has so much flavor, smooth until the very last sip, insane drinkability
Best barleywine I have ever except for a certain one from Midnight Sun, this beer is outstanding, has everything a barrel aged beer should, talk about an introduction to a brewery, wow, I plan on buying two different vintages of Stormwatcher soon and comparing them to this beautiful BA version, Evan Williams Single Barrel is my favorite whiskey and this certainly made this beer unforgettable, wish this stuff was more attainable but according to several people there was not much of it made and it sold out pretty quickly, one of the top beers of 2009 for me, I want more now, cannot recommend this enough 2,655 charactersFloydster, Apr 03, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5*First release: Nov. 2008*
I had this beer at the Pizza Port Belgian Beer Party on March 28th thanks fellow BA "vurt" for sharing such an incredible beer.
Ok, so let me start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of barleywines (although I do enjoy the English style) but this beer really blew me away. One of the best beers I've had in a while.
Poured a brown sugar color with minimal head but the color looks nice in the glass.
The smell was outstanding, bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted malts, fruitiness, raisins, figs, more toast, boozy in the background, toasted oak, and tootsie rolls (chocolate and caramel).
My first reaction was "wow!" Sweet bourbon flavors upfront, sweet dark fruits, cherries, oak, brown sugar, vanilla, toasted coconut, and tootsie roll candy. More chocolate opens up and caramel candy, alcohol in the finish with some fruity esters. Medium high carbonation, very soft, sliky and drinkable. 
What a great beer! 948 charactersseaoflament, Mar 30, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A couple of weeks ago, my wife and I were watching tv, and she suggested that it was a good occasion for me to "open one of your expensive bottles of beer". Since she's a hophead, I was a little hesitant to open a $20 bottle of The Perfect Storm that we had picked up on our last vacation, but she assured me that I could open whatever I wanted and she'd do her part.
I poured her a small sample in my 2008 GABF glass, and put the rest into my pint glass. That was probably a mistake because this beer deserves your best glass.
My first impression was that I was surprised how well it was carbonated. There was a good hiss when I popped the cap, but then even a few minutes after pouring the beer, there seemed to be a lot of bubbles coming off the beer long after the head had receded. 
For the most part, this is a dark beer and there is very little to notice about the color. Every once in a while, however, you'll get a glimpse of a very dark red, sort of a garnet color that lets you know that there is a clarity to the beer that isn't apparent at first glance.
The smell makes you think that this will be a very sweet, if not cloying experience. You definitely get the smell of bourbon, as well as the sweet smells of malty chocolate and vanilla. I suppose the good carbonation makes these smells seem more robust than they otherwise would without so much CO2.
My first sip was not the experience that I expected. It was a lot drier than the smell would make me think. That first sip made me re-think this beer. If it had been an overly sweet, syrupy mess, I would have thought that the smell was a perfect representation of the beer I would be drinking. Instead, this beer is very well attenuated, and the bourbon, malty chocolate and vanilla flavors are present in a much more subdued and delicious experience. 
There is another thing about this beer that is worth mentioning. It has a velvety smoothness about it that could easily be masked by the harshness of its alcohol level. The brewer has done a magnificent job of balancing the sweetness with the dryness to give a beer experience that is definitely worth repeating.
This is one of those few beers that I have had that make me question if the other beers I have really loved were really that good. I can see why Pelican has decided to charge $20 per bomber. It is still a great deal, even at that price. 2,376 charactersSvejk, Feb 05, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bomber (1 of only 500) poured into my my Delirium snifter, The Perfect Storm is a dark garnet with a smaller, light tan head that leaves a pretty thick collar but no lace. Still, it had a great amber glow and the head was impressively sized, with a nice crackle to it. 
Smell is loads of vanilla, some caramel and light wafts of bourbon. I was going to ding it a 1/2 point for not being overly complex, but it's just too good. 
Taste is very rich and complex but very smooth for the heft. Like the nose, I'm getting a lot more vanilla then bourbon from the barrel, which I really love. There are some nice raisin and prune notes as well, and a light touch of herbal hops, super tasty. I think this was the 07 Stormwatchers before the 4 months in the barrel (the '11' in sharpie on the cap indicates when it was bottled), so it's at least a year in aging, even though it's labeled an 08 release - and you can tell, even though there's obviously a nice belly warming from the high ABV. Paired nicely with a variety of sharp cheddar's from Tillamook and Dubliner. 
Mouthfeel is has a sugary stickiness and some very fine carbonation, but a relatively light body for the size. 
Drinkability is dangerously high for such a hefty barleywine, super tasty and a real momentum builder. I kept having to remind myself of the hefty price tag and extremely limited availability so that I really savored the aftertaste of every sip, rather then compulsively chase it with another! Good enough in fact to let them slide for the condofication of Pacific City. The price though, is prohibitive, and really the biggest knock on this beer. 1,625 charactersccrida, Jan 01, 2009
4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz. bottle purchased at the seriously convenient Pelican Brewing kiosk at the Washington Square mall in Portland, OR. (Possibly the most useful mall kiosk I have ever seen.) Enjoyed in a Piraat snifter.
Appearance:
This brew is a gorgeous deep red-amber, perfectly clear with burnt orange highlights. The heavy, sticky head is a lighter version of the color of a manila envelope. The beer looks a bit viscous when you swirl it around. It coats the glass and leaves behind grainy sheets of lacing. Excellent color and texture for the style.
Smell:
A sticky toffee pudding with vanilla bourbon sauce. Plenty of sweet bready and malty aromas, with caramel and buttery toffee on top. Prominent bourbon and vanilla notes blend gracefully with the malt, adding dimension without grabbing the spotlight. The finish brings to mind almonds and dark brown sugar. There is also a significant alcohol component, as you would expect from a young beer of almost 14% ABV.
Taste:
Starts off with strong toasted malt and butterscotch flavors. A slight saltiness makes me think of sea salt caramels. There is also vanilla and significant bourbon and oak. The bourbon character increases as the beer warms, but never threatens to overwhelm the beer's other flavors. The middle is full of raisin and quince flavors, concentrated and lush. Some hop bitterness comes through at the very end, but it is an accent rather than a dominant component. This is definitely an English-style barley wine.
Mouthfeel:
Full-bodied, mouth-coating, and magnificently smooth. Carbonation is soft and discreet, adding just enough bite on the palate to prevent this beer from being shapeless and cloying. Alcohol is clearly present and provides warmth, but is very nicely integrated and not the least bit harsh.
Drinkability:
The Perfect Storm is smooth, sweet, velvety, and astonishingly drinkable. The balance between toasted malt, toffee, raisin, and bourbon is almost miraculous. I am glad to have a couple more bottles put aside to age, though I'm not quite sure how much better it could get. (I suppose it could dry out a bit, and maybe lose a bit of alcohol heat.) Right now, The Perfect Storm is beautiful to look at, wonderful to smell, and an absolute pleasure to drink. Magnificent.
May 22, '09 edit: I have no bottles left at this point. If you're trying to find some, I think it's well worth the effort to keep looking. 2,401 charactersvurt, Dec 25, 2008
