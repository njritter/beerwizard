4.68/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Canned 6 days ago and drank side by side a 2-week-old can of regular Fort Point.
L -- Classic Trillium orange juice color with a little more carbonation than usual. Aerated pour produces a finger of solid white head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a little lacing. 
S -- Tons of pungent tropical fruits: pineapple, mango, orange, papaya, the whole nine yards. A little of that garlic smell galaxy hops produce as well. Cracker malts. Quite similar to regular Fort Point, but more piercing and intense 
T -- Very similar to Fort Point, but like with the aroma, it is slightly more pungent and flavorful. Less grassiness on the finish
O -- A great modification to an already great beer. Galaxy hops are just fabulous and the fact that Trillium doesn't up the price makes it – in my opinion – their best value offering. This is the first, and as of yet only, Trillium beer that I believe is fully worth the price point. Buy this by the case if you can!

On the plus side, this has a very nice tropical-citrus vibe on the nose and a crisp cracker malt on the taste.  It is super solid all-round with plenty to like in the nose and flavor.  Side by side with another Trillum beer (Double Dry Hopped Stillings Street) it falls a little short.  Comparer to Treehouse, which I visited a few weeks prior, it has quite a bit less nose, but the increased bitterness really helps the finish follow through.  Overall, a top-notch beer that happens to compete with even better beers in the local. 617 characterscaptaincoffee, May 08, 2017

A -  Cloudy golden-orange with a 2-finger white head and great lace.
S - Peach, pineapple, mango, papaya, pine, orange,  mild-moderately dank, nutmeg and floral.  A juice bomb.
T - Overly-ripe pineapple and moderate dankness with some pepper and earthy spice.  Then some biscuit, pine, mint, lime flesh and zest, and a mild-medium bitterness.  Finish that is fruity, spicy and moderately bitter.  
M - Medium body and carbonation.  Resinous and soft going down and a little prickly in the finish.  
O - The galaxy adds some nice notes to the base brew.  Tropical, spicy, soft and some bitterness.  Really good. Liked it a little more than regular Fort Point Pale Ale. 743 charactersTucquan, Mar 22, 2017

3.84/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4L: Looks like orange juice in a glass. Incredibly cloudy, light orange color with a thin layer of white head on top. Not really many bubbles streaming to the top.
S: Smells like orange juice. Really all that I am getting in the nose are different fruits: orange, mango, peach, pineapple, etc. It smells like a mixed fruit juice. Not really much of a piney or resinous hop profile, but there is a hint of alcohol on the nose.
T: Tastes much like it smells. It's a juice bomb. Fruity at the front and fruity at the back. Again, not much in the way of a bitter hop profile. It even finishes with hints of pulpy sweetness.
F: Smooth with a little bit of an alcohol burn. Again, it has the consistency of juice. Good body for a pale ale though.
O: For any other brewery, this beer would be great. For Trillium, I am a little underwhelmed. I've had a number of their beers, and to me, this isn't their best. It quite literally looks, tastes, and feels like juice. 961 charactersBiggtriksta, Feb 27, 2017

The beer looks great, although that in and of itself isn't much of a distinguishing factor (since everyone's hopping on the hazy train). Nose is excellent; I've found that galaxy hops tend to lend themselves very well to this style of beer. The feel of the beer is also really well done--Most of the local NE IPAs will either have a full mouthfeel or good amounts of carbonation, not both. Taste is galaxy through and through; delicious, as long as you like galaxy hops. 
I don't think this is head and tails above the Chicago-area stuff I've tried, but it's definitely delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying more from the Boston area. One of the best NE IPAs I've had. 737 charactersSeanBond, Jan 31, 2017

Nose has notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, ripe peach, and guava.  Taste is grapefruit heavy with moderately high bitterness.  The citrus and passion fruit elements are much more muted than in the smell.  Body is medium with decent carbs, but the bitterness almost becomes prickly.  Overall, another good APA from this brewery but a little unbalanced by the hops. 453 characterslemmy187, Jan 26, 2017

Taste is pineapple, mango, light cracker, and then grapefruit rind at the end.  Super juicy, sweetish with a sharp bitter blast at the end, medium bodied and medium carbonation.  A really enjoyable sipper of a beer.  Well worth seeking out.  After having tried all of the Fort Point variations to this point I would probably rank them Mosiac, Galaxy, Fort Point, Double Dry Hopped, and then Nelson. 466 characterstigg924, Jan 11, 2017

4.27/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Trillium Galaxy Dry-Hopped Fort Point
A: This Trillium skates dangerously close to the pond water opacity that is Tree House, staying just on this side of murky. It is full of particulate reminiscent of its forefather Heady Topper. These particles are tossed about by the rather active carbonation, which also contributes to an impressive retention and a settling into thick, dense crust of the once two-finger cream-colored head. Lacing is also very good. As with most of these DDH beers, some will find the yeast and hop matter off-putting, but it is an otherwise brilliant example of the NE IPA substyle. 4.75/5
A: Strong peach and apricot notes dominate a juicy cuvée of grapefruit and orange juice. A resinous dankness lurks underneath, as expected of the sometimes heavily bitter Galaxy hop. Interesting notes of papaya and passionfruit lie partially hidden underneath the earthy grass and pine. Finally, a crackery malt serves as the canvas for the entire beer. This seems exceedingly well-balanced and reined in, despite the sometimes overbearing Galaxy. 4.5/5
T: Unfortunately, Galaxy refused to be tamed in the taste. Bitter grass, resinous pine, earthy dankness, and bitter grapefruit pith dominate the tongue initially and hardly let up. It is possible to pick out some juicy peach, melon, and passion fruit underneath the rampaging Galaxy (especially in the aftertaste), but overall this is heavily dominated by earthy, almost spicy bitterness. Orange juice comes out more each sip, but bitter citrus rind also builds in much the same way. Lemon and lightly bitter floral notes are present in the aftertaste as well. The malt is very dry and crackery, lending only a slight kiss of sweetness that is all but drowned out by the hops. As with many DDH beers, this one is too hoppy for its own good, covering up some of the great complexity, but it is still very tasty. 4.25/5
M: Again, the hops are just too much here. The bitterness puts a toe into unpleasant territory becoming almost medicinally astringent and chalky. The beer is very dry, yet the feel is typically medium full and creamy, astonishingly so for a pale ale. Carbonation is prickly yet soft, right where it should be. The sharp bitterness on the end just proves too much for the rest of the beer, and paradoxically a stickiness is left on the lips. 4/5
O: I know that I am in the minority with finding the DDH iterations of these beers less palatable than their regular counterparts, but the hoppiness is just too much sometimes. The well-crafted balance of the "normal" versions displays all the complexity with better drinkability in a more enjoyable package. High end hop heads and west-coast fans will definitely prefer the DDH beers, but give me the good, old-fashioned juicy NE IPA any day. Pair with Cattle Decapitation's "The Anthropocene Extinction," which was also grand in its own way at the expense of much of the nuance and personality that made "Monolith of Inhumanity" so compelling. 4/5 2,987 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Nov 30, 2016

Aroma starts with peach and passionfruit, huge explosion citrus and stone fruits followed by a hint of dankness.
Taste is really big on the juicy, bright, tropical, stone fruit aspect of the beer. Orange peel, pineapple, peach, apricot, grapefruit juice, grapefruit pith, dankness, resin and a subtle grassy note too. 
Lighter side of medium bodied, crisp and clean, semi-dry finish.

A: Poured into a Duvel tulip. Body is light apricot in color with no real head (just a thin film) and no lacing. 
S: Biscuity, crackery malt underneath, then citrusy grapefruit and tropical fruit. Touch of white grapes/chardonnay. Not a strong nose, but certainly a pleasant one. 
T: Pretty much follows the nose, with a crackery malt foundation followed by grapefruit, citrus/grapefruit peel, white grapes and grape skin, tropical fruit and even lime at times. Finishes with a nice bitterness that offsets the modest sweetness well. I really like the flavors going on here. 
M: Call it medium in heft, with a juicy creaminess to the feel.
O: Excellent beer. Many thanks to Keith for sharing this one (and many others). 828 charactersKendo, Nov 03, 2016

Pours very hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, mango, melon, passion fruit, papaya, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, mango, melon, passion fruit, papaya, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, honey, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, mango, melon, passion fruit, papaya, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/grainy mouthfeel that is nice. Minimal warming alcohol for 6.6%. Overall this is an incredible pale ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. This is more bitter, resinous, and drying than their IPAs; but still very bright/juicy on hops and highly enjoyable. 1,971 characterssuperspak, Nov 01, 2016

Smell is incredible. Just straight up fresh sliced fruit. Notes of peach, mango, melon and orange. There is a hint of the fresh galaxy hops coming through in a fresh hop aroma almost grassy?  
Taste is extremely fruity - lots of fresh mango, peach, melon, orange, and some orange juice. Maybe a hint of orange or melon rind like bitterness but its not much. Touch of grassy hops on the finish. 
Feel is smooth and thick. Prickly carbonation provides some pop. 
Overall this is a lovely beer. Its solidly in the fruity IPA end of the spectrum in spite of the bitterness in the finish. Really an exceptional beer that has to be tasted to understand the hype. 864 charactersFBarber, Oct 12, 2016

PUNGENT. This has the most pungent aroma of any Trillium beer I've had. Piney resin, orange rind, and plastic. This is far more hardcore and West Coast than I expected, but it's still firmly Trillium. There's also that odd apple/rice wine vinegar that some of their IPAs showcase, with lemon zest, pickled peppers, and Sweet Tarts.
Taste is tangy, acidic pine, with orange zest, and a fresh cannabic resin straight out of the bowl. I also get that weird pickled pepper and cucumber.
Medium light body, crisp and semi-dry. I had high hopes, I love Fort Point, and really love their other DDH brews, but this is just a downright weird one. 699 charactersSabtos, Oct 07, 2016

The floral Galaxy presence is here in full effect and asserts itself beautifully.
This is a damned tasty beer that owns the Galaxy hop and starts with a really palatable bitterness that evolves into a great citric bouquet. Without hyperbole, this beer is downright majestic, tangerine notes prevailing. If you can clap hands on it, do so without hesitation! 434 charactersTrenary, Sep 26, 2016

This one is loaded with fruit. Mangoes, melons, blood orange all show. Very tropical and juicy. Herbal and earthy. Not bitterness or weedy flavors. The dry hopping adds a lot to the nose and some slight flavor variation from the base beer.
Really solid offering. Easy to drink a pint. Top notch. 330 charactersmothman, Sep 26, 2016

Strong citrus - mango and pineapple mixed with pungent hops.
Taste is a back and forth of hops and citrus - more grapefruit, more lemon/lime, subtle sweetness, some malt, some resin.
Mouthful is medium, a touch creamy, a touch coating.  Carbonation is average to high.  Finish is dry.
Super drinkable.  Balanced.  Enjoyable.  Would recommend this to anyone. 468 charactersSlack, Sep 24, 2016

Pours cloudy pale yellow with a half-inch off-white head that remains as a ring and wisps on top and leaves strands of lace. Looks like a glass of grapefruit juice. The smell is of grapefruit, tropical fruit and faint pine. The taste follows with bitter grapefruit juice, subtle tropical fruit and a hint of pine on the finish. Full texture with crisp carbonation. Refreshing and flavorful. An outstanding pale ale. 435 charactersFurlinator, Sep 06, 2016

The pour looks like orange juice on nitro. Nose is very sweet: tropical, with an emphasis on the mango, plus rock sugar. 
Fort Point - Galaxy Dry Hopped & my flash-impression is ‘watery’. Very thin. Flavor is good, with lots of tropical notes, especially mango, oranges, grapefruit, lime, damp grass. Widespread bitterness mid-palate; pith of the grapefruit is what hangs around. Easy to slug. 
This beer was like getting Milana Vayntrub alone & finding out it’s all push-up bra. Pretty good beer, but the thin  mouthfeel is a real kick in the erection. 692 charactersmaximum12, Aug 21, 2016

The flavor is a pineapple lover's dream. The feel is perfect, really. I have had enough New England juice bombs to confidently say this beer's feel is as good as it gets. It's full and soft yet well carbed and nicely bitter to remind you that it's actually a beer. Overall this beer has completely changed my outlook on Trillium. That's not to say I haven't been impressed, but I was kind of feeling like I didn't "get it." Now I get it. 519 charactersCayseyW, Aug 11, 2016

They were very good but not great. I just picked up some fresh cans of Galaxy DH FP from the CS Location while visiting Boston and it's outstanding! Looks golden yellow with great foam and lacing. Smells lemony citrus. Taste and feel are fantastic with lemon, pineapple, and tangerine. As it warms, I get an oaky, smooth vanilla flavor that brings this beer to another level! Drinks so smooth that you want more. Great Beer! Now I understand the fuss about Trillium! 560 charactersELS, Aug 08, 2016

S - big grapefruit, tangerine, kiwi, orange, lemon, lime, there's a tartness that bites your nose, almost smells like hpnotiq the blue liqour
T - big grapefruit, orange pith, lemon, lime, kiwi, bitter, lots and lots of tropical fruits, getting that same hpnotiq flavor that I got on the nose
M - medium mouthfeel, very bitter, alcohol covered, aftertaste is bitter grapefruit and citrus peel, like you chewed orange peel 
O - bam. What a beer. It's crazy that it can be that fruity just from the hops. 587 charactersHopHunter19, Aug 04, 2016

Crushable and refreshing brew with fresh hop character.  I tend to like a bit less bite from carbonation than the fort point series brings, but that's about the only flaw.  Superbly hoppy refreshing brew. 479 charactersHopBomb515, Jul 21, 2016

The beer pours an incredibly hazy and cloudy orange color, quite turbid with a finger or so of fluffly white head, moderate retention but beautiful lace sweeps around the glass. The aroma is killer, huge tropical fruit expression, juicy and bright, lots of pineapple, mango with tangerine citrus and some grapefruit peel bitterness, light pine and earthiness, resinous and assertive with some sweet malt at the finish. The flavors boom out of the glass, loads of snappy fresh pineapple, juicy stone fruits, peach, nectarine, grapefruit peel bitterness along with some grassiness and spicy green hop flavor while a doughy malt finish offers some sweetness and complexity. The mouthfeel is great, coating, medium body yet it feels substantive but at the same time gentle and easy with moderate carbonation and a quenching finish, light dryness.
Verdict: A wonderful pale ale from Trillium, loads of hoppy flavor, nice complexity, nice brightness and so refreshing. Perhaps a bit on the bitter and aggressive side for a pale ale, but this is an excellent beer that was perfect on a warm night in Chicago. 1,168 characterskevanb, Jul 12, 2016

Deep gold / light amber color and very hazy with a creamy white head. Wonderful fruity aroma combining citrus, stone, and tropical fruits. Bready malt providing balance for the hops. Spicy, piney hops get added to the mix upon tasting, creating a bitter finish that was not as smooth as I had hoped for. Great tasting, but I was ready for a change of pace after half of the bottle. 429 charactersJacobob10, Jun 27, 2016

4.67/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75First beer I've tried from Trillium.
Bottle dated June 10 and poured on June 20 into a 16 oz tulip.  Purchased at the brewery in Canton.
Looks spot on for a cloudy APA.  Golden orange with a decent finger of foam.
Smell is just not present, kinda disappointing, I expected more.
Taste made up for the lack of aroma.  I picked up grapefruit, mango and stone fruit with a refreshing finish of mild malt.
Feels thinner that what I expected, but still thick enough and good carbonation.
Overall, at $8.05 per bottle it's competitive with Treehouse and I'm thinking I might get hooked.  Especially since they don't ration it out like it's the prohibition era.
Editing and revising my rating upward after trying a second bottle that spent a couple more weeks in the fridge.  This is an outstanding APA. 796 characterscrotharagain, Jun 21, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Wow...mediocre bottle?  Dated 10 May and never allowed to warm. Have had a couple of weeks of fantastic New England beers...Abner, Double Galaxy (HF), Swish, Juilus, and Trilium Artaic and was blown away by all so maybe taste buds are dead. Was really looking forward to this but it is not rising up to my expectations and other reviews. Beautiful color and pour. Nose is subdued -- expected big Galaxy bouquet.  flavor mostly pith, very light hints of other expected tropicals. This is by no means a bad beer and is in fact very good...just not world class and in the league with the others mentioned earlier. 
Have to believe It could be the bottle. Love the regular Fort Point so will try to pick this one up again next time I am in town and give it another try. 766 characters11-52_4hops, Jun 11, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours very cloudy, almost as if cream were added. Gives an opaque appearance despite the pale gold color. Decent had that settles to primarily rim bubbles. Plenty of streaky lace after the initial ring of lace. 
Clean crisp aroma of (briefly) pale malt. The rest is an aromatic, prickly piney hop. Attractive. 
This is a very big beer. The malt is potent at the beginning with a touch of alcohol warmth. The carbonation brings out the bitterness early, culminating in the swallow. It doesn't cross over to extreme but it does toe the line. Chewy body with long lingering, but reasonably subtle, aftertaste. 608 characterssmcolw, May 29, 2016

The nose is all fruit mostly tropical with mango, pineapple and grapefruit coming through the strongest.
The taste is mostly the fruit with little or no presence of the malt to be found. Lots of mango and citrus flavors all the way through this beer. Perhaps a little light malt way in the back.
The mouthfeel is creamy smooth with nice carbonation.
Not a lot more can be said about this great Pale Ale from Trillium. So glad to see with the opening of there second brewery there beer is a little easier to get. 635 characterssmanson56, May 23, 2016

Appearance: one of the best looking beers I've ever poured. Pours a super bright orange, with a pure white, heavily lingering head. Leaves tons of sticky lace. Body is incredibly hazy, and looks exactly like even brighter orange juice.
Aroma: like all Trillium hops, this has tons and tons of fruit aroma popping out of the bottle. Mango, peach, and grapefruit. I smelled no malt whatsoever, it's all hops.
Taste: super soft, yet potent fruit flavors, paired with some mild bitterness and a light base of mild malt. So much citrus and tropical fruit. There's a touch of raw hop flavor too, but it's not enough to deter from the fruity delicious of the hops at hand.
Feel: very full-bodied for a pale ale, this beer is creamy and fills the palate with flavor and some stickiness.
Overall: one of Trillium's best beers, and one of the best hoppy beers period. 909 charactersTheElectricOne, May 22, 2016

Just an awesome summer time beer.  So light and juicy that it even made me question if it was a pale ale.  Looks and smell wise was awesome and the taste is truly where it is at.  Juice bomb and so light and refreshing.  Just damn.  Overall this will be above some of the rarer beers from TBC in my priority when buying from them in the future. 392 charactersBEEPOP, May 21, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an undated bottle into a 12 ounce nonic glass.  Pours hazy pineapple juice/grapefruit juice color.  It's completely opaque with a solid two finger white head on a vigorous pour.  The head reduces slowly and remnants are there for long after the pour, leaving incredible lacing.  The smell is all fruit juice - pineapple, grapefruit, and orange.  The pineapple is so strong I almost mixed in some Bacardi.  The mouthfeel is medium to high carbonation, smooth and ever so slightly oily.  The taste hits you with strong hops immediately, but only slightly bitter, which lingers after the taste.  There is a strong presence of fruit under the hops, mostly pineapple but also some orange.  I'm getting just a hint of malt at the finish.  Overall this beer is fantastic, and I'm very sad I'm unlikely to ever have it again. 829 charactersjvgoor3786, Apr 24, 2016

It looks like pulp-less, hazy orange juice. Mostly citrus aromatics and the taste is incredibly orange and lemony. However, the bitterness is nearly non-existent with a sweet/malt balance that makes this brew smooth as can be. 337 charactersTrevor11, Apr 10, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L - typical Trillium. Warm, glowing off-orange. Opaque enough without letting light through, but not turbid. Inviting. 
S - total Galaxy up front. Bready wheaty crackers. Rounds out with some slightly sour bitter (dry?) hops. Orange juice. Pineapple. 
T - sweet candied orange juice with a huge sticky breadiness that almost expands outward as you sip. Creates a layer of Galaxy goodness that sort of hovers above the rest of the beer. The dry hopping creates a flavor effect like Saturn's rings, whatever that means. Pineapple of course and a surprisingly mild bitterness. Galaxy hop blanket soothes and comforts. Nice, balanced flavor. 
F - soft and flowing as usual. Works especially well with this dry hop. 
O - a very tame Fort Point. Mellow, but elegant and well-done. Class in a glass! 796 charactersagreenman19, Apr 05, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a hazy orange with off white head. The fragrance of tangerine/tangerine peel emanates from the glass. It smells incredible. There is a touch of malt sweetness, followed by a cascade of citrus. On the whole, it's quite dry and pleasant. It's a little more one note than the regular FPPA, which benefits from contrasting hop usage. The galaxy and the columbus run together in providing a citrus note versus the tropical and citrus notes of the original's citra and columbus. For many breweries, this would be their best pale ale, for Trillium, that is not the case. I say that tongue in cheek. Well, with my tongue out. 623 charactersSheppard, Mar 24, 2016

Tough to distinguish from an IPA and a pale ale, but hard to go wrong with any fresh and hoppy offering from trillium. Pretty good value - 8 bucks for a 25.4 oz bomber. Looking forward to trying the other variations for comparison. 253 characters20holmbrew, Mar 16, 2016

4.76/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Pours bright orange with very little head. Could easily be mistaken for some tropical juice. Really fantastic color.
The smell continues to give the impression of a fruit juice. Mangos, citrus fruits, some citrusy hops. Mostly smells like a glass of mango juice.
Now that is delicious! That mango comes through strong in the taste. Lots of pineapple. Lots of citrusy hops. This is juice beer at its best.
Medium bodied and lighter carbonation. Those bright, light juicy favors and aromas were a bit deceptive in the mouthfeel as this is a fuller bodied pale ale than I was expecting. Sticky finish that leaves lingering flavors of pineapple and mango.
This is a fantastic dry hopped pale ale/juice bomb that leaves me wanting another bottle. 745 charactersRoninTK3, Mar 14, 2016

Pours a dull, milky, hazy orange with a turbid clarity and a loose, white head that quickly disperses towards the shoulders into a frothy band.  Great nose - citrus, passionfruit and pith.   Taste is not as juicy as one would anticipate from the nose - more herbal and pithy than fruity but also a little watery.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a kiss of acidity.  Overall, I was expecting more from this beer given the hype train around it. Solid, but nothing to write home about in my opinion. 553 charactersJwale73, Mar 06, 2016

Pours a turbid dark golden color with a dense creamy white foam head. Smells like peach, pineapple, mango, guava, passionfruit, earthy grass and mild minty pine. Tastes like tropical fruity citrus, some mango, pineapple, big passionfruit notes, some guava, mild grain, with a light bitter dank pine finish. Feels medium bodied, creamy with low carbonation. Overall a nice take on the already great Fort Point pale ale. 447 charactersStoutElk_92, Mar 05, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Reviewing from notes after I received and drank this after a great trade with BA Shaggy9356. I was honestly surprised when I was looking through Trillium and found several that I thought I had reviewed already. This is one of the ones that I was luck enough to still have my notes. Poured from a brown 750 mL bomber into a standard shaker pint glass.
Appearance (4.5) - I have to admit that I sat and admired this one in the glass for a little bit before drinking. Partly due to giving the two fingers of frothy head dissipate, leaving sticky cobwebs of lace along the sides of the glass and partly because it's quite striking. Underneath the off-white meringue of head is a turbid, opaque body the color of jasmine and straw with darker, more amber low-lights in the shadowed part of the glass.
Smell (4.5) - Lots of fruit dominates the nose, with elements of guava and pineapple as well as citrus in the vein of orange zest, starfruit and red grapefruit. Hard to make out much beyond the huge fruit notes from the hops, but there are some hints of light cracker breadiness if you look (smell) hard enough.
Taste (4.25) - Many of the same elements from the nose, but surprisingly subdued compared to the vibrant smell. Generic tropical fruit with some hints at the pineapple and guava that I picked up in the smell, and now the citrus comes through in more of a grapefruit rind bitterness on the finish. I do like that the bitterness is strong enough to offset the stronger fruit component, but I wish overall the flavor was a little more pungent.
Mouthfeel (4.25) - Medium body with moderate carbonation and a full, juicy feel to it.
Overall (4.5), a beer that is quite delicious. A little clouidier that I perfer my beers, but I can't deny the aesthetic appeal of the beer once it's in the glass--not all turbid IPAs look so good in my opinion. Still, it's dangerously easy to drink and goes down like hop juice. 1,920 charactersLambicPentameter, Feb 10, 2016

Galaxy hops are quickly become my favorite and this is a hoppy pale ale, the wheat and barley really are forward on it with sweet juiciness balanced with a light bite of bitterness on the back end. A very nice mf, plan on thoroughly enjoying the second pour off the bottle. Another solid brew from Trillium. 405 charactersbeantown_hopster, Jan 30, 2016

A: Lemon yellow in color, and murky as swamp water. Fine-bubbled white head stands at a quarter inch. Spotty lacing.
S: Peach, pineapple, lemon drop candy, juicy pear, mango. Somewhat spicy and leafy too. Doughy and bready malt base. Bit yeasty.
T: Tangy passion fruit, peach, pineapple, mango. Spicy, wet leaves. Somewhat stiff limey bitterness. Doughy malt base. Bit yeasty. Lemon candy, hop spice, and leaves in the finish.
M: Medium bodied with that chewy and full unfiltered feel. Carbonation tingles in a stiff way. 
O: A modern and trendy take on the American Pale ale. More in line with what people are calling 'New England Style IPAs.' Every Boston area hipster will probably tell you this is their favorite beer. You know what? It ain't bad though. 797 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 30, 2016

4.71/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured 1/11/16 from a 64oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 1/9/16, into a large mug glass.
A: The beer is a dark cloudy gold color, with a large foamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains a large amount of grassy hops blended nicely with fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out a strong fruity citrus sweetness along with come caramel. Then a strong piney hops bitterness quickly follows and strengthens as you continue to drink the beer. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a long time. I did not notice much of a difference between this beer and the regular Fort Point Pale Ale aside from the typical drop-off in freshness from letting the growler sit in the fridge for 2 days. Both were excellent. 1,119 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 12, 2016
4.48/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Growler fresh from the Canton MA brewery to a New City Brewery 12oz glass. You can smell the fruityness of this rascal the second the bottle is opened. Yellow-orange translucent brew - just as I like it. Some brewers would call this flawed, but they more than likely don't make beer of this standard.
Juicy, medium-bodied, finely carbonated, pronounced citrus. A tad different from Trillium's standard Fort Point Pale which I think is dry-hopped with Citra. Curious to do a side by side.
Rings of lace grace the glass now, and this beer advocate is smiling. One of the best brews I've ever had. 596 charactershudsonvalleyslim, Jan 12, 2016

I don't mean to split hairs here, but the mouthfeel seemed lacking.  After spending a few months tasting other great breweries like Treehouse and Lawson's,  something tastes off. The balance seemed off a bit for the batch I tasted. Having had DDH Fort Point twice in last six months, this was slightly watered down in comparison, albeit still a delicious brew.  Just was lacking something in the mouthfeel. 471 charactersHopglow, Jan 10, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 25.4 oz bomber picked up at the new Brewery in Canton, MA. 
Pours a murky, bright golden orange color with a 1 finger fluffy white head. Leaves a good amount of cobwebs around the glass as the head dies. 
The aroma is very tropical. I get notes of mango, orange and pineapple, as well as kiwi. Not very piney, but I get a lot of bready, spicy malt on the back end to provide balance. I would die smelling this beer if I could. 
The taste follows the nose, but while the tropical characters shine through, there's plenty of doughy malt holding it all together. I get a bit more bitterness on the back end than I got from the nose. Some mild notes of grapefruit rind and even a touch of lemon balance out the sweetness from the tropical fruit flavors. 
The mouth has a very good body and moderate carbonation. Goes down smoother than butter and Billy Dee Williams. Has a dry, bitter finish but a touch of orange makes sure it's not too dry or too bitter. 
This beer is ridiculous. Possibly my favorite variant of the Fort Point series and one of my favorite beers from Trillium overall. It's juicy and hoppy like a great IPA, but extremely well balanced like an excellent pale ale. It smells like a fruit basket and goes down so smooth it's like liquid velvet. If it were possible to get an erection from a beer, I would have one right now.

Poured in a tulip, very cloudy with a big tight head that took a while to die down, but did so within a few minutes.  Smells mango, pine, a little malt.  Smooth mouthfeel with tropical fruits, some hop bite/almost peppery then some pine.
Great stuff, very drinkable.  Next up is an A/B with this vs the reg. Fort Point. 360 charactersSmokee, Jan 07, 2016

Outstanding beer enjoyed from a growler within an hour of capping. Hazy, hoppy, juicy, murky, tropical, chewy, bitter - it's all mouth watering tropical fruit and pungent flora. Like the incomparable Fort Point PA but a little thicker, foggier and meatier - you get the picture: it's a big ass pale ale. I'm a bigger fan of balance than boldness so I prefer the "standard" issue but this is an excellent beer. Unreal. 482 charactersManapuaMan, Jan 07, 2016

T: A good amount of tropical fruit again. Papaya, mango and some orange rind with a finish of pink grapefruit pith and a little bit of pine. A light and dry, slightly bitter lingering finish with a good amount of citrus rind to it. Another very nice offering from Trillium. 589 charactersnotchucknorris, Dec 04, 2015

Look: minimal (1/8 inch) head. Color similar to FPPA, maybe darker; burnt orange.
Smell: Lost of tropical hop aromas but stronger grapefruit notes. Less orange than FPPA.
Taste: Smooth. No citrus burn as in FPPA but continues with those grapefruit flavors. 
Feel: Again smooth but slightly dry finish. Almost watery compared to FPPA which coated a bit more.
Overall: Yes another fantastic fruity IPA. This improves on weaknesses of FPPA but presents its own. 522 charactersdhitchcox, Sep 13, 2015

Pours a very hazy deep golden body with a fluffy white head that reduces fairly slowly to leave some blotchy lacing and a nice layer of retention. 
On the nose is huge citrus and tropical fruit aroma, pineapple and passionfruit, fresh hop acids, orange peel. Smells like this is going to be a delicious beer. 
The aromas did not lie! On the tongue is a bursting medly of tropical fruit and citrus, pineapple, tropical punch, orange creamsicle, finished by a zing of fresh hoppy bitterness that lingers on the tongue for a minute. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is medium. Pretty easy to drink. 
Overall nothing less than a masterpiece - the dry hopping really upped the aromas and enjoyability of Fort Point Pale Ale. 820 charactersgcamparone, Sep 07, 2015

I was really expecting a great deal more, especially with Galaxy being one of my favorites. The beer really wasn't strong with the nose which was an issue and the flavor was fruit juice with some good added. Good, but way over-hyped. 248 characterstylerstravis, Aug 03, 2015

The beer is cloudy and orange-ish yellow. The head is big and white. Tons of lacing and excellent retention. The aroma is full of delicious fruit. Big peach, pineapple, tangerine, grape, mango, guava, lime. Light pale malt character. The taste is chock full of hop flavor. Dry, yeasty finish. Moderate to medium bitterness in the finish. Big, fresh tropical fruit hop character. Gentle full mouthfeel. It’s fresh and soft and full of flavor. Absolutely wonderful stuff. 582 characterspopery, Aug 03, 2015

A- 750ml into three snifters with a milky and super hazy yellow orange body. Thick, tall and creamy head with good retention. Large quantities of lace.
S- Dank weed like herbal hops and massive fruits but less juicy sweet nectar and more bright zesty freshness. Some juicy stone fruits, mango, mint, melon, citrus and floral hops. Not much interrupting those hops.
T- Galaxy added to a classic Pale Ale base. Zesty and fresh mangoes, passionfruit, apricot, clementine, tangerine, weed, mint, melon, grapefruit and flowers. A tiny hint of light cereal grains, bread and yeast.
MF- Creamy and smooth medium overall body with some chewy feeling. High end carbonation and a clean bitter finish.
Distinctly different from the original and the Double Dry Hopped with a very dank herbal and different set of fruity tones really shining. Trillium contending for my favorite brewery of 2015 so far. 969 characterscbutova, Jul 20, 2015

Smell:  Tropical fruit and citrus notes waft above a hint of cracker malt
Taste:  Papaya juice (like at Papaya King in NYC), up front, with the cracker malt and the grapefruit citrus flavors building; bright and bitter, through the middle, with the juicy flavors lingering
Mouthfeel:  Medium body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  Every time I go up to Boston I try to stop by Fort Point; of all the places I travel, this is the easiest pick up for me - they are easy to get to and always have something great in the bottle; this beer is a real treat 690 charactersbrentk56, Jul 16, 2015

4.45/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a completely unfiltered, vibrant, peach pulp color, with a very stable, froth head.
Exhibits an intense nose of watermelon stones and wet grass, together with orange peel and a whiff of ice-bonbons. The aromas come outstandingly well together, extremely dank, with just the right amount of fruits to create a fantastic, intriguing hop character. Crisp, juicy citrus joins in, as the beer warms up, lending the hops even more profile.
Has a medium carbonation, revealing an awesome hop profile, while letting the beer stay extremely refreshing. For its 6.6 abv it packs a great flavor diversity, leaving the palate very satisfied.
The taste begins, from the very first glance, with grassy lime, silk yeast and bready, balancing malts. Lemons evolve into sweeter, ripe oranges with a distinct grassiness to them, very dough on the palate, packing enough fruits to create an enjoyable hoppy juicyness. Finishes with a great, leafy dankness, bringing up the citrus again, providing a hoppy, bitterness infused dryness, which leaves the palate at the same time as the fruits do.
Fantastic ipa, bursting with a well accentuated hop profile, leading to a focused, intense flavor impression, leaving still space for subtle details. 1,233 charactersaleigator, Jul 14, 2015

A= Bright hazy yellow with a pure white foamy head, head settles down to 1/2 inch layer and lasts.  Lacing sticks to the glass with each sip or swirl.  Haze make the beer near opaque.
S= Massive wave of tropical citrus, pineapple, mango, piney resinous aroma.  Hits you right when you open the bottle, layers of smells.
T= Super dank and full of tropical hop flavors, galaxy seems like the perfect match for this base APA.
M= Medium body and moderate carbonation, bubbles continue to rise and fortify the beautiful white head.
O= So fragrant and full of tropical fruit hop flavors, absolutely nothing to complain about.  World-class, worth seeking out, perfect for anyone who likes fresh hops. 740 charactersjhavs, Jul 08, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is absolutely beautiful in the glass, akin to mango or orange juice. Pure uncut and unfiltered -- it's so thick it glugs out of the bottle like a smoothie.
The nose is tops, too. Fruity citrus sits atop a fresh, lush vegetal smell lie a forest after a rain or sticky bud. You would be forgiven for mistaking this for a DIPA.
Having had the regular, the dry hopping really adds another level of complexity and sophistication on the palate. Thick, oily orange and pineapple notes give way to a lingering spicy bitterness that cleans up the messiness. The flavor is much more along the lines of DIPA than your typical retiring pale ale.
Trillium's hoppy beers are among the best. Seek this out. 699 charactersjjdc, Jun 15, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +9.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Trillium Brewing - Galaxy dry hopped Fort Point Pale Ale. (6.6%) rated 100/100 on Beer Advocate. Brewed and bottled in Boston, MA. Bottled 5/20/15
The first of the threeTrillium beers I am reviewing is Fort Point with galaxy hops and dry hopped. Their are a couple more variants of Fort Point. One being Double Dry Hopped Fort Point, and Mosaic dry hopped Fort Point. I really like single hopped pale ales/IPAs because I can get used to flavor profiles and aromatic profiles of one hop. It's a good way to practice the palate for more complex IPAs or pale ales. Trillium is a brewery I've been wanton to try for over a year now and they are becoming one of the best brewers of IPAs and Pale Ales on the market today. They take pride on what's surrounding them, working with other businesses, and making great beer as well. Let's dig in!
Pour: Before I even mention the pour, when I opened the bottle I got a huge whiff of flavors coming into my nose and those flavors smelt fricken amazing. The pour is a very beautiful hazed yellow, with a nice bubbly head. I can't see anything through this glass (big sucker for hazed beers) and if I had a better camera I could show you full detail on what I'm looking at. This honestly looks like someone squeezed pineapple juice, some lemon, and lime juice in a glass. Not even joking. Looks super delicious and I can smell the aromas already.
Aroma: Oh my fricken God. I tell you what, I don't know if this is a Double IPA or a Pale Ale. The aromatics of this beer is so fricken wild. Mango, grapefruit pith, pineapple up the rear of Pineapple Mountain. It smells like a fruit salad.. No joke. A little bit of dankness from the hop oils, some orange, papaya, tropical fruit punch. This is one of the best Pale Ale beers I have smelt so far. Better than Pseudo Sue and Zombie Dust by a long shot. This is amazing !
Taste: Is this even beer? Are you kidding me right now Trillium? In he words of Chris Farley, "Holy schnikeys!"  This beer is phenomenal. Pineapple juice, mango , grapefruit, a little bit of a wheat malt character, a bread quality that makes this beer so full of a hearty mouthfeel. It's literally a tropical cocktail with hops. Alcohol isn't present at all. This is what pale ales should be and strive to be. Seriously this is the best Pale Ale I have had yet. Awesome job Trillium. 
Verdict: 100/100 for style . 99/100 over all. This is one of my favorite beers of this year. Please if you can, seek out this brewery guys. I can't stress it enough how fun it is to try world class beers and getting to know breweries almost on a personal level just by having there product. The amount of passion these guys have is unreal and it shows in there product. Cheers! 2,721 characterskeags_beer, May 30, 2015

Beautiful beer with a massive head, tropical, pungent fruit in the nose and taste, super smooth with incredible body and somewhat dry, piney finish. This is just hop juice. There's no alcohol in it, right?! Reminds of Hill Farmstead flavor and feel. I've been waiting over six months to drink something from Trillium and this doesn't disappoint as the first! One of the top IPA brewers in the country so it's nice to have them nearby. Thanks for picking this up for me judkinst! 486 charactersGatch, May 13, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Easily the juiciest pale ale I've ever had. The hops are incredibly bright and delicious without the bitterness an IPA brings. Although there are no real flaws here, I would have preferred a bit more bitterness, but that's just me. Still a truly unique and outstanding brew that is fully deserving of a perfect score.

Pours an seductive and hazy golden straw color with a thick and creamy frothy head (dang it, I used the word frothy). The aroma is my favorite of any pale I've had . . . Big, huge citrus, tropical mango, lemon and oranges. Taste is similar but I digress. Thought maybe the Trillium hype was over hyped . . . Nope ! Delicious beer, appearance, aroma, taste and feel are all firing. 432 charactersGOBLIN, Apr 19, 2015

A: Slightly dull orange, cloudy. Two fingers of head. Laced the glass very nicely throughout the session.
S: Mango, citrus, sweet malts in the background
T: Mango, citrus and pineapple. Malty crackers in the background. Nice dry finish.
M: Medium mouth, medium carbonation. Slight bite and dry finish.
O: Very tasty pale. Blurs the line between IPAs and pales in that its very hoppy yet not very bitter. Fantastic beer and would definitely love to have again. 552 characterschrisjws, Apr 10, 2015

Appearance - Hazy orange body.  Small white head and a thin collar.
Smell - Orange and tropical fruit.  A hint of toasty malts and what smells like rye?
Taste - More orange and grapefruit than tropical fruit.  Exceptionally hoppy.  Almost a bitter orange flavor.  Light cracker malt.  Low bitterness, but there's not much sweetness, so it stands out.
Mouthfeel - Medium light body.  Well carbonated.
Overall - I felt that regular Fort Point smelled better than it tasted, but this seems to be the opposite.  Huge citrus hop flavor. 573 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 07, 2015

S- Galaxy hops up the wazoo- tropical fruit, citrus- in addition to the base beer's hops. Smells incredibly fruity and resinous. Very nice stuff. A bit of caramel, crackers.
F- Not quite as good as it smells, quite bitter actually. Mild resin, hefty bitterness, citrus, tropical fruit, a bit of mango. A bit of spice. Very tasty beer.
M- Medium bodied, soft, plenty of carbonation, super easy to drink. Moderately bitter citrus on the finish.
O- Excellent APA. I find that I prefer regular Fort Point more, though- the Galaxy dry hopping seems to cover up some of the nuances and complexity of the base beer. But it's definitely more intense, which is what they were probably going for. 770 charactersStevedore, Apr 06, 2015

S: I have a cold right now, so again, not my strong suit. Citrus and tropical fruit. A bit of alcohol which is surprising for a beer with this low ABV. A bit of grass.
T: Vibrant super ripe clementine orange, pineapple, papaya, juicy mango sweetness. A bit of grassy bite that lingers. Super juicy.
M: Mouthfeel is incredible. So juicy. Thick for an IPA, very full bodied. No pulp orange juice. 498 charactersSpinaltapped, Mar 27, 2015

Pours a murky, orangish-yellow color with one finger of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Lots of tropical fruits, citrus hops, oranges, pine hops, floral notes, fruity malts, and grapefruit. Medium body and low carbonation. Tiniest bitter bite but not much at all.
Overall I liked this one a lot; an improvement on an already very good beer. The nose is awesome and it is easy to drink. Highly recommended. 514 charactersmdfb79, Mar 26, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company in Boston, MA.
This one pours a hazy golden orange, with a tight, fuzzy and foamy one inch head, and tons of lacing.
Smells so awesome, just pure essence of Galaxy hops. Smells like Goya nectar, honestly, so citrusy and fruity, tons of orange, apricot, and passionfruit. Awesome.
This tastes really really great too. It tastes so soft, like drinking a juicy cloud of hops. So fruity and so delicious, tons of apricot, orange, some fuzzy peach, and honestly almost a vanilla smoothie flavor too. Not a whole lot of malt flavor here, but it's ok. 
This one has a really light, fluffy, cloud-like body, with a moderate level of carbonation, and an insane amount of drinkability.
Drinking this is like being on Cloud 9. 765 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 25, 2015

A - Really nice, opaque yellow-orange sun gold body.  Pillowy bone white head pours 3 fingers high with amazing lace.  
S - Fantastic.  Perfectly balanced.  Soft sweet orange nectar, mango puree, touch of pine, and lemon zest with beautiful overtones of fresh herbs and honeysuckle .  
T - Bright bitter cilantro, pine, and fresh cut plant stems up front.  A soft bready center balances out the bitter greens, before gently giving way to a dry minerally finish.  
M - Great feel.  Soft, creamy and smooth with medium body that's just light enough to keep it to style. 
O - A absolutely great APA with a world class nose and feel. 701 charactersvfgccp, Mar 24, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.   It is a hazy golden yellow with some vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Tropical, citrus, lemon, herbal, grassy, and floral hops followed by toasted, biscuit, and pale malts.
Taste:  Nice hop flavor with a balanced malt backbone.  Fruity and chewy with light bitterness in the rear.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, crisp, refreshing, medium carbonation, medium bodied, a little chewy, and light bitterness. 
Overall:  Tasteful and very enjoyable.  Every flavor keeps rolling through the back of the palate.   Will look for more of this in the near future. 743 charactersFlounder57, Mar 22, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from thegerm. Thanks buddy! Dated 2/12/15 and poured 3/2/15. Pours hazy to murky bright yellow golden with a big creamy head that just sticks around. Beautiful aroma with pineapple juice, mangoes, some light pine, floral aromatics, some citrus peel. Mmmmm. Big juicy body with pineapple and mango, light dry bitter pine, subtle sweetness that balances things perfectly. Medium low carbonation, light to medium bodied, starts juicy and finishes dry. Really nice stuff. My only complaint with a few Trilium brews I've had is that the carbonation is on the low side. Would really like to see these get some more bubbles. But they're good enough that they shine through that anyway. 685 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 03, 2015

It is a bright hoppy take on Fort Point with its light to medium body. The Galaxy explodes out of the glass on the aroma as well as the flavor with tons of bright tropical and some citrus. A really light malt body.
They are really pumping out some world class stuff up there with the big New England players. 348 charactersdar482, Feb 24, 2015

A- Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a two finger frothy whitish head that fades to a nice splotchy lace. Perfect hazy appearance.

T- Follows the nose with huge juicy fruit, orange, tangerine, papaya, etc. Finishes with a nice balanced bitterness.
M: Light to medium bodied with perfect carbonation and just a huge juicy, creamy character that makes this crushable. Finishes dry with a light bitterness.
O: Absolutely phenomenal, and I'd say it's the best APA I've ever had. The galaxy takes the base beer to a new level, and the juicy drinkability of this is just insane. Could we please get this in cans Trillium? 779 charactersMikecap, Feb 15, 2015

A-  Pours a very hazy yellowish orange, white frothy head that dissipates at a moderate pace.  One of the hazier APAs I've had, almost looks like orange juice.
S-  Very green hops, citrus, mandarin, lemon, papaya, some vinous characteristics.  Pretty aromatic with nice fresh hop complexity.
T-  Oranges, lemons, papaya, mandarins, very juicy with a nice balanced bitterness.  One of the most balanced APAs I've had.
M-  Super drinkable, light bitterness, slightly dry on the finish.
O-  This is easily one of the best APAs I've had and I love how JC and the Trillium crew go all out to release bottles the same day they are bottled so you can't try it any fresher.  My only complaint about this beer is that it is not bottled in six packs. 807 charactersjaasen64, Feb 14, 2015

4.06/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Notes taken from the end of Oct 2014, this batch was released Oct 23rd 2014. Purchased bottle at the brewery. 
1st bottle poured nearly opaque golden straw though the 2nd bottle which sat in the beer fridge for a couple of weeks cleared up a lot ... was very careful not to pour the sediment into the glass, noticed before I poured the beer there was still some particulate that was held in suspension. With that said I would highly suggest letting your bottles sit in the fridge for a week or so to help this beer clear up ... unless of course you are worried about the hops dropping off which they did not in my instance. I'll judge this beer off the second bottle for at least the appearance. Lacing was amazing, left rings all the way down. 
Smells of orange zest, guava, ripe mango skin, & lime pith ... faint hint of bready malt / yeast in the nose as well. 
Creamy, a bit of body with a moderate yet very pleasing level of carbonation. Juicy hop flavor throughout that mimics the nose. Somewhat aggressive hop bitterness is blanketed by the Galaxy dryhopping. Very well put together as far as the hopping goes, much preferred the 2nd bottle that was cold conditioned for a week rather than the 1st bottle that was freshly packaged. 1,241 charactersJason, Feb 05, 2015

Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for sharing this beer
A: Hazy, medium gold with some orange highlights - pours with a frothy, bright white head, maintains an almost solid head with a big collar, leaves some very nice streaks of lacing
S: Stupid amounts of hop aroma, no surprise there - potent, like a fresh bag of hop pellets - bright orange and grapefruit flesh - floral citrus - fresh pine, mint, and some dank notes - tropical notes as well with some pineapple and mango - very aromatic, but not harsh or aggressive - pale malts, light grains, and some light bread - very clean
T: Hoppy, juicy, and easy-drinking - orange and grapefruit flesh, very floral - pine, mint, straight-up hop resin - hints of pineapple, mango, peach, apricot - like the aroma, very hoppy but not actually aggressive - medium level of bitterness - pale malts, bread, clean finish 
M: Medium body, nice carbonation, very smooth, easy drinking
O: How do you make a world-class beer better? More hops!
Fort Point Pale Ale is one of, if not my favorite APA ever. And this somehow improves on a masterful thing... At least slightly. Bravo. 1,172 charactersangrybabboon, Jan 25, 2015

Appearance: Hazy straw yellow. Head is fluffy, clumpy, bright-white. Drops to a soapy thin collar. Sheets of sticky lacing,. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Carries the typical mild stone fruit expected from Fort Point. Galaxy adds a big resinous pine needle and lingering bitterness. Some peach skin. Pale malts. Slightly bready with some undercooked dough. Slightly dank with some mango and passion fruit layered in the back. Some woody elements and a touch of mint leaf. Small hint of alcohol on the back with some seriously floral hops. 
Taste: Peach pits, flesh and skin. A decent amount of passion fruit with a touch of mango as well. Super light malt base. Pale malt sweetness with a solid biscuity undertone. Typical lingering bitterness of all Trillium pale ales. Deep floral hops. Some pine needle and oily resin. Pithy. Hints of mint leaf. 
Mouthfeel: Medium leaning to light body. Moderate carbonation. Slightly creamy initial sip with a mostly clean finish. 
Overall: Blast off, blast off to nowhere.
The Galaxy adds a little something to it, but for all intents and purposes it's Fort Point. 1,189 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 18, 2015

Super fresh beauty, opened this one right after the regular Fort Point to compare because a good guy in the Boston area really hooked me up!  
Much murkier yellow haze forms on the pour, aroma is really awesome, just like you remember your best Galaxy hopped brews being. Tons of tropical fruits and floral flavors.  Taste is world class, mild malts, with a light pine feel on the way down.  Finish on this is a little more hop-forward and not quite as smooth but still really great.  Lucky to try this brew - definitely seek this brew out.  Trillium is doing some great things right now1 625 charactersM_chav, Jan 12, 2015

The taste of the beer is also packed with those same types of Fruity Hop flavors with a subtle tangy bitterness in the finish. Overall this is a really good Pale Ale.

Location: Trillium Brewing Company
Draught/Bottle: 750 ml Brown Bottle
Glassware: Snifter
Appearance:Orange/grapefruit in color. Strong haze prevents you from seeing through the beer but lets in some light. Ivory colored head. This beer has the best head retention I've seen on a beer in a long time. Excellent cling as well. 
Aroma: We can start with the dry hopped galaxy that gives the beer a very earthy to grassy aroma. From there we get kiwi, and other citrus fruits- pineapple, mango, tangerine. There is a moderate hot bitterness, some pine, as well. Bread crusts and biscuits are given off by the malts. 
Taste: Almost like a hopped juice smoothie there is so much fresh juice flavors in this one. Kiwi, mango, tangerine, pineapple zests and grape juice. Pine and grass help to combat the juice sweetness. There is almost a semolina/biscuits/flour taste to the malts. 
Mouthfeel: Medium full in body this beer seems to be even heavier with all the flavors that list on the tongue. Low moderate hop bitterness provides a slight drying that lasts into the finish but is combated by the juice flavors. Medium carbonation. 
Notes: Orange stickered bottle date (10/23/14) 1,192 charactersKornWallace, Nov 13, 2014

A: Pours an extremely cloudy pale orange. Very tall and very frothy light tan head. Gradually fades out very slowly with great retention. Spiderweb lacing. 
S: Whoa. Candied apricot and oranges primarily. Heavenly aroma. Smells absolutely amazing. Get some sweet melons in there too. A spicy, piney and even garlicky background to it all. I swear I even get fresh-cut grass. Aroma is sharp, pungent, fresh, complex and absolutely enticing. I first thought this was Citra but apparently Galaxy must be pretty close. 
T: More of the same. Up front it's sort of a grassy, piney hop character but then the tropical fruit kicks in. Apricot and tangerine. Garlicky and quite spicy in the middle. Garlic bread finish in fact. Spicy, herbal, grassy and very dry in the finish. Lots of lingering grass and garlic between sips.
M: Medium bodied, quite dry. Long-lasting hop residue between sips.
O: Regular Fort Point is excellent but this one has a leg up. Huge variety of hop flavors without becoming teeth-chatteringly bitter. Tough balance to strike and few APAs pull it off. Despite the complexity, the balance is great. Drinkability is surprisingly good despite the variety and strength of flavors. Dryness helps keep it crisp and refreshing without being so tiring to drink like some of the big IPAs. Really great beer, better than even MBC APAs. On par with Zombie Dust as far as I'm concerned. Perhaps even supercedes it. Fantastic. 1,483 charactersDope, Nov 03, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%Notes from 10/29/14
A - 2 fingers of dense rolling white head.  Unfiltered pulpy orange body, like the color of grapefruit rinds.  Excellent lacing.
S - A whole lot of tropical fruit and candied citrus with some underlying acidity.  Super intense and super sweet.
T - Tons of grapefruit and candied citrus shifts to tropical fruit juice blend (papaya, mango, and pineapple).  Tropical fruits linger in the finish along with more pronounced citrus notes.
M - Medium carbonation.  Almost juice like with a nice effervescent, sharply bitter finish. 
O - The smell is incredible and the flavors are way more balanced than I anticipated.  Not may favorite offering from Trillium, but another top-notch beer. 707 charactersAirBob, Nov 02, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.4%A - hazy golden ale with a nice fresh white head that laces beautifully on the glass
S - The smell is absolutely perfect.  Just absolutely perfect.  Juicy, tropical, citrusy, hop ASSAULT!!! Strong, Strong perfect on the nose. I didn't sip for 5 minutes that's how much I enjoyed the nose. 
T - Follows the nose precisely.  Perfect juicy hop, juicy hop, juicy hop, wave after wave of the same perfection. 
M - medium carbonation and again....follows everything above.  Leaded version of a beverage I'd like to have first thing in the morning if life would allow.  Juice, creamy fresh medium carbonation, smooth, sweet, light dank, perfect.
O - Blown away.  Perfect. Death bed or stuck on an abandoned island for life pick one beer kind of ale.  Top 5 without a doubt  as I may be reviewing after a 750ml bottle but it's a coin toss between this and maybe one or two other beers that I've had the pleasure to enjoy for best beer I've ever had.  Not best pale ale...best beer including the IPA, DIPA, Stout, Imperial Stout category. Hill Farmstead's Edward has been impossible to dethrone as the best Pale Ale I've had.  Edward is perfect....but a perfect #2. 1,160 charactersHopDeezy, Nov 02, 2014

Appearance: Pours a hazy medium honey/amber and leaves a couple fingers of slightly off-white head which linger for a while, leaving full lacing. (4.5)
Smell: Really big grapefruit/pineapple/floral spruce/orange/apricot notes from the hops. A hint of cereal malts in the background, but they are fairly hidden. Incredibly aromatic and a really nice blend of many flavors. Ultra pleasant. (5)
Taste: Earthy hops, citrus, pineapple, light mango, spruce, just a hint of malts and some more earthiness towards the end. Only a little bitter - really nice. Fairly juicy. (4.5)
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium, creamy body. Really nice and juicy. Finishes just a tad bitter. (4.75)
Overall: Amazing aroma and a really well-balanced array of flavors - this definitely packs a lot into each sip. Nice and drinkable, this is a really nice, hoppy beer. 931 charactersResuin, Oct 28, 2014

Served in a pint glass
Cloudy, dull straw yellow appearance. The liquid was topped by a near three-finger tall, super tight and creamy, eggshell colored crown. The head had amazing lasting strength and slowly dropped to a frothy cap. Thick patches of lacing coated the glass from top to bottom.
The aroma was absolutely amazing. It was pure tropical fruit goodness in a glass. Guava notes dominated. Loads of passionfruit. Touch of mango. Juicy Fruit gum came to mind. All in all, the nose was very similar to that of the original Fort Point Pale Ale, but even punchier and fruitier.
Like the aroma, the flavor profile was loaded with tropical fruit notes. Tons of mango, papaya and guava. Lots of peach and apricot as well. Candied orange peel was also noticeable. Amazingly juicy. A touch of bitter orange rind and lemon peel came through on the finish, lending the beer a perfect balance. With time, the peach and apricot notes became much stronger.
The mouthfeel was flawless. Ultra smooth and plush. A super fine, moderate effervescence gave the liquid a slick creaminess. Rather full bodied for the style.
I have waxed poetic about nearly every hoppy beer that Trillium Brewing has released thus far, but this beer definitely takes the prize for being their best. The amount of rich fruitiness and overall hop complexity in this pale ale is simply mesmerizing.  I look forward to seeing what amazing creations these guys are going to put out next. 1,547 charactersDamian, Aug 28, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -6.2%Bottled 08/02/14.  Tulip glass. 
A: Pours a strawish golden color with two fingers of soapy, off-white head.  An extensive lattice of lacing and superb retention.  (4.75)
S: Galaxy hops up front, with nice tropical and citrusy notes, twang of spiced honey (?), with a good amount of fresh bread and cracker malt in the background. (4.25)
T: The pale malt is in the forefront on this with kind of a toasty fresh bread character, though the Galaxy are still noticeable along with some honey, finishing mostly dry with a medium-light bitterness and a touch of sweetness. (4.25)
M: Medium-light body and soft carbonation. (4.25)
O: Tasty pale ale, fairly drinkable, with a decent but not super hoppy aroma/flavor. (4) 718 characterspmarlowe, Aug 22, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.7%About 2.5 weeks old.  750ml bottle. Lost Abbey Teku.
Pours hazy amber with big 2 finger head that leaves mild lacing. Smell is dank grass and light marijuana aromas, pine, light pineapple and mango. Taste is much of the same but focusing no on the citrus as opposed to the tropical fruits. Grapefruit, and orange are forefront. Clean mouthfeel with good carbonation and medium body.
Fort point is already a great hop forward pale. This adds on of my favorite hop varietals and brings it to the next level. Well done. 518 charactersSeanniek91, Aug 19, 2014

4.52/5  rDev -0.2%My thanks to my friend @BigStein88 for this incredible bottle.
Poured from the 25 oz bottle into a tulip.
Pours a beautiful glowing bright and glowing quality with minimal head.
Smells fucking incredible.  The biggest and most beautiful Galaxy aromas Ive ever experienced.
Tastes even better.  Juicy, big, fat, dank hop flavor with enough malt backbone to keep it together.
Mouthfeel was so incredibly drinkable.
This beer was gone way too quick.  It was fantastic!  Glorious! 476 charactersBoldRulerVT, Aug 17, 2014
4.82/5  rDev +6.4%Poured from 25 oz bottle into tulip glass
A - A hazy beechwood color with a thick and frothy white head.
S - Amazing. Key lime, orange zest, mango, and wildflower elegantly waft up from the glass.
T - An improvement on the already knockout smell. Tangerine, lime, passion fruit, and mango hop flavors immediately send the tongue into hop nirvana. A wildflower honey malt is fantastic at letting the hops do their thing. The finish is pleasantly bitter and dry. The lime then lingers on the tongue, temping you to another sip.
M - Light and bubbly, but smooth and silky at the same time.
O - This beer blew me away. Easily rivals many of the more famous Vermont pale ales and IPAs 684 charactersporter_collie, Aug 15, 2014

S-Well, Fort Point is one of my favorite beers so of course the aroma is excellent. The Galaxy dry hop adds even more of a zesty, hoppy fragrance. Distinct passion fruit aroma. A blended medley of enticing fruits. Excellent nose. An easy 5 here.
T-The hops are incredibly pronounced. Such an assortment of fruits. Passion fruit, pineapple and mango. The Galaxy adds a very unique, almost mossy hop finish. Light, sweet pastry maltiness. Hops are superb.
M-Medium bodied. Aftertaste lingers a while. Playfully bitter. Softer carbonation. Light resins.
O-Another great take on a brilliant base beer. The Galaxy hops add some extra zing. Nothing to complain about here, only compliments. Fort Point strikes again. 812 charactersVelvetExtract, Aug 09, 2014

A - Poured a very nice lightly hazy straw orange hue with a one finger head that leaves very creamy lacing and a dense creamy blanket. As it is drank it leaves a thick creamy lacing all down the glass. Wonderful.
S - Aromas of very nice fresh galaxy hoops, wonderful tropical notes, light pineapple, study mango and grapefruit. Nice pine, well done.
T - Taste has taken an already delicious fort point pale and improved it immensely with the addition of galaxy. Wonderful tropical notes, pineapple and pine with wonderful grapefruit. The finish is not overly bitter and is super drinkable. Just well rounded flavours here.
M - Mouthfeel is crisp, slightly sharp. Alcohol hidden nicely, super drinkable.
O - Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Very well done and the addition of the galaxy hops really made this beer pop. Would have again in a heart beat. 923 charactersrudzud, Dec 19, 2013

With that said I put this pale ale on par with - yes I am going to say it - Anber. It has a super hoppy appeal to it in a tropical sense. Big fresh mango, pineapple, citrus bursts, it has a creamy-like mouth feel the way a heady topper and and an Abner do. And like those two monsters this is quaffable as hell. So drinkable that it is scary. In fact, when this nectar of love hits my lips, it tastes like the first time I ever opened a heady back a few years ago: love. Now say what you will but if you are anywhere near Boston right now get to Trillium and try this. NOW. Edit: I know Abner is a DIPA. That's just how I feel about the beer. 745 charactersPatrickbrusil, Dec 10, 2013

The original Fort Point Pale brewed with Columbus and Citra is already gushing with hop aroma and flavor, but the galaxy dry hop really knocks it out of the park. I honestly don't see how this beer could possibly be improved other than perhaps experimenting with different dry hops - a truly perfect offering. 359 charactersHeady978, Dec 08, 2013
4.35/5  rDev -4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a fairly vigorous head that fluffy and bubbly. The head does not dissipate quickly and leaves a bit of lacing along the glass. The beer is a hazy pale orange with yellow that is hard to see through.
The beer smell contains a strong notes of the Galaxy hops with citrus notes and bits of passion fruit and orange smell.
The beer taste is similar to the smell with the Galaxy Hops making a strong appearance with its citrus and passion fruit taste as well as orange flavor. However, the malts do make a bready appearance in the aftertaste with the citrus and underneath the stronger hop notes.
The beer has biting carbonation and a medium body that falls in middle between light and heavy. The feel is smooth and clean with a slightly sticky and dry aftertaste.
Overall, a pretty good variation on the Fort Point Ale even though the galaxy hops are pretty strong. 880 charactersHattedClassic, Dec 07, 2013
