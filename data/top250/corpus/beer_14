S: Aromas of peach , mango, passionfruit, pineapple and that familiar Tree House yeast with some biscuits. 
T: Layers upon layers of fruit, pineapple and grapefruit, passionfruit, guava, peach,Galaxy , grapefruit rinds, orange rinds and smoothly blended together.  Sweet roasted sugars along with the doughy malt base.  None of the overly sweet Crystal malt flavors you get from many IIPAs out there.  
M: Thick body with a moderate level of carbonation. 
O: Very very good.  The base is a notched up Green and has visible carbonation still coming up through the hazy pour.  The aromas of peach are great, and the base flavors are somewhat unbelievablly smooth for a IIPA. 820 charactersalpinebryant, Apr 03, 2017

Canned 3/17/17 (Happy St. Patrick's Day!).
Reviewed 3/31/17.
Poured into Tree House tulip glass.
A: A very turbid, light golden orange. A finger of head - rocky white bubbles for the most part.
S: Pungent pungent pungent pineapple, mango, orange rind. All tropical fruit, all day long. The dank character is indicative on the nose, as well as a slightly bready malt.
T: Taste follows the nose, very strong pineapple. It's very smooth. Rounded bitterness hits first and quickly fades into a strong pineapple flavor, mango, peach, orange rind. Taste lingers.
F: The mouth feel of this beer is what beers hope to be like when they are grown up. Full mouth feel. Carbonation is dialed in and makes the flavors and aromas really pop.
O: This is a fantastic beer and I am glad I traded for it. It is a world class IPA, no doubt. I will say, though, it is not some unbelievable version of its single IPA origins. It is an elevated version of Green. It's an epic beer in its own right, but that spot on the charts is because it is Green, not its own beer. 1,071 charactersSpoild, Apr 01, 2017

Look- A murky off orange with about a finger of thick white head. Definitely the TH look I expected. 
Smell- Wow. A juicy explosion of fruits. Grapefruit, orange, pineapple and a hint of mango. Enough malt to remind you it's a beer. 
Taste- Tropical flavors with a slightly more powerful orange and tangerine taste. The malted flavor mixes with the fruit to give a nice bitterness that is so drinkable. 
Feel- Very smooth with a slightly dry finish. 
Overall- A world class DIPA from TH. A hoppy fruit explosion with a nice kick. Definitely a go to beer. 615 charactersKdouble, Mar 24, 2017
4.16/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Canned 03/17/17, so just under one week.
A: Pours hazy light orange with a finger of dense off white head and streaks of lacing.  Average retention.
S: Bright mango, papaya, orange sherbet, and tangerine, rounded out by sharp lemon.  Kind of a raw/green character, but still very nice.
T: Mild orange and tropical fruit (mango) that’s cut short fairly quickly with a mildly off-putting bitterness and yeasty mouthcoating quality.  Meh… could use a bit of sweetness to accentuate the fruit.
M: Very creamy with full body and medium carbonation.  
O: The nose is a really nice expression of tropical hops, but the taste is not as flavorful as you’d expect.  Not really an improvement on regular Green. 710 characterspmarlowe, Mar 24, 2017

4.42/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5So, I did a side by side comparison of Green and Very Green.  I expected a typically IPA versus the DIPA version, and man was I wrong.  I first noticed they were almost the same in ABV, Very Green being a hair higher.  So, that noted, I expected a HOP monster of Very Green.  Very Green looked very similar in color to Green, but Green had a piney hop bite, whereas Very Green was smooth!  The hop was still there, but it was never bitter.  Just super smooth and crisp!  What a pleasant surprise and a great take on a DIPA! 523 characterssteve8robin, Mar 18, 2017

T: Orange, tangerine, tropical, minorly dank, grassy flavor. Very pleasing!
F: nice smooth mouthfeel.
O: Yet again, another world class offering from Tree House. This hoppy orange juice goes down so easy. Would be definitely happy to have more of this! 442 charactersraspy22, Jan 22, 2017

4.28/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Can from the brewery.
Classic NE/MidA IPA haze, nice white head/lacing. Of course, a burst of fresh hops in the nose, citrus and fresh-cut grass. Some biscuity malts in there, but obviously this is a hop showcase, and really a DIPA "done right," without the lingering sweetness of many DIPA malt-bombs, and also very light as far as booziness goes, with a crisp, clean mouthfeel. Actually, this is almost indistinguishable from regular Green... Now I didn't have them side by side, and am just going from memory here, but what I mean is, that extra 1% ABV is basically irrelevant as far as drinkability goes. There is a little more body to this, which I like, and therefore I'd say I prefer this to Green. 706 charactersRifugium, Jan 18, 2017

Hazy as hell and it was this color that I can only describe as "What Tree House Beers Look Like".
The smell was what I want to call "refined dankness". Compared to green it was a little less boggy, piney dank ness and a little more grassy and light.
The taste was almost sweet, and the hop flavor was absolutely out of this world. Maybe the best hop flavor I've ever had in a beer.
Mouthfeel was what you'd expect. Soft, supple, and dare I say, seductive.
Nothing beats Tree House. 578 charactersaac5269, Jan 15, 2017

3.95/5  rDev -15.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4Opaque pineapple juice with a large, dense, off-white foamy head settling to a souffle appearance.
Smell is sticky yet refreshingly popping dankness with stinging pine, an almost Trillium-esque pungency of yeast nearing white wine vinegar, yet accompanied by a smoothing, softening pineapple orange creme, accented with white pepper.
Taste is pineapple and wheat big time, but then super tangy, almost tartly acidic grapefruit rind pounds the shit out of the palate. A really potent yeast stings on the way down, almost like fresh mango puree. There are also swigs of straight lemon and lime juice, yet it's also extremely bitter, but not like a West coast IPA--this is its own level of bitter. This is more like taking a blender to a huge batch of hops and liquefying it instead of boiling it. Holy shit. It might actually be too much for me. It feels like one hell of a hardcore, potent ass home remedy--if I had some inflammation right now, this would be hitting the spot. 
Feel is very tangy, nearing acidic, like an astringent, raw tropical fruit juice extract with a semi-dry finish.
This is a hell of an IPA, and I like it a lot, most especially on the nose, but it's more accurate to say this is a style of its own. For me to call a hoppy, fruity IPA a sipper is a very rare thing indeed, but that's definitely what I'd call this. 1,342 charactersSabtos, Jan 13, 2017

4.62/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75From a can dated 12-30-16. The usual Tree House IPA/DIPA opaque fruit juice color with ample carbonation. I see it and I start to slobber, knowing something tasty is coming. Nose isn't explosive right out of the can as a a few of the other premier TH offerings, but plenty of pineapple and other tropical fruit as it warms and when it delivers, the slobbering starts again. Taste - a little of everything - pine, citrus, tropical and a hint of dank - and yet it works perfectly. Mouth feel?  In my opinion, the one thing that TH still does better than anyone -- and this is no exception.
Overall, maybe I am like Pavlov's dog - open a Tree House beer and automatically start typing love. Had huge expectations when lunchboxhead told me this one was in the mail -- and as is almost always the case with this brewery, the expectations were met or exceeded. So until these guys let me down, keep the bell ringing!
Here's to hoping that the commitment to quality remains at their new facility. 991 characters11-52_4hops, Jan 11, 2017

Massive hop nose of pineapple juice, dank resin, rind and pith, and some lemon zest. Very hazy appearance but not completely lost and there certainly were not chucks floating around. Super juicy, very grassy, pulling bitterness, and a pungent character that does not fade is pretty much what this beer is about. All hops on deck, this is a battle on my palate. Some warmth from the alcohol kicks in, smooth with a faintness of a malt backbone. Didn't expect much balance here to begin with, seems each sip gets better and better. Aside from the appearance which is part of the shtick here this is a really fun brew to drink. 664 charactersJason, Jan 10, 2017

A turbid golden-yellow color with a foamy bright white head that very slowly settled, leaving thick laces. Complex nose with bright pineapple, dank resin, pine, orange, and white bread. I taste the dank resin up front, followed by the earthy notes and finally the juicy citrus on the back palate. Pineapple and orange on the finish, with a ringing bitterness. Moderately carbed with a creamy mouthfeel as billed. World-class. 451 charactersBuck89, Jan 10, 2017

Very few beers are truly opaque; this is one of them.  Head formation and retention are both strong, with a nearly snow-white appearance atop a cloudy peach body.
On the nose, this is full of peppery Australian hops. Much like her little sister, Very Green is flush with tropical, dank, peppery, and piney notes.
Flavor follows, with huge hoppy flavors of mint and parsley, orange pulp, kumquats, and starfruit. Really a unique profile - unless you've had Green, of course. All of this is atop a somehow noticeable pale malt backbone, slightly sweet and reminiscent of pale crackers.
Super drinkable: smooth and creamy, not quite Vermont level, but lovely. There's a bit of alcohol flush to it, but no notice of the 8.6% ABV on the palate. 826 charactersRoguer, Jan 08, 2017

This nose is just as outrageously enticing as every other Tree House beer. Aromas of grass, mango, citrus, cantaloupe and starfruit. Sweet and exceedingly aromatic and juicy. Beer opens mango and papaya with a dank citrus hop presence. Again, near no hop bitterness to be found. More citrus with a dry grassy note towards the end. A bit of bark mixes with a tropical fruit bouquet at the finish. Outstanding! Body is medium with moderate carbonation. Super drinkable and drier than their other offerings going down. 
Excellent as always and certainly worth seeking out. 643 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 02, 2017

The aroma a bit restrained and the flavor disjointed some pineapple and slightly sour citrus (bitter orange?) up front, then a micro-burst of bitter, but this finishing flat wet barley + carboard note that disrupted any reveries. Far from my favorite treehouse. Lacking brightness and definition which is often the flaw of these beers that go for too much haze and fruit. Their center of gravity is sensitive to small fluctuations in balance. 
Or perhaps it's just that in the cold war of hops, the competition catches up quickly. You may be able to defend your boundaries on sours and stouts, beers that take years to make as well as large investment in wood+infrastructure where iteration to improve and incorporate trend are more difficult. But hops? Mimicry and learning is easy. 837 charactersKurmaraja, Dec 13, 2016

Still the appearance and aroma were on point, hazy golden/orange beautiful with great head retention and lacing, followed up with a big juicy aroma of overripe peach, mango, guava, and pineapple. Some passion fruit as well.
The flavor opens up pretty juicy, but the age can be detected as there's some grassy, yeasty, slightly cardboard like notes that follow. It's still good, but you can tell it's a shadow of its former self. Some banana and clove from the yeast.
The same goes for the mouth feel, medium, somewhat chunky with yeast and hop particles.
I'm rating it this high because I can tell it was amazing at one point, and almost certainly worthy of a higher rating I'm giving it. That said it definitely doesn't age gracefully. It was still very good, but very rough around the edges now. 851 charactersSadMachine, Dec 08, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My 100th rated beer on BA!  Pours super a super hazy yellow orange color. Notes of candied pear, apples, and a very slight piney citrus undertone.  The taste is surprisingly dry and not all that juicy especially when compared to regular green. Most of the flavor comes on the back end with a very bitter piney bite. Leaves a classic IPA bitter resiny aftertaste. The feel is a tad light though there is still a touch of that shaky quality from the particulates in the beer (though not as much as the other beers). Overall I think this is a very good beer but is too bitter for my own taste as the reason I enjoy me IPAs is because they not all that bitter. I can see how a true hop head would go crazy for this as it has juicy elements but still has that bitter resiny back end of the vast majority of IPAs. 807 charactersAmguerra305, Dec 02, 2016

L:  Almost opaque with its haziness, but has a beautiful yellow-orange glow.
S:  Fantastic aroma, but not nearly and pungent as expected.  Smells of citrus, melon, and mango.
T:  Heaven in a glass.  Soft, sweet, and just the faintest touch of bitterness to balance it out.  Strong flavors of mango, and sweet citrus.  No tang to speak of really.
F:  Incredibly soft on the palate.  Medium to slightly heavy body.  The carbonation is perfect... like angels dancing on your tongue.
O:  Quite possibly the best IPA I've ever had.  Nothing to improve as far as I'm concerned.  I'll be traveling to get this again. 681 characterszizouandyuki, Nov 30, 2016

Beautiful orange, very opaque appearance with silky, feather-like lacy foam.  Citrus fruit, tropical notes of mango, pineapple, guava… it's all there beating up the nose.  The taste just follows that smell with Citra + Mosaic hops shining through.  Not sure anyone has made this combo better.  It's like regular Green on steroids.  Mouthfeel is ridiculously full, creamy and full of flavor.  This DIPA aftertaste lingers with each sip,… something you expect from stouts really, yet super easy to drink.  Could down 6 of these without realizing it.
An amazing DIPA.  It deserves all the hype that it's getting.  Why can't everyone, including Tree House, just brew this ALL THE TIME?  Get it, trade for it, whatever you need to do if you're a DIPA fan. 829 characterseifster82, Nov 18, 2016

Big thanks to my friend Sean for getting me a can of this.
Amazing appearance. The completely opaque, mustard-orange colored liquid was topped by an inch-tall crop of frothy, off white foam. Outstanding retention. The head slowly dropped to a thick, clingy collar. After each sip, a sheet of lacing blanketed the back portion of the glass and craggily streaks stuck along the front.
The aroma was outstanding. This was a straight-up dank, fruity hop bomb. Super fragrant and sweet. Loads of canned, stewed peaches. Huge tropical fruit notes. Mango was most apparent. Some guava and papaya were noticeable too. Big marijuana notes. Amazingly exotic and complex. Simply put, outstanding.
The flavor was just as impressive as the nose. Super fruity and dank. Incredibly tropical fruit forward. Loads and loads of juicy mango and papaya. Huge peach notes. Bit of juicy orange in the center. More peach and tropical fruit sweetness on the back end. The beer finished with big white grapefruit notes and just a bit of pithy bitterness. Amazingly well balanced.
Outstanding mouthfeel as well. The liquid was medium bodied and contained a super fine, zippy effervescence that turned frothy and fluffy on the palate. Velvety smooth and supple.
I have sampled many of Tree House's highly rated IPAs and DIPAs and, while terrific, felt they did not quite live up to the hype. Green, however, really impressed me and Very Green definitely took things to another level. This very well might be the fruitiness, juiciest and best overall double IPA I have ever come across. 1,624 charactersDamian, Nov 08, 2016

Nuanced, light bodied, moderate carbonation, slightly bitter and ohhh so juicy. Just an amazing beer.  I can only hope this one ages as beautifully as regular Green does.  Glad I was able to catch this whale...It kicked five before me the last time I was at Tree House.  Will go up again for this.

The aroma is a pineapple bomb, as expected. Just wave after wave of pineapple, some mango, followed by some tangerine and orange rind. Finishes with some pithy grapefruit and pine resin.
The taste is basically Green, with a lot more grapefruit and pithy, sticky bitterness. There's a bit of mango, and orange juice as well. Finishes extremely bitter and resinous.
The feel is medium bodied with pretty high carbonation. Creamy, but a touch sticky. Bitterness coats the mouth and refuses to go away.
Overall a very good DIPA but also a very disappointing one. This beer doesn't take Green to the next level the way VH and Doppel do to their respective beers. It's just a touch too sticky and bitter and doesn't capture the amazing creamy mouthfeel of Green. Still, I feel if I hadn't had Green so many times before, I'd be in love with this beer. It's still excellent as always with TH. 1,006 charactersScaryEd, Nov 05, 2016

A: This IIPA from the Monson, MA powerhouse pours a typical murky, full-pulp orange juice appearance. It is crowned by a two-plus finger cream-colored head that struggles to be contained in the glass and leaves sticky lacing down the sides. It has good retention and settles into a dense, rocky cap. Carbonation is solid (from what is visible). This is a quintessential New England IPA in terms of appearance.
A: Mango, papaya, passion fruit, strawberry, guava, banana, and orange all lead an extremely tropical, juicy nose. Underneath lies definite dankness, earthy herbs, and, at the risk of sounding stupid, "green" aromas. Digging way underneath reveals a doughy sweet maltiness not totally unlike Pilsner malt. 4.75/5
T: The taste hits a little different than the aroma with a little bit of graininess on the front end that is quickly swept aside by a very dank herbaceousness characteristic of Galaxy hops hitting up front. Shockingly, mint and rosemary lead off followed by a distinct spat of bubblegum. Next, those prominent tropical fruits hit with guava, papaya, and passion fruit hitting hardest, undercut by mango, candied pineapple, strawberry, and honeydew melon. Finally, grapefruit and piney, weedy resin bitter things down along with just a kiss of alcohol. Pine and bitter citrus rind is left in the aftertaste. Sweet dough ties everything together and is barely there but would be very noticeable in absence. That initial grainy note is reminiscent of some home brews, which is not a compliment and is a little off-putting, but everything else is stellar here. 4.25/5
M: Here the beer excels. It feels soft and full on the tongue, like a liquid pillow. The carbonation is unobtrusive yet omnipresent. It dries out very well for 8.3% and leaves just a little astringency behind, beside a stickiness on the lips. Brilliant. 5/5
O: Pardon me for a caveat before I say any more: this can is from 07/31/16, meaning that at the time of this review it is over two months old. New England IPAs are allegedly the most fragile of all styles (besides maybe some delicate lagers), and so this is hardly in its prime. That said, this is still drinking incredibly well and complex. I am personally a little disappointed that there is not MORE "green" in the aroma and flavor. I think I would like to see Nelson Sauvin hops join the party, as they and are some of the "dankest" hops around to my palate. That said, rating based on what the beer is, this is an awesome NEIPA. There is a ton of complexity and uniqueness to it, and the mouthfeel is simply killer. That initial awkward graininess I attribute to its age, and so I absolve it somewhat in my overall here. Pair with Opeth's "Heritage" for being not what I expected but still very good at what it is doing. 4.5/5 2,803 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 08, 2016

Pours a golden orange, hazy, milkshake like body with a good two finger head that reduces slowly to leave chunky retention and spotty lacing. Very nice looking. 
On the nose is fresh, bursting tropical fruits, pineapple, straight tropical punch here - oranges, guava juice, creamsicles. 
The tongue matches the nose but to a whole new level.. this may be the best DIPA I've ever tasted. A potent serum of tropical fruits, I don't even know where to begin.. overripe pineapple, orange cream, lime, watermelon, guava, rich hop oils, finishing with a ever so bitter bite that reminds you it's an IPA. Creamy, rich, yet drinkable mouthfeel, medium low carbonation. Zero alcohol. 
This beer pushes the limit of world class tropical IPA. It's the benchmark for the style, period. 890 charactersgcamparone, Aug 18, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Canned 7/29. Consumed 8/4.
A: Thick and turbid deep yellow/orange reminiscent of pineapple juice. Medium, soft, yellow-white head sticks around for a while, leaving thick laces of foam around the glass.
S: Insane. Possibly even more aromatic than Green. Explodes with aroma of tropical fruit--tangerine, pineapple, cantaloupe. Bit of sweet bready malt. A little bit of garlic-y herbaceousness, but the subtler notes are really overpowered by the overwhelming fruitiness.
T: First impression is recognition of the similarity to its younger sibling. It's an explosion of tropical fruit up front, but no single note really stands out from the rest--they kinda all blend together. Mid-palate, VG and Green really diverge. Instead of the delicate, perfectly balanced sweet bready malt that makes Green so special, VG features a malt backbone that is less uniquely Tree House--at least in the way it's integrated into this beer. It's definitely boozier, and it adds a sweet, almost syrupy feel to the aftertaste. The extra ~1% really comes through. All that being said, the taste is supremely world-class, with a level of tropical flavors that matches any other beer I've had.
M: Milkshake-esque. Heavy mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Only detractor is the tinge of booze on the finish, which overstays its welcome IMO and brings with it a strong drying factor that cuts through the juiciness, thereby placing this on the lower end of my Tree House DIPA rankings.
O: The worst thing about this beer is the fact that everyone--including myself in this review--compares it to Green, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best IPAs being brewed right now. The best thing about this beer is that like its younger sibling, it has almost everything going for it. Incredibly juicy nose showcases an assortment of citrus and tropical fruits. Ultra-creamy mouthfeel perfectly mellows an onslaught of tropical flavors. At this point, the worst part about reviewing Tree House beers is knowing what they're capable of. While I prefer Green over VG, this is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, one that I'd gladly choose over almost any other brew in its ABV range. 2,161 charactersavas, Aug 05, 2016

4.65/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer really backs up the hype. Classic Tree House haze. Mango, citrus, tropical aroma. Taste begins with a tropical hop punch, then changes to a little resin/pine before finishing with a slight malt smoothness. The beer feels buttery smooth. Go find it! 258 charactersGALLUDA, Aug 03, 2016

Went to TH back to back days to get this.  One of their better offerings BUT I would put VG on a level of Doppelganger but not as good as KJ or Very Hazy.
Very green is basically a Green creamsicle,  Green with slightly more flavor and more "creamy".
Would I drink this beer again?  Absolutely.  Do I think this is TH's best offering?  Not even close.  Settle for regular Green IMO. 484 charactersBEEPOP, Aug 03, 2016

5/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thick, turbid, creamy yellow-tan color with a fluffy white head. Under the right light, it glows orange. Smell jumps of mango, passion fruit, and mild pineapple. The taste is a wonderful punch of galaxy hop flavor, with a great punch of tropical fruitiness. As the beer warms, it is supported by some of the purest hoppy fruit juice flavors I have ever detected in a beer. Just pure orange and mango riding below more traditional citrusy and mildly bitter hop flavors. The feel is thick and lush; feels like it is saturated with flavors that slowly melt in your mouth. I imagine if sipping this beer through a straw, you'd have to pull harder as if drinking a milkshake. My tastes are preferential to galaxy hopped offerings, Green being one of my favorites, and this one tops them all. 786 charactersschinebd, Jul 31, 2016

Tropical fruit and piney notes... like it needed to sit and mellow a couple weeks before opening. I'll try it again if offered, but I'm not spending $4 on it unless I'm in the mood to have it sit in the fridge a couple weeks before I drink it. 323 charactersGeeL, Jul 19, 2016

This takes Green and adds the right things to push it from top five IPAs offered by Treehouse and adds just the right things to make it exceptional.  Could be the best beer I've ever had, with only Very Hazy being a real competitor.  Simply an amazing brew. 311 charactersctbeerguy86, Jun 04, 2016

Smell: a tad danker compared to Green.
Taste: similar to green with a more pungent hoppiness. Not as well balanced compared to green.
Feel: medium body, creamy, super hoppy fresh.
Overall: World class but a little bit of a let down compared to Green. IMO Green is the better beer by a little bit. Hoping this one gets tweaked a little more. 390 charactersMatthewHopHead, Feb 10, 2016

Appearance - Turbid golden hue.
Smell - Oh my dankness!!
Taste - A bit off here. Was hoping for the same notes as  Green just turned up...
Mouthfeel - Creamy, full bodied. Medium carbonation.
Overall - Currently Green is my favorite beer. Had extremely high hopes for this one. It traded an arm and a leg to obtain it. I must say it didn't live up to the hype.

Pours an extremely hazy orange color with a thick white head that dissipates some but lingers on the surface of the beer throughout drinking. Intricate lacing left on the glass as it drinks down. Smell is piney, earthy, tropical and dank. What a combination. Tastes reflect the same - pineapple, citrus, dank hops. Best way to describe the feel is creamy. Like drinking a pineapple-orange-cream smoothy dusted with light pine. Downright delicious beer, high marks on this one 481 characterscostanzo_mike, Jan 29, 2016

Dank forest with a few pine trees and all kinds of tropical fruit trees within. Taste is hitting me with honey dew and mango. A bit of earthiness to wrap it together. Feel is velvet dollar bills. Smooth, some wet hop oil, and yet a bitter dry. Another stellar offering from TH. 501 charactersHootie159, Jan 29, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Beautiful looking beer. Cloudy light orange-yellowish hue.
Smells like a double Green. Bright and potent hop-infused goodness.
Honestly a little disappointed by the flavor here. I LOVE Green because of how in your face it is with its bold flavors, but I feel this one traded some of its juiciness for bitterness. Still absolutely delicious, but not as good as a fresh Green.
Body felt a little on the thinner side of TH beers, but still very soft and pleasant.
Overall... This one is a top contender. I scrutinize it because it says "Green" on the can, but let me be clear. This DIPA is another from Tree House that goes above and beyond the expected hop-saturated flavor of its "competition". Heady and Pliny are damn good DIPAs. This one has them both beat and it's #4 on my list for TH Doubles. 801 charactersTblaisdell, Jan 25, 2016

LOOK: If clouds were orange, this is what they'd look like. Just a beautiful orange juice color.
SMELL:  Smells like a mixture of orange + grapefruit. Very pleasing.
TASTE: I still can't believe this is a DIPA. Drinks incredibly smooth, with that same orange/grapefruit you get in the aroma. Delicious. 
FEEL: Taste explodes the second it hits your tongue, + stays there for a bit after. Coats the mouth perfectly. 
OVERALL: Immeidately became not only a favorite IPA, but a favorite beer. Do what you can to get this beer. 634 charactersHarryS, Jan 25, 2016

S: Big tropical fruits - mangoes, pineapple, and limes with a delicate hop dankness
T: Huge rush of pineapple, limes, grass, and lemon on the tongue fades into a moderate sweetness (much less pronounced than Green); no discernible malt profile, but a distinct hoppiness
F: Bold carbonation on the initial sip, but underpinned by the classic smoothness of all Tree house brews - really reminded me of Juice Machine and King Julius for the soft mouthfeel
O: This is a world class DIPA. I tried this side-by-side with a regular can of Green and as others have commented this is simply an amped up version in all respects - flavor, hops, and mouthfeel. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew. As far as comparisons go, I thought this was more expertly crafted than Green. Everything from the bolder tropical notes to the softer feel on the palette was evident. Green is easily one of my favorite beers, but this just categorically enhanced the experience in a calculated and refined manner. Incredible beer. 1,092 charactersFireman_RK, Jan 23, 2016

4.86/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5L - ah, good ol' Green. Not as turbid as its little brother, but a beautiful deep hazy orange. It's almost like it has its own power source. A miniature radioactive core emanating out to the edges of the glass. Darker with tangerine fringes. Ultra-fine bubbly head clings to the glass with every jostle. I could swirl this for days. 
S - first thing I noticed was a huge bready blast. Deeper, danker, more intimidating than cheery Green. Waves of ripe orange juice. Pineapple on the end. Galaxy galore, a very deep, penetrating aroma. Tree House certainly does that well with their DIPAs. Saturating. 
T -  wow, more of the aroma. Galaxy hops reign supreme. Wheaty crackers up front with an alcohol warming starting in the third act. Overripe pineapple citrus smoothie. Juice is kicked up as the beer warms. Sweet, candied pineapple. All sorts of fruit blended together, rind and all. The definition of "pithy". It's like chewing on the string things and "filler" between orange slices. Mealy tanginess leaves an almost gritty sensation that coats my teeth and tongue. Powerful bitterness pervades. It sorta sneaks up on you and after I wrap my head around the suffocating flavor, I'm left wondering what's pinching my tongue! Insane amount of hops. Earthy and primal. Hints of crabgrass. A raw bitterness. Well done prickly tingles dry up the finish, leaving the lips craving another sip. Gets way stickier and sweeter as it ages. Like a fine white whine. Buttery vanilla. 
F - silky smooth. Rich and decadent. Fills the mouth with seemingly more beer than I put in there! Now if only the can could refill itself too!
O -  outstanding as usual from Tree House. I do prefer regular Green however, because the hops went a little overboard, covering up the subtle nuances that make Green delicious. The Galaxy hops give it too much of a "wheaty" taste and lacks the balance of Green. A shitton more bitterness that almost swats away any budding juice flavor. Still amazing beer though that commands attention on all levels. 2,025 charactersagreenman19, Jan 19, 2016

T: Follows the nose very well, tons of fruits up front, lots of papaya and pineapple. You also start to pick up some grapefruit bitterness, and then theres some still hoppy bitterness/dankness on the end and it leaves a great after taste. Can't even tell this is has alcohol
F: Perfect mouthfeel for an IPA. Nice a creamy feeling but still very refreshing, and coats your mouth with the flavor.
O: Probably my second favorite treehouse brew behind C22. Compared to most other treehouse brews it's quite bitter but it leaves such an amazing after taste, and has some great depth to its flavor. 785 charactersGinjaSlice, Jan 17, 2016

L: Pours like a tropical fruit juice with a nice, frothy white head. This seriously looks like orange juice mixed with pineapple juice. I'd honestly take the super hazy appearance over the filtered appearance all day.
S: Boy, you can tell that Tree House dumped a boatload of galaxy hops in here. Huge mango and papaya notes. There's some faint citrusy orange scents as well. The aroma is one of the most pleasant I've ever smelled.
T: These galaxy hops are quite in-your-face. I've never had a beer that was so pronounced in the galaxy hop department. Huge mango and papaya notes with some orange as well. This is also quite bitter. One of the most bitter IPAs that I can remember. This flavor profile is incredible. Definitely reminds me of an imperial Green.
F: This is a creamy, smooth beer. No alcohol to speak of. I definitely could session these beers no problem. Good thing it only comes around so often.
Overall: This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. I think this has entered my top 5 Imperial/Double IPAs. The overload of one of my favorite hops makes for a beer drinking experience that I've never had before. Tree House is unstoppable. 1,198 charactersRichD, Jan 16, 2016

Smells of sweet citrus, dank, and hoppy.  Tastes of fresh mango, orange and citrus.  Crisp and tropical, so smooth and so drinkable - controlled bitterness, faint sweetness.  Really stellar.  The flavor matches, then exceeds just about any Tree House IPA.  Green is an excellent IPA, so no doubt this was exciting before even cracking the can.  But Very Green exceeded expectations. 499 charactersanteatr23, Jan 15, 2016

Huge fluffy head, hazy peach orange
Nose is good but not what I was expecting, bright tropical fruit, mild dank resin, orange cream, guava passion fruit, pith, somewhat light though as I have to really fish for those characters.
Taste very bitter, big rind pith, tropical fruits, guava, bubblegum, resin, papaya, little  tangerine and pith, Clementine, juicy, touch of mango. Finish dry very bitter, rind pith, mild dank tropical. 
Nice creamy fluffy mouth, great carb.
Overall, this really doesn't seem like a correct version of Very Green. I've been trying to get this beer for a long time now, and this doens't seem like a good version, and even the Green I had recently seems very underwhelming, so perhaps the batch of hops is less potent than usual, or they got less of it. I'll def try this again next time it's around though. 876 charactersjlindros, Jul 05, 2015

A - Poured into the custom Tree House wine glass a hazy golden hue with a thin white head that fades slowly to leave light wisps.
S - Aromas of super dank citrus, lots of dank bitterness as well. Little herbal too.
T - Taste is similar to the nose. Dank, resinous citrus, grapefruit pith and a little peel. Just a little bit of herbalness.
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, drinks a little hot.
O - Overall this beer was good, but pales in comparison to how great regular 'ol Green is. I'd like to have this again though, just to see if in a more controlled environment my marks would be higher.

The aroma punches of fresh mango, stone fruit.
The flavor follows with pineapple, orange sorbet, Orange drink apricot, citrus pith, sweet herbs like spearmint. Hints of booze and astringency like a screwdriver.
(2015 batch)
The beer comes in an intense golden yellow, extremely hazy.
The aroma hits of dank herbal quality, bready malt, grapefruit pith, bright pineapple.
The flavor follows with that initial attack of bright pineapple, guava, watered down orange juice, grapefruit, Orangina, barely sweetness, but medium bready malt, then onto this aggressive dank quality that reminds me of fusel, grain alcohol, vodka. At 8.3%, it certainly isn't true alcohol, but a strange note from the hops.
In the end, very much Green in the front, but the malt and that huge dank bite really detract from the beer. A "big" disappointment, relatively speaking to Tree House standards and Green being the best IPA. 929 charactersdar482, Jun 19, 2015

Appearance: Very Green pours a beautiful hazy golden color with a white head that lasts a couple of minutes. The lacing on the glass is thick and lasts throughout the duration of the beer.
Aroma: I might as well be sticking my head into the freshest tropical fruit bowl ever - tons of mango, citrus, pineapple, passionfruit. Tropical fruit heaven. 
Taste: Just as the aroma indicates, the tropical and citrus flavors explode in my mouth. The beer only has a faint biscuity malt presence - the hops definitely dominate in the very best of ways. Although hop-forward, the beer only is a bit bitter. A slightly bitter - but still fruity - aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth, a tiny bit chewy, and the beer seems to live for a long time after its gone. 
Overall: This beer is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Every component of the beer comes together to create one of the best beers I've had in recent memory. Totally hop forward, but in the sexiest, most tropical, magical ways. The brewery limited each person to 2 750s - I really, really, really wish I could have purchased more. This is Green (the basic IPA) multiplied by a million. 1,186 charactersEmmaLo, May 25, 2014

Looks amazing. Smell is tropical fruits galore. Tangarine, mango, papaya and a biscuity malt sweetness in the back. This tastes like straight up juice, but only better. Huge orange flavor up front and finishes clean with that nice biscuit malt. Dare I say, better than Julius? I'd put this against any Hill beer. 420 charactersDavepoolesque, May 24, 2014
