Nose not as prominant as I thought but a great blend of booze and sweet roasted malt. Taste is boozy, and the sweet malts come together with hazelnuts.

I am not sure I get a lot of hazelnut in the beer (it could be the bbq burger or truffle fries), but it's one hell of a decadent beer. I appreciate that the Bruery's huge imperial stouts are a touch on the thin side. The beer is definitely boozy (a plus for me), but drinks more in the 12 to 14% range. Overall, Grey Monday is simply a fantastic beer. 417 charactershbmcdrew, Jan 07, 2017

Aroma, well this is the only beer I can think of where the wax smells awesome.  Aroma is the best thing about this beer, so dope.  Nuts, bourbon, roast, vanilla, oak.
Taste is very good, its pretty much just like Black Tuesday.  Rich deep brownie batter chocolate, oak, vanilla, sweetness that hides the immense alcohol relatively well.   Thick ass mouth feel.  
The main gripe I have about this beer is the cost.  Why in the fuck is this $10 more than Black Tuesday?  Those are some expensive ass hazelnuts!!!  I eschew this beer for just regular Black Tuesday for that reason alone.  But it is just as good, but if you can get basically the same beer for $10 less, well, that explains why I don't order this one anymore. 804 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 01, 2016

S: bourbon, milk chocolate, soy, toasted malts, dried sweet fruits, and earthy nuttiness
T: wow tonsssssss of sweetness upfront. It's a thick, sugary syrup sweetness. There is definitely some hazelnut behind that as well, with that milk chocolate. The nutiness is a nice companion to the sweetness. Bourbon is in here as well, but is pretty mellow and acts as a nice accent. I'm surprised to say this, but the alcohol presence is really not much in here. You can feel it on the tongue, but not much beyond a tingle on the back of the tongue
M: full, syrupy mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty low, as I'd expect 
O: really well crafted beer here. Huge ABV, but not extremely noticeable. It's very sweet though, so be prepared. This is the true definition of a sipper - take your time and enjoy this 954 charactershopsputin, Jul 14, 2016

The sweetness on these beers make dark lord seem like its not sweet at all. Lots of roasted malts and dark fruits in this one, but the back of the throat coating sweetness really puts me off of these beers(well also the pricetag on these too). Zero head when poured into a snifter, thinner than one would expect for such a huge beer but still pretty good. Just lots of sugary sweetness and alcohol. 511 charactersHopislovehopislife, Jun 20, 2016

Pours pretty flat and black.  The smell is pretty much the same as BT with a very small hint of hazelnuts.  I likely wouldn't have picked it up if I didn't know prior.   The taste is a somewhat subdued version of BT.  It is just as sweet with raisins, chocolate, and vanilla.  The aftertaste is where the hazelnuts actually shine.  It is subtle, but I feel like I just ate some.  The texture is pretty thick, but a little flat.  The alcohol is masked a lot better than BT.  
I like it better than BT, but not by much. It's a very subtle variation on the base, but welcomed. 604 charactersnawpnawp, May 31, 2016

I like this beer. It's tasty. Plenty of rich body, diabetes-level sweetness, and a well-buried booze. How they accomplish that last part is beyond me. 
The one thing I find odd about this beer is that I would be hard-pressed to differentiate it from Black Tuesday. Hazelnuts in the mix? News to me from simply drinking it. It's got some syrupy sweetness that is Frangelico-like, but hell, so is Black Tuesday. 
So yeah, it's good. 504 charactersONovoMexicano, May 10, 2016

Certainly, these are pretty hot for a typical beer, but as a 19% stout, they are done extremely well.  I'd love to have one to age "for decades" as Bruery states.  The combination of the sweet hazelnut, bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and roast is pretty hard to beat.  This beer should be rated much higher, but maybe a fresh one is just way too boozy causing things to slip.  Hopefully I'll be able to try this fresh and extremely old as well. 524 charactersrabbott2, Apr 07, 2016

A:  Poured into a snifter to a deep black beer with a small tan head that disappears quickly with no lacing
S:  Smells of bourbon barrel influence with vanilla and caramel along with some oak.  Slight roast malt, coffee and chocolate with an underlying nuttyness.
T:  Taste is hazelnuts, caramel, vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate covered espresso beans with some oak.  Slight vinous character as well at times.  Swallow is a little licorice, lingering caramel, vanilla and roasted malts with more hazelnuts and soft warm oak.
M:  Big and thick in the mouth with soft carbonation and a dry finish from the alcohol.
O:  Quite different from Chocolate Rain.  this beer still has a lot of sweetness but it has some great complexity and some fantastic flavors.  Very mellow alcohol flavors from the age as well.  This is another exceptional twist on Black Tuesday from The Bruery. 894 charactersSHODriver, Mar 20, 2016

Nearly jet black with light brown at the edges, ring of tan head no lace. Smell is well roasted, some anise, bourbon, oaky and fudgey, some dark chocolate sweetness as well. Taste is oaky, like a nutella like fudge cake, roast and bourbon, moderate sweetness with some alcohol to cut it.Lightly carbonated, big thick full body. Awesome stuff, my second favourite BT variant after Chocolate Rain. 427 characterspeensteen, Jan 20, 2016

Smell is pure molten chocolate, very intoxicating... while flavors have some nice chocolate, raisin, and nuts---kind of a funky nutty flavor-- overall they are just eclipsed by the uber-molasses-sweetness!.... way too sweet for me, hard to even get one glass down! 333 charactersReady4aHeady, Nov 30, 2015

A:  Jet black and sludgy.   Used motor oil.  No chance of a head with this weight.  
S:  Sharp tones of molasses and booze.  Burnt sugar, oak and grass complete the bouquet. 
T:  The sweet molasses aspect dominates, quickly met by drying oak tones and booze.  There's a berry-ish or raisiny aspect I can't quite put my finger on, but it adds depth and complexity.  Caramelly malts resonate with the caramelly aspects of the bourbon, as a touch of bittering hops keeps things drinkable.    Long finish with sweet residuals between sips.  
M:   Chewy and stodgy, as viscous as possible.  
Of the line of the Black Tuesday stouts, I think this is the best.  Can't wait for the Grand Reserve. 720 charactersrand, Nov 27, 2015

This has been a beer that I've wanted to try ever since I learned of its existence.    Hazelnut flavor still very much intact, especially on the nose.    The nose was chocolate, bourbon, hazelnuts, and rich molasses.    Taste followed form.    Overall, I enjoyed the chocolate in Mocha Wednesday a bit more, but the addition of hazelnut puts it ahead of Black Tuesday to me personally.  I have a bottle of Chocolate Rain that I will open soon to complete my comparison. 525 characterstmbgnicu, Nov 24, 2015

4.37/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received in a trade with my favorite Bruery society member, ThickNStout. Held onto this one a little bit hoping to open with friends in the interest of not dying (19%!!!), but finally couldn't wait any longer and cracked it open. Poured out of a 750 ml brown bottle with thick grey wax around the neck and crown and a 2014 vintage on the label. Poured into an oversized brandy-style snifter.
Appearance (4.0) - Initial pour comes out looking almost flat, with very little head being generated, so I amp up the aggression on my pour to coax a finger of khaki colored foam that doesn't even last but a few seconds, quickly receding to a moderate ringlet around the sides of the glass and pretty much zero lace. The body is dark chestnut brown and doesn't allow any light to penetrate. Atop the surface of the liquid, you can see little flecks that I assume are created by the oils in the hazelnuts that this beer was aged on. They aren't actually sediment, but tiny oil-like imperfections.
Smell (4.5) - The aroma is fantastic, with the sweet, boozy notes wafting out of the glass like you expect from Black Tuesday, but with a more decadent dimension imparted by the smell of hazelnuts--that luscious, nutty sweetness. Caramel and bourbon are also major players in the aroma, with some fainter notes of bittersweet chocolate. I wish the bitterness from the roasted malts provided more counterpoint to the sweeter smelling elements, but such is Black Tuesday.
Taste (4.25) - Much of the taste follows directly from the aroma, with the base of sweet, caramel-infused boozy stout and faint bitterness from the roasted malts being enhanced by fantastic hazelnut flavoring. It's a delicious Nutella booze bomb--an ideal dessert beer to share with several friends after dinner, and it's plenty sweet for your non-beer friends to enjoy as well. It finishes with a lingering sweetness and slight kiss of bitterness, just enough to prevent you from feeling like you are actively developing diabetes as you drink it.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - A nice full body and fairly low carbonation, but just enough to avoid feeling flat. There is also a viscous, mouth-coating feeling to it, possibly from the hazelnut oils.
Overall (4.5), a delicious dessert beer and in many ways comes across like the top of the potential that Black Tuesday is capable of. Enjoying a fantastic variant like this makes me want to have a chance to sample a "Mexican" take on the base beer, with cinnamon, chiles and chocolate. But for now, this fantastic hazelnut variant will suffice. 2,544 charactersLambicPentameter, Nov 17, 2015

4.18/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Pours thick and with a decent amount of fizzy head. The color of the pour is pretty much black, but a touch of brown appears on the edges when held to light. The little bit of head that formed didn't last long, but was a light tan in color. No real lacing to speak of, but there are some alcohol legs as you drink it down.
S- Huge and sweet booze characteristics are the entire scent of this beer. The hazelnuts are definitely prominent up front, but the barrel and whiskey scents take over shortly thereafter. Tons of bourbon and oak come through as the beer warms up and the smell ends with a lingering, sweet whiskey that is very strong.
T- When this beer hits the tongue, it follows the scent pretty closely. The hazelnuts and a touch of chocolate hit right up front in an intense, sweet flavor. The whiskey ramps up to try to balance the incredible sweetness next and totes a big does of booze flavor and a ton of oak. There is a return of the sweetness after the barrel and whiskey that is also accompanied by the alcohol burn. The sweetness and hazelnuts linger a good while after the drink, along with the alcohol burn.
M- This beer is incredibly strong, with prominent burn in both feel and flavor. It actually isn't especially thick for its alcohol and style, but it is fairly smooth. The carbonation is unexpectedly high for this beer. It is a very slow drink, possibly slower than a sipper, due to the alcohol content.
Overall, I wasn't surprised, but this beer is incredibly sweet and strong. It is actually kind of hard to drink due to the very sweet flavor and strength of the beer. It is what it is, and it is good, but if you don't like sweet beers, stay away from this one. 1,698 charactersboilermakerbrew, Oct 11, 2015

At the top with the Bourbon County series for me.  Can't wait to compare to the other days and rain.  The nut component really adds to the already great stout/bourbon flavors there in mass quantity. 340 charactersBung, Sep 19, 2015

Aroma of booze, huge amounts of dark fruits, and a wee bit of hazelnut.  The flavor is sweet as can be. Certainly is diabetes in a glass. Still hoped for more hazelnut. So much flavor crushing my tongue.  Warming...yes. Hot...no.  Goes down entirely too easy for the 18.6%. Paired very well with frozen raspberries. Flavor follows nose well. Very intense.  Body is full and the low level carbonation is perfect. 466 charactersBosoxfan20, Sep 14, 2015

Pours a dark sort of caramel brown, huge huge huge nose, tons of dark dried fruit sweetness, not that much carbonation. Has a great  BBA flavor, tons of vanilla sweetness and a slight hazelnut finish.  Not that far off from the base Black Tuesday. 269 charactersbgold86, Aug 28, 2015

Not as much hazelnut as I was hoping for, but still plenty of delicious going on in this bottle.  Having the majority of Bruery's big stouts, I would rank it above Mocha Wednesday and Black Tuesday, but below Chocolate Rain.  Overall a fine stout, just watch out for that abv, because it knocked me out! 359 charactersLochnessmonster, Aug 27, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Look - Almost pitch black and super thick, slight head at first that quickly dissipates leaving an oily, black beer
Smell - Smells malty, with hint of caramel.  But more than anything the overwhelming smell is that of hazelnut (as advertised) with a whiff of bourbon.  A very sweet smelling beer.
Taste - Hazelnut is the first thing that hits you.  Very strong, which is followed by molasses, caramel, coffee and chocolate.  Bourbon is very faint but definitely there and add to the overall flavor.  Booze is ridiculously well hidden... how can an 18% beer not taste boozy?!?
Feel - Super thick and sticky.  Very little carbonation.
Overall - Very fun beer.  Never tasted a beer like it.  Worth the hype 707 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Aug 17, 2015

This is one of those really great stouts that is worth seeking out. 
From the description, it should be apparent that if you like Black Tuesday -and also like hazelnuts- you are really going to like this beer. 
The only dilemma here is that you have to make the decision of whether you want to cellar this beer or enjoy it "fresh." 
A recent vintage is going to be strong on hazelnut presence, while, over time, the beer is going to lose that novelty and become "just" Black Tuesday. (Note: cellared Black Tuesday tastes amazing)
I would definitely share this beer and split it into two pours, one chilled, the other warmed to room temperature. The former is super smooth and strong on hazelnuts, the latter boozier and more representative of what Black Tuesday has to offer. 
Overall, a great beer worth trying. 831 charactersrodmanfor3, Aug 11, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours black. Fairly thin with minimal head. Not as viscous as I was hoping, but typical of a barrel aged beer. 
Smells excellent. Chocolate, sweet roasted nuts, vanilla. All masked a hair by a lot of alcohol. 
Tastes outstanding, but there is that significant amount of heat up front that I smelled. Tons of bourbon. You will want to sip this a bit. Tip of the tongue for best flavor. However, once the initial blast of alcohol passes this beer starts to shine. It's a hazelnut throwdown. Also some vanilla, molasses, and then closes with some brownie/fudge like chocolate. Slightly bitter with some more astringent heat in the aftertaste. 
Body is a tad thin. Carbonation is somewhat prickly. 
Interesting what my friend San Fran Jake has to say about this with some age because my first thought was, I wonder what 6-18 months would do. Obviously it gets hard to hide that kind of abv, and it really isnt that bad, but I think I would have this brew in the 4.75 + range overall if it came in around 12-15%. Still right on that world class line.

A: Pours near black with a couple fingers of dark brown coffee-colored head that faded into a faint bubbly collar. 
S: Rich notes of leather, bourbon barrel, vanilla, caramel and faint hazelnut mixed with fudge. Smells pretty much like BT. Very decadent but not overly sweet. 
T: Very intense and potent flavors of BT mixed with silky smooth hazelnut. Bourbon, vanilla, cocoa, fudge, leather, and tobacco come through strongly, and I get hints of hazelnuts, caramel, toast, butterscotch and chocolate syrup in the finish. The aftertaste is full of vanilla, leather, and tobacco, with a good dose of bourbon as well. Overall the flavors are thick, well-integrated, complex, and dangerously buttery and smooth. I could drink this whole bottle (oh wait, I am). The chocolate flavors really linger in the aftertaste as well, especially as the beer reaches room temp. 
M: Thick and heavy body; chewy, slick, and smooth mouthfeel; with low but tingly carbonation. The sweet and sticky bourbon character is present, but this beer is not hot or overly boozy. Very integrated. 
O: Dare I say this is an improvement on BT? The hazelnuts are not dominating, but they add another layer of complexity to an already complex and world class stout. I wish I had more bottles of these. Thanks again for the hook-up Tyler. 1,379 charactersscottfrie, Jul 20, 2015

I'd rate this 4.75 on all ratings, but the hazelnuts and taste have fallen off significantly.

Appearance: Pours a dark brown and leaves a mini half finger of tan head that fades right away to a tan rim around the glass. (4.25)
Smell: Big nutty hazelnuts, fudgy chocolate, oak, vanilla, slight smokiness. Real nice. (4.75)
Taste: Lots of oak, molasses, dark chocolate, nutty finish. Candied dates, bourbon, vanilla. Almost dominated by the oak, but there are some other nice flavors in here as well. Fairly smooth, I'm guessing the couple years in the bottle mellowed it a bit. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carb with a medium, slightly syrupy, creamy body. If I have any complaints, maybe this could be a bit thicker but it's still nice and creamy. (4.25)
Overall: Really well done with nice, huge flavors, including hazelnuts, coming through in a great way. Good amount of chocolate and bourbon flavors as well. Alcohol is there all the way through but not dominant. (4.5) 996 charactersResuin, Jun 06, 2015

Split between two days, Slight hazelnut smell though I'm under the weather, hazelnuts give it a small nutty taste,  the bourbon part had mellowed nicely but it's still there.    Another good part is I didn't get the sweetness taste as I did with BT and CR, this was overall very good and quite drinkable until the alcohol catches up to you. 387 charactersSoNiC21, Apr 14, 2015

Lots of bourbon and nuts with some coffee and chocolate in the flavour.  Booze is very much present.  It drinks a lot lower than the 18% ABV it is, however, this beer is too boozy for my liking.  I did, however, drink nearly the entire bottle myself.
That resulted in a fairly terrible hangover the next day. 500 charactersBakaGaijin, Feb 18, 2015

4.22/5  rDev -4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to baybum for dropping this on me, a beer that I’ve had at tastings but never drowned myself in. Here’s to hoping. 750ML silver-waxed bottle of 2013 vintage, split with my wife. 
The pours is stout black, which should be a description on model planes. Carbonation is low, because straight moonshine-level ABV usually has no bubbles, right? The nose is BT + nuts: barrel, sweet malts, & a surprisingly strong nut shot. I mean, nut smell. That doesn’t…wait. It smells like nuts. Well, shit. Nutty? That’s better. 
Grey Monday is the sweet hot mess of Black Tuesday with an addition of nuts. Now, I couldn’t ID the body as a hazelnut, but my wife, who drinks hazelnut creamer with a dash of coffee each morning, no doubt could. Big fappy bourbon notes suffuse the brain pan & go straight to the frontal cortex, along with a toothy bite of alcohol. Vanilla, oak, enough malt sweetness to…is that a tooth I just lost? Nuts cut the sugar-nado just enough to keep it tolerable (for a mortal – I love sweets!). Ends in a froth of star anise, licorice, & a forecast of bourbon headache on the morrow. It goes without saying this is tar-thick. It’s a sipper, but one I could sip until I woke up in an episode of Intervention. You’re just jealous of my roll, man!
Certainly an epic beer in every sense of the word. Big, thick, brutal, laden with alcohoolc, clears the bar of good, then very good, & settles into the stratosphere of excellent. I hope I can walk when I’m done. 1,496 charactersmaximum12, Feb 07, 2015

T- follows the nose pretty much. Nutty, booziness, sweet.

Smells delicious, lots of vanilla, a little hazelnut,  you can tell it will be very sweet.
Boozy flavor, not a lot of nuts but plenty of the regular BT taste in there.
Great beer but it´s way too big, 125ml bottles would be so much easier. 339 characterssunnrider, Jan 21, 2015

Aroma of black chocolates and hazelnut are pretty interesting with light vanilla notes also noticeable. Taste is a very nice mix of chocolate and hazelnut notes with balanced residual sugar level which is usually not a strong point for the Bruery. Body is full enough with good carbonation and light warming alcohol. I really enjoyed this beer and I was surprised by the fact that it is quite drinkable considering the ABV and the base beer. 552 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 06, 2015

4.41/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750mL bottle into a large Bruery snifter. 2014 vintage. Acquired in a trade with vitese, thank you sir!
Pours a deep brown, nearly black opaque body with a small light hazlenut head that reduces quickly to leave no lacing or retention. 
Allowed to warm for ~30 minutes prior to drinking for maximum flavor and aroma profiles. On the nose comes nice potent vanilla, bourbon, butterscotch, caramel, milk chocolate aromas. 
On the tongue comes that big, sticky, syrupy sweetness of the Black Tuesday base, combined with sweet molasses, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, bourbon. The aftertaste is where the hazlenuts shine through, with nutty notes followed by a nice, deep roastyness on the finish. Mouthfeel isn't as thick as you'd expect with low carbonation as expected. 
Overall I'd say this is probably my favorite BT variant so far, the complexity is definitely there and the hazlenuts added something to this beer. Definitely a sipper! 953 charactersgcamparone, Jan 03, 2015

2014 vintage sampled at room temperature. 
Looks exactly what a 19.50% beer would look like. No head, syrupy body and insane legs. 
Aroma is rich chocolate syrup with with bourbon present in a supporting role. Just intense/rich aromas and characteristics. 
Flavor is like literally drinking chocolate syrup. Rich, viscous and insanely sweet. We each got 3-4 ounce pours and even though I went back for seconds (TOTALLY shouldn't have) it was just enough.
Still prefer Mocha Wednesday, but this was still tasty. 566 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 10, 2014

From a 750 into a snifter
Vintage: 2013
Black Tuesday with hazelnuts
APPEARANCE: A very transparent, thin, and relatively light brown pour yields a thin, loose, bubbly, off-white head with lousy retention. Head quickly fades to a thin ring, which eventually vanishes as well. Looks flat by the end and absolutely no lacing at all. Much too thin and transparent for the style as well. Very disappointing. Same as Chocolate Rain, but clearly worse than older vintages of the Black Tuesday. 
SMELL: Bold and boozy, just like its base beer. Basically this is all the elements of recent vintages of Black Tuesday with a touch of hazelnuts, so it passes inspection in that sense. Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, milk chocolate, with hints of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Just enough hazelnut to cut the big, boozy aromas and bourbon barrel. Rather nice. 
TASTE: Big and boozy. Again, this is Black Tuesday with a touch of hazelnuts. Pulls it off too. The nuts are probably more prevalent here than in the nose, but they still don’t get obnoxious, which I was afraid they might. Lots of bourbon, oak, milk chocolate and some hazelnuts up front, then a huge and massive, boozy swallow. Big finish of bourbon, oak again, coconut, milk chocolate, a bit of roasted malt, some bitter dark chocolate and sweet cream linger and linger. Some light nut flavor also joins the show as the flavors persist on the palate. This is good stuff. Hot and boozy of course, but not as much as I’d originally expected. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A bit prickly on the palate, not as smooth as hoped, though it is 19% I guess, goes down okay with a burn at the swallow and finishes sticky. Some decent heat lingers as well. A bit prickly and airy in the mouth. Could be smoother, but others at this level of ABV have been worse. 
OVERALL: This is quite nice actually. Feel is not as good as the other variants perhaps, and the look is equally as disappointing, but the flavor is basically decadent Black Tuesday and the hazelnut addition is restrained but present, adding another dimension to the flavor profile. Something I quite enjoyed and would love to solo another bottle of the next batch when it becomes available. Thanks again for the bottles gents. Good stuff all around. 2,357 charactersJeffo, Nov 09, 2014

An aggressive pour yielded no head or lacing with a rather flat looking dark brown, nearly black body.  The nose was incredibly big and incredibly boozey.  Tons of dark fruit and chocolate fudge along with hints of vanilla, oak, raisins, and subtle hazelnut.  The taste follows suit with huge boozey bourbon and chocolate fudge along with hints of raisins, tobacco, oak, port wine. and molasses.  As it warms, the hazelnuts really emerge...beer meets Nutella.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, boozey and hot, with almost no carbonation.  Overall, this was definitely better than Black Tuesday, albeit just as hot and boozey, but a tad bit more drinkable.  The sweetness was dangerously close to cloying, but I think the hazelnuts gave it enough balance to make it a pretty enjoyable sipper. 838 charactersbeerdrifter, Oct 18, 2014

Appearance:  No surprise that the beer has no head but I was surprised to the some foaming bubble up from the lip of the bottle; a quick pour took care of that problem; the fudge brown liquid is very leggy, though there is no lacing to speak of
Smell:  The alcohol tones tingle the nostrils, wafting chocolate, molasses, Bourbon, cinnamon and vanilla elements: there is a nut aspect in there, but I was expecting more from the hazelnuts
Taste:  Fudgy and sweet, up front, with the Bourbon bombing the tastebuds; wherever the hazelnuts were hiding in the aroma, they make up for it in the flavor as they take over in the mid-palate and dominate the finish; though the hazelnuts make a statement, the chocolate fudge, vanilla, molasses are all in there, as well; the sweetness lingers in the finish
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied, with low carbonation; quite a lot of heat in the gullet
Overall:  An intense beer and a bit too sweet for me; but I can respect the impact of the hazelnuts on the base beer

Got a lot of chocolate, bourbon, but tons of hazelnut at the end (in a good, expected way). Some sweetness in there as well.
Been saving for a buddy from Boston to come visit during GABF. I'd put it well beyond any of the varieties I've had from Goose Island Bourbon County series. The Hazelnuts provide serious taste at the tail-end of this beer. Despite a super high-ABV, it wasn't too hot. Now I need to find more... 467 charactersMtnSoup, Oct 07, 2014

750 pulled out tonight by Syndicate!! Darrel wields the beer penis tonight!! Pours thick and black (as expected) head is short lived.. nothing when it  comes to lacing or retention.
Nose is very nice... oaky chocolate with tons of barrel presence.. Unfortunately for me, the nut presence is very artificial.. Not "nutty" but extract... Not necessarily a bad thing, but it definitely could be less extract forward.
Grey Monday is everything that all the huge ABV Bruery beers deliver on... big vanilla and chocolate.. oak and hazelnut candy... I dig it for sure, but it is an ABV and sugar bomb that isn't good at all when delivered in a single glass.. Too sweet and the hazelnut extract is an error that I expect from Mr. Rue.
Glad I got a chance to try this one... Seriously.. Darrel is an animal!! But for my palate, Grey Monday/Black Tuesday/Chocolate Rain are Diabeetus bottles.

Batch 2
18.5% ABV
Appearance: Very dark brown with a modest beige head which dissipated fairly quickly. Considerable legs on this one.  I've always felt that Black Tuesday and the variants are more dark brown than black.
Smell: Upfront Bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate/cocoa, and a bit of hazel nut. No significant presence of ethanol in the nose which is great considering the strength.
Taste: Bourbon, raisins, vanilla, brown sugar, mild chocolate, and some mild coffee/roast malts and hazelnuts appearing towards the finish. To me the biggest impact the hazelnuts have is in subduing the alcohol that's present in fresh black Tuesday.
Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Some heat but good for it's alcohol level.  The hazelnuts lend a semi oily feel to the mouth-feel.  There is a moderate level of carbonation which is impressive considering the ABV.
Overall: Great high alcohol beer.  The hazel nuts improve the mouth-feel and subdue the alcohol compared to the base Black Tuesday. 1,021 charactersIKR, Sep 27, 2014

Pours a fairly dark brown, with a small quarter inch head, and basically no lacing, save for a few faint stripes. Looks really, really oily.
Smells really strongly of roasted, caramelized hazelnuts, plus intensely sweet bourbon, vanilla, and searing booze.
This is one strong mofo of a beer, and incredibly sweet. If you drink it fast, it's cloying, but if you drink it slowly, it's not as sweet, and much more doable. There's sugary vanilla cream, roasted hazelnut, hazelnut frosting, chocolate syrup, sweet syrupy bourbon, and a big boozy heat. It's kind of like drinking hazelnut gasoline, really. It's delicious, but it's so hard to drink large amounts of this.
The body is slightly thinner than  I would've expected, but it has a creamy, sticky, oily mouthfeel, and an almost non-existent amount of carbonation.
An unbelievably extreme beer here, it's done well, but you must share the bottle or you will die. 995 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 20, 2014

Syrupy, melted dark chocolate, sweetness. Hazelnuts picked up after sitting a while, but in a great way. HIDES the 19.5%.

3.75/5  rDev -14.8%750ml bottle that has been kept in the fridge since it was release. Poured into a matching Bruery snifter, the brew appears dark brown with cola clarity around the edges. A couple big bubbles appear and fade quick. When you look close at the surface, you can seem some of the hazelnut oils collect and form across the top.
The aroma opens nutty the goes to anise and straight belgian candy sugar sweetness with a solid backing of booze that is somewhat solvent feeling. The taste includes anise and a huge booze and roasty char character before getting dominated by a clash of candy sugar verse bourbon heat. Sadly, the sugar and alcohol dominates any feeling of the barrel nuance.
This is medium to full bodied with a light level of carbonation. An absolute attack of alcohol verse sugar. As much as I was anticipating liking this, I ended up not being the biggest fan. 872 charactersstakem, Aug 25, 2014

Its sheer blackness is only impeded by its chalky cocoa haze, casting a brownish depth. Decadent aromas of port and sherry wrap around flavors of chocolate fudge, espresso, cashew and blackstrap molasses. Early sweetness fare similarly as its tawny liquor clings to the mouth like silk.
Its full toasted sweetness is taste and felt on the middle palate while tangy alcohol reinforce the taste of fortified brandy, grape and plum, leather and oak. All the while, a foundation of cake batter and toasted soft nuts provide a savory earthiness that's stern and unyielding.
Its incredible oily body is viscous, dense and indefinite in its linger. While strong vinous and rum alcohols thin the body slightly, a granular texture of silt seem to rise from a cocoa powder base and gives the stout a bit of grit. 1,006 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 23, 2014

BA review #550, here's to milestones!
A big thanks to NHbeerguy for sending this over in a trade!
A: Pours a very dark brown nearly black, opaque with less than 1/2 a fingers width of tan colored head. Head is fizzy and dissipates down almost immediately. Leaves effectively zero lacing, but some nice alcohol legs. Looks like a cola. 
S: Very sweet, with dark fruits and syrup sugary sweetness. Accompanying the sweetness is a ethanol booze and a big charred oak bourbon character. Subtle cocoa and bourbony vanilla. I dont get much hazelnut at all, and probably wouldn't have even noticed it if I didnt know it was brewed with them. Aroma seems a bit boozier than I remember from BT and CR. 
T: A big, decadent sweetness is the first thing I get; dark fruits, cocoa, 
and syrupy sugar. This is balanced out but some really great roasty and bourbon barrel notes. Theres an herbaceous component and boozy ethanol. Like the nose, I dont get much hazelnut at all, although it starts to come out a bit as the beer warms towards room temperature. Great balance of sweetness, booze, and roasty. Excellent. 
M/D: Mouthfeel is very smooth and somewhat chewy, but a bit syrupy. ABV is certainly noticeable but is a welcomed and necessary component to balance out the sweet. Carbonation is very low, which is appropriate. Like most of the huge ABV Bruery beers this one is dangerously drinkable. 
O: Excellent beer. Not that different from BT IMO though, and I wish the hazelnut characters were more prominent. Out of BT, CR, and GM, I think CR is still my favorite. That being said, this a wonderful beer. Highly recommend. 4.5 1,667 characterszac16125, Jul 15, 2014

Cellared, and then refrigerated for about 20 minutes, just so I could compare it to room temp. Poured into a Reserve Society stemless snifter. Deep cola brown color, slightly translucent around the edges, a finger of tan head quickly dissipated, leaving nothing behind, but a few legs on the glass. Not as dark/opaque as I would've expected. Big bourbon aroma, sweet milk chocolate, solvent, caramel. Similarly, the taste was very boozy, bourbon, vanilla cream, milk chocolate, sweet caramel, anise, lots of solvent. If any hazelnut was there, it was very light to the point of nearly being an afterthought, almost not worth mentioning. Body was a lot thinner than expected, especially for the higher ABV, the solventy booze I think really contributing to this. Mouthfeel was greasy and messy. Absolutely no smoothness whatsoever. Strange because Black Tuesday had a bigger body and better mouthfeel. Overall, this was ok, but not really anything special. Not that much different than BT, just thinner and messier. 
I would've liked to have tried it fresh to get more of the hazelnut flavor, but could it really have faded THAT much over a few months? Plus considering the booziness now, I'm guessing it would've overwhelmed the flavor when it was fresh anyway. Another Bruery bomb. 1,318 charactersRifugium, Jul 14, 2014

3.6/5  rDev -18.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5A: Pours a near opaque black color. A two finger tan head quickly forms, but recedes just as quickly. Par for the coarse with the alcohol level and style.
S: Barrel aroma is strong and up front. A big sweetness in the nose, with chocolate, roasted malts, and roasted nuts. While a huge and boarding on over barring nose, still enjoyable.
T: Like the nose, this boarders on over barring but still fairly enjoyable. A huge barrel character with an equally large sweetness. Some roast, and coffee with an enjoyable nutty flavor. All help to try and balance the huge aspect of the beer.
M/D: Low carbonation, viscous, and just huge. Alcohol is certainly apparent, but almost kept in check. I can at least enjoy a few ounces.
For this massive barrel aged imperial stout, this is somewhat enjoyable. Though, again, I can find plenty of the same style I enjoy much more. That are much easier to get, and in many cases locally made. Interesting to try, but not one of my favorites on the style. 987 characterschamp103, Jul 05, 2014

Bottle to Bruery Tulip
750ml- Grey Wax
2013 Release
App- This was about the same as BT. Just thick, dark and viscous in the glass. A small amount of brown bubbles formed and was gone rather quickly.
Smell- When I first had a BT, I thought it was more port with a big sweetness, phenol alcohols and fruits. This was like that but the chocolate and hazelnut dominated the flavors. When I put my nose in the glass, I felt I was smelling a hazelnut chocolate milk.
Taste- I felt it this was actually better than BT and MW. Its a good stout due to the base beer. This highlighted the chocolate and hazelnut way more than MW and coffee. This had more flavor and was creamier and layered. 
Mouth- Thick and viscous. A low carbonation level and was very creamy just like BT. The hazelnut dominates the residual flavors along with the chocolate.
Drink- It was a good beer. It was expected. I appreciate when someone says its a hazelnut beer, it should taste like hazelnuts. This was that and was a huge beer. 1,025 charactersFosterJM, Jul 01, 2014

S - Big bourbon! Hints of hazelnut, chocolate, toasted malts. Smells very sugary and sweet. Desert beer?
T - Slightly let down by the amount of hazelnut in the taste. Pretty much none. Reminded me more of a chocolate stout than anything else. Don't get me wrong, this is a big, sweet barrel bomb, but the hazelnut that I was hoping for just wasn't there. For the money I could have just gotten a Black Tuesday. 
M - Very sticky and stays on the palette for a while. Small amount of carbonation. As always for the Bruery, so smooth for %18.5. 
O - This beer was on my radar for a while and I was a little let down. Next time I'll just get another Chocolate Rain. 785 charactersThePaleRider, Jun 30, 2014

Pours dark brown, murky, almost like a BA Old Ale or Barleywine, but maybe a bit darker. Nearly no head, what is there is a yellowish khaki color that is just a ring around the top of the glass. Aroma of big caramel notes, pralines, hazelnuts, booze, huge vanilla, maybe some coocnunt. Flavor follows the aroma perfectly with massive nutty caramel vanilla notes, some light marshmallow, bourbon galore, booze, sweet brown sugar. Wow. This blows away BT and CR for me. Really drinks more like a BA Barleywine or BA Scotch Ale than a stout. Mouthfeel is big, thick, boozy, and warming with low carbonation. Just a really beautiful beer and thus far easily my favorite variant of the BT brew. 767 charactersBMMillsy, May 17, 2014

Jet black appearance. The wax from the bottle smells amazing..tempted to chew it like the wax candy from the 70s. Big bold imperial stout flavor with a nice bourbon coating on my tongue, with the hazelnuts on the back end. A bit hot (hey dummy, its 18.5%), but hidden well for the percentage.
I actually enjoyed the bottle more than I did from the tap at the Reserve Socitey party. Will sit on one or two of these for a year to see if the heat drops a bit. 
I'm a sucker for hazelnut, and this one is the best I've ever had. Outstanding. 612 charactersdvmin98, May 11, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Had an opportunity to try this beer at Freshcraft in downtown Denver. The place was claustrophobicly packed with people, but I'm glad I stuck around to try this beer. So full they didn't have proper glassware.
A&S: Brown/black colored beer. No head or sign of carbonation. Spots of oily slicks on the top. Huge toffee and caramel notes. Not a ton of chocolate and only a hint of coffee. Alcohol in the mix, but not overly present.
T&M: Amazingly unique. Tons of Toffee and caramel again. Dark fruits and milk chocolate mixed in. Similar to the aroma alcohol is there but not in your face and especially not for pushing 20% ABV. Didn't get any nutty notes. Incredibly smooth and silky. Very thick and chewy body.
Overall: Unbelievably good. I broke my no more than $1 an ounce rule, but honestly it was more than worth it. Easily goes down in my top 5 for any style and would come close to rivaling CBS(even though they are completely different). I really hope I have a chance some day to sit down with a bottle of the beer and give it the rating justice it deserves, instead of quick notes. 1,093 charactersminterro, Apr 10, 2014

A: Dark black with a thin tan head. Essentially opaque with almost no visible carbonation.
S: Hazelnut up front, with thick aromas of dark cacao and huge oak barrel, with coffee, tobacco and musty leather in the background.
T: Sweet hazelnut, oak, coffee and cacao nearly in balance, roasted malt sweetness, drying tobacco, and the alcohol burn and sweet. Sweet oak and chocolate in the hang.
M: A bit thin body and mouthfeel for style, but far from watery. Mouthfeel is sticky with carbonation sensation on the low side. The alcohol is certainly noticeable but it doesn't seem as "hot" as Black Tuesday.
O: Really quite good, and an improvement on the base beer in my opinion. Huge alcohol and huge sweetness are still predominant characteristics though - certainly not a subtle beer. But an enjoyable one. 886 charactersmacrosmatic, Mar 16, 2014

Black and viscous with a thin, beige collar that quickly fades to nil, giving a still appearance. The aroma brings booze, chocolate, roast and some sweet hazelnuts. Really tasty beer, though I do prefer both Black Tuesday and Chocolate Rain to this. Sweet and boozy. Packed wih flavor. Full bodied with moderately low carbonation. The hazelnut character is certainly present but doesn't overpower. A fun beer. 465 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 11, 2014

Pours midnight black, chestnut at the very edges with a small pale tan cap. Wisp of a halo linger but leave no lace. As with the base beer and all it's siblings, swirling will coat the glass well and produce thick legs. 
Invitingly sweet nose with string hazelnut, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and oak with a noticeable undercurrent of booze
Big, bold and delicious. The hazelnut is strong and up front with plenty of other layers. Dark chocolate, cream coffee, sweet bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramel and molasses all mixed in with a pleasant alcohol burn. A delightful sipper that can be milked for well over an hour of enjoyment. 
Oily, heavy body with light carbonation so this really settles right down to make it's self at home on the tongue. Hazelnut for days in the finish but it leaves room for some sweet bourbon, vanilla and smooth chocolate. 
I haven't had them back to back yet but I like this almost as much as Chocolate Rain. The hazelnuts raise the already luscious Black Tuesday to delecable new heights. I'm tempted to try cellaring a bottle for a year or two but fear that the hazelnuts that make this beer so special are already starting to fade. So drink up, this stuff is incredible! 1,365 charactersThickNStout, Mar 01, 2014

Pours opaque black with a faint tan head that quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. 
Smell is dominated by bourbon with faint hints of vanilla, chocolate and hazelnuts. 
Taste is a sweet mixture of dark chocolate, dark roasted malt and hazelnuts with accents of oak and vanilla. Bourbon flavor is strong toward the finish but is not as overpowering as it is in the aroma. 
The texture is thick and syrupy with low carbonation. 
This is a very well executed, complex and huge imperial stout. Seek this beer out and share among friends. 594 charactersFurlinator, Feb 23, 2014

wax smells amazing...insane like hazelnuts... pours a dark black with a great beige head. vanilla, hazelnuts, slight bourbon on the nose. very nice aroma. the taste starts off hot but quickly balances out with the bourbon and hazelnuts.

The nose starts with rich chocolate and vanilla, this is followed by mild hazelnut notes. There's definitely a little nutella action going on in the nose. Notes of bourbon pair nicely with the big chocolatey base beer. The taste is very sweet with chocolate, roast, bourbon, and oak all present. The finish is hot and boozy. I'd say that this treatment is quite a bit more smooth than the base beer with a little better melding of flavor. Mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, and mildly carbonated. Overall, I rank this one above Black Tuesday, but below Chocolate Rain and Mocha Wednesday. 671 charactershomebrew311, Feb 18, 2014

Everything is there the hazulnut, the bourbon, oak, dark roasted malts and even some chocolate. Yeah well all those flavor meld perfectly and coat your mouth with liquid happiness. The warmer it gets the more you taste and the more the aromas come through. The booze is there but well hidden for 19%. This is a special one that needs to be seeked out.

Going into this I was intrigued as to how much of a difference/impact some hazelnuts would offer. Very impressed with the result. 
Pours out like black tuesday - dark brown, sits pitch black in the glass. Zero head to speak of, but still a great looking beer. 
After it warms up and aerates the aroma really opens up - nutella milk chocolate, nuttiness, bourbon caramel, sweet vanilla and coconut enhanced by the hazelnut. Definitely some oaky vanilla and bourbon as well. The dark fruits that are so prominent in black tuesday are covered up a bit and overall it's sweeter.
Taste follows the aroma perfectly - very rich and full, lots of creamy barrel notes enhanced by the hazelnut and a really nice boozy bourbon burn. Well rounded, perfectly minimal carbonation and very smooth. 
Fantastic beer - skeptical at first as to how much variation there would be from the base, but it's a great, subtle compliment. 946 characterstimc100, Feb 16, 2014

A: From Pours a pitch black with minimal head which dissipates quickly. A little disappointed with how fast the head disappeared. Appears thick like you would expect Imp Stout.
S: Loads of chocolate and hazel nut. Friend and wife thought chocolate brownie was good description
T: Awesome - boozy brownie with hazel nuts? Really well balanced - chocolate, vanilla, molasses, slight roast, hazel nut, bourbon heat at end. Boozy but alcohol is not over the top apparent. 
O: Impressive. Similar to BT but with hazel nut and felt more holiday. Great for doing taxes (or not doing). Probably the perfect Christmas beer during a Polar Vortex as you sit inside next to the fire forgetting about having to dig your car out of 12" thick ice. 834 charactersabrethanson, Feb 09, 2014

Smells like BT. Tastes like BT with hazelnut and the toffee is more prominent than the regular. I was hoping the hazelnut would shine more as it warmed, but it wasn't much. 
2013 vintage 750 mL bottle poured into wine glass on 23-Feb-14.
Got more hazelnut and it wasn't overpowering. 
Overall, It's no Mocha Wednesday but a nice variant of a solid BBA Imperial Stout. Prefer this slightly more than the regular BT. 512 charactersRollzroyce21, Feb 08, 2014

Full body low carbonation.

A: It's not as dark as you would expect. You see light through it. Similar to CR. Still. No lacing. Tons of alcohol feet. Sticks on the glass.
S: Alcohol. Not getting the hazelnuts on the nose. More sweetness, ala CR. Booze.
T: Very sweet. Dark chocolate. Almost like an after dinner drink.
M: Full bodied. After dinner drink.
Short review, but my thought the overall review of this one will come down. I used to love sweet beers, but this is excessive. I still love their big stouts, this is just a touch too much. 545 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 05, 2014

The aroma has tons of intense bourbon. Alcohol is very obvious in this. Then there's sweet chocolate, vanilla, and then hazelnutes.
The flavor follows with a huge punch of sweet chocolate and then alcohol and bourbon notes. The hints of hazelnut come through towards the middle.
A big delicious beer as the hazelnuts are a enjoyable little addition. Tuesday is still not my favorite base brew. Alcohol comes through at 19.5%, though it isn't as obvious as it could be. 520 charactersdar482, Jan 22, 2014

A - Pours pitch black with a small half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to next to nothing, leaving very small trails of lace on the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of intense sugary sweetness, fresh roasted hazelnuts, bakers chocolate, vanilla, molasses, dark fruits, charred wood and plenty of warming bourbon. All of the aromas I expected are present and it smells just as sweet as I thought it would.
T - Starts off with the intense sweetness - mainly chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits and molasses - quickly being joined by the hazelnuts, charred wood and warming bourbon burn. Finish is really sweet with some mild booze burn, lingering long after the finish.
M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Huge, sweet feel from start to finish makes it hard to consume more than a few ounces in a sitting.
O - A really nice rift on regular Black Tuesday. We drank this one right after a Chocolate Rain and I think I actually prefer that one to this, but only by a small margin. Looking forward to seeing how this one ages over the next few years. 1,142 charactersorangesol, Jan 19, 2014

A - Poured dark brown and settled black with a bunch of sediment in the glass. 
S - Huge bourbon and vanilla notes up front with char and chocolate fudge. Not getting any hazelnut notes. Decadent nose that seems to mirror Black Tuesday.
T - Barrel qualities dominate - bourbon, charred oak and vanilla notes all come to the forefront. A big chocolate fudge presence and a very slight nuttiness comes through. As the beer warmed all the way up to room temperature, the hazelnut became more pronounced but it still wasn't as prominent as I expected.

Smell is rich and boozy. Very malty and slightly nutty with some overt heat.
Sticky and sweet, rich and chewy. The viscous body and sweetness remind me a bit of dwojniak mead, defined by a 1:1 honey to water ratio with a similar double digit abv. Hazelnut is noticeable only in the aftertaste. You can also taste the alcohol. A slow sipper, took my time with it and enjoyed it in small amounts.

S: Strong vanilla, chocolate and alcohol.

Review #300, totally a perfect beer for a milestone like this.
Pours a motor oil, viscous opaque black body with a relatively minimal mocha head that doesn't really have great retention. Not much lacing. Basically looks like Black Tuesday.
Smells phenomenal. Easily the best characteristic of the beer, aside from the vanilla scented wax. Smells like Black Tuesday mixed with a lot of vanilla. I don't get a lot of hazelnut specifically while it is smelling quite nutty; I'm really digging the nutty vanilla on top of the already-sweet Black Tuesday nose.
I think this is way too sweet. So cloying, lots of that Black Tuesday sweetness. It honestly reminds me of a Nutella chocolate bar, if there was a such thing. Its incredibly sweet, very cloying on top of the Black Tuesday base. It gets boozy as it warms up, but initially its simply a very sweet beer without heat.
Full bodied, phenomenal fullness of feeling in the mouth. Carbonation is minimal, solid but nothing to write home about. Again, the whole story is sweet, sweet, sweet. Dark Lord is a bitter IPA compared to this. My palate was pretty much destroyed after drinking my pour and I needed to clean it out with some water and bread. 
Glad to have tried this one; I'm not sure I'd go after this one again but it is incredibly interesting as only the Bruery can do. This gives Dark Lord a run for its money in terms of sweetness. 1,549 charactersStevedore, Nov 27, 2013

A: Dark Brown, minimal head
S: Very alcoholic, some chocolate and nuts
T: Very strong alcohol (obviously), chocolate, nuttiness, very sweet
M: heavy body, almost thick, very little carbonation to break it up, strong alcohol burn
O: Despite how incredibly strong this beer is, it is exactly what I wanted and what I expected with the addition of the hazelnuts, I really quite enjoyed the interplay of the chocolate, hazelnuts and the barrel flavoring. I'll need to try this a few more times to confirm 617 charactersricecracker420, Nov 25, 2013

A dark cola, no head or lace, long skinny legs, looks just like the chocolate rain sitting beside it, again not as dark as one would expect
S more vanilla and a little nuttella and much less fudge that I was loving on the chocolate rain, lots of booze and bourbon
T more of the same really, lots of chocolate, vanilla and bourbon, the hazelnuts fairly mellow
M much like the original and chocolate rain but with a little more heat, syrupy and sticky, faint nutella and coco on the finish 
O not my favorite version, drinks like a liqueur, doesn't quite have what the original and chocolate rain had going for IMO, still great beer but don't get me wrong
by this point in the night I was getting a little buzzed, and my palate was getting fatigued and things were starting to taste the same, well I guess similarities between 3 versions of the same beer should be expected. 969 characterswordemupg, Oct 13, 2013

A: Pours a dark brown color with semi-clear edges. Very minimal tan head forms on the pour and recedes to nothing.
S: Overt alcohol with some dark fruits and a little chocolate. Light nuttiness and cocoa from the hazelnuts.
T: Same as the nose. The nuttiness and the cocoa-like flavors from the hazelnuts are inviting, but the alcohol heat and medicinal flavors that stem from it is quite the turn off. Fair amount of oak and chocolate as well. Sweet caramel.
M: Medium to heavy bodied with a slick and oily mouthfeel. High alcohol heat on the back end.
O: The alcohol was too noticeable and it was just one dimensional in the sweetness. The best part of this beer was the smell of the wax, unfortunately. 770 charactersTreebs, Sep 02, 2013
3.41/5  rDev -22.5%look: 3 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75The beer pours into the tulip glass with no head and no apparent carbonation. The beer is a rich brown color, and is definitely not black like one might expect of an Imperial Stout of this strength. The aroma is hot alcohol at first, but I can actually smell the hazelnut notes quite well from a distance. There is a lot of nuttiness to the nose up front, with supporting notes of chocolate, hints of coffee syrup, and lots of sweet, sugary aromatics. As the beer warms up it almost has a sherry like quality to it (the hazelnuts like accentuate this), still lots of alcohol, and even some cocoa character.&lt;p&gt;
The taste is quite sweet with lots of hazelnut syrup flavors and then towards the finish the expected, expressive, hot alcohol. There is a light carbonation here, more than I was expecting given the appearance. The body is syrupy and thick, but with all the alcohol this is not nearly as thick as one would expect. There is some spice character from the Bourbon in the finish, it helps to dry the finish out just a bit, though not really; flavors of spicy oak, and tongue lingering spiciness are noticeable, but the barrel character is really muted by the alcohol, the sweetness, and the hazelnut flavors that form the dominant notes in this beer.&lt;p&gt;
This is actually pretty good, it is a rich desert beer for sure, and should be drunk in very small amounts. This is nicer than I was expecting, but it still has a bit too much of an alcoholic kick to it; perhaps some extended aging will smooth this out, though I would guess that the hazelnut character might drop out too. 1,597 charactersGueuzedude, Aug 31, 2013

I could immediately smell the hazelnut and booziness right off the bat along with some delicious chocolate notes Flavors of roasted hazelnuts, brown sugar, sticky chocolate, toffee, light molasses and bourbon vanilla. Full bodied, well-carbonated, slightly cloying on the palate, and a boozy finish with some lingering heat throughout.

A: Dark brown but still not quite opaque; almost no head.
S: Cacao, vanilla, and just enormous amounts of caramel...extra sugary sweet; having had Chocolate Rain and Black Tuesday, this is obviously in the same vein as those beers. Plenty of bourbon and oak character, plenty of sweet booze as well. There is a darker fruit component here too that just pushes this over the edge into extraordinary and unique, though I'm having a tough time finding hazelnuts...
T: Lots of rum-soaked raisin character and dark caramel/brown sugar...lots of chocolate, and tons of vanilla and boozy dark fruit. Bourbon and oak barrel are apparent; there is a hint of nutty dryness that can be called hazelnuts, sure, but is not overpowering or even prominent to me - this is just a sweet, sugary, bourbon/vanilla/caramel stout.
MF: Big full body with low carbonation; epitome of sipper, this is akin to a whiskey or port.
O: Really good, though I like Chocolate Rain more. Excellent Black Tuesday variant. 1,120 charactersScotchboy, Jul 22, 2013

A: A surprising 1 finger head; surprising given the size of this beer. The head is somewhat thin and soapy looking, but again, impressive given that this beer is over 19% alcohol. The mocha colored foam recedes after about 30 seconds, leaving a pitch black liquid in the glass. Evident alcohol legs after each swirl. Good looking beer. 
S: Chocolate, dark fruits, and bourbon are the first things that hit my nose. A definite alcohol presence is perceptible. Clean sweetness. There is an indistinct nuttiness on the back end, I couldn't identify that this was aged on hazelnuts specifically, but you can tell some type of nut was used. 
T: Initially, the taste is characteristic Black Tuesday, tons of chocolate, burnt sugar, caramel, and raisins. Also hits with the sweetness you would expect from such a large beer. The hazelnut contribution becomes apparent on the back end. A savory nuttiness hit and provides an interesting wrinkle. Similar to the nose, I don't think I could identify the specific nut variety used in this beer, but can tell that something nutty and savory was added to the Black Tuesday base. 
M: This one is a bit more effervescent than both Chocolate Rain and Black Tuesday. I would call this one moderately carbonated. Thick mouthfeel, full bodied. Alcohol warmth after each swallow. Leaves the palate thick and oily.
O: Really enjoying this sipper, although I must say that I slight prefer Chocolate Rain. I would rank the Black Tuesday variants (that I've had) as follows: 1) Chocolate Rain, 2) Grey Monday, 3) Black Tuesday. The nuts add an interesting new dimension to this beer that I find very intriguing. 1,708 charactersdbc5, Jul 11, 2013

Shared with Rudzud from our Hoarers membership. Even the wax has an awesome candy cake hazelnut like aroma, what the hell!
Pours a light fizzy head, legs galore... wait its just a long line of beer slowly sliding down the side slowly like it has octopus legs that are all tied together, super awesome, pure pitch black color. Looks like pure crude oil.
Nose is great, it's starts with a black Tuesday aroma, dark sweet candy and choc malts, syrupy, chocolate syrup, cocoa, vanilla, bakers choc, double chocolate cookie, plenty of vanilla, lighter bourbon, tons of crazy chocolate overall, bakers and cocoa, lots if dark malts and syrupy goodness. Faint hint of nutty slight hazelnut.
Taste starts sweet and thick, rich dark malts, and booze. Plenty if tingly warming booze, alcohol taste but not overbearing. Tons of cocoa, dark syrupy chocolate, cocoa syrup, bakers choc, etc. Then vanilla, plenty of vanilla, barrel and vanilla iced cream, with light hazelnut nutty flavor. Really thick rich syrup and cocoa vanilla booze, to sum it up. Big thick syrupy aged malt, light bourbon barrel, and faint coconut barrel as well as almond joy like candy bar, but still mostly black Tuesday with very faint hint of hazelnut, and the hazelnut is like a coffee creamer flavoring. Some bitterness from dark malts and hint of earthy hops. Booze is plenty warming and tingly but mostly clean. Finish is full bodied, rich and thick, syrupy sticky sweetness, light booze, lots of vanilla and some cocoa, plenty of barrel, little hazelnut like, some bitterness plenty of booze.
Mouth is full bod, thick syrupy, boozy almost as hell, decent carb.
Overall pretty good, but doesn't really have much over the original Black Tuesday. Yeah the hazelnuts come through a bit, but not as much as I would have hoped and as different as I hoped. That being said, this is still an awesome beer that I would drink again, a sipper for sure though. 1,984 charactersjlindros, Jul 08, 2013

Pours pitch black with minimal lacing and minimal head. Beer is pitch black with thick, oily legs. Par for the course for a Bruery Imperial Stout.
Nose is chocolate, molasses, vanilla, fudge and booze. Aromatic and robust. Decent but a bit too heavy on the alcohol. 
Opens sweet molasses, fudge, chocolate, and vanilla. Diabeetus for sure. Booze in the middle with more chocolate and molasses presence. A bit of cocoa and roasted malt but they do little to balance out the incredible malt body. So incredibly sweet. Great for sipper but I can't imagine having more than 4oz. of this one. Finishes boozy with a sweet, filmy, sticky sweet aftertaste. Decent but certainly over-the-top.
Full bodied with minimal carbonation. Oily, slick and booze in the mouth and goes down hot and sticky sweet. Finishes messy with a lingering, boozy aftertaste. You feel every bit of the ABV here. Definitely a sipper.
Pretty standard for a Bruery Black Tuesday variation. Decently complex, very boozy, in your face, and certainly a sipper. I'd like to see how this mellows out with time but as is, its a bit too much for my taste. Worth trying though. 1,237 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 23, 2013
4.68/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75From 06/19/13 notes. Got this last year being a RS member; been wanting to crack this for a while and opened it with my brother for his 30th birthday. 750ml bottle poured into my Bruery tulip.
a - Pours a jet black color with two to three inches of dark tan head and light to moderate carbonation evident. Looks great.
s - Smells of bourbon, oak, hazlenut, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, sweet dark fruits, toasted malts, and molasses. Initially I found this very sweet and very bourbon forward, but as it warms up a lot more hazelnut and vanilla comes through, improving this quite a bit. Really nice complex nose.
t - Tastes of hazlenut, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, hazlenut coffee, roasted malts, sweet dark fruits, raisins, sugar, and molasses. Taste is a bit sweet again initially but still great to me, as I love bourbon. More vanilla than the nose, and again, the hazlenut comes out as it warms up.
m - Full bodied stout and low carbonation. The body is really thick, smooth, and creamy, and the ABV is very well hidden. Awesome mouthfeel.
o - Overall another fantastic variant of BT. Like most big RIS's, this one improved a lot as it warmed up, allowing more hazlenut and vanilla to come out and mask the molasses/dark fruit sweetness. Still a good amount of bourbon and an awesome mouthfeel; while you know it is a big beer, it doesn't feel lik 19.5% at all. Had no problem finishing 12 oz.'s of it which is scary.
I still prefer Chocolate Rain to this as I think the vanilla beans and cocoa nibs in that beer hide the sweetness of BT a little bit better than the hazlenut did, and I prefer those flavors, but this is another world class beer. I'd rank then CR, GM, and BT last, but you can't go wrong with any of those there, they are all great. 1,772 charactersmdfb79, Jun 20, 2013

Apperance- Can't see through the glass, dark black/brown. Somewhat viscous. Minimal lacing. 
Smell- Booze first and foremost, chocolate, dark fruit then hazelnut. 
Taste- Black Tuesday with minimal Hazelnut, but with a lot of vanilla. Maybe my mouth is not keen on picking up nutty flavor in high abv ba stouts, but I am getting some hazelnut, but not a lot. The reason why I wanted to open this one was to get as much variant as possible before it goes bye bye. 
Mouthfeel- Somewhat viscous for a ba stout. I love the burn that high abv ba stouts get, so I am happy. I know many like to tame the beast down. 
Overall- CR&gt;GM&gt;BT with all being superior beers. Really happy I have another bottle to chill on. 787 charactersgueuzedreg, Jun 10, 2013
4.63/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75First release. Teku glass. I've had this about half a dozen times on draft by now, but this is the first time I've gotten around to writing a review.
A: Pours a dark coffee brown, a little lighter around the edges. Some light brown head which fizzles out quickly to a razor thin ring. No lacing and so-so retention. Looks flat after a few minutes.
S: Hazelnut extract, vanilla and oak, dark chocolate and some nice spice (cinnamon), and a little bourbon.
T: Rich, dark liquid chocolate, hazelnuts, tannic oak, vanilla, with a lengthy finish. Fairly sweet. More sweet and a little boozy than I remember the draft version being (in which the alcohol was completely undetectable). 
M: Mouthcoating, full bodied, with medium-high, sharp carbonation. Sticky.
O: Delicious and decadent. An improvement over both BT and CR. The hazelnuts enhance the base and meld well with the other flavors. The sweetness is probably the limiting factor in terms of drinkability. This is probably best enjoyed in relatively small servings. 1,022 characterspmarlowe, Jun 09, 2013

Pour is medium thickness, dark dark brown. Looks basically pitch black, except for the tiniest hint of light at the absolute edges. Tiny little head, minimal carbonation.
Smell is vanilla and chocolate upfront, with some bourbon heat, booze, hazelnut and oak following. The hazelnut is not as big as I'd hope, and it's a little more boozy/oaky than I'd like.
Taste is much better. Really huge milk chocolate and hazelnut, followed by vanilla, some alcohol heat to cut the sweetness. There's a bit of oakiness at the finish, but it's not as overpowering as in the nose. Slight bitterness, too.
Body is medium thickness, minimal carbonation. Not as thick and chewy as I'd like for a stout like this, but it's certainly not bad.
This is a delicious beer that will lay you flat. It's very sweet, however. I split it three ways, and found the last couple sips to be a little difficult. A good one for sharing. 962 charactersrodkin, May 26, 2013

Smell - Caramel. Lots of bourbon. Some oak but it's a mild barrel character. Tons of sugar.
Taste - Sweet, sugary, bourbon. Just a hint of hazelnut. Not the level of artificial coffee creamer, but a lot of hazelnut. Caramel and some roast, but not much. The more I drink it the more I like it.
Mouthfeel - A bucket of sugar. Sweetness is pretty overwhelming. Just like Black Tuesday.

The Bruery
Placentia, CA
Black, heavy, and viscous throughout. Very, very small film of minimal carbonation. Leaves the glass oily on the way down. Appropriate, and pretty enough, though this beer's appearance is not what makes it special. 
Exceptionally rich aroma: vanilla and very sweet chocolates, lots of barrel (coconut, stinging bourbon, Mounds bars), and a distinct, integrated, lovely, and sweet hazelnut addition. The base beer (Black Tuesday) is quite present, obviously, but the addition of hazelnuts is a welcome one that works.
As with Black Tuesday, this is sweet, rich, chocolate, and barrel-forward. This does seem a bit more subdued though and slightly less raw and aggressive than regular Black Tuesday, with distinct, authentic, flavorful hazelnut present, especially on the swallow and lingering finish. Some alcohol heat, but not quite as strong as regular Black Tuesday.
Full in body with low, creamy, silky carbonation.
Fantastic Black Tuesday variant. 
Additionally, the wax smells of hazelnuts. 1,041 charactersehammond1, Apr 21, 2013

Also much milder than plain ol’ Black Tuesday. Not a whole lot of nuttiness to me, but it is somewhat creamy and smooth compared to BT. Nice beer. 426 charactersillidurit, Apr 01, 2013

The beer pours a deep, jet black color, very inky and sludge-like out of the bottle, a trace of caramel brown film appears on top of the beer but is gone immediately, no lacing to speak of. The aroma is intensely sweet, lots of milk chocolate, hazelnut, brown sugar, marshmallow with a pungent bourbon alcohol heat at the finish. The flavors are in line, massively sweet and borderline cloying. Lots of chocolate, brown sugar, marshmallow and a good amount of hazelnut character. It's really hard to tell that this was even aged in bourbon as it has almost zero noticeable barrel character and lacks any decent richness and complexity. Vanilla was the only detectable barrel note which was a huge loss for me. The body on this beer is nearly perfect, luscious, silky, rich, any adjective you can find for smooth and creamy but finishes a bit harshly because of the high alcohol content.
Verdict: An ambitious stout from the Bruery. I like the creativity with the hazelnut addition but the fact that this beer is so one dimensionally sweet and intensely rich makes it really hard to drink more than just a few ounces. I struggled to finish only 3oz. 1,237 characterskevanb, Mar 18, 2013

The smell is quite sweet and a bit hot with roast and some dark fruit. The nose doesn't quite live up to the wax. The taste is also rather sweet.

S. Vanilla, chocolate, ripe dark fruit, lots of hazelnut, some fusile alcohol notes. This is really really nice. 
T. Wow. This is so mellow considering the heat. Thick fudge, brownie batter, prominent vanilla, mild hazelnut, mild bourbon, overripe fruit. Amazing. 
M. Cloying, coating. Low carbonation, excellent balance, sits nicely on the palate. 
O. Wow. We had a Black Tuesday before this and it didn't do much for me but this is so shockingly different I can barely believe it is the same base beer. I don't get a ton of hazelnut, just some subtle notes in the background that even it out. Whatever was done differently here really balanced this out. Drinks like a liquid Heath bar. One of the best things I have had, albeit extremely sweet. 913 characterssiege06nd, Mar 10, 2013

4.82/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Big thanks to Ron, Tim, and Mike for letting me partake in this bottle, even though I would've been contempt just sitting there smelling the wax. This one pours nearly black with a very small and menacing tan head that is reduced to a ring pretty quickly. Seemingly low carbonation, this one looks very thick and syrupy on the pour - I would expect nothing less from this 19.5% ABV beast.
And whoof... the aroma washes over my senses like a goddamn tidal wave. Chocolate, both dark and milky, smooth bourbon, sweet vanilla, roasted hazelnuts. Much like it's counterpart, Chocolate Rain, this beer has such an intoxicating and powerful aroma that demands attention. One thing I like about Grey Monday, however, is that the sweetness does seem nearly as cloying.
But don't get me wrong - the sweetness is still there on the nose. Brown sugar, thick molasses, melted fudge; it just appears to be a bit more settled in and refined. Another thing I love about Grey Monday is that the bourbon aroma is so smooth; not harsh or burning the nostrils at all. This is an amazingly crafted beer, and I haven't even brought the thing to my lips yet.
And just like Chocolate Rain, Grey Monday hits the palate and injects an intense sweetness throughout your entire nervous system. But just as the aroma indicated, tasting has confirmed - the sweetness of Grey Monday is controlled so much better than it was in Chocolate Rain. It's the "super sweet but still manageable" sweetness, and it's perfect. 
The flavors explode like a fucking bomb on my palate: vanilla, hazelnut, light cocoa, bourbon, oak and wood. Chocolate Rain felt like 19.5% ABV. Grey Monday does not. It's got that heavy warmth - but the bourbon is so smooth and even "soft", and it goes down like a dream. I've loving the balance of boozy and sweet; they play off of each other perfectly.
I love the hazelnut addition - not only because I love hazelnuts, but because it was done masterfully. It was subtle enough as to not wash any other flavors out (see: Frangelic Mountain Brown), but at the same time - it was noticeable and appreciated with each and every sip. 
As the beer warms up, new flavors emerge and current ones get stronger. Nutty, smooth, boozy, and sweet all at once. There is a certain harmony between all of these things - a detailed system of checks and balances. The aftertaste is a collection of hazelnut, cocoa, sweet vanilla, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, and dense oak. Nice, creamy body with a slick mouth feel, surprisingly not as sticky as you'd expect. 
I didn't want this one to end. I liked Chocolate Rain, but I said that it would have potential to be a world beater if the sweetness and the booze were toned down. Alas - Grey Monday accomplishes those exact things, and the cost of lost cocoa nibs and vanilla beans is more than made up for with an excellent hazelnut addition. Thanks again to Ron, Tim, and Mike for this world class beer. Don't forget to smell the fucking wax. 2,969 characterstectactoe, Mar 03, 2013

poured into snifter glass.
reviewed from notes taken on 02/23/2013.
Appearance: black bodied with thin white cap. When the cap fades away the beer has a bit of an oily film on the top of the beer and no head.
Smell: Hazelnuts and peanut butter. Some faint coffee. Boozey nose, but not distracting and you gotta expect that from a beer this big. 
Taste: Sweet hazelnuts and cocoa. Nutty and roasty. Hint of bourbon and faint coffee. The flavors are so well balanced and integrated in this beer. Really just spectacular complexity.
Mouthfeel: full bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. This beer really hides its ABV. Yeah there is a little bit of heat, but nothing much when considering the almost 20% ABV of grey monday. How does the Bruery hide the ABV so flawlessly in these massive beers? Its gotta be thier calling card, I really cant think of any brewery that does this better.
Overall: Fantastic Black Friday varient. It really exceeded my expectations. I didnt think that I would like this beer more than Chocolate Rain, but I do and it did. 1,125 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Feb 26, 2013

Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, bourbon, and a very slight hazelnut scent. Taste is much the same with a sweet cocoa flavor and an alcohol kick on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer but it's very sweet and strong. 655 charactersUCLABrewN84, Feb 25, 2013

Faint coffee, hazelnuts. Boozy but not overdone, even for 18+%abv.
Follows the nose, sweet on the backend. Groupthink suggests "peanut butter". Dangerously drinkable.
Medium thick mouthfeel. Low but great mouthfeel.
Well, I put A LOT trading into for this bottle and right now it's paying off. In a tasting where we've already had Rare, FFF brandy vanilla DL, FFF PvW DL, etc, this stands up! 560 charactersDuff27, Feb 24, 2013

A - Dark brown with small cocoa head that faded quickly. Lots of carbonation. Really a thick body that coats the glass. It looks a bit like syrup
S - Get hints of hazelnuts, slight oak and vanilla. There is a ton of sweet bourbon in it as well that makes up the main nose profile. It has sweet caramel and also a strong boozy presence
T - This is one sweet and boozy beer. There is sweet chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, brown sugar, and cream. The hazelnuts make themselves known near the end with just a slight hazelnut presence. The bourbon and its booziness makes itself known in the taste as it did on the nose. This alcohol presence remains in the finish as well as a slight oak
MF - Thick, sticky and syrupy beer that coats the tongue. It also leaves a thick coating on the tongue in the finish. The finish is astrigent from the oak and the booziness.
O - Like Black Tuesday, this is a sweet beer. The hazelnuts add a slight twist with the nutty hazelnut presence. However, there isn't as much hazelnut as I'd like as it's just a small presence instead of making a strong presence. Out of this, CR and BT, I preferred this over BT but liked CR more. 1,226 charactersjeonseh, Feb 23, 2013

S: In the front, there is very strong chocolate. The aroma transitions to a sweet bourbon flavor at the end. Almost identical to the nose of Black Tuesday
T: while there are simalarities to Black Tuesday, this is a different beast. Bourbon and chocolate are up front but there is the hazelnut flavors that meld these flavors perfectly. There is an alcohol bite that comes up at the end.
M: Heavy heavy body with a suprising amount of carbonation given the ABV.
O: Amazing beer. Better then both Chocolate Rain and Black Tuesday. 582 charactersjvillefan, Feb 23, 2013

Big thanks to Hagedorn for this gem!
Opened tonight, well just because. Nice start to beer week. 
The lady and I have split choco rain, and blak Tuesday twice, we'll see I we can handle this.
Split into 2 bruery snifters. Bottle bubbled up a little bit, funny enough a bottle of bt 11 at a tasting last weekend bubbled up huge (but still tasted great!)
A- well this is very much like its brothers. Just as expected, super dark with a thin dark head
S- upon opening it was huge! Frangelico liquor immediately comes to mind, which is t a bad thing per sa but not the direction I was hoping. Maybe this is going to be invariably sweet. In the glass it is actually quite muted at first, maybe the killer aroma was all in te bubbling up? However it slowly opens up and starts showing its splendor. Right up front more like CR than BT, chocolate sweetness upfront and mild alluring hazelnut all over. Its subtle and very nice. Part of the reason in cracking it is exactly for this.
T- big but this is expect. At first it was very very strong, I actually had thought that there was no way we'd get through this. Much more boxier than cr and bt...initially. Halfway down the glass and second glass it's a completely different story. Huge chocolate upfront and that great hazelnut flavor in the mix work very well together. Surprisingly not overly sweet as initial expecting (though it must be mentioned I do particularly like sweetness in beers). Chocolate with bits of hazelnut , the hazel is very subtle and not over bearing. I'm halfway through my second glass and in loving every sip.
M- surprisingly high carbonation for a beer this size. On the thicker side of course but if you've had bt and cr this is very much like em. At first the booze was overbearing and dissapointing but like I mentioned earlier that didn't last long. It's nicely integrated in the beer.
O- I'm lovin this stuff. Not as much hazelnut as I would have liked but it delivers in all departments. This feels like a variation of CR than a variation of Bt if that makes any sense. I'd love to try this side by side with em, and plan too some time in the future. I had bt and cr side by side last weekend and know for sure cr is my favorite. This one lands slightly behind cr.
Cr last week was fantastic even with some age and I have a strong feeling this one will be the same. I partly joined the rs this year for this beer and am glad it delivers.
However if your after on of these bad boys, while this one is great, go after a CR instead. 2,585 charactersKevSal, Feb 02, 2013

Bottle into a Bruery snifter. Nice looking bottle.
A: Very dark, though not quite black. It seems black but there's some brownish red near the edges. The beige head is robust upon the initial hard pour, rising two fingers above the liquid. A swirl of the glass gives indication of the high ABV as there's a thick alcohol collar that devolves into a cascading string of pearls
S: This smells like Black Tuesday with the addition of hazelnuts, as you might have guessed, so if Black Tuesday isn't your thing you're not going to like this. It's super sweet and desert-like with tons of vanilla, hazelnut, maple, coconut, and bourbon. Mounds of diabetes inducing brown sugar and chocolate blend with alcohol, oak, and toffee. Dark fruit is restrained and redolent of grape and plum
T: Oak, bourbon, vanilla, hazelnuts, brown sugar, and maple. Very sugary and sweet, but you were expecting that. Alcohol provides much warming but little flavor. Dark chocolate is rich and pervasive and it blends with molasses and toffee. The finish is very rich.
M: Full body with upper low carbonation. The mouthfeel is silky, chewy, and sticky with much warming on the palate (palatial warming, henceforth).
Overall: Over the top in the sweetness category, but I was expecting this. I'm not doing a side by side with Black Tuesday at the moment, but this seems much more sugary sweet than Black Tuesday (if you can imagine that), to the point that 4oz would be an appropriate serving size. That being said, my fiance and I will be drinking this whole bottle and loving it. This is very nice, but I hope it doesn't interfere with my personal dreams of the Iced and Coffee Black Tuesday variants. Props to SR for a great idea. 1,722 charactersHopHead84, Jan 13, 2013

On Tap at the Bruery Tasting Room
Served in a taster glass
Had this beer Tuesday October 30th at the Bruery Black Tuesday release party
A: Pours black as night, with only a slight brown head. Only minimal effervescence. Pronounced alcohol legs are visible. Unofficial ABV communicated by the tasting room staff was 19.5%. Yikes!
S: There is a strong boozy bourbon smell to this beer. Multiple smells presented vanilla and some nondescript nut aromas. 
T: Milk chocolate and bourbon are the dominate flavors of this big sweet stout. It might have been me but I did not taste the hazelnut flavors, but only a slight nuttiness. This could have been a result of the food I was eating at the time. Surprisingly there was no alcohol burn on the finish. Only a lingering milk chocolate aftertaste. With all of the flavor additions it is very evident that the base of this beer is Black Tuesday.
M: This beer has a different mouthfeel than the 2012 Black Tuesday which was tasted before this beer. While not quite as thick, Grey Monday coats the palate with a oily sheen. Not a bad effect, but would limit the amount of this beer one could tolerate in one sitting.
O: This beer did not taste how I had anticipated. I was expecting Black Tuesday with Nutella stirred in. While Grey Monday is a great variant of Black Tuesday there are others that I personally like better (Chocolate Rain). Overall, I would recommend trying this beer, you wont be let down. 1,466 charactersPsyko, Nov 04, 2012

A- Deep, dark black color. No real head but has a small ring of tan bubbles along the edge of the glass. 
S- Has a strong port-like smell. Little bit of alcohol. Chocolate and hazelnuts. 
T- Port again. Some alcohol. Has a great hazelnut taste throughout, and with the chocolate is almost like nutella. Sweet and malty. 
M- Full bodies and delicious. No carbonation to speak of. Finishes very sweet. 
O- Amazing. The alcohol is well hidden and I liked that it was a cask served beer. Really smoothed things out and made for an easy drinking (despite the high ABV) desert-like beer.  656 charactersHands22, Oct 19, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -4.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On cask at Beachwood I, 6 oz., I'm putting the ABV at 18.2% since I don't know what the ABV of 2011 Black Tuesday is yet, I'll change it if necessary, this is Black Tuesday with Hazelnuts,
A: Pours the deepest black with a minimal tan head, fair retention, no lace.
S: Dark chocolate, like an amaretto cream truffle, some roast.
T: Sweet hazelnut nectar and chocolate. The nuttiness is much more overt than I thought it would be, but it certainly works here. A nice take on Black Tuesday.
M: Beyond full-bodied as BT tends to be. Very smooth, minimal carbonation which suits it fine. Trace amounts of booze which is impressive in a beer this big.
O: For my palate, better than Chocolate Rain as a Black Tuesday variation. Apparently they had this at The Bruery Molecular Dinner at Beachwood and had some left over so the layman off the street got try some. Well worth the chance. 884 charactersHalcyondays, Oct 18, 2011
