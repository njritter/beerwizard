Pours a fairly hazy, lemonade-yellow with a finger of soft white head that streaks the glass.  Aroma is not overpowering, but has some excellent tropical fruit in there.  The taste of this beer is just fantastic... so, so drinkable.  It's super balanced and approachable.  Mouth feel is about perfect for the ABV.  Overall, I hope we see this regularly here in VT. 399 charactersFFreak, Apr 11, 2017

And while there is some age resulting in a decline in the initial yumminess it is till an enjoyable drink. I'll rate it based on my impressions of when it was fresher.  
A fantastic hop aroma and taste with the lightness of fresh hops and yet the pleasing quality of anything fresh from the garden.  Smooth and pleasing.  Malt very much in the background and largely playing a supportive role and in this case providing a fuller feel.   Enough bitterness to be sure it's a hop forward beer but always blending.
Somewhat cloudy and very pale in color.  Head is smallish and settles out in time.  
This was the best fresh hop beer of the fall of 2016 that I had. 747 charactersgarymuchow, Mar 02, 2017

I live in the Midwest, but visit east coast a lot and have tried quite a few of the east coast IPA's. This beer comes as close to Treehouse Julius as any I've had outside of the East Coast. Very heavy on tropical flavors and has the same golden orange hazy color. This is definitely one of my favorite Pale ales. Wish it was available all the time and easier to get. 440 charactersSymmetryDave, Feb 13, 2017

A: Very hazy to turbid, but bright gold. A thin band of white foam serves as a head, over fairly low visible carbonation.
S: Nice here for sure. Tropical, citrus, juicy melon, dank. Notes of stone fruit and grassiness as well. Malt aroma is nearly absent - only very light cracker sweetness from the two-row malts.
T: Follows the nose. Juicy tropical fruits, dank, and tangelos. Grapefruit rind, melons, and pineapple. Light cracker malts again. More tropical fruit juiciness and bitterness in the hang.
M: A heavier body than a lot of APAs, but far from thick. Low alcohol presence and good carbonation sensation.
O: A really, really enjoyable beer. And it was just as good, if not better, from the bottle. Lagunitas nails it with another excellent, well-made, widely distributed hoppy beer. 958 charactersmacrosmatic, Feb 10, 2017

Originally noted 11/05/15
Finally I was born yesterday…
Pours brightly into a golden pale-yellow body with a considerable amount of hopped chill haze to distort the appearance.  A foamy snow white head gathers over top and makes a mess of my glass on the drink down.  The nose is bursting with a litany of hop aromas.  Mandarin orange with grapefruit, tropical flower, sweet pine, and hempy herbs stand out.  I get some sweet bready malt action underneath the waves of fresh hops with a slight of caramel likeness to it.  Flavor doesn’t let up as well.  Uber fresh hop botanicals.  Citrus zest of orange, lemon, and grapefruit meet some wild tropical and a hit of dank pine. Light sweet pale malt support there with some mildly noticeable alcohol and a few fruity esters.  Shifts into a scouring herbal bitterness that flourishes midstream and carries on into a dry lasting finish with some resinous lingering hop oils.  Solid solid solid. 987 charactersNugganooch, Jan 19, 2017

Unfiltered is an understatement. The haze is as thick as the smoke from a California blaze and San Francisco marine layer fighting over how low the visibility is during a blizzard. Murky, in a word. Pale-ish orangey-yellow color,  1F white cap that retains but leaves minimal spot lacing. Attractive.
All the citrus and tropical fruit aroma I can ask for. Lots of sweet pine sap right out of my very own Jersey Pine Barrens. 
Pine forward flavor, light malts, citrus hops.
Great feel, the body is ...good and drinkable. Hoppy, tangy, and fresh. Palate puckering which opens the door to the next sip. Just bitter enough.
The bottle reads "Borned 10/17/16", I'm drinking it on 12/31/16. It looks, smells, tastes, and most importantly, drinks like it was Born Yesterday! 807 charactersNiceTaps, Jan 01, 2017

I am a big fan of 95% of their beers but this one is excellent.  Pours a light straw hazy yellow, carb is medium, light fluffy head.  Aroma is amazing - big pineapple/mango tropical smell.  Taste is light, hoppy, slightly sweet and perfectly balanced.  No alcohol heat, 7% abv is smartly masked.   Can't say enough about this one.  Definitely give it try if you can find it. 446 charactersMeanMotaScootah, Dec 24, 2016

Pours cloudy gold with plenty of white head and lacing. Aromatics lead off quite dank and fruity. Tropical citrus with weed. Peach, mango, grapefruit, and wet cat. Light to medium bodied with a creamy and crisp mouthfeel. Ripe, juicy citrus on the palate with low bitterness and zero malt. Finishes with lingering hoppy citrus and dry.
Great beer. Juicy enough to pass off as a NEIPA. 414 charactersbrewandbbq, Dec 01, 2016

Slightly off-white, tall, bubbly head, receding slowly leaving a sticky lacing. Strong, citrus & piney aroma. Dominate hop flavor, citrus, pine. Mouth feel is somewhat thin. Malts are there, but definitely under the strong hop flavor, aroma, and bittering. Bittering asserts in the middle and remains very, very strong in the aftertaste. A very good, hoppy, pale ale (in reality, an IPA, though, to be honest). The fresh hop aroma is there, and the hop flavor is there, but it is a very bitter beer. Not exactly my preferred taste profile, but not bad for a macro brewer! ;-) 639 charactersMNAle, Nov 29, 2016

Hazy orange, copper, gold. 
Smell is a fantastic - citrusy fresh pale ale.

Fabulous beer.  One of the top hop forward beers made.   Listed as an APA, at 7% I'd put this in IPA territory.
A veritable fruit cocktail of flavors and aromas.  Tropical notes are forefront....mango, pineapple, papaya...also tangerines, oranges, and nectarines...
Malt bill is light and lets all this fresh fruit shine.
Lacks any catty, oniony, garlic notes.  I love beers that avoid those notes and this does that in spectacular fashion.
I've reviewed closed to 1500 beers now over 15 years on this site and it takes something special to get me excited.   This one does that. 669 charactersZAP, Nov 24, 2016
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a slightly hazy orange with average carbonation. the aroma, apparent as soon as the beer is opened, offers huge fresh grapefruit, tangerine, guava, passionfruit and pineapple. The flavor offers a load of grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, bright resin, and some very light cracker malts. The mouthfeel is very light and foamy. Overall this is a spectacular fresh hops beer - the aroma and flavor are just so dominating, with huge citrus and tropical flavors, with just enough bitterness to balance the enormous fruit flavors. 540 charactersCzequershuus, Nov 24, 2016

About a finger of white foam on top. Strong tropical fruit on the nose - lots of mango, pineapple, and citrus. The look and aroma of this beer have me wondering if this will be THE one. Aaand nah...lots of sweet citrus and mango on the taste followed by a decent hop bite that lingers on the palate. Good balance here between hop bitterness and sweet fruit. The feel, I felt, could have been a bit thicker. Not really watery but it is a tad thin for me to really say it's awesome.
Looked and smelled better than it tasted. It still tastes great, though. Definitely a solid beer. I'd love to have it in a can. 724 charactersdo_ob, Nov 22, 2016

A - an orange copper sunset with a half finger off-white head and some sugar lacing/legs, 
S - dank, sugar, lots of citrus, lots of sweet hops, California yeast, pineapple, tropical/island fruits and flowers, super hoppy and a really nice sweet and dry Malts/grains. 
T - super fresh, very dank, lots of citrus, pine, pineapple, mango, citrus flowers, cracker yeast, clean water, nice rich sugar and lots of sweet and dry Malts/grains and even more dank sweet and bitter hops.
M - medium body, great balance, awesome complexity, medium carbonation, medium acidity and a huge sweet and danky hop finish 
D/O - You can taste the refreshment in this one, wow. It's crisp, clean, dank, hoppy and a nice malt to balance it out. Just a well done and super fresh ale and one of the best IPA/APA I have ever had. Lagunitas does it over and over again -- what else can you ask for?
Final thoughts - the price is high at $12.99 a six pack but, it was made on the 17th and arrived on the 18th, incredible. The ABV is perfect at 7%. Drink fresh and don't save or age. 1,127 characterswhatthehull, Nov 20, 2016

S - biiig tangerine, peach, orange juice, citrus pith, lemon/lime, papaya, like dipping your nose in the orange/pineapple juice you were drinking for breakfast. Little bit of dank hop resin, ganja, but very mild (it is a "pale ale") 
T - big tangerine, orange, peach, citrus pith, pear, papaya, passion fruit. Tiny bit of dank hop resin and ganja. Mild bready malts.
M - light mouthfeel (but heavy hops if that makes sense), alc completely covered at 7 percent, aftertaste is fresh hops ( no shit ) 
O - the best wet hop pale ale (or ipa) that exists, one of the best pale ales that exists. Right on par with Trillium pale ales, in between Trillium IPAs and TH IPAs. Awesome beer. 769 charactersHopHunter19, Nov 19, 2016

Poured into a snifter, the appearance is golden and hazy with a nice two finger head.
Smell is unbelievable...outstanding...very hoppy and dank. Smells like chronic juice ;-)
Taste is just like the smell, very dank and resinous. Best tasting beer I can remember.
Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced, just the right amount of carbonation, goes down smooth...the 7% is masked very well.
Overall this is a top notch example of a fresh hop ale. I've been drinking this for the past two weeks but reviewing this even at four weeks old (born on date of 10/17/16) this beer is top notch all around. I cant believe a brewer with this much national reach was able to produce such a fresh and lasting beer...all breweries out there need to take note. Well done Lagunitas!! 930 charactersPeterock27, Nov 16, 2016

S: HOLY PINE with some honey and citrus hanging around
T: Marvelously flavorful grapefruit and pepper, backed up by light malt sweetness
F: Quite resinous and sticky, with prickly acid as well
O: This is really a phenomenal beer. I'm not quite sure it's correct to call it an APA, but whatever it is, it's excellent. And remember folks, the point is the freshness, so snap it up when you see it, and drink eagerly. 501 charactersLJSchoppert, Nov 16, 2016

T: Starts off with the citrus, lots of grapefruit and orange notes, followed by some herbal and grassy notes once the citrus burst fades. Some light sweetness from the maltiness, but the hops are the show. Finishes with lingering citrus and light bitterness
M: Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation
O: A very good fresh hop APA/IPA that is packed with hops. Very drinkable and obviously best as fresh as possible. Definitely look out for this one 655 charactersBEERMILER12, Nov 15, 2016

What the hell are we rating around  here these days? I'm looking for a little more complexity  and beer in my beer. Drank one 11/13 not that old, no excuses. I know don't like Mosaic, Equinox or Citra hops but last year's was alot better. Once again proud to have the lowest rating. 547 charactersRacerX5k, Nov 13, 2016

Aromas of juicy citrus overtones, heavy on orange and tangerine, with some hints of lemon and grapefruit, also. Flavors are all citrus forward, and very juicy, with the orange and tangerine hitting first. Juicy sweet, with a solid acidity, the beer has only subtle hints of grassy bitterness. Smooth and dry feel, with a citrus sweet aftertaste. The orange juice profile lingers shortly past the dry, crisp, and slightly acidic finish. Good beer. 573 charactersGarthDanielson, Nov 12, 2016

A: Hazy pale yellow with 2-finger off-white foamy head with decent retention and several craggy lines of sticky lacing.
S: Pineapple, mango, and grassy/haylike aromas with some lemon-lime and grapefruit aromas with milder folral and honeysuckle notes.  No real malt or alcohol aroma presences.
T: Flavor is intensely hoppy with candylike lemon-lime and candied mango and pineapple flavors that are well-integrated. Pale maltiness is crackery. There are more herbal and resiney flavors in the finish. NO alcohol or yeast character. Delicious with moderate bitterness at most.
M: Light bodied and very dry with slightly tacky/sticky coating feel.
O: Another winner from Lagunitas with a lot of hop intensity without a lot of bitterness. 833 charactersargock, Nov 10, 2016

S: A big, striking aroma of a lot of hops, citrus, malt, and a dank quality. Evident the moment you open the bottle.
T: Tasted of a lot different tropical fruits, namely mango, passion fruit, and pineapple; also had citrus (orange, in particular), a good amount of dank resinous quality, light malt, and some peach. For an APA, this is a massive, complex flavor. Very fruity, well balanced and yummy.
F: A good shot of carbonation with a somewhat slick finish. Light- to medium-bodied.
O: Born yesterday probably has more in common with an IPA than an APA, but that doesn't matter. It's a big, brash, flavorful beer. Incredibly drinkable. 828 charactersavalon07, Nov 06, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review for 2016 vintage.
Pours a hazy opaque yellow golden color. Frothy white head dissipates steadily leaving some nice sticky lacing and residual head. 
Smell is a pungent aroma of mango, peach, citrus, and a fresh green hop aroma. Touch of freshly cut grass is also there, but more complimentary. 
Taste follows that aroma and provides the exact flavors you'd expect. Mango, peach, citrus, and orange. Notes of pineapple, a mild dankness and some green hop and grass flavors come through. Although very hop forward, there is a noticeable biscuit malt backbone. The fresh hops just punch you in the tastebuds in the best way possible. 
Feel is perfect. Medium carbonation, smooth and easy drinking, yet really full bodied. 
Overall this might be Lagunitas' best beer ever. They really nailed it with this year's version. Unfiltered, hazy, pungent and refreshing. I could drink this one all day everyday. I had two six packs just to be sure I wasn't over rating this one, and after going through them all I enjoyed the last one as much as the first one. Just a world class beer here. 1,090 charactersFBarber, Nov 05, 2016
4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Look: Pours a very hazy, cloudy yellow color with a two finger, fastly disappearing satin white head of foam that laces the glass extremely well.
Aroma: Huge. Gigantic nose of dank, musky, apricots, guava, pink grapefruits, orange rind, lemon zest and mango. Absolutely intoxicating.
Flavor: Hmm... interesting. Biscuity and slightly malty upfront with notes of vanilla and coconut cream. Theres a profoundly dank and tropical hop profile of pineapple juice, mango, apricot and papaya midpalate that finishes bittersweet with resinous undertones of lemon rind and orange sherbert. A little too tropical for my taste, but a damn fine beer.
Feel: Medium bodied with low carbonation. Alcohol profile is non existent. Tropically sweet with a dry, zesty finish.
Overall: Not my favorite from Lagunitas but I'll give credit where credit is due and give this an A+. A Very tropical and dank, fruity ipa with flavors of pineapple, mango, apricots, grapefruit and guava. Starts off with a nice biscuity malt flavor upfront and ends on a dry, resinous, orange rind finish with the taste of every citrus fruit under the sun in between. 1,128 charactersBloodSoakedAleMug, Nov 05, 2016

A: Poured a yellow, fresh squeezed orange juice type of look. Little head and this was poured into a tulip glass.
S: Mango, peach, pineapple, guava, lime, apple, strawberries, bubble gum.
T: Exactly like the nose; however towards the backend a little bit of roast, a definite breadiness.
M: Medium body, almost bubble gum type of feeling, hits so many aspects of your tongue with the sweetness, a subtle tart and roastiness. Nicely Carbonated..
O: I hate you Lagunitas, I genuinely hate you. I live in Azusa where your new brewery is going and the fact I used to drive 8 hrs to Russian River and a miserable 6hr flight, staying with my in-laws in Stowe for Heady.. all those hours to taste a perfect ipa, and you come and spoil us with this easy to obtain liquid gold. I hate your other beers, but you've earned a 5 from me. This is a perfect West Coast IPA with a massive amount of Simcoe.

The appearance is a hazy opaque gold with a nice frothy head that lingered well.
The aroma is big juicy grapefruit, peach, mango, and dank resin notes. It just explodes out of the glass. Crazy juicy zesty hop notes.
The tastes are huge juicy citrus, grapefruit, peach, mango and big resiny dankness that mix together well.
The palate is medium plus with a nice creamy finish that lingers well with a nice resiny bitterness.
Overall this is an excellent pale ale that I would buy a case of if I had the funds. A new England ipa from a west coast brewery that has a big juicy resin dankness that lingers well. 688 charactersBartleby91, Nov 05, 2016

Appearance - straw yellow/gold, hazy with nice sediment floating in the glass, along with some large carbonation bubbles. Head is a towering white scoop of vanilla ice cream. Lacing is strong!
Smell - wonderful sweet, juicy tangerine, peach and grapefruit; absolutely mouth watering!
Taste - provides the sweet and juicy fruit flavors that are present in the nose, with just enough pale malt support to keep this from being an outright hop explosion!
Feel - even with the pale malts, this has to be classified as an IPA. The juicy bitterness is absolutely front and center!
Overall - I've had a few APA's lately, that to me, should be classified as IPA's. If this truly fits the characteristics of an APA, then it is one of my favorites without question! 832 charactersDenverHopHead, Nov 04, 2016

Smell is intensely hoppy with big citrus waves. Taste is spectacular, nice maltiness but blown away by tons of hops, herbal with notes reminiscent of tangerine. Good bitterness in the back. Overall quite juicy.
Awesome beer, nice body sitting in IPA territory (I would not call this a Pale Ale). Do try this fresh ASAP! 404 charactersBranfordBound, Nov 04, 2016

Probally one of the most juiciest IPAs that I have ever had. Resembling very much so in the New England style of IPAs and perferfectley executed on a national scale. This beer is one for the books. The very first NE style IPA(or Pale Ale) to be distributed nationally and be sucessfull. It's truley amazing when you think about it. It's a tropical juice bomb, full in both the aromas and taste of mangoes, pinapple, herb, dankness and fruit juice. The unfiltered body adds a very hazy orange apperacne and creamy mouthfeel. I cant prasier this beer enough, a truley awesome brew!

Smell is mango, papaya, guava, tangerine, pine, and subtle grapefruit. 
Taste follows loads of fresh citrus, tangerine, mango, passion fruit, guava,  some pine, and a little hit of grapefruit in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is at least medium, plenty of prickly carbonation, maybe a little dry, and excellent drinkability. 
Overall this is a very nice IPA, so tropical with enough carbonation to hold my attention. Lagunitas quality and price is unmatched. 633 charactersSawDog505, Nov 02, 2016
4.54/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52016 unfiltered addition.
Pours a hazy, golden orange color with a solid finger of white head. The head dissipates quickly but settles into a nice halo around the glass. Leaves minimal lacing.
The aroma is earthy, resinous and dank. There's a good amount of citrus as well as tropical fruits, followed by a subtly sweet cracker malt backbone. The mosaic and simcoe really stand out here.
The taste is far more citrusy with notes of orange, tangerine and subtle grapefruit pith. There are also some sweet mango notes, followed by peach and pineapple. Not much malt but it's present.
The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Incredibly smooth and creamy. Finishes with some lingering bitterness. Basically a perfect mouthfeel.
Overall, a fantastic beer that is basically an IPA. The hops really shine here and bring out lots of flavors. Not too balanced but the malt provides a more subtle backbone that is more than welcomed in this fresh hop ale. Excellent beer. 984 charactersScaryEd, Nov 02, 2016

L: Hazy, opaque, just slightly translucent, glowing golden orange color, topped with a foamy, creamy off white head.  Retention is mediocre, but there is lacing left behind.
S: It's dank, green, herbaceous, resinous.  Grass, green onion, marijuana, pine, kale, and spinach.  Just green, raw hops.  Behind all that, it is quite juicy and tropical.  Sweet tangerines, yellow grapefruit, grapefruit peel, mango, papaya, and pineapple.  There is a little bit of biscuity, bready malt, but the hops dominate.
T: Wow, the taste is more fruity and less herbaceous than the nose would indicate.  Orange marmalade, red grapefruit, grapefruit peel, and orange zest.  As it transitions toward the mid-palate, the fruits become more sweet and tropical.  There's yellow peach, mango, papaya, and pineapple.  Hints of toasted bread in the middle, but more as a backbone and not excessive.  Finishes with a smack of green hoppiness, more cannabis, onion, grass, and pine, which leaves a lingering aftertaste of orange juice and grapefruit peel.
F: Nice medium to medium-plus mouthfeel, smooth, well-rounded, slightly creamy, moderate carbonation.
O: Holy crap, the hype is real!  This is without doubt the best hoppy Lagunitas beer, in my honest opinion. 1,289 charactersHorseheadsHopHead, Nov 02, 2016

3.78/5  rDev -14.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.75Pours along the lines of the current unfiltered haze trend. Aroma is mostly dry mosaic & simcoe hop cone with a minor citrus flourish.  Taste is along the same lines - I've always gotten lots of chalk / grass flavors from the mosaic & simcoe tag-team, and this beer is no different. Not enough of the citra / tropical flavors to balance it out.  A good beer but I'll take the Stone "Enjoy By" line-up when it comes to the big craft label fresh hops game. 454 charactersajm5108, Nov 01, 2016

Appearance-  pours a real cloudy straw like color. frothy head that leaves decent lacing.  kinda reminds me of a huma but lighter in color.  looks like a basic (but good) wheat beer. 
Aroma- smells like mosaic hops. orange and pine with some slight grapefruit.  really solid. maybe some slight grass notes.
Taste- just like it smells. hops are the showcase. when I thought how to explain the malt I thought of those lines in Austin powers where he says " there you are" and some random guy replies " do I know you?" and Austin replies " no but that's where you are is there." 
Mouthfeel- medium/ light bodied. good carbonation. the hoppiness (spelling?) leaves a slight oily feel.
Drinkablity- hopefully within the next few days I can run and pick up more of this stuff. 
Overall- as a hophead this beer is solid. I was worried it was going to be some new school ipa with what I call "hipster hops". just "exotic"  tropical fruit notes because the grapefruit/ pine taste is played... but to myself I love that piney grapefruit taste and to me there's only a few brewers  that can use them and still hit it out of the park.  i'll say this... I bought a case of the founders harvest before this and i'm now regretting it. I woulda got a few four packs of the harvest and a case of this. 1,339 charactersclaminat420, Nov 01, 2016

The aroma is quite hoppy. Big juicy citrus hops. Grapefruit and orange with some peppery notes. Very inviting. 
The taste is of juicy grapefruit hops. Very fresh flavor. Some notes of pine and onion. Bright flavor, not too dank. 
The feel is moderate with prickly carbonation. Sweet and fruity on the palate. Slight bitterness in the finish. A bit abrasive on the tummy.

S: Imagine you went to a hop farm, with maybe some Amarillo, Citra, and Mosaic hops. Then take those fresh off the vine and blend them into a smoothie. Thats what it smells like. Its ridiculous, you open it up and you can smell it from across the room its so dank.
T: Papaya, mango, citrusy, as it warms alot more orange flavor, rich, fully loaded flavor. Not tropical just juicy. The citra hoppy flavor is probably the most dominant with a pinch of bitterness at the end. It's just so good
F: A proteiny, smooth, almost creamy IPA. It goes down so smooth. Perfect carbonation, great feeling, can swirl around and it won't have to much carbonation. Just a great body.
O: This is such a good beer. No hype, all real. I wish I could have gotten even more of it. Thank you Lagunitas, Thank You 878 characterschicagobeerguy, Oct 31, 2016

3.76/5  rDev -14.9%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75They kicked off New Beer Sunday (Week 610) just a short while ago & I am jumping in with some fresh/wet-hopped ales as they beg for consumption as early as possible. Not necessarily early in the day, but early in their shelf life. 
From the bottle: "2016 OneHitter Series"; "Unfiltered"; "Imagine yourself in a field of dreams, brewer's dreams; that is to say; A field of hops, Mosaic, Amarillo, Equinox, & other special varieties curated by the great men and women who ply the lands and trellis' of the Yakima Valley in Washington State, now inhale, now sip, now swallow ..." [sic]. 
I Pop!ped the cap, but as usual/always, "Unfiltered" means a nice, gentle pour in the hopes of not rousing any lees that may have settled. Well, so much for that idea! Even the gentlest of pours was resulting in a LOT of turbidity. So be it. An in-glass swirl raised a brief finger of foamy, tawny head that seemed anxious to return to the wisps from which it had arisen. Color was a cloudy Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7), but The Gelt Gang remained on the sofa, watching football as they prefer their gold to have clarity. Nose was piney, sticky & dank. I should not have expected anything else or less. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was mainly pine, some grapefruit citrus and just enough tropical fruitiness to keep things interesting and unexpected. Finish was semi-dry, not overly bitter, but not as tasty as the others today had been. One of today's questions is about rating to taste, not to style. I find it tough to hold the line with this one. I would have liked greater clarity, I felt that the taste was sharper than in other examples & I just did not find it worthy of the kinds of scores that dovetail with the current average of 4.42. I apologize, but I liked other better, 1,776 characterswoodychandler, Oct 30, 2016

Hazy, opaque/cloudy orange-yellow elixir. Bright, white 2mm rim of foam with scant, thick islands of lacing.
Grapefruit, lemon, orange rind, earth and pine.  The tropical fruits explode and the earth and pine barely keep then in the vessel.
Fantastic tropical fruit explosion on the tongue, smooth bitterness at the backend with the pine making a brief appearance.
Medium body, nicely carbonated, tangy.
There is such wonderful tropical hop presence here and the 7% ABV is well hidden that the APA label seems a bit misleading. This is the best "fresh hop" brew that I've tasted and rivals Surly Wet for flavor/taste and consistency. 711 charactersCaptCleveland, Oct 29, 2016

At no time is there any harshness or bracing. The finish is clean and just a hint of sweet lingers. Phenomenal. 396 characterstekstr1der, Oct 29, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - This is a largely translucent orange bodied beer, with a slight creamy look, a modest head in the pour, mild lacing.  It is not terribly special to look at, but it does look promising for a big, chewy hop explosion.
S - And the look is telling no lies, because that nose is all about hop fruit, grapefruit and juice, a bit of pine, a hint of wilder notes.  This smells good...
T - ...and tastes better.  Such a full, rich hop flavor, super juicy, lots of grapefruit juice, a bit of flesh, and a hint of pith.  Like eating a segment, without the flesh texture.  There is a bit of menthol in the middle, a hint of pine, and a close that hints at stronger bitterness, but steps off and returns to full juice notes.  This is one fine beer.
M - Very drinkable, slightly chewy, bright close with very little drying, given the huge hops.
O - Oh, my, god.  This one is superb.  So much full rich hop.  Lovely, delicious and so utterly drinkable. 945 charactersTsar_Riga, Oct 29, 2016

4.43/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It only took me a few thousand years to finally get ahold of this one and I found a single from my local store which has recently expanded in the time I've been out of the craft game. I've heard some wonderful things so I sure hope nobody has ever lead me wrong. Lagunitas usually does exceptionally well so I expect nothing but the best.
Look - Poured from the twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. This brew comes directly out of the bottle initially looking like some kinda store bought lemonade bur by the time of hits the glass its a moderately transparent orange in nature. The head stacks up high and leaves a crater while the carbonation appears to be about moderate as expected. Moderate lacing and stick upon a finished glass.
Smell - Call me batshit insane but this smells almost identical to a Founders Mosaic Promise. Dominated by the grassy, floral hoppiness with tangents of orange alongside an obtuse angle of this and that. Smidgens of malt just for good keeping. Smells light and like a bouquet.
Taste - Over aggressive piney dankness is turned down in this beer and replaced by the epitome of what a pale ale is truly supposed to be. The floral aspects retain exactly as expected but it does something that I've never quite seen, at least not that I can remember. There is a huge hit of orange juice and even a smidgen of tobacco upon a burp. This is as close to fresh squeezed orange juice as I have ever gotten out of a beer. Bits of piece of that session IPA esque flavour but nowhere near enough to make you cry cloying after two or three. Basically orange juice beer.
Feel - Bug and fuller than expected out of a pale ale with a light carbonation that barely coats the tongue within this realm. The head had retains nicely and it lays down like a newly bought pillow upon your tongue. The flavors do amplify just a touch as it sits, with the orangey fiasco becoming more true to its original nature. If I didn't know better I'd say there's pulp in this thing. Swallow is a tad spicy with some new hops showing face bit definitely not to a rye extent. Swallows clean as can be, without a cloying sweetness.
Overall - I like it a lot. As far as Pale Ales go this is absolutely world class. If you like session IPA brews but hate how cloying they become, this is a perfect middle ground without a doubt. Boasts a high enough ABV for smooth drinking that will eventually get you where you need to go, but the flavors stay tame and never overpower your senses. There's a reason this one gets the acclaim it does. Take it from a BA Vet, this is good drinking 2,582 charactersRaime, Oct 29, 2016

Smells of bright floral notes along with citrus and tropical notes.
Tastes of the bright hops layered over a good malt base.  Hops lead off with notes of citrus, mango, pineapple, and fresh herbs along with some floral notes.  Gives a delicate hop feel overall.  Malts come in next with a lightly sweet grain character and syrup.  The sweetness really backs up the fruit resulting in an almost candied grapefruit and pineapple feel.  Finishes fairly clean with a bit of lingering hops.
Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation.
Overall, this is a tasty pale where the hops really shine. 707 charactersocelot2500, Oct 29, 2016

3.58/5  rDev -19%look: 2.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Brief initial impression from a bottle (2016 vintage) below. Full review to follow.
APPEARANCE: Dull murky body with plenty of haziness indicative of a lack of filtration. Looks like a mediocre hefeweizen. Head dies within 2 minutes. Appears well-carbonated, I guess. It isn't much to look at.
AROMA: Subtle blueberry, floral notes, faint onion from the Simcoe, and mild resins and oils. It's a nice change of pace from the usual hop extract/oil Lagunitas' hoppy beers are famous for, but it isn't dazzling. Above average aromatic intensity. Clean in terms of yeast profile. I detect no off-flavours or booze.
TASTE: Matches the aroma, with the subtle blueberry from the mosaic hops emerging easily as the star of the show, reminding me of Lone Pint's Yellow rose in that regard.
Thankfully, it doesn't bend too tropical, and avoids that warm boozy pineapple note that's become in vogue of late. It is on the pulpy side of the citrus spectrum, which works for it in combination with its lively yeast and lack of filtration. Nice depth of flavour and flavour duration.
Balanced, with the pale malt sweetness hiding any hop bitterness. There's no dragging biting grapefruit here, but it is pretty pungent hopwise for a mere pale ale.
TEXTURE: Slightly oily, smooth, wet, refreshing, light to medium-bodied, well-carbonated, and of apt thickness and heft on the palate. The oiliness is near perfect, coaxing out nuance from the resinous amarillo hops. Well-executed across the board.
OVERALL: I find myself inhaling it it's so drinkable; this is nice work from Lagunitas. With a fresh hoppy flavour and plenty of complexity, Born Yesterday tugs at the upper limits of what a pale ale can be - though it doesn't quite rival stylistic paragons like Alpine's underappreciated Alpine Ale, and its $14.99 USD pricetag (in NYC) is a bit much especially for Lagunitas (who usually puts out some of the most affordable high quality beers in the U.S. aside from maybe Deschutes or Alaskan). I'll have no trouble polishing off my 6 pack, and I'd definitely recommend it to others. 
Low B (3.53) / GOOD
***
10.29.16 2nd impression:
The way that wave of amarillo resin carries the subtle blueberry of the mosaic is fantastic.
I can't put this stuff down it's so drinkable.
Low B / GOOD
***
11.06.16 3rd impression (from the same 6 pack):
"Age" has barely affected the quality of this brew. Boasts a soft mouthfeel and a fantastically selected hop profile, with bursts of blueberry playing off classic amarillo resin. A bit of oniony simcoe pokes its head out, but everything is kept balanced by bright pale malts. (No overdone caramalt sweetness here.) Citrusy with a tropical bend and some muted hop oils.
Almost everything one would want in a fresh hop pale ale, though not quite up to par with the best expressions of the pale ale style out there. This runs $15 a six pack in New York City, rivaling Sculpin in price - but it's so enjoyable I find myself looking out for it every time I'm in stores. Lagunitas' worse priced small format bottle, but it's oh so worth it.

Smell: as soon as I opened the bottle I could smell blueberry also some citrus fruit grapefruit pith oranges tangerine also some pineapple and some danknes 
Taste:  right upfront I got that blueberry it transitions in the middle of the mouth to citrus fruits orange tangerine peel grapefruit pith a noteciable dankness pineapple. Finishes with some of that fresh squeezed grapefruit juice bitterness. 
Feel: medium body super soft and smooth mouthfeel. dry in the finish. Extremely  drinkable and I can't say it enough it's extremely drinkable.
Overall: For me to open the bottle and to immediately smell the blueberry I knew this was probably gonna be good. But good isn't the right word amazing is the right word. This is world class. It has aspects of west and east coast. Super fruity but the bitterness is there to let you know it's an IPA. I can't believe this is a massed produced beer. Big craft breweries need to take note this is how you make a beer! 1,043 charactersMasonz223, Oct 27, 2016

The taste is juice, juice, juice: pineapple, grapefruit, lemon. . . as though someone cut them up and threw them into the blender. The grapefruit and pine provide some bitter balance.  Overall, it works really well.  The feel is light, crisp, and refreshing with really pleasant carbonation.  The 7% ABV is barely noticeable.  Overall, this is a magnificent APA. To me, it has similarities to Jai Alai, which is one of my favorite IPA's. It's a shame Born Yesterday is released in the Fall because it would be an amazing hot weather beer.  About the only thing that keeps my rating off the chart is the lack of more head and lacing.  Otherwise, this is first rate stuff! 859 charactersMacMalt, Oct 27, 2016

3.73/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5I keep seeing kudos & since I’m a herd follower, I had to pick up a sixer when I ran across it in the booming metropolis of Mankato. What else am I going to do? 12 oz. bottle. 
The pour is yellow, & hazy enough to get the #newmoney IPA fans slightly moist. Smells like lemon, citrus, & a fresh breeze blowing off Otter Lake. I can get behind that. 
Born Yesterday is a great gimmick – hey, I bought it. As a beer it touches the right buttons. Lemon, citrus go straight from the nose to the palate, along with a gentle, sweet bitterness that hits me right in the back of the throat. Juicy Fruit gum, drippy grapefruit, honeysuckle, round out the experience. Tacky & one of the most drinkable beers I can remember; I’m already on my second, & I don’t play like that, homie. 
I don’t get the adoration, but this is a good, solid beer that should come in helmets with flexible piping right into my mouth. 913 charactersmaximum12, Oct 26, 2016

Served in an IPA glass
This beer pours kind of an orangish yellow and is cloudy like pineapple juice. It is topped with a couple inches of off white head that leaves some nice lacing. 
The aroma is loaded with tropical fruit, citrus fruit, and pine. Pineapple seems to stand out.
The taste is as amazing as the smell is. Tropical fruit abounds with some grapefruit bitterness and light pine in the finish.
Medium and pulplike mouthfeel
This is my first try of this beer, and I am blown away. The taste and aroma are fantastic. This is the best pale ale that I have ever had, and it is better than 98% percent of the IPA's that I have ever had. I bought a single. I will definitely buy a sixer. 717 charactersbuschbeer, Oct 26, 2016

Pours a brilliant straw yellow/light orange color, with the slightest of haze. Smell is of grapefruit, citrus oil, slight tropical fruit, along with subtle pine resin. Taste reflects the smell. Initial grapefruit and intense tropical fruit characteristics lead into a smaller line resin that has a short lingering bitterness. Feel is lighter, crisp, and very refreshing. Overall this is a great fresh hop beer that has great qualities all around. 492 charactersReema, Oct 25, 2016

Smells like Trill juice. Grapefruit zest, white pepper, white wine vinegar, corn, lemon Starburst, cracker, and plenty of dankness.
Taste is toasted cracker, fresh cut grass, wheat, lemon, and grapefruit.
Feel is soft but dry and chewy. Very good but different. This beer stands up for quite a while after bottling and continues to taste delicious, albeit a little more dank and spicy over time. 449 charactersSabtos, Oct 24, 2016

Poured into a Unibroue Maudite snifter.
A - Pours hazy golden, orange, & juicy.  Unfiltered.  One finger or so of frothy white head that leaves decent scattered lacing.  Appears adequately carbonated.  Looks excellent.
S - I swear i could smell this thing before i even popped the cap; Huuuuuge huge huge hop juices oozing out of this thing at every angle.  Huge aromatic; piney, lemony, sticky, gooey, oily, dense.  Smells like a freshly juiced hop nugget for damn sure.  Notes of fruit zest: grapefruit, oranges, blood orange, lemon, assorted citrus.  Perhaps some subtle notes of bready earthy rye in there.  I'm not sure I've ever smelled a 'Fresh Hop' IPA that smelled this nice, or any IPA for that matter. I think i might give it the 5.
T - Taste follows the nose: absolutely bursting at every angle with fresh hop goodness: juicy, grassy, herbal, oily, piney, sticky, dank, bitter, resinous.  Big notes of juicy citrus: grapefruit, blood orange, orange zest, lemon.  This is some very fresh IPA right here.
M - Feel is extremely smooth, crisp, & clean.  Ridiculously easy-drinking and quenching for the 7.00% abv.  I could probably down a sixer of this stuff before i even knew it.  Light-bodied, with excellent carb.  Some mildly bitter & piney hop oils lingering on the palate, along with perhaps a touch of spice (rye?).
Overall, i would be lying if i said this wasn't one of the best fresh IPA's i've ever had, which it surely is.  Highly recommended stuff; i will be buying much more of this next time i see it.

This stuff tastes like raw mango juice that's been sitting on a bed of pine needles. Fresh. A little lime peel, guava and papaya. Orange juice on the finish. Certainly more bitter and piney than a lot of the trendy NE IPA style juicebombs.
Nice pillowy mouthfeel thanks to this being unfiltered, and maybe some wheat in the mash bill?
Awesome IPA overall. Certainly on the juicy/acidic end of the spectrum, with a nice piney bitterness too. 590 charactersMongrel, Oct 21, 2016

Pours out a super murky/hazy/turbid golden orange. Looks like a NE IPA.
Aroma is crazy! Pineapple juice, mango, orange, guava, peach, bit of sticky resin too. Could smell all day.
Taste is also crazy tropical. Starts with pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine and goes into peach, apricot and some dankess. It's like a tropical fruit exploded in this beer! Seriously juicy.
Lighter bodied, moderate bitterness, creamy mouthfeel.

Not much in the malt department but well-balanced and easy to drink beer with a bitter, citric hoppiness that blends with a grapefruit almost tropical fruit sweetness.  Smooth and light this is a great beer to relax with. 359 charactersclayrock81, Oct 11, 2016

S. Bright tropical fruits and yeast.
T. Juicy. Bready yeast, oranges, mangoes, grapefruit, apricots, and pineapple. Slightly bitter.
M. Pillowy, soft, crewy. Moderate body, moderate carbonation.
O. This is a different beer than what I'm used to from Lagunitas, more easy-coast. The NE guys are doing things their way for a reason. This is my favorite hop-beer from them, no surprise. 448 charactersmacher0, Sep 30, 2016

That sturdy half-inch of head sits on top a  light oramge bldy with visible bubbles rising from bottom to top. smells like a fruit salad swimming in white wine with the volume turned up to 9. White wine cantaloupe, clean pine, orange, wow!
White wine or hoppy beer? Born Yesterday seems to meld the two together in this liquid. White wine throughout with notes of pine, citrus, cantaloupe, something prickly tasting,  yet very fun to drink as well. Its medium bodied with slight creamin essence are an asset as well. 
Lagunitas had a powerful two-headed monster among its pale ales. This is one head, and the other being New Dogtown. This is delectable. 704 charactersDoubleJ, Jul 29, 2016

With five different whole cone hops, this beer is intensely hoppy. Lots of unique notes: piney bitterness, followed by juicy citrus, and a fairly crisp, and refreshing finish. This is only made once or twice a year, so get it while you can. 306 charactersTrevor11, Jun 18, 2016

This. Was. Fantastic. 
Pours a clear golden amber with an amazing cap of cloud. The fresh hops give this an incredible aroma, matched by the flavor. It's complex, layered, delicate, delicious. Hints of onion and green grass, pine and citrus and hints of melon and ... Let me wipe my drool up. There's a fantastic dank and sticky note to this, along with a full throttle bitterness that keeps me coming back for more. Such an incredible brew. 467 characterselNopalero, Mar 07, 2016

M: It was oily with a little carbonation. Nice slick body.

Notes of grapefruit rinds, wet grass, strong pine and resinous bitter hop.  Crisp, very drinkable and maybe a touch dry on the finish.  It's good, I'm not sure I understand the high marks.  It's very unbalanced showing little in the way of any malt sweetness.  If a fresh hop punch in raw form is what you're looking for than this delivers. 418 charactersHopBomb515, Jan 21, 2016

4.24/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.251L howler from Sherbrooke Liquor store, apparently the only format this is currently available in around these parts.  Something tells me that this one didn't quite arrive in the titular time frame.
This beer pours a slightly hazy, pale golden amber colour, with a rising tower of puffy, rocky, and mostly bubbly dirty white head, which leaves some sudsy shotgun blast lace around the glass as it evenly subsides.
It smells of dank pine resin, punchy mixed citrus fruitiness - white grapefruit, blood orange, papaya, and overripe pineapple - with more indistinct melon notes, gritty and grainy caramel malt, a trendy earthy chalkiness, and further leafy, grassy, and mildly perfumed floral hop bitters.  The taste is complex citrus fruit - pineapple, orange, grapefruit, and hard to differentiate tropical add-ons (ok, mainly kiwi) - a growing flinty and stoney joint, some understated grainy and crackery malt mewling, and more herbal, leafy, and floral hoppiness.
The carbonation is nice and light and fluffy in its engaging frothiness, the body a so-so medium weight, and fairly smooth for such a hop-forward offering, with perhaps even a hint of airy creaminess arising as things evolve out of winter cooler temperatures.  It finishes off-dry, the malt successful in its previous feeling around for its wayward balls, while the admittedly still fresh-seeming west-coast hops take their foot off the gas just enough to let us all fucking breathe.
Overall, a well-rendered, and enjoyable example of this seasonal version of the base style, i.e., one where the hops are not of the pelleted, but instead more of the time-sensitive format.  Anyways, crazy-easy to drink, given the well-balanced nature of the bittering agents, even if their off-sets are a bit lazy in their eventual 'debut'.  I wasn't born yesterday, so I guess I get to say that, yeah, this is pretty good stuff. 1,883 charactersbiboergosum, Jan 03, 2016

The nose is citrusy, hoppy and a touch dank.  The flavor profile is very well-balanced between the maltiness and the hoppiness.  The dankness pokes through in the flavor but the finish is mostly citrusy hops.
Not sure if I buy this as a pale ale but it has the malt backbone to pass and I usually yield to the brewers' definition.  If so, I must say that it is my new favorite APA by quite a distance. 477 characters57md, Dec 19, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Let me first say that this beer really pushes the limits of what a pale ale can be, and that seems to be the trend.  The thing is this one does it in all the right ways.
A fluffy two inch off white head is easily generated with a regular pour.  The body of this brew is a murky honey gold in tone.  Nose is super juicy and just bursting with melon, citrus and big floral notes that really make a lovely fragrance.  Taste is a mix of biting into a tangerine that is super ripe and a fresh cut honey dew melon.  There is a nice balance of citrus rind on the back end of the palate that acts to ad a bit of balance.  A slight piney feel builds on the mouthfeel as you continue to drink and the brew warms.  This beer really runs the gambit in terms of flavor and is a pure joy to drink.  Note to Lagunitas: Make this a year round brew please! 840 charactersSPLITGRIN, Dec 17, 2015

The nose hits with a great, complex hop, with notes of citrus fruits, pine and earth. Very balanced and enticing, which, unfortunately, doesn't come all the way through in the taste. Those fresh hops hit hard, and though they are delicious and complex, I feel like I'm losing out on some of the malt and fruit that were promised. Still, very tasty and drinkable. 486 charactersChandango, Dec 05, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured on draft into a crowler (not growler) 
Look - Golden and clear in color with hardly any white head when poured from the crowler into the glass. Consistent white lacing.  Honestly I prefer the hazy look (craze), but this is more on par with what I drank when I first got into craft.
Smell - Out of this world.  Super piney and hoppy... hops add a touch of orange/grapefruit.
Taste - Clean hop taste at first sip, here come the fruits i smelled; grapefruit, orange, lemon and some malt characteristic.  Then morphs into a piney finish.  Lightly bitter. A nice, juicy beer.
Feel - Smooth, juicy, medium body.  Very little carbonation for an ale.
Overall - One of my favorite pale ale's.  Wish my area got more bottles of this! 735 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Dec 04, 2015

Big frothy 2 finger head fades at a med pace, decent soapy lacing, slight hazy sediment laden golden orange color.
Nose big hops, fresh zesty, floral grassy notes, little resin musty, mild tropical notes, guava passion fruit, mild citrus grapefruit pith, little pine zest, then it gets more resin pine earthy, aha there is mosaic in this! Pine sap earthy.
Taste brings a mild sweet malt, little honey malt and soft malt. Then hops, not too bad at first, some tropical notes, musty passion fruit guava like, into little grapefruit pith, but quickly turns into pine sap and earthy resin, not too bad though. Finish is sticky pine resin, pine sap, little earthy spicy hop, bit sticky.
Mouth is med to lighter softer bod, nice carb.
Overall it had potential, but then mosaic got in way as out usually does. Malts were very nice, a nice tasty drinkable pale... Other than the mosaic of course. 916 charactersjlindros, Dec 03, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Aroma and Appearance: It pours a hazy golden copper colour with two fingers of foam and an average level of carbonation. The aroma has a massive tangerine citrus note that eventually blends into some caramel, grapefruit and floral aromatics creating a delightful smell.
Flavour: Born Yesterday is exceptionally juicy up front, featuring tangerines and lemon citrus notes with hints of hop oils before it moves into a bready caramel middle to balance it out. It finishes with a robust peach skin texture and a resinous piney overtone accompanied by floral herbs and a rather classic dry pale ale finish.
Overall Impression: This is a really, really nice fresh hop beer! I will be adding it to the annual repertoire of fresh hop beer pick ups for as long as I can find it!

A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a very thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of citrus and caramel. Then a strong but not over-powering piney hops bitterness comes in. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time. 761 charactersTheManiacalOne, Nov 29, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5First had this beer on tap in a snifter at a local taproom.  After that tasting I was initially unimpressed (a good beer that I really didn't think up to its hype).  After getting a 6-pack and exploring it a little more fully, I've doubled back on that point of view - this is an exceptional and complex entry in its style.
Pours a hazy honey-straw color with a 2 finger head leaving gorgeous lacing with good retention.  Nose is cirtus fruit - orange and pineapple - with a hint of dry hop backbone.  The palate leads with a touch of pine that very quickly gives way to orange peel and lemon.  I initially felt that the beer (on tap) was too citrusy - almost juice-like, but at the end of a 6 pack, I can safely say that that initial impression from a one-time on-tap experience was entirely wrong.  The hop finish is very dry, and perfectly balances the citrus, giving the beer a crisp, clean mouthfeel.  Overall, a beautifully balanced beer.  Visually appealing, balanced in its taste and hop presence, and perfect on the tongue - an exceptional entry from Lagunitas. 1,071 charactersLAp, Nov 28, 2015

Beer poured golden with a beautiful white head that is leaving lacing behind.
Nose is fresh citrus goodness!
Taste is fresh squeezed tangerine and oranges with an ever slowly creeping in light bitterness coming into the finish mid-glass.
Feel is light and delicate, very refreshing.

Taste is so damn effortless.  A 6pack of this can't last long, nor should it.  Mouthfeel is helped out by perfect kinda high carbonation, and a super dry malt bill that lets those really pungent fruity not bitter hops do their thing.  Seriously this is a world class pale ale in a crowded world of the style, Lagunitas does it phenomenal, and on a large scale.  This is what its all about. 555 charactersrodbeermunch, Nov 27, 2015

4.27/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Light haze, pale body, big fluffy head that doesn't dissipate. Nose is bright, fresh citrus, notes of earthiness and pine - very enjoyable. Taste is quite well rounded, blending hops flavors with a note of malt for a backbone. Very drinkable and enjoyable beer. 261 charactersfrasergrove, Nov 22, 2015

A wonderful, citrus, funk smell.  
Taste is awesome!  The juicy, citrus hop is one of the best.  A lighter malt allows for the funk hop taste to slightly outperform, in which I prefer.  A very pleasant mouthfeel that includes crispness.  The funk travels up the nose.  Lagunitas is a special brewer. 411 charactersGobearswalter34, Nov 22, 2015

Vibrant hazy yellow orange with decent head retention. The smell is of walking through a citrus grove. Fresh orange and grapefruit blast the nose with some floral grass in the background. The taste is essentially the same. Starts with sweet tasting oranges and finishes with bitter grapefruit. Very minimal malt that comes into play. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and on the dryer side. The malt could have been more involved to help balance some of the bitterness- just my personal preference. Definitely worth a try. 540 charactersfrothy_80, Nov 22, 2015

3.97/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75First off, I didn't care for this beer, I rated it based on the style and how it measured up style-wise.  It's heavy mosaic which I don't care for.  However, with that said, it's a very well made beer.  Great nose, nice Amarillo presence, nice carbonation.  Taste is heavy mosaic which overpowered the rest of the flavors.  I could get the equinox, but if a beer has mosaic, that's all I end up tasting.  My own flaw I guess.  Still a great beverage for most though. 466 charactersMLDucky, Nov 21, 2015

Smell - The grassy hops were the limit of the nose. 
Taste - Light citrusy hops were noted with some grass accents. Lemon and light grapefruit were apparent. The caramel backbone reall shines before the grassy aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation brushes away the sweetness. It creates a dry impression. 
Overall - This is a solid session. 467 charactersJohnnyHopps, Nov 19, 2015

M: Fresh/crisp, just a hint thin
O: I sat on this for a week before opening it. Reading the story, I wish I could have tried it as soon as I bought it! Certainly a tasty beer, only improvement would be a bit more body to support the hops 516 charactersONUMello, Nov 15, 2015

Pours a golden yellow to orange body with a fingers worth of white fluffy head. Decent amount of lacing left in the glass.
Great aromas of citrus: oranges, grapefruit, tangerines a little spicy pine at the end.
Yeah, this is really nice! Nice citrus hoppiness up front to follow suit with that aroma, nice dry malty finish.
Light mouth feel, lingering dry biscuit like malt.
Overall, I should have picked up a whole six pack! This is super easy to drink and the best Lagunitas beer I have had since uber fresh Sucks! Pick this one up if you haven't already! 3 weeks old and this is great! I think I like this better than Founders Harvest Fresh Hop Ale! 703 charactersjhartley, Nov 15, 2015

Huge citrus and tropical fruit flavor that melds into a resinous and dank bitterness that cleanses the palate.
Light-bodied, medium carbonation, crisp, fresh, outstanding.

F- Medium, very drinkable.

I totally agree with other reviewers who say that if this had been done by another "more hyped" brewery it would be way more sought after. I am a New Englander and I would put this in the same class with Edward, MO and Lights On - only it's 11.99 for a six pack and I don't have to drive far or wait in line for it!

I hope the week in the fridge hasn't destroyed the wonderful lupulin party I was promised by the label. Clear golden with a good enough white head, but there are seriously a TON of protein floaties (that with a pro dexterity were kept mainly in the bottle).. No shit.. BUNCHES of coagulated particulate (weird, but never effects the nose and palate).. Fantastic citrus and tropical fruit party bowl of hoppiness in the aroma and the flavor... but not the expected bitterness that would come with an IPA.. Just a monstrously hop forward pale ale in unfamiliar ranks.. Few pale ales have packed this much up-front hoppiness and it is testament to the integrity of Lagunitas... Great beers for a great price and frequently incredible beers for a great price. MANY neckbeards would be overwhelming the geek forums if this was made by the "hyped brewery of the week"... Instead, much of the country can buy a 6'er for $11ish. Props to the good folks in Petaluma.

Malt balance is outstanding in this very hoppy, explosively floral pale ale. Beautiful in the glass with two fingers of foamy white head. Clear brilliance that is a signature of Lagunitas. Crisp and quaffable on the finish, no booziness to speak of. You could drink this all afternoon if you had nothing else important going on. 520 charactersdd43, Nov 14, 2015

Totally translucent golden-yellow body, with a thick, frothy white head. Carbonation visible with lots of little bubbles flowing throughout. Lacing is present, and sticky. The smell is pungent.....lots of citrus and tropics, even some kiwi. Slight dankness, but only a touch, with a little sweetness as well. Overall, though, the dominant scent is fruitiness. The taste is the same. Drinks like a crispy, fruity, delectable smoothie, with tons of tropical fruit. Grapefruit, kiwi, orange, yumminess abound. The feel is smooth and medium-bodied, with a mild carbonation. Leaves lingering dankness on the palate. Overall, its a goddamn exceptional brewski, and at a fantastic price point. 726 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 13, 2015

Pours a cloudy gold color with a fluffy 1 inch white head. Good head retention and leaves a nice lacing down the glass.
Smell is loaded with grapefruit and citrus along with a floral component and a bit of honey. The nose is definitely more consistent with a hop-bomb IPA than a pale ale.
Taste is similar to the smell - tons of citrus hops, some honey, just a touch of malt to keep it balanced. Finish is balanced, with some bitterness that stays pretty restrained. Very bright flavor profile overall.
Medium body, medium carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing on the palate. 
In no way would I classify this as a pale ale, but ultimately all that matters is how it tastes, and this is absolutely delicious no matter what you classify it as. Right up there with the best wet hop ales I've had. 845 charactersemyers, Nov 13, 2015

Taste is a crisp refreshing yet very hop forward with citrus, grassy, resinous flavors mix in with little to no malt backbone.  It's the freshest tasting IPA/ Pale ale I've ever had.

Has a profile that's closer to a standout IPA than your standard APA. Not too tropical or pungent or acidic. Floral, citrus notes lead to a taste rich with pine, grass, tangerine , grapefruit and orange. Nothing astringent or too sweet. Nice earthy malt backbone balances the flavor before the crisp finish.  Incredibly drinkable with a smooth body throughout. Finishes nice and bitter without any lingering aftertaste. Give me this beer any day of the week. 538 charactersManapuaMan, Nov 12, 2015

There is a slight malt sweet aftertaste.  Overall a truly excellent beer. 364 characterscmf, Nov 11, 2015

4.25/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Field-fresh and radiant with hop perfume, the ultra floral nature of 'wet-hop' harvest ale is to celebrate the most vibrant and racy hop aromas but the trade-off is with the chlorophyl plagued flavors to follow. But when you use the most coveted hops on the planet, its seductive fruit and fragrance easily allures the sense in mesmerizing fashion.
With the slightest of hop haze, the bright golden ale pours with a blooming white head that pushes its tantilizing aromas of citrus, tropical, herbal and orchard character onto the nose. Its zesty potpourri is flowery of honeysuckle while its sweet taste is also honey-like with hints of caramel and simple syrups. 
As its sweetness recedes somberly, the hop flavor blossoms with the exotic fructose sweetness and candied tang of red grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, mango, passionfruit and kiwi. Hints of lemon and gooseberry trek onward along with a developing herbaceous taste of chive, cannabis and tomcat; all ahead of a bitterly resinous pine character that overwhelms the malt balance just marginally.
Retaining tethers of malt sweetness and graham cracker breadiness, the pale ale is medium-light on the palate, flirting with the line that separates pale ale from IPA. Grassy and piquant with torn pine needles, fresh grass clippings and Italian herbs, its exotic afterglow is fruity, botanical and decidedly fresh. 1,379 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 11, 2015

For me, this crosses over into the IPA spectrum as opposed to a "regular" pale ale but I'm not really going to quibble. The hop flavor in this is strong, fresh and lively. The freshness and liveliness makes this dangerously drinkable. I will probably be scooping up as much of this stuff as I can afford. Hop lovers rejoice! 422 charactersommegangpbr, Nov 11, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25This is an altered version of my original BY review for the Fresh Hop version bottled 10/17/16
It is a very turbid, milky gold color. Big frothy head with great retention and sticky lacing like all of their beers. 
Almost every Lagunitas hoppy ales have that signature taste (not in a bad way), and this one is no different. The malt/yeast combo is interrupted by a dank/weed like leafy green smell. Very assertive hops, but still balanced and restrained at the same time. It pushes that Pale Ale - IPA envelope. It has an earthy/musty flavor that not many pales have with stone fruit. There is plenty of citrus and some pine resin. I notice orange and mango, but there is a sweet musky fruit that I can't pinpoint and is fairly unique. 
This is an outstanding beer. It really is similar to a cross between Sucks and Hop Stoopid with a little bit of that medicinal Waldo's special tossed in there. 900 charactersWesMantooth, Nov 11, 2015

L: Vibrant orange-yellow color, almost a light copper. Finger of head consisting of large bubbles which dies down to a thick puck after a minute.
S: Sticky sweet fruit aroma (cantaloup, grapefruit, pineapple, orange) there are also some dank weed elements in the background.
T: Follows the nose with lot of cantaloup, grapefruit, grapefruit rind, and orange rind. This is followed by some mild malt sweetness and back of the mouth bitterness. 
F: Medium bodied with good carbonation in the mouth. Leaves you with a little cotton mouth dryness.
Overall a great pale ale I would certainly buy again. Has the signature Lagunitas ale taste but has a great deal more hop character than I usually get from their beers. 754 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Nov 10, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: slightly hazy / cloudy. golden honey light amber / orange. hop particles floating around like its nobody's business.
Aroma: I smell fresh berries, like a berry blend. semi sweet marijuana. citrus fruits. Pineapple and mango are both present but the pineapple juice aromas dominate more than the mango. I smell green matter type stuff at the end.
Taste: pretty bold and intense fresh flavors for such a low ABV ale. mosaic hops are represented pretty well. mosaic hops shine and taste best when they are mellowed out and contrasted with other hops such as in this beer. The equinox and citra are certainly detectable, not so much the simcoe and amarillo. fresh berries is what I get (think strawberry and raspberry type thing). some earthy, slight peppery sensation on the back. 
mouthfeel: oily, hefty and hearty for the style and abv. I would say the beer is in the medium range. Lingering mild bitterness along with those delicious hop oils settle in nicely with every sip. 
Overall: It's good. One of the better offerings from Lagunitas. I don't buy much Lagunitas these days but I'm glad I picked up this 6-pack. 1,132 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Nov 10, 2015

4.2/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Bottle split into two pint glasses with a clarified golden body and a thick white head. The cap makes it to a finger high with decent retention. Large sheets of lacing.
S- Juicy fruity and dank hop aroma. Mango, peach, pineapple, oranges, tangerine, floral and herbal hops with just a hint of pale grains.
T- Dank first and foremost with those weedy melon, cantaloupe Mosaic hops. Tropical with plenty of mango as well as a hint of peach. A hint of citrus but to me the juicer fruits shine in this brew. Nectar of the hops and incredibly smooth.
MF- Frothy and slightly creamy light-medium bodied. Carbonation on the high end and it ends with a smooth floral bitterness.
A bold effort and a very successful one from the classic Petaluma brewers. I would love to see this formula followed up by other breweries and repeated by Lagunitas. Probably the freshest and one of the juicier brews I have had from a large scale brewer. 932 characterscbutova, Nov 10, 2015

Nose pops nicely off the top, although, TBH, it's almost a bit more pleasant a couple weeks in than a couple days in -- those first couple bottles, just days old, had a sharply grassy note. Now, there's a touch more dankness and fruit there, though still a very green/grassy aroma overall. Palate just feels a little hollow for me, those grassy notes set against a very thin, crackery malt profile. Kinda makes me think a little of some of Noble Ale Works brews. This isn't a bad beer, but it wasn't, at least to my palate, the fresh hop juggernaut I was hoping for. As for me, gimme some good, old Sierra Nevada Celebration:) 688 charactersbreadwinner, Nov 09, 2015

Pours a fairly bright yellow, mostly clear, with a small head and a loose, foamy ring.  Smell is very fragrant at first pour, lots of citrus.  Also some green grapes, a little malt, a little mustiness.  Taste also brings lots of citrus, light malt, some earthy hops.  Medium bitterness throughout.  Smooth, good body, appropriate level of carbonation.
Not my favorite style, but I thought this was a very good harvest ale.  Lots of flavor and aroma, well worth a purchase. 506 charactersstortore, Nov 09, 2015

Slightly dank aroma, with citrus juice, pine, and lemon grass notes. Green, leafy, and slightly sweet.
Flavor follows: it's herbal, resinous, and slightly sweet. Malts are all pale and biscuity.
Lively and slick mouthfeel with a solid, medium-light body.
Update for 2016: very hazy brew (nearly opaque), with OK head retention. Nose is tremendous! Huge grapefruit flavors, laced with dank herbs, pineapple, and mango. Flavor is fairly similar, with the hops dialed up another notch. 585 charactersRoguer, Nov 08, 2015

Look: Perfectly clear bright golden body with a slightly off-white head. I'm all for turbid beers, but this is by-the-book perfection for appearance.
Smell: This beer is brimming with tropical and stone fruit: pineapple, peach, mango, apricot, lots of raw green hops, and rounded off with some grapefruit as well. Amazing.
Taste: Woah. This is tropical fruit juice and citrus to the extreme, backed by this amazing raw hop bitterness that builds and peaks right at the finish. Guava, pineapple, mandarin orange are the standouts here. Words are somewhat escaping me here, but this is one of the best beers I've ever had. It's a lot like Sucks – tropical, with that signature fruity Lagunitas yeast, but this is just so fresh and green. The finish is like sucking on a raw hop cone. Masterful.
Feel: As stated above, the bitterness starts low and the beer begins very juice-y, then the bitterness swells and reminds you that yes, this is still beer. Carbonation is perfect, mouthfeel is slick and resinous. I wish I could drink this year-round forever.
Overall: This is an outstanding beer and one that should be in the same discussion as Heady and SoS and the like. Holy shit. 1,277 charactersOnemoresolo, Nov 08, 2015

3.53/5  rDev -20.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3I bought this refrigerated bottle at a package store in Cambridge, MA. I'm assuming it's fresh, though I searched for several minutes and could not find a date on the bottle.  I found it to be a decent, highly-hopped, thirst-quenching IPA with a notable bouquet. My only gripe is with the lack of taste complexity. The hop character, while sharp and pungent, doesn't lend itself to "hours" of prolonged contemplation. It's just kind of BAM..right in your face.  Frankly, it tastes more like a single-hop beer, though they list 4 or 5 hops as ingredients on their website. I would hesitate to buy this again by itself, but I might order it as a complement to certain types of food (Pizza, Mexican) that can stand up to that kind of single-minded hop flavor. 756 charactershopalongcassidy2, Nov 07, 2015
4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Had this on tap up at the Cloverleaf the other night, and this was pretty hyped up from those who had had it before. Everything I've had from Lagunitas has been great but even by that benchmark, this stood on top of any of their other offerings that I've had before. No doubt that this has the "fresh" of the fresh hop loud and clear from the get-go!
Good pour to this as the beer had a bright, deep brassy hue, moderate head, and ample rings left once I took some sips. The aroma was where this stood out as the fresh hops, dank weed, pine, and light booze all came together for a powerful combination. This continued once I took a few sips as the juicy maouthfeel took all of those up to another level. Slightly oily, the tropical fruits kicked in in the back as the malt was present for balance but certainly not overpowering. Decent carbonation here as well but not enough to fully scrub away the wide range of flavors after each sop went down.
Glad to see that this was a Pale Ale and not an IPA, as the alcohol wasn't enough to be front and center here. I love Sierra Nevada's beers, including their Fresh Hop, but this one has it beat by a wide enough margin. Even if you've had all of the top-rated Pale Ales and hoppy brews on BA's lists, seek this one out. It's easily worth all of the hype! 1,303 charactersJerzDevl2000, Nov 07, 2015

The nose is a big, mouthwatering blend of bright fermented pineapple and bitter, bitter grapefruit, accented by hints of sweet/cannabis florals and tamarind and topped by provocative alcohol overtones. Up front, the palate is bitter pineapple with hints of candy-like florals and caramel; mid-palate the grapefruit shows a bit, as does the tamarind and a slight grassiness; bready/caramelly malt peeks out around the edges, but perceived bitterness remains considerable. The finish is a modest hit of tamarind and nutty caramel; the linger is a moderate citrusy pine bitterness that lasts awhile. Retrogustative olfaction is strongly grassy and candy-like. Mouthfeel is biggish for the light body and is tongue-scrapingly astringent, but the counterpoint from the aggressive carbonation saves it from being objectionable; the texture is slightly creamy and very prickly from the assertive, lively carbonation.

A crystal clear light orange with a dense, off-white head with ridiculously good retention and lacing, this is spectacular. The nose! Beautiful wet hop character, soft, bright, citrusy, passionfruit, floral character, pine... this is just loaded with hops. Dank, resiny and beautiful. The palate opens big, pungent, resiny with surprising bitterness, punchy, piney with plenty of flavor - floral, passionfruit, grapes, white peach - there's so much going on here. So much so that it whelms the delicate wet hop flavor.Drying, resiny and bitter on the finish, this beer is pungently hoppy and pretty delicious.

Apple, tropical notes, and citrus...it's a hop bomb for sure! The palate is much lighter than the nose, but very smooth. I could drink this all day! Had this one while traveling and can't wait to get back to the East Bay and see if I can readily obtain this. Really good! Is it a pale ale or IPA? Who cares...it's freakin' delicious! Well done! I have found a new favorite fresh hop beer!

S- In pure Lagunitas fashion, the smell is dank, hop and pine, truly reputable, I dare any hop lover to take a wif of this and not close their eyes to swim in aroma heaven.
T- My god, dank and piney hops. This beer shines. So fresh and clean. I can't get enough.
M- So crisp, carbonation is just right medium to high, silky oily hoppy vibe to the whole swallow, but it is highly drinkable. 6.5% is right where an IPA should be, and most at this ABV don't have this much flavor.
O- I mean say what you want about this brand suing others over the use of IPA. I think it's ridiculous myself, but damn. Lagunitas never seems to miss. They hit all their styles with outstanding flavor, and they prices are very reasonable considering the quality of product. I have yet to be let down by this brewer. 925 charactersAC-Mivsek, Nov 07, 2015

Pours a lovely light amber with copious foam head, beautifully fragrant with hoppy floral notes, tropical fruit, citrus. Taste strong citrus and sweet forward, pleasant slightly bitter pine notes mid taste and pleasant finish. Light to medium bodied. Incredibly well balanced – hoppy citrus/pine notes balanced with a bit of sweet malt. Pleasantly carbonated –palate cleansing and ABV well hidden by the complexity.
Overall, a very fresh, well balanced beer –I’d better stock up before it disappears. . . 535 charactersThaneMcC, Nov 07, 2015

The head is huge, pillowy and white with excellent retention and good lacing. The smell is very nice and complex. Scent is tropical fruits mostly grapefruit and mango, floral, earthy, dank pine and hop spiciness. Taste is even better with an explosion of mango up front and a very fresh green dankness on the back end. Finish is pleasently bitter. Feel is light side of medium, which makes it totally reasonable to considered a pale ale. Overall this beer is excellent, and probably my favorite fresh hop beer this season. 586 charactersCNoj012, Nov 06, 2015
4.22/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Bottle. Lagunitas really rallies the troops with these releases. Very reminiscent of the first installment of Lagunitas Sucks in terms of fan fare. Pours pretty. Slightly hazy, huge head. Lots of lacing.  Nose is pretty aromatic. Unique hop aroma. Mosaic, Amarillo & Equinox. Interesting nose with a sweet fruitiness and an herbal element. Maybe a little bit of melon. This one smells different than most of this brewery's hoppy offerings. Flavor is very juicy and bright. Loud citrus and melon flavors. Lingering green hop flavors, too. A bit dank and a bit floral. The malt is sweet but pleasant and shies away from the spotlight. In many ways its a very Lagunitas beer but they definitely used a whole new hop bill here. Drinkable. Very fun to drink actually. Juicy. They know what they're doing, that is for sure. I enjoyed this beer. People will probably go nuts for this brew for several months until Lagunitas releases another chart-topper. 947 charactersVelvetExtract, Nov 06, 2015

First Crack of the bottle your nose is filled with a punch of fresh green hops. The pale ale really allows the essances of the hops to shine through on the nose . The body of the beer is perfect and on the pallet you get a great big wallop of green raw hop. It's truly a fantasia pale ale that's widely available at a great price per 6pk. 486 charactersthampel09, Nov 06, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the best IPAs (don't kid yourselves, this is in fact an IPA) I have had in quite a while. I'd put this on par with likes of Duet IPA from Alpine Beer Co. I won't go into detail for each category, but if you enjoy pungent citrus-y hops that ultimately lead to an extremely refreshing beer, then try this beer. I really don't know what to say about Born Yesterday - it's crips, it has your citrus-y, grapefruit hop flavor that goes down so, so well. The last IPA I had that was this good was a 2 week old bottle of Duet IPA. This beer has been nothing but a pleasant surprise, especially after being disappointed by a couple other hop-centric offerings that I won't mention. This is the most refreshing IPA I've had in quite a while, and at 6.5% abv having a couple extra beers won't hurt. 794 characterssentimetal, Nov 06, 2015

A: Clear golden pour. Tall frothy offwhite head. Head turns soap-like and sticks around forever. Quite decent lacing too.
S: Citrusy. Pungent and sharp aroma. Very refreshing. Lightly floral and spicy to boot.
T: Damn. Nice juicy citrus. Heavy on the floral hops and lots of spicy pine following it. Big bold flavors but not extremely bitter. There is a nice wave of bitterness in the finish but it balances it all out nicely. Lingering floral hops and lightly sweet citrus.
M: Medium bodied, crisp.
O: Really nice fresh hop IPA. Great hop flavors, bold and sharp without being a huge bitter bomb. Awesome balance and crisp drinkability to boot. Seriously, seriously good. One of the best I've had in a long time. 776 charactersDope, Nov 06, 2015

A: Sunny golden color. Awesome clarity. Billowing white head retains like nobody's business.nchunky lacing.
S: Intensely juicy tropical aromas of pineapple, blood orange, mango, pithy tangerine, grapefruit, lemon drops, et al. Floral. Leafy, green, and spicy. Orange gummies. Sweet and grainy malt notes barely escape from underneath the hops.
T: A dank, earthy, and piney dimension emerges in taste that was not overly apparent on the nose. Leafy and spicy. Mango, tangerine, blood orange, and lots of floral flavors. Grainy malt base. Earthy pine/resin finish. 
M: Medium bodied. Firm and hefty with moderate carbonation.
O: Some great aromas at play here thanks to some fresh-hop dry hopping. A great little beer, but the freshness itself is really what makes it special. It will not be the same beer even a month from now, so drink up. 882 charactersryan1788a5, Nov 06, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 oz bottle poured into a convex curved pint glass. Bottled on 10/26/15 so not quite "Born Yesterday" but still at 10 days old from Cali to NJ, distributor to store to my gullet. Larry David would say pretty pretty good.
Look: Pours a beautiful golden amber, fully transparent, big frothy two inch eggshell white head. Big carbonation bubbles, leaves a heavy sticky lacing.
Smell: Generous bouquet of grapefruit and apples, sugary bread-like sweetness similar to a freshly prepared sugared donut. 
Taste: First adjective that comes to mind is light or subdued, Sweet lemon candies, fresh apples, prominent yet restrained garlic/onion notes - what generally is referred to as dank flavors. Taste verges on more tropical notes as it warms. Finishes with sweet pastry notes, similar to a lemon tart. 
Feel: Creamy yet not heavy or overbearing, mild carbonation, leaves light astringency on the tongue.
Overall: Tasty fresh hoppy pale ale. Exactly what I think of when it comes to an American Pale Ale. Way too dank and hoppy to be just a pale ale but too light, clean and refreshing to be an IPA. Bright, a little sweet and dank, this is an APA to hunt for. Kudos to everyone involved to get this one out to the stores quickly. 1,230 charactersDrRambis, Nov 05, 2015

4.06/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a crisp clear golden color with a little head. Aromas jump right into your sense of smell . . . tropical, citrus, resiny and dank. Flavor is upside the head with hops and the malts definitely take a backseat with this pale ale. Obviously can be considered a newer style pale than the traditional malt forward varieties and toes the line between pale and ipa . . . This is an ipa in my book. It's dank and tropical upfront on the palate and fruity almost berry like in the end . . . very interesting. I like this beer and can see why it's getting so much love but for me, like so many others, again, this just isn't worth the hype. Overall, glad I picked up a bottle and I did enjoy it. 691 charactersGOBLIN, Nov 05, 2015

The aroma offers pungency, lime zest for days, lemon, tangerine, peach, candied fruits, caramel malts, a signature Lagunitas chemical dankness.
The flavor follows with orange, grapefruit, sweet lemon zest, hints of tropical, sugary sweetness, medium minus bready malts, onto a medium plus sticky resins and piney bitterness. 365 charactersdar482, Nov 05, 2015

Taste is big dank grapefruit resins hops with a good amount of bready malts.

I can totally see why they urge the customer to consumer as fast as possible as these hops would fade quickly.  Bottled only last week, and shipped all the way to Columbus, Ohio from California and purchased today.  So much citrus, malt, starfruit, orange, almost even a slight hint of banana.  This is one fine PA.  comparable to ZD but maybe even better.  I could drink this all day.  The only unfortunate portion of this beer was the price.  Most Lagunitas are $8.99 or $9.99 for the seasonals, but this one was $11.99 for a 6.  Wish it were less, but oh well, it's a fucking phenomenal beer!!! 704 charactersBisco42, Nov 05, 2015

Fluffy eggshell white head that slowly fades leaving very nice retention and sticky lacing. Smells like classic Lagunitas. Tons of citrus and tropical notes. Lots of sticky grapefruit along with some peach and mango. Some fresh bread and malts in the mix, but the hop aromas shine. The flavors follow the nose. It's a little sweeter than I expected, but it still tastes great. Some pine in the mix along with some lemon and lime zest. Hints of caramel, but once again the hops shine. Nice hop flavor. Doesn't come across as overly bitter. Nice balance. Alcohol goes unnoticed. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Very creamy and fluffy. Very smooth and easy to drink.
This is basically what I expected. Great brew. If you like hoppy beers from Lagunitas, then this won't let you down. Recommended. 937 charactersBB1313, Nov 04, 2015

Smell: As soon as the cap comes off of this one you can smell it.  Citrus orange, grapefruit, and lemon with some dank grass notes.  Really a great smelling beer - I am sure the freshness has something to do with it.
Taste: Lots of grapefruit and orange at the forefront.  Very well hidden malt backbone - just enough there to give some balance.  There is also some herbal grass and piney taste as well.  
Feel: Medium-thin bodied.  Went down very easy with little alcohol.  Slightly dry.
Overall: Lagunitas does hoppy beers right. One of the best APAs out there.  Couldn't recommend more. 656 characterstmryan21, Nov 04, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle from Sprayberry Bottle Shop (Marietta, GA). 2.69. Bottled 10/26/15. Served in a goblet. 
Pours a bright, clear, yellow gold with three fingers of fluffy white head. Attractive, full retention remains with a wide collar that leaves huge, full swaths of lacing. 
Aromas of melon, oranges, papaya, vague berries and some faint crackery malt. This has a bunch of what I like and I can't keep my nose away from the glass. 
The taste follows the nose. Orange peel, honeydew, papaya, bittersweet berry seeds, faint herbal/ vegital, pepper, a hint of mint and some crackery malt. Quite delicious and vibrant. Very easy to drink with no alcohol presence. 
Crisp, fairly light body with zesty carbonation. Melon, citrus peel and vague tropical hops continue to please the palate in the aftertaste. 
No strangers to hop magic, Lagunitas has a new delicious and unique blend in Born Yesterday along with some impressive logistics to get this out so quickly. One of my favorite fresh hop ales so far this season and I will certainly be enjoying this some more while its still both fresh and available. 1,105 charactersThickNStout, Nov 04, 2015

APPEARANCE
Super clear, golden orange with a medium white head that dissipated quickly.
AROMA
Juicy grapefruit, orange, mango, peachy passionfruit, and bubble gum.  Solid piney dankness and candied sweetness.
TASTE
Lots of pithy grapefruit and orange throughout.  Slight tropical character with undertones of bubble gum.  Piney, resinous hops pick up in the middle of the mouth with dank, onion/garlic tones.  Medium-high bitterness with a clean bready malt backbone.  Dry finish with lingering herbal character, piney resins, and pithy citrus.
MOUTHFEEL
Medium-bodied with sudsy carbonation.
OVERALL
It's easy to forget this one isn't an IPA.  Wish the juiciness of the aroma carried over into the taste a little more, but still a solid offering from Lagunitas.  Probably one of the better "fresh hop" beers out there. 858 charactersSirHophamHatt, Nov 04, 2015

The beer has a three finger tall sudsy foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a medium sized thick patch surrounded by a very thin film covering the majority of the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of citrus/orange, tropical/melon, and dank hops over the top of light aromas of grainy malts.
T: Upfront there is a light to moderate flavor of slightly sweet grainy malts. That is followed by slightly stronger than moderate flavors of citrus/orange, tropical/melon, and dank hops which impart a moderate amount of lingering bitterness.
M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly sticky upfront with a hint of dryness in the finish.
O: Easy to drink and a real treat for hop lovers - great hop aromas and flavors. Very enjoyable. 1,063 charactersdbrauneis, Nov 04, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle into a red wine glass.  Bought and drank November 3, 2015 (so it's about a week old).
Appearance: Translucent gold.  Frothy white head with good retention, lots of lacing.
Smell: Fruity Equinox hops, orange/citrus.  There's some Simcoe/Citra dank, but mostly it's orange and telltale fruity Equinox (probably tinged with Amarillo fruitiness, who knows).  Not as huge as it could be, but very pleasant.
Taste: Oof, even better than the smell.  Beautifully attenuated mouthfeel lets these fresh hops shine.  Bright tropical fruit, melon-tinged lime/orange citrus, hints of things strawberry and stone fruit.  Malt takes a complete backseat, which is fine; these hops are all you need.  Maybe a tinge of alcohol burn at the end, but again, fine.  You're here for the wet hops, and you get what you need.
Aftertaste of dank, pungent weed hops like Summit (but it's not).  Doesn't finish clean, finishes long, succulent, and full of hop flavor.  
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied.  Not quite creamy, kind of a soft juiciness.  Much dryer than the usual Lagunitas IPA, and better for it.  The feel really carries this beer.  For a visual analogy, you're here to see what these wet hops are like, and the mouthfeel is like a window to the hops--and this mouthfeel is spotless, crystal clear.  A perfect view into wet Citra, Simcoe, Equinox, and Amarillo hop profiles.  Long aftertaste is succulent and satisfying.  
Overall: This kind of beer is a gift to hop lovers. 1,470 charactersPahn, Nov 04, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Look is transluscent orange with a quickly vanishing white head.
Smell hits me before i finish the pour, this has a huge nose that fills up half the room with the smell of a jungle full of yellow flowers and orange trees.  
Taste follows, but seems and odd combo that stands out.  first is the orange-y dryness of orange rind and second is the danky freshness of the vines in the jungle of hops.  Bitter flowers linger with a drop of orange something.  
Feel is sharp, dry, almost over-effervescent.  Yet the sharpness gives way to a lingering baseline of light pale ale which stays on the tongue.  Weird combo again.
I like it.  The freshness is undeniable, the onslaught of jungle vines and tart flowers and bitter orange are in large measures -- not much has been spared in the making.  All those aspects kind of overwhelm the base of the beer, and it is too light or too crisp to be considered 'perfect' in my book.  But I would drink it again and again when fresh and intend to do so. 989 charactersBodiesLexus, Nov 04, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with active carbonation and a one finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of light neutral malt and robust citrus and dank hops, tropical fruit and lemon citrus; really smells fresh as labelled. Flavor is hop forward with a the same lemon citrus and dank hops with a little piney hops. Lemon citrus and tropical fruit flavors develop after the intial blast of hops, then this settles into a grapefruit and lemon rind  resinous hops finish. Long lingering, flavorful hops. Medium bodied with active carbonation. After a month of amazing wet and fresh hop ales, this still packs a flavorful punch. Truly a lot of hop flavor for a pale ale. The malt sits in the background, but still does a nice job of supporting the herbal hops. Missed this last year and it was worth the wait. Excellent. 875 charactersLiquidAmber, Nov 03, 2015

Pours a fairly clear pale wheat yellow color with a billowing white head and lots of carbonation swirling up from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma is very fruity, peach, mango, pineapple, pine needle, sweet grapefruit, bubblegum, wheat malt, guava, with a good deal of grassy herbal notes.  Reminiscent of a lot of the other hop forward Lagunitas offerings, without the sweet malt backbone.  Very dry, light mouth feel.  Flavor has candied orange, bitter grapefruit and pine resin, oniony dankness, tropical citrus, some key lime, wild berries, and a clean crackery malt.  Bitter, drying aftertaste 639 charactersCzarkazm, Nov 03, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 10/26 bottle into a pint glass. Looks a nice clear gold, with a 1-finger head that's frothy but dense. The smell on first opening/pouring is intense tangerines, fresh grapefruit juice and pine. Smells great. After a couple of sips the smell is more fruity-yeasty, and a little herbal spiciness. The first few sips were citrus/pine, but then the herbal spiciness started dominating, kind of like fresh bay leaves. Once that herbal thing starts happening it takes over for me, and the bitter finish acquires a sort of astringent quality, which I don't fully love, but can accept. Feel is lively on the initial sip, then gets a bit watery before the drying bitterness kicks in. I had another bottle a few days ago and everything is the same this time. For me it's more challenging than uber-drinkable, but a really good beer nonetheless. 848 charactersBeers-es, Nov 03, 2015

A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- Big citrusy hop aroma with that classic Lagunitas house yeast aroma.  Somewhat dank, probably from the Mosaic with notes of grapefruit, peach and a bit of malt sweetness.
T- Wonderful punch of citrusy hop flavor that's a bit sweet which I attribute to the Amarillo.  There's also that slight woodiness probably from the Simcoe.  Also getting some bubble gum for whatever reason.  Bitterness is right on point and don't even get me started on how drinkable this is.  It just doesn't get better than this.
M- Great sharpness from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Dare I say this is the perfect APA?  A home run for sure.  Rides the line between dank and fruity so well.  If you like hops and you haven't had this beer yet, TRY IT!  Even if you have to (god forbid) trade for this, it's a must-have.  Definitely Lagunitas's best beer to-date. 1,209 charactersImmortale25, Nov 03, 2015

Nice pale golden pour with copious fluffy white head. 
Aroma just whallops you in the face. Lots of big hops. Citrusy and piney and spicy, and earthy all over the place. Really aggressive aroma, and I love it.
Taste is aggressive too. Those fresh hops just blast your palate. Big juicy hops, really nice balance. I don't know what Equinox hops really taste like yet, but I do get the lovely Citra, Simcoe and Mosaic. Such a great combo. It's like every hop flavor you can imagine crammed into one lovely ale.
Feel is great. Really nice malt body here, with present but not ridiculous carbonation. Smooth is a good description. Refreshing, just dry enough. 
Overall, the best APA I've had. Reminds me of Hoppy Birthday, but with a fresh hop blast. 798 charactersBryanReed, Nov 01, 2015

A:  Pretty good.  Pours a nice head and leaves alright lacing.  Beer is a clear, pilsner-like yellow that's not particularly noteworthy, however.  No much body carbonation either.
S:  Best part of the beer.  Very floral with some tropical scents.  Get flowers, lemon, mango, and some other tropical flavors. 
T:  Alright, but a little light and watery for my liking.  Taste some herbs and flowers - there's also a dank aftertaste that's quite juicy.  Otherwise, just an alright flavor profile.
F:  Too watery.  Just alright.
O:  Good beer.  Would have again, but it's a little overrated. 735 charactersleantom, Nov 01, 2015

Smells strongly hopped.  Scents of strong citrus, orange and passion fruit mostly.  Grapefruit and fresh cut pine lumber.  Mild honeysuckle sweetness.  Lesser scents of cedar and lemon.  Very aromatic.
Starts out fairly strong.  Slightly savory and quite bitter.  The flavor is woody and citrus.
Mouthfeel is OK.

Aroma is clean bright citrusy hops; fresh grapefruit and orange rind. Bursting with tropical acidic juice. 
Taste is a blast of citrusy alpha acids layered over neutral pale malt. Clean, crisp and sharp. Nice bitter aftertaste lingers on the palate.
Mouthfeel is just right. Balanced, medium bodied with a nice spicy bite.
Overall a truly outstanding offering. Might need to do a side by side with another favorite in the style, Cowiche Canyon (which I gave a 4.47). This is why we drink fresh hop beers. 673 charactersdraheim, Nov 01, 2015

A — Pours a nicely light orangey hue into the glass, more yellow than orange actually. There is a nice eggshell colored head that forms, leaving behind some great lacing.
S — Fills the room with aromas of fresh hops, lemon, pine, peach, mango, earth, pineapple, citrus, lime, tea leaves, green grass.
T — Errs on the sweet side, bringing notes of lemon custard, peach flesh, pineapple juice, mango slices, papaya, guava, mandarin orange. Sweet overall, but there is a light piney undertone to round things out.
M — On the light side of medium bodied, there is a great lingering finish of dry and bitter hops.
O — Very nice overall, great representation of fresh hops, while sweet it is not overdone. 752 charactersMoose90, Oct 31, 2015

Aroma is one of the better ones I've smelled on a fresh hop beer. Very dank and extremely juicy. Get pineapple, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, chive, and tons of dankness. There are some slight resinous, green undertones as well.
Taste follows the aroma well. Get juicy pineapple, peach, and grapefruit with slight undertones of mango, passionfruit, and mint (?). There is a blanket of strong dankness that is there throughout. Dries out nicely into the finish and has a significant pine resin, green bitterness. The sweet, light malt present a nice blank slate for the hops to show themselves off on.
Medium body. Smooth, crisp, creamy. Oily and slightly sticky finish.
This is possibly the best fresh hop beer I've ever had. The juiciness of this beer sets it apart from the usual resinous, green hop characteristics of most wet-hopped/fresh hop beers. 927 charactersbrewskis, Oct 31, 2015

2015 OneHitter Series
Borned 10/26/15
Served in a pint glass
Gorgeous appearance. The shockingly clear,  golden-amber liquid was topped by a tight, sea foam,  two-finger tall, eggshell colored crown that slowly dropped to a frothy cap. Drippy, craggily rings of lacing coated the glass and lasted until the beer was finished.
The aroma was absolutely outstanding. Amazingly hoppy and fragrant. Bright tropical fruit notes dominated. Loads of mango and musty passionfruit. Bit of guava. Peach and apricot came through strong as well. Super dank and weed-like. The marijuana notes were kicking. As the beer warmed, the dankness intensified.
The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Really juicy and fruity. Again, tropical fruit notes were in full effect. Loads of mango and passionfruit. Papaya was also noticeable. Super dank and weed-y. Touch of honey-like sweetness. Orange notes also came through strong. The beer was very juice-like. Tangerine and clementine were also apparent. The finish contained notes of orange peel and ruby red grapefruit. Amazingly well balanced with just a touch of bitterness. As in the nose, the cannabis-like dankness intensified as the beer warmed.
The mouthfeel was perhaps the only thing about this beer that did not blow me away. It was thinner bodied and somewhat over carbonated. Frothy and fluffy on the palate. With time, the carbonation settled to a more appropriate level and the beer turned smoother and more supple.
After constantly being disappointed by the uber pithy, dry and bitter wet hopped beers that Sierra Nevada puts our each year, I had a fairly negative opinion on the style. Born Yesterday, however, gave me a new perspective on them. This beer ranks right up there with Trillium's Fort Point Pale Ale and 3 Floyds's Zombie Dust as one of the best American pale ales I have ever tried, and one of the best hoppy beers period. Thank you Lagunitas for sending this to the East Coast this year. 2,047 charactersDamian, Oct 31, 2015

4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a nonic pint glass.
Extremely crystal clear body, hanging with a supper bright and brassy light gold color, and very sparse rising carbonation.  The head froths like an IPA, big and thick, foamy with swiss chesse retention and very even in an easy three finger height, probably even bigger.  Massive retention for a pale ale, thick and ring island puck presence and lace.  Excellent looking aggressive pale ale brew.
Aroma goes for classic hop earth and fun.  Juiced earthy tones, dank qualities, and lots of green thick herbs.  One dimensional but with a good dimension as much of the other characteristics can't make a dent from this large hop haze in terms of scent.  
Palate brings a much different level of appreciation.  Sweet juiced body, very controlled, with soft caramel in the mid palate.  Finishes thick with mild hop citrus and tropical qualities.  Dank earth quality and sticky senses has taken a much different back seat, if only adding to the bitterness in the aftertaste.  Extremely easy drinkablity, with a full rich malt thickness that isn't overly sweet, syrupy, or cloying.  Mild tea like herbs as well on the finish, getting into a good soft green complexity.
A real good example of hop forward but also level headed American pale ale, with a good degree of sophistication.  Super drinkable, and a hop forward brew that doesn't become one dimensional and all about the hops.  Great stuff. 1,442 characterssmakawhat, Oct 31, 2015

Poured this and got a medium head.  The nose isn't very strong and I wondered oh this won't be very hoppy.  The first sip....I am sure the look on my face should have been photographed.  It was a total surprise.  The hops are intense.  Way intense. The hope are my kind of hops.  Tropical and fruity but the first burst is very powerful. We are only one state away from Illinois so I am sure this stuff is fresh.  If not, it would take away the whole intent of a beer like this.  I like it!

Super fresh and crisp, has some earthiness, a little chew; the malt backbone is fairly present for such a hop-forward product, adding nice body and clean grain flavors. Citrus impressions are underscored with a tacky pine resin... I get something almost akin to a Czech pilsener in the taste and bitterness. Doubt there'll be any complaints about this beer. 523 charactersGreywulfken, Oct 31, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a moderately burnt orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated fairly quickly. Lacing spider webbed nicely.
The smell had sweet onion, mild sweet grapefruit, a sly bit of lemon and then some bitter pine. Subtle sweet grassiness mildly builds in the background as it warms.
The taste was mainly sweet backed up by the bitter components of its aroma. Normal Lagunitas yeasty aftertaste also runs into the finish, but I like that aftertaste, (I know, I know, I know, some don't like that, but I do, so there!).
The mouthfeel was light bodied with a pretty good sessionable feel to it. Carbonation hits just sharp enough but still not overly done allowing the hops to burst on my tongue in a great harsh way.
Overall, best thing about this one is its aroma, but for the most part, I liked this one all of the way. Of course, I'd come back to this. 917 charactersSitkaSteve, Oct 31, 2015

4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Oofa, they say all Lagunitas beers tend to smell and taste the same (a point I've argued many times myself), but this takes the hop character of your typical Lagunitas pale ale to never-before-seen extremes. This has a powerful Mosaic character, but it's the good "massive grapefruit bomb" character instead of the bad "sweet onion" one. There are also some nice dank and even tropical qualities. It has the hop character of a GOOD DIPA, and the malt backbone of a standard pale ale, in an awesome way. On the palate, it opens up with some tropical fruit, before transitioning into a bomb of dankness. Oh yeah, there's a bit of caramel malt lurking around the finish, too. Its first sip is horribly imbalanced, only to smooth out beautifully after sips two and three. The feel is typical - medium body, good carbonation, sweetness to balance - or is it?! There's a tingling, oily sensation that makes me wonder if I'm actually chewing on a hop come (the hallmark of a good wet hop IPA). This is one of the best hoppy beers I've had this year, probably the best Lagunitas beer I've had also, and it confirms something big: freshness matters. I've never had a bottled beer that was four days old before this one. See, y'all? This is why I drink local Maryland beer instead of some "west coast" IPA that's verging on four months old. Whatever. This beer is amazing, go buy it now.

4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Very nice - reviewer poured from bottle.
Pretty orangey gold with white head. Nice inviting look. 
Smell is just ok good - nothing mind blowing. Both citrus and pine hop notes show up, getting a little more robust as it warms. The malt hogs a little too much attention here. 
Taste is great - great bitter hop bite right away, followed by a welcome wave of biscuity malt to settle things down. The more fruity, subtle notes of the hops linger. Very nice progression. 
Mouthfeel is a good conductor for this beer, although it feels a little heavy for a pale ale. 
Overall - one of the best big craft fresh hop offerings I've had in a while. Awesome. 653 characterssoze47, Oct 31, 2015

Pungent hops, light as a feather malt with a delicate ribbon of caramel. Spice herbal and citrus on the nose. taste is earthy grapefruit, candied lemon peel and strong with spice and grassy herbal. The hops herbal is strong and well defined.  A steady moderate bitterness finishes this beer not with the caramel form malt to stand out but with the pungent herbal to remain in the aftertaste with a honey like sweet remnant of the malt. Steady bitterness that lingers well. Mouthfeel is medium. Crisp finish. 593 charactersutopiajane, Oct 31, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a tangerine orange.  Sparse head, that collapses down into a small film and little to no lacing.  Not ideal, but not terrible.
Aroma is very nice -- ripe, raw hops.  Like putting your nose in it at the homebrew store.  A bit of the welcome and bright gasoline haze that can only come from Citra dry-hops.  Very promising.  Very impressive for an APA, but let's be honest -- at 6.5 ABV, this is an IPA in practice, if not in name.  Based upon that, this is a good, if not spectacular swing through the nose.
Taste is sweet cream and pinecones, far more mellow than the nose suggests.  A welcome shot of pine sap in a brewing world recently filled with overly juicy APAs and IPAs.  A very nice expression of the hop.  Booze sneaks through as well; again, this would benefit from a lower ABV.
Mouthfeel is pillow-soft, perhaps a bit under-carbonated.  You feel the heat of the booze here as well; it could stand to be a bit more restrained.  Again, a great concept that didn't need the steroids that it's on.
Overall, a delightful beer, albeit one with flaws.  Certainly my favorite out of the Lagunitas line-up.  Worth picking up a sixer. 1,146 charactersithacabaron, Oct 31, 2015

Pours very hazy bright golden yellow color with a 2 finger dense and rocky white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge grapefruit, peach, pineapple, tangerine, mango, melon, passion fruit, papaya, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of bright/dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge grapefruit, peach, pineapple, tangerine, mango, melon, passion fruit papaya, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind/spicy/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, peach, pineapple, mango, melon, passion fruit, papaya, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pepper, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky/resinous/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class wet hop IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of bright/dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. An insanely amazing offering. 1,846 characterssuperspak, Oct 31, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Serving glass: Poured from bottle into IPA glass.
Appearance: Rich bronze-gold with thick white head and pretty sticky lacing.
Smell: Loads of different hop notes - mango, grapefruit, orange, pine, pineapple, and blueberry. There are also some spicy, herbal and earthy notes. After a few minutes, the mango and grapefruit remain the most prominent.
Taste: Just fantastic. This is cornucopia of current hop varietals and it tastes like it. Between the citrus (grapefruit, orange), tropical (mango, pineapple, blueberry), pine and spicy/earthy notes, this covers all of my possible hop fix needs. Some caramel and toasted malts. Not as sticky sweet as some Lagunitas brews, with moderate bitterness. Both hoppy and balanced at the same time. Ridiculously juicy and fresh.
Feel: Moderately high carbonation (kinda tingly), medium body, dry finish. Some lingering flavors prevent a crisp, clean finish, but I really don't care.
Overall: This is a magnificent beer. This is my new favorite Lagunitas beer, my favorite Pale Ale (by a long shot), and maybe even my favorite Wet/Fresh Hop beer.
Anyone skipping out on this because Lagunitas "sold out" to Heineken made a very poor choice.
2016 version went from 6.5% to 7.0%, but my review and scores don't change. 1,263 charactersbsp77, Oct 31, 2015

Pours golden, transparent, huge frothy head that sticks to the glass beautifully.  The smell is off the charts, I mean for a hop forward beer that was bottled on 10/26 (drunk 10/30) you can't get much better.  The taste is crisp and clean, tasty at first but opens up very nicely throughout the glass.  I'd say it's neck and neck with Founders Harvest Ale for the best fresh hopped beers I've tried, possibly getting the slight edge over that classic (though I haven't had one yet this year). 570 charactersJwburns75, Oct 31, 2015

Very hoppy and aromatic, smells phenomenal, if a bit simple, of course that's relatively speaking. Flavour is clean citrus, passion fruit, toffee and caramel; a little bit of pine resin on the backend serves to give a black tea-like finish. Very clean, hoppy pale ale that is incredibly easy to drink. Mouthfeel is medium-thinner bodied, good carbonation, slight black tea-like finish with a bit of pine bitterness. Very easy to drink. I found this beer to be delicious as advertised, with a nice helping of aromatic hops to whet the appetite. 884 charactersStevedore, Oct 30, 2015

Perfect carbonation and great mouthfeel.This lacks the blast of hop aroma I expected and the taste is more piney than juicy and citrus. I may not be a fan of wet hops/ harvest ales add to me the hoppy characteristics seem muted. Good beer though. 291 charactershardysf, Oct 30, 2015

This is an absolutely wonderful beer. 361 charactersBudlum, Oct 30, 2015

Smells of citrusy hops and mango. A fantastically sweet smell. 
This is an incredibly fruity IPA. The mango from the smell is very distinct in the flavor, with added elements of grapefruit. The bitterness of the hops made my tongue numb in the most delightful way. This is a most excellent IPA, which I would recommend to anyone.

Borned on 10/26/15. Crystal clear, golden straw color. Moderate lacing and decent head retention. The mouth is a little thin for body, but it lingers a while and makes up for it. The nose on this beer knocked my socks of. So delicious and fruity. Maybe air freshener can be made next year? Bitterness works well, and complements the hop flavor and balance of the malt perfectly. Really, not much fault in this beer. It's damn good. 553 charactersmst934, Oct 30, 2015

Smell was awesome, intense fresh hop aroma.
Taste was nicely balanced, a little biscuity light malt followed with a super smooth hop finish, not too bitter.
The feel was a little sad, I'd say significantly under carbonated.
Overall, a very solid wet hopped pale ale. 307 charactersgaryloveman, Oct 30, 2015

12oz bottle served in a large snifter. Borned 10/26/15. Purchased for me at Stogies and Hops in Lynnwood by the inimitable @mr-jj.
Pours pretty clear golden with a respectable, persistent head and lots of carbonation. Smell is gorgeous, clearly fresh hop. Dank, citrus, damp greens.
Taste is heavier on straw -- very tasty pale ale. Strong hops presence, resinous, a little pine hint. 
Mouthfeel is medium, a little watery. Overall, very tasty pale ale. I have a dozen more in the fridge, and I'm excited about it. 528 characterssnaotheus, Oct 30, 2015

4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated 10/26:
This beer just looks amazing.  Regardless of how, the beer is crystal clear,  mostly light golden, but with an orange hue.  Head is white and has a puck atop the beer with a medium pour.  Lacing is considerable.
Nose is citrusy in nature - pulp and pith, but there is a forest-like freshness there - not piney, but a combination of light floral and herbal notes.  I think the fresh part of fresh hops comes out nicely behind the citrus and pith.
Taste is very similar to the nose, but with a thicker oily note to the citrus pith/rind.  Being fresh hopped (and perhaps knowing it) - I think I can almost taste the oils as they are stripped from the cones.  Bitterness comes across as grapefruit pith more as the beer warms.  There's a little mineral note to the otherwise rather clean base, it seems to me, but is fairly similar to other Lagunitas beers I have had.
A wonderful brew that as a pale ale allows the hops to really shine, so I'm iffy on the categorization.  However, it's very drinkable and gives the impression that it wouldn't fatigue my palate by having one more (repeat). 1,110 characterscjgiant, Oct 30, 2015

Consumed: 10.29.15
A: 4.5 Pours a clear, golden yellow. The two-inch, off-white head lasts a couple minutes and leaves lots of lace behind.
S: 4.25 Aromas are fairly muted, mostly consisting of fresh hops offering up dank, piney elements. There is a mild, sweet malt presence on the nose too, but it’s largely masked by hops. Some more subtleties, such as papaya and lemon, appear as the beer warms 
T: 4.5 Flavors are much more alive than the aroma lets on. The beer starts off a touch sweet with papaya, banana, and orange before moving on to fresh hop bitterness. The fresh hops add a nice, hop oil like bitterness with piney, dank flavor. Bitterness is fairly high, but doesn’t linger, making the balance between tropical, sweet flavors and bitter, piney flavors really interesting.
M: 4.5 Body and carbonation are both great. Super drinkable.
O: 4.5 I usually don’t care much for fresh hop ales, but this delivers some of my favorite hop characteristics (tropical flavors) that most other beers in this category tend to miss. 1,062 charactersTele, Oct 30, 2015

Foamy, thick, sudsy head of the massive and persistent variety. Copper/orange body with the bubbliness of champagne and and good clarity, though not quite transparent. It looks great. 5
Smell is killer. Usually I get passionfruit as part of an assortment of other tropical flavors, but here it's dominant, forceful, upfront and sticky. Add bursts of grapefruit to the passionfruit and you've got a lethal combination. But hold your horses, a second pass of the nose brings the melon and floral bouquet combination that makes Yellow Rose out of Texas one of my favorite beers. This is seductive and delicious-smelling. I'm ready to drink a whole sixer tonight based off of the smell. 4.75
Okay, the flavor leaves me hanging at first, at least that's how it seemed, but then I realized the taste opens with the earthy, resinous, floral fresh hop flavor that is to my thinking generally an understated , subtle flavor. Based on the nose, I was expecting a wallop of fruit. It does come, but not as boldly as the aroma. There's mango and melon and zesty grapefruit peel and it all tastes wonderful, but it simply takes a while to adjust and accept that it's tamer than the nose. Still this tastes great. 4.5
Very zesty, floral and bitter and feel, but there's a lovely thread of sweet, creaminess that holds everything together and makes this an easy and delicious sipper. It's light-bodied, refreshing and begs to be drank in multiples. 4.5
This beer is the real deal. Pretty damn mind-blowing that Lagunitas can produce something like this for the masses. 1,604 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 30, 2015

Brilliantly clear gold topped by a tall, fluffy white head.  Huge aroma of fresh, raw hoppy goodness...pungent pineapple, tangerine, peach, and sticky pine.  Equally potent, oily hoppy flavor.  Fruity, but not too sweet or juicy - a nice bitter resinous quality asserts itself.  Delicious pineapple, pulpy grapefruit, apricot, and leafy dankness.  Incredibly fresh and juicy, but I like my IPAs to have at least a little aggressiveness, and this has it.  Medium-light bodied and a little frothy, drying out in the finish.  Absolutely fantastic!  One of the best I've ever had.  Huge props to Lagunitas for distributing this so quickly to preserve that unbelievable hoppy freshness. 698 characterswedge, Oct 30, 2015

The smell is extremely appealing. There seems to be a very light malt breadiness underneath the strong hop notes but is difficult to detect. The hop note is a bit complex but blend very well together. The hops consist of strong pine smell and light grapefruit and citrus notes. The pine note is the most noticeable but the other two sneak in every once in a while to create a very nice aroma.
The taste is very good and very delicious. The malt note is pretty much buried and hard to find at all. The hop notes take stage here and certainly deliver. The hop notes are strong and provide a lot more intensity than their pellet version. The pine note is still the strongest but the grapefruit notes make a much stronger show than normal.
The feel is exceptional. Smooth and thin with very biting carbonation creates a nice dry finish on a medium bodied beer.
Overall ,a fantastic beer and a must-have; especially if you're buying it with days of its delivery. The magnificent aroma and delicious bitter hop taste because of how fresh it is makes this a must-have before it's gone. Highly recommended! 1,318 charactersHattedClassic, Oct 29, 2015

Smell:  Bursts with grapefruit, pineapple and fresh mown grass; somewhat dank, as if there were some other herbs growing in the lawn
Taste:  Just a touch of caramel in the base though it does provide an underpinning from start to finish; the hops build quickly, bringing grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit and some grass and weeds (what else would you expect from Lagunitas, even if they have sold a share to the Man); the bitterness builds through the finish and is , in fact somewhat sharp in the aftertaste
Mouthfeel:  Medium body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  A bit of a gimmick but I like it; this is pretty close to being an IPA so I think it is a ringer in the APA category 849 charactersbrentk56, Oct 29, 2015

It's NOT an IPA which is a nice change from other fresh hopped beers produced around this time of year.  Well balanced and eminently drinkable, albeit with a stiff ABV for a pale ale.

A - Clear straw yellow body.  Pure white head pours 3 fingers high with nice retention and lace.
S -  Outstanding and relatively unique fresh hop nose.  Super juicy, loaded with orange citrus and strawberry jam.  Woody bitters and cilantro on the backend.
T - Bright lemon lime flavor with edges of white bread and fresh wood.  Pine through the finish.
M - Medium light body, but could use a little more carbonation.
O - A bright, delicious take on an APA. 508 charactersvfgccp, Oct 29, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Look - Clear honey amber in color. Head that starts out strong, slowly fades and lingers. Leaves lacing trail all long the side of the glass.
Smell - The second you uncap the bottle, the aroma of fresh hops fills the air around the bottle. piney, citrusy, grassy hops.
Taste - Blew me away. The hops are so prominent. They do not overpower though. So well balanced, so nuanced. The malt backbone of this beers frames the hops perfectly.
Feel - Clean. Light carbonation. It's almost as if it lingers, then cleanses the palate for another sip. 
Overall - Nothing about this beer is hype. It lives up to the definition of fresh hop and sets a standard. Leaves you with the feeling that a once a year release is not enough. 719 characterscreepinjeeper, Oct 29, 2015

Look: pale burnt orange, with a persistent fluffy white head.
Smell: bright tropical fruit, mild almost rye-like spiciness, cedar.
Taste: tropical fruit, pine, hay. Not overly sweet, with some savory elements.
Feel: medium body that feels undercarbed... ends up being too syrupy, especially for a single IPA.
Overall: definitely a really good beer, but not quite great. 421 charactersneurobot01, Oct 29, 2015

Color is clear gold with a medium frothy white head.  Aroma is all about the hops - citrus and tropical, grassy, green and fresh.  Taste is similar, with lots of resin and delicious freshness.  I can usually pick out the flavor profile of Lagunitus hops, but this one is different - probably the fresh hops.  The body is medium with moderate carbonation and lots of oily, mouth-drying resins.  Overall, it's a great example of capturing the essence of hops. 563 charactersmr-jj, Oct 29, 2015

Flavor is less stellar than the aroma.  There's a light caramel, toasted malt sweetness throughout, finishing fairly resiny and moderately bitter/earthy/grassy.  Takes a bit of coaxing, but sharp grapefruit, lime, and muted mango emerge to complement.
Excellent beer, great concept. 469 charactersbarczar, Oct 29, 2015

This beer takes everything I love about Lagunitas hoppy beers, and then takes it to a new level.  Aroma is just ridiculous.  Smells like a hot yoga chick squeezed a grapefruit in her armpit.  Oh baby!  Somehow they made this incredibly drinkable.  I need more.
If you didn't drink this one super fresh, you missed out.  The beer changed A LOT over just a few weeks. 471 charactershoppytobehere, Oct 29, 2015

Tons of Grapefruit on the nose, which means I shouldn't like this beer. Just a hint of dankness underneath the grapefruit like the fishy thickness of sculpin, which is a smell I very much enjoy. I like a more piney bitterness usually, however on tasting it turns out there was a great pine bitterness with undertones of tropical fruit that went down very nicely. Often pale ales tend toward too sweet or malty for me, but this ones fights of the sweetness to deliver on the great hop taste. Fun to have a beer so fresh, even better that it tasted interesting as well. I would drink this beer again. 684 charactersMaticus, Oct 29, 2015

This one pours a clear orange-ish color,with a substantial, long lasting head, and a good amount of sticky lacing.
Smells like pineapple, orange, pine, mango, and grass. Smells just unbelievably juicy.
This has to be one of the juiciest, most drinkable beers I've ever had. It's like hops off the vine, so citrusy, and so wonderful- orange, pineapple, grapefruit, grassiness, pine resin, and some honey-dripped malt. This is just so luxuriously and beautifully tasty.
This is light bodied, crisp and airy on the palate, with a very juicy mouthfeel, and a moderate level of carbonation.
This is an unreal fresh hop ale, one of the absolute best on the market, and a real treat to drink. Absolutely next level. 829 charactersGreesyFizeek, Oct 29, 2015

A: Pours a clear golden color with a gorgeous puffy white head that sticks around one finger for quite a while. 
S: This smells ridiculous. Tons of juicy hop notes with some peach, honey malt, juicy pink grapefruit and some light pine. Right up there with Sucks for me smell-wise. 
T: Yes. Nice juicy citrus hops upfront with some grapefruit resin and pine coming in around the middle. Finishes with some pine resin, bitter grapefruit pith and baby aspirin. Super clean and just so much great hop flavor. This is fantastic. 619 charactersnotchucknorris, Oct 29, 2015

Taste is horrifically dank.  A lot of resin and hops. Mild malt.
Very crisp with a somewhat dry finish. 
It's a really nice beer, but I can't even begin to understand the hype. Nothing about this screams "OH MY GOD, IT'S SO FRESH".  Everything seems a little muted.
Edit 3 days later:  I had this again at the bar that I work at, and it is MUCH better than the keg at The Pourhouse in Montgomeryville.  Attempt number 2 was floral with citrus and I could actually taste the malt.  I'll grab a pint and re-review soon. 619 charactersepyon396, Oct 29, 2015

L- Pour is a bit hazy strawlike with a minimal amount of head and lacing.
S- Expected a bit more here. Grassy. Pine. Doesn't smell overly hoppy it fresh.
T- Taste follows. Bitter piney hops throughout. More IPA than APA.
M- Fine. Drinkable. Refreshing. Quite bitter throughout.

Intense aromas of mango, pine, grapefruit, orange, and stone fruits leap out of the glass. I've had my share of excellent IPAs, but I can't remember any which were so powerfully aromatic. The flavor profile mirrors the aromas, with the addition of a pleasantly sweet malt character and a hop bitterness which is crisp, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is pleasantly full, and the finish delightfully dry. 494 charactersDavidHume, Oct 28, 2015

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very juicy and oily with a drying finish.

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The raison d'être of the fresh hop beer is to turn the hop aroma and taste "up to 11," an objective it fulfills by how and with what it is brewed, and how quickly it is delivered to the consumer.  For me, this  one sets the standard on all these fronts.  It's a special beer, and a tribute to all that Lagunitas does best.  **Edit: The 2014 version was just ridiculously good, and in a class entirely by itself; in 2015, it's "merely" the best, or one of the best, fresh hop beers I had this year, albeit somewhat short of yesteryear's exalted status.** 554 charactersEdwardAbbey, Sep 22, 2015

Born Yesterday is a slightly hazy pale golden yellow. It has thick white head with good retention and spotty lacing.
Aroma is full of super fresh hop character. It's strong and dank with a variety of west coast varieties.
Flavor is sweet up front followed by big notes and not a ton of bitterness. This one is labeled a pale ale but I might preface that with the word "extra." Good balance for the style.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Good depth of flavor.
Overall another fantastic hop bomb from Lagunitas. I certainly hope it becomes a seasonal. 639 charactersGilGarp, Dec 18, 2014

The mouth feel is almost sweet yet with a very nice bitter bite. The flavors are as the smell, citrus, pineapple, with a hint of spice. There is a very nice malt backing, like a nice fresh baked roll. A very drinkable brew. Paired well with my wild salmon. Cheers 432 charactersdalahodson, Dec 07, 2014

Pours a clear golden colour with a gorgeous thick and creamy 1 inch head. Very attractive and strong hop aromas of spruce like and bursting with citric intensity. Taste is similar but with the usual Laganitas signature yeast flavour, and the hops seem a wee bit on the powder leafyy side. Mouth feel is fine smooth with lowish carbonation..good hoppy after taste .Nice beer ..stronger than it tastes though! 502 charactersReidrover, Dec 01, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I have had this one in the past, but this review is for the 2016 unfiltered addition. That is what pushes my review up quite a bit. Initially, I scored it a 4.67 in 2014 when you could just give a straight up score without going into each category. Drank this many times this year in Lagunitas Bell jar glasses. It is a cloudy beer with a gold color that reminds me of some sort of dirty juice. Super active carbonation, phone, and lacing. The nose is a very strong hop sent with a juicy background. Best words to describe the taste are zingy hops. There is a slight bitterness and juicy background behind it. A very full mouth feel with a slightly strong alcohol presence. Honestly, I do not know how they can top 2016's version, but I am sure looking forward to seeing them try. 780 charactersmschrei, Nov 25, 2014

Smell- Aroma is delicious, tons of tropical fruit notes like guava, pineapple and mango.
Taste- like the smell there's tons of Tropical fruit upfront with the strong notes of guava, pineapple, mango. a nice, subtle kick of bitterness provides contrast with the sweet fruit and a touch of creamy malt in the very end to balance. super tasty.
Feel- Medium body, juicy upfront to compliment the bold, fruity flavors with lots of bubbles and then a smooth, dry finish.
Overall- an extremely impressive beer, can't believe how much flavor is packed into this "lighter" beer. IF this was available to me year round i'd but it all the time, this is sure to please seasoned drinkers and newbies alike. 853 charactersSteveB24, Nov 21, 2014

A nice fresh hop experience without the uber bitterness.  I would compare this beer to Deschutes Fresh Squeezed.  Very tasty and not overbearing.  Be careful, this one is easy to put away.

4.25/5  rDev -3.8%As soon as I heard of this I thought, "They're making a move on their neighbors 20-minutes up the freeway..." Tried some last week at my favorite local brew-pub Tustin Brewing Company, from a freshly tapped keg. Sure enough, first thing that hit my nose was the summer fruit, floral bouquet of their famous neighbor. This tastes very different from Lagunitas' other pale ales. The malt is way toned down compared to the familiar Lagunitas profile. I drank 3 pints and enjoyed them all. I passed up a freshly tapped (as I sat there) keg of Pliny to continue on with this fine brew. 
Tonight I'm setting down with a bottle but I'm not getting quite the same experience. There are hints of greatness here, but there is some room for refinement and fine-tuning. I'm getting a slightly sulfurous flavor here and that's not my favorite hoppy ale attribute. Still, I rate this very high and I hope the folks at Lagunitas continue in this direction. I'm a big Lag-Dog fan and I think their success is well-deserved. I look forward to variations/refinements of this recipe. This one is pretty Doggone Good already!
I'm a little puzzled by the BA score of 99 world-class rating; I don't think this belongs in the same category as Pliny or Heady. Yet. 1,242 charactersSomebody_Else, Nov 18, 2014

I think they are getting away with it being considered a Pale Ale because it clocks in at 7.5%, but that's another story. Not sure the exact differences between an IPA and a Pale Ale so not gonna be biased in reviewing it for its style. 
 ANYWAY...this damn beer is incredible. Citrus, pine, an incredible aroma, and it goes down way too smooth.  About best in its style and Lagunitas really needs to start brewing this thing as regularly, or hopefully more regularly, as Enjoy By. Cheers! 574 charactersaoampm, Nov 17, 2014

Some sweet grainy malt aroma are on the back end. Taste follows the nose with fresh hop flavors of citrus, papaya, mango, and passion fruit along with a hefty dank herbal hop finish. Mouthfeel has loads of hopy oils resins and moderate bitterness. Sweet malt and a medium body balance with moderate amounts of carbonation. Awesome harvest ale. 563 charactersFcolle2, Nov 14, 2014

Deep golden hue with a perfect clarity, a whole lot of suds that stick around and leave rings on the glass. The Mosaic and Equinox hops are dominant as their uniqueness comes through both in the nose and on the taste buds. Woody, earthy, piney, herbal, pithy, and floral all come from the hops. The use of fresh hops is amazing, seek this brew out now. 373 charactersJason, Nov 13, 2014

Better than before, bursting with citrus and tropical aromas, juicy orange and grapefruit flavors.
Smooth and juicy feel, moderate bitterness and easily sessionable. An amazing APA worth tracking down.
2014:
Whoa, this is suddenly the #8 APA? That's strange.
Pours a bright saturated orange tone, fluffy white foam that leaves behind some nice delicate lace. Brilliant clarity.
Pungent nose, reminds me of my fresh Columbus harvest a month or two ago. Funky sweet sticky Mary Jane, floral and citrus beyond that.
Tastes of sweet orange, grapefruit peel, bitter pine resin. Light bodied and easy to drink. If this is a fresh hop beer, it's one of the best on the market. It's a very good pale ale, though I've also had better. 735 charactersemerge077, Nov 11, 2014

The beer pours a lightly hazy, copper orange color, a handful of bubbles slowly rise to the top of the glass where a nice, fluffy, slightly off-white head rests, about 2 fingers high that has nice retention and leaves large swatches of soapy lace behind. The aroma is really pleasant, bright and juicy hops, dank and floral aromas behind the juicy fruit, sharp citrus and earthy pine round out a really nice hop bill that has only a hint of malt sweetness. The aromas resonate well on the tongue, dank grassiness and juicy tropical fruit, lightly floral underneath but really fruity and citrusy straight away with a bit of sticky, resinous pine flavor that is smoothed over by a nice counterbalance of sweeter malts. The mouthfeel is great, sticky, juicy and coating, carbonation is lower which adds to the juiciness though shows itself at the finish with a light crispness to compliment the dry sensation at the finish.
Verdict: A really fine wet hop beer from Lagunitas and definitely my new favorite hoppy offering from them. It fires on all cylinders and hits all the notes my palate likes and masks the ABV quite well, a definite home run and certainly a beer best enjoyed fresh. 1,258 characterskevanb, Nov 09, 2014

A: Pours deep golden amber with a frothy off white head that laces well.
S: Incredible! The second you pop the cap you get a wave of tropical fruit and citrus hop notes, lots of pineapple, a little grapefruit and orange, some dankness, and a little malt sweetness.
T: Follows the nose, delicious hop hit up front, pineapple, mango, sweet tangerine, a touch of grapefruit, some herbal notes and dankness, all well balanced with caramel malt sweetness. A light grassy/pine note can come out on the finish as it warms. A floral note also comes out on the finish and the after taste. 
M: Juicy,  a bit towards the heavier side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
O: Outstanding brew. If it wasn't 7.5% I'd session this all day. I still might. 792 charactersRyanK252, Nov 06, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -3.8%Oh boy.. Lagunitas sucks, sucks compared to this. Blew me away on tap. Thought it was an ipa. Really feels like an IPA with the pale ale base. Delightful. Fruity and full bodied. From the perspective of an IPA lover, this is the best pale ale I have ever had.
Update: Bottle is nice but maybe not as remarkable as tap. Outstanding as it is fresh but I could see a month really bringing the quaffability of this really well done IPA down. 438 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Nov 06, 2014

As close to perfection as a pale ale (forget that, any beer) can get. 
Drink this while it's fresh if you can find it, and I hope they keep the batches coming. 387 charactersPayDay, Nov 03, 2014

Popped the top and the aroma is pure awesome.  Had to take a sip to wet the whistle.
Pours a pretty clear yellow/straw color with a decent sized off-white head and tons of lacing.
I could smell this all day.  Piney and dank goodness.  No more description needed.
The taste is what I like an IPA to be...though this has some quasi-DIPA attributes.  Pine, dank, touch of malt, Pine Sol (don't ask), biscuit and plain awesomeness.  Really fresh.
It's got that Lagunitas feel which I'm sure you all know and love.
Overall this was more than expected.  Maybe we have the "new" West Coast Pale Ale here.  It seems some Pales are really starting to lack and then Tony and Crew kicks the style in the Ass and introduces something amazing.  Heading off to find more so this review be done. 859 characterskaseydad, Nov 02, 2014

A:Pours a clear golden with a huge, thick, dense, and greasy looking off-white head that slowly collapsed into a thick and lasting film. A ton of sticky, spotty lace was left down the glass. 
S: Amazingly fresh and delicious smelling nose. I get juicy notes of tropical fruit nectars, fresh squeezed tangerine, and orange sherbet, with a touch of fresh cut grass and pine needles. This beer reeks of hops. 
T: Follows the nose with dominating citrus, mango, papaya, and tangerine nectars. The finish has notes of pine sap, and yard trimmings, and the aftertaste is semisweet with fruit, and lastingly bitter. I’m not getting any trace malt, despite the label stating this is a pale ale. 
M: Medium body, clean, wet, and smooth mouthfeel, with splash and soft carbonation. Over overly resinous or chewy. Very bitter, but no harshness. 
O: Huge, crushingly fresh hop flavor, but still light enough in feel to be a pale ale. I don’t think they could cram anymore hop oils into this beer. I hope this becomes a regular offering. 1,078 charactersscottfrie, Nov 01, 2014

Smell - Fresh orange with hints of grapefruit, black pepper, pineapple and a trace of leafy mint character.
Taste - Follows the nose. Fresh orange essence is the predominant character with lesser notes of grapefruit and pineapple. Black pepper spice and a clean, minty and leafy character in the back end.  Finishes with light citrus pith and a long, lovely minty/citrusy aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - Light to medium in body with light, lively carbonation. Crisp, smooth finish.
Overall - Oh wow. Their New Dogtown is already one of the great APA's out there, but they figured out a way to top it. This is phenomenal! Fresh. Clean. Complex. Delicious! 866 charactersTheSixthRing, Nov 01, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%Lagunitas- Born yesterday. Tasted on draft 10/28 (24 hrs after release) 
Appearance (9.5/10): Clear, light straw colored. Thin silky head with light lacing in glass. 
Aroma (10/10): explosion of tropical fruit and citrus. Undifferentiated at first but very strong and pleasant aroma. 
Mouthfeel (9/10): very light body. Slightly less carbonation than anticipated, but later I believe it helps accentuate the bold hop flavor. Lingering bitterness that coats the tongue and demands another sip. Medium resin bitterness that is not overly drying. Very mild note of warmth on tongue and back of palate but never overwhelming. 
Taste (10/10): strong grapefruit with intense tropical fruit (guava, pineapple). As it warms, slight notes of grass and hay. Very little sweetness. 
Overall: (38.5/40) fantastic. Explosion of fresh hop flavor that consumes the senses. Light body and crispness entice me to keep the beer in mouth as long as possible before swallowing. I feel that I could sit and drink this all day, although at 7.5%, I'd have a bit of trouble walking out of the bar and getting home.

Pours a hazy orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, tropical fruit, and pineapple juice flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with fantastic citrus and tropical fruit forward hop characteristics that make this one quite tasty and super easy to drink.

Tastes like bittersweet pineapple juice. Yep that's delicious. Make no mistake, this one is for hop heads. Not much malt characteristic but wasn't expecting it. It's not very bitter, though. The hops are so juicy it's just delicious. It's got some pine and metallic characteristics blend in with the fruitiness. I love it. 400 characterssamtrillo, Oct 29, 2014

a: Pours light orange, honey color, very hazy, but not turbid and unappealing. 
s: big, juicy orange and pine. Peaches, plums, etc. Lots of fruit. 
t: taste follows, with a great balance between juicy fruits and earthy resin. Also, there is a good amount of crackery malt that lies in the background.

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%I have to admit that when I heard about this impending release, I thought it would be more gimmick than substance, but boy was I mistaken! Now first things first: this is not a well balanced beer. But who cares!? it's all about the hops, and how glorious they are in this beer. It's almost like drinking a fresh hop soda. 
I crack the bottle and immediately there's the floral fruity aroma blasting my nose. I pour it into a glass and those aromas only grow more intense. It is a beautiful dark golden with a tinge of orange. First sip: now here's the thing - it's not insanely hoppy, or really all that bitter for that matter. But those fresh hop flavors really shine through - Apricot, Peach, Mango, even some pleasant citrus tartness. Almost none of the typical herbal piney characteristics that I love so much. But that's ok. That's what makes this beer unique. And perhaps is why they call it a pale rather than an IPA. And try as I may, I don't detect a hint of malt. Clearly though, that is what is buttressing all these hops. It's just that I can't taste them over all these awesome hop flavors.
This is when I'm really pleased to be living where I do, right down the road from Lagunitas.
And I'm really hoping that this is a trend (much like Stone's "Enjoy By") that continues, and showcases the fresh characteristics of lots of different hop varietals. 1,362 charactershaulpass, Oct 28, 2014
