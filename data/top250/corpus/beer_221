Pours a deep ruby color , no head, looks like a fine liquor, tons of alcohol legs 
S- opens with a wild ride of port, cognac, bourbon, wet oak, raisins, plum, fig, molasses, brown sugar, green apple skin and melted caramel
T- opens up with plenty of sweetness, highlights of port, caramel/toffee, bourbon barrel, spicy oak, vanilla, brown sugar, caramalized apples, fig newtons, dark grapes, green apple skin, black strap molasses 
M- medium body that Coates the mouth, viscous, alcohol is there but not as strong as expected 
O- definitely pushes the boundaries of defining beer, I consider this to be up there with the finer liquors that I've had 697 charactersTreyliff, Jan 07, 2017

4.56/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.524 ounce bottle, 2015 Edition, bottle #17398, 28% ABV.  I've opened the bottle and shared some with friends a couple months ago, but figured I'd give it a proper review this time.  Served in a small tasting snifter (about an ounce or 2 pour), the beer pours a clear amber color with no head or lacing.  It's similar to drinking whiskey, when I swirl it around in the glass you can see the "legs" sticking to the side of it.  Aroma is rich, malty and boozy, the brew smells like vanilla, maple, molasses, dark fruit, wood, sweet spices and earthiness.  Taste is sweet and actually not as boozy as I expected.  There's caramel, maple, molasses, wood, dark fruit, sweet spices, vanilla, candied oranges, Sherry, and earthy/tobacco flavors.  There's also a lingering sweet boozy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit syrupy and slick with pretty much no carbonation.  I really like this brew, it's certainly a sipper.  Utopias is similar to drinking a bourbon or Scotch, it's pretty hard to compare this even to most craft beer.  Very unique and tasty brew, definitely worth trying if you get a chance to! 1,114 charactersbluejacket74, Dec 25, 2016

It is meant to be sipped and savored.  2008 version poured into a snifter.  The most complex smell and taste I have ever encountered in a beer with notes of bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, port and honey.

A - Pours a dark brown with no head.

T - An incredibly rich flavor of maple, raisin and booze.  A surprisingly strong beer even after resting for 5 years.
M - No carbonation, thick mouth feel.
O - I received this from a friend.  It had been opened once before, and I was worried about the condition.  No worries!  This beer is awesome.  I'm not saying it's worth what they charge, but it is very special.  One of a kind. 531 charactersspacecake9, Dec 22, 2016

I was in Greenpoint Brooklyn, visiting Torst (which is the best beer bar I've ever been to) and left torst to try a little brewpub a few streets over. I'm drunk, but anyway, I make it over and sample some of their brews and they all aren't impressive. Their beer menu says they have Utopia and the beer geek in me has to try it. 2oz. for $26. I had a 2012 batch and upon my first sip, I ran to the bathroom to puke. It tasted more like thick congac than beer. After puking, I returned and finished the glass. It was a very hard beer to drink and wasn't enjoyable in the least. However, I can brag to my friends that I tried a 29% abv beer. I would never get this crap again. 693 charactersTheRossness, Nov 08, 2016

Pours a beautiful dark brown color.  Great aroma with caramel, dates, figs, raisins, port, and Bourbon. There are so many great and complex aromas, that it is impossible to pick them all out.  Wonderful sweet taste with Bourbon, caramel, port, vanilla, figs, dates, raisins, dark cherries, and maple syrup.  This keeps getting better all the time. Full bodied, slick, with a slight alcohol burn, which is no problem at all, for a beer this delicious. 475 charactershardy008, Nov 05, 2016

Pours a nice clear amber colour, nose is boozy but loaded with burnt sugar, caramel, port and sherry notes. Flavor is incredibly complex with new flavors coming through after every sip. Molasses, caramel, vanilla, hints of oak, bourbon, sweet ice wine, raisins and figs. Reminiscent of a flat barley wine, and a fantastic sipper. When I picked it up I started having buyers remorse thinking I could've gotten a nice single malt for the same price, but now having tried it I would not hesitate picking up another bottle. A fantastic treat, and a flavor profile that would be enjoyed by any beer geek. 633 charactersandrenaline, Oct 10, 2016

3.39/5  rDev -23.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25I was excited for this beer the 2015 edition and I finally after three months after purchasing to give it a try with a friend. I only poured one ounce each for the both of us as I believe there are only 24 ounces in the bottle.  The first thing I noticed a very strong alcohol smell very much like a cognac or brandy and similar to the flavor/smell. I know it was 28% alcohol so I know what to expect. This was nothing to any beer in existence. For one there is no carbonation and it should be served at room temperature. Another is the overpowering sweetness and it feels a little gritty on my tongue. You can feel the beer going down to your stomach. The best way to describe the taste is imagine drinking molasses that had fermented. The thing is the sweet taste threw this one away for me. I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I have no regrets buying this rather expensive beer. It's something to try at least once in your life. I also heard from another friend to add two drops of water to my one ounce and that may improve the taste. I have yet to try this method. Overall I would not recommend as a curious purchase but to try at a bar or have a friend who is willing to share. On the plus side the bottle is pretty cool and each one is numbered for it is only available in limited quantity. 1,310 charactersDzman, Sep 20, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25The owner of Beer Mongers opened up a "bottle" of Utopias in honor of their anniversary, and so I finally was able to sample enough of it to rate.  I'm not sure how old this particular bottle was, but I don't believe it was a current version.
The beer pours a murky brownish amber color with virtually no head retention or lacing (the beer had minimal carbonation at best, so this was no surprise).  The nose is quite boozy, but even so, I picked up some vanilla, dark fruits and rum raisins.  The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely in this sweet, rich, extremely potent beer.  This beer is very soft, full and smooth on the palate, but with some noticeable heat on the finish from the alcohol.  However, the heat wasn't at all out of place, and seemed appropriate for this monster of a beer (drinking this is similar to the experience one encounters when drinking single malt scotch or XO cognac, except for the level of sweetness in this beer).  Also, while I've read that this beer is complete still, both this time and the time I had it previously at TJ's back in Paoli, Pa, there was something of a prickly sensation with the mouthfeel, leading me to believe there was some light carbonation in this beer.  The alcohol is otherwise very well integrated into the flavor profile, though obviously this beer is very, very boozy, and a little bit goes a long way.  Had roughly a 2 ounce pour of this beer, which I thought was more than sufficient (would not have wanted any more than that).  
An interesting beer to try for sure, but I can't imagine paying the freight to obtain a bottle on my own (as this really isn't the sort of drinking experience I want to replicate very often).  Regardless, it was a treat to try this at the Beer Mongers anniversary party (and was an extremely generous offering on the part of the owner). 1,847 charactersJohn_M, Sep 06, 2016

The layered aromas of Caramel Madeira, cognac and sweetness are immediately apparent. No carbonation and clear legs on the sides of the glass. Smooth, velvet richness easily covers the palate with
complex notes. This is truly a fine distilled beer to be enjoyed a little at a time with great friends! 429 charactersOompaMentor, Aug 07, 2016

Vintage 2015
28% ABV
Bottle #: 08626
Drank in honor of my completion of residency, June, 22nd, 2016.  
BeerAdvocate review #900, and beer #97 out of the former “Top 100” which I started several years ago.  I flew through the first 50, steadily moved through the next 25, slowly progressed through the next 15, and finally am crawling towards the finish with the the last 10 or so which have proven to be exceptionally difficult to obtain.  Its been a fun journey though!  Onto the rating:
A: Pours a dark mahogany with beautiful ruby hues when held to light.  There is no carbonation and thus no head or lacing, but alcohol legs cling to the sides of the glass. 4.75
S: The aroma is a huge, wonderful, boozy sweetness.  Boozy sweet grapes, like a strong Italian desert wine, charred oak bourbon characters, rich cognac and port wine.  Subtle bitter aromas to balance it out.  Layers of complexity.  Exceptional. 4.75
T: A wonderful combination of sweetness and booze.  Port wine, heavy caramel malt and toffee flavors, sweet cognac.  A bitterness and fusel alcohol character to balance out the sweetness.  I also get cocoa, charred oak bourbon notes, dark fruits, syrup-like sweetness, and candied sugar.  My only complaint is that the fusel ethanol may be a touch high at times which can mask some of the complexities.  That being said, its still phenomenal.  4.75 
M/D: Mouth feel is thick and velvety smooth coating the palate wonderfully.  There is no carbonation, as advertised.  Although its certainly booze at 28%, it doesn’t have the burn that most ABV equivalent spirits have.  Drinkability is remarkable for the ABV.  4.75
O:  A truly unique and special treat.  In the conversation with the best beers I’ve ever had.  5 1,818 characterszac16125, Jun 22, 2016

A lot of Carmel and Molasis spread on toast with slight plum.  Also has a maple syrup taste and scent.  Really sweet. Fairly smooth with a medium light body.  Warming in the back of your throat.  Very different and pretty good. 327 charactersdrdiesel9483, May 28, 2016
4.51/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Appearance – The beer poured a deep murky brown color with no visible carbonation.
Smell – The nose reminds me of a port with notes of dark fruits and sweet grains.
Taste – My initial impression is boozy caramel. Utopia is nutty, caramel with a definite warm alcohol presence. There is a mild licorice presence with dark fruits and perhaps some dark cherry toward the back. There is definitely a warm feeling that would make this feel great on a sore throat.
Mouthfeel – There is a definite thickness with low carbonation that allows the beer to stick to the back of the throat.
Overall – I still think this is more of a port than a beer. I am not a ticker, but I am glad to have had it. I probably won’t need to have it again. 743 charactersJohnnyHopps, May 25, 2016

The strong flavors are something not enjoyed by all, and I'm not really much of a hard liquor drinker.  So, it's hard for me to sip a beer, but boy is it needed.  This can quickly overpower all of your senses with it's up front flavor.  The recent tasting on May 7th was so good for my family, that my sister went to the same store I got this from and bought the only other bottle. 479 characterspezhead_79, May 19, 2016

4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5The myth, the legend, the beer...if you could call it one.  It's brewed like a beer, with beer ingredients, but believe everything you've read that says that this is more like a liquor, as far as drinking purposes go.
Look: Dark, clear, ruby red, leaves long legs down the glass.
Scent: Mainly cognac, old leather coat, oaky port, bourbon; hints of maple syrup, tobacco, prunes.
Taste: More leather, more tobacco, more cognac, a sweetness that is almost fruity, but not one fruit in particular - a dark one, toffee, sweeter on the sides of my tongue, faintly bitter on the top.
Feel: As thick as port or another dessert wine with nice legs down the glass, but with far more burn - the alcoholic tingle and numbness of a strong schnapps, but less aggressively hot or harsh than whisky.  Zero carbonation.
Overall:  This is a hard beer to rate.  As I said, it's incomparable to any other beer, so it's hard to rate it as one.  Compared to itself, based on pure enjoyment, I love it!  It's a bold, beautiful, complex spirit, and it's sure to be appreciated by fans of other spirits (if less so by beer drinkers).  I could easily see myself enjoying this as an after-dinner drink or just on a lazy evening sitting by a fire or enjoying a movie.
However, these are activities I am just as happy doing with a scotch, wine (fortified or other), or any number of other fine spirits, and I would be paying about a quarter the price.  So what is the justification for buying this?  Novelty - no more, no less.  It's the only beer like it, for beer aficionados.  It's the only beverage exactly like it in the world.  It's a work of art - sure, it's comparable to other, cheaper, easier-to-produce spirits, but this is so complex, both in its execution and in its turnout, that it's like comparing Ikea to handmade artisan crafts.  
Don't feel compelled to buy this if you are tight on cash; it won't change your life or affect your perception of beer forever more.  Don't buy this because it's the best drink ever - it's not, though it is a damn fine and unique one.  Buy it for the hype, prestige, the ability to feel like a boss, and the appreciation of drinking something unlike anything else, crafted with thought, soul, and love.  Enjoy it because you only live once. 2,266 charactersjmasher85, Mar 06, 2016

Poured from the Utopias bottle into a snifter, the beer is a deep, dark, vibrant, toffee coloring with no head. Oily slick in appearance. Nose of maple, molasses, tobacco, vanilla, bourbon, port wine, woody notes, and booze. Very rich, smooth, and warm aromas. Flavors are boozy and amazingly rich forward. Wow! Heavy and rich notes of vanilla, molasses, toffee, maple syrup, cherry, date, fig, apple, bourbon, port wine, cognac, and boozy heat. Holy shit this is good. Lots of characteristics open up in the glass as you go, layer after layer. Smooth, heavy, bold, and slick in mouth. The aftertaste has warmth, with a solid linger of the rich notes of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and molasses. The finish is slow and smooth, with a solid warmth and great linger. Amazing. Glad I finally got to try this one. 821 charactersGarthDanielson, Jan 29, 2016

2.83/5  rDev -35.8%look: 2 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.75Unattractive appearance, no head.  Brown liquid.  Looks more like bourbon.  Doesn't look like beer.  Super boozy heavy brown malt kind of aroma going on.   Maybe some toffee and caramel under the massively hot aroma.  
Taste finally got better, still plenty of burn from the heat, some brown sugar, molasses, cognac like orange gran marinier edge to the mouthfeel should you ever get passed the massive heat.  Drops some barrel aged flavors like oak and vanilla along the line too, although I don't know if this is actually barrel aged.  
The price point on this is a joke.   Tastes equal parts cognac, English barleywine and old ale.  No not equal parts.  More like Cognac 50%, bw 25%, old ale 25%. 701 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 21, 2016

Look: No carbonation, which I expected. Dark brown oak color. Seems slightly darker than bourbon.
Smell: Wonderful. Sweet barley. Strong oak. Sort of in between an english barleywine and a bourbon. 
Taste: Delicious. Tons of dark fruit. Whiskey. Has a port like aftertaste.
Feel: Little hot. Feels more like drinking whiskey than beer.
Overall: I've head this beer is overrated, but I really enjoyed it. It's a little too pricey I think. I would probably get a bottle for myself if it was under $100. However, price aside, this is great. Love the mix of bourbon and beer drinking feeling you get while having it. 726 characterskkleu357, Jan 20, 2016

Poured into Sam Adams Utopias glasses
Appearance:  Poured a caramel whiskey to cognac colored body, no head whatsoever, not surprisingly.  Alcohol legs like you can't believe when swirled in the glass
Aromas: Caramel-toffee sweetness, oak, bourbon, alcohol is definitely there.
Taste:  First sip...strong like a cognac; wouldn't even think this was a beer.  Toffee sweetness, some fruitiness and a strong oak presence.  The sweetness on the nose does not match the taste in my opinion.
Mouthfeel: Is full and has a strong alcohol warming presence that goes down easy and then that warming sensation comes back to the top  of the throat.
Overall:  Huge beer!  You get all kinds of flavors and aromas from this, but I wouldn't think it was a beer.  More of like a cognac or whiskey/bourbon.  Awesome beer and thanks to jzeilinger for sharing this one with me! 905 charactersjhartley, Jan 04, 2016

Oatmeal cookies, raisins, plump/boozy rehydrated cherries, and some wood. 334 charactersPHBoiler, Jan 04, 2016

4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Approx. 2 oz. pour from 2015 bottle (Bottle # 14857) into mini snifter.
Pours cloudy ruby-brown. No carbonation.
The nose is absolutely unbelievable. Tons of dark fruit/raisin, toffee, brandy, cognac, vanilla, molasses. I could go on but I'd be listing all of the aromas you can pick up from this all day. Definitely a strong dose of alcohol in there, but its actually more refined than I was expecting. 
Taste has essentially the same components going on as the aroma, but the alcohol heat is much more present. Crazy complex, but as expected the alcohol makes it difficult to drink more than a very small amount. This is definitely more akin to a fine port or brandy than beer.
Mouthfeel is very thick. Could come off a bit syrupy if not for the alcohol heat warming up the palate.
As often mentioned, this really isn't beer. That being said, I would highly recommend trying a pour of this if you can - it truly is an experience. 936 charactersemyers, Dec 26, 2015

But what stood out the most for me was how similar it was to some bruery offerings. Biased opinion, because I am a society member, but the bruery offers similar beers for roughly $40. Compared to the $400 price tag of Utopias. Definitely a pleasure and an honor to drink, but IMO not worth the price tag. 415 charactersJordanpaterson08, Dec 13, 2015

But that’s really all you need to understand just how unique this beer is. The smell invades your nostrils well before you get the glass up to your nose. The spirit aromas are strong and wonderful: cognac, bourbon, rum. The consistency is syrupy and thick. Vanilla, maple, and various barrel wood flavors can be detected in each sip. Warming alcohol rounds out each swallow. 446 charactersKevuas, Dec 03, 2015

Smells like a strong whisky and an oak barrel. 
Has a hint of cherry taste beneath the bite of the alcohol. 
Looks very dark, like a fortified wine. 
As for feel, the sting of the alcohol is noticeable when you hold it in your mouth for a second. 
It was great, and 1 oz was just enough. 331 charactersrobertjskelton, Nov 18, 2015

Aroma- Amontillado sherry, Rhum Agricole, molasses, fig, date, very subtle vanilla, booze heat, oak, oxidation, anise.
Taste- Hits hard with cherry, dried fruit, vanilla, molasses, port, brownies, tannic wood.
Mouthfeel- Viscous, flat, sweet. Not as thick as cough syrup, but thicker than an powerful sweet vermouth.
Overall- Worth the price tag? Not quite but damn close. Very happy to have a bottle sitting around, and it really is like no other beverage I've ever tried. 596 charactersnquigley16, Nov 18, 2015

3.93/5  rDev -10.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Funny story how I managed to get ahold of this one. Helping out a buddy move his grandfathers shit outta the house he's leaving and the guy throws us a dozen bottles of booze for the effort. Looking throigh the bottles, I notice one looks a bit...different and almost familiar. Low and behold it's a 2007 unopenes Utopias that he never drank due to buying it, ignoring it, and realizing it was a beer and foguring the thing was wayyyy passed its day.
So here we go. Into a snifter glass, with three other friends.
Look - Pours a crystal clear amber without even a touch of head. Not spots, no rings, not even a few bybbles come to the top. The carbonation is very low, bubbles appearing to die midway to the top of the glass. Lacing shall not be a factor as there was no head to retain in the first place.
Smell - I almost feel I shouldn't be reviewing this. It has a nose dominated by something I've yet to encounter in a beer. Lots of vanilla extract and wood are there, with the alcohol smelling brandy like in nature. Brown sugared baked bread fresh out of an oven.
Taste - The alcoholic heat delivers swift and immediate justice. It isn't as potent as I expected, but it does give off a nice burn. Vanilla and woods are the dominant flavors and the rest have dropped off into the everblack from where there's no going back.
Feel - Very full and very hot immediately subsiding as it sits. Carbonation is nonexistant and the woody levels consume the mouth like you just bit into a table.
Overall - In MY OPINION this one is nowhere near worth the price point. Certainly glad I could give it a try, since I sure as hell wouldn't have paid for this thing. It is good, yes. It is NOT $200-$??? A bottle good. Nothing is. I think the rating average on this one comes more from ridiculous hype with mythic level rarity over the actual qualities of the brew. 1,861 charactersRaime, Oct 09, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5When poured this beer was beautiful like that rainbow you see in a puddle in the grocery store parking lot from the drops of oil in it. Not being sarcastic...
The smell reminds me of that part in Harry Potter when Hermione is asked what the love potion smells like and she's overwhelmed by wonderful nostalgic aromas and notes that it smells different to everyone. That's how this smelled to me, but I'll try to be more specific: Light dark fruit (i know that sounds impossible but think yellow raisins), a little alcohol, and something like molasses but lighter.
It tasted like it smelled with the fruits and hint of alcohol and sweetness. It really reminded me of a very good fortified wine (like brandy/cognac)
The mouthfeel was that of a fine fortified wine as well; it was impressively full and "heavy" and rolls across the tongue like syrup (ok syrup is exaggerating, but it's very thick for a beer)
This is an amazing beer, but I wouldn't spend the money on it. I tried it from other people, though I would certainly consider chipping in for one. 1,053 charactersKentMills, Aug 31, 2015

2012 vintage.
Dark reddish-brown color, super viscous, obviously no head, oily coating all over the mini snifter. Smell of bourbony booze, caramel, brown sugar, touch of burnt marshmallow. Tasted like good booze combined with rich caramel, notes of molasses and vanilla, with some dark dried fruits. High booze % very well integrated. Thick, smooth mouthfeel, with hardly any burn. Just a small amount is plenty--especially considering the price--but I could definitely sit around and sip on this for a while. 552 charactersRifugium, Aug 05, 2015

I didn't know what to expect but I feel that this  beer exceeded my expectations and I really enjoyed it.  Smelled maple-syrup sweet with a lot of alcohol heat.  Taste was very similar, dominated by maple syrup and bourbon with a good burn going down.  Felt fairly thick for 28%ABV and it went down very smoothly, with no carbonation.  Can't wait to try this again! 403 charactersdomdomdomdom, Aug 03, 2015

With that said all attributes of this booze conconction truly are amazing to sip a few oz. worth.  Dark fruit, vanilla, slight smoke from wood, smooth finish like the finest of liquors.  If you ever get the opportunity to try it, definitely do so. 415 charactersbubseymour, Jun 14, 2015

  Is it worth the $? no.
  Is this beer? Probably not.
  Am I glad I tried this? Yes,
   1 inch pour - nose - Fortified wine, sherry, port. No resemblance to beer in terms of carbonation (zero) - or taste. Taste - sherry/brandy/port.
  Glad I tried but no way worth the cost, esp.  at retail. 311 charactersJebBeerFish, Apr 20, 2015

Appearance: Deep caramel with good clarity.
Aroma: Spices galore with a touch of alcohol.
Taste: A great mix of hot alcohol and a whole spice cabinet in one sip. Closer to top shelf liquor than beer.
Mouthfeel: Medium and tepid, which is no problem considering the ABV.
Final Thoughts: Amazing to have had the chance to try this. Albeit just one sip but I'd take another sip over half the mediocre craft beer taking up shelf space these days. Would I drink it again? In a heartbeat, given the opportunity. 591 charactersJamesMN, Apr 11, 2015
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42013 poured into a snifter. There was an aura around this bottle, a subtle glow; or, that could have been me glowing with excitement.
Look: Just like a ruby-black vintage tawny port. Thick "legs" around the glass. It looked sweet and thick. No head, though there shouldn't be because this isn't a carbonated beer. It didn't look like any beer I've had before.
Smell: Like over-dried raisins, slight hint of spices, some cinnamon. It smelled vaguely like dark rum, maybe a little like rum-raisen ice cream, lots of vanilla. Mostly it smelled like aged port. Slight hint of floral--maybe a tad spicy-- aromas consistent with Noble hops.
Taste: Aged port. Good thing I like port. The label said there's a hint of Noble Hops. There is no hop bitterness, some taste (very feint) consistent with Noble hops. It is a LOT of flavor. Take a port and boil/reduce it by 25% to strengthen the flavor. It's really malty-sweet, not due to it being under attenuated, but from the malt and lack of carbonation/carbonic acid to counter some of the maltiness/sweetness.  It tastes over the top strong. I liked it, but a little went a long way.
Feel: Really thick, almost like syrup. The thickness helped the flavor linger a long time.
Overall: the recommended 2-oz pour would have been too much for me. I had about an ounce and it was plenty. After that and the taste was becoming overwhelming.
I didn't pay full retail for this and I'm glad because it allowed me to be more impartial. I think sometimes we overrate things we pay a lot for because we want to reassure ourselves we got our money's worth. 
Keep in mind I'm reviewing the 2013 vintage and each vintage reportedly tastes different. 1,683 charactersGeeL, Apr 09, 2015

S - Definitely HOT, but tons of dark fruit/vanilla flavors - incredibly complex brown sugar, tobacco and wood
T - surprisingly smooth and awesomely warm, completely coats the throat with sweet molasses and deep and rich sugars - overwhelmingly complex - like a smooth brandy  - I'm not doing it justice for how many flavors are present here.
F - raisen/dates/prunes form a thick layer on the palate, warm alcohol but not overly hot like a shot - this is cool
O - hard for me to rate it against the IPAs I just consumed right before, just completely different but absolutely happy to have been given a chance to try it. The 2oz pour was the right amount for a night cap. 752 charactersM_chav, Apr 06, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A dark amber / golden brown liquid, thick, with no carbonation and no head. It looks a lot like a darker brandy, with the alcohol sticking to the sides of the glass when you move it around.
The smell is incredibly rich, something between a bourbon, a cherry and a brandy (as far away from beer as I have ever smelled), blended with caramel, vanilla, raisins and, of course, alcohol, especially right after the pour.
As was expected, the taste is quite complex. Rich caramel sweetness up front, together with vanilla, toffee, maple syrup, notes of bourbon, a bit of wood and much, much more. Figs and other dried fruit right after that - raisins and dried plums - as well as dark cherries. A very nutty aftertaste, with different flavours unfolding after every sip.
The body is viscous and thick, and the alcohol is at 29%, yet this is incredibly pleasant to drink, much more than any spirit that I have tried. 909 charactersMarius, Feb 11, 2015

Aromas of port and bourbon with a hint of caramel sweetness. Tasted sweet and oaky with lots of heat on the back end (which at 27% seems obvious) but it was definitely not overwhelming. After not having any Utopias for years I was really, really impressed with this iteration. 374 charactersswanfungus, Jan 19, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'm not sure what I did to earn some positive beer karma, but I was at a going away party for a coworker on Friday night and suddenly the head of our company shows up with a brand new bottle of 2013 Utopias [record scratch]. I didn't realize before that the bottle itself is actually ceramic, with a metallic lacquer or something on the outside. Poured into a classic Old Fashioned glass, since--let's face it--Utopias is technically beer, but drinks more like a fine spirit.
Appearance (4.25) - Pours a deep ruddy brown that brings to mind brown sugar and molasses. The liquid has a fair amount of haze in suspension, with the edges taking on a more golden brown hue. There is zero head formation, partly because of the nature of the beer, but also because I poured it ever so gently so as not to be the jerk who takes an overly-generous pour. Lacing is completely nonexistent.
Smell (4.5) - A wonderfully rich blend of sweet aromas comes wafting out of the glass--caramel, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, graham cracker and even some notes of sherry and port are all present. Alongside the sweeter overtones is a complementary base of dried leather and moist tobacco as well as some nice woody notes to prevent the aroma from being cloyingly sweet.
Taste (4.75) - Upon first sip, I can't decide if I'm more stunned by the decadent flavors or the fact that I can't believe how easily it drinks for a near-30% abv drink. I've had beers with a far lower alcohol content that were harsher to consume. Many of the same sweet notes from the aroma are again present in the taste, with emphasis going to molasses, vanilla and port wine. I also get some nice hints of brandy-soaked cherries that I didn't pick up on the smell as well as some candied plums. I have to say, the subtle notes of fruit are really what kick the taste up a notch from the aroma. It adds a layer of complexity that makes it dangerously easy to drink this extreme beer. Drinking something with 30% alcohol that costs as much as this one shouldn't be so easy.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Body is on the full side of medium, with a nice viscous, mouth-coating feel that sticks with you and allows you to savor the blend of flavors long after the drink has been swallowed. Carbonation is extremely low--for all intents and purposes, it's nonexistent.
Overall (4.5), what can I say about this beer. Prior to having it, it's one of those beers that it's easy to remain aloof about--the price point is so over the top that thoughts of "how good could it really be?" come naturally. I've always wanted to try it--mostly for the novelty of a 30% "beer"--but also recognized that it would surprise me if the opportunity never presented itself, given that I wouldn't go out of my way to procure a bottle and probably would balk at the cost if one ever crossed my path. Now that I've had it, I can honestly say that I would actually have to talk myself out of buying a bottle if I came across one, and that in spite of it's high rating on BA, I think it might actually be underrated. It's just an amazingly well-done and envelope-pushing beer. 3,095 charactersLambicPentameter, Jan 12, 2015

This beer is a definite experience and I'm stoked to have had the opportunity to try something I wouldn't have bought for myself it's an incredibly smooth beer at that high of an abv that is surprisingly drinkable and to me tastes like a world class barley wine that had been age in bourbon barrels but the bourbon flavor faded away 785 characterskerry4porters, Jan 10, 2015

Location: Peconic Beverages
Bottle/Draught: Utopias Decanter Bottle
Glassware: Riedel SA Utopias Snifter (Aproximately 2oz. Pour)
Appearance: Amber/Brown with ruby highlights. Allows some light in which brightens to ruby but is always difficult to see through. No carbonation, of anykind, anywhere. The beer leaves a viscous alcohol ring around the glass whenever sipped. Smooth long legs find their way back down.
Aroma: The most complex beer I have ever inhaled. Absolutely closer to cognac then beer. I’ll take a stab at this. Caramel, molasses, maple syrup, raisons, prunes make up a portion of the sweetness. In the back the alcohol aromas really kick in with sherry, port, and an ethanol alcohol. The wood helps ties the flavors from the sweet to the alcohol but I’ve never felt like I’ve missed so many descriptors in my life. 
Flavor: Maple sugar, dark fruits (raspberries, cherries, raisons, plums). A slight oxidation flavor moves us from the sweet to the alcohol content which is like well barreled apple brandy and/or port. A Whisky wood like flavor helps to remind us of this beers age. There is an umami flavor of soy sauce that can be found in beers this big that have oxidized. 
Mouthfeel: Hugely bodied. The sweetness coats my tongue while this beer, clocking in at 29% provides such wonderful alcohol warmth starting in my throat and quickly working its ways to the back of my eyes. Zero carbonation. 
Notes: Served at room temperature.
The question is- “Is it worth the $200+?” and my answer is going to be absolutely yes. If you understandably can’t afford the decanter try a $20 two ounce pour at a bar. Frankly, that might be the best way to try it. If you do get the decanter it’s got to be something you share, it has to be conversational; a sign of what great things beer can be at one of its outliers. 1,857 charactersKornWallace, Nov 16, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.7%2013 bottle, purchased from a neighborhood liquor store in Leominster, MA.
Pour is viscous, syrupy, caramel colored. Zero carbonation as you probably know.
Aroma is booze and maple syrup. 
Flavor is complex:  syrup,  bourbon,  tobacco,  caramel,  dark fruit. Leathery aftertase. A little alcohol,  but amazingly smooth for the 27%+ abv. Mouthfeel is thick as expected and stays on the tongue. 
Overall,  this is a must try and, for me,  lives up to the hype. It's just a sipper,  so your 2oz pours sould last a while! 521 charactersarlo19, Nov 08, 2014

Like an aged 120 minute IPA, with a HoTD Matt, and a Bruery BBA Melange #3, and some cognac tossed in for good measure; something everyone should experience at least once, if not buy it for future delights. 368 charactersstouts4me, Oct 04, 2014

If you like BA big beers with an absolutely smooth, warming finish, this is your beer.  From nose, to taste, to finish, this beer is amazing.  Enjoyable best in 2 ounce increments, because the beer is not carbonated, you can just re seal it to enjoy the rest another day.  And after only getting thought about half a bottle in 2 years, it easily holds up, only losing a slight smoothness over the years. 523 charactersmrn1ceguy, Sep 27, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +4.8%I was lucky enough to taste the most recent two releases (2012 & 2103) side by side, and I have to say that the addition of KMF made a huge difference. It definitely added a lot of extra fruit and sour notes that seemed a bit more muted in the 2012. It's one of those brews that's worth the investment for any beer geek out there, if for no other reason than to say that you've had it. A co-worker of mine still had one from 2008 and we tried some of that recently. The more vibrant notes in fresher batches mellowed out, giving way to more robust bourbon and port notes. Overall a fantastic brew. 597 charactersmr_monch, Sep 26, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2%Beer carries no head; it's an extremely clear, caramel-colored glass of spirits.
The aroma lets you know this is not here to mess around; there is no hiding 29% ABV. An incredible depth and complexity of flavors are found in the nose: caramel, brown sugar, port wine, vanilla, coconut, fruit bread, wood, whiskey, butterscotch - in no particular order or strength.
Flavor is just as nuanced and deep. The alcohol can't help but contribute a dry heat to the taste, but that does nothing to mask the incredible wealth of flavors. Port wine and whiskey seem to be the dominant overall character, but everything in the nose - and much more - is present.
Mouthfeel: syrupy, medium, hot. Is it too obvious to proclaim this a sipping beer?
This isn't a regular beer.  I wouldn't want this if I were in the mood for a beer. But if I wanted spirits, and decided to crack this open instead for a special occasion?  This is deeper and more complex than any whiskey or bourbon I've had straight, and could easily meet your needs for that kind of a drink. Despite the price tag, I can now easily see myself buying one of these to crack open on special occasions, or even for a special nip before bed. 1,191 charactersRoguer, Sep 24, 2014

3.8/5  rDev -13.8%Appearance: a reddish mahogany color. no foam or head as expected. legs of alcohol along the glass as you swirl it around. fairly strong clarity. 4/5
Smell: very reminiscent of various spirits. its got a port like sweetness, strong wood qualities like a bourbon or scotch, and a strong alcohol presence. other notes such as molasses and maple syrup are there but are overlain by the boozy and barrel qualities. 3.75/5
Taste: opens up with some sweetness, caramelized sugars and maple syrup and toffee. the middle is full of wood. end is full of booze. 3.75/5
Mouthfeel: drinks like a spirit. kinda a lighter body but a bit of a burn and plenty of warmth. 3.75/5
Overall: I had huge expectations for this but felt a but let down. I think its a bit too far over the line to a spirit and lacks what I truly like about beer. Overall still a cool thing to share with a friend and a good experience, especially with an old triple bock next to it. 945 charactersSportsandJorts, Sep 10, 2014

About 3 oz poured into Utopias glass. About halfway done with the bottle at this point.
A) Dark, dark brown, like rich leather. No carbonation. No head. 
S) Port wine, cherries, leather, some carmelized malts.
T) It's kind of like port wine, but it isn't. It's kind of like cognac, but it isn't. It definitely retains a malted character which keeps it in the beer category. Roasted malts, port wine grapes, cherries, and yeah, some alcohol.
M) Incredibly well-balanced but obviously as full-bodied as you'll find a beer. Impossible to avoid the alcohol burn, but it works the way a cognac works.
There's nothing like it. Is it worth it? Who can say? It's a unique masterpiece. I'll probably never buy another one but I'm glad I did it once. 829 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 05, 2014

I cant read my notes only remember what vintages stood out. 2013 with the little window in the bottle was actually my favorite, I expected to like the older ones more. 2005 and 2009 are marked as the next best. Of course none of them held a candle to Millennium, the whole group agreed with that. Flavors were all big sweet malt, toffee, lots of warm vanilla, old tawny port.The 2013 or whatever the most recent bottle was had more developed rich flavors and not as cloying on the tongue. A good experience. 590 characterskayalla, Jul 04, 2014

4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Happy dad's day to all the rest of the lucky dads out there. 2012 10th anniversary bottle that I bought for just under $200 with taxes on release from Total Wine in Seattle and in the cellar until today.
Poured into the Riedel glass that came with the bottle (by mail). It's a pretty stupid little glass, tbh, but it's kind of a ...maybe not stupid, but let's say an eccentric beer that I haven't been particularly anxious to try more than as a curiosity. What the hell though, a great dad like me deserves a $200 beer on dad's day, right?
Appearance. Pours a deep ruby amber, almost burgundy colour. Fairly clear but hard to see through being so rich. Looks almost luxuriously thick as it's poured, no head whatsoever. Not sure how to rate this beer with hing to compare it with, but it looks pretty good so we'll just go with that.
Smell. Booze of course, and lots of it. Lots if port like smells and but not bad like a heavily oxidized beer, definite fruity esters. Some brown and burnt sugar, a touch of real maple, some bitter wood (is bitter a smell?). Very interesting and despite the heavy booze I keep going back for more. Getting more sweet caramel and maple as I get past the booze. 
Taste. Sweet with those port like flavours hitting first, a light acidity that I wasn't expecting helps with the high sugar content. Fruity esters again, some nice bitter wood, caramel and just a touch of maple. The woody notes really last in the mouth with a nice, almost spiciness going on from the booze I'm guessing ...maybe more of a sensation than a flavour there but I'm okay with it. Very boozy but not what I would expect at 29%
Mouthfeel. Quite thick and slick, a bit sticky on the lips once the booze evaporates. Not hot in the mouth but very warming in the throat and tummy. I can see how people could come to enjoy the harder stuff while drinking this one.
Overall. An experience. Yep. Probably not as good an experience as a $200 meal, but I will enjoy this many times over the coming months so that's how I'll look at this one. Not sure if I'd buy this one again but by the time this bottle is gone I'm sure I'll know. 4's across the board for a rating because it's very interesting, quite enjoyable, but in a league of it's own in every way. 2,258 charactersRutager, Jun 16, 2014

This beer may be better with aging, but when I had it, the booziness was just too much. It was almost cloyingly sweet. The mouth feel and look were awesome; however, the smell was overpoweringly boozy. The price point is also something I wasn't thrilled about - it was over $30 for a small tulip pour (~4 oz). 
I'd try this again if I knew it had been aged for a few years. I think the sweetness would really be tempered, which would allow some of the flavors to come to the forefront of the beer. You know there has to be something pretty wicked about this beer because of its price and rarity - I just didn't get it when I tried it. 749 characterspsumjl269, May 11, 2014

I've taken small hits from Utopias on a couple previous occasions, but never enough to do a proper review. Well, thankfully, a tasting yesterday took a couple of extreme turns, and "midwest-sized" pours of this bad boy were offered up.
It was quite good. I remember an earlier vintage (like 06, maybe?) having a pronounced whiskey burn. It might be that this vintage is mellower, or it also might be that barrel-aged beers have gotten so extreme lately that what seemed painful and intense in 2007 was, by 2014, as smooth as grape laffy taffy.
Anyhow, if you're expecting some kind of Tactical Nuclear Penguin-style gimmick, you're going to be pleasantly disappointed. This is it's own thing, yeah (as has been said a million times already), but it't not some unpolished mess that's being sold simply for the audacity of selling something so gigantic. 
It tastes... kinda like if you could make cognac out of beer. Fruit cognac amplifies and embitters the fruit, producing a hyperevolved and lightly burny version of, say, orange juice, where the sweetness hasn't gone away so much as it's lapped itself. So take the sweeter pale malt nodes favored by Sam Adams and then amplify them so much they retain only their barest essence. And the somehow, remarkably, make it pleasurable to drink. 1,307 charactersmynie, May 06, 2014

There are no hops, no malts, no carbonation. Not sure if the beer should be penalized for this, but it definitely deserves to be mentioned.
The liquid is rather sticky and thin, so appearance and mouthfeel are nothing to write home about. But the smell will really blow you away--rum, warm port, and can I discern the maple syrup too? Aroma is powerful and warm. The taste follows the nose--warm, somewhat sweet but at the same time somehow powerfully savory, incredibly easy to sip yet this beer will creep up on you, with its 29 abv.
On the whole I've really enjoyed trying this beer. It is totally pushing the envelope of what beer can be. I don't think that beer culture is there yet, but maybe this is where it is going. 822 charactersAmyfaceNYC, May 01, 2014

The only minor negative for me is that it is syrupy and thick not like traditional beer at all. I do get that this is stretching the definition of what beer is and I like that spirit but I kinda like beer where it is. This is the port wine version of beer and deserves it's own category and that is what Sam Adams has created here, a new category of beer. 501 charactersDelco, Apr 30, 2014

Flavor is similar but less boozy than the nose - surprisingly easy to drink, especially considering the ABV, but definitely a strange brew. Very interesting. 372 charactersljthiesse, Apr 29, 2014

Tastes like a dryish tawny port. This is nice since port is great but can be a little too sweet. In Ontario this goes for about $150, and for that price I would rather grab a Lagavulin or Highland Park. 351 charactersAugustusRex, Apr 28, 2014

I suppose a case could be made for this as a can, given all the metal encasing this copper kettle replica. One hard to come by offering for this brewery around here, as they are indeed repped locally, but finally I got my hands (for a mere ~150 dollars) on one. My infant son spent his first birthday today out and about with his mom, and even visited dear 'ol dad at work this afternoon. Now that he's well and down, here we freaking go.
This beer pours a (what, a simple cap? no cork, really?) mostly clear, dark red-brick amber hue, with zero head, zero lace, and zero sound, save the mild glugging of the er, liquid, as it hits the glass - weird, man. Not a particularly appealing looking offering, IMHO.
It smells of ridiculously pungent maple sap, port fruitiness, sherry Flor, vanilla and caramel that have spent serious time in a Kentucky whiskey barrel, tanned leather, more rather tannic warmed red wine, rum-filled holiday chocolates, and a slight musty funk, one that seems more capable of cutting through the mire than any hops in the mix. The taste is more decadent and super-heavy caramel malt and its bourbon barrel equivalents, thick natural vanilla, maple doughnuts, rich port and fruity sherry, a reduced brown sugar rum booziness, concentrated sour stone fruit, hints of bittersweet cocoa, and a somewhat surprising leafy, musty hoppiness.
The carbonation is obviously not the main point of this affair, as it is pretty much unheralded and non-existent, the body a sickly viscous, thick and chewy, full as full can be weight, and smooth like your favourite single malt (and ethereally creamy, by the same metric). It finishes sweet, hell to the yes, but with a noticeable attempt at moderation, the fruit, some latent, but still weak-ass funk, and yes, hops doing enough to keep me from scraping both my tongue and teeth at the same time.
A whole lot of acclimatization is required to actually get into this one at first - but once you're past that initial palate gang-bang, the teetering balance of malt, bourbon, port, rum, funk, maple, sugar, and hops starts to make more and more sense, and that's only due in small part to the 54-proof alcohol.  Utopias is one of the few end-points of beer fandom, and is almost worthy of its sticker price (I'd say shelf tag, but, heh, it never actually made it there, around here). My only real beef here, is that I can only make an educated guess as to how much I have left in the 'bottle' - I'm thinking at least 16oz, as this kind of thing surely engenders more writing than imbibing, eh? 2,593 charactersbiboergosum, Mar 30, 2014

S-I am shocked to find that the alcohol is very well masked in the aroma. Oh, it's boozy but I was expecting it to smell like moonshine or something. It's really smells like a thick liqueur or cognac. Super concentrated dark fruits and rich dark sugars.
T-The alcohol doesn't hide as easily here. It's just like taking a shot of liqueur. Plums and raisins coated in brown sugar, burnt toffee and molasses. Woodiness and maple syrup. Cocktail bitters. Finishes like a shot of cognac.
M-Full, flat and hot. Head rush! Probably should have tried this earlier on in the night. Syrupy and cloying it it clean out quickly.
O/D-Finally tried it. It's like no other beer I've tried. Clearly worth a sample but I would never even think to toss out so much coin for a whole bottle of this. 985 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 26, 2014

A: Medium brown, like maple syrup. No head, no sign of carbonation.
S: Sweet and malty, with aromas of Molasses, Raisin and brown bread. 
T: Malty, smooth at first with tart cherry and molasses. Caramel and bread flavor follow. Alcohol finish. 
M: Syrupy and thick in body. No carbonation. Lots of heat from the abv. 
O: Overall good, although less than amazing. Pretty smooth considering the abv. Tasty but not necessarily outstanding, however an awesome experience to share with beer buddies. 549 charactersBeejay, Mar 17, 2014

Poured 3 ounces into a Tulip glass.
Clear Amber liquid with beautiful alcohol legs when swirled in the glass.
Not too thin and not too thick in the glass. Looks really good. 
Nose is robust. Big sweetness, dark mulled fruits, oak and barrel character, leather, tannins, pepper and dark malts and of coarse alcohol.
Taste follows the nose really well with a very nice mouthfeel however it could have been fuller given the alcohol. Still quite an experience. 
Has to be one of the best Sam Adams Beers that I'm aware of. 
This one is a real treat if you like big boozers and you can find it! 738 characterscooch69, Mar 17, 2014

Murky dark brown, big alcohol legs of a spirit. Burnt brown sugar, toffee, caramel, booze, melange of spirits - brandy, bourbon, port - and toastedbut one note, each does not jump out. Very boozy but drinkable - nice fuller mouthfeel, kind of sticky.
Been wanting to try this but at that price point you could land a world class bourbon alone, so very hesitant. Shared a pour from someone - very good but not worth it. 425 characterstimc100, Mar 12, 2014

A: Dark brown with undertones of yellow; similar to cognac. Thick greasy lacing.
S: Dark fruit, chocolate and port/sherry notes.
T: Turkish apricots, dates and some bitter chocolate. Resembles a combination of Sherry, Cognac and a stout. 
M: Thin like a sherry liquor, not like any other beer to date. Fully and extremely balanced.
O: Well worth the experience and splitting a bottle or slow sipping one is worth the price tag, especially at ABV of around 29 and the age and blend that make up this beauty. 599 charactershillvt4me, Mar 02, 2014

Poured into unlabled snifters today, 2/22/2014 to cap off our BCBS Variant night. This review is based on the 2012 version which I highly preferred to the 2013.
App- Light copper body, no head, no retention, no lacing. Surprisingly light for a beer that is so strong.
Smell- Decadent port, molasses, maple syrup, toffee, caramel. Very, very sweet and intense. As you'd expect, there is also a ton of boozy solvent alcohol that I personally think detracts from the overall nose.
Flavour- Port, maple syrup, tons of toffee, a bit of butterscotch, caramel, a little bit of oak. This is a very sweet and very boozy brew that is quite complex in the sense that every sip brings something different to the forefront.
Mouthfeel- Thin bodied, flat with zero carbonation (as expected, though) and quite boozy. Not my cup of tea, but it is what it is advertised to be so I'm not going to dock it too much.
Overall- 2012 &gt;&gt; 2013 which smelled/tasted a lot like the Chinese sorghum whiskey that my dad likes to drink that is incredibly disgusting and makes me nauseous. The 2012 version is so decadent, sweet and boozy; it is definitely the superior vintage of the 2. So if you find a 2012 and want to buy it, go for it. Can't give that same affirmation for the 2013. 1,359 charactersStevedore, Feb 23, 2014

A. A translucent dark amber. A slick appearance, similar to that of a liquor. Legs prevalent. 
S. Strong aroma. Carmel and toffee. Brown sugar. Dried cherries and hazelnuts. Booze. 
T. This starts off very similar to the nose but not as sweet. Plums and figs with agave nectar notes. The booze is prevelant but not overwhelming or hot. Excellent balance. 
S. Super smooth. No carbonation. Oily. Laquory. 
O. This ale totally surprised me in how smooth it was compared to the abv. I could drink a much bigger pour. This was really good and the price is very hefty, but certainly worth a try and dare I say, I would have this again. 648 charactersmacher0, Feb 09, 2014

Appearance - Deep ruby brown. Leggy and flat. Looks like a liqueur.
Smell - Really nice, but boozy as hell. No surprise, I guess. Tons of maple syrup. Lots of red wine. Bourbony aromas singe the nostrils.
Taste - Sweet red wine and maple sugars. Brown sugar. Maple lingers on the tongue. Some deep chocolate and dark fruits behind the sweetness.
Mouthfeel - Big, boozy, and flat, but none of that is offensive for what this is. Drinks like a cognac or a port. It's quite sugary, though, which separates it from it's distilled counterparts.
Overall - Few beers match the over-the-top descriptors used on their bottles, but this one does. Extremely complex. 717 charactersAlieniloquium, Feb 02, 2014

I thought the bottle was empty, was a pleasure to discover it was not!
About 1 ounce poured from a 2013 bottle into a Glencairn whisky tulip, enjoyed at room temperature.
Appearance: Well, this doesn't look like beer, but it does look like a fine liquor. Dark, translucent amber, hints of rose. No head, of course, no lacing, of course.
Smell: Cognac, sherry, lots of dark fruits. And so much alcohol heat it's incredible. I feel like if I had more experience with whisky and other fine liquors like that, I'd be better equipped to review this "beer."
Taste: I'm getting lots of raspberry type flavors in here. A slight fruity tanginess that, together with the dark fruit flavors, tastes like raspberry. A good deal of woodiness, and of course plenty of alcohol burn. The finish is very sweet, probably from the maple. I think I can see why this is compared to sherry and cognac and such, even though I have no knowledge of those. The whisky my roommate has here is aged in sherry casks though, and this smells and tastes similar to that. 
Mouthfeel: It burns from the heat. This is why I stick to beer instead of liquor. Completely flat, of course, which is to be expected.
Overall: Well I'm definitely sticking to beer and not liquor, but for a hybrid between the two this was quite good. I doubt I'll buy full bottles of it very often before I win the lottery, but it is very nice to have every now and then. 1,569 charactersWTKeene, Jan 22, 2014

A very memorable beer and of course unlike anything I've had before (having never broken about 16% ABV before). 
The nose is almost full sherry / port for me, with an extra dash of bourbon heat. Lots of dark fruit and rich sweetness. 
The taste is sticky honey, rich sherry sweetness with red wine tannins, some molasses and dense malts. Balanced with a bit of heat. A great sipper, similar to how I'd expect to enjoy a fine port or cognac, though I am embarassingly uneducated in those elixirs. 612 charactersJasonLovesBeer, Jan 18, 2014

A - Brilliantly clear deep copper color. Persistent legs lace the side of the glass. No head, but none expected.
S - Where to begin? Toffee, vanilla, oak, leather, plum, fig; the list goes on. One of the most complex aromas of any "beer" I've had. Only negative is a bit of hot alcohol.
T - Even better than the aroma. Sweet nondescript malt, toffee, treacle, woody undertones, complex dark, dried fruit, hints of spice. Sweet alcohol, but not hot or unpleasant in any way. Sweetness seems balanced by a bitterness, but doesn't seem like hops. Alcohol also helps balance the sweetness. 
M - Full body but not at all cloying. Alcohol played a major role in drying out and balancing the finish. No carbonation. Just like a fine brandy.
O - Outstanding! Sorry I waited so long to open this one (or maybe not!). 930 charactersCASK1, Jan 01, 2014

M-medium to heavy, no carbonation but somehow no alcohol burn. The heat is there but no burn.

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5such an iconic brew and Jason doesn't even write a review? but he gives it a 5 of 5?
i'm skeptical, but here goes... looks like a brandy in my little Remy Martin snifter... so THAT's what 'legs' means, huh??? dang.... smells indescribably awesome. some bourbon barrel, or SOME kind of barrel.... smells like it's gonna be smooth. heck, I paid THAT much for a bottle of beer??? I know i'm an idiot, and I was drunk when I requested the hold on it.... let's see what this is going to taste like.... but that smell.... that really is exquisitely beautiful... I honestly do not like most of sam adam's brews... they all taste the same. strong alcohol nose, but smooth... almost a bit like rubbing alcohol...
on the tongue... easy! sweet. silky smooth. as it warms from the heat of my tongue it begins to taste a bit maple-y. sugar. maple syrup. cane sugar. perfect on pancakes. as it passes the tongue and drains down the throat there is some alcohol flare but it's not unpleasant. this is an awesome sip to be enjoyed. more so than a great whiskey, I think.... legs still rolling slowly down the side of the snifter. I am really so thoroughly impressed with this. why cannot others produce this? does the price have to influence the perception? I don't think it does here. this is really insanely smooth and sweet. the entire mouth is happy! there simply is no burn. no bitterness. $200 per bottle is extraordinary but I had to try it. it easily surpassed my expectations. how can this be 29% ? wow. if you have the cash, and you wanna try the good stuff, then do it. there is still a level where the 'legs' are still waiting to drop down from.... wild. 
I am thoroughly impressed. beyond any expectations. an entirely different experience in taste, and I have been doing some serious research in beer this last year or so. got a bottle of Elijah Craig 12 waiting to drown out the expected yukkiness, but honestly I think it may be the other way around... this truly is nectar. I have to give this one all 5s and it is NOT due to the price. this is truly an elixir to be experienced... 2,082 characterspkalix, Dec 15, 2013

The beer pours smooth with no carbonation, which I now know is to be expected with such a style of beer. It tastes more like a spirit but has a smooth caramel tone. I think this is a great beer for every beer enthusiast to try. It has a great taste as well.
Finding this beer is a search in its own. I managed to get a bottle of the 10th anniversary edition which, because it ages, I am saving until a very special moment. 511 charactersghonickel, Dec 06, 2013

Pour thick... cognac like not even close to a beer.
No head but legs of a fine wine.
Boozy nose with hints of port and cognac. Ages just as well as this bottle was opened quite some time ago... didn't loose it's character, only got better.
Raisin, carmel and almost tawny port notes.
Simply amazing! 353 charactersYardGlass, Dec 05, 2013

It resembles more an expensive brandy than a can of suds, Utopias pours a rich ruby hue that leaves a clean sheen along the edge of the glass. There's absolutely no evidence of carbonation, this truly "has legs" as you swirl it in a snifter.
The aromas a vastly complex and intense but one must allow this to air out and warm slightly. Once the alcohol dissipates you get raisin, prune, molasses, maple, brandy, port and wine.
This keeps some flavors of a Strong Ale, as it is described. I found sherry, port, raisin, sweet prunes, creme, cognac, grape, caramel and maple on the tongue. This has some amazing diversity but tastes more like a liquor than a beer.
The feel is very smooth, easily sweet and spreads a light warmth through the chest. 
I saved this for my 500th review and truly picked a good one for it. Thanks Jeff, I really did appreciate it. 946 charactersKYGunner, Dec 02, 2013

A: Very dark brown. No head or lacing.
S: Molasses, raisin, caramel, figs, orange citrus.
T: Tastes like it smells. Complex combination of candied fruit components, and orange liqueur. 
M: Thick and syrupy. Boozy, yet so smooth. The nose infiltrates the nasal cavity and clings to the inside of your nostrils. Slightly sweet finish clings to the palate.
D: Sipping experience.
Atmosphere is nice. Fruit and candied sweet nose. Flavor follows suit. Overall, this is a great quaff. 544 charactersbmwats, Nov 29, 2013

Pours a sort of transparent brown with no head, no carbonation, and no lacing. Looks like liquer in every way.
Smells very boozy, with hints of brown sugar, maple syrup, and red wine.
Tastes amazing, but it is so strong. The aforementioned flavors shine through. Tons of maple syrup here. Some oak from the barrel aging, a bit of vanilla. There is a strong alcohol burn throughout each sip. Small sips must be taken to appreciate this "beer."
The mouthfeel is great- sticky, incredibly full bodied (what did you expect with a 29% beer?).
Everybody needs to try this beer once- it represents the pinnacle of how far you can take beer and still keep it tasty. 739 charactersGreesyFizeek, Nov 27, 2013

A: Dark. Looks like a deeply aged cognac.
S: Big chocolate whiff. Smells like a chocolate flavored port I had a few years back. 
T: Chocolate dipped cherries. Dark fruits such as red and purple plums or perhaps prunes. Burgundy. Port. There's a woody finish that reminds me of a wet mesquite BBQ sauce, but its rather faint compared to the more predominant wine-base flavors. A more simplified response could be: port mixed with cognac. 
M: Thin like a fine liquor, nothing like a beer. Too sweet to be compared to whiskey or scotch. The closest comparison would be to a cognac. Although, the deep fruity flavors hint at the wine/port barreling.
O: Forget the 'beer' moniker. This is an exceptional beverage under any category. People complain about the price, but when you normalize the cost per ABV and volume, buying this beer for $200 at 24oz is like spending $270 for a 750ml of fine cognac. Thats not a bad price to spend for an exceptionally blended mixture of 1 to 20 year old aged tinctures. 1,097 charactersmcanderson0, Nov 18, 2013

A - Looks like cognac. No carbonation, as expected. Deep caramel color.
S - Port makes it way to the front almost immediately. A little sugary maple sweetness.
T - Rich, sweet and complex. Hitting some really nice tawny and ruby port notes. The complexity here is dazzling. Some really beautiful maple sweetness and rum overtones as well. 
M - Slick. Almost oily. Substantial.
O - Obviously, this is a non-traditional "beer". This is a tremendously complex beverage and to pigeonhole it into any category (other than "barrel-aged blended alcoholic beverage" is to do it a disservice. Enjoy it for it's uniqueness. 662 charactersbcm75, Nov 13, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My 800th Review. AMAZING. OVERWHELMING. ADDICTIVE.
This 2011 edition considered October 2013…while our dysfunctional government was shutdown because our elected representatives failed us in one of our greatest hours of need.
The experience begins as you consider the ale from its artisan copper colored porcelain vessel. A traditional plain gold bottle cap beneath the twist off top is a pleasant surprise.
Pours a still yet brilliant cherry mahogany color with absolutely no effervescence. It coats the walls of the chalice with the oily appearance of a fine distilled spirit.
The nose is aggressive and complex, smooth and beyond agreeable. INVITING.
It has a malty molasses cinnamon maple vanilla caramel sweet fig-like fruitiness that is altogether SWEET, UNIQUE and DISTINCTIVE.
The flavors are as complex and vibrant as the nose. The 27% ABV is completely hidden. The aroma commands your attention while the smooth lingering character of the mouth feel seamlessly serenades you with the world-class flavor experience.
I really appreciate the opportunity to have considered this fine ale thanks to Dustin Fargnolli of Sam the Beer Man…and it wouldn’t have been the same if I hadn’t shared it with a fellow advocate. Thanks Jay 1,245 charactersjjayjaye, Oct 05, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Limited 2009 edition. Poured into a double old fashioned glass. Bottle reports a 28% ABV but this is likely to have increased over the years.
A - Pours a deep, clear, still amber that beautifully tears down the glass. After a few years, a fine sediment developed.
S - A delicious maple syrup aroma predominates, and is accompanied by notes of vanilla extract, raisin, and alcohol. There's also a hint of oak in there.
T - Initially dominated by maple syrup with a touch of vanilla, and then takes a back seat to the alcohol and oak flavors.
M - Glazes the tongue and leaves a light burn. I find it particularly enjoyable to take a small sip and let it linger for a while before swallowing. Goes down amazingly smooth.
O - My mind is blown every time that I try this very special brew. I love to sit and watch the amber elixir slowly tear down the walls of the glass. Not what I think of when I hear the word 'beer,' but that's part of the mystique surrounding the Utopias. 977 charactersrx-beer, Sep 03, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally broke down and open mine after almost a year of hanging on to it. Poured about an ounce into a Sam Adams Sample glass. It was 2012 10th Anniversary Edition.
Appearance: Darker reddish amber in color, no head at all, no carbonation.
Smell: Fruity like notes, figs and some nutty notes as well. Alcohol was prominent.
Mouthfeel/Taste: Smooth, warm, full bodied beer. Taste was very complex. After several sips I could make out several flavors including vanilla, cocoa, alcohol, figs, sugar, citrus, tree nuts and some earthy, grassy notes in the background.
Overall: Glad I bought this one, however I really don't care for it. Yes I gave it all "5s", but I respect this beer. The complexity and the work put into it deserve full credit. It is truly one of the most unique brews I have ever tasted. It drinks like a cross between a fine wine and good whiskey. I would recommend that everyone try this at least once to say they did. 940 charactersCavanaghty, Sep 01, 2013

A- Pours a medium brown color with no head and maximum liquid stickage to the side of the glass.
S- Boozy as all hell with that brown sugary brandy-like aroma you find in lots of high gravity barleywines and old ales although this is much stronger.
T- Cloyingly sweet with lots of sugary caramel and maple notes only it's not pleasant. Also just as much alcohol as one would expect from the 29% ABv, maybe even moreso. Astringent aftertaste. Big raisin bomb.
M- Thick, sticky and highly viscous. Leaves a coating of sugar on the tongue as it burns the throat. No carbonation and a fullish body.
O- Thank God I didn't have to pay any money for this especially since it has such a ridiculous price tag. If I paid $200 or more for a whole bottle of this and found it to be this gross I'd shoot myself. Why people actually enjoy this, I'll never know. I wince every time I take a sip. Huge disappointment. At least I got a buzz off just a few ounces.
Update: Had the rest of the dram at room temp a couple weeks later and the flavor as well as the mouthfeel are drastically improved. Don't drink this one cold folks. 1,242 charactersImmortale25, Jul 24, 2013

A: pours thick like a port or cognac, there is no carbonation, rather than lacing what one gets is legs commonly associated with high alcohol liquors. 
S: wow. Smells just like a port to me, sweet and a little boozy. There are definite elements of dark fruits. 
T: sweet and rich. Reminds me more of a nice port than a beer, but I think that's the point. 
M: smooth and warming. It's a bit slick, and the alcohol warms and leaves a nice finish. 
O: definitely not what I would have expected, and definitely worth the chase. I truly enjoy this beer, and have to say it is a wonderful post dinner drink. 653 characterspolloenfuego, Jul 11, 2013

thanks go to Brian D for opening this bottle for us.
A- Pours a dark copper red with no head. Very appealing to the eye as you can see the legs cling to the glass.
S. Alcoholic raisins but in a good way with hints of toffee along with the slight burn of alcohol.
T- Raisins, toffee, burnt caramel. You definately get the alcohol but its not a bad burn at all very pleasant actually. very little to no carbonation.
M- has the feel of a port/sherry with medium viscosity and a slight burn on the outer part of the tongue.
O- This is an amazing beer if you can call it that. while $200 is steep if you can find a shot in a bar for $20-$25 i would definately say its worth it to those that want to try it atleast once. I on the other hand while mostly likely be tracking down each release if my bank account permits it.

This hophead was overwhelmed. Every once in a while, I'll go for a Dogfish 120, but Utopias is way beyond that. What a fantastic brew -- one of the best ever! But at such a cost. Not worth it to me. That's a flaw in the Beer Advocate rating system. Obviously it should factor in the cost, but it doesn't. Yeah, I'd like to drink this every day, but not if I had to pay for it! 480 characterspaultierney1, Jun 28, 2013

A - Pours a completely still brownish red that looks just like a whiskey to me. I'm not sure how to score this on appearance because it looks nothing like a beer, and the aspects that I usually touch upon such as head retention or lacing do not apply. Regardless, it is an attractive beer in its own way.
S - Insanely complex. A sweet maple syrup is joined with an oaky aroma. The booziness from the various barrels is incredibly apparent. There is some leathery or smoky qualities to the beer. It really stings the nostrils if I sniff too vigorously. There is so much going on here.
T - Holy macaroni! This thing borders on indescribable. Sweet port or madeira qualities at the beginning transfers to a nice oaky maple syrup flavor. The alcohol burn and sweet dark fruits bring up the rear. This is the definition of a sipping beer. I poured what I thought would be a miniscule amount of this beer into my glass & it is still taking me a substantial amount of time to drink.
M - Slick and heavy. Completely still like a spirit. Slightly sweet residual sugars in the mouth. A lasting burn that starts at the base of the tongue and goes all the way down to my toes.
O - This is something that must certainly be savored at a slow pace & in good company. I know this beer is a substantial financial investment; however, it can be opened with a friend at several occasions and re-sealed without a worry. Truly a unique experience, and one that is worth the price in my opinion. 1,615 characterswyatt13, Jun 23, 2013

The latest release of Utopias is a blend of previous beers aged in various liquor barrels. Mr. Dzen reports that beer from barrels from the original Triple Bock 20 years ago, from subsequent Triple Bocks, from Millennium (released in 1999), and from each subsequent release of Utopias is blended into the 10th anniversary edition. Further, Mr. Dzen reports that the 2012 edition of Utopias was aged in single-use bourbon casks from the Buffalo Trace Distillery and also spent time in a variety of finishing casks, including Tawny Port casks and Vintage Ruby Port casks from Portugal and rum barrels from Nicaragua. 
2 ounce pour, poured into a cordial glass.
Appearance: Utopias pours a very viscous, yet clear dark amber, like an Armagnac, Cognac, or Spanish Brandy. Absolutely gorgeous in color.
Aroma: Whoa! You can really smell that 29% ABV! Utopias has a very strong, but pleasing not offensive, alcohol aroma, that reminds me again, of an Armagnac, Cognac, or Spanish Brandy. There’s also tons of dried fruit, (prunes and raisons) and caramel and toffee and vanilla. Finally, there’s notes of oak, from the barrel-aging. Absolutely outstanding.
Taste: Another Keanu Reeves, “Whoa!” Tastes very similar to the aforementioned Armagnac, Cognac, or Spanish Brandy or even a vintage port. Lots of fruit, and oak and vanilla and toffee, and caramel, with slight hints of tobacco, all wrapped up in a very long, pleasant malty, alcohol finish. Very pleasant, very complex. I know that this is a beer, but…this is a beer?! Damn, I’m extremely impressed.
Mouthfeel: Cloying in a GOOD way, like a brandy, meaning the alcohol nicely balances everything out. 
Overall: This beer is awesome! Extremely flavorful, extremely complex, and extremely fantastic. Utopias will now be placed on a metaphorical shelf of honor next to my best scotches, Armagnac, Cognac, and Spanish Brandies! 1,956 charactersJeffreysan, Jun 17, 2013

The next weighed in at 25%, the 2nd to last one from 2009 (this review) topped out at 27% ABV. The latest storms in at 29%!
Poured in a Utopias glass (a gift from A Taste for Wine and Spirits in Cohasset, MA) 
It pours a very deep amber teak color with no head at all. When held to light the rich viscosity oils are admired.
The smell is port-like in its depth, although that's where similarities end. Big whiffs of strong dark rum come to mind, as does the smell of Sherry. There's also maple syrup, cola, cocoa and spiced brandy in the mix. The aromas last throughout.
The flavors of Sherry, creme brulee, rum, cherries soaked in rum, then bathed in port barrels roll across the tongue, mouth and throat. A minor taste of Grand Marnier peeks in, real or imagined.
I tried sipping, swigging, then gulping some. Swigging works for me!
Look forward to sampling the newest Utopias...when it can be afforded. 1,017 charactersBeerResearcher, Jun 13, 2013

A - I really like this. Its mahogany in color with ruby highlights throughout. The light coming through the beer is fantastic. Looks like the liquor it more closely resembles.
S - the alcohol knocked me back initially. Normally I can taste and smell anything approaching 10%. Additional attempts yield vanilla, carmel, and maybe a little dark fruit.
T - follows the nose. Also some nice oakiness detectable. Strong alcohol, but the flavors still carry the day.
M - relatively thin, with a calming burn and slight tingle on the finish.
O - enjoy this an ounce or two at a time. I had mine after a nice thick steak and wanted to fall asleep shortly after. Make sure to share this with friends. 778 charactersAndrew041180, Jun 09, 2013

10th Anniversary (2012) poured into a Utopias glass. Served at 65*. I will review this for what it is.
A- Pours perfectly still into the glass. Throws highlights of color into the room as it escapes from the depths of the bottle. Deep caramel amber color. Looks like a very very old spirit. Leaves beautiful, long legs on the glass when swirled. Slightly viscous (like an old ale). Definitely not thin like a spirit.
S- Wow. Let's make a list as we pick things out. There's a lot going on here. Much more complex than any other beer. Toffee, caramel, fig, date, maple, tobacco, leather, HUGE, full, Tawny Port, explodes in your head, rum barrel!!
T- Follows the nose. Carmel/toffee dominates the palate. Well masked alcohol. This lingers forever!!! Like toffee spun out the ass of Tinkerbell
M- Sticky. Syrup. Coats the lips in sweet deliciousness. Viscous at room temperature.
O- an experience I will never forget. 956 charactersMichigan, May 31, 2013

Deep chestnut with auburn highlights. No foam at all, not even a single bubble. I don't think there's supposed to be. 
Lotsa, lotsa smells: vanilla, a fair amount of triple bock squeamishness, licorice string, blackberry brandy, maple, caramel coated nuts and many, many more. One of the more complex things I've put in front of my nose, beer or otherwise.
Big and chewy. Vanilla and a whole lotta butterscotch. Maple and fig in back. Still pretty hot. 
A tough beer to rate because I don't have much to compare it to other than the travesty of Sam Adams Triple Bock. I'm told it's similar to cognac but I'm not a cognac drinker. I like it and methinks it's very good.

First time I ever dropped so much coin on one bottle of beer let alone two, but in the end it was an eye opening experience that caused me to go back and readjust all the top beers I've rated. Entirely worth the price if you can find it and have the extra cash saved up to spend on it.
The beer has a great history behind its ingredients and is unparalleled in it's balance between complexity and flavor. Should definitely be enjoyed a little at a time as it would be a shame to get too buzzed to truly enjoy the experience.
To date the only beer I've rated 5-star. 632 characterssh00ky, May 19, 2013

Immensely enjoyed by our Beer Society on April 20, 2013. Served at room temperature in 2.5 oz. samples.
Tasted alongside a tawny port, madeira, amontillado (medium dry) sherry, cream sherry (all of which were highly rated online, and only ran between $15-$25 at the LCBO) and Unibroue 17 Grande Reserve - all for comparison's sake. Not surprisingly, the Utopias was much more similar to the fortified wines we tried than the dark ale.
Out of our group of about ten men (none of whom had much experience with fortified wines), the vast majority found the fortified wines to be cloyingly sweet, while the unanimous consensus was that the Utopias was more complex, more drinkable (even with its higher ABV, as most of the fortified wines rang in at about 20%), and much more delicious.
As others have already mentioned, the taste is quite sweet without being cloying. Notes of maple syrup, dark fruits and chocolate. Plenty of warming alcohol. Beautiful colour - dark golden brown/ruby.
Highly recommended for a group tasting. 1,055 charactersECBS, Apr 30, 2013

I just happened (!!!) to find a 2009 vintage bottle in a store in St. Petersburg, Florida in 2010. I dropped the cash and have been sipping ever since. Yesterday, on the 2nd anniversary of buying the bottle, it finally emptied.
It's beer that has become the finest madeira you'll ever taste. Caramel, maple, toasted oak, molasses covered raisins, and every other flavor you can imagine!
If you like madeira, port, or sherry, you need to buy a bottle once in your life. You won't regret it! 532 charactersFliryVorru, Apr 29, 2013

The experience around the taste also added to each wonderful sip. I was able to try it with my co-workers at a private tour oF Sam's in Boston - one of the brewers came out to let us sample it (The case of Heady we brought to share may have helped!!) and we had such a great time all trying the beer together.
The beer - really more like a lovely sweet bourbon - was intense yet delicate, sweet yet subtle. At near 30% I was pretty silly by the end of my generous portion. Every sip was delicious and different! Mostly what I remember is a milk-chocolate, maple syrup sweetness. Rare to try, but if you ever have the chance, I highly recommend it! 791 charactersktblue22, Apr 29, 2013

A - Deep brassy mahogany; clearly there is no carbonation left on this thing, but its oily and you can see the sturdy lifting of the meniscus around the glass. As you swirl, the Utopias clings.
S - Abrasively boozy and overflowing with bourbon, toffee, molasses and dried fruit.
T - This is I guess what you'd expect 16 years of blended ales barrel-aged to taste like. The hops have long since faded to oblivion, leaving sweet whiskey notes and fig, caramel, berries and allspice. Only a durable bready maltiness reminds you that this is, in fact, beer.
M - Utopias has the consistency of canola oil, coating the full surface area of your mouth and tongue.
O - Nothing like it, but the rich whiskey taste and heavy alcohol content (not to mention the price tag and rarity) would relegate Utopias to the same dining location as a sweet single-malt scotch. A nice treat for a cool evening, but not something I'd seek out.

The beer pours no head and leaves no lacing except for traces of alcohol. The beer itself is a lovely brownish red that is see through.
The beer has a very strong maple syrup smell that mixes with hints of oak barrel and vanilla. Other notes that make a strong appearance is toffee with a bit of the alcohol smell as well as tiny notes of cherry. The smell is interesting in that the smells are, at best, balance and, at worst,, complementing each other very well.
The taste is strong and sweet with maple syrup dominating the tongue. The beer has a cherry flavor and very noticeable funk from their KMF line. The taste also has hints of vanilla as well as bits of alcohol. The 2013 edition definitely has a tartier taste than the 2012 edition. The aftertaste is very sweet and sugary. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth bordering on slick but with body. No carbonation but definitely heavy. The beer has a tiny bit of alcohol burn at the beginning but goes out towards the end.
Overall, a fantastic beer and one that I will continue to look out for every year.
2012 notes:
The beer definitely has some of the characters from the various barrels it was aged in. There is a noticeable sweet port note in the smell and taste that lingers even after having been aged for a while.
Aging notes:
Aging the Utopia seems to dull the more tarty notes and increase the alcohol content. It starts to become very much like a cognac but a bit more sweet with the syrup note still there. The vanilla note is still there but is not as present when it is young. 1,562 charactersHattedClassic, Apr 08, 2013

A - Deep ruby in colour with an amber glow along the edges. As expected, no head whatsoever. 
S - A huge port aroma up front. Charred oak, bourbon, toffee and dark caramel aromas with a big sweetness are complimented by a big noticeable alcohol presence. 
T - Port, bourbon and toasted oak flavours in the forefront give way to toffee, dark caramel and spiced rum noted. Some grape and raisin flavours in the background and a huge warming alcohol presence throughout that cuts through the massive sweetness. Given the 27% ABV, the alcohol is somewhat well hidden. Incredibly complex. 
M - Full bodied. Thick and viscous. Next to no carbonation but that doesn't detract from thsi beer at all; in fact it is complimentary. 778 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Apr 02, 2013

A: Pours a clean, dark copper with no head at all. This looks like a heavy barleywine.
S: Nose is mostly the one of an English Barleywine with chocolate, caramel, dried fruits. Surprisingly, I couldn't detect any alcohol at all. Deep and very nice smell.
T: The taste mainly follows the nose but is deeper, with some bready malts, also fruity, strong but with a low alcohol presence despite a small kick on the aftertaste.
M: The mouthfeel is similar to a liquor, a bit flat, but smooth and still very drinkable given the ABV.
O: I was really impressed with this one. It's definitely a sipper but I would never have guessed the alcohol content. So deep, so rich. Awesome! 740 charactersFux, Apr 01, 2013

Multiple servings (obviously on different days) ranging from 100ml – 300ml. 
Servings ranged in temperature between room temperature and chilled. 
Glassware: Over sized snifter and over sized wine glass. 
Review from combined notes of each session. 
2011 Vintage. 
A massive thanks to JAXSON for sending this gem all the way to South Africa. This is really a beer I never thought I would get the chance to try. 
Appearance: Sam Adams Utopias pours out incredibly thick and viscous and settles a very dark brown in the glass. A back light reveals beautiful deep red highlights and golden-amber edges. Obviously even the roughest of pours doesn’t generate an ounce of head. A swirl coats the glass in some of the heaviest alcohol legs I have ever seen. 
Smell: My god, I knew this would smell good, but this is just ridiculous – you can literally smell it from across the room. The complexity of the nose far exceeds any other beer I have had to date, with every sniff seeming to yield something new, even during my third and fourth servings there were new characters that I had not yet noted. I am nowhere near eloquent enough to express how well the all flavours combine and interact, so I will simply list some of the notes that I detected over the course of multiple servings. These include: Bourbon, vanilla, big fortified wine notes (sherry and port), raisins, currents, chocolate, maple syrup, brown sugar, deep caramel, dark treacle, toffee, stewed plums, cherries, a little oak, brandy, molasses, dates, some leather and obviously at this Abv, some nose tingling alcohol. 
Taste: Holy hell, as the nose promised, the flavor here is absolutely massive! The first few sips completely overwhelm your palate and not with alcohol as one might expect, but simply with the sheer size and complexity of the flavor. The flavor is incredibly sweet upfront, however the combination of barrel character and alcohol somehow manages to keep it from becoming cloying.
Flavour notes include: Rich caramel, maple syrup, fresh honey, fortified wine (sherry and port), butterscotch, bourbon, vanilla, oak, cognac, brandy soaked raisins, a toasted nutty note, dark toffee, a little molasses, a touch of leather, treacle syrup, caramelized brown sugar, a general dark fruity note and of course some alcohol (mind you, not as much as one might expect from 27%). 
Mouthfeel: Well this is a first, a beer that even I cannot call over carbonated!
 All jokes aside, at first glance Utopias seems to be devoid of any sort of carbonation, however after a long while and careful consideration, I have a feeling that there might just be a few uber small bubbles floating around in there. 
The body is, in my mind, nothing short of perfect. It is incredibly full, sticky as hell and completely mouth coating. I actually kind of wish that some of my favorite whiskeys had a body like this! 
Overall: As a lover of massive sweet beers, it was a bit of a no-brainer that I would love Utopias, but even in my wildest dreams I did not foresee it being quite this good! It is easily one of the best beverages I have ever had.
I purposely avoided using the word beer in the previous sentence as I think Utopias holds equally much in common with spirits such as bourbon and cognac as it does with other beers. 3,316 charactersThehuntmaster, Mar 26, 2013

Pours a rather light reddish brown colour, thick, spiritous and volatile in the glass. The head is, unsurprisingly, nowhere to be seen, leaving the beer looking rather dormant or dead. Huge legs from the thickness in the body, however, leaving sticky syrup trails when the beer is swirled. Colour changes to a slightly translucent yellow at the edges when tilted. It looks very exciting.
The aroma is all based around the booze, which, again, is not surprising. Big heady aromas of port and spirits surround everything. The aroma is rather sharp, however, and actually doesn't subside into a strong sweetness. There are some chocolate and coconut notes, possibly more from the oaking than any intrinsic sweetness. But otherwise, it's boozy, redolent, heady and just full of ethanol. It's an intense experience.
The sharp booze continues on the palate. Spicy heat on the front, mellowing to let stacks of oak character come through towards the back. The spicy alcohol releases other sharp characters: orange peel, a little lemon and ground allspice, along with a feeling like burning sinuses. The wood holds it together and stops it from being too violent. It's big and unapologetic, but maintains a sense of civility despite this.
Feel, unsurprisingly, is also hot and spicy, with a burn and stab approach to negotiation.
This is hot and difficult, but very powerful as a result. It's certainly an exciting and unique beer: one which is worthy of all the respect you can manage to muster for it. 1,698 characterslacqueredmouse, Mar 23, 2013

Super huge thanks to Jeff for giving me a taste of this ten year-old beauty one night. I've been wondering if I'd ever get to try this, let alone the whale-ish vintage of it. Solid, copper-brown pour; silky, oily, and thick as it falls into the glass quietly - no carbonation at all. It just sits in the glass, motionless and menacing.
I don't even have to bring this to my face to smell it. I could have sat on the other side of the room and reviewed the aroma. It was SO goddamn strong, words can't even express its brute force. And not only was it strong, it was complex - the number of things present were insane, and it seemed like the aroma stretched on for miles. Licorice, cognac/brandy, brown sugar and molasses, candied dark fruits, grapes, plums, rubbing alcohol, maple, toffee, vanilla, wood... I could probably go on for days and you guys would say "bullshit!" but there's no bull here. The aroma is one of the most complex and intriguing on the market. Granted, a bit "hot" and stingy on the nostrils, but at 20%+ ABV, isn't that to be expected just a bit?
I was almost afraid to take a taste, just because I had no idea what to expect. I mean, a beer with over 20% ABV? How good can that really taste? It hits my palate, heavy and thick, smooth and far from cumbersome thanks to a lack of any real carbonation. Super, super sweet at first, and yes, the alcohol is VERY present and VERY apparent. But the intense sweetness does a remarkable job of retaining drinkability, when you consider how strong this stuff really is. Brown sugar, molasses, black cherries, plums, booze-soaked raisins, toffee cake, light rubbing alcohol, port, caramel.... Very nearly as complex as the nose and every bit as hot.
It's amazing that even after ten years, this beer has seemingly retained so much of its potency. I wonder how hot this was when it first came out? Maybe the effects of aging aren't quite as severe when you're dealing with alcohol content in this range. Despite being so hot (and understand that when I say "hot", I'm talking relative to beer - this still has nothing on real whisky or bourbon), it remained pretty drinkable, most likely due to the heavy sweetness that worked hard to balance out the burn. The finish left a hefty taste on the palate, full of dark fruity booziness and a thick, caramel and molasses coating. This is one of those things you could still be tasting in the morning if you don't brush your teeth good enough.
So how do I rate this? It's so far from the realm of "beer" as we know it, that it's quite difficult to rate it using the same scale and criteria as I would rate other beers, even considering differences between styles. I mean, you wouldn't score a glass of Macallan 18 with the same set of standards you use for beer, right? The thing is, Utopias is far from the realm of most hard alcohols, too. It's much sweeter than your typical bourbon, scotch, whisky, cognac, etc, and in my opinion, contains a bigger array of overall flavors and nuances. It's almost in a world of its own - a strange limbo somewhere between beer and spirits, where no other breweries have dared to go.
Make no mistake about it, though, Utopias is damn good. I think it comes as no surprise that it's definitely a "sipper", and it's a highly enjoyable and tasty one at that. Is it worth the price tag? Hard to say. Is anything worth that much money? Depends on how much you want it, I guess. I'll tell you this - it makes for a great experience and a great time when shared among friends. A nice conversation piece in itself, and enjoyable for beer geeks of all types. Big thanks again to Jeff for letting me take a taste. 3,742 characterstectactoe, Mar 19, 2013

Black ceramic bottle into a taster snifter.
Served at room temp.
Viscous dark maple syrup pour. Zero carbonation, zero lacing, Loads of alcohol stuck to the edges of the glass.
A massive alcohol presence in the nose. Behind that is smooth, sweet rum, maple syrup, port, caramel, toffee, a nice vanilla punch and some bourbon in the back. Oak presence from the casks is there but subdued in the overwhelming nature of everything else.
Rum, maple syrup, bourbon, caramel, maple again, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, a nice oakiness with a huge warming sensation as it goes down. There is some port in there but the overly sweet notes shine through. The alcohol in the taste is much more subdued than the nose leads it to believe. This is something to savor and enjoy and you just can't help but to do so with every sip.
Medium to full body with zero carbonation obviously. Sticky on the lips.
This is my second 1oz serving in two days and it is truly remarkable. Something I would have never imagined I'd ever have. I'm glad to be one of the many/few in Ontario to get a bottle and I will savor every drop. 1,206 characterskorguy123, Mar 17, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I sampled the Samuel Adams Utopias 10th Anniversary, 2012 release. 
Appearance: Pours a deep amber red/ruby color with no head of any kind. Appears to be clear, but it’s dark in color so it’s difficult to see through.
Smell: Dark fruits. Rich, sweet, more like liquor than beer.
Taste: Follows the nose; sweet, dark fruits such as fig or raisin, slight maple syrup, vanilla, oak. The strength of the alcohol definitely comes across in this one. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth, syrupy; flavors stay on the tongue, coating it. 
Overall: I can safely say I’ve never had “beer” like this before. It definitely comes across more like a cordial than beer, and drinking it would follow suit. It’s meant to be enjoyed at room temperature and in small, savory sips. This batch has very complex flavors. I’ve read that oxidation is part of the appeal of this beer; in other words you open the bottle, screw the cap back on when done and leave it be (like most liquors). Since I can’t personally speak to how this may taste a year from now, I would risk a guess that it will be as equally tasty as it is from a recently opened bottle. If given the chance to try it (or any of the previous batches) you’ll definitely want to add it to your “tried beers” list. 1,262 characterstastymug, Mar 15, 2013

Pours a very dark chestnut brown with no head or lacing.
Smells of dried fruits, leather and of course alcohol.
Flavors explode on your tongue. Closest description I can think of is very strong brandied cherries.
Mouthfeel is sticky sweet with a crisp alchohol bite on the tongue and a lingering aftertaste.
As with others I had trouble rating this beer as it is a wholly unique beverage. I was extremely glad to have gotten a chance to try it. Would I shell out the funds for another, tough call. Would definitely go in on a bottle with friends. 647 characterssrhoadsy, Mar 10, 2013

I've had this three times now, mainly due to the generosity of others, and I can say it's not really my thing. Would much rather but a top shelf bottle of bourbon or scotch for the price, though obviously no comparison there. 
Pours a tawny almond skin brown, zero bubbles, zero lacing, bright clarity in the glass. 
Aromas are sticky sweet, big raisin and prune, nutty sweet tawny port. Flavors are largely the same, flavors linger long into the finish. Seems like any number of aged strong ales... Hardy's, JW Lees, etc, albeit with a nitro boost of alcohol. What mars the experience to me is the jarring astringent bite from the alcohol, which is more akin to sipping a whiskey neat. The complexity and flavors are there, it's just not as easy to sip as it could be, maybe 27% has something to do with it. Again, my personal preference is for beer and/or whiskey, not a hybrid, though this is an exceptionally unique product. 991 charactersemerge077, Feb 17, 2013

Thanks, JealousChalice!
Gorgeous dark coppers, amber, and caramels with zero visible carbonation, as expected. Nice clarity. Oily, alcoholic legs.
Perhaps the most complex aroma I've experienced in a beer of this style--though, granted, there is no beer in existence quite like this one to begin with. Vanillas, toffees, caramels, alcoholic kick, brandy-soaked cherry, and maple combine. This reminds me distinctly of a brandy or port. Lovely.
The flavor is even better than the aroma, though that almost seems impossible. Complex layers of maple, vanilla, brandy-soaked cherries, and port. The alcohol is less evident in the flavor than it is in the aroma, as well. Mind blowing.
Medium to full in body, with zero carbonation, though amazingly appropriate. Rich, coating, oily. Not too sweet, which was my worry.
Stupendous. One of a kind. There are no words, but I tried my best. 920 charactersehammond1, Feb 14, 2013

The ’11 had a better aroma and the ’07 the better taste, but they were fairly similar and it could have been bottle variation. Taste is fairly sweet but lots going on. Big molasses, fruit, bourbon and other spirits, oak, treacle, caramel. Very tasty. 566 characterspopery, Jan 27, 2013

It leaves a nice oil slick in the mouth, which allows you to savor the flavor. There is no hint of beer in the flavor, as it tastes like a very smooth cognac. If you asked 1000 people (non beer geeks) to taste it, I doubt anyone would say it was a beer. It is certainly worth it to split the cost with some friends, but I can buy a few great bottles of single malt scotch and a bottle of Bourbon for less money. 673 characterspotownbill, Jan 25, 2013

Serving - Brandy Snifter glass
Smell- Wow-a blending of rich cognac/bourbon with sweet caramel wafting over olfactory nerves
Price $$$$ - spendy $30+
$160+ retail price tag with very limited offering for 10th year anniversary, raffle drawn for empty bottle that you want to suckle on after
I can't describe how this doesn't even resemble a beer, none existant bubbly action/head for pour
Severe Legs- when you think of lines for bourbons/wine pour in the glass, swirl it around and take a whiff- feels warming, good fire/snow capped mountains outside with frost- 
Sip- feels like a smooth cognac, and although anti- some of the threads, I would pay the retail for this bottle, since it is unlike anything I've had...smooth ness of caramel/vanilla, hint of cherry/oaken (awesomeness) Can't get over that most people in the place to get a "feel for the "taste" were constantly sharing the "smell" - huge winner at this tasting!
I feel priviledged to have sampled this and although I sampled twice, certainly memorable and worth it. Definitely have my eye on Utopias from now on... 1,142 charactersd2daj, Jan 23, 2013

4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Had at ChurchKey from the bottle into a small snifter, 2012 version.
A - Still and brown, as expected. Not surprisingly, this has huge legs on the glass when swirled.
S - Fine brandy is the overwhelming note up front, while caramel and toffee malt is in the background. Slight hint of alcohol. 
T - Follows the nose with big brandy flavor up front. Toffee comes through in the middle. Finishes long, sweet, and smooth, with caramel taking over towards the back. This tastes wonderful, the layers of flavor unfold beautifully throughout each sip. Very well done.
M - syrupy, but balanced by the alcohol content. The feel is great, and the finish is impossibly long and smooth, but it gets cloying towards the end of the pour. I don't think one could drink more than a couple of ounces before crying uncle. 
O - An excellent experience trying this, it is a very complex brew. The various barrels work really well together, presenting an up front flavor which is more like a fine spirit than a beer. The finish, however, is pure malty delciousness, reminding you that you are drinking a beer. I very much recommend seeking out a pour, but be warned - the server at ChurchKey said it lasts 3-4 weeks after opening before succumbing to noticeable oxidation, so purchasing a whole bottle is probably not a good idea unless you have several friends to share it with. 1,364 characterskdb150, Jan 17, 2013

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.510th Anniversary edition. $300 for a black fermenter style bottle. #11814. a blend of several variations including the "infamous" 1994 triple bock. Served 12-31-12 in celebration of new year at room temp in a chalice. 
A: Not as thick or viscose as i imagined, a sherry-cayenne tint that was poured with no head and no signs of effervesce, no shocker there. Not as menacing as i envisioned, a quiet refined wine in glass visual. 
S: First impression was from the bottle directly and one that was more pronounced then in the glass itself. Dark fruit, raisins, sherry, chocolate souffle and hazelnut. From the glass of about a 3-4oz pour alcohol fusels were dominant. Scotchy caramelized malt hint. 
T: There was an almost hesitation to drink this at first, paying $300 a bottle with a nostril full of alcohol fusels my hand trembled a bit with the first sip. Rich chocolate souffle and hazelnut were present with some sweet toffee, and merlot. Warm toasty oak and alcohol, scotchy caramelized malt, and maple syrup sweetness. Some warm orange-apple honey fruitiness, licorice, vanilla, and figs with a cask wood background and sweet rum highlights are just a few of the vast complexities this beholds. Flavor was very nice, have to say, and best of all no indication of the 1994 triple bock soy sauce, yeah. Honey caramel. 
M: Mouthful was buttery and viscose with a motor oil slick texture, flat carbonation, high warming of alcohol on the tongue. Buttery caramel and alcohol fueled lacing but was fairly clean. It took alot to get a good feel for this and i knew i wasnt gonna get much of a second or third chance with the limited volume serving. soothing heat. 
O: Overall analysis, a very good complexity that shows through even in limited volume. Would love to get a longer appreciation for this, but i guess thats what the multiple servings are for. To be consumed like a fine, very expensive wine, with each sip being gentle, small, with a long drawn out swallow. Very savoring. This is a once in a lifetime purchase for me. At $300 a bottle was it worth it? only for self satisfactor sake. The bottle is quite the appeal and makes for a good show piece. Best split with friends or experienced by the glass at an establishment if you want to experience this first hand. 27% abv was not as boozy as one would think, ive had beers 10% that seemed more potent then this, just take it easy with small mangable sips, to much and that 27% will smack some sense into you. 2,475 charactersbeerthulhu, Jan 09, 2013

A: Pours completely still. Clear brown in color with some ruby highlights intertwined. Some massive legs and stick draping along the side of the glass.
S: Very hot and boozy up front. Overt alcohol and spirits with some hotness to it. Underneath that you get some maple sweetness and burnt sugar. Some caramel and toffee notes are present as well. Dark fruit complexities show themselves as well when it starts to hit room temp.
T: Caramel sweetness with a ton of vanilla. Oak with a great malty backbone. The alcohol doesn't compete with the complexities of this beer even though it's over 27%. Heat on the finish with a mix of toffee, roasted figs and raisins. 
M: Incredibly smooth and rich with a warming finish. Devoid of carbonation with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel.
O: This is the pinnacle of sipping beers. Sweet, complex and warming. This is a beer I will savor for a long time. 971 charactersTreebs, Jan 06, 2013

S: oak, toast, caramel, bourbon, lots of booze. smells like a shot of whiskey/bourbon, lots of sugar, maple syrup.

M: thick chewy body and no carbonation.
Overall: glad i tried this one but not wanting it again. even more boozy than the 29% or whatever it is would suggest. the sweetness I think is what makes it a little too unbareable. 574 characterskylehay2004, Jan 04, 2013

S - Chocolate, bourbon, smoke, leather, and a touch of spicy rum.
T - Sweet, thick malt up front with rich chocolate and maple syrup. Rum, bourbon, and alcoholic warmth in the middle. Finishes with much more of the same as well as spicy notes of leather, pipe tobacco, and more rum and maple.
M - Medium body, no carbonation, and a balanced finish.
D - Drinkable in the traditional sense is not something nth at applies to a beer like this. The aroma is spectacular, the flavor is excellent also, but with a sweetness that is still slightly excessive. Oddly pleasant for such an over the top drink. 652 charactersnickfl, Jan 04, 2013

A: The beer pours out of the fancy bottle and into my "free" Utopias glass a viscous brown color without any head at all. The liquid thins at the edges, allowing some light through, and has hints of red and yellow as well. 4.5
S: The nose is extremely boozy. Notes of bourbon and red wine are there, but the run really comes to the forefront to me. Spicy and sweet, the barrels are deep and assertive. I can't wait to dive into this beer. 4
T: The first taste really blows me away. I've waited for so long to try this beer, and it has absolutely lived up to the hype. The maple syrup is extremely apparent, which wasn't the case on the aroma. It's hugely sweet and syrupy, with some roast as the base for the barrels to shine. The rum and bourbon are big time players, but the very sweet port and some red wine come out as well. It's absurdly complex and deep, seemingly each taste brings a new experience. It seems to progress from bourbon/rum to wine to maple syrup. 4.5
MF: Thick, syrupy body without any carbonation at all. The finish is actually pretty clean. The alcohol is present and dominating throughout the taste. 3
O: This absolutely lived up to the hype and I can't wait to see what happens to it over the years. If you've been thinking about dropping the amount of money it costs to taste this, don't wait any longer. 4.5 1,386 charactersrusswbeck, Dec 29, 2012

dark brandy, bourbon colour. clear No carbonation, no head.
Smells of the best sweet black strap molasses, bourbon barrel and heavily cooked sugars (not overly sweet considering, with much in the way of residual sugars.)
Uber black strap molasses, light rye whisky and other distilled liquors. anise and some other winter spices (vanilla, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg & mace) A good depth of sweetness and residual sugars without being sickly. All of this is super condensed and difficult to pick out accurately.
Mouth feel is very smooth and flat, no carbonation what so ever. Not nearly as boozy as the 27% would suggest.
Great for what it is. The nose is a little simple, likewise the mouth feel. I would just as well have had a good dark brandy or cognac. That being said it is one off my bucket list and amazing for a beer the achieve this level of smooth complexity and malty depth, thoroughly enjoyed. 928 charactersOF001, Dec 29, 2012

2012 vintage. Bottle # 04542.
Pours a clear brown with no head. Legs of beer form on the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, sherry, and port. Taste is much the same with some wood and maple flavors as well. There is an alcohol burn in the throat after each sip. This beer has no carbonation but there is a smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is extremely strong and extremely rich but super tasty. 559 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 23, 2012

A - Dark mahogany hues in front of rich golden striations 
S - Caramalized dark figs raisons malted barley brown sugar slight booze like one would expect but not like anything i was expecing at all. Very pungent
T - Big dark fruits sweet boozy pancakes fill the mouth almost like a fruitcake. Oaken cherrys almonds bready malts vanilla very deep and complex very hard to narrow down any one flavor. Maple syrup really shines as it warms. (Used in a brandy warmer) I guess you can taste what could be hop earthiness but may just be the tannins from the wood. 
M - This is where it really goes crazy. The alcohol hits first numbing the palate over sweetness and makes it crazy smooth in balance. Syrupy mouthfeel also adds to the brown sugar. Very thick....Awesome.
O - Ive had the 09 and think 11 goes crazy over the top of it. The 09 had to many sherry vinous flavors to it where the 11 has that rich malted palate that lets you know its a beer. Much better than expected and will be aging for a while. Can only imagine what this could turn into. Perfect in my book. Not much room for improvement at this high of an ABV. 1,152 charactersJohnnyhitch, Dec 22, 2012
2.86/5  rDev -35.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5Being that I am also a wine lover, the best way for me to describe the 10th Anniversary Utopias is as a bad Port wine. It smells and looks similar to a port with dark brown cognac like features and tastes like one, unfortunately a bad one. Very heated in the mouth and all sorts of flavors but they are subdued by the bad alcohol taste. I had the 2009 earlier this year and it was much better thn the 10th Anniv. IMO you are much better off buying a $30 Warres Port if you are looking for this taste. I was very much looking forward to this one with all the hype it had around and since I very much liked the 2009 but this one was just a diasppoinment unfortunately. 666 characterskrl2112, Dec 20, 2012

We poured the entire bottle into 14 small tasting glasses. Dark brown body. No carbonation; totally still. Smell was ripe with rum barrels and booze. Taste was intense and powerful. Rum, port, caramel, raisins, toffee, sugar cane all came to mind. Mouthfeel was silky smooth and luscious like a nice cognac. This "beer" really stretched the definition of what beer is, even even though it was high priced, it was worth it. I though that this was better than some top shelf rums or bourbons I've ordered before. 590 charactersmorebeergood, Dec 17, 2012

A: Translucent chestnut brown color with no lacing. Thick legs poured down the sides after shaking the glass a bit. 
S: Thick vinous brandy with pepper, oak barrels, roasted caramel, toffee. 
T: Tons of flavor here as expected. It is a syrupy cognac like consistency with a burn to the back of my throat. Roasted caramel and cotton candy, toffee, dark purple plums, burnt sugars and a musty earthiness underneath it all. THis is nearly a hybrid of an old ale and a Port wine. Extremely sweet and boozy. I think you could put this in a glass with ice like a scotch and water it down while at the same time enhancing the flavors similar to a scotch. I am reminded clearly of Coton from The Bruery with similar old ale flavors and complexity. 
M: Thick vinous with absolutely no carbonation.
O: This is more an aperitif than a beer. You probably will not want to drink it after coming home from work or otherwise have too much of it. In many respects, as just about everybody knows ... its more a distilled spirit than a beer. 1,260 charactersalpinebryant, Dec 03, 2012

S: It smelled like vanilla, raisins, sweet fruit and booze. When I first smelled it, I thought I was about to take a shot of really good paint thinner as it burned my nose.
T: I would be lying if I said it was good. This stuff is more than good...It is Unbelievable. It is quite possibly the best sip anything I have ever had. The taste is so much smoother than the smell. At first I tasted raisins and the sweetness of brown sugar, with trailers of fruit and vanilla. I can't wait till my next sip.
M: I really like how it sticks to my mouth and I can still taste it 10 minutes later. The sweetness still lingers as I type, begging me to open the bottle for another sip. The smell burns the nose much more than my mouth...It is amazingly smooth.
O: Some say it is not worth the price, but I can say that I bought two bottles. One to keep, and one to trade. Now, I can honestly say that I am keeping all $400.00 worth of this stuff and will save it for years to come to sip in celebration, and with friends. 1,146 charactersC13, Dec 02, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5A few of us combined assets to share a bottle.
Utopias 2012 is, as Jim Koch suggests, more of a cognac than a beer. It’s very tasty and unique, but (for me) not really worth the price.
A: 5.0. A clear, beautiful dark amber. No head, no carbonation, but plenty of the legs you see in red wine.
S: 5.0. Rich vanilla and dark fruity sweetness, but no hops.
T: 5.0. Coats the mouth with the lip-smackin’ sweetness of a host of dark fruits and heavy vanilla. Again, no hops anywhere in the building. Nice and warming, with quite an alcohol bite. I strongly suggest visiting the Sam Adams website to read about this beer; I found all the flavors mentioned in the explanation.
M: 5.0. The sticky sweetness lingers until you suck every sugar off your lips and out of your month. The coating is such that a slight numbness settles over your lips until you clear Utopias off. It is amazing.
Overall: Even with all the 5.0 scores above, I still must give Utopias 2012 an Overall Score of only 3.5 because of its price. It was probably worth this one-shot group purchase, just to see what all the fuss is about. But if Jim Koch wants me to buy future editions, it’d need to be priced closer to $50 retail. Its production economics probably wouldn’t cooperate with that price point, though. Oh, well. I can still buy plenty of super-tasty other beers with what a single bottle of Utopias costs. 1,395 charactersTucsonTom, Dec 01, 2012

Muddy looking brown color with zero carbonation. 
Smell is complex, boozy and sweet. Notes of vanilla, bourbon and maple syrup with rum and oak. 
A major slap in the face with flavor. Huge sweetness and moderate sourness up front. Flavors of maple syrup, vanilla, spiced rum, bourbon, oak and of course hot alcohol. Really does taste like a souped up barrel aged beer though. So complex. 
Flat, syrupy slick and full bodied. Perfect feel for what the product is. 
Overall, it's more than a beer. It's an experience for sure. Is it worth the price? I would say if its divided up among several people it is. Definitely something to try once in your life. Personally loved having it. 731 charactersjera1350, Nov 24, 2012

A- No carbination, or lacing, very oily slick in the glass. Copper in color and kinda thicker looking. 
S- The smell is so complex, and changes as the glass warms up. Dark fruits, vanilla, cinnamon, figs, pear, apples. Very similar to a port and a cognac mixed and a huge alcohol hit.
T- The complexity in this beer is crazy, just so much going on almost a tastebud overload. Vanilla, dark fruits with lots of port flavors, boozy, caramel, and burnt sugar. 
M- Burns the mouth a bit, especially the lips. Oily and very nice solid body feel.
O- This is great, tasty and quite enjoyable. Is it worth the money, not especially. Is it worth a try, if you can get a hold of it for sure. 762 charactersWetpaperbag, Nov 24, 2012

Nose is ultra starchy and rice wine like specifically huangjiu or yellow alcohol, Chinese rice wine. It’s tough to describe but heavy red bean starch, sweet toffee, not as much smoke and rice character as huangjiu and more savory soy and saltwater. As it opens up/decants you are rewarded with cinnamon and amaretto. Still, enormous umami character like porcini mushroom and beef bouillon. Interesting combo. Taste is sour lemon up front with mild alcohol heat ending with big starchiness and more lemon. Mild oxidized character. Interesting. Alcohol heat is not an issue. Palate seems decently viscous. Hard to compare to other barleywines as this is more like brandy and rice wine blended. I’m very grateful for the sample, but I think it is safe to say I would not spend $100 on a bottle...though you get to savor this over a long period like Scotch so maybe it is worth it. 986 characterstarheels86, Nov 20, 2012

I may come back and modify my review each year since I plan on drinking 2 oz each year on my birthday (Nov 18). Depends on how much it changes.
Pours a mahogany caramel color with no head. The nose is almost like amaretto and brandy together. Chocolate covered cherries, almonds, maple, pecans, definite booze heat (obviously), caramel, molasses and some slight red grape notes. The taste is very sweet. Maple, almond, oak, cherry, chocolate, booze, pecans, caramel and molasses. It is syrupy, sticky, sweet, very hot. It is definitely a lot different than a beer. It kind of deserves its own classification. It is fermented like beer but it is like drinking a liquor like cognac or brandy. I love it but I don't know if I can call it a favorite beer. Maybe my favorite liqueur... 880 charactersDonDirkA, Nov 20, 2012

A- Pours a brown/ mahogany color. No carbonation or head whatsoever. Lots of lacing along the sides of the glass which I expected at 27% ABV. 
S- Obviously the booze comes hard on the smell. Once you get past the nose-burning from the booze, I get hints of dark fruits, figs, and raisins. Smells like a brandy or cognac to me. The bottle says brewed with maple syrup, but I really don't get any in the aroma. 
T- First sip hits hard, and tastes much like the aroma. Dark fruit and raisins are big on the taste initially. Though I didn't get maple syrup on the aroma, I do get quite heavy hints of it in the taste. Drinks like a fine liquor. 
M- Heavy, no carbonation, boozy, and smooth. Each sip warms the throat and stomach. 
Hard to call it a beer, but this is great stuff. I've been sipping on this bottle for 2 years and it hasn't lost a thing. A great beer to try if you're willing to shell out the dollars. 1,101 charactersvic21234, Nov 19, 2012
4.66/5  rDev +5.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Mahogany colored body with no head to speak of. Sticky body clings to the sides of the glass.
S- Maple syrup, oak, bourbon, tobacco, red wine, molasses, brown sugar. Smells incredibly sweet and all of the aromas are huge.
T- Sugary sweet, but all of the flavors come through in their own way. Incredibly complex, very sweet, very interesting.
M- Very syrupy, no carbonation, impressively almost no alcohol burn.
O- Really a crazy beer. Flavors are ridiculous and it's different than anything I have ever tried. Try it if you can. 536 charactersstephenjmoore, Nov 18, 2012
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a taster glass. This one pours dark mahogany with a bit of a reddish hue. 
He aroma is rich with caramel figs and dark fruit. Surprisingly not boozy on the aroma. Rich and woody with toffee. It been said but this smells like a congnac. The pallet gives some notes of toffe and bourbon with notes of oak and vanilla. Dark fruits and figs with a sweet edge.
The body is full and flat. No carbonation but full and smooth. Feels nice. Overall this is a nice treat. Real enjoyable but I just assume have whiskey or some other comperable spirit. 553 charactersBendurgin, Nov 18, 2012

Smells sweet and sugary like a Sherry Wine, Candied Figs, Maple, The smell is so sweet that its making my mouth water.
The taste is very smooth, not too boozy. nice sweetness with a slightly tart finish. There is definitely some Barrel aging going on.
The mouthful is really nice. Coats the mouth like a fine Brandy evenly with a very slight alcohol burn on the swallow.
The drinkability is moderate to high on this one. Pour it in a snifter and sip away. 499 charactersshrek806, Nov 11, 2012

A - Pours a crystal clear chestnut/mahogany hue with no head at all but plenty of lovely, lovely legs. Seriously, this stuff is over 28% do you really expect a nice creamy head with this?!
S - Sweet, sweet zombie Jesus. My goodness is this awesome. Sweet, but not overly so with simply mind blowing maple notes. This SCREAMS maple and sherry. Considering this is higher than the usual 27% this is awesome, very little alcohol on the nose. Seriously, this is a maple and sherry bomb.
T - More HUGE maple sweetness notes again with some nice Toffee. Good, light earth and almost butteryness from the oak barrels. Not much alcohol again in the pallet. So much goddamn maple syrup. Shocking.
M - Mouthfeel is not as boozy as I thought it would be. Not heavy or syrupy either. Excellent barrel and maple notes with a light sherry/cognac feel. Smooth with hardly any carbonation.
O - Overall this far exceeded my expectations. Stuff is absurdly good. It really is worth the $160 as far as I'm concerned. Man oh man... 1,201 charactersrudzud, Nov 05, 2012

Got a special invite for tasting, The 2oz pour had no head and no lacing, crystal clear elixer with a few little chunks, maybe cork or something.
Definitely a huge booze on the nose, I mean hot. Very nice subtle maple vanilla raisin aromas come through the heat.
Taste is very smooth, not at all hot. Follows the nose with the maple vanilla raisin with an appropriate amount of booze. Not at all strong or overpowering booze, smooth.
Very much a full bodied thick chewy beverage.
Not sure this is really a beer but hey it was nice to try. 612 characterswelldigger888, Nov 02, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -0.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.510 Anniversary Edition. 
A: Color is dark raisin brown. Clear, still, and flat. Appears to be more like liquor than beer. 
S: Aroma is sweet and complex, with notes of raisin, port, tawny port, chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, and lots of alcohol. 
T: Flavor is very similar to the aroma, though doesn't taste as sweet as it smells. Raisin and port with molasses, but there is also an earthy woodsy component as a well as a slight creaminess. 
M: Thick, viscous and flat! But it all seems to work for this beer. 
O: This is a very good drink, though it's not exactly beer in the classical sense of the word. Sure, it's technically beer, but this one is more in line with a sherry or a port than a beer. If you like those drinks and can appreciate this brew for what it is, you'll find this beer to be quite complex, incredibly balanced, and easily drinkable. 872 charactersFlorida9, Oct 24, 2012

S: very very boozy upfront on the nose where it almost burns the nose hairs after every whiff, besides that I was able to detect some dark fruits, hints of vanilla, and very little oaky barrel character.
T: There was vanilla, dark fruitiness, oaky character, quite a bit of caramel flavor, brown sugar notes but was very muted due to the overwhelming amount of brandy like booze heat battering the palate. 
M: the brew was medium in body with virtually no carbonation which had a sweet, oaky, mild dark fruity, very boozy and sticky finish.
O: very interesting beer all around, but have to say it was pretty tasty considering the heat on this booze bomb. 788 charactersGobzilla, Sep 10, 2012
3.7/5  rDev -16.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Metal bottle served into a sampler glass at the Surly Goat in Hollywood, California. Reviewed from detailed notes. It hit the wallet hard at $16.00 for about two shots worth. I savored it and had very high expectations given the hype and its current rating. 
A: There's absolutely no head whatsoever, not even a floater. I'll write this off to the monstrous ABV. Colour is a chestnut copper. Nontransparent. Nonopaque. No yeast particles are visible. Not real vibrant. Leaves viscous clear brandy-like legs that slide down the glass' sides. Appealing in a general sense. 
Sm: Heavy alcohol, whiskey, and strong port influence. Some vinegar and wine notes make it in as well. Dried grape, raisin, and hints of fig. Other dried fruit esters. Aroma gets better as it warms. 
T: Heavy dried fruit - raisin is there, as is dried cherry. A bit strong but the sweetness is tame. Comes across as very sugary. Wow. Warms the stomach but the alcohol is nicely concealed. Apple, grape, and hints of cognac. Some whiskey burn on the climax. Lilac on the finish. Nicely balanced and built. Rich and decadent. The alcohol is present more on the backend, lending it a nice heat. 
Mf: Very viscous and slick, but also nicely smooth and wet to aid delivery. Slight undercarbonation, aiding the general tone of the flavours as well as delivery. Quite thick. Complements the flavour nicely. 
Dr: She's a sipper to be sure. Nicely drinkable for the monstrous ABV though. Drinks like a fine cognac or bourbon. I wouldn't buy a bottle of it at its ridiculous price point, but it's lovely to try once. I did expect better, but it lives up to its hype to an extent. It's certainly a quality sipper, anyway you slice it. 
I love the bottle itself; it'd make a good souvenir or home bar piece. I remember the Mikkeller Bar has one laying about. 
Best consumed warm, hands down.

Appearance: Poured from the fancy Utopias decanter into a large snifter. Pours a ruby/brown hue with no haze and no head whatsoever. There are, however, legs running down the side of the glass from the high percentage of alcohol, similar to what you might find in a glass of red wine. An interesting phenomenon I had yet to observe with beer.
Smell: The first thing that strikes you smell-wise is the sheer strength of the alcohol in this bad boy. Very boozy - almost brandy-like or something resembling a very sweet bourbon. There is some malt presence in there as well, along with some dark fruit aromas and toffee.
Taste: Very sweet and a lot of raisin influence in the flavor. Toffee, cherry, bourbon, maple, butterscotch, and a little bit of smokiness are there as well. Lots of alcohol, but it tastes a bit more like a beer than I thought it would, given the boozy nostril punch this thing administers.
Mouthfeel: Very thick and chewy, as is to be expected for a beer like this. It's certainly a sipper and if you keep that in mind, I think the feel is pretty close to where it should be.
Overall: A very unique and tasty beer experience enjoyed with great friends. Too bad it costs so much, otherwise I may have sought it out more. Still worth it though if you can find a group to enjoy it with! 1,422 charactersBuckyFresh, Aug 23, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A delightful, complex, and stimulating long sipper.
Presentation: 22 oz copper custom capped ceramic decanter. Shaped like a boiling kettle, the kettle opening offers an image of Sam Adams that breaks a bit the otherwise bright design. It is a nice touch but adds a common Boston Beer tacky sense to the design. Label with lengthy description of the special offering and code to redeem a custom snifter. Notes limited 2011 edition, bottle #03733. Poured into a custom Utopia snifter.
A - Clear deep amber small pour. The dark crimson waves slide with a sticky wave to the side of the glass. For a brew of this depth it is a rather beautiful serving.
S - Long nose, rich and very aromatic with plenty of caramel, dark fruits, molasses, sherry, long brandy, soft alcohol. Very complex, pleasing, and never overwhelming.
T - Delightful notes of candied fruits over the brandy structure, where dates, raisins and prunes shine over wood, vanilla, caramel, slight spicy hint in the background, touch of nutmeg and soft pepper. Toffee, and caramel, long distant notes of chocolate and leather make a dent as one progresses through the small serving...
M - Medium-full body, very smooth, with a soft stickiness, and a final warmth touch that lingers, and lingers holding up all the complex palate of flavors.
O - Delightful sipper, very complex and full of layers.
Notes: What a treat… This really reminds me of Spanish brandies and other local blends like quinas. They were in the mix of barrels for this 2011 edition, and they do shine beautifully. Memories of a Cardenal Mendoza, so this is something that may appeal to anyone keen on that sweet complex brandy range, it has some of that Carlos I and Duque de Alba range but the final sweet complexity puts it closer to Cardenal Mendoza than anything else I've ever tasted. If one can afford it, at the suggested retail prize, this is a delight to have and share with people either intrigued by the limits of beer, or this complex Brandy, Cognac, solera blends… Pushing the price at the retail point I guess might develop part of the legend but hurts the accessibility to something that is already pretty pricey. At this price range, if I can afford it then, I'd love to have access to a bottle of the next vintage… in 2013? Thanks Luke, and Manning for making this possible. 2,333 charactersDaniellobo, Jul 14, 2012

Pours still, looks deep. A rich copper brown hue. Legs are seen upon swirling. Smells amazing, although it's well into the liqueur/liquor territory: dark fruit, figs, dates. Nothing uncommon, but very bold and yet smooth.
Drinks flavorful and sweet but exceptionally clean at the end. Sherry is the best adjective I can use to describe it. Doesn't have the same burn as Macallan but damn, it comes close in taste. Of course it is much sweeter.
A great beer and very glad to have tried it. 541 characterstewaris, Jun 21, 2012

Bottle to Flask to Utopias Glass
6oz
2011 Vintage
Thanks to my buddy Will for sending a late birthday present and glass wale.
App- Really to me poured out like a sherry mixed with some bourbon. Its not the color that gets you its the reflection in the glass. Shines like a diamond with multi facets to it. A little lighter around the edges with some yellows.
Smell- What stuck me was how each time I brought it up to take a sip or smell, I got something different. Oaky, barrel, vanilla, malty, boozy, dark fruits, sugary, sweet. A little mish mash of them all but works so well.
Taste- The flavor of this cant really be described if you havent had it. It starts off really hot and you can only take a small sip. The vanilla comes in and brings a little sweetness. Next comes some of the dark fruits and maybe a bit of brown sugar like a cordial. Last flavors come up are the earthy barrel and some oak.
Mouth- Almost gave it a tad higher but I pulled back. For a beer this complex, I felt it was just a bit too thin. Needed a bit more creaminess behind it. A solid medium body with a low carbonation. Just needed like I said a touch more creamy flavor. Residual heat and oak with a touch of a vanilla brandy cordial note.
Drink- I am still not sure how this qualifies as a beer. I had this in 2009 and just didnt appreciate it as much. I hope one day I can buy a bottle and take little sips each year to see how this changes. I am sure it would be just wonderful. 1,491 charactersFosterJM, Jun 13, 2012

A: Pours a dark, dark ruby brown. No head or lacing whatsoever, as expected.
S: Huge brown sugar, molasses, slight chocolate, pungent sugary alcohol. Incredibly strong nose.
T: Molasses, brown sugar, fig, prune, raisin, maple, little bit of chocolate, vanilla and huge toffee in the finish with some more raisin notes. Mild bourbon, brandy, and a bit of wood from the barrels.
M: Syrupy but not too thick. No carbonation.
O: Alcohol is surprisingly well-integrated. It's like a gigantic sweet English barleywine on steroids. Better than expected. 708 charactersEtan, May 28, 2012

Flavor was really sweet but not unpleasantly so. Lots of raisin and brandy with a nice heat from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is sticky and viscous, almost like a liquor.

Score: 94
2011 vintage sample served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead snifter and enjoyed on 04/04/12.
Appearance: Pours a transparent dark caramel brown color that looks like a shot of whiskey. Absolutely no head, no lacing, and, by extension, no retention. Tilting the glass to inspect the color for a minute left an oily line across the middle of the side of the glass that slowly oozed its way down, back into the beer. This beer looks incredibly menacing. 4/5
Smell: Hoo boy! Upfront is a fiery, vodka-like alcohol aroma that singes nose hairs, but quickly behind it is a pleasant mix of brown sugar, smooth caramel, and maple. There is raisin, fig, peanut, walnut, leather, tobacco, and vanilla too. This is easily the "hottest" aroma I have experienced to date, but the nuances behind the fiery spirit smell are pretty awesome. 4/5
Taste: Whoa. For as fiery as the aroma is, the taste is substantially smoother. Sweet grape, vanilla, and brown sugar upfront, with a lingering brown sugar sweetness. Lots of sweet raisin, cognac, oak and dark fruit on the midpalate. Further sips reveal sugary molasses, whiskey caramel malt, vanilla, and cognac flavors. There's a distinct booziness and alcohol warmth on the palate (at 27% ABV, this is quite expected), but it is surprisingly well mixed with rest of the flavor components. This tastes almost like a smoother, sugarier brown spirit with a red wine and raisin twist. This brew is very complex, and it's fifteen year aging process in everything from port and cognac to whiskey barrels is apparent. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, no carbonation. Thick, chewy, syrupy and sugary. Finishes sweet. 5/5
Overall: Big, bold, delectable and sweet. This is a heavy sipper that should be enjoyed a few ounces at a time (there is no way in heck I could enjoy a full glass of this stuff, even at a lower ABV). The beer is not too sweet for me, but it's certainly one of the sweeter beers that I have enjoyed. Those that think Dark Lord is a diabetes-laden sweet bomb should be forewarned.
Recommendation: Priced at $8 per ounce if you can manage to get your hands on a bottle, or $20 for 1-2 ounces at those rare bars that carry it on their top shelf, this one is definitely overpriced for what it is -- but it is absolutely worth trying once. Find a bottle and split it with your friends.
Pairings: Chocolate chip pancakes or Crème Brulee.
Cost: Retails at approximately $200 for a 750 ml bottle that looks like a brew kettle. That is, if you are lucky enough to find a bottle at the price. 2,731 charactersjegross2, May 01, 2012

Reddish brown colour, without any head. Huge legs. Nose has a big layer of alcohol over everything, butterscotch, brandy, cognac is quite prominent, caramel, toffee, oak - too complex to accurately describe, held my nose to this for ages before digging in. Incredible. Again a layer of alcohol veils everything just a bit on the palate, but tofee, nuts, oak, butterscotch, brandy, cognac, brown sugar and some sweet chocolate. Sweet and extremely 'desserty' - dense body with a lingering flavour. Thick, alcoholic but a great warmth in the finish. The smoothness at which the alcohol is applied is fantastic. A spectacular offering, and unlike any 'beer' I've ever had before. Certainly something I could smell all day. 811 charactersliamt07, Apr 28, 2012

Pretty flat looking appearance, nothing resembling head, lace or retention, looks like someone left an amber/old ale out for a few days to let all the carbonation out of it. But it is clean looking, no chunky sediment or whatnot, color is like equal parts burnt orange, red and light brown. Aroma, not bad, definitely more on par with a liquer than most beer aromas, sticky, and the positive kind of oxidation. 
A lightly sweet, thick, syrup and molasses like flavor and texture is evident. Should definitely appease those who like scotch and cognac. Plenty of vanilla, oak and caramel to compliment the flavor profile, making out for a good experience as a result. 
Complex enough to not simply be a drink that the lowest common denominator would flock to (given its price, probably not a problem) but overall, a neat and good experience, but eh, could never see drinking more than 3oz of this. 1,008 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Apr 13, 2012

Utopias pours a very attractive reddish mahogany color. It is super bright with no head, but major legs.
Aroma is very spirit like with plenty of warmth and straight up alcohol. Unlike a spirit though, it has a more beer like backbone to the aroma that I can only think to describe as being more substantial than say a scotch or brandy. Other aromas include caramel, leather and raisins.
The flavor has even more raisin like qualities with a lot if caramel flavors as well. Toffee, leather smoke and maple are all present. Despite the alcohol heat, the flavors of the malted barley come through quite well with their bready caramel character.
The mouthfeel is quite full and a bit chewy. It is interesting drinking a beer that is supposed to be dead flat. I almost wonder how much less substantial the body of this beer might be if it was carbed up. The finish is very sticky and to me, more of a hindrance to the drinkability than the alcohol.
Obviously, Utopias is not your average beer and is hard to rate on the same scale as the others I have reviewed on this site. As I alluded to earlier, this is a sipper of a beer that is certainly meant to be enjoyed like a fine brandy or scotch. I also enjoyed mine with my awesome beer nerd friends (TChopcraver, TCGoalie & Buckyfresh) which is something that I also recommend if you are able to track down a bottle of this. Ultimately, I found this beer to be quite tasty and if money were not a concern I would probably try to buy it every time it came out and pop one open for a special occasion. 1,702 characterszoso1967, Mar 25, 2012

Pours a cloudy dark brow-mahogany with no head. The initial aroma that I detect is nutty, pecans, with vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins, some port like qualities, and a touch of alcohol. The taste has amazingly very little alcohol perception! Dark fruit and port qualities dominate the flavor, figs, plums, raisins, oak, bourbon and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is very syrupy and viscous with no carbonation and a sweet lingering finish. Overall this is an exceptional beer and I’m very glad that I finally got to try it. 618 charactersjamescain, Mar 06, 2012

S - Utterly stunning - unlike any other beer. Sherry, cherry, cognac, port, extreme barrel aged notes. Just an insane bouquet of dark fruits - cherry, dates, a bit of wild dark berries. A bit of caramel malt and vanilla. 
T - Just wow. This hits you so hard with the barrel aging - it is so incredibly smooth even with the high abv. Taste follows the nose but it is even more amazing. The taste lingers forever, which is amazing. 
M - No carbonation, but it doesn't need any. Lingers in your mouth for an eternity (1+hour) long after you have swallowed it. It made me smile so much; I couldn't believe what my taste buds were experiencing. 
O - Incredible. If this beer isn't perfect, then nothing is. If you can appreciate a barrel-aged beer, take that times infinity and you have Utopias. Kind of pricey but I can totally understand why. Save this for special occasions, and you won't be disappointed. 956 charactersgregy55902, Feb 21, 2012

4.73/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Can't believe it's taken me two years to write this review. Acquired one of the very few '09s that made it to Texas, thanks to nate8767. Opened it in Dec '09 with friends, have sipped an oz or two here & there since, but left myself a small pour knowing I'd review it one day. Here goes review #300:
Bottle #14364 served at room temperature, as it should be.
Dark mahogany hues beam out from an amber base. Pours completely flat with zero head, just as it did the night I opened it. Sticky veins of lace drape down towards the liquid after each swirl. I know very little about high-end brandy & cognac, but others more familiar with those spirits tell me they share this same characteristic.
Aroma remains very hot. There's really no getting around the booze content here: at 28%+, this one's gonna smell strong. But there's treasure beneath that heat. Rounded fruits are prominent amongst the rich caramel, smooth vanilla, and maple. What's here is out of this world, though.
A multitude of flavors blossom from this liquid as it reaches your tongue. Deep, dark fruits; luscious caramel from the aged, boozy base; fresh maple syrup. Brighter fruits come in at the end alongside the alcoholic warmth. Finishes a touch sweet with lingering maple & fruit. Leaves a sticky resin in your mouth and throat, tempting you to savor another ounce. Unique! Marvelous! I want more...
Utopias boasts a surprisingly thick, chewy, creamy body that works wonders for the brew. I still remember the shock I experienced after taking my first sip more than two years ago: "Woah, how is this so robust and creamy?" Years later, I'm still in awe of its heaviness. Did I mention it's sticky as hell?
This is the very definition of a sipper. Very glad I chose to spread the enjoyment of my bottle over a number of years. That said, it's about the same as I remember from 2009; maybe slightly more caramel-y given the added age.
Bottom line, this beer is absolutely fantastic and worth seeking out. Birth a child to trade for a bottle. Mortgage your grandmother. Or just chip in ~$30 with six of your best friends and split a bottle. Utopias is no bargain, but it's easily one of the best beers on the planet. And certainly the most unique. 2,224 charactersbrystmar, Feb 07, 2012
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the utterly gorgeous bottle into a Glencairn whisky glass. Served at room temperature. From notes. Reviewed 8 July 2011.
A: Gorgeous beer. Wine-dark brown. Clear and brandy-like. No head.
S: Such smells! Brandy. Hugely alcoholic (far beyond what the ABV would suggest) with a whiff of fire. Chardonnay? White grapes. Big and boozy, with so much going on.
T: This does *not* taste like beer. It tastes like liquor. Nutty, sherryish, and very alcoholic sweet. Loads of fruit. Warming and pleasant. Flavour-dense, hard to describe, and pretty great.
M: Warming, smooth, and clean. Despite its fearsome moments, it veritably slides down the throat. Very enjoyable.
O: Fantastically interesting. Almost certainly not worth the money, but what a bottle and what a 'beer'. I highly recommend you try some. 815 charactersAgentMunky, Feb 07, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a clear ruby brown with no head, obviously. The aroma on this puppy can be smelled from a mile away. The aroma is a ton of dark fruit from the start - a huge dose of prunes and raisins. There is a caramelly sweetness that reminds of candied raisins and the malt is laughing and dancing in the background. One can also find sour cherries and a huge alcohol burn. This tastes like a million things. The flaovr is extremely sweet up front like glazed prunes and cherries mixed with fresh caramel and cream with a dash of vanilla. The malt is also quite present, adding layers of flavor and even roast and a dash of coffee if you really search. The mouthfeel is really unique - creamy and thick, coating the mouth, along with a burn from the alcohol, but you don’t taste so much as feel it. This is awesome stuff! 817 charactersdrowland, Feb 05, 2012

A: Pours warm amber with a very small tan head. No lacings.
S: Vineous galore. Smells more like a nice Port than a beer. Lots of dark dried fruits, very sweet. Some oak in the back though. Surprisingly little alcohol in the smell.
T: Follows the smell; molassess and dark dried fruits. Vineous but also with a Cognac-vibe. 
M: Aftertaste lingers with sweetness but also a warmth from the high ABV. Body is sticky full while carbonation is well hidden. Boozy.
O: Well, this is a very nice beverage, but I'm not sure if it's more like Port than beer. Worth the money? Of course not. 641 charactersEvil_Pidde, Feb 04, 2012

It poured a dark caramel brown color with a little bit of tiny bubbles scattered across the top at first. It's a little slick looking as it leaves some nice legs on the glass. Great looking color to it.
In the aroma the first thing I notice is the alcohol. It definitely lets you know right from the start that this is a very strong beer. I get some bourbon, brown sugar and vanilla all present but what I really like are the notes of maple and sherry I'm getting. It's got a ton of really great flavors going on in it, and they all come together very well. 
The taste has a warming alcohol heat to it that is bigger than any other beer I've ever had. I get toffee and caramel mixing with a little chocolate as well as some of the barrel aged, bourbon, vanilla and oak character to it. I start to notice some maple in it with some leathery notes as well as I continued to drink it. It really has some great flavors to it. 
The mouthfeel is heavy and somewhat slick with carbonation being very low to non-existent. Great mouthfeel fir what it is. 
Overall it was such a unique and delicious beer. Very complex with a lot of really great, bold flavors to it. It was a little hot and boozy, but that was expected for what it is. Wonderful beer overall. 1,337 charactersbillab914, Jan 27, 2012

A: For not being carbonated and expecting a sort of liqueur-type of beer, this is spot on. Clear ruby/brown/copper colored body with naturally no head. Brilliant alcohol legs coat the sides of the glass as you swirl it a few times, like a fine distilled spirit would. This is what I expected and it looks wonderful.
S: Tons of sweet maple syrup notes, brown sugar, alcohol, caramel, raisin, oak and burnt sugar. This smells like no beer you've had before. It's most comparable I can think would be to a brandy of sorts, I've heard some people say cognac though I've never had that spirit. You can literally smell the booze on the pour, this could bring a bit of heat.
T: Wow, that is remarkable. Again, tons of sweet maple syrup coat the mouth, brown sugar, vanilla and huge oak barrel notes eventually break through. This is sweet, and a bit boozy at first. The more you sip, the less heat you notice, though it does come back to remind you with the warming sensation in your chest. Melted caramel and some dark fruits come back towards the end, but the maple syrup sees this beer through and through.
M: Sticky, smooth and full-bodied. This drink is like no other beer. See a common theme? Again, this drinks like a nice full-bodied spirit, a fine brandy or whiskey. Hot in the chest after the swallow.
This is a serious treat to have. I'm very glad I pulled the trigger on this large purchase, however I'm not sure I'd do it again. Sure, it's unique, it's delicious but it's pricey as hell. One to absolutely make sure you experience in your life but something not needed to always be on hand. 1,733 charactersShanePB, Jan 15, 2012

A: It's just gorgeous. A brilliant and crystal clear copper, ruby, brown, tobacco sunburst color that practically radiates in the glass. Lacing, head? Hell no. This is a 27% ABV beer. Don't expect it, because you sure as hell won't get it. Beautiful oily legs absolutely coat the sides of the glass. Incredible.
S: I can smell the maple barrels from 3 feet away. Hot damn this thing is hot. Loads of maple syrup, raisin, brown sugar, oak, vanilla, and a metric crap ton of booze. Seriously, this burns. But it burns in a delicious, sexy way. It's delicious smelling. Great.
T: Wow, this is a sipper indeed. Thick, sticky maple syrup, raisin, brown sugar, vanilla, dark fruit, oak tannins, and loads of booze. Significant alcohol burn here, but it somehow manages to be enjoyable and, dare I say it, smooth? Goodness gracious this is an amazing beer, if you can call it a beer. It's definitely more of the cognac, sherry, brandy, port vibe. This is a "holy sh*t" moment. Absolute, no doubt, grand slam.
M: It's boozy, but the maple, dark fruit, vanilla, and raisin flavors absolutely crush. Flavors are perfectly integrated and makes this the perfect after supper sipper. Great.
O: I mean, it's a $200 bottle of beer. Can I tell you to buy this with a straight face? Hell yes I can. It's worth it. Team up with your buddies, split it 10 ways, I don't care what you do. Just make sure you get your hands on a 2 oz. pour of Utopias while you are still a beer fanatic. It is unlike anything I have ever had before. It truly is a port, but man is it lip-smackingly tasty. It definitely drinks boozy, but somehow maintains a pleasantness and smoothness that is unbelievable. If you have the budget, grab this one. Sort out the details later, up to and including charging your bestest buds $20 a pop for their pours. 1,901 characterssiege06nd, Jan 07, 2012

2011 vintage
A generous pour yields a cognac like liquid, still and a brownish/copper/amber color. Aromas of Madeira wine, brandy, butterscotch, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, alcohol, vague fruits. A complex nose that boasts a lot of character. In the taste, concentrated Munich malts, chocolates, vanilla, dry oak, generic fruits, bourbon, sherry, brown sugar, alcohol, toffee, maple, candy, and butterscotch. Mouth-feel is slick, chewy, right around medium bodied but no carbonation. Like a fine liquor. Overall, Utopias is a beast of a beer, and pushes the boundaries of what beer really is and can be. I recommend trying this, but a whole bottle would last me a long long time. Boston Beer Company can consider this one a success and a brew worthy of a great celebration. I say force carbonate this and see what happens. 847 charactersStinkypuss, Jan 02, 2012

S- the smell is what pulls you in. As soon as you open the bottle, you are immediately hit with the smell is caramel, oak and vanilla. It is delicious!! You can smell the booze but the other aromas are much more apparent. 
T- tastes like it smells. Right away you pick up on the sweetness, very oaky with vanilla notes. On the back end you get the caramel that coats your mouth. At 27% alcohol you can taste the booze but I have beers with a third of the alcohol level as this where the boozy taste is overwhelming. Complex flavors that mingle very well together.
M- very smooth feel. Coats your mouth at the end with the caramel flavor. Certainly feels more like a brandy or another type of liquor.
O- I have wanted to try this for a long time. This is one of the best beers I have tried this year. Very unique beer. Love the smell and flavors of this beer. 969 charactersCord018, Jan 01, 2012

Cracked this beauty after finding out I passed the first step in my Engineering licensure.
Poured into the official Sam Adams Utopias snifter. From an awesome looking ceramic bottle shaped like a kettle.
A – Pours a very nice and rich copper color, almost a darker copper with some slight golden edges. Absolutely no head at all but definitely some nice alcoholic “tear drops” form on the side of the glass as it is twirled. Very nice looking beer? (4.5)
S – Wow. I was note expecting this nose. Sweet smells of Bourbon and molasses. Sweet slightly roasted caramel notes with very sweet and malty grain. Dark fruit notes with some raisins and some prunes. There is some slight vanilla and maple syrup as well. The nose is pretty amazing. Definitely some boozy notes. Ahh, sweet alcohol. Very complex. (4.5)
T & M – Very sweet and complex! Wow. I’m quite impressed because I didn’t know what to expect. I get some sweet bourbon aged notes. There is molasses, melty caramel and some slight vanilla notes. Maple syrup and raisin pop up during the middle portion of the beer. There was some slight alcoholic burn beginning in the middle and following the brew all through the end. However, this feeling wasn’t overwhelming or too hot. It was just warm enough to please the palette. The raisins really pop in this one and so do the slight vanilla hints on the back end. Mouthfeel is nice and oily, like melted syrup or honey. Very nice and smooth like velvety liquid goodness. (4.5) (4.0)
O – I was always kind off intimidated by the brew especially because I thought that for the price I would not enjoy it. I must say I’m very surprised, pleasantly. It is very delicious. I don’t know If I would drop the 150 on the bottle every time but I know that this bottle will last me a while and I will enjoy it thoroughly. Very complex, delicious and well crafted. Nice job BBC. Definitely my fave of your brews. (4.5) 1,961 charactersJoEBoBpr, Dec 18, 2011

Poured a still, fairly clear brown with nice "legs" that coat the glass as you swirl. HUGE aromas of sweet malt, raisins, sherry, maple syrup, Tootsie Rolls, and alcohol. Taste is...wow. Much like the nose, tons of malt, oak, raisins, figs, sherry,and sweet maple syrup. Obviously boozy, but so complex and surprisingly drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and sticky, with the requisite alcohol "burn". Such an amazing experience, I don't know how long I'd sit on a bottle if I had one, I could drink a ounce or two of this every evening as a nightcap! 609 charactersjsanford, Dec 12, 2011

A: Completely still. Liquor like for sure. Clear amber brown appearance. Some sheeting on the sides of glass. No bubbles. No lacing.
S: Smells boozy for sure. Like a port or a sherry. I definitely get some sweetness (maple and vanilla), some deep fruit, and more booze. 
T: It's VERY sweet. I think on the close you do get the a little of the maple syrup. Sticks on the tongue a while because of the lack of carbonation. Lot of port characteristics. Delicious post dinner drink. I actually enjoyed it MORE than I expected.
M: I have to go full bodied on this, but it seems like I have had RISs that are fuller then this. The only hit is lack of carbonation.
O: Again, pleasantly surprised with this "beer". It's a delicious treat to savor once, but glad I didn't foot the bill for the bottle. An after dinner sweet treat to be enjoyed with dessert. 949 charactersinlimbo77, Dec 06, 2011

A: Copperish brown much like a scottish ale or lighter bock. Almost not head. Coats the glass with a viscosity much like a great red wine.
S: Cognac and sweet malt. Not much like beer.
T: Very sweet up front. The best tasting Cognac. Good. Really smooth and drinkable. Way better than any other high abv beer I've had. Smoother than most 11% abv barley wines.
M: Very sweet and fully bodied. Alcohol is present but not harsh. Sweetness helps mask most of the alcohol.
O: Fantastic beer. Really only would drink on special occasions. Felt sophisticated drinking it. Would want more and more if it wasn't so damn expensive. 691 charactersJerseyKirk, Dec 03, 2011

*From notes
-- I can't thank you enough John, for breaking into this treasure and sharing it with me. --
Vintage 2011
A: A good pour yields no head and no lacing. It pours like a brilliant liquid resin liquor.
S: Alcohol esters and warm creamed caramel. It's condensed and jam packed with dried vine fruit. Absolutely stunning.
T: This is simply on another level. I can honestly say that I've never had a beverage quite like it. It reminds me of the finest madeira, or a thirty year old tawny porto. The smooth fruit here is unmatched. It's boozy, but in a way that compliments every facet. If I hadn't been told this was a "beer", I wouldn't have believed it.
M: Smooth as a baby's ass. It sips like million bucks, as it's got a silky texutre I'ver never before experienced in a beer. The weight is magnificent, yet it's not cloying. A pleasure to drink.
O: What more can I say about Sam Adam's Utopias? This is a jaw dropping achievement. It's perfect in most every way. Is it worth the lofty price tag? Maybe not, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the most memorable libations on planet earth.
Thanks again, Señor Siege. Your generosity is unrivaled. 1,226 charactersRhettroactive, Nov 30, 2011

Appearance: As were my expectations, this has a look I am more accustomed to seeing in a brown liquor, maybe a cognac. A few stray bubbles very briefly collected for a moment before quickly vanishing. 
Smell: Wow, a ton going on here. There is a lot of sweetness, with aromas ranging from vanilla to molasses. Some caramel and other sweet malts are noticeable, as well as oak, some general dark fruits, and maple.
Taste: The flavor has an incredible presence. The sweetness includes caramel, molasses, vanilla, maple, and dark fruits, with a malt that drags on through the finish. Other notes of port and cognac, as well as a general oak character, are present as well. 
Mouthfeel: A huge body, with almost no carbonation and a fairly sticky nature. This is actually one of the few things that clues me in that it is not a liquor; it is sticky instead of dry. It goes down surprisingly smooth with an alcohol presence of a much lower ABV beer.
Overall: When a beer can be opened and still stored for weeks (or months), the line between beer and liquor has justifiably become blurred. There is just an incredible amount of complexity involved with this beer that makes it very difficult to judge. Did I really enjoy it? Yes, it was amazing. Could I drink more than 4 oz.? That would be tough. Do I regularly want to pay $165 for a bottle of it? Probably not. Scoring this beer is difficult. 1,480 charactersKickInTheChalice, Nov 24, 2011

The taste is similar, sweet caramel, root beer, a piney syrup, earthy and root like with some notes of chocolate. Strong whiskey/bourbon notes, lots of heats with a fair bit of sugar left over. Syrupy feel, chewy and viscous, well carbonated and a touch of driness in the finish. Lots going on, spirit like, a touch all over the place. 534 characterscpetrone84, Nov 22, 2011

A: Deep, clear rubeous copper body that leaves tremendous legs. For an intentionally flat, spirituous beer, I couldn’t imagine it being any prettier.
S: Whoa. I expected it to be huge, but it still blew me away. Wood, maple, port, sherry, raisins, whiskey, caramel, leather, tobacco, and piercingly sharp alcohol are all present in relatively equal measure. The overall effect is deep, sweet, and rich, all while being hugely aromatic and piquant. I find the booze to be a bit over the top, though, more akin to an 80-proof whisk(e)y than a 54-proof beer. Still, this must be approached as a spirit rather than a beer, and as such it’s pretty solid.
T: Sweet and hot; caramel, toffee, rum-raisin, sherry, maple, vanilla and oak. Brown sugar and booze on the immensely long finish. Tastes like someone blended two-parts dessert wine, one part whiskey, and one part maple syrup. Fascinating and delicious, but a trifle overbearing with its sweetness. 
M: Thick, sticky, and mouth-coating. Some alcohol tingle as well. A bit too sticky for me, but nicely substantial.
O: Insane. I can’t believe that this is beer, and I especially can’t believe that it was made via natural fermentation. If the booziness of the aroma hadn’t been quite so strong, it would have been truly amazing – the flavors were big, complex, and thoroughly enjoyable. I still don’t think I’ll shell out for a bottle any time soon, but it’s more tempting than ever now that I’ve tried it.

pours out a clear reddish brown color, obviously no head or lace but the thickest, drippest legs ive ever seen.
real big solvent alcohol, almost nail polish remover like. tons of heat felt through the nostrils, like smelling a straight whiskey or bourbon. behind that i detect mostly maple and some dark fruits, molasses, port like wine character, a bit vinious. but that heat is hard to get over in the aroma.
very thick, rich maple sweetness, very nice. boozy, but not nearly as boozy as the aroma might suggest. lots of complexity, dark fruits, vanilla, molasses, burnt sugars, port like wine, a bit of bourbon and charred oak, very nice. each barrel used in the making of this beer is detectable. i exspecially love the very sweet maple syrup character, prolly the most obvious taste. 
obviously a big, huge mouthfeel, super thick, sticky almost, intensely sweet. definatly super warming.
great taste, but i wasnt too crazy about the aroma, way too hot. still, to me this kind of takes away the whole beer drinking expierence at 27%. id love to drink this again, but thats not going to happen with the insane pricetag. an amazing beer non the less, but id prolly take a matt, deliverence, or black tuesday over this. the same big sweet flavors with minimal booze. still...cheers to sam adams for this insane offering! 1,421 charactersdogfishandi, Nov 21, 2011

3.85/5  rDev -12.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42005 edition, 2 oz sample shared with HimerMan.
Pours a syrupy thick deep ruby red with hints of orange. Little to know carbonation, hence no head or lace. 
Aromas of alcohol are immediately evident. Behind that, maple syrup comes through and is quite intense. The aroma is unlike any other beer that I have ever smelled. As it continues to open up I get nice vanilla notes.
The tastes begin with sugary sweetness of maple syrup along with a hint of candied/dark caramelized sugars. The high alcohol content is evident from the second the beer hits the tongue. Sweet vanilla and thick sappy maple syrup flavors are prevalent throughout.
The mouthfeel is the epitome of full bodied with zero to mild carbonation. Finish is slightly dry due to the high alcohol but the sweetness and syrupy flavors leave a slick feeling on the palate long after you sip/savor.
Overall, I am glad I was able to sample this beer. It is excellent as a novelty beer, but is is really not beer at this ABV in my opinion. More like an aperitif or a desert wine. Too sweet and boost overall to be enjoyed often or even a few times a year to be honest and boost overall. Recommended definitely tontry once in your beer lifetime and to say that you tried it, but not something I need to revisit anytime soon. 1,285 charactersclaspada, Nov 19, 2011

Palate coating. Alcohol masterfully hidden. Brandy, toffee, booze, oak, port, scotch, smoke. Just terrific. A great choice for an after dinner sipping beer.

4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5November of 2011, a 2007 vintage into a Sam Adams pint glass. Pours still over a brilliant rich caramel-colored liquid. Smells caramel, vanillins, brown sugar, salt, soy, butterscotch schnapps, dusty maple syrup, mild smoke, burnt marshmallow, unripe green apples, honey, potent clean alcohol. Intriguing and inviting aromas. The brown sugar and alcohol pull me in, but the salt is a negative effect.
Tastes sticky sweet with refreshing alcohol burn. Caramel, toffee, oak, char, vanillins, clover honey, strongly of light-colored esters (pear, peach, tamarind), candied plums, salt, sherry, and cognac. Super thick in the mouth with no carbonation and with strong clean alcohol sting makes the beer liquor-like. Easy to hold in the mouth to suck on the flavors and see how the flavors slowly change as my saliva slowly dilutes the sample. Evolves while in the mouth.
One of a kind. Stunning. Complex, balanced, challenging, and yet very personable. Highly recommended. 970 charactersmentor, Nov 14, 2011

Glowing, bronze/copper color with zero carbonation and lots of 'legs'. There is so much going on in the nose, smells so much like cognac with lots of vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee with hints of maple. The balance that is obtained in this beer even with the ABV and the amount of blending and aging is just fantastic. The tiniest of tiny sips explodes on the tongue with so much flavor. This beer is nothing short of spectacular. The smell and taste completely take over your senses. I was lucky to get a sizable portion for sampling. One of the most creative concoction, something every beer aficionado must have at least once in their lifetime. 703 charactersCaptDavyJones, Nov 11, 2011

2011 vintage, bottle 12,560, served at room temperature.
Appearance – Pours a still flat into a sniffer. Held up to the light the beer gives off a dark caramel hue. When swirled around the glass it beads up in different sections as it trickles down. It looks quite fantastic for what it is.
Smell – Molasses and caramel, dark fruits, a slight nuttiness, and of course alcohol.
Taste – Wow. Loads of vanilla and dark fruits up front. The dark fruits begin to mix with sweeter caramel and toffee flavors midway through. There is a slight tinge of alcohol when you first take the sip but it fades. Oak and walnuts and a hint of oxidation it would seem finish up the array of flavors.
Mouthfeel – Completely flat (appropriately), medium bodied, creamy, coats the tongue.
Overall – A very unique and delicious after dinner beer that was enjoyed with good company. I can’t wait to have this again come Thanksgiving and Christmas time. My brother-in-law thought this was absolutely incredible and is also looking forward to visiting this again with a bit more age on it. While one could taste the alcohol, obviously, it was less prominent than one would have expected. A sipper for the ages. 1,300 charactersSpdKilz, Oct 16, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle scored from Argonaut Liquors in Denver, CO $150. 2011 edition, bottle #01833. Into the SA Utopias glass. 
A: Pours a beautiful brown deep with red highlights, no head (which was expected) just a few bubbles around the edge. This beer leaves some serious legs. Excellent clarity. Really a nice looking beer. 
S: Intoxicating aroma, this is the beer that LA's Angel's Share strives to smell like. Tons of maple syrup, vanilla, toffee, a huge amount of caramel as well. Notes of port, sherry, rum, just a nice boozy aroma. A decent amount of oak finds its way in here as well. Smells incredibly rich and sweet. 
T: Breath taking. Such a complex, flavorful beer. Caramel, and toffee, tons of vanilla, rich chocolate, walnuts. A lot of port notes. Rich dark fruit, plums, raisins, and over ripe cherries. Really a long, lingering after taste of raisins though. A touch of bitterness, which I'm not sure if it comes from the 27% alcohol or from hops, hard to say. Awesome amount of oak and the various barrels really shine, more as a melange of awesome as opposed to individual -bals. Really spectacular. 
M: Thick and rich, no carbonation, a bit of warmth but it never really gets hot like other high abv beers are. Quite sticky on the lips. 
O: Spectacular. Not much else to say here. Awesome flavors. Strong booze doesn't get in the way of the flavors either. This beer absolutely has lived up to the hype and everything that precedes it. Very happy to get a shot to try this, and I will enjoy the bottle for quite a while. 1,532 characterspokesbeerdude, Oct 14, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 2009 bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: Pours a dark amber/mahogany color with no carbonation at all.
Smell: Sweet, warm alcohol hits the nose right off the bad. I'm picking up some maple syrup and dark fruit in the nose as well.
Taste: The age has done this well. Still burns, but much smoother than it was when I first got it. Lost of alcohol and very sweet. More like liquor than beer. Very sweet with maple syrup and dark fruit notes. Reminds me a bit of bourbon, there is also some oak. Very complex. The finish is sweet and hot.
Mouthfeel: Thick and a bit syrupy. No real carbonation to speak of with a slick finish.
Overall: Super complex and good. Such a unique beer. I feel like I picked up a new taste every time I took a sip. Definitely will have again. 783 charactersoline73, Oct 05, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed the 2011 release of this beer at the Davis Whiskey Club. Poured into a small snifter at a little below room temperature.
A: Dark Ruby colored body with brown lowlights. Absolutely no head, but the beer is thick and clings to the legs of the glass. 
N: Incredible aroma of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, and booze--very hot! 
T/M: The taste really follows the nose, but is significantly more complex: Oak, vanilla, bourbon, a little dark fruit, maple, toffee, caramel....there is so much going on in this beer! The heat is a little bit overpowering, but the richness of the flavors does decently to stand up to it. The beer is sticky and hot--no carbonation, which makes this seem more like a liquor than anything else. Very dry finish.
This is a fantastic, style-busting beer. I feel very privileged to have tried it...However, at $160/bottle (2011), I am not sure I would ever really want a bottle for myself. The beer is hot and is a great sipper, but it really reminds me of a bottle of Lost Abbey Deliverance, but stronger. Not to detract from the quality of the beer, but I really feel like the price-to-enjoyment ratio just does not pan out on this one for me personally. Good shit though. 1,211 characterspeacebone116, Oct 03, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally opened my 2011 bottle after sitting on it for about 6 months. I couldn't take it anymore! Been wanting to drink this for a long time.
A: Dark mahogany brown with deep ruby red overtones. Pours very thickly...almost like syrup. Leaves heavy, viscous legs and lacing on the sides of the Utopias drinking glass. Very cool...
S: It hits me right away when I open the bottle. Get a very complex melange of: maple syrup, booze, bourbon, toffee, malt, and lots of other aromas I can't quite place. In the words of Ron Burgundy, "it stings the nostrils," but in a good way. :)
T: Really unlike anything I've ever had before. Rich toffee, caramel, maple syrup, nutty oakiness, dark fruit, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar...you name it, it's pretty much there (except for hops). A little hot kick on the back end from the booze but as I get about 1/2 way through the 2oz pour, that starts to dissipate (or else I'm getting buzzed and I don't care anymore) I know it's been said before, but it pretty much defies all styles to me. It is delicious. 
M: Viscous and syrupy. Doesn't take much on my tongue to get the full flavor profile. For a beer this thick and this high of an ABV, mouthfeel kind of goes out the window for me. It's about as good as one can expect, but 2oz is plenty.
Overall, this was well worth the wait. I love it and am glad that I bought a bottle. I plan to enjoy it slowly over time with friends and for occasions. 1,438 charactersbcostner1, Oct 03, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Been seeking this one for years and I luckily got to pour it at the 2011 Rare Beer Tasting at the Wynkoop. 
It was on draft (a keg likely worth $6-7K) , and I got to try it both cooler and closer to room temperature. As it warms, I'd say the maple character comes out more in both the nose and taste.
From the tap it literally looks almost like maple syrup coming out. Very thick and viscous. It's roughly a chestnut brown color and is almost completely flat. It looks to be slightly more active than say, a brandy or whiskey, but there's no real carbonation.
The nose is less boozy than I figured. It reminds me a bit of an aged barleywine. Really heavy on the malt character. Almost like a mix of malt syrup and liquor, but not quite so hot.
The flavor's a welcome surprise and while it's definitely strong, it's a long way from being as strong as a liqueur. Brown sugar and maple along with that ever-present heavy malt syrup character. It should be noted that I LOVE malt syrup, so this isn't a bad thing! Compared with the other stronger beers I've had (ranging from 16-19%) I don't really think it's as boozy as I though it might be. It wasn't even as alcoholic tasting as some other beers I had the same day.
The texture is definitely closer to a liqueur than a beer. It's a hair thicker, but not by a lot. Still, at nearly 30% ABV, that's actually pretty ideal. 
It's tough to review this as a beer simply because it's pushing boundaries of all sorts. It's somewhere between a barleywine, a liqueur, and even a spirit.
A modern marvel that's quite tasty in its own right. I'm not sure I'll go rushing out to buy a $150 bottle any time soon, but then again, I am tempted... 1,680 charactersDomingo, Oct 01, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I won a 4 ounce sample of the 2011 vintage at a festival, best 10 bucks ever spent. Poured into a tasting glass, dark brown headless pour. The aroma is amazing, oak, vanilla, bourbon, hot booze. The taste is as amazing as the aroma, finishes with lingering caramel and vanilla. The beer is smooth and sticky, no carbonation actually makes it smoother. The beer exceeded what I was expecting, my first 5, I definitely will be looking for more. 442 charactersbonkers, Sep 25, 2011
3.96/5  rDev -10.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass.
2011 vintage
A: Clear, dark amber color with no foam head. No lacing remains on the glass, although impossibly long legs are displayed.
S: Hot spirituous bourbon prevails here, showing many interesting facets and remarkable depth that speak to the more subtle contributions of other spirit barrels involved. Its volatility invades the nose, carrying with it notes of vanilla and dark fruit.
T: Begins extremely sweet, with potent fruit qualities, carnivorous savoriness, and strong ethyl alcohol. Brown sugar is revealed as a flavor component in the middle as the aggressive fruit recedes. Flavors generally lack octane later, becoming unexpectedly mellow after the early booze-driven assault. The finish is mildly woody but not bitter, preserving the lingering brown sugar from the middle.
M: Medium viscosity, evaporating on the palate like a pure spirit, with no carbonation. Alcohol is palpably hot, stinging the palate, and invisible solids are felt.
D/O: At first encounter this beer exhibits a convulsion-inducing quality that reminds of the way that an actor takes a stiff drink. Its early flavors overwhelm the senses while remaining true to the smell. It is able to lift the bourbon and other spirits from the wood successfully, yet their presence is short-lived. The latter two acts are surprisingly vacant--not by the standards of normal beer, but in this case compared to the beginning. Utopias may be the poster-child of extreme beer in America, possibly in need of a new style that is the plank-owner of. 1,567 charactersbeagle75, Sep 19, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Generous 4oz sample courtesy of Peter Chiodo. Thanks again! Savoured in a Samuel Adams Utopias glass. 
Pours a clear reddish brown with no head or lacing, as expected. Resembles a fine cognac. 
Robust and layered nose is sherry, bourbon, oak barrel, maple syrup, caramelized sugar, fusel alcohol, dark pit fruit, hazelnut, vinous red wine aromas, vanilla, and cream. 
Taste is sticky sweet malts, toffee, more cream and vanilla, caramel, sherry, warming liquor, brown sugar, a little tartness, boozy burn to end. A remarkably delicious spirit-like beer. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied, slick and oily middle, no carbonation, long drying finish with some heat in the throat. Satisfying. 
Overall, this outrageous Strong Ale represents a huge achievement in craft brewing. Prior to tasting, I didn't know if I'd enjoy it since I'm not a big fan of hard liquor. However, it defied my expectations with its smooth, bold flavours and enormous depth of character. A boundary-pushing ASA that further expands the notion of what beer can be. 1,033 characterscratez, Sep 16, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Shared by jrallen34 before Sean's b-day party in Chicago (thanks Jason!). I've seen it previously for $150-199, never felt like throwing that much coin at a small bottle. So I was pretty glad to get a taste of this first.
It pours with no carbonation, clear copper color and no head. The aroma is really strong in a flavorful way, toffee/molasses and sherry, sweet smelling and like a liqueur.
Extremely tasty too, like an amaretto or sherry, sweet malts and alcohol, toffee and so forth, awesome. Burning aftertaste but not as burning as cognac. I liked it a lot more than I'd imagined I would.
Absolutely a magnificent example of how far beer can go. Worth $150+? Maybe or maybe not, at least the bottle will last a long time as a night cap beer. 751 charactersTurdFurgison, Sep 04, 2011

S - Boozy, but has a sweet, maple aroma.
T - Not as boozy as the ABV or aroma leads on. Warm.
M - Has a nice, boozy tingle, nice prescence, and surprisingly drinkable. Very smooth, silky.
O - I was a bit apprehensive about the overall experience with this one, based on ABV, but Utopias is surprisingly drinkable. 405 charactersFUNKPhD, Aug 24, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Mahogany in color with very noticeable ruby highlights throughout the beer. No head or carbonation, but that was known before I even poured.
S- BOOZE. Although this is not the only thing, its hard for it not to be the first thing you observe (and not surprising at 27% alcohol). Beneath the alcohol is maple syrup sweetness as well as figs and strong dark fruits. At the finish of each whiff is a stinging alcohol in the nostrils.
T- Strong dark fruits; figs, plums, and raisins. Sweet taste throughout the beer, best description I could give is it is that it is very "rich". Although the alcohol is quite noticeable from the get go, it rises towards the end with a strong bite on the tongue and a warming sensation with each sip. A very interesting and enjoyable maple syrup aftertaste.
M- A certain creamy feel even with the alcohol bite (if that makes sense) in the beginning which is followed up with a finishing hard alcohol bite on the tongue. No carbonation, warming alcohol sensation.
O- This, as expected, was a very different beer. Incredibly rich with an interesting alcohol bite that would intrigue those who enjoy sipping on bourbon. Seeing the high price on this beer gives me the lingering suspicion that I have tried it for both the first and last time. What a foreboding feeling. 1,303 charactersLolli1315, Aug 23, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this at the saucer. It was poured from the bottle and served by the ounce. Poured into a small snifter.
Appearance- dark reddish brown, clear and syrupy. Clings to the glass as you swirl it around.
No head, no visible carbonation.
Smell- molasses and brown sugar. Alcohol is a caramelized scotch(as if it were reduced by heat). Very sweet, strong alcohol.
Taste- Sweet up front, but not as complexly sweet as the nose. Alcohol bite, but not as much as I expected. Very caramel and molasses.
Feel- much lighter than it looks and smells. Still a bit sticky.
Overall, very good, but not what I expected with the hype and price. I have a feeling it will be amazing in time! 680 charactersLadyOfMuchBeer, Aug 23, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My 250th review on BA. 
2011 Vintage. 
This was available at Boulevard Tavern in Gateway - Fort Myers, FL. 2 ounce pour from the 750ml Utopias bottle into a snifter by the bartender. 
Appearance: Pours a clear dark brown color reminiscent of flat cola. No head, no lacing as to be expected from a beer of this ABV%. There are nice legs to it reminiscent of a nice whiskey or cognac. 
Smell: Sweet caramel, wet walnuts, dark fruits and alcohol. It smells hot, but not overpoweringly so. 
Taste: Sweet caramel, vanilla, dark fruit. This is very complex and delicious. The alcohol is obviously there, but it doesn't overpower the flavors at all. There is a nice nutty/woody characteristic that's hard to define. The aftertaste is sweet and wonderful. Overall, the flavor is quite sweet and I love it. 
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and quite creamy. No carbonation at all. There's a clear alcohol burn going down, which is to be expected. 
Drinkability: High drinkability. I really wish I had more than this 2 ounce pour. I could drink a few of these. 
Overall: Amazing beer overall. I am so glad that I shelled out $15 for a 2 ounce pour. This would rate as as good a whiskey/cognac as I've ever had. Phenomenal. If you have the chance, try it. 1,243 charactersadam42381, Aug 19, 2011

A: Chestnut brown, clear, no carbonation to speak of. No bubbles for lacing but stuck to the sides of the glass like a well aged bourbon or scotch.
S: Alcohol and molasses are the first impressions. Smells like an old scotch.
T: Tastes like an old scotch. Big alcohol burn, but that could've been from the habanero sour cream. Very sweet up front up front. Reminds me a bit of the Avery demon series with the bourbon-y flavor. 
MF: Very smooth to drink but very sticky.
Overall i was not let down at all. been waiting a while to try this beer. At 27%, if i had a bottle it would take a long while to get through it, the sheer cost would also be a consideration. 782 charactersshoky01, Aug 18, 2011

Full mouthfeel and biting on the tongue. No carbonation and quite burning from the alcohol.

Huge aroma of vanilla, caramel and maple syrup-it comes at you from even down on the counter in the glass. Lightly oaked. Just a gamut of flavors-huge caramel/maple flavors. Vanilla and oak. Trace of booziness. Serious malty quality going on. Decent mouthfeel-very sticky and gummy-has to be from residual sugars but still nice. Just a great experience all in. Obviously a sipper-small doses and special occassions are just the thing. 467 characterslackenhauser, Jul 21, 2011

Pours a clear deep copper color with zero head.
From the beginning this one doesn’t act like beer. The aroma is sweet maple syrup, caramel malt, cognac, vanilla, and dark fruits. The alcohol is not overly apparent. 
The flavor has a high level of sweetness. More maple syrup, caramel, dark fruits, vanilla, and alcohol that diminishes with each sip. I might stress that this is a sipper. 
Thick mouthfeel, viscous, and becomes more smooth as it warms.
This was enjoyable especially since I didn’t pay for the bottle. It barely resembles beer. This is much more like an after dinner drink. I like it, but I'm sure it's not for everyone. 655 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

Pours a dark amber with obviously no head, but it does leave some serious legs on the glass as it is swirled. Huge aroma with big molasses, some brown sugar, a significant amount of booze (unsurprisingly), brandy, and vanilla. Taste is pretty sweet, but not cloying. The molasses and brown sugar are present. Brandy and vanilla comes through as well. A little bit of maple. The alcohol is certainly present, but surprisingly restrained given the ABV and the amount present on the nose. Full bodied. No carbonation. Drinks similar to something like a cognac, but the beer qualities are certainly there. Unique and enjoyable. I'm glad to have tried it. 664 charactersjethrodium, Jul 15, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 Vintage. 1 ounce pour at City Beer Store, in San Francisco. $20. 
Samuel Adams Utopias has a colour worthy of its gorgeous bottle; you'd expect a beer of this nature to be more like a cognac and, indeed, it very much resembles one. It has a deep tawny hue (that turns a blazing scarlet into the light) and is pristinely clear. Somewhere along the way it appears to have traded in its foamy head for a set of sticky, teardrops legs. 
Smelling is certainly the most time-consuming part of the Utopias experience. In terms of bouquets, there really is nothing else out there quite like this. (Not in the beer world anyhow, although again the similarities to cognac are apropos.) Given notes of dark fruits (plum, red grape) and treacle, I'd say a doppelbock is the closest, but even then you're comparing apples to oranges (that are blended from bourbon, sherry, brandy, cognac and pure oak casks). 
Getting around the alcohol in the aroma can be a tricky ordeal, especially if you're not accustomed to such potency. But the air will wear down some of those esters, provided a steady regiment of swirling. The taste, on the other hand, never really has that problem - it is surprisingly much smoother than its strong smell would have you assume. 
Notes of bourbon, wild honey, vanilla, macerated dark fruit and molasses show up on the palate much as they do in the nose. Here, however, without a cloud of fumes, we can appreciate even more flavours, notably those of maple syrup and a super abundance of clean oak wood. And on the palate we can actually taste familiar (but fortified) maltiness. Still, it is far more like a mead (fermented honey) than any other beer I've tried.
Those around the brewery have taken to calling this "sweet fire" but to be quite frank it is far more palatable those most spirits, at least to this non-spirit drinker. It has enough heat to soothe a sore throat, but it doesn't scathe it. You won't need a glass of water near by. And while part of it is aged in bourbon-barrels, it isn't obliterated by the bourbon like so many other offerings. Instead it has lush vanilla, tons of oak and a brandy-like richness. 
Sam Adams Utopias was the longest one ounce of beer I've ever drank. It was certainly the most expensive and probably the most impressive too. I wanted to take the glass home with me just to keep smelling it - good thing I couldn't, I bet weeks later my girlfriend would be pleading with me to finally wash the thing. And I still wouldn't want to. Drinking Utopias after awhile you sort of get lost in another world... and you don't want to leave it. 2,603 charactersbiegaman, Jul 15, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Fairly dark but clear copper color with a slight ruby hue. Obviously there isn't any head but it has a thick and slick look.
S - Alcohol heat comes out strong but it doesn't detract from other aromas. Strong caramel and brown sugar. Touches of dark fruit and vinous aroma along with some vanilla. Sweet, thick, syrupy aroma with a strong alcohol aroma.
T - Alcohol burn is surprisingly well hidden. Very complex with sweet caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and syrup providing the background. Some dark fruit from the port also comes out with a slight vinous flavor but mostly plum and raisin. A nice vanilla kick shows up occasionally. Butterscotch and toffee are also pretty strong. 
M - Medium to full body with no carbonation. Very sticky with a warming but not burning feel. Great to sip on.
D - Very nice sipping beer. Warming but not burning feel with increasingly complex flavors. Wonderful beer to sip on for awhile.
Notes: Had a 1 - 1.5 oz snifter at The Sanctuary in Iowa City. Very nice beer to sip on with amazing flavors and a nice warming feel. Alcohol was surprisingly well hidden. I loved how the barrels affected this beer; they really helped make this an excellent sipper. 1,198 charactersFreshHawk, Jul 13, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Amber color, no head, but really nice legs.
The smell burns, impressive boozy nose, brown sugar.
Syrupy, stingy, plenty of sherry, walnut and maybe cherry. Candied pecans? Kinda vague Swiss cheese. There's a trace of malt, but not much that suggests beer. Lots of grape.
Mouthfeel is that of liqueur, what did you expect?
Impressive, complex. It's a malt liqueur, and aged in everything. Tastes kind of like everything, but not a clash. Paired with Fritos Flavor Twists (Honey BBQ). It's a pedestrian pairing, but the sweetness and potency of the Utopias does pair pretty well with the MSG and sodium of the twists. 619 characterszaphodchak, Jul 09, 2011

A: No head or carbonation, no surprise as I expected something like a cognac or bourbon in look and it does. Caramel brown crimson in color with plenty of legs left on the glass.
S: Super complex and inviting, could smell this every day and be happy. Tons of brown sugar and port notes emanate from the glass with super complex dark fruit and plenty of oak pulp. Maple, lots of alcohol sweet and savory, and heat in the nostrils of course. Vanilla, grape, and bourbon like notes. Wow!
T: Again, a huge complex beast. Tons of cherry in brown sugar, toffee, caramel, maple soaked oak, bourbon or port like alcohol, prunes and raisins, barley, vanilla coke, lots of spice maybe nutmeg?, dark fruit, holy crap. Jarringly complex flavor, if not for the heat it might be a 5.
M: Lots of heat, but thats expected, come on. drinks like a sipping liquor. 
Overall a hell of a 'beer' thats more like a sipping whiskey or port. Very cool, would love another 2oz of this in the future. Very interesting how they brewed this without icing, and you can tell because its far better than the 'iced' beers out there. 1,198 charactersDreadnaught33, Jul 07, 2011

I owe you one.
A - Brown cognac liquor colored body; no carbonation whatsoever; nice legs formed on the glass like a healthy wine; has a slight reddish colored hue; looks like a watery maple syrup
S - Brown sugar; maple syrup; caramel; very, very high ABV aroma, which burns the nostrils; oatmeal; raisin; graham crackers; dates; Marsala wine and molasses
T - High ABV flavor profile hits the tongue and burns for a bit; then a nice light liquor layer coats the tongue and the beer finishes off with a caramel creme brulee and maple syrup flavor; between that well orchestrated dance are hints of raisin, dates, brown sugar oatmeal; flan; Marsala wine
M - Airy brown sugar oatmeal aftertaste lingers for quite a while (fine with me); creamy and syrupy; chewy thick feel; airy
D - Wow! What can I say, I love this stuff, absolutely worth the wait; great across the board; I really liked this beer; could have been a bit thicker, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it; I really can't get enough of the smell, my nose was pretty much shoved in the glass for a whole minute; great aromas and fantastic taste; great job SA!

2003 vintage, huge thanks to John for starting things off with this in the wee hours of the morning. It was dark so hard to see, but seemed like a deep dark murky brown or purple in the little light I had to work with. The smell was rich syrupy caramel. The taste followed the nose fairly sweet, but extremely drinkable. I only had a very small sample but this went down smooth and warmed me up immediately on a tiny sip as I battled the weather at that ungodly hour of the morning. A beer like this is unique and surprisingly together...the fact that you can drink it and reseal it and it will still last for years makes it really an anamoly, but it works. 720 characterscosmicevan, Jul 05, 2011

Big, huge thanks to my friend Chris for sharing. All reviews from notes taken at the time of the tasting.
A:
2003: Poured a cloudy, very light copper color with obvious zero carbonation.
2007: Slightly darker than the 2003 yet lighter than the 2009 and the 2011. Almost a pure copper. This vintage was clear, not cloudy and again and as always without carbonation.
2009: This was the darkest vintage of the four I tried - a deep amber as opposed to copper in color. Crystal clear and zero carbonation.
2011: Crystal clear, pure copper, darker than the 2007, yet slight lighter than the 2009. Zero carbonation here as well.
S:
2003: The first thing that hits my nose was the sweetness of the brown sugar. Followed closely by caramel. Oaky alcohol follows quickly behind the sweetness and really envelops the nose. It is, however, significantly less prevalent in the 2003 vintage than any of the other vintages.
2007: The alcohol backed down a bit from the 2009 and 2011 but was still a very dominant force in the nose of this one. It definitely had some fruit-sweet smell to it as well that wasn't obnoxious but was really settled in nicely between the alcohol, the oak, and the caramel. Very nice, complex smells are really separating well in this vintage.
2009: Malty sweetness combined with oak-aged whiskey (and the alcohol within) notes take home the awards for most obvious smells. There was some slight fruit tones to it but the alcohol quickly slapped them away.
2011: Strong oak and strong alcohol notes dominate the nose. It lets some of the toasted malts and caramel come through but by then your nose is burnt from sniffing such a strong beer that it's tough to pick out the complexities.
T:
2003: Oak and malty sweetness are the first things to hit the mouth followed by some brown sugar. This thing is really nice but it has less fruit notes than the 2007, which for me was really the cat's meow. This one definitely had the taste of a really nice port that was either mixed with a nice sherry or perhaps aged in barrels that were used to age sherry. It was my second favorite and the gap wasn't all that far put far enough to matter.
2007: Ok, here we go. This vintage stood out to me the most because of its complexity and how the fruit notes were able to shine through without being lost completely (see the 2003 notes). The alcohol backed away significantly from the 2009 and especially the 2011. Sweet caramel notes took the dance floor first and moved quickly aside to make way for the star of the show - the black cherry sweetness that danced a tango with the tart of plums. The tartness danced long after the sweetness took a bow and exited stage-right. It was the longest I've ever savored a beer and with reason. I didn't want to swallow it...it was that good.
2009: The sweetness of the brown sugar and caramel were quickly moved aside by the heat and taste of alcohol. It was nice and there was some fruit tones but much of it was diminished by that oaky-alcohol flavor that is nice, but just not all that complex. Granted, it was nicer than the 2011 but could use another 2-3 years to really come into it's own.
2011: Now I would have expected the 2011's most dominant flavor to be the alcohol, but it really wasn't it was a nice blend of alcohol, caramel and fruit (plums? grapes?) mixed with the high sweetness level of the malts. It's really interesting and you can tell it's just a baby compared to the rest of them. It's still really nice.
M: Generally for the most part, each vintage had a very similar mouthfeel. It was really warm all the way through, from when it first hits your lips all the way to about 2-3 minutes after the swallow. A really smooth burn...nice heat. Also, the sweetness lends to a sticky mouth feel, a bit like a liquor. It got smoother as it got older and the heat backed way down each vintage as well.
O: This is really a unique and special "beer." I put beer in quotes for the obvious reasons that it just isn't like any other beer. It lacks carbonation and that's weird to be drinking a beer that doesn't have carbonation but the overall complexity contained within that copper-kettle bottle is one of the biggest reasons to go find this beer. 4,467 characterssuspect, Jun 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Massive thanks goes out to cmrillo who shared this one with the group at the "Evening Wood" tasting graciously hosted by cmrillo as well! 2005 Vintage (OH SNAP!)! Bottle #8458! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured ruby red with a very minimal off-white head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, alcohol (duh), and wood. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, BIG alcohol (no shocker here), peat, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with very low carbonation. Overall this brew was excellent. I'm really glad I finally got the opportunity to give this one a shot. I thought this was going to kill me on the alcohol, but Sam Adams did a fantastic job on making it as sweet as possible to cut back on the burn and overwhelming alcohol flavor you get in other high ABV brews. Really enjoyed getting the chance to try this one. This one only came out during the tasting for one of two reasons I think... Either A) Rillo was really drunk or B) I mentioned to him that I had never tried Utopias before. Either were possible at this point honestly. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I got the chance and I am seriously debating on buying a bottle for myself in the future based on this experience dispite the high price. 1,292 charactersthagr81us, Jun 28, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 Edition - 1oz (maybe 2 oz) poured into a cognac snifter.
A: Syrup. Laces the glass as if it doesnt want to let go. 
S: Good gracious. Upon first whiff, I'm overwhelmed with smells. My nose doesnt even know how to handle everything coming at it. Raisins are the first thing that breaks through along with a molasses/brown sugar combination and finishes with a hint of bourbon/booziness. Each smell is a new experience.
T/M: Punches you in the face right from the start. The flavors are as complex as the smell. Overwhelmingly delicious, I swirl the first tiny sip in my mouth for a prolonged period of time unwilling to let go. The booze is obviously present, but despite the high ABV the other, more complex flavors shine through in the end. 
Overall, this is an beer experience unlike any other I've had before. You NEED to try this 'beer' - if only just for one sip. The complexity of this blew me away. Its defines the term sipper. Unbelievably impressive creation. Cheers to Sam Adams! 998 charactersBCGabbo, Jun 24, 2011

A: Pours brown with no head whatsoever. Something you would expect from a beer. A beer.
S: Huge caramel and brown sugar characteristics. Super malty and sweet alcohol. 
T: More of the same as with the nose. Caramel and toffee candy, quite sweet, but never cloying. Boozey and heavy on the alchohol. Like a sweet liquor. 
M: Full-bodied, no carbonation, very smooth.
O: Not really in the beer catogory. This is more of a novilty. But glad I had the chance to try it. Would spend the 20 bucks a glass again.
Serving type: bottle into a taster. 681 charactersFARGO619, Jun 24, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: Nice rich amber burgundy color. No head or carbonation to speak of but it leaves nice streaks down the glass when you swirl it.
S: The first thing that hits you is the smell of booze, it's rather strong and shocking. Next you get some nice rich warm chocolately aromas and it blends into a port/sherry scent with some hints of dried plums and dark fruit. It also has some nice nutty sweetness to it.
T: The beer starts with a nice rich port/grape sweetness and some hints of the oak aging. The beer has some good undertones of chocolate and roasted malt that have a little bite from the hops. It also has some bourbon type vanilla undertones.
D/O: Great way to stretch the definition of beer yet again. Strong flavors that remind me of other liquors while still staying true to the traditional methods. Might not appeal to some but it's a great blend of flavors. 865 characterspzrhsau, Jun 19, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a tulip
A: Thick in texture. There’s absolutely no head, expectedly. It has a deep, hazy brown color, a lot like a heavy Christmas cider. 
S: The aroma is strong, it stings the nostrils. I bet it’s made with bits of real panther, so you know it’s good. What’s nice is that the initial alcohol aroma gives way to a cornucopia of scents: sweet caramel, almonds, smooth butterscotch, you really need to digest it through your nose before you digest it through your mouth. 
T/M: Once you absorb the aroma, the taste adds another layer of complexity to the mix: strong alcohol closely followed by sweet molasses and caramel, tangy raisins, smooth nuttiness and a vanilla finish. It’s incredibly complex and borderline outlandish. As long as you enjoy it slowly, it’s akin to tasting a fine, sweet bourbon. 
This is not your regular beer and shouldn’t be consumed as such. Appreciate this for what it is instead of what you expect it to be and it’s rather incredulous. I’m not really sure if it’s worth the price, but it’s definitely incredulous. I’m just glad I was able to partake. 1,124 charactersTheBeerAlmanac, Jun 18, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm going to go with "bottle." This review is for the 2011 vintage, poured into a petit brandy snifter.
Utopias pours a deep amber, ruby red with zero visible carbonation. When held up to the light, it gives off glints of chestnut. This beer redefines "coating the glass": swirling it around, it could easily be armagnac or port. 
Certainly the hottest beer I've ever smelled - I got all 27% of Utopias upon first sniff. I've never experienced a nasal burn after smelling a beer before. Underlying that alcoholic singe is an incredibly rich melange of oak, leather, deep dried fruits and candied sugar. Sweet, rich and decadent.
My God the taste is smooth. There is an astonishingly small degree of alcohol bite - I felt a warming sensation shortly after starting in on my 1 (shoot me, 1.5) oz. pour, but that was the only real clue. The flavors really shine through here: leather, oak, vanilla, plums and molasses blend seamlessly. More viscous than scotch but thinner than most after-dinner liqueurs, this has a lush and pleasingly syrupy mouthfeel.
Utopias was an odd choice for a sunny June evening in Boston, but then again it does sort of make the evening its own. I'll be curious to see how it pairs with a roaring fire in December. 1,243 charactersamphion1065, Jun 16, 2011

S: Booze, booze and booze followed by candied sugar, some dried fruits, vanilla and a bit of candied nuts.
T: Sweet like a fine port or dessert wine. Notes of brown sugar, vanilla and candied fruit.
M: No carbonation, but who needs it with something like this. THis is a sipping beverage. Slightly oily.
O: Hard to even call this a beer. It really is like a sipping after dinner drink. Loads of complexity. It was amazing. 478 charactershamilton23, Jun 13, 2011
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured out of the bottle, 1.5 oz pour at ChurchKey DC into a snifter. Vintage 2011.
Dark cognac, deep dark amber in appearance in color. Looks like varnish without a film, clear, a few flecks of sediment or either black carbon but nothing real noticeable. Drooping legs expected and shown, red hues given on the edges of stained cherry wood.
Bouquet is concentrated malt first, almost into a paste. Hints of must. Obvious heat but nothing that burns badly, but also gives a burnt caramel sensation, or just slight burnt grain. Toffee, alcohol, wood closet sense but without the feeling something tannic is coming.
Taste is more so less noticeable at first than the mouthfeel. Incredibly sticky toffee sense, then a giant burst of black chewy licorice. Thick bodied with a toffee syrup bent and more malt concentration. The drink doesn't really flow in the palate, it gets stuck.
Cognac sensations but without the burn due to low proof. Finishes with brown sugar, and huge molasses. There is no sense of burn or heat suggested from the nose on this and makes for being very tolerable.
Overall it's a fun drink, but for the amount and price you have to pay I think I'll have to pass but I am very glad I tried it. 1,216 characterssmakawhat, Jun 11, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Purchased by BA guru harrymel and his lovely bride. I had this over at Churchkey. 1.5 oz. pour into a snifter.
A: Maroon, crystal clear, and with no head whatsoever. Hey, Sam Adams has never made any bones about the fact that this is more toward the spirt side as opposed to the beer one right?
S: Huge sugar bomb, with a bit of peppery woodiness mixed in as well. No hops, malt, or anything that might remind you that you are in fact drinking a beer... this was in a whole new category.
T: Fresh slivered almonds on the aftertaste, very port-like, and with a huge sugar profile. Think melted "Astro Pop," with chopped nuts.
M: Sweet, sweet, SWEET... yet still quite glorious. I got a mild prickle from the carbonation after searching, but that totally was not what this brew was about. No lacing.
O: There is no way in God's green earth I would ever pay over $250 a bottle for this stuff... but doesn't everyone say that? Still though, this was pretty damn good. I'm glad it exists for those willing to fork over the big dough, and thanks to harrymel for forking over the dough so I didn't have to. 1,104 charactersChaney, Jun 10, 2011

A- A very interesting brown color. Looks very much like a spirit with a thinner look on the edges. No carbonation at all. The beer is similar in color to a darkish rum.
S- The alcohol and booze hits the nose immediately, and stings a bit. It get some notes of caramel and molassas, as well as some maple. Smells like liqour.
T- Really quite nice. Like a nice clean sherry. More maple, molassas, and caramel. Malts galore, and hints of raisins and dates. It is much smoother than you would think from the nose. 
M- For what they were shooting for, I'd imagine this is perfect. It's a little thick and liqoury, but the flavor just coats your mouth in an amazing way.
O- This was really an amazing beer. Far better than any of the Brewdog crap I've had. It's amazingly complex and tasty. Would love to see what this is like with a few years on it to mellow out the booziness.

i paid $5 just to taste it, which i thought was a good deal even though the pouring was less than one ounce. it still seemed like that was enough to be able to write an adequate review on it anyway.
ATTACK- initially i was shocked by its super super sweetness, although that does make a lot of sense. 
MID-PALATE- there is definitely that strong alcoholic warming sensation as it crosses the palate and goes down.
FINISH- it finished with a tingling which i would usually equate to sherry or brandy drinking because of its strength.
overall, it was a good enough experience, just much different than i had anticipated it would be; this beer surprised me. 664 characterssteffigal22, Jun 01, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 Batch
(A) Pours a completely flat, ruby red color. Clear in the body and texture, very clean. Leaves some really nice legs around the edges of the glass.
(S) Smell is a plethora of fruits and booze. The fruity notes waft up giving you some cherry, some fig, slight bit of plum, dark grapes, some floral aspects linger in there as well. It smells like brandy was poured straight into the glass as the booze smell is quite prominent.
(T) Very rich and heavy on the sweet fruits. Has a bit of maple syrup mixed in with some excess sugars. You definitely get the barrel flavors of the sherry and the port. It drinks most like a lesser aged port. Has a refreshing freshness to it. There is no essence of the alcohol with the exception of some small amount of warmth in the post taste.
(M) Syrup like and ends actually quite pleasant and not as dry as I expected. Has the oily characteristic to it that liquors have but its got a full body to it like a beer should have.
(O) I was expecting a crazy, boozy mess with this one. Something like a huge, high alcohol infused beer but it wasn’t anything of the sort. This is a fantastic beer. 1,142 characterscjacobsen, Jun 01, 2011

A: A beautifully clear caramel brown body with no head to speak of. Swirling in the glass leaves a nice coating or "legs."
S: WOW! Love this smell. A deep and rich nose of raisins along with other dark fruits, brown sugar, vanilla, maple syrup, caramel, and a lot of sherry & port notes. Very complex and inviting. The nose is also very warm, but doesn't take away anything from it.
T: Absolutely amazing! Nose doesn't do this one justice. A wonderfully complex mix of flavors that are very similar to a fine vintage port. There are notes of vanilla, caramel, dark fruits, maple syrup, some nuts, cognac & sherry characters. Very warm as it goes down. 
M: Very warm mouthfeel, but smooth; Full body; No carbonation;
O: If it wasn't as expensive as it is, I would have a really hard time not downing this whole bottle. An amazing beer that I see myself getting every time it comes out. Easy to drink, great complex characteristics, and a special treat for the holidays. 1,047 charactersBrewCrew2010, May 29, 2011

4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Note* Had this at Bar35 as part of their SA Utiopia release beer tasting. Sample size was a shot glass.
Appearance: Burgundy in color and thin like. 
Smell: Picked up elements of butterscotch, syrup and some high, hot alcohol smells.
Taste & Mouthfeel: While it looked thin, it had a rich palate of molasses, butterscotch, slight pepper taste along with the hotness of the alcohol. I was getting a mouthwatering feel to the ale and a slightly slimy like texture feel coming out of it (though it sounds bad...it was not). Someone at the table said it reminded them of a liquid Werther's Original. 
Overall: S glad I was able to try this....a bottle by itself might have been too much, especially here in Hawaii where the shipping cost is applied to almost everything. It's definitely a sipper. I think the real kicker is the bottle and the feeling of refinement that you get from drinking this ale. Although the taste did live up to the hype and I appreciate the concept, the idea of buying a bottle that is upward into the $160-$200 range seems to be overreaching. 1,068 charactersJuly2Nov, May 26, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage in official utopias glassware
A - Pours with no real carbonation but a few tiny bubbles are seen on the sides of the glass. The color is a very deep reddish brown. Leaves syrupy fingers down the sides of the glass.
S - There is a lot going on here in this beer when it comes to aroma. Raisons, brown sugar, maple syrup, bourbon and alchohol aromas are present. Hops are not noticeable.
T - This beer explodes on your tongue with sweetness and flavor. Maple syrup is very noticable, as well as cherries, vanilla, bourbon. It's hard to pin everything down, but this a tremendously delicious sipping beer. I don't notice any hops in the taste either, and the beer is quite sweet so there must not be much, comparatively speaking to the amount of fermentables. The alcohol is certainly noticeable but not overbearing.
M - The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy and has no carbonation. Slight alcohol burn but I find it to be less than expected for a beer this big.
O - I really enjoyed this beer. It is a very special thing and Sam Adams is a really cool to still be pushing the boundaries of beer. I will certainly buy more of these in the future and see how this beer continues to evolve over the future vintages. 1,223 charactersLosRobots, May 25, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52011 vintage. Sampled and rated on 17 May.
A. Pours amber with brown, orange, some gold, and red with absolutely no carbonation. It coats the glass with what would be described as beautiful slowly dripping legs (if this were wine).
S. Phenomenally complex. Raisins, bourbon, brown sugar, figs, maple syrupy sweetness, brandy, and some nice port character.
T. Lots of maple syrup sweetness, figs, brown sugar, cognac, vanilla, caramelized sugar. This is certainly quite a sweet beer. The hop character is not noticeably present.
M. Thick and luscious. For 27% this is supremely smooth. Certainly a sipping beer (as though you would have any question).
D. People say this is not like a beer, but it really is. It's like an amped up barrel aged beer. I got notes similar to Angel's Share Grand Cru, Raison D'Extra, 10 year old J.W. Lees, and CBS along with notes of cognac and rum. I've been looking forward to this beer for some time now. I'd love to try some other vintages, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. I'll just continue to enjoy this tasty treat a few ounces at a time. 1,092 charactersBeerAndBourbon, May 23, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage. Split with some people, but I had 8oz to myself. Poured a few ounces in a snifter:
A - Really rich brown, mahagoney, caramel color with amber hues and golden tints. No carbonation but a tiny amount of bubbles. Huge legs run along the side of the glass with a gentle sworl.
S - Amazing. According to the tag, this vintage was aged in bourbon, whiskey, port, sherry, brandy and cognac and rest assured, you can smell damn near every one of them. The booze stings the nostrails. Rich toffee, maple syrup, caramel and butterscotch, brown sugar, oak and earth. Really nice.
T - Taste follows the nose. Rich flavors with all the barrels representing themselves. Hot maple syrup. The toffee and rich caramel comes back. Oak and damp barrel are also there. Thick caramel green apples. Really, really nice flavors.
M - Sting from the booze and barrel, but that is expected. Really smooth and heavy, but not in a thick way. No carbonation, just a little sting. Come on, its 27%, what did you expect.
O - I think I'll make this a tradition and get a bottle of newer vintages when they come out. I've had this at a beer best before, but it was a really small amount and I guess I didn't fully appreciate it. To have a bit more of a serving is just wonderful to take in all the textures, flavors and aromas. This is great and I really enjoyed it. A true sipper though... 1,376 charactersjoshuaseresse, May 23, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage. This one is a little hard to assign numerical values to each category as it is so unique, but here it goes. 
This beer pours a dark caramel color and is of course flat so it has no head or lacing, but some nice legs form as the liquid is swirled due to the high alcohol content. The nose is full vanilla, caramel and hot alcohol vapor. I also get notes of black figs and dates. The flavor has all of these flavors plus notes of red grapes, dark cherries, sweet brown sugar, woody oak, and maybe a hint of toffee, bread crust and other sweet sugary fruits. There is a nutty quality with flavors that remind me of ground walnuts. The finish is very sweet and it coasts my mouth in syrupy sugar. The body and mouthfeel are thick and heavy and not as hot as the nose suggests. I wish this beer was more affordable so I could drink it more often, but I can definitely taste the quality. I could drink this every night, and I'm afraid my bottle is starting to get low. My bottle shop still has more, I may have to splurge on another! 1,042 charactersscottfrie, May 23, 2011
3.71/5  rDev -15.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 1.5This tiny little snifter might be the most expensive glass of beer I’ve ever had! 
Deep rich color, a good bit darker than I was expecting from the videos of this I saw on Sam Adam’s site. Bit brandy legs on the glass, of course as expected completely flat and syrupy thick looking.
The nose of a great English barely wine. I’m not sure if this is more Thomas Hardy or J W Lee, but I think both are good examples. I really pick up the Sherry barrels or at least similar notes to the Sherry barrel aged J W Less. It has a certain woody element mixed with a tone of dark sugary fruits. Alcohol is also extremely present and well spoken for here. The aromas here are as intense and powerful as any liquor. True nose candy.
My fear with the flavor was that I’d be drinking a great example of those barely wines at this price, that would not be acceptable! I thankfully have a rather different tasting beer here. The alcohol kick is intense and about as deep and strong as anything I’ve ever had. My belly is as warm from this as 100 proof bourbon. Sweet sugary candy, plums, raisins, oak, vanilla, honey, caramel, hops, cedar, and just so many flavors I can’t describe are in this beer. That said I am picking up a LOT of similarities to this and a good English barely wine…..so much so that I’m not getting nearly the wow factor I had hoped for. 
This beer warms all the way down, with a body that matches the best liquors in density and depth. 
I want to love this beer. The effort and the time spend to create this, 18 year of barrel aging, 6 different barrels blended….I mean how amazing is that effort? The problem is this isn’t coming off as so dramatically different from beers I can get for 6-12 bucks a bottle. There is a flavor here that is in J W Lee that I want to describe, I think perhaps it is a result of the hops, but I just can’t describe it and I didn’t like it in J W Less, but here I’m finding myself more and more interested in it. At 40-50 bucks a bottle this would be outstanding beer, but 170 a bottle makes this simply an incredibly underwhelming experience. I really hate myself for taking this feeling, but beer has to be graded as beer, and frankly this isn’t beer by any normal measure. I’m not sure what color something like this should be or how to score the appearance as it has no comparison. I’m not sure how to score the mouth feel as this is only 27% but the alcohol kicks nearly as well as some smoother bourbons. I’m glad to have tried this, and I’ll enjoy the rest of this bottle. I do hope this ages well open as I can see some rather good changes to come in time. 2,642 charactersbobhits, May 23, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5so, when drinking or reviewing this beer, one has to treat it more as a liquor than a beer. There is no shotgunning this, its an entirely different animal. If this is not kept in mind, the experience will be diminished.
pours a glowing mahogany that has no carbonation and therefore no head, but it has "fingers" that climb up the glass as it swirls, reminiscent of a fine scotch. 
maple syrup, raisins, dates, bourbon-based vanilla extract, molasses, cognac, port wine, brown sugar, caramel, and plenty of booze. I could sit hear and sniff this all night.
maple syrup, again, is most dominant, but raisins are a close second with a strong booze heat coming next with a lot of oak, bourbon, dark fruits, port wine, black molasses, black licorice, anisette. wow.
burning hot and very syrupy, with the aforementioned zero carbonation (by design) and a pleasant sweet heat after the swallow that keeps this one as a contemplative sipper.
I'm glad I picked up the bottle when I had the chance. I'll continue to sip it an ounce at a time and hope to spread it out over the course of 6 months to a year to see how it changes. I've already noticed a decrease in maple and an increase in licorice flavors over the month I've been sipping on it.

10 months later, and I was curious as to how this has held up, so I poured an ounce. tons of brown sugar and maple with less dark fruits. booze still present, as expected. 1,418 characterssilentjay, May 21, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52011 Version,
A: Pours brown with no head whatsoever.
S: Huge caramel and brown sugar characteristics. Super malty, like a barleywine on steriods.
T: More of the same as with the nose. Caramel and toffee candy, quite sweet, but never cloying. Booze becomes a factor, but it is integrated well and doesn't dominate ala liquor.
M: Full-bodied, no carbonation, very smooth even though the heat is apparent, I wouldn't classify it as hot.
O: Thoroughly unique, this is my second time having this and it's just as good. Expensive as all get out, but this is something every beer geek needs to try at least once. 611 charactersHalcyondays, May 21, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5My buddy Greg shared some of this gem with me this afternoon. I was very excited to see the bottle on his counter. We sat and stared at it for a good ten minutes before opening.
A - Crystal clear, ruby red, it almost sparkles in the light, it coats the glass like a good bourbon, no head as expected
S - Raisins, dark cherry, figs, prunes, sweet malt syrup, burnt brown sugar, light wood notes and some alcohol. 
T - Tart cherries, figs, raisins. At times it's so complexly sweet that it's almost savory. Some vanilla and woody notes pop up from time to time. There are several levels of flavor that develop as it opens up. I picked up some syrupy malt sweetness followed by waves of dark fruit and then back again. It tastes chewy at times, making my mouth water.
M - Medium in body with huge alcohol warmth
O - This is a very complex and enjoyable drink. It's tough to describe it as a beer. The experience is similar to sherry or port tasting. It's a very unique and palate challenging sipper. I get a lot of faded elements from the Tripel Bock of the mid 90's in this brew. From what I understand, this brew is the progressed and far more refined younger sibling.
At $170-$200 a bottle in my area this certainly is not a common brew. It'd be a stretch to even consider this a once-a-year treat. Certainly its a special occasion sipper. 1,345 characterstbrown4, May 16, 2011

S-a really powerful aroma of salted caramel, maple, and oak with possibly vanilla
T-comes in with a really sweet taste of dark caramel. its a really warm taste. there is also some sweet but dark berries and some oak as well. its a strong taste. it slowly transitions in to a long lasting taste of thick maple syrup. its a long lasting and complex experience.
M-well there's a lack of carbonation, as expected. its syrupy with a sting to it, as expected. 
O-its definitely tasty. each sip leaves you begging for more. i couldn't drink a whole glass of this though, not because of the alcohol but because of the sweetness. the ABV actually doesn't come in to play too much at all here. this just isn't something you'd drink if you want a good beer. this is more for a night recap when your favorite relatives are in town. this is definitely a must try for anyone though, whether you're a beer lover or not. 986 charactersAdamBear, May 14, 2011

And wow... This is some beer.
Appearance is a clear, dark amber. Also, there is no carbonation. It also appears thick, like a stretched syrup. 
Smell blows me away. Very heated with notes of port-wine, honey and bourbon.
Taste is intense. It wraps around your tongue like caramel and fills it with complex overtones of honey, berry, port, malted-sweetness and bourbon. There is a bit of vanilla and toffee to it as well. At the end, some amount of spice hits the tongue. The lingering tail is full of fruit and port.
Mouthfeel is full throughout, but at the end, it leaves on a light note without being too dry.
Overall, I'm blown away. I'm putting this baby on the shelf and saving it for special occasions. I feel like I'll buy another one next time around because they apparently keep getting better from what I've heard. That being said, I feel spoiled having started with this edition.

3.7/5  rDev -16.1%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Just bought a 2011 vintage. Waited for the glass and tonight is the night.
The beer barely looks like a beer. It's got the color of a beer, but there isn't a bubble to be found. Zero head and as many have mentioned, it looks like a cognac or a brandy. Having said that, there is an oiliness to it that looks nice in the glass.
It doesn't smell like a beer either. There is a buttery, malty, nutty scent, but again, this is hardly a beer. Believe it or not, you can 'smell' the heat from the alcohol. 
Surprisingly, the taste is actually pretty good. The taste buds pick up the same butteriness as the olfactories. It's got a malty, bready, cough syrupy taste to it. The alcohol doesn't really present itself until the finish.
Like a good beer, the mouthfeel is complex. While bracing yourself for the ridicupotent alcohol, it hits the palate with a gentle sweetness. The sweetness stays with you a while and then the heat from the alcohol shows up. In the back of the mouth, you can pick up notes of both sweetness and heat before the heat takes over in the swallow.
Overall, this is barely a beer. It's got some beer traits, but it really pushes the boundaries of a beer. It's more of a beer/spirit hybrid. For as strong as it is, it's reasonably mellow. There is only a slight burn deep in the finish, but I've had worse from other beers. Overall, this is surprisingly smooth and I'm glad I picked up a bottle. 1,417 charactersRickS95, May 07, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +12.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 Edition poured into a port glass. Nice copper color with no visible head. Heavy appearance in the glass. The smell at first is a lot of alcohol but that passes any you get a wonderful raisin molasses combination. Very reminiscent of a LBV port. Heavy smooth liqueur type mouth feel. Taste is difficult to describe. First thing I notice is an unusual prickly carbonation feel on the tongue. Then raisins, nuts, maybe some sherry. Finished with molasses, wine and wood. Some nice bitterness too. Nothing else like it so it's not really comparable. Overall outstanding. 571 charactersKbogac, May 07, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +7.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Fantastic! I don’t know if I could call this a beer, it is more of a dessert wine than anything else. The aroma is the best I have ever felt from a beer, or from any beverage for that matter. On the tongue, raisins, dried fruits and all kinds of other sweet flavours mix together to give ou a sugar overdose only to be perfectly balanced by an easy alcoholic touch from the 28% ABV. Glourious amber colour in the glass with a pleasant body for the palate. Did I mention the perfect aroma? 490 charactersPundarquartis, May 04, 2011

Appearance: Pours a deep ruby/copper with no head, no lacing. Nice legs slow to move. Syrup like consistency. 
Nose: Huge amount of sweet stuff. Brown sugar, molasses, dried fruits, charred oak. Notes of sherry, bourbon, and coffee. 
Alcohol is not intrusive on the nose. 
Taste: Bright sweetness. Like nothing ever to grace my palate. Maple sugar sweetness with apricot and fig. Minimal bourbon notes...as it lacks the spice, not a bad thing. Some vanilla and citrus come through on the back of the palate. 
Mouth: Very impressive. Honestly. It's syrupy, but not cloying. The high ABV doesn't push through too hard, and is actually very pleasant and easy drinking. 
Drink and overall: Glad I got to try it. Awesome product. Very unique idea, and I think they really have some thing great. I was very impressed with how non-spirit like it is. I'm a big bourbon guy, but the mouth is nothing of a distilled spirit. Fantastic. 1,035 charactersMarcatGSB, May 02, 2011

Pours a somewhat hazy dark chestnut brown with ruby edges, no head or lacing. Nose is very pungent, heavy whiskey barrel, tends toward a spirit for sure. Lots of roasted marshmellow, heavily sugared, and hot. Stinging and really hot in the mouth. Caramel, sugar, earthy, Spicy, "rooty" per Kevin. Peppermint and root beer! Lots of roasted marshmallow, some maple syrup. Sort of difficult despite all the complexities. 469 charactersJAXSON, Apr 19, 2011

The smell is sweet and boozy with hints of bourbon maple and vanilla. The flavor is very close the the aroma withe the sweet booziness up front followed by the bourbon and maple notes with a hint of vanilla. The mouthfeel is thick with low carbonation. Overall this beer was surpassingly drinkable for the abv but that is likely due to how sweet it is, which almost becomes cloying at times. Was nice to try but would likely never buy 493 charactersrowingbrewer, Apr 05, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bought a bottle on this in November of 2009. Opened it in January of 2010. I've been having a few sips out of it over the last year or so just to see if there is any changes taking place of over time. The major change I've noticed is that the smell of maple is much stronger now than it was when it was new. The flavor is also along the same lines. The maple is really coming through now, it's almost like I should put it on pancakes or something. For a beer that's over 20% abv it's very smooth. There isn't much of an alcohol burn. This beer is just all around very impressive. I don't know if I'll ever buy it again but I'm proud that I got some when I did. 660 charactersKnapp85, Apr 03, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4From 03/11/11 notes. Had on tap at Nigh of the Barrels up in Boston, MA. Got to try three 2 oz. samples of this one which I was very excited about.
a - Pours a mahogany brown color with light carbonation evident and almost no head at all.
s - Smells of oak, red wine, bourbon, fruit, and light sweet molasses. Smells really nice, like a nice wine.
t - Tastes of maple syrup, bourbon, oak, dark fruits, wine, and light alcohol. Maple syrup comes through a lot, mixing with some sweet fruit for a very enjoyable taste.
m - The body of Utopias is very thick and syrupy; felt just like maple syrup. Considering how high the ABV is there is very little alcohol showing and it was nice and smooth going down.
d - Overall Utopias is a very nice beer from Sam Adams. Given the high ABV and the mouthfeel it is certainly a sipper and certainly something best consumed in 2 oz. samples. I thought it had a great, complex smell and would definitely like to have it again. Don't think I would pay $180-200 for a bottle, but if given the chance would love another 2 oz. sample of this. 1,077 charactersmdfb79, Mar 17, 2011
1.53/5  rDev -65.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 1 |  overall: 1A friend of mine had 5 bottles of this, including a 2002 (does it age or is my friend wealthier than he is smart?), one of which we opened for my 30th. He told me it's very expensive but did not say how much. I felt a certian pressure to enjoy this and I pretended I did, but I did not.
Poured with no head and no lacing. It smelt like a forified wine and, in fact, that is what it is. This has no place being called a beer. The ABV should instantly say that it is not a beer and the taste confirms it. I'm not really a spirits man. I appreciate a gin and tonic and an occasional single malt but that's it.
The flavours that I got were a scotch-like peatiness with malt, caramel and what tasted like lager hops. This didn't really know what it was. It tasted to me like a cross between scotch, sweet dark rum, lager and pure alcohol. 
Maybe if this was called something else I would have been more receptive to the taste but to call it beer is sacrilege to me. Can you imagine calling something that was 20% wine? Wine makers and experts would label you an idiot. This should not be on this list imo, hence the very low marks. 1,126 charactershophopandaway, Feb 28, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Some friends of mine and I went together and bought a bottle of this last summer and saved it for a weekend when we could all get together and enjoy it. We even bought the recommended glassware from Sam Adams.
The pour was a rich, dark color with no head and no lacing.
When you smell this beer, you know this is a big one. Lots of power and lots of liquor, much like rum with some fruity notes to me.
I found it to be a rather hard drink, there was so much going on. It felt like port or a fortified wine in my mouth and the taste was rather like a really, really nice rum.
Would I buy another bottle if I had the chance, probably not, but not because it wasn't good. This is such a complex drink that to describe it as beer really doesn't do it any justice. I'm glad to have tried it and glad to be able to mark it off my bucket list and would encourage anyone who has the chance to do the same. 897 charactersEirerate, Feb 17, 2011

Comes out a clear amber-brown colour. There is no head or lacing, but it is supposed to be still so I can't fault the beer for that. I don't know how to judge appearance on this, it would be like judging appearing on congac... they all look basically the same to me. On the smell, alcohol first seems to be there, but then I get vanilla and strong caramel and maple. This reminds me a bit of the Remy Martin XO congac. Smooth mouthfeel, as you'd expect with no carbonation. A little bit boozy, but this was really delicious. Glad I got to try it. 650 characterskwjd, Feb 10, 2011

Pours just like a cognac, no head, dark reddish brown, lacing all over glass, thin yet syrupy, no crabonation. Smells of congac, stron alcohol, caramel, oak, vanilla notes, sweet and malty. Taste of Dark fruits, caramel, vanilla, and lots of maple syrup notes, cognac back into play. Dry finish with a heavy alcohol burn, very smooth and silky as it goes down which makes it more of a beer than a spirit to me. This is a very slow sipper. 4 ounces took me over an hour, but it was well worth it. Glad I saved this bottle, and still have another to save for many more years. Really is worth all of the hype (and the $150 a bottle!). 759 charactersekardz, Feb 09, 2011

These notes correspond to the 2009 version of the brew, which I enjoyed at the Fermentation Lounge (Tallahassee, Fl) which they opened in celebration of their second birthday.
A: Pours flat and crystal clear, boasting a deep mahogany color.
S: Bouquet is powerful, displaying notes of dark rum, figs, and maple syrup.
T: Flavor follows the nose's lead, loaded with figs and Caribbean rum. Being a fan of quality rums, I have to say that this competes with the best of them.
M: Velvety and smooth, with a slight sticky finish. Very enjoyable.
D: A truly original and breathtaking offering by Sam Adams. this competes with many of the top-shelf single-malts, bourbons, and rums I have encountered when it comes to complexity and flavor balance. Definitely worth a try if you are lucky enough to come across a bottle. 925 charactersAvagadro, Feb 01, 2011

A - Pours like a brady/cognac, light brown, no head.
S - A wonderful boozy sweetness that has mellowed these past 8 years. Burnt sugars, rich maple syrup, caramels. Very sweet, boozy, and decadent.
T - Much like the nose, smooth/complex booze, oak, burnt sugars, dark fruits, caramel, and some vinous hints in there as well. The age has really worked wonders for this, as the 27% is really no where to be found, if sipping.
M - Medium to full, rich and smooth, excellent sipper.
D - I made my small pour last an hour, so as to enjoy it as much as possible and let it warm in order to really appreciate it. Looking forward to trying out other years here and there in the future. Really, really, good. Recommend. 857 charactersSean9689, Jan 31, 2011

I have a bottle of 100% pure canadian maple syrup. poured some into a glass to compare. the sam adams is quite literally identical in the glass to the maple syrup but with a little extra. The Utopias really looks as though a few drops of blood were added to a glass of maple syrup, the red/rust sits almost suspended against the backdrop of golden maple syrup. like iodine rust color.
aroma is sweet boozy and seductive. Its all booze huge booze aroma followed by the most enticing smoky maple bacon aroma. I am visualizing making a pear flambe with this stuff. Definitely smelling bacon.
Getting some amazing taste experience. first thing i get is a hit of raspberry jam. It actually feels like sticky jam on the back of my tongue and it tates like raspberry. fantastical.
The hit of alcohol is pronounced making it a slow and methodical sipper. It leaves no boozy aftertaste and it is difficult not to rush for more. I am drinking this while reviewing as i do with most of my reviews and i am going to stop here and enjoy. 
cheers. 1,101 characterspaxkey, Jan 28, 2011

A - Clear mahagony brown with ruby highlites at the edges. No head, no bubbles, long legs. A little viscous looking.
S - Rich dark fruits, figs, caramel, huge maple syrup aroma. Obviously there is some booze but it is well balanced with the other sherry-like aromas. Vanilla and dark cherries are also detectable.
F/M - Full flavored sweet caramel and maple syrup comes across first. Then the dark fruits and slight solventy alcohol come around and lead to slightly hot finish, but that can be expected for such a high octane brew.
D - This is a sure sipper and is still a little hot. Rich, full, sweet and delicious, it is still quite enjoyable. I will definitely be on the lookout for the 2011 vintage this year. 879 charactersdomtronzero, Jan 08, 2011

A: Dark brown with no carbonation, head or lacing, however there were legs similar to wine/spirits. Reminds me of pouring hard liquor.
S: Very strong, the alcohol hits immediatley. This is followed by some dark fruit, caramel, and toffee. Once you get past the alcohol, smells very good. 
T: Slight burn/heat from the alcohol right away. Then the flavors start to emerge, some vanilla, oak, and caramel. Lots of dark fruit comes through as well. It finishes up with a taste of maple....interesting ending.
M/D: Has some heat to it as expected, but medium to full bodied. No carbonation as noted above. More drinkable than would be expected at 27%. Went right through my 2 oz. pour in no time and had another one right after. The glass that Sam Adams provides is a must for this. 
Overall, this is the best stuff that I have tried. I am going to have a hard time making my bottle last. It is a little pricey, it did cost $175 for the bottle, but well worth it. 1,064 charactersbloomlax33, Dec 23, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I was fortunate to obtain 1 bottle of the 2007 and two bottles of the 2009. I plan to cellar 1 bottle of the 2009 for a few years to see how a little age changes the characteristics of this beer.
Poured about 2 oz. of each vintage into the utopias glass. The appearance was a ruby caramel color, syrupy with no carbonation, very cognac like.
Aroma of sweet dark fruit with oak and I was surprised with the high abv, the alcohol did not dominate.
The heat of the alcohol warms you right up, then the sweetness of dark fruits, vanilla and caramel come thru. Reminds you of a very nice Tawney Port leaning towards a cognac.
Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium body no carbonation. Not surprising that the alcohol dominates a t 27%.
THis is definately at the extreme end of the beer family spectrum. Very nice desert drink, night cap or thawing out after coming in from the cold. This is a definate sipper and 2 oz goes a long way. THe 07 and 09 vintages are very close, I believe the 07 maybe a tad sweeter and the 09 a little stronger.
It is worth the expense to experience. 1,074 charactersdtivp, Dec 22, 2010

Smells like brandy matured sweet raisins, very vinous, Madeira.
The taste is also extremely vinous, sherry, port wine and Sauternes. 
Nearly no carbonation, a maximal body, soft, smooth, oily and alcoholic.

1.54/5  rDev -65.1%look: 2 | smell: 3 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 |  overall: 1I had one of the early vintages at my cousin's. He fought hard to get one of the firsts, and paid through the nose, which is the only reason he's hung onto the bottle. It poured nothing like beer, and smelled nothing like beer. Everyone who compared it to cognac is on to something, but don't disrespect good cognac either. It tasted like bad (like spoiled bad) maple syrup. As a chemical experiment, a "beer" with that high of an ABV, is impressive. But there is a reason why Sam Adams was the first in recent history to do it, and why many others aren't following his lead. If you get the chance to taste it (especially if you don't need to pay) give it a shot, it is unique. But be honest in your impression of it, don't fall victim to it's high price and fancy bottle.
it poured nothing like beer, the smell was somewhat inviting (though not like beer), it tasted bad, it burned in your mouth, and it's far to expensive to drink (that is assuming anyone would want to) 973 charactersbirdyone, Dec 04, 2010

A- placed in my shaky hand with much anticipation. No head as expected. Deep clear brown with a slight red glow. Nice looking stuff. 
S- wow that smells like cognac. Tons of boozy heat and sweet caramel and toffee. Booze soaked fruits. 
T- opens up with tons of booze soaked fruits, caramel, toffee. Hints of nuttiness with some toasted peanuts and cashsews. I keep coming back to the spirited nature of this brew.

D- well this is the ultimate fermented beer and it doesn't disappoint. I can't believe this is beer and I'm really happy I got to try it. So complex and interesting. Easily the best brew I've had from bbc. 810 charactersoglmcdgl, Nov 12, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52005 vintage generously shared by Chris- thanks! Pours a clear blood orange red with some lighter hues at the edges. As expected, this one is still. Smell is very boozey, some raisins and maple syrup and a hint of oak. Taste is very hot, dark fruits, mission fig, raisin, maple syrup, over-ripened peach. Mouthfeel is obviously liquor-like rather then beer. Slightly coating and sweet but the alcohol heat helps the finish. For a 27% beer, this is far better then what I expected and an excellent dessert drink (drinkability rating keeps this 1oz after dinner pour in mind). 574 charactersnkersten, Nov 06, 2010

The aroma is nuts with more of a liquor aroma with sweetness added. Even smells hot! Caramel, vanilla, and toffee with a taste of alcohol that is extremely unique. Oak notes as well. Really glad I was able to try this and would totally try this again in the future. A sipper for sure. Is this beer? You need to try it for yourself to determine. 404 characterskbutler1, Oct 25, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to the "Kings of Beer" Todd and Jon for sharing these. 2005 and 2009 vintages. I felt that the 2005 was a bit too oxidized for its own good, so the review and score are for the 2009.
Pours a completely still toffee color. The aroma is hot hot hot and is full of sweet caramel and toffee.
The flavor is also hot hot hot and is warming on the chest and throat. I feel like I could go snowmobiling in the Arctic with nothing but a snifter to protect my delicate human frame. Rich toffee flavor accompanies the burning alcohol. So damn tasty. 
The body is still and coats the mouth and throat like Nyquil. Overall this beer is insanely good in small doses. Probably not worth the price considering the type of spirits that $200 could buy, but the price shouldn't affect the score. 786 charactersalcstradamus, Oct 25, 2010

Color is a mahogany brown. No head on this one at all.
Aroma: Tons of booze. It stings the nostrils. Caramel, vanilla, oak, and sweetness. It has a ton of dried fruits. One of the best liquids I have smelt. So warming. So sweet. 
Taste: Wow. This is oaky and has hints of cedar. This burns so much. It has vanilla, caramel, and sweetness with a ton of heat. So much booze. It is very hot. The oak shows so much. It is awesome in its own way.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, but ever so warming. It is definitely hot, but in a good way. Full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. It ends really oaky and boozy, but I like it. Wow. Interesting.
Overall, this was a great beer to drink. It was very intense, but a fine sipper. Wow. It was delicious. Very drinkable for the high abv.
The 05 wasn't as sweet. I didn't like it as much. It was more toned down though. 889 charactersmothman, Oct 23, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I opened this bottle on the New Years Eve going into 2010. It had a great color to it. There really wasn't much head or carbonation at all to this beer. It smells like brandy with notes of vanilla, and very strong alcohol. It tasted very much like a brandy type beer with vanilla and caramel notes. Alcohol was very prominent. The mouthfeel was good it was a little dense and coated the mouth very good. Drinkability was surprisingly good. It wasnt harsh to where it made it difficult to drink but it definetly had a little burn to it. It was a great experience though. It definitely pushes the envelope on what has done before. I think it is a great beer and well worth the $150 that I paid for it. I will be looking forward to the next bottle of this that I purchase. TRY IT IF YOU GET THE CHANCE. 799 charactersJizackFH, Oct 18, 2010
4.01/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled from the 2009 batch that was provided to a bunch of us from TMoney2591 and sampled in his Utopias glass. Big thanks to him for sharing this hardly obtainable, highly sought after brew.
The appearance of this beer is a headless caramel color with ruby red twinges when held to the light. The aroma is like whiskey and a hell of a lot of it. There may have been nuts or caramel tones as well to the aroma, but the alcohol made it rather hard to detect. The taste however strongly resembled that of maple syrup, partially due to the beverages consistence and mostly to do with the maple flavor. There are some toffee and hazelnut notes as well along with fruit characteristics like cherry syrup. This is a very viscous brew, but it is as advertised and compliments the style quite well. It actually doesn't really burn at all for something of such high ABV, making it very drinkable for a sipping liquor. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to try this, it was truly an interesting beer! 991 charactersVdubb86, Oct 06, 2010

I'm curious to see if this beer was fortified. It is better to compare this to port as it has all of the properties of a fortified wine. Pours very thick, looks like brandy. The smell is very intense with all of the elements listed above plus dark plum and some blackberry. The taste is sweet and potent, like maple syrup with vodka. Overpowering but delicious. Worth having as a treat (or dessert). 555 characterssmcolw, Sep 26, 2010

This fine beverage was our last official beer of the night. Many thanks to BrewedAwakening for sharing this bottle with us.
The liquid is colored deep ruby. There is no head whatsoever. Lots and lots of film is left behind as I swirl the glass slightly. The nose is very complex. I can smell alcohol, oak, cognac, burnt wood. The taste is syrupy, and sherry-like with lots of fruits: prunes, dried apricots and other candied fruits. It's a little sweet, which works well. The finish is warm and has some crystal sugar sweetness. The coat is quite alcoholic, but also sweet and fruity. I was very afraid that Utopias wouldn't be very drinkable, but it truly is. The first sip will shock anyone (how can a beer taste like this!?), but after that, it goes down like any sipping hard alcohol of good quality. I actually went back for another pour! This drink is an exceptional invention--probably one of the best beers I've ever had, and unlike any beer I've come across. It is most definitely worth seeking out. 1,137 charactersToasterChef, Sep 24, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Amy and Michael for opening this at the latest meeting!
Poured into a sampler glass, roughly 1-1.5oz sample which you'll find is more than enough for this sipper, no carbonation as expected and it really doesn't need it, has some very good legs but not overly syrupy.
The smell does have some heat, but not nearly as much as I would have imagined, the aroma is mostly sweet with lots of dark fruit and some wood.
The initial taste is very smooth, the heat isn't evident at first but you'll notice it soon enough with a slight burn on the tongue and a warming sensation in the belly, but I've drank hard liquor that have been less strong yet burns more so this is quite good considering the strength, it is mostly sweet with lots of complexity, the woodiness isn't too dominant but just the right amount, quite oily and slick and coats your mouth with even the smallest sip.
Usually I don't do reviews with such a small sample size, but with this beer you really don't need a large amount, in fact, 1-2 ounces is the perfect pour for a beer of this type. 1,072 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Sep 09, 2010
4.14/5  rDev -6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Had the joy of trying this from a friend. 
This pours with an oily, syrupy consustency. The smell is of dried fruit; maybe dates, and I get a taste of figs that reminds me of the candied fruit in a fruitcake. A dominating taste of honey is in the finish.
The mouthfeel is heavy. Obviously this is a sipping beer. And while it is drinkable (in small amounts), I'd think it would be best to have a little after a nice meal.
Clearly the hype of Utopias makes this a fun beer to have reviewed. I'd try it again sometime to see if it matches up to now. 550 characterssocon67, Aug 30, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Intense port aroma with lots of figgy fruit notes, alcohol and sweetness. Interesting given that this has undergone no distillation.
Cloudy golden colour with no head. Oily and sticking to the glass. I don't know what I can expect of a beer at this gravity. 
Thick and sweet. The flavour is predominantly of dried figs with notes of banana, nuts, sugar, stonefruit and port. The alcohol is present but surprisingly well hidden. Really, really stunning.
Full bodied, thick and oily with no carbonation. Given that this is the aim, I have no problems with it and it works just like a spirit.
A delicious drop and something truly unique. Better than any of the other super high alcohol beers I've had. 702 charactersdgilks, Aug 28, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Random Friday night tasting at my house on Friday the 13th produced some strange offerings for quite a spontaneous night of sampling beer. This was my second time trying utopias so the shock and awe of having this was not a factor this time around. My first experience with this brew was on tap at the EBF earlier this year, this time the offering came via a 2009 bottle.
Freshly cracked open, it was carefully poured in 2oz samples among 5 of us. Utopias appears a clear dark amber color. No head as expected but it clings and coats the inside of the glass as it is swirled.
The nose of this brew is a sweet mixture like dark fruits almost like plums and raisins that have been candied and caramelized. However, after that initial hint of sweetness in the aroma, the sherry-like booze and alcohol opens up and is readily noticeable. Hints of plums, raisins, slight metallic twang, oakiness and some smoke character all blend together to compose the smell of this brew.
Utopias is full bodied, no carbonation and is absolutely riddled with unavoidable alcohol character that seemingly evaporates in the mouth. Caramel sweetness upfront gets dominated by an astringent burn of alcohol and a bitterness with flavors of oak and other woodsiness that numbs the tongue. Lingering flavors suggest chocolate and raisins. Even though it is seemingly sweet, it has a drying quality about it that makes the mouth salivate. The alcohol has quite a medicinal quality about it and is very warming all the way down your throat and into the stomach.
What this beer is, makes it very hard to evaluate and review. All things considered, it's drinkability is decent for a sipper in small samples. Everything else about it is just different due to the high abv. It is of great importance to mention that despite the high alcohol, it does have an array of flavors and depth unlike other beers I had that were high abv and all solvent alcohol taste. This is one of those beers that of course I would drink again if offered but not something I would buy due to the price.
A strange side note: during our tasting 1 of the individuals used a plastic EBF tasting cup while the rest used a small 4 oz sampler glass. Utopias served in a plastic cup smells significantly different than in the glass. I know it sounds strange but everyone at the table recognized this difference. In the glass it smelled more metallic and the alcohol was much more evident. Inside the plastic taster, the smell was more sweet and the alcohol was less pronounced without the previously mentioned metallic twang. 2,569 charactersstakem, Aug 15, 2010
3.9/5  rDev -11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5I had the 2009 version of this on two separate occasions, both times I had the same reaction. Twice it was served to me in a one ounce shot glass for a high price. Me and my friends who also ordered it slowly sipped on this masterpiece after enjoying a few easier to drink beers.
This beer is something else. The alcohol content really defines this for me. It is actually pretty rough to get down. At 27%, it's more like a liquor than a beer. The flavor was almost wine like. It was think, but not heavy. It also had a twang of sweetness to it. 
This is something to be savored. Definitely not to be drank regularly. I did find it hard to drink, despite that, it was excellent. 679 charactersNature777, Aug 05, 2010

4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 32 or 3 oz. pour @ Gingerman Norwalk, CT.
A: Translucent mahogany, no head, no lace. Tough to rate appearance because I would normally knock something for inactivity, but I know its supposed to look like this.
S: Initial waft is stinging alcohol which masks any complexities. Once I became accustomed to the burning alcohol the aroma really opened up. Vanilla, brown sugar, maple syrup, tobacco, and oak. Incredibly deep and rich. While initially I was put off by the big alcohol nose, eventually I could not keep my own nose out of the snifter. 
T/M: Judging from the nose I was preparing myself to be blasted with alcohol upon tasting Utopias, but I was wrong. Alcohol was surprisingly well masked, well as much as you can mask 27%, by layers of flavor. Lots of candied malt, vanilla and maple syrup, and oak. Alcohol is supportive of the big flavors, and remains in the background until the end of the sip which is warming in the back of the throat and the gut. 
Yea this is flat, but also viscous and smooth. Certainly not a beer in a traditional sense. Even though it drinks like sherry/cognac, theres something about the taste that reminds me of its beer roots. Might be the layers of malt, its also pretty nutty. 
Drinkability is good for what it is. This is the definition of a sipper in both flavor intensity and ABV. Quite pricey as well. Refined, smooth, and enjoyable. 1,384 characterszoolzoo, Jul 10, 2010

Very odd, this is flat and there's no head at all. But as a fellow BA pointed out it's more like a cognac, it's got mad legs. The color is very clear and amber and oaky very nice looking.
Wow, this tastes amazing, it's pretty sweet but it's not too crazy if you go into it thinking it's like a port or cognac. There's a very nice subtle maple syrup finish that is really nice. The alcohol certainly is present but I think this
Is a really cool "beer" and totally worth checking out if you can. 604 characterskingcrowing, Jul 02, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Several samples of this back on 2/19/10 during the Beer Advocate Night of the Barrels event. These were poured from 2009 Edition bottles. 
The pour looks mostly like a deep hazy brownish ruby color, with nary any head or lacing to speak of. Just a still surface that ominously stares back at you. Stiff heat shocks the nostrils at first but once they get acclimated, the flavor really starts to emerge. Notes of figs, cherries, molasses, vanilla, char, brown sugar, cocoa, and herbal tea. This is very rich, full, and complex in the nose. 
This continues over to the taste, which just seems to explode up front, including sticky tones of caramel, molasses, wet tobacco, dark currants, brown sugar, wood, vanilla, and char all combine to set the mouth on fire with flavor. There's just so much going on here. The mouthfeel is flat and slick in the mouth like liquor, with the appropriate heat element being present. Just an INTENSE alcohol burn on the finish of each sip. 
Right now, this was fantastic. Put a couple of years on this to mellow the booze out and this would be absolutely awesome. I'd imagine that the '07 is drinking pretty good right now. I may have to invest in a bottle of this down the line and see for myself. 1,232 charactersKegatron, Jun 30, 2010

2007 Vintage.
A- Pours a chocolate brown that is relatively clear when held up to the light. No carbonation what so ever. Leaves a little bit of residue on the side of the glass.
S- Wow this one put me back in my seat. Nose burning alcohol hits like a ton of bricks. Then as you keep inhaling, scents pop up everywhere. Big hints of caramel, molasses, chocolate. Also, just the smallest hint of sweetness in there as well. 
T- This is where the beer shines. If you only smelt the beer, and never got to taste it, you are doing an injustice. The heavy dose of alcohol is nowhere to be found. Rich caramel, brown sugar and chocolate. A nice sweet molasses and almost a butteriness. Bourbon comes to mind as well. Every sip makes me smile. For this beer to be as big as it is and hide the alcohol this well is impressive. 
M- Just coats the mouth with every sip I take. Along with the thickness, comes the heat from the alcohol which actually goes nicely. Smooth pretty much sums it up. 
D- I basically treated this as a fine alcohol that I sipped on for a few hours. Also because it was the only thing I was able to drink all night beer wise. I came in not knowing what to think but after having tried it I am thoroughly impressed. 1,429 charactersWisconsinality, Jun 24, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have only tried this beer once and quite honestly it may be the very best I have ever tried. The presentation was amazing. The growler is entirely metal. The color was an nice amber in color.The flavor profile was not at all overly sweet, but instead consisted of fine malt (from the use of Caramel, Vienna , Moravian and Bavarian smoked malts). This was combined with a balancing refined bitterness all in perfect harmony, while finishing with a satisfying dose of warming, but not burning alcohol. At 27% alcohol by volume, this deceptively strong beer is better compared to a premium Brandy or exquisite Sherry as opposed to any beer that I have every known. Even though this beer was aged in Scotch, Cognac and Port barrels, it did not have the overpowering raisin or maple character found in the Triple Bocks. Everything about the Utopias equated to balance and perfect harmony. Dropping $150 to $200 on 24 ounces of beer seems a bit ludicrous, but at a world record 27% ABV you have to be getting your money's worth. 1,024 charactersOttoman112579, Jun 11, 2010

WOW... 
The whole experience leaves you speechless.
From the bottle, to opening the bottle, to pouring shots of this reddish cognac, to smelling (terrible smell by the way), to having your first taste of this crazy monster of a beer. 
We poured the beer warm as instructed. 
The initial smell is not at all how it tastes.
The beer burns from the second it touches your lips. 
Utopias surprisingly has a good flavor, but as for drinking large amounts of this beer it would be unrealistic. 
Not only would you be broke but very drunken.
I am proud to say that I was privileged enough to have tasted this beer at least once in my lifetime. 
After all of us tasted this beer we popped open a 7 year old World Wide Stout (DFH) to top the night off. 
The world wide stout became flavorless after the Utopias, but much more drinkable. 848 charactersbeejayud, Jun 07, 2010

'09 release, first opened on Christmas.
A - Pours dark, clear brownish amber. No sign of carbonation, as expected.
S - Very sweet and complex nose. Maple, licorice, bourbon, oak, and honey come through the strongest. And of course, there's plenty of alcohol in there. Very enticing!
T - Spicy bourbon and oak notes dominate with sweet notes of maple syrup and honey smoothing things out. Some spicy notes of anise are present in the background, along with some port-like flavors. The alchohol burn is considerable. 
M - Thick and sticky with a whiskey-like burn that warms you up instantly. 
O - While it may be very different from what we would normally consider a beer, Utopia is really a fantastic creation. The complexity is overwhelming, and I'm sure it'll only get better with age. Worth every penny. 825 characterspwsoldier, Jun 05, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks Mom and Dad for this fantastic graduation present. 2009 Bottle #11603, 2 oz pour into Reidel Utopias Glass.
Appearance - Viscous ruby hued brown, zero carbonation, amazing legs when swirled. Difficult to rate as a beer, but I'm intrigued. 
Smell - Alcohol right up front, followed by some toffee, sweet maple, some dark fruit smells, raisin or something along those lines. Powerful and delicious smelling.
Taste/Mouthfeel - Taking a small amount and swirling it in my mouth, it is thick and warm. Alcohol tingle and burn precedes amazingly sweet maple syrup and caramel flavors. Vanilla and oaky notes linger long after each sip. No carbonation, but still very pleasant. 
Drinkability - As expected from a 27% ABV beer, it is not one that will go down like water, but is very pleasant. In my excitement I poured myself a glass as soon as I received this and shared with my family. It was so pleasant that I repeatedly poured samples the rest of the party and shared it all around. So, not drinkable as the common beer, but in its own sense a very drinkable indulgence. 
Overall, I was elated to receive this as a gift. I had stared at it for a long time, not wanting to part with the money. After the first taste I knew it was something I'd love to keep and let mellow, so I quickly searched out another bottle. Not as gimmicky as some may think, this is very enjoyable and highly recommended. 1,405 charactersHoops4life511, May 24, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Samuel Adams Utopias pours a dark ruby-to-copper, oily in the way of a good cognac when the brew falls alongside the glass. No carbonation, no crown, but who needs it? This one looks enough "king" as it is!
Smell: vividly apparent alcohol, strikingly similar to mead in that its got a deeply sweet syrup-like and -- to a fairly lesser extent -- honey quality to it. Toffee-like notes intermix with raisins and adds a roundness to it all.
Taste: A fluffy sweetness and enchanting hints of raisin along with plums in rum. Somewhat peppery with a medium-mild sourness, which comes in halfway the sweetness, however is standing strong, and the two come forth almost as parallel experiences! A small, small amount of acridity in the sense of tobacco can be detected towards the end.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, almost oily as it slowly chugs forth like an old Mark I-tank. As I've mentioned, no carbonation. But it's rendered superfluous here as the viscosity is so overwhelmingly qualitative.
Drinkability: Obviously not the easiest of brews to down, but who said one have to rush things in life? In small sips Utopias does wonders for the palate, almost. On a side note: once again, very, very similar to sweet mead. 1,225 charactersAsgeirr, May 20, 2010

Very complex and very delicious. Glad I got to try this one again. 360 charactersemmasdad, May 01, 2010
4.89/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Four of us split the bottle so ended up getting a fair quantity of this titan and boy was I happy about that. Pours a hazy amber, no head. The aroma is awesome after a minute or two to let it open up. It smells very sweet, like maple syrup with a vanilla quality to it. The taste surprised me because of a few things. Firstly, the heat is prevalent as would be expected but not as much as you would think. It is covered very well by the rich, sweetness. The second thing that surprised me was the lack of bite. I expected a much bigger bite but that is not to say I was disappointed, just pleased by in different ways. It had a silky, vanilla-oak finish that sticks with you quite a while after each drink. There is no carbonation whatsoever which was expected for an after-dinner type beer that is to be served at room temperature. In truth, even though it is brewed as a beer, it has much more in common with a nice cognac. Very drinkable to those who like a heavier drink, goes down easy and would probably sneak up on you if you kept drinking it all night. 1,060 charactersDusty278, Apr 22, 2010

A nice clear copper, no apparent carbonation or head. Clings like cough syrup to the glass, it's still hanging there after quite a while. 
Smell is complex, sweet caramel, toffee, honey and very boozy. Slight burn in the nose on a deep smell.
Taste is just like the smell, lots of deep sweetness, caramel, bourbon and honey with a lingering burn. It's dense and rich with a coating mouthfeel. Very smooth due to the lack of carbonation. Much more like a port than a beer and one I'd buy again if it sold for a reasonable price. 616 characterskirok1999, Apr 14, 2010

Caramel notes, some wood and cinnamon. Lots of alcohol. Some slight deep fruity flavors. Really not much bitterness. Very complex, tastes like a port.

4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Finally trying this beer. Liquid caramel colored wit no carbonation and resembling a tawny port. 
Caramel, toffee, oak, hints of bourbon and brandy, dried figs and plums, dates, nutty characters, alcohol hotness in the nostrils. Sweet nectar inducing aromas. Very nice. 
Tastes like it smells but with much more honey and it is quite hot. Very much like a good 50yr or older tawny port. Such big caramel and toffee flavors, good oak and bourbon really keeps things in perspective. Hugely complex. Light cocoa nib flavors, herbal tea, fig, date, quince paste. Thick, sticky and creamy a great beer but just way to expensive. 625 charactersmcallister, Apr 10, 2010
3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5I have had this "beer" twice. A nice 2 oz pour from a bottle of the 2005 vintage and more recently a 2009 vintage pour on tap at EBF.
While I fould the aged version more appealing overall, a bit smoother and easier going, I find this to be a difficult liquid to truly enjoy.
A-Deep, dark brownish copper. No head to speak of but, when swirled, it left thick viscous legs on the glass.
S-Alcohol burn, vanilla, oak, fig, plum, raisin all lying on top of a massively sweet caramel malt base.
T-Almost firey alcohol up front moderated (especially with the aged vintage) with notes cognac, vanilla, maple syrup, raisin, plum and fig. Caramel malt sweetness is less pronounced in the flavour profile.
M-Without question the best feature of this concoction. Liquid silk with an oh, so smooth, luscious viscosity. Maple syrup smooth.
D-I appreciate what SA has done here and find it to be VERY interesting but to actually sit and drink this...no. It is a novelty only. I will save my high ABV drinks and money for the likes of real liquors such as port, cognac, bourbon and Scotch. The aged version was certainly more palatable than the fresh version so maybe over time....I could see myself sitting down with a small snifter and enjoying it. For the price though....see my previous statement. 1,292 charactersDeuane, Apr 09, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5My GF gave me a bottle of the 2009 for my birthday. Just ordered the free Riedel glass that comes with it so I had to try it with my Riedel wine glasses... poor me!
First of all, it's only a beer technically. If someone had poured this for me and not told me what it was, I would have had no idea what it was. Beer? Whiskey? Congac?
The first thing that hit me was not the appearance but the smell. I smelled it in the bottle as soon as I opened it and it reminded me a lot of samiclaus with the smell of thick super sweet maltyness. It smelled amazing.
I poured it into the glass and it appeared a nice deep carmel color. It was a little bit more translucent (like a scotch) than I thought it would be but it was thicker than any scotch. Great legs and maybe one or two bubbles?
I gave it another smell and was hit with the alcohol this time. This covered up some of the sweet smell that i got initially from the bottle.
The first taste was alcohol. Then sweet, then a touch of bitterness and finished with a distinct sour taste. 
It is as sweet at samiclaus but with twice the alcohol which covers up the sweetness. The bitterness was very light with just a slight hint of wood and hops. The finish was distinctly sour which is why I only gave it a 4 for taste. I have had many sour beers but I felt like it was a little out of place here. My experience with sours have ussually been low ABV. Maybe I wasn't expecting it and it caught me off guard. It did however open up some other subtle tastes of vanilla and so forth. Also, I'm a huge fan of peaty scotches and IPAs and I do not like cognacs. The sour taste gave the beer a slight tangy taste at first which was nice and hinted at cognac.
In all, I have my own bottle and will have to try many more times and update this review. Next time I will know what I'm getting in to. 
in the end, I had a huge smile on my face and my brain was turning. Look forward to the next try. 1,937 charactersabsolutbc2001, Apr 01, 2010
4.29/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The hard part about reviewing this beer is that is not really beer. This is a science experiment by the Boston Beer Company and I salute them for it. How you can get 27% ABV from natural fermentation is absolutely beyond me. I'm sure some advanced techniques along with some mutant yeast strain and some prayer, but I digress.
When tasting this beer, don't think beer - think brandy or a fine scotch whiskey. It's got more in common with them than anything that ever came out of a keg. It is zero carbonation by design. Don't look for foam, there ain't gonna be any. Look at the deep rich color and the legs it leaves on the glass. It almost has a viscous quality as it clings and runs down. It's also served at cellar temps or even closer to room temp. Do not chill this.
The aroma is wonderful. There is a huge complex malt quality that blends dark fruit with the vanilla and spice qualities from wood aging. I'm not a big fan of wood aged beer, but with this, it is well done and very enticing. The alcohol cannot be ignored, especially at these warmer temps, but this only helps to really volatilize the intense aromas.
The flavor is not beer. Not even close. But, you can close your eyes and identify the beer-like qualities of the intense malt and dark fruit. The liquid is thick in your mouth and just completely coats your tongue. The body is humongous. The flavor is intense, sweet, alcoholic, and very complex. The combination of the malt and the wood aging has brought out some very high end brandy and whiskey like qualities. Sip slowly and savor.
This is a "beer" that is not for everybody. It is rare to find, hideously expensive to buy, and totally worth it to try if you ever get the chance. Remove your preconceived notions of it as beer. It's a marvel of brewing prowess and totally unique in what it is. I think the bottle, unopened, would keep for quite a few years and probably improve with age. I actually bought 2 bottles of the 2009 vintage and plan to keep the second one until at least the next release in 2011.

But this review is from the bottle:
It poured a dark caramel brown. NO carbonation
 It smelled like alcohol, bourbon, vanilla, mixed with some raisin. It tasted like a beer liquor- alcohol, bourbon, sweet vanilla, maple syrup, prunes, figs, malty and nutty. A true sipper after dinner warmer. Overall absolutely delicious. 453 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

I received this as a belated Valentine's Day present from my girlfriend. Aw! She really does love me!
Look: Deep dark redish brown in color. Gold and mahogany both pop out at you when swirled. Its pretty neat (or just the lighting). No head or lacing.
Smell: Maple Syrup, Oak, Vanilla, Alcohol, Port, Sherry. Its all in there and it is amazing.
Taste: Warming alcohol at first sip, then you get to taste everything you smell. Very complex in flavor, its really interesting.
Mouth/Drink: Smooth but hot mouthfeel, obvious with the alcohol as high as it is. 2oz each time if enough for me. Enjoyable if you're a scotch or liquor drinker in general. Lots to be discovered in each sip. 701 characterstravduke, Mar 25, 2010

D: If I was a cognac or port drinker, i would dig this for sure. However, I found myself wishing that I had a cold, carbonated, beer. I wouldn't have this again, however, you have to applaud the unique and daring lengths that Sam Adams has gone to with this one. 619 charactersrrski198, Mar 20, 2010

2009 Edition poured into a Portsmouth tulip.
A: Pours a deep mahogany with absolutely no head or lacing, to be expected at 27% and without carbonation. Beautiful colors show up as its swirled in the tulip.
S: Beautiful with plenty of alcohol right off the start. Behind this, there is a lot of wood, vanilla, molasses, dark sweet malt, dark cherries, maple, sherry, and port.
T: Loads of alcohol. After the first sip, I got used to the alcohol and found the treasure trove of beautiful flavors beneath. Lots of maple, sherry, port, wood, and vanilla. All beautifully combined into an absolutely soothing beverage.
M: Very hot and medium bodied. Not too much of a burn. Not too sweet; complex and even somewhat delicate.
D: Supremely drinkable. The 2-or-so-ounce pour that I got was enough to last me a long while, and I kept discovering new things with each small sip. Next time around, I think I'll definitely grab a bottle of this to hold onto for a while. 1,068 charactersThorpe429, Mar 03, 2010

2009 bottle. I was going to try to save this bottle for a while. I thought to myself, life is too short... enjoy it. I busted it open at the Hilton at KTG day with larsonstyle and Zapps.
A - No head no lacing, clear mahogany, Flat. Looks like bourbon. 
S - Toasted malts, oak, vanilla, dried fruit, nuts, alcohol, so much going on here. A symphony. 
T - Maple syrup, vanilla, alcohol, nuts, fruit, resin, Such a broad range of flavor yet each component is so focused and dead on. 
M - So rich, huge flavor, no carbonation. 
D - I'm so happy I bought this beer for $150. It truly is a once in a lifetime experience. I have never had beer like this and I will most likely never have one like this again. Worth every penny. I could sip on this one and enjoy a 2 oz pour for hours. 850 charactersDNICE555, Mar 02, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'd been watching for the emergence of this beer for while. it showed at a local store and I snagged a couple. Opened the first an a family event... my brothers are all serious scotch drinkers... Then shared with a few in my brew club.
First impressions... wow... is this really a beer?
We poured a dram (1 oz) into scotch snifters. Snifters are very similar to the glass Sam Adams commissioned from Reidel for this beer.
Room temperature. This is Not Carbonated. You can open it, drink a little, close it, save it, repeat...
(Note- the bottle has a twist off porcelain cap. Under that is a beer cap for first opening)
Color is a dark earthy brown or scotch ale
Nose is huge, almost overwhelming. Maple, Oaky. Maybe a hint of burnt. Reminded us of a port...
Taste starts with Fig and Burnt Caramel. Raisin Finish is undeniable. Flavors are real complex. Reminded us of Monks blood - then we broke out a Monks blood and discovered it was like water compared to the Utopias. Similar Fig overtones.
mouthfeel is thick. Like butter. Smooth and warm.
This is a sippin beer. After I poured, folks would sip it. set it aside. Drink something else. Come back to it. The taste really grew on me. 1,194 charactersbihartman, Feb 28, 2010

Beer is brown and hazy, no carbonation really, no head, no lacing. It looks about what I expected it to look like but on tap I was expecting more of an attempt at carbonation.
OK, the aroma is amazing. It smells like wood, alcohol, malts and liquor, like bourbon. It smells amazing.
Hmmm....taste....well to start the beer is medium to low bodied, there isn't any bitterness or carbonation to sour it out. Its sweet but not cloying at all, but it does finish really really dry and the alcohol is biting. It really is like sipping liquor not beer. Its plenty enjoyable but after four ounces I was ready to call it quits. I don't need anymore but I would try it again. Much better than the triple bock, overall a solid and impressive beer. 817 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 22, 2010
3.92/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Utopias really transcends what beer is. Unlike some other "beers" out there, this doesn't undergo any ice distillation or other techniques to increase the ABV unnaturally. It is 100% ninja made.
This beer in the right time and place is a great sipper. I'd schedule at least 30 minutes for a 2oz pour to do it right.
In this situation, Utopias is a complex son-of-a-bitch. Flavor pop up all over the place including vanilla, maple syrup, brown sugar, bourbon, sherry, caramel, and dark fruits. There are more in there but my brain can't handle that many sensations at once. I almost think of it as a cognac or sherry more than as a beer. Either way, it is interesting for sure. Also of note, when I've had it on cask before it wasn't carbonated. There was a touch of carbonation and decent head this time because it was served out of a quarter keg (yes, a fucking quarter keg of Utopias!!). Also, this is one boozy beer. The full 27% ABV isn't apparent but about 15% of it is and it is hot.     
In a different time and place it blends beautifully with Canadian Breakfast Stout. The coffee and chocolate from the CBS add a great sensation to the beer and also drop the ABV to a completely reasonable 20ish percent. 
In a third time and place it is the hardest yet most satisfying kegstand in the world. This beer is to be respected or it will kick your utopi-ass.     1,376 charactersdrseamus, Feb 21, 2010

A - Poured absolutely still, a deep amber hue, much like a cognac in a snifter. Very clear, no sediment or bubbles. Legs cling to the glass when swirled. 4.0
S - Lots of maple syrup, brandy, notes of port wine, and a hint of Bristol cream sherry. Very heavy in the alcohol department, but is expected from a 27% abv beer. 4.0
T - Huge maple flavor nearly dominates the entire experience. Through the booze, I gather hints of oak and a bit of vanilla and cocao in the finish. Very apparent alcoholic spice. 4.5
M - Very hot and smooth. Burns slightly going down. Again, no carbonation but not syrupy either. 4.0
D - Decent for the abv, but a bit hot for that amount of alcohol though. 3.5
Overall - I was slightly underwhelmed by this experience. It was no doubt a delicious beer but certainly not worth the list price of $150 IMO. Luckily, I had this at a tasting for $14/oz. Quite enough for me. 935 charactersDmanGTR, Feb 21, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52009 vintage served in a Riedel Utopias glass.
Pours a beautiful ruby brown with absolutely no head whatsoever, appropriate considering the lack of carbonation. The smell is heavy on the caramal, toffee, wood, and, unfortunately, a serious dose of alcohol (which pushes the rating down a ways for me). The taste...damn! I have never put anything in my mouth so delighfully powerful and complex! Heavy amounts of maple syrup permeate the mouth, along with tart cherry, cranberry, red grape, madeira, caramel, molasses, toffee, and a large bit of alcohol warmth, but here it serves as an enhancement, a manifestation of the complexity, than a hindrance. The body is relatively heavy, but it somehow stays just smooth enough to keep the weight from negatively impacting the proceedings. Frankly, in the face of the extremely high ABV, this brew holds up as incredubly drinkable...or, at least, incredibly sippable.
This brew is a must-try if for nothing else than the experience. There are flavors all over the place, all blending together with the alcohol to make the most unique thing that has ever been in my mouth...and possibly ever will be. 1,145 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 21, 2010

A: Beer is a semi-clear mahogany. No head, no lacing, no carbonation. I understand that this is an "extreme" beer, but reviewing to style, I can't give it a good score with no head or lacing grade. 
S: Nose is outstandingly potent. Booziness is over the top and then some. Caramel, brown sugar, a bit of nuttiness come in behind the scenes. 
T: Booziness makes me cringe a bit. To me, this is beer in its purest and strongest form. Comes out of my nose and is by far the hottest beer I've ever had. A bit of brown sugar is apparent as well as some caramel and toffee. Finish is hot as heck and lingers a bit, but no real flavor, just straight up booze. 
M: Full bodied, flat, really smooth, but also really average for the style. Finish is boozy and over the top and the hotness makes it hard to get down more than any other beer in this category. 
D: I'm glad I only had a 2oz. pour of this one. Can't and won't stand any more of this. I'm really glad to have had it though and taste what the commotion is all about. Not worth the investment in my opinion and might need a couple of years to tone down the alcohol and heat. 1,338 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 21, 2010

Pretty impressive offering from Sam Adams. Pours a rich bronze with shades of ruby and amber. No head.
Nose has cognac, whiskey, sherry, oak, vanilla, peppery alcohol, caramel, toffee, rum soaked fruits, caramelized pecans and dank maple.
Taste has brandy, bourbon, wood, sherry, vanilla, maple, spicy alcohol, rich candies and nutty malts. Quite sweet, yet superbly balanced and hugely complex.
Thick, creamy body . Great finish.

I was working at a store and my manager broke the neck off one of the 4 bottles we had on accident. The break was perfect. None of the beer spilled and it didn't get into the beer. I poured the remaining into a nalgene bottle and saved it until I got home for a more proper tasting. I like this beer because they are pushing the envelope and just the idea of what beer is and can be. No head at all completely no carbonation. Lots of molasses and caramelized sugars. Alcohol presence heavy, very very warming. It would make for a nice beer to enjoy during the heart of winter with good friends. 626 characterstippebrewcrew2, Feb 17, 2010

The beer is a red copper color displaying plenty of church windows. Aromas of cognac, figs, plums, and raisins tickle the nose. Tastes of raisin, brown sugar, and a glorious spiritlike alcohol character that is just delicious. The body is thick and smooth, even without carbonation the feel is delightful. High in alcohol, but scrumptious to have sitting in the mouth. This is a beer I would drink all the time if it were feasible. Outstanding beer, while some may have "beat" it in terms of ABV, they taste comparatively atrocious to this masterpiece. 653 charactersvacax, Feb 14, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Utopias is one of those beers that you really want to try based on its novelty of its alcohol percentage, but is very difficult to find. Even if you find it, you still have to fork over a lot of money. I found a bar in Santa Cruz which had this on the menu, and it being a fraction of the cost for a sample, I had to go for it. 1.5 ounces, on to the beer:
The ruby amber color, with hues of orange, red, and brown make this a pretty thing to look at. Even my brother who was with me wanted to examine the color! The color was only the begining though. Inhale that aroma! It is strong, so strong my borhter next to me could smell it. But it is a heavenly smell. It smelled like the best Belgian waffles with maple syrup I could imagine. Vanilla and grapes are present as well. There almost no heat to smell, which is hard to believe. 
Like the aroma, the taste is glorious. I would say its taste is even more complex. Maple syrup, grapes, and bourbon soaked wood are the most prevailent tastes. Raspberries, burnt sugar, and a little kick of alcohol add to the beergasm. It's not too sweet or boozy. Feels like fine liquor, and drinks like fine liquor. I could have had another dose if I wanted too. 
A masterpiece. Ok, I'm not so sure if I'd pay three figures for my own bottle, but for a small dose at a smaller price, do what I did and go for it! 1,351 charactersDoubleJ, Feb 07, 2010

Review is from a 2007 bottle.
A: The pour is flat (as I expected), and a lovely caramel/copper color with a nice reddish hue to it.
S: The nose really has some wonderful things going on. Rich caramel, maple, vanilla, and a slight chocolate aroma that I really did not expect. The only knock on it is that the alcohol can burn the nostrils a bit.
T: While the alcohol is still of course very present on the palate, it's much more manageable. The maple, vanilla, caramel, brandy, brown sugar, and chocolate flavors are intense and absolutely wonderful.
M: While the flatness really doesn't work with most beers, I find it to be quite nice with this one. The body is absurdly full and rich.
D: I was honestly expecting to not like this beer. Once I gave it a sniff and a taste, however, I became a believer in it. And should I have a couple hundred bucks to spare, I would pick up one of these. 997 characterswomencantsail, Feb 04, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5An awesome beer and a great experience to have for my 250th review, that culminates three years of BAdom and moves me up on the karmic plane of beer to disciple. Many thanks to thirdeye11 for the chance.
A- 4oz of ruby amber liquid into my Duvel glass. I was expecting a much thicker liquid, but no it's pretty thin, not much viscosity. Obviously no head or lacing (with no carbonation) but it's got some legs- thin trails going down the swirls of the glass.
S- Whoa careful where you whiff this beer- the smell is strong. For all the beers I've hated on for not having a strong enough smell this makes up for it all. My first impression is brandy. Then I smell brown sugar, dark cherries, dark sweet sweet orange, maple syrup, toffee. Incredibly complex. There is also tons of alcohol- burns off my nose hairs and stops me from just smelling it for the rest of the night.
T- In the taste there's more sweetness and fruit compared to the smell which had more liqueur, at least in my first sips. Maple syrup comes to the fore. Candied orange peel, tobacco, juicy vanilla bean pods, blueberries. I'm noticing the tobacco more and more, which gives it some Scotch notes. And like the smell the taste is incredibly complex.
M- Burn, obviously- it is 27%. I wish I could say that the alcohol is hidden but not really. The sweetness covers it up a bit but not to a great degree.
O- it's hard to rate this as a beer- more a liqueur. One of, if not the most complex beers I've ever had. Quite the special experience. 1,513 characterszdk9, Feb 01, 2010

Appearance - tawny, no carbonation and no head (as expected). When I swirl, the liquid sticks to the side of the glass. 
Smell - sweet. Not boozy - I'd expected it to smell and taste hot, but it smelled instead sweet - a bit chocolatey. A bit of raisins too.
Taste - Sweet. Less boozy-hot than many beers half its strength. Thick, complicated but balanced. A bit of vanilla, a bit of port, and maybe a bit of macadamia.
Mouthfeel - warming, sweet without being cloying. It's always what I'd imagined scotch or whiskey would be - not burning, complex, a bit like port, sweet. 
Drinkability - I'm going to try to pick up a bottle every other year. If it cost $50 and were always available, I'd always have some on hand. A couple ounces after dinner makes a wonderful nightcap. 
Big thanks to Bryan Brick at K&L for getting four bottles into their shop in Redwood City, California. 965 charactersmlaroche, Feb 01, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Great surprise Christmas present from my wife. 2009 vintage.
Served in a Utopias glass. Pours thick and syrupy, a slightly reddish copper, leaves some nice legs on the glass. No head or carbonation, as advertised.
Aroma is strong of alcohol and sweet brown sugar and maple syrup. Flavor is largely similar with some dark fruits showing through. Alcohol heat and spiciness come through in the middle and some faint hop flavors in the finish. Reminds me of a nice port wine.
Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. I guess I wouldn't call this drinkable because of the ABV (and cost), but I am wanting more.
My 100th review. Yay! 622 charactersmjaskula, Jan 30, 2010

This beer is truly extreme and epic
It poured a clear deep golden light amber color with no carbonation. 
Smells like a harsh hot liqour. Very intimidating for me.
BUT THE TASTEIS AMAZING!!!! It was so easy drinking and flavorful. It was a 2005 addition so the flavor and mouthfeel was totally different form the smell. I got dark raisins and pruns mainly. Very simple. But I wanted to drink the rest of whatever was left, but I couldn't... :(
so very glad I was able to try it. 588 charactershoplover82, Jan 26, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Not really a beer I'd ever considered trying to get, then happened to come across it this year (2009) the day it arrived in my area, so, what the heck... a couple ounces poured into and sipped out of a Sam Adams Utopias Riedel glass.
Not a difficult beer to review in and of itself, but challenging because many of its characteristics need be considered outside of the average 'beer.' I find myself wondering if that inflates my rating, but I'm not so concerned given the unique nature of the beer.
Appearance- No excessively attractive 'beer' qualities other than color. No head or lace, obviously, but the legs on it are quite nice, reminiscent of a high abv wine. Viscosity with lack of carbonation hints at the after-dinner quality more common in a port or maybe sherry. The color is the highlight for me, rather attractive at a deep caramelly brown with lots of red and amber highlights.
Nose - The aroma is rather heavy, laden with notes of sugar and overripe dark fruits (prune, raisin), with a strong undercurrent of bourbon. Some light vanilla and caramel, maybe even a hint of coconut, but all likely present from the bourbon influence. Perhaps something woody like a greenish oak in there. Overall nose is familiar to high abv well aged beers, but this one has a characteristic nostril-warming alcohol presence beyond most.
Taste - Flavor is really about what I expected, though not in a disappointing sense. Very nicely arranged, strong and full, but not heavy or out of balance. Kind of like rum-soaked raisins dipped in butterscotch, it really presents overripe fruit forward in a syrupy caramelly sweetness. Almost a raw cocoa going into the bourbon finish, followed by some fumes of bourbon (and all that goes with it - caramel, vanilla, toasted coconut, etc.) with only a mildly resonating alcohol. Leaves a sticky sweetness on the lips and a lingering kiss of vanilla in aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - For me, this is where this beer adds up. It is as I expected for the 27% alcohol, but with an even nicer balance of ability to enhance the flavor and experience without any detraction from it. Smooth in body, almost sticky and full like syrup. Alcohol sharpness cuts the feel and actually makes it much more palatable. 
Drinkability - I suppose if you had to factor in cost of consumption along with abv, this really isn't a very drinkable beer. Except that, in reality, it is - though certainly as it was intended to be consumed. In sipping, it's easy to enjoy, very similar again to a port or sherry, though in its own way, more complex and a little tastier. Smooth and balanced, it certainly is a great concoction worth the try. Looking forward to sipping this bottle over some time to come. 2,713 characterslightindarkness, Jan 26, 2010

A - Poured in my Utopias glass, appears a very deep copper with no head (no carbonation).
S - Dark fruits/raisins and alcohol. I'd be truly impressed if they managed to hide the 27% abv.
T - VERY SMOOTH. Alcohol is hidden nicely until the after taste. Just like the smell would imply, getting some dark fruits from this.
M - Above average for an American Strong Ale.
D - It's a sipper. Don't be stupid! For Jebus Christ sake, it's 27% abv! Don't drink a pint!!! 553 characterstburkhart, Jan 25, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have the rare opportunity to compare and contrast two vintages of Utopias (2007 & 2009). Thanks to my loving wife for understanding such an extravagant set of purchases! 
Appearance:
Poured ~1 oz servings into side by side Riedel Utopias glasses.
2007 - Amber gold, no carbonation, syrupy film coats the glass.
2009 - Similar characteristics but slightly darker amber in color.
Smell:
2007 - Warm maple syrup and butter, caramel, walnuts, oak, warm but not of alcohol. Very intense but mild and smooth.
2009 - Again, similar characteristics but has a slightly denser nose that is less sweet.
Taste:
2007 - How can this be even considered as anything but perfect? Nearly identical to the smell but so much more intense. The flavors are so well balanced between the sweet and savory while being both light and dense at the same time. The alcohol is obviously there as it warms down your throat but never do you actually taste "alcohol." My favorite part is the intense mental image of pancakes with whipped butter and real maple syrup and walnuts.
2009 - Absolute bliss as while they are both the "same" "beer," they are distinctly different and both incredible. The 2009, with it's darker complexion has a bit more oak but is somehow lighter on the tongue as there may be a detectable carbonation. The flavors are slightly less sweet but equally balanced in every way as the 2007.
Mouthfeel:
2007 - Sipped so slowly, trying to pull every hint of flavor out of this beautiful liquid, the body is creamy smooth and thick with a sticky coating last long in the mouth. The flavors lend to being light on the palate so while the flavors are strong they do not change over the course of the drink.
2009 - The same syrupy sweet consistency coats the mouth but with a hidden lightness from a nearly imperceptible carbonation.
Upon initial opening of the 2007 vintage (nearly 9 months ago), it had the same perception of possible carbonation but as it has waited in it's bottle, it has not lost any attractiveness.
Drinkability:
This it truly the most intense and enjoyable beer experience I have had. Both brews are equally enjoyable and I will refrain from picking a vintage to prefer as I honestly don't know. In either case, I cannot think of a beverage (of any type) that has had as much impact on me.
Comment:
I have to say that Utopias is well out of my day-to-day price range, even if I could find it (I will not disclose my seller as I don't want to cause a stampede). I was first let into the know of Utopias by a co-worker of mine who has to this day, not found a bottle of for himself. I almost feel bad... 2,617 charactersCRichardsMN, Jan 25, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52009 Vintage
Appearance: Poured a golden amber color with no head at all. You could tell it was thick and syrupy.
Smell: Had nice hints of maple, caramel and vanilla. Smelled very cognac like to me.
Taste: Wow. Again very cognac and bourbon like in its flavor. I could taste hints of maple syrup, vanilla and caramel which was present int the aroma as well. A bit raisin-y(is that a word) as well. 
Mouthfeel: syrup-y with no carbonation at all. 
Drinkability: I was truly shocked. I thought this beer was all hype but after trying it I change my mind. Not sure I'd pay $200 for it but it was great. 604 charactersBeerbuddha, Jan 22, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A beer like any other beer? The Temecula Valley Homebrewers Association was lucky enough to have a representative from Sam Adams come to our meeting last night a bring a bottle for sharing. Unfortunately I was the last person to get about 0.25oz of this delicious beer.
A. A dark brown with ruby highlights, very clear. No carbonation, no head
S. Bourbon, Alcohol, Vanilla, Chocolate all come though in this beer.
T. Wish I could have gotten a bigger taste, but when 40 people are attempting to sample from one bottle what do you expect! The first taste you can tell this beer has some high alcohol to it. This was the latest version and could perhaps mellow with aging. Lots of Bourbon notes with some underlying chocolate/vanilla tones. Very sweet
M. No carbonation gave the beer a heavier mouthfeel then if this same beer had been carbed. No astrigency, some fusels.
D. Wonderfully drinkable, wish I could have had an entire glass of this beer to really sip and enjoy. 976 charactersHoldensHomebrew, Jan 20, 2010

S - BOOZE, nuts, prunes and other dark fruits, burnt sugar. 
T - Yawzah. Sweet, alcoholic, harsh, dark fruits, nutty, crazy.
M - Pretty heavy mouth. No carb. Balance on this is hard to discern.
D - Poured 3 oz. Probably enough for now. Excited I have more. 382 characterssrandycarter, Jan 17, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ripped shots of this the other day at the bar. Thought it was ok, but definitely not worth it for the price. Poured a pale straw color with about three inches of white head. Smell was definitely of lemons with a metallic twinge. Looked weak in the shot glass. The first shot tasted a bit like rotten oranges. Ugh. Gross stuff. Luckily for the next two shots, we freshened this stuff up with some Kamchatka vodka ($10 for a handle, what a deal!). That made it a bit more tolerable, at least it got us drunk.
Just kidding.
I've wanted to try this stuff for a long time, and had basically decided that I would never get the chance. Damn it is tasty stuff, though. Maybe it's not exactly like a beer, but it definitely has beer-like characteristics. Many thanks to Josh, alleykatking, for a taste of this 2009 vintage.
Pours the color of maple syrup, deep copper brown-ish with no head. Has some legs on it too. Not especially beery, but with the bottle, this looks great. Smell was definitely robust, but a bit boozy for me. Raisin, syrup, vanilla, but good too. Taste is just exceptional. Little or no alcohol burn, tremendous vanilla, raisin, wood, figs, dark fruit, maple syrup, bourbon-y flavors, and a bit of malt in there too (reminds me that this is a beer). MF is a bit light, like a liquor, but smooth smooth smooth. Drinkability is exceptional considering the ABV. Definitely one of the best beers I've had, although not sure I could shell out the price for it.
Thanks again and many cheers to Josh for letting me sample this treat. 1,543 charactersLordAdmNelson, Jan 15, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Gonzoillini for bringing this over to our tasting.
2009 Vintage
It was about a 2oz. pour into a nicely shaped mini glass that seemed perfect for a beverage of the sort. It was a deep ruby burnt brown color with legs that stayed on the edges of the glass for longer than I had ever seen. Just by looking at I could tell this is unlike any beverage I have ever had.
It has a similar aroma profile to cognac or a nice scotch but much sweeter and with a more robust fullness to it. Not nearly as much alcohol in the nose as I would have expected, I've smelled other 10-15% ABV beers with more burn. It was quite nice and just so rich I couldn't wait to taste it.
It drank like a brown sugar, bourbon, cognac mixture but with such a full body behind it. It was suggested to me to look for a little soy sauce character. I searched and got just a little bit of it but not enough to have pulled it out on my own and what I did taste was more complimentary to the taste than detrimental. It is easily the most complex thing I've ever tasted and every place in your mouth picked up a different character. When it was left in my mouth long enough I got a little alcohol burning sensation on the top of my mouth but not as much as I would have expected. It was truly a wonderful drink.
It was so smooth I couldn't believe it. I'm really glad it is served flat as carbonation would have been distracting. The 2 oz. I had were the perfect size and any more would have been filling. I'm giving it such a high drinkability score as it is well over twice as drinkable as the cognacs and whiskeys I have had. I figured halfish the ABV should be about twice as drinkable. The full bodiedness of it masks the alcohol and makes for an enjoyable drink.
I really am glad I got to try this without shelling out $25-40 in a bar setting. I really loved it and was a great experience and may even look for my own bottles as funds allow just to be able to pull out on those special occasions. 1,984 charactersweatherdog, Jan 13, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Small ounce or so pour, courtesy of a local distributor rep.
Pours a bright golden amber with lovely long legs. Completely flat.
Aromas of golden raisins, maple, brown sugar that is somehow 'clean,' highly oxidized fleshy apples, butterscotch, alcohol, and God only knows what else. Smells a lot like a well-aged English old ale, intensified.
Smooth and rich on the palate, showing the same notes as the nose. Alcohol is warming but not hot or boozy, quite an accomplishment for a beer of this caliber. Certainly a sipper, in any case. An absolutely beautiful beer, one not to pass up if given the opportunity.
Not as un-beer-like as many BAs seem to think. Big and complex and certainly unique, but fits relatively well under the strong ale / old ale umbrella. 765 characterswnh, Jan 11, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5While at the Flying Saucer in Garland, Texas a friend and I ordered a 2oz. taster of the Samuel Utopias. They advertised the tasters for New Years Eve, however we tried it several days later. We wound up getting probably 4-5oz. in a snifter, which delighted the hell out of us. 
A. Dark, ruby color. Almost no carbonation at all. Syrupy, but not as much as I have seen in other beers other this style.
S. Because of the high alcohol content, you need to treat this as if it were bourbon or brandy. Keep your mouth slightly open as you sample the smell of the beer to really gather in more of the notes and avoid burning your nose hairs.
The smell to me was right off very buttery with lots of caramel. Very robust and complex, yet at the same time not totally overpowering.
T. Caramel and raisins. From here it turned to joyful bliss and nirvana.
M. A little syrupy, but not so much as to be a nuisance, just right. Almost immediately coated my tastes buds with a lasting and delicious finish.
D. Well, it is 27% ABV, and it is quite pricey. For a taster it cost us $25.00! However this a wonderful beer for anyone who has the funds and appreciation for what it is. This is one you have to try at least once. 1,214 charactersJamesC7625, Jan 09, 2010

T: Much like it smells. Many liquors from the barrels are evident. Big caramel maltiness some port, brandy, cognac. 
M: Still with a full body and light creaminess. 
D: surprisingly well for the ABV. Definitely a sipper. This was split amongst a small group. Definitely the way to go with this one. 527 charactersdrgonzo3705, Jan 09, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Review 300. 2009 vintage. This beer is difficult to pinpoint as it is not really like anything else I have had in the beer world. But with that said...here goes nothing. Poured 3oz glass.
A- Pours a clear deep copper amber color. This beer has no head which I expected. No lacing which once again I expected. Swirling it around in the glass I could see it coating the sides of the glass I used. 
S- This is a very complex beer to sniff. There are a lot of hot alcohol qualities in this beer. But under that there is a light hint of vanilla along with some oak. Sweet caramel malts are in here along with a slight soy smell. Bourbon hints here and there as well. 
T- Interesting beer to sip on. Overripe fruits tossed into a caramel sweetness is the first upfront flavor I get. This tended to go right into a bourbon style alcohol taste along with the hints of vanilla, some woody flavor, and a light sugary sweetness. Light burn throughout I thought. This is a monster of a beer which I am not sure if it could be actually called a beer. 
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is well...not really there at all...dead flat. Alcohol and a sugary sweetness is left on the palate and in the aftertaste. My lips had the same two things left on them after each sip. It's hard to say the beer was crisp or clean with the alcohol in it being so high. Dryed the mouth with each sip.
D- Nice drinkable beer at 3 to 4 ounces. Anything more than that and I think I would have a problem. This beer isn't made to be drank in huge amounts. Very interesting beer to say the least which I am glad I got to try. I don't think it was worth the price I payed (overall) but I went in on this with a couple of friends. Worth trying at least once in your beer drinking life. 1,751 charactersalleykatking, Jan 08, 2010
3.29/5  rDev -25.4%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3To be honest I was not too impressed with this beer. While I am a Samuel Adams fan, this beverage did not hit it with me. First off, its very expensive which is the biggest turn off. Second, it drinks closer to a tawny port or port wine, maybe sherry. In some cases it's not classified as beer because of it's fermenting methods, and ABV Levels. Good taste, very good for sipping on. Don't get me wrong, it tastes great, it just doesn't remind me of what a beer should be. Plus, it's not worth the money. 504 charactersStevenBilodeau, Jan 07, 2010

Pours deep tawny in color with no head. Get a nice sized sample because when you swirl it about half of it sticks to the sides of the glass. 
This is one of the best smelling beers i've encountered. It reminds me of a nice stack of pancakes with melted butter and hot maple syrup on top. Raisin, alcohol, and vanilla come out as well. I'm sure there is a lot more going on in here that I can't pick out.
The flavor is a little more bourbony to me, not quite as strong, showing the maple, brown sugar, and vanilla notes. No carbonation, it doesn't need it, and a just slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Very rich and complex, one bottle of this could be shared with about thirty people. 
This is a great beer that everyone should try if given the opportunity. If you find one, try to have a few friends go in on it with you and it'll be more fulfilling and won't bruise the old wallet quite as much. 907 charactersbrownbeer, Jan 07, 2010

The pour is quite excellent, a beautiful reddish brown color with immaculate legs. The snifter really shows this beer off.
The nose is rich, deep and complex. A blend of caramel, maple syrup, toffee dominate, but behind it, there's no mistaking the vanilla. The alcohol is quite dominant too, lending a spicy character. Mellow oxidation is noted, with a pleasant soy-like character. Fruity and vinous, this beer is like a blend of a liqueur and a port. 
The palate is pretty amazing. Rich and complex, all the flavors on the nose are replicated, with the vinous character being boosted. Vanilla, maple, caramel, toffee, dates are all noticeable, and the fruity vinous character is just outstanding. While sweet, this is far from cloying, with the noticeably high alcohol helping to cut through the sweetness. A little hot on the finish, but it's thoroughly appropriate for a beverage like this. As expected, the tannic character is low. The oxidation I picked up on the nose isn't as noticeable too. Big in body with non-existent carbonation, this beverage is remarkable. I'm glad I got a chance to revisit this beer, I'm definitely picking up a bottle at the next release, price be damned. This is just too unique to pass up on.

Boy, I'm grateful i work with the people i do. We brewed beer today and my co-worker brought out a bottle of this year's Utopia(2007)!
A: It looks gorgeous, a deep ruby red with no carbonation. Swirling the glass revealed gorgeous legs. 4.5/5
S: Caramel, toffee, maple syrup. I smell some grapes too. This is a very different beer (You can't stress that enough) - more reminiscent of the port i had on new years than any beer i had. 4/5

3.74/5  rDev -15.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5This is an ego-project for Jim Koch. He and his comrades really challenged contemporary beer. Many tasters would probably compare this to a cabinet liquor to be poured over ice, however when you label it beer your mind starts to search and eventually locate the characteristics of a brave brew.
The smell was by far the best part of the beer. It smells of smokey oak vanilla. The taste is foreign for beer. It is very sweet, and heavy. You immediately pick up on the caramel and finish with burning sensation, similar to that of whiskey. The flavor reminds me of my Aunt Ethel's Christmas rum ball cookies. They were not her best, but we ate them. This is not for a weak-palate. Do not be afraid to move around in your mouth. The syrupy texture sticks and resonates in your mouth to cause a true flavor explosion. My advice is to drink this beer as directed. Two ounces at a time, once a decade. 
I am sure many main stream beer drinkers would like take a shot of Utopias and chase it with Bud Light, or even drop a shot of this into a pint of Guiness, but please hold back the fratboy-horses and enjoy the complexity of this beer. 1,133 charactersdpg02633, Jan 02, 2010

2009 Vintage.
Pours a beautiful deep clear burgundy color sticking nicely to the side of the glass.
Scent of vanilla, sweet brandy, strong sugars, maple syrup, molasses, oak, burnt caramel, a hint of smoke, and a nice warming alcohol. Deep, rich, and complex, surprisingly balanced for being so fresh.
Taste of sugars, caramel, molasses, honey, maple syrup, vanilla, brandy, charred oak, and strong alcohol. Sweet and boozy, this is some very tasty stuff. The bitter alcohol and sweet sugary flavor blend together very well.
Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth, with a slick syrupy consistency. The strong alcohol content adds a powerful bite to the mouthfeel adding to the slick oiliness, the mouthfeel is simply sublime.
It is somewhat hard to rate a beer like this in terms of drinkability, but this stuff does go down pretty easy. 853 characterspaco1029384756, Jan 01, 2010

Appearance- Very nice light brown color. Almost a chestnut. No head at all. Not even a bubble. Very nice legs on the glass. 
Smell- Very pleasant. Like a port or a brandy. Some raisin, some vanilla. Plenty of maple syrup. Lots of alcohol fumes, which was unexpected. Leather.
Taste- Fascinating. Definitely the maple syrup, it's got a nice sweetness. Which is balanced by the booze. Hint of cherry and raisin. Touch of vanilla. 
Mouthfeel- Very pleasant. Carbonation would be misplaced. However, it's a little syrupy. 
Drinkability- Pretty good given the abv. I finished my pour faster than anticipated and certainly wanted more.
This isn't really a beer. It's incredibly hard to rate "within style" because I'm not sure there's really a style here. It's a wholly unique creation. It's almost like a maple syrup port liqueur. But not overly sweet. Glad for the opportunity. Probably wouldn't buy a bottle, but would be happy to have it again. 1,064 characterscallmescraps, Dec 30, 2009

3.76/5  rDev -14.7%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Lucky enough to procure a bottle of this 2009 vintage on christmas eve.
Poured into a snifter at room temperature (just couldn't wait for my "free" utopias glass). 2 or 3oz for starters. Pours a dead flat (as expected) ruby brown color with legs like a fine liquor.
Nose is loaded with sticky malt sweetness and some slight soy like twinge. Lots of booze in the nose, and some caramel.
Wow. Certainly an excellent beverage. Big sweet dark fruit notes like booze glazed plums, vanilla raisins, and a brandy like body and base. Really like a huge, colossal, monstrosity of an english barleywine. The booze profile is certainly high in this one, but when you think of it as what it really is, a liquor, its not bad at all. Malt sugar is apparent, but not overly cloying or anything. Even in this beer, you can taste that typical high abv sam adams tweak. The finish is not bitter at all, goes down pretty easily, and then a brandyish cognacey nip followed by nearly booze like alcohol burn sets in, but doesn't give that solid stomach flame you find in good booze. Basically a gimungous hunormous english barleywine.
Mouthfeel is pretty viscous, but certainly not overly so, about right for what it is...booze. No carbonation whatsoever, but that is intended so i can't really take any points away here for that.
Drinkability, well, its good...for booze. haha. Beerwise its fuckin terrible, but really, come on, this is beerbooze. And for booze, it drinks scarily easy, as it is low in abv.
Well, i dont know if i've said this or not yet, but this is BOOZE! Yeah, the base is beer, and its really cool, and its beer-like englishbarleybooze, and a fine beverage, but this is more of a malt liquor (I mean that literally, not in the steel reserve way). The closest beer this resembles is a fatass gigantic english barleywine. Certainly worth the experience, but given the option of spending $180 on this again, or buying a $180 bottle of fine scotch or other whiskey...i can't see purchasing this again. Definitely not upset with the purchase though, a tasty beverage that i would certainly drink again, and buy again if i could just buy a shooter of it or a snifter at the bar. There is really no way to accurately rate this as far as a numeric score, but i have to to post this, so i will...i guess..
Many have questioned whether or not this can be opened and enjoyed over time rather than all at once. I will see over time, because there is no damn way im drinking this bitch all tonight, but my first impression is that you could recap this and let it sit just like a bottle of booze. What gives me this impression? Oh i don't know, maybe the fact that this IS a bottle of booze! 2,685 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Dec 27, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This particular bottle is the 2009 batch, bottle number 437. Pours into the Sam Adams Utopias glass as a brownish/red or deep copper color. Swirl the glass gently and it sticks to the sides like a viscous, syrup; this stuff is THICK! There's no carbonation and no lacing. Smells of maple, cinnamon, whiskey, bourban, vanilla. Perhaps a slight hint of butter? (very, very faint, though.) The taste is, well...good gawd, is this really beer? I sip this and think I'm drinking a fine cognac, it doesn't taste like beer, it tastes like a cordial. Picking up nuances of vanilla, cinnamon, maple, massive amounts bourban, sherry, and whiskey. In fact, there's so many different layers of complexity that I can't even detect them all. There's a huge burning sensation in the throat for an extended period of time after the sip. The texture is amazingly velvety smooth on the tongue. This is more of a cognac than a beer and I'm blown away by this beer, it's so incredible, different, and pushes the envelope to such extreme measure that the line between liquor and beer has now been fogged. I'm fortunate to have gotten a bottle of this through a family connection, I hope to experience this again before I die! The big down side is because of the 50 barrel quantity, it's darn hard to find and when you do, who can really afford it? My father in law works for Sam Adams so I'm blessed. (Go ahead, punch me!!) 1,402 charactersjzeilinger, Dec 23, 2009

Paid $18 for a two ounce pour, which seems fair, judging by some other reviews.
A: Amber, thick, with legs like a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Golden on the edges, dark wood in the center: viscous yet refined looking.
S: Obviously tons of maple, citrus, walnut, pecan, amazing!
T: Maple, butter, milk chocolate, and oranges. Finish keeps going and going, a second burst of maple and walnut hits a few second after the beer leaves the mouth. Pleasant warming sensations abound. Not so hot as one might think!
M: Thick and oily. Weird for a beer, but as a cordial or whatever, very nice. Zero carbonation.
D: 27% abv, what do I say? Goes down easy for what it is. I'm just giving it an "average" (3.0) because there really is no precedent for a "beer" like this. As it is, it is very tasty and I am grateful to have tried it. 1,020 charactersGarthTaargus, Dec 16, 2009

A: Pours smooth, dark amber, similar to a scotch. No head or lacing.
S: Deepest smell I have ever gotten from a beer. Deep toffee and oak-like.
T: This is not a beer, its like a cognac on steroids or a great smooth scotch. Would stand up to the best cognac, even at the $150 price. Chocolate, toffee, perfect fit for a cigar.
M: Very smooth, but with a fairly strong alcohol-burn follow through.
D: Very easy to drink for a "cognac", but it doesnt take much to get toasted.
I've got 2 bottles for my bachelor party in January - looking forward to another great drink. 681 charactersJesstyr, Dec 15, 2009

Pours into the glass like syrup, a deep reddish-brown, obviously thick. No carbonation but I'll be damned if it doesn't leave legs on the glass like a fine wine. Lots of greasy ones. It smells of alcohol (makes it hard to smell, really), prunes, and honey. Tastes of molasses, maple syrup, prunes, honey, vanilla, and oranges with a peppery and strong warming alcohol finish. It has an oak-like aftertaste and long after the fact it tastes like sherry. Maybe it just takes me a while to identify that. The mouthfeel is syrupy but slippery, absolutely flat. It coats your tongue and seems to be settling in to stay like an unemployed in-law. I can't call it drinkable, really, but then again its not that you don't like it, its just that its very clear that a small amount is all you need or want in a session. Really unusual, really sweet, very complex, and very, very good. A fantastic experience, cheers to Jake for the opportunity! 1,017 charactersroblowther, Dec 13, 2009

Poured a dark amberish hue with no head that I saw. Almost had a cognac appearance to it with killer lacing. 
Smell was very strong. I was a few feet away and I could smell it as soon as he opened the bottle. Again strong cognac sents blended with port wine hints. Also some woody oak aromas up in the mix as well. Lots of different sents.
Taste was way to complex to be observing it after a few Life and Limbs. Again loads of alcohol burn. Bourbon and oak and loads of cognac like aspects to this strange brew
Sticky mouthfeel with alcohol burn.
Not my cup of tea at all but really glad I had the chance to try it. My hat is off to the people at Sam Adams for constructing such an innovative and unique brew 848 characterscleeze, Dec 13, 2009

Aroma is hot with an alcohol burn. Sweet and sticky with generous caramel and toffee. Nice bit of alcohol infused dark fruit. Woody earthy quality with noticeable oak notes. 
Taste is initially quite sweet. Many of the notes from the nose make an appearance. Bourbon soaked oak and dark fruit. Earthy with a generous alcohol burn. Finishes with a cognac like perfume quality that lingers.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and slightly sticky.
This is beyond beer in the traditional sense. Massive alcohol burn with a surprising amount of subtle earthy and and dark fruit character. Wonderful bourbon oak character. Rich toffee and caramel. A must try. 721 charactersBlakaeris, Dec 08, 2009

Has a nose like a very good tawny port. Sweet with molasses, oak, and vanilla. The nose is huge and complex, can enjoy it for hours.
The flavor a found to be mild in contrast to the overwhelming smell. Very smooth and supple, big vanilla and dark sweet fruit notes - Cherry, dates, and grapes along with rich cedar and oak along with some nuttiness. 
The mouthfeel is thick and very warm, leaving a nice scotch like burn as it goes down.
Excellent, great snifter drink especially on a cold night. Very much reminds me of great tawny port. If it wasn't so pricey and rare I would drink this semi regularly. 696 charactersbashiba, Dec 08, 2009

I can taste that there's a beer hidden in here. If you scaled back the sweetness and powerful woods, you'd have a nice strong ale. Souped up as it is, you get a powerful warmth of bourbon and oak, mellowing out to vanilla on the finish. 
Appearance is just like a cognac. The smell is out of this world with vanilla and bourbon. It singed my nose hairs a little with the strength.
Pick up a sixer and kick back with a pint! ;) 555 charactersrealmpel, Dec 07, 2009

No carbonation, and pure liqueur in appearance. Smell is strong. Wonderfull blend of bourbon, nice wood, and other whiskey notes. Complex as any nose can note. Taste has a mixed whiskey flavor thats smooth, strong, and slightly sweet. The strength is exeptional, but far more smooth than I ever expected. Feels like a fine Cognac in texture and density. Fine barrel wood types of Bourbon linger in the aftertaste with a slight sweet note of Brandy. This is one fine drink of some strong booze. My taste loves this, but its not for the faint of heart. 637 charactersAMo, Dec 06, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've now had the opportunity to try this behemoth two times and this second time it was the perfect opportunity to put together this review. Basically, if you didn't tell someone this was beer, they would never know. But they would know it was amazing. And it is.
The beer has no head and is a bright copper/amber color with perfect clarity. No lacing, no visible carbonation. Looks like an after dinner drink. (Scotch, bourbon, Amaretto with the thickness) Absolutely has legs when you swirl the snifter.
The aroma is really nice. Sweet, dark fruits and maple.. some vanilla as well. Of course, some alcohol, but in a nice warming way and not too hot.
Depth, complexity and balance. Can I leave it at that? What a joy to drink. I am so happy that it's as good as I remember tasting at last years EBF.. Drinks like a brandy. Vanilla, maple, slight wood, sweet, but not cloying. Even some honey.
Not sure there is any carbonation, perhaps a pin prick. Almost syrup like. Obviously a sipper. Smooth and slightly warming. Not too hot at all.
I find this wonderfully drinkable and am planning on getting a bottle.
A special treat. Hats off to the folks at Sam Adams for creating this gem. 1,190 charactersReagan1984, Dec 06, 2009

Super thanks to deliriumfest for helping me get this one!!!
This pours a translucent maple color with dark ruby highlights. There is no head and no lacing. However, it is quite viscous, oily even, and has legs for days. Just tilt the glass a little bit and watch the liquid slowly slide back down to the surface. You'll fall asleep before it all comes back down.
Beautiful.
Lots of maple syrup presence, along with a big nuttiness. Tons of oak coming through. Dark fruits, like figs, dates, raisins and cherries. Nice presence of honey and some traces of caramel. 
The alcohol presence is definitely unavoidable, though it is not as overpowering as I'd anticipated. It reminds me of somewhere between a scotch and a port.
The taste follows the nose in a wonderfully beautiful way. This is absolutely delicious. Huge notes of maple hit you first. This is followed by that massive oakiness. Then it all bursts open, into a flavor explosion in your mouth. Dates, figs, and tons of raisins. Lots of honey and vanilla. Light caramel and brown sugar notes. Hints of leather and tobacco. Very light traces of coffee and chocolates.
The sweetness level is like mixing a fine rum with maple syrup. It's absolutely decadent.
The high abv is actually much more toned down than anticipated. Oh, it will warm you up, alright. It's just not nearly as hot as I thought it would be.
The mouthfeel is beyond full-bodied. It's thick. It is totally viscous and oily. The liquid just coats the entire surface of your mouth and hangs around for several minutes after you swallow.
This is very drinkable, but it is definitely an 'occasion' drink. It is just way too rich and decadent to have on a regular basis. But on the occasion that it does get poured, it shall be enjoyed, thoroughly. 1,880 characterscoldmeat23, Dec 03, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Obtaining this beer can be quite an adventure. So I must give huge thanks to BeerFMAndy for doing the leg work on getting this one. 
Poured into a snifter the beer is crystal clear orange amber with red edges. No head no lace. However the legs this beer leaves with each swirl are ZZ Top worthy. It simply clings to the glass like its life depends on it. Slowly dripping down like syrupy tears. Absolutley beautiful.
The aroma is straight up bourbon. Wow this stuff is potent. It burns my nostrils with every whiff. Once you get past the booze you can find a array of dark fruit, caramel, roast nuts and smoked oakwood.
The flavor is ahuge suprise after getting through the nose. It's so smooth and flavorful. Sweet candied fruit, brown sugar, maple syrup, oak barrel, toasted nuts, toasted bread and slight bitter cherry in the finish. This is the most complex beer I've ever had the chance to enjoy. 
The body is pure velvet smoothness. Just like a fine scotch with less burn. Not a trace of carbonation.
Overall this was the most unique beer to ever touch my lips. I'm so glad Andy was able to score a bottle and split it with me. I look forward to sipping this beer on cold Wisconsin nights. Fantastic. 1,211 charactersbeerwolf77, Nov 29, 2009

A - Syrupy pour, redish, amberish, with yellow on the edges. No bubbles or head to speak of, sticks to the glass as it slides down the side.
S - Wow, it's like I'm getting a whiff of scotch in this. Alchohol smell is like that of a bourbon, scotch, or some other sort of whiskey. A lot of maple syrup smell in this, but the alcohol definately blows you away. Oaky with a vanilla hint.
T - Hard to believe this has as much alcohol in there as there is. The beauty in this beer is that you really can't taste it. Get a huge maple syrup taste, hint of vanilla, and some oak. It's sweet and good.
M - Syrupy and thick, coats the tongue and leaves the mouth sticky.
D - Given how much alcohol is in it, this is dangerously drinkable. Not something you can pound, but easier to drink than some "normal" beers I've had. 912 charactersAgentZero, Nov 28, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Reviewed at RnH, 1 oz pour into a short snifer glass.
Appearance: maple in color with no head and slightly viscous.
Smell: one word intense. Sweet maple syrup, caramel, toffee, malt, earthy amd definite alcohol with a hint of chocolate.
Taste: Opens with an intense sweet raisin with hints of caramel and toffee,and earthy oakiness. The alcohol burn in this is undeniable but contributes to the intense ages flavor profile of this brew. Almost like a fine cognac. The maple syrup in this subtle but is present. The aftertaste is warm, sweet and earthy.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied but packed with flavor, zero carbonation and smooth and coarse at the same time.
Drinkability: definitely a sipper but I would definitely have this again. I'm glad I tried it and I recommend others to try it as well. I recommend this for cognac lovers as well as those seeking an intense sweet earthy raisin profile with an alcohol nose and presence throughout. 944 characterscapra12, Nov 27, 2009

(A)- Pours a hazy mahogany amber with reddish & golden yellow highlights depending on how you look at it. No carbonation, but the alcohol "legs" are just clinging to every millimeter of the glass like a beautiful whiskey or port. 
(S)- Nutty, with sweet honey, toffee, butterscotch, and maple syrup. Bits of figs, raisins, and marashino cherries. Slightly earthy and rustic within the nuttiness. Very tawny port-like. Finishes with a light vanilla oakiness. 
(T)- Very rich. Sweet, with honey and nutty maple syrup. Some brown sugar with a smooth vanilla-oak finish. Some of that fig nuance inside the honey characteristic. I still taste it at least a minute + after each sip. So complex that I do not think I came even close to what is all in this beer! 
(M)- A warmth of alcohol, but in no way overpowering or harsh, in fact, it is surprisingly smooth! Yes, it has a whopping 27% abv, but it feels like much less than that. I am extremely surprised and impressed how easy this goes down actually. Incredible feel and silkiness behind the warmth. If this was carbonated, I think it would ruin what this has to offer! 
(D)- What a crazy beer. Ridiculous on all levels, but surprisingly smooth with no serious alcohol bite. One sip of this has more flavor & richness than a whole case of your typical beer. Definitely Definitely a sipper; only have an ounce or two at a time. This is far too special and good to consume mass amounts of it (which I could if I wanted to!) A great after dinner nightcap to warm the bones in the heart of winter! Be careful, this is a dangerous brew! I could sip this all night if I could. I would rate this even higher on the drinkability scale than I did, but this is just too special and unique to be something you have on a regular basis. 
So complex and tasty! So many nuances in this, In my opinion, my review does not completely do this beer justice! Another thank you to BeerFMAndy for letting me try this incredible & spectacular brew! 2,096 characterssweemzander, Nov 26, 2009
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A= poured from my fresh bottle of 2007 Utopias. Really there is nothing to compare this to so how can it be anything other than perfect. It's a beautiful brownish amber color with no head; but hey like I said is this how it's suppose to be???? Yes, yes it is. I can't dock points for it not having a head or lacing because I'm not sure if it's even possible. The color is great though.
S= Loads of sweet mapley awesomness. It smells like nothing I could have ever imagined. There is of course alcohol present but It's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The alcohol just tingles on the back of the nose I guess is the best way to explain it. Much like there are multiple places on the tongue when you sip there are multiple nose notes. Up front Maple then some actual recognizable malts come through. There is a lot of toffee and caramel goodness I even get a little chocolate and coffee deeper in there. Then I encounter tons of wood. Oak and vanilla take over my nose and then finish on the way down with an alcohol burn. Awesome.
T= Again completely unexpected. Of course this beer has a ton of alcohol in it but the taste is so much more. The path across my nose follows the smell very much in the same way. Up front there is TONS of maple in it. Sweet rich maple. One of the sweetest beers I've ever had. From the sweet maple goodness you sort of skip over all recognizable malt flavor because the maple hits you that deep. From there you get all the sweet wood flavor. A little bourbon (I'm not sure if bourbon barrels were used or not it may just be the alcohol) vanilla is all over my tongue. The finish is hot and boozy.
M= Burns my tongue. The most coating beer I've ever felt before. It just hit you penetrates all nooks and crannies in your tongue and sits. Even with the small sips I'm taking it covers the mouth. Hot and wild.
D= How can you rate this beer anything less than perfect... This is a beer that all other "extreme" beers will have to match up to. There is nothing to compare this too and is so far out there that I'm not sure if people will try to match this. Not only that but it's awesome. Not the best beer I've ever had but it's up there and for the "style" it's perfect. 2,209 charactersjjanega08, Nov 25, 2009

A: Deep amber, ruby. No carbonation.

T: Thick, syrupy, maple tones, and a large amount of alcohol warmth.
M: Chewy, syrupy, almost certainly different from any beer you've had before.
D: Definatly a sipper due to rich flavor, alcohol content, and price.
Overall a unique experience, a novelty. I'm glad I had the opportunity to taste it, but for $225 a bottle here in Rochester, I'd rather have an early 90's vintage Thomas Hardy's ale if I am looking for a similar experience. 643 charactersreustyMMX, Nov 24, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.52007 vintage. Thanks Torry. Consumed on 11/22/2009 in a snifter. The beer pours deep crimson and still. A swirl of the glass yields an amazing string of pearls. 
The aroma is stellar. The alcohol stings my nostrils when I plunge my nose in the snifter and maple wafts from the glass. I detect tobacco, vanilla, leather, and a distinct earthiness. The sweet vinous quality is reminiscent of a fine Port or Cognac. Wood and toffee are evident. Outstanding.
Wow. This has notes of a big English Barleywine with the strong toffee. Maple is evident. This is like a cross between a fine port and a cognac. I detect Tobacco, earthiness, a touch of caramel, leather, vanilla, plums, dates, and ripe grapes. The booze is strong, about 27% strong. There's a subtle sherry-like oxidation. The finish is sweet maple with brown sugar, vanilla, and a dark fruit finish.
The beer has a sticky, coating, and full mouthfeel, like a nice port wine. This concoction is amazingly complex. This is not far off from a fine Añejo, Port, or Cognac. It's rewarding sipper and unlike anything I've ever had. Considering the price tag, I couldn't see myself buying a bottle of this in the near future. 
Utopias was awesome to try and my second glass was delicious with a cigar, but $180 is simply insane. I'd love to give the drinkability a 5, but at some point the price must be factored in when it gets to such a level. If this were $40-$50 and readily available it would be a staple in my house. 1,476 charactersHopHead84, Nov 24, 2009

4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Are you KIDDING me? Poured from the bottle into a small brandy snifter.
Poured the color of Grade A maple syrup, although not quite as thick. Medium-bodied. Obviously, no head or carbonation to speak off. However, a little swirl of the glass produces a nice surprise - the liquid sticks to the sides of the glass and produces ridiculous legs. I have never seen anything quite like this in a beer.
Smell... wow. Maple, sweet port, wood notes, vanilla, and alcohol heat combine at the very start. After I dissect the brew for a while, I discover gingerbread, spiced rum cake, and fruitcake in the nose as well. Also, there's something about it that reminds me of the holiday season, but I can't put my finger on it... it's a sweet smell, kinda like cake icing... but I don't think that is completely accurate. Anyway, this smells AWESOME. 
Taste is similarly magnificent. Maple syrup is there in high quantity, but it also tastes of port, cognac, oak, and spice. The alcohol that was fairly obvious in the nose is largely absent from the taste - only by swirling this beer around in my mouth does the heat make itself known. The swallow also fills my throat and belly with a warm sensation. After a bit, I notice caramel, figs, and raisins in the the taste as well. Wow, this is awesome.
Mouthfeel is quite good. It's medium-bodied, and feels like liquor in your mouth. The finish is surprisingly clean. Given that this beer is SO unusual, I don't really know what to say about it. As my friends said, "This isn't beer." 
I find that ranking the drinkability of beer to be the most difficult thing to do in reviews. Maybe that's because it's so ill-defined. Anyway, you cannot drink this beer in large quantities. BUT, this goes down better than any 54-proof liquid should. I just drank about 6 ounces of the stuff, and I had to stop myself from drinking more. The drinkability on this one is quite good.
This beer is phenomenal. It is insane, and a drinking experience unlike any other I have experienced. This is almost certainly the most complex beer I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I am truly impressed with the boys at Boston Beer Co. Well done, sirs. Well done. Wow. 2,184 charactersdavod23, Nov 23, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 524 oz bottle. 2 oz poured into a Snifter at room temperature. 2009 bottle. 05385 numbered in gold on the bottom.
A - With no carbonation the Utopias pours with no head and only a few bubbles trapped within that escape to the edges of the glass. The color is a beautiful nutty brown amber and totally clear. When it's swirled in the glass it leaves legs in the glass that cling and drip so slow it's almost like liquid lacing.
S - A deep whiff of the fresh Utopias results in heavy nostril burn from the insane amount of alcohol in this but the first thing that comes to mind? Tawny port. The malts are readily available if you can push past the alcohol. Lots of sweet caramel and maple syrup with tons of fruity notes too. Raisin, white grape, and a tiny bit of mango too. An incredibly potent aroma not rivaled by any beer available.
T - The initial reaction to this beer is sheer surprise at the difference between the perception of what the flavor will be based on the nose and what it actually is. It's a sharp right hook to the mouth with a ton of malt followed by an uppercut of sweet maple syrup. When you're dizzy from the incredible amount of nuances in this beer, if you can call it beer, you'll be tko-ed by the alcohol. Not hot, burning, spicy, or solvent-like at all, you wouldn't even begin to guess it was 27%. 16, maybe 18 tops. The maple syrup flavor is sweet but not cloying, followed by raw honey and a sprinkle of nutty shavings with a good helping of raisin and a light spritz of white grape. A lot of molasses flavor comes through too without being too rich. The alcohol really is, surprisingly, and afterthought in the flavor!
M - Smooth and rich with no carbonation, it's a good feeling beer that warms up my insides without a burning sensation. Lingering aftertaste that just gets better too.
D - This beer is so drinkable it's scary. A perfect night-cap and sipper for the winter season. If someone gave me a snifter full of this without telling me a) the percent and b) what it was I would probably be much more drunk than I'd like. A great sipper that is a fantastic beer and totally surpasses the hype. 2,136 charactersBeerFMAndy, Nov 22, 2009

a - deep copper color, no head whatsoever, crystal clear, not surprisingly, big legs trail behind on the snifter sides after every swirl
s - caramel, maple syrup, vanilla extract and oak all make for a beautiful aroma mixed with the obvious heat, get a nice hint of citrus after it's been sitting in the snifter for awhile
t - caramel and maple syrup flavors make for a rather sweet taste up front, mid-palate has some citrus flavors mixed in with more maple syrup and some spice, finish is moderately sweet with a decent amount of caramel and toffee with more spice and a nice smooth oakiness, surprisingly devoid of harsh alcohol notes though the booze is definitely there, a whole lot more complex than I expected
m - full-bodied, coats the entire mouth very well, no carbonation, great deal of alcohol warming on the palate and in the throat
d - if there was ever a sipping beer, this is it, incredibly complex and an ideal choice for putting a few ounces in a snifter after a nice dinner, I wish I had a few more ounces to try and pick out the additional flavors that I know are there, I give this a good drinkability rating just because I want to keep sipping this all night long
I am pleasantly surprised by the complexity of this beer. I really hope I'm able to get another taste of this sometime soon. 1,457 charactersWeisGuy, Nov 22, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served from a copper 2009 Samuel Adams Utopias vessel into a mini-snifter (2oz. pour) at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD (11/18/09). I allowed it to warm for a bit to almost room temperature. 
A: Pours a tawny amber with golden edges lacking any sort of head and lace. Legs are left on the side of the glass with each sip or swirl with a rich syrupy texture.
S: A wonderful aroma of maple syrup, caramel, alcohol, dark fruits, and malt all wrapped in a complex bourbon blanket. 
T: Taste is very similar to the smell as the palate is hit with maple syrup, alcohol, caramel, malt, and dark fruit again wrapped in bourbon. Extremely complex and unique with the alcohol never really reaching an obtrusive level. As this beer warms, one is able to pull even more nuances out. 
M: Pure velvet with zero carbonation and a thick syrupy mouthfeel. The alcohol (27% abv.) is certainly present, but it is seemly used in place of carbonation to cleanse the palate.
D: Surprisingly this beer is far more drinkable than I would have ever imagined. Certainly a sipper, but one that never completely oversteps its bounds into a liquory mess. However, a couple ounces is enough for me.
Overall this was a very worthwhile experience and one that all should enjoy at least once. Highly Recommended. 1,284 charactersLunch, Nov 19, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was an exceptional experience. Was able to try it at a tasting event at Table & Vine in West Springfield, MA. There is no real effervescence at all to it. The taste is along the lines of a bourbon, with hints of maple syrup. For the high alcohol content it was incredibly smooth, with an almost velvety mouthfeel to it--very easy to sip on slowly. All and all, a bit difficult to describe, but a great experience to say the least. 435 charactersPJLukasik, Nov 18, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5this beer pours a beautiful brown color with golden red highlights. no head or effervescence to speak. the aroma screams of roasty dark malt, dark fruit, and a bit of hops hiding in the alcohol. the taste is great with the dark fruit, the aging in the casks really paid off some really tasty sweet wood notes. the biterness and the alcohol bite and low carbonation make this a really amazing barleywine. damn near a whiskey. thanks for the beer weswes. 452 charactersalmychristopher, Nov 18, 2009

The aroma is awesome!! It has a killer warmth to it as well as a damn complex array of dark fruits and burnt toffee. The taste is perfect. It has an extremely complex mix of malt character and alcohol esters. The wood aging really adds a nice vanilla character that rounds out the flavor. The mouthfeel is perfect as well. It is a full bodied beer with no carbonation. This is an exceptional beer that's in a class of it's own. 534 charactersWesWes, Nov 18, 2009
4.51/5  rDev +2.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 edition. Purchased and divided in cost by a group of BAs. Thanks to largadeer for setting it up. 
A: Pours a clear tawny gold color with slight reddish tint in the glass. A beautiful color. No head, of course. Thick legs that, after swirling, look like the glass has a seam in it. Wow. 
S: Smells just like a liqueur. Anise, caramel, oak, booze, coconut, orange, and maple. 
T: Tasty, tasty, tasty. Syrupy grape-like character; I liken it to brandy but I can see a port comparison. Tobacco, light leather, caramel, toffee, vanilla, coconut, anise, maple, dates. Slight tannins and a hint of spice in the finish. The finish is an orange syrup that reminds me of a fine liqueur and specifically of a dessert wine whose name I can no longer remember. It's warm, but not hot; it's much smoother than the smell led me to believe. Very much like a well-layered port or brandy. 
M: Malty, rolling finish that comes in waves. Just a slight warmth, as noted above. Coats the mouth. Full-bodied to say the least. No carbonation of course. 
D: I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I expected it to be some ridiculous booze-bomb, so I flatly turned down the invitation to share in splitting this up. I'm glad I was talked into it afterward; this was truly worth the experience. I can see myself buying one in the future as a self-gift, if I can swing something slightly better than the $200 / bottle price. 1,409 charactersArbitrator, Nov 17, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 bottle, 1 oz poured into a snifter. The beer is still in the glass, tawny in color with amber edges. It's beautifully clear, and swirling produces the most syrupy legs I've ever seen on a beer.
The aroma is huge and intoxicating, with an alcohol presence that's more like bourbon than beer. Behind the alcohol there's a huge backbone of malt and maple syrup. Barrel-aging is evident in the form of vanilla and spice, and there's an underlying fruitiness that makes me think of port wine.
While the aroma could fool you into thinking that you had a glass of brandy or port, the taste is surprisingly barleywine-like, albeit bigger and stronger. Alcohol is once again very noticeable up-front, but it's not particularly harsh. Flavors of caramel, vanilla, maple and dates are most prominent, and beneath that I get a light spiciness, port-like fruitiness and a touch of citrus. The body is incredibly full and syrupy, but surprisingly, it doesn't become too cloying; the alcohol seems to cleanse the palate between sips. The finish is fairly mellow for a beer of this strength, with a hint of oak and a kick of alcohol lending some dryness to an otherwise sweet aftertaste.
Drinkability is surprisingly high, and if not for the potency I'd be happy sipping on this for quite a while. This is a great beer, pretty much one of a kind at this point and more than just a gimmick, it's genuinely enjoyable. 1,407 characterslargadeer, Nov 17, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3The 2009 release pours from the bottle, rich dark walnut, syrup with ruby highlights, and becomes more chestnut with each sip. Totally without any head or carbonation. However, each swirl puts up amazing viscous legs, which continue to dance for a good long while.
The aroma reached out form the snifter glass from at least ten feet away, with a strong bourbon or cognac. The alcohol fumes are powerful, just as expected. Underneath this are cinnamon, nutmeg, fresh ground pepper, ginger, dark dried fruits, truly a wonderland for the olfactory. There is little progression, as it is served relatively warm, but noting is lacking here.
Once the initial burn of alcohol leaves, each sweet sip reveals more complexity and layers. Maple/bourbon turns to raisins and figs. Molasses turns to vanilla with a particular nuttiness. Comparisons with distilled spirits weave throughout. There may even be a fair comparison to a fine Chianti. The finish is more hot spirits, but lacking the typical beer experience. I admit to licking $1 worth, from the wall of the glass!
Rich and smooth, with the texture of syrup, no carbonation, but the alcohol cleanses the palate rather well. One of the better full bodied beers, this is highly satisfying.
Utopias should be reserved for a life altering celebration or an occasion where it is the focus. While this is an amazing beer, it has few of the standard qualities of beer. One or two ounces at a time is plenty. So, amazing as it is, I find it difficult to say this is especially drinkable. I hope to have another someday, and certainly expect to enjoy it just as much. As for cellaring, I wonder how much it can progress beyond its current state. Oh, and it floods back Autumn memories, sitting on the porch with Grandpa, his cigar, and evening drink. 1,792 charactersSLeffler27, Nov 16, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.509 Vintage
Appearance: Straight from the beauty of a bottle into a snifter it had a translucent copper honey hue with touches of red highlights. There was absolutely no head, not even a fizz as expected from this viscous brew. It did however have legs for days like a thin layer of glue down the side of my glass. Looks akin to a fine cognac than a beer.
Smell: The aroma is worth its weight in gold alone. It assults your nostrils with a sting up front with the fumes from this weighty abv and as it burns its way through it gives you a bouquet of perplexities to make up for such a brutal assault. The balances of just the scent are worthy of a review and are a great precursor to this one. A thick dense dry wood starts off with a bit of vanilla creaminess. There is a light velvet of cinnamon and cedar to give it just the right touch of spice. The oak aged malt really swines through as the underlying backbone scent.
Taste: Opens for business like its it's job. Palate quenching and drenching flavors abound and somehow the diesel fuel fumes arent present at all that were hinted at from the nose. There are copious amounts of vanilla, hazelnut, burnt/roasted malt, dark fruits such as figs and dark cherries, silky chocolate and riddled with a good amount of butterscotch. The malt takes a backseat to a hammock of maple that encompasses all of the nuances in this entirely.
Mouthfeel: Really is liquid velvet as if it were a thing, coats the mouth like oil and had a subtley sweet after taste that you really never want to leave.
Drinkability: If money were no object this would be a staple in my collection. Loses a .5 of a point because the abv is ridiculous but it is still insanely drinkable but obviously among others and with a celebration at hand. Comparing this to beer is just ridiculous but when compared to brandy/sherry/a fine cognac it ranks right up there with how smooth it goes down.
Overall: Its delectable and when you drink it you understand the price because this is the definition of finely crafted beer (if you can even call it that) but truly is an artfully developed masterpiece by Jim. Perfect showcase of my venture into the beer world as this is my 100th review; i've come along way from being a beer noob to knowing/respecting the likes of this one. 2,291 characterscraftaholic, Nov 14, 2009
4.24/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 Vintage:
I had a bit of a hard time rating this one because I really feel that it isn't beer. By no means does that mean it is bad (it's actually quite good), but it does mean that it's somewhat difficult to apply "beer" rating procedures to it.
Had a small glass of this at the Tap and Mallet tonight (1-2 oz). I've been wanting to try it for several years now and am excited that I finally have. Served in a brandy snifter. 
A: Pours a dark reddish-brown, no carbonation or head. No lacing, but lots of legs down the sides of the glass like wine.
S: Sherry immediately came to mind. Also cinnamon, maple syrup, and some subtle chocolate. All these aromas are also mixed in with a very strong alcohol - like whiskey. Really impressive nose.
T: Despite the very strong alcohol nose, this doesn't burn at all. It's very sweet like an after-dinner liqueur. Hints of maple syrup, sherry, dark, sweet fruits (plums, dark cherry), oak, and of course alcohol. Very little resemblance to beer. 
M: Very thick and syrupy, a bit like a schnapps. Lots of warming in the throat and chest. It is pretty boozy, you don't want to keep it in your mouth for too long.
O: Obviously a sipper. It gets a little too sweet after drinking a few ounces - but a few ounces will go a long way. This was very good and I'm glad I had the experience, but at $14/ounce or $150+/bottle, I really don't think it's worth it. As I mentioned above, this really isn't beer either. I definitely wouldn't think it was beer if someone just served it to me without telling me what it is. You can probably get some nice liqueurs for $30-40/bottle that achieve basically the same thing that this does. 1,672 charactersMrDanno96, Nov 12, 2009

A= Poured a flat looking murky brown with some reddish highlights around the edges. No carbonation or head at all. 
S= Really, really, really intensely alcoholic but that is to be expected in a 54 proof beer I guess. I actuall thought this smelled like whisky (not necessarily a bad thing). There were also some hints of vanilla, leather, and oak in there too.
T= I found the taste to be the high point of this beer. Though its all hot alcohol in the nose, the taste was surprisingly smooth and didn't burn at all. Some big complex flavors of caramel/toffee malt, vanilla, and oak. 
MF= Not as thick as I imagined it would be. Just sort of heavy medium in body, with a really incredible warming finish. Totally warmed my chest and belly!
D= Obviously a sipper, but I sort of understand the price better now. This is a beer that drinks like whisky, so the bottle will last a long time if you have an occasional "shot". Could be nursed for months! 1,096 charactersspointon, Nov 12, 2009

S: There are layers and layers in the nose. Sugary caramel malt at first. Some vanilla and oak are strong. Lots of dark fruits of raisins, plums, dates. A dry almond aroma. Plenty of alcohol. This is really complex and amazing.
T: Sweet sugary malt. Caramel and toffee. Dark fruits that follow the nose. Dry wood. I can tell that some subtleties are a bit overpowered by the huge alcohol presence.  Though still, very Sherry like, and absolutely a treat. 
M/D: Thick, sticky, and syrupy. As expected pretty much no carbonation, but overall really decadent.  An absolute treat to drink.
I don't really know how to review this beer. It is what it is. An intense aroma and flavor profile. Obviously meant to be an after dinner drink. I love Port  and Sherry wine, and this is very similar. I really enjoy this, and worth a purchase if you can get a few friends to go in with you (like I did). If you have the means and opportunity, pick it up because it is like few others. 1,046 characterschamp103, Nov 08, 2009

Smells amazing - not like beer at all, but rather like port or sherry or some other similarly delicious alcoholic beverage. Smell stings your nostrils in a good way with caramel, vanilla, oak, and alcoholic heat. Taste follows the smell - and leaves that same bite in the back of your throat as would brandy or sherry. Extremely sweet. Body is very thick and there's no carbonation whatsoever. Overall, a very delicious beverage, but I would not spend $150 on a bottle. 581 characterswaltonc, Nov 06, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52009 vintage sampled at the 2009 GABF.
Portions of this batch were aged in Buffalo Trace barrels and finished in muscatel and port casks. Some SA Triple Bock has been blended in. It clocks in at a record-setting 27%, making it the strongest commercially available "beer".
The pour leaves a copper colored, viscous liquid with no carbonation. The aroma shows notes of maple syrup, vanilla and dark stone fruit. The flavor is similar, but more complex. Maple syrup, vanilla, caramel, plums, prunes, raisins, oak and notes of sherry and brandy. The body is very rich and syrupy. 
Say what you will about the price tag, this is an excellent beverage. I think calling something so high in alcohol that it forces CO2 out of solution a beer is a bit of a stretch. Though it may technically be a beer, it drinks like port and that is how it should be viewed. In any case, I enjoyed it and if you're buyin, I'll have another! 919 charactersBradLikesBrew, Oct 19, 2009

The taste is very strong with a big taste of alcohol and vanilla.
Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and lasts for several seconds. It coats your throat like robutussim. Flavor comes back up on the back end tingling your throat.

A: Pours a nice copper and completely still -- flat. Really not much can be said about this. It is gold, copper and great looking.
S: Wow. Is this a beer? A brandy? A whiskey? Not sure, but it is a delicious beverage. Smell is abundant with creamy vanilla, deep, robust caramel and toffee. The alcohol is apparent, but it is that of a fine brandy, not astringent alcohol.
T: Wow, this is really special. It really tastes like a fine brandy or liquor, not necessarily a beer. Strong. I could only have 2oz, but the flavors are so robust with vanilla, caramel, alcohol, brandy, bourbon, toffee, and some chocolate. Just remarkable.
Overall, this was amazing. I could sip on this all night. The epitome of a sipper for sure, but the flavors are very complex. 977 characterstreyrab, Sep 29, 2009

This review is transcribed from an RB review, consumed in 2007. Paid $12 for a 1 ounce pour at House of Brews on 46th St. in NYC. This is very overpriced, but less so if you think of it as a nice sipping liqueur.
A - Brilliant orangish caramel color with no head.
S - Aroma is caramel, port, Courvoisier, dark fruits, vanilla, and alcohol (obviously, it is 27%).
T - Tastes a lot like a nice port - sweet with vinous notes as well as caramel, vanilla, and cherry. Alcohol definitely there, but what do you expect from a 27%er?
M - Fairly thick and syrupy with almost no carbonation, which is actually nice for this one. Liqueur-like. Nice alcohol warmth without the burn.
D - Well, it's meant to be a sipper and it is. Really awesome stuff, but way overpriced of course. Nice novelty beer. 865 charactersnickd717, Sep 10, 2009

A: Poured from the gotti copper bottle into some glass, dark brown in color, no carbonation, think enough to leg up the glass.
S: Big smell, actually bigger than the taste. You can smell the high ABV, but it's pleasant. Cinnamon maple dominates this one, but hints of caramel, alcohol, and raisins.
T: Yum. Not something one could drink in large quantities, but a very sweet and malty beer. Much like the smell, the maple dominates, but also caramel and raisins come to mind. Not overly sweet, but a lot of bold flavors that meld together nicely.
M: Pretty thick, no carbonation on the tongue.
D: The biggest deterrent is the $price$tag$, but one hell of an adventurous beer on Sam Adams part. The high abv makes this impossible to drink in large quantities, but when savored it's a great liver warming beer. 893 charactersMPLS, Aug 27, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A vintage 2007 bottle I purchased at community beverage in Elmhurst, NY. Opened it for the first time two days ago when my cousin proposed to his girlfriend. For this tasting, I poured a modest 1-2 oz serving into a brandy snifter.
A - A glimmering, crystal clear dark golden amber, with a viscosity that leaves legs when swirled in the glass. Remniscent of a top shelf whiskey.
S - If you're familiar with lots of DIPA's, you will be able to discern the hop aromas from the malt, but to the uninitiated, this will not seem like a beer at all. Among the myraid of aromas that burst forth into my nostrils was toffee, oak, chocolate, dried fruit, and a very fine malty backing to it all. I'd give it a perfect 5, but the strong alcohol that comes with the lovely smells swoops in alongside and burns your nostrils. I would not castigate someone if they mistook this for bourbon.
T - A pervasive yet not obnoxious sweetness outlines the jarringly intense flavors of this beer. Dark maple, jammy dried fruits, chocolate, heady vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee...even a faint note of hops. To say this is an experience is a gross understatement.
M - Like a cascade of flaming velvet on the tongue. The high alcohol gives off a cooling burn as the beer rolls around in the mouth before feeling the familiar liqueur heat in your throat as it goes down.
D - It would be unfair to judge this one's drinkability compared to the norm 5-10% ABV for any other beer. One must really think hard liquor when judging it. By those standards, it is oh so smooth and easy sipping. But still, even when adjusting expectations, it is still a strong beer by puire definition, so the astronomical ABV does have to factor into the decision. It should be illegal to drink this one in anything other than small sips, in order to get every ounce of enjoyment one can out of it, especially considering the price.
Overall - The fancy, after-dinner liqueur for the beer drinker that doesn't like liqueur. If Millennium and Triple Bock challenged what a beer could be, Utopias downright defies it. Is it the ultimate evolution of beer? Or is it just a snooty pet project from the nutjobs in Boston? Does it really matter? This beer is awesome, and that's all that matters. Grab a few snifters and a few really good friends, and enjoy. 2,306 charactersDannyS, Aug 24, 2009

A: Shiny amber color, clear liquid. Obviously no head.
S: Lots of sweet fruit aromas (apples, plums, cherries), raisins, brandy. Notes of wood and a hint of dusty cellar. Big alcohol fumes, but they are well integrated and the smell is actually quite balanced. Very rich.
T: Intensely sweet with notes of fudge and toffee, chocolate, nuts and rich aromas of ripe fruit. Boozy raisins, brandy and barrel notes. The taste is richer than the smell and more complex. A faint cellar character is detectable, but not as clearly as in the smell. The finish is really hot with lots of spicy and sweet alcohol and lingering liqueur-like sweetness. 
M: A great mouthfeel. Big body with a very sticky and chewy texture. Completely flat.
D: I actually like this one. Of course, it's more reminiscent of a fortified wine or liqueur than a regular beer, but that's how it's supposed to be. A great sipper with a sophisticated yet cocky character. 1,026 charactersricke, Jul 20, 2009

I am impressed with the smooth Hazelnut and vanilla-extract taste. Reminiscent of pancakes with hazelnuts and maple syrup, doused in whiskey. There is a very warm-alcohol mouthfeel.
For being so high in alcohol this is really a shockingly smooth beer. Must be enjoyed in a room of beer lovers, because this is intense, exploding all over the place with conversational quality. 600 charactersDrDCon, Jul 15, 2009

A: Pours a dark brown with reddish edges and zero head just like a liqueur. You can tell it coats the glass when swirling it around the glass.
S: Yes, there is a huge amount of booze scent like I'm smelling a hard liquor, but if you look closer, there's lots of woodsy, vanilla, oak, molasses, brown sugar
T: WOW, is the best way I can explain it. I didn't expect the flavor after what I smelled. Tons of heat...I picked up lots of dark berry and fruits, vanilla, oak, woodsy flavors, brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, caramel, raisin, bourbon
M: Very syrupy, coats the palate, oily and smooth

Smells like caramel, butter, vanilla, oak and cinnamon create a robust aroma.
Tastes like I would imagine vanilla butter liqueur to taste like. There is also a nutty flavor which I usually don't like but it welds the different flavors together nicely in this beer. Caramel butternut.
Mouthfeel is silky, oily and heavy. Very much appreciated. 
Drinkability is high. I would imagine most reciting this as a sipper, but I could finish a bottle possibly to myself, definitely with a friend.
Think a beer that tastes like a liquid Werther's Toffee, intertwining complexities and profiles seamlessly and balancing the liquor/beer nicely. Hard to make a a beer taste like a beer when it has no carbonation. That mission was accomplished here. 786 charactersnatelocc787, Jun 08, 2009

T: AMAZING. Maple, brown sugar, malt, vanilla, molasses, rum, bourbon whiskey, carmelized sugar/ creme brulee. Like a liqueur. Complex. Woody, burnt. Strong alcoholic flavor. 
D: Good alone, or with dessert. Absolutely worth the cost, it has earned its reputation. Very warming, good for the winter. 427 charactersdananabanana, Apr 27, 2009

4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured a few ounces into Brandy snifter. 
A: Deep dark brown color with the look of a nice brandy. No sign of carbonation or a head.
S: Unbelievable smell. You can smell the carmel, toffee, hazelnut, chocolate and tobacco notes. It is strong but pleasant as you swirl it around the glass.
T: When tasting this beer, the smell is so overwhelmingly strong that it can create a sense of a bad taste. Easier to make sure to not breath as you take the first sip. This really gives you a sense of the deeply complex beer. You can immediately taste the strong alcohol but perfect. The taste of tobacco, chocolate, and leather. A strong taste of hazelnut and raisins just overwhelm the palette. Leaves a warming aftertaste that you wish could stay with you for longer.
M&D: Feel warm, oily, and smooth to the palette....like a smooth brandy. It is still very drinkable for a beer of this strength. A few ounces every once in a while is a great pleasure. 
I have the bottle from 2006 and still tastes unbelievable and actually think it is getting better with age. Highly recommend trying this beer if you ever get the opportunity. 1,126 charactersspycow, Apr 05, 2009

Pours a cloudy brown color with a minimal creamy off-white head that diminished and produced minimal lacing. Heavy complex aroma of roasted malt , maple sugar. Medium to full body with a thick texture and flat carbonation. Good flavor with heavy complex bittersweet and heavy complex sweet finish of long duration with a nice alcohol burn.
Great brew. 366 characterstmoneyba, Mar 24, 2009

S: The nose on this beer is really incredible. Booze is definitely there and right up front. Hints of toffee, roasted nuts, wood, chocolate, raisins, dates. Basically this is just about everything you have ever smelled in a beer minus hops thrown at you at once.
T: The sweetness and booze are really powerful. Most of the elements of the nose are detectible in the taste but drowned out by the booze a little bit. This beer reminds me of a port or cognac. Totally different than anything else out there.
M: No carbonation at all. Super thick but somehow not heavy on the tongue.
D: Somehow really drinkable. Had a 2oz sample of this and that was more than enough. Then I had another 2 oz sample. The warmer this gets the better it gets. Just an amazing beer that really does push the limits of what beer can be. The cellaring potential on this beer is off the charts. I don't think it will ever get worse. 1,048 charactersaerozeppl, Mar 09, 2009

Lots of alcohol but pleasant. Very nutty, mostly hazelnut with some maple syrup.
So much flavor. Pecan, Hazelnut, almond and vanilla are all in the body of flavor. Alcohol is definitely present but actually contributes to the beer. The finish a pleasant maple syrup. 
Very syrupy, where I could expect and desire it to be.

No head at all. A rich ruby-amber color. Lots of legs on my glass

Taste. Very sweet. Like a port or sherry. Booze warms the tummy. Sugar cane , butterscotch, vanilla.

A - There were a few bubbles when poured, but that is it. Amber-brown color, with wine-like glass stickiness. That's about as much as I can expect from a 25% brew.
S - Maple syrup, grapes, wood, caramel, toffee, smoke, chocolate, raspberry, the list goes on and on. This is one incredible smell. Surprisingly, the booze is understated. This is one incredibly deep and complex bouquet.
T - Tons of flavors as well - maple, vanilla, wood, caramel, dark fruits, butterscotch...not even sure where to stop. This thing changes with each sip. Sweet Jesus - there's even less booziness to the taste than there is to the smell.
M - Drinks like a fine cognac. Lots of alcohol warming, stickiness. Obviously there is no carbonation.
D - Ummm..the 2oz serving is plenty? I don't even know how to define drinkability of a beer of this sort. I know my wife has been sneaking shots of this, and for good reason - it tastes amazing.
I'm not even sure this is beer anymore, but it tastes amazing. If it wasn't so ridiculously expensive this would be a regular feature in my liquor cabinet. 1,177 charactersMasterSki, Feb 12, 2009

pours beautiful crystal clear deep red-brown with no trace of carbonation or head. great legs though!
aroma is intense. big rich caramel and toffee, but that just doesn't begin to touch the depth. big fruity component too - date, raisin, dried cranberry, fig. there's also no mistaking the alcohol in this one - it's there and it's proud. notes of chocolate, coffee, wood, earth, licorice, and smoke. wow, i could just keep smelling this all day.
taste is excellent. everything from the aroma and then some. nice light sweetness too. it makes me think of port or cognac, but even more drinkable. damn, i am truly in love with this beer.
mouthfeel is great. about medium body and with no carbonation, but honestly it isn't needed or missed.
drinkability is excellent. this beer is amazing. the alcohol is always there, but silky smooth and so good. the complexity and depth of character are just so amazing that you're constantly wanting more and picking out other little nuances in it.
i was a little skeptical going in to this one. i really wanted to try it, but expected something boozy and very obviously not "beer". however, i was very pleasantly surprised. even with the higher alcohol, it never loses its "beer" character. sure, there are comparisons to be drawn, but this is more like a strong finely-aged barleywine or strong ale than a port or cognac. even at the high bottle cost, i honestly want a bottle of this so i can just spend a day sipping on it. so good. huge thanks go out to mike for pulling this from his personal stash for the event. 1,658 charactersgrub, Feb 05, 2009

Pours a crystal clear dark amber, nice honey colour, no head and no lace, but does sport some pretty insane looking legs, they really stick all over the glass. Smell is amazing and intense, vanilla, honey, oak, toffee, nougat, insanely malty, alcohol, grapes, figs and raisins, butterscotch, slightly musty, maple, just crazy rich and intense. Taste is the same, mega intense, wood, insane amount of toffee and honey, brown sugar, figs, raisins, vanilla, dark fruit, maple syrup, alcohol, just has everything in the flavour, very rich and malty. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy, low carbonation, insanely smooth, you do not get the almost 26% alcohol out of this. Perfect fireside sipping beer, I'd replace everything of that sort in my liquor cabinet for this stuff. Just amazing and I'm really happy I got the chance to try this. Perfect for what it is, need to get me some. 977 charactersViggo, Jan 26, 2009

I had a small sample of this amazing beer. I know it was just a taste but I felt I needed to explain the experience.
The appearance was a dark gold/amber, no head and no carbonation. 
The smell was complex, many flavors blending together, the hints of dark chocolate, a little coffee bean aroma, some maple syrup flavor.
The taste was quite warm, since served at room temperature and also due to the high alcohol content. The taste had hints of chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, raisin, walnuts, peanut butter, and a few more I can't name.
I'm sure this was not intended to consume in large amounts but a tasting was just the right amount. It went done smooth and just seemed to slide across the tongue. 720 charactersDuhast500, Jan 23, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52007 Bottle Number 08474 - Pours a beautiful orange/brown with absolutely not a trace of carbonation. This is more like a fine cognac than a beer. Sampled along side by side with Hair of the Dog Dave. Dave being happily aged for 14 years was mellow and welcoming, purring like a cat with a ton of complexity. The young un-behaved 2007 Utopias was still screaming with plenty of maple syrup, spicy fruits and a whopping of alcohol playing haphazardly on the tongue. The 2007 Utopias could use a good 8 to 10 years of time out. This is a highly addictive drink that makes you pay whatever it takes on ebay to satisfy the craving for more. I am saving a bottle for 2017 and another bottle for 2027. 695 charactersATLbeerDog, Jan 20, 2009

I am just all over the place on this one - a friend of mine poured this non carbonated dark ambered brew in a shot glass where I tasted it in the kitchen where his wife just pulled out homemade raisin oatmeal cookies from the oven! BTW, unbelievable pairing.
Here's what I got in the aroma and flavor as they are simply parallel:
- sugar cookie
- raisin toast
- caramel apple
- raisin oatmeal cookie (go figure)
- cocoa puffs - i was dumbfounded by this flavor and my friend's wife HAD cocoa puffs cereal in their pantry, i opened up the box and grabbed a handfull of cocoa puffs and a sip of Utopias- exquisite!
- prunes
- walnut oil
- roasted pecans
- vanilla bean
- rubber ball (tasted this weird smell and flavor as it warmed)
- some fuesel alcohol flavors were present but not overwhelming - i mean what do you expect from a 25% brew?! 902 charactersbrandoneast, Jan 09, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a crystal clear amber color with a golden ring around the edges; no head, of course, but I was not expecting one
Smell: Burning whiff of maple, caramel, vanilla and rum-soaked golden fruit
Taste: Sweet and burning from the outset, with maple sugar, vanilla and caramel, along with the alcohol soaked golden raisins; after the swallow, a burning sensation of maple and vanilla, bordering on a Bourbon, but more like a liqueur
Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous; still, with no carbonation
Drinkability: A nice after dinner sipper, but something to spread out over time, as it is very stable; a nice toast to end Christmas 2008 641 charactersbrentk56, Dec 25, 2008
3.44/5  rDev -22%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3This was a 2007/2008 brew. Big thanks go out to a friend of mine for allowing me the pleasure of tasting this one. I know that without him having getting his hands on one I would have most likely never have tasted it.
If you blind poured this for anyone they would not be able to tell you that it was a beer. Period. I know that Sam Adams brewed it, but outside of that there is a hard time convincing myself to call it a beer. 
Appearance - Same as everyone else Amber w/ no carbonation. 
Smell - First and foremost alcohol, Spices, Syrup ?maple? (sorry I have a hard time with hard liquors and picking out smells)
Taste - Spiced Liquor at first with a great finish reminds me of pine nuts and maple syrup with a warm camel after taste that sticks around for a while. After finishing this I was tasting it for about 10 more minutes of a lingering Carmel taste. Very pleasant
Drinkability - It is a sipping liquor. Pour into a small glass and sip away a winter night with a group of friends. Personally thought it was hard to get down due to the high alcohol content. 
If you do not like Hard liquors you will most likely not like this. I only drink beer, and I found myself having a really hard time with this one. I can definitely see where people would love this, but I personally would not go out of my way to have it again because it is more of a Hard Liquor than a beer. 1,382 charactersShaon94, Dec 23, 2008

Huge thanks goes out to EmperorStan for cracking his bottle with me, and for giving me a generous heavy handed pour of "a few ounces", and then a refill. What a guy!
Pours a beautiful mahogany color, with big ruby hues with some amber and brown all at once. Obviously, no head as there's no carbonation.
The aroma is awesome. Big notes of oak, tons of booze, some smoke, bourbon, vanilla, and maple syrup. 
I don't care what the "cheap cognac" people say. This is awesome, and one hell of a beer exploration. I applaud the envelope pushing at Boston Beer Co. Huge maple syrup note dominates the taste. It's like oak aged syrup, really. Very sweet, though not cloying in the course of a few ounces enjoyed over a moderate period of time. Some notes of vanilla, oak, and smoke are certainly all there. 
Mouthfeel is pushing full bodied, and certainly syrupy feeling. Again, no carbonation to speak of.
Drinkability is suprisingly high. The flavor profile is spot on IMO and quite enjoyable, and although the alcohol is very apparent, it's an important aspect to this beer. I love it. 1,102 charactersGoliath, Dec 23, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Thick, almost syrupy. Earthy, caramel color, no head. Swirling it around coats the side of the glass nicely.
S - Raisins, maple syrup, port wine. Strong alcohol smell. People sitting 15 feet away could smell the alcohol.
T - Maple, vanilla, raisins again. Strong at first taste, then becomes smoother and easier, leaves you with a blast of alcohol. Not quite cognac, but sort of...
M - Warming, burning alcohol, but at the same time, smooth
D - Sip this one and enjoy the complexity. This is not a beer by conventional definition. I only drank about 4 oz, and that was plenty. Kept me warm on a cold winter day 618 characterssmedley, Dec 21, 2008

A - Caramel, raisin color. Completely still. Syrupy legs left running down the side of the glass.
S - Very boozy, obviously at 20%+. Rubbing alcohol, a strange combo of sherry, port, cognac and bourbon all blended smoothly together. Raisins, brown sugar and plums with nose burning alcohol.
T - Reminds me of a nice rich cognac. Slight burning alcohol, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, sherry and plums. Nice and complex and much smoother than alcohol at similar proofs.
M - Thick and syrupy. Like a cross between alcohol and a liqueur.
D - You need to give it a little time to open up or it is an alcohol mess. Very good and nice to see some breweries, especially as big as Sam Adams pushing the edge on beer styles. 738 charactersbrewcrew76, Dec 05, 2008
3.44/5  rDev -22%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 1.5 |  overall: 2At what point does beer stop being beer? That line lies, I think, somewhere between Extreme Beer and Utopia. This beverage may start out like beer, but on its trip to the brewing stratosphere, it winds up more like a poor cognac.
Pours a dark caramel with no head. Swirling it in a brandy snifter produces long, deep legs. The smell is a deep caramel, bourbon-like, perhaps a bit rasiny, with a slap of alcohol. The taste is brown sugar, creme brule, raisins, creme, vanilla, and bourbon. It suggests butter, praline, pecan, and walnut.The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, fatty around the mouth, very difficult to drink.
This is interesting to try, but it fails a key test: what is the point? If you want a beer, have a beer. If you want Cognac, have cognac. This is neither and therefore will satisfy nobody. 806 charactersSeanibus, Nov 27, 2008
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to tpd975 for the chance to try this. I poured my sample into a Bush (aka Scaldis) mini-goblet, which I don't think I've used since my trip to the brewery, so this felt like the right occasion.
Pours with no head, of course. (You trying brewing a 25% beer with any kind of head on it!) Rolls around in the glass like Frangelico or something; earthy amber in color.
Can't believe how good this smells. Given the high ABV you'd think it would be an aromatic disaster, but it's not. There's definitely a strong wave of alcohol fumes, but it also gives off brilliant woody and nutty aromas, a little vanilla too. Lots of oak as the smelling continues--but now I'm anxious for another sip...
Lots of repeat flavors from the aroma--oak-y, nutty, subtle vanilla (vanilla extract, anyway, but nothing wrong with that). Maybe a little maple, too. Alcohol is big, but completely sip-able, not at all cloying (amazing), lending added depth to the flavor without ever detracting. A total treat.
Texture is syrupy yet not heavy, has a soothing glide like a liqueur, and it pretty much tastes and drinks like a liqueur. 
A special occasion beer--and yes, this is beer. Reminding myself of that as I sipped helped me remember 1) the almost limitless possibilities of the brewing process, and 2) the talent of Jim Koch and co. when they really roll their sleeves up and get to it. This is a far sight better than their Triple Bock--don't even compare the two, even if it's tempting to do so. (Thanks again Greg!) 1,508 charactersMetalmonk, Oct 23, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm in love with this beer. I tasted the first version at a Boston beer fest, and was blown away. Later, I managed to pick up a single bottle of the 2005, and when the 2007 came out, I was ready.
Great beer. It reminds me a lot of a good tawny port, it's got that sweet carmelized flavor, almost like it was distilled. It's sticky and slightly thick like port.. but then you taste, and there are flavors here that you just cannot get with grapes. 
Definitely sip this one... savor it. Share it with your friends, surprise them with the fact that yes, this really is beer.
Thanks to Jim Koch and everyone at Sam Adams, this is something truely unique. 653 charactersmichael573114, Oct 23, 2008

This pours a dark red/burgundy with no head at all, its served still. Looks thicker and almost syrupy compared to any other beer ever. Smells of cognac, port wine, alcohol, and maple. Tastes like it smells, lots of alcohol in there. This one is a sipper for sure! Sweet sticky mouthfeel with a slight alcohol burn and a thick body.

Pours a brown, almost burgundy color with no head. Coats the glass fairly well when it's swirled.
Smells like a toffee liquor. Lots of buttery aroma, with a good bit of alcohol.
Tastes the same as it smells, but a bit more complex. If I had to sum it up in one word it would be buttery, but there's also some caramel, toffee, and a touch of chocolate. Very warming.
Mouthfeel is very good. It goes down very smoothly, and it has a good thickness.
This is pretty drinkable. It's not something I want to drink on a regular basis, but I had absolutely no trouble finishing the glass.
Overall I'm glad I had a chance to try this. It's very interesting, somehow it still resembles a beer. Definitely worth a try. 753 charactersglid02, Aug 25, 2008

Poured a syrupy dark amber with no carbonation. Smelt of condensed maple, alcohol and molasses. Taste was pure maple, molasses, and a smooth alcohol burn. Truly unique and amazing.

What an awesome bottle. Pretty epic stuff. 
Pours a slightly amber dark brown. No head. Smells wonderful: malty, woodsy, maple-syrupy, and the taste is very satisfying, with a vanilla/oaky/boozy overlay that makes it a wonderful sipper.
I could see how this wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, and it certainly isn't "drinkable" in the slightest, but really wonderful to try. 639 charactersOverlord, Aug 04, 2008

It looks more like liquor then beer, and the nose is off the charts (and clearly more developed then the 07). Malt, port, caramel, dates...Seriously, every other time I lifted this to my lips just inhaling the delicious aroma was enough. And the flavor; a drop on the tongue spreads throughout the mouth a delcious complicated hoppy, malty, caramel magic. Being stranded on a desert island would be worth it if a bottle of this was along. I thought this beer would be all hype but it was worth every dollar. 586 characterstemplar316, Jul 28, 2008

It was a nice dark bronze/copper color with no head or lacing (as expected). A very nice aroma with some sweet smells and vanilly. The flavor was very smooth which matched the aromas and you could taste the alcohol. It very much reminded me of a tawny port in both smell and taste. The mouthfeel was very smooth and syrupy. Even at the price, this is one that I would love to pick up a bottle of and slowly savor. It's definitely a sipper. 517 charactersmhewes, Jul 21, 2008

Dark reddish amber, and very Cognac-like in appearance, how can one turn away. The aromas jump out at you whilst you take in the colour of this brew. Yes, they are that strong and seem to shout things like Alcohol!, Sugar!, Raisins!, Sherry!, Port!, Cognac!, Malts, and Plums! The taste is burning and singing with alcohol, but in a good way like a fine strong port, or a nice French Cognac. The taste is all alcohol, molasses, other sugars, dark fruits, nuts, syrups, and more. Truly a "beer" to behold. Mouthfeel is liquor-like and coating and the drinkability is actually quite good for a beer that you drink by the shot, or snifter. Truly a one-of-a-kind brew.

4.9/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is not just the best beer ever, it is not just the best fermented drink ever, but it is perhaps the best alcoholic beverage in the history of mankind. Let's just say, the long-dead American patriot shouldn't just be honored to have his name on this, he should be greatly worried that history will remember Sam Adams Utopias the beer before they remember Sam Adams the man. 
Utopias comes in a bomber-sized, ceramic genie-bottle-shaped vessel that if you rub the side and unscrew the cap a spirit (luckily one NOT voiced by the insufferable Robin Williams) pops out, not granting you three wishes but instead telling you that if you have just a few ounces of this beer you will achieve nirvana.
Appearance: An absolutely gorgeous amber like what that dinosaur-blood-sucking mosquito was frozen in "Jurassic Park."
Smell: A bouquet of incredibly potent maple syrup, but this ain't Aunt Jemima, it's the good stuff you buy at a hippie farmer's market. The aroma goes up your nose as the Utopias' odorants bind with olfactory neuron cell bodies. Their axons synapse in the olfactory bulb region in your brain, making you go, "God Damn! I said God Damn!" like Mrs. Mia Wallace in "Pulp Fiction."
Taste: More full-bodied than Aretha Franklin. Maple syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, honey, several different types of yeast, caramel malts, and a whole lotta hops though not much bite. Earthy with some spice and hints of bourbon and sherry due to aging I believe. A creamy, chocolate and coffee-like finish. More sublime than "40 Oz. to Freedom."
Mouthfeel: Nearly indescribable. As complex as beer, if not any alcohol, can possibly get. God did not create a human with enough writing prowess to adequately discuss the Utopias's feel. It is absolutely unlike beer, lacking in carbonation and with no need for refrigeration. It would best be described as nearer to being a potent barley wine, a sherry, an aged port, maybe a bourbon, or most likely fine cognac as composed to a measly brew. The difference between the "beers" of Utopias and, say, Bud Light is more pronounced than the the slugging difference between George Herman Ruth and Dr. Ruth Westheimer.
Drinkability: Eminently drinkable though one will probably never consume more than an ounce or two in a sitting as it is like drinking money. Figuratively of course.
Consuming this beer will ruin you for the rest of the day (if not your entire existence on planet earth). Not cause it's that potent-remember, you're only savoring a few ounces of it max-but, rather, because everything afterward will taste so sub-par. 
Utopias will change your thoughts about beer and imbibing for the rest of time. If you are ever lucky enough to find this beer, pay whatever is asked for it.
I don't believe in a higher power but I still love Ben Franklin's famous saying, "Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy." He could have easily been referring to Utopias.
My absolutely highest recommendation. A masterpiece.

4.72/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Tasted at room temperature, out of a snifter. It's slightly thick and syrupy, with a pleasant mouth feel. It's sweet and warming, with flavors of maple, vanilla, oak and caramel. It's a wholly unique experience -- it doesn't taste much like beer, or for that matter scotch or anything else. Absolutely worth trying, and worth the price, but not the sort of thing I'd want to regularly indulge in. 396 charactersdewalt, Jun 29, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4So I was lucky enough to get to try this one from a wonderful BA who capped a few ounces for me to enjoy. I had been dying to try a bottle but have never been able to land one personally so it was a good day for me to say the least to be able to finally try this. Let it chill out in the fridge for a couple days before pouring it into a small snifter to take a taste. The look was much like a strong barley wine for me. Rich and very hazy copper colored amber with a very dark and menacing look to it. No real head to speak of, nor any lace. Utterly motionless and menacing, this was really going to be a fun nightcap.
So I really did not know what to expect from this one, but went in for the smell and was blown away by how sweet it was. Really just tremendously rich in maple syrup like aroma. Lots of brandy like alcohol smell as well. Really complex, some light honey or caramel in there, quite nice overall. The flavor was more of the same with a rich and very sweet maple syrup like cognac taste. Huge profile here, with subtle hints of honey and anything else sweet you could think of. Fine spiciness with a deep warmth coming up from the bellows on this one. You could definitely feel the alcohol all the way, but it was not harsh at all and surprisingly quite mellow. The consistency of syrup, it was really quite nice. I had no issue sipping he few ounces I had, but that would be probably it for a session to really enjoy what this one can bring to the table.
Overall this was really unlike anything I had before. It is in a class of its own, as it should be and something that everyone should get to try. For 120.00 I would buy a bottle with no issues asked. I would love to have this one sitting around waiting for me every night! 1,747 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 24, 2008

Taste: Once again- Holy Maple syrup. Very sweet. Slight vanilla taste also.
Mouthfeel: Just incredible. Silky smooth. Slight alcohol taste with the first few sips-warms all the way down.
Drinkability: Take it slow and easy with this one! A true sipper and great for after dinner.

Big thanks to Mudpuppet for helping me knock off one of my holy grails.
I wanted to save this one for a quiet moment so my wife & i could savor it. Last Saturday, my daughter was babysat at my parents, so, perfect occasion to enjoy this. My wife pitched in this review.
Poured from a hand-bottled bottle, 2-3 oz.
Appearance: Pours a leather-brown body. No head or carbonation, which is to be expected. 
Smell: High-octane alcohol which reminds me of a good whiskey. Heady & delightful!
Taste: Reminiscent of a good sherry or porto, strong in the forefront, kind of whispers at the end. Balanced through & through.
Mouthfeel: Warms the mouth, cloves & cherry in the palate with a dry, mild fruit-like (woodland berries) finish. A wood-like character permeates the taste but not overwhelmingly so. Definitely has a porto vibe to it. Sweet notes are also there but not sugary sweet, more of a warming, fruit-like sweetness, not artificial sweetness.
Drinkability: Top notch as this is a great sipper, perfect for the end of the evening. A couple of ounces is enough for one sitting.
Overall: Drop all preconceived notions of beer when tasting this. Treat it as you would any hard liquor of your choice & you'll be fine. Though i probably won't splurge 120$+ on a bottle, i definitely love this brew & was very fortunate to have had the opportunity to try it. You should try this at least once. 1,418 characterspapat444, May 21, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Quite a while ago I had the unfortunate experience of trying over and over again to like Sam Adams Triple Bock. I tried multiple bottles, both fresh and aged over 5 years. None of them worked for me. I could never get over the taste of soy sauce and dead yeast. Happily, this attempt at creating a super strong beer fares much better. First off, the bottle is beautiful- I love the copper sheathing. The pour itselff looks like a cognac or something, but slightly more viscous. No head at all, but excellent clarity and it sticks to the glass. The aromas are not at all beer like. Instead I get maple sweetened brandy, but nicely balanced and not too sweet. The taste is even nicer, for what it is. Long brandy like heat, but fairly smooth and tempered somewhat by clean-tasting relatively dry maple syrup flavors, and some vinous qualities. Extremely smooth in the mouth, and although surprisingly dry, the sweetness and feeling of alcohol build as you drink and necessitate only having a single small pour. Very interesting, and very much a beer digestif. 1,057 charactersGeorgiabeer, May 07, 2008
4.03/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Spills out a clear, dark mahogany body. No head, but there's some legs to it. Oh, and what a classy-looking bottle.
Smell: Some toasty, carmelly malts along with dark fruits soaked in three parts cognac and one part Golden Grain.
Taste: It's sweet! Sugar-caoted dark fruits tossed into syrup. It's that sweet, people. Ah, caramel candy, too. Along that first taste you get a hit of very hot, throat-scalding alcohol, but with each consecutive sip it gets more and more creamy (or your tongue gets more and more numb). Warming finish, baby!
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. No carbonation. Coating mouthfeel.
Drinkability: A super slow sipper for sure, and one that's made even more enjoyable when you weren't the one who actually paid for the bottle. 762 charactersChainGangGuy, Apr 29, 2008
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received a couple ounce pour of this from tpd975 in a recent trade. I sampled this about three weeks ago while in Boise with my old roommates. Drank from a small generic snifter.
Appearance- Pours a dark caramel brown with a very syrupy, thick feel. Zero on the head along with any sort of cap and collar. I don't know if I can really review the appearance of this based on what a normal beer is supposed to look like.
Smell- Loads of caramel sweetness that seemed to jump out of the snifter. It's quite a bit sweeter in the nose than a whiskey but it smells a lot like one. The alcohol is definitely there but not near as prominent as straight 80 proof whiskeys. Vanilla, oak, tree bark, and burnt brown sugar are all detectable along with a light maple syrup pulling everything together.
Taste- Much like the nose the first thing that grabs me is the sweetness. Full of toffee and vanilla the oak really shows leaving a very rich pleasing flavor. Very whiskey/brandy-ish in flavor if you added a sugar cube to a 2 oz pour of either (like you would with Absinthe). A bit of a lingering maple syrup aftertaste that is a bit nutty and hot. The alcohol definitely wasn't shy.
Mouthfeel- Thick and syrupy with a smooth creaminess and zero carbonation. Very warming.
Drinkability- Well there's no way I could drink more than a couple ounces of this at a time but it's definitely tasty. I am a fan of a nice whiskey over a couple cubes and this was sort of in the same breath. I'm sure it was more of a cognac or brandy but I don't drink that stuff. Pretty darn good and big thanks again to Greg! 1,592 charactersyounger35, Apr 24, 2008
4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3I had a treat to trade some 120 for some of this amazing beer. If you can call it beer.
The appearance is a deep dark brown which pours exceptionally syrupy. There is no carbonation and no head. The lace is very whiskey style. 
The smell is of pure whiskey. It doesn't have the strong alcohol smell that whiskey does.
The taste was amazingly complex. It was extremely whiskey flavor. Without the big alcohol taste at the end. Instead the end was very smooth with vanilla hints coming out.
The mouthfeel was extremely syrupy. It was almost a liquor. It smelled and tasted and felt like whiskey.
The drinkability is good. It was a sipping liquor almost more than a drinking beer.
I am amazed that this bottle cost $160 and a bottle of 120 is only $10. It is a great beer experiment. But the beer obviously taken on alcohol from the whiskey. 844 charactersslvrmon82, Apr 08, 2008
3.99/5  rDev -9.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I poured from the unique copper bottle into the crystal utopias glass. I had a portion of the bottle at an extreme beer tasting event held on a dock on the Columbia River.
A: It poured a thick, sticky and deep amber body with no carbonation, head or lacing. As it poured it seemed more like maple syrup than beer. This is difficult to rate as there are no others like it, however, rate it I will.
S: It emitted a boat load of sweetness and alcohol. The sticky sweetness had its roots in brown sugar, vanilla and caramel. There are hints of smoky oak and caramelized maple syrup.
T: This is all about the sweet malts and sugars. It's sticky sweetness coated my mouth then melted like butter. It had flavors of caramel and vanilla and a back of alcohol that left a warm and clean palate. 
M: It was full-bodied, thick and sticky. It was like drinking a beer brandy with rich flavors and pronounced warming from the alcohol. 
D: This is a sipper. At a couple of ounces at a time this makes for a wonderful after dinner or before bead treat. I doubt much more than a few ounces in any one setting would be able to be appreciated. 1,130 charactersdnichols, Apr 06, 2008
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was quite an exceptional treat to sample. It's technically a beer, although its characteristics are more like a scotch or cognac. It poured a clear, dark copper with no head. It had an extremely strong and complex scent of brown sugar malt, cinnamon sugar, wheat, and alcohol. Its flavor was even stronger, blending super sweet honey, maple syrup, hazel nut, refined wheat, and delicate malt. It was oily and very smooth with no carbonation, and a very strong and lasting aftertaste of bitterness and alcohol warming. Overall this was just about perfect - one of the best alcoholic beverages of any sort that I've tried. It was very simple at first, but the more you thought about it, the more complex it became. It had chameleon-like characteristics, in that you could discern hints of practically any flavor you thought about. Despite the ridiculous price tag, this is worth it. 885 charactersPencible, Mar 29, 2008
3.99/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 1.5Poured into a Samuel Adams Utopias glass at the Yard House in Rancho Cucamonga tonight, two ounces cost me twenty dollars which was not too bad, it was better than spending two hundred dollars plus on a full bottle of it, heard they had it from a friend today and asked my girlfriend take me down there immediately, bought her dinner afterwards of course, bartender told me he did not recommend it but that was never going to stop me from trying this highly hyped brew from Boston Beer
A-Ruby red with brown accents, when held up to the light it appears to still be rather dark, absolutely no carbonation, not a drop of head or lacing, just flat liquid sitting in a small glass like a shot of whiskey would or a flat soda
S-Vanilla, floral accents, cinnamon, pine hoppiness, apricots, tangerines, oranges, brandy, almonds, plums, toffee, caramel, sweet malt, teriyaki, ripe dark fruits, port, bourbon, scotch, and lots of booze, did not lack complexity
T-Taste was full of molasses in the first sip, each drink I took from my glass, probably about eight total, were complety different, tasted some chocolate after that with a large amount of dates, next sip tasted like straight cognac, surprisingly some hops too that providing some dryness in the finish to separate the strong alcohol burn going down, tons of vanilla and toffee after that, realized the beer is probably too strong to have any carbonation to begin with, last few sips had a variety of things going on that consisted of both dark fruits and citrus flavors, some nuttiness, loads of hard alcohol, burned malt and a big bourbon and brandy aftertaste, nobody would ever be able to figure out this was beer if they did not know better, sipped on for over thirty minutes and really savored it, quite enjoyable even though the taste was very harsh at times
M-Probably the fullest body I will ever see, completely flat because of its alcohol by volume, mouthfeel was all over the place but it was definitely strong, boozy, spicy, stinging, and dry, weird sensations on the tongue and burned the chest going down
D-The only reason this did not get a one in this category is because I was able to finish my super small glass, it is way too heavy to think about drinking another drop though, too strong to say the least, twenty-five percent is overkill in my opinion but it did not taste too bad, alcohol is not even close to being hidden, puts hair on your chest, packs the biggest punch of any other beer out there I have tasted 
This could easily be called a cognac or several other different types of hard alcohol, tasted much better than their Triple Bock even though it was much stronger, cannot imagine what Hair of the Dog Dave tastes like it has three or four percent ABV on this one, only twelve thousand bottles of this worldwide, aged in four different barrels throughout the year it is brewed, lots of time and effort go into making this rarity, truly one of the most unique beers I will ever have, glad I tried it even though it was the most expensive couple ounces of beer I will probably ever have, recommended if you do not mind pulling out the credit card 3,137 charactersFloydster, Mar 22, 2008
3.6/5  rDev -18.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This has to be the most hyped beer in America. For years I've heard about it but would never pay $125 for a 22 oz. bottle. I just thought, maybe one day I'll be lucky enough to find it being poured at a tasting somewhere. The moral to this story; If you go to enough beer tastings . . .
Found it being poured at the GABF by Jim Koch, no less. I sampled several glasses while chatting with the brewer. A nice experience.
As for the beer; it poured a deep brown color with some faint ruby highlights. No head. No carbonation.
Aromas of oak, mollasses, maple, vanilla and alcohol. A sweet cognac-like alcohol.
Tastes are similar. Big maple, mollasses flavors. Strong alcohol. Vanilla, even a hint of toffee.
Extremely full bodied and chewy. Flat. No carbonation at all. 
Overall, it was fun to finally try this beer with Koch as my bartender. It was interesting and complex. A strong/old ale type beer with massive alcohol. The most impressive thing about it was the drinkability. Was I blown away? No. Would I pay $125 for it. No. But I'd definitely drink it again for free. 1,078 charactersBillyB, Mar 12, 2008
4.43/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 750 ml bottle, of which I was given 2 oz, poured into a brandy snifter.
Appearance: Pours a clear deep reddish brown color, completey flat so no carbonation or head to mention.
Aroma: Hints of vanilla, maple, oak, and chocolate, but the alcohol overpowered everything else. 
Taste: A little vanilla, chocolate, and maple up front, then the alcohol takes over and dominates through the middle. The finish is sweet with the maple and vanilla making a comeback.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, thich and chewy, almost syrupy. Even with all that in mind I was amazed at how smooth it was.
Overall: I managed to find a bar that was offering the 2 oz. shots of this. I'm glad I paid the money I did for the shot, but I'm also glad I didn't buy the whole bottle at a store. In that end I'd recommend it, but only to those who seriously like the high gravity barley wine style beers, or port, or whiskey. 907 charactersFenwaySquid, Mar 11, 2008
4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Nice dark color, but since it's not carbonated there was nothing else to really observe. 
S- Scents of vanilla and maple were very pronounced.
T- Those vanilla and maple flavors were everywhere and were very pleasing to say the least. Stong alcohol content was evident, even if you didn't know that it's 25% going into it. Sweetness of the brew tamed the high alcohol so you didn't get too much burn.
M- Like a nice cognac, velvety and smooth.
D- The only thing that will keep you from having another is if you're buddy owns the bottle and won't part with any more. 2 maybe 3 short glasses of this will suffice. 618 charactersKeith238, Mar 10, 2008
4.01/5  rDev -9.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Don't really know how to review this but here goes...
Appearance: hazy dark brown more along the lines of a single malt. No head. No carbonation. Small grain matter at the bottom of the glass.
Smell: Strong. Chocolate, Apricot, Raisins, Yeast, Alcohol, Nice dryness hidden among the sweet overtones.
Taste: Raisins, Bold alcohol on the front with a nice layer of sweetness in the finish. Taste is more in the rear of the tongue and on the sides. Really complex after you dig your way through the alcohol. Maple syrup, yeast, and again some fruit (apricot or cherry).
Mouthfeel: Heavy and syrup like.
I see what all the fuss is about. Good and calling this an "extreme beer" is a good thing. Drink-ability is diminished purely of the alcohol content. Sip don't rip it. Enjoy just like a cognac. 798 charactersMYJELLOMISFIT, Mar 04, 2008
4.39/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A- No head, clear deep amber body. 
S- Big amount of port, scotch, whiskey, even a little hint of bourbon, and of course a huge amount of oak and vanilla. Faint hints of chocolate, and even just a hint of grass hops.
T- Huge alcohol with a nice big chocolate body to back it up. All the aromas come in and a sweet dominating caramel body. Big oak and tons of vanilla, with lots of dark sweet, almost candy, fruits. Very nice and complex. 
M- Full chewy body that is really oily with no carbonation at all.
D- I think it is really good but not easy to drink. It is more like a hard alcohol instead of a beer (of course). I doubt I would spend $150 on a bottle but to try a ounce of it (like I have) it is good. 709 charactersBlindPig, Mar 01, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +7.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I used the Sam Adams Utopias glass. It has a very deep red/brown color. No carbonation. Very clear.
It has a very sweet maple, brown sugar aroma. The alcohol is very strong when you stick your nose down in the glass. The oak barrel smell is very strong. When all the smells mix together it almost smells a little like cotton candy.
The first thing you notice is how it warms you up when you drink it. It's very sweet. It taste very much like it smells - maple syrup, brown sugar. The alcohol is very strong, but it adds that candy taste to it when mixed with the other flavors. The oak flavor is more prominent when you swallow.
Very smooth and light texture when it's first on your tongue. If you leave on the front of your tongue you get all sweet flavors, but as you swallow you get the very sharp alcohol burn.
This was one of best Christmas presents ever and it took me until now to drink it. I first had it a couple years ago at Sam Adams Beer Dinner. I would highly recommend everyone try it at least once. A couple ounces is more than enough. 1,054 charactersKallessin, Mar 01, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I was lucky enough to receive this as a gift from my wife for Christmas. I was so anxious to try this beer that I was almost nervous. I figured for the price, this beer must be something special. The first thing to hit me was the smell after opening the bottle. It smelled strong of alcohol, oak, and a sort of molasses sweetness. Poured out with no carbonation, but still looked nice in the Utopias snifter. The color was of a deep copper. The taste was smooth in comparison to ports and cognacs. It definitely can't be compared to most other beers. There are notes of oak, burnt caramel, vanilla, and fruits; but none of them overwhelm eachother. Part of the enjoyment of this beer probably comes from the experience of drinking a beer that is more expensive than a lot of fine wines and spirits. Athough it is smooth, this beer is definitely a sipper. Two ounces is just enough to make each tasting special. If you can find a bottle, or a bar that will sell it by 2 ounce shots, taste it. You'll be drinking a part of new beer history. 1,038 charactersAsher1982, Feb 12, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Extreme beers don't get any more extreme. ...or higher in quality. ...or more sultry or savory. This year's 10th Anniversary edition satisfies all the sophisticated taste, texture, and pleasure of anyone who believes they have a discerning palate. If, as a craft beer enthusiast, you enjoy the better things in life, then do yourself a favor.
An ounce and a half poured into a small brandy snifter proves to be all of the beer that's needed for full appreciation in taste. Its dark tawny redish brown hue and absolutely stillness allows the beer to relax and mirror port wine in appearance. A casual swirl of the glass allows the brandyish legging to climb up to the glass with a glossy sheen. No carbonation or foam character is necessary- all the complexities are built in to the aroma and taste.
Incredibly strong aromas of brandy-like alcohols weave into a savory mix of maple syrup, molasses, and rich dark fruit. Bordering on sherry, the mouth watering aromas waft over the palate with concentrated red grape, raspberry, plumb, dates, figs, and cashews. Aged oak becomes the common thread that ties all the dense fruit, peppery alcohol, and savory sweet notes together.
Insanely complex flavors of maple, toffee, and sorghum coat the mouth with a film of mature sweetnesses that's toasty and slightly seared to bring out a buttery taste that's devilishly seductive. The sweetness merges with fortified alcohols that stop shy of overly boozy distilled spirits. It's result is a port-like brandy taste that's even more captivating with the oxidized fruits- rum soaked cherries, raspberries, grapes all seem concentrated in taste even as complex sherry, cognac, bourbon, and scotch flavors emerge with each alternating sip. Mild herbal hops give a tea-like roundness to the taste, even as vinous tartness balance the sweet. Dried aged oak and even savory soy sauce and chocolate tastes emerge with elegance, grace, and an obviously masculine quality. This beer begs a pairing with a fine aromatic cigar.
Thin alcohol sweetness seeps into the mouth without the lift of carbonaiton to brace from its full brunt of tooth. Lightly oily and chewy at the same time, the beer's coat is like a rich dessert that's meant for sipping and savoring rather than drinking. Extremely warm, the beer is surprisingly balanced from the fusal heat and rounded off nicely for a smooth and peppery finish. Its closure of alcohol-sweet texture keeps rewarding the taste buds well into the next sip.
After recently having the past five vintages of the beer, its quite obvious that these beers get better and better with each subsequent release. Even as earlier versions are lesser in alcohol, they portray an overall rougher alcohol taste. The more recent versions are smoother, stronger, and more sophisticated in taste- and yes... worth every penny! 2,836 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 31, 2008

4.21/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5First off big thanks to Khiasmus for procuring this bottle. I've wanted to try this for a while, but have been put off by the price.
With something as bizarre as Utopias, it's tough to know where to begin. This is the strongest, strangest, most un-beer like "beer" I've ever had. Much like Dogfish's Fort or 120 Minute, Utopias will grab your notion of what you thought a beer could be and give it a good thrashing. This being the case, the best way to approach super-strong brews like this is to treat them like they're NOT beer, but rather a liqueur or a strong drink, say, port.
Anyways, other people have covered this exceptional brew fairly well in the reviews below. Let's hit on just a few highlights.
Utopias is completely flat. No carbonation of any kind. It's a burnt-amber brown and quite clear. Syrupy is a good start.
This has the biggest alcohol legs of any beer I've ever encountered. Yes, more than Dark Lord. (I'll wait for the collective gasp.)
If you stick your nose too deep into the glass, the alcohol stings your eyes.
The smell is wildly complex. Everyone got different things out of it, but common notes were maple, vanilla, oak, raisins, and sherry.
The finish is astonishing. More akin to a scotch than anything else, it's long and embracing and warming. I tasted no less than three different nuances from the casks. Sherry, toasted oak, and Madeira. 
It took me about 45 minutes to drink two ounces of Utopias, and I was hurrying. Two ounces was plenty.
Was the experience (and make no doubt, this was one) worth it? For sharing with friends, as we did, very much so. I would not recommend dropping the $150 - $200+ on a bottle for a single person alone. Utopias is good, yes, but two hundred smacks still buys a *lot* of good beer.
If you get a chance to sit 'round a fire and sip this beer with your favorite people in life, don't pass it up. It's a hard beer to get into; if you enjoy scotch and fine after dinner drinks you'll have a better time of it. 
Utopias may not rock your world, but it's certainly an unforgettable beer experience. And isn't that what us beer geeks live for?
Jim Koch, I tip my hat to you. Or would, if I had one. 2,181 characterskkipple, Jan 19, 2008

4.9/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased a bottle of the 2007 at a local Big Ten on a bank-account depleting purchase. Special thanks to NitroGen for his assistance in helping me get the SA Utopia glass that I sampled from!
APPEARANCE: A beautiful copper, amber look with absolutely no head and no carbonation. Leaves a beautiful glow inside an equally beautiful glass.
SMELL: Smells like a bourbon. Strong oak and molasses smell. Alcohol is also very noticeable.
TASTE: Wow...the alcohol hits first, but the taste is exceptional. Molasses, candy, vanilla...almost like a bourbon with a bit more candy. Excellent taste that is as deep and intricate as any beer or liquor that I have ever tasted.
MOUTHFEEL: Creamy, thick, and extremely enjoyable.
DRINKABILITY: Due to the amount of alcohol, I would have to knock this down one notch, but it isn't in any way because of the taste. It is an incredible beer to sip!
Overall, an exceptional beer/liquor. Well worth the money for me to try once in my life and exceptional to sip on. Will definitely consider purchasing another one if I can ever get my hands on it. 1,084 charactersNDPDuke, Jan 15, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A shout out to Deepak at Kingdom Liquor in Brandon for holding a bottle of this one back for me.
A: It poured a deep amber that is almost radiant. Very viscous for a beer, Nice and thick no lacing was left, but you could see it run down the glass after each and every drink. No head, no carbonation.
A: Tons of deep dark brown sugar mingled with sweet molasses and caramel. Boozy baking vanilla takes over in the middle with notes of oak and bourbon.
T: My buddy who tasted with me says this one is too sweet but I have to disagee. Tons of malt was used to get this baby at it's ABV. What you taste is an extreme amount of vanilla, and caramel with a hint of chocolate. The ABV is not hidden and you quickly realize this is to be enjoyed in small amounts as a sipper. The finish is buttery and oh so smooth.
M: Is very thick but smooth. The alcohol blends with the malt in a nice way. Sweet booze is soo nice. The finish lingers and lingers allowing you to enjoy the many tastes of this one.
Overall: I am honored to have a bottle of this on hand to sip as I please. I drank it as the colts game finished and it was a great way to end a wonderful day of drinking wonderful brews. I look forward to future occasions when I will sample this one because it is a wonderful and ultra unique brew that in my opinion is worth the high price tag. 1,343 characterstpd975, Jan 13, 2008

A- Completely flat, no head, looks like cognac or bourbon. Outrageous legs.
S- Unbelievably rich and complex. Oak, raisins, molasses, alcohol, honey, maple, vanilla, grape, amaretto, pecan, hazelnut, Brazil nut. There's probably more that I can't pick up on through everything else.
T- Intensely sweet with hints of caramel, molasses, toooons of maple, and everything mentioned above. The finish is long and full.
M- Smooth, syrupy, chewy, thick, warm, and extremely alcoholic.
D- The two-ounce portion is sufficient.... but I'm glad I have more.
Well... when I first heard of Utopias I knew that I would have it one day. How does one even begin to categorize or rate with numbers something that is nothing like anything else ever made? I would recommend to every beer fanatic a taste of this, at all costs. This will absolutely change your perception of what beer can be. It's much more like a port or scotch than a beer, of course. It's amazing. 1,022 characterskhiasmus, Jan 12, 2008
3.01/5  rDev -31.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 1.5I'm not really sure how to rate this "beer" as it is so different as to preclude it from being compared against any conventional beers, but I'll give it a shot. I poured a 1 oz. sample into my Utopias glass that came "free" with the purchase of the bottle. Color is a clear burnt orange with hints of amber and ruby. As it is flat, there is no head. Swirling reveals legs on the side of the glass as you get with fine wines and cognacs. Swirling also exposes the intense aromas of vanilla, maple, and brown sugar. These come out in the flavor as well, with an intense sweetness and a warming alcohol sense as it goes down. Given the sweetness, strength, and most importantly the cost, I would not want to drink more than 1 of these in a given evening, which is why I gave a low score for drinkability. Overall, its a nice novelty but not really what I look for in an alcoholic beverage, and the cost is staggeringly high at $150 per 25 oz. bottle (roughly $6 per once). 969 charactersTheBCrew, Jan 11, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ok so i bought a bottle and drank from it with my son who just came back from Iraq for a 2 week leave. How does it stack up against the on-tap i had at the brewery? Lets find out...
Weeeell...definetly more of an alcoholy taste but still not overpowering. It was definetly stronger out of the bottle. As for 8000, they liied they made 12000 bottles of this year. I do have to say i can definelty taste the chocolate more than i could even at the brewery. Bit of a bite going down but definetly not in the bad category. Smooth but not thin, maple, vanilla flavors as well. I think i am drinking it warmer tonight than i did at the brewery and im not sure if its making the alcohol taste come out more. 
Still very good and i did get it for original 150 dollar price. 767 charactersblatherbeard, Jan 09, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Brought a bottle to a New Years party to split with some other BAs. First drink of the night to make sure the taste wasn't tainted by anything else. I had mine from a snifter.
A- Medium-Dark gold/bronze brown color. Lots of legs. No head as expected because there isn't any carbonation.
S- Definitely resembles port but it's also a lot more. Caramel and maple smells easy to detect. The smell was strong but not overpowering. It's also very indicative of the taste.
T- First taste is strong caramel flavors with definite but not overwhelming alcohol, especially considering its abv. The taste resembles port as well, but not quite that sweet. It finishes with a strong and very pleasing maple-nut flavor.
M- No carbonation gives this a very smooth mouthfeel. The alcohol is present but surprisingly doesn't feel powerful enough to make this unpleasant at all.
D- Definitely a sipper because of the alcohol, but the tastes are so complex, I wouldn't want to do anything but sip and enjoy anyway. Even the small serving I had lasted some time because you don't need much to go through the progression of flavors it offers. This would be a regular in my cabinet if it weren't so cost-prohibitive.
I did buy a couple more bottles to cellar and I can't wait to taste how they are in a few years. I didn't think this could live up to the hype, but it did for me. I'll admit that I am a port fan as well, so I already enjoy a lot of the flavors and feel that Utopias brings to the table. 1,486 charactersSigurd, Jan 02, 2008

4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Not a fan of hard alcohol, so I am not too sure how much I will like this, but it something I had to try.
The pour is a dark copper/light brown look. Absolutley no head or carbonation at all.
At first smell, one can smell the alcohol. However, there is also a smell of wood or oak, with a hint of candy as well. 
 The first thing that I taste is the alcohol. It hits you right in the front of the tongue and lasts throughout. In the middle of the tongue one can taste a little bit of a very malty taste, with a note at the end of a sweet candy.
The mouthfeel is nice and thin, but a little bit more to it than say a scotch or a whiskey.
If one likes scotch or whiskey, I'm sure they would love to give this a try. It is definitely a sipper, but I am not sure how much I couldn't drink very much of this at all. 815 charactersBDIMike, Dec 25, 2007
4.74/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Having been active on BA for over two years now, it has been pretty impossible to not hear about this glorious experimentation taken upon by Sam Adams. I have heard both good and bad. I have also had a few of the close relatives of this brew, including DFH's 120 minute. I could not imagine the Utopia to be all that it is cracked up to be. I mean, just the ABV alone must make it unbearable, right?
Like many others who have reviewed this, the oppurtunity came along and I just had to know. 
Poured from what I imagine was the standard copper brew kettle, at the Sunset Grill & Tap, in Allston, MA. Hue is very different from any standard beer designation. Caramel in color, but density is more reminiscent of a liquor. No head.
Aroma is sweet. Candied sugar. Some fruit. Alcohol makes itself known.
 Taste is very sweet with alcohol burn up front and bold. Malted flavors include caramel, fruit like an apple. A woody taste grows as you drink. Makes it very similar to scotch in that respect. 
A sipper no doubt, but a very tasty one.
It was fun to have, but I don't see myself, because of the hefty price, buying a bottle anytime soon. 1,144 charactersFreshie, Dec 24, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It was pretty surprising to see Utopias on my local bar's beer menu. I was a bit hesitant to try another Sam Adams strong ale after trying the Triple Bock and finding it to be a mess of flavors that didn't belong together. However a sample of Utopias isn't something you come across everyday. The rarity and uniqueness of this brew pushed me over the edge, and past the price too.
2 ounce pour for $15 (!) at The Red in Santa Cruz. The bartender poured it into a kind of undersized champagne flute that I found to be very appropriate for the beer. It poured a deep amber that seemed to glow with light, as though by camera trick or special effects from a commercial. Very viscous for a beer, it left long thin legs down the glass after swirling. No head, no carbonation.
Aroma is primarily sweet molasses and caramel, with a distinct vanilla note. The booze manifests as a particularly oaky bourbon note.
Taste is a whirlwind of sweet and hot flavors. Chocolate, vanilla, and caramel wash over the tongue amidst exquisitely smooth booziness. Finish is buttery, almost butterscotchy. Obviously portlike although less fruity.
Mouthfeel is very thick but smooth. The alcohol blends with the sweet flavors seamlessly. The finish lingers for a long time, lending companionship to the slowly evolving warmth in the chest.
Considering the alcohol level, this is very very drinkable, but only by way of sipping. I'd love to have a bottle of this so I could pour a significant helping into a snifter and just slowly revel in the sweetness and warmth on a cold winter night. 1,569 charactersillidurit, Dec 23, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had about a two ounce sample of this last night at the Sam Adams' open house. Sampled in, what else, one of the brewery's ubiquitous Sam's tasting glasses.
Easily one of the best drinks I have ever had. Appearance was rich amber. The smell was strong caramel and licorice, while the taste was full of chocolate, some vanilla, and more caramel. Sweet, sweet, sweet. I think they really hit the alcohol level on the nose--there's no denying this is a super high ABV brew, but it is masterfully balanced. Mouthfeel was buttery. Finish was surprisingly malty; this was probably the biggest tell that it was a beer if you didn't know what you were drinking. In short, the 2007 Utopias is like a great port (and I've had some amazing vintage and tawny ports) but far more complex.
Along with the beer, they also had chocolate truffles made with Utopias. Nice touch, not to mention really tasty.
I came in to the tasting skeptical of whether this could really be a worthwhile brew. I left blown away. I could easily drink this every night in place of a good port were it not so cost-prohibitive. Simply put: excellent. 1,114 characterstriplecoil, Dec 21, 2007
2.4/5  rDev -45.6%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Bought this beer at Blanchards in Jamaica Plain.
Packaged in a copper kettle bottle. Very attractive. I served some of this to some friends in shot glasses (no, we did not drink them as shots). 
Smells of alcohol, vanilla, and maple.
It tastes like it smells and in that order. Nice maple finish as it goes down. 
I was all about this with the 2005 version. I mean really talked this up to friends who themselves loved it. However, this version was a real disappointment. Flavor was consumed by the alcohol in this batch. Someone told me that this version tastes like a cheap port. After having this I would have to agree. Don't get me wrong. I LOVED the 2005 version. I paid a grip of money to get that version and felt it was money well spent. This version really bummed me out. I may be wary of future vintages from now on. I would say, taste this (if you can) before you buy. 883 charactersjneiswender, Dec 20, 2007

Knowing it's rarity and it's tendency to be gone quickly at the GABF, my buddies and I shot straight for the Sam Adams booth and this was our first beer of the day and by far the best. This beer is obviously big but it's complexity is amazing. There's very little carbonation but the mouth feel is excellent. It's very sweet but not overwhelmingly so. It was like liquid candy. Loved it. :) 421 characterssterstar1, Dec 18, 2007
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Drank a 2 oz. sample from a brandy snifter at the Sunset Grill & Tap, Allston, MA
Clear, crimson-mahogany in appearance with absolutely no head or carbonation. As I swirled the beer in my snifter, the liquid left thin legs along the glass (similar to a hard liquor).
The aroma was initially caramel rich and bready before turning sherry-like and complex. Peaches and apricots were apparent along with honey, wild flowers, almonds and traces of berries.
The taste was similar to the aroma yet a bit darker and more aggressive. Sweet, rich and fruity up front. Alcohol soaked raisins, brown sugar and an oaky quality soon appeared. As the beer moved along my palate, the alcohol became increasingly stronger. Apricot brandy came to mind. Eventually the alcohol dominated, trumping all of the more subtle flavor nuances. Sweet alcohol numbed my tongue and warmed my throat on the swallow and nostrils on the exhale. I could hardly believe this was beer. The finish was lasting and sweet, yet slightly tannic and woody, with the syrupy liquid coating my mouth.
If the aroma was comparable to sherry, the taste was definitely a port, and a good one at that. In fact, this libation more closely resembled a port than any other type of beer I have tried.
Sampling Utopias was definitely a unique experience. I would definitely spend the $14 again to do so. Congratulations to Sam Adams for not only brewing the strongest beer in the world but doing so with style and flair. 1,471 charactersDamian, Dec 06, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Let me start by saying this is so distinctive and though technically a beer, it pushes the limits so far, I almost think it should have a different category. I could easily see someone rating this a 1.5 or a 5 just depending on personal preferences. Personnally I like it a lot. One note: it is 27% ABV, not 25%.
Poured into a Reidel Vinum series port glass.
A = A beautiful clear caramel. Nice reflection of light. Coats the glass.
S = Complex smell with caramel, nuts, bourbon, roasted malt. Similar to a dry oloroso sherry or a top flight bourbon. Definite hints of the alcohol but not overpowering given the rich and full smells.
T = Buttery. This beer is incredibly complex. Very sweet flavors of caramel, bourbon, roasted malts, roasted nuts, honey all smothered in butter.
M = Luscious full feel, coats the mouth and stimulates all of the tastebuds.
D = A great drink to be enjoyed slowly after dinner. A good substitute for a port, sherry, scotch, bourbon, cognac, etc. However, it is definitely expensive and if that were not caused by its limited availability, I would say it costs too much for what it is. 1,122 charactersTraquairlover, Nov 24, 2007

Taste is like a kick in the mouth, boozey, and complex beyond belief, all of the tastes in the aroma follow up, but with more intensity, the booze is a bit raw for my tastes, but this beer is 25%.

This beer doesn't come with a lot of head and lace, but that can't be expected from a beer like this. It has a nice dark and full color.
The smell is similar to scotch with some raisin, mint and licorice coming out.
The taste is surprisingly smooth. The strongest beer in the world is not overbearing, it's actually well balanced. Caramel comes out first with raisin and licorice overtones. Some mint comes out as the beer warms. This beer is wonderfully complex and I applaud the Boston Brew Company for making a well crafted beer this high in alcohol content. This beer is more than just 25% alcohol, it pushes the limits of what beer can do and I really admire the BBC for making it.
How could a 25% abv beer be any more drinkable? This beer is definetly a sipper, but considering it's 25% alcohol, it's a damn drinkable beer. 989 charactersjasonjlewis, Oct 15, 2007

The pour is a clear copper color with no carbonation and thick streaming legs on the glass as you swirl it. The nose is very warm and nutty with a lot of maple. The flavor has hazelnuts, vanilla, caramel, figs, and maple that finishes pretty hot, but not as hot as you would think. It defiantly is more like a port wine than a beer. Worth a try if you can get it. 549 charactersHumuloneRed, May 01, 2007

I've had some beers that resembled whiskey before, but this one really takes the cake. Carmel whiskey colored with a thin clear layer on top. No carbonation, but it's not really missed with the degree of complexity and appeal we have here. It's strongest note (both flavor and smell-wise) is maple sugar/syrup. The second strongest note is alcohol; it's warm going down, although not as warm as you'd think..it's strong, but it's also very gentle and easy to drink like a 50-year old bourbon. Carmel, smoke, bbq, peet, blond tobacco, malts, and old leather are all in there, but get lost within the vast universe of flavors. 
Key points are: maple, drinkable, and delicious. Perfect for a cigar. Worth the money? Hell yeah, but I'm still not gonna buy one!!! Cheers! 868 charactersrayjay, Mar 27, 2007

Review #1,200
Appears a copper, dark orange brown with no head, or CO2 present but none expected either from this after dinner treat. No lacing but streaky spider legs stick to the sides of the glass like syrup.
Smell is boozy, maple, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, brandy, port, cognac, raisins, and nougat.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with alcohol up front and blasts of sugar, leather, and tobacco.
Mouthfeel is smooth, sweet up front, blanketing the palate, sugary, warming...a sipper akin to a nice warm brandy, or port.
Well done. 604 charactersweeare138, Feb 22, 2007

4.82/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this at their Dec. 19th tasting. The one remarkable aspect of the Utopias is that it is surprisingly smooth through the entire experience. Other than that, the primary taste notes are butterscotch and alcohol. Once it sits in the mouth, it seems buttery. But alcohol pretty much masks most flavors. The color and the smell was a brandy or cognac, which was expected. Overall, not really impressed but still great stuff. Everyone who tried it had a very surprised look and reaction, in a good way. I'm not experienced with barleywines, so I can't be the best critic, but this just didn't knock me off my feet like I heard it would.
Update: had a glass on NYE 2012 and must say, with developed beer taste buds, this is exceptional. Mind-blowing. So much better than I remember. 780 charactersGatch, Dec 20, 2006
4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Very nice container that it came in. Shared with friends after dinner last night. Treated as a fine cognac.
Pours ruby red with no head (as expected) and no carbonation.
Deep rich, robust aroma of maple and warming alcohol. It smelled like a maple-flavored cordial.
The robust warming alcohol had a tinge of a slight burning sensation at first. But, with the second and subsequent sips maple and a touch of nuttiness put the alcohol in the background. A maple/nutty cognac-like taste is the best way I can describe it.
It's malty and full-bodied.
It's exceptionally smooth. The flavors lingers for a very long time. This is potent, though easily drinkable.
Is it worth $150 - well, if you split the cost with four or five friends - for the once in a life-time experience - sure. Certainly not one to have alone anyway!
It's hardly a beer-like, but - wow - it sure is wonderful! Glad I had a chance to try it! 923 charactersjwc215, Nov 19, 2006
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Finally found my notes for this one... one of those legendry beers that mostly lives up to its name. Into a snifter glass, pours black, viscous, no head, no lacing, no carbonation, just a thick black liquid. Looks dangerous. Aroma is strong, and I mean strong. Heavily bourbon, vanilla, heavy fruits, maybe some oak in there if i can sort it from the bourbon, very intoxicating, delicious. Taste is on the verge of overpowering, can't imagine going more than a snifter full of it. Mirroring aroma, heavy on the bourbon, really more like hard alcohol than beer, complex and fierce, but refined in every sense of the word, smooth and warm in the mouth. This beer is the answer to all those Boston BrewCo bashers, like the Jaguar wing of FordCo. 742 charactersobjectivemonkey, Nov 01, 2006
4.87/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm not sure what all of the interest in this beer was about. The alcohol, I guess. But that seemed gimmicky to me. To try to make the strongest beer in the world. Well, I guess that is something. And it's not overly aggressive either. But at least the bottle is gimmicky! Of course, you're paying for it! I haven't bought it myself, and I never would. 
The first time I tried it I just happened to walk into d.b.a. in Manhattan and found Tony Forder and the Ale Street News gang tasting it. My response... "tastes like Triple Bock with a little more alcohol and a bit more character". And I'd stand by that today. But for my money I'd take the whole case of Triple Bock instead of the fancy bottle. On the other hand, you do have to hand it to the guys at Sam Adam's, as it couldn't have been easy to pull this one off, AND, on top of that it's really well done!

So, it poured a nice copper with no head (not carbonated) smelled and tasted at first like a cross between tawny port and single barrel Bourbon. Repeated tastings narrowed it down to a monster strength J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, or a 10 year tawny, but with more burn. I shared this out with five other friends. We had all we wanted, and dumped the rest out the window (not kidding - it was free, and we had our fill). It tasted marvelous for a beer, but just standard for a good tawny port I bought for a quarter of what this thing originally retailed for. Why go out of your way to pay 120 bucks for something that tastes like a good 35 dollar bottle of port? Oh, because it was free (for me) that's why. Still - an amazing beer. 1,047 charactersdedrinker, Oct 12, 2006
4.09/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had this at a homebrew festival, a generous soul brought a bottle to share. We all got about a shot and it was worth every drop.
Poured deep, dark copper brown with no head, carbonation or lacing.
Smells sweet, a little like brown sugar, some vanilla and an alcohol note.
First thing I tasted was maple, like maple syrup then some roasted caramel, woody/oakey, sweet fruit, like raisins soaked in port, all the while with a pleasant alcohol warmness that continues down into your gut. Each sip brings out something new.
Mouthfell is smooth and sticky, again like drinking maple syrup but not that thick.
Drinkability...Try it if you get the chance, I would again, but this is not a beer one drinks on a daily basis. Definately something special. 750 charactershungryghost, Sep 17, 2006
4.14/5  rDev -6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5On-tap at the Great Taste of the Midwest. I got my hands on two samples worth (probably about 3-4 ounces) because my girlfriend wasn't a fan.
Pour: fiery, crystal clear amber/mahogany, no head of course, fairly viscouse in the glass.
Nose: can literally be smelled from several feet away, even outdoors in the middle of a crowd. Amazing notes of oaked bourbon, rich vanilla, brandy and cherry liquor.
Taste: tongue-numbing booze of course, at 25% you're essentially sipping distilled alcohol. A mix of vanilla-bourbon-oak aged brandy with notes of bourbon-soaked apricots, cherries and raisins. The most potent beverage I've ever sipped and enjoyed.
Feel: oily and slick, yet thinned and super dry due to the immense alcohol content. No carbonation to speak of. Burningly strong and warming all the way down the gullet.
Drinkability/Overall: an amazing experience that I am glad to have had a chance to partake in. Truly blurs the line between beer and spirits. Distinct and refined, this is the sipper of all sippers. Worth the money for a bottle? Not for a starving college student like me, unless I won the lottery, wherein this would become a staple in my liquor cabinet. 1,190 charactersGolden2wenty1, Aug 23, 2006
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ok, just to preface this review, this is a Utopias 2002. 
This is my ast 3 ounces of my Sam Adams Utopias 2002, bottle #2166. Cost me $106 4 years ago, opened it 6 months ago, and it's still drinking a good as when I opened it. 
Poured into my DFH longstemmed Raison D'etre chalace. 
No head. No lace. None. But with no carbonation, that shouldn't surprise anyone. Quite viscous. With a swirl you can see the nape being left on the sides of the glass. The nape takes the place of the lace, slowly dripping down the side of the glass at inconsistant intervals. 
Murky off brown color with dark orange highlights. Sits as flat as a pond at day break. No movement, save the last remaining drops of nape continuing on it's decent towards the beer. 
Now, I have a fan at my back. And the beer is in front of me. 2 feet in front of me. And I can still smell the aroma of this beer, even without roughing it up a bit. Immediate alcohol bit on the nose. Almost burns the sinuses when I immerse my nose into the glass. I'm glad I went with a glass so wide, to get the full effect of the aroma. Heavy maple syrup, brandy soaked prunes, port reduction, vanilla, oak. No discernable "beer" smell, but what a smell. 
Slight burning on the tongue upon the first sip. Chard oak chips, vanilla extract. Warms the belly from the get-go. Like a sip of good apricot brandy on a cold winter night. This being the middle of August, my belly was already warm, but it just got alot warmer. Heavy alcohol taste, over-ripe bing cherries. Very complex. I could sit here for a long time and keep finding different tastes. I'm sure that's what Jim was looking for in this "beer". 
Viscous? Yeah, you could say so. Thick on the tongue, thick on the glass. Drinks like a cognac, and at 25%, it should be treated with respect. Not even your average sipping beer. This one is special. 
Now, I've heard people say, "whoever spends $106 (or now $150) on a bottle of beer is crazy.". Well, they may be right. But ya know what, I worked hard for that money I spent on this beer. It is like no other beer I've ever had, or will have in my life (unless I get another bottle, which is definately not out of the question). It's an experience. Some people go to strip clubs and drop $500/night for something they won't remember the next day. I spent $106 on something I'll remember for rhe rest of my life. Personally, I think it's worth it. 2,414 charactersBrewfan, Aug 08, 2006
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This one pours completely flat with a rich color. 
The smell is port like with some vanilla. The alcohol is evident, but not burning like hard liquor, and it lends to a warming sensation as you sip. There are tastes of vanilla, port, and there is a strong malt profile that is distinctly beer. I could detect some noble like hop flavors even if they were subtle. There is a lot going on with this very different and complex brew. 
The mouthfeel is sweet and viscous. The drinkability would be as high as a sipper like this one can be. I would enjoy it far more often if I could find it and afford it. Superb and different.
I like how Sam Adams can still demonstrate a huge set of balls when they want to. 713 charactersgotbeer, Jul 21, 2006

Smells like a good oloroso sherry with aromas of dried apricot, burnt sugar, vanilla, prune, maple, hazelnuts. The flavours on the palate follow through with a little more of a boubon overtone, and more than a little heat on the finish. Absolutley fascinating! 364 charactersHefe, Jun 19, 2006

Is a dark, murky brown color with no carbonation and no head whatsoever, but with this high of alcohol I cannot punish it for that. Smell is of candy, burnt sugar, vanilla, and alcohol is noticeable (not surprisingly) in the nose. Taste is very strong, burnt sugar, maple syrup, vanilla, and an alcohol is present but does not over power you as one might expect. Mouthfeel is thick an syrup-like with no carbonation, very smooth. Drinkability is tough to judge, it's good no doubt, but you couldn't possibly think of drinking very much. Definately worth a try in my book.
Much thanks to hero27 for graciously sharing. 646 charactersbadbeer, May 05, 2006

The smell has sweet burnt sugar with a very strong alcohol scent. 
Tastes of sweet butterscotch, burnt sugar, maple syrup, and a slight vanilla flavor.
Mouthfeel isn't watery, it's more of a hard alcohol feel to it.
Sippable and enjoyable, I would enjoy more of this if it was free again. 469 charactersErdinger2003, May 04, 2006

Natgurally, this is a sipper...smooth for the extreme abv. Evereyone should try this at least once in their beer tasting lifetime. 379 charactersedchicma, Apr 24, 2006
4.41/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The last bottle at the House of Brews in NYC - they actually had to walk to their other location to get it!
It was worth the wait, and money. 
Smells intensely like caramel and fire. No head whatsoever, but a beautiful color  amber and copper with a gold brazen hue. You really can smell it from the other side of the bar. They poured a rather large 1 oz dose of this limited brew in small snifters. Goes down with a rather nice burn, from the abundance of alcohol, and a warming aftertaste reminiscent of fresh gingerbread cookies.
It is very similar to a fine brandy, cognac or even scotch in the way that it is sipped slowly and for longer duration of time. I find it difficult calling this a beer - but, as it is I would highly recommend trying this if the opportunity comes your way. 799 charactersHimerMan, Apr 05, 2006
3.83/5  rDev -13.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5On tap from a wooden cask at the N.E.W. Beerfest in Appleton, WI on Satuday April 1, 2006.
As you would imagine, this was highly sought after at the fest and when I showed up, five minutes after the doors opened, there was already a long line for this brew.
I could smell this one as people who had already made their way to the front of the line passed me on their way back out. I heard that there were some people who bought a ticket to the fest, merely to try this beer.
It poured with absolutely ZERO head. The color was somewhat hard to peg but I'd call it a golden chestnut that literally shimmered in the glass. The appearance reminded me of Frangelico and for that matter, while it smelled and tasted differently, the aroma had that kind of quality to it. The alcohol was very apparent, to the nose.
Taste was very sweet, with strong vanilla, carmel and toffee overtones. It was also somewhat smokey. The alcohol was ever present from start to finish.
Drinkability was good but I've had numerous other big beers that were more dinkable, albeit slightly less alcohol. While I enjoyed this (as much for the novelty as for the taste), I think I'd still rather spend $16 on two, 12 ounce DFH WWS or Raison D'Extra vs $100 or more for 750ml of this. Then again, I'm sure I'm not really the target customer for this product.
If this were priced more competitively, I'd probably be more inclined to try it again and again but for the money, I'll just be happy I've had the opportunity to try it once. If I stumble upon it again at the same kind of venue, I'll be sure to take advantage.
A final note: I can only assume that the cask conditioned sample I had yesterday would be completely different from a bottled sample. 1,742 charactersnflmvp, Apr 02, 2006

The nose is sharp and extremely alcoholic if you take a big sniff very close to the glass, but if you sniff from a bit further away and use the wafting method, an unbelievable range of aromas comes about, including caramel, vanilla, mocha, maple and hazelnut. Rich, diverse range of flavors, very similar to the aromatic descriptors above. The alcohol is huge, but I didnt find it overwhelming in any way, but well hidden. 540 charactersCrosling, Mar 28, 2006

Yeah, I know it's $150 and that scares a lot of people, but they only make 8000 bottles for the entire world, it comes out once a year and it's 25% abv. It pours golden-amber- brownish with a light ring around the top. This "beer" drinks more like a port or fine cognac with a certain level of "burn" on the lengthy finish. A real treat if you ever get the chance. 457 charactersMattBrooks, Mar 09, 2006
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter. 
This was very expensive, but at least the bottle is cool looking.
Golden brown pour, no head, no carbonation.
Smell is strong. Maple, vanilla, peat and alcohol. 
I was bracing for a sharp alcohol bite, but didn't get one. It started to bite, but the maple and caramel flavors covered it well. Very sweet, kinda smokey. Seems like a cross between a tawny port and scotch, maybe a little thicker. Couldn't drink more than about 2 oz. Bottle comes with a screw top so it will keep for a while. 518 charactersMebuzzard, Mar 02, 2006
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I have been looking forward to trying this beer for a long long time and finally had the chance recently. Pours a golden color with no carbonation to be seen anywhere. The aroma is very alcoholic, but lends way to something that reminds me of a tawny port. Very strong vanilla, cherry, and some wood character. Extremely complex. The flavor has all kinds of stuff going on. Starts out with a caramel and cherry thing then melds with the vanilla. The alcohol is obvious, but it's not overbearing like I expected. This beer is extremely easy to drink, surprisingly. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is surprisingly good for such a high abv. 650 charactersclvand0, Feb 20, 2006
4.09/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I'm excited to finally get a chance to sample this one, being that it's the strongest beer in the world and carries a hefty price tag. The Utopias pours into my brandy snifter a wonderful golden, copper with hints of red. No carbonation to be found here. Sticky clear, syrupy lacing cascades down the side of the snifter. It's hard to find a resemblance to beer here, but I do love the color. Aromas are quite intense with caramel, vanilla bean, cherry, pure maple syrup and a heady woodiness that's a touch smoky. The alcohol is readily apparent in the nose. Lots of bourbon and scotch undertones are present as well. Quite amazing that this is in fact a beer and not a liquor. Lovely aroma.
First sip brings a sweet caramel/vanilla infusion across the palate with a cherry fruitiness as well. Maple syrupy goodness collides with woody flavors, butter rum and a touch of honey. As is flows down the throat the alcohol warmth goes all the way down as well. Quality bourbon and oak come to mind with each sip of this intiguing brew. A wonderful melding of flavors. 
Mouthfeel is smooth, slick and sweet. It's 25% abv but there's no harsh alcohol burn to be found here, making it easy to swirl it around your mouth and really enjoy the flavors of each sip. This is really quite tasty and an enlightening experience to show just how far the limits of beer can be pushed. The high price tag will keep me away for now, but maybe someday I'll be able to snag a whole bottle of this for myself. Kudos to Jim Koch and Sam Adams for pushing the limits and thanks to blitheringidiot as well for giving me the opportunity to enjoy this rare treat. 1,642 charactersorbitalr0x, Feb 19, 2006

Similar to what a remember but a bit more balanced and well-rounded. Seemed more refined and/or tamed, which may just be a reflection of my tastes getting muted. Still a great beer, thanks to Party Source for making it available. 
Original Review, Jan. 2006 - Served out of a one-ounce baby bottle, shipped courtesy of blitheringidiot. I guess that counts as a growler.
Appearance is syrupy with no carbonation, kind of like watered-down coke syrup. Very light lacing that clings and drops into a honeycomb like form.
Smells like alcohol. Very much alcohol, almost like paint thinner at first. Then more subtle smells work out like walnut, or pecan scents and a bit of caramel. Kind of smell like a nut-topped coffee cake.
Taste is nutty and caramelly, like a very strong butter toffee perhaps. Lingering flavor of honey.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth with flavor that envelopes the mouth and a pleasant smooth burn as it goes down.
Drinkability is surprisingly high for me. I'd probably buy a bottle if I could find one around here. (Ohio doesn't sell beer above 10 percent or so.) 1,195 charactersmasterbruewer, Feb 01, 2006
4.22/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I'm not sure if this was really on cask; it was drawn from a small barrel with a hand pump, so I'm assuming...
Poured a dark copper with no head, no carbonation, and no expectation of either. It looked more like sherry than beer.
Initial aroma was of a very strong cream sherry or port; vinous, oaky, with a hint of vanilla.
Tasted very much like a cream sherry, and a little like bourbon, with some alcohol heat, and, again, vanilla.
I was a little wary before trying this, not being sure what the mouthfeel of an uncarbonated beer would be like. Thin? Watery? Insubstantial? Boy was I wrong! Thick and full, almost tongue-coating.
As good as this is, too much of a good thing is indeed too much. More than a snifter and this would lose much of its appeal.
I was glad to have the opportunity to try this (at the brewery -- free, no less), and if I had the extra $$$ I'd get myself a bottle. For now, though, I"ll content myself with memories of this incredible brew. 985 charactersAJPainter, Jan 28, 2006
3.94/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3This is my second bottle of Utopias (2005), so I figured that it was time I got around to reviewing it. I poured about 2-3 ounces into my Chimay mini goblet. The ale is at room temperature.
Appearance: The ale is a deep ruby red with hints of orange. It pours without carbonation, hence no head or lace. The ale is translucent, no floaties.
Smell: Alcohol is immediately evident. Behind that, maple syrup comes through and is quite intense. The aroma is unlike any other beer that I have ever smelled.
Taste: If the aroma is unique, the taste is also one-of-a-kind. The high alcohol content is evident from the second the beer hits the tongue. After that, the sugary sweetness of maple syrup comes through, along with a hint of candied sugars. There is little hop character, but I think that hops would push this beer over the top.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is a little astringent, based on the abv. The bitterness of the alcohol and sweetness of the syrup, while intriguing, are not flavors to keep on the tongue for a long time.
Drinkability: Excellent as a novelty beer (TRY THE STRONGEST BEER IN THE WORLD!). Treated like a scotch, this is one ale to savor, as the flavors and aromas have never been repeated (in my experience). 1,246 charactersakorsak, Jan 24, 2006
3.65/5  rDev -17.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I went to a Big Beers Barelywine and Belgium festival in Vail CO and Utopia was on tap. Well sort of. They had about a 5 gallon wooden barrel that they tapped directly and poured directly from there. So I sampled this beer on tap.
The pour was very thick with a very hazy amber to bronze color. I would say it seemed thicker then motor oil. Like watered down syrup. There was no foam or lacing as I would have expected. The smell was super rich and very similar to port. I was expecting more of a phenol aroma but instead got more of a toasted almost caramel nose.
The taste was thick as well. The flavor coats your mouth. A big caramel flavor with a molasses aftertaste. Reminds my of cough syrup. The alcohol is noticed but doesnt burn as it goes down. Malty is the best word to describe it.
The drinkability of this is much easier then I would expect. You could almost say it was smooth. It is not a liquor-esk taste but still demands your attention with the malty, syrupy, alcoholic bomb.
Overall, Im glad I got to try this but I dont think I would ever want to buy it. $25 for a entry fee beats $150 for a bottle any day. 1,148 charactersOxymoron, Jan 13, 2006

nice clear reddish amber with no foam and no head. sticks to the glass when it's swirled.
smells like brandy or a sweet sherry. alcohol is present, but mainly sweet raisins with a touch of maple.
taste reminds me more of a pedro ximenez sherry, fortified even further. sweet raisins with less of an alcohol kick than i'd expect, but it's definitely there. touch of earthy, peaty scotch flavors as well.
in comparison, is far better and more drinkable than the other strong beers i've tried, such as Dogfish's WWS and 120 IPA or Sam's Triple Bock. setting the record for alcohol content while making an enjoyable sipper? have to call this one an unqualified success. 741 charactersPrufrock, Jan 08, 2006

The smell? Smells like a fine cognac to me and gives me the giggles because I *love* a good cognac. Swirling it in the glass, it looks so thick and syrupy, it's not a cognac, Bill, it is not!
As my mouth sips into the intial offering, I'm thinking, wow. Maple syrup sweetness mixed with the heat of 25% abv...where is the sub zero degree weather when you really would *not* mind it being there??? What a warming drink Sam Adams has cast upon us and for that experimentation, I salute them!

4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a clear, ruby amber color. The aroma is quite pronounced and concentrated with notes of brandy, concentrated malt almost extract light notes. There is lots of hot alcohol fumes, but it is not so much that it dominates the other aromatics, in fact it is in a pretty good balance with the concentrated malt notes. This really does smell like a brandy, or a scotch or perhaps a bourbon, I can't really say, but it does have a sticky sweet note that is not really found in any of these.
The taste is sweet, but not overly so and has a concentrated maltiness to it. There are also flavor notes reminiscent of molasses and maple syrup here. The finish, at times, is dominated by hot alcohol notes that make the finish reminiscent of rum. Actually the more I think of it, the more apt the rum analogy is; there are lots of molasses and fermented cane flavor type notes here. The flavors are so concentrated that they are almost overwhelming, some of the notes I can't seem to pick out. I do get notes of vanilla, lots of caramel, and toffee brittle. 1,051 charactersGueuzedude, Dec 20, 2005
4.03/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Here is a trick question: How to review a 25% ABV beer? Here is the answer:
To appreciate the appearance of this beer, one must observe the lace dripping down after a healthy swirl. Perfection with small drippy drops. A clear honey hue with no nada nothin' carbonation. This is awl-kee-hawl booze! 
Scents and flavors mirror one another. Pecan and vanilla extract that is exquisite. A cool warmth (does that make sense?) as this goes back. Beer? Really??? Hmmm. Honestly I am not a booze fan but this is the best darned booze I've ever tried. Just a smooth nutty butter pecan full flavored treat. My best humble guess is that this this pretty good, actually. 
Feel is hot but tasty.
Last swigs: Is this worth the price? NO!!! Is Jim K. a genius at marketing this stuff? YES!!! Props goes to Jim K. He made a good awl-kee-hawl beer and people actually are stupid enough to shell out $100+ ducats to taste it. What a belly holding laff! Should you seek this. Naw, but if it falls in your lap, check it. 1,012 charactersblitheringidiot, Dec 10, 2005
4.31/5  rDev -2.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Limited 2005 Edition. Bottle #00732. 24oz. Beautiful bronze/copper brew kettle bottle. Easily the most stunning bottle I've ever seen..downright impressive just to look at. Sam Adams signature engraved on the front, and on the back, copper sliding doors that reveal a picture of Samuel Adams. Bottom of the bottle is individually numbered in gold lettering.
Strongest beer in the world? Sure, it's somewhat of a gimmick, but I still had to try it. Saw it at John's Grocery in Iowa City and took the only two bottles they had.
Served right around 60 degrees..let it warm to room temp as we drank it. 
Pours a clear bronze/amber color..looks very much like cognac or whiskey. No head, lace, or carbonation, but it holds to the glass like syrup..very sticky consistency. Aroma is surprisingly alcoholic..smells stronger than many 40-50% liquors I've had...wow. Sweet smells of brown sugar and almost has a tequila-like quality to it. Interesting..
Tastes are incredible..very sweet & rich..dark fruits, brown sugar, smoky malts, oak, vanilla, molasses, cinnamon, raisins, maple syrup....with a slight burning alcohol finish. Hop character is subdued by the huge malty tastes and alcohol bite. Very warming and has a wonderful complexity to it. 
Overall, I'd say the 24 ounces probably isn't "worth" the $100+ price tag, but then again, what could be worth that? What's gold going for an ounce these days? Other great high-alcohol beers such as DFH World Wide Stout and DFH 120 Minute IPA are less than $10 per 12oz bottle, and are around 20%. You can't get much more unique, though..and it was nice to get the chance to try it. Goes down remarkably smooth and is surprisingly drinkable as well..the tastes linger on the tongue, and as soon as they fade, you find yourself yearning for another sip.
If you have money burning a hole in your pocket and can find this great brew, I'd say go for it. You can always split the cost with a few friends like I did. That way you won't feel so guilty when you're staring at the gorgeous empty bottle. 2,054 charactershero27, Dec 04, 2005

3.69/5  rDev -16.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Back Story - A major men's publication, Stuff Magazine, printed the "80 Best American Beers" a couple of months ago. The validity of the list is and whether they are truly the "80 best" beers is highly debatable. Whether or not they were actually the 80 best my friend Richey and I made it a goal to try all 80. The only rules were the two of us had to drink the beer in each other's presence for it to get checked of the list. To make a long story short Utopias was on the list. We found a bottle on eBay, shelled out the dough and it arrived a few days later.
Appearance-Dark in color. Deep brownish crimson. Dark, rusty in color.
Smell-Very strong. This does not smell like beer. It smells more like a brandy or other "after-dinner" alcohol. It has a very spicy odor.
Taste-This does not taste like beer either. It has a more brandy-like flavor. I taste spice. A cinnamon flavor is stron and I even pick up a hint of cloves. This is not for the macro-brew fan. This is not a session beer. There is an alcohol taste but it is not overpowering.
Mouthfeel-Smooth and thick. It feels good in the mouth. Warming. 
Drinkability-Considering the alcohol content it was surprisingly drinkable. You could taste the alcohol so if you don't like hard liquor you may not like this. As mentioned before this is NOT a session beer. The label describes the best way to drink it, and think it is accurate: room temperature (we chilled it too and I preferred it chilled) in small (1 or 2 oz) portions. 1,501 charactersatomicbwax, Oct 16, 2005
4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4How many samples of this did I drink at the Jom Koch lead tour at BBC in JP..at least 4 or 5. Why? Cause it was unbelievably tasty. Normally I shy away from these huge alcohol beers, but this was surprisingly drinkable. Where do we start. First, it looks like cognac in the glass. Good start. Secondly, while the alcohol is very very evident in the aroma, my impression was of a good reposada tequila: some spice, maybe some cinnamon, definitely enticing. Tastewise it is surprisingly sweet, aka, no alcohol burn, which is why I was able to drink so many samples ;-) A very smooth drinking beer, there's a lot of different angles of sweetness here: maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, even fruit sweetness from raisins. Add a bit of butterscotch in the finish. I really enjoyed this one, and kudos to BBC for this tasty, sipping brew. 834 charactersPatandDavid, Sep 10, 2005
4.12/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Presented to me as a 3oz. pour in a snifter the beer was a flat brown brandy color. No head and no carbonation. One would easily mistake it for liquor had one not know it was beer.
Smell is very alcoholic upfront, perhaps even more than its indicated 25% ABV. Brandy in the nose, almost nothing else.
The taste is a slightly burning alcohol upfront with all malt to the beer and not the slightest hint of hops. Caramel, grapes, raisins, mollases, and toffee are all coming thru. Some undertones of prunes and dried fruit as well.
A thick syrupy consistancy that even coats and it quite potent. Zero carbonation.
This beer can simply be had no other way than sipping. The 3oz. I had was enough to enjoy, and a good, albiet very different beer. 754 charactersSycodrummer, Sep 09, 2005
4.37/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Wow. Scored a free sample at a beerbar in NYC (which I will not name, for fear they'll be bombarded with people wanting free samples.) I was surprised, very surprised, by what I drank.
Pretty color (from what I could see- it was a SMALL sample) and smelled of maple, vanilla... sherry-y. You can smell the alcohol, but it's not overpowering. Taste is... amazing. Cognac comes to mind. Sweet, but not too sweet. The alcohol was sneaky and warming. I expected to be gagging and coughing after one sip, but I found myself really enjoying it. I sipped and savored. Couldn't do too much of this- like cognac- but I enjoyed my little snifter of it. I would have it again, cerainly- for free, of course. 699 charactersscooter231, Aug 26, 2005
4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Had this great extrodinarily rare beer at a Sam Adams tasting recently at the Hop Devil Grill in Manhattan. I only had a small 1 oz. pour, but with a beer such as this, that's plenty to get a good idea of how flavorful and amazing this beer is. This was actually the second time that I've had this brew. Once was a year or two ago at the Extreme Beer Festival in Boston. I think that at that point I didn't have a good enough palete to really know what I was tasting. 
This time however, I was much more prepared for the goodness that was to come. The beer was in a small 4 oz. glass and looked like highly viscous maple syrup. The scent was strong maple and vanilla flavors with a hint of scotch to let you know it was in a barrel before you got to it. 
The first sip is just an assult on your mouth. It is so smooth and has a nice vanilla and maple taste that's just hard to describe. There's an apparent alcohol kick to it, but it's actually warming and nice. I would love a large 4 oz. glass of this, but anything more than that and I think it would just hurt me :) 
If you ever see it around, I would pick up a bottle (at $180 I know it's rough) for special occasions. 1,182 charactersBuildscharacter, Aug 21, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sampled (two samples actually) at the brewery during the BA Jim Koch tour.
Pours a rich auburn with zero carbonation, zero head. I would describe this beer as having "nice legs" like a wine or port. Smells of sherry. I have heard it compared to cognac but I have no frame of reference there. Vanilla, oak, alcohol, and bright caramel and molasses all intermingle in the nose.
Sherry is the flavor that dominates here but lets break it down a little. Roasty caramel, vanilla, hints of black currant and oak. Alcohol is a bit pronounced but not as much as I would have expected. This beer is refined and sophisticated, not rough. Lightly sticky in the mouth with a dry finish. A sipper to be sure but a tasty one. 717 charactersViveLaChouffe, Jul 28, 2005
4.02/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 407/08/05- Sampled at BA member Spinlock's house last night.
Presentation- Sampler size taste from the copper-esque bottle.
Appearance- Just what is a 25% beer supposed to look like? Cognac colored pour with no head or lacing. Guess that's about right?
Smell- Wow, strongest beer I have ever smelled. Pretty much a brandy hard alcohol smell. No hops or malt detected. A good strong scent though.
Taste- Cognac like flavor, maybe even a scotch whiskey influenced flavor. Raisins, maybe a bit of aged orange flavor to go with some oak and caramel. Maple syrup in the finish.
Mouthfeel- Smooth...very smooth. No carbonation here. Syrupy sweet and cloying.
Drinkability- Just a bit of this was good enough for me. Good stuff best had as an after dinner aperatif. Thanks Pete for the chance to try this wonderful brew! 830 charactersGClarkage, Jul 09, 2005
